<text>Flavia Julia Helena (; , &quot;Helénē&quot;;  – 330), also known as Helena of Constantinople and in Christianity as Saint Helena, was an &quot;Augusta&quot; of the Roman Empire and mother of Emperor Constantine the Great. She was born in the lower classes traditionally in the city of Drepanon, Bithynia, in Asia Minor, which was renamed Helenopolis in her honor, although several locations have been proposed for her birthplace and origin.

Helena ranks as an important figure in the history of Christianity. In her final years, she made a religious tour of Syria Palaestina and Jerusalem, during which ancient tradition claims that she discovered the True Cross. The Eastern Orthodox Church, Catholic Church, Oriental Orthodox Churches, Anglican Communion, and the Lutheran Church revere her as a saint.
== Early life ==
Though Helena&#x27;s birthplace is not known with certainty, Helenopolis, then Drepanon, in Bithynia, following Procopius, is the one supported by most secondary sources, and by far the most likely candidate for her place of origin. If so, it would make her a Greek speaker or possibly bilingual. Her name is attested on coins as Flavia Helena, Flavia Julia Helena and sometimes Aelena. Joseph Vogt suggested that the name Helena was typical for the Greek-speaking part of the Roman Empire and that therefore her place of origin should be looked for in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire. No Greek inscriptions have been attested dedicated to Helena during her lifetime, which may be because her fame was not as great in the Greek East as in the Latin West where she resided as empress. The 6th-century historian Procopius is the earliest authority for the statement that Helena was a native of Drepanon, in the province of Bithynia in Asia Minor. The name Helena appears in all areas of the Empire, but is not epigraphically attested in inscriptions of Bithynia (Helena&#x27;s proposed region of origin) and it was also common in Latin-speaking areas. Procopius lived much later than the era he was describing and his description may have been actually intended as an etymological explanation about the toponym &quot;Helenopolis&quot;. On the other hand, her son Constantine renamed the city &quot;Helenopolis&quot; after her death around AD 330, which supports the belief that the city was indeed her birthplace. The historian Cyril Mango has argued that Helenopolis was refounded to strengthen the communication network around Constantine&#x27;s new capital in Constantinople, and was renamed simply to honor Helena, not to necessarily mark her birthplace. However, according to historian Julia Hillner, Constantine&#x27;s nephew, Emperor Julian, granting city status to a nearby village in Bithynia and naming it Basilinopolis in honor of his own mother, Basilina, who was undoubtedly from Bithynia, provides solid evidence that the renaming to Helenopolis marked Helena&#x27;s birthplace. Constantine named two other locations after Helena: Helenopolis in Palestine, apparently due to Helena&#x27;s renowned pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and the province of Helenopontus in the Pontus, which was in the same region as Drepanon, but further to the east. Two other locations have been named after Helena: a &quot;vicus&quot; Helena in northern France, and an &quot;oppidum&quot; Helena in the Pyrenees, which took its name due to Emperor Constans, a grandson of Helena, being murdered there, and corresponded with a prophecy which predicted that Constans would die in the arms of his grandmother. Other suggestions about her birthplace, without strong documentation, are Naissus (central Balkans), Caphar or Edessa (Mesopotamia), and Trier.

The bishop and historian Eusebius of Caesarea states that Helena was about 80 on her return from Palestine. Since that journey has been dated to 326–28, she was probably born around 246 to 249. Information about her social background universally suggests that she came from the lower classes. Fourth-century sources, following Eutropius&#x27; &quot;Breviarium,&quot; record that she came from a humble background. Bishop Ambrose of Milan, writing in the late 4th century was the first to call her a &quot;stabularia&quot;, a term translated as &quot;stable-maid&quot; or &quot;inn-keeper&quot;. He makes this comment a virtue, calling Helena a &quot;bona stabularia&quot;, a &quot;good stable-maid&quot;, probably to contrast her with the general suggestion of sexual laxness considered typical of that group. Other sources, especially those written after Constantine&#x27;s proclamation as emperor, gloss over or ignore her background. Some ancient historians, &quot;pagan and therefore hostile to the family ... suggested that as a girl she had been one of the supplementary amenities of her father&#x27;s establishment, regularly available to his clients at a small extra charge.&quot;

Both Geoffrey of Monmouth and Henry of Huntingdon promoted a popular tradition that Helena was a British princess and the daughter of &quot;Old King Cole&quot; from the area of Colchester. This led to the later dedication of 135 churches in England to her, many in around the area of Yorkshire, and revived as a suggestion in the 20th century in the novel by Evelyn Waugh.

== Marriage to Constantius ==
It is unknown where she first met Constantius. The historian Timothy Barnes has suggested that Constantius, while serving under Emperor Aurelian, could have met her while stationed in Asia Minor for the campaign against Zenobia. It is said that upon meeting they were wearing identical silver bracelets; Constantius saw her as his divinely-sent soulmate. Barnes calls attention to an epitaph at Nicomedia of one of Aurelian&#x27;s protectors, which could indicate the emperor&#x27;s presence in the Bithynian region soon after AD 270. The precise legal nature of the relationship between Helena and Constantius is also unknown. The sources are equivocal on the point, sometimes calling Helena Constantius&#x27; &quot;wife&quot;, and sometimes, following the dismissive propaganda of Constantine&#x27;s rival Maxentius, calling her his &quot;concubine&quot;. Jerome, perhaps confused by the vague terminology of his own sources, manages to do both.

Some scholars, such as the historian Jan Drijvers, assert that Constantius and Helena were joined in a common-law marriage, a cohabitation recognized in fact but not in law. Others, like Timothy Barnes, assert that Constantius and Helena were joined in an official marriage, on the grounds that the sources claiming an official marriage are more reliable.

Helena gave birth to the future emperor Constantine I on 27 February of an uncertain year soon after 270 (probably around 272). At the time, she was in Naissus (Niš, Serbia). In order to obtain a wife more consonant with his rising status, Constantius divorced Helena some time before 289, when he married Theodora, Maximian&#x27;s daughter under his command. The narrative sources date the marriage to 293, when Constantius was appointed &quot;caesar&quot; (heir-apparent) of Maximian, but the Latin panegyric of 289 refers to the new couple as already married. Helena and her son were dispatched to the court of Diocletian at Nicomedia, where Constantine grew to be a member of the inner circle. Helena never remarried and lived for a time in obscurity, though close to her only son, who had a deep regard and affection for her.

== After Constantine&#x27;s ascension to the throne ==

Constantine was proclaimed &quot;augustus&quot; (emperor) in 306 by Constantius&#x27; troops after the latter had died, and following his elevation his mother was brought back to the public life in 312, returning to the imperial court. She appears in the Eagle Cameo portraying Constantine&#x27;s family, probably commemorating the birth of Constantine&#x27;s son Constantine II in the summer of 316.

She lived in the Horti Spei Veteris in Rome which she converted into an even more luxurious palace.

According to Eusebius, Helena was converted to Christianity by Constantine. 

She was first given the title of &quot;nobilissima femina&quot;. He later appointed her as &quot;Augusta&quot; in 324, following the defeat of his rival Licinius. According to Eusebius, he gave her unlimited access to the imperial treasury. 

== Pilgrimage and relic discoveries ==


In AD 326–328 Helena undertook a trip to Palestine. According to Eusebius of Caesarea, who records the details of her pilgrimage to Palestine and other eastern provinces, and Socrates Scholasticus, she was responsible for the construction or beautification of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, and the Church of Eleona on the Mount of Olives; sites of Christ&#x27;s birth and ascension, respectively. Local founding legend attributes to Helena&#x27;s orders the construction of a church in Egypt to identify the Burning Bush of Sinai. The chapel at Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery—often referred to as the Chapel of Saint Helen—is dated to the year 330. However, a number of modern scholars believe this trip also had a political purpose, in addition to pilgrimage. Scholars believe that Eusebius&#x27; account led to later legends connecting her with the True Cross.

=== The True Cross and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre ===

She is most famous for the discovery of the True Cross, which she was not responsible. Emperor Hadrian had built during the 130s a temple to Venus over the supposed site of Jesus&#x27; tomb near Calvary, and renamed the city Aelia Capitolina. Accounts differ concerning whether the temple was dedicated to Venus or Jupiter. According to Eusebius, Constantine destroyed the temple of Venus and discovered the burial site of Jesus in the spot. Later legends had Helena destroying the temple.

According to tradition, Helena ordered the temple torn down and, according to the legend that arose at the end of the 4th century, chose a site to begin excavating, which led to the recovery of three different crosses. The legend is recounted in Ambrose, &quot;On the Death of Theodosius&quot; (died 395) and at length in Rufinus&#x27; chapters appended to his translation into Latin of Eusebius&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, the main body of which does not mention the event. Then, Rufinus relates, the empress refused to be swayed by anything short of solid proof and performed a test. Possibly through Bishop Macarius of Jerusalem, she had a woman who was near death brought from the city. When the woman touched the first and second crosses, her condition did not change, but when she touched the third and final cross she suddenly recovered, and Helena declared the cross with which the woman had been touched to be the True Cross.

On the site of discovery, Constantine ordered the building of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Churches were also built on other sites detected by Helena.

The &quot;Letter From Constantine to Macarius of Jerusalem&quot;, as presented in Eusebius&#x27; &quot;Life of Constantine&quot;, states:
Sozomen and Theodoret claim that Helena also found the nails of the crucifixion. To use their miraculous power to aid her son, Helena allegedly had one placed in Constantine&#x27;s helmet, and another in the bridle of his horse. According to one tradition, Helena acquired the Holy Tunic on her trip to Jerusalem and sent it to Trier.

=== Cyprus ===
Several relics purportedly discovered by Helena are now in Cyprus, where she spent some time. Among them are items believed to be part of Jesus Christ&#x27;s tunic, pieces of the holy cross, and pieces of the rope with which Jesus was tied on the Cross. The rope, considered to be the only relic of its kind, has been held at the Stavrovouni Monastery, which was also said to have been founded by Helena. According to tradition, Helena is responsible for the large population of cats in Cyprus. Local tradition holds that she imported hundreds of cats from Egypt or Palestine in the fourth century to rid a monastery of snakes. The monastery is today known as &quot;St. Nicholas of the Cats&quot; (Greek ) and is located near Limassol.

=== Rome ===

Helena left Jerusalem and the eastern provinces in 327 to return to Rome, her place of residence. Later legends depict her as bringing with her large parts of the True Cross and other relics, which were then stored in her palace&#x27;s private chapel, now the Basilica of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, where they can be still seen today. This has been maintained by Cistercian monks in the monastery which has been attached to the church for centuries.

== Death and burial ==
Helena died around 330, with her son at her side. She was buried in the Mausoleum of Helena, outside Rome on the Via Labicana. Her sarcophagus is on display in the Pio-Clementine Vatican Museum, next to the sarcophagus of her granddaughter Constantina (Saint Constance). However, in 1154 her remains were replaced in the sarcophagus with the remains of Pope Anastasius IV, and Helena&#x27;s remains were moved to Santa Maria in Ara Coeli. Some of her remains were subsequently moved to the Relic Crypt of St. Helena at Église Saint-Leu-Saint-Gilles in Paris, where they are under the supervision of local Russian Orthodox priests. 

== Sainthood ==

Helena is considered by the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Eastern and Roman Catholic churches, as well as by the Anglican Communion and Lutheran Churches, as a saint. She is sometimes known as Helen of Constantinople to distinguish her from others with similar names.

Her feast day as a saint of the Eastern Orthodox Church is celebrated with her son on 21 May, the &quot;Feast of the Holy Great Sovereigns Constantine and Helena, Equal to the Apostles&quot;. Her feast day in the Roman Catholic Church and in Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate falls on 18 August. Her feast day in the Coptic Orthodox Church is on 9 Pashons.
Some Anglican and Lutheran churches keep the 21 May date. Helena is honored in the Church of England on 21 May but in the Episcopal Church on 22 May.
In the Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Churches, the feast of Meskel, which commemorates her discovery of the cross, is celebrated on 17 Meskerem in the Ethiopian calendar (September 27, Gregorian calendar, or on 28 September in leap years). The holiday is usually celebrated with the lighting of a large bonfire, or &quot;Demera&quot;, based on the belief that she had a revelation in a dream. She was told that she should make a bonfire and that the smoke would show her where the true cross was buried. So she ordered the people of Jerusalem to bring wood and make a huge pile. After adding frankincense to it, the bonfire was lit and the smoke rose high up to the sky and returned to the ground, exactly to the spot where the Cross had been buried.

Uncovering of the Precious Cross and the Precious Nails (Roodmas) by Empress Saint Helen in Jerusalem falls on 6 March.

She is also commemorated every Bright Wednesday along with the saints from Mount Sinai, by the Russian Orthodox Church and the Orthodox Church in America.

==Relics==
Her alleged skull is displayed in the east crypt of the Cathedral of Trier, in Germany. Portions of her relics are found at the basilica of Santa Maria in Ara Coeli in Rome, the Église Saint-Leu-Saint-Gilles in Paris, and at the Abbaye Saint-Pierre d&#x27;Hautvillers.

The church of Sant&#x27;Elena in Venice claims to have the complete body of the saint enshrined under the main altar. In 1517, the English priest, Richard Torkington, having seen the relics during a visit to Venice described them as follows: &quot;&quot; In an ecumenical gesture, these relics visited the Orthodox Church of Greece and were displayed in the church of Agia Varvara (Saint Barbara) in Athens from 14 May to 15 June 2017.

== Later cultural traditions ==
=== In British folklore ===
In Great Britain, later legend, mentioned by Henry of Huntingdon but made popular by Geoffrey of Monmouth, claimed that Helena was a daughter of the King of Britain, Cole of Colchester, who allied with Constantius to avoid more war between the Britons and Rome. Geoffrey further states that she was brought up in the manner of a queen, as she had no brothers to inherit the throne of Britain. The source for this may have been Sozomen&#x27;s &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot;, which, however, does not claim Helena was British but only that her son Constantine picked up his Christianity there. Constantine was with his father when he died in York, but neither had spent much time in Britain.

The statement made by English chroniclers of the Middle Ages, according to which Helena was supposed to have been the daughter of a British prince, is entirely without historical foundation. It may arise from the similarly named Welsh princess Saint Elen (alleged to have married Magnus Maximus and to have borne a son named Constantine) or from the misinterpretation of a term used in the fourth chapter of the panegyric on Constantine&#x27;s marriage with Fausta. The description of Constantine honoring Britain &quot;oriendo&quot; ( &quot;from the outset&quot;, &quot;from the beginning&quot;) may have been taken as an allusion to his birth (&quot;from &quot;his&quot; beginning&quot;) although it was actually discussing the beginning of his reign.

At least twenty-five holy wells currently exist in the United Kingdom dedicated to a Saint Helen. She is also the patron saint of Abingdon and Colchester. St Helen&#x27;s Chapel in Colchester was believed to have been founded by Helena herself, and since the 15th century, the town&#x27;s coat of arms has shown a representation of the True Cross and three crowned nails in her honour. Colchester Town Hall has a Victorian statue of the saint on top of its tower. The arms of Nottingham are almost identical because of the city&#x27;s connection with Cole, her supposed father.

=== Filipino legend and tradition ===
Flores de Mayo honors her and her son Constantine for finding the True Cross with a parade with floral and fluvial themed parade showcasing her, Constantine and other people who followed her journey to find the True Cross. Her discovery of the Cross along with Constantine is dramatised in the &quot;Santacruzan&quot;, a ritual pageant in the Philippines. Held in May (when Roodmas was once celebrated), the procession also bears elements of the month&#x27;s Marian devotions. A &quot;Santacruzan&quot; procession is also held by the Filipino community of Jersey City, New Jersey.

=== Medieval legend and fiction ===
In medieval legend and chivalric romance, Helena appears as a persecuted heroine, in the vein of such women as &quot;Emaré&quot; and &quot;Constance&quot;; separated from her husband, she lives a quiet life, supporting herself on her embroidery, until such time as her son&#x27;s charm and grace wins her husband&#x27;s attention and so the revelation of their identities.

=== Modern fiction ===
Helena is the protagonist of Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s 1950 novel &quot;Helena&quot;. She is also the main character of &quot;Priestess of Avalon&quot; (2000), a fantasy novel by Marion Zimmer Bradley and Diana L. Paxson. She is given the name Eilan and depicted as a trained priestess of Avalon.

Helena is also the protagonist of Louis de Wohl&#x27;s novel &quot;The Living Wood&quot; (1947) in which she is again the daughter of King Coel of Colchester. In the 2021 novel Eagle Ascending by Dan Whitfield she is depicted as having lived to age 118 as result of the powers of the True Cross.

<text>Gaius Pescennius Niger (c. 135 – 194) was a Roman usurper from 193 to 194 during the Year of the Five Emperors. He claimed the imperial throne in response to the murder of Pertinax and the elevation of Didius Julianus, but was defeated by a rival claimant, Septimius Severus, and killed while attempting to flee from Antioch.

==Early life==
According to &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, Niger&#x27;s parents were Annius Fuscus and Lampridia. It also states that his grandfather was a supervisor of Aquinum. He may have had a brother named Publius Pescennius Niger who is recorded in an inscription to have been a member of the Arval Brethren in AD 183, during the reign of Commodus.

==Early career==

Although Niger was born into an old Italian equestrian family, around the year 135, he was the first member of his family to achieve the rank of Roman senator. Not much is known of his early career; it is possible that he held an administrative position in Egypt, and that he served in a military campaign in Dacia early in Commodus’ reign. During the late 180s, Niger was elected as a Suffect consul, after which Commodus made him imperial legate of Syria in 191.

He was still serving in Syria when news came of the murder of Pertinax, followed by the auctioning off of the imperial title to Didius Julianus. Niger was a well regarded public figure in Rome and soon a popular demonstration against Didius Julianus broke out, during which the citizens called out for Niger to come to Rome and claim the imperial title for himself. As a consequence, it is alleged that Julianus dispatched a centurion to the east with orders to assassinate Niger at Antioch.

The result of the unrest in Rome saw Niger proclaimed Emperor by the eastern legions by the end of April 193. On his accession, Niger took the additional cognomen &quot;Justus&quot;, or &quot;the Just&quot;. Although imperial propaganda issued on behalf of Septimius Severus later claimed that Niger was the first to rebel against Didius Julianus, it was Severus who persisted, claiming the imperial title on 14 April. Although Niger sent envoys to Rome to announce his elevation to the imperial throne, his messengers were intercepted by Severus. As Niger began bolstering his support in the eastern provinces, Severus marched on Rome which he entered in early June 193 after Julianus had been murdered.

== Septimius Severus and Niger ==

Severus wasted no time consolidating his hold on Rome, and ordered his newly appointed prefect of the watch, Gaius Fulvius Plautianus to capture Niger&#x27;s children and hold them as hostages. Meanwhile, Niger was busy securing the support of all of the governors in the Asiatic provinces, including the esteemed proconsul of Asia, Asellius Aemilianus, who had occupied Byzantium in the name of Niger. He then proceeded to secure direct control over Egypt, while Severus did as much as he could to protect the wheat supply, and ordered troops loyal to him to keep watch on the western border of Egypt and prevent the legion stationed there – Legio II Traiana Fortis – from sending military aid to Niger.

Although the Asiatic provinces contained great wealth, Niger&#x27;s military resources were inferior to Severus’. While Severus had the sixteen Danubian legions at his disposal, Niger possessed only six: three in Syria, the two stationed in Arabia Petraea, and one located at Melitene. Niger therefore decided to act aggressively, and sent a force into Thrace where it defeated a part of Severus’ army under Lucius Fabius Cilo at Perinthus.

Severus then marched from Rome to the east, sending his general Tiberius Claudius Candidus ahead of him. Niger, having made Byzantium his headquarters, gave Asellius Aemilianus the task of defending the southern shore of the Sea of Marmara. As Severus approached, he offered Niger the opportunity to surrender and go into exile, but Niger refused, trusting in the outcome of a military encounter. In the fall of 193, Candidus met Aemilianus in battle at Cyzicus, resulting in Niger&#x27;s forces being defeated as well as the capture and death of Aemilianus. Byzantium was now placed under siege, forcing Niger to abandon the city and retreat to Nicaea. The city remained loyal to Pescennius Niger, and it would take Severus until the end of 195 to finally capture Byzantium.

Another battle took place outside Nicaea in later December 193, which also resulted in a defeat for Niger. Nevertheless, Niger was able to withdraw the bulk of his army intact to the Taurus Mountains, where he held the passes for a few months while he returned to Antioch. However, Niger&#x27;s support in Asia was falling. Some previously loyal cities changed their allegiance, in particular Laodicea and Tyre. By February 13, 194, Egypt had declared for Severus, as had the imperial legate of Arabia, further diminishing Niger&#x27;s chances.

After Severus had replaced Candidus with another general, Publius Cornelius Anullinus, Niger met Anullinus in battle at Issus in May 194, where after a long and hard-fought struggle, Niger was decisively defeated. Forced to retreat to Antioch, Niger was captured while attempting to flee to Parthia. Niger was beheaded, and his severed head was taken to Byzantium, but the city refused to surrender. Eventually, Severus stormed and completely destroyed Byzantium before he had it rebuilt. Niger&#x27;s head eventually found its way to Rome where it was displayed.

The Historia Augusta relates that after his victory in the east, Severus punished Niger&#x27;s supporters. He had Niger&#x27;s wife and children put to death, while his estates were confiscated.`However, according to Roman scholar Geoffrey Turton, Septimius refrained from vindictive reprisals. After Niger&#x27;s death his wife and children served no use as hostages, and were allowed to live in retirement, where it was supposed, they would play no further part in public affairs. Given the unreliability of the Historia Augusta, which often served as a propaganda vehicle for succeeding emperors, this is almost certainly the more likely outcome.

==Name==
The name &quot;Pescennius Niger&quot; means &quot;black Pescennius&quot;, which incidentally contrasts him with one of his rivals for the throne in 194, Clodius Albinus, whose name means &quot;white Clodius&quot;. Cassius Dio&#x27;s &quot;Roman History&quot; reports that, when a priest of Jupiter saw in a dream a &quot;black/dark man&quot; (ἄνθρωποι τὸν μέλανα) breaking into the emperor&#x27;s camp, this was interpreted as referring to Pescennius Niger. 

According to &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, his father had the cognomen &quot;fuscus&quot;, meaning &quot;brown&quot;, and though his body was allegedly white and corpulent, his face was dark red with a very black neck, which was thought &quot;by many men&quot; to have been the origin of his cognomen &quot;Niger&quot;.

==Family==
Pescennius is known to have been married and had children. The names of his children are not mentioned in any sources, nor how many they were. In the past it has been supposed by some historians based on medals bearing the inscription &quot;Pescennia Plautiana Augusta&quot; that Niger was married to a woman named Plautiana or that he had a daughter named Pescennia Plautiana, but the medals are said to be forgeries.

==Popular culture==
In the film &quot;The Fall of The Roman Empire&quot; Niger is played by Douglas Wilmer and depicted as a scheming henchman of Commodus. At the end of the film, Niger and Didius Julianus, played by Eric Porter, another crony of Commodus, compete against each other in the auction for the throne of Rome.

<text>The Battle of Cable Street was a series of clashes that took place at several locations in the East End of London, most notably Cable Street, on Sunday 4 October 1936. It was a clash between the Metropolitan Police, sent to protect a march by members of the British Union of Fascists led by Oswald Mosley, and various anti-fascist demonstrators including local trade unionists, communists, anarchists, British Jews, and socialist groups. The anti-fascist counter-demonstration included both organised and unaffiliated participants.

==Background==
The British Union of Fascists (BUF) had advertised a march to take place on Sunday 4 October 1936, the fourth anniversary of their organisation. Thousands of BUF followers, dressed in their Blackshirt uniform, intended to march through the heart of the East End, an area that then had a large Jewish population.

The BUF planned to march from Tower Hill and divide into four columns, each heading for one of four open-air public meetings where Mosley and other speakers would address gatherings of BUF supporters. The meetings were to be at Limehouse, Bow, Bethnal Green and Hoxton.

The Jewish People&#x27;s Council organised a petition calling for the march to be banned, which gathered the signatures of 100,000 East Londoners, including the Mayors of the five East London Boroughs (Hackney, Shoreditch, Stepney, Bethnal Green and Poplar) in two days. Home Secretary John Simon denied the request to outlaw the march.

==Field of operations==
There are three main routes into the East End from the direction of the City of London. From north to south these are; Bishopsgate, Aldgate (440 metres south-east of Bishopsgate) and Tower Hill (450 metres south of Aldgate). The BUF was to gather its supporters at the southernmost of these three entrances, at Tower Hill and adjacent Royal Mint Street in East Smithfield, at 2:30.

The intention was that Mosley would formally review the assembled force, after which it would march from Tower Hill and divide into four columns, each heading for one of four open-air public meetings where Mosley and other speakers, including William Joyce, John Beckett, Tommy Moran and Alexander Raven Thomson, would address gatherings of BUF supporters: 
* Salmon Lane, Limehouse, at 5pm
* Stafford Road, Bow, at 6pm
* Victoria Park Square, Bethnal Green, at 6pm
* Aske Street, Hoxton, at 6:30pm

In response their opponents, who knew of the intended meetings but not the intended routes from Tower Hill, called on the main mass of their support to gather at the central of East End&#x27;s three entry points, Aldgate, for 2pm. In doing this the crowd could occupy the important road junctions in that area, including Gardiner&#x27;s Corner, the junction of Whitechapel High Street with Leman Street, Commercial Street and Commercial Road. (The junction of Commercial Road and Whitechapel High Street has since moved east by 100 metres.)

The aim of the police was to allow the march to proceed, but as peacefully as possible. The head of the Metropolitan Police, Philip Game, established his HQ at the junction of Mansell and Royal Mint Streets by Tower Hill. There was also a major police station halfway along Leman Street, between Tower Hill and Aldgate.

==Numbers involved==
Very large numbers of people took part in the events, in part due to the good weather, but estimates of the numbers of participants vary enormously:
* Estimates of Fascist participants range from 2,000 to 3,000, up to 5,000. The Fascists had a casualty dressing station at their Tower Hill assembly point.
* There were 6,000–7,000 policemen, including the whole of the Metropolitan Police Mounted Division. The police had wireless vans and a spotter plane sending updates on crowd numbers and movements to Philip Game&#x27;s HQ, at Tower Hill.
* Estimates of the number of anti-fascist counter-demonstrators range from 100,000 to 250,000, 300,000, 310,000, or more. The Independent Labour Party and Communists, like the Fascists, set up medical stations to treat their injured.

==Events==
===Tower Hill===
The fascists were to gather from all over southern England, at and around Tower Hill for 2:30 p.m; the first to arrive did so in a piecemeal fashion from around 1:25 p.m; and were vulnerable to groups of hostile local people, around 500 in total, waiting for them. A party entering Tower Hill from nearby Mark Lane tube station was attacked, as was a group in Mansell Street. The anti-fascists also temporarily occupied the Minories.

The fighting intensified as more BUF members and their opponents arrived, with many BUF arriving in vans whose windows had been reinforced with iron grilles. A private car bearing the slogan &quot;Mosley shall not pass&quot; drove onto Royal Mint Street, veering through the melee. It was attacked by Fascists who police cleared away with a baton charge, the car making its escape.

At 2pm the police began the process of separating the factions, by which time there were already a significant number of injuries including Tommy Moran, who was leading the BUF force until Mosley&#x27;s later arrival.

There was fierce fighting as police then moved on the counter-protesters to clear the crossroads where Royal Mint Street, Leman Street, Dock Street and Cable Street meet. The counter-protesters were moved onto these neighbouring streets, including a large number forced into Dock Street.

===Aldgate and its approaches===
The largest confrontation took place around Aldgate, where the conflict was between those seeking to block the BUF march, and the Metropolitan Police who were trying to clear a route for the march to proceed along. The streets around Aldgate were broad, and impossible to effectively barricade except by blocking them with large crowds of determined people. These efforts were helped when a number of tram cars were abandoned in the road by their drivers, possibly deliberately.

Dense crowds gathered from Aldgate Pump, along Aldgate High Street and Whitechapel High Street to St Mary Matfelon Church (now Altab Ali Park) and some way along Whitechapel Road. The adjacent side streets, most notably Minories and Leman Street, which led from Tower Hill to Aldgate, also became congested. The greatest concentration of people was at Gardiner&#x27;s Corner, the junction of Whitechapel High Street with Leman Street, Commercial Street and Commercial Road.

The public were requested to gather in the area at 2pm, but people began arriving long before then. At 11:30, a column of the largely Jewish Ex-Servicemen&#x27;s Movement Against Fascism marched along Whitechapel Road, wearing their WWI medals and carrying their Royal British Legion standard before them. On finding their progress to Aldgate blocked by police they demanded the right to march on the streets of their own borough, the same right granted to the fascists who were heading to the area. They were attacked by mounted police, and in the ensuing fighting the police captured their standard, tore it to pieces and smashed the flag pole to pieces.

By 1:30 Aldgate, and in particular Gardiner&#x27;s Corner, was solidly blocked by a mass of people who had already endured a series of baton and mounted charges by police. The police continued to try to secure a route through Gardiner&#x27;s Corner, but also tried to secure alternative routes that the BUF marchers might resort to instead.

At around 1:40 a large group broke off from the main body and headed into the Minories which leads to Tower Hill. At around 2:15 individuals were making their way through the Aldgate crowds shouting &quot;All to Cable Street&quot;, encouraging people to join the defence of the Cable Street/Leman Street junction near Tower Hill.

Although some counter-protesters had headed to Cable Street, large numbers remained around Aldgate, and the police continued their attempts to clear a route. One of the main organisers of the counter-protest, Fenner Brockway, Secretary of the Independent Labour Party, who had already been injured by a police baton, decided to try to contact the Home Secretary, John Simon.

Just after 3pm Brockway found a phone box on Whitechapel Road and called the Home Office; the Home Secretary wasn&#x27;t available so Brockway appraised a civil servant of the serious ongoing violence:

The official assured Brockway the message would be passed on. It is not known whether this actually happened, or whether it contributed to the decision by the authorities, soon after, to ban the march.

===Cable Street===
Protesters built a number of barricades on narrow Cable Street and its side streets. The main barricade was by the junction with Christian Street, about 300 metres along Cable Street in the St George in the East area of Wapping. Just west of the main barricade, another barricade was erected on Back Church Lane; the barrier was erected under the railway bridge, just north of the junction with Cable Street.

The police attempts to take and remove the barricades were resisted in hand-to-hand fighting and also by missiles, including rubbish, rotten vegetables and the contents of chamber pots thrown at the police by women in houses along the street.

===Decision at Tower Hill===
Mosley arrived in an open-topped black sports car, escorted by Blackshirt motorcyclists, just before 3:30. By this time, his force had formed up in Royal Mint Street and neighbouring streets into a column nearly half a mile long, and was ready to proceed.

However, the police, fearing more severe disorder if the march and meetings went ahead, instructed Mosley to leave the East End, though the BUF were permitted to march in the West End instead. The BUF event finished in Hyde Park.

===Arrests===
About 150 demonstrators were arrested, with the majority of them being anti-fascists, although some escaped with the help of other demonstrators. Around 175 people were injured including police, women and children.

==Aftermath==
The anti-fascists celebrated the community&#x27;s united response, in which large numbers of East-Enders of all backgrounds; Protestants, Catholics and Jews successfully resisted Mosley and his followers. There were few Muslims in London at the time, so organisers were also delighted when Muslim Somali seamen joined the anti-fascist crowds.

The event is frequently cited by modern Antifa movements as &quot;...the moment at which British fascism was decisively defeated&quot;. The Fascists presented themselves as the law-abiding party who were denied free speech by a weak government and police force in the face of mob violence. Many of the arrested demonstrators reported harsh treatment at the hands of the police.

Following the battle, the Public Order Act 1936 outlawed the wearing of political uniforms and required organisers of large meetings and demonstrations to obtain police permission.

Mosley subsequently held a series of rallies around London, and the BUF increased its membership in the capital city, although their activity in Britain was severely limited.

==Notable participants==

* Oswald Mosley
* Tommy Moran

===Metropolitan Police===
* Philip Game

Many leading British communists were present at the Battle of Cable Street, some of whom partially credited the battle for shaping their political beliefs. Some examples include:
* Phil Piratin, member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB).
* Bill Alexander; communist (CPGB member) and the commander of the International Brigade&#x27;s British Battalion.
* Fenner Brockway, Secretary of the Independent Labour Party.

==Commemoration==
Between 1979 and 1983, a large mural depicting the battle was painted on the side of St George&#x27;s Town Hall. It stands in Cable Street, about 350 metres east of the main barricade that stood by the junction with &quot;Christian Street&quot;. Commissioned soon after the 40th anniversary of the battle, the Cable Street Mural is the collective work of four artists: David Binnington, Paul Butler, Desmond Rochfort, and Ray Walker.

A red plaque in &quot;Dock Street&quot; (just south of the Royal Mint Street, Leman Street, Cable Street, Dock Street junction) also commemorates the confrontation.

Numerous events were planned in East London for the battle&#x27;s 75th anniversary in October 2011, including music and a march, and the mural was restored. In 2016, to mark the battle&#x27;s 80th anniversary, a march took place from Altab Ali Park to Cable Street, attended by some of those who were originally involved.

<text>John Patrick O&#x27;Neill (February 6, 1952September 11, 2001) was an American counter-terrorism expert who worked as a special agent and eventually a special agent in charge in the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 1995, O&#x27;Neill began to intensely study the roots of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing after he assisted in the capture of Ramzi Yousef, who was the leader of that plot.

He subsequently learned of al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, and investigated the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia and the 2000 USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing in Yemen. Partly due to personal friction he had within the FBI and federal government, O&#x27;Neill left the Bureau in August 2001. He became the head of security at the World Trade Center, where he died at age 49 while helping others to evacuate the South Tower during the September 11 attacks. O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s life has been featured in a number of documentaries and books.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Neill was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on February 6, 1952. As a child, his favorite television show was &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;, a crime drama based around true cases the bureau had handled. In 1971, after graduating from Holy Spirit High School, he enrolled at American University in Washington, D.C. While there, O&#x27;Neill also started working at the FBI&#x27;s Washington headquarters, first as a fingerprint clerk and later as a tour guide. He graduated with a degree in administration of justice from American University in 1974 and later obtained a master&#x27;s degree in forensics from George Washington University.

==Career==
===1976–1995===
The FBI hired O&#x27;Neill as an agent in 1976. Over the next 15 years, he worked on issues such as white-collar crime, organized crime, and foreign counterintelligence while based at the Washington bureau. In 1991, he received an important promotion and was moved to the FBI&#x27;s Chicago field office, where he was Assistant Special Agent in Charge. While there, he established the Fugitive Task Force in an effort to promote inter-agency cooperation and enhance ties between the FBI and local law enforcement. In 1994, O&#x27;Neill also became supervisor of VAPCON, a task force investigating abortion clinic bombings.

===1995–1999===
In 1995, he returned to the FBI&#x27;s Washington, D.C., headquarters and became chief of the counter-terrorism section. On his first day, he received a call from his friend Richard Clarke, who had just learned that Ramzi Yousef had been located in Pakistan. O&#x27;Neill worked continuously over the next few days to gather information and coordinate the successful capture and extradition of Yousef. Intrigued by the case, O&#x27;Neill continued to study the 1993 World Trade Center bombing that Yousef had masterminded and other information about Islamic militants. He was directly involved in the investigation into the June 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, which took place during a retreat O&#x27;Neill had organized in Quantico for FBI and CIA counter-terrorism agents. Frustrated by the level of cooperation from the Saudis, O&#x27;Neill purportedly vented to FBI Director Louis Freeh, saying they were &quot;blowing smoke up your ass,&quot; although Freeh later denied this, claiming they had an excellent relationship.

In 1996 and 1997, O&#x27;Neill continued to warn of growing threats of terrorism, saying that modern groups are not supported by governments and that there are terrorist cells operating within the United States. He stated that veterans of the insurgency by Afghan rebels against the Soviet Union&#x27;s invasion in the 1980s had become a major threat. In January 1997, he moved to New York City to be Special Agent in Charge of the FBI&#x27;s National Security Division, the FBI&#x27;s &quot;largest and most prestigious field office.&quot;

By 1998, O&#x27;Neill had become focused on Osama bin Laden and created an al-Qaeda desk in his division. In August 1998, two United States embassies were bombed in quick succession in simultaneous attacks in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. O&#x27;Neill hoped to be involved in the investigation because he had gained a tremendous knowledge of Osama bin Laden&#x27;s al-Qaeda terrorist network. He persuaded FBI Director Freeh to let his office handle the case, and prosecutor Mary Jo White later said, &quot;John O&#x27;Neill, in the investigation of the bombings of our embassies in East Africa, created the template for successful investigations of international terrorism around the world.&quot;

When his friend Chris Isham, a producer for ABC News, arranged for an interview between bin Laden and correspondent John Miller, Isham and Miller used information put together by O&#x27;Neill to formulate the questions. After the interview aired, O&#x27;Neill pushed Isham hard to release an unedited version so he could carefully dissect it.

O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s rise through the ranks at the bureau began to slow as his personal style chafed others, and he made a few slip-ups by losing a bureau cell phone and PalmPilot, improperly borrowing a car from a safe house, and losing track of a briefcase with sensitive documents for a short period.

He was a Catholic, married with two children, but separated from his wife; his family continued to live in Atlantic City, and he supported them financially and paid the mortgage on their house. According to Lawrence Wright in &quot;The Looming Tower&quot;, O&#x27;Neill was involved simultaneously in extramarital relationships with three named women during the 1990s, each of whom he had told either that he was not married or that he was divorced, and that he planned to marry her.

He was officially reprimanded and docked 15 days&#x27; pay in summer 1999 over the incident involving the safe house because he had allowed his girlfriend to enter it. His lifestyle, which involved frequently giving gifts to his girlfriends and lavish expenditures with his colleagues, resulted in substantial credit card debts which he found difficult to manage on his salary, and consequently, he borrowed substantial sums from wealthy friends.

In 1999, O&#x27;Neill sent a close associate named Mark Rossini to work in the CIA&#x27;s Bin Laden Issue Station in Virginia. O&#x27;Neill had a conflict with CIA station chief Michael Scheuer: O&#x27;Neill wanted Rossini to stay at the station and feed him information about what the CIA was doing, while Rich Blee, who had been appointed by CIA chief George Tenet to head of the Bin Laden Issue Station, wanted Rossini out working in the field. Later, when the Bin Laden Issue Station learned that bin Laden&#x27;s associates Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar were headed to the US with visas, Rossini and his colleague Doug Miller attempted to alert O&#x27;Neill, but CIA agent Alfreda Bikowsky allegedly blocked the message. Mihdhar and Hazmi became two of the hijackers of American Airlines Flight 77 on 9/11.

Following the December 1999 arrest of Ahmed Ressam, O&#x27;Neill coordinated the investigation into the 2000 millennium attack plots, described by Richard Clarke as &quot;the most comprehensive investigation ever conducted before September 11th.&quot; O&#x27;Neill has been described as having a close working relationship with Ali Soufan.

===2000===
After being passed over for multiple promotions (to assistant director in charge of national security in 1999 and to head of the FBI&#x27;s New York office in early 2000), O&#x27;Neill was pleased to be assigned as commander of the FBI&#x27;s investigation into the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing in October 2000. However, upon arriving in Yemen, he complained about inadequate security. As his team investigated, O&#x27;Neill came into conflict with Barbara Bodine, the U.S. ambassador to Yemen. The two had widely divergent views on how to handle searches of Yemeni property, and interviews with citizens and government officials, and they only grew further apart as time progressed.

After two months in Yemen, O&#x27;Neill returned to New York. He hoped to go back to Yemen to continue the investigation, but was blocked by Bodine and others; the dispute made the US press. Following threats against the remaining FBI investigators, FBI Director Freeh withdrew the team, on O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s recommendation, in June 2001.

===Retirement===

In early 2001, Richard A. Clarke, the National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-terrorism wanted to move to another position; he insisted O&#x27;Neill was the best person to replace him. O&#x27;Neill proved reluctant, not least because of the relatively low salary. When O&#x27;Neill heard of upcoming leaks to &quot;The New York Times&quot; about the May 2000 incident in which his briefcase had been stolen, he decided to retire from the bureau and take a higher-paying job in the private sector, as chief of security at the World Trade Center.

An August 19, 2001, &quot;The New York Times&quot; report by James Risen and David Johnston suggested that O&#x27;Neill had been the subject of an &quot;internal investigation&quot; at the FBI because O&#x27;Neill was responsible for losing a briefcase with &quot;highly classified information&quot; in it, including among other things &quot;a description of every counterespionage and counterterrorism program in New York.&quot; The briefcase was recovered shortly after its disappearance.

The FBI investigation was reported to have concluded that the briefcase had been snatched by local thieves involved in a series of hotel burglaries and that none of the documents inside had been removed or even touched. Several people came to O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s defense, suggesting that he was the subject of a &quot;smear campaign&quot;. One of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s associates later claimed that O&#x27;Neill believed the source for the &quot;Times&quot; story was FBI official Thomas J. Pickard. The &quot;Times&quot; reported that O&#x27;Neill was expected to retire in late August.

O&#x27;Neill started his new job at the World Trade Center on August 23, 2001. In late August, he talked to his friend Chris Isham about the job. Jokingly, Isham said, &quot;At least they&#x27;re not going to bomb it again&quot;, a reference to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. O&#x27;Neill replied, &quot;They&#x27;ll probably try to finish the job.&quot;

==Death==

O&#x27;Neill was killed on September 11, 2001, in the collapse of the World Trade Center towers. Wesley Wong, an FBI agent who had known O&#x27;Neill for more than twenty years, and was in the command center with O&#x27;Neill that had been set up following the North Tower crash, last saw O&#x27;Neill walking toward a tunnel leading to the South Tower, likely to assist in that building&#x27;s evacuation and gather surveillance footage from the security offices located there. O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s body was recovered from the debris of the South Tower on September 21.

O&#x27;Neill is buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in Mays Landing, New Jersey. At the National 9/11 Memorial, O&#x27;Neill is memorialized at the North Pool, on Panel N-63.

==Media==
O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s counter-terrorism work at the FBI as well as insights into his character and private life have been extensively detailed in books and documentaries about the lead-up to the September 11 attacks, including the following:

<text>The Terracotta Army is a collection of terracotta sculptures depicting the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China. It is a form of funerary art buried with the emperor in 210–209 BCE with the purpose of protecting him in his afterlife.

The figures, dating from approximately the late 200s BCE, were discovered in 1974 by local farmers in Lintong County, outside Xi&#x27;an, Shaanxi, China. The figures vary in height according to their rank, the tallest being the generals. The figures include warriors, chariots and horses. Estimates from 2007 were that the three pits containing the Terracotta Army hold more than 8,000 soldiers, 130 chariots with 520 horses, and 150 cavalry horses, the majority of which remain &quot;in situ&quot; in the pits near Qin Shi Huang&#x27;s mausoleum. Other, non-military terracotta figures have since been found in other pits, including those of officials, acrobats, strongmen, and musicians.
== History ==
The construction of the tomb was described by the historian Sima Qian (14590 BCE) in the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, the first of China&#x27;s 24 dynastic histories, which was written a century after the mausoleum&#x27;s completion. Work on the mausoleum began in 246 BCE, soon after Emperor Qin (then aged 13) succeeded his father as King of Qin, and Sima said that the project eventually involved 700,000 conscripted workers. Geographer Li Daoyuan, writing six centuries after the first emperor&#x27;s death, recorded in &quot;Shui Jing Zhu&quot; that Mount Li was a favoured location due to its auspicious geology: &quot;famed for its jade mines, its northern side was rich in gold, and its southern side rich in beautiful jade; the first emperor, covetous of its fine reputation, therefore chose to be buried there&quot;.

Sima Qian wrote that the first emperor was buried with palaces, towers, officials, valuable artifacts and wondrous objects. According to this famous account, 100 flowing rivers were simulated using mercury, and above them the ceiling was decorated with heavenly bodies, below which lay the features of the lands of China which the emperor had unified. Some translations of this passage refer to &quot;models&quot; or &quot;imitations&quot;; however, those words were not used in the original text, which also makes no mention of the terracotta army. Although these elements of Sima Qian&#x27;s account on the structure of the mausoleum have been seen as credulous in pre-modern assessments, the detection of high levels of mercury that were found in the soil of the tomb mound following the discovery of the mausoleum site have since given credence to Sima Qian&#x27;s account. Additionally, the Emperor is well documented for building monumental statues in human form during his reign, such as the &quot;Twelve Metal Colossi,&quot; which were a series of contemporaneous statues that are now lost but have been noted in historical records.

Later historical accounts have suggested that the mausoleum complex and tomb itself had been looted by Xiang Yu, a contender for the throne after the death of the first emperor. However, there are indications that the tomb itself may not have been plundered.

=== Discovery ===
 was discovered on 29 March 1974 by a group of farmers—Yang Zhifa, his five brothers, and neighbour Wang Puzhi—who were digging a well approximately east of the Qin Emperor&#x27;s tomb mound at Mount Li (Lishan), a region riddled with underground springs and watercourses. For centuries, occasional reports mentioned pieces of terracotta figures and fragments of the Qin necropolis – roofing tiles, bricks and chunks of masonry. This discovery prompted Chinese archaeologists, including Zhao Kangmin, to investigate, revealing the largest pottery figurine group ever found. A museum complex has since been constructed over the area, the largest pit being enclosed by a roofed structure.

== Necropolis ==

The Terracotta Army is part of a much larger necropolis. Ground-penetrating radar and core sampling have measured the area to be approximately 98 square kilometers (38 square miles).

The necropolis was constructed as a microcosm of the emperor&#x27;s imperial palace or compound, and covers a large area around the tomb mound of the first emperor. The earthen tomb mound is located at the foot of Mount Li and built in a pyramidal shape, and is surrounded by two solidly built rammed earth walls with gateway entrances. The necropolis consists of several offices, halls, stables, other structures as well as an imperial park placed around the tomb mound.

The warriors stand guard to the east of the tomb. Up to of reddish, sandy soil had accumulated over the site in the two millennia following its construction, but archaeologists found evidence of earlier disturbances at the site. During the excavations near the Mount Li burial mound, archaeologists found several graves dating from the 18th and 19th centuries, where diggers had apparently struck terracotta fragments. These were discarded as worthless and used along with soil to backfill the excavations.

=== Tomb ===
The tomb appears to be a hermetically sealed space approximately . The tomb remains unopened, possibly due to concerns over preservation of its artifacts. For example, after the excavation of the Terracotta Army, the painted surface present on some terracotta figures began to flake and fade. The lacquer covering the paint can curl in fifteen seconds once exposed to Xi&#x27;an&#x27;s dry air and can flake off in just four minutes.

== Excavation site ==
=== Pits ===
Four main pits approximately deep have since been uncovered in the site excavations. These are located approximately east of the burial mound. The soldiers within were laid out as if to protect the tomb from the east, where the Qin Emperor&#x27;s conquered states lay, and were discovered 7 m below the excavation level.

====Pit 1====
Pit 1, which is long and wide, contains the main army of more than 3,000 figures. It is the largest of the four pits and has eleven parallel corridors, most more than wide and paved with small bricks with a wooden ceiling supported by large beams and posts. This design was also used for the tombs of nobles and would have resembled palace hallways when built. The wooden ceilings were covered with reed mats and layers of clay for waterproofing, and then mounded with more soil raising them about above the surrounding ground level when completed.

==== Others ====

Pit 2 has cavalry and infantry units as well as war chariots and is thought to represent a military guard. Pit 3 is the command post, with high-ranking officers and a war chariot. Pit 4 is empty, perhaps left unfinished by its builders.

Some of the figures in Pits 1 and 2 show fire damage, while remains of burnt ceiling rafters have also been found. These, together with the missing weapons, have been taken as evidence of the reported looting by Xiang Yu and the subsequent burning of the site, which is thought to have caused the roof to collapse and crush the army figures below. The terracotta figures currently on display have been restored from the fragments.

Other pits that formed the necropolis have also been excavated. These pits lie within and outside the walls surrounding the tomb mound. They variously contain bronze carriages, terracotta figures of entertainers such as acrobats and strongmen, officials, stone armour suits, burial sites of horses, rare animals and labourers, as well as bronze cranes and ducks set in an underground park.

== Warrior figures ==

===Types and appearance===
==== The warriors ====
The terracotta figures are life-sized, typically ranging from to about (the officers are typically taller). They vary in height, uniform, and hairstyle in accordance with their portrayed rank. Their faces appear to be different for each individual figure, scholars have identified 10 base facial forms which were then further developed to give each figure individuality in terms of facial morphology. The figures are of these general types: armored infantry; unarmored infantry; cavalrymen who wear a pillbox hat; helmeted drivers of chariots with more armor protection; spear-carrying charioteers; kneeling crossbowmen or archers who are armored; standing archers who are not; as well as generals and other lower-ranking officers. There are, however, many variations in the uniforms within the ranks: for example, some may wear shin pads while others not; they may wear either long or short trousers, some of which may be padded; and their body armors vary depending on rank, function, and position in formation. There are also terracotta horses placed among the warrior figures.

Originally, the figures were painted with ground precious stones, intensely fired bones (white), pigments of iron oxide (dark red), cinnabar (red), malachite (green), azurite (blue), charcoal (black), cinnabar barium copper silicate mix (Chinese purple or Han purple), tree sap from a nearby source (more than likely from the Chinese lacquer tree) (brown), and other colors including pink, lilac, red, white, and one unidentified color. The colored lacquer finish and individual facial features would have given the figures a realistic feel, with eyebrows and facial hair in black and the faces done in pink.

However, in Xi&#x27;an&#x27;s dry climate, much of the color coating would flake off in less than four minutes after removing the mud surrounding the army.

====The acrobats====

Excavations in Pit K9901 have uncovered in 1999 a series of associated terracotta sculptures that have been dubbed &quot;The Acrobats&quot;, which have been remarked to display an advanced understanding of human anatomy. The original function of these statues remains unclear, but they have been described as either potentially acrobat or dancer figures. The number of these figures uncovered thus far are relatively few compared to the more noted warrior figures, with the total discovered probably numbering a dozen. The figures are bare with the exception of a loincloth as dress. These figures are very vivid and less stereotypical than the soldiers, especially through the dynamic treatment of the musculature and bone joints. Some of the men are very lean, while others have massive bodies. Several of them are shown in the process of moving or making gestures. These terracotta statues demonstrate an advanced mastery of the depiction of the shapes and proportions of the human body.

Eleven of such figurines from Pit K9901 have since been subsequently unearthed with seven of them found in a degree of preservation that made them capable of being largely reconstructed from their fragment shards.
==== Speculations on possible influences ====
Since the time of their discovery, the figures have been noted for their exceptional stylistic realism and individualism, with assessments having found that no two figures share the exact same features. The earliest note on this aspect was that of 20th century art historian German Hafner who, in 1986, was the first to speculate on a possible Hellenistic link to these sculptures due to the unusual display of naturalism relative to general Qin era sculpture: &quot;the art of the terracotta army originated from Western contact&quot;. This idea was also generally supported by Duan Qingbo, site chief archaeologist from 1998 to 2006, though noting that &quot;the only thing&quot; in extant archaeology which may hold a close similarity to the figures in terms of their artistic style is that of the later 1st century BCE Central Asian Khalchayan statuary. Li Xiuzhen, senior site archaeologist, also acknowledged the possibility of Hellenistic influences, stating: &quot;we now think the Terracotta Army, the acrobats and the bronze sculptures found on site were inspired by ancient Greek sculptures and art.&quot; She later also asserted ultimate Chinese authorship: &quot;the terracotta warriors may be inspired by Western culture, but were uniquely made by the Chinese.&quot;

Others have argued that such speculations rest on flawed and old Eurocentric ideas that assumed other civilizations were incapable of sophisticated artistry and thus foreign artistry must be seen through Western traditions, with site archaeologist Zhang Weixing stating that &quot;there is no substantial evidence at all&quot; for any such linkage. Raoul McLaughlin, an independent researcher on Roman trade, stated that there is no Greek influence on the Terracotta Army and emphasized the differences in artisanship, construction material, and symbology. Darryl Wilkinson of Dartmouth College has instead argued that the Qin era display of sculptural naturalism, alongside that of the pre-Columbian Moche culture in Peru, indicate that &quot;the Greeks did not invent naturalism&quot; and that &quot;sculptural naturalism is not the product of any one culture&#x27;s civilizational &#x27;genius.

===Construction===

The terracotta army figures were manufactured in workshops by government laborers and local craftsmen using local materials. Heads, arms, legs, and torsos were created separately and then assembled by luting the pieces together. When completed, the terracotta figures were placed in the pits in precise military formation according to rank and duty. In 2021, morphological studies have shown that there is a strong resemblance between the statues and that of the local region&#x27;s modern inhabitants, which has led some scholars to theorize that the high level of stylistic realism stems from the figures being modelled on actual soldiers. The faces were created using molds, and at least ten face molds may have been used. Clay was then added after assembly to provide individual facial features to make each figure appear different. It is believed that the warriors&#x27; legs were made in much the same way that terracotta drainage pipes were manufactured at the time. This would classify the process as assembly line production, with specific parts manufactured and assembled after being fired, as opposed to crafting a figure as one solid piece and subsequently firing it. In those times of tight imperial control, each workshop was required to inscribe its name on items produced to ensure quality control. This has aided modern historians in verifying which workshops were commandeered to make tiles and other mundane items for the terracotta army.

====Mass grave pit of the Necropolis workers====
A grave pit was discovered and excavated in 2003 with 121 skeletons retrieved which has been identified by scholars to be attributable to the site workers. The individuals have been assessed to be predominantly from the age range of 15 to 40 years old, with an average height of around 1.7 meters. Many studies have concentrated on analyzing these workers including craniometric as well as genetic studies, which were conducted to try to understand the workers&#x27; origins. According to Duan Qingbo, lead archaeologist and Director of Excavations at the Mausoleum from 1998 to 2006, DNA analysis work on a group of 19 skeletons, in comparison with 33 contemporary Chinese individuals, showed that the workers and laborers analyzed exhibited a diverse range of ethnicities, traceable to that of both Han and minority ethnicities, with a particular concentration of individuals from southern China.

=== Weaponry ===


Most of the figures originally held real weapons, which would have increased their realism. The majority of these weapons were looted shortly after the creation of the army or have rotted away. Despite this, over 40,000 bronze items of weaponry have been recovered, including swords, daggers, spears, lances, battle-axes, scimitars, shields, crossbows, and crossbow triggers. Most of the recovered items are arrowheads, which are usually found in bundles of 100 units. Studies of these arrowheads suggest that they were produced by self-sufficient, autonomous workshops using a process referred to as &quot;cellular production&quot; or &quot;Toyotism&quot;. Some weapons were coated with a 10–15 micrometer layer of chromium dioxide before burial that was believed to have protected them from any form of decay for the last 2200 years. However, research in 2019 indicated that the chromium was merely contamination from nearby lacquer, not a means of protecting the weapons. The slightly alkaline pH and small particle size of the burial soil most likely preserved the weapons.

The swords contain an alloy of copper, tin, and other elements including nickel, magnesium, and cobalt. Some carry inscriptions that date their manufacture to between 245 and 228 BCE, indicating that they were used before burial.

===Precedents and legacy===

Only very few figurines are known from before the time of the terracotta army, so that the humanistic and animalistic style may have appeared dramatically new to their contemporaries. In extant archaeology, only rare and very small terracotta warrior figurines are known from the end of the Zhou dynasty in 4th-3rd century BCE, such as the &quot;Taerpo horserider&quot;, the first known representation of a cavalryman in China, from a military tomb in the Taerpo cemetery near Xianyang (Qin state of the Warring States period). The rider wears Central Asian, Scythian-style clothing, and his high pointed nose suggests he is a foreigner, but these early statuettes have been argued to lack the naturalistic and realistic quality of the Qin terracota army.

The terracotta army left a legacy however, as funeral terracotta armies are known from later dynasties, although in a less stern and militaristic style, and with much smaller statuettes, such as the Western Han Yangjiawan terracotta army (195 BCE) or Yangling terracotta army (141 BCE). The human-sized monumental style of the Qin emperor has thus been observed by scholars to be a relatively short-lived artistic phase which would not reappear until the 4-6th centuries CE with the onset of monumental Buddhist sculpture in China.

== Scientific research ==

In 2007, scientists at Stanford University and the Advanced Light Source facility in Berkeley, California, reported that powder diffraction experiments combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and micro-X-ray fluorescence analysis showed that the process of producing terracotta figures colored with Chinese purple dye consisting of barium copper silicate was derived from the knowledge gained by Taoist alchemists in their attempts to synthesize jade ornaments.

Since 2006, an international team of researchers at the UCL Institute of Archaeology have been using analytical chemistry techniques to uncover more details about the production techniques employed in the creation of the Terracotta Army. Using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry of 40,000 bronze arrowheads bundled in groups of 100, the researchers reported that the arrowheads within a single bundle formed a relatively tight cluster that was different from other bundles. In addition, the presence or absence of metallic impurities was consistent within bundles. Based on the arrows&#x27; chemical compositions, the researchers concluded that a cellular manufacturing system similar to the one used in a modern Toyota factory, as opposed to a continuous assembly line in the early days of the automobile industry, was employed.

Grinding and polishing marks visible under a scanning electron microscope have provided evidence for the earliest industrial use of lathes for polishing.

According to a 2022 study, there is statistically no difference between the facial features of terracotta warriors and contemporary Chinese populations, particularly northern and western Chinese populations. However, the issue of terrocotta warriors being potentially deformed and Chinese populations undergoing changes in their facial features due to climate change and dietary factors were not addressed.

== Exhibitions ==
The first exhibition of the figures outside of China was held at the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) in Melbourne, Australia in 1982.

A collection of 120 objects from the mausoleum and 12 terracotta warriors were displayed at the British Museum in London as its special exhibition &quot;The First Emperor: China&#x27;s Terracotta Army&quot; from 13 September 2007 to April 2008. This exhibition made 2008 the British Museum&#x27;s most successful year and made the British Museum the United Kingdom&#x27;s top cultural attraction between 2007 and 2008. The exhibition brought the most visitors to the museum since the King Tutankhamun exhibition in 1972. It was reported that the 400,000 advance tickets sold out so fast that the museum extended its opening hours until midnight. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, many people had to be turned away, despite the extended hours. During the day of events to mark the Chinese New Year, the crush was so intense that the gates to the museum had to be shut. The Terracotta Army has been described as the only other set of historic artifacts (along with the remnants of the wreck of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;) that can draw a crowd by the name alone.
Warriors and other artifacts were exhibited to the public at the &quot;Forum de Barcelona&quot; in Barcelona between 9 May and 26 September 2004. It was their most successful exhibition ever. The same exhibition was presented at the &quot;Fundación Canal de Isabel II&quot; in Madrid between October 2004 and January 2005, their most successful ever. From December 2009 to May 2010, the exhibition was shown in the &quot;Centro Cultural La Moneda&quot; in Santiago de Chile.

The exhibition traveled to North America and visited museums such as the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, Bowers Museum in Santa Ana, California, Houston Museum of Natural Science, High Museum of Art in Atlanta, National Geographic Society Museum in Washington, D.C., and the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. Subsequently, the exhibition traveled to Sweden and was hosted in the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities between 28 August 2010 and 20 January 2011. An exhibition entitled &#x27;The First Emperor – China&#x27;s Entombed Warriors&#x27;, presenting 120 artifacts was hosted at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, between 2 December 2010 and 13 March 2011. An exhibition entitled &quot;L&#x27;Empereur guerrier de Chine et son armée de terre cuite&quot; (&quot;The Warrior-Emperor of China and his terracotta army&quot;), featuring artifacts including statues from the mausoleum, was hosted by the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts from 11 February 2011 to 26 June 2011. In Italy, from July 2008 to 16 November 2008, five of the warriors of the terracotta army were displayed in Turin at the Museum of Antiquities, and from 16 April 2010 to 5 September 2010 nine statues including officials, lancers and an archer were displayed at the Royal Palace in Milan at the exhibition entitled &quot;The Two Empires&quot;.

Soldiers and related items were on display from 15 March 2013 to 17 November 2013, at the Historical Museum of Bern.

Several Terracotta Army figures were on display, along with many other objects, in an exhibit entitled &quot;Age of Empires: Chinese Art of the Qin and Han Dynasties&quot; at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City from 3 April 2017, to 16 July 2017. An exhibition featuring ten Terracotta Army figures and other artifacts, &quot;Terracotta Warriors of the First Emperor,&quot; was on display at the Pacific Science Center in Seattle, Washington, from 8 April 2017 to 4 September 2017 before traveling to The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to be exhibited from 30 September 2017 to 4 March 2018 with the addition of augmented reality.

An exhibition entitled &quot;China&#x27;s First Emperor and the Terracotta Warriors&quot; was at the World Museum in Liverpool from 9 February 2018 to 28 October 2018.

An exhibition tour of 120 real-size replicas of Terracotta statues was displayed in the German cities of Frankfurt am Main, Munich, Oberhof, Berlin (at the Palace of the Republic) and Nuremberg between 2003 and 2004.

<doc id="148655" wikidata="Q23805" url="?curid=148655" title="Delegation pattern">
<text>In software engineering, the delegation pattern is an object-oriented design pattern that allows object composition to achieve the same code reuse as inheritance.

In delegation, an object handles a request by delegating to a second object (the &quot;delegate&quot;). The delegate is a helper object, but &quot;with the original context&quot;. With language-level support for delegation, this is done implicitly by having codice_1 in the delegate refer to the original (sending) object, not the delegate (receiving object). In the delegate pattern, this is instead accomplished by explicitly passing the original object to the delegate, as an argument to a method. &quot;Delegation&quot; is often used loosely to refer to the distinct concept of forwarding, where the sending object simply uses the corresponding member on the receiving object, evaluated in the context of the &quot;receiving&quot; object, not the original object.

This article uses &quot;sending object/receiving object&quot; for the two objects, rather than &quot;receiving object/delegate&quot;, emphasizing which objects send and receive the delegation call, not the original call.

== Definition ==
In the Introduction to Gamma et al. 1994, delegation is defined as:

== Example ==
In the example below (using the Kotlin programming language), the class Window delegates the codice_2 call to its internal Rectangle object (its delegate).

class Rectangle(val width: Int, val height: Int) {
 fun area() = width * height

class Window(val bounds: Rectangle) {
 // Delegation
 fun area() = bounds.area()

== Language support ==
Some languages have special support for delegation built in. For example, in the Kotlin programming language the codice_3 keyword delegates to another object&#x27;s interface:

interface ClosedShape {
 fun area(): Int

class Rectangle(val width: Int, val height: Int) : ClosedShape {
 override fun area() = width * height

// The ClosedShape implementation of Window delegates to that of the Rectangle that is bounds
class Window(private val bounds: Rectangle) : ClosedShape by bounds

<text>Hillsborough Stadium is a football stadium in the area of Owlerton, Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. With a total capacity of 39,732, it has been the home of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club since opening in 1899.

The ground has been substantially re-developed, with new stands on each side and the original South Stand re-built for UEFA Euro 1996. It has two large two-tiered stands and two large single-tiered stands, all of which are covered. All four stands are of a similar capacity, with the South Stand being the largest and the West Stand (usually housing the away supporters) being the smallest.

The ground was the scene of the Hillsborough disaster on 15 April 1989, in which 97 Liverpool fans were crushed to death at an FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest. The subsequent Taylor Report into the disaster led to a series of long-overdue safety improvements at the ground and other large stadiums around the country, including the requirement for clubs in the top two divisions in England to have all-seater stadiums and the withdrawal of perimeter fencing around the pitch; the latter had only been installed a few years prior to the disaster.

The club&#x27;s plans to renovate the stadium and expand the capacity to 44,825 have been approved by Sheffield City Council with the aim of hosting World Cup matches. The playing surface was upgraded in 2015 to the Desso GrassMaster system, including a complete replacement of the under-soil heating and drainage systems, while the scoreboard was replaced by a modern &#x27;big screen&#x27; prior to the 2015–16 season. The stadium previously played host to World Cup and European Championship football in 1966 and 1996, respectively.

The stadium&#x27;s capacity has currently been temporarily reduced to 34,835 on safety grounds, although work is continuing to restore its maximum capacity.

==History==

During the 1898–99 season Sheffield Wednesday were told that the land rented at Olive Grove would be needed for railway expansions. They were allowed to remain there for the rest of that season but had to find a new ground for the next season. Several locations were considered but fell through for various reasons. An alternative was offered by the Midland Railway Company but it did not meet the requirements of the club.

Finally James Willis Dixon of Hillsborough House, owner of the Silversmiths James Dixon &amp; Sons, offered a site at Owlerton, a sparsely populated area of land to the northwest of the city. The land was part of the Hillsborough House estate which was being sold off by the Dixons. It was successfully bought for £5,000 plus costs. The soil was dumped at both ends of the ground to level out the ground which was initially meadowland covered with dandelions. The 2,000 capacity stand at Olive Grove was then transported to the new site and was joined by a newly built 3,000 capacity stand for the start of the next season. The first match to be played was on 2 September 1899 against Chesterfield. The match was kicked off by the Lord Mayor of Sheffield William Clegg, himself a former Wednesday player. It was a Chesterfield player, Herbert Munday, who scored the first goal at the new stadium but Wednesday came back to win the game 5–1. Despite the location of the ground several miles outside the city boundaries and a poor public transport service the new ground averaged 3,000 supporters for the first three months.

===Early years===
The ground was known as the &quot;Owlerton Stadium&quot; until 1914, when it was renamed &quot;Hillsborough&quot; to coincide with a series of ground improvements. The ground took its new name from the newly created parliamentary constituency. The ground proved to be lucky for Wednesday with the first 8 years proving to be their most successful so far. They included their first league wins in the 1902–03 and
1903–04. This was followed by a second FA Cup in 1907.

The first FA Cup semi-final to be held at the stadium was a replay between West Bromwich Albion and Blackburn Rovers on 3 April 1912. A crowd of 20,050 saw an extra time goal give West Brom the win. This was followed by its first international on 10 April 1920. A match between England and Scotland was watched by 25,536. The game ended with England winning 5–4. The following two seasons saw Hillsborough host two more FA Cup semi-finals, both between Preston North End and Tottenham Hotspur. The crowds for these matches were 43,320 and 49,282 respectively. The highest ever attendance was 72,841 on 17 February 1934 for an FA Cup 5th-round game against Manchester City.

After the end of the 1912–13 season a record profit was announced by the club. The money was invested in a replacement for the Olive Grove stand on the south side of the stadium. The banking on the Spion Kop was also increased in size. The new south stand was completed in time for the first round of the FA Cup on 1 October 1913 against Notts County. It cost £18,000 and included 5,600 seats plus terracing at the front. New offices, dressing rooms, refreshment rooms and a billiard room were also part of the new stand. The second round tie went to a replay on 4 February 1914, which was held in front of a record home crowd of 43,000. However the match was remembered for the collapse of the new retaining wall at the Penistone Road end. It caused 70 injuries and caused the match to be suspended while the casualties were taken to the infirmary.

===Postwar===
During the postwar era, Hillsborough rose to be one of the top stadia in the country. It hosted 27 FA Cup semi-finals. In 1966, the stadium was one of the venues for the Football World Cup, hosting first-round matches involving West Germany, Argentina, Switzerland, and Spain, as well as a quarterfinal in which West Germany beat Uruguay 4–0.

Demolition of the North Stand began in 1960 and work began on a new £150,000 stand. The new stand, designed by local firm Husband &amp; Co, was in length. It was only the second stand in the country, after one at Scunthorpe United&#x27;s Old Showground, to be built with a cantilever roof and the first to run the full length of the pitch. It was opened on 23 August 1961 by Stanley Rous, secretary of the Football Association. The 10,008 capacity all-seater stand almost doubled the seating capacity of Hillsborough from 9,000 to 16,000.

The ground held its first national cup final in 1977 when it played host to Everton and Aston Villa for a Football League Cup final replay. A crowd of 52,135 watched a 1–1 draw leading to another replay. At the end of the 1980s, the ground held three successive FA Cup semi-finals, ending with the events that changed the nature of football grounds throughout the country.

===Hillsborough disaster===

On 15 April 1989, the ground was the scene of the worst tragedy in English sporting history when Liverpool faced Nottingham Forest in an FA Cup semi-final. During the match, 97 Liverpool fans were crushed to death. Official investigations criticised Sheffield Wednesday for not acting upon previous incidents (especially the 1981 FA Cup semi-final) that had shown the potential for crushing at Hillsborough. The Leppings Lane end of the ground did not hold a valid safety certificate; it had not been updated since 1979.

The recommendations of the Taylor Report led to a series of improvements to safety at grounds across the United Kingdom. The terraces at Hillsborough were converted to all seated accommodation over the following four years, and the fences around the pitch were replaced with low safety-barricades to allow incursion onto the playing surface in case of emergency.

====Memorial====
Outside the ground, near the main entrance on Parkside Road, is a memorial to the 96 fans that lost their lives at Hillsborough in 1989, during the FA Cup Semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. The memorial was unveiled on the tenth anniversary of the tragedy, 15 April 1999. It reads: &quot;In memory of the 96 men, women, and children who tragically died and the countless people whose lives were changed forever. FA Cup semi-final Liverpool v Nottingham Forest. 15 April 1989. &quot;You’ll never walk alone.&quot;&quot; The memorial suffered minor damage in the Hillsborough Flood; however, it was easily and swiftly repaired.

===All-seater era===
In 1996, Hillsborough was host to several fixtures at the Euro 96 competition and in particular was host to the Danish squad. The Danish fans endeared themselves to the local population with their fanatical support and exemplary behaviour, and were particularly popular amongst local landlords—a number of Sheffield public houses had to order emergency supplies of beer and cigarettes.

In 1997 Hillsborough hosted the League Cup Final replay between Leicester City and Middlesbrough, won by Leicester 1–0. Later the same year Middlesbrough returned to Hillsborough for an FA Cup semi-final replay, in which they beat Chesterfield 3–0.

The record attendance since the ground was made all-seated was on 2 February 2000 in a Premier League game against Manchester United watched by 39,640 fans. In recent years, average attendances at Hillsborough have remained high relative to the lower leagues they have participated in:

*2015–16: 22,641 (Football League Championship)
*2016–17: 27,129 (EFL Championship)
*2017–18: 25,995 (EFL Championship)
*2018–19: 24,429 (EFL Championship)
*2019–20: 23,773 (EFL Championship)
*2020–21: 0 (EFL Championship)
*2021–22: 22,470 (EFL League One)
===Hillsborough flood===

On 25 June 2007, the River Don burst its banks during a period of severe weather in the area and the whole ground was flooded with several feet of water. Changing rooms, restaurants and kitchens, offices and superstore were all affected, with repairs costing millions of pounds. The clean-up effort took months, although Sheffield Wednesday fixtures were only slightly affected as the floods occurred in the close season. A memorial to the floods was unveiled on 25 June 2008 under the South Stand.

==Stands and other structures==
===North Stand===
The original North Stand was built in 1899–1903 and the current stand was built in 1960–61. It has a capacity of 9,255 seated. The current sponsor for 2018–19 is Chansiri.

The North Stand is the third largest stand at the ground, running along the north side of the pitch.

The original North Stand was built between 1899 and 1903. It was unique at the time, as it had facilities for both men and women, and a slight semicircle which gave a good view of the pitch at any angle (though the supporting pillars did cause some obstruction). The area at the front of the stand was a grass bank until the early 1900s when it was made into a terrace. The stand was joined to the original North West Terrace until the late 1950s when the club decided to build a brand new stand. The current North Stand was opened in 1961. It is only the second football stand in Britain to have a cantilever roof. Hence some fans know it as &#x27;the cantilever&#x27;. It was the first stand in the country to run the entire length of the pitch. The first cantilever stand in English football at Scunthorpe United&#x27;s Old Show Ground only covered the centre of the pitch. Following the formal opening of the stand in August 1961, a celebration match was played on 22 October 1961 when Wednesday met Santos of Brazil with their new star Pele in the team. Pele&#x27;s goal helped Santos to a 4–2 win. When opened, the stand held 10,000 but the capacity has been reduced more recently to make room for spectators with disabilities and also to widen the exit aisles for safety.

The architectural critic Sir Nikolaus Pevsner called the cantilever stand &quot;interesting and unexpected&quot;. This is the only mention of a football ground in his &quot;Buildings of England&quot; series of architectural guides. The opinion of Simon Inglis, an historian of sports and architecture, is: &quot;There is not a misplaced line in this remarkable stand. From any angle (it) is quite breathtaking. It is like an architect’s model from the 1950s of the dream stand of the future, a space age stand.&quot;

===West Stand (Leppings Lane End)===
The original west stand was built around 1900 and the current stand was built in 1961–65 with a capacity of 6,658 seated.

The West stand houses the visiting supporters at Hillsborough on match days. It is a two tier structure with 2,494 seats in the lower half, and 4,164 seats in the upper enclosure. The stand is adjoined to the North West Corner which has now had its seats removed and covered with tarpaulin. This stand has not been used for fans since the 2012 2–0 win over Wycombe Wanderers, and most recently has been used as a base for Sky Sports when matches are broadcast

The original stand, built at the turn of the 20th century, was a covered terrace housing up to 3,000 fans. In the 1920s this was joined by the North West terrace, before the Leppings Lane stand was replaced by a 12,000 capacity partially covered terrace. Before the 1966 World Cup the West Stand was demolished again and completely replaced by a two-tiered structure with 4,471 seats in the upper tier and retaining a standing in the lower tier.

After the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 the lower tier terrace was closed for two years and its fencing covered with blue tarp for the remainder of the 1988–89 season. The terrace remained closed and out of use for 1989–90, and its fences were removed entirely prior to the 1990–91 season. The lower tier terrace was converted to 2,294 seats and was re-opened prior to the start of the 1991–92 season. The North West Corner was the last section of the stand to be made all seated, adding another 1,337 seats to the existing structure. The old wooden seats in the upper tier were replaced with bigger plastic ones in 1997. During the 2012–13 season the first row of seats was removed from the lower tier, after an incident involving Leeds United supporters when a minor pitch invasion took place. In the summer of 2013 small gates were installed at the front of the gangways for emergency access to the pitch.

On 7 January 2023, an FA Cup tie with Newcastle United was marred by a failure of crowd management. The council announced a further reduction in capacity following a review of this event.

===South Stand===
The original South Stand was built in 1899–1903 and the current stand was built in 1913–15 and extended in 1995. The total stand capacity is 11,352 (all-seater).

The largest stand at Hillsborough situated on the banks of the river Don. It has a large lower tier with 8,275 seats (including the directors box) and an upper tier known as the &#x27;Grand Stand&#x27; with 3,077 seats. The nearest four blocks of seating to the east on the Upper tier are used as the club&#x27;s Family enclosure. The first South Stand was first built at Olive Grove, but moved with the club in the summer of 1899 to the new site at Owlerton where it was rebuilt brick by brick. The clock was also moved to Hillsborough. The modern stand, the oldest remaining stand at the ground, was built between 1913 and 1915 for a fee exceeding £17,000 to a design by Archibald Leitch. The stand had 5,600 seats as well as room for 11,000 standing fans. The clock was salvaged from the old stand and put on the new one.

The modern stand has seen a series of improvements, the first being a conversion to an all-seated stand in 1965 ahead of the 1966 FIFA World Cup and latest being a major £7 million re-development for the Euro 1996 international competition when an upper tier (Grandstand) of 3,077 extra seats, a new roof, 30 executive boxes, two conference suites, a bar, a restaurant and a range of office space were added. Again, the clock was saved and put on the new stand. The South Stand still bears the original clock face and finial from the very first stand, which was brought from Olive Grove. The stand houses the main reception, media and hospitality boxes, Press box, Television gantry, as well as the ground&#x27;s family enclosure, five modern refreshment kiosks and four bars. It also features concourse television sets relaying live coverage of the match as well as highlights at half-time. The team changing room and dug-outs are also situated here.

===Spion Kop===
Spion Kop was built in 1914 with a capacity of 11,210 (seated). In common with several large terraces at English football grounds, it was given this name by supporters, after a hill that was the scene of a battle in the Second Boer War. The Spion Kop is built into a natural hill at the east end of the ground and houses the most vocal of Wednesday&#x27;s supporters. It is usually simply referred to by fans as The Kop. In 1914 concrete terracing was installed on the bank, which was further extended in 1927. The final expansion of the hill came in 1954. The stand remained open to the elements until a roof was added in 1986 after fans raised money to contribute to the cost. When the roof was added, the stand was &#x27;squared&#x27; off to make it symmetrical so that the roof was used fully. Due to this, the Kop was extended, so the capacity rose from 16,000 to 22,000.

After the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, the stand&#x27;s blue fences were at first retained. However, for the 1989–90 season, the gates allowing egress to the pitch were painted white and kept open throughout all matches, including the Steel City derby on 21 November 1989. The Kop was the last part of the Wednesday ground to be converted to all-seater accommodation, the change finally coming in 1993 to comply with new FA Premier League regulations following the Taylor Report. The capacity was hence halved, but the Kop remains one of the largest single tier stands in Britain. A large concourse area was added in 2004, partially funded by the Owls Trust.

===North West Corner===
North West Corner was originally built in 1919–20 and the current stand was built in January 1965 – May 1966. The North West Corner, or North West terrace as it is sometimes still referred to, despite now being all seated is the only major section of the stadium to remain uncovered (the other area is the Kop Corner). The original North West Terrace was built between 1919 and 1920 to adjoin both the North Stand and West Stand, but was demolished in early 1965 and replaced in mid 1966, in time for the 1966 World Cup. The terrace was not in use for two years, and seats were installed in 1991 along with the Leppings Lane terrace. The stand failed to gain a safety certificate for the 2007–08 season. In recent years it had only been used as overspill for away fans when both the upper and lower tiers of the West Stand have been filled, however in the 2011–12 season, with Wednesday needing to better or match the result of their neighbours to gain promotion on the final day of the season, the Corner was opened to visiting Wycombe Wanderers fans, with the West Stand used by home supporters. Whilst not being used for seating, the Corner has recently been used as extra advertising space, with advertising boards on the back wall, and more recently a large &#x27;My Sheffield Jobs&#x27; seat covering appearing alongside their sponsorship of the North Stand. It is sponsored by Handley Brown. This corner is to be roofed, under the Hillsborough stadium Upgrade plans, yet no work has yet been done, due to owners of the nearby terraces complaining. This corner is commonly nicknamed the &#x27;Crows Nest&#x27; by Wednesdayites. The corner is still unable to gain a safety certificate and remains unused by fans. Television company Sky use the corner for their temporary studios and technical area for televised games. Prior to the start of the 2021–22 season, the club removed the seats from the terrace, suggesting that the club have officially mothballed the corner for the foreseeable future.

===Kop Corner===
Kop Corner was built in 1986 with a capacity of 400 (though this 400 is included in the overall Spion Kop capacity of 11,210).

The Kop Corner is a small filling section which is adjoined to the Main Spion Kop. It is the second largest area of the ground to remain uncovered, after the North West Corner. This corner is usually just referred to as part of the Spion Kop, as is its capacity, and it is rare to see it referred to as a separate area. The Kop Corner was a lot larger before the installation of the Spion Kop roof in 1986, but a crane was needed to lift the roof, and the Kop Corner was destroyed so the crane could get in. Part of the corner was rebuilt, which is the present day area. Seats were installed in 1993 to correspond with the Taylor report, as was the rest of the Kop. This area was to be extended, and fully filled in under Sheffield Wednesday&#x27;s ground renovation plans. The corner is well known amongst Wednesdayites as the location of Paul Gregory, aka &#x27;Tango Man&#x27; on match days, along with his &#x27;Wolverhampton Owls&#x27; flag and is often referred to as &#x27;Tango&#x27;s corner&#x27; by the Wednesdayites.

===South West Corner (stadium control area)===

The stadium control area is in the southwest area of the ground, between the South and West stands. The most dominant feature is the video scoreboard. The current scoreboard was installed in May 2015 and replaced an older electronic dot-matrix style electronic scoreboard.

The old electronic scoreboard was one of the first electric scoreboards in an English football ground, installed in 1991 in time for the 1991–92 season. For the majority of the match, this showed the score and time, but as of the 2011–12 season, the board showed advertisements every few minutes. Before and after the match, information like team line-ups, fixtures, and other results were shown. The scoreboard had become somewhat of a cult icon of Hillsborough Stadium and Sheffield Wednesday as a whole, loved by the fans for its retro looks and &quot;T-fault&quot;, where a series of lights making a T shape light up between animations due to a wiring fault, which had not been fixed on purpose by the club both as a joke and also because of its love by the fans. One of the most popular &quot;T-fault&quot; situations was when announcing the score of fierce rivals Sheffield United – the scoreboard displayed &quot;Shhhhhhhh...&quot;, then, after a brief pause, &quot;T&quot;, and only then did it announce the score.

Below the scoreboard is the stadium control building, where all the technical aspects of the stadium are controlled (e.g. lighting, announcements, CCTV). At the base of the area is a very small section of disused terrace, which has still not been converted to seating. It is only used as a congregation area for the police and stewards, and has not held fans since the 1989 Hillsborough disaster.

===Owls Megastore and Ticket Office===
The Owls Megastore is the official Sheffield Wednesday club shop, underneath the North Stand. It sells all the merchandise, and also the tickets for matchdays. It and the neighbouring ticket office were severely damaged in the Hillsborough Flood. The wall separating the ticket office and club shop was subsequently demolished, and a much larger Owls Megastore opened a few months later, with the ticket office now in one of the corners of the shop. Before the re-development, the Owls Megastore was two-storey, but it has now been changed to one.

===Hillsborough Stadium Footbridge===

A bridge was built across the River Don in 1996, to provide access to the refurbished South Stand, ahead of Euro 96. It connects Parkside Road and the surrounding area to the main entrance to Hillsborough Stadium.

===Dooley&#x27;s Restaurant, Sheridan Suite, and other South Stand internal facilities===
Several restaurants, such as Dooley&#x27;s and the Sheridan Suite, are under the South Stand. Other areas include the 1867 Lounge, various bars, and a wide range of office space. Board rooms, meeting halls and business suites are also here.

==Location==

The stadium is located in the north west of the city roughly three miles from the city centre. The area is mainly residential with a number of shops and a shopping centre located at nearby Hillsborough Corner. Views of the area can be enjoyed from hills located to the west.

The stadium is sandwiched between Hillsborough Park to the south and terrace housing to the north. The River Don also runs alongside the stadium to the south. The Spion Kop backs straight onto Penistone Road, a major dual carriageway leading to the city centre, while there is some space between the West Stand and Leppings Lane.

==Upgrade works==

===2017===
Sheffield Wednesday did not secure promotion to the Premier League in the 2015–16 season, and so some of the long-term upgrade plans have been delayed. However, in July 2017 some upgrade and improvement works commenced with completion before the first league home game in August 2017.
Upgrades include an increase in the congregation area at the rear of the Kop and installation of a new bar at the rear of the Kop.
A new printed banner was added over the Leppings Lane face of the West Stand.
A new fire suppression systems in all concourse Kiosk.
Addition of LED Perimeter boards.
During the 2015–16 season the club installed a completely new EPOS system on the concourses.
===Future plans===
Sheffield Wednesday announced in the summer of 2009 plans for a £22 million upgrade of the stadium and an increase in capacity to 44,825 from the current 39,732 with no viewing restrictions. These plans were to be completed by 2013 and would bring the stadium up to FIFA standards for hosting World Cup matches.

====Work updates====
Work has not started as of November 2018 with no confirmation on when, or even if, it will start. Planning permission was granted for the entire scheme on 20 October 2009 but due to England not winning the World Cup 2018 bid, redevelopment has been put on hold.

In 2022, Sheffield Wednesday replaced its floodlighting system with the Modus S1500 from Midstream Lighting. The new LED floodlights were installed on the North and South stands of Hillsborough, delivering a higher standard of lighting that met the requirements for both League One and the Championship. The previous lighting system, which had been in place since the 1990s, utilised approximately 168 floodlights. The installation of the new system included 60 LED floodlights and a Light show feature, significantly enhancing the matchday experience for fans.

Graffiti artist Luke Horton has been adding new paintings of Wednesday fans outside the walls on the stadium, with each faceless character having football sayings in the Yorkshire dialect being added over their face.
==Records==
The highest attendance recorded at Hillsborough was in the FA Cup fifth round on 17 February 1934. A total of 72,841 turned up to see a 2–2 draw with Manchester City. The highest attendance recorded since work to convert the stadium to an all-seater venue was completed in 1993 was for a Premier League match against Manchester United on 2 February 2000. The game was watched by 39,640 fans.
The highest seasonal average attendance at Hillsborough was 42,520 in the 1952–53 season in Division 1. The highest average attendance in the second tier of English football was 41,682 in the 1951–52 season, which saw the club gain promotion from Division 2 and Derek Dooley score a record 46 league goals. The highest average attendance in the third tier of English football was achieved in the 2004–05 season when an average of 23,107 fans watched the League One games at Hillsborough.

The lowest average attendance at Hillsborough came in the first season after its opening (1899–1900) when each game was attended by an average crowd of just 6,800 fans, mainly because the new stadium, then called &quot;Owlerton Stadium&quot;, was a fraction of the size it is today.

The largest gate receipts taken from a match at Hillsborough was for the Euro 96 game between Turkey and Denmark on 19 June 1996. A crowd of 28,671 watched the match, paying a total of £1,012,150.

Hillsborough still holds the record for the highest attendance for a third tier football match in Britain. 49,309 spectators turned up on 26 December 1979, one of the most memorable days in SWFC history, when the Owls beat Sheffield United 4–0 in a top of the table clash, now known as the Boxing Day Massacre.

The largest receipts for a club game at Hillsborough were for the FA Cup semi-final replay between Chesterfield and Middlesbrough on 22 April 1997 and totalled £680,965. The game was watched by 30,339 fans.

The highest receipts for a game at Hillsborough involving Sheffield Wednesday was for the Premier League match against Manchester United on 7 March 1998, which was watched by 39,427 fans and earned the club £386,426.

==International football==
Hillsborough was used as a venue for the 1966 FIFA World Cup and 1996 UEFA European championships. It was also used for some England matches before Wembley Stadium was built.

It hosted two England under-21 internationals. The first was a 1984 UEFA European Under-21 Championship Qualifying Group 3 match against France&#x27;s under-21s on 28 February 1984. The hosts thrashed the visitors 6 – 1 with Mark Hateley scoring four goals as well as single goals from Dave Watson and Mel Sterland. The other was a 2006 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification Group 6 match against Poland&#x27;s under-21s on 11 October 2005. The hosts thrashed the visitors 4 – 1 with Steven Taylor scoring twice as well as single goals from Carlton Cole and Jerome Thomas while Marcin Kikut scored for the visitors with 23,110 in attendance.

==English 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bid==
Hillsborough Stadium was selected by The FA as a proposed venue for matches as part of the English 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bid on 16 December 2009.

<text>Louis-Pierre Baltard (; 9 July 1764 – 22 January 1846) was a French architect, and engraver and father of Victor Baltard.

==Life==

He was born in Paris. He was originally a landscape painter, but in his travels through Italy was struck with the beauty of the Italian buildings, and changed his profession, devoting himself to architecture.

In his new occupation he achieved great success, and was selected to prepare the plans for some of the largest public edifices in Paris. His reputation is chiefly based on his skill in engraving. Among the best known of his plates are the drawings of Paris (&quot;Paris et ses monuments&quot;, 1803), the engravings for Denon&#x27;s &quot;Égypte&quot;, the illustrations of Napoleon&#x27;s wars (&quot;La Colonne de la grande armée&quot;), and those contained in the series entitled the &quot;Grand prix de l&#x27;architecture&quot;, which for some time he carried on alone. He also gained distinction as an engraver of portraits.

The Palais de Justice in Lyon are his most notable project.

Baltard died, aged 81, in Lyon.

==Family==
Two of his children were also architects. Of these the more important was Victor Baltard, who designed Les Halles, Saint-Augustin, Paris, and the facade of Notre-Dame-des-Blancs-Manteaux.

== Architectural works ==
Louis-Pierre Baltard and Jean-Baptiste Rondelet were candidates in the competition to transform the Panthéon de Paris into the « temple de la Gloire ». In 1813, on the death of Alexandre Théodore Brongniart, Baltard proposed to undertake the building of the Palais Brongniart, but was unsuccessful.

<text>Thomas Baltzar (&quot;&quot;. 1630 – 24 July 1663) was a German violinist and composer. He was born in Lübeck to a musical family; his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather were all musicians. Sources suggest an array of music teachers who may have taught him in his early years. According to the writings of Samuel Hartlib, composer and violinist Johann Schop was one of those instructors. Baltzar may have studied the violin with Gregor Zuber and composition with Franz Tunder. He may have also received instruction from composer and violinist Nicolaus Bleyer, who taught Baltzar&#x27;s younger brother.

Through contacts at Germany&#x27;s embassy in Sweden (where, by 1653, Baltzar was employed), he may have come in contact with English musicians accompanying Bulstrode Whitelocke&#x27;s mission to Queen Christina. This possible encounter may have been the impetus for Baltzar&#x27;s decision to emigrate to England in 1655, leaving behind his newly attained position of &quot;Ratslutenist&quot; of Lübeck (he had returned briefly to his home city, probably shortly after Christina&#x27;s abdication in June 1654). Hartlib&#x27;s writings indicate that the Swedish ambassador to England, Christer Bonde, took in Baltzar.

Baltzar&#x27;s arrival in England was met with acclaim. On 4 March 1656 he performed the violin at the residence of Roger L&#x27;Estrange, where John Evelyn was in attendance. Evelyn wrote in his &quot;Diary&quot; that night:
This night I was invited by Mr. Rog: L&#x27;Estrange to the incomperable &quot;Lubicer&quot; on the Violin, his variety upon a few notes &amp; plaine ground with that dexterity, as was admirable, &amp; though a very young man, yet so perfect &amp; skillful as there was nothing so crosse &amp; perplext, which being by our Artists, brought to him, which he did not at first sight, with ravishing sweetenesse &amp; improvements, play off, to the astonishment of our best Masters: In Summ, he plaid on that single Instrument a full Consort, so as the rest, flung-downe their Instruments, as acknowledging a victory.
In September 1656, Baltzar was listed as one of the musicians who helped premiere &quot;The Siege of Rhodes&quot; in London, thought to have been the first all-sung English opera. Two years later, according to Anthony Wood, he was employed as a private musician for Sir Anthony Cope at Hanwell House in Banbury. Wood, who had heard Baltzar play at a performance in Warden John Wilkins&#x27;s lodgings at Wadham College, Oxford, described his &quot;very great astonishment&quot; at the German&#x27;s skill. &quot;[I] saw him run his fingers to the end of the finger-board of the violin, and run them back insensibly,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and all with alacrity and in very good tune, which [I] nor any in England saw the like before.&quot; Also in attendance was John Wilson, a professor of music at the University of Oxford, who, according to Wood, bowed at Baltzar&#x27;s feet after the performance. However, Wood also observed of Baltzar that &quot;he was given to excessive drinking.&quot;

On 23 December 1661 Baltzar entered Charles II&#x27;s service as a leader of the king&#x27;s private music ensemble, the &quot;four and twenty fiddlers,&quot; succeeding Davis Mell in the post. He was given an annual salary of £110, a high figure for the time. Some of Baltzar&#x27;s surviving compositions, including a work in C major that may be the earliest suite for three violins, require virtuosity and technical mastery. According to Wood, Baltzar&#x27;s drinking habits contributed to his death. He was buried in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey on 27 July 1663.

<text>Great Torrington (often abbreviated to Torrington, though the villages of Little Torrington and Black Torrington are situated in the same region) is a market town in Devon, England. Parts of it are sited on high ground with steep drops down to the River Torridge below, with the lower-lying parts of the town prone to occasional flooding. Torrington is in the centre of Tarka Country, a landscape captured by Henry Williamson in his novel &quot;Tarka the Otter&quot; in 1927. Great Torrington has one of the most active volunteering communities in the United Kingdom.

In July 2019, Great Torrington was reported to be the healthiest place to live in Britain. Researchers from the University of Liverpool found that the area had low levels of pollution, good access to green space and health services, along with few retail outlets.

== History ==

There were Iron Age and medieval castles and forts in Torrington, located on the Castle Hill.

Great Torrington had strategic significance in the English Civil War. In the Battle of Torrington (1646), the Parliamentarians, led by Sir Thomas Fairfax, swept into the town and defeated Lord Hopton&#x27;s forces. This marked the end of Royalist resistance in the West Country. Today the town is recognised as an important heritage centre for the history of the 17th century, and its people can often be seen dressed in costume for historical re-enactments, festivals and celebrations. An interactive Civil War Experience, &quot;Torrington 1646&quot;, used to mark the town&#x27;s historically important role.
The Torrington jail was not big enough for more than one man so the Royalists kept all the Parliamentarian prisoners in the church. Then 70 barrels of gunpowder exploded and killed everyone held captive and many of their captors. Great Torrington Town Hall, a neoclassical style building, was completed in 1861.

===Railway===
The branch line from Barnstaple to Bideford was extended to Great Torrington in July 1872 by the London and South Western Railway, which built a railway station and locomotive depot in the town. The station was always named &#x27;Torrington&#x27;, not &#x27;Great Torrington&#x27;.

The locomotive depot was closed in 1959 and the line was closed to passenger traffic as part of the Beeching Axe. It was closed to goods traffic in 1984. At the site of the old station there is still in 2015 a pub named &quot;The Puffing Billy&quot;. A few small sections of track remain, but most has been removed and replaced with a combined foot and cycle path as part of the Tarka Trail. The Tarka Trail continues to Bideford, Barnstaple and on to Braunton in one direction, and to Meeth in the other, making of traffic free trail.

==Descent of the manor==
The manor of Great Torrington was granted by Queen Mary to James Basset (1526–1558), MP, a younger son of Sir John Bassett (1462 – 31 Jan 1529) of Umberleigh. James&#x27;s son Philip Bassett sold it to Sir John Fortescue (–1607) of Ponsbourne, near Hatfield, Hertfordshire, the eldest son of Sir Adrian Fortescue (1476–1539), descended from Richard Fortescue, younger brother of Henry Fortescue (fl. 1426), Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas in Ireland and of Sir John Fortescue (ca. 1394–1480), Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales. Denys Rolle (1614–1638) of nearby Stevenstone in the parish of St Giles in the Wood, acquired the lordship of the manor of Great Torrington from his descendant Sir William Fortescue. Denys Rolle (1614–1638) founded the Bluecoat School in Torrington The fountain and clock in the square were given in 1870 by Mark Rolle (1835–1907) A number of family portraits were given to the town by the heirs of Mark Rolle, some of which remain on display in the Great Torrington Town Hall, some of the more valuable ones having been sold, including a portrait of John Rolle Walter (c.1714–1779) by Pompeo Batoni.

== Torrington Common ==

Torrington Common is an area of common land which surrounds the town on all but the eastern side. The common is administered by a body called &quot;The Commons Conservators&quot;. The Common covers and has over of public rights of way. The landscape features a variety of habitats, flora and fauna.

=== History of the common ===

An &quot;area of waste called the Common&quot; was donated to the town in 1194 by the feudal baron of Great Torrington. In 1889, the rights to this land were transferred by an Act of Parliament to an elected &quot;Committee of Conservators&quot;. The bill was subject of a local poll, as the document now at Devon Record Office evidences:

The Rolle Estate was the largest landowner in Devon, having been built up by the Rolle family of Stevenstone. Since 2 October 1889 the Conservators have met regularly to fulfil their remit to manage the land. Early activity was mainly concerned with control over the grazing and quarrying of the common, but since 1980 grazing has stopped and instead various techniques have taken its place to prevent the common from reverting to scrub and woodland. 

=== Features of the common ===
* Taddiport Bridge and Rothern Bridge: Prior to the opening of the Town Mills Bridge, these were the only local crossings of the River Torridge.
* Rolle Road: This is the site of the Rolle Canal which opened in 1827 to help transport clay, lime and other commodities between the boats on the tidal river at Landcross and the lime kilns, clay pits and farms around Torrington. It ran through common land, but was closed in 1871. Later, it was filled in to create a toll road across the Common.
* Waterloo Monument: A stone obelisk erected in 1818 by &quot;the ladies of Great Torrington&quot; to commemorate the Battle of Waterloo.

== Visitor attractions ==

Attractions in Great Torrington include:
* Dartington Crystal, Factory, Visitors Centre, Glass Shop and Restaurant of Dartington Crystal – the biggest employer in the town and the only major working glass factory in the UK

* Rosemoor Garden, a collection of gardens, woodlands and parkland owned by the Royal Horticultural Society
* The Victorian Torrington Pannier Market with a glass roof, restored in 1999
* Great Torrington Heritage Museum, located next to the Pannier Market
* St Michael and All Angels, a Church of England parish church whose churchyard includes a mound said to contain the remains of 60 Civil War Royalist prisoners
* The Plough Arts Centre, a small theatre, cinema and gallery
* Great Torrington also has a selection of pubs selling food and a selection of real ales. These include The Torridge Inn, The Black Horse, Torrington Arms, Cavalier, Globe and Royal Exchange. Torrington had a small brewery called Clearwater Brewery with its &quot;Cavalier&quot; and &quot;1646&quot; brands.

== Employment ==

Torrington has long been a factory town. In the nineteenth century it was a centre of the glove making industry. The major employer today is Dartington Crystal, but the shops in the town centre also provide a source of employment. Most of the shops are locally owned; however, there are branches of The Co-operative Food and Lidl. Large factories have deserted the town in recent years including the meat factory after a fire, and the milk factory which also caught fire has moved its production elsewhere. Various converted and purpose-built care homes in the town also provide a significant source of employment.

In 2006, Tesco sought to open a store in the town; however, this was opposed by many locals and the planning application was rejected.

== Sports and culture ==
Local radio is provided by The Voice, a station based in nearby Barnstaple that broadcasts across North Devon on FM and DAB. Most of the content on the station is locally produced.

Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the nearby Huntshaw Cross TV transmitter situated north east of the town.

BBC Local Radio station that broadcast to the town is BBC Radio Devon on 94.8 FM.

The regional radio station Heart West can be received in the town on FM and DAB. The station is a part of the Heart network and broadcasts across the South West of England. Most of the shows broadcast are national shows from the Heart London studios, rather than region-specific ones. Region-specific content includes the weekday Drivetime show produced in Bristol, and local advertising.

The local newspaper is the &quot;North Devon Journal&quot; also based in Barnstaple. The &quot;Western Morning News&quot; is a regional paper widely available. Most households receive a copy of the &quot;North Devon Gazette&quot; every week. &quot;The Crier&quot; is the community newsletter and diary delivered free to most households in the town and surrounding area for ten months of the year.

Torrington&#x27;s football teams are Torrington F.C. and Torridgeside A.F.C. There are also rugby, netball, tennis and swimming teams. Torrington nine-hole Golf Course is northwest of the town centre. Great Torrington Bowling Club, established in 1645, is the third oldest bowling club in England.

Great Torrington is twinned with the French port town of Roscoff, situated in northern Brittany. Roscoff is served by the Brittany Ferries service from Plymouth and is a popular destination for school trips from the area.

==Transport==
Torrington is served by 43 local bus services mostly operated by Stagecoach South West. Some only operate one way and a number are weekly only service.

Belle Vue Airfield is a single runway airfield about 2.5 miles northeast of Great Torrington in North Devon, England. It is for private aviation only, operating restricted flying hours and is frequented by Microlight and hang-gliding clubs. The 580-metre (1,902-foot) runway is grass.
Exeter Airport away operates scheduled flights from Shannon Airport, Eire and the Channel Islands.

The nearest ferry port is Plymouth away, at which Brittany Ferries offer a regular service from Roscoff in Brittany.
There is a summertime-only ferry service based at Bideford Harbour (7 miles away) to and from Lundy Island.

Torrington has no direct train services; Umberleigh (8 miles away) is served by the Tarka Line from Exeter St David&#x27;s. Bus connections are available to and from Barnstaple station (11 miles away).

<doc id="148671" wikidata="Q312859" url="?curid=148671" title="Yousuf Karsh">
<text>Yousuf Karsh FRPS (December23, 1908July13, 2002) was an Armenian–Canadian photographer known for his portraits of notable individuals. He has been described as one of the greatest portrait photographers of the 20th century.

An Armenian genocide survivor, Karsh migrated to Canada as a refugee. By the 1930s he established himself as a significant photographer in Ottawa, where he lived most of his adult life, though he traveled extensively for work. His iconic 1941 photograph of Winston Churchill was a breakthrough point in his career, through which he took numerous photos of known political leaders, men and women of arts and sciences. More than 20 photos by Karsh appeared on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine, until he retired in 1993.

==Early life and arrival in Canada==
Yousuf Karsh was born to Armenian parents Amsih Karsh (1872–1962), a merchant, and Bahia Nakash (1883–1958), on December 23, 1908, in Mardin, Diyarbekir Vilayet, Ottoman Empire. His father was Catholic, while his mother was Protestant. He had two brothers, Jamil and Malak; the latter was also a photographer. His illiterate father travelled extensively to trade furniture, rugs, and spices, while his mother was &quot;an educated woman, a rarity in those days, and was extremely well read, particularly in her beloved Bible.&quot;

The city&#x27;s Armenian population was largely Arabic-speaking. He grew up during the Armenian genocide, during which some of his family were murdered. &quot;My recollections of those days comprise a strange mixture of blood and beauty, of persecution and peace,&quot; he later wrote. Karsh and his family escaped to a refugee camp in Aleppo, Syria in 1922 in a month-long journey with a Kurdish caravan. &quot;The Economist&quot; noted in their obituary of Karsh that he &quot;thought of himself as an Armenian&quot; and, according to Vartan Gregorian: &quot;Although he was proud to be Canadian, Karsh was equally proud to be Armenian.&quot;

Karsh was sent to Canada by his family. He arrived in Halifax, Nova Scotia on December 31, 1923, by ship from Beirut. He immediately moved to Sherbrooke, Quebec to live with his maternal uncle George Nakashian (Nakash), a portrait photographer. He attended Sherbrooke High School for a year and his &quot;formal education was over almost before it began.&quot; By the time he reached Canada, he &quot;spoke little French, and less English&quot; and &quot;had no money and little schooling.&quot; Karsh worked for, and was taught photography by his uncle. He gave Karsh a Box Brownie camera. From 1928 to 1931, Karsh apprenticed in Boston, Massachusetts for John H. Garo, the most prominent Armenian photographer in America at the time who had made a name for himself photographing Boston celebrities.

==Career==
Karsh settled in Ottawa, initially working for photographer John Powis; his first commissions were from local Ottawa theatre groups. Karsh opened his first studio in 1932. It was located on the second floor of a building at 130 Sparks Street, which was later named the Hardy Arcade. He remained there until 1972, when he moved to the Château Laurier. He was known professionally as &quot;Karsh of Ottawa&quot;, which was also his signature.

He achieved initial success by capturing the attention of Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King, who helped Karsh arrange photography sessions with visiting dignitaries. Karsh was also introduced into the Rideau Hall social circle, and his portraits of Lord Bessborough, Governor General from 1931 to 1935, and his wife were widely published. Karsh became a member of the Ottawa Camera Club and exhibited works in the International Salon of Photography exhibitions held at the National Gallery of Canada from 1934 onwards.

Throughout his life, Karsh photographed &quot;anyone who was anyone.&quot; When asked why he almost exclusively captured famous people, he replied, &quot;I am working with the world&#x27;s most remarkable cross-section of people. I do believe it&#x27;s the minority who make the world go around, not the majority.&quot; He once also jokingly remarked, &quot;I do it for my own immortality.&quot; By the time he retired in 1992, more than 20 of his photos had appeared on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

Karsh&#x27;s photos were known for their use of dramatic lighting, which became the hallmark of his portrait style. He had studied it with both Garo in Boston and at the Ottawa Little Theatre, of which he was a member. Before a sitting, Karsh researched his subjects and talked to them. He also often used props in his portraits, some of which were emblematic of his sitters&#x27; professions.

His 1941 photo of Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, brought him international prominence. The photograph was taken on December 30, 1941, in the Speaker&#x27;s chamber of the Speaker of the House of Commons in the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa after Churchill delivered a speech on World War II to the Canadian members of the parliament. It was arranged by Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. Churchill is particularly noted for his posture and facial expression, which have been compared to the wartime feelings that prevailed in the UK: persistence in the face of an all-conquering enemy. The photo session was short and, just before exposure, Karsh moved towards Churchill and removed the cigar which was in his mouth. Churchill was miffed and showed his displeasure in the portrait. 

The photo, which according to &quot;The Economist&quot; is the &quot;most reproduced portrait in the history of photography&quot;, has been described as one of the &quot;most iconic portraits ever shot&quot;. USC Fisher Museum of Art described it as a &quot;defiant and scowling portrait [which] became an instant icon of Britain&#x27;s stand against fascism.&quot; It appeared on the cover of the May 21, 1945, issue of &quot;Life&quot;, which bought it for $100. One of the first prints of the original currently hangs on the wall in the Speaker&#x27;s chamber of the Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada, where the iconic image was photographed. It is considered Churchill&#x27;s most famous picture and appears on the Bank of England £5 note.

On August 19, 2022, it was discovered that a Karsh-signed portrait residing in the reading room of the Château Laurier, Ottawa, had been stolen and replaced with a fake. A staff member noticed that the frame on the portrait did not match the other five portraits donated by Karsh in 1998. Jerry Fielder, the director of Karsh&#x27;s estate, immediately recognized that the Karsh signature on the portrait was a forgery. Two years later Ottawa police announced that the photo had been located in Italy and had arrested an Ontario man in connection with its theft.

During World War II, Karsh photographed political and military leaders and began capturing photos of writers, actors, artists, musicians, scientists, and celebrities in the post-war period. His 1957 portrait of the American novelist Ernest Hemingway, taken at Hemingway&#x27;s Cuban home Finca Vigía, is another well-known photo by Karsh. According to Amanda Hopkinson it made Hemingway look like the hero of his 1952 novel &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;. His other notable portraits include George Bernard Shaw at an old age (1943), Dwight D. Eisenhower as a five-star general and Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force (1946), American artist Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe in her New Mexico studio (1956), and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev swathed in fur (1963). In 1984, Karsh photographed the Canadian rock band Rush for their album &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot;.

Besides portraits of the famous, Karsh photographed assembly line workers in Windsor, Ontario, commissioned by the Ford Motor Company of Canada. He also shot photos for Canadair that were used in an advertising campaign. His landscape photographs of Rome and the Holy Land were included in books in collaboration with Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, an annual poster for the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and other works.

Karsh closed his studio at Château Laurier in June 1992. His penultimate sittings in May 1993 were with President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary.

He was a visiting professor at Ohio University and at Emerson College in Boston.

Of the 100 most famous people of the 20th century according to &quot;International Who&#x27;s Who&quot; (2000), Karsh photographed 51. Among them were Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, Walt Disney, Princess Elizabeth (future Queen Elizabeth II), Leonid Brezhnev, Nikita Khrushchev, Martin Luther King, Fidel Castro, Yuri Gagarin and others.

== Personal life ==

Karsh&#x27;s first marriage was to Solange Gauthier (1902−1961) in 1939. He met her at the Ottawa Little Theatre in 1933, where she was a performer. Gauthier was born in Tours, France and migrated to Canada as a young girl. They initially moved into her apartment and in 1940, into an Art Deco home called Little Wings on the Rideau River just outside Ottawa. She died in January 1961 of cancer.

His second marriage was to Estrellita Maria Nachbar, a medical writer 21 years his junior, in August 1962. Their wedding was officiated by Fulton J. Sheen, Auxiliary Bishop of the Catholic Archdiocese of New York. From 1972 to 1992 they lived in a third-floor suite at Château Laurier, Ottawa and maintained Little Wings and an apartment and studio in Manhattan. They had no children.

===Retirement and death===
Karsh retired making photographs in 1993 and moved to Boston in 1997. He died on July 13, 2002, at Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital in Boston after complications following surgery. A private funeral was held in Ottawa. He was interred in Notre-Dame Cemetery in Ottawa.

==Recognition==
Karsh has been recognized as Canada&#x27;s leading portrait photographer. In general, he is recognized as one of the best-known and great portrait photographers of the 20th century. &quot;The Economist&quot; wrote upon his death that Karsh was &quot;for half a century perhaps the greatest portrait photographer in the monumental manner&quot;. The website of the Governor General of Canada describes him as the &quot;pre-eminent portrait photographer of the twentieth century&quot;. The Metropolitan Museum of Art described him as &quot;one of the greatest portrait photographers of the twentieth century [who] achieved a distinct style in his theatrical lighting&quot;. &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot; noted that his portraits &quot;have come to represent the public images of major international figures of politics, science, and culture in the twentieth century&quot;.

By the time of his death, his work was included in numerous museum collections including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art (both in New York), National Gallery of Canada, National Portrait Gallery in London, National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo, Art Institute of Chicago, Saint Louis Art Museum, Muscarelle Museum of Art, George Eastman Museum, and elsewhere. In 1987 the National Archives of Canada acquired the complete collection of Karsh items, including the negatives, prints and transparencies produced and retained by Karsh since 1933. The current Library and Archives Canada collection has 355,000 items in its Karsh collection, including all of his 150,000 negatives, kept at a facility in Gatineau, Quebec. Karsh&#x27;s widow Estrellita gifted more than 100 photographic prints to the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.

He was a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts and an honorary fellow of the Royal Photographic Society (UK).

On June 9, 2017, a bust of Karsh by Canadian-Armenian sculptor Megerditch Tarakdjian was unveiled before Château Laurier, Ottawa. It depicts Karsh with his famous camera and is a gift to Canada from the people of Armenia on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries and the 150th anniversary of Canada. Among attendees were George Furey, the Speaker of the Senate, and Arif Virani, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage.

The Karsh Award, dedicated to Yousuf and his brother Malak Karsh, is awarded by the City of Ottawa every two years to an established professional artist for outstanding artistic work in a photo-based medium.

<text>Gordon–Conwell Theological Seminary (GCTS) is an evangelical seminary with its main campus in Hamilton, Massachusetts, and three other campuses in Boston, Massachusetts; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Jacksonville, Florida. According to the Association of Theological Schools, Gordon-Conwell ranks as one of the largest evangelical seminaries in North America in terms of total number of full-time students enrolled.

==History==
Gordon-Conwell arose primarily from the merging and refounding of two separate schools, Gordon Divinity School, formerly of Gordon College (1889) in Wenham, Massachusetts, and the Conwell School of Theology (1888), formerly of Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Both schools were founded in the Baptist theological heritage. Both Adoniram Judson Gordon and Russell Conwell, the namesakes of Gordon-Conwell, were Baptist ministers; Gordon&#x27;s divinity school was first established as Gordon Bible Institute in 1889, while Conwell&#x27;s theological school was originally chartered as Temple College in 1888. In addition, the Boston Evangelical Institute, founded as Revere Lay College, also merged with Gordon-Conwell.

Beginning in the 1960s, both Gordon Divinity School and Conwell School of Theology experienced new challenges. In 1961, Temple University became a public university and was forced to divest the theological school, thus re-establishing the previous school of theology as a religious studies department. While Temple University hoped Russell Conwell&#x27;s legacy would continue to grow through their new religious studies department, J. Howard Pew and Daniel Poling, a Baptist minister and member of Temple&#x27;s board, felt Conwell&#x27;s vision to train Baptist ministers would be neglected. Poling contacted evangelist Billy Graham who agreed to help if he could appoint both a board of trustees of his choosing and faculty members he trusted. Graham, in turn, contacted his close friend Harold Ockenga who was due to take the presidency of Gordon College and oversee the financially stressed divinity school. Rather than see two evangelical seminaries compete, Graham proposed merging the two schools to form one evangelical school on the East coast to mirror Fuller Theological Seminary&#x27;s place on the West Coast. J. Howard Pew agreed to financially back the merger on the condition that the seminary must be divorced from an undergraduate institution. Under the leadership of evangelist Billy Graham and Boston pastor Harold Ockenga along with the financial backing of J. Howard Pew, Gordon-Conwell began holding classes in 1969. Pew provided &quot;$2 million to purchase the land, [Carmelite Junior Seminary in Hamilton], and several million more to refurbish existing facilities and to build and stock a library.&quot; Harold Ockenga was selected as its first president. Stuart Babbage was the first vice-president and also served on the faculty alongside Philip Edgcumbe Hughes, R.C. Sproul, Walter Mueller, and Richard Lovelace among others.

Gordon-Conwell initially received protests and negative press for moving theological out of the inner city. In response, Stephen Mott, Michael E. Haynes, pastor of Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury and state representative, and Gordon-Conwell trustees located Roxbury as the key location for inner city ministerial education. In 1976, the Boston-campus in Roxbury, the Campus for Urban Ministerial Education (CUME) was founded. Classes were originally held in Haynes&#x27; Twelfth Baptist Church. Eldin Villafañe, Dean Borgman, and Stephen Mott were among the first faculty to teach at CUME.

Other former presidents include Robert E. Cooley (1981–1997) who founded the Charlotte campus and Walter Kaiser, Jr. (1997–2006). The brief tenure of James Emery White (2006–07) saw White resign in less than a year into his post leading to the interim tenure of Haddon Robinson (2007–08). The President appointed after Robinson&#x27;s interim post was Dennis Hollinger (2009–2019).

On October 12, 2017, Dennis Hollinger announced his intention to retire on June 30, 2019. Scott Sunquist, an alumnus of Gordon-Conwell and former Dean of the School of Intercultural Studies and Professor of World Christianity at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California, succeeded Hollinger as the seventh president in July 2019.

==Campuses and locations==
The main residential campus is in South Hamilton, Massachusetts. There are additional campuses in Boston, Massachusetts and Charlotte, North Carolina, as well as a location in Jacksonville, Florida. The campus in Boston is known as the Center for Urban Ministerial Education (CUME), and it is a program offered exclusively through part-time night and weekend classes. The CUME campus also focuses primarily on urban and cross-cultural ministry in an urban setting. The Charlotte program was founded in 1992, and it offers courses on weekends, evenings and through week-long intensive courses, and generally attracts an older student body. The Jacksonville location opened in February 2006 as an extension of the Charlotte campus and today operates as a location for the seminary&#x27;s Networked Education program. The Jacksonville campus is located in downtown Jacksonville, Florida.

On February 2, 2012, the school began renovations of two large rooms in the main administrative and residence building on their South Hamilton campus. The &#x27;Old Book Center&#x27; has been transformed into &#x27;Alumni Hall,&#x27; a space for events and conferences dedicated to the alumni of Gordon-Conwell. In August 2013, a donor gifted several hand-carved tables, chairs, couches, and art work for the Great Hall. In honor of this donor, the space was renamed the Pierce Great Hall.

On May 16, 2022, Gordon-Conwell announced plans to sell part or all of the South Hamilton campus due to long-term financial health, the effect of the campus, facility maintenance costs, and also acknowledging more remote learning. The following year, the seminary announced that it would be staying on the Hamilton campus and selling its underutilized apartments while continuing to provide student housing.

==Organization==
Gordon Divinity School and Conwell Theological Seminary were both from the Baptist heritage. When Gordon-Conwell was refounded in 1969, however, the seminary was purposefully founded with no specific Christian denominational affiliation. Today, Gordon-Conwell has students from over 90 different denominations, as well as students from over 40 countries around the world. Theologically, the Statement of Faith and the Mission and Purpose of the seminary are based on Protestant and evangelical doctrines, such as biblical inerrancy.

Gordon-Conwell is part of the Boston Theological Institute (BTI), a consortium of nine theological schools in the Greater Boston area and the Carolina Theological Consortium, a consortium of four theological schools in North and South Carolina.

Gordon-Conwell is overseen by the main administration at the Hamilton campus. Each of the other three campuses is overseen by a campus dean, who reports directly to the Vice President for Academic Affairs and main campus administration.

==Academics==
As of Fall 2022, 1,330 students were enrolled at Gordon-Conwell. The seminary once offered over 20 degrees but has recently restructured their programs to only offer the Master of Divinity (M.Div.), Master of Theology (Th.M.), Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.), and five specialized master&#x27;s degrees.

Gordon-Conwell has been accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada since 1964 and by the New England Commission of Higher Education or its predecessor since 1985. It is also certified by the United States Government for the training of veterans and the education of chaplains for military service.

<text>Northwestern College (NWC and informally Northwestern Iowa) is a private Christian college in Orange City, Iowa, United States, that is Reformed, evangelical and ecumenical. Established in 1882, it offers more than 135 academic programs and enrolls over 1,700 students in undergraduate, graduate and online programs.

Northwestern is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, and the college&#x27;s business, education, nursing and social work programs are accredited by their respective accreditation organizations. It is also a member of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities. Northwestern&#x27;s athletic teams compete in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) as the Raiders and are part of the Great Plains Athletic Conference (GPAC).

==History==
In the early 1870s, Dutch immigrants in Pella, Iowa, moved to northwest Iowa and named their main settlement &quot;Orange City&quot; after the Dutch royal house. A decade later, the town&#x27;s residents, led by local businessman Henry Hospers and the Rev. Seine Bolks, the first pastor of First Reformed Church, started a Christian classical academy to prepare students for college and ultimately the ministry. Northwestern Classical Academy was formally incorporated on July 19, 1882. Enrollment grew from 25 students in the first year to approximately 70 within a decade. Zwemer Hall, the first permanent building, was erected in 1894 and is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1928, Northwestern Junior College was established. It became a four-year teacher-training college in 1961, the same year the academy ceased operation. Four years later, the board of trustees approved the development of a liberal arts program. Enrollment doubled to more than 760 in the 1960s, and the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools granted Northwestern College full accreditation in 1970.

During the past two decades, Northwestern&#x27;s enrollment has grown approximately 30%. Twice, a member of Northwestern&#x27;s faculty was named Iowa Professor of the Year by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE): Spanish professor Piet Koene in 2004, and theatre professor Jeff Barker in 2006. Academic offerings have expanded to include online and graduate degree programs, and more than $50 million has been invested in new construction and other campus improvements since 2013.

==Campus==
Northwestern College is located in Orange City, Iowa, a community of more than 6,000 residents in Sioux County, Iowa. Orange City has been ranked the fourth-most livable small town in America by TheTravel.com and one of the 100 Best Small Towns in the U.S. by Livability.com. Northwestern&#x27;s 100-acre campus is a few blocks south of Orange City&#x27;s downtown at the intersection of Highway 10 and Albany Avenue and features a campus green that stretches from the DeWitt Family Science Center to De Valois Stadium. More than $50 million has been invested in new construction and other improvements since 2013.

<doc id="148677" wikidata="Q209793" url="?curid=148677" title="Constantine III (Western Roman emperor)">
<text>Constantine III (; died shortly before 18 September 411) was a common Roman soldier who was declared emperor in Roman Britain in 407 and established himself in Gaul. He was recognised as co-emperor of the Roman Empire from 409 until 411.

Constantine rose to power from within the field army of Roman Britain and was acclaimed emperor in early 407. He promptly moved to Gaul (modern France), taking all of the mobile troops from Britain, with their commander Gerontius, to confront bands of Germanic invaders who had crossed the Rhine the previous winter. With a mixture of fighting and diplomacy Constantine stabilised the situation and established control over Gaul and Hispania (modern Spain and Portugal), establishing his capital at Arles. The sitting emperor of the Western Roman Empire, Honorius, sent an army under Sarus the Goth to expel Constantine&#x27;s forces. After initial victories, Sarus was repulsed. In Hispania, Honorius&#x27;s relatives rose and expelled Constantine&#x27;s administration. An army under the general Gerontius was sent to deal with this and Constantine&#x27;s authority was re-established. In early 409 Honorius recognised Constantine as co-emperor. Constantine in turn raised his own oldest son to co-emperor as Constans II.

In 409 Gerontius rebelled, proclaimed his client Maximus emperor and incited barbarian groups in Gaul to rise up. Constans was sent to quash the revolt, but was defeated and withdrew to Arles. Meanwhile, Constantine invaded northern Italy, but his plan failed and he also pulled back to Arles. In 410 Constans was sent to Hispania again. Gerontius had strengthened his army with Germanic tribesmen and defeated Constans; the latter retreated north and was defeated again and killed at Vienne early in 411. Gerontius then besieged Constantine in Arles. Honorius appointed a new general, Constantius, who arrived at Arles while Gerontius was outside the city. Much of Gerontius&#x27;s army deserted to Constantius, who took over the siege. A force attempting to relieve Constantine was ambushed. Constantine abdicated, took holy orders andpromised his lifesurrendered. Constantius had lied: Constantine was killed and his head presented to Honorius on a pole.

==Background==

Following the death of the Roman emperor Theodosius I in 395 the Roman Empire was divided between his two sons: Arcadius became emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire and ten-year-old Honorius of the Western. Honorius was underage and the leading general Stilicho became hugely influential and the de facto commander-in-chief of the Roman armies in the west.

During this period Roman Britain was suffering raids by the Scoti, Saxons and Picts. Sometime between 396 and 398 Stilicho is said by contemporary poet and speech writer Claudian to have ordered a campaign against the Picts, probably a naval campaign intended to suppress their seaborne raids on the east coast of Roman Britain. He may also have ordered campaigns against the Scoti and Saxons. Other interpretations suggest it went badly, or that troops defending Roman Britain defeated a Pictish invasion without external support. This is the last recorded Roman military campaign in Britain. Stilicho sent funds to strengthen the defences along Hadrian&#x27;s Wall and the coastal defences at about the same time.

In 401 or 402 Stilicho needed military manpower for wars with the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths and so stripped Hadrian&#x27;s Wall of troops. The year 402 is the last date from which Roman coinage is found in large quantities in Britain, suggesting the Empire was no longer paying the troops who remained. Meanwhile, the Picts, Saxons and Scoti continued their raids, which may have increased in scope. In 405 the Irish king Niall of the Nine Hostages is described as having raided along the southern coast of Britain.

Both the Eastern and Western Empires were suffering from incursions of large groups from Germanic tribes, whom the Romans referred to generically as &quot;barbarians&quot;. In 406 a group of Alans and Goths led by Radagaisus invaded Italy. The group included women and children and is estimated to have been 90,000–100,000 strong, of whom more than 20,000 were fighting men. For six months they devastated northern Italy, capturing and sacking several cities. After concentrating his forces, Stilicho caught the Goths while they were besieging Florentia (modern Florence) and defeated them at the Battle of Faesulae; 12,000 prisoners joined the Roman army and so many captives were sold that the market in slaves collapsed. The Western Empire&#x27;s problems with barbarian intruders were far from over, however.

==Life==
Little is known of Constantine before he was declared emperor. His date and place of birth are unknown, as is his marital status. He had two sons, although their names prior to being given more regal-sounding ones are likewise unknown. Regarding his personal habits, one fifth-century historian described him as a glutton and another considered that his major flaw was being inconstant in his policies.

===Rise===
In 406 the approximately 6,000 troops of the Roman field army based in Roman Britain were dissatisfied. They had not been paid for several years, a large contingent had left to fight on the continent four years earlier and had not returned, the coastal defences had been dismantled to form the new field army and their commander had been replaced. They revolted and determined to choose their own leader. Their first choice was a man named Marcus, whom they appointed emperor. After a short period, unhappy with his performance, they killed him and appointed Gratian. He also failed to meet the troops&#x27; expectations and was killed after four months. On 31 December 406 several tribes of barbarian invaders, including the Vandals, Sueves and Alans crossed the Rhine, perhaps near Mainz, and overran the Roman defensive works in a successful invasion of the Western Roman Empire. Hearing of the Germanic invasion the Roman military in Britain was desperate for some sense of security in a world that seemed to be rapidly falling apart. They next chose as their leader a man named after the famed emperor of the early fourth century, Constantine the Great, who had himself risen to power through a military coup in Britain. This Constantine was a common soldier, not an officer, and early in 407, possibly February, his fellows acclaimed him as emperor. The modern historian Francisco Sanz-Huesma differs and proposes that Constantine was a skilled politician who engineered the three acclamations with the (successful) intention of eventually raising himself to imperial power. Early coins of Constantine call him &quot;Flavius Claudius Constantinus&quot;, a name he probably adopted because he thought it was that of Constantine the Great, when in fact it was that of his son, Constantine II. The style and legends of these early coins were also copied from those of Constantine II.

Rebellion in Roman Britain was not unusual, a contemporary described it as a &quot;province rich in usurpers&quot;. It was on the periphery of the Empire and there was a common view that it was overlooked in terms of resources and patronage. Such revolts were usually short-lived; Constantine was uncommon in both establishing a lasting power base and in successfully exporting his rebellion to the mainland. Constantine moved quickly: he appointed two officers already in Gaul (modern France) as generals, Justinianus and Nebiogastes, instructing them to seize Arles and the passes which controlled traffic to and from Italy. He crossed the Channel at Bononia (modern Boulogne), taking with him all of the 6,000 or so mobile troops left in Britain and their commander, the general Gerontius. This denuded Roman Britain of front-line military protection and explains the disappearance of the legions in the early fifth century. Constantine travelled to Lyon, where he set up his headquarters and commenced minting coins in his own name. The Roman Army of Gaul declared for him, followed by the civilian administration in Hispania (modern Spain and Portugal). The central Roman authorities did not respond to the Germanic invasion, and Constantine&#x27;s forces got the better of at least one confrontation with the Vandals. Constantine also negotiated agreements with the Germanic groupings of the Franks, Alamanni and the Burgundians, thus securing the line of the Rhine. The main Vandal force and their allies moved into northern Gaul (modern Belgium).
The Western Roman emperor, Honorius, and his commander-in-chief Stilicho were in conflict with the Eastern Roman Empire and allied to a large force of Visigoths under Alaric. The relationship with the Visigoths was shakythey were demanding land or money for their services. An agreement was reached for a joint West Roman-Visigoth army to threaten the Eastern Empire to extort land from it which would then be given to the Visigoths. This manoeuvre was supposed to commence in May or June 407. By then the Vandals and their allies had broken into Gaul, where Constantine had control of the army and was claiming the imperial throne. Sending a large Western Roman force to the east would have left Italy open to invasion by one or both of these groups and so the offensive was cancelled. Instead a small army led by Sarus the Goth was sent west to put down Constantine&#x27;s revolt while Stilicho&#x27;s main army waited on events.

Sarus defeated the army commanded by Justinianus in a pitched battle, killing Justinianus. Constantine personally moved against Sarus, but was besieged in Valence. Nebiogastes attempted to negotiate and was killed by Sarus. Another army, led by Gerontius and Edobichus and largely made up of freshly recruited Franks and Almannics, arrived to relieve Valence after a week of siege. Sarus was forced to retreat into Italy. Central control had deteriorated to the extent that Sarus needed to buy his passage through the Alpine passes from the brigand Bagaudae, who controlled them. With this success Constantine established control over most of Gaul and the Alpine passes into Italy.

===Co-emperor===
By May 408 Constantine had captured Arles and made it his capital, taking over the existing imperial administration and officials, and appointing Apollinaris as chief minister (with the title of ). Heros was installed as a pliant archbishop of Arles in spite of local opposition. Constantine commenced minting large quantities of good quality coins at Arles, possibly using bullion seized from Sarus&#x27;s loot during his hasty retreat, and made a show of being an equal of both the Western and Eastern Emperors.

Constantine&#x27;s oldest son had entered a monastery and was a monk at the time his father rebelled, but he was summoned to the new imperial court. Constantine appointed him to the position of caesara senior, formal position that also recognised him as heir apparentand gave him the imperial-sounding name of Constans. He was swiftly married so a dynasty could be founded. Early in 408 he was sent with Gerontius into Hispania. Hispania was a stronghold of the House of Theodosius, but, on Constantine&#x27;s initial landing on the continent, Honorius&#x27;s relatives and partisans there had been either unwilling or militarily unable to oppose his assumption of control. When Sarus seemed on the verge of ending Constantine&#x27;s revolt, two members of Honorius&#x27;s familyDidymus and Verinianusrebelled and overthrew Constantine&#x27;s regime in Hispania. When Sarus withdrew to Italy, the knowledge of the large new army assembling at Ticinum (modern Pavia) with the intention of shortly engaging Constantine encouraged them to persist and even to attempt to seal the Pyrenean passes. Constantine feared that Honorius&#x27;s cousins would organise an attack from that direction while troops under Sarus and Stilicho attacked him from Italy in a pincer manoeuvre. He struck first, at Hispania. Constans and Gerontius&#x27;s army forced a pass and was reinforced. Constans established himself at Saragossa and rebuilt the civilian administration. Gerontius took the army and decisively defeated Honorius&#x27;s supporters at a battle in Lusitania where Didymus and Verinianus were captured. With Hispania back under Constantine&#x27;s control Constans left his new wife at Saragossa and returned to Arles to report to his father. Didymus and Verinianus accompanied him and were executed as civilian rebels, which further soured relations with Honorius.

By early 408 the Visigoths were running out of patience with Stilicho. They moved from Epirus (modern Albania) to Noricum (modern Austria) and demanded a payment of 4,000 pounds (1,800 kg) of gold on pain of their invading Italy. Honorius and the Roman Senate were prepared to resist, but Stilicho persuaded them to approve the payment to allow him to concentrate on the situation in Gaul. He had assembled an army at Ticinum with which to do this. It is possible that the plan was for the Visigoths to accompany this force as military allies. On 1 May, the emperor of the Eastern Empire, Arcadius, died, leaving a seven-year-old heir, Theodosius II. A disagreement arose between Stilicho and Honorius, who each wished to travel to Constantinoplethe capital of the Eastern Empireto represent the Western Empire&#x27;s interests. Stilicho got his way: He was to leave for the east while Honorius remained in Ravenna, the capital of the Western Empire. But a rift between him and Honorius was obvious. The Roman establishment, led by the senior bureaucrat Olympius, worked to oppose Stilicho by spreading rumours that he wished to travel east to depose Theodosius and set his own son on the throne. On 13 August Honorius was formally reviewing the army about to set out from Ticinum against Constantine. With him were many of the senior officers and officials of the Western Empire. The troops mutinied, slaughtering Stilicho&#x27;s supporters but respecting the person of the Emperor. Stilicho sought sanctuary, then surrendered and was executed on 22 August.
Olympius reversed the policy of making a massive payment to the Visigoths and the native parts of the Army of Italy started slaughtering Goths, especially their fellow soldiers and their wives and children. The latter, living in Italian cities, sometimes overtly as hostages for their husbands&#x27; and fathers&#x27; good behaviour, were easy targets. Those Goths who could fled north and joined Alaric, greatly increasing his fighting strength. Alaric promptly crossed the Alps and headed south through Italy, devastating the countryside. He camped his army outside Rome and demanded a huge ransom. Late in 408 Constantine sent an embassy to Ravenna. Needing to placate him, Honorius acknowledged him as co-emperor and sent a purple robe as formal recognition. The pair were joint consuls in 409. At around this time, Constantine raised Constans to the position of co-emperor, theoretically equal in rank to Honorius or Theodosius, as well as to Constantine.

With the Visigoths deep in Italy and unopposed, Olympius&#x27;s influence ended and a new chief minister, Jovius, entered into peace negotiations but Honorius continued to refuse to reach an agreement with Alaric. The Visigoths in retaliation continued to roam across Italy and extort vast sums from the city of Rome. Alaric elevated his own emperor, the senator Priscus Attalus, to no avail. On 24 August 410 the Visigoths entered Rome and pillaged the city for three days.

===Decline===
In spring or summer 409 Apollinaris was replaced as by Decimus Rusticus and Constans was sent back to Hispania. Either before Constans left Arles or while he was travelling Gerontius rebelled, proclaiming his client Maximus as emperor. Maximus was an important figure in his own right, but it was clear he was controlled by Gerontius. They set up court at Tarraco (modern Tarragona). Gerontius was concerned that he would not be able to withstand the military force Constantine could bring to bear and so attempted to incite the barbarians who had entered Gaul late in 406 against Constantine. These had been quiescent in the north of the territory, but now set off across Gaul for the rich territories of Aquitaine and Narbonensis (modern south-west and southern France). They spread devastation across these areas, much to the horror of the populace. Concentrating on the threat from Constans, Gerontius weakened his garrisons in the Pyrenean passes and in autumn 409 much of the barbarian force entered Hispania. Eventually Gerontius was able to reach a modus operandi with some of these groups whereby they supplied him with military forces, which enabled him to take the offensive against Constantine.

From 408 Saxon pirates raided Roman Britain extensively, undeterred by the totally inadequate force which Constantine had left. The locals organised their own defences, so successfully that they defeated the Saxons in 409. Distressed that Constantine had failed to defend them, the Roman inhabitants of Britain rebelled and expelled his officials, accepting that henceforth they would have to look to their own defence. Inspired by the example of Roman Britain, later that year the Bagaudae of Armorica (modern Brittany) also expelled Constantine&#x27;s officials and declared independence.

Constantine sent a further embassy to Ravenna, which achieved little, but Constantine&#x27;s emissary, Jovius, did suborn one of Honorius&#x27;s senior generals, Allobich. In spring 410 Constantine led an army into northern Italy. It is possible that he claimed he intended to assist Honorius against the Visigoths. It is also likely he was counting on support from Allobich. When he reached the River Po he heard, wrongly, that Allobich was dead, which caused him to abandon his mission and withdraw to Arles.

Meanwhile, Constans, with an army commanded by a general named Justus, attempted to subdue Gerontius. He failed, although no details are known, and returned to Arles in spring 410. At about the same time Constantine returned from his abortive invasion of Italy. Given the difficulties the Visigoths were creating in Italy, Gerontius was considered a greater threat than Honorius. Edobichus was again sent north to raise troops from the Franks while Constans returned to confront Gerontius with a fresh army. Events are again unclear, but it seems likely that Gerontius was simultaneously advancing on Arles. The two armies clashed and Constans was defeated. He fell back to the north with what was left of his command, hoping to be reinforced by Edobichus. But Gerontius caught him at Vienne, probably early in 411, defeated his army and killed Constans. Gerontius&#x27;s army then marched on Arles and besieged Constantine.

===Fall===
In 411 Honorius appointed a new general, Constantius, who took the Army of Italy over the Alps into Gaul in another attempt to suppress Constantine. Constantius arrived at Arles while Gerontius was outside the city. Many of Gerontius&#x27;s troops deserted to Constantius and Gerontius retreated to Hispania with the remainder. There, in a hopeless position, Gerontius committed suicide. Constantius&#x27;s army took over the siege. Meanwhile, Edobichus raised troops in northern Gaul among the Franks and Alamanni, combined them with those of the Army of Gaul still loyal to Constantine and marched to Constantine&#x27;s assistance. Constantius defeated this force in an ambush. Constantine, his hopes fading after the troops guarding the Rhine abandoned him to support yet another claimant to the imperial throne, the Gallo-Roman Jovinus, surrendered to Constantius along with his surviving son Julian. Despite a promise of safe passage, and Constantine&#x27;s assumption of clerical office, Constantius imprisoned the former soldier and had him and Julian beheaded in either August or September 411. His head was mounted on a pole and presented to Emperor Honorius on 18 September. It was later displayed outside Carthage, as was that of Julian.

==Aftermath==

Constantius withdrew in the face of Jovinus&#x27;s forces. The modern historian Peter Heather describes the Roman Army of Gaul as emerging from Constantine&#x27;s wars &quot;in tatters&quot;. In 413 a Visigoth army under Athaulf, who was now allied with Honorius, suppressed Jovinus&#x27;s revolt. Constantius took over Stilicho&#x27;s role as the main power in the Western Empire and generalissimo. He was broadly able to recover the situation for the central authorities and to enable reconstruction. Gaul was pacified, the rebellion in Armorica was quashed and the area brought back under Roman control, the barbarians in Hispania were in large part subdued and the Visigoths were settled on land in Aquitaine as Roman allies. Roman rule never returned to Britain after Constantine stripped its defences. In 417 Constantius married Honorius&#x27;s sister, Galla Placidia. On 8 February 421, Honorius made Constantius co-emperor under himself. Constantius reigned only seven months, dying on 2 September. Honorius then ruled alone until his death in 423, whereupon Constantius&#x27;s son, Valentinian III, assumed the throne.

==Legend==
Constantine III is also known as Constantine II of Britain. He has been associated with the Constantine found in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s popular and imaginative &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, who comes to power following Gracianus Municeps&#x27;s reign. Geoffrey&#x27;s Constantine, through his son Uther Pendragon, becomes the grandfather of the legendary King Arthur. Other sources explicitly state that Constantine III is the grandfather of Arthur.

<text>Life imprisonment is any sentence of imprisonment under which the convicted individual is to remain incarcerated for the rest of their natural life (or until pardoned or commuted to a fixed term). Crimes that result in life imprisonment are considered extremely serious and usually violent. Examples of these crimes are murder, torture, terrorism, child abuse resulting in death, rape, espionage, treason, illegal drug trade, human trafficking, severe fraud and financial crimes, aggravated property damage, arson, hate crime, kidnapping, burglary, robbery, theft, piracy, aircraft hijacking, and genocide.

Common law murder is one of the only crimes in which life imprisonment is mandatory; mandatory life sentences for murder are given in several countries, including some states of the United States and Canada. Life imprisonment (as a maximum term) can also be imposed, in certain countries, for traffic offences causing death. Life imprisonment is not used in all countries; Portugal was the first country to abolish life imprisonment, in 1884, and all other Portuguese-speaking countries also have maximum imprisonment lengths, as well as all Spanish-speaking countries in the Americas except for Cuba, Peru, Argentina, Chile and the Mexican state of Chihuahua. Other countries that do not practice life sentences include Mongolia in Asia and Norway, Iceland, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Andorra and Montenegro in Europe.
Where life imprisonment is a possible sentence, there may also exist formal mechanisms for requesting parole after a certain period of prison time. This means that a convict could be entitled to spend the rest of the sentence (until that individual dies) outside prison. Early release is usually conditional on past and future conduct, possibly with certain restrictions or obligations. In contrast, when a fixed term of imprisonment has ended, the convict is free. The length of time served and the conditions surrounding parole vary. Being eligible for parole does not necessarily ensure that parole will be granted. In some countries, including Sweden, parole does not exist but a life sentence may – after a successful application – be commuted to a fixed-term sentence, after which the offender is released as if the sentence served was that originally imposed.

In many countries around the world, particularly in the Commonwealth, courts have been given the authority to pass prison terms that may amount to &quot;de&quot; &quot;facto&quot; life imprisonment, meaning that the sentence would last longer than the human life expectancy. For example, courts in South Africa have handed out at least two sentences that have exceeded a century, while in Tasmania, Australia, Martin Bryant, the perpetrator of the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, received 35 life sentences plus 1,035 years without parole. In the United States, James Holmes, the perpetrator of the 2012 Aurora theater shooting, received 12 consecutive life sentences plus 3,318 years without the possibility of parole. In the case of mass murder in the US, Parkland mass murderer Nikolas Cruz was sentenced to 34 consecutive terms of life imprisonment (without parole) for murdering 17 people and injuring another 17 at a school. Any sentence without parole effectively means a sentence cannot be suspended; a life sentence without parole, therefore, means that in the absence of unlikely circumstances such as pardon, amnesty or humanitarian grounds (e.g. imminent death), the prisoner will spend the rest of their natural life in prison. In several countries where &quot;de facto&quot; life terms are used, a release on humanitarian grounds (also known as compassionate release) is commonplace, such as in the case of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi. Since the behaviour of a prisoner serving a life sentence without parole is not relevant to the execution of such sentence, many people among lawyers, penitentiary specialists, criminologists, but most of all among human rights organizations oppose that punishment. In particular, they emphasize that when faced with a prisoner with no hope of being released ever, the prison has no means to discipline such a prisoner effectively.

A few countries allow for a minor to be given a life sentence without parole; these include but are not limited to: Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina (only over the age of 16), Australia, Belize, Brunei, Cuba, Dominica, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, the Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, and the United States. According to a University of San Francisco School of Law study, only the U.S. had minors serving such sentences in 2008. In 2009, Human Rights Watch estimated that there were 2,589 youth offenders serving life sentences without the possibility for parole in the U.S. Since the start of 2020, that number has fallen to 1,465. The United States has the highest population of prisoners serving life sentences for both adults and minors, at a rate of 50 people per 100,000 (1 out of 2,000) residents imprisoned for life.

==World view==

==By country ==

In several countries, life imprisonment has been effectively abolished. Many of the countries whose governments have abolished both life imprisonment and indefinite imprisonment have been culturally influenced or colonized by Spain or Portugal and have written such prohibitions into their current constitutional laws (including Portugal itself but not Spain).

===Europe===

A number of European countries have abolished all forms of indefinite imprisonment. Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina each set the maximum prison sentence at 45 years, and Portugal abolished all forms of life imprisonment with the prison reforms of Sampaio e Melo in 1884 and has a maximum sentence of 25 years.

Life imprisonment in Spain was abolished in 1928, but reinstated in 2015 and upheld by the Constitutional Court in 2021. Serbia previously had a maximum prison sentence of 40 years; life imprisonment was instated in 2019 by amendments to the country&#x27;s criminal code, alongside a three-strikes law.

In Europe, there are many jurisdictions where the law expressly provides for life sentences without the possibility of parole. These are England and Wales (within the United Kingdom; see Life imprisonment in England and Wales), the Netherlands, Moldova, Bulgaria, Italy (only for persons who refuse to cooperate with authorities and are sentenced for mafia activities or terrorism), Ukraine, Poland, Turkey, Russia, and Serbia.

In Sweden, although the law does not expressly provide for life without the possibility of release, some convicted persons may never be released, on the grounds that they are too dangerous. In Italy, persons who refuse to cooperate with authorities and are sentenced for mafia activities or terrorism are ineligible for parole and thus will spend the rest of their lives in prison. In Austria, life imprisonment will mean imprisonment for the remainder of the offender&#x27;s life unless clemency is granted by the President of Austria or it can be assumed that the convicted person will not commit any further crimes; the probationary period is ten years. In Malta, prior to 2018, there was previously never any possibility of parole for any person sentenced to life imprisonment, and any form of release from a life sentence was only possible by clemency granted by the President of Malta. In France, while the law does not expressly provide for life imprisonment without any possibility of parole, a court can rule in exceptionally serious circumstances that convicts are ineligible for automatic parole consideration after 30 years if convicted of child murder involving rape or torture, premeditated murder of a state official or terrorism resulting in death. In Moldova, there is never a possibility of parole for anyone sentenced to life imprisonment, as life imprisonment is defined as the &quot;deprivation of liberty of the convict for the entire rest of his/her life&quot;. Where mercy is granted in relation to a person serving life imprisonment, imprisonment thereof must not be less than 30 years. In Ukraine, life imprisonment means for the rest of one&#x27;s life with the only possibilities for release being a terminal illness or a presidential pardon. In Albania, while no person sentenced to life imprisonment is eligible for standard parole, a conditional release is still possible if the prisoner is found not likely to re-offend and has displayed good behaviour, and has served at least 25 years.

Before 2016 in the Netherlands, there was never a possibility of parole for any person sentenced to life imprisonment, and any form of release for life convicted in the country was only possible when granted royal decree by the King of the Netherlands, with the last granting of a pardon taking place in 1986 when a terminally ill convict was released. As of 1970, the Dutch monarch has pardoned a total of three convicts. Although there is no possibility of parole eligibility, since 2016 prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment in the Netherlands are eligible to have their cases reviewed after serving at least 25 years. This change in law was because the European Court of Human Rights stated in 2013 that lifelong imprisonment without the chance of being released is inhuman.

Even in other European countries that do provide for life without parole, courts continue to retain judicial discretion to decide whether a sentence of life should include parole or not. In Albania, the decision of whether or not a life-convicted person is eligible for parole is up to the prison complex after 25 years have been served, and release eligibility depends on the prospect of rehabilitation and how likely they are to re-offend. In Europe, only Ukraine and Moldova explicitly exclude parole or any form of sentence commutation for life sentences in all cases.

===South America===

In South and Central America, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Colombia, Uruguay, Bolivia, Ecuador, and the Dominican Republic have all abolished life imprisonment. The maximum sentence is 75 years in El Salvador, 60 years in Colombia, 50 years in Costa Rica and Panama, 40 years in Honduras and Brazil, 30 years in Nicaragua, Bolivia, Uruguay, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic, and 25 years in Paraguay and Ecuador.

===Canada===
===United States===
In 2011, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that sentencing minors to life without parole, automatically (as the result of a statute) or as the result of a judicial decision, for crimes other than intentional homicide, violated the Eighth Amendment&#x27;s ban on &quot;Cruel and unusual punishments&quot;, in the case of &quot;Graham v. Florida&quot;.

&quot;Graham v. Florida&quot; was a significant case in juvenile justice. In Jacksonville, Florida, Terrence J. Graham tried to rob a restaurant along with three adolescent accomplices. During the robbery, one of Graham&#x27;s accomplices had a metal bar that he used to hit the restaurant manager twice in the head. Once arrested, Graham was charged with attempted armed robbery and armed burglary with assault/battery. The maximum sentence he faced for these charges was life without the possibility of parole, and the prosecutor wanted to charge him as an adult. During the trial, Graham pleaded guilty to the charges, resulting in three years of probation, one year of which had to be served in jail. Since he had been awaiting trial in jail, he already served six months and, therefore, was released after six additional months.

Within six months of his release, Graham was involved in another robbery. Since he violated the conditions of his probation, his probation officer reported to the trial court about his probation violations a few weeks before Graham turned 18 years old. It was a different judge presiding over his trial for the probation violations a year later. While Graham denied any involvement in the robbery, he did admit to fleeing from the police. The trial court found that Graham violated his probation by &quot;committing a home invasion robbery, possessing a firearm, and associating with persons engaged in criminal activity&quot;, and sentenced him to 15 years for the attempted armed robbery plus life imprisonment for the armed burglary. The life sentence Graham received meant he had a life sentence without the possibility of parole, &quot;because Florida abolished their parole system in 2003&quot;.

Graham&#x27;s case was presented to the Supreme Court of the United States, with the question of whether juveniles should receive life without the possibility of parole in non-homicide cases. The Justices eventually ruled that such a sentence violated the juvenile&#x27;s 8th Amendment rights, protecting them from punishments that are disproportionate to the crime committed, resulting in the abolition of life sentences without the possibility of parole in non-homicide cases for juveniles.

In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled in the case of &quot;Miller v. Alabama&quot; in a 5–4 decision and with the majority opinion written by Associate Justice Elena Kagan that mandatory sentences of life in prison without parole for juvenile offenders are unconstitutional. The majority opinion stated that barring a judge from considering mitigating factors and other information, such as age, maturity, and family and home environment violated the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Sentences of life in prison without parole can still be given to juveniles for aggravated first-degree murder, as long as the judge considers the circumstances of the case.

In 2016 the Supreme Court ruled in the case of &quot;Montgomery v. Louisiana&quot; that the rulings imposed by &quot;Miller v. Alabama&quot; were to apply retroactively, causing a substantial amount of appeals to decade-old sentences for then-juvenile offenders. 

In 2021, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Jones v. Mississippi&quot; that sentencers are not required to make a separate finding of the defendant to be &quot;permanently incorrigible&quot; prior to sentencing a juvenile to life without parole.

===Vatican City===

Pope Francis called for the abolition of both capital punishment and life imprisonment in a meeting with representatives of the International Association of Penal Law. He also stated that life imprisonment, removed from the Vatican City penal code in 2013, is just a variation of the death penalty.

===Malaysia===
Originally in Malaysia, life imprisonment was construed as a jail term lasting the remainder of a convict&#x27;s natural life, either with or without the possibility of parole. In April 2023, the Malaysian government officially abolished natural life imprisonment and instead redefined a life sentence as a jail term between 30 and 40 years. At the time of the reform, at least 117 prisoners were serving natural life imprisonment, consisting of 70 whose original death sentences were commuted to life (without parole) prior to the reform, and another 47 whose sentences of life were imposed by the courts, and all of these life convicts were allowed to have their jail terms reduced to between 30 and 40 years in jail. In November 2023, four drug traffickers - Zulkipli Arshad, Wan Yuriilhami Wan Yaacob, Ghazalee Kasim and Mohamad Junaidi Hussin - became the first group of people to have their natural life sentences reduced to 30 years’ imprisonment after a re-sentencing hearing by the Federal Court of Malaysia, which was followed by many more such commutations in the months to come.

===Singapore===

In Singapore, before 20 August 1997, the law decreed that life imprisonment is a fixed sentence of 20 years with the possibility of one-third reduction of the sentence (13 years and 4 months) for good behaviour. It was an appeal by Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah on 20 August 1997 that led to the law in Singapore to change the definition of life imprisonment into a sentence that lasts the remainder of the prisoner&#x27;s natural life, with the possibility of parole after at least 20 years. Abdul Nasir was a convicted robber and kidnapper who was, in two separate High Court trials, sentenced to 18 years&#x27; imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane for robbery with hurt resulting in a female Japanese tourist&#x27;s death at Oriental Hotel in 1994 and a consecutive sentence of life imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane for kidnapping two police officers for ransom in 1996, which totalled up to 38 years&#x27; imprisonment and 30 strokes of the cane.

Abdul Nasir&#x27;s appeal for the two sentences to run concurrently led to the Court of Appeal of Singapore, which dismissed Abdul Nasir&#x27;s appeal, to decide that it would be wrong to consider life imprisonment as a fixed jail term of 20 years and thus changed it to a jail term to be served for the rest of the prisoner&#x27;s remaining lifespan. The amended definition is applied to future crimes committed after 20 August 1997. Since Abdul Nasir committed the crime of kidnapping and was sentenced before 20 August 1997, his life sentence remained as a prison term of 20 years and thus he still had to serve 38 years behind bars.

The appeal of Abdul Nasir, titled &quot;Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v Public Prosecutor&quot; [1997] SGCA 38, was since regarded as a landmark in Singapore&#x27;s legal history as it changed the definition of life imprisonment from &quot;life&quot; to &quot;natural life&quot; under the law.

<text>Publius Helvius Pertinax ( ; 1 August 126 – 28 March 193) was Roman emperor for the first three months of 193. He succeeded Commodus to become the first emperor during the tumultuous Year of the Five Emperors.

Born to the son of a freed slave, Pertinax became an officer in the army. He fought in the Roman–Parthian War of 161–166, where his success led to higher positions in both the military and political spheres. He achieved the rank of provincial governor and urban prefect. He was a member of the Roman Senate, serving at the same time as the historian Cassius Dio.

Following the death of Commodus, Pertinax was proclaimed emperor. He instituted several short-lived reform measures, including the restoration of discipline among the Praetorian Guard. This led to resistance that culminated in Pertinax&#x27;s assassination by the Guard. Pertinax would later be deified by the emperor Septimius Severus. His historical reputation has been largely positive, in line with Cassius Dio&#x27;s assessment.

==Early life==
His career before becoming emperor is documented in the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; as well as Cassius Dio&#x27;s &quot;History of Rome&quot;, and confirmed in many places by existing inscriptions. He was born in Alba Pompeia in Italy, the son of freedman Helvius Successus. Cassius Dio writes that Helvius was not of noble birth but was at least able to earn enough money to allow Pertinax education to gain a livelihood. Through this as well as patronage from Lucius Avitus (or Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus according to Dio), Pertinax was commissioned as an officer in a cohort.

In the Parthian War that followed, he distinguished himself, which resulted in a string of promotions, and after postings in Britain (as military tribune of the Legio VI &quot;Victrix&quot;) and along the Danube, he served as a procurator in Dacia. He suffered a setback as a victim of court intrigues during the reign of Marcus Aurelius, but shortly afterwards, he was recalled to assist Claudius Pompeianus in the Marcomannic Wars. In 175, he received the honour of a suffect consulship and until 185, Pertinax was governor of the provinces of Upper and Lower Moesia, Dacia, Syria, and finally governor of Britain.

During the 180s, Pertinax took a pivotal role in the Roman Senate until the praetorian prefect Sextus Tigidius Perennis forced him out of public life. He was recalled after three years to Britain, where the Roman army was in a state of mutiny. He tried to quell the unruly soldiers there but one legion attacked his bodyguard, leaving Pertinax for dead. When he was forced to resign in 187, the reason given was that the legions had grown hostile to him because of his harsh rule.

He served as proconsul of Africa from 188 to 189, and followed this term of service with the urban prefecture of Rome, and a second consulship as ordinarius with the emperor Commodus as his colleague.

==Emperor==

When Commodus&#x27; actions became increasingly erratic in the early 190s, a conspiracy led to his assassination on 31 December 192. The plot was carried out by the Praetorian prefect Quintus Aemilius Laetus, Commodus&#x27; mistress Marcia, and his chamberlain Eclectus. After the murder had been carried out, Pertinax, who was serving as urban prefect at this time, was hurried to the Praetorian Camp and proclaimed emperor. His short reign of 87 days was an uneasy one. He attempted to emulate the restrained practices of Marcus Aurelius and made an effort to reform the &quot;alimenta&quot;, but he faced antagonism from many quarters.

Ancient writers detail how the Praetorian Guard expected a generous &quot;donativum&quot; on his ascension, and when they were disappointed, agitated until he produced the money, selling off Commodus&#x27; property, including the concubines and youths Commodus kept for his sexual pleasures. He reformed the Roman currency dramatically, increasing the silver purity of the denarius from 74% to 87% – the actual silver weight increasing from 2.22 grams to 2.75 grams.

Pertinax attempted to impose stricter military discipline upon the pampered Praetorians. In early March he narrowly averted one conspiracy by a group to replace him with the consul Quintus Sosius Falco while he was in Ostia inspecting the arrangements for grain shipments. The plot was betrayed; Falco himself was pardoned but several of the officers behind the coup were executed.

On 28 March 193, Pertinax was at his palace when, according to the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, a contingent of some three hundred soldiers of the Praetorian Guard rushed the gates (two hundred according to Cassius Dio). Ancient sources suggest that they had received only half their promised pay. Neither the guards on duty nor the palace officials chose to resist them. Pertinax sent Laetus to meet them, but he chose to side with the insurgents instead and deserted the emperor.

Although advised to flee, Pertinax then attempted to reason with the insurgents and was almost successful before being struck down by one of the soldiers. Pertinax must have been aware of the danger he faced by assuming the purple, for he refused to use imperial titles for either his wife or son, thereby protecting them from the aftermath of his own assassination.

==Aftermath==

After Pertinax&#x27;s death, the Praetorians auctioned off the imperial title; the winner was the wealthy senator Didius Julianus, whose reign would end mere weeks later with his assassination on 1 June 193. Julianus was succeeded by Septimius Severus. After he entered Rome, Septimius recognized Pertinax as a legitimate emperor, executed the soldiers who had killed him, and not only pressured the Senate to deify him and provide him a state funeral, but also adopted his &quot;cognomen&quot; of &quot;Pertinax&quot; as part of his own name. For some time, he held games on the anniversary of Pertinax&#x27;s accession and on his birthday.

==Historical reputation==
Pertinax&#x27;s historical reputation is largely a positive one, beginning with the assessment of Cassius Dio, a historian and senator who was a colleague of Pertinax. Dio refers to him as &quot;an excellent and upright man&quot; who displayed &quot;not only humaneness and integrity in the imperial administrations, but also the most economical management and the most careful consideration for the public welfare&quot;.

Dio&#x27;s approval is not unqualified, however. He acknowledges that while some would call Pertinax&#x27;s decision to confront the soldiers that would wind up killing him &quot;noble&quot;, others would call it &quot;senseless&quot;. He is also critical of Pertinax&#x27;s judgment when it came to the speed with which he tried to reform the excesses of the reign of Commodus by suggesting that a more tempered approach would have been less likely to result in his murder.

Pertinax is discussed in &quot;The Prince&quot; by Niccolò Machiavelli. Discussing the importance of a prince not being hated, Machiavelli provides Pertinax as an example of how it is as easy for a ruler to be hated for good actions as for bad ones. Though describing him as a good man, Machiavelli considered Pertinax&#x27;s attempt to reform a soldiery that had become &quot;accustomed to live licentiously&quot; a mistake, as it inspired their hatred of him, which led to his overthrow and death.

Pertinax is described in David Hume&#x27;s essay &quot;Of the Original Contract&quot; as an &quot;excellent prince&quot; possessing an implied modesty when, on the arrival of soldiers who had come to proclaim him emperor, he believed that Commodus had ordered his death.

During the debate over ratification of the United States Constitution, Virginia politician John Dawson, at his state&#x27;s ratifying convention in 1788, spoke of the &quot;atrocious murder&quot; of Pertinax by the Praetorian Guard as an example of the danger of establishing a standing army.

==In popular culture==
Pertinax was the pseudonym of the French journalist André Géraud (1882–1974).

In &quot;&quot;Romanitas&quot;&quot;, a fictional alternate history novel by Sophia McDougall, Pertinax&#x27;s reign is the point of divergence. In the history as established by the novel, the plot against Pertinax was thwarted, and Pertinax introduced a series of reforms that would consolidate the Roman Empire to such a degree that it would still be a major power in the 21st century.

<doc id="148683" wikidata="Q1440" url="?curid=148683" title="Didius Julianus">
<text>Marcus Didius Julianus (; 29 January 133 – 2 June 193) was Roman emperor from March to June 193, during the Year of the Five Emperors. Julianus had a promising political career, governing several provinces, including Dalmatia and Germania Inferior, and defeated the Chauci and Chatti, two invading Germanic tribes. He was even appointed to the consulship in 175 along with Pertinax as a reward, before being demoted by Commodus. After this demotion, his early, promising political career languished.

Julianus ascended the throne after buying it from the Praetorian Guard, who had assassinated his predecessor Pertinax. A civil war ensued in which three rival generals laid claim to the imperial throne. Septimius Severus, commander of the legions in Pannonia and the nearest of the generals to Rome, marched on the capital, gathering support along the way and routing cohorts of the Praetorian Guard Julianus sent to meet him. Abandoned by the Senate and the Praetorian Guard, Julianus was killed by a soldier in the palace and succeeded by Severus.

== Early life ==

Julianus was born to Quintus Petronius Didius Severus and Aemilia Clara. His father came from a prominent family in Mediolanum, modern-day Milan, and his mother was a North African woman of Roman descent, from a family of consular rank. His brothers were Didius Proculus and Didius Nummius Albinus. His date of birth was 29 January, the year was 133 according to Cassius Dio and 137 by the less reliable &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;. Didius Julianus was raised by Domitia Calvilla, mother of the emperor Marcus Aurelius. With Domitia&#x27;s help, he was appointed at a very early age to the &quot;vigintivirate&quot;, the first step towards public distinction. He married a Roman woman named Manlia Scantilla, and sometime around 153, they had a daughter, Didia Clara, their only child.

== Imperial service ==

In succession Julianus held the offices of quaestor and aedile, and then, around 162, was named as praetor. He was nominated to the command of the Legio XXII Primigenia in Mogontiacum (now Mainz). In 170, he became praefectus of Gallia Belgica and served for five years. After repelling an invasion by the Chauci, a tribe dwelling in the drainage basin of the river Weser, the northwestern coastal area of present-day Germany, he was raised to the consulship in 175 along with Pertinax. He further distinguished himself in a campaign against the Chatti, governed Dalmatia and Germania Inferior. He was then made prefect, charged with distributing money to the poor of Italy. Modern historians generally consider this a demotion for political reasons, as Commodus, the Roman Emperor at the time, feared Julianus&#x27; growing power. It was around this time that he was charged with having conspired against the life of Commodus, but the jury acquitted him and instead punished his accuser. Afterwards, he governed Bithynia and succeeded Pertinax as the proconsul of North Africa.

== Emperor ==

=== Rise to power ===

After the murder of Pertinax on 28 March 193, the Praetorian guard announced that the throne was to be sold to the man who would pay the highest price. Titus Flavius Claudius Sulpicianus, prefect of Rome and Pertinax&#x27;s father-in-law, who was in the Praetorian camp ostensibly to calm the troops, began making offers for the throne. Meanwhile, Julianus also arrived at the camp, and since his entrance was barred, shouted out offers to the guard. After hours of bidding, Sulpicianus promised 20,000 sesterces to every soldier; Julianus, fearing that Sulpicianus would gain the throne, then offered 25,000. The guards closed with the offer of Julianus, threw open the gates, and proclaimed him emperor. Threatened by the military, the Senate also declared him emperor. His wife and his daughter both received the title Augusta.

=== Reign and opposition ===

Upon his accession, Julianus immediately reversed Pertinax&#x27;s monetary reforms by devaluing the Roman currency. Pertinax had increased the silver content of the denarius to 87%, whereas Didius Julianus ordered it reduced to 75%, nearly the adulterated amount that was present during the reign of Commodus. Because Julianus bought his position rather than acquiring it conventionally through succession or conquest, he was a deeply unpopular emperor. When Julianus appeared in public, he frequently was greeted with groans and shouts of &quot;robber and parricide&quot;. Once, a mob even obstructed his progress to the Capitol by pelting him with large stones. When news of the public anger in Rome spread across the Empire, three influential generals, Pescennius Niger in Syria, Septimius Severus in Pannonia, and Clodius Albinus in Britain, each able to muster three legions, rebelled. They refused to accept Julianus&#x27; authority as emperor and instead each declared himself emperor. Julianus declared Severus a public enemy because he was the nearest of the three to Rome, making him the most dangerous foe. Julianus sent senators to persuade Severus&#x27; legionaries to abandon him, a new general was nominated to replace him, and a centurion dispatched to take Severus&#x27; life.

The Praetorian Guard had rarely fought in field battles, so Julianus marched them into the Campus Martius and drilled the guard in the construction of fortifications and field works. Despite this training, the Praetorian Guard was still undertrained compared to the field legionaries of Severus. Severus first secured the support of Albinus, declaring him Caesar, and then seized Ravenna and its fleet. Severus killed Tullius Crispinus, the Praetorian prefect, who was sent to negotiate with Severus and slow his march on Rome, and won over to his cause the ambassadors sent to turn his troops. Cassius Dio maintained that the Praetorian Guard tried to fight back, but were crushed, while modern historians believe that the Praetorian Guard simply abandoned Julianus, deserting &quot;en masse&quot;.

Julianus attempted to negotiate with Severus, offering to share the empire with his rival, but Severus ignored these overtures and pressed forward. As he marched, more and more cities in Italy supported his claim to the throne. The remnants of the Praetorian Guard received pardons from Severus in exchange for surrendering the actual murderers of Pertinax. After seizing the ringleaders and killing them, the soldiers reported what they had done to Marcus Silius Messala, the consul, who summoned the senate to inform them of the proceedings. The Senate passed a motion proclaiming Severus emperor, awarded divine honours to Pertinax, and sentenced Julianus to death. Julianus was deserted by all except one of the prefects and his son-in-law, Cornelius Repentinus.

=== Death ===

Julianus was killed in the palace by a soldier on 2 June 193 AD, after a mere 66 days of ruling. According to the contemporary Roman historian Cassius Dio, Julianus&#x27; last words were: &quot;But what evil have I done? Whom have I killed?&quot; His body was given to his wife and daughter, who buried it in his great-grandfather&#x27;s tomb by the fifth milestone on the Via Labicana. The Senate passed a &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; motion to condemn Julianus and his legacy. Severus dismissed the Praetorian Guard and executed the soldiers who had killed Pertinax, the previous emperor.

== Legacy ==

Julianus repelled invasions by the Chatti and the Chauci, both of which helped protect Rome&#x27;s border provinces. In the long run, the two tribes he repelled were but the harbingers of far larger Germanic migrations that would only truly finish in the sixth century AD. From arguably the reign of M. Aurelius, Rome would be constantly subject to incursions from the descendants of these tribes (see Crisis of the Third Century and Migration Period). As emperor, Didius Julianus was unable to pass any major policy reforms in his short reign other than currency devaluation. While the currency devaluation was comparatively minor, he restarted the trend of devaluing the Roman currency which had abated under Pertinax&#x27;s reign. The trend he started, which would continue under the Severan dynasty on a far larger scale, destroyed confidence in Rome&#x27;s currency, led to rampant hyperinflation, and caused widespread economic upheaval. Moreover, his blatant purchase of the throne shattered any illusions of normalcy in the Roman Empire.

== Popular culture ==

In the movie &quot;The Fall of The Roman Empire&quot;, Julianus is played by Eric Porter and depicted as a scheming henchman of Commodus. At the end of the movie, Julianus and Pescennius Niger, played by Douglas Wilmer, another crony of Commodus, compete against each other in the auction for the throne of Rome.

Julianus&#x27; accession and short reign are alluded to in the novel &quot;The Business&quot; by Scottish writer Iain Banks.

<text>Karl Artur Vilhelm Moberg (20 August 1898 – 8 August 1973) was a Swedish journalist, author, playwright, historian, and debater. His literary career, spanning more than 45 years, is associated with his four‑volume series &quot;The Emigrants&quot;. The novels, published between 1949 and 1959, deal with the Swedish emigration to the United States in the 19th century. They have been adapted for a total of three movies (two in the 1970s and one in 2021), and a musical. 

Among his other works are &quot;Raskens&quot; (1927) and &quot;Ride This Night&quot; (1941), a historical novel of a 17th‑century rebellion in Småland, acknowledged for its subliminal but widely recognised criticism of the Hitler regime.

A prominent public intellectual and debater in Sweden, Moberg was recognized for his vocal criticism of the Swedish monarchy (most notably after the Haijby affair), describing it as a servile government by divine mandate, and publicly supporting its replacement with a Swiss‑style confederal republic. He spoke out aggressively against the policies of Nazi Germany, the Greek military junta, and the Soviet Union, and his works were among those destroyed in Nazi book burnings. In 1971, he scolded Prime Minister Olof Palme for refusing to present the Nobel Prize in Literature to its recipient Alexander Solzhenitsyn – who was refused permission to attend the ceremony in Stockholm – through the Swedish embassy in Moscow.

Moberg&#x27;s suicide by self‑inflicted drowning drew much attention. He had had a long struggle with depression and writer&#x27;s block.

==Early life==
Karl Artur Vilhelm Moberg was born in 1898 on a farm outside of the town Emmaboda in the Parish of Algutsboda in Småland, in southern Sweden. He was the fourth child of six, of whom only three survived into adulthood. His forebears were soldiers and small farmers. He lived the first nine years of his life at the tenement soldier&#x27;s cottage in Moshultamåla that his father Karl Moberg, a territorial soldier, took over in 1888. 

In 1907 the family moved to a small farm in the village of Moshultamåla. This had been the family home of his mother Ida Moberg; they had lost it due to poverty. Money from her family in America enabled them to buy the property back. Moberg had only limited schooling from 1906 until 1912. However, as a child he was an avid reader; he published his first writing at the age of 13.

Moberg worked as a farmer and forest laborer, and later at glassblowing before and between his various studies. In 1916 he nearly emigrated to the United States, following his uncle and aunt, but ultimately decided to remain in Sweden with his parents. Largely self‑educated, Moberg studied at Kronoberg County Folk High School in Grimslöv from 1916 to 1917, and at Katrineholms Praktiska Skola, a private school in Katrineholm, from 1917 to 1918. Moberg contracted the Spanish flu in 1918, and was sick for half a year. After his illness, Moberg took a position on the newspaper &quot;Vadstena Läns Tidning&quot; in Östergötland, which published many of his stories between 1919 and 1929.

In 1926, Moberg made his breakthrough as a playwright when his comedy &quot;Kassabrist&quot; had a successful run in Stockholm. He published his first novel &quot;Raskens&quot; the following year. Moberg became a full‑time writer when the financial success of &quot;Raskens&quot; enabled him to devote himself entirely to writing.

==Author==

Many of his works have been translated into English, and he is well‑recognized in the English‑speaking world among those interested in Scandinavian culture and history. In his autobiographical novel, &quot;A Soldier with a Broken Rifle&quot; (Swedish: &quot;Soldat med brutet gevär&quot;), he speaks to the importance of giving voice to the downtrodden, illiterate classes of his forebears. This viewpoint also formed his &quot;History of the Swedish People, I–II&quot; (Swedish: &quot;Min svenska historia, berättad för folket&quot;, I–II), published in 1970–71 in both Swedish and English. He had intended the history to have more volumes, but he never finished it.

As a playwright, Moberg wrote 38 works for the stage or for radio (1919–1973). Some were produced as lighter classics of the Swedish stage and television, or were adapted as feature films by directors such as Ingmar Bergman (&quot;Lea och Rakel&quot;/&quot;Leah and Rachel&quot;; Malmö City Theatre 1955) and Alf Sjöberg (&quot;Domaren&quot;/&quot;The Judge&quot;; 1960).

==Social themes==
Moberg had become a member of a young Social Democrats club in 1913. In his works, he often expressed a republican (anti‑royalist) point of view. He was strongly influenced by the facts that surfaced in the Kejne affair and Haijby affair, in which Moberg took an active part.

From the 1950s, Moberg participated in debates about the Swedish monarchy, bureaucracy, and corruption. In addition, he devoted much time to help individual citizens who had suffered injustice. Much like others of his generation of Swedish authors from a working‑class background, such as Ivar Lo‐Johansson, Harry Martinson and Moa Martinson, Moberg depicted the life of the dispossessed, their traditions, customs, and everyday struggle. His novels are important documents of social history, and trace the influences of various social and political movements in Sweden.
==&quot;The Emigrants&quot; series==

Moberg&#x27;s most famous work is &quot;The Emigrants&quot; series of four novels, written between 1949 and 1959, that describe one Swedish family&#x27;s emigration from Småland to Chisago County, Minnesota in the mid‑19th century. This was a destiny shared by almost one million Swedish people, including several of the author&#x27;s relatives. These novels have been translated into English: &quot;The Emigrants&quot; (1951), &quot;Unto a Good Land&quot; (1954), &quot;The Settlers&quot; (1961), and &quot;The Last Letter Home&quot; (1961). His literary portrayal of the Swedish‑American immigrant experience is considered comparable to Ole Edvart Rølvaag&#x27;s work depicting that of Norwegian‑American immigrants. 

From 1948 to 1960, Moberg lived in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. While there he wrote the popular &quot;The Emigrants&quot; series. 

The Vilhelm Moberg House is located on Carmel Point at 2423 San Antonio Avenue, near Isabella &amp; Martin Way. Moberg also lived for a time in the guesthouse of Gustaf Lannestock, his friend and translator, at 26085 Scenic Road.

===Films and musical===
Swedish film director Jan Troell in 1971–72 adapted the books into two major feature films, &quot;The Emigrants&quot; (based on the first two novels) and &quot;The New Land&quot; (based on the second two), both starring Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann as Karl Oskar and Kristina. These were nominated for several Academy Awards, and &quot;The New Land&quot; won Golden Globe Awards.

The musical &quot;Kristina från Duvemåla&quot; (English title &quot;Kristina&quot;) (1995) by ex‑ABBA members Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson is based on Moberg&#x27;s &quot;The Emigrants Series&quot;.

A later film adaptation, known simply as &quot;The Emigrants&quot; was released in 2021, and in August 2022 on digital platforms.

Several other works by Moberg have been turned into films and TV series in Sweden over the years.
==Moberg Room==
Moberg donated his papers to the Swedish Emigrant Institute in Växjö, Sweden, It displays his original manuscripts, excerpts, notes, and photographs in The Moberg Room, in such a way that visitors get a feeling of meeting Vilhelm Moberg in his workshop. This unique collection of Moberg memorabilia includes Axel Olsson&#x27;s sculpture entitled &quot;The Emigrants&quot;, which portrays the main characters featured in &quot;The Emigrants Series&quot;. The Vilhelm Moberg Society, headquartered in the Swedish Emigrant Institute, promotes publications, research and popular interest in Moberg&#x27;s works.

==Later life==
Moberg struggled with severe depression in the last years of his life. He committed suicide by drowning himself in the sea outside his house. He left a note to his wife saying: &quot;The time is twenty past seven; I go to seek in the sea the eternal sleep. Forgive me, I could not endure.&quot; Moberg was buried in Norra begravningsplatsen in Stockholm.

Klockan är tjugo över sju. Jag går att söka i sjön, sömnen utan slut. Förlåt mig, jag orkade inte uthärda.

<text>Tefillin (Israeli Hebrew: / ; ; ), or phylacteries, are a set of small black leather boxes with leather straps containing scrolls of parchment inscribed with verses from the Torah. Tefillin are worn by adult Jews during weekday and Sunday morning prayers. In Orthodox and traditional communities, they are worn solely by men, while some Reform and Conservative (Masorti) communities allow them to be worn by Jewish adults regardless of gender. In Jewish law (halacha), women are exempt from most time-dependent positive commandments, which include tefillin, and unlike other time-dependent positive commandments, most halachic authorities prohibit them from fulfilling this commandment.

Although &quot;tefillin&quot; is technically the plural form (the singular being &quot;tefillah&quot;), it is often used as a singular as well. The arm-tefillah (or &quot;shel yad&quot; [literally &quot;of the hand&quot;]) is placed on the upper (non-dominant) arm, and the strap wrapped around the forelimb, hand and middle finger; while the head-tefillah (or &quot;shel rosh&quot; [literally &quot;of the head&quot;]) is placed between the eyes at the boundary of the forehead and hair. They are intended to fulfill the Torah&#x27;s instructions to maintain a continuous &quot;sign&quot; and &quot;remembrance&quot; of the Exodus from Egypt. While historically men used to wear tefillin all day, this is no longer common. The general practice today is to remove them following services.

The biblical verses often cited as referring to tefillin are obscure. Deuteronomy , for instance, does not designate explicitly what specifically to &quot;bind upon your arm&quot;, and the definition of &quot;&quot;totafot&quot; between your eyes&quot; is not obvious. These details are delineated in the Oral Torah. At least as early as the , many Jews understood the verses literally and wore physical tefillin, as shown by archaeological finds at Qumran and a reference in Matthew 23 of the Christian New Testament. However, Karaite Judaism understands the verses to be metaphorical.

== Biblical source ==
The obligation of tefillin is mentioned four times in the Torah: twice when recalling The Exodus from Egypt:
and twice in the shema passages:

== Etymology ==
In the Bible, &quot;tefillin&quot; are referred to as , the plural of טוֹטֶפֶת &quot;ṭoṭepheth&quot;, meaning &quot;headband, frontlet&quot;. Jeffrey H. Tigay argued that the word טוֹטֶפֶת &quot;ṭoṭepheth&quot; originally meant &quot;headband&quot;, as ornamental bands encircling the head were common among Levantine populations in the biblical period. The scholarly consensus is that טוֹטֶפֶת &quot;ṭoṭepheth&quot; is derived from a reduplicated root &quot;ṭ-p-ṭ-p&quot; meaning &quot;to encircle&quot; (related to Arabic &quot;ṭāfa&quot; &quot;go around, encirlce, encompass&quot;) with the feminine suffix -&quot;t.&quot;

Interestingly, Rabbi Akiva argued the word טוֹטֶפֶת &quot;ṭoṭepheth&quot; to be a combination of two foreign words: meant &quot;two&quot; in the Coptic language and meant &quot;two&quot; in the &quot;Afriki&quot; language, hence, and means &quot;two and two&quot;, corresponding to the four compartments of the head-tefillin. This would appear to be an early attempt at etymology. Menahem ben Saruq explains that the word is derived from the Hebrew and , both expressions meaning &quot;speech&quot;, &quot;for when one sees the tefillin it causes him to remember and speak about the Exodus from Egypt&quot;. 

The first texts to use the word תְּפִלִּין‎ &quot;tefillin&quot; are the Targumim and Peshitta and it is also used in subsequent Talmudic literature. תְּפִלִּין‎ &quot;tefillin&quot; is the Mishnaic Hebrew plural of תְּפִלָּה &quot;tefillah&quot;, used in rabbinic literature to individuate a single phylactary. Jastrow connects תְּפִלִּין‎ &quot;tefillin&quot; with Syriac תפלתא &quot;attachment, hangings&quot;, in which case &quot;tefillin&quot; would represent the Aramaic equivalent of טוֹטֶפֶת &quot;ṭoṭepheth.&quot; Its resemblance to Hebrew &quot;prayer&quot; is wholly coincidental.

The English word &quot;&quot; (&quot;phylacteries&quot; in the plural) derives from Ancient Greek ( in the plural), meaning &quot;guarded post, safeguard, security&quot;, and in later Greek, &quot;amulet&quot; or &quot;charm&quot;. The word &quot;phylactery&quot; occurs once (in ) in the Greek New Testament, whence it has passed into the languages of Europe. But neither Aquila nor Symmachus uses &quot;phylacteries&quot; in their translations.

==Purpose==
The tefillin are to serve as a reminder of God&#x27;s intervention at the time of the Exodus from Egypt. Maimonides details of the sanctity of tefillin and writes that &quot;as long as the tefillin are on the head and on the arm of a man, he is modest and God-fearing and will not be attracted by hilarity or idle talk; he will have no evil thoughts, but will devote all his thoughts to truth and righteousness&quot;. The &quot;Sefer ha-Chinuch&quot; (14th century) adds that the purpose of tefillin is to help subjugate a person&#x27;s worldly desires and encourage spiritual development. Joseph Caro (16th century) explains that tefillin are placed on the arm adjacent to the heart and on the head above the brain to demonstrate that these two major organs are willing to perform the service of God.

Many have the custom to have high-quality tefillin and beautiful tefillin bags as a hiddur mitzvah. This idea comes from the verse &quot;This is my God and I will glorify Him&quot; (). The Jewish Sages explain: &quot;Is it possible for a human being to add glory to his Creator? What this really means is: I shall glorify Him in the way I perform mitzvot. I shall prepare before Him a beautiful lulav, beautiful sukkah, beautiful fringes (Tsitsit), and beautiful phylacteries (Tefilin).&quot;

Some non-Orthodox scholars think that tefillin may play an apotropaic function. For instance, Yehudah B. Cohn argues that the &quot;tefillin&quot; should be perceived as an invented tradition aimed at counteracting the popularity of the Greek amulets with an &quot;original&quot; Jewish one. Joshua Trachtenberg considered every ornament worn on the body (whatever its declared function) as initially serving the purpose of an amulet. 

In addition, the early Rabbinic sources furnish more or less explicit examples of the apotropaic qualities of tefillin. For instance, Numbers Rabbah 12:3 presents tefillin as capable of defeating &quot;a thousand demons&quot; emerging on &quot;the left side&quot;, rabbis Yohanan and Nahman used their sets to repel the demons inhabiting privies, whereas Elisha the Winged, who was scrupulous in performing this mitzvah, was miraculously saved from the Roman persecution. Also, tefillin are believed to possess life-lengthening qualities, and they are often listed in one breath among various items which are considered amuletic in nature. Though &quot;tefillin&quot; are sometimes mentioned together with amulets in the Talmud due to certain similarities of form, they are never identified as such, but specifically differentiated from them.

== Manufacture and contents ==

The manufacturing processes of tefillin are intricate and governed by hundreds of detailed rules.

===Boxes===
In earlier Talmudic times, tefillin were either cylindrical or cubical, but later the cylindrical form became obsolete. Nowadays the boxes should be fashioned from a single piece of animal hide and form a base with an upper compartment to contain the parchment scrolls. They are made in varying levels of quality. The most basic form, called &quot;peshutim&quot; (&quot;simple&quot;), are made using several pieces of parchment to form the inner walls of the head tefillin. The higher quality tefillin, namely &quot;dakkot&quot; (&quot;thin&quot;), made by stretching a thin piece of leather, and the more durable &quot;gassot&quot; (&quot;thick&quot;) are both fashioned from the single piece of hide.

The main box which holds the tefillin scrolls, known as &quot;ketzitzah&quot; (קציצה), is cubical. Below it is a wider base known as the &quot;titura&quot; (תיתורא). At the back of the &quot;titura&quot; is a passageway (&quot;ma&#x27;avarta&quot;, מעברתא) through which the tefillin strap is threaded, to tie the tefillin in place.

On both sides of the head-tefillin, the Hebrew letter &quot;shin&quot; () is moulded; the &quot;shin&quot; on the wearer&#x27;s left side has four branches instead of three.

Nowadays it is customary to paint the tefillin black, but archaeological findings show that it is not certain that it was always this way.

===Straps===
Black leather straps (&quot;retsu&#x27;ot&quot;) pass through the rear of the base and are used to secure the tefillin onto the body. The knot of the head-tefillin strap forms the letter &quot;dalet&quot; () or double &quot;dalet&quot; (known as the square-knot) while the strap that is passed through the arm-tefillin is formed into a knot in the shape of the letter &quot;yud&quot; (). Together with the &quot;shin&quot; on the head-tefillin box, these three letters spell &quot;Shaddai&quot; (), one of the names of God.

The straps must be black on their outer side, but may be any color except red on their inner side. A stringent opinion requires them to be black on the inner side too, but more commonly the inner side is left the color of leather.

The Talmud specifies that tefillin straps must be long enough to reach one&#x27;s middle finger, and records the practice of Rav Aha bar Jacob to tie and then &quot;matleit&quot; (plait? wind three times?) them. However, the passage leaves unclear where the measuring is done from, whether the reference is to hand- or head-tefillin, and what exactly the meaning of &quot;matleit&quot; is. Combining and interpreting the Talmud&#x27;s statements, Maimonides, Tur, and Shulchan Aruch ruled that the strap of hand-tefillin must reach from where the tefillin is placed on the arm, as far as the middle finger, where it must be wound three times around the middle finger. Rema wrote that it is not necessary to wind around the finger (rather, the straps must be long enough that one &quot;could&quot; wind around the finger); however, this leniency does not appear in his comments to the Shulchan Aruch. In addition to the windings around the finger, the Shulchan Aruch states that the custom is to wind six or seven times around the forearm.

=== Parchment scrolls ===
The four biblical passages which refer to the tefillin, mentioned above, are written on scrolls and placed inside the leather boxes. The arm-tefillin has one large compartment, which contains all four biblical passages written upon a single strip of parchment; the head-tefillin has four separate compartments in each of which one scroll of parchment is placed. This is because the verses describe the hand-tefillin in the singular (&quot;sign&quot;), while in three of four verses, the head-tefillin is described in the plural (&quot;totafot&quot;).

The passages are written by a scribe with special ink on parchment scrolls (&quot;klaf&quot;). These are: &quot;Sanctify to me ...&quot; (Exodus 13:1–10); &quot;When YHWH brings you ...&quot; (Exodus 13:11–16); &quot;Hear, O Israel ...&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4–9); and &quot;If you observe My Commandments ...&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:13-21). The Hebrew Ashuri script must be used and there are three main styles of lettering used: &quot;Beis Yosef&quot; – generally used by Ashkenazim; &quot;Arizal&quot; – generally used by Hasidim; &quot;Velish&quot; – used by Sefardim. 

The texts have to be written with halachically acceptable (acceptable according to Jewish law) ink on halachically acceptable parchment. There are precise rules for writing the texts and any error invalidates it. For example, the letters of the text must be written in order - if a mistake is found later, it cannot be corrected as the replacement letter would have been written out of sequence. There are 3188 letters on the parchments, and it can take a sofer (scribe) as long as 15 hours to write a complete set.

====Ordering of scrolls (Rashi and Rabbeinu Tam tefillin)====

Talmudic commentators debated the order in which scrolls should be written in the hand tefillin and inserted into the four compartments of the head-tefillin. Rashi held that the passages are placed according to the chronological order as they appear in the Torah (&quot;Kadesh Li&quot;, &quot;Ve-haya Ki Yeviehcha&quot;, &quot;Shema&quot;, &quot;Ve-haya Im Shemoa&quot;), while according to Rabbeinu Tam, the last two passages are switched around. There are two additional opinions of the Shimusha Rabba and the Raavad, who hold that like Rashi and Rabbeinu Tam respectively, but they hold that the scrolls are placed in the head tefillin in mirror image of those opinions.

It is often claimed that of the tefillin dating from the 1st-century CE discovered at Qumran in the Judean Desert, some were made according to the order understood by Rashi and others in the order of Rabbeinu Tam; however, they in fact do not follow either opinion.

Nowadays, the prevailing custom is to arrange the scrolls according to Rashi&#x27;s view, but some pious Jews are also accustomed to briefly lay the tefillin of Rabbeinu Tam as well, a custom of the Ari adopted by the Hasidim, many Sephardic communities, and individuals within the Ashkenazic community. The Vilna Gaon, who wore the tefillin of Rashi, rejected the stringency of also laying Rabbeinu Tam, pointing out that there were 64 possible arrangements of the tefillin scrolls, and it would not be practical to put on 64 different sets of tefillin to account for all possibilities. The Shulchan Aruch rules that only &quot;one who is known and famous for his piety&quot; should put on Rabbeinu Tam tefillin, while the Mishnah Brurah explains that if any other person puts on Rabbeinu Tam tefillin, it is a sign of arrogance.

The placement of the protrusion of a tuft of calf hairs (&quot;se&#x27;ar eigel&quot;) identifies as to which opinion the tefillin were written.

==Obligation and sex==
The legal duty of laying tefillin rests solely upon Jewish males above the age of thirteen years, women are exempt from this obligation. Though no such prohibition existed in ancient times, since at least the Rema in the 16th century, the prevalent practice among religious Jews has strongly discouraged women from wearing tefillin.

The codes view the commandment of tefillin as important, and call those who neglect to observe it &quot;transgressors&quot;. Maimonides counts the commandment of laying the arm-tefillin and head-tefillin as two separate positive &quot;mitzvot&quot;. The Talmud cites Rav Sheshet, who said that by neglecting the precept, one transgresses eight positive commandments. A report of widespread laxity in its observance is reported by Moses of Coucy in 13th-century Spain. It may have arisen from the fear of persecution, similar to what had occurred to the Jews living in the Land of Israel under Roman rule in the second century, or possibly due to expense, lack of skill in manufacture, or other social pressures upon Jews in the middle ages.

A mourner during the first day of his mourning period is exempt from wrapping tefillin; according to Talmudic law, a bridegroom on his wedding-day is also exempt, but this later exemption is not practiced today. The reason for these exemptions is that the wearer of tefilin must have a constant state of mind intent on the commandment of tefilin, and distractions due to recent death or marriage would be problematic. A sufferer from stomach-trouble who thus can not maintain a clean body, or one who is otherwise in pain and cannot concentrate their mind is also exempt. One who is engaged in the study of the Law and scribes of and dealers in tefillin and &quot;mezuzahs&quot; while engaged in their work if it cannot be postponed, are also free from this obligation.

Historically, the &quot;mitzvah&quot; of tefillin was not performed by women, but the ritual was possibly kept privately by some women in medieval France and Germany. It has been popularly claimed that Rashi&#x27;s daughters (12th century) and the wife of Chaim ibn Attar (18th century) wore tefillin, but there is no historical evidence for these claims. There was not a widely accepted practice of women wearing tefilin prior to 20th century progressive Judaism, though historical sources suggest it was done in some communities prior to the advent of progressive Judaism.

In modern times, men have not been the only ones to elect to wear tefillin. In 2018, a group of students from Hebrew College, a non-denominational rabbinical school in Boston, created a series of YouTube videos to help female and transgender Jews learn how to wrap tefillin. Within the Orthodox movement, it remains a male-only religious obligation, but in egalitarian movements, others may observe this practice as a social statement. Women affiliated with the Conservative movement often wrap tefillin. Since 2013, SAR High School in Riverdale, New York, has allowed girls to wrap tefillin during morning prayer; it is probably the first Modern Orthodox high school in the U.S. to do so. The wearing of tefillin by members of Women of the Wall at the Western Wall caused consternation from the rabbi in charge of the site until a Jerusalem District Court judge ruled in 2013 that doing so was not a violation of &quot;local custom&quot;.

==Use==

Sometimes tefillin were worn all day, but not during the night. Nowadays the prevailing custom is to wear them only during the weekday morning service, although some individuals wear them at other times during the day as well. Observant Jews make a tremendous effort to don Tefillin at the appropriate time every morning, even in crowded airports. Tefillin are not donned on Shabbat and the major festivals because these holy days are themselves considered &quot;signs&quot; which render the need of the &quot;sign&quot; of tefillin superfluous.

On the fast day of Tisha B&#x27;Av, Ashkenazim and some Sephardim do not wear tefillin during the morning (Shacharit) service and they are worn instead at the afternoon service (Mincha). Other Sephardim (following the Kabbalah) wear tefillin at Shacharit as usual.

===Chol HaMoed===
On Chol HaMoed (intermediate days) of Pesach and Sukkot, there is a great debate among the early halachic authorities as to whether tefillin should be worn or not. Those who forbid it consider the &quot;sign&quot; of intermediate days as having the same status as the festival itself, making the ritual of tefillin redundant. Others argue and hold that Chol HaMoed does not constitute a &quot;sign&quot; in which case tefillin must be laid. Three customs evolved resulting from the dispute:
*&quot;To refrain from wearing tefillin&quot;: This ruling of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; is based on kabbalah and the Zohar which strongly advocate refraining from laying tefillin on Chol HaMoed. This position is maintained by Sephardic Jews and is also the opinion of the Vilna Gaon whose ruling has been almost universally accepted in Israel.
*&quot;To wear tefillin without reciting the blessings&quot;: This is the opinion of, among others, Rabbi Jacob ben Asher (Ba&#x27;al ha-Turim), Rabbi Moses of Coucy (&quot;Semag&quot;) and Rabbi David HaLevi Segal (Turei Zahav). The advantage of this compromise is that one avoids the transgressions of either not donning tefillin or making a blessing in vain.
*&quot;To wear tefillin and recite the blessings in an undertone&quot;: This opinion is the ruling of Moses Isserles who writes that this is the universally accepted practice among Ashkenazic Jews. However it may have been in his time, this is no longer universally the case, since many Ashkenazim refrain from wearing it or wear it without a blessing during Chol HaMoed.

In light of the conflicting opinions, the &quot;Mishna Berura&quot; (early 20th-century), following the second compromise practice above, recommends Ashkenazim make the following stipulation before donning tefillin: &quot;If I am obligated to don tefillin I intend to fulfill my obligation and if I am not obligated to don tefillin, my doing so should not be considered as fulfilling any obligation&quot; and that the blessing not be recited.

=== Laws and customs regarding putting on tefillin ===

Standard Ashkenazi practice is to put on and remove the arm tefillin while standing in accordance to the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, while most Sephardim do so while sitting in accordance with the Ari. All, however, put on and remove the head tefillin while standing. Halacha forbids speaking or being distracted while putting on the tefillin. An Ashkenazi says two blessings when laying tefillin, the first before he ties the arm-tefillin: ...&quot;lehani&#x27;ach tefillin&quot; (&quot;to bind &quot;tefillin&quot;&quot;), and the second after placing the head tefillin: ...&quot;al mitzvat tefillin&quot; (&quot;as to the commandment of &quot;tefillin&quot;); thereafter, he tightens the head straps and says &quot;Baruch Shem Kovod...&quot;&quot; (&quot;blessed be the holy name&quot;). The Sephardic custom is that no blessing is said for the head-tefillin, the first blessing sufficing for both. Sephardim, Chabad and followers of the Vilna Gaon only recite the blessing on the head-tefillah if they spoke about something not related to tefillin since reciting the blessing on the arm-tefillah.

The arm-tefillin is laid on the inner side of the bare left arm, right arm if one is left handed, two finger breadths above the elbow, so that when the arm is bent the tefillin faces towards the heart. The arm-tefillin is tightened with the thumb, the blessing is said, and the strap is immediately wrapped around the upper arm in the opposite direction it came from in order to keep the knot tight without having to hold it. Some wrap it around the upper arm for less than a full revolution (the bare minimum to keep the knot tight) and then wrap it around the forearm seven times, while others wrap it around the upper arm an additional time before wrapping it around the forearm. Many Ashkenazim and Italian Jews wear the knot to be tightened (not to be confused with the knot on the base which is permanently tied and always worn on the inside, facing the heart) on the inside and wrap inward, while most Nusach Sephard Ashkenazim and Sephardim wear it on the outside and wrap outward.

Then the head-tefillin is placed on the middle of the head just above the forehead, so that no part rests below the hairline. A bald or partially bald person&#x27;s original hairline is used. The knot of the head-tefillin sits at the back of the head, upon the part of the occipital bone that protrudes just above the nape. The two straps of the head-tefillin are brought in front of the shoulders, with their blackened side facing outwards. Now the remainder of the arm-tefillin straps are wound three times around the middle finger and around the hand to form the shape of the Hebrew letter of either a &quot;shin&quot; () according to Ashkenazim, or a &quot;dalet&quot; () according to Sephardim. There are various customs regarding winding the strap on the arm and hand. In fact, the arm strap is looped for counter-clockwise wrapping with Ashkenazi tefillin while it is knotted for clockwise wrapping with Sephardic and Hasidic tefillin. On removing the tefillin, the steps are reversed.

Earlier, Yemenite Jews&#x27; custom was to put on arm-Tefillah and wind forearm with strap, making knot on wrist not winding a finger, and then put on head-Tefillah all made in sitting position. 
Later, Yemenite Jews followed by &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; and put on arm-Tefillah, making seven windings on forearm and three on a finger, and then put on head-Tefillah. Because according to the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; head-Tefillah and arm-Tefillah are two different commandments, if both Tefillin aren&#x27;t available, then one can wear the available one alone.

German Jews also did not tie a finger earlier. But later they put on arm-Tefillah with a knot on biceps while standing, then put on head-Tefillah, and after that they wind seven wraps around forearm (counting by the seven Hebrew words of ), and three wraps around a finger.
Some Western Sephardic families such as the Rodrigues-Pereira family have developed a personalized family wrapping method.

<text>Decimus Clodius Albinus ( 150 – 19 February 197) was a Roman imperial pretender between 193 and 197. He was proclaimed emperor by the legions in Britain and Hispania after the murder of Pertinax in 193 (known as the &quot;Year of the Five Emperors&quot;). Initially Albinus cooperated with another contender for the throne, Septimius Severus, but the two turned on each other in 196 and commenced a civil war. Albinus died in battle the following year.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Albinus was born in Hadrumetum, Africa Province (Sousse, Tunisia) to an aristocratic Roman family. The unreliable &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; claims his parents&#x27; names were Aurelia Messallina and Ceionius Postumus, along with other relatives mentioned in &quot;Vita Albini&quot;. None of these names are considered likely to be accurate by modern historians. The text also claims that Clodius received the cognomen Albinus because of the extraordinary whiteness of his complexion.

===Career under Marcus Aurelius and Commodus===
Showing a disposition for military life, he entered the army when very young and served with distinction, especially in 175 during the rebellion of Avidius Cassius against Emperor Marcus Aurelius. His merit was acknowledged by the Emperor in two letters in which he calls Albinus an African, who resembled his countrymen but little, and who was praiseworthy for his military experience and the gravity of his character. The Emperor likewise declared that without Albinus the legions (in Bithynia) would have gone over to Avidius Cassius, and that he intended to have him chosen consul.

The Emperor Commodus gave Albinus a command in Gallia Belgica and afterwards in Britain. A false rumor having been spread that Commodus had died, Albinus denounced the man before his soldiers in Britain, calling Commodus a tyrant, and maintaining that it would be useful to the Roman Empire to restore to the Senate its ancient dignity and power. The Senate was very pleased with these sentiments, but not so the Emperor, who sent Junius Severus to relieve Albinus of his command. Despite this, Albinus kept his command until after the murders of Commodus and his successor Pertinax in 193.

===Alliance with Septimius Severus===

After Pertinax was assassinated, the praetorian prefect Aemilius Laetus and his men, who had arranged the murder, &quot;sold&quot; the imperial throne to wealthy senator Didius Julianus, effectively crowning him emperor. A string of mutinies by the troops in the provinces, however, meant the next emperor was far from decided. Pescennius Niger was proclaimed emperor by the legions in Syria; Septimius Severus by the troops in Illyricum and Pannonia; and Albinus by the armies in Britain and Gaul.

In the civil war that followed, Albinus was initially allied with Septimius Severus, who had captured Rome. Albinus added the name Septimius to his own, and accepted the title of Caesar from him; the two shared a consulship in 194. Albinus remained effective ruler of much of the western part of the Empire, with support from three British legions and one Spanish. When Didius Julianus was put to death by order of the Senate, who dreaded the power of Septimius Severus, the latter turned his arms against Pescennius Niger. After the defeat and death of Niger in 194, and the complete discomfiture of his adherents, especially after the fall of Byzantium in 196, Severus resolved to make himself the absolute master of the Roman Empire. Albinus, seeing the danger of his position, prepared for resistance. He narrowly escaped being assassinated by a messenger of Severus, after which he put himself at the head of his army, which is said to have consisted of 150,000 men.
===Declaring himself emperor===

In autumn 196, Albinus received word that Severus had appointed his elder son Caracalla as his successor with the title of Caesar and convinced the Senate to declare Albinus himself an official enemy of Rome. Now with nothing to lose, Albinus mobilized his legions in Britannia, proclaimed himself emperor (&quot;Imperator Caesar Decimus Clodius Septimius Albinus Augustus&quot;) and crossed from Britain to Gaul, bringing a large part of the British garrison with him. He defeated Severus&#x27; legate Virius Lupus, and was able to lay claim to the military resources of Gaul, but although he made Lugdunum the headquarters of his forces, he was unable to win the allegiance of the Rhine legions.

On 19 February 197 Albinus met Severus&#x27; army at the Battle of Lugdunum. After a hard-fought battle, with 150,000 troops on both sides according to Cassius Dio, Albinus was defeated and killed himself, or was captured and executed on the orders of Severus. Severus had his naked body laid out on the ground before him, so that he could ride his horse over it, in a final act of humiliation. Albinus&#x27; wife and two sons were initially pardoned by Severus, but he changed his mind almost immediately afterwards, for as the dead Albinus was beheaded, so were they. Albinus&#x27; headless body was thrown into the Rhône, together with the corpses of his murdered family. Severus sent his head to Rome as a warning to his supporters; with it he sent an insolent letter, in which he mocked the Senate for their loyalty to Albinus. The town of Lugdunum was plundered, and the adherents of Albinus were cruelly persecuted by Severus.

==Personal life==
It is said that he wrote a treatise on agriculture and a collection of Milesian tales.

The name of Albinus&#x27; wife is unknown, and only the unreliable &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; mention any name for his sons, claiming that he had an infant son named Pescennius Princus, but some historians such as Anthony Birley hold that this name is fictitious.

<doc id="148688" wikidata="Q390804" url="?curid=148688" title="Lake Agassiz">
<text>Lake Agassiz ( ) was a large proglacial lake that existed in central North America during the late Pleistocene, fed by meltwater from the retreating Laurentide Ice Sheet at the end of the last glacial period. At its peak, the lake&#x27;s area was larger than all of the modern Great Lakes combined. It eventually drained into what is now Hudson Bay, leaving behind Lake Winnipeg, Lake Winnipegosis, Lake Manitoba, and Lake of the Woods.

First postulated in 1823 by William H. Keating, it was named by Warren Upham in 1879 after Louis Agassiz, the then recently deceased (1873) founder of glaciology, when Upham recognized that the lake was formed by glacial action.

== Geological progression ==
During the last glacial maximum, northern North America was covered by an ice sheet, which alternately advanced and retreated with variations in the climate. This continental ice sheet formed during the period now known as the Wisconsin glaciation, and covered much of central North America between 30,000 and 10,000 years ago. As the ice sheet disintegrated, its meltwaters created an immense proglacial lake.

Around 13,000 years ago, this lake came to cover much of what are now southeastern Manitoba, northwestern Ontario, northern Minnesota, eastern North Dakota, and Saskatchewan. At its greatest extent, it may have covered as much as , larger than any currently existing lake in the world (including the Caspian Sea) and approximately the area of the Black Sea.

At times the lake drained south through the Traverse Gap into Glacial River Warren (parent to the Minnesota River, a tributary of the Mississippi River), east through Lake Kelvin (modern Lake Nipigon) to what is now Lake Superior, and northwest through the Clearwater Spillway to the Mackenzie River System and the Arctic Ocean about 13,000 years ago.

The ice returned to the south for a time, but as it again retreated north of the present Canada–United States border around 10,000 years ago, Lake Agassiz refilled. The last major shift in drainage occurred around 8,200 years ago. The melting of remaining Hudson Bay ice caused Lake Agassiz to drain nearly completely. This final drainage of Lake Agassiz has been associated with an estimated rise in global sea levels.

Lake Agassiz&#x27;s major drainage reorganization events were of such magnitudes that they significantly impacted climate, sea level, and possibly early human civilization. The lake&#x27;s enormous freshwater release into the Arctic Ocean has been postulated to have disrupted oceanic circulation and caused temporary cooling. The draining of 13,000 years ago may be the cause of the Younger Dryas stadial. Although disputed, the draining at 9,900–10,000 years ago may be the cause of the 8,200 yr climate event. A study by Turney and Brown links the 8,500-years-ago drainage to the expansion of agriculture from east to west across Europe; they suggest that this may also account for various flood myths of ancient cultures, including the Biblical flood narrative.

== Glacial River Warren outlet ==

The lowest point between the drainage of Hudson Bay and the Gulf of Mexico is in the Traverse Gap between the U.S. states of Minnesota and South Dakota. It lies between Lake Traverse and Big Stone Lake. This continental divide is about above sea level. When Lake Agassiz existed, the gap was the outlet to River Warren. The outflow from the melting glaciers filled Lake Agassiz and then drained through the gap to the Gulf of Mexico. This mass of moving water eroded a valley wide and from deep. Today, this valley contains the Minnesota River, joined by the Upper Mississippi River at Fort Snelling, Minnesota.

North of the gap, the Red River of the North flows from Lake Traverse north through the former lakebed of Lake Agassiz to Lake Winnipeg.

== Phases ==

=== Lockhart Phase: 12,875–12,560 YBP ===

During the Lockhart Phase, water accumulated in the Red River valley of North Dakota and Minnesota. As the water reached to the top of the divide to the south, the water drained into the ancestral Minnesota and Mississippi River systems. This occurred while the Laurentian Ice Sheet was at or south of the current Canada–US border. As the ice sheet melted northward, an early Lake Agassiz covered southern Manitoba, the Minnesota and Ontario boundary country, and along the Red River south of Fargo, North Dakota. The Lockhart Phase is associated with the Herman lake stage (), the highest shoreline of Lake Agassiz. The Big Stone Moraine formed the southern boundary of the lake. During the Lockhart Phase the lake is estimated to have been deep, with greater depths near the glacier.

=== Moorhead Phase: 12,560–11,690 YBP ===
As the ice sheet melted northward, Lake Agassiz found a lower outlet through the Kaministikwia route along the modern Minnesota–Ontario border. This moved water to Lake Duluth, a proglacial lake in the Lake Superior basin. From there the water drained south via an ancestral St. Croix and Mississippi River systems. The lake drained below the Herman lake beaches until isostatic rebound and glacial advances closed the Kaministikwia route. This stabilized the lake at the Norcross lake stage (). The average depth of Lake Agassiz during the late Moorhead Phase was . Drainage from Lake Agassiz continued to flow southward out of the ancient Minnesota and Mississippi River systems into the Gulf of Mexico.

=== Emerson Phase: 11,690–10,630 YBP ===
During the Emerson Phase, lake levels and drainage patterns continually fluctuated. The lake switched from a southward outlet to a northwestern outlet, and may have been static without a significant outlet during this phase. Isostatic rebound changed the elevation of the land, and this, combined with changes in the volume of meltwater from the ice margin and the closure of the Kaministikwia outlet in the east increased the size of the northern end of the lake. One hypothesis postulates that the lake was a &#x27;terminal lake&#x27; with water inflows and evapotranspiration being equal. Dating of the glacial moraines shows that the Clearwater and Athabasca River system and Lake Nipigon and Minong basin were still ice-covered. A period of precipitation and meltwater input balance with the rate of evapotranspiration may have existed for a short period of time. During this phase, the Clearwater and Athabasca River system outlet opened. Isostatic rebound opened the southern outlet for a time, creating the Norcross (), Tintah (), and Upper Campbell () beaches. The south outlet was permanently closed at the end of Emerson Phase.

=== Nipigon Phase: 10,630–9,160 YBP ===
The opening of the Kaministiquia outlet to the east initiated the onset of the Nipigon Phase. The lower lake level ended the southern outlet through the ancestral Minnesota and Mississippi River systems. The ice sheets advanced and blocked the northwestern outlet through the Clearwater and Athabasca systems. There were several other low level outlets into the Lake Minong basin, including the Kaministiquia and the Lake Nipigon outlet. These allowed large amounts of water to flow from Lake Agassiz into Lake Minong. A series of ice advances and retreats between 10,500 and 9,500 YBP blocked the Lake Nipigon outlet and the other low level outlets, creating intermittent catastrophic outbursts of water into the Lake Minong basin.

These large inflows of water raised Lake Minong lake levels and flowed into Lake Algonquin in the Lake Michigan and Huron basins. These outbursts refilled the Lake Michigan and Huron basins, which are extreme low water levels of Lake Chippewa (Lake Michigan basin) and Lake Stanley (Lake Huron basin). This was due to isostatic rebound of the northern shorelines combined with the opening of the North Bay outlet of the Lake Huron basin. These repetitive outbursts from Lake Agassiz flooded the Lake Minong basin, then flowed over into the Lake Stanley basin, and then flowed through the North Bay drainage route into the Champlain Sea (present day St. Lawrence lowland). The shifting ice sheet created fluctuating drainage channels into the Lake Nipigon and Superior basins. A dozen beaches were created during short periods of stability. Towards the end of the Nipigon Phase, Lake Agassiz reached its largest geographical size as it joined with Lake Ojibway in the east.

=== Ojibway Phase: 9,160–8,480 YBP ===

The Ojibway Phase is named for the glacial lake along the ice front in northern Ontario. Lake Ojibway merged with Lake Agassiz at this time. Isostatic rebound of glaciated lands that were south of the ice sheet created a long linear lake from the Saskatchewan–Manitoba border to Quebec. This long lake drained through the eastern outlet at , into the Ottawa River valley. Lake Agassiz-Ojibway drainage raised sea levels. The results can be seen in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and eastern Maine. Marine records from the North Atlantic have identified two separate episodes, linked to northern hemisphere cooling in 8,490 YBP and 8,340–8,180 YBP. These may be linked with the Ojibway Phase of Lake Agassiz and may indicate large amounts of drainage from the Ottawa River valley and the Tyrrell Sea (ancestral Hudson Bay).

The Laurentide Ice Sheet continued to recede. Continued warming shrank the ice front towards present day Hudson Bay. Here, the Lake Agassiz northward outlet drained into the Tyrrell Sea. This breach dropped the water level below the eastern Kinojevis outlet. The drainage was followed by the disintegration of the adjacent ice front at about 8,480 YBP. This brought on the end of Lake Agassiz. The ice sheet continued its northward retreat to Baffin Island, leaving the North American mainland around 5,000 YBP.

== Lakes of the Lake Agassiz basin ==
Numerous lakes have formed in this glacial lake basin. The best known are the &quot;Great Lakes of Manitoba&quot;; Lake Winnipeg, Lake Manitoba, and Lake Winnipegosis. A cluster of smaller lakes surround these, including: Cedar Lake, through which the Saskatchewan River flows; Lake Dauphin, south of Lake Winnipegosis and tributary to it; and Lake St. Martin, on the Fairford or Little Saskatchewan River, the outlet of lakes Manitoba and Winnipegosis. In northern Minnesota, there are Roseau, Thief, Mud, and Maple lakes, besides three large lakes of that state, Rainy Lake, the Lake of the Woods, and Red Lake.
== Glacial lakes draining into Lake Agassiz ==
Glacial Lake Souris formed along the Manitoba and North Dakota border, forming a crescent around the west side of the Turtle Mountains. Lake Souris had three successive outlets: the Sheyenne River, the Pembina River, and finally the Assiniboine River. Initially, Lake Souris&#x27; southern bay drained into the Sheyenne River, a tributary of the Red River, which in turn flowed into Lake Agassiz. However, after the ice sheet had retreated enough to uncover Turtle Mountain, the northern bay of Lake Souris found an outlet at the &quot;elbow&quot; of the modern Souris River; the elbow is about southwest of the present mouth of the Souris River. From this elbow, the lake&#x27;s waters flowed southeast and entered the Pembina River, now a tributary of the Red River, and the Pembina, in turn, entered Lake Agassiz at its Assiniboine embayment. When the ice sheet retreated north of the Assiniboine River, Lake Souris drained via that river into Lake Agassiz. (Pelican Lake in Langs Valley of Manitoba occupies what was once the northern shore of Lake Souris.)

The lower part of the Saskatchewan River basin near the river&#x27;s mouth at Cedar Lake was clear of the ice-sheet before Lake Agassiz began to drain to northeast. Lake Saskatchewan existed on about of the North Saskatchewan River between Saskatoon and Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. A few miles east of Lake Saskatchewan&#x27;s outlet, near the modern junction of the north and south branches, it entered Lake Agassiz. This Saskatchewan embayment extended for along the modern Saskatchewan River route.

== Formation of beaches ==
Raised beaches, many kilometres from any current water, mark the former boundaries of the lake. While the Red River gradually descends from south to north, these old strandlines ascend as one goes north, due to isostatic rebound since glaciation.

=== When Lake Agassiz outflowed to the south ===
The highest shore of Lake Agassiz is called the Herman Beach. It is named for Herman, Minnesota, in Grant County. The Herman Beach is the highest shoreline and can be traced from the historic outlet at Lake Traverse on the border of Minnesota and South Dakota. The beach fluctuates between above sea level. The altitude of Lake Traverse at above sea level at the Traverse Gap at Brown&#x27;s Valley is at . This was the south outlet of Lake Agassiz.

The Herman Beach displays numerous deltas from the major rivers that entered Lake Agassiz. In Minnesota and North Dakota, these include the Buffalo River Delta, Sand Hill River Delta, Sheyenne River Delta, Elk Valley Delta, and the Pembina River Delta. In Manitoba, there is the Assiniboine River Delta.
* &quot;Beaches of the Norcross&quot; stages: The Norcross shoreline lies near the Herman shore on the slope of eroded till.
* &quot;Beaches of the Tintah&quot; Stage: The Tintah beaches are above sea level.
* &quot;Beaches of the Campbell&quot; Stage: These have a well developed profile and are useful in establishing the boundary of the lake when it ceased to flow south into the River Warren.
* &quot;Beaches of the McCauleyville&quot; Stage: The channel of the River Warren, flowing out of Lake Agassiz, eroded the channel below the level of Traverse Lake and Big Stone Lake, down to , the deepest part of Lake Traverse. The southern portions of the McCauleyville shoreline coincides with the levels of high and low water in Lake Traverse, which are above sea level.

=== When Lake Agassiz outflowed to the northeast ===
Fourteen shorelines of Lake Agassiz have been identified, which lie below the McCauleyville beaches. These formed when the River Warren could no longer receive the outflow of the lake. This occurred when a lower outlet was found and the lake shrank with the release of the lake&#x27;s waters. The three highest shorelines are named the Blanchard beaches, and the next five in descending order are the Hillsboro, the two Emerado, and the two Ojata beaches, from towns on or near their course in North Dakota.

* &quot;Beaches of the Blanchard&quot; Stage (Hillsboro Beach): Three successive levels of the lake pass near Blanchard, North Dakota. They are indicated by sand and gravel deposits southeast of Euclid, Minnesota., and near Midway station, Manitoba The next lower beach is called the Hillsboro Beach and is visible near Glyndon, Minnesota, and north of Crookston, Minnesota.
* &quot;Beaches of the Emerado&quot; Stage: The Emerado shoreline is approximately above sea level. Its southern tip is across the Red River between Kragnes, Minnesota, and Harwood, North Dakota. This single shoreline, clearly shows that it belongs to a period when the lake flowed northeastward to its outlet. Crustal rebound was greater to the north, where the Emerado Beach, in Manitoba, is higher.
* &quot;Beaches of the Ojata&quot; Stage: The upper Ojata shoreline is between above sea level near Perley, Minnesota, and Noble, North Dakota. In Minnesota it is east of the Red River. Some of the shore is marked by a beach ridge, especially to the north, where the surface is till.
* &quot;Gladstone Beach&quot;: The southern tip of Lake Agassiz when Gladstone beach formed is near Belmont, North Dakota, south of Grand Forks, it lies above sea level. It runs northward about east of the Red River.
* &quot;Burnside Beach&quot;: The Burnside Beach crosses the Red River at Grand Forks, North Dakota, and to the northeast, then north, paralleling the Red River to the east. This beach is indistinct south of the international border. The beach lies above sea level.
* &quot;Ossowa Beach&quot;: The Ossowa Beach lies only a few miles south of the international boundary. The beach lies above sea level.
* &quot;Stonewall Beach&quot;: In Stonewall, Manitoba, there is a conspicuous beach ridge or more. Its crest is above sea level and about deep. Beach deposits belonging to this stage were not observed elsewhere in southern Manitoba. It is believed that they are buried for most of their length from the U.S. side of the border, north to Winnipeg
* &quot;Beaches of the Niverville&quot; Stage: About southeast of Niverville the road crosses this beach. Its crest is above sea level. It stands above the surrounding surface. Beginning near Niverville station, it extends southeasterly at least a mile. About south, a similar beach ridge crest is at above sea level. It rises above the land. Much of it sloughs, with water throughout the year, the elevation of the beach crest is above sea level.

== Soils ==
The fertile soils of the Red River Valley, now drained by the Red River of the North, were formed from lacustrine deposits of silt from Lake Agassiz.

<text>The BBC Symphony Orchestra (BBC SO) is a British orchestra based in London. Founded in 1930, it was the first permanent salaried orchestra in London, and is the only one of the city&#x27;s five major symphony orchestras not to be self-governing. The BBC SO is the principal broadcast orchestra of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).

The orchestra was originally conceived in 1928 as a joint enterprise by the BBC and the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham, but the latter withdrew the next year and the task of assembling and training the orchestra fell to the BBC&#x27;s director of music, Adrian Boult. Among its guest conductors in its first years was Arturo Toscanini, who judged it the finest orchestra he had ever conducted. During and after the Second World War, Boult strove to maintain standards, but the senior management of the post-war BBC did not allocate the orchestra the resources to meet competition from new and well-funded rivals.

After Boult&#x27;s retirement from the BBC in 1950, the orchestra went through a fallow period. Boult&#x27;s successor, Sir Malcolm Sargent, was popular with the public but had poor rapport with his players, and orchestral morale dropped. Sargent&#x27;s successor, Rudolf Schwarz, made relatively little impact, and although the BBC appointed high-profile chief conductors in the 1960s and 1970s – Antal Doráti, Colin Davis, Pierre Boulez and Gennady Rozhdestvensky – the BBC SO remained underfunded. However, because it was the sole symphony orchestra in London that offered its players full-time contracts, players of high repute, including Alan Civil (horn) and John Wilbraham (trumpet), enrolled as regular members.

As a result of initiatives begun in the 1960s by the BBC controller of music William Glock, performing standards rose appreciably. Under Andrew Davis in the 1990s and Jiří Bělohlávek in the 2000s, the orchestra prospered. By the second decade of the 21st century, the BBC SO was regarded by critics as of first-class status. From the outset, the orchestra has been known for pioneering new music, and it continues to do so, at the Proms, in concerts at the Barbican Centre, and in studio concerts from its base at BBC Maida Vale studios.

==History==

===Background===
Almost from its beginning in November 1922, the BBC had started broadcasting from its &quot;2LO&quot; transmitter with its own musical ensembles. The first such groups were the &quot;2LO Dance Band&quot;, the &quot;2LO Military Band&quot;, the &quot;2LO Light Orchestra&quot;, and the &quot;2LO Octette&quot;, all of which began broadcasting in 1923. No concert promoter would co-operate with the BBC, regarding it as a dangerous competitor, but the British National Opera Company allowed broadcasts of its performances from the Royal Opera House. John Reith, the general manager of the BBC, invited the opera company&#x27;s musical director, Percy Pitt, to become the BBC&#x27;s part-time musical adviser from May 1923. Later in the same year, Pitt conducted the BBC&#x27;s first broadcast symphony concert, which included Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;New World&quot; Symphony and works by Saint-Saëns, Elgar and Weber.
Pitt expanded the regular eight-piece studio ensemble to form The Wireless Orchestra of 18 players, augmented to 37 for important broadcasts. The augmented &quot;Wireless Orchestra&quot; conducted by Sir Landon Ronald made its first commercial recording in July 1924 by the acoustical process for His Master&#x27;s Voice, Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Rosamunde&quot; overture, which was issued in the following October. There was no thought at this stage that the BBC would maintain a full-scale symphonic orchestra of up to 100 players. With Reith&#x27;s approval, Pitt engaged various orchestras for a BBC concert series in 1924 at the Methodist Central Hall Westminster. Pitt and Landon Ronald conducted the Royal Albert Hall Orchestra; Eugene Goossens conducted the London Symphony Orchestra; and Hamilton Harty and Sir Edward Elgar conducted the orchestra of the Royal Philharmonic Society.

In 1924, the Wireless Orchestra, by then comprising 22 players, was contracted for six concerts a week. The following year, Pitt, by now working full-time for the BBC, as its director of music, augmented the ensemble to form the &quot;Wireless Symphony Orchestra&quot; for a new series of concerts broadcast from Covent Garden, conducted by Bruno Walter, Ernest Ansermet and Pierre Monteux; at this time Reith also allowed Pitt and the Wireless Symphony Orchestra to contract with the Columbia Graphophone Company to make a substantial series of electrically recorded discs, most of which were recorded in the Methodist Central Hall Westminster which the BBC had previously used for concerts. In 1927 the BBC and Covent Garden collaborated in a series of public concerts with an orchestra of 150 players under conductors including Richard Strauss and Siegfried Wagner. Although the orchestra was large, it was not good. The BBC attempted to stop its contracted players sending deputies to rehearsals and even to concerts, but was unsuccessful. In January 1928 &quot;The Musical Times&quot; protested:

In 1927, the BBC took over the responsibility for the Promenade Concerts, widely known as &quot;the Proms&quot;. At first Henry Wood, the founding conductor, persuaded the corporation to engage his Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra for each Prom season; from 1930 onwards, the BBC provided the orchestra.

The inadequacy of the BBC&#x27;s players, and also of the established London orchestras, was shown up by the Berlin Philharmonic, under Wilhelm Furtwängler, in two concerts in 1927. A historian of the Queen&#x27;s Hall, Robert Elkin, writes, &quot;At this period the standard of orchestral playing in London was distinctly low, and the well-drilled efficiency of the Berliners under their dynamic conductor came as something of a revelation.&quot; These, and later concerts by the same orchestra, gained plaudits from the public and music critics at the expense of the London orchestras. The chief music critic of &quot;The Times&quot;, Frank Howes, later commented, &quot;the British public ... was electrified when it heard the disciplined precision of the Berlin Philharmonic... This apparently was how an orchestra could, and, therefore, ought to sound&quot;. After the Berliners, London heard a succession of major foreign orchestras, including the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra under Willem Mengelberg and the Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra of New York under Arturo Toscanini.

Among those determined that London should have a permanent orchestra of similar excellence were Reith and the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham. The latter aimed at setting up a first-rate ensemble for opera and concert performances and, though no admirer of broadcasting, he was willing to negotiate with the BBC if this gave him what he sought. Reith&#x27;s concern was that the BBC should have a first-rate radio orchestra. The critic Richard Morrison writes: Reith&#x27;s BBC of the 1920s was ... imbued with an almost religious zeal for &quot;enlightening&quot; the public through the magical medium of the wireless. An orchestra, and particularly one that was unencumbered by commercial constraints and thus free to deliver the highest of highbrow programmes, would fit very well into that idealistic philosophy. Landon Ronald brought Reith and Beecham together in April 1928; negotiations and preliminary arrangements continued for more than 18 months until it became clear that the corporation and the conductor had irreconcilable priorities for the proposed new ensemble. Beecham withdrew and, as described by Nicholas Kenyon:

===Foundation===
By the time Adrian Boult succeeded Pitt as director of music for the BBC, the violinist Albert Sammons and the violist Lionel Tertis had scouted for new talent around the country on behalf of the corporation. Twenty-seven players had been offered positions in the new orchestra. Among those who joined were Aubrey Brain, Arthur Catterall, Eugene Cruft, Sidonie Goossens, Lauri Kennedy and Frederick Thurston. Although many of the principals were stars recruited from the LSO, the Hallé and other ensembles such as the British Symphony Orchestra which Boult had conducted from 1920 to 1923 (with Sammons as leader and Cruft as principal bass), a high proportion of the rank and file members were fresh from music colleges. Boult wrote, &quot;a brilliant group of young and inexperienced players came to sit behind the well-known old stagers.&quot;
A substantial number of the players performed at the 1930 Promenade Concerts under Wood, and the full BBC Symphony Orchestra gave its first concert on 22 October 1930, conducted by Boult at the Queen&#x27;s Hall. The programme consisted of music by Wagner, Brahms, Saint-Saëns and Ravel. Of the 21 programmes in the orchestra&#x27;s first season, Boult conducted nine and Wood five.

The reviews of the new orchestra were enthusiastic. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote of its &quot;virtuosity&quot; and of Boult&#x27;s &quot;superb&quot; conducting. &quot;The Musical Times&quot; commented, &quot;The boast of the B.B.C. that it intended to get together a first-class orchestra was not an idle one&quot;, spoke of &quot;exhilaration at the playing&quot;, and called another concert later in the season &quot;an occasion for national pride&quot;. &quot;The Observer&quot; called the playing &quot;altogether magnificent&quot;. After the initial concerts Reith was told by his advisers that the orchestra had played better for Boult than anyone else. Reith asked him if he wished to take on the chief conductorship, and if so whether he would resign as director of music or occupy both posts simultaneously. Boult opted for the latter.

During the 1930s, the orchestra became renowned for its high standard of playing and for performing new and unfamiliar music. The pioneering work of Boult and the BBC SO included an early performance of Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Variations,&quot; Op. 31, British premieres, including Berg&#x27;s &quot;Wozzeck&quot; and &quot;Three Movements from the Lyric Suite&quot;, and world premieres, including Vaughan Williams&#x27;s Symphony No. 4 in F minor. Anton Webern conducted eight BBC SO concerts between 1931 and 1936.

During the 1930s the orchestra presented rarely heard large-scale works from the past, including Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Grande Messe des morts&quot; and &quot;Grande symphonie funèbre et triomphale&quot;. Mahler&#x27;s Eighth and Ninth Symphonies, and Purcell&#x27;s &quot;King Arthur&quot;.

The excellence of the orchestra attracted leading international conductors. In its second season guest conductors included Richard Strauss, Felix Weingartner and Bruno Walter, followed, in later seasons, by Serge Koussevitzky, Beecham and Mengelberg. Arturo Toscanini, widely regarded at the time as the world&#x27;s leading conductor, conducted the BBC SO in 1935 and later said that it was the finest he had ever directed. He returned to conduct the orchestra in 1937, 1938 and 1939, and declared, &quot;This is the orchestra I would like to take round the world.&quot;

===Second World War and postwar===
On the outbreak of war in September 1939 the BBC put into effect its contingency plans to minimise disruption of broadcasting. The corporation withdrew from responsibility for the Proms, with which Wood went ahead, backed by the Royal Philharmonic Society, with the LSO replacing the BBC SO. The BBC SO was relocated from London to Bristol. More than 40 players were released for active service, including the 30 youngest members; the orchestra was reduced to a complement of 70, although it was increased to 90 later in the war. During 1940 and 1941 Bristol suffered devastation from German air-raids, and the BBC decided to move the orchestra again. In September 1941 the BBC SO took up residence in Bedford, where it remained, giving live broadcasts and making recordings until it returned permanently to its London base at the BBC&#x27;s BBC Maida Vale studios in 1945. The BBC resumed its support for the Proms in 1942, with the BBC SO returning temporarily to London during the Proms seasons of 1942–45. For the rest of the year, the orchestra played in the hall of Bedford School, and after the launch of the V-1 raids in 1944 the remaining broadcast concerts of that year&#x27;s Proms season were performed at the Bedford Corn Exchange.

Boult had striven to maintain the orchestra&#x27;s standards and prestige during the war; as an instance of its prowess in the 1940s Kennedy cites a His Master&#x27;s Voice recording of Elgar&#x27;s Second Symphony released in January 1945: &quot;a performance that blazed with excitement and passion and is documentary evidence of the excellence of the orchestra in 1944&quot;. With Reith long gone from the post of director-general, Boult found that the top management of the BBC was less concerned for the status of its Symphony Orchestra. The new director-general, Sir William Haley, was unwilling to approve the funding needed to keep the orchestra competitive with new rivals – Walter Legge&#x27;s Philharmonia and Beecham&#x27;s Royal Philharmonic. Some younger players felt that many BBC SO principals were past their best. Steuart Wilson, the new Director of Music who had previously been married to Boult&#x27;s wife Ann, engineered Boult&#x27;s retirement in 1950, Wilson had neglected to secure a successor of similar eminence to take over the orchestra. His efforts to recruit Sir John Barbirolli and Rafael Kubelík were unsuccessful, and he was obliged to offer the post to his third choice, Sir Malcolm Sargent, on whatever terms Sargent demanded.

===1950s===
Sargent, an immensely popular figure with the public, was not at all popular with orchestral players, because of what a historian of the Proms has called his &quot;autocratic and &quot;prima-donna&quot; attitude towards orchestral players&quot;. He offended the BBC SO players by demanding that they all stand up when he came on to the platform – which they firmly declined to do. He rapidly became equally unpopular with the BBC music department, ignoring its agenda and pursuing his own. He refused to join the staff of the BBC, and insisted on remaining a freelance, taking numerous external engagements to the detriment of his work with the BBC SO. A senior BBC manager wrote: Except when a Barbirolli or a Kletzki has been in charge for a few days, the Orchestra is inferior, as an artistic instrument, to the Hallé or Philharmonia... [Sargent] is indifferent to the morale and welfare of the Orchestra and to the individual temperaments of his players as artists or as human beings. It did not help that Sargent was universally acknowledged to be at his finest in choral music. His reputation in big works for chorus and orchestra such as &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;, &quot;Hiawatha&#x27;s Wedding Feast&quot; and &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot; was unrivalled, and his large-scale performances of Handel oratorios were assured packed houses. However, his regular programming of such works did nothing to lift the spirits of the BBC SO: orchestral musicians regarded playing the instrumental accompaniment for large choirs as drudgery.

In the 1950s, the BBC SO, in common with the rest of the BBC&#x27;s musical organisation, suffered from stagnation. In the words of the critic Peter Heyworth, &quot;the Corporation&#x27;s music department had become a byword for its narrow-mindedness and lassitude&quot;. Boult had been followed as director of music by a series of successors between 1944 and 1959 who either lacked his commitment to modern music or were actively hostile to it. Richard Howgill, who held the post from 1952 to 1959, took the view that although Webern &quot;might have been a small composer of some significance, Schoenberg wasn&#x27;t really a composer at all.&quot; In addition to working under a conductor it disliked, the BBC SO found its role as a pioneer of progressive music gone, and its performances of the standard classics criticised as under-rehearsed (particularly during Proms seasons) compared with those given by Legge&#x27;s Philharmonia and others. Sargent&#x27;s contract was not renewed in 1957, although he continued as chief conductor of the Proms until his death ten years later. Howgill appointed Rudolf Schwarz as chief conductor of the BBC SO. Schwarz failed to restore orchestral standards to pre-war levels, and lacked Sargent&#x27;s box-office appeal. Under Schwarz, BBC SO concerts other than the Proms drew poor houses – as low as 29 per cent of capacity in the 1959–60 season. The manager of the Royal Festival Hall, Ernest Bean, spoke of &quot;an inherited aura of mediocrity about BBC concerts which keeps people away&quot;. Schwarz&#x27;s five-year contract was not renewed when it expired.

===1960s to 1980s===

In 1959, the BBC appointed William Glock as controller of music for the BBC. During Glock&#x27;s tenure, the profile and fortunes of the BBC SO began to rise. Glock engaged Antal Doráti as the orchestra&#x27;s principal conductor. Heyworth judged that Doráti raised standards of playing and brought new vigour to the programmes in his four years in charge (1962–1966). Doráti was convinced that the orchestra was stultified by concentrating on studio broadcasts, as it did except during the Proms season. He strove to free players from &quot;slavery to the microphone&quot;, and Glock promoted a regular series of concerts at the Festival Hall. The music critic Tom Sutcliffe later wrote that Doráti and his successors, Colin Davis (1967–71), Pierre Boulez (1971–75) and Gennady Rozhdestvensky (1978–81) had been partly successful in improving playing standards, but had not brought the orchestra up to its original level of distinction.

By 1962, Glock had persuaded the BBC management to increase the orchestra&#x27;s budget to allow for joint principals in the string sections, to attract top musicians who could play in the BBC SO without having to give up their solo or chamber careers. The following season, he was able to engage joint principals for the wind section, including Jack Brymer and Terence MacDonagh, formerly members of Beecham&#x27;s celebrated &quot;Royal Family&quot; in the RPO. The problem remained that recruiting rank-and-file string players was difficult: although the BBC offered secure employment and a pension, it did not pay as well as its London rivals. After 1964, the BBC SO was the only one of the five London symphony orchestras that was not self-governed, and some musicians felt that the BBC SO&#x27;s constitution as a body of salaried employees, with no say in the management or repertory of the orchestra, attracted an unadventurous type of player. A former member of the BBC SO said in 1979, I felt I was getting too secure ... [in] the BBC Symphony you can be a poor player, but if you&#x27;re on time and never moan at the conductor … you&#x27;ll have no trouble... I think the BBC Symphony lost some good young players because the management got their priorities wrong.

Glock was well known as a proponent of music of the Second Viennese School and their successors; earlier in his career he had been dismissed as music critic of &quot;The Observer&quot; for such views as &quot;no great composer has ever cared how &#x27;pleasant&#x27; his music sounds&quot;. Under his administration, the BBC SO gave world premieres of works by composers including Roberto Gerhard, Peter Maxwell Davies and Michael Tippett, and UK premieres of works by, among others, Luciano Berio, Boulez and Edgard Varèse. The policy of commissioning works, and giving UK premieres of new compositions was continued under Glock&#x27;s successors. World or UK premieres in the 1970s included works by Elliott Carter, György Ligeti, Witold Lutosławski, Olivier Messiaen, Luigi Nono, Arvo Pärt and Karlheinz Stockhausen. BBC commissions premiered by the BBC SO in the 1980s included Alfred Schnittke&#x27;s Second Symphony, Harrison Birtwistle&#x27;s &quot;Earth Dances&quot;, and John Tavener&#x27;s &quot;The Protecting Veil&quot;.

Although Glock restored the orchestra&#x27;s reputation as Britain&#x27;s leading modern music ensemble, the balance of programming affected the players&#x27; capacity in the mainstream repertoire. The principal horn, Alan Civil, recalled:

: &quot;We did about eighty percent modern and twenty percent classical. The awful tragedy, for the orchestra, was that eventually we were not able to play the standard classics. We could sight-read the most fearsome contemporary piece, but a Brahms symphony – embarrassing!&quot; 

The bassoon player William Waterhouse who joined the BBC SO from the LSO found the BBC&#x27;s repertory refreshing, but the music making less impressive: &quot;

: There were no potboilers, but also, I&#x27;m afraid, no world-ranking soloists either.&quot;

John Pritchard was principal conductor from 1982 to 1989. In &quot;The Times&quot;, Paul Griffiths wrote:

: &quot;Sir John&#x27;s seven-year period with the orchestra has been marked by growing orchestral confidence and many memorable performances.&quot; Principal guest conductors in the 1970s and 1980s included Sir Charles Mackerras (1977–1979), Michael Gielen (1978–1981), Günter Wand, Mark Elder (1982–1985) and Péter Eötvös (1985–1988).

===1990s and 21st century===
Pritchard&#x27;s successor was Andrew Davis, beginning in 1989. He held the post until 2000, the longest-serving chief conductor since Boult. He was at the helm for what John Allison in &quot;The Times&quot; called &quot;the valuable Barbican weekends that each January investigate another major but not fully understood 20th-century composer.&quot; Noting that modern music was central to the work of Davis and the orchestra, Allison added that under Davis the orchestra took part in &quot;once-in-a-lifetime projects such as Anthony Payne&#x27;s completion of Elgar&#x27;s Third Symphony.&quot; Upon Davis&#x27; departure, the orchestra appointed him its first conductor laureate.
Leonard Slatkin succeeded Davis as chief conductor, from 2000 to 2004. His relationship with the players was reported to be uneasy, and his choice of repertoire received criticism. In February 2005, Jiří Bělohlávek was named the orchestra&#x27;s next chief conductor, effective with the 2006 Proms season. He was principal guest conductor of the orchestra from 1995 to 2000, and was the first past principal guest conductor of the orchestra to be named its chief conductor. The classical repertory was regarded as one of Bělohlávek&#x27;s strengths, but he had no reputation for conducting new works, which remained a core part of the orchestra&#x27;s remit. He welcomed the fact that the orchestra&#x27;s new principal guest conductor was David Robertson, a new-music expert and a protégé of Boulez. The orchestra was seen by some as &quot;a bolshie lot&quot; and &quot;grumpy&quot;, but its relations with Bělohlávek were harmonious. Under Bělohlávek the orchestra won glowing reviews: &quot;The Times&quot; referred to its &quot;superb musicians&quot;, Michael Kennedy in &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; referred to a &quot;rich and opulent [score] magnificently played by the BBC Symphony Orchestra&quot; under Bělohlávek, and another &quot;Telegraph&quot; critic praised the BBC SO&#x27;s &quot;virtuoso form&quot;.

In addition to Bělohlávek and Robertson, other principal guest conductors of the orchestra from this period included Alexander Lazarev (1992–1995) and Jukka-Pekka Saraste (2002–2005). Robertson&#x27;s tenure as principal guest conductor concluded in 2012. In October 2011, Sakari Oramo made his first guest conducting appearance with the BBC SO, his first guest-conducting engagement with any London orchestra. On the basis of this concert, in February 2012, Oramo was named the orchestra&#x27;s 13th Chief Conductor, with an initial contract of 3 years, effective with the First Night of the 2013 Proms season. In September 2015, the BBC SO announced the extension of his contract to the 2019–2020 season. In May 2018, the BBCSO indicated a further extension of Oramo&#x27;s contract through 2022. In October 2020, the BBC SO announced a further extension of Oramo&#x27;s contract as chief conductor through September 2023, the scheduled conclusion of the 2023 Proms season. In April 2022, the BBC SO announced an additional extension of Oramo&#x27;s contract as chief conductor through the close of the 2025–2026 season. In September 2024, the BBC SO announced a further extension of Oramo&#x27;s contract as chief conductor to 2030. Oramo is currently the longest-serving chief conductor of the orchestra since Adrian Boult.

In August 2012, the BBC SO announced the appointment of Semyon Bychkov to a newly created conducting post with the orchestra, the Günter Wand Conducting Chair. In January 2019, the BBC SO announced the appointment of Dalia Stasevska as its next principal guest conductor, the first woman ever to be named to the post and the second female conductor ever to be given a titled post with a BBC orchestra. In January 2025, the BBC SO announced the most recent extension of Stasevska&#x27;s contract as principal guest conductor, through September 2027.

===Function in the 21st century===

The BBC SO is the associate orchestra of the Barbican Centre in London, where it gives an annual season of concerts. These seasons include series of concerts devoted to individual modern composers, who have included John Cage, James MacMillan, Elliott Carter, Sofia Gubaidulina, Michael Tippett, George Benjamin, Roberto Carnevale and Thomas Adès.

The orchestra remains the principal orchestra of the Proms, giving about a dozen concerts each season, including the first and last nights. Most of its concerts are broadcast on BBC Radio 3, streamed online and available as podcasts for a month after broadcast, and a number are televised: the orchestra&#x27;s website claims that this gives the BBC &quot;the highest broadcast profile of any UK orchestra&quot;. The orchestra continues to make studio recordings for Radio 3 at the Maida Vale studios; some recording sessions are free for the public to attend.

In common with other orchestras, the BBC SO engages in educational work. According to the orchestra&#x27;s website: &quot;Among ongoing projects are the BBC SO Family Music Intro scheme, introducing families to live classical music, BBC SO Student Zone and the highly successful BBC SO Family Orchestra, alongside work in local schools. Total Immersion composer events also provide rich material for education work.&quot;

In 2000, the orchestra appointed its first associate composer, Mark-Anthony Turnage. John Adams became the BBC Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s artist in association in June 2003. The composer and conductor Oliver Knussen took up the post of artist-in-association in July 2009. The orchestra&#x27;s commitment to new music continues. In 2013, the music journalist Tom Service wrote, &quot;I&#x27;ve heard the BBC Symphony give concerts that I don&#x27;t think any other orchestra in the world could do as brilliantly … That supreme virtuosity in new music makes them unique among London&#x27;s big orchestras.&quot;

==Recordings==
From their first years the BBC SO and its predecessor the BBC Wireless SO were active in commercial recording studios. Under Percy Pitt the Wireless SO recorded mostly shorter works and some that were abridged, but represented composers as diverse as Glazunov, Tchaikovsky (the entire &quot;Nutcracker Suite&quot; on six 78 rpm sides, for instance), Mendelssohn, Wolf-Ferrari, Puccini, Rimsky-Korsakov, Rossini, and Grieg, as well as a few recordings with the BBC Wireless Singers directed by Stanford Robinson. Under Boult the BBC Symphony Orchestra recorded a wide range of music from Bach to Mozart and Beethoven, Brahms, Wagner and Elgar. In the 1950s and 1960s it recorded a range of music with Sargent, mostly British but with several Sibelius discs in addition. With Doráti the orchestra made recordings of works by Bartók, Gerhard and Messiaen. Under Colin Davis it made its first opera sets: Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Idomeneo&quot; and &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, and Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot;, as well as works by Beethoven and Tippett. Under Boulez the orchestra recorded mostly twentieth century music – works by Bartók, Berg, Schoenberg and Boulez himself – and also Berlioz. Andrew Davis has recorded extensively with the orchestra for the Teldec label and others. Under Bělohlávek the orchestra has recorded Martinů&#x27;s complete symphonies, and also his &quot;The Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;.

With guest conductors, the BBC SO has recorded Elgar and Vaughan Williams under the composers, Beethoven under Toscanini, Bruno Walter and Barbirolli, and Sibelius under Beecham and Koussevitsky.

<text>The Cleveland Orchestra is an American orchestra based in Cleveland, Ohio. Founded in 1918 by the pianist and impresario Adella Prentiss Hughes, the orchestra is one of the five American orchestras informally referred to as the &quot;Big Five&quot;. The orchestra plays most of its concerts at Severance Hall. Its current music director is Franz Welser-Möst.

==History==
===Founding and early history (1918–1945)===
The Cleveland Orchestra was founded in 1918 by music-aficionado Adella Prentiss Hughes, businessman John L. Severance, Father John Powers, music critic Archie Bell, and Russian-American violinist and conductor Nikolai Sokoloff, who became the orchestra’s first music director. A former pianist, Hughes served as a local music promoter and sponsored a series of “Symphony Orchestra Concerts” designed to bring top-notch orchestral music to Cleveland. In 1915, she helped found the Musical Arts Association, which presented Cleveland performances of the Ballets Russes in 1916 and Richard Wagner’s &quot;Siegfried&quot; at the Cleveland Indians’ League Park a few months later After a great deal of planning and fundraising, The Cleveland Orchestra’s inaugural concert was performed on December 11, 1918, at Grays Armory.

Three events occurred in 1921 that proved significant in the orchestra&#x27;s early development: 
* The ensemble presented its inaugural children’s concert, which began a long-standing tradition of performing for young people from local schools. 
* The Women&#x27;s Committee of The Cleveland Orchestra was founded, a group which focused largely on internal affairs, including organization and branding; the Women&#x27;s Committee was also the driving force behind the creation of the orchestra’s education-oriented Key Concerts series decades later.
* The orchestra performed its first concert in New York City that year, at the Hippodrome Theatre, a demonstration that the orchestra was committed to embarking on major activities from early in its existence. 
In 1922, the orchestra again traveled to New York for its first concert at Carnegie Hall. Later that year, the orchestra performed its first radio broadcast and, in 1924, issued its first recording — a shortened version of Tchaikovsky’s &quot;1812 Overture&quot; for the Brunswick label under Sokoloff’s direction.

By the end of the 1920s, the Musical Arts Association began planning for a permanent concert hall for the orchestra. Board president John L. Severance and his wife, Elisabeth, pledged $1 million() toward the construction of a new hall, and the groundbreaking ceremony took place in November 1929, a few months after Mrs. Severance’s death. On February 5, 1931, the orchestra performed its inaugural concert at Severance Hall. Also that year, Lillian Baldwin created what became known as the “Cleveland Plan,” an initiative designed to build upon the orchestra’s earlier children&#x27;s concerts and create a program that taught classical music to young people before experiencing live performances.

In 1933, Sokoloff stood down as the orchestra’s music director, succeeded by Artur Rodziński. During his decade-long Cleveland tenure, Rodzinski advocated for the inclusion of staged opera at Severance Hall. The first of these productions was featured during the 1933–34 season, when the orchestra performed Wagner’s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;. In 1935, the orchestra presented the United States’ premiere of Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s &quot;Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District&quot; at Severance Hall and, later in the season, took the production to New York’s Metropolitan Opera. Four years later, in 1939, the orchestra established the Cleveland Summer Orchestra and began to perform &#x27;pops&#x27; concerts at Cleveland’s Public Hall. On December 11, 1939, The Cleveland Orchestra celebrated the anniversary of its founding by releasing its first recording on the Columbia label.

Rodzinski departed Cleveland in 1943, succeeded by Erich Leinsdorf. However, Leinsdorf&#x27;s Cleveland tenure was brief, as he was drafted into the United States Armed Forces shortly after his appointment, which diminished his artistic control. Although Leinsdorf was honorably discharged from the military in September 1944, his time away from the podium had required the Musical Arts Association to employ a number of guest conductors from 1943 until 1945, including George Szell, who had impressed audiences at Severance Hall during two weeks of performances. Leinsdorf lost much of his public support and, though still under contract, submitted his resignation in December 1945. 

===George Szell (1946–1970)===
In 1946, Szell was appointed as the orchestra’s fourth music director. From the start of his tenure, Szell&#x27;s intention was to transform the orchestra into “America’s finest” symphonic ensemble and developing an orchestra that was “second to none.” He spent much of his early time in Cleveland changing personnel in an effort to find musicians who were capable of creating his ideal orchestral sound. Szell’s stringent standards and expectations for musical precision were reflected in his contract with the Musical Arts Association, which gave him complete artistic control over programming, scheduling, personnel, and recording.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Szell was instrumental in the achievement of several orchestra milestones:
* He led the orchestra on its first European tour, in 1957, across Europe and behind the Iron Curtain.
* Szell pushed to change Severance Hall&#x27;s acoustic properties, which he considered to be too “dry.” Major renovations were made during the 1958–59 season, including the construction of the “Szell Shell”, which was designed to project the orchestra&#x27;s sound in a manner that created better balance among musicians and a clearer string section. 
A second European tour took place in 1965, and included a significant tour of the Soviet Union, with performances in Moscow, Kiev, Tbilisi, Yerevan, Sochi, and Leningrad. Two years later, the orchestra became the first American orchestra to be invited to three premiere festivals, in Salzburg, Lucerne, and Edinburgh, in the same summer. Szell also oversaw the opening of the orchestra&#x27;s summer home, Blossom Music Center, in 1968, which provided the ensemble’s musicians with year-round employment. In 1970, after a tenure of 24 years, shortly after a tour of the Far East during the spring of 1970, which included stops in Japan, Korea, and Alaska, Szell died.

Two days after Szell’s death, the orchestra played its scheduled program at Blossom Music Center with Aaron Copland taking the podium as guest conductor. Louis Lane, one of Szell’s assistant conductors, was appointed resident conductor. Pierre Boulez, who had been named the orchestra&#x27;s principal guest conductor in 1969, was appointed musical advisor.

===Lorin Maazel (1972–1982)===
The board selected Lorin Maazel as the orchestra’s fifth music director. His tenure began in 1972. Maazel had first conducted the orchestra at age 13 in 1943, in a concert at Public Hall. During Maazel&#x27;s tenure, many critics were initially unimpressed with his musical interpretations, which they believed were too emotionally charged to follow Szell’s razor-crisp style. But soon Maazel was lifted by an endorsement from Philadelphia Orchestra conductor Eugene Ormandy and the promise of a new collaboration with Decca Records on Prokofiev’s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, which proved to be the spark Maazel needed to jumpstart his Cleveland Orchestra career. During the 1973–74 season, Maazel led the orchestra on a tour of Australia and New Zealand, joined by guest conductors Stanislaw Skrowaczewski and Erich Leinsdorf. The orchestra also played a series of concerts in Japan. During the following season, the orchestra released its first commercial recording of an opera, George Gershwin’s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, which was also Decca’s first opera recording in the United States. Maazel left the orchestra after the 1981–82 season, to take over the directorship of the Vienna State Opera. Before his departure, however, Maazel helped to introduce the orchestra’s landmark Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration Concerts in January 1980, which remain an annual tradition to this day. On May 15, 1982, Maazel conducted his final performance at Severance Hall followed by a short tour of New York and New Haven, where he led concerts featuring Giuseppe Verdi’s &quot;Requiem&quot;, which had been his debut piece with the orchestra in 1972.

===Christoph von Dohnányi (1984–2002)===
Christoph von Dohnányi first guest-conducted the orchestra in December 1981. In 1982, the orchestra named Dohnányi its music director-designate in 1982. He officially became music director in 1984. During the pair of seasons between Maazel and Dohnányi, various guest conductors conducted the orchestra, including Erich Leinsdorf, who labeled himself the “bridge between the regimes.”

Because of Dohnányi’s connections with Teldec, Decca/London, and Telarc, his Cleveland Orchestra tenure began with the promise of more recording projects. He also staged a large production of Mozart’s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; at Blossom Music Center in 1985, which was lauded as “the Ohio musical event of the summer” by &quot;The Columbus Dispatch&quot;. In addition, Dohnányi oversaw the hiring of Jahja Ling, who would lead the newly established Cleveland Orchestra Youth Orchestra. International touring continued under Dohnányi with visits to Asia and Europe, including the development of a long-standing relationship with the Salzburg Festival beginning in 1990.

To celebrate The Cleveland Orchestra’s 75th anniversary, Dohnányi led performances of Wagner’s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; at Severance Hall across the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons, and a subsequent recording project of Wagner’s &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; and &quot;Die Walküre&quot;. The orchestra also began a fundraising campaign for the renovation of Severance Hall, which included the removal of the “Szell Shell,” a return of the ensemble&#x27;s E.M. Skinner organ to the stage, and a facilities expansion designed to enhance the experience of concertgoers. During these renovations, the orchestra performed concerts for its hometown audiences at the Allen Theatre in Cleveland’s Playhouse Square. On January 8, 2000, Dohnányi led a gala concert celebrating the re-opening of Severance Hall that was broadcast live on local television by Cleveland’s WVIZ. 

At the conclusion of Dohnányi’s contract, in 2002, he took the title of music director laureate.

===Franz Welser-Möst (2002–&quot;2027&quot;)===
Franz Welser-Möst became the orchestra&#x27;s seventh music director in 2002. Welser-Möst and the Musical Arts Association have extended his contract several times, with his most recent contract keeping him on the podium until 2027, which will make him the orchestra&#x27;s longest-serving music director. During his tenure, Welser-Möst has overseen many of the orchestra&#x27;s residencies, outreach programs, and expansion activities. He leads the orchestra&#x27;s ongoing residencies at the Musikverein in Vienna and at the Lucerne Festival, both of which began with Welser-Möst&#x27;s first European tour in 2003. In addition, Welser-Möst and the orchestra began an annual residency at Miami&#x27;s Carnival Center for the Performing Arts (later renamed the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts) in 2007. The orchestra has continued to present operas and a selection of film screenings with live musical accompaniment. On September 29, 2018, Welser-Möst led the ensemble in a gala concert at Severance Hall celebrating the orchestra’s 100th anniversary, a concert later featured on the American arts television series &quot;Great Performances&quot; during an exclusive U.S. broadcast on PBS. 

In early 2020, the orchestra suspended a planned tour of Europe and Abu Dhabi, and live concerts at Severance Hall and Blossom Music Center due to the COVID-19 pandemic. That October, the orchestra launched the Adella App, a streaming service including historical and newly created content. Access to the service was free to season subscribers and $35 per month for non-subscribers. In 2020, The Cleveland Orchestra announced they had started their own recording label, self-titled as The Cleveland Orchestra. A limited in-person return to concerts was announced for Blossom Music Center for the Summer of 2021, with a return to Severance Hall planned for October.

In October 2023, Welser-Möst underwent surgery for the removal of a cancerous tumor, and announced curtailment of his performances during the remainder of 2023. In January 2024, the orchestra announced that Welser-Möst is to conclude his tenure as its music director at the close of the 2026-2027 season.

===Additional history===
In addition to a vast catalog of recordings created with the ensemble&#x27;s music directors, the orchestra has made many recordings with guest conductors Vladimir Ashkenazy, Oliver Knussen, Kurt Sanderling, Yoel Levi, Riccardo Chailly, George Benjamin, Roberto Carnevale, Riccardo Muti, Michael Tilson Thomas, and Louis Lane (the orchestra&#x27;s longtime Associate Conductor). Past assistant conductors of the Cleveland Orchestra include Matthias Bamert, James Levine, Alan Gilbert, James Judd and Michael Stern.

<text>Frederica Montseny i Mañé (; 1905–1994) was a Spanish anarchist and intellectual who served as Minister of Health and Social Assistance in the government of the Second Spanish Republic during the Civil War. She is known for being the first woman in Spanish history to be a cabinet minister and one of the first female ministers in Western Europe.

She was also known as a novelist and essayist. She published about fifty short novels with a romantic-social background aimed specifically at women of the proletarian class, as well as political, ethical, biographical and autobiographical writings (see &quot;García Guirao, Pedro (1988)&quot; in &quot;Further reading&quot; below.)

==Early life==
Frederica Montseny i Mañé was born on 12 February 1905 in Madrid, Spain. She was the sole surviving child of Joan Montseny and Teresa Mañé, both teachers and anarchists of Catalan extraction. They lived in Madrid because the 1896 Barcelona Corpus Christi procession bombing had led to her father being imprisoned and then exiled. The couple returned to Spain secretly and settled in the capital. From 1898, her parents jointly edited the fortnightly journal &quot;La Revista Blanca&quot;, one of the most significant anarchist publications of the time. The family put its savings into a house on the outskirts of Madrid. The developer that built the house threatened to sue her father when the latter accused him of stealing from the poor by taking money for houses that were never built. This forced the family to leave and spend the next years moving frequently and surviving occasional writing and farming. During Montseny&#x27;s childhood, the Civil Guard would frequently visit the family home searching for her father. She would let them in as slowly as possible in order to give him time to hide.

Montseny was educated at home by her parents. After Montseny acquired basic reading and writing skills, her mother used progressive didactic methods to foster Montseny&#x27;s curiosity, providing her with a wide range of reading material in order to encourage her to pursue her own intellectual interests. Montseny became acquainted with literature as well as social and political theory. She also credits the rural environment she grew up in with shaping her intellectual development. Throughout her life, she would return to nature when grappling with social questions.

==Spanish Civil War and Minister of Health==
Following the Spanish coup of July 1936, Montseny resolved to support the republican faction against the nationalists, considering a united front of anti-fascists to be necessary for the advancement of anarchism in Spain. Despite her support for the republicans, she quickly came to reject the violence in the republican-held territory, which she described as &quot;a lust for blood inconceivable in honest man before&quot;.

In November 1936, Francisco Largo Caballero invited the anarchists to join the Spanish government, as they were the largest of the anti-fascist groups and the other parties of the Popular Front wanted to neutralise their anti-statism. In an interview with Burnett Bolloten, Montseny explained that the principal impulse for the anarchists to join the government was their concern about the rise of the Communist Party to power, which they viewed as a threat to the Revolution. Despite her own misgivings about joining the government, Montseny was appointed as Minister of Health and Social Assistance, becoming the first woman in Spanish history to be a cabinet minister.
From her ministerial post, Montseny oversaw the country&#x27;s medical facilities, which had been completely overwhelmed by the conditions of the war, requiring the construction of orphanages and the provision of aid for refugees. She also collaborated with the Mujeres Libres in the advancement of women&#x27;s rights, carrying out a series of wide-ranging reforms including: the introduction of child care for women in the workforce and the militias; the provision of women&#x27;s education and healthcare; and the combatting of prostitution in Spain.

Soon after Montseny took office, on 6 November, the republican government moved to Valencia, fearing that Madrid would fall to the nationalist offensive. Montseny persuaded the anarchist militia leader Buenaventura Durruti to transfer from the Aragon front and defend the capital, where he fought and died at the Battle of Ciudad Universitaria. When the anarchists of Barcelona revolted during the May Days, Montseny appealed on behalf of the government for the militias to lay down their arms. But when she was unsuccessful, the government resolved to put down the anarchists by force, in what Montseny described as &quot;the most terrible and bitter days of my life&quot;. By the time that Juan Negrin had consolidated power, Montseny considered the war to have already been lost, and thought the only remaining action would be to save as many lives as possible. Montseny subsequently left the cabinet and attempted to continue her efforts in uniting republican forces, but by 1938, the deterioration of the republican front had forced her to increasingly focus on feeding her family.

== Exile ==
In February 1939, Montseny and her family were forced to flee into exile by the nationalist offensive into Catalonia. Her mother died in Perpignan, while her father was imprisoned and her husband was held in an internment camp. She later wrote in her book &quot;Pasión y Muerte de los Españoles refugiados en Francia&quot;, that the regulations in place in organisations such as the Worker’s Companies were designed to defeat the spirit of the Republican exiles and create a battalion of obedient slaves. Montseny initially relocated to Paris, where she helped in the relocation of Spanish refugees, in spite of her own struggle to make ends meet. 

During the Nazi occupation of France, Montseny fled into hiding in Occitania, where she was detained by the authorities of the French State. Although the French authorities had orders to extradite her to Spain, they eventually released Montseny, as she was pregnant with her youngest child.
In 1942, Montseny and her family attempted to relocate to Mexico, but their route was blocked by the war in North Africa, while both the Allies and Axis prevented any further emigration of Spanish refugees from France, forcing them to stay in Toulouse. Following the liberation of France, Montseny took part in the reorganization of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo in exile and edited the organization&#x27;s weekly newspaper. From Toulouse, she also wrote a weekly column in the French language anarchist newspaper &quot;Espoir&quot; and edited the journal &quot;Cénit&quot;. She briefly returned to Spain during the transition to democracy, during which her works were finally being republished. Following the death of her youngest daughter in 1977 and her husband in 1981, Montseny penned an autobiography, which was published in 1987.

Frederica Montseny i Mañé died in Toulouse on 14 January 1994, at the age of 88.

==Personal life==

In 1930, Montseny began a free love relationship with Germinal Esgleas. The couple had three children together: her eldest daughter Vida was born in 1933; her son Germinal was born in June 1938; and her youngest daughter Blanca was born in 1941. She attempted to raise her daughters to be &quot;free women&quot; and her son to respect women, but when interviewed about this she remarked that she had been largely unsuccessful, due to the strong hold that traditional gender roles still had.

==Legacy==
Several streets, parks and schools are named in her memory in Spain, especially in Catalonia, and in cities like Paris.

<doc id="148697" wikidata="Q1066725" url="?curid=148697" title="Jean Balue">
<text>Jean Balue (5 October 1491) was a French cardinal and minister of Louis XI. Born without resources, he managed to climb the political ladder by exploiting connections, to whom he often did not remain loyal, and by making himself an indispensable agent of the king&#x27;s purposes in a time of political disorder in France. His services were as much military as ecclesiastical, bringing him the critical task of defending the city of Paris against the King&#x27;s enemies. His work as a diplomat in dealing with Duke Francis of Brittany and with Charles de France brought him the office of first minister to the King. Balue overreached himself in negotiating a treaty between the King and Charles the Bold, who had become Duke of Burgundy and was trying to recover all his family inheritance. Secret correspondence revealed that he might have been playing both sides in the negotiation, and he was arrested, and held on charges of treason from 1469 to 1481, while King and Pope argued over jurisdiction. After the death of King Louis and Pope Sixtus, the new French king, Charles VIII, appointed Balue his ambassador in Rome.

==Biography==
He was born of very humble parentage at Angles-sur-l&#x27;Anglin in Poitou. The date of his birth is conjectured to be around 1421, based on his epitaph in Santa Prassede in Rome, in which he is said to have died as Legate of the Marches while in his seventies, &quot;Legatum agens septuagenarius gloriose obiit.&quot; The word &#x27;septuagenarian&#x27; is somewhat elastic. Jean Balue had a brother Antoine and a brother Nicolas.

He was first patronized by the bishop of Poitiers, Jacques Juvénel des Ursins (1449–1457). By December 1457 Balue had obtained a Licenciate in law, perhaps from the University of Angers.

In 1461 Balue is still referred to as &#x27;clericus&#x27;, but by 1465 he is called a priest. These are the parameters for his date of ordination to the priesthood. Likewise in 1461 he was given the Deanship of Candé by his new patron, Bishop Jean de Beauvau of Angers.

===Canon Balue===

In 1461 he became vicar-general (Grand Vicar) of the bishop of Angers, Jean de Beauvau (1447–1467), and was named a Canon of the Cathedral of Saint-Mauritius. In 1462 he accompanied Bishop de Beauvau to Rome in the embassy which was sent to present the homage of the new King of France, Louis XI, to Pope Pius II, and to engage in negotiations concerning the revocation of the Pragmatic Sanction, as well as the French claims to the Kingdom of Naples. The leader of the embassy was Bishop Jean Jouffroy of Arras, who had been named a cardinal on 18 December 1461. During this visit Balue was named a Protonotary Apostolic by the Pope. On their return to Angers, Bishop de Beauvau wanted to reward Balue with the grant of the prebend of S. Marguerite in the Cathedral Chapter, which had just fallen vacant on the death of the Dean of the Chapter. The prebend, however, was in the gift of the Chapter, not the bishop, and they protested successfully to the Pope, who granted the prebend to the Chapter&#x27;s candidate on 21 January 1463. Not satisfied with the result, Balue carried an appeal to the King. In Paris he got in touch with Thibault de Vitry, a Canon of Paris who held the office of Treasurer of the Cathedral Chapter of Angers as a benefice. He was introduced to the Lieutenant-General of Paris and the Île-de-France, Charles de Melun, whose father was Governor of Champagne and Brie and Governor of the Bastille. Melun in due course presented Balue to the King. Louis XI granted letters patent on 15 September 1463 ordering the Chapter to hand over the prebend to Balue.

On 10 February 1464, at the request of King Louis, the Pope granted Balue a new Canonry in the Cathedral Chapter of Angers which had fallen vacant.

His activity, cunning, and mastery of manipulation gained him the appreciation of Louis XI, who made him his almoner in 1464 and one of his secretaries. Balue&#x27;s ambitions then got him into trouble. He looked to succeed Vitry, who had just died, as Treasurer of Angers, and on 23 March 1464 made his claim. But Bishop de Beauvau held a bull of Pius II which granted him the gift of an abbey or any other benefice which happened to become vacant. Beauvau wanted the Treasurership for his own purposes. The Canons of the Cathedral opposed Balue out of respect for the bishop, but, on 20 April a cleric of Paris, Jacques Chaumort appeared in Angers with a mandate from the King, ordering the Canons to allow Balue to enjoy the fruits of the office of Treasurer. The Canons complied. This was the end of the friendship and patronage of Bishop de Beauvau.

Balue also acquired a number of other benefices during the year 1464. He was made Abbot Commendatory of Fécamp, Abbot Commendatory of Saint-Thierry de Reims, and (in 1465) Abbot Commendatory of Saint-Jean-d&#x27;Angély. He was also named Prior of Saint-Eloi-de-Paris, and (in 1465) Saint-Jean-des-Sables.

On 26 December, King Louis named Balue a Councilor clerk in Parliament, and on 28 December he granted Balue the privilege of conferring a wide range of benefices which were in the gift of the King. These included bursaries at the Collège de Navarre, benefices at the Hôtels-Dieu, hospitals for the sick and almonries.

===Bishop Balue===

Bishop Guillaume de Flocques of Évreux died on 27 November 1464, and on 18 December the King assigned the temporalities of the Diocese of Évreux to Jean Balue. Then, on 4 February 1465, King Louis XI nominated Balue to the bishopric of Évreux; he was elected by the Cathedral Chapter on 5 February; and he was preconised (approved) by Pope Pius II on 20 May 1465. His consecration took place in Paris at Notre-Dame on 4 August, with Bishop Guillaume Chartier of Paris acting as principal consecrator. Balue took possession of his diocese in person on 22 August 1465. On 27 August the King granted Balue a subsidy from the &quot;gabelle&quot; to allow him to resume work on the restoration of the Cathedral, which had begun under the patronage of Charles VII but which had ceased from lack of funds.

Bishop Jean de Beauvau of Angers was excommunicated by his Metropolitan, the Archbishop of Tours, on 13 November 1465, for various acts of insubordination. Beauvau refused to accept the sentence, and appealed to the Pope, claiming to be exempt from the jurisdiction of the Archbishop. But after some exchanges, Beauvau was summoned to appear before the courts in Rome. He refused to go, demonstrating yet again his commitment to Gallican liberties and the Pragmatic Sanction. Finally, under pressure from King Louis XI, Pope Paul II issued a decree of deposition on 5 June 1467, and on the same day he issued a bull transferring Bishop Jean Balue from the diocese of Évreux to the diocese of Angers. Bishop de Beauvau attempted to appeal to the Parliament of Paris against the Pope, but the King ordered the Parliament not to take cognizance of the case. Balue had replaced his former patron.

In the War of the Public Weal (&quot;Bien Publique&quot;), Bishop Balue and Charles Melun were assigned to the task of defending the city of Paris for the King. Melun was named Lieutenant-General, and Balue was ordered to see to the defenses. Neither was to leave Paris for the duration. On 13 July 1465, King Louis notified Marechal Rouault at Paris that it was his intention to fight on the next day, and he ordered Rouault&#x27;s presence. Rouault asked Balue and Melun what he should do. Balue advised him to go to the King with his entire army, Melun opposed him. The Battle of Montlhéry was not decisive, but Louis conceived the idea that Melun had been prepared to betray him if the battle had been lost. He stripped Melun of everything that he had. On 5 October 1465 Louis was constrained to sign the Treaty of Conflans with Charles, Count of Charolais. On 23 December 1465 King Louis signed the Treaty of Caen with Duke Francis II of Brittany, and Balue, one of the cosigners, was ordered to keep watch on the Dukes of Burgundy and Brittany and provide the King with counsel as necessary.

In February 1466, Bishop Balue and Admiral de Montauban were sent to Nantes, where Duke Francis of Brittany had taken up residence. They were to continue discussions on Francis&#x27; proposals made at Caen, and also to take the measure of the envoys of Charles de France, Guillaume de Harancourt, the Bishop of Verdun, Charles&#x27; Chancellor; and Pierre Doriole, his Intendant of Finances. A most important goal was to get Charles himself away from Duke Francis and back to the company of the King. The rumor went round about that the Admiral explained privately to Charles what might happen to him if he returned to the King—as though Charles could not work that out himself. Whether true or not, Charles flatly refused the King&#x27;s request and Balue had to give a completely negative report of the mission. Things might have become worse if the Admiral had not died on 1 May. At the end of the year Bishop Balue was sent back to Nantes, this time along with Guillaume de Paris, as Ambassadors of the King of France, to protest Louis&#x27; desire for good relations with Francis of Brittany, but to inquire about rumored dealings with the English. Francis disavowed any sinister implications, but it was discovered that the Duke and Duchess of Savoy were in Brittany, negotiating a league against King Louis. Balue returned and joined the King at Blois in February 1467.

===Cardinal Balue===

King Louis IX made Bishop Jean Balue &quot;le premier du grant conseil&quot;. Thomas Basin remarks that the King held Balue to be &quot;velut fidissimum omnium mortalium hominum amicum&quot; (&#x27;practically the most trusted friend in the world&#x27;). In spite of his bad reputation for greed and disloyalty, the King requested and obtained for him a cardinalate. This was in gratitude for his finally negotiating the revocation of the Pragmatic Sanction, which was registered by the Parlement of Paris on 1 October 1467. Balue was named a cardinal by Pope Paul II in his first Consistory for the creation of cardinals on 18 September 1467, and was assigned the titular church of Santa Susanna, but not until the Consistory of 13 May 1468. He received his red hat in a ceremony in Notre-Dame in Paris on 17 November 1468.

In May 1467, Balue and Jean d&#x27;Estouteville were sent to Paris to engage in a mass enrollment of men to defend the city of Paris against the King&#x27;s enemies. On 15 June, Charles the Bold became Duke of Burgundy. He was determined to recover territories which his father had sold to Louis XI to raise money for a crusade. These included Picardy, and Amiens. The prince-bishopric of Liège tried three times to revolt against the Duke (1465, 1467, 1468), each time with support promised by Louis XI, which repeatedly failed to materialize. On 20 September 1468, a conference was begun at Ham, between the delegates of King Louis (the Constable de Saint-Pol, Pierre Doriole, and Cardinal Balue) and those of Charles the Bold, who was encamped at Peronne, to arrange a peace between the two contenders and detach Duke Charles from Duke Francis of Brittany. The Cardinal, it seems, was attempting to keep the King from being seduced by the promises of the Duke.

In April 1469 Cardinal Balue accompanied the King and participated in the Estates General at Tours.

On 14 October 1469 King Louis, advised by his friend Cardinal Balue, consented to the terms of the Peace which Balue had negotiated with Charles the Bold.

====Imprisoned====

But Balue shortly became compromised in the king’s humiliation by Charles the Bold at Péronne, as more and more important persons expressed disapproval of the treaty. Even people in the streets began to mock the King and his treaty. Louis decided to place all of the blame on Balue, who found himself excluded from the Council. He then intrigued with Charles against the King, revealing details of the King&#x27;s secret plans. Their secret correspondence was intercepted by accident when, in April 1469, a suspicious priest was fortuitously arrested. On 23 April 1469 Balue was arrested at Amboise, and then transferred to Montbazon. The King was intent on putting Balue on trial for treason before royal judges, and Louis appointed a commission of eight men to find out the truth and mete out the punishment; but that raised the old issue of the exemption of clerics from civil jurisdiction; a cleric could only be tried in an ecclesiastical forum in accordance with Canon Law, and that was the position of Pope Sixtus IV. There was an impasse, which neither party wanted to take the responsibility for solving. King Louis sent an agent to Rome, Pierre Gruel, a President of the Parlement of Grenoble to explain the situation to the Pope. He was joined in November by Guillaume Cousinot, Sieur de Montreuil, and a lawyer Guillaume Lefranc. The ambassadors were received by the Pope on 1 December 1469, and a long series of discussions and debates ensued, which finally ended in an agreement to disagree as to who had the right and obligation to proceed against Balue. At the end of January 1470 Cardinal Balue was removed to Onzain on orders of Louis XI, but by 2 July 1472 he was being kept at Chinon. In May 1472 Cardinal Bessarion was sent as Legate to France, and he held discussions with Louis XI about the release of Balue, but without success. He remained a prisoner for eleven years, but not, as has been alleged, in an iron cage. His accomplice, the Bishop of Verdun, Guillaume d&#x27;Harancourt, was kept in the Bastile. The charge was &quot;lèse-majesté&quot;.

In Angers the Vicars of Cardinal Balue remained loyal and resisted the pressures from the Cathedral Chapter and the King until 1472, when they renounced the exercise of their functions under threat of royal fines. In March 1476 Pope Sixtus IV took the extraordinary step of relieving Bishop Jean de Beauvau of the various ecclesiastical censures which he had incurred, and returning his former benefices; his various acts were ratified. He was then named Apostolic Administrator of the diocese of Angers, superseding the Cardinal and his officers. Beauvau exercised this office until his death on 23 April 1479. The Chapter immediately elected as his successor a royal favorite, Auger de Brie (1479–1480). With Auger&#x27;s appointment, a schism developed in the Chapter of the Cathedral of Angers, some Canons supporting the King&#x27;s man, others supporting Cardinal Balue. The King wrote to the Pope about the situation, but the most that the Pope was prepared to do was to appoint a Coadjutor for Cardinal Balue.

In June 1480, Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere was sent to France as Legate to make peace between Louis XI and Maximilian of Austria, as well as to negotiate the release of Balue and Harancourt. He reached Paris in September, and finally, on 20 December 1480, King Louis gave orders that Balue be handed over to the Archpriest of Loudun, who had been commissioned by the Legate to receive him in the name of the Pope.

====Released====
In February 1481 his departure from France was delayed by illness, for which he had already been under medical treatment at Chinon, but he arrived in Lucca at the beginning of Spring. There he waited for a commission of Cardinals to decide his fate; the commission, headed by Cardinal Olivier Carafa, did not begin its meetings until 30 January 1482. On 26 February 1482, Pope Sixtus reestablished Balue in all his rights and all his dignities. Notwithstanding the work of the commission, Cardinal Balue received permission to enter Rome along with Cardinal della Rovere, who was returning from his mission as Legate to France. On 31 January 1483, Pope Sixtus named Cardinal Balue suburbicarian Bishop of Albano, making clear to all where his sympathies lay. On the same day Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere was named suburbicarian Bishop of Ostia. Della Rovere and Balue were met at the gate of Rome by nearly all the Cardinals on 3 February 1483, and shortly thereafter were received in public Consistory.

===Rome===
From that time Cardinal Balue lived in high favour at the court of Rome. King Louis XI died on 30 August 1483, thereby closing a chapter of struggle over Balue&#x27;s status. In 1484 Balue was sent to France as Legate &quot;a latere&quot;, by Pope Sixtus IV, but he was not received there as such. He did visit his diocese of Angers, and was solemnly received on 24 July 1484. He made a solemn entry into Paris on 20 August 1484. He returned to Rome on 8 February 1485.

Pope Sixtus IV had died on 12 August 1484, while Balue was in Angers. He did not participate in the Conclave that elected Pope Innocent VIII on 29 August.

In February 1485 Cardinal Balue was named French ambassador to the Court of Rome and Protector of France by King Charles VIII. He and Cardinal della Rovere were to work to bring Innocent VIII over to the French side, and to favor the French claim, in the person of René of Anjou, to the Kingdom of Naples. On 5 March 1486, arguments in Consistory between Cardinal Balue and Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, a relative and supporter of Ferdinand of Naples, grew so heated that Pope Innocent had to silence them both. Envoys of Charles VIII and René reached Rome in May 1486, prepared to conclude negotiations, but the diplomacy of Ferdinand of Aragon, the operations of the condottiere Broccolino Guzzoli, and the appearance of Turkish ships in the Adriatic, put a stop to the French adventure.

In 1485, following the wishes of Pope Innocent VIII, Cardinal Balue instituted the Feast of the Visitation in the diocese of Angers, to which, however, he never returned.

On 14 March 1491, Cardinal Balue was promoted Bishop of Palestrina.

He died at Ripatransone, a village fifty-six miles south of Ancona, where he was serving as Rector of the Marches of Ancona, on 5 October 1491. His funeral took place in Rome on 18 October, and he was buried in the chapel he had built in Santa Prassede. The Pope was his heir since the Cardinal had left no Last Will and Testament, and the rumor reported by Joannes Burchard, the Master of Ceremonies, was that he was worth some 100,000 ducats.

<text>USS &quot;Captor&quot; (PYc-40), briefly the seventh ship to bear the name USS &quot;Eagle&quot; (AM-132), was a Q-ship of the United States Navy.

Built as Harvard, a steel-hulled trawler, in 1938 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation&#x27;s Fore River Shipyard, Quincy, Massachusetts, and handed over to General Sea Foods Corporation, Boston, and put into service as Wave.

==Service history==

===Minesweeper===
The fishing trawler was acquired by the Navy as part of the Auxiliary Vessels Act on 1 January 1942. Reporting to the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, the trawler began conversion to war service as a minesweeper on 8 January. With the work complete on 28 February, she was named &quot;Eagle&quot;, given the hull classification symbol AM-132, and placed in commission on 5 March 1942, with Lieutenant Commander Leroy E. Rogers, USNR, in command.

===Q-ship===
Along with and , &quot;Eagle&quot; was selected
early to participate in a secret &quot;Q-ship&quot; program. The intention was to disguise the ship as a defenseless civilian vessel and, after luring an enemy submarine into close quarters on the surface, open fire with hidden guns and sink the unsuspecting U-boat. For this reason, &quot;Eagle&quot; remained at Portsmouth, where she underwent further conversion into a Q-ship and received weapons and sonar gear. During this second conversion, the minesweeper was renamed &quot;Captor&quot; and redesignated PYc-40 on 18 April. With alterations complete on 19 May, the vessel reported for duty with the 1st Naval District at Boston.

Unlike the other four ships eventually in the Q-ship program, &quot;Captor&quot; did not sail in convoys or along coastal shipping routes. Instead, she operated in the waters near Boston – in Massachusetts Bay, north to Casco Bay, east to the Georges Bank, and south to Nantucket Sound and Rhode Island Sound. While at sea, the disguised Q-ship also helped cover the coastal convoy routes coming north from New York. As growing air and sea patrols had driven most U-boats away from the New England coast in May 1942, &quot;Captor&quot; had little chance to spot an enemy submarine and ended her wartime career without a single sighting.

With the decline in the U-boat threat to the east coast of the United States late in the war, &quot;Captor&quot; was decommissioned at Boston on 4 October 1944. Stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 14 October 1944, the trawler was transferred to the War Shipping Administration and sold on 21 February 1945.

In 1959, the ship was acquired for use as a fishing boat, and renamed &quot;Wave&quot;. She passed through several owners over the following decades while serving in this capacity. In 2005, she was acquired by R &amp; J Shipping Inc and returned to her original name &quot;Harvard&quot;. She went out of documentation in 2009, with her final fate unknown.

As of 2005, no other ship in the United States Navy has been named &quot;Captor&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Asterion&quot; (AK-100, AK-63, WAK-123) was a Q-ship of the United States Navy named for Asterion, a star in the constellation Canes Venatici.

==Civilian merchant ship==
SS &quot;Evelyn&quot;, a steel-hulled, single-screw steamer, was laid down on 17 January 1912, by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, launched on 9 May 1912; and delivered to the A. H. Bull Steamship Lines on 11 June 1912.

For the next 30 years, &quot;Evelyn&quot; operated between ports on the eastern seaboard of the United States and the West Indies, carrying passengers and freight. During World War I, she was inspected in the 3d Naval District on 9 January 1918, for possible naval service and was assigned the identification number Id. No. 2228. However, she was not actually taken over. Remaining a merchantman, she received a Navy armed guard detachment who protected her between 31 January and 11 November 1918.

==World War II==

===Q-ship===
&quot;Evelyn&quot; pursued her prosaic calling under the house flag of the Bull Line through the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. In a dispatch dated 31 January 1942, the Chief of Naval Operations ordered that &quot;Evelyn&quot; and &quot;Carolyn&quot; &quot;be given a preliminary conversion to AK (cargo ship) in the shortest possible time.&quot; A 12 February letter from the Chief of the Bureau of Ships made it known that the conversion and outfitting of the vessels was desired &quot;by 1 March 1942.&quot;

Acquired by the navy from the Bull Line early in 1942, &quot;Evelyn&quot; was renamed &quot;Asterion&quot; and classified as the cargo ship AK-100. That designation, however, was strictly a cover, for &quot;Asterion&quot;, like her sister ship (the former SS &quot;Carolyn&quot;) was in fact a Q-ship. While this &quot;ruse de guerre&quot; had worked moderately well in World War I, it was at best a stop-gap measure adopted in the hope of ending a rash of sinkings of merchantmen in American coastal waters. Given a main battery, machine guns and depth charge gear hidden in concealed positions, &quot;Asterion&quot; was placed in commission at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in early March 1942. While on patrol, she would answer friendly requests for identification as the SS &quot;Evelyn&quot;, but if enemy ships should challenge, she would reply as SS &quot;Generalife&quot; of Spanish registry, callsign EAOQ.

After brief sea trials, &quot;Asterion&quot; sailed for her assigned patrol area on 23 March 1942, in company of &quot;Atik&quot;. Each ship was to proceed independently under the guise of a tramp steamer, in the hope of luring a U-boat to the surface and destroying the submarine with gunfire before she realized what was happening. Once out at sea, the two vessels parted company.

One day out, &quot;Asterion&quot; picked up a submarine contact on her underwater detection gear. Two days later, however, her radios picked up ominous traffic. &quot;Atik&quot; had been torpedoed. Then, after luring her assailant, , to the surface with her &quot;tramp&quot; steamer guise, &quot;Atik&quot; had fired on the U-boat, but succeeded only in mortally wounding an officer on the submarine&#x27;s bridge before the German captain broke off the action and cleared the area to await nightfall and a second crack at the Q-ship. &quot;U-123&quot; delivered the &quot;coup de grâce&quot; that evening, and &quot;Atik&quot; exploded and sank. &quot;Asterion&quot; plodded immediately to the assistance of &quot;Atik&quot;, but, when she arrived on the scene, found only wreckage. Not a man in &quot;Atik&quot;&#x27;s crew had survived. &quot;Asterion&quot; arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 31 March 1942.

She set out for her second cruise on 4 April, and that afternoon, witnessed the torpedoing of the tanker SS &quot;Comol Rio&quot; by . A destroyer arrived on the scene shortly thereafter and took up the search after &quot;Asterion&quot; had picked up a sound contact.

Various contacts with friendly surface craft and aircraft on this patrol and the previous one led to awkward situations which required tact and ingenuity on the part of the commanding officer to preserve the Q-ship&#x27;s cover story. That cover story was maintained; officers in Headquarters, Eastern Sea Frontier, were so completely unaware of the nature of this ship&#x27;s mission that they recorded her various dispatches in the Enemy Action Diary for 4, 10 and 14 April under her commercial name, SS &quot;Evelyn&quot;.

Operating off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, on 14 April, &quot;Asterion&quot; rescued the 55 men of the crew of a British merchantman that had been torpedoed earlier—saving even the captain&#x27;s dog. She entered New York harbor on 18 April and there disembarked the sailors she had rescued, cautioning them not to tell anyone of what they had seen on board the Q-ship.

Asterion&#x27;s third cruise commenced on 4 May 1942, from New York, and she sailed between Key West and Norfolk, proceeding as an independently routed merchantman or as a straggler from a convoy. The fourth cruise commenced on 7 June 1942, and, due to increased submarine activity in the Gulf of Mexico, the Q-ship set course for those dangerous waters. Clearing New York, she sailed down the eastern seaboard, transited the Straits of Florida on 11 June, passed the Dry Tortugas on 14 June; and thence steamed to the Yucatán Channel. Reversing course, she moved to the Mississippi River Delta whence she continued on a westerly course toward Galveston, Texas. She then returned to New York on 6 July.

Departing New York a fortnight later, &quot;Asterion&quot; went directly to Key West and then sailed north of the Bahamas to the Windward Passage. Returning to New York on 18 August, &quot;Asterion&quot; sailed at the end of the month for her sixth cruise, which took her through the waters that she had
traversed on the fifth patrol. On 25 September 1942, she was redesignated AK-63. Commencing her seventh cruise on 18 November, the ship proceeded to Key West and, while there, carried out training exercises on 30 November with a friendly submarine.

On 2 December 1942, &quot;Asterion&quot; got underway for the British West Indies and, going via the Old Bahama Channel, followed the convoy route to Trinidad and Tobago, patrolling to the westward of Aruba, in the Dutch West Indies. Departing Trinidad on the day after Christmas the ship headed home and arrived at New York on 10 January 1943.

Over the next few months, &quot;Asterion&quot; underwent an extensive overhaul, involving the strengthening of her whole structure and modification of her armament. Inspection after her sixth cruise raised considerable doubt as to her ability to remain afloat if hit by even a single torpedo because she had three large holds. A representative of the New York Navy Yard conferred with the Bureau of Ships, Damage Section, who confirmed the opinion that she could not successfully withstand a torpedo hit, and that such a hit would result not only in her eventual sinking but also in such a quick list that her battery would be ineffective. (This weakness almost certainly was responsible for the rapid sinking of &quot;Atik&quot;.) A conference held in the office of the Vice Chief of Naval Operations decided to increase flotation by building five transverse bulkheads. It was estimated that this would take three months and that it would cost about US$200,000. The work took much longer and cost much more than estimated. Not until 27 September was the overhaul completed—more than eight months after the end of &quot;Asterion&quot;″s latest cruise. The overhaul included re-subdivision by longitudinal and athwart ship bulkheads, the filling of her holds with 16,772 empty steel flotation drums. The Supervising Constructor estimated that the vessel could be completely flooded and 25% of the barrels completely crushed before her well decks would be awash. Thus it seemed probable that she had an excellent chance of remaining afloat if a U-boat made a successful attack on her.

&quot;Asterion&quot; then steamed to New London, Connecticut, and beginning on 4 September, operated with American submarines in training. After returning briefly to New York, from 18 to 20 September, she resumed her training at New London before proceeding back to New York for post-shakedown availability.

===Coast Guard service===
On 14 October 1943, Admiral King decided that, since the Q-ship effort had achieved nothing, &quot;Asterion&quot; should be assigned to other duties. On 16 December 1943, the venerable auxiliary was ordered to proceed to Boston, Massachusetts, where she reported to the Commandant, 1st Naval District, for transfer to the United States Coast Guard.

Turned over to that service and commissioned by it at Boston on 12 January 1944, &quot;Asterion&quot; (given the designation WAK-123) was converted for service as a weather ship. Ten days later, on 22 January 1944, her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. Based at Boston, &quot;Asterion&quot; served as a weather patrol ship on Atlantic stations 3 and 4.

===Scrapping===
She was decommissioned on 20 July 1944, because of &quot;age, condition of hull and machinery, and lack of speed.&quot; Turned over to the War Shipping Administration for disposal in April 1946, &quot;Asterion&quot; was sold to the Boston Metals Company on 10 September 1946, and was subsequently scrapped.

<text>USS &quot;Atik&quot; (AK-101) was a Q-ship of the United States Navy named for &quot;al-Atik&quot;, a double star in the constellation Perseus. Her twin sister ship was .

==History==
The steel-hulled, single-screw steamer Carolyn was laid down on 15 March 1912 at Newport News, Virginia, by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, for the A. H. Bull Steamship Lines; launched on 3 July 1912, sponsored by Ms. Carolyn Bull (for whom the ship was probably named), a granddaughter of the shipping firm&#x27;s owner, Archibald Hilton Bull (1847–1920), and delivered on 20 July 1912.

For the next 30 years, &quot;Carolyn&quot; carried freight and passengers between the West Indies and ports on the eastern seaboard of the U.S. During World War I, she received a main battery of one and one gun, and a Navy armed guard detachment served on the ship from 28 June 1917– 11 November 1918. During that time, too, the Navy gave her the identification Id. No. 1608, but did not take her over for naval service.

&quot;Carolyn&quot; pursued her prosaic calling under the house flag of the Bull Line during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. A dispatch dated 31 January 1941 expressed the Chief of Naval Operations&#x27; desire that &quot;Evelyn&quot; and &quot;Carolyn&quot; &quot;be given a preliminary conversion to AK (cargo ship) in the shortest possible time.&quot; A letter from the Chief of the Bureau of Ships elaborated on the &quot;shortest possible time,&quot; when it stated on 12 February that the conversion and outfitting of the vessels was desired &quot;by 1 March 1942.&quot; Acquired by the Navy from the Maritime Commission, &quot;Carolyn&quot; steamed to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where she was turned over to the Navy under a bareboat charter at 15:30 on 12 February 1942.

As could be expected, the process of converting two venerable tramp steamers into men-of-war was by no means complete, but over the next few weeks the two erstwhile &quot;tramps&quot; were given their main and secondary batteries as well as sound gear; nevertheless, they appeared to be mere cargo ships. &quot;Carolyn&quot; became &quot;Atik&quot;, and was given a cargo ship hull number, AK-101; &quot;Evelyn&quot; became &quot;Asterion&quot; (AK-100). They were to use their old identities when communicating with friendly vessels and stations; if enemy ships should challenge, reply should be made in accordance with International Procedure, using the identification SS &quot;Vill Franca&quot;, of Portuguese Registry, callsign CSBT.

&quot;Atik&quot; (AK-101) was commissioned at 16:45 on 5 March 1942, at the Portsmouth Navy Yard.

At the outset, all connected with the program apparently harbored the view that neither ship &quot;was expected to last longer than a month after commencement of [her] assigned duty.&quot; &quot;Atik&quot;″s holds were packed with pulpwood, a somewhat mercurial material. If dry, &quot;an explosive condition might well develop,&quot; and, if wet, &quot;rot, with resultant fire, might well take place.&quot; Despite these disadvantages, pulpwood was selected as the best obtainable material to assure &quot;floatability.&quot;

&quot;Atik&quot;″s mission was to lure some unsuspecting U-boat into making a torpedo attack. According to the projected scenario, the submarine, having deemed the tramp unworthy of the expenditure of more torpedoes, would surface to sink the crippled foe with gunfire.

The plan presupposed that supporting forces would come to the rescue whenever a Q-ship ran into difficulties. In March 1942, though, there was no such reserve available. The commanding officers of the two ships were told that they could expect little help if they got into trouble. Every available combatant ship and plane was employed in convoy and patrol duties.

Following fitting out and brief sea trials, she and &quot;Asterion&quot; got underway on 23 March 1942. Soon after leaving port, &quot;Atik&quot; and &quot;Asterion&quot; went their separate ways. On the night of 26–27 March, she was cruising about east of Norfolk, Virginia and &quot;Asterion&quot; was cruising some to the south of this area.

===Action===
At 19:45 Eastern War Time, UT-4 (note that some accounts use German Winter Time, UT+1), on the night of 26 March, the Duty Officer in the Joint Operations Control Room, Eastern Sea Frontier (ESF), was informed that an SOS had been picked up from an unidentified ship which had been torpedoed. No further information was available.

&quot;Atik&quot; had attracted the attention of , on her second war patrol off the eastern seaboard. The U-boat, on the surface, began stalking &quot;Atik&quot; at 17:00, and at 19:37 fired one torpedo from away which struck the ship on her port side, under the bridge. Fire broke out immediately, and the ship began to assume a slight list.

At 20:53, radio stations at Manasquan, New Jersey, and at Fire Island, New York, intercepted the distress message:
:SSS SOS Lat. 36-00 N, Long. 70-00 W, &quot;Carolyn&quot; burning forward, not bad.
Two minutes later, a second distress message further amplified:
:Torpedo attack, burning forward; require assistance.

As &quot;U-123&quot; proceeded around under her victim&#x27;s stern, her captain, &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Reinhard Hardegen, noted one boat being lowered on the starboard side and men abandoning ship.

Because such attacks were a regular occurrences at this time, and because all available surface craft were on patrol, the dispatch from &quot;Carolyn&quot; produced no immediate action. The Duty Officer in the Control Room had not been informed as to the secret nature of &quot;Carolyn&quot;, and consequently his only action was to forward the dispatch to Commander-in-Chief, United States Fleet (COMINCH).

&quot;Carolyn&quot; was not dead—yet. After &quot;U-123&quot; turned to starboard, &quot;Atik&quot; gathered steerage way, paralleling her course by turning to starboard as well, and dropped her concealment, commencing fire from her main and secondary batteries. The first shell dropped short of the U-boat, as she made off presenting a small target; the others were off in deflection. A veritable hail of .50-caliber machine gun fire, though, ricochetted around the U-boat&#x27;s decks as she put on speed to escape the trap into which Hardegen had fallen. One bullet mortally wounded a midshipman standing watch on &quot;U-123&quot;&#x27;s bridge.

Gradually, the U-boat pulled out of range behind the cover of a smoke screen emitted by her straining diesels, and her captain assessed the damage. As he later recorded, &quot;We had been incredibly lucky.&quot;

&quot;U-123&quot; submerged and again approached her opponent. At 21:29, the U-boat shot a torpedo into &quot;Atik&quot;″s machinery spaces. Satisfied that this blow would be fatal, &quot;U-123&quot; stood off and watched as &quot;Atik&quot; settled by the bow, her single screw now out of the water.

Once again, &quot;Atik&quot;″s crew could be seen embarking on her boats, as their ship clung stubbornly to the surface. &quot;U-123&quot; surfaced at 22:27, confident that &quot;Atik&quot; was no longer a threat, and continued to watch until 22:50, when a cataclysmic explosion blew her to pieces. Ten minutes later, &quot;U-123&quot; buried her only casualty, the midshipman killed by the Q-ship&#x27;s machine gun fire. &quot;Atik&quot;″s entire crew perished, either in the blast or during the severe gale that blew up soon after the ship disintegrated.

Several hours after receiving the report of the SOS, an officer in Cominch Operations room phoned the Duty Officer and asked if the Commander, Eastern Sea Frontier (CESF), or the Chief of Staff, had been notified. They had not. The Duty Officer was informed that they should be, immediately. Because CESF and his Chief of Staff were both in Norfolk on that particular night, the Duty Officer notified the Operations Officer at his home.

Early the next morning, an Army bomber was sent to search the area from which &quot;Carolyn&quot; had sent her distress message; the destroyer and the tug were sent to assist. The Army bomber returned without having sighted anything. The tug and the destroyer encountered such heavy weather that &quot;Sagamore&quot; was recalled; &quot;Noa&quot; searched the area until fuel shortage compelled her to return to New York on 30 March. Other flights were unsuccessful until 30 March, when two Army planes and one PBY-5A Catalina flying boat out of Norfolk reported that they had sighted wreckage roughly ten miles south of the original reported position.

&quot;Asterion&quot; had intercepted the distress messages from &quot;Atik&quot; and proceeded directly to the area. Lieutenant Commander Legwen deemed his orders &quot;sufficiently broad to proceed immediately to her assistance. However, &quot;Asterion&quot; encountered difficulties with her steering gear, and only continued the search for 24 hours before being forced to put into Hampton Roads for repairs.

The Norwegian freighter was sighted in the vicinity, southbound for St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. On her arrival there, she was boarded and interrogation revealed that her crew had sighted no wreckage and had picked up no survivors.

Twelve days later, CESF reported all known details to COMINCH on the &quot;suspected sinking of the SS &quot;Carolyn&quot;,&quot; and concluded: &quot;...it is believed that there is very little chance that any of her officers and crew will be recovered. It is therefore recommended that if no further information is received by 27 April, they be considered lost and that next of kin be notified.&quot;

On 9 April, Radio Berlin reported that a U-boat had sunk an adversary. The Associated Press distributed the announcement and it was printed in the &quot;New York Times&quot; the next day.

:The High Command said today that a Q-boat – a heavily armed ship disguised as an unarmed vessel – was among 13 vessels sunk off the American Atlantic coast and that it was sent to the bottom by a submarine only after a &quot;bitter battle.&quot; (In the last war, Q-ships accounted for many submarines which slipped up on them thinking they were easy prey. When the submarines came into range, false structures on the Q-boats were collapsed, revealing an array of guns.)

:The Q-boat, the communiqué said, was of 3,000 tons and was sunk by a torpedo after a battle &quot;fought partly on the surface with artillery and partly beneath the water with bombs and torpedoes.&quot;

As of 2014, no other ships in the United States Navy have been named &quot;Atik&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Irene Forsyte&quot; (IX-93) was a three masted schooner originally built as &quot;MacLean Clan&quot; which was briefly converted to a Q-ship, of the United States Navy.

==In commercial service==
The three-masted schooner &quot;MacLean Clan&quot; was built in 1920 by the MacLean Construction Company, Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia for H.W. Adams of Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. Built at the end of the era of three masted merchant schooners, she was one of two schooners built by MacLean construction in 1920, the other being the auxiliary tern schooner &quot;Cote Nord&quot;. &quot;Maclean Clan&quot; worked in the coastal trade into the 1930s. She had an auxiliary engine installed in 1926 and was sold and re-registered in Windsor, Nova Scotia in 1929. In the early 1930s she was purchased by Captain Thomas Antle. Renamed &quot;Irene Myrtle&quot;, the schooner barely survived the tough trade conditions of that time and was in poor condition by the end of the decade. Given a new lease on life by the increased shipping traffic provoked by the war, she served in the coal trade between New England and Nova Scotia into 1942. That summer, while the ship was loading coal at New London, Connecticut, Captain Antle died and the ship was eventually put up for sale.

==Acquired by the US Navy==
At this time, the U.S. Navy began looking for a smaller coastal vessel to serve as a Q-ship, complementing the larger decoy ships , , and . Purchased on 16 November 1942, for about US$12,000, the schooner was renamed &quot;Irene Forsyte&quot; and given hull designation symbol IX-93 on 7 December. She was delivered to the Thames Shipyard of New London, Connecticut, for conversion. Fitted with new engines, quick-firing armament, as well as concealed radar and sonar equipment, the auxiliary was commissioned 26 August 1943.

==Service history==
Based on the experience of Q-ships during World War I, it was hoped &quot;Irene Forsyte&quot;, with her relatively heavy armament concealed, could lure German submarines into close quarters on the surface and sink them with gunfire. Success in the venture would require a good disguise. After a volunteer crew sailed the schooner from New London on 29 September 1943, she changed her name and flag to that of a Portuguese Grand Banks fishing schooner. The crew also further concealed the guns and altered her rigging and profile. The disguised Q-ship then stood southeast in hopes of encountering enemy submarines.

Originally, the Navy planned to use the vessel off the &quot;Trinidad corner&quot; where U-boats had congregated and where several schooners had been attacked. However, by the time she was ready for sea, the situation had changed and she was given orders to sail on or about 26 September for Recife, Brazil, along the Maury Track.

In the early morning hours of 4 October 1943, a dispatch from &quot;Irene Forsyte&quot; reported that she was hove to at approximately 38°N, 66°W (near Bermuda). The schooner&#x27;s seams had opened during the course of a heavy storm and her pumps were just able to keep ahead of the flooding. The message further stated that the condition might become serious if the heavy weather continued; permission was requested to proceed to Bermuda for repairs. Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANT), ordered two tugs to proceed to the scene and render assistance. Later in the day, however, &quot;Irene Forsyte&quot; reported that no assistance was needed and that she was proceeding to Bermuda. The tugs were recalled. She anchored in Hamilton Harbour, Bermuda, and was reconditioned.

Immediately a Board of Investigation convened to determine why the vessel had been permitted to go to sea in such obviously unseaworthy condition. In commenting on the report of the Naval Inspector General, Commander in Chief, United States Fleet (Cominch) wrote:

:&quot;The conversion of USS &quot;Irene Forsyte&quot; is an instance of misguided conception and misdirected zeal, which, coupled with inefficiency resulting from lack of supervision by competent authority; has cost the government nearly half a million dollars in money and a serious waste of effort. In addition, much valuable material that can ultimately be used has been frozen for the better part of one year. The facts and circumstances responsible therefor are set forth in detail in the enclosures.&quot;

:&quot;I recognize that the actions of the officers were, in general, motivated by a desire to assist in the war effort. However, it appears to be a fact that some of the officers concerned took advantage of the broad authority that was granted in the interests of secrecy to obtain equipment that did not contribute to the military value of the vessel. Furthermore, the failure to ascertain, prior to or during conversion, that the vessel was unseaworthy is an indication of professional incompetence on the part of the officers concerned. The Commander, Eastern Sea Frontiers, and the Commandant, Third Naval District, after such further investigation as they may deem necessary, will take appropriate corrective and disciplinary action. Disposal of the vessel has been provided for in other correspondence.&quot;

:&quot;The practice of granting to Frontier Commanders and District Commandants uncontrolled authority to implement projects of this nature has been discontinued.&quot;

The schooner arrived New York 8 November 1943 and, after an inspection three days later, she was decommissioned 16 December. Transferred to the War Shipping Administration, she was used for a time on a loan basis by the Merchant Marine Cadet Corps as a training ship until returned to the Navy for disposal on 28 November 1944. Stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 22 December 1944, the schooner was transferred to the Maritime Commission and eventually sold at public auction 18 October 1945.

==Fate==
Purchased by a Cuban shipping firm, she was renamed &quot;Santa Clara&quot; and served another six years in the island trade. The aging schooner met her end off La Ceiba when, heavily laden, she ran into bad weather, took on water and sank on 21 December 1951.

<text>USS &quot;Big Horn&quot; (AO-45/WAO-124/IX-207) was a Q-ship of the United States Navy named for the Bighorn River of Wyoming and Montana.

==History==
&quot;Gulf Dawn&quot;, a single-screw oil tanker, was built in 1936 at Chester, Pennsylvania, by the Sun Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Corp. and operated by the Gulf Oil Corporation.

===Navy Service===
Acquired by the Navy on 31 March 1942, she was renamed &quot;Big Horn&quot; and given the hull designation symbol AO-45 on 3 April 1942. Her conversion began at the Bethlehem Shipyard in Brooklyn, New York. She was commissioned 15 April 1942, under the command of Commander James A. Gainard, USNR, formerly master of SS &quot;City of Flint&quot;, which had become the center of an international incident at the beginning of the war, and was later sunk by a U-boat.

====Atlantic Fleet====

Sailing to Boston on 23 April, &quot;Big Horn&quot; entered the Boston Navy Yard for conversion to a Q-ship. A disguised heavily armed merchantman, the decoy ship was intended to lure unsuspecting U-boats to the surface and sink them with gunfire. While at Boston, &quot;Big Horn&quot; completed her disguise as a fleet oiler and was given extra watertight integrity – in case she was torpedoed – by the installation of thousands of sealed empty drums in her cargo tanks. That work was completed on 22 July 1942.

After two days on the degaussing range and in calibrating compasses and radio direction finders, &quot;Big Horn&quot; proceeded to Casco Bay for training under Commander, Destroyers, Atlantic Fleet. This training period was followed by a shakedown cruise which was completed on 26 August 1942, at which date USS &quot;Big Horn&quot; put in again at the Navy Yard, Boston, for further alterations and repairs until 12 September.

As U-boats had been attacking bauxite ore cargo ships in the West Indies, the Q-ship sailed south to help defend the convoy routes there on 27 September.

1942

The first cruise of USS &quot;Big Horn&quot; began on 27 September 1942, when the ship proceeded from New York with a convoy bound for Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, taking a position which permitted the vessel to act as a straggler. The trip was made without incident, and thereafter &quot;Big Horn&quot; was semi-attached to NOB [Naval Operating Base] Trinidad,
with orders to operate from that base over the bauxite route to and from
ports where that commodity was loaded. Many ships in this area had been sunk in recent weeks. Ships proceeding from Trinidad were convoyed to a designated point from which they fanned out to take various routes to their ultimate destination. &quot;Big Horn&quot; was directed to proceed to that point and drop down on independent routes to and from bauxite ports.

After joining south-bound convoy GAT-11 at Guantánamo Bay, the ship – using her old call sign of &quot;Gulf Dawn&quot; – purposefully lagged behind the convoy en route to Trinidad. No U-boats were tempted to attack, however, and the ship moored in Port of Spain on 9 October.

On 16 October 1942, &quot;Big Horn&quot; sailed in convoy T-19 from Trinidad to the point of separation. That same afternoon, three U-boats attacked the convoy, and at 15:20 in , the British steamer SS &quot;Castle Harbour&quot; was hit on the starboard side by a torpedo and sank in less than two minutes. At almost the same time the United States steamer , coal-laden, was struck forward on the starboard side. Later she limped into Trinidad. Soon afterwards, lookouts on &quot;Big Horn&quot; sighted a U-boat moving at periscope depth on the port beam, but in such a position that no action could be taken without damaging the United States troopship &quot;Mexico&quot; or the Egyptian ship &quot;Raz El Farog&quot;. At 16:27, lookouts on &quot;Big Horn&quot; again sighted a periscope and conning tower, on the port side, and her four-inch (100 mm) gun was trained in that direction just as a submarine chaser crossed through the line of fire and dropped five depth charges. Thereafter, the cruise in these waters was continued without incident for several days and &quot;Big Horn&quot; returned to NOB Trinidad about 29 October.

A second cruise in company with a convoy from Trinidad was begun by &quot;Big Horn&quot; on 1 November 1942, to a point nearly due north of Paramaribo, where the vessel left the convoy and proceeded on varying courses without incident until return to Trinidad on 8 November 1942.

On 10 November 1942, USS &quot;Big Horn&quot; sailed in convoy TAG-20, with the gunboat USS &quot;Erie&quot; (PG-50), two PC-boats (submarine chasers), and a PG-boat (patrol gunboat) acting as escorts. Because of submarine warnings, the convoy changed course so that the approach to Curaçao was made from the south and west. Because of engine difficulties, USS &quot;Big Horn&quot; dropped out of the convoy at 15:30 on 12 November 1942, in company with a Venezuelan tanker, and arrived at a point about off Willemstad harbor, where the Curaçao-Aruba subsidiary convoys were joining the main convoy. At 17:02, a great volume of smoke was sighted as it rose from &quot;Erie&quot;&#x27;s stern, about on the starboard bow of &quot;Big Horn&quot;, at .

&quot;Erie&quot; had been torpedoed on the starboard side aft. &quot;Big Horn&quot; called General Quarters, increased speed to and proceeded for the scene of action, but repeated orders from Willemstad forced &quot;Big Horn&quot; to alter course at 17:25 and proceed to Willemstad. &quot;Erie&quot; swung into the wind; efforts to subdue the fire were unsuccessful. The gunboat was finally beached, officers and crew abandoning ship.

On 21 November 1942, USS &quot;Big Horn&quot; proceeded from Curaçao with a convoy bound for New York, The convoy proceeded on a course for Guantánamo with a Dutch gunboat and four SC-boats as escorts. Other vessels joined convoy at Guantánamo until on
leaving that meeting point there were 45 ships and five escorts in company. The remainder of the cruise to New York via Caicos Passage was uneventful, and &quot;Big Horn&quot; anchored in The Narrows in New York Harbor at 20:40 on 1 December 1942. During the next few weeks,
&quot;Big Horn&quot; entered the Todd Shipyard at Hoboken, New Jersey, for what proved to be nine weeks of repair work and alterations.
The latter included the installation of a mousetrap, a Hedgehog depth charge projector, and a DF (direction finding) radio receiver.

1943

She departed New York on 17 February 1943, and arrived at New London, Connecticut, the following day. On 19 February 1942, Lieutenant Commander
Farley assumed command of a newly organized Task Group consisting of &quot;Big Horn&quot; and three PC-boats: &quot;PC-560&quot;, &quot;PC-617&quot;, and &quot;PC-618&quot;. Antisubmarine measures had been so successful that no vessels had been sunk in coastal waters since July 1942. This Task Group was designed to hunt U-boats in the central Atlantic; the three PC-boats would escort &quot;Big Horn&quot;, which would act as bait and support in antisubmarine combat, as well as fuel and supply ship for the escorts.

During the period from 2 to 14 March, this Task Group conducted training exercises in Long Island Sound with the submarine &quot;Mingo&quot; (SS-261) supplied for the purpose by ComSubLant, During the next two weeks the Task Group made a shakedown cruise.

After a short trip to New York between 20 and 28 March, the Task Group continued antisubmarine training against &quot;Muskallunge&quot; (SS-262) until 9 April. &quot;Big Horn&quot; and the two subchasers then sailed south in Task Group 21.8 (TG 21.8) to New York, arriving there on 9 April.

Convoy UGS-7A sailed on the morning of 14 April 1943, and the special Task Group joined up off New York and continued in company until 08:00 on 21 April, when the Group left the convoy and dropped astern , proceeding as straggler-with-escorts, although the escorts remained far enough astern so that they would not be visible to an enemy submarine sighting &quot;Big Horn&quot;. The cruise was uneventful during the next two weeks.

After several changes of course, &quot;Big Horn&quot; was at (about south of the Azores) at noon of 3 May 1943. Early that morning, &quot;Big Horn&quot; had made radar contact with a suspected U-boat at a range of about and sent the two PCs to investigate. At 11:04, &quot;PC-618&quot; reported a submarine on the surface, distant about . At 12:35, &quot;Big Horn&quot; got a sound contact and delivered a Hedgehog attack just after sighting a periscope on the starboard bow at 12:42, followed by a heavy swirl as the U-boat dove. At 13:33 a second attack was delivered and the contact was lost. At 15:40 the contact was regained at and at 15:54, speed five knots (9 km/h), &quot;Big Horn&quot; delivered a third attack. About five of the Hedgehog projectiles (which detonate only on contact) exploded about 12 seconds after they entered the water, and &quot;Big Horn&quot; continued in to drop depth charges. Considerable light oil came to the surface and continued to spread for two hours. At 01:03 on 4 May an oil patch was visible over an area of 200 to . By daylight that morning, all traces of the oil slick were gone. As none of the vessels in the Group were able to establish contact during the next 44 hours, it was presumed that one submarine had been destroyed; that the other U-boat which had been sighted by the &quot;PC-618&quot; had moved out of the area. A postwar review of German U-boat losses, however, indicated that no submarines were sunk on that date in this area.

Continuing on a homeward course, the commanding officer of &quot;Big Horn&quot; attempted to use the COMINCH (Commander in Chief, United States Fleet) daily submarine estimates as guides for fruitful changes of course, but after several attempts had failed to produce results, the Task Group Commander recorded in his log, on 13 May 1943:

This makes three submarines we have attempted to intercept on our return trip, all of which we theoretically should have met. This experience again accents the hopelessness of trying to find submarines. The proper procedure, as originally planned, is to remain in the vicinity of convoys, to which the submarines will come. On the next trip, it is planned to stay within about , or less, of the convoy

After returning to New York on 17 May, the ship underwent another overhaul between 19 May and 16 July.

On her final cruise as a Q-ship, &quot;Big Horn&quot; again she served as the flagship of a small Task Group which included only two other vessels: &quot;PC-618&quot; and &quot;PC-617&quot;. Commander L. C. Farley had relieved Captain Gainard as commanding officer of &quot;Big Horn&quot; on 24 June because of the illness of the latter. The Task Group departed New York on 20 July 1943, and proceeded to Norfolk, where convoy UGS-13 made up and sailed on the morning of 27 July. On 29 July, &quot;Big Horn&quot; straggled from the convoy and streamed her Mark 29 gear. For the next few days she trailed the convoy, distant about . On 4 August, U-boats were reported by COMINCH to be operating in the vicinity of 38°N, 38°W, and the Task Group changed course to intercept. On 6 August, a submarine was sighted in and attacked by &quot;PC-618&quot; with mousetraps which failed to explode. Thereafter the contact was not regained. An expanding box search was carried out during the next few days without results, then the group moved northward of the Azores. Planes from the escort aircraft carrier (CVE-11) were sighted several times during this period and it later transpired that some of these planes had made definite kills of U-boats during that period. &quot;Big Horn&quot; was not so fortunate, in spite of frequent changes of course to intercept submarines reported by COMINCH. The cruise continued in the general area and as far south as the latitude of Dakar, during the last weeks of August and throughout September. During the last week of September, a new search area was tried far to the north of the Azores, but again without success; then the homeward leg of the cruise was executed without event. &quot;Big Horn&quot; and her escorts stood up Ambrose Channel on 7 October 1943.

On 14 October, COMINCH directed that &quot;Big Horn&quot; should be retained in active service but that no alterations or extensive repairs should be made without specific authorization of COMINCH.

After training exercises in the New London area with a friendly sub from 29 October through 10 November, &quot;Big Horn&quot; made one more uneventful cruise in company with &quot;PC-617&quot; and &quot;PC-618&quot;. On 11 November, the Task Group returned to New York to refuel and provision; on 15 November, the Task Group departed in company and proceeded on an eastward course until they had reached the hunting ground north of the Azores on 27 November. Searches were unsuccessful.

&quot;Big Horn&quot; then steamed back to New London on 30 November, whence she conducted training in Long Island Sound, before departing on a third &quot;decoy&quot; cruise on 19 December. Although she operated near a suspected U-boat concentration in the waters off Bermuda, the Q-ship and her two subchasers had no contacts and returned to New York empty-handed on 30 December.

In summarizing this cruise, the commanding officer of &quot;Big Horn&quot; wrote:

It may be noted that during the period from 27 November to 1 December, this Task Group was in the midst of a group of from 10 to 15 U-boats. Nine contacts, sightings or attacks on U-boats took place in our immediate vicinity, so that it is most unlikely that we were not seen by some U-boats. Evidently the U-boats are wary of attacking an independent tanker. If the Q-ship program has contributed to this wariness, as is suggested in several prisoner-of-war statements, many independent merchant ships may thereby have escaped attack, and the Q-ship program has thus been of value.

===Coast Guard, 1944===

COMINCH did not agree, and, considering similarly meager results and even losses by other Q-ships, cancelled the entire Q-ship program. &quot;Big Horn&quot; was ordered to Boston, and arriving there on 17 January 1944, was transferred to the United States Coast Guard as USCGC &quot;Big Horn&quot; (WAO-124) to join &quot;Asterion&quot; (AK-100) on weather-patrol duty in the North Atlantic, under the supervision of the United States Coast Guard and manned by Coast Guard officers and crew. The ship was assigned to the 1st Naval District and operated out of Boston. Her main duty was to conduct 25-day patrols on the Coast Guard&#x27;s mid-ocean weather stations and report on surface and aerial weather conditions. These reports were used to determine air-ferry routes across the Atlantic and to reroute shipping around storm concentrations. Because her antisubmarine equipment still remained intact, she could take offensive action if such opportunities presented themselves. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 22 January 1944.

===Pacific Fleet, 1945===

Although she kept her Coast Guard crew, &quot;Big Horn&quot; was returned to Navy control on 1 February 1945 and redesignated IX-207 two days later. Over the next five weeks, the ship was converted into an oil shuttle and storage vessel before departing for the Pacific on 11 March. After loading 84,000 barrels (13,400 m³) of oil at Aruba, Netherlands West Indies, on the 18th, she passed through the Panama Canal on 21 March and reported to
the Service Force, Pacific Fleet, that same day.

Steaming west, &quot;Big Horn&quot; stopped at Pearl Harbor in early April before sailing on to the Marshall Islands, where she anchored at Ulithi on 1 May. Assigned to Service Squadron 10 (ServRon 10), the shuttle tanker carried oil to Kossol Roads and Peleliu in the Western Carolines in early May before moving on to Tacloban in the Philippines later in the month. Returning to Ulithi on 3 June, she loaded more oil and delivered it to Leyte on the 9th. Over the next eight weeks, &quot;Big Horn&quot; carried out three more of these shuttle missions from Ulithi to Leyte. The tanker sailed to Okinawa on 11 August and she was at that island on 15 August 1945, when her crew heard the news of the Japanese surrender.

Departing Okinawa on 29 September, &quot;Big Horn&quot; steamed to Japan, where she was assigned duty as a station tanker at Nagoya on 3 October. She remained there through January 1946. After transferring her cargo of oil to &quot;Beagle&quot; (IX-112), the shuttle tanker got underway for home on 25 February. After a refueling stop at Pearl Harbor, she passed through the Panama Canal in early April and moored at Mobile, Alabama, on 15 April.

&quot;Big Horn&quot; then proceeded to New Orleans, Louisiana. She was decommissioned on 6 May 1946, and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 3 July 1946. Berthed at Orange, Texas, the ship was subsequently delivered to the Maritime Commission for disposal on 22 November 1946.

<text>Duran Duran () are an English pop rock band formed in Birmingham in 1978 by singer Stephen Duffy, keyboardist Nick Rhodes and guitarist/bassist John Taylor. After several early changes, the band&#x27;s line-up settled in May 1980 as Rhodes, Taylor, singer Simon Le Bon, guitarist Andy Taylor and drummer Roger Taylor. 

Emerging as members of the New Romantic scene, Duran Duran were innovators of the music video and a leading band in the MTV-driven Second British Invasion of the US in the 1980s. By 1984, the band had achieved levels of fame similar to Beatlemania. The band&#x27;s first major hit was &quot;Girls on Film&quot; (1981), from their self-titled debut album, the popularity of which was enhanced by a controversial music video. The band&#x27;s breakthrough second album was &quot;Rio&quot; (1982), a worldwide hit. The songs &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; and &quot;Rio&quot; featured cinematic music videos directed by Australian film maker Russell Mulcahy and became two of their biggest hits. Their third album, &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot;, became their only UK number one album and featured the US and UK number one single &quot;The Reflex&quot;. In 1985, the band topped the US charts with the single &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; from the soundtrack of the James Bond film of the same title.

Andy Taylor and Roger Taylor both left the band before the recording of their fourth album, &quot;Notorious&quot; (1986), which yielded the top ten title track. Le Bon, Rhodes and John Taylor initially continued as a core trio, before adding drummer Sterling Campbell and former Frank Zappa and Missing Persons guitarist Warren Cuccurullo as full-time members in 1989, though Campbell departed in 1991. The band spent the late 1980s and early 1990s releasing albums and singles to only moderate success. Their comeback album, 1993&#x27;s &quot;Duran Duran&quot; (commonly called &quot;The Wedding Album&quot;), featured two top ten worldwide hits &quot;Ordinary World&quot; and &quot;Come Undone&quot;. John Taylor left the band in 1997, though four years later, in 2001, a full reunion of the classic 1980–1985 line-up of Le Bon, Rhodes and all three Taylors took place, which led to a number of highly successful concert tours and the 2004 album &quot;Astronaut&quot;, which reached number three in the UK and top 40 in numerous other countries. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;(Reach Up for The) Sunrise&quot; was an international dance hit, and reached number five in the UK. Andy Taylor left again in 2006, and the band have released five additional albums, with the most recent being &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; in 2023.

According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, Duran Duran have sold over 100 million records. They achieved 30 top 40 singles in the UK Singles Chart (14 of them top 10) and 21 top 40 singles in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The band have won numerous awards throughout their career: two Brit Awards including the 2004 award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, two Grammy Awards, an MTV Video Music Award for Lifetime Achievement and a Video Visionary Award from the MTV Europe Music Awards. They were also awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The band were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 2022.

==History==

===1978–1980: Formation and early years===

John Taylor and Nick Rhodes formed Duran Duran in 1978 in Birmingham, England, with Taylor&#x27;s art school friend Stephen Duffy, naming their band after &quot;Dr. Durand Durand&quot;, Milo O&#x27;Shea&#x27;s character from the science fiction film &quot;Barbarella&quot; (1968), the day after the film was broadcast on BBC on 20 October 1978. The three of them (Taylor on guitar and vocals, Rhodes on synthesizer and tapes, Duffy on vocals and bass) played their first gig on 5 April 1979 at the Birmingham Polytechnic. Soon after, they were joined by Simon Colley on clarinet and bass. John (then going by his first name Nigel) was the guitarist at this point. After a few gigs, including a performance at Barbarella&#x27;s in Birmingham opening for the band Fashion, Duffy and Colley left the band in June 1979.

Taylor and Rhodes then recruited lead vocalist Andy Wickett (formerly frontman of &quot;TV Eye&quot;) and decided that they needed a live drummer. They hired Roger Taylor, a former member of various local bands (most recently &quot;The Scent Organs&quot; who also played at Barbarella&#x27;s), while John Taylor switched to bass guitar. In September 1979, this incarnation of the band recorded a four-track demo including an early version of &quot;Girls on Film&quot; co-written by Andy Wickett. Soon afterwards Alan Curtis was recruited as lead guitarist. After a few gigs with this line-up Wickett left the band in late 1979.

Wickett was replaced by Roger Taylor&#x27;s friend and former singer of &quot;The Scent Organs&quot; Jeff Thomas. In early 1980, they became the resident band at the city&#x27;s Rum Runner nightclub. They were doing jobs at the club and began rehearsing and regularly playing at the venue. Curtis was unhappy with the Rum Runner club scene and left the band to form Dif Juz with his brother. Thomas was fired shortly after following disagreements and repeated arguments. The three remaining members started to look for a new lead vocalist and guitarist. The owners of the club, brothers Paul and Michael Berrow, became the band&#x27;s management, paying them to work as doormen, disc jockeys (DJs) and barmen when they were not rehearsing, and also formed the Tritec Music company.

In April 1980, guitarist Andy Taylor came from Newcastle upon Tyne to audition after responding to an advertisement in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. Andy already had a lot of experience from playing with cover bands for years and although he came from a totally different rock music background his versatile playing style was seen as a perfect complement to the band. In May 1980, London vocalist and drama student Simon Le Bon was recommended to the band by an ex-girlfriend who worked at the Rum Runner. The band were immediately impressed by Le Bon and soon completed their first composition with the new line-up, &quot;Sound of Thunder&quot;, featuring lyrics by Le Bon. Duran Duran&#x27;s first performance with the lineup of Le Bon, Rhodes and the three Taylors was on 16 July 1980 at the Rum Runner.

Duran Duran spent the next months writing, developing and demoing their songs and performed in clubs around Birmingham and London. In September 1980 they had written all of what would become their debut album. Touring as an opening act for Hazel O&#x27;Connor, the band attracted critical attention, resulting in a bidding war between the record companies EMI and Phonogram. &quot;A certain patriotism&quot; toward the label of the Beatles led them to sign with EMI in December. A week later, the first article about Duran Duran in a national magazine appeared in &quot;Sounds&quot;. The members of Duran Duran had noticed that Betty Page (pen name for Beverley Glick) was writing about a new movement called New Romantic that would fit the band perfectly and invited her to meet them at the Rum Runner.

Shortly after signing the recording contract with EMI, Duran Duran went to London to record their debut album with producer Colin Thurston, and initial plans for an independent release of the songs &quot;Planet Earth&quot; and &quot;Is There Anyone Out There?&quot; on the Tritec Music label were scrapped.

===1981–1982: Self-titled debut, &quot;Rio&quot; and Second British Invasion===
The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Duran Duran&quot;, was released on the EMI label in June 1981. The first single, &quot;Planet Earth&quot;, had reached the United Kingdom&#x27;s top 20 at number 12 in February. A follow-up, &quot;Careless Memories&quot;, released in April, stalled at number 37. The third single, &quot;Girls on Film&quot;, was released in July and went to number 5 in the UK. The video, featuring topless women mud wrestling, pillow fighting and stylised depictions of other sexual fetishes, was made with directing duo Godley &amp; Creme in August. The video was filmed just two weeks after MTV was launched in the United States. The band expected the &quot;Girls on Film&quot; video to be played in the newer nightclubs that had video screens or on pay TV channels like the Playboy Channel. Kevin Godley explained the thinking behind it:

The video was heavily edited for MTV. The album peaked in the UK top twenty at number three. Later in 1981 the band embarked on their first United States club tour followed by more dates in Germany and the UK. This second tour of Britain coincided with a wave of riots sparked by unemployment and racial tension, including those of Moss Side and Toxteth. The band played Birmingham the day after the Handsworth riots. The band also began writing and demoing songs for a new album. In November 1981, they released a new single, the disco-influenced &quot;My Own Way&quot;, that reached number 14 in the UK, followed in early 1982 by the recording of their second album at AIR Studios in London.

In May 1982, Duran Duran released their second album, &quot;Rio&quot;, which entered the UK Albums Chart at number four and peaked at number two the following week. The band scored three UK top 10 hits on the singles chart from the album with &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; at number five in June, &quot;Save a Prayer&quot; at number two in September and the title song &quot;Rio&quot; at number nine in December, while the earlier top 20 hit &quot;My Own Way&quot; was included in a re-recorded version on the album.

With the album Duran Duran also began to achieve worldwide recognition. A headlining tour of Australia, Japan and the US was followed by a stint supporting Blondie during that band&#x27;s final American tour. Diana, Princess of Wales declared Duran Duran her favourite band, and the band were dubbed &quot;the Fab Five&quot; by the British press, comparing them to the Beatles whose nickname was the Fab Four.

At first, the &quot;Rio&quot; album did not do well in the United States. EMI in the UK had promoted Duran Duran as a New Romantic band, but the New Romantic movement was barely known in the US, and EMI&#x27;s American subsidiary Capitol Records was at a loss about how to sell them. After &quot;Carnival&quot; (an EP of &quot;Rio&quot; dance remixes) became popular with DJs in the fall, the band arranged to have most of the album remixed by David Kershenbaum. In June 1982, Duran Duran appeared for the first time on American television, performing &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; and &quot;Rio&quot; on &quot;Dancin&#x27; on Air&quot;, the forerunner to the national hit show &quot;Dance Party USA&quot;.

Now promoted as a dance album, &quot;Rio&quot; was re-released in the US in November and began to climb the American charts six months after its European success. MTV placed &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; and several other Duran Duran videos into heavy rotation, pushing the single and album into the US top twenty in early 1983. The ballad &quot;Save a Prayer&quot; also did well. &quot;The band was a natural for music television,&quot; noted &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. &quot;They may be the first rock group to ride in on a video wave.&quot; The album ultimately peaked at number six in the US and remained on the charts there for 129 weeks. In 2003, &quot;Rio&quot; was listed at number 65 in the &quot;NME&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Albums of All Time.

Duran Duran were among the earliest bands to work on their own remixes. Before the days of digital synthesizer and easy audio sampling, they created multi-layered arrangements of their singles, sometimes recording entirely different extended performances of the songs in the studio. These &quot;night versions&quot; were generally available only on vinyl as b-sides to 45 rpm singles or on 12-inch club singles until the release of the compilation &quot;Night Versions: The Essential Duran Duran&quot; in 1998.

===1983–1985: The &quot;Fab Five&quot;, Side projects and Live Aid===

The band began 1983 at the Palladium in New York playing the MTV New Year&#x27;s Eve Rock n&#x27; Roll Ball with &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; still climbing the charts in the US, and the American reissue of the &quot;Rio&quot; single to follow in March. To satisfy America&#x27;s appetite for their music, the band re-released their eponymous first album in the US in the middle of the year with the addition of the new single &quot;Is There Something I Should Know?&quot;. Upon its release, this song entered the chart at number one in the UK (a rarity then and their first chart-topper in their home country) and reached number five on the American charts. During the promotion of this album, Rhodes and Le Bon were MTV guest VJs for a show, during which artist and admirer Andy Warhol dropped by to greet them. &quot;Our first gigs in the United States were crazy and culty&quot;, Rhodes said later, &quot;But when we came back after &#x27;Hungry&#x27; was a hit, it was mayhem. It was Beatlemania. We were doing a signing of the &#x27;Girls on Film&#x27; video at a store in Times Square. We couldn&#x27;t get out of the store. The cops sealed off the streets.&quot; Also in 1983, Rhodes produced the UK number one and US number five hit &quot;Too Shy&quot; for English band Kajagoogoo and Andy Taylor became the first member of Duran Duran to get married.

The band spent the next year as tax exiles, writing songs at a château in France where &quot;The Tube&quot; with Jools Holland filmed a documentary with the band in May 1983 before they flew to Montserrat and then Sydney to record and mix their third album. During the summer, they returned to the UK to perform two concerts, the first on 20 July in front of the Prince and Princess of Wales at the Dominion Theatre, and the second, a charity concert at Aston Villa&#x27;s home ground. The band were under pressure to follow up the success of &quot;Rio&quot;, and the recording process took over six months as different band members went through bouts of perfectionism and insecurity. A newly decadent lifestyle and substance abuse issues for some members added complications. In the documentary film &quot;Extraordinary World&quot;, filmed a decade later, Rhodes described the effect on their sound as &quot;barely controlled hysteria, scratching beneath the surface&quot;.

The new album, &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot; (1983), included the late 1983 hit &quot;Union of the Snake&quot; (with the soprano saxophone solo by Andy Hamilton). With &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot;, &quot;Rio&quot;, &quot;Save a Prayer&quot; and &quot;Is There Something I Should Know?&quot;, Duran Duran now had five US Top Twenty hits from three different albums in a single year. The band made music headlines by deciding to release the &quot;Union of the Snake&quot; video to MTV a full week before the single was released to radio. They followed up with &quot;New Moon on Monday&quot;, which reached number nine in the UK. Their next single &quot;The Reflex&quot;, taken from &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot; and given a significant remix overhaul by Nile Rodgers of Chic fame, became their first number one hit in the United States. &quot;The Reflex&quot; was also their second and final UK number one and was successful in numerous other countries around the world.

The band embarked on a global tour that continued throughout the first four months of 1984 including their first major stadium dates in America. A film crew led by director Russell Mulcahy followed the band closely, leading to the documentary film &quot;Sing Blue Silver&quot; and the accompanying concert film &quot;Arena&quot;. The live album &quot;Arena&quot; was also recorded during the tour and was released with the new single &quot;The Wild Boys&quot;, which went to number two on both sides of the Atlantic. In February 1984, the band appeared on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine and won two Grammy Awards in the brand-new Long Form and Short Form music video categories. Meanwhile, &quot;Save a Prayer&quot; gained momentum in North America, and a special US remix of the song became a single in January 1985. It peaked at number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in March. A live version of the song was used for the single&#x27;s B-side, taken from the concert video footage for &quot;Arena&quot; / &quot;As the Lights Go Down&quot;.

During this period, all of the band members became heartthrobs for many of their young teenage fans. After the tour, Roger Taylor was married in Naples, Italy, and Rhodes wed in London, wearing a pink velvet tuxedo and top hat. At the end of 1984, the group featured on the Band Aid benefit single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; along with other popular British and Irish musical acts. Le Bon sang fourth on the song, after Paul Young, Boy George and George Michael sing their lines.

Even with Duran Duran on hold, band members were soon anxious to record new music, leading to a supposedly temporary split into two side projects. John Taylor and Andy Taylor wanted to break away from the Duran Duran sound and pursue hard rock material; they collaborated with lead vocalist Robert Palmer and Chic&#x27;s drummer Tony Thompson to form the rock/funk supergroup the Power Station, releasing two top 10 singles. Le Bon and Rhodes wanted to further explore Duran Duran&#x27;s atmospheric aspect and formed Arcadia, releasing one album (&quot;So Red the Rose&quot;) and an accompanying single (&quot;Election Day&quot;). Contributors to that album included guitarist Masami Tsuchiya, bassist Mark Egan, percussionist David Van Tieghem, drummer Steve Jordan, Sting, Herbie Hancock and David Gilmour of Pink Floyd. Roger Taylor was a drummer for Arcadia as well as contributing percussion to the Power Station album. According to Rhodes, the two side projects &quot;were commercial suicide... But we&#x27;ve always been good at that.&quot; The band regrouped to contribute &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; to the 1985 James Bond film of the same name. This single was the first Bond theme to go to number one on the US charts, and was at the time the joint highest-placed Bond theme on the UK chart where it reached number two. It was the last single the band recorded as the original five-piece for close to twenty years.

As a follow-up to the Christmas 1984 Band Aid single, Duran Duran performed in front of 90,000 people (and an estimated 1.5 billion TV viewers) at the Live Aid charity concert at John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 13 July 1985 while their Bond song held the top spot on the American charts. It was not intended to be a farewell performance—the band planned only to take a break after four years of non-stop touring and public appearances—but the original five did not play live together again until July 2003. During their Live Aid set, Le Bon inadvertently hit an off-key falsetto note in the chorus of &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, an error that was trumpeted by numerous media outlets as &quot;The Bum Note Heard Round the World&quot; (in contrast to Freddie Mercury&#x27;s &quot;Note Heard Round the World&quot; at the Wembley Stadium Live Aid show). Le Bon later described the moment as the most embarrassing of his career.

===1986–1989: Le Bon, Rhodes and John Taylor trio===

After releasing three studio albums and one live album in five years, each accompanied by heavy media promotion and lengthy concert tours, the band lost two of its core members to fatigue and tension in 1986. After Live Aid and Arcadia, Roger Taylor left the band and retired to the English countryside, suffering from exhaustion.

Andy Taylor led the remaining members to believe he would return to work on a new Duran Duran album, even as he was signing a solo recording contract in Los Angeles with MCA Records, eventually releasing a solo album in 1986 called &quot;Thunder&quot;. The band resorted to legal measures to get him into the studio but after numerous delays they let him go at last. He played on only a few songs on the next album, including &quot;A Matter of Feeling&quot;, whilst the disagreements were being settled.

Without a guitarist or a drummer, Le Bon, Rhodes and John Taylor had producer (and former Chic guitarist) Nile Rodgers play a few tracks on guitar, and hired Steve Ferrone to play drums while they searched for replacements. In September 1986, Warren Cuccurullo (formerly of Missing Persons and Frank Zappa&#x27;s band) was hired as a session guitarist. With Le Bon, Rhodes and John Taylor, he recorded the rest of the &quot;Notorious&quot; album, which was released in October 1986. The black-and-white documentary film &quot;Three to Get Ready&quot; chronicled the recording of the album, legal tensions, and preparations for the tour.

Although the song &quot;Notorious&quot; was a US and UK top ten hit, the album was a relative failure globally, reaching number 16 in the UK and spending one week in the top 50 album chart. The band found they had lost much of the momentum and hysteria they had left behind in 1985. In the three years between the release of &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot; and &quot;Notorious&quot;, many of their teenage fans had grown up and the music was funkier, more mature, and less &quot;pop&quot;, given the added experience of their work on Arcadia and Power Station and with other musicians. &quot;Skin Trade&quot; and &quot;Meet El Presidente&quot;, the two subsequent singles, made the charts but fared poorly compared to the band&#x27;s earlier successes. Finally in late 1987, Sterling Campbell was hired as a session drummer.

Subsequently, Duran Duran struggled to escape the teen idol image and gain respect among critics with more complex music. The new serious image was not accepted at first and their popularity began to wane. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said, &quot;In their search for musical maturity, the surviving Durans have lost a good deal of their identity.&quot; In contrast the &quot;New York Times&quot; said, &quot;Duran Duran&#x27;s newfound disillusionment may mark a step toward maturity...they managed to catch a trend on the upswing, perhaps &quot;Notorious&quot; suggests that for late 1980s grit and pessimism is coming into style.&quot; Another factor was the band&#x27;s dismissal of early managers, the Berrow brothers. There was no announcement of the reasons for the decision, but disagreements over money, and the brothers&#x27; involvement in Le Bon&#x27;s yachting adventures (they were co-owners of &quot;Drum&quot;) were thought to have played a part. Whatever the reason, Duran Duran switched managers frequently and undertook periods of self-management in the later stages of their career. In addition, EMI fired its president and went through a major corporate restructuring that summer and seemed to have lost interest in promoting the band. According to Rhodes the band needed to break up in order to come back together stronger.

The next album &quot;Big Thing&quot; (1988) yielded the singles &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want Your Love&quot; (number four in the US), and &quot;All She Wants Is&quot; (the last top ten hit in the UK until 1993). The record was experimental, mixing influences from house music and raves with Duran&#x27;s atmospheric synth-pop and the creative guitar work of Cuccurullo (now a full band member), as well as more mature lyrics.

===1989–1991: Five again, &quot;Decade&quot; and &quot;Liberty&quot;===

By the end of 1989 and at the start of the 1990s, the popularity of synth-pop was fading and losing fans to other momentum-gaining music genres at the time, such as hip hop, techno and alternative rock. After touring for the album finished, the band regained a five-man membership as Cuccurullo and Campbell were made full members of Duran Duran.

The compilation album &quot;Decade&quot; was released late in 1989, along with the megamix single &quot;Burning the Ground&quot;, which consisted of woven snippets of the band&#x27;s hits from the previous ten years, created and produced with John Jones, who began working with the band after the release of &quot;Big Thing&quot;. The single came and went with little fanfare, but the album became another major seller for the band. The 1990 release &quot;Liberty&quot; (a retreat from the experimentation of &quot;Big Thing&quot;) failed to capitalise on any regained momentum. The album entered the UK album chart in the top ten, but faded away quickly. The singles &quot;Violence of Summer (Love&#x27;s Taking Over)&quot; and &quot;Serious&quot; were only mildly successful. For the first time, Duran Duran did not tour in support of an album, performing on only a handful of club dates and TV shows. Campbell left the band early in 1991, going on to work with Soul Asylum and David Bowie. The quartet of Le Bon, Rhodes, John Taylor and Cuccurullo would remain intact for six more years.

===1992–1996: Quartet line-up and a brief comeback===
In 1993, the band released a second self-titled album: this &quot;Duran Duran&quot; album is known as &quot;The Wedding Album&quot; (for Nick Egan&#x27;s cover art featuring the wedding photos of the band members&#x27; parents) to distinguish it from the 1981 release, and was produced and recorded with John Jones. The release of this first &quot;comeback&quot; album was delayed, with then manager at Left Bank, Tommy Manzi, later telling HitQuarters that this was due to industry resistance to the revival of the band, who he said would rather focus on &quot;the next hip band&quot;. Listener demand for leaked single &quot;Ordinary World&quot; forced it onto radio playlists months earlier than planned; it reached number three on the US chart and number six in the UK and won a prestigious Ivor Novello Award for song writing.

&quot;Come Undone&quot;, primarily written by Cuccurullo, with lyrics by Le Bon, made number seven in the US and number 13 in the UK. Both the band and the record label seemed to be caught by surprise by the album&#x27;s critical and commercial success (number four in the UK, number seven in the US). John Taylor had been considering leaving the band but changed his mind. The band&#x27;s largest tour ever, which included stops in the Middle East, the then recently de-embargoed South Africa, and South America, was halted after seven months when Le Bon suffered from strained vocal cords. After six weeks&#x27; recuperation, the band performed intermittently for another five months, including appearances in Israel, Thailand, and Indonesia.

In 1995, the band released the cover album &quot;Thank You&quot;. Songs from &quot;Thank You&quot; included covers of Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Perfect Day&quot; and Melle Mel&#x27;s &quot;White Lines (Don&#x27;t Don&#x27;t Do It)&quot; (with backing vocals from the original artists). The album also marked the temporary return of former drummer Roger Taylor, who joined the band in studio to play drums on &quot;Watching the Detectives&quot; and &quot;Perfect Day&quot; (as well as a cover of &quot;Jeepster&quot; by T. Rex that did not appear on the album). In a video interview provided with the album&#x27;s electronic press kit, Reed said he considered Duran Duran&#x27;s version the best cover ever done of one of his songs, and they received praise from Robert Plant and Jimmy Page for their cover of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Thank You&quot;.

===1997–2000: John Taylor&#x27;s departure and second trio===
After the promo tour for &quot;Thank You&quot; was completed, John Taylor co-founded the B5 Records label, recorded a solo album, founded and toured with the supergroup Neurotic Outsiders, and reunited the Power Station, though the project proceeded without him when he had to withdraw to deal with his divorce. Finally, after struggling for months to record the next album, &quot;Medazzaland&quot;, in January 1997, John Taylor announced at the DuranCon fan convention that he was leaving the band &quot;for good&quot;. His departure reduced the band to two long time members (Le Bon and Rhodes) and Cuccurullo, who decided to continue recording under the name Duran Duran.

Freed from some internal writing conflicts, the band returned to the studio to rewrite and re-record many of the songs on &quot;Medazzaland&quot; (John Taylor&#x27;s work remains on only four tracks). The album marked a return to the layered experimentation of &quot;Big Thing&quot;, with intricate guitar textures and processed vocals. The track &quot;Out of My Mind&quot; was used as the theme song for the film &quot;The Saint&quot; (1997), but the only true single to be released in the United States was the quirky &quot;Electric Barbarella&quot;, which is one of the first singles ever to be sold online. The music video for this single, featuring a sexy robot purchased and played with by band members, had to be censored before airing on MTV, but there was little of the controversy that had surrounded &quot;Girls on Film&quot;. &quot;Electric Barbarella&quot; peaked at number 52 in the US in October 1997. Although &quot;Medazzaland&quot; was released in the US in October 1997, the album was never released in the UK. &quot;Electric Barbarella&quot; was later released in the UK as a single from the 1998 &quot;Greatest&quot; compilation album and peaked at number 23 on the UK chart in January 1999. The group played a set at the Princess Diana Tribute Concert on 27 June 1998 by special request of her family.

Duran Duran parted ways with Capitol/EMI in 1999, although the label has since used Duran Duran&#x27;s back catalogue to release several compilations of remixes and rare vinyl-only B-sides. The band then signed what was intended to be a three-album contract with Disney Music Group&#x27;s Hollywood Records, but it lasted only through the poorly received 2000 album &quot;Pop Trash&quot;. This slow-paced and heavy album seemed out-of-keeping with earlier band material. Rhodes&#x27; intricate production and Cuccurullo&#x27;s songwriting and experimentation with guitar sounds and time signatures were not enough to hook the public, and the album did not perform well. The dreamy single &quot;Someone Else Not Me&quot; lasted barely two weeks on the radio, although its video was noted as the first to be produced entirely with Flash animation. While supporting &quot;Medazzaland&quot; and &quot;Pop Trash&quot;, Duran Duran toured with bassist Wes Wehmiller and drummer Joe Travers.

===2001–2005: Reunion===

In 2000, Le Bon approached John Taylor with a proposal to reform Duran Duran&#x27;s classic line-up. They agreed to part company with Cuccurullo after completing the &quot;Pop Trash&quot; tour. Cuccurullo then announced on his website that he was leaving Duran Duran to resume work with his 1980s band Missing Persons. This announcement was confirmed the next day by Duran Duran&#x27;s website, followed a day later by the news that John, Roger and Andy had rejoined. To fulfill contractual obligations, Cuccurullo played three Duran Duran concerts in Japan in June 2001, ending his tenure in the band.

Throughout 2001, 2002 and 2003, the band worked on writing new material, initially renting a house in Saint-Tropez where audio engineer Mark Tinley built a recording studio for their first serious writing session. They then returned to London to do some self-financed work with various producers (including old friend Nile Rodgers) and search for a new record deal. It proved difficult to find a record label willing to gamble on the band&#x27;s comeback, so Duran Duran went on tour to prove the drawing power of the reunited band. The response of the fans and the media exceeded expectations. The band played a handful of 25th-anniversary dates across 2003, starting with two arena dates in Tokyo filled to capacity. Tickets sold out for each show within minutes, and celebrities turned out &quot;en masse&quot; for reunion dates. Amongst these were a number of shows at smaller venues that the band had played on both sides of the pond when they first got together in the early 1980s. In August, the band were booked as presenters at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, only to be surprised with a Lifetime Achievement Award. They also received a Lifetime Achievement award from &quot;Q&quot; magazine in October, and the equivalent Outstanding Contribution award at the BRIT Awards in February 2004.
The pace picked up with a sold-out tour of America, Australia and New Zealand. The band played a full concert at a private tailgate party at Super Bowl XXXVIII, their performance of &quot;The Wild Boys&quot; broadcast to millions during the pre-game show. A remix of the new track &quot;(Reach Up for The) Sunrise&quot; was released on many TV shows in February while magazines hailed (the modern &quot;Fab Five&quot;) Duran Duran as one of the greatest bands of all time. Duran Duran then celebrated their homecoming to the UK with fourteen stadium dates in April 2004, including five sold-out nights at Wembley Arena. The British press, traditionally hostile to the band, accorded the shows some very warm reviews. Duran Duran brought along band Goldfrapp and the Scissor Sisters as alternating opening acts for this tour. The last two shows were filmed, resulting in the concert DVD &quot;Duran Duran: Live from London&quot; which was released in November.

Finally, with more than thirty-five songs completed, the band signed a two-album contract with Epic Records in June, and completed the new album, now titled &quot;Astronaut&quot;. The album was released in October 2004 and entered the UK charts at number three and the US charts at number 17. The first single was &quot;(Reach Up for The) Sunrise&quot;, which reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; US Dance chart in November and peaked at number five on the UK Singles Chart, Duran Duran&#x27;s highest chart position since &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; in 1985. A second single, &quot;What Happens Tomorrow&quot;, debuted at No. 11 on the UK chart in February. A 5.1 mix of &quot;Astronaut&quot; was created by Jeremy Wheatley for the dual-disc release of &quot;Astronaut&quot;. The CD side contains the album as-is and the DVD side contains the 5.1 mix of the album in DVD Audio format along with some DVD footage and videos.

After a world tour in early 2005, Duran Duran were presented with the PRS Outstanding Contribution to British Music at the 2005 Ivor Novello Awards. Later that summer, the band headlined the massive Live 8 concert, Rome on 2 July 2005 in the Circus Maximus.

===2006–2008: &quot;Red Carpet Massacre&quot; and Andy Taylor&#x27;s second departure===

In early 2006, Duran Duran covered John Lennon&#x27;s song &quot;Instant Karma!&quot; for the &quot;Make Some Noise&quot; campaign sponsored by Amnesty International. Their version later appeared on &quot;Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur&quot; as an iTunes exclusive bonus track. They also performed at two high-profile events – the Nobel Prize Awards and the 2006 Winter Olympics. After a couple of weeks of songwriting in Northern California, the band began working with producer Michael Patterson in London, and continued intermittently for the next several months. At one point, they reported having had fifteen tracks nearly complete for an album tentatively titled &quot;Reportage&quot;, but no further news emerged from the band for months afterward. In September, the band held meetings in New York City with Justin Timberlake and producer Timbaland with an eye to a potential collaboration and were soon reported to have completed three songs with the producer, including a song with Justin Timberlake.

On 25 October 2006, Duran Duran parted company with Andy Taylor once again. In an official announcement on their website, the band stated that an &quot;unworkable gulf&quot; had developed between them and Taylor and that &quot;we can no longer effectively function together&quot;. It was noted by Andy Taylor in his book &quot;Wild Boy&quot; that tensions had arisen between the group&#x27;s management and himself, and he was also diagnosed with clinical depression connected with the death of his father. Dom Brown, who had previously toured with the band, again took over guitar duties and has been performing with them since. After Taylor&#x27;s departure, the band scrapped the &quot;Reportage&quot; album. They wrote and recorded a new album titled &quot;Red Carpet Massacre&quot; (2007), which included the Timbaland tracks. Dom Brown is the featured guitarist on the album.

In July 2007, the band performed twice at Wembley Stadium. Their first appearance at the stadium was the Concert for Diana which celebrated the life of Princess Diana almost 10 years after her death. The band performed &quot;(Reach Up for The) Sunrise&quot;, &quot;The Wild Boys&quot; and &quot;Rio&quot;. Their second appearance was at Live Earth concert, London. On 25 September, the Timberlake collaboration &quot;Falling Down&quot; was released as a download single on iTunes, and the band announced that they would play nine shows at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on Broadway to launch the &quot;Red Carpet Massacre&quot; album. The album launch was later extended to incorporate a show in London on 3 December 2007 and one in Dublin on 5 December 2007.

In May 2008, they toured the US leg of their 2008 world tour and were supported by the British band Your Vegas. In June 2008, they played the Louvre in Paris in a fundraising effort that contributed to the restoration of a Louis XV drawing room. Guests dined, privately viewed some of the museum&#x27;s artworks, then attended a performance by the band in the I.M. Pei-designed Pyramid du Louvre. The group&#x27;s performance marked a first for the 18th-century museum which had never before allowed a rock concert to occur anywhere within the grounds or buildings and another groundbreaker for Duran Duran.

On 2 July 2008, in Paris, Mark Ronson performed a unique live set with Duran Duran for an exclusive, invitation-only performance. Together, they showcased specially re-worked versions of some of Duran Duran&#x27;s classic hits re-created by Ronson, along with tracks from &quot;Red Carpet Massacre&quot;. Le Bon also performed songs from Ronson&#x27;s latest album, &quot;Version&quot; (2007), as one of Ronson&#x27;s featured guest vocalists. Unlike the band&#x27;s previous album &quot;Astronaut&quot; (2004), &quot;Red Carpet Massacre&quot; sold poorly and received mixed responses from the music press. In 2008, &quot;Rio&quot; was included in the &quot;Classic Albums&quot; series.

===2009–2012: &quot;All You Need Is Now&quot;===

The band departed from Epic Records in 2009, after releasing just two albums. In early 2010, it was revealed that the band would be contributing a cover of &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot; to a tribute/charity record for David Bowie called &quot;We Were So Turned On&quot; from which all profits go to War Child. Other contributing artists included Carla Bruni, Devendra Banhart, Edward Sharpe &amp; the Magnetic Zeros, and Warpaint. The album was released on 14 September 2010 on Manimal Vinyl Records. A limited edition split 7-inch single with Duran Duran and Carla Bruni was also released on Manimal Vinyl in December 2010.

On 21 December 2010, Duran Duran&#x27;s thirteenth album, titled &quot;All You Need Is Now&quot;, produced by the Grammy Award-winning Mark Ronson and mixed by Spike Stent, was released exclusively on iTunes and hit the number one spot on download charts in 15 countries (including the UK). The first single from the record, title track &quot;All You Need Is Now&quot;, was free to download worldwide on 8 December 2010 exclusively in iTunes. Guitarist and songwriter Dom Brown co-wrote all but two songs on the album.

On 25 February 2011, while in Milan, Duran Duran received a Style Icons of the 20th Century Award and a key to the city, presented by the city&#x27;s mayor Letizia Moratti.

In March 2011 the band embarked on a world tour in support of the album. After a warm-up show in London, the tour officially began 16 March 2011 in Austin, Texas. On 23 March, the band performed live at the Mayan Theater in Los Angeles as the start of the second season of &quot;&quot;. The concert was directed by David Lynch and live-streamed on YouTube. The band was joined onstage by Gerard Way of My Chemical Romance, Beth Ditto of Gossip, and Kelis. On 17 April 2011, Duran Duran performed at the Coachella Music Festival located at Empire Polo Grounds, in Indio, California. In May 2011, Le Bon contracted laryngitis leading to either cancellation or rescheduling of most of the European dates for the &quot;All You Need Is Now&quot; World Tour.

On 27 July 2012, Duran Duran headlined the London Summer Olympics 2012 Opening Ceremony celebration in Hyde Park. They represented England, along with Snow Patrol for Northern Ireland, Stereophonics for Wales, and Paolo Nutini for Scotland. At the end of August 2012, with one week left of their 18-month world tour, the band were forced to cancel the rest of the North American leg of the tour as Nick Rhodes had become ill with a viral infection.

===2013–2018: &quot;Paper Gods&quot;===
On 4 March 2013, the band returned to the studio to work on their fourteenth album, and continued during the week beginning 23 September. They reconvened 13 to 18 December. On 31 December 2013, the band posted a mixtape curated by John Taylor as a New Year&#x27;s &quot;thank you&quot; to their fans. On 10 February 2014, John Taylor and Roger Taylor worked with the Voce Chamber Choir and London Youth Chamber Choir on vocals for use on some Duran Duran tracks. Then former Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante worked with the band on the new album.

On 11 September 2015, the album &quot;Paper Gods&quot; was released. The single &quot;Pressure Off&quot; was also released the same week, first via Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Music. The song subsequently appeared on Google Play Music. The album debuted at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the band&#x27;s highest debut in 22 years. The album also reached number two in Italy, number four in the Netherlands, and number five in the UK. In 2016, the artist MNDR stood in for Rhodes during part of the third leg of the Paper Gods tour in the United States, while he returned to the UK in order to attend to an urgent family matter. Rhodes was quoted as saying, &quot;I will be back as soon as I can but know, in the meantime, that I am leaving both the band and fans in great hands, with the fabulous MNDR.&quot; Also, several remixes of their song &quot;Last Night in the City&quot; were released in digital form in that year.

In December 2016, the original five-piece lineup lost a case in the British High Court after they attempted to reclaim the U.S. copyright on their first three albums from Gloucester Place Music, part of EMI Music Publishing. Rhodes commented, &quot;We signed a publishing agreement as unsuspecting teenagers, over three decades ago, when just starting out and when we knew no better... if left untested, this judgment sets a very bad precedent for all songwriters of our era.&quot; In March 2020, Duran Duran signed with the Warner/Chappell Music publisher, covering their post-1986 catalogue. The band spent 2017 touring the American continent and playing a handful of festival dates in Europe and Asia.

===2019–2022: &quot;Future Past&quot; and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction===

In 2019, Duran Duran were working on a new album with Ronson, Erol Alkan and Giorgio Moroder handling production duties, and Graham Coxon and Lykke Li being confirmed as collaborators. Rhodes described the content and sound of a possible first single to be &quot;very different for us.&quot; Initially planned for release in 2020, the recording of the album was put on hold in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 8 January 2021, a cover of &quot;Five Years&quot; by David Bowie was released for the fifth anniversary of his death. On 13 January 2021, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included the album at number 50 on their &quot;54 Most Anticipated Albums of 2021&quot; list. Le Bon said that the album is &quot;quite naked, raw. The grass is slightly sharp and twinkly rather than smooth,&quot; and is &quot;groovy (and) modern and very honest. The lyrics are quite something.” On 18 May, the album title was announced as &quot;Future Past&quot;.

On 19 May, the first single from the album &quot;Invisible&quot; was released along with a music video, and features Coxon as a guitarist and co-writer. On 9 July, the band premiered a second song from the album titled &quot;Give It All Up&quot; on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show. On 5 August, Duran Duran released the album&#x27;s second single &quot;More Joy!&quot;, featuring further collaboration with Coxon, Erol Alkan and also Japanese rock band Chai. On 12 August, the band appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon&quot; performing &quot;Invisible&quot;. On 31 August, Duran Duran released the album&#x27;s third single &quot;Anniversary&quot;, followed by the fourth single, &quot;Tonight United&quot;, on 24 September. On 14 and 15 September, the band played two sold-out gigs at Birmingham&#x27;s O2 Institute. That was the first time they played live since their last live gig in 2019. Along with their hit songs, they performed three tracks from &quot;Future Past&quot;—&quot;Invisible&quot;, &quot;Anniversary&quot; and &quot;Tonight United&quot;. The band headlined the Isle of Wight festival on 19 September.

On 22 October 2021, &quot;Future Past&quot; was released. The album entered the UK Album Chart at number three, the band&#x27;s highest peak since 2004&#x27;s &quot;Astronaut&quot;. This also earned the band the distinction of having UK Top 5 albums in each of the five decades they had been releasing music (1980s–2020s). On 22 January 2022, Duran Duran played on &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;. In June 2022, Duran Duran performed at the Platinum Party at the Palace. In July 2022, the band returned to the city of their origin, Birmingham to headline the opening ceremony of Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games playing to a capacity Alexander Stadium.

In 2022, the band topped the fan vote for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for the class of 2022, and in May of that year were announced as one of the seven inductees in the &quot;Performer&quot; category. The ceremony was held on 5 November 2022, where Robert Downey Jr. inducted the band. John Taylor, Roger Taylor, Rhodes and Le Bon each attended the induction ceremony and performed &quot;Girls on Film&quot;, &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; and &quot;Ordinary World&quot; along with longtime touring guitarist Dom Brown. During the acceptance speech, Simon Le Bon read from a letter written by Andy Taylor, who was absent from the ceremony, that revealed he has been privately fighting stage IV metastatic prostate cancer for the past four years and was &quot;massively disappointed&quot; he couldn&#x27;t attend.

===2023–present: &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;===

On 20 March 2023, Duran Duran took to their Instagram to announce they are working on a new musical project, set for release in late 2023. The work will feature a collaboration with former band members Andy Taylor and Warren Cuccurullo. The project, &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;, was released on 27 October. A Halloween-themed album, it features new songs, reworkings of older material and several covers.

The first single – the title track &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; – was released on 30 August 2023. The second single, &quot;Black Moonlight&quot;, followed on 21 September.

On 13 September 2024, the band released a new reworking of their 1983 single &quot;New Moon on Monday&quot; titled &quot;New Moon (Dark Phase)&quot;, ahead of a planned deluxe reissue of &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;. The single features contributions from Andy Taylor.

In 2025, Carlo Conti announced that Duran Duran would be special guests of Sanremo Music Festival in the third night. They perform with Victoria De Angelis.

==Influences==
Although they began their career as &quot;a group of art school, experimental, post punk rockers,&quot; the band&#x27;s quick rise to stardom, polished good looks and embrace of the teen press almost guaranteed disfavour from music critics. During the 1980s, Duran Duran were considered the quintessential manufactured, throw-away pop group. However, according to the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot;, &quot;To describe them, as some have, as the first boy band, misrepresents their appeal. Their weapons were never just their looks, but self-penned songs.&quot; Moby said of the band in his blog in 2003: &quot;... they were cursed by what we can call the &#x27;Bee Gees&#x27; curse, which is: &#x27;write amazing songs, sell tons of records, and consequently incur the wrath or disinterest of the rock obsessed critical establishment.&#x27;&quot;

Influences on Duran Duran included David Bowie, Roxy Music, the Beatles and the Doors; the electronic music of John Foxx&#x27;s Ultravox, Kraftwerk, the Yellow Magic Orchestra and Giorgio Moroder; glam rock and American rock such as T. Rex, Iggy Pop, Lou Reed and Sparks; British punk and post-punk bands such as the Clash, Sex Pistols and Siouxsie and the Banshees; and the disco/funk band Chic. Duran Duran were also influenced by contemporary synth-pop groups, with records by Japan, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and the Human League becoming fixtures in Rhodes&#x27;s 1980 DJ sets at the Rum Runner club. Andy Taylor was a fan of the rock band AC/DC, &quot;...all these different influences were coming into the studio. Somehow, it had its own life. It became very unique in itself. It was influenced by a lot of different people&quot;, Roger Taylor said in a 2012 interview.

Several of the band&#x27;s contemporaries including the Bangles, Elton John, Kylie Minogue, Paul Young and even the Monkees, have named themselves fans of the band&#x27;s music. Le Bon described the group as &quot;the band to dance to when the bomb drops&quot;. Successors like Barenaked Ladies, Beck, Jonathan Davis of Korn, the Bravery, Gwen Stefani and Pink have all cited Duran Duran as a key band in their formative years. Justin Timberlake is a fan of the band and presented them with the Outstanding Contribution award at the 2004 Brit Awards. The most recent crop of performers to name Duran Duran as an influence include Dido, Franz Ferdinand, Panic! at the Disco, Goldfrapp and Brandon Flowers of the Killers, who said, &quot;Nick Rhodes is an absolute hero of mine—their records still sound fresh, which is no mean feat as far as synths are concerned.&quot;

Rhodes has directly lent his production techniques to Kajagoogoo&#x27;s debut album &quot;White Feathers&quot; (1983) and its number one single &quot;Too Shy&quot;, and to the Dandy Warhols&#x27; fourth album &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House&quot; (2003). The band&#x27;s music has been used by several hip hop artists, most notably the Notorious B.I.G., who sampled Duran Duran&#x27;s 1986 single &quot;Notorious&quot;. Numerous bands have covered their music on record and in concert.

==Videos==
The MTV cable channel and the band were launched at about the same time, and each had a hand in propelling the other to greater heights. MTV needed showcase videos with charismatic performers. Les Garland, senior executive vice-president at MTV, said &quot;I remember our director of talent and artist relations came running in and said, &quot;You have got to see this video that&#x27;s come in&quot;. Duran Duran were getting zero radio airplay at the time, and MTV wanted to try to break new music. &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; was the greatest video I&#x27;d ever seen&quot;. The band&#x27;s video work was influential in several ways. First, Duran Duran filmed in exotic locales like Sri Lanka and Antigua, creating memorable images that were radically different from the then-common low budget &quot;band-playing-on-a-stage&quot; videos. Second, rather than simply playing their instruments, the band participated in mini-storylines (often taking inspiration from contemporary movies: &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; riffs on 1981&#x27;s &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, &quot;The Wild Boys&quot; on 1981&#x27;s &quot;Mad Max 2&quot;), etc. While videos were already headed in this direction, Duran Duran led the trend with a style, featuring quick editing, arresting graphic design, and surreal-to-nonsensical image inserts, that drew attention from commentators and spawned a wealth of imitators.

Duran Duran were among the first bands to have their videos shot with a professional movie camera on 35mm film, rather than on videotape, making them look superior to many of the quickly shot videos which had been MTV staples until then. MTV provided Duran Duran with access to American radio markets that were unfriendly to British music, new wave music, or &quot;anything with synthesisers&quot;. Because MTV was not available everywhere in the United States at first, it was easy to see a pattern: where MTV went, listener demand for Duran Duran, Tears for Fears, Def Leppard and other European bands with interesting videos went through the roof. The band&#x27;s sun-drenched videos for &quot;Rio&quot;, &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; and &quot;Save a Prayer&quot;, and the surreal &quot;Is There Something I Should Know?&quot; were filmed by future movie director Russell Mulcahy, who made eleven videos for the band. Duran Duran have always sought out innovative directors and techniques, even in their later years when MTV gave them little airplay. In addition to Mulcahy, they have had videos filmed by influential photographers Dean Chamberlain and Ellen von Unwerth, Chinese director Chen Kaige, documentary filmmaker Julien Temple, and the Polish Brothers, among others. According to Rhodes, &quot;Video is to us like stereo was to Pink Floyd.&quot;

In 1984, Duran Duran introduced video technology into their live stadium shows by being among the first acts to provide video screens above the stage. They have recorded concerts using IMAX and 360-degree panoramic &quot;immersive video&quot; cameras, with 10.2 channel audio. In 2000, they experimented with augmented reality technology, which allowed three-dimensional computer-generated images to appear on stage with the band. They appeared on several century-end video countdowns: The MTV &quot;100 Greatest Videos Ever Made&quot; featured &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; at No. 11 and &quot;Girls on Film&quot; at No. 68, and the &quot;VH1: 100 Greatest Videos&quot; listed &quot;Hungry&quot; at No. 31 and &quot;Rio&quot; at No. 60. MTV named &quot;Hungry&quot; the 15th of their most played videos of all time.

The band has released several video compilations, starting with the self-titled &quot;video album&quot; &quot;Duran Duran&quot; (1983), for which they won a Grammy Award, up to the 2004 two-disc DVD release &quot;Greatest&quot;, which included alternative versions of several popular videos as Easter eggs. In addition to &quot;Greatest&quot;, the documentary &quot;Sing Blue Silver&quot;, and the concert film &quot;Arena&quot; (both from 1984) were released on DVD in 2004. &quot;Live from London&quot;, a concert video from one of their sold-out 2004 reunion shows at Wembley Arena, was released in the fall of 2005.

Other video collections, concert films, and documentaries remain available only on videotape, and Duran Duran have not yet released a collection which includes all their videos. The band has said that a huge amount of unreleased concert and documentary footage has been filmed over the years, which they hope can be edited and released in some form in the near future. The video for &quot;Falling Down&quot; was released in October 2007. The Nick Egan-directed video for the lead single and title track from &quot;All You Need Is Now&quot; was premiered via Yahoo Music on 20 December 2010. The second video from &quot;All You Need Is Now&quot;, &quot;Girl Panic&quot;, was released on 8 November 2011. It features some of the world&#x27;s most famous supermodels, such as Yasmin Le Bon, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Eva Herzigová and Helena Christensen, playing the band. The video was directed by Jonas Akerlund, and during the filming, an editorial was made for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; magazine.

==Visual style==

From the beginning of their career, all the members had a keen sense of visual style. They worked with stylist Perry Haines and fashion designers such as Kahn &amp; Bell and Antony Price to build a sharp and elegant image, soon outgrowing the ruffles and sashes of the pirate-flavoured early New Romantic look that had been popularised by Adam Ant during 1980–81. They have continued to present fashion as part of their package throughout their career. In the 1990s they worked with Vivienne Westwood and in the 2000s with Giorgio Armani. The band retained creative control of their visual presentation having worked closely with graphic designer Malcolm Garrett and many others over the years to create album covers, tour programs and other materials.

Teen and music magazines in the UK latched onto their good looks quickly, and the USA soon followed. It was a rare month in the early 1980s when there was not at least one picture of the band members in teen magazines such as &quot;Smash Hits&quot; or &quot;Tiger Beat&quot;. John Taylor once remarked that the band was &quot;like a box of Quality Street [chocolates]; everyone is someone&#x27;s favourite&quot; Duran Duran later came to regret this early pin-up exposure, but at the time it helped attract national attention. In an interview with &quot;Rock Fever Superstars&quot; magazine in early 1988, John Taylor stated:

We used to be a very chi-chi name to drop in &#x27;79, but then the Fab Five hype started and something went wrong. Something went really wrong. That wasn&#x27;t what I wanted. [...] Not that I didn&#x27;t like being screamed at. At one point I really did&quot;.

<text>The Dallas Symphony Orchestra (DSO) is an American orchestra based in Dallas, Texas. Its principal performing venue is the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center in the Arts District of downtown Dallas.

==History==
The orchestra traces its origins to a concert given by a group of forty musicians in 1900 with conductor Hans Kreissig. It continued to perform and grow in numbers and stature, so that in 1945 it was in a position to appoint Antal Doráti as music director. Under Doráti, the orchestra became fully professional. Several times during the history of the orchestra it has suspended operations, including periods during the First and Second World Wars from 1914 to 1918 and from 1942 to 1945, and more recently in 1974 due to fiscal restraints. Subsequent music directors have included Georg Solti, Anshel Brusilow, and Eduardo Mata. Andrew Litton was music director from 1994 to 2006. During Litton&#x27;s tenure, the orchestra recorded the four Rachmaninoff piano concerti and the &quot;Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini&quot; with Stephen Hough for Hyperion Records.

In 2007, Jaap van Zweden was named the DSO&#x27;s 15th music director, and began his tenure in the 2008–2009 season with an initial contract of four years. In October 2009, the orchestra announced the extension of van Zweden&#x27;s contract through the 2015–2016 season. In November 2013, the orchestra announced a further extension of van Zweden&#x27;s contract through 2019. In January 2016, the orchestra announced the rescheduled conclusion of van Zweden&#x27;s tenure as music director after the 2017–2018 season, after which time he was scheduled to serve as the orchestra&#x27;s conductor laureate from 2018 through 2021.

In 2002, Fabio Luisi first guest-conducted the orchestra. His next Dallas guest-conducting appearance was in March 2018. On the basis of this guest-conducting engagement, in June 2018, the orchestra named Luisi its next music director, effective with the 2020–2021 season. He held the title of music director-designate in the 2019–2020 season. In January 2021, the orchestra announced the extension of Luisi&#x27;s contract as music director through 2029.

The current president and chief executive officer of the orchestra is Kim Noltemy. In October 2018, the orchestra announced the appointment of Gemma New as its next principal guest conductor, the first female conductor to hold the title, effective with the 2019–2020 season. In December 2021, the orchestra extended New&#x27;s contract as principal guest conductor through the 2022–2023 season. In May 2023, the orchestra announced the appointment of Enrico Lopez-Yañez as Principal Conductor of the Dallas Symphony Presents and Anthony Blake Clark as the new Chorus Director. In May 2024, the orchestra announced that Noltemy is to stand down as its president and chief executive officer on 28 June 2024.

<text>Sigur Rós () is an Icelandic post-rock band that formed in 1994 in Reykjavík. It comprises lead vocalist and guitarist Jón Þór &quot;Jónsi&quot; Birgisson, bassist Georg Hólm, and keyboardist Kjartan Sveinsson. Known for their ethereal sound, frontman Jónsi&#x27;s falsetto vocals, and their use of bowed guitar, Sigur Rós incorporate classical and minimal aesthetic elements. Jónsi&#x27;s vocals are sung in Icelandic and non-linguistic vocalisations the band terms &quot;Vonlenska&quot;. They have released eight studio albums, and attracted critical and commercial attention with their second album &quot;Ágætis byrjun&quot;.

==History==
===1997–1998: &quot;Von&quot; and &quot;Von brigði&quot;===

Jón Þór &quot;Jónsi&quot; Birgisson (guitar and vocals), Georg Hólm (bass) and Ágúst Ævar Gunnarsson (drums) formed Sigur Rós in Reykjavík in January 1994. The band&#x27;s name, which means &quot;Victory Rose&quot;, is taken from the name of Jónsi&#x27;s younger sister, Sigurrós, born a few days before the band was formed.

Sigur Rós signed a record deal with the Icelandic Sugarcubes-owned record label Bad Taste, because they thought the falsetto vocals would appeal to teenage girls. In 1997, they released &quot;Von&quot; and in 1998 a remix collection, &quot;Von brigði&quot;. The band was joined by Kjartan Sveinsson on keyboards in 1998. He is the only member of Sigur Rós with musical training, and contributed most of the orchestral and string arrangements for their later work.

===1999–2001: &quot;Ágætis byrjun&quot;===

International acclaim came with 1999&#x27;s &quot;Ágætis byrjun&quot;. The album&#x27;s reputation spread by word of mouth over the following two years. Soon critics worldwide were praising it effusively, and the band drew praise from high-profile acts such as Radiohead, Coldplay and David Bowie.

Three songs, &quot;Ágætis byrjun&quot;, &quot;Svefn-g-englar&quot;, and a live take, from a 2000 concert in Denmark, of the then-unreleased &quot;Njósnavélin&quot; (later &#x27;unnamed&#x27; &quot;Untitled #4&quot;) appeared in the Cameron Crowe film &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;. The former two also subsequently appeared in the US version of the television series &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;. Their music has also appeared in the TV series &quot;24&quot; with &quot;Ný batterí&quot;, and &quot;&quot; with &quot;Svefn-g-englar&quot;. In 2004, Wes Anderson used &quot;Starálfur&quot; in &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot; as did the Emmy-winning 2005 TV film &quot;The Girl in the Café&quot;. In Enki Bilal&#x27;s &quot;Immortel (Ad Vitam)&quot; the song &quot;Hjartað hamast (bamm bamm bamm)&quot; is used. The song &quot;Svefn-g-englar&quot; was also used on &quot;V&quot; on 24 November 2009, and features prominently in &quot;Café de Flore&quot; released in 2011.

After the release of &quot;Ágætis byrjun&quot;, the band became known for Jónsi&#x27;s signature style of reverb accentuated guitar work using a cello&#x27;s bow.

===2001–2004: &quot;( )&quot;===

In 2001, Sigur Rós christened their newly completed studio by recording an EP titled &quot;Rímur&quot; with an Icelandic fisherman named Steindór Andersen. The EP contains six songs, all of which feature Steindór Andersen reciting traditional Icelandic rímur poetry. Sigur Rós accompany him on three songs. Two songs feature Steindór alone. The last song on the EP, &quot;Lækurinn&quot;, is a duet with Sigurður Sigurðarson. A thousand copies of the EP were printed and sold during the spring tour of 2001. The EP was sold in a blank-white-paper case. In 2001 the band toured in Canada, performing at Massey Hall in Toronto in September.

Drummer Ágúst left the band after the recording of &quot;Ágætis byrjun&quot; and was replaced by Orri Páll Dýrason. In 2002, their highly anticipated follow-up album &quot;( )&quot; was released. Upon release all tracks on the album were untitled, though the band later published song names on their website. All of the lyrics on &quot;( )&quot; are sung in &quot;Vonlenska&quot;, also known as Hopelandic, a language without semantic meaning, which resembles the phonology of the Icelandic language. It has also been said that the listener is supposed to interpret their own meanings of the lyrics which can then be written in the blank pages in the album booklet.

In 2002, the band also wrote an original score for the Bodyscript dance production by Wayne McGregor Random Dance in collaboration with Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre and the Arts Council England.

In October 2003, Sigur Rós and Radiohead both composed music for Merce Cunningham&#x27;s dance piece &quot;Split Sides&quot;; Sigur Rós&#x27;s three tracks were released on the March 2004 EP &quot;Ba Ba Ti Ki Di Do&quot;. Radiohead&#x27;s contribution was not commercially released. Sigur Rós&#x27; 1997 debut album &quot;Von&quot; found a US and UK release in October 2004.

&quot;Untitled 3&quot; (a.k.a. Samskeyti) from the album is used on the video &quot;6AM&quot; by film maker Carmen Vidal, winner of the 2006 Student Academy Award.
&quot;Untitled 3&quot; is also used at the end credits of the indie drama movie, &quot;Mysterious Skin&quot;. It can also be heard in &quot;Skins&quot; and &quot;&quot; and the British TV Documentary &quot;Protecting Our Children&quot; as well as during a section of the London 2012 summer Olympics on the BBC. It can also be heard in the climactic scene of Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga on Netflix. &quot;Untitled 4&quot; from the album (also called &quot;Njósnavélin&quot;) featured in the final scene of &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;, and director Cameron Crowe commented, &quot;We struggled to find an appropriate track to end the film with and then I went to see Sigur Rós perform in Los Angeles and they played this song, &quot;Njósnavélin&quot;, that was just perfect. I had to have it.&quot; This track is also featured on Canadian TV series &quot;Orphan Black&quot; in episode 10 of season 3.

===2005–2006: &quot;Takk...&quot;===

Their fourth album, &quot;Takk...&quot; employs the distinctive sound of their second album in a more rock oriented structure with greater use of the guitar, and was released in September 2005. &quot;Hoppípolla&quot;, the second official single from &quot;Takk...&quot;, was released in November alongside a new studio remake of &quot;Hafsól&quot;, a song that was previously released on the band&#x27;s 1997 debut, &quot;Von&quot;. &quot;Hoppípolla&quot; was used in the trailers for the BBC&#x27;s natural history series &quot;Planet Earth&quot; in 2006, as well as the closing credits for the 2006 FA Cup final, ITV&#x27;s coverage of the 2006 Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race, advertisements for the BBC&#x27;s coverage of England games during the 2006 FIFA World Cup, on television advertisements for RTÉ&#x27;s Gaelic games coverage in Ireland, and on an advertisement for Oxfam. It was also used in the final scene of the movie &quot;Penelope&quot;, for the trailer of the film &quot;Children of Men&quot; and for the trailer of the film &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot;. Following this, demand for the single grew. It was made more widely available by EMI in consequence. This song is also used in the trailer for the Disney movie &quot;Earth&quot; as well as in the 2011 film &quot;We Bought a Zoo&quot;. Whilst it does not appear on the film&#x27;s soundtrack Album, it is also featured in &quot;Eurovision Song Contest: The Story Of Fire Saga&quot;.

An extended &quot;Sæglópur&quot; EP was released in July 2006 in most parts of the world and in August in the United States. Its original release was scheduled in May, but because of the sudden demand of &quot;Hoppípolla&quot; it was pushed back from that date. Sigur Rós recorded three new songs to appear on the EP (&quot;Refur&quot;, &quot;Ó friður&quot;, and &quot;Kafari&quot;). In July 2006, Sigur Rós finished a major world tour with stops in Europe, the United States (where they played a headline show at the Hollywood Bowl), Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Japan. Upon return to their homeland, Sigur Rós provided a series of free surprise outdoor concerts throughout Iceland in July and August, playing in various venues such as abandoned bunkers and community coffee shops, all of which were included in the 2007 documentary film &quot;Heima&quot;. They also performed twice in the United States in February.

===2007: &quot;Heima&quot; and &quot;Hvarf/Heim&quot;===
In August 2007, a limited DVD+CD edition of the 2002 soundtrack to the documentary &quot;Hlemmur&quot; was released. &quot;Hvarf/Heim&quot; was released on 5 November (6 November in the U.S.), a double compilation album containing studio versions of previously unreleased songs — &quot;Salka&quot;, &quot;Hljómalind&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Rokklagið&quot;), &quot;Í Gær&quot; and &quot;Von&quot; on &quot;Hvarf&quot;, and acoustic studio versions of the songs: &quot;Samskeyti&quot;, &quot;Starálfur&quot;, &quot;Vaka&quot;, &quot;Ágætis Byrjun&quot;, &quot;Heysátan&quot; and &quot;Von&quot;, on &quot;Heim&quot;. On the same day (20 November in the U.S.) &quot;Heima&quot;, a live DVD of the previous summer&#x27;s Iceland tour, was released. Just prior to the release of &quot;Hvarf/Heim&quot;, on 29 October, a single named &quot;Hljómalind&quot; was released.

The 2007 feature-length documentary from Sigur Rós&#x27;s summer tour in Iceland, which occurred in 2006, attempts to shed light on the band&#x27;s homeland. Therefore, the film is called &quot;Heima&quot;, which means &quot;at home&quot;. In the movie, the band members express their interpretation of &quot;Iceland&quot;. The film revolves around three main elements; the band playing live, the Icelandic nature shaping their music, along with interviews, where they tell the viewers what it was like to play at home in addition to sharing their overall experience of the tour.

To promote their film &quot;Heima&quot;, the band scheduled a series of premiere screenings throughout the world, featuring a short acoustic set before the film and a question-and-answer session afterwards.

===2008: &quot;Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust&quot;===

Sigur Rós&#x27;s fifth regular studio album, &quot;Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust&quot;, was released in June 2008 to generally positive reviews. Stylistically different from their earlier releases, it featured fewer strings and more guitar, and had more pop-oriented songs, making it &quot;the group&#x27;s most accessible effort&quot; while maintaining the &quot;majestic beauty that defines the band&#x27;s music.&quot; The final track &quot;All Alright&quot; is the band&#x27;s first to be sung in English, though all the other lyrics are in Icelandic.
The band were announced as a headlining act for the 2008 Splendour in the Grass Festival in Byron Bay, Australia, Latitude Festival 2008, and the 2008 La Route du Rock Festival in St Malo, France. In addition, the band performed a late-night set at the 2008 Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee, where they blew a speaker at the end of their second song. Jónsi Birgisson commented, &quot;The piano is exploding, I think,&quot; one of the few things spoken in English.

The band released the first song from the album titled &quot;Gobbledigook&quot; for free on their website, along with a music video.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.nme.com/news/sigur-ros/36914&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.sigurros.com/dvd3.asp&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 June, the whole album was made available for free streaming on their website.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/band/disco/medsud-dot.php&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In autumn 2008 Sigur Rós embarked on a world tour supporting their newly released album. The band played as a four-piece without Amiina and the brass band, the first time the band had played as a four-piece in seven years. The tour started on 17 September 2008 in the United States, at the United Palace Theater in New York City, and finished with a concert in Reykjavík at Laugardalshöll on 23 November 2008. The majority of the tour was European with the exception of concerts in the United States, Australia, Canada and Japan.

The track &quot;Festival&quot; from the album features in the score of the 2010 film &quot;127 Hours&quot;, providing the euphoric backing to the climax of the movie. It is also featured at the end of HBO mini-series &quot;24/7 – Flyers-Rangers&quot;.

The track &quot;Untitled #7 (Dauðalagið)&quot; was also featured in the launch trailer for &quot;Dead Space&quot;.

===2009–2012: Hiatus, &quot;Inni&quot;, &quot;Valtari&quot;===
In 2009, Jónsi embarked on a solo adventure with his first solo album &quot;Go&quot;, released the next year.

On 28 May 2009, Sigur Rós announced that they had almost completed recording their latest album. The band said the album was taking form as a slower and more ambient record than both &quot;Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust&quot; and &quot;Takk...&quot;. The music was also described as melodic but much less noisy and more &quot;out there&quot; than previous albums. The unnamed album was expected to be released sometime in 2010. However, the band later revealed that the recordings had been scrapped. In a 2010 interview, Jónsi confirmed &quot;We haven&#x27;t got another album ready&quot;, he said. &quot;It was just a rumour. We started to record something, but then we chucked it all away. So I think we are going to have to start it all again&quot;. Without further word on the new album, Sigur Rós were rumoured to be on indefinite hiatus as of January 2010. However, before taking the stage at Coachella in April 2010, Jónsi commented that Sigur Rós would be getting back to work that year: &quot;I&#x27;m gonna record some other stuff with Sigur Rós when I&#x27;m home&quot;, between a series of shows during his solo tour in summer 2010. On 1 February 2011, Jónsi&#x27;s official website announced that he would be back in the studio with the band over the spring.

On 11 August 2011 Sigur Rós&#x27;s official website unveiled a trailer for a project called &quot;Inní&quot;, a DVD and double CD of the band&#x27;s live performances in London, directed by Vincent Morisset. It was screened at the 68th Venice International Film Festival, and saw official release in November 2011. On 16 September 2011, the &quot;Inni&quot; album and live video became available to pre-order from the band&#x27;s site in a variety of formats. Additionally, the band made the video for the song &quot;Festival&quot; available to watch online, as well as offering a free download of the audio from a live performance of the song.

On 3 November 2011, following the UK premiere of &quot;Inni&quot; at the British Film Institute in London, the band members participated in a Q&amp;A session during which Georg promised that 2012 would be a &quot;very busy&quot; year for Sigur Rós. The band hinted at a new album and tour in the second half of 2012. The Q&amp;A session was curtailed when a stage light began to emit smoke and the room was evacuated.
&quot;The band&#x27;s next album is scheduled for release in the spring. Based on excerpts presented by Mr. Sveinsson, the new music promises to be as exceptional as the best of the band&#x27;s catalog. Mr. Holm called it &quot;introverted&quot;, while Mr. Birgisson said it was &quot;floaty and minimal&quot;. &quot;An ambient album&quot; was how Mr. Dýrason described it, with &quot;a slow takeoff toward something&quot;. For a visitor who heard a preliminary recording in which Mr. Birgisson&#x27;s falsetto was surrounded by rich choral voices and what sounded like a pipe organ, the music was thrilling&quot;.

Beginning in February 2012, Sigur Rós announced their live return with festival appearances at Bestival in England, Summer Sonic Festival in Japan, and other shows in Ireland, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, France, Poland, and Italy. The band was also added to Montréal&#x27;s Osheaga 2012 lineup, and the 2012 Lollapalooza lineup.

After a four-year hiatus, an interview with the band in the March 2012 issue of &quot;Q&quot; magazine confirmed the completion of a new album, titled &quot;Valtari&quot;, scheduling its release on 28 May 2012. On 26 March 2012, the band released the first official single from the album, &quot;Ekki múkk.&quot; On 14 April 2012, a lower quality version of the complete album leaked out on the internet. On 10 May 2012, Sigur Rós&#x27;s new track &quot;Dauðalogn&quot; was premiered on &quot;The Departed&quot;, the season 3 finale of &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot;.

It was rumored that an already-complete additional album would follow-up their sixth release, &quot;Valtari&quot;. However, the band has dismissed the rumor as a &quot;fabrication&quot;.

On 2 November 2012, Georg Hólm confirmed that the band had already started work on a new album, due to be released some time in 2013. He described it as a dramatic change of direction, &quot;an anti-Valtari&quot;. The band performed a new song, entitled &quot;Brennisteinn&quot; (&#x27;brimstone&#x27;), in Reykjavík on 4 November at the Iceland Airwaves 2012 festival, to favourable reception. On 12 November 2012, the band announced a new North American tour, to take place in March and April 2013. The band also announced that every ticket purchased will include a new digital copy of a three-track EP, containing new and unreleased music, made available to ticket holders on 22 March 2013.

=== 2013–2019: &quot;Kveikur&quot; and departures of Kjartan and Orri ===
 On 24 January 2013, Sigur Rós announced in a Q&amp;A on Reddit that Kjartan had left the band, feeling it was time &quot;to do something different&quot;. They announced their seventh studio album, &quot;Kveikur&quot;, on 22 March. On the same day, they also released the album&#x27;s first single: &quot;Brennisteinn&quot;. The album was released on 14 June (releasing two days earlier in Japan, and four days later in the US) and marked both a musical and thematic change for the band, providing a more aggressive sound, compared to their previous albums. The album was well received by critics, scoring 80 on Metacritic, with several reviewers praising for the band&#x27;s new musical approach, as well as a lack of commercialism. The release was marked, by the band, with a new tour, as well as an interactive musical experience, where fans could live stream a concert, taking control of the camera. The band later performed at the iTunes Festival, on 2 September 2013, where selected portions of their concert were later released on 21 October.

The band provided original music and a rendition of &quot;&quot;The Simpsons&quot; Theme&quot;, as well as a brief cameo, for the &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Saga of Carl&quot;, which aired on 19 May 2013.

The band appeared in the HBO TV series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; episode &quot;The Lion and the Rose&quot; on 13 April 2014. They also covered the song &quot;The Rains of Castamere&quot;, which was originally recorded by the National for the earlier episode &quot;Blackwater&quot;.

Georg and Orri worked with Georg&#x27;s brother Kjartan Dagur &quot;KD&quot; Hólm and the composer Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson on the soundtrack to &quot;The Show of Shows: 100 Years of Vaudeville, Circuses and Carnivals&quot;. This was released as an album, &quot;Circe – Music Composed for The Show of Shows&quot;, on the Krunk label in the UK on 28 August 2015.

A reissue of the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Ágætis byrjun&quot;, was announced in early 2015. It was announced to feature previously unheard studio and live recordings as well as photographic and documentary material from their personal archives.

On 31 January 2017 it was announced that the band would be touring later in 2017, playing concerts in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, Croatia, Chile, Argentina and Brazil.

The band, in collaboration with Alex Somers, produced two instrumental pieces, &quot;End&quot; and &quot;Match&quot;, for the &quot;Black Mirror&quot; season four episode &quot;Hang the DJ&quot;, aired on 29 December 2017.

On 8 May 2018, the band released a new multimedia project called &quot;Liminal&quot;, which they described as an &quot;endless mixtape&quot; of ambient music which will be continuously added to over time. In addition, Jónsi, Somers, and frequent collaborator Paul Corley announced a series of &quot;live soundbaths,&quot; where the music would be played in front of an audience.

In September 2018, Orri was accused of sexual assault by artist Meagan Boyd. On 1 October 2018, he announced that he had decided to leave the band &quot;in light of the scale of this matter&quot;. In March 2019, Sigur Rós were charged with tax evasion, accused of having submitted incorrect tax returns from 2011 to 2014, evading 151 million Icelandic krona. The band members blamed their former accountant and said they were co-operating with the authorities. The case was dismissed in October 2019 but this decision was later overruled by an appellate court. Three members were cleared, but the charges against Jónsi and his company Frakkur proceeded. On March 24, 2023, all charges were dismissed.

=== 2020–present: Kjartan rejoins and &quot;Átta&quot; ===
In October 2020, the band announced that a new album, &quot;Odin&#x27;s Raven Magic&quot;, an orchestral work that was debuted live in 2002, would be released on 4 December 2020. This album is a live recording of the orchestral piece being performed in Paris in 2004. On 14 February 2022, Sigur Rós announced that Kjartan had rejoined them. The following week, they announced their first world tour in nearly five years. In addition to the tour, it was announced that the band are in the process of writing and recording a new album.

On 16 June 2023, Sigur Rós released &quot;Blóðberg&quot;, the first single from their eighth studio album, &quot;Átta&quot; (eight in Icelandic). The self-produced album was recorded at Sundlaugin Studio, on the rural outskirts of Reykjavík.

==Vonlenska==
&quot;Vonlenska&quot; (English: &quot;Hopelandic&quot;) is a term coined by the band to refer to the vocalizations that Jónsi sings on &quot;( )&quot; in lieu of lyrics in Icelandic. It takes its name from &quot;Von&quot;, a song on Sigur Rós&#x27;s debut album &quot;Von&quot; where it was first used. However, not all Sigur Rós songs are in Vonlenska; many are sung in Icelandic.

Vonlenska differs from both natural and constructed languages used for human communication. It consists of strings of meaningless syllables containing non-lexical vocables and phonemes. There is no grammatical relation between or among syllables, nor are they accompanied by clearly defined word boundaries. Vonlenska emphasizes the phonological and emotive qualities of human vocalizations, and it uses the melodic and rhythmic elements of singing without the conceptual content of language. In this way, it is similar to the use of scat singing in vocal jazz and puirt à beul in traditional Irish folk music and Scottish. The band&#x27;s website describes it as &quot;a form of gibberish vocals that fits to the music&quot;.

== Musical style and influences ==
Sigur Rós&#x27; music has been described as post-rock, and dream pop. Early influences for the band included British bands Spiritualized, the Verve, Ride, and Irish band My Bloody Valentine. The Scottish dream pop band Cocteau Twins was often cited as an influence on Birgisson early in his career; in fact he had not heard their music, but in an interview noted he was introduced to it subsequently by Alex Somers and remarked of the band &quot;they&#x27;re so good, man!&quot;.

<text>Étienne Baluze (24 November 1630 – 28 July 1718), known also as Stephanus Baluzius, was a French scholar and historiographer.

== Biography ==
Born in Tulle, he was educated at his native town, at the Jesuit college, where he studied the Arts. He then moved, on 31 December 1641, to the University of Toulouse, where, at the age of fifteen, he became a member of the Collège de St. Martial. He took minor orders, being called a &quot;cleric&quot;, in his admission certificate. As secretary to Pierre de Marca, archbishop of Toulouse, he won his appreciation of him, and at his death Marca left him all his papers. Baluze produced the first complete edition of Marca&#x27;s treatise &quot;De libertatibus Ecclesiae Gallicanae&quot; (1663), and brought out his &quot;Marca hispanica&quot; (1688).

In 1667, Baluze entered Jean-Baptiste Colbert&#x27;s service, and, until 1700, was in charge of the invaluable library belonging to that minister and to his son, Marquis de Seignelay. Colbert rewarded him for his work by obtaining various benefices for him and the post of king&#x27;s almoner (1679). Subsequently, Baluze was appointed professor of Canon law at the Collège de France on December 31, 1689, and directed it from 1707 to 1710.

He was unfortunate enough to take up the history of the House of Auvergne just at the time when the cardinal de Bouillon, inheritor of the rights, was endeavouring to prove the descent of the La Tour family, in the direct line from the ancient hereditary counts of Auvergne of the 9th century.

As authentic documents in support of these pretensions could not be found, false ones were fabricated. The production of spurious genealogies had already been begun in the &quot;Histoire de la maison d&#x27;Auvergne&quot; published by Christophe Justel in 1645; and Chorier, the historian of Dauphiny, had included in the second volume of his history (1672) a forged deed which connected the La Tours of Dauphiny with the La Tours of Auvergne. Next manufacture of forged documents was organized by Jean de Bar, an intimate companion of the cardinal. These documents succeeded in duping the most illustrious scholars; Dom Jean Mabillon, the founder of diplomatics, Dom Thierry Ruinart and Baluze himself, called as experts, made a unanimously favourable report on July 23, 1695. But cardinal de Bouillon had many enemies, and a war of pamphlets began.

In March 1698 Baluze in reply wrote a letter which proved nothing. Two years later, in 1700, Jean de Bar and his accomplices were arrested, and after a long and searching inquiry were declared guilty in 1704. Baluze, nevertheless, was obstinate in his opinion. He was convinced that the incriminated documents were genuine and proposed to do Justel&#x27;s work anew. Encouraged and financially supported by the cardinal de Bouillon, he published two works with &quot;Proofs&quot;, among which, unfortunately, we find all the deeds which had been pronounced spurious. In the following year he was suddenly engulfed in the disgrace, and exiled from Paris to Tours, where he lived until November 1713.

He continued to work, and in 1717 published a history of his native town, &quot;Historiae Tutelensis libri tres&quot;. In November 1713, he succeeded in returning to Paris, where he died on July 28, 1718.

== Works ==
His most highly regarded works are:
*&quot;Capitularia Regum Francorum&quot; (1677)
*&quot;Nova Collectio Conciliorum&quot; (1683)
*&quot;Miscellanea&quot; (1678—1715)
*&quot;Epistolae Innocentii Papae III&quot; (1682), a partial collection of the letters of Pope Innocent III. The collection is incomplete because Baluze was not permitted to access letters held by the Vatican.
*&quot;Vitae Paparum Avenionensium&quot; (1693)
*&quot;Histoire généalogique de la maison d&#x27;Auvergne&quot; (1708)
*&quot;Historia Tutelensis&quot; (1716)

== Recent events ==
A bust of Baluze, work of the contemporary sculptor Nacera Kainou, was installed in his native city, Tulle, in October 2006.

An Etienne Baluze European Local History Prize was recently created (summer 2007) by the &quot;Société des Amis du musée du cloître&quot; of Tulle, on the suggestion of the French historian Jean Boutier. An international jury, chaired by Professor Daniel Roche (Collège de France, Paris), and formed by Professors Jean Boutier and Alain Dewerpe (France), Peter Jones (UK), Marcello Verga (Italy) and Bartolomé Yun Casalila (Spain), gave the first prize to Italian historian Beatrice Palmero. François Hollande, President of the French Republic, awarded the first prize on 29 February 2008 in Tulle. The second Baluze prize was given on May 12, 2010, to English historian Allison Carol (University of Exeter; Birbeck College).

<doc id="148716" wikidata="Q1248124" url="?curid=148716" title="Jean-Louis Guez de Balzac">
<text>Jean-Louis Guez de Balzac (31 May 1597 – 18 February 1654) was a French author in Baroque Précieuses style, best known for his epistolary essays, which were widely circulated and read in his day. He was one of the founding members of the .

==Life and career==
Guez de Balzac was born at Angoulême. Originally thought to have been born in 1595, the date was revised in 1848 upon the discovery of a baptismal certificate dated June 1, 1597, although this is still controversial because his birth certificate contained several irregularities. He was born in a well off bourgeois family, which also had acquired noble titles. In his youth, he studied at two Jesuit colleges in Angoulême and Poitiers, where he learned Latin well, especially rhetoric.

In 1612, he met Théophile de Viau when de Viau&#x27;s troupe visited Angoulême, and fled from home with the troupe. The two traveled together with the troupe for some time, but when the troupe arrived at Leiden, they enrolled as students at the city&#x27;s university in May 1615, although it&#x27;s possible that they visited the university in 1613 as well.

His letters to his acquaintances and to important courtiers gained him a great reputation. Compliments were showered on him, and he became an &quot;habitué&quot; of the Hotel de Rambouillet. In 1624 a collection of his &quot;Lettres&quot; was published, and was received with great favour. From Chateau de Balzac, where he had retired, he continued to correspond with Jean Chapelain, Valentin Conrart and others.

In 1634 Balzac was elected to the . He died at Angoulême twenty years later.

Guez de Balzac&#x27;s fame rests chiefly upon the &quot;Lettres&quot;, a second collection of which appeared in 1636. &quot;Recueil de nouvelles lettres&quot; was printed in the next year. His letters, though empty and affected in matter, show a real mastery of style, introducing a new clearness and precision into French prose and encouraging the development of the language on national lines by emphasizing its most idiomatic elements. Balzac has thus the credit of executing in French prose a reform parallel to François de Malherbe&#x27;s in verse. In 1631 he published a eulogy of King Louis XIII of France entitled &quot;Le Prince&quot;; in 1652 the &quot;Socrate chrétien&quot;, and &quot;Aristippe ou de la Cour&quot; in 1658.

Since 1962, his name is given to the Lycée Guez-de-Balzac in Angoulême (Charente, France).

<doc id="148720" wikidata="Q221494" url="?curid=148720" title="Quiet Riot">
<text>Quiet Riot is an American heavy metal band founded in Los Angeles in 1973 by guitarist Randy Rhoads and bassist Kelly Garni.

The original lineup featured Rhoads and Garni with lead vocalist Kevin DuBrow and drummer Drew Forsyth, though that version of the band was mired in turmoil that would eventually see Garni fired for making death threats towards DuBrow. Their most commercially successful lineup consisted of DuBrow alongside guitarist Carlos Cavazo, bassist Rudy Sarzo and drummer Frankie Banali, and in 1983 released their breakthrough album &quot;Metal Health&quot;, which is known for being the first heavy metal album to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. The band had several hit singles which charted on the Billboard Hot 100, including &quot;Cum On Feel the Noize&quot;, &quot;Mama Weer All Crazee Now&quot; (both cover songs of the glam rock band Slade), and &quot;Metal Health (Bang Your Head)&quot;. The band is ranked at No. 100 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.

Despite several lineup changes and brief breakups, Quiet Riot continued to record and tour until DuBrow&#x27;s death from a cocaine overdose in 2007. Although there are no original members left in the band, Banali (who had been a member on and off since 1982) reformed Quiet Riot in 2010, and by 2020, it had consisted of himself on drums, lead vocalist Jizzy Pearl, bassist Chuck Wright and guitarist Alex Grossi. The band has continued to record and tour following DuBrow&#x27;s death. In 2014, they released their first album in eight years, titled &quot;Quiet Riot 10&quot;, which was followed by &quot;Road Rage&quot; in 2017 and &quot;Hollywood Cowboys&quot; in 2019. Banali died in August 2020 following a sixteen-month battle with pancreatic cancer. About three weeks after his death, the surviving members of the band announced that they would move forward without Banali, who wished that they continue by keeping the Quiet Riot name alive; he was replaced by Johnny Kelly. In August 2021, Quiet Riot released a statement saying that bassist Rudy Sarzo would be rejoining the band, as well as announcing the departure of Wright. The new lineup plans to release new music and tour throughout 2022 and 2023.

==History==

===Early career, first two albums and first breakup (1973–1981)===

Formed in 1973 by guitarist Randy Rhoads and bassist Kelly Garni, Quiet Riot became one of the more successful hard rock acts in Los Angeles in the mid-to-late 1970s. Originally known as Mach 1, the name was soon changed to Little Women before the name Quiet Riot was finally settled upon in May 1975. The band&#x27;s name was inspired by a quote from Rick Parfitt of the British band Status Quo. Parfitt stated that he thought the name &quot;Quite Right&quot; would make a good band name, and DuBrow amended this to &quot;Quiet Riot&quot;.

Drew Forsyth, who had previously played with Rhoads and Garni in a band called Mildred Pierce, was hired as the new group&#x27;s drummer, and a Los Angeles photographer named Kevin DuBrow was hired as lead vocalist. DuBrow was not at all what Rhoads had in mind for his new band, and he was not well-liked by his Quiet Riot bandmates, a situation that caused a great deal of tension within the band. Rhoads had envisioned a frontman in the vein of Alice Cooper or David Bowie, but Dubrow was persistent and would not take no for an answer. In the end, Rhoads and Garni decided that if nothing else, DuBrow shared their enthusiasm and he was hired.

Rhoads became the focal point of the band, both musically and visually. The &quot;polka-dot theme&quot; he incorporated onstage became Quiet Riot&#x27;s visual signature during their time on the L.A. club circuit, with many fans showing up at the band&#x27;s shows wearing polka-dot bow-ties and vests in emulation of what the guitarist wore on stage. Musically, Rhoads&#x27; talent as a lead guitarist began to spread by word of mouth, and hard rock fans from across Los Angeles began frequenting the band&#x27;s gigs to hear what the fuss was about.

In the 1970s, Quiet Riot developed a friendly but intense rivalry with Van Halen before either act had signed a record deal. While Van Halen signed to Warner Bros. in 1977 and released a debut album that would achieve Gold certification, Quiet Riot&#x27;s contract with Sony would see their first two albums released only in Japan, albums that to this day have never been released in the US. The band recorded their debut album &quot;Quiet Riot&quot;, or &quot;QR I&quot;, in 1977.

Coupled with their inability to secure an American recording deal, tensions between vocalist DuBrow and bassist Garni began to tear the band apart. According to Garni, &quot;I was on a constant quest to get him out of the band and get a different singer. I hated him, he hated me and we could not find any way whatsoever to get along which caused a lot of tension in the band and it put a lot of stress on Randy to try to be neutral.&quot; Their second album &quot;Quiet Riot II&quot;, or &quot;QR II&quot;, was recorded at The Record Plant and released in Japan in 1978.

As &quot;Quiet Riot II&quot; was being recorded, the relationship between Garni and DuBrow finally reached its breaking point. After robbing a bar the previous night and stealing liquor, a drunken Garni unsuccessfully attempted to convince Rhoads to replace the vocalist. Garni drunkenly fired a handgun through the ceiling and a fistfight between him and Rhoads ensued. Garni then hatched a plan to drive across town to the Record Plant and kill DuBrow, who was there recording vocals for &quot;Quiet Riot II&quot;. Garni was arrested for drunk driving before he reached the studio, and the plan to kill his bandmate waned after he sobered up. Nonetheless, Garni&#x27;s time in Quiet Riot came to a swift end. Future Mötley Crüe founder Nikki Sixx auditioned to replace Garni, but Sixx &quot;didn&#x27;t know the names of the notes and couldn&#x27;t play the instrument&quot; at that point, according to DuBrow. Rudy Sarzo, an acquaintance of DuBrow&#x27;s, was hired and was pictured and credited on the album &quot;QR II&quot;, though it was actually Garni who performed on the album. Though he downplayed the inner conflict within the band, DuBrow would confess years later that this period of the band&#x27;s existence had been extremely frustrating: &quot;We had one of the best guitar players ever in our band and we couldn&#x27;t get arrested!&quot;

By 1979, Rhoads began to tire of the turmoil within Quiet Riot as well as their failure to sign a US recording deal. Late that year he auditioned for Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s band upon the urging of future Slaughter bassist Dana Strum. Osbourne said he was immediately blown away by the guitarist&#x27;s talent and hired him immediately. Shortly thereafter, bassist Rudy Sarzo followed Rhoads to Osbourne&#x27;s band and Quiet Riot&#x27;s future seemed very much in doubt. As Quiet Riot was expected to disband at this point, Rhoads incorporated many riffs and fragments of early Quiet Riot material into the new material he was working on with Osbourne. According to Sarzo &quot;a lot of the Quiet Riot songs ended up on the [Osbourne] albums under different titles. Obviously Randy thought we&#x27;d never use those songs again so he&#x27;d give the riffs to Ozzy who&#x27;d come up with new words.&quot; For example, the main riff of the Osbourne song &quot;Suicide Solution&quot; originated as a secondary riff during the verse of a Quiet Riot demo recording entitled &quot;Force of Habit&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;juke/ref&quot;&gt;Juke Magazine October 22, 1983 - &quot;America Calling&quot; section featuring Quiet Riot by Tamara Handii, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to DuBrow, Rhoads&#x27; departure from Quiet Riot in 1979 appeared to be the end of the line, saying that the loss &quot;didn&#x27;t derail the band, it ended it.&quot; He and Forsyth attempted to carry on under the Quiet Riot name for a short time with the addition of guitarist Greg Leon before the band officially broke up in 1980. Leon was very succinct when asked why his time in Quiet Riot was so brief, saying &quot;Kevin DuBrow was impossible to work with.&quot; Following the demise of Quiet Riot, Dubrow recruited former Gamma drummer Skip Gillette and played shows in the L.A club circuit for approximately two years under the band name DuBrow.

===Rebirth and &quot;Metal Health&quot; success (1982–1984)===
In early 1982, having recruited drummer Frankie Banali, bassist Chuck Wright, and guitarist Carlos Cavazo, DuBrow contacted Rhoads to ask if he had any objections to him reviving the name Quiet Riot for his new band. Rhoads gave him his blessing but said he wanted to check with Rudy Sarzo first. Sarzo had no objections, and Quiet Riot was thus reborn after a two-year hiatus. Rhoads died in a plane crash while on tour with Osbourne in March 1982, and Sarzo subsequently left Osbourne&#x27;s band a few months later, having a difficult time coping with the grief of losing his close friend and bandmate. The reformed Quiet Riot was recording a new song called &quot;Thunderbird&quot; as a tribute to Rhoads, and DuBrow called Sarzo to ask if he&#x27;d like to participate in the recording. The lineup of DuBrow, Sarzo, Cavazo, and Banali had so much fun recording the track that they wound up recording more than half of the new album in the process. Bassist Wright had already been briefly replaced by Gary Van Dyke (Hollywood Stars, Virgin), but the arrangement was not working out and Sarzo was subsequently welcomed back to Quiet Riot as a full time member. Coming so soon after Rhoads&#x27; death, there was some question over the appropriateness of the new band using the Quiet Riot name. Rhoads&#x27; mother Delores encouraged the band, and in the end it was decided that &quot;although Randy wouldn&#x27;t be in it, the original spirit of the band was back,&quot; according to Sarzo.

In September 1982, with help from producer Spencer Proffer, Quiet Riot finally signed a US recording contract with CBS Records and the album &quot;Metal Health&quot; was released on March 11, 1983. The group&#x27;s landmark single &quot;Cum On Feel the Noize&quot; was released on August 27, 1983. A cover of a 1973 song by Slade, the single spent two weeks at No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in November 1983 and made history as the first heavy metal song to ever crack the Hot 100. The success of the single was instrumental in ushering in a new era of unparalleled success for heavy metal music in the 1980s and helped carry the album &quot;Metal Health&quot; to the top of &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart, making it the first American heavy metal debut album to reach No. 1 in the United States. On November 26, 1983, Quiet Riot became the first heavy metal band to have a top 5 hit and No. 1 album in the same week. Their success was aided in no small part by the &quot;Cum On Feel the Noize&quot; video&#x27;s heavy rotation on MTV. Exposure in the popular film &quot;Footloose&quot; helped spark airplay of the title track. &quot;Metal Health&quot; displaced The Police&#x27;s &quot;Synchronicity&quot; at No. 1 and stayed there for just a week until Lionel Richie&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Slow Down&quot; took over the No. 1 spot.

&quot;Metal Health&quot;&#x27;s title track charted in early 1984 and peaked at No. 31. The song was placed at No. 41 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs&quot;. The album &quot;Metal Health&quot; would ultimately sell over six million copies in the US.

In support of &quot;Metal Health&quot;, Quiet Riot toured North America as the opening act for ZZ Top on their Eliminator Tour for selected dates in June, July and September 1983, and Black Sabbath on their &quot;Born Again&quot; tour from October 1983 through March 1984.

===Steady decline and DuBrow&#x27;s firing (1984–1989)===
The group&#x27;s follow-up, &quot;Condition Critical&quot;, was released on July 27, 1984. Though successful, it was a relative critical and commercial disappointment, selling 1 million units and reaching only No. 15 on the Billboard album chart. This release included another Slade cover &quot;Mama Weer All Crazee Now&quot;, which was released as a single alongside a video that was played in heavy rotation on MTV. Frustrated over the album&#x27;s failure to duplicate the success of its predecessor, DuBrow began expressing his opinion in the heavy metal press that many bands in the Los Angeles metal scene owed their success to what he saw as the doors opened for them by Quiet Riot. At one point, he even compared his band to the Beatles. DuBrow&#x27;s verbal assaults angered many of Quiet Riot&#x27;s musical contemporaries and alienated fans.

DuBrow&#x27;s tirades led to fan backlash and clashes in the media with several other Los Angeles-based metal bands, which resulted in Rudy Sarzo quitting the group in March 1985. After auditions, Kjel Benner was brought in to complete previously booked South American tour dates in April 1985. Despite any lingering hard feelings between DuBrow and Sarzo, the bassist briefly rejoined his former bandmates in May 1985 for the Hear &#x27;n Aid sessions, a charity project headed by Ronnie James Dio to raise money for African famine relief. Sarzo resurfaced with former Ozzy Osbourne bandmate Tommy Aldridge two years later in Whitesnake, touring in support of the band&#x27;s hugely successful self-titled 1987 album. Sarzo was permanently replaced in Quiet Riot by a reinstated Chuck Wright, after five years&#x27; absence from the band. and the group temporarily added keyboardist John Purdell for their 1986 tour. That year, the album &quot;QR III&quot; was released and became another commercial disappointment.

Fed up with DuBrow&#x27;s antics and pressure from the band&#x27;s management and record label, the rest of Quiet Riot fired DuBrow from his own band in February 1987 and replaced him with former Rough Cutt vocalist Paul Shortino, leaving no original members in the band. Chuck Wright left the band shortly thereafter, and Sarzo was invited to return. Sarzo agreed, and while technically back in the band and even featured in some press photos for this brief liaison, he was also committed to Whitesnake at the time and could not continue onward. The group then recruited Sean McNabb for the bassist slot. The revamped band released their second self-titled album, &quot;Quiet Riot&quot; (also known as &quot;QR IV&quot;), in October 1988. The album failed to return the band to its commercial glory. In April 1989, the band members went their separate ways. A show from their final tour was shot in Japan and was archived by Frankie Banali who retained the copyright of the video production master through his Red Samurai Music Production Company and later collaborated with Jack Edward Sawyers in 2004 to create a DVD released for the titled &quot;&#x27;89 Live in Japan&quot;. Frankie Banali resurfaced on the W.A.S.P. album &quot;The Headless Children&quot;, and played some shows with Faster Pussycat. Sean McNabb joined House of Lords in 1991, where he replaced Chuck Wright, the bass player whom he had also replaced in Quiet Riot. Kevin DuBrow subsequently fought in court to keep control of the band&#x27;s name.

===Reformation and &quot;Metal Health&quot; lineup reunion (1990–2003)===
Having won the rights to the band&#x27;s name, DuBrow teamed up with 21-year-old English born blues guitarist Sean Manning, bassist Kenny Hillery, and drummer Pat Ashby to reform Quiet Riot. Initially using the moniker Little Women (a name Rhoads and DuBrow used in the 1970s before settling on Quiet Riot) on tour to avoid any adverse publicity, DuBrow and Manning compiled songs for a new album, which would eventually turn up on the July 1993 release &quot;Terrified&quot;. The band played venues throughout the United States until 1990 when Manning left to join the band Hurricane.
By the early 1990s tempers had cooled between former bandmates Carlos Cavazo and Kevin DuBrow, and they started to communicate again. They eventually formed the band Heat in 1991 with bassist Kenny Hillery and drummer Bobby Rondinelli. This foursome reverted to the name Quiet Riot the following year, and released the aforementioned &quot;Terrified&quot; in 1993 with Banali rejoining on drums after Bobby Rondinelli joined Black Sabbath. Chuck Wright then rejoined on bass for a 1994 tour in support of &quot;Terrified&quot;.

That same year, DuBrow released &quot;The Randy Rhoads Years&quot;, a compilation featuring remixed tracks from Quiet Riot&#x27;s two Japan-only releases along with previously unreleased material, many of which featured newly recorded vocals. The band released the album &quot;Down to the Bone&quot; in March 1995 and a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album in February 1996. &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; covered only material from the CBS years, including three tracks from the 1988 album with Shortino and two previously promo-only live tracks. Former bassist Kenny Hillery, who had left the group in 1994, committed suicide on June 5, 1996.

Rudy Sarzo rejoined the band again in January 1997, reuniting the &quot;Metal Health&quot; lineup. During a tour that year, one angry fan sued DuBrow for injuries she claimed were sustained during a show. In March 1999 the band released the album &quot;Alive and Well&quot;, which featured new songs and several re-recorded hits. The same lineup released the album &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot; in May 2001. In August 2002, former vocalist Shortino filled in for DuBrow for three concerts when DuBrow became ill with the flu.

In September 2002, the band teamed up with director Jack Edward Sawyers to shoot a concert video at the Key Club in Los Angeles. The live DVD, &quot;Live in the 21st Century&quot;, was released November 11, 2003. Quiet Riot officially broke up again in September 2003.

===Second reformation and death of DuBrow (2004–2007)===
Kevin DuBrow released his first solo album, &quot;In for the Kill&quot;, in May 2004, which was followed by the announcement of a Quiet Riot reunion in October 2004. This reunion lineup included Kevin DuBrow, Frankie Banali, Chuck Wright, and new guitarist Alex Grossi. The band was featured on the 2005 Rock Never Stops Tour along with Cinderella, Ratt, and FireHouse. In December 2005, guitarist Tracii Guns of L.A. Guns briefly joined Quiet Riot. Guns left less than a month later after one rehearsal due to musical differences.

Wright and Grossi left the band in early 2006. During this period Quiet Riot also included guitarists Billy Morris and Neil Citron, and bassists Sean McNabb and Wayne Carver. During 2006, Quiet Riot worked on a new studio album that was expected to be released in either 2006 or 2007. The band stated that they had set no timetable for the release of the album, that they were financing the project themselves, and that it would be released when they saw fit and on their terms. Ex-The Firm and Blue Murder bassist Tony Franklin worked with the band in the studio. Quiet Riot released the album &quot;Rehab&quot;, featuring a lineup of DuBrow, Banali, Franklin, and Neil Citron, on October 3, 2006. Former Deep Purple bassist and singer Glenn Hughes made a guest vocal appearance on the album. By the end of 2006, Wright and Grossi were back in the band and toured in support of the album. In 2007, Quiet Riot were featured in radio promos for ESPN Radio, parodying their status as outdated rock n&#x27; roll icons, with commentary from DuBrow and Banali.

On November 25, 2007, Kevin DuBrow was found dead in his Las Vegas apartment. Frankie Banali confirmed the death in an e-mail to Spain&#x27;s &quot;The Metal Circus&quot;. Banali wrote:
Please respect my privacy as I mourn the passing and honor the memory of my dearest friend Kevin DuBrow.

Original Quiet Riot bassist Kelly Garni, who had been fired from the band after hatching a plan to kill the vocalist in 1978, urged fans to be patient and not offer any speculation until authorities ruled on the cause of death. Recognizing the negativity DuBrow&#x27;s behavior had created among fans over the years, Garni asked fans to, for the sake of family and friends, resist any urge to be critical:
I ask this to all of you not only for myself but for other friends and family. I ask that no one here offer any speculation or opinions, theories or other things that could be construed as negative or, and I&#x27;m sorry for this, even sympathetic, right at this immediate time. I am already, within hours of this, having to deal with untrue rumors and speculation and that only adds fuel to that. There is a tendency for the subject of Kevin to incite flames on every board, and now is not the time for that. I will explain to everyone here the facts and the truth in the next 24 to 48 hours as I realize this will affect us all. So please, until then, be patient. All details and other pertinent info will be passed on to you here when it becomes available to me.

On December 10, 2007, media reports confirmed that DuBrow was pronounced dead on November 25, 2007, and was later determined to have died of a cocaine overdose approximately six days earlier. On January 14, 2008, Banali issued the following statement via his website regarding the future of Quiet Riot:
I have been approached to see if I would be interested in contacting Rudy Sarzo and Carlos Cavazo and to audition singers for Quiet Riot. I have also been approached to see if I would be interested in contacting and reforming the version of Quiet Riot that included Paul Shortino, Carlos Cavazo and Sean McNabb. Let me make this very simple and perfectly clear. While I am still actively involved in the business interests of Quiet Riot and will continue in that capacity, I reject any and all suggestions to have Quiet Riot continue as a live performing entity. My friendship, love and respect for Kevin DuBrow as well as my personal love and affection for Kevin&#x27;s mother and his family makes it inconceivable for me to ever entertain any ovation to reform or to continue Quiet Riot. Kevin was too important to go on without him. It would also be a disrespect to the fans who have supported Quiet Riot for nearly 25 years. I thank everyone for the wonderful and sometimes unpredictable adventure that I was able to share as a member of Quiet Riot. The only regret that I have is the loss of Kevin. May he rest in peace. I now begin life after Quiet Riot.

===Revival with multiple vocalists and death of Banali (2010–2020)===
Despite his previous insistence that Quiet Riot could never return as a live performing entity, Banali announced a new version of Quiet Riot in September 2010 with himself on drums, Chuck Wright on bass, Alex Grossi on guitar, and newcomer Mark Huff (formerly of the Van Halen tribute band 5150) on vocals. The band has sought the blessings of the DuBrow family, and DuBrow&#x27;s mother encouraged Banali to revive the band. In July 2011, this lineup toured Germany as support for Slayer and Accept.

On January 12, 2012, while Huff was awaiting brain surgery, Quiet Riot released a statement, announcing that they had parted ways with Huff, and they were replacing him for upcoming dates with Keith St. John (formerly of Montrose). Huff found out about his firing online. In March 2012, Banali hired unknown vocalist Scott Vokoun to fully replace Huff.

Original bassist and founding member Kelly Garni released his long-awaited autobiography in October 2012. The book covers the beginnings and early years of Quiet Riot, as well as details of Garni&#x27;s friendship with founder Randy Rhoads.

In November 2013, it was announced that Scott Vokoun had amicably parted ways with Quiet Riot, and that his replacement was Love/Hate vocalist Jizzy Pearl, who played his first show with the band on December 31 in Flagstaff, Arizona. The band then were reported to be in the recording studio working on a new studio album which was set for release some time in 2014.

In December 2013, Frankie Banali was interviewed by &quot;Loudwire&quot;, during which he discussed the future of Quiet Riot as well as their upcoming album. He revealed that the album would feature six new songs recorded in the studio, with former bassist Rudy Sarzo and &quot;Rehab&quot; session bassist Tony Franklin playing on two songs each, as well as four live songs taken from Kevin DuBrow&#x27;s final professionally recorded shows with the band in 2007. Banali said of the song choices:
I made a conscious decision not to use the usual songs that people would expect. I picked tracks that were special and of the moment. Let&#x27;s just say that there will be a familiar track, two unexpected choices and one that really shows the roots of Quiet Riot and how the band interacted in the live arena. I think that Quiet Riot fans will really appreciate my choices.

A Quiet Riot documentary movie, titled &quot;Well Now You&#x27;re Here, There&#x27;s No Way Back&quot; (named after a lyric in the band&#x27;s hit song &quot;Bang Your Head (Metal Health)&quot;) and directed and produced by Banali&#x27;s fiancee Regina Russell, was completed around this time. It premiered at the Newport Beach Film Festival on April 29, 2014. In June 2014, the band released their new album, titled &quot;10&quot;, their first studio release in eight years and their first since their most recent reformation.

Vocalist Jizzy Pearl departed the band at the end of 2016 to concentrate on his solo career, and was replaced by former Adler&#x27;s Appetite and Icon vocalist Seann Nicols, formerly known as Sheldon Tarsha. On February 13, 2017, the band announced that they would release a new album &quot;Road Rage&quot; on April 21. However, in March, it was announced that Nicols had left the band and that James Durbin was the new singer. The band subsequently announced that &quot;Road Rage&quot; would be delayed until summer 2017 so that all of Nicols&#x27; vocals could be replaced by Durbin&#x27;s with new lyrics and melodies. It was then announced that the new version of the album would be released on August 4 by Frontiers Music Srl.

Banali was forced to sit out several Quiet Riot shows throughout 2019 as he was receiving treatment for stage-IV pancreatic cancer, though he did not reveal his diagnosis until October of that year. He was replaced by either former Type O Negative drummer Johnny Kelly or former W.A.S.P. drummer Mike Dupke depending on each drummer&#x27;s availability. In September 2019, Durbin quit the band to &quot;follow his own path&quot; according to Banali, and Pearl was rehired as the lead vocalist. Two months later, Quiet Riot&#x27;s fourteenth studio album, and second and last to feature Durbin, &quot;Hollywood Cowboys&quot;, was released.

On August 20, 2020, Banali died from pancreatic cancer, which he had been diagnosed with sixteen months earlier, leaving him as the second member of the &quot;Metal Health&quot;-era lineup to die, following DuBrow in 2007.

===Johnny Kelly replaces Frankie Banali and return of Rudy Sarzo (2020–present)===
On September 9, 2020, Quiet Riot announced on their Facebook page that would continue on without Banali, who had wished that they keep the music and legacy of the band alive. He was replaced by Johnny Kelly, who had filled in for Banali on the band&#x27;s 2019 and 2020 tours. The band embarked on their first tour since Banali&#x27;s passing in the summer of 2021, and announced, in May of that year, that they were going to release new music in 2022.

On August 2, 2021, Quiet Riot announced that former bassist Rudy Sarzo would rejoin the band in early 2022, once again replacing Chuck Wright. However, Sarzo played his first show with the band in nearly two decades at The Groove Music Hall in Woodford, Virginia on November 6, 2021. In December 2021, Sarzo confirmed that new music from Quiet Riot will be released to coincide with their upcoming 2022 tour: &quot;We have a couple of surprises coming up that are already recorded. So they&#x27;re just waiting to be released. We&#x27;re gonna release &#x27;em in conjunction when we start touring in February [of 2022].&quot; That same month, he revealed that plans were being made to celebrate the 40th anniversary of &quot;Metal Health&quot; in 2023.

==Musical style==
Quiet Riot&#x27;s music has been described as heavy metal, glam metal, and hard rock.

==Legacy==
Quiet Riot&#x27;s &quot;Metal Health&quot; appears as the title theme to the video game &quot;&quot; as well as on the soundtrack to &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories&quot; and as a playable song in the games &quot;Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Rock Band Blitz&quot;, while &quot;Cum On Feel the Noize&quot; is featured in &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;. &quot;The Wild and the Young&quot; is in the soundtrack to &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;.

Ben Folds&#x27; 2001 song &quot;Rockin&#x27; the Suburbs&quot; mentions the band in the lines &quot;I&#x27;m rockin&#x27; the suburbs, just like Quiet Riot did. I&#x27;m rockin&#x27; the suburbs, except that they were talented.&quot; In the 2005 album &quot;Punk Goes 80&#x27;s&quot;, Relient K covered The Bangles&#x27; song &quot;Manic Monday&quot; and changed two original lines to read &quot;He says to me in his Quiet Riot voice: &quot;C&#x27;mon feel the noise.&quot; On the Weezer track &quot;Heart Songs&quot; from their self-titled &quot;Red&quot; album, one line goes: &quot;Quiet Riot got me started with the banging of my head.&quot;

In the 2005 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; titled &quot;The Father, the Son, and the Holy Guest Star&quot;, the band is jokingly depicted as converted to a religious band called &quot;Pious Riot&quot; and plays a parody of the song &quot;Cum On Feel the Noize&quot; as &quot;Come on Feel the Lord&quot;.

&quot;Metal Health&quot; also appeared on the &quot;Crank&quot; soundtrack, as the song played during the film&#x27;s opening sequence, as well as in scenes for the films &quot;Footloose&quot; and &quot;The Wrestler&quot;. &quot;Cum On Feel the Noize&quot; is featured in the musical &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; and in the end credits of its 2012 film adaptation.

Professional wrestler Necro Butcher uses &quot;Metal Health&quot; as his entrance theme in Wrecking Ball Wrestling.

<text>In topology and related branches of mathematics, a T1 space is a topological space in which, for every pair of distinct points, each has a neighborhood not containing the other point. An R0 space is one in which this holds for every pair of topologically distinguishable points. The properties T1 and R0 are examples of separation axioms.

==Definitions==
Let &quot;X&quot; be a topological space and let &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; be points in &quot;X&quot;. We say that &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are if each lies in a neighbourhood that does not contain the other point.
* &quot;X&quot; is called a T1 space if any two distinct points in &quot;X&quot; are separated.
* &quot;X&quot; is called an R0 space if any two topologically distinguishable points in &quot;X&quot; are separated.

A T1 space is also called an accessible space or a space with Fréchet topology and an R0 space is also called a symmetric space. (The term also has an entirely different meaning in functional analysis. For this reason, the term &quot;T1 space&quot; is preferred. There is also a notion of a Fréchet–Urysohn space as a type of sequential space. The term also has another meaning.)

A topological space is a T1 space if and only if it is both an R0 space and a Kolmogorov (or T0) space (i.e., a space in which distinct points are topologically distinguishable). A topological space is an R0 space if and only if its Kolmogorov quotient is a T1 space.

==Properties==

If formula_1 is a topological space then the following conditions are equivalent:

#formula_1 is a T1 space.
#formula_1 is a T0 space and an R0 space.
#Points are closed in formula_1; that is, for every point formula_5 the singleton set formula_6 is a closed subset of formula_7
#Every subset of formula_1 is the intersection of all the open sets containing it.
#Every finite set is closed.
#Every cofinite set of formula_1 is open.
#For every formula_5 the fixed ultrafilter at formula_11 converges only to formula_12
#For every subset formula_13 of formula_1 and every point formula_5 formula_11 is a limit point of formula_13 if and only if every open neighbourhood of formula_11 contains infinitely many points of formula_19
#Each map from the Sierpiński space to formula_1 is trivial.
# The map from the Sierpiński space to the single point has the lifting property with respect to the map from formula_1 to the single point. 

If formula_1 is a topological space then the following conditions are equivalent: (where formula_23 denotes the closure of formula_6)

#formula_1 is an R0 space.
#Given any formula_5 the closure of formula_6 contains only the points that are topologically indistinguishable from formula_12
#The Kolmogorov quotient of formula_1 is T1.
#For any formula_30 formula_11 is in the closure of formula_32 if and only if formula_33 is in the closure of formula_34
#The specialization preorder on formula_1 is symmetric (and therefore an equivalence relation).
#The sets formula_23 for formula_37 form a partition of formula_1 (that is, any two such sets are either identical or disjoint).
#If formula_39 is a closed set and formula_11 is a point not in formula_39, then formula_42
#Every neighbourhood of a point formula_37 contains formula_44
#Every open set is a union of closed sets.
#For every formula_5 the fixed ultrafilter at formula_11 converges only to the points that are topologically indistinguishable from formula_12

In any topological space we have, as properties of any two points, the following implications

: formula_48 formula_48 

If the first arrow can be reversed the space is R0. If the second arrow can be reversed the space is T0. If the composite arrow can be reversed the space is T1. A space is T1 if and only if it is both R0 and T0.

A finite T1 space is necessarily discrete (since every set is closed).

A space that is locally T1, in the sense that each point has a T1 neighbourhood (when given the subspace topology), is also T1. Similarly, a space that is locally R0 is also R0. In contrast, the corresponding statement does not hold for T2 spaces. For example, the line with two origins is not a Hausdorff space but is locally Hausdorff.

== Examples ==
* Sierpiński space is a simple example of a topology that is T0 but is not T1, and hence also not R0.
* The overlapping interval topology is a simple example of a topology that is T0 but is not T1.
* Every weakly Hausdorff space is T1 but the converse is not true in general. 
* The cofinite topology on an infinite set is a simple example of a topology that is T1 but is not Hausdorff (T2). This follows since no two nonempty open sets of the cofinite topology are disjoint. Specifically, let formula_1 be the set of integers, and define the open sets formula_51 to be those subsets of formula_1 that contain all but a finite subset formula_53 of formula_7 Then given distinct integers formula_11 and formula_33:
:* the open set formula_57 contains formula_33 but not formula_59 and the open set formula_60 contains formula_11 and not formula_33;
:* equivalently, every singleton set formula_63 is the complement of the open set formula_64 so it is a closed set;
:so the resulting space is T1 by each of the definitions above. This space is not T2, because the intersection of any two open sets formula_51 and formula_66 is formula_67 which is never empty. Alternatively, the set of even integers is compact but not closed, which would be impossible in a Hausdorff space.

* The above example can be modified slightly to create the double-pointed cofinite topology, which is an example of an R0 space that is neither T1 nor R1. Let formula_1 be the set of integers again, and using the definition of formula_51 from the previous example, define a subbase of open sets formula_70 for any integer formula_11 to be formula_72 if formula_11 is an even number, and formula_74 if formula_11 is odd. Then the basis of the topology are given by finite intersections of the subbasic sets: given a finite set formula_76the open sets of formula_1 are

::formula_78

:The resulting space is not T0 (and hence not T1), because the points formula_11 and formula_80 (for formula_11 even) are topologically indistinguishable; but otherwise it is essentially equivalent to the previous example.

* The Zariski topology on an algebraic variety (over an algebraically closed field) is T1. To see this, note that the singleton containing a point with local coordinates formula_82 is the zero set of the polynomials formula_83 Thus, the point is closed. However, this example is well known as a space that is not Hausdorff (T2). The Zariski topology is essentially an example of a cofinite topology.
* The Zariski topology on a commutative ring (that is, the prime spectrum of a ring) is T0 but not, in general, T1. To see this, note that the closure of a one-point set is the set of all prime ideals that contain the point (and thus the topology is T0). However, this closure is a maximal ideal, and the only closed points are the maximal ideals, and are thus not contained in any of the open sets of the topology, and thus the space does not satisfy axiom T1. To be clear about this example: the Zariski topology for a commutative ring formula_53 is given as follows: the topological space is the set formula_1 of all prime ideals of formula_86 The base of the topology is given by the open sets formula_87 of prime ideals that do contain formula_88 It is straightforward to verify that this indeed forms the basis: so formula_89 and formula_90 and formula_91 The closed sets of the Zariski topology are the sets of prime ideals that contain formula_92 Notice how this example differs subtly from the cofinite topology example, above: the points in the topology are not closed, in general, whereas in a T1 space, points are always closed.
* Every totally disconnected space is T1, since every point is a connected component and therefore closed.

==Generalisations to other kinds of spaces==
The terms &quot;T1&quot;, &quot;R0&quot;, and their synonyms can also be applied to such variations of topological spaces as uniform spaces, Cauchy spaces, and convergence spaces.
The characteristic that unites the concept in all of these examples is that limits of fixed ultrafilters (or constant nets) are unique (for T1 spaces) or unique up to topological indistinguishability (for R0 spaces).

As it turns out, uniform spaces, and more generally Cauchy spaces, are always R0, so the T1 condition in these cases reduces to the T0 condition.
But R0 alone can be an interesting condition on other sorts of convergence spaces, such as pretopological spaces.

<text>George Woodcock (May 8, 1912 – January 28, 1995) was a Canadian writer of political biography and history, an anarchist thinker, a philosopher, an essayist and literary critic. He was also a poet and published several volumes of travel writing. In 1959 he was the founding editor of the journal &quot;Canadian Literature&quot; which was the first academic journal specifically dedicated to Canadian writing. He is most commonly known outside Canada for his book &quot;Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements&quot; (1962).

==Life==
Woodcock was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, but moved with his parents to England at an early age, attending Sir William Borlase&#x27;s Grammar School in Marlow and Morley College. Though his family was quite poor, his grandfather offered to pay his tuition if he went to Cambridge University which he turned down due to the condition that he undertake seminary training for the Anglican clergy. Instead, he took a job as a clerk at the Great Western Railway and it was there that he first became interested in anarchism.

Woodcock remained an anarchist for the rest of his life, writing several books on the subject, including &quot;Anarchism&quot;, the anthology &quot;The Anarchist Reader&quot; (1977), and biographies of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, William Godwin, Oscar Wilde and Peter Kropotkin. It was during these years that he met several prominent literary figures, including T. S. Eliot and Aldous Huxley, and forging a particularly close relationship with the art theorist Herbert Read. His first published work was &quot;The White Island&quot;, a collection of poetry, which was issued by Fortune Press in 1940.

Woodcock spent World War II working as a conscientious objector on a farm in Essex, and in 1949, moved to British Columbia. &quot;As a proponent of civil disobedience in accordance with Henry David Thoreau, he followed the principles of Leo Tolstoy, M.K. Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. As a pacifist, he dismissed the &quot;folly&quot; of revolutionary violence while emphasizing the need for the convergence of ends and means to prevent a new authoritarianism.&quot;

At Camp Angel in Oregon, a camp for conscientious objectors, Woodcock helped found of the Untide Press, which sought to bring poetry to the public in an inexpensive but attractive format. Following the war, he returned to Canada, eventually settling in Vancouver, British Columbia. In 1955, he took a post in the English department of the University of British Columbia, where he stayed until the 1970s. Around this time he started to write more prolifically, producing several travel books and collections of poetry, as well as the works on anarchism for which he is best known in collaboration with Ivan Avakumović.

Toward the end of his life, Woodcock became increasingly interested in what he saw as the plight of Tibetans. He traveled to India, studied Buddhism, became friends with the Dalai Lama and established the Tibetan Refugee Aid Society. With Inge, his wife, he established Canada India Village Aid, which sponsors self-help projects in rural India. Both organizations exemplify his ideal of voluntary cooperation between people across national boundaries.

The Woodcocks established the Woodcock Fund to support professional Canadian writers. Since 1989, it provides financial assistance to writers in mid-book-project who face unforeseen financial needs that threaten the completion of their books. it is available to writers of fiction, creative non-fiction, plays, and poetry. The initial endowment of the program was in excess of two million dollars, is administered by the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada and by March 2012 had distributed $887,273 to 180 Canadian writers.

George Woodcock died at his home in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on January 28, 1995.

==Orwell==
Woodcock first came to know George Orwell after they had a public disagreement in the pages of the &quot;Partisan Review&quot;. In his &quot;London Letter&quot; published in the March–April 1942 issue of the review, Orwell had written that in the context of a war against fascism, pacifism was &quot;objectively pro-fascist&quot;. As the founder and editor of &quot;Now&quot;, an &quot;anti-war paper&quot; which Orwell had mentioned in his article as an example of publications that published contributions by both pacifists and fascists, Woodcock took exception to this. Woodcock stated that &quot;the review had abandoned its position as an independent forum&quot;, and was now &quot;the cultural review of the British Anarchist movement&quot;. Despite this difference, the two became good friends and kept up a correspondence until Orwell&#x27;s death, and &quot;Now&quot; would publish Orwell&#x27;s article &quot;How the Poor Die&quot; in its November 6, 1946 issue.

Woodcock and Orwell would both also be active members of the Freedom Defence Committee.

Woodcock later wrote &quot;The Crystal Spirit&quot; (1966), a critical study of Orwell and his work which won a Governor General&#x27;s Award. The title is taken from the last line of the poem written by Orwell in memory of the Italian militiaman he met in Barcelona in December 1936 during the Spanish Civil War, a meeting Orwell describes in the opening lines to &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot; (1938).

==Recognition==
Woodcock was honoured with several awards, including a Fellowship of the Royal Society of Canada in 1968, the UBC Medal for Popular Biography in 1973 and 1976, and the Molson Prize in 1973. In 1970, he received an honorary doctorate from Sir George Williams University, which later became Concordia University. He only accepted awards from his peers, refusing several offered by the state, including the Order of Canada. He made one exception in 1994, receiving the Freedom of the City of Vancouver.

A biography, &quot;The Gentle Anarchist: A Life of George Woodcock&quot;, was released in 1998 by George Fetherling, and a documentary, &quot;George Woodcock: Anarchist of Cherry Street&quot;, by Tom Shandel and Alan Twigg.
