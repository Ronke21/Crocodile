==A==

===Afghanistan===
From Classical Persian افغان‎ (&quot;afğān&quot;, &quot;Afghan&quot;), from Bactrian αβαγανο (&quot;abagano&quot;), first attested in the fourth century CE, most likely a compound of &quot;*apāka-&quot; (&quot;distant, faraway&quot;), from Proto-Iranian &quot;*Hapá&quot;, from Proto-Indo-Iranian &quot;*Hapá&quot; (&quot;away&quot;), from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*h₂epó&quot; + &quot;*-āna&quot; (&quot;ethnic group&quot;), from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*-nós&quot;, thus: &quot;people from a distant land&quot;. Various scholars have proposed Sanskrit etymologies since the nineteenth century (especially prior to the 2007 publication of earlier Bactrian attestations for the word), but linguist Johnny Cheung notes that these are &quot;extremely difficult to reconcile&quot; with recent evidence pointing to a Bactrian source.

===Albania===

:&quot;Land of the Albanians&quot;, Latinized from Byzantine Greek &quot;Albanía&quot; (Αλβανία), land of the rebel &quot;Albanoi&quot; (Αλβανοι) mentioned in Michael Attaliates &quot;The History&quot; around AD 1080. In her &quot;Alexiad&quot;, Anna Comnena also mentions a settlement called Albanon or Arbanon. Both may be survivals of the earlier Illyrian tribe, the &quot;Albani&quot; of the Albanopolis northeast of modern Durrës which appears in Ptolemy around AD 150. The demonym has been supposed to ultimately originate from Latin (&quot;white&quot;) or from the proposed Proto-Indo-European *&quot;alb&quot; (&quot;hill&quot;) or *&quot;alb-&quot; (&quot;white&quot;).
::Arbëri, its medieval endonym: &quot;Land of the Albanians&quot; in Albanian, presumably from the same source as above by way of rhotacism. An &quot;Arbanitai&quot; were mentioned in Attaliates&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; as subjects of the Duke of Dyrrachium, near modern Durrës.
::Arnavutluk, its Ottoman Turkish name: &quot;Land of the Albanians&quot;, a metathesis from Byzantine Greek &quot;Arbanitai&quot; and the Turkish locative suffix &quot;-lik&quot; or &quot;-luk&quot;.
::Shqipëri, its modern endonym: &quot;Land of the Understanding&quot;, from the Albanian adverb &quot;shqip&quot;, &quot;understanding each other&quot;. A popular pseudoetymology (&quot;Land of the Eagles&quot;) erroneously derives it instead from (&quot;eagle&quot;).

===Algeria===

:&quot;Land of Algiers&quot;, a Latinization of French colonial name &quot;l&#x27;Algérie&quot; adopted in 1839. The city&#x27;s name derives from French &quot;Alger&quot;, itself from Catalan &quot;Aldjère&quot;, from the Ottoman Turkish &quot;Cezayir&quot; and Arabic &quot;al-Jazāʼir&quot; (, &quot;the Islands&quot;). This was a truncated form of the city&#x27;s older name, &quot;Jazā&#x27;ir Banī Māzġānna&quot; (, &quot;Islands of the sons of Mazġannā&quot;), which referred to four islands off the city&#x27;s coast which were held by a local Sanhaja tribe. (These islands joined the mainland in 1525.) An alternate theory traces the Arabic further back to a transcription of the Berber &quot;Ldzayer&quot; in reference to Ziri ibn Manad, founder of the Zirid dynasty, whose son Buluggin ibn Ziri resettled the city. In Berber, &quot;ziri&quot; means &quot;moonlight&quot;.
::Algiers or Algier, former names: As above.

===Andorra===
:Etymology unknown. Andorra was established as part of Charlemagne&#x27;s &quot;Marca Hispanica&quot; and its name may derive from Arabic &quot;ad-Darra&quot; (, &quot;the Forest&quot;) or Navarro-Aragonese &quot;andurrial&quot; (&quot;scrubland&quot;). One folk etymology holds that it derives from the Biblical Endor, a name bestowed by Louis le Debonnaire after defeating the Moors in the &quot;wild valleys of Hell&quot;.

===Angola===

:&quot;Land of Ndongo&quot;, from the Portuguese colonial name (&quot;Reino de Angola&quot;), which erroneously derived a toponym from the Mbundu title &quot;ngola a kiluanje&quot; (&quot;conquering &quot;ngola&quot;&quot;, a priestly title originally denoting a &quot;chief smith&quot;, then eventually &quot;king&quot;) held by Ndambi a Ngola () as lord of Ndongo, a state in the highlands between the Kwanza and Lukala Rivers.

===Antigua and Barbuda===
:Antigua: &quot;Ancient&quot;, corrected from earlier &quot;Antego&quot;, a truncation of the Spanish &quot;Santa Maria la Antigua&quot;, bestowed in 1493 by Christopher Columbus in honor of the Virgen de la Antigua (&quot;Virgin of the Old Cathedral&quot;), a revered mid-14th-century icon in the Chapel of La Antigua in Seville Cathedral.
:Barbuda: &quot;Bearded&quot; in Spanish, corrected from earlier &quot;Barbado&quot;, &quot;Berbuda&quot;, &quot;Barbouthos&quot;, &amp;c. This may derive from the appearance of the island&#x27;s fig trees or from the beards of the indigenous people.

===Argentina===

:The first description of the region by the word &quot;Argentina&quot; has been found on a Venetian map in 1536. The name &quot;Argentina&quot; comes from Italian. &quot;Argentina&quot; (masculine &quot;argentino&quot;) means in Italian &quot;(made) of silver, silver coloured&quot;, derived from the Latin &quot;argentum&quot; for silver. &quot;La Argentina&quot; (&quot;the silvery&quot;), a 17th-century truncation of &quot;Tierra Argentina&quot; (&quot;Land beside the Silvery River&quot;, &quot;Silvery Land&quot;), named via (either in Italian or poetic Spanish) in reference to the Río de la Plata, so called by Italian explorer Sebastian Cabot during his expedition there in the 1520s after acquiring some silver trinkets from the Guaraní along the Paraná near modern-day Asunción, Paraguay.

===Armenia===

:Etymology unknown. Latinized from Greek &quot;Armenía&quot; (), &quot;Land of the &quot;Armenioi&quot;&quot; () attested in the 5th century BC, from Old Persian &quot;Armina&quot; ( ) attested in the late 6th century BC, of uncertain origin.
:It may be a continuation of the Assyrian &quot;Armânum&quot; which was conquered by Naram-Sin in 2200 BC and has been identified with an Akkadian colony in the Diarbekr region. The name has also been claimed as a variant of the &quot;Urmani&quot; or &quot;Urmenu&quot; appearing in an inscription of Menuas of Urartu, as a proposed tribe of the Hayasa-Azzi known as the &quot;Armens&quot; (, &quot;Armenner&quot;) or as a continuation of the Biblical &quot;Minni&quot; () and Assyrian &quot;Minnai&quot;, corresponding to the Mannai. (Addition of the Sumerogram ḪAR would make this name equivalent to &quot;the mountainous region of the Minni&quot;.) Diakonoff derived the name from a proposed Urartian and Aramaic amalgam &quot;*Armnaia&quot; (&quot;inhabitant of Arme&quot; or &quot;Urme&quot;), a region held by Proto-Armenians in the Sason mountains. Ultimately, the name has been connected to the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*ar-&quot; (&quot;assemble&quot;, &quot;create&quot;) also found in the word &quot;Ararat&quot;, &quot;Aryan&quot;, &quot;Arta&quot;, &amp;c.
:The Armenians traditionally traced the name to an eponymous ancestor Aram (), sometimes equated with Arame, the earliest known king of Urartu. Strabo derived the etymology from an Armenius of Armenium, a city on Lake Boebeïs in Thessaly, while Herodotus called them Phrygian colonists.
::Hayastan, the local endonym: Etymology unknown. The modern Armenian &quot;Hayastan&quot; () derives from earlier Armenian &quot;Hayk&quot; () and Persian &quot;-stān&quot; (). &quot;Hayk&quot;&#x27; derives from Old Armenian &quot;Haykʿ&quot; (), traditionally derived from a legendary patriarch named Hayk (). Aram above was considered to be one of his descendants.

===Australia===

:&quot;Southern Land&quot; in Neo-Latin, adapted from the legendary pseudo-geographical &quot;Terra Australis Incognita&quot; (&quot;Unknown Southern Land&quot;) dating back to the Roman era. First appearing as a corruption of the Spanish name for an island in Vanuatu in 1625, &quot;Australia&quot; was slowly popularized following the advocacy of the British explorer Matthew Flinders in his 1814 description of his circumnavigation of the island. Lachlan Macquarie, a Governor of New South Wales, used the word in his dispatches to England and recommended it be formally adopted by the Colonial Office in 1817. The Admiralty agreed seven years later and the continent became officially known as Australia in 1824. In Flinders&#x27; book he published his rationale:
::&quot;There is no probability, that any other detached body of land, of nearly equal extent, will ever be found in a more southern latitude; the name Terra Australis will, therefore, remain descriptive of the geographical importance of this country, and of its situation on the globe: it has antiquity to recommend it; and, having no reference to either of the two claiming nations, appears to be less objectionable than any other which could have been selected.&quot;
::(Antarctica, the hypothesized land for which the name &quot;Terra Australis&quot; originally referred to, was sighted in 1820, and not explored until decades after Flinders&#x27; book had popularized this shift of the name.)
::Oz, a colloquial endonym: Likely a contraction from above. Folk etymology traces the name to the 1939 film, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, but the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; records the first occurrence as &quot;Oss&quot; in 1908. Frank Baum&#x27;s original book predates this and may have inspired the name, but it is also possible Baum himself was influenced by Australia in his development of Oz.
::Nova Hollandia, a former name: &quot;New Holland&quot; in Neo-Latin (), after the Dutch province, bestowed by the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman in 1644. For the further etymology of Holland, see the Netherlands below.

===Austria===

:&quot;Eastern March&quot;, Latinized as early as 1147 from German &quot;Österreich&quot;, from Old High German &quot;Ostarrîchi&quot; (996) or &quot;Osterrîche&quot; (998), from Medieval Latin &quot;Marchia Orientalis&quot;, an eastern prefecture for the Duchy of Bavaria established in 976.

===Azerbaijan===

:&quot;Land of Atropates&quot;, an Achaemenid then Hellenistic-era king over a region in present-day Iranian Azarbaijan and Iranian Kurdistan, south of the modern state. &quot;Azerbaijan&quot; derives from Persian &quot;Āzarbāydjān&quot;, from earlier &quot;Ādharbāyagān&quot; and &quot;Ādharbādhagān&quot;, from Middle Persian &quot;Āturpātākān&quot;, from Old Persian &quot;Atropatkan&quot;. (The name is often derived from the Greek &quot;Atropatene&quot; (), &quot;Atropátios Mēdía&quot; (), or &quot;Tropatēnē&quot; (), although these were exonyms and Atropatkan was never thoroughly Hellenized.) Atropatkan was a renaming of the Achaemenian XVIII Satrapy of Eastern Armenia, comprising Matiene and the surrounding Urartians and Saspirians, upon Aturpat&#x27;s declaration of independence from the Diadochi Seleucus following the death of Alexander the Great. Aturpat&#x27;s own name (Old Persian: ; , ) is the Old Persian for &quot;protected by &quot;atar&quot;&quot;, the holy fire of Zoroastrianism.
::Albania, a former name: From the Latin , from the Greek (), related to the Old Armenian &quot;Ałuankʿ&quot; (). The native Lezgic name(s) for the country is unknown, but Strabo reported its people to have 26 different languages and to have only been recently unified in his time. It is often referenced as &quot;Caucasian Albania&quot; in modern scholarship to distinguish it from the European country above.
::Arran, a former name: From the Middle Persian &quot;Arran&quot;, from Parthian &quot;Ardhan&quot;, derived via rhotacism from earlier names as above.

==B==

===Bahamas===

:&quot;Large upper middle island&quot;, from the Lucayan name &#x27; used by the indigenous Taíno people for the island of Grand Bahama. Tourist guides often state that the name comes the Spanish &#x27; (&#x27;shallow sea&#x27;), in reference to the reef-filled Bahama Banks.

===Bahrain===

:&quot;The Two Seas&quot; in Arabic (, ). However, the question of which two seas were originally intended remains in dispute. A popular folk etymology relates Bahrain to the &quot;two seas&quot; mentioned five times in the Quran. The passages, however, do not refer to the modern island but rather to the Saudi deserts opposite modern Bahrain. It is possible Bahrain (previously known as Awal) simply acquired its name when that region became known as al-Hasa, but today the name is generally taken to refer to the island itself. The two seas are then the bay east and west of the island, the seas north and south of the island, or the salt water surrounding the island and the fresh water beneath it which appears in wells and also bubbling up at places in the middle of the gulf. An alternate theory offered by al-Ahsa was that the two seas were the Great Green Ocean and a peaceful lake on the mainland; still another provided by al-Jawahari is that the original formal name &quot;Bahri&quot; (lit. &quot;belonging to the sea&quot;) would have been misunderstood and so was opted against.

===Bangladesh===

The etymology of &quot;Bangladesh&quot; (Country of Bengal) can be traced to the early 20th century, when Bengali patriotic songs, such as &quot;Namo Namo Namo Bangladesh Momo&quot; by Kazi Nazrul Islam and &quot;Aaji Bangladesher Hridoy&quot; by Rabindranath Tagore, used the term. The term &quot;Bangladesh&quot; was often written as two words, &quot;Bangla Desh&quot;, in the past. Starting in the 1950s, Bengali nationalists used the term in political rallies in East Pakistan.

The exact origin of the word &quot;Bangla&quot; is unknown, though it is believed to come from &quot;Vanga&quot;, an ancient kingdom mentioned in world&#x27;s largest Epic Mahabharat even Ramayan and geopolitical division on the Ganges delta in the Indian subcontinent. It was located in southern Bengal, with the core region including present-day southern West Bengal (India) and southwestern Bangladesh. The suffix &quot;al&quot; came to be added to it from the fact that the ancient rajas of this land raised mounds of earth 10 feet high and 20 in breadth in lowlands at the foot of the hills which were called &quot;al&quot;. From this suffix added to the Bung, the name Bengal arose and gained currency&quot;. Support to this view is found in Ghulam Husain Salim&#x27;s Riyaz-us-Salatin.

Other theories point to a Bronze Age proto-Dravidian tribe, the Austric word &quot;Bonga&quot; (Sun god), and the Iron Age Vanga Kingdom. The Indo-Aryan suffix &quot;Desh&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;deśha&quot;, which means &quot;land&quot; or &quot;country&quot;. Hence, the name &quot;Bangladesh&quot; means &quot;Land of Bengal&quot; or &quot;Country of Bengal&quot;.Sanskrit language influenced the name of Bangladesh. The term Vanga was used in the Sanskrit texts.

The term &quot;Bangla&quot; denotes both the Bengal region and the Bengali language. The earliest known usage of the term is the Nesari plate in 805 AD. The term &quot;Vangaladesa&quot; is found in 11th-century South Indian records. The term gained official status during the Sultanate of Bengal in the 14th century. Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah proclaimed himself as the first &quot;Shah of Bangala&quot; in 1342. The word &quot;Bangla&quot; became the most common name for the region during the Islamic period. The Portuguese referred to the region as &quot;Bengala&quot; in the 16th century.

===Barbados===

:&quot;Bearded ones&quot;, from the Portuguese &quot;As Barbadas&quot;, corrected from earlier &quot;Barbata&quot;, &quot;Barbuda&quot;, &quot;S. Barduda&quot;, &quot;Barbadoes&quot;, &amp;c. First attested by a 1519 map done by the Genoese cartographer Visconte Maggiolo. As with Barbuda, the name may derive from the appearance of the island&#x27;s fig trees or from the beards of the indigenous people. (Isaac Taylor was of the opinion that Barbuda was named for its men, Barbados for its figs.)

===Belarus===

:&quot;White Russia&quot;, a compound of the Belarusian &quot;bel-&quot; (-, &quot;white&quot;) and &quot;Rus&quot; (, &quot;Rus&#x27;&quot;) adopted in 1991. The meaning is &quot;Russian&quot; in the cultural and historic (, &quot;ruskʺ&quot;; Old Belarusian: , &quot;ruski&quot;; , &quot;russkiy&quot;) but &quot;not&quot; national sense (, &quot;rossiyánin&quot;), a distinction sometimes made by translating the name as &quot;White Ruthenia&quot;, although &quot;Ruthenian&quot; has other meanings as well. The name is first attested in the 13th century as German &quot;Weissrussland&quot; and Latin &quot;Russia Alba&quot;, first in reference to Russia&#x27;s White and then Black Sea coasts. The exonym was next applied to Great Novgorod and then Muscovy after its conquest of that region, finally being applied to its present region in the late 16th century to describe ethnically Russian regions being conquered from Poland. This last change was politically motivated, with Russia employing the foreign term to justify its revanchism at Poland&#x27;s expense. The original meaning of &quot;white&quot; in Belarus&#x27;s name is unknown. It may simply have arisen from confusion with legends concerning Caucasian Albania or from a use of colors to distinguish cardinal directions as seen in &quot;Red Russia&quot;. Other theories include its use to distinguish Belarus as &quot;free&quot; or &quot;pure&quot;, particularly of Mongolian control, or to distinguish the region from &quot;Black Russia&quot;, a region of productive soil. For the further etymology of &quot;Rus&quot;, see Russia below.
::Belorussia or Byelorussia, a former name: &quot;White Russia&quot; in Russian (, &quot;Belorussiya&quot;), truncated from the White Russian Soviet Socialist Republic (, &quot;Belorússkaya Sovétskaya Sotsalistícheskaya Respúblika&quot;) declared in 1919.
::White Russia, a former name: a translation of the above.

===Belgium===

:&quot;Land of the Belgae&quot;, from the Roman province of &quot;Gallia Belgica&quot; (&quot;Belgic Gaul&quot;) derived from the Latinized name of a Celtic tribe. The present Kingdom of Belgium adopted the name upon its independence from the Netherlands in 1830 based on the French-language name of Henri Van der Noot&#x27;s brief-lived United States of Belgium () which had declared its independence from Austria in 1790. The tribe&#x27;s exact endonym remains unknown, but the name &quot;Belgae&quot; is usually traced to the proposed Proto-Celtic root &quot;*belg-&quot; from the Proto-Indo-European &quot;*bhelgh-&quot;, both meaning &quot;to bulge&quot; or &quot;to swell&quot; (particularly with anger) and cognate with the Old English &quot;belgan&quot;, &quot;to be angry&quot;. An alternate etymology takes it from a proposed Proto-Indo-European root meaning &quot;dazzling&quot; or &quot;bright&quot;

===Belize===

:Etymology unknown. Traditionally derived from a Spanish transcription of &quot;Wallace&quot;, a Scottish buccaneer who established an eponymous settlement (on Spanish maps, &quot;Valize&quot; and &quot;Balize&quot;) along the Belize River (which he also named after himself) in the early 17th century. Alternatively taken from the Mayan word &quot;beliz&quot; (&quot;muddy water&quot;), presumably in reference to the river, or from Kongolese Africans who brought the name with them from Cabinda. Adopted in 1973 while still a self-governing colony of the United Kingdom.
:A previous folk etymology took it from the French (&quot;beacon&quot;).
::British Honduras, a former name: See Honduras and Great Britain below.

===Benin===

:&quot;[Land beside] the Bight of Benin&quot;, the stretch of the Gulf of Guinea west of the Niger delta, a purposefully neutral name chosen to replace Dahomey (see below) in 1975. The Bight itself is named after a city and a kingdom in present-day Nigeria having no relation to the modern Benin. The English name comes from a Portuguese transcription (&quot;Benin&quot;) of a local corruption (&quot;Bini&quot;) of the Itsekiri form (&quot;Ubinu&quot;) of the Yoruba &quot;Ile-Ibinu&quot; (&quot;Home of Vexation&quot;), a name bestowed on the Edo capital by the irate Ife oba Oranyan in the 12th century.
:An alternate theory derives &quot;Bini&quot; from the Arabic (, &quot;sons&quot; or &quot;tribe&quot;).
::&quot;Dahomey&quot; or Dahomy, a former name: &quot;Belly of Dã&quot; in Fon (&quot;Dã Homè&quot;), from the palace of the ahosu Akaba, traditionally built over the entrails of a local ruler. In Fon, the name &quot;Dã&quot; or &quot;Dan&quot; can also mean &quot;snake&quot; or the snake-god Damballa. Upon the restoration of independence, the name was deemed no longer appropriate since the historic kingdom comprised only the southern regions and ethnicities of the modern state.
::&quot;Abomey&quot;, a former name: &quot;Ramparts&quot; in Fon (&quot;Agbomè&quot;), from the palace of the ahosu Houegbadja.

===Bhutan===
:Etymology unknown. Names similar to Bhutanincluding &quot;Bottanthis&quot;, &quot;Bottan&quot;, &quot;Bottanter&quot;began to appear in Europe around the 1580s. Jean-Baptiste Tavernier&#x27;s 1676 &quot;Six Voyages&quot; is the first to record the name &quot;Boutan&quot;. However, in every case, these seem to have been describing not modern Bhutan but the Kingdom of Tibet. The modern distinction between the two did not begin until well into George Bogle&#x27;s 1774 expeditionrealizing the differences between the two regions, cultures, and states, his final report to the East India Company formally proposed labeling the Druk Desi&#x27;s kingdom as &quot;Boutan&quot; and the Panchen Lama&#x27;s as &quot;Tibet&quot;. Subsequently, the EIC&#x27;s surveyor general James Rennell first anglicized the French name as Bootan and then popularized the distinction between it and greater Tibet. The name is traditionally taken to be a transcription of the Sanskrit &quot;Bhoṭa-anta&quot; (, &quot;end of Tibet&quot;), in reference to Bhutan&#x27;s position as the southern extremity of the Tibetan plateau and culture. &quot;Bhutan&quot; may have been truncated from this or been taken from the Nepali name &quot;Bhutān&quot; (भूटान). It may also come from a truncation of &quot;Bodo Hathan&quot; (&quot;Tibetan place&quot;). All of these ultimately derive from the Tibetan endonym &quot;Bod&quot;. An alternate theory derives it from the Sanskrit &quot;Bhu-Utthan&quot; (, &quot;highlands&quot;).
::Druk Yul, the local endonym: &quot;Land of the Thunder Dragon&quot; in Bhutanese (འབྲུག་ཡུལ་). Variations of this were known and used as early as 1730. The first time a Kingdom of Bhutan separate from Tibet did appear on a western map, it did so under its local name as &quot;Broukpa&quot;.

===Bolivia===

:&quot;Land of Bolívar&quot; in Neo-Latin, in honor of Simón Bolívar, one of the leading generals in the Spanish American wars of independence. Bolívar had given his lieutenant Antonio José de Sucre the option to keep Upper Peru under Peru, to unite it with the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, or to declare its independence. A national assembly opted for independence, then sought to placate Bolívar&#x27;s doubts by naming Bolívar as the first president of a country named in his honor. The original name &quot;Republic of Bolívar&quot; was swiftly changed to Bolivia at the urging of the congressman Manuel Martín Cruz.
:Bolívar&#x27;s own name derives from the village of Bolibar in Spanish Biscay. Its name comes from the Basque &quot;bolu&quot; (&quot;windmill&quot;) and &quot;ibar&quot; (&quot;valley&quot;).

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===

:Bosnia: &quot;Land of the river Bosna&quot; in Latin, first attested in the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII&#x27;s 958 &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot;. (The 12th-century Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja also mentions an 8th-century source for the name which, however, has not survived.) &quot;Bosna&quot; was the medieval name of the classical Latin &quot;Bossina&quot;. Anton Mayer proposed a connection with the proposed Proto-Indo-European roots &quot;*bos&quot; or &quot;*bogh&quot; (&quot;running water&quot;). Certain Roman sources similarly mention &quot;Bathinus flumen&quot; as a name of the Illyrian &quot;Bosona&quot;, both of which would mean &quot;running water&quot; as well. Other theories involve the rare Latin &quot;Bosina&quot; (&quot;boundary&quot;) or possible Slavic origins.
:Herzegovina: &quot;Duchy&quot; or &quot;Dukedom&quot;, an amalgam of German &quot;Herzog&quot; (&quot;duke&quot;) and the Bosnian (&quot;-land&quot;). The duke was Stjepan Vukčić, Grand Voivode of Bosnia, who proclaimed himself &quot;Duke of Hum and the Coast&quot; and then either proclaimed himself or was bestowed the title &quot;Duke of Saint Sava of Serbia&quot; by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III around 1448. The Ottoman sanjak formed in the area after its 1482 conquest was simply called &quot;Hersek&quot;, but the longer Bosnian form was adopted by Austria and English.

===Botswana===
:&quot;Country of the Tswana&quot; in Setswana, after the country&#x27;s dominant ethnic group. The etymology of &quot;Tswana&quot; is uncertain. Livingstone derived it from the Setswana &quot;tshwana&quot; (&quot;alike&quot;, &quot;equal&quot;), others from a word for &quot;free&quot;. However, other early sources suggest that while the Tswana adopted the name, it was an exonym they learned from the Germans and British.
:*&quot;Bechuanaland&quot;, a former name: from &quot;Bechuana&quot;, an alternate spelling of &quot;Botswana&quot;.

===Brazil===
:brazilwood, from the Portuguese &quot;Terra do Brasil&quot;, from the tree &quot;pau-brasil&quot; (&quot;brazilwood&quot;, lit. &quot;wood of ember&quot;, &quot;wood in ember&quot;), a name derived from its similarity to red-hot embers (). The name may have been a translation of the Tupi &quot;ibirapitanga&quot;, also meaning &quot;red-wood&quot;. The ending &quot;-il&quot; derives from the diminutive Latin suffix &quot;-ilus&quot;.
:The appearance of islands named &quot;Bracile&quot;, &quot;Hy-Brazil&quot;, or &quot;Ilha da Brasil&quot; on maps as early as the c. 1330 portolan chart of Angelino Dulcert sometimes leads etymologists to question the standard etymology. While most of these islands of Brazil are found off the coast of Ireland and may be taken to stem from a Celtic rendering of the legendary Isle of the Blessed, the 1351 Medici Atlas places one Brazil near Ireland and a second one off the Azores near Terceira Island. That use may derive from its four volcanoes or reference its dragon&#x27;s blood, a red resin dye. Regardless, the initial names of present-day Brazil were &quot;Ilha de Vera Cruz&quot; (&quot;Island of the True Cross&quot;) and thenafter it was discovered to be a new mainland&quot;Terra de Santa Cruz&quot; (&quot;Land of the Holy Cross&quot;); this only changed after a Lisbon-based merchant consortium led by Fernão de Loronha leased the new colony for massive exploitation of the costly dyewood which had previously been available only from India.
::Pindorama, a former name: &quot;Land of the Palm Trees&quot; in Guarani, the language of the Guarani people of Paraguay and southwest Brazil.

===Britain===
:&quot;See the United Kingdom below.&quot;

===Brunei===

* Full name of Brunei is Brunei Darussalam, Darussalam is in Arabic which mean the Abode of Peace.
*:Etymology unknown. Modern folk etymology derives the name Brunei from a Malay exclamation &quot;Barunah!&quot; (&quot;There!&quot;), supposedly exclaimed by Awang Alak Betatar, the legendary 14th-century sultan, upon landing on Borneo or upon moving from Garang to the Brunei river delta. An earlier folk etymology traced it to his alleged membership in an Arabian tribe called the Buranun. Chinese sources recording a mission from the king of &quot;Boni&quot; (, &quot;Bóní&quot;) as early as 978 and a later &quot;P&#x27;o-li&quot; (, &quot;Pólì&quot;) seem to contradict these but may refer to Borneo as a whole. It is mentioned in the 15th-century history of Java as a country conquered by Adaya Mingrat, general of Angka Wijaya, and around 1550 by the Italian Ludovico di Varthema under the name &quot;island of Bornei&quot;. Other derivations include an Indian word for &quot;seafarers&quot; (from , &quot;varunai&quot;), another for &quot;land&quot; (from Sanskrit: &quot;bhumi&quot;), or the Kelabit for the Limbang River. It is also said that the word &#x27;Brunei&#x27; is said to have come from the Sanskrit word &quot;Bhūrṇi&quot; (भूर्णि) which means &quot;land&quot; or &quot;earth&quot; and Brunei could have been called &quot;Karpūradvīpa&quot; (कर्पूरद्वीप) which means &quot;camphor island&quot; as camphor was one export Brunei was well known for in ancient times.

===Bulgaria===

:From the Bulgars, the extinct tribe of Turkic origin, which created the country. Their name is possibly derived from the Proto-Turkic word &quot;bulģha&quot; (&quot;to mix&quot;, &quot;shake&quot;, &quot;stir&quot;) and its derivative &quot;bulgak&quot; (&quot;revolt&quot;, &quot;disorder&quot;) Alternate etymologies include derivation from a Mongolic cognate &quot;bulğarak&quot; (&quot;to separate&quot;, &quot;split off&quot;) or from a compound of proto-Turkic &quot;bel&quot; (&quot;five&quot;) and &quot;gur&quot; (&quot;arrow&quot; in the sense of &quot;tribe&quot;), a proposed division within the Utigurs or Onogurs (&quot;ten tribes&quot;).
:Within Bulgaria, some historians question the identification of the Bulgars as a Turkic tribe, citing certain linguistic evidence (such as Asparukh&#x27;s name) in favor of a North Iranian or Pamiri origin.

===Burkina Faso===
:&quot;Land of Honest Men&quot;, from an amalgam of More &quot;burkina&quot; (&quot;honest&quot;, &quot;upright&quot;, or &quot;incorruptible men&quot;) and Dioula &quot;faso&quot; (&quot;homeland&quot;; literally &quot;father&#x27;s house&quot;), selected by President Thomas Sankara following his 1983 coup to replace Upper Volta.
::Upper Volta, a former name: &quot;Land of the Upper Volta River&quot;, whose main tributaries originate in the country. The Volta itself (, &quot;turn&quot;) was named by Portuguese gold traders exploring the region.

===Burma===
: Named for the Burmans, the nation&#x27;s largest ethnic group, a correction of 18th-century &quot;Bermah&quot; and &quot;Birma&quot;, from Portuguese &quot;Birmania&quot;, probably from &quot;Barma&quot; in various Indian languages, ultimately from Burmese &quot;Bama&quot; (), a colloquial oral version of the literary &quot;Myanma&quot; (), the eventual pronunciation of the Old Burmese &quot;Mranma&quot;, first attested in an 1102 Mon inscription as &quot;Mirma&quot;, of uncertain etymology. It was not until the mid-19th century that King Mindon referred to his position as &quot;king of the Myanma people&quot;, as it was only during the Konbaung Dynasty that Burmans fully displaced the Mon within the Irrawaddy valley.
:The Indian name is alternatively derived from &quot;Brahmadesh&quot; (), &quot;land of Brahma&quot;. A folk etymology of &quot;Myanma&quot; derives it from &quot;myan&quot; (&quot;fast&quot;) and &quot;mar&quot; (&quot;tough&quot;, &quot;strong&quot;).
::Myanmar, the present endonym: As above. The terminal &quot;r&quot; included in the official English translation arose from the nation&#x27;s status as a former British colony and reflects non-rhotic accents such as Oxford English.

===Burundi===
:&quot;Land of the Ikirundi speakers&quot; in Ikirundi, adopted upon independence from Belgian-occupied Rwanda-Urundi in 1962.

==C==

===Cambodia===

:&quot;Land of the Kambojas&quot;. Latinized from French &quot;Cambodge&quot; via an intermediate Khmer form &quot;Kampuchea&quot;, from Sanskrit &quot;Kambujadeśa&quot; (). The AD 947 Baksei Chamkrong inscription explains (and probably invented) the Sanskrit name from &quot;Kambu&quot;, a legendary Indian sage who journeyed to Indochina and married a naga princess named Mera, plus (&quot;-ja&quot;) meaning &quot;descendants of&quot;. In informal usage Cambodians refer to their country as Srok Khmer, &quot;Land of the Khmers&quot;.

===Cameroon===
:&quot;Shrimp&quot;, from the singular French &quot;Cameroun&quot; derived from the German &quot;Kamerun&quot;, from the anglicized &quot;Cameroons&quot; derived from the Portuguese &#x27; &#x27; (&quot;Shrimp River&quot;) bestowed in 1472 on account of a massive swarm of the Wouri River&#x27;s ghost shrimp.
::&quot;Kamerun&quot;, a former name: The German name for their colony there between 1884 and the end of World War I, as above. Formerly also known simply as German Cameroon.
::&quot;Cameroun&quot;, a former name: The French name for their colony there between World War I and 1960, as above. Formerly also known simply as French Cameroons.

===Canada===
: A prominent theory is that the word Canada means &quot;Village&quot;, from Iroquoian &quot;Kanada&quot;, adopted for the entire Canadian Confederation in 1867, from name of the British Province of Canada formed by the 1841 reunification of Upper and Lower Canada, previously established by a division of Quebec, the British renaming of the French territory of Canada. French Canada had received its name when its administrators adopted the name used by the explorer Jacques Cartier to refer to St. Lawrence River and the territory along it belonging to the Iroquoian chief Donnacona. In 1535, he had misunderstood the Laurentian &quot;Kanada&quot; as the name of Donnacona&#x27;s capital Stadacona.
:Another popular theory is that it folk etymology derived the name from Spanish or Portuguese &quot;acá&quot; or &quot;cá nada&quot; (&quot;nothing here&quot;) in reference to the region&#x27;s lack of gold or silver.
::Quebec, a former name: &quot;Where the river narrows&quot;, from Algonquin &quot;kébec&quot; via French, in reference to the St. Lawrence River near modern Quebec City. Samuel de Champlain chose the name in 1608 for the new town there, which gave its name to a section of French Canada and then the British province of Quebec, which eventually became modern Canada and even briefly included the entire Ohio River valley between the enactment of the Quebec Act in 1774 and the surrender of the region to the United States in 1783. (Modern Quebec was formed from Canada East during the Canadian Confederation in 1867.)

===Cabo Verde===
:&quot;Green Cape&quot;, from the Portuguese &quot;Cabo Verde&quot;, from its position across from the mainland cape of that name since its discovery in 1444. The cape is located beside Gorée Island in the modern nation of Senegal and is now known by its French form &quot;Cap-Vert&quot;. 

===Central African Republic===

===Chad===
:&quot;Lake&quot;, from Lake Chad in the country&#x27;s southwest, whose name derives from the Kanuri &quot;tsade&quot; (&quot;lake&quot;).

===Chile===

:Etymology unknown. The name dates to the &quot;men of Chilli&quot;, the survivors of the first Spanish expedition into the region in 1535 under Diego de Almagro. Almagro applied the name to the Mapocho valley, but its further etymology is debated. The 17th-century Spanish chronicler Diego de Rosales derived it from the Quechua &quot;Chili&quot;, a toponym for the Aconcagua valley, which he considered a corruption of Tili, the name of a Picunche chief who ruled the area at the time of its conquest by the Inca. Modern theories derive it from the similarly named Incan settlement and valley of &quot;Chili&quot; in Peru&#x27;s Casma Valley, the Quechua &quot;chiri&quot; (&quot;cold&quot;), the Aymara &quot;tchili&quot; (&quot;snow&quot; or &quot;depths&quot;), the Mapuche &quot;chilli&quot; (&quot;where the land ends&quot; or &quot;runs out&quot;), or the Mapuche &quot;cheele-cheele&quot; (&quot;yellow-winged blackbird&quot;).
:A folk etymology attributes the name to chili peppers, sometimes via the Mexican Spanish &quot;chile&quot; (&quot;chili&quot;), but the two are almost certainly unrelated.

===China===
:Derived from Middle Persian &quot;Chīnī&quot; , derived from Sanskrit &quot;Cīnāh&quot; (). Often said that the word &quot;China&quot; and its related terms are derived from the Qin state which existed on the furthest west of China proper since the 9th century BC, and which later unified China to form the Qin dynasty (, Old Chinese: &quot;*dzin&quot;). This is still the most commonly held theory, although many other suggestions have been mooted. The existence of the word &quot;Cīna&quot; in ancient Hindu texts was noted by the Sanskrit scholar Hermann Jacobi who pointed out its use in the work &quot;Arthashastra&quot; with reference to silk and woven cloth produced by the country of &quot;Cīna&quot;. The word is also found in other texts including the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; and the &quot;Laws of Manu&quot;. The Indologist Patrick Olivelle however argued that the word &quot;Cīnā&quot; may not have been known in India before the first century BC, nevertheless he agreed that it probably referred to Qin but thought that the word itself was derived from a Central Asian language. Some Chinese and Indian scholars argued for the state of Jing (荆) as the likely origin of the name. Another suggestion, made by Geoff Wade, is that the &quot;Cīnāh&quot; in Sanskrit texts refers to an ancient kingdom centered in present-day Guizhou, called Yelang, in the south Tibeto-Burman highlands. The inhabitants referred to themselves as &quot;Zina&quot; according to Wade. The word in Europe is first recorded in 1516 in the journal of Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa. The word is first recorded in English in a translation published in 1555.

::Cathay, a former &amp; literary name: &quot;Khitai&quot;, from Marco Polo&#x27;s Italian &quot;Catai&quot;, used for northern but not southern China, ultimately from the Khitan endonym &quot;Kitai Gur&quot; (&quot;Kingdom of the Khitai&quot;), possibly via Persian &quot;Khitan&quot; () or Chinese &quot;Qìdān&quot; ().
::Seres and Serica, former names: &quot;Land of Silk&quot; in Greek (Σηρες, &quot;Sēres&quot;) and Latin, respectively. The further etymology is typically derived from the &quot;Chinese&quot; for silk (), but the modern correspondence belies the Old Chinese pronunciation &quot;*sə&quot;.
::Zhongguo or Chung-kuo (), the most common endonym: originally meaning &quot;Central Demesne&quot;, then &quot;Middle Kingdom&quot;, now equivalent to &quot;Central Nation&quot;.
::(For many other endonyms, see Names of China.)

===Colombia===

:&quot;Land of Columbus&quot; in Spanish, adopted in 1863 in honor of the earlier Gran Colombia formed by Simón Bolívar in 1819 after a proposal of Francisco de Miranda for a single pan–Hispanic American state.
::Cundinamarca, a former name: &quot;Condor&#x27;s Nest&quot; in Quechua phono-semantically matched with the Spanish &quot;marca&quot; (&quot;march&quot;), adopted upon independence from Spain in 1810 on the erroneous assumption it had been the indigenous Chibcha name for the native kingdom around Bogotá and the Magdalena Valley.
::New Granada, a former name: Self-descriptive, from the earlier Spanish Viceroyalty of New Granada, named after the region of Province of Granada in Spain. Adopted in 1835 following the secession of Venezuela and Ecuador from Gran Colombia. For further etymology of &quot;Granada&quot;, see Grenada below.

===Republic of the Congo===
:&quot;[Land beside] the Congo River&quot;, adopted by the country upon independence in 1960 from the previous French autonomous colony Republic of the Congo () established in 1958, ultimately from the name of the original French colony French Congo () established in 1882. The river itself derived its name from Kongo, a Bantu kingdom which occupied its mouth around the time of its discovery by the Portuguese in 1483 or 1484 and whose name derived from its people, the Bakongo, an endonym said to mean &quot;hunters&quot; (, &quot;nkongo&quot;).
::French Congo, a former name: As above, with the inclusion of its occupier to distinguish it from the Belgian-controlled Congo to its south. For further etymology of &quot;France&quot;, see below.
::Middle Congo, a former name: From its position along the river, a translation of the French &quot;Moyen-Congo&quot;, adopted as the colony&#x27;s name between 1906 and 1958.
::Congo (Brazzaville): As above, with the inclusion of the country&#x27;s capital to distinguish it from Congo (Léopoldville) or (Kinshasa) to its south. Brazzaville itself derives from the colony&#x27;s founder, Pierre Savorgnan de Brazzà, an Italian nobleman whose title referred to the town of Brazzacco, in the comune of Moruzzo, whose name derived from the Latin &quot;Brattius&quot; or &quot;Braccius&quot;, both meaning &quot;arm&quot;.

===Democratic Republic of the Congo===
: As above, adopted upon independence in 1960 as Republic of the Congo ().
::Congo Free State, a former name: As above, a translation of the French &quot;État indépendant du Congo&quot; (&quot;Free State of the Congo&quot;), formed by Leopold II of Belgium in 1885 to administer the holdings of the International Congo Society acknowledged as separate from the country of Belgium at the 1884 Berlin Conference.

::Congo (Léopoldville) and Congo-Léopoldville, former names: As above, with the inclusion of the country&#x27;s capital to distinguish it from Congo (Brazzaville) to its north. This usage was especially common when both countries shared identical official names prior to Congo-Léopoldville&#x27;s adoption of the name &quot;Democratic Republic of the Congo&quot; () in 1964. Léopoldville itself was named for Leopold II of Belgium upon its founding in 1881. Leopold&#x27;s own name derives from Latin &quot;leo&quot; (&quot;lion&quot;) or Old High German &quot;liut&quot; (&quot;people&quot;) and OHG &quot;bald&quot; (&quot;brave&quot;).
::Congo (Kinshasa) and Congo-Kinshasa, alternate names: As above, following the renaming of Léopoldville after the nearby native settlement of Kinshasa or Kinchassa to its east as part of the Mobutist Authenticity movement.
::&quot;Zaire&quot; or Zaïre, a former name: &quot;[Land beside] the Congo River&quot;, a French form of a Portuguese corruption of the Kongo &quot;Nzere&quot; (&quot;river&quot;), a truncation of &quot;Nzadi o Nzere&quot; (&quot;river swallowing rivers&quot;), adopted for the river and the country between 1971 and 1997 as part of the Authenticity movement.

===Costa Rica===
:&quot;Rich Coast&quot; in Spanish, although the origin of the epithet is disputed. Some claim it was bestowed by the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus in 1502 as &quot;Costa del Oro&quot; (&quot;Gold Coast&quot;), others by the Spanish conquistador Gil González Dávila.

===Côte d&#x27;Ivoire===

:&quot;Ivory Coast&quot; in French, from its previous involvement in the ivory trade. Similar names for Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and other nearby countries include the &quot;Grain Coast&quot;, the &quot;Gold Coast&quot;, and the &quot;Slave Coast&quot;.

===Croatia===

:Etymology uncertain. From Medieval Latin &quot;Croātia&quot;, from &quot;Cruati&quot; (&quot;Croatians&quot;) attested in the Šopot Inscription, from North-West Slavic &quot;Xrovat-&quot;, by liquid metathesis from proposed Common Slavic *&quot;Xorvat-&quot;, from proposed Proto-Slavic &quot;*Xarwāt-&quot; (*&quot;Xъrvatъ&quot;) or *&quot;Xŭrvatŭ&quot; (*&quot;xъrvatъ&quot;).
:The most common theory derives it from &quot;Harahvat-&quot;, the Old Persian name for the Arachosia or Helmand River, or from , the land surrounding it. This is cognate with the Vedic Sarasvatī and Avestan &quot;Haraxvaitī&quot;. This derivation seems to be supported by a 3rd-century Scythian form &quot;Xoroathos&quot; (ΧΟΡΟΑΘΟΣ) appearing in the Tanais Tablets.
:Alternate theories include Zbigniew Gołąb&#x27;s proposal that it is a borrowing from Proto-Germanic &quot;*C(h)rovati&quot;, presumed to mean &quot;warriors clad with horn-armor&quot; or &quot;chrawat&quot;, &quot;mountaineers&quot;.

===Cuba===

:Etymology unknown. First bestowed by Christopher Columbus as &quot;Cabo de Cuba&quot; (the modern Punta de Mulas) after a supposed local settlement named &quot;Cuba&quot;, probably from the Taíno &quot;cubao&quot; (&quot;abundant fertile land&quot;) or &quot;coabana&quot; (&quot;great place&quot;).
:Scholars who believe that Christopher Columbus was Portuguese rather than Genovese argue &quot;Cuba&quot; is derived from the town of Cuba near Beja in Portugal.

===Cyprus===

:Etymology unknown. Latinized from the Greek &quot;Kúpros&quot; (Κύπρος), first attested as Mycenaean Greek (&quot;Kupirijo&quot;, &quot;Cypriot&quot;). Possible etymologies include the Greek &quot;kypárissos&quot; (κυπάρισσος, &quot;cypress&quot;) or &quot;kýpros&quot; (κύπρος, &quot;henna&quot;).
:The most common folk etymology derives its name from &quot;copper&quot;, since the island&#x27;s extensive supply gave Greek and Latin words for the metal. Although these words derived from Cyprus rather than the other way around, the name has more recently been derived from an Eteocypriot word for &quot;copper&quot; and even from the Sumerian &quot;zubar&quot; (&quot;copper&quot;) or &quot;kubar&quot; (&quot;bronze&quot;).

===&quot;Czechoslovakia&quot;===

The name &quot;Czech&quot; derives from the archaic Czech endonym &quot;Czech&quot; or &quot;Cžech&quot;, a member of the West Slavic tribe whose Přemyslid dynasty subdued its neighbors in Bohemia around AD 900. Its further etymology is disputed. The traditional etymology derives it from an eponymous leader Čech who led the tribe into Bohemia. Modern theories consider it an obscure derivative, e.g. from &quot;četa&quot;, a medieval military unit.
::Czechia, a less common alternate name: A Latinized version of the Czech endonym &quot;Czechy&quot;.
::Bohemia, a former name: &quot;Land of the Boii&quot;, a Celtic tribe of the region. The ultimate etymology of &quot;Boii&quot; is uncertain, but has been connected to Proto-Indo-European roots meaning &quot;cow&quot; and &quot;warrior&quot;. Now refers only to the area of Bohemia proper.
::Czechy or Čechy, a former endonym: &quot;Land of the Czechs&quot; in archaic Czech. Now typically considered to refer only to the area of Bohemia proper, excluding Moravia and other areas.
::Česko, a current endonym: &quot;Land of the Czechs&quot; in modern Czech. Although it appeared as early as the 18th century, &quot;Česko&quot; remained uncommon enough that most Czechs only associated it with its appearance in the Czech name for Czechoslovakia (&quot;Česko-Slovensko&quot; or &quot;Československo&quot;) so many resisted the use of it following the division of the country. Given the inability to use the former name &quot;Čechy&quot; either. The name &quot;Česko&quot; has got on and it is nowadays commonly used in the Czech language as the short name of Czechia.

===Denmark===

:Etymology uncertain, but probably &quot;The Danish forest&quot; or &quot;march&quot; in reference to the forests of southern Schleswig.

===Djibouti===
:Etymology unknown, named for its eponymous capital Djibouti, founded in 1888 by the French pirate Éloi Pino and the capital of the previous French colonies French Somaliland and Afars &amp; Issas. a French transliteration for &quot;Land of Tehuti&quot;, after the ancient Egyptian moon god.

:&quot;Land of the Aesti&quot;, a correction of earlier &quot;Esthonia&quot;, a re-Latinization of the Old English &quot;Estland&quot;, a development of the Old High German &quot;Aestland&quot;, a combination of the Latin &quot;Aestia&quot; and the German &quot;-land&quot; (&quot;-land&quot;). The name &quot;Aestia&quot; was a combination of the Latin &quot;Aesti&quot; and the locative suffix &quot;-ia&quot;, meaning &quot;Land of the Aesti&quot; (a people first mentioned by Ancient Roman historian Tacitus around 98 AD). Some historians have hypothesized that he was referring to speakers of Baltic languages and, not their then Finnic-speaking neighbours to the north, while others have suggested that the name &quot;Aesti&quot; may have been at earlier times applied to the entire Eastern Baltic region. The Scandinavian sagas&#x27; references to &quot;Eistland&quot; are the earliest known sources using the toponym indisputably for a geographic area overlapping with modern Estonia. The word &quot;Estland/Eistland&quot; has been linked to Old Norse &quot;eist&quot;, &quot;austr&quot; meaning &quot;the east&quot;.

:The Estonian endonym &quot;Eesti&quot; was first attested in writing as &quot;Estimah&quot; in 1638, as a combination of the name &quot;Est-&quot; and the word &quot;-mah&quot; (&quot;land&quot;), which is still used as an alternative name &quot;Eestimaa&quot; in modern Standard Estonian.

===Finland===

:&quot;Land of the Finns&quot;, from the Swedish spelling, first attested in runestones in Old Norse in present-day Sweden. Early mentions of the &quot;Fenni&quot; in Tacitus&#x27;s first-century &quot;Germania&quot; and the &quot;Phinnoi&quot; () in Ptolemy&#x27;s second-century &quot;Geography&quot; are today thought to refer to the modern Sami people. The etymology of &quot;Finn&quot; is uncertain: it may derive from Germanic translations of the Finnish &quot;suo&quot; (&quot;fen&quot;) or from the proposed Proto-Germanic *&quot;finne&quot; &quot;wanderers&quot;, &quot;hunting-folk&quot;.
:Suomi, the endonym and exonym in some other Finnic and Baltic languages: Uncertain etymology. Possibly derived from the proposed proto-Balto-Slavic &quot;*zeme&quot; &quot;land&quot; or from the Finnish &quot;suomaa&quot; (&quot;fen land&quot;).

===France===

:&quot;Land of the Franks&quot;, Anglicized from Late Latin &quot;Francia&quot;, from Old Frankish &quot;Franko&quot;. The name &quot;Frank&quot; itself has been derived from the historic &quot;framea&quot; (&quot;javelin&quot;), proposed Proto-Germanic *&quot;frankon&quot; (&quot;spear&quot;, &quot;javelin&quot;),although the characteristic weapons of the Franks were the sword and the Frankish axeand from the Proto-Germanic *&quot;frankisc&quot; (&quot;free&quot;) from &quot;*frank&quot; (&quot;free&quot;)although they were not masters until after their conquest of Gaul.
::&quot;Gallia&quot;, a former name: &quot;Land of the Celts&quot;, from Latin &quot;Gallia&quot;, of uncertain etymology. Possible derivations include an eponymous river or a minor tribe reconstructed as *&quot;Gal(a)-to-&quot; whose name was cognate with the Proto-Celtic *&quot;galno-&quot; (&quot;power&quot;, &quot;strength&quot;).
::&quot;Gaul&quot;, a former name: &quot;Land of Foreigners&quot;, from French &quot;Gaule&quot;, from Proto-Germanic *&quot;Walhaz&quot;, originally meaning &quot;Volcae&quot; but eventually simply &quot;foreigner&quot;.

==G==

===Gabon===
:&quot;Cloak&quot;, Anglicized from the Portuguese &quot;Gabão&quot;, bestowed on the Komo River estuary for its supposed resemblance to a &quot;gabão&quot;, a kind of pointy-hooded overcoat whose name derives from the Arabic ().

===The Gambia===
:&quot;Kaabu&quot;, selected upon independence in 1965 from the name of the former British colony, named for the Gambia River, from a corruption of the Portuguese &quot;Gambra&quot; and &quot;Cambra&quot; first recorded in 1455 by Alvise Cadamosto, a corruption of a local name &quot;Kambra&quot; or &quot;Kambaa&quot; (Mandinkan: &quot;Kaabu river&quot;) or &quot;Gambura&quot;, an amalgam of Mandinkan Kaabu and Wolof &quot;bur&quot; (&quot;king&quot;).
:A folk etymology traces the word from the Portuguese &quot;câmbio&quot; (&quot;trade&quot;, &quot;exchange&quot;), from the region&#x27;s extensive involvement in the slave trade.

===Georgia===

:Etymology uncertain. The terms &quot;Georgia&quot; and &quot;Georgian&quot; appeared in Western Europe in numerous early medieval annals. At the time, the name was folk etymologizedfor instance, by the French chronicler Jacques de Vitry and the &quot;English&quot; fraudster John Mandevillefrom a supposed especial reverence of the Saint George. According to several modern scholars, &quot;Georgia&quot; seems to have been borrowed in the 11th or 12th century from the Syriac &quot;Gurz-ān&quot; or &quot;-iyān&quot; and Arabic &quot;Ĵurĵan&quot; or &quot;Ĵurzan&quot;, derived from the New Persian &quot;Gurğ&quot; or &quot;Gurğān&quot;, itself stemming from the Ancient Iranian and Middle Persian &quot;Vrkān&quot; or &quot;Waručān&quot; of uncertain origin, but resembling the eastern trans-Caspian toponym &quot;Gorgan&quot;, from the Middle Persian &quot;Varkâna&quot; (&quot;land of the wolves&quot;). This might have been of the same etymology as the Armenian &quot;Virk&#x27;&quot; () and a source of the classical Iberi (, ).
:Another theory semantically links &quot;Georgia&quot; to Greek (, &quot;tiller of the land&quot;) and Latin &quot;georgicus&quot; (&quot;agricultural&quot;). The &quot;Georgi&quot; mentioned by Pliny the Elder and Pomponius Mela. were agricultural tribes distinguished as such from their pastoral neighbors across the Panticapaeum in Taurica.
::&quot;Sakartvelo&quot;, the local endonym: &quot;Place for Kartvelians&quot; in Georgian, from Kartli (), attested in the 5th-century &quot;Martyrdom of the Holy Queen Shushanik&quot;, possibly from a cognate with the Mingrelian &quot;karta&quot; (, &quot;cattle pen&quot;, &quot;enclosed place&quot;). Traditionally taken by the Georgian Chronicles as referring to Kartlos, an eponymous ancestor who supposedly built a city Kartli on the Mtkvari River near modern Armazi.
::Iberia, a former name: Latinized from Greek (), possibly from &quot;Virk&#x27;&quot; as above.

===Germany===

:Meaning uncertain. &quot;German&quot; attested 1520, Anglicized from Latin &quot;Germania&quot;, attested in the 3rd century BC, popularized by Julius Caesar as a reference to all tribes east of the Rhine, and repopularized in Europe following the rediscovery and publication of Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Germania&quot; in 1455. Proposed derivations include the Celtic &quot;gair-&quot; (&quot;neighbor&quot;), &quot;gairm&quot; (&quot;battle-cry&quot;) or &quot;*gar&quot; (&quot;to shout&quot;), and &quot;gar&quot; (&quot;spear&quot;).
::Deutschland, the local endonym: &quot;The People&#x27;s Land&quot;, from Old High German &quot;diutisciu land&quot;, from the Germanic (sometimes translated as &quot;vernacular&quot;, as opposed to Latin and Romance languages like Old French), a form of *&quot;þeudō&quot;, from the proposed Proto-Indo-European (&quot;people&quot;).
::Niemcy, the Polish term for Germany, Niemcy coming from the word &quot;niemy&quot; meaning mute, possibly as the populations did not understand each other at all due to germanic and slavic language differences .

===Ghana===

:&quot;Warrior King&quot;, adopted at J. B. Danquah&#x27;s suggestion upon the union of Gold Coast with British Togoland in 1956 or upon independence on 6 March 1957, in homage to the earlier Malian Ghana Empire, named for the title of its ruler. Despite the empire never holding territory near the current nation, traditional stories connect the northern Mande of Ghanathe Soninke, Dyula, Ligby, and Bissato peoples displaced following the collapse of the old Ghana.
::&quot;Togoland&quot; and British Togoland, former names: See Togo below.
::Gold Coast, a former name: Self-descriptive. Compare the names Europeans gave to nearby stretches of shore, as Côte d&#x27;Ivoire above.

===&quot;Kingdom of Great Britain&quot;===
:&quot;See etymology of &quot;Great Britain&quot; under the United Kingdom below.&quot;

===Greece===

:Etymology uncertain. From Old English &quot;Grecas&quot; and &quot;Crecas&quot;, from Latin , presumably from Greek (). The Romans were said to have called all the Greeks after the name of the first group they met, although the location of that tribe varies between EpirusAristotle recorded that the Illyrians used the name for Dorian Epiriots from their native name &quot;Graii&quot;and CumaeEusebius of Caesarea dated its settlement by Boeotians from Pithecusae led by Megasthenes and Hippocles to 1050 BC. The town of Graea ( ) in or near Oropos, Boeotia, appeared in Homer&#x27;s Catalogue of Ships and was said to be the oldest in Greece, and the Parian Chronicle lists &quot;Graikoí&quot; as the original name of the Greeks. The town and its region (, ) have been derived from the word γραῖα &quot;graia&quot; &quot;old woman&quot; which in its turn comes from the Proto-Indo-European language root &quot;*ǵerh2-/*ǵreh2-&quot;, &quot;to grow old&quot; via Proto-Greek &quot;*gera-/grau-iu&quot;; the same root later gave γέρας &quot;geras&quot; (/keras/), &quot;gift of honour&quot; in Mycenean Greek.
:Folk etymology linked the name with an eponymous patriarch Graecus, related to Hellen below.
::Hellás, the local endonym: Etymology unknown. Modern Greek () and classical () both derive from Greek (), which Aristotle traced the name to a region in Epirus between Dodona and the Achelous, where the Selloi (possibly &quot;sacrificers&quot;) were said to be priests of Dodonian Zeus and operators of the first oracle.
::Folk etymology linked the name with an eponymous patriarch Hellen (completely distinct from the female Helen of Troy), said to be the son of Deucalion and Pyrrha and to have originated in Thessalic Phthia. Achilleus commanded their forces at Troy. His brother Amphictyon was said to have founded the Great Amphictyonic League, which banded 12 city-states together to protect the temples of Apollo at Delphi and of Demeter at Anthele.

===Grenada===
:&quot;Granada&quot;, from its French name &quot;La Grenade&quot;, from earlier Spanish &quot;Granada&quot;, whose own name derived from the Emirate and Taifa of Granada, named for their capital &quot;Gharnāṭah&quot; (), originally a Jewish suburb (&quot;Garnata al-Yahud&quot;) of Elvira which became the principal settlement after the latter was destroyed in 1010.
::Concepción, a former name: &quot;Conception&quot;, bestowed by Christopher Columbus upon his discovery of the island in 1498. Its hostile Carib natives, however, limited colonization until the name had fallen from use.

===Guinea===

:Etymology uncertain. Anglicized from Portuguese &quot;Guiné&quot;, traditionally derived from a corruption of Ghana above, originally in reference to the interior and applied to the coast only after 1481. Alternate theories include a corruption of Djenné and the Berber &quot;ghinawen&quot;, &quot;aginaw&quot;, or &quot;aguinaou&quot; (&quot;burnt one&quot;, i.e. &quot;black&quot;).
::French Guinea, a former name: As above, from the French &quot;Guinée française&quot;, a renaming of &quot;Rivières du Sud&quot; in 1894. For further etymology of &quot;France&quot;, see above.
::Rivières du Sud, a former name: &quot;Southern Rivers&quot; in French.
::Guinea-Conakry, an alternate name: As above. Conakry, the capital, is traditionally derived from an amalgam of Baga &quot;Cona&quot;, a wine producer, and Sosso &quot;nakiri&quot; (&quot;other side&quot; or &quot;shore&quot;).

===Guinea-Bissau===
:Etymology of &quot;Guinea&quot; uncertain. The Portuguese name of was adopted officially upon independence in 1973.

==H==

===Haiti===
:From Taíno/Arawak, &quot;Hayiti&quot; or &quot;Hayti&quot;, meaning &quot;mountainous land&quot;, originally &quot;Hayiti&quot;. The name derives from the mountainous and hilly landscape of the western half of the island of Hispaniola.
:* &quot;Hispaniola&quot; (name of the island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic) – a Latinization of the Spanish name &quot;La Española&quot;, meaning &quot;The Spanish (island)&quot;, a name given to the island by Columbus in 1492.

===Honduras===

:Christopher Columbus named the country &quot;Honduras&quot;, Spanish for &quot;depths&quot;, referring to the deep waters off the northern coast.

===Hungary===

:Turkic: &quot;on-ogur&quot;, &quot;(people of the) ten arrows&quot; – in other words, &quot;alliance of the ten tribes&quot;. Byzantine chronicles gave this name to the Hungarians; the chroniclers mistakenly assumed that the Hungarians had Turkic origins, based on their Turkic-nomadic customs and appearance, despite the Uralic language of the people. The Hungarian tribes later actually formed an alliance of the seven Hungarian and three Khazarian tribes, but the name is from before then, and first applied to the original seven Hungarian tribes. The ethnonym &quot;Hunni&quot; (referring to the Huns) has influenced the Latin (and English) spelling.
:* &quot;Ugry&quot; (Угры, Old East Slavic), &quot;Uhorshchyna&quot; (Угорщина, Ukrainian), &quot;Vengrija&quot; (Lithuanian), &quot;Vengry&quot;, &quot;Vengriya&quot; (Венгры, Венгрия, Russian), &quot;Vuhorščyna&quot; (Вугоршчына, Belarusian), &quot;Wędżierskô&quot; (Kashubian), and &quot;Węgry&quot; (Polish): also from Turkic &quot;on-ogur&quot;, see above. The same root emerges in the ethnonym Yugra in Siberia, inhabited by Khanty and Mansi people, the closest relatives to Hungarians in the Uralic language family.
:* &quot;Magyarország&quot; (native name – &quot;land of the Magyars&quot;), and derivatives, e.g. Czech &quot;Maďarsko&quot;, Serbo-Croatian &quot;Mađarska&quot;, Turkish &quot;Macaristan&quot;: &quot;magyar&quot; &#x27;Hungarian&#x27; + &quot;ország&quot; &#x27;land, country&#x27;. &quot;Magyar&quot; is likely a compound of parts either extinct, or extant for long back only as components of compounds: the antecedent may have been an ancient Ugric &quot;*mańćɜ&quot;, cf. Mansi &quot;mäńćī&quot; &#x27;Manshi; unchristened child&#x27;, &quot;måńś&quot; &#x27;joint endonym for the Khanty and the Mansi&#x27;, Khanty &quot;mańt&quot; &#x27;the name of one of the Khanty alliances of tribes&#x27;. The posterior constituent is the independently not used word &quot;er&quot;, going back to ancient Finno-Ugric &quot;*irkä&quot; &#x27;man, boy&#x27;, found in modern Hungarian &quot;ember&quot; &#x27;man&#x27;, &quot;férj&quot; &#x27;husband&#x27;, &quot;némber&quot; &#x27;woman without respectable qualities&#x27;; cf. Mari &quot;erγe&quot; &#x27;boy&#x27;, Finnish &quot;yrkö&quot; &#x27;man&#x27;. In Hungarian, after the dimming of it having been made up of constituent parts, and due to the action of wovel harmony present in Hungarian, &quot;magyeri&quot;, &quot;magyer&quot; became &quot;magyar&quot;. &quot;Ország&quot; comes from the old &quot;uru&quot; form of &quot;úr&quot; &#x27;lord, master&#x27;, affixed with derivational suffix &#x27;-szág&#x27; (alternative of &#x27;-ság&#x27;). According to unsubstantiated legend, recounted in the chronicle of Simon of Kéza (&quot;Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum&quot;, 1282), Magyar (Magor), the forefather of all Hungarians, had a brother named Hunor (the ancestor of the Huns); their father king Menrot, equates to the Nimrod, builder of the tower of Babel, of the Hebrew Bible. 

==I==

===Iceland===

:&quot;Land of Ice&quot;, from Old Norse &quot;Ísland&quot;, from &quot;íss&quot; (&quot;ice&quot;). Owing to the reports on the origin of the name Greenland, Iceland has been folk etymologized to have arisen as an attempt to dissuade outsiders from attempting to settle the land. However, according to the Landnámabók, the early explorer and settler Flóki Vilgerðarson gave the island the name after spotting &quot;a firth [or fjord] full of drift ice&quot; to the north. According to various alternative but not widely accepted theories, such as those advanced by pyramidologist Adam Rutherford or writer Einar Pálsson (in his book &quot;The Celtic Heritage&quot;,) the origin of the name &quot;Ís-land&quot; lies either with the ancient Egyptian goddess Isis or with Jesus.

===India===

:&quot;Land of the Indus River&quot; in Latin, from Greek , from Old Persian &quot;Hindu&quot; (), the Old Persian name of the Sind Province, ultimately derived from Sanskrit &quot;Sindhu&quot; (), the original name of the Indus River
::Bharat (), a native name: Sanskrit, commonly derived from the name of either of two legendary kings named Bharata (Dushyanta&#x27;s son Bharata or Rishabha&#x27;s son Bharata). However, it is in reference to the entire Indian subcontinent.
::Hindustan (), a native &amp; former name: &quot;Land of Sind&quot;, from Hindi, from Persian (), a compound of (, &quot;Sind&quot;) and &quot;-stan&quot; (&quot;land&quot;, see Afghanistan above). The terms &quot;Hind&quot; and &quot;Hindustan&quot; were used interchangeably from the 11th century by Muslim rulers such as the Mughal Emperors and used by the Government of India during the Raj era alongside &quot;India&quot; to refer to the entire subcontinent including modern-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and for specifically the northern region surrounding the Ganges valley since the 19th century.
::Aryavarta (), a native name: Sanskrit for &quot;land of Aryans&quot;

===Indonesia===

:&quot;Indian Islands&quot; in Greek (), apparently invented in the mid-19th century to mean &quot;Indies Islands&quot;, from the islands&#x27; previous name &quot;East Indies&quot;.
::Dutch East Indies, a former name: a translation of the Dutch &quot;Nederlands Oost-Indië&quot;
::Hindia-Belanda, a former name: the Indonesian form of the Dutch name above.

===Iran===
:&quot;Land of the Aryans&quot; or &quot;land of the free&quot;. The term &quot;Arya&quot; is from a Proto Indo-Iranian root, generally meaning &quot;noble&quot; or &quot;free&quot;, cognate with the Greek-derived word &quot;aristocrat&quot;.
:*Persia (former name): from Latin, via Greek &quot;Persis&quot;, from Old Persian &quot;Pārsa&quot;, originally the name of Persis (modern-day Fars or Pars), a place name of a central district within the region. A common Hellenic folk-etymology derives &quot;Persia&quot; from &quot;Land of Perseus&quot;.
:*The Modern Persian word &quot;Īrān&quot; () derives immediately from Middle Persian &quot;Ērān&quot; (Pahlavi spelling: &quot;ʼyrʼn&quot;), first attested in an inscription that accompanies the investiture relief of the first Sassanid king Ardashir I at Naqsh-e Rustam.

===Iraq===

:The prevailing theory is that it is derived from the city of Erech/Uruk (also known as &quot;Warka&quot;) near the river Euphrates. Some archaeologists regard Uruk as the first major Sumerian city. However, it is more plausible that name is derived from the Middle Persian word &quot;Erak&quot;, meaning &quot;lowlands&quot;. The natives of the southwestern part of today&#x27;s Iran called their land &quot;the Persian Iraq&quot; for many centuries (for Arabs: &quot;Iraq ajemi&quot;: non-Arabic-speaking Iraq). Before the constitution of the state of Iraq, the term &quot;Iraq arabi&quot; referred to the region around Baghdad and Basra.
:*Mesopotamia (ancient name and Greek variant): a loan-translation (Greek &quot;meso-&quot; (between) and &quot;potamos&quot; (river), meaning &quot;Between the Rivers&quot;) of the ancient Semitic &quot;Bein-Al Nahrein&quot;, &quot;Land of two Rivers&quot;, referring to the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.

===Ireland===

:After &quot;Éire&quot; from Proto-Celtic &quot;*Φīweriyū&quot;, &quot;the fertile place&quot; or &quot;Place of Éire (Ériu)&quot;, a Celtic fertility goddess. Often mistakenly derived as &quot;Land of Iron&quot;; may come from a reflex of Proto-Indo-European &quot;*arya&quot;, or from variations of the Irish word for &quot;west&quot; (Modern Irish ).
:*Hibernia (ancient name and Latin variant): apparently assimilated to Latin (&quot;wintry&quot;) from earlier &quot;Ivernia&quot; (given in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geographia&quot; as ), from the above Celtic name.
:*Ireland is known as in Scottish Gaelic, from the dative case of Old Irish . In the fellow Celtic languages: in Welsh it is ; in Cornish it is or ; and in Breton it is .
:*In Gaelic bardic tradition Ireland is also known by the poetical names of &quot;Banbha&quot; and &quot;Fódhla&quot;. In Gaelic myth, Ériu, Banba and Fódla were three goddesses who greeted the Milesians upon their arrival in Ireland, and who granted them custody of the island.

===Israel===

:&quot;El(God) persists/rules&quot;.
:&quot;Israel&quot; and related terms &quot;the people of Israel&quot; ( ) and &quot;the Children of Israel&quot; ( ) have referred to the Jewish People in its literature from antiquity. The name ( – literally: &quot;will Struggle with God&quot;), originates from the Hebrew Bible as an appellation given to the biblical patriarch Jacob. According to the account in the Book of Genesis, Jacob wrestled with an angel at a river ford and won – through perseverance. God then changed his name to &quot;Israel&quot;, signifying that he had deliberated with God and won, as he had wrestled and won with men.

===Italy===

:From the mythological figure of Italus.
:From Latin &quot;Ītalia&quot;, itself from Greek , from the ethnic name , plural , originally referring to an early population in the southern part of Calabria. That ethnic name probably directly relates to a word (&quot;italós&quot;, &quot;bull&quot;), quoted in an ancient Greek gloss by Hesychius (from his collection of 51,000 unusual, obscure and foreign words). This &quot;Greek&quot; word is assumed to be a cognate of Latin (&quot;calf&quot;), although the different length of the &quot;i&quot; is a problem. The Latin is presumably derived from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*wet-&quot; meaning &quot;year&quot; (hence, a &quot;yearling&quot;: a &quot;one-year-old calf&quot;), although the change of &quot;e&quot; to &quot;i&quot; is unexplained. The &quot;Greek&quot; word, however, is glossed as &quot;bull&quot;, not &quot;calf&quot;. Speakers of ancient Oscan called Italy &quot;Víteliú&quot;, a cognate of Greek and Latin . Varro wrote that the region got its name from the excellence and abundance of its cattle. Some disagree with that etymology. Compare Italus.
:*&quot;Friagi&quot; or &quot;Friaz&quot;&#x27; (Old East Slavic): from the Byzantine appellation for the medieval Franks.
:*&quot;Valland&quot; (variant in Icelandic): &quot;Land of Valer&quot; (an Old Norse name for Celts, later also used for the Romanized tribes).
:*&quot;Włochy&quot; (Polish) and &quot;Olaszország&quot; (Hungarian): from Gothic &quot;walh&quot;, the same root as in &quot;Valland&quot; and &quot;Wallachia&quot;.

Also formerly known as the &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;.
:*&quot;Nihon&quot; / &quot;Nippon&quot;: Japanese name, from the Onyomi (Sino-Japanese) pronunciation of the same characters as above.

The neighbouring Kamba tribe do not have the &quot;R&quot; and &quot;G&quot; sound in their language and called it &quot;Keinya&quot; when acting as guides to a German explorer. It is often erroneously believed it comes from Kirima Ngai &quot;Mountain of God&quot;

The original name was a combination of the adjective &quot;go&quot; (고; 高) meaning &quot;lofty&quot; and a local Yemaek tribe, whose original name is thought to have been either &quot;Guru&quot; (구루, &quot;walled city&quot;) or &quot;Gauri&quot; (가우리, &quot;center&quot;).
::South Koreans call Korea &quot;Hanguk&quot; (한국), an early 20th century neologism derived from the name &quot;Samhan&quot;, referring to the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

The meaning and origin of name of Latvian people is unclear, however the root lat-/let- is associated with several Baltic hydronyms and might share common origin with the &quot;Liet-&quot; part of neighbouring Lithuania (&quot;Lietuva&quot;, see below) and name of Latgalians – one of the Baltic tribes that are considered ancestors of modern Latvian people.

===Lebanon===

:The name Lebanon ( in standard Arabic; &quot;Lebnan&quot; or &quot;Lebnèn&quot; in local dialect) is derived from the Semitic root &quot;LBN&quot;, which is linked to several closely related meanings in various languages, such as &quot;white&quot; and &quot;milk&quot;. This is regarded as a reference to the snow-capped Mount Lebanon, which is actually what the country was named after as it had previously been called Phoenicia, a prosperous ancient semitic civilization that hailed from the land in Modern day Lebanon. Occurrences of the name have been found in three of the twelve tablets of the Epic of Gilgamesh (2900 BC), the texts of the library of Ebla (2400 BC), and the Bible (71 times in the Bible&#x27;s Old Testament).

===Lesotho===
:&quot;Land of the Basotho&quot; or &quot;of the Sesotho-speakers&quot;. Basotho itself is formed from the plural prefix &quot;ba-&quot; and &quot;Sotho&quot; of uncertain etymology, although possibly related to the word &quot;motho&quot; (&quot;human being&quot;).
:&quot;Basutoland&quot;: &quot;Land of the Basotho&quot;, from an early anglicization of their name

===Liberia===
:From the Latin &quot;free&quot;, so named because the country was established as a homeland for freed (liberated) African-American slaves.

===Libya===

:After an ancient Berber tribe called &quot;Libyans&quot; by the Greeks and &quot;Rbw&quot; by the Egyptians. Until the country&#x27;s independence, the term &quot;Libya&quot; generally applied only to the vast desert between the Tripolitanian Lowland and the Fazzan plateau (to the west) and Egypt&#x27;s Nile river valley (to the east). With &quot;Tripoli&quot; the name of new country&#x27;s capital, and the old northeastern regional name &quot;Cyrenaica&quot; having passed into obsolescence, &quot;Libya&quot; became a convenient name for the country.

===Liechtenstein===
:From the German &quot;light stone&quot; (&quot;light&quot; as in &quot;bright&quot;). The country took its name from the Liechtenstein dynasty, which purchased and united the counties of Schellenberg and Vaduz. The Holy Roman Emperor allowed the dynasty to rename the new property after itself.

:Liechtenstein and Luxembourg are the only *German-speaking former member monarchies of the de facto confederal &quot;Holy Roman Empire&quot; (961–1806) that were not assimilated or annexed by Germany, Austria or Switzerland.

:(* In the case of Luxembourg, German is – for historical reasons – one of the three official administrative languages, after Luxembourgish and French. German is not the national mother tongue of the Luxembourgish people.)

===Lithuania===
: Multiple theories: Some link it to the word (&quot;to consolidate&quot; or &quot;to unite&quot;), referring to the first union of tribes in ethnic Lithuanian lands (not lands of Balts, but lands of ancient tribes of Lithuanians including Prussians, nowadays Latvians and Belarusians).
:Alternatively, could be a hydronym, possibly from a small river &quot;Lietava&quot; in central Lithuania. That hydronym has been associated with Lithuanian &quot;lieti&quot; (root &quot;lie-&quot; &quot;pour&quot; or &quot;spill&quot;). Compare to Old Slavic &quot;liyati&quot; (лыиати &quot;pour&quot;), Greek &quot;a-lei-son&quot; ( &quot;cup&quot;), Latin (&quot;seashore&quot;), Tocharian A &quot;lyjäm&quot; (&quot;lake&quot;).
:Historically, attempts have been made to suggest a direct descendance from the Latin (see littoral). (genitive: ), an early Latin variant of the toponym, appears in a 1009 chronicle describing an archbishop &quot;struck over the head by pagans on the border of Russia/Prussia and &quot;. A 16th-century scholar associated the word with the Latin word (&quot;tubes&quot;) – a possible reference to wooden trumpets played by Lithuanian tribesmen.
: A folkloric explanation is that the country&#x27;s name in the Lithuanian language () is derived from a word (&quot;rain&quot;) and means &quot;a rainy place&quot;.

===Luxembourg===
:The country which was initially called &quot;(County of the) Ardennes&quot; named itself after its homonym capital city founded in 963. 
:From Celtic &quot;Lucilem&quot; &quot;small&quot;, German &quot;lützel&quot;, OHG &quot;luc(c)il&quot;, &quot;luz(z)il&quot; (cognate to English &quot;little&quot;) and Germanic &quot;Burg&quot;: &quot;castle&quot; or &quot;fortress&quot;, thus &quot;Lucilemburg&quot;: &quot;little castle&quot; or &quot;little fortress&quot;.

:Later forms of the name were: Lütze(l)burg, Lëtzelburg (cf. Luxembourgish: &quot;Lëtzebuerg&quot;) 
:The evolution towards the originally French versions of the name using the letter X instead of C, TZ or TS (Luxembourg, Luxemburg), which were adopted by most languages (but not by Luxembourgish itself), was the result of the French cultural influence throughout Europe since the 17th century.

:Luxembourg and Liechtenstein are the only *German-speaking former member monarchies of the de facto confederal &quot;Holy Roman Empire&quot; (961–1806) which were not assimilated or annexed by Germany, Austria or Switzerland.

:(* In the case of Luxembourg, German is – for historical reasons – one of the three official administrative languages, after Luxembourgish and French. German and French are &quot;not&quot; the national mother tongue of the Luxembourgish people.)

==M==

===Madagascar===

:From &quot;Madageiscar&quot;, a corruption of Mogadishu popularized by Marco Polo.

===Malawi===
:Possibly based on a native word meaning &quot;flaming water&quot; or &quot;tongues of fire&quot;, believed to have derived from the sun&#x27;s dazzling reflections on Lake Malawi. But President Hastings Banda, the founding President of Malawi, reported in interviews that in the 1940s he saw a &quot;Lac Maravi&quot; shown in &quot;Bororo&quot; country on an antique French map titled &quot;La Basse Guinee Con[t]enant Les Royaumes de Loango, de Congo, d&#x27;Angola et de Benguela&quot; and he liked the name &quot;Malawi&quot; better than &quot;Nyasa&quot; (or &quot;Maravi&quot;). &quot;Lac Marawi&quot; does not necessarily correspond to today&#x27;s Lake Malawi. Banda had such influence at the time of independence in 1964 that he named the former Nyasaland &quot;Malawi&quot;, and the name stuck.
:* Nyasaland (former name): &quot;Nyasa&quot; literally means &quot;lake&quot; in the local indigenous languages. The name applied to Lake Malawi, formerly Lake Nyasa (Niassa).

===Malaysia===

: &quot;Land of the Malays&quot;: a combination of &quot;Malay&quot; and the Latin/Greek suffix -sia/-σία. &quot;malayadvīpa&quot; (Sanskrit: मलयद्वीप) was the word used by ancient Indian traders when referring to the Malay Peninsula. In modern terminology, &quot;Malay&quot; is the name of an ethnoreligious group of Austronesian people predominantly inhabiting the Malay Peninsula and portions of adjacent islands of Southeast Asia, including the east coast of Sumatra, the coast of Borneo, and smaller islands that lie between these areas. A theory suggests that the word &quot;Melayu&quot; (&#x27;Malay&#x27;) is derived from the Malay/Javanese terms &quot;melayu&quot; or &quot;mlayu&quot; (to steadily accelerate or to run), to describe the strong current of a river in Sumatra that today bore the name &quot;Sungai Melayu&quot;. The name was later possibly adopted by the Melayu Kingdom that existed in the 7th century on Sumatra. The continental part of the country bore the name &quot;Tanah Melayu&quot; (literally &#x27;Malay Land&#x27;) or Malaya until 1963, when Federation of Malaysia was formed together with the territories of Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore (the latter withdrew in 1965). The name change indicated the change of the country&#x27;s boundaries beyond Malay Peninsula. &quot;Malaysian&quot; refers to its citizens of all races includes the native aboriginal people, while &quot;Malay&quot; refers to the Malay people, which makes up about half of the population.

===Maldives===

: Scholars believe that the name &quot;Maldives&quot; derives from the Sanskrit (), meaning &quot;garland of islands&quot;. Some sources say that the Tamil () or Malayalam (): &quot;mountain(s)&quot;, Tamil () and Sanskrit (): &quot;island&quot;, thus, &quot;Mountain Islands&quot;.
:* () (Maldivian name): &quot;Kingdom of Maldivians&quot;. is a noun describing the Dhives people (Maldivians) and their language &quot;Dhivehi&quot; simultaneously.
:* (): Sanskrit for &quot;garland ( , ) of islands&quot;; or, more likely, &quot;small islands&quot;, from () () meaning &quot;small&quot;.

===Mali===
:After the ancient West African kingdom of the same name, where a large part of the modern country is. The word &quot;mali&quot; means &quot;hippopotamus&quot; in Malinké and Bamana.
:* French Sudan (former colonial name). In French &quot;Soudan français&quot;. The term Sudan (see below) stems from the Arabic () (&quot;land of the Blacks&quot;).

===Malta===

:From either Greek or Phoenician. Of the two cultures, available evidence suggests that the Greeks had an earlier presence on the island, from as far back as 700 BC. The Greeks are known to have called the island () meaning &quot;honey&quot;, as did the Romans; solid evidence for this is Malta&#x27;s domination by the Byzantine Empire from 395 through to 870. It is still nicknamed the &quot;land of honey&quot;. The theory for a Phoenician origin of the word is via 𐤈𐤄𐤋𐤀𐤌 &quot;Maleth&quot; meaning &quot;a haven&quot;. The modern-day name comes from the Maltese language, through an evolution of one of the earlier names.

===Marshall Islands===
:Named after British captain John Marshall, who first documented the existence of the islands in 1788. The family name is rendered &quot;&quot; in Marshallese.

===Mauritania===
:Latin for &quot;land of the Moors&quot; (from Greek &quot;máuros&quot;, μαύρος (black). Not to be confused with the classical Mauretania in northern Morocco, itself named after the Berber Mauri or Moor tribe.

===Mauritius===
:Named &quot;Prins Maurits van Nassaueiland&quot; in 1598 after Maurice of Nassau (1567–1625), Stadtholder of Holland and Prince of Orange (1585–1625).

===Mexico===

:After the Mexica. The meaning of the name is uncertain. Some take it as the old Nahuatl word for the sun. See also Mexican state name etymologies.

===Federated States of Micronesia===
:Coined from the Greek words ( &quot;small&quot;) and ( &quot;island&quot;) – &quot;small islands&quot;.

===Moldova===

:From the Moldova River in Romania, possibly from Gothic (): &quot;dust&quot;, &quot;mud&quot;, via the Principality of Moldavia (&quot;Moldova&quot; in Romanian).
:There is also a well-known Romanian legend about a young man named Dragoș Vodă who went hunting for an aurochs or a wisent, followed by a bunch of dogs. During the hunting expedition, all the dogs got tired and fell down, except for a female dog named Molda which ran to the wild animal all the time. After the wisent entered into a river, the female dog did the same thing, but unfortunately it got drowned and died in that way. Thanks to Molda, Dragoș finally killed the wisent and cut its head off, and in memory of his dog&#x27;s sacrifice, he named the river and the land after MOLda – MOLdovA. That legend, which is a fictional story, explains the name of the territory and country&#x27;s etymology and also explains why the symbol of Moldova is the wisent head.

===Monaco===
:From the ancient Greek () &#x27;single-dwelling&#x27;, through Latin &quot;Monoecus&quot;. Originally the name of an ancient colony founded in the 6th century B.C. by Phocian Greeks, and a by-name of the demigod Hercules worshiped there. (The association of Monaco with monks (Italian &quot;monaci&quot;) dates from the Grimaldi conquest of 1297: see coat of arms of Monaco.)

===Mongolia===
:&quot;Land of the Mongols&quot; in Latin. &quot;Mongol&quot; ultimately from Mongolian &quot;Mongol&quot; () of uncertain etymology, given variously as the name of a mountain or river; a corruption of the Mongolian &quot;Mongkhe-tengri-gal&quot; (&quot;Eternal Sky Fire&quot;); or a derivation from Mugulu, the 4th-century founder of the Rouran Khaganate. First attested as the &quot;Mungu&quot; (Chinese: , &quot;Měngwù&quot;, &quot;Muwngu&quot;) branch of the Shiwei in an 8th-century Tang dynasty list of northern tribes, presumably related to the Liao-era &quot;Mungku&quot; (Chinese: , &quot;Měnggǔ&quot;, &quot;MuwngkuX&quot;) tribe now known as the &quot;Khamag Mongol&quot;. The last head of the tribe was Yesügei, whose son Temüjin eventually united all the Shiwei tribes as the Mongol Empire (&quot;Yekhe Monggol Ulus&quot;).

===Montenegro===

:&quot;Black Mountain&quot; in the Venetian language, for Mount Lovćen and its dark coniferous forests.
::Crna Gora, the local endonym: As above, in Serbian ().
::Doclea, a former name: &quot;Land of the Docleatae&quot;, Latinized from the Greek name &quot;Dokleátai&quot; () of an Illyrian tribe formed around old Podgorica following the Great Illyrian Revolt. The Romans subsequently hyper-corrected the name to Dioclea by &quot;restoring&quot; a supposed lost -I-.
::Zeta, a former name: &quot;[Land of the] Zeta River&quot; (), whose name probably relates to early Slavic roots related to &quot;harvest&quot; (Serbian: &quot;žetva&quot;) or &quot;grain&quot; (&quot;žito&quot;).

===Morocco===

:from &quot;Marrakesh&quot;, the south region&#x27;s former capital, from Portuguese &quot;Marrocos&quot;. Form of the Berber name (), probably from (, &quot;Land of God&quot;).
::Al-Maghrib, a native name: Arabic for &quot;the West&quot; (), although note that in English use, the Maghreb typically refers to all of northwest Africa, not Morocco in particular. Also, Maghreb means &quot;The Land of Sunset&quot;.

===Mozambique===

:From the name of the Island of Mozambique, which in turn probably comes from the name of the sheik Mussa Ben Mbiki, the Arab ruler at the time when Vasco da Gama called at the island in 1498.

===Myanmar===
==N==

===Namibia===
:From the coastal Namib Desert. &quot;Namib&quot; means &quot;area where there is nothing&quot; in the Nama language.
::South-West Africa, a former name: location on the continent. For Africa, see List of continent-name etymologies.
::German Southwest Africa, a former name: As above. For Germany, see Germany above.

===Nauru===

:The name &quot;Nauru&quot; may derive from the Nauruan word &quot;Anáoero&quot;, which means &quot;I go to the beach&quot;. The German settlers called the island &quot;Nawodo&quot; or &quot;Onawero&quot;.

===Nepal===

:The name &quot;Nepal&quot; is derived from &quot;Nepa&quot; as mentioned in the historical maps of South Asia. &quot;Nepa&quot; literally means &quot;those who domesticate cattle&quot; in the Tibeto-Burman languages. The land was known by its people the Nepa or Nepar, Newar, Newa, Newal etc., who still inhabit the area i.e. the valley of Kathmandu and its surroundings. The Newa people use &quot;Ra&quot; and &quot;La&quot; or &quot;Wa&quot; and &quot;Pa&quot; interchangeably, hence the different names mentioned above.
:Some say it derives from the Sanskrit word &quot;nīpālaya&quot; (Sanskrit: नीपालय), which means &quot;abode at the foot of mountain&#x27;, referring to its proximity to the Himalayas. (Compare the analogous European toponym &quot;Piedmont&quot;.) Others suggest that it derives from the Tibetan &quot;niyampal&quot;, which means &quot;holy land&quot;.

===Netherlands===

:&quot;Netherlands&quot; literally means &quot;Low countries&quot; or &quot;Lowlands&quot;. Dutch &quot;neder&quot; and its English cognate &quot;nether&quot; both mean &#x27;down(ward), below&#x27;. The English word is now uncommon, mostly replaced by &quot;lower&quot; in English. &quot;Neder&quot; or &quot;nether&quot; may simply have denoted the geographical characteristics of the land, both flat and down river. This may have applied to the singular form &quot;Nederland&quot;, or &quot;Niderland&quot;. It was a geographical description of low regions in the Germanic lands. Thus it was also used to refer specifically to the estuaries of the Scheldt, Meuse and Rhine, including the Lower Rhineland.
::Holland, a former name: From the region of Holland within the Netherlands, often used by metonymy for the country as a whole. &quot;Holland&quot; from the Germanic &quot;holt-land&quot; (&quot;wooded land&quot;), although often pseudoetymologized as &quot;hollow&quot; or &quot;marsh land&quot;).
::Batavia, a former and poetic name: From the Latin name of the Germanic Batavii tribe.

===New Zealand===
:After the province of Zeeland in the Netherlands, which means &quot;sea land&quot;, referring to the large number of islands it contains. Abel Tasman referred to New Zealand as &quot;Staten Landt&quot;, but later Dutch cartographers used &quot;Nova Zeelandia&quot;, in Latin, followed by &quot;Nieuw Zeeland&quot; in Dutch, which Captain James Cook later anglicised to &quot;New Zealand&quot;.
:* &quot;Aotearoa&quot; has become the most common name for the country in the indigenous Māori language, supplanting the loan-phrase &quot;Niu Tireni&quot;. &quot;Aotearoa&quot; conventionally means &quot;land of the long white cloud&quot;.
:* &quot;Nua Shealtainn&quot; in both Irish and Scottish Gaelic, meaning &quot;New Shetland&quot; (&quot;Sealtainn&quot;), itself from a metathesised form of Scots &quot;Shetland&quot;. Gaelic speakers seem to have folk-etymologised &quot;Zeeland&quot; when translating New Zealand&#x27;s name from English.

===Nicaragua===

:&quot;Here Surrounded By Water&quot;, from Nahuatl &quot;Nicānāhuac&quot;, the name the Nicaraos gave to western Nicaragua. This endonym referred to the large bodies of water that surrounded the land the Nicaraos inhabited: The Pacific Ocean, lakes Nicaragua and Xolotlan, and the rivers and lagoons. It&#x27;s a combination of the Nahuatl words &quot;Nican&quot; (here), and &quot;Ānāhuac&quot;, which in turn is a combination of the words &quot;atl&quot; (water) and &quot;nahuac&quot;, a locative meaning &quot;surrounded&quot;.

===Niger===
:In English, Niger may be pronounced or .
:Named after the Niger River, from a native term &quot;Ni Gir&quot; or &quot;River Gir&quot; or from Tuareg &quot;n&#x27;eghirren&quot; (&quot;flowing water&quot;).

===Nigeria===
:After the Niger river that flows through the western areas of the country and into the ocean and area. See Niger above.

===North Korea===
:Self-descriptive, from its location in the northern portion of the Korean Peninsula. For the etymology of Korea, see Korea above.

===North Macedonia===
:Self-descriptive, from its location in the northern portion of Macedonia.
::Macedonia: The country name () is from the Greek word &quot;Μακεδονία&quot; (&quot;Makedonía&quot;), a kingdom (later, region) named after the ancient Macedonians. Their name, Μακεδόνες (&quot;Makedónes&quot;), derives ultimately from the ancient Greek adjective μακεδνός (&quot;makednós&quot;), meaning &quot;tall, taper&quot;, which shares the same root as the noun μάκρος (&quot;mákros&quot;), meaning &quot;length&quot; in both ancient and modern Greek. The name is originally believed to have meant either &quot;highlanders&quot; or &quot;the tall ones&quot;. The provisional term &quot;the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&quot; was used in many international contexts in acknowledgment of a political dispute with Greece over the historical legitimacy of the country&#x27;s use of the name. In February 2019, the country renamed itself to the Republic of North Macedonia.

===Norway===

:From the Old Norse &quot;norðr&quot; and &quot;vegr&quot;, &quot;northern way&quot;. &quot;Norðrvegr&quot; refers to long coastal passages from the western tip of Norway to its northernmost lands in the Arctic.
::Natively called &quot;Norge&quot; in Bokmål and &quot;Noreg&quot; in Nynorsk.
::&quot;Urmane&quot;, or &quot;Murmane&quot; (урмане; Му́рмане) in Old East Slavic: from the Old Norse pronunciation of the word &quot;Normans&quot;: &quot;Northmen&quot;. (This word survives in the name of the Russian city Murmansk.)
::&quot;An Iorua&quot; (Irish) seems to derive from a misinterpretation of Old Norse &quot;Norðrvegr&quot; as beginning the Irish definite article &quot;an&quot;, common to most country names in Irish. The rest of the word was then taken as the country name. (A similar process took place in the development of the English word &quot;adder&quot;: originally &quot;a nadder&quot;.)

==O==

===Oman===
:Etymology uncertain. It seems to be related to Pliny the Elder&#x27;s Omana and Ptolemy&#x27;s Omanon (), both probably the ancient Sohar. The city or region is typically etymologized in Arabic from &quot;aamen&quot; or &quot;amoun&quot; (&quot;settled&quot; people, as opposed to the bedouin), although a number of eponymous founders have been proposed (Oman bin Ibrahim al-Khalil, Oman bin Siba&#x27; bin Yaghthan bin Ibrahim, Oman bin Qahtan, and the Biblical Lot) and others derive it from the name of a valley in Yemen at Ma&#x27;rib presumed to have been the origin of the city&#x27;s founders, the Azd, a tribe migrating from Yemen.

==P==

===Pakistan===
The name literally means &quot;Land of the Pure&quot; in Urdu and Persian. It was coined in 1933 as &quot;Pakstan&quot; by Choudhry Rahmat Ali, a Pakistan Movement activist, who published it in his pamphlet &quot;Now or Never&quot;, using it as an acronym (&quot;thirty million Muslim brethren who live in PAKSTAN&quot;) referring to the names of the five northwestern regions of the British Indian Empire: Punjab, Afghania, Kashmir, Sindh, and Baluchistan&quot;. The letter &quot;i&quot; was incorporated to ease pronunciation and form the linguistically correct and meaningful name.

===Palau===
:From the native name &quot;Belau&quot; (&quot;Palau&quot;), traditionally derived from Palauan &quot;aidebelau&quot; (&quot;indirect replies&quot;), in reference to the island&#x27;s creation story involving the destruction of the giant Chuab.
::Belau, the local endonym: As above.
::Los Palos, a former name: A Spanish adaptation of the above.
::Pelew, a former name: From the transcription of Belau above by the British captain Henry Wilson, whose ship was wrecked off Ulong Island in 1783.

===Palestine===

The English word Palestine is derived from the Latin (&quot;Roman Province of Palestine&quot;), which is derived from the Ancient Greek (&quot;Palaistine&quot;, &quot;Philistia and surrounding regions&quot;), which is in turn derived from the Hebrew (&quot;Pelesheth&quot;, &quot;land of the Philistines&quot;)

===Panama===

:After a former village near the modern capital, Panama City. From the Cueva language meaning &quot;place of abundance of fish&quot; or &quot;place of many fish&quot;, possibly from the Caribe &quot;abundance of butterflies&quot;, or possibly from another native term referring to the Panama tree.

===Papua New Guinea===

:The country acquired its name in the 19th century. The word &quot;Papua&quot; derives from Malay &quot;papuah&quot; describing the hair styles found in Papuan cultures. &quot;New Guinea&quot; comes from the Spanish explorer Yñigo Ortiz de Retez, who noted the resemblance of the local people to those he had earlier seen along the Guinea coast of Africa.

===Paraguay===

:The exact meaning of the word &quot;Paraguay&quot; is unknown, though it seems to derive from the river of the same name. One of the most common explanations is that it means &quot;water of the Payagua (a native tribe)&quot;. Another meaning links the Guarani words &quot;para&quot; (&quot;river&quot;) and &quot;guai&quot; (&quot;crown&quot;), meaning &quot;crowned river&quot;. A third meaning may be &quot;para&quot; (&quot;river&quot;), &quot;gua&quot; (&quot;from&quot;), &quot;y&quot; (&quot;water&quot;) meaning &quot;water that comes from the river&quot;, referring to the bog in the north of the country, which is actually in Brazil.

===Peru===

:The exact meaning behind the word &quot;Peru&quot; is obscure. The most popular theory derives it from the native word &quot;biru&quot;, meaning &quot;river&quot; (compare with the River Biru in modern Ecuador). Another explanation claims that it comes from the name of the Indigenous chieftain Beru. Spanish explorers asked him the name of the land, but not understanding their language, he assumed they wanted his own name, which he gave them. Another possible origin is &quot;pelu&quot;, presumptively an old native name of the region.

===Philippines===

:&quot;Lands of Prince Philip of Asturias&quot;, from the Spanish &quot;Felipinas&quot;, honoring the future King Philip II of Spain, bestowed on the islands of Leyte and Samar by the explorer Ruy López de Villalobos in 1543 and later extended to refer to the entire archipelago. Philip&#x27;s name itself is Greek (, &quot;Phílippos&quot;) and means &quot;lover of horses&quot;.
::Ma-i, a former name: From the Mandarin pronunciation &quot;Máyì&quot; of the Chinese characters used by Cantonese traders to spell &quot;Ma-yat&quot; and Zaytonese traders to spell &quot;Ma-it&quot;, sinicizations of a local prehistoric state (probably on Mindoro or Laguna) recorded by the Sultanate of Brunei as &quot;Maidh&quot;.
::St. Lazarus Islands, a former name: from the Spanish name &quot;Las islas de San Lázaro&quot; bestowed by Ferdinand Magellan in 1521 upon reaching Homonhon on the feast of St. Lazarus of Bethany.
::Islands of the West, a former name: from the Spanish name &quot;Las islas de Poniente&quot;, adopted in order to assert their ownership by Spain under the terms of the Treaty of Tordesillas; the Portuguese, who (correctly, as it happens) felt the islands fell within their sphere, instead called them &quot;Ilhas do oriente&quot; (&quot;Islands of the East&quot;). As the problem of longitude had not been solved, and as the islands had no spice to attract conflict, López de Legazpi successfully colonized the islands for Philip II in 1565.
::Katagalugan, an alternate name: &quot;Land of the river dwellers&quot;, used by the Katipunan, originally in reference to the Tagalog-speaking areas only.

===Poland===

:&quot;Land of Polans&quot;, the territory of the tribe of Polans (&quot;Polanie&quot;). When the Polans formed a united Poland in the 10th century, this name also came into use for the whole Polish country. The name &quot;Poland&quot; (&quot;Polska&quot;) expressed both meanings until, in the 13th/14th century, the original territory of the Polans became known as Greater Poland (&quot;Wielkopolska&quot;) instead. The name of the tribe comes probably from Polish &quot;pole&quot;: &quot;field&quot; or &quot;open field&quot;.
::&quot;Lengyelország&quot; (Hungarian), &quot;Lenkija&quot; (Lithuanian), لهستان &quot;Lahestân&quot; (Persian) all derive from the Old Ruthenian or Old Polish ethnonym &quot;lęděnin&quot; (possibly &quot;man ploughing virgin soil&quot;, &quot;pioneer&quot;) and its augmentative &quot;lęch&quot;.

===Portugal===

:From medieval Romance &quot;Portucale&quot;, from Latin Portus Cale (modern Porto and Gaia). &quot;Portus&quot; is the Latin for &quot;port&quot;, but the meaning of &quot;Cale&quot; is debated. Some derive it from the Greek &quot;kallis&quot; (καλλἰς, &quot;beautiful&quot;) or the Latin &quot;calēre&quot; (&quot;to heat&quot;). It likely was related to the Gallaeci, a Celtic people who lived nearby north of the Douro River in pre-Roman times. The etymology of their name is also unknown, but may have been related to the divine hag Cailleach.
:*Lusitania (ancient predecessor and literary variant): after the Lusitanians, probably of Celtic origin, as &quot;Lus&quot; and &quot;Tanus&quot;, &quot;tribe of Lusus&quot;.

==Q==

===Qatar===

:Derives from &quot;Qatara&quot;, believed to refer to the Qatari town of Zubara, an important trading port and town in the region in ancient times. The word &quot;Qatara&quot; first appeared on Ptolemy&#x27;s map of the Arab world. In the early 20th century, English speakers often pronounced Qatar as &quot;Cutter&quot;, close to the local pronunciation in Qatar. However, the traditional English pronunciation (&quot;Kuh-tahr&quot;) has prevailed.

==R==

===Romania===

:&quot;Roman Realm&quot;. The Roman Empire conquered a large part of the country, and the inhabitants became Romanized (Romanians). Older variants of the name include &quot;Rumania&quot; and (in a French-influenced spelling) &quot;Roumania&quot;. The term (the ethnic group of Romanians) comes from the Latin term , which means Roman, so the name Romania was adopted to accentuate the Latin origin of Romanian people and language. The term was first used during the leadership of Carol I, whose 1866 constitution declared &quot;Romania&quot; the country&#x27;s official name.

The Portuguese explorer Pedro de Sintra named the country after the striking mountains that he saw in 1462 while sailing the West African coast.

The first cites the Arabic &quot;&#x27;ajam&quot; (&quot;foreigner, non-Arab&quot;). The second references the Greek verb &quot;azainein&quot; (&quot;to dry, parch&quot;), which fits the identification of Azania with arid sub-Saharan Africa.

::Ratcha Anachak Thai (), endonym, meaning &quot;Royal Domain of Thailand&quot;
::Siam (, &quot;Sayam&quot;), a former name, of uncertain etymology. One theory holds it derives from the Pāli toponym &quot;Suvarnabhumi&quot; (, &quot;Land of Gold&quot;). Another traces it – along with the Shan and A-hom – from Sanskrit &quot;Śyâma&quot; (, &quot;dark&quot;).

:&quot;Home (&quot;stān&quot;) of the Turkmens&quot;, an ethnic group whose name derives from the Sogdian (&quot;Turk-like&quot;), in reference to their status outside the Turkic dynastic mythological system. However, modern scholars sometimes prefer to see the suffix as an intensifier, changing the meaning to &quot;pure Turk&quot; or &quot;most Turk-like of the Turks&quot;.

::Britain, an alternate name: From Latin &quot;Britannia&quot;, probably via French or Welsh (), from &quot;Pretani&quot; (&quot;painted ones&quot;), probably in reference to the use of woad body-paint and tattoos by early inhabitants of the islands, although it may derive from the Celtic goddess Brigid. A traditional pseudoetymology mentioned by Geoffrey of Monmouth traced the name to the Trojan exile Brutus.
::Great Britain, an alternate name: &quot;Larger Britain&quot;, from Mediaeval Latin &quot;Britannia Maior&quot;, first recorded by Geoffrey of Monmouth, who employed it to distinguish the island from &quot;Britannia Minor&quot; (&quot;Little Britain&quot;), or Brittany in modern France. In classical times, the Graeco-Roman geographer Ptolemy in his &quot;Almagest&quot; also called the island &quot;megale Brettania&quot; (great Britain), contrasting it at that time to the smaller island of Ireland, which he called &quot;mikra Brettania&quot; (little Britain).

===United States===
:Self-descriptive, although note that – similar to the original &quot;united Kingdom of Great Britain&quot; above – the U.S. Declaration of Independence described the new nation as the (lower-case) &quot;united States of America&quot;. The adjective had become a part of the name by the time of the adoption of the United States Constitution, however, whose preamble describes the &quot;United States&quot;. Similarly, the grammatical number of the name has changed over time: common usage before the American Civil War was to reference &quot;these United States&quot; whereas modern usage has &quot;the United States&quot;.

The name of the hill itself came from the Latin &quot;Mons Vaticanus&quot;, from the name of the surrounding lands &quot;ager vaticanus&quot;, from the verb &quot;vaticinari&quot; (&quot;to prophesy&quot;), in reference to the fortune-tellers and soothsayers who used the streets in the area during Roman times.
::Papal States, a former name: loosely translated from the Italian &quot;Stati Pontifici&quot; and Latin &quot;Status Pontificius&quot; (&quot;Pontifical States&quot;). The name is usually plural both to denote its various holdings – the former Duchies of Rome and Pontecorvo, the former Principality of Benevento, the March of Ancona, Bologna, Romagna, and the Campagne and Maritime Province continued to be administered separately despite forming a unified state – and to distinguish this realm from the current country. &quot;Papal&quot; from Latin &quot;papa&quot; (&quot;father&quot;), borrowed by the Bishop of Rome from the Pope of Alexandria to denote his leadership over the church. &quot;State&quot; distinguished this realm and its administration from the church and papacy&#x27;s lands in other realms and from the administration of the church itself.

The title &quot;pontiff&quot;, from Latin &quot;pontifex&quot;, was carried over from the Romans&#x27; &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;, a high priest whose name is generally understood to mean &quot;bridge-maker&quot; (&quot;pons&quot; + &quot;-fex&quot;, &quot;builder&quot;, &quot;maker&quot;, from &quot;facio&quot;, &quot;build&quot;, &quot;make&quot;).
::States of the Church, a former name: translated from the Italian &quot;Stati della Chiesa&quot;. The name was plural to denote the various holdings united under the Papacy and distinguish it from the modern state. &quot;Chiesa&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;ecclesia&quot;, from the Ancient Greek &quot;ékklēsía&quot; (, &quot;church&quot;, originally &quot;assembly&quot;), from &quot;ekklētos&quot; (&quot;called out&quot;) from &quot;ekkalein&quot; (, a compound of &quot;ek-&quot;, &quot;out&quot;, and &quot;kalein&quot;, &quot;call&quot;).

===Vietnam===

:&quot;Viet South&quot; (), an inversion of Nam Việt (), the name of the 2nd-century BC kingdom. The qualifier &quot;nam&quot; (south) was added to distinguish this kingdom from other Viet, or Yue, kingdoms, such as Minyue. The word &quot;Viet&quot; is a shortened form of (), which in early usage applied to a people in Guangdong. Ancient historian Sima Qian wrote that Wu Qi of Chu went &quot;south to suppress the Bai Yue&quot; in 368 B.C. The first recorded usage is in the Chinese encyclopedia &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot;, compiled around 239 B.C. After Vietnam gained independence in 938, several variations on the word Viet, including &quot;Nam Viet&quot; and &quot;Dai Viet&quot; (Great Viet), were used officially. The name &quot;Vietnam&quot; is first recorded in a 16th-century poem by Nguyen Binh Khiem. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the country was usually referred to as Annam (&quot;Pacified South&quot;, ). &quot;Vietnam&quot; was revived by Phan Bội Châu&#x27;s book &quot;Việt Nam vong quốc sử&quot; (History of the Loss of Vietnam), published in 1905, and later by the Viet Quoc, a nationalist party which organized the Yen Bai mutiny against the French colonial authorities in 1930. In 1945, the name was adopted officially by both Bao Dai&#x27;s imperial government in Hue and by Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s Viet Minh government in Hanoi.

<text>A bacteriostatic agent or bacteriostat, abbreviated Bstatic, is a biological or chemical agent that stops bacteria from reproducing, while not necessarily killing them otherwise. Depending on their application, bacteriostatic antibiotics, disinfectants, antiseptics and preservatives can be distinguished. When bacteriostatic antimicrobials are used, the duration of therapy must be sufficient to allow host defense mechanisms to eradicate the bacteria. Upon removal of the bacteriostat, the bacteria usually start to grow rapidly. This is in contrast to bactericides, which kill bacteria.

Bacteriostats are often used in plastics to prevent growth of bacteria on surfaces. Bacteriostats commonly used in laboratory work include sodium azide (which is acutely toxic) and thiomersal.

==Bacteriostatic antibiotics==
Bacteriostatic antibiotics limit the growth of bacteria by interfering with bacterial protein production, DNA replication, or other aspects of bacterial cellular metabolism. They must work together with the immune system to remove the microorganisms from the body. However, there is not always a precise distinction between them and bactericidal antibiotics; high concentrations of some bacteriostatic agents are also bactericidal, whereas low concentrations of some bactericidal agents are bacteriostatic. This group includes:

<text>Victor Hasselblad AB is a Swedish manufacturer of medium format cameras, photographic equipment and image scanners based in Gothenburg, Sweden. The company originally became known for its classic analog medium-format cameras that used a waist-level viewfinder. Perhaps the most famous use of the Hasselblad camera was during the Apollo program missions when the first humans landed on the Moon. Almost all of the still photographs taken during these missions used modified Hasselblad cameras. In 2016, Hasselblad introduced the world&#x27;s first digital compact mirrorless medium-format camera, the X1D-50c, changing the portability of medium-format photography. Hasselblad produces about 10,000 cameras a year from a small three-storey building.

== Company history ==

The company was established in 1841 in Gothenburg, Sweden, by Fritz Wiktor Hasselblad, as a trading company, F. W. Hasselblad and Co. The founder&#x27;s son, Arvid Viktor Hasselblad, was interested in photography and started the photographic division of the company. Hasselblad&#x27;s corporate website quotes him as saying, &quot;I certainly don&#x27;t think that we will earn much money on this, but at least it will allow us to take pictures for free.&quot;

In 1877, Arvid Hasselblad commissioned the construction of Hasselblad&#x27;s long-time headquarters building, in use until 2002. While on honeymoon, Arvid Hasselblad met George Eastman, founder of Eastman Kodak. In 1888, Hasselblad became the sole Swedish distributor of Eastman&#x27;s products. The business was so successful that in 1908, the photographic operations were spun off into their own corporation, Fotografiska AB. Operations included a nationwide network of shops and photo labs. Management of the company eventually passed to Karl Erik Hasselblad, Arvid&#x27;s son (grandson of founder F. W.). Karl Erik wanted his son, Victor Hasselblad, to have a wide understanding of the camera business, and sent him to Dresden, Germany, then the world center of the optics industry, at age 18 (c. 1924).

Victor spent the next several years studying and working in various photography related endeavors in Europe and the US, including Rochester, New York, with George Eastman, before returning to work at the family business. Due to disputes within the family, particularly with his father, Victor left the business and in 1937 started his own photo store and lab in Gothenburg, Victor Foto.

===World War II===

During World War II, the Swedish military captured a fully functioning German aerial surveillance camera from a downed German plane. This was probably a Handkammer HK 12.5 cm/7x9, which bore the codename GXN and the military account number Fl.38510.

The Swedish government realised the strategic advantage of developing an aerial camera for their own use, and in the spring of 1940 approached Victor Hasselblad to help create one. In April 1940, Victor Hasselblad established a camera workshop in Gothenburg called Ross AB in a shed at an automobile shop, working in the evenings in cooperation with a mechanic from the shop and his brother, and began designing the HK7 camera.

By late 1941, the operation had over 20 employees and the Swedish Air Force asked for another camera, one which would have a larger negative and could be permanently mounted to an aircraft. This model was the SKa4. Between 1941 and 1945, Hasselblad delivered 342 cameras to the Swedish military.

In 1942, Karl Erik Hasselblad died and Victor took control of the family business. During the war, in addition to the military cameras, Hasselblad produced watch and clock parts, over 95,000 by the war&#x27;s end.

===Post-war===
After the war, watch and clock production continued, and other machine work was also carried out, including producing a slide projector and supplying parts for Saab automobiles.

The first successful commercial camera for Hasselblad, was the Hasselblad Universal camera, which was made by Szilárd Szabad. This camera was produced in over 1500+ units over a span of a few years, and quickly became the preferred all-around workhorse of the majority of professional Scandinavian photographers. It is perhaps the most important Hasselblad camera made, as it was what got Scandinavian professionals to move away from Kodak and Agfa, which had more or less 90% of the professional market at the time. 

Victor Hasselblad&#x27;s real ambition was to make high-quality civilian cameras. In 1945–1946, the first design drawings and wooden models were made for a camera to be called the Rossex. An internal design competition was held for elements of the camera; one of the winners was Sixten Sason, the designer of the original Saab bodywork.

In 1948, the camera later known as the 1600 F was released. The new design was complex, and many small improvements were needed to create a reliable product; the watchmaking background of many of the designers produced a design which was sophisticated, but more delicate than what was permissible for a camera. Only around 50 units were produced in 1949, and perhaps 220 in 1950, of what collectors have now designated the Series One camera. The Series Two versions of the 1600 F, perhaps as many as 3300 made from 1950 to 1953, were more reliable but still subject to frequent repairs, with many units having been cannibalized or modified by the factory. The biggest problem was its shutter, a focal-plane shutter that was hard to keep accurate. Using 120 size film it was formatted to a square cm or 2 × 2 inches, which meant there was no more need to turn the camera on its side.

In 1954, they mated the groundbreaking new 38 mm Biogon lens designed by Ludwig Bertele of Zeiss to a shallow non-reflex body to produce the SWA (supreme wide angle, later changed to super wide angle). Though a specialty product not intended to sell in large numbers, the SWA was an impressive achievement, and derivatives were sold for decades. Hasselblad took their two products to the 1954 photokina trade show in Germany, and word began to spread.

In 1953, a much-improved camera, the 1000 F was released. It too had a focal-plane shutter which led to its final replacement by the 500 C but nonetheless provided a big leg up in the medium format. It had a very fine 250 mm f4 Sonnar sport lens that made it a great wildlife camera. Lenses ranged from a 60 mm Distagon, standard 80 mm Planar, and on up to the 250 mm.

In December 1954, the 1000 F camera received a rave review from the influential American photography magazine, &quot;Modern Photography&quot;. They put over 500 rolls of film through their test unit, and intentionally dropped it twice, and it continued to function. But the 1000 F also had shutter problems and finally gave way to the lens-mounted, tried-and-true Compur shutter, retaining its focal-plane shutter/curtain only to mask the film until the Compur shutter closed, then opened to expose the film. This was a far more dependable system, even though it meant having a shutter in each lens.

=== Hasselblad camera comes into its own ===
The real turning point for the company occurred in 1957. The 1000 F was replaced by the 500 C. The landmark 500 C design formed the basis for Hasselblad&#x27;s product line for the next sixty years, with variants being produced until 2006. It was not until 1960, though, that Hasselblad&#x27;s cameras became profitable; prior to this point, the company was still being entirely supported by sales of imported photographic supplies, including their distribution of Kodak products.

In 1962, NASA began to use Hasselblad cameras on space flights, and to request design modifications. The first motor-driven camera, the 500 EL, appeared in 1965 as a result of NASA requests. While Hasselblad had enjoyed a slowly but steadily growing reputation among professional photographers through the 1950s, the publicity created by NASA&#x27;s use of Hasselblad products dramatically increased name recognition for the brand.

In 1966, with the increasing success of the camera division, Hasselblad exited the photographic supply and retailing industry, selling Hasselblad Fotografiska AB to Kodak.

=== 1970s onward ===

In 1976, Victor Hasselblad sold Hasselblad AB to a Swedish investment company, Säfveån AB. When he died in 1978, he left much of his fortune to the Hasselblad Foundation.

In 1977, the 2000 series of focal plane shutter equipped models was introduced. The 2000-series cameras had been intended to provide full exposure automation. The 2000 FC however was rushed and introduced without the automated features, partly because of a rethink about the way the automation should be accomplished (electronic vs. electro-mechanical). It was the last new camera produced during Victor Hasselblad&#x27;s lifetime.

In 1984, Victor Hasselblad AB went public, with 42.5% of the company being sold on the Swedish stock exchange. The next year, Swedish corporation Incentive AB bought 58.1% of Hasselblad, and in 1991, they acquired the remainder of the shares, taking VHAB back to being a private corporation.

In 1985 Hasselblad established the subsidiary, Hasselblad Electronic Imaging AB, to focus on digital imaging and transmission systems.

In 1991, the 200 series of automated focal plane shutter equipped models was introduced. This was the last major technical development in the course of the classic (now known as &quot;V-System&quot;, after Victor) Hasselblad camera.

In 1996, Hasselblad was sold, with the new owners being UBS, Cinven, and the Hasselblad management.

=== Fuji, Shriro, Imacon, and the digital age ===
In 1998, Hasselblad began selling the XPan, a camera designed and made in Japan by Fujifilm.

In 2002, they introduced the H-System, retroactively renaming their original camera line the V-System. The H-System marked an essential transition for the company. It dropped the traditional Hasselblad square negative format, instead using  cm film and a new series of lenses. The then owners had no confidence in Hasselblad&#x27;s already advanced digital project returning a profit, and, seeing the relative success in the market of the modern (i.e. fully automated) 645 cameras made by manufacturers like Pentax and Mamiya, closed down Hasselblad&#x27;s digital department and directed all effort towards making this 645 film camera. The H-System is largely designed and manufactured by Hasselblad, with Fuji&#x27;s involvement being limited to finalizing Hasselblad&#x27;s lens designs and producing the glass for the lenses and viewfinders. Fuji was allowed under the agreement to sell the H1 under their name in Japan only.

In January 2003, the Shriro Group acquired a majority shareholding in Hasselblad. The group had been the distributors for Hasselblad in Japan, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia for over 45 years.

The following year, in August 2004, Shriro Sweden, the holding company of Victor Hasselblad AB, and Swedish subsidiary of Shriro Group, announced the acquisition of high-end scanner and digital cameraback manufacturer, Imacon (established in 1995 to launch the Flextight scanners). The intent of the move was to correct the mistake the previous owners made when they thought there was no money to be made selling digital products and put a stop to Hasselblad&#x27;s own advanced digital project, and to renew Hasselblad&#x27;s ambitions in the professional digital photographic sector.

The move was perceived as part of an industry-wide move to respond to the trend away from film to digital. Christian Poulsen, chief executive of Hasselblad after the merger (previously founder and CEO of Imacon), said, &quot;They finally realized there was no future. It was impossible to keep Hasselblad alive without digital&quot;.

This has secured their market position, with nearly all of their previous medium format camera competition going through sale (Mamiya), closure (Contax, Bronica, Exakta 66, Kiev), or greatly reduced market presence (Rollei, Pentax—which was also sold to Hoya), and other medium format digital back makers being faced with accordingly restricted markets. Despite this Hasselblad has struggled to turn a profit relative to the market share leader Phase One.

On 30 June 2011, German private equity firm Ventizz announced it had acquired a 100% stake in Hasselblad.

In late 2015, Chinese aerial photography and drone manufacturer DJI acquired a minority interest in Hasselblad. In early January 2017 DJI acquired the majority stake. In August 2018, DJI announced Mavic 2 PRO, the first drone to carry a camera featuring the Hasselblad branding.

== In space ==

Several different models of Hasselblad cameras were taken into space, all specially modified for the task.

The Hasselblad cameras were selected by NASA because of their interchangeable lenses and magazines. Modifications were made to permit ease of use in cramped conditions while wearing spacesuits, such as the replacement of the reflex mirror with an eye-level finder.

Modifications by NASA technicians were further refined and incorporated into new models by Hasselblad. For example, development of a 70 mm magazine was accelerated to meet the space program.

The first modified (in fact simplified) Hasselblad 500 C cameras were used on the last two Project Mercury missions in 1962 and 1963. They continued to be used throughout the Gemini spaceflights in 1965 and 1966.

=== Apollo program ===

A general program of reliability and safety was implemented following the Apollo 1 fire in 1967, addressing such issues as reliability and safe operation of electrical equipment in a high-oxygen environment.

EL electric cameras were used for the first time on Apollo 8. A heavily modified 500 EL, the so-called Hasselblad Electric Camera (HEC) was used from Apollo 8 on board the spacecraft. Three 500 EL cameras were carried on Apollo 11. An even more extensively modified Hasselblad EL data camera (HDC), equipped with a special Zeiss 5.6/60 mm Biogon lens and film magazines for 150–200 exposures, was used on the Moon surface on the Apollo 11 mission. This command module camera, carried on Apollo 11, was a simplified version of the commercial Hasselblad 500 EL motorized film advance camera. Used for color still photography, it could operate in the command module or in the vacuum of space.

All subsequent NASA missions also had Hasselblad cameras on board. The photographic equipment and films used on the five subsequent flights were similar to that taken on Apollo 11. On Apollo 15, the 500 mm telelens was added. During the Space Shuttle period cameras based on the 500 EL/M, 553 ELX, 205 TCC and 203 FE were used.

There are 11 Hasselblad cameras currently sitting on the lunar surface, where only the film magazines were brought back to Earth.

====HK-7 and SKa4 military cameras====
The HK-7 put a 7 cm tall by 9 cm wide image on 80 mm film. It has interchangeable lenses, generally a 135 mm Zeiss Biotessar, with the second being either a 240 mm f/4 Meyer Tele-Megor or a 250 mm f/5 Schneider Tele-Xenar.

The SKa4 has interchangeable film magazines, a key feature of later Hasselblad cameras.

==== 1600F and 1000F ====

Hasselblad&#x27;s first civilian camera was launched in 1948. Born from the idea of Victor Hasselblad to create the &quot;ideal camera&quot;, it was a 6 × 6 cm format focal-plane shutter SLR camera that was six inches long. First simply known as the &quot;Hasselblad Camera&quot; it was later named &quot;1600F&quot; after its highest shutter speed of 1/1600 s and &quot;F&quot; for &quot;focal plane&quot;. The camera was revolutionary for the time with its modular design that allowed exchanging lenses, viewfinders and film magazines. The shutter was made of thin stainless steel which was light and durable enough to withstand the high acceleration forces of this fast shutter.

The 1600F cameras did show a couple of problems (especially the first series) so a number of changes were introduced during the production period that lasted from 1949 to 1953. The 1600F was initially released with the Kodak Ektar 2.8/80 mm and the Ektar 3.5/135 mm lenses. Only prototypes were made of the Ektar 6.3/55 mm and the 5.6/254 mm lenses.

The successor of the 1600F was the 1000F (1953–1957). The 1000F was named after its reduced shortest shutter speed of 1/1000 s. The 1000F has a different shutter mechanism and proved to be more reliable and robust than its predecessor. During production of the 1600F, Carl Zeiss in Oberkochen had become a supplier of lenses for the 1600F/1000F cameras. Zeiss supplied the lenses Distagon 5.6/60 mm, Tessar 2.8/80 mm, Sonnar 3.5/135, Sonnar 4.0/250 and Sonnar 5.6/250 mm. Towards the end of the 1000 F production period a Dallmeyer 5.6/508 mm lens made by Cook and Perkins, England, was also available, but did not fully cover the full film format.

Hasselblad 1000F and especially 1600F cameras are very rare on the secondhand market and usually not in working condition because of age, neglect, and a lack of spare parts and qualified repairmen. Many cameras suffer from corrosion of the chrome rims. A lot of lenses suffer from scratches, fungus, discoloration and separation. Cameras in good condition can therefore fetch fairly high prices.

The 500C was produced to replace the F-series cameras. It changed the troublesome focal plane shutter for a leaf shutter in each C lens. The camera has continued for over 40 years with only minor improvements. A variation of the 500C was used by NASA for all their Gemini and Apollo missions. Most lenses were made by Zeiss in Germany but the very early 1600F lenses were made by Kodak.

The name &quot;V System&quot; was not created until the development of the &quot;H System&quot;; with a new system premiering, Hasselblad needed a designation to differentiate the older product line.
The Hasselblad V-System evolved out of Victor Hasselblad&#x27;s desire to develop a small camera with fast lenses and shutters, that was as easily hand-holdable as a Leica, but with a larger film format. The Rolleiflex&#x27;s format was deemed ideal: large enough to provide high image quality, but small enough to fit inside a compact camera. The Rolleiflex&#x27;s leaf shutter lacked the fast shutter speeds focal plane shutters could provide, and neither Leica rangefinder nor Rolleiflex TLR provided the(TTL) through the (taking) lens viewing that the slow to use, big Graflex SLR provided.
These considerations led to the 1600 F and a flexible camera system that includes interchangeable bodies, lenses, viewfinders, winders, film magazines and holders, and other accessories. Problems with the focal plane shutters in the 1600 F and 1000 F cameras and especially the increasing importance of electronic flash led to the development of the manual leaf shutter-based medium-format ( cm or inches) 500 C SLR camera in 1957 which offered flash synchronization at all shutter speeds. The 500 C was joined by the motor-driven 500 EL SLR camera in 1964. Apart from the housing that incorporates the motor drive and the NiCd batteries, this camera is similar in appearance and operation to the Hasselblad 500 C and uses the same magazines, lenses and viewfinders. These two cameras, together with the Superwide Camera (SWC) which was introduced in 1954 as a wide angle camera using the Carl Zeiss Biogon 38 mm f/4.5 lens and built-in levels for exacting architecture photography, formed the core of the V-system and shared most accessories (with a few exceptions).

Throughout the life of the V Series, Hasselblad incrementally updated the cameras. The 500C gave way to the 500C/M, the 503CX and 503CXi, the 501C and 501CM, and finally the 503CW as the basic manual. The SWC was replaced by the SWC/M, the 903 SWC, and finally by the 905 SWC. The 500 EL&#x27;s replacements included the 500EL/M, 500ELX, 553 ELX, and the 555ELD. First introduced in the 500ELX, TTL/OTF (through the lens/off the film) flash metering was also a feature of the 503CX, which was replaced by the 503CXi and finally the 503CW. The 503CWD was the very last iteration of the V-series line and was a limited edition variant produced in 2006 to commemorate the centenary of the birth of Victor Hasselblad (born 1906). The 503CWD was supplied with a match-numbered CFV-16 digital back. The entire production run was limited to only 500 units, all numbered. However, the universal models can choose phase one or leaf if they prefer to have a digital medium format back. Some people also modified fuji instax film camera to be the back holding instax films.

The V system of cameras are modular with interchangeable lenses and backs. The interchangeable film backs were originally designed to accommodate medium format film (220 &amp; 120) and supported various aspect ratios, e.g. 6X6, 6X4.5, etc. and were also available as Polaroid film backs and for 70mm film. The viewfinders were also designed to be fully modular with interchange able focusing screens, waist-level finders, sports finders as well as eye-level prism finders that were offered in 90 and 45 degrees for ease of use. 

Alongside the 500-series cameras, a series of focal plane shutter cameras was introduced. This 2000-series started with the 2000 FC, and progressed to the 2000 FC/M, 2000 FCW and 2003 FCW. Though much of the 20 years between the discontinuation of the 1000F and the introduction of the 2000 FC was spent designing an improved focal plane shutter, the 2000-series again used corrugated metal foil as material for the shutter curtains, though now titanium replaced the original stainless steel. As before, the metal shutter curtains proved to be quite easily damaged by clumsy fingers, which is why all 2000-series cameras except the 2000FC have a safety feature that retracts the shutter curtains as soon as the magazine is taken off. The 2000-series cameras were replaced by the 200-series cameras (with rubberized cloth shutter curtains), which included the 201 F, 202 FA, 203 FE, and 205 TCC/205 FCC. While the 201 F was a manual control camera, the other three 200-series models added a level of metering and exposure automation to the V series.

There were also two series of medium format view cameras developed related to the V series: the FlexBody and the ArcBody.

The last V System camera, the 503CW, was officially discontinued on April 29, 2013. In 2014, Hasselblad introduced the CFV-50c back, which uses a digital image sensor and is compatible with V system cameras; the sensor is the same one supplied with the H5D-50c digital SLR and has an active area of , so using the CFV-50c back with V system lenses will result in a crop factor for equivalent focal length. The CFV back subsequently has been updated with different sensors in 2019 (CFV II 50C) and 2024 (CFV 100C), retaining the same sensor size.

500EL and its successors have been, and still are, used mainly as workhorses in photo studios. A heavily modified version was used in the U.S. Apollo lunar exploration program. In 1968, it was used by astronaut William Anders to take the image known as &quot;Earthrise&quot;. As an outgrowth of the experience with NASA cameras, a photogrammetric version of the Hasselblad 500 EL/M, the Hasselblad MK 70, was constructed with specially calibrated components.

====XPan====
The dual-format XPan and XPan II were Hasselblad&#x27;s first cameras to use 35mm film. Built with a rubber-covered titanium and aluminium body, they were designed as a coupled rangefinder camera with interchangeable, compact lenses.

The XPan cameras are re-branded versions of the Fuji TX-1 and TX-2. The XPan II has every feature of the original, but grants the user the ability to record thirty-minute exposures compared to the old limit of three minutes. Electronic exposure information in the viewfinder is another additional feature of the XPan II.

The XPan reverted to the focal plane shutter, offering 8–1/1000 s, and flash sync from B (max. 270 s) – 1/125 s.

The intent in releasing the XPan was to provide medium format image quality on 35mm film. The XPan utilised the entire area of the 35mm film for either panorama or 35mm format, providing a panorama effect without masking the film or reducing image quality. This technique produced a panorama negative almost three times larger than traditional masking and over five times larger than that of APS cameras.

The XPan is now discontinued.
* XPan (1998, focal plane shutter, 35mm, Panoramic capability)
* XPan II (2003, focal plane shutter, 35mm, Panoramic capability)

====H System====

Hasselblad launched the H System at photokina in September 2002.

=====H1=====
The H1 departed from previous Hasselblad cameras in several respects. Hasselblad moved away from the traditional format to  cm, and included autofocus lenses.

The camera used Fujinon manufactured lenses and prisms, thus departing from Hasselblad&#x27;s long association with Carl Zeiss when it comes to lens manufacturing.
The shutter in the lenses was still manufactured by Hasselblad as well as the body. Hasselblad initially invited both PhaseOne and Kodak to develop digital backs for the H-System.

The H1 had a number of other innovations, including:
* replacement of the removable dark slide with a fold-out lever
* inserts and backs that could accept both 120 and 220 film
* automatic film advance
* digital back integration
* electronic leaf shutters with timing from 1/800 seconds down to 18 hours

As with the V-series, most H1- and H2-series components were compatible with one another.

=====H1D=====
Identical to the H1, but sold bundled with a Hasselblad-branded Imacon 22Mp iXpress back which coupled with a 40 GB Image Bank allowed shooting of up to 850 images in one session.
The camera could only be used with the included digital back. This was Hasselblad&#x27;s first integrated DSLR.

=====H2=====
Hasselblad has built into the H2 cross-platform camera a new single-battery operation of the camera with the new Ixpress CFH digital back, offering one on/off switch and one operating system, facilitating streamlined, integrated operation. With existing digital backs already in the market, the H2 delivers the exact functionality of the H1.
The H2 camera was discontinued in October 2007.

=====H2D=====
2nd generation integrated DSLR. First Hasselblad camera to shoot to new Raw format called the 3FR. Conversions to 3F files could be done in Flexcolor or Phocus.
Can utilize a CF card. No longer necessary to shoot to an Image Bank via link cable. Firewire 800 capable.
New metering patterns to match the larger sensors. A new lithium ion 1,850 mAh battery was introduced that would power both the H2D body and digital back.

=====H2F=====
The H2F can be used either as a film camera or as a digital camera when mated with a Hasselblad CF31, CF22, CF22 MS, CF39, or CF39 MS back. It is completely identical to the H2, but this camera was created to &quot;lock out&quot; other digital back providers from the H-series platform. The H2F is compatible with all of the H lenses, including the HCD 24mm, HCD 28mm, and the new HCD 35-90mm zoom lens.

=====H3D=====
3rd generation integrated DSLR. The H3D offered software functionality that provided better integration between camera, viewfinder and back than the earlier H1 or H2 could provide. These two early H-System cameras, after all, were not primarily designed as digital cameras, with the H2 carrying the &#x27;legacy&#x27; of the H1. Hasselblad&#x27;s official position on the move was:

&quot;In truth, [the H1] was a great film camera to which a digital back could be fitted, and...Hasselblad started to look at ways that image quality and functionality could be enhanced even more through better integration...The H2 camera has not, in any way, been diminished by Hasselblad&#x27;s separate development of functions specifically for the integrated H3D. However, lacking the necessary integration of the new camera engine and Hasselblad Flexcolor software, these functions cannot work on the H2.&quot;

=====H3DII=====
4th generation integrated DSLR. Introduced in 2007, the H3DII systems have a higher level of integration between the camera and the image sensor than stand-alone digital camera backs, but a disadvantage is that film backs are not usable in the H3DII. Improvements of the HD3DII line were:

* larger and improved 3&quot; TFT display
* new heat sink replaces the fan from the original H3D, making the digital back quieter
* drive button is now WB/ISO. Drive functions moved in the Menu
* new ability to use the GIL (Global Image Locator)

The current H3DII products include:

=====H4D=====
5th generation integrated DSLR. Introduced in 2009, the current H4D products include H4D-31, H4D-40, H4D-50, H4D-50MS, H4D-60 and H4D-200MS.

=====H4X=====
On October 27, 2011, Hasselblad introduced the H4X as a replacement H1, H2 and H2F.

=====H5D=====
6th generation integrated DSLR. Introduced in 2012, the current H5D products include H5D-40, H5D-50, H5D-50MS, H5D-60 and H5D-200MS. 
=====H5D-50C=====
In January 2014, Hasselblad introduced the H5D-50C

=====H5X=====
On September 9, 2014, Hasselblad introduced the H5X as a replacement H1, H2, H2F and H4X. Improvements of the H5X were:

* backup camera for H5D users
* True Focus
* full HC and HCD lens compatibility, including HCD-24, HCD-28 and the HCD 35-90 zoom lens
* HVD-90x viewfinder optimised for 36x48 mm format
* HV-90x-II viewfinder optimised for the film and format
* high power AF illumination
* eight memory banks (profiles) for easier access to previously saved camera settings
* new programmable button options available with an H5D sensor unit

=====H5D-50C WiFi=====
On September 16, 2014, Hasselblad introduced the H5D-50C WiFi.

===== H6D-50c, H6D-100c, and H6D-400c MS =====
In April 2016, Hasselblad introduced the H6D product line. The current H6D products include H6D-50c, H6D-100c, and H6D-400c MS.

===== H6D-400c MS =====
This camera is a variant of the H6D-100c with the ability to shift the sensor by a sequence of full and half pixel movements in sync with multiple captures to improve both colour rendition and to extrapolate a higher resolution. This method, designated by the suffix MS, i.e. &quot;Multi-shot&quot;, is commonly known as &quot;pixel shifting&quot;). However it is not a true 400 megapixel camera as the name might suggest.

====X System====
The X System is a line of relatively compact mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras built around a medium format sensor; the same sensor size was adopted by Fujifilm for its GFX line, which competes with the X system. The first camera, the X1D, was announced in June 2016; it was followed by the X1D II 50C (June 2019) and the X2D 100c (September 2022). Also in 2019, Hasselblad introduced the CFV II 50C, an updated CFV-50c back which is compatible with V system cameras, using the same digital sensor as the X1D II 50C, alongside the 907X, a new modular body which is designed to accept the CFV and X system lenses. Likewise, the CFV 100C was released in 2024, using the same sensor as the X2D.

Along with the cameras, Hasselblad released a new &quot;XCD&quot; lens mount which is specifically designed for a smaller flange distance compared to the larger &quot;HCD&quot; lens mount. The company sells an additional adapter to mount HCD lenses onto XCD lens mounts while retaining autofocus capabilities. At the time of launch, two lenses were available, a 45mm and a 90mm option. there are fifteen lenses available ranging from a 21mm focal length wide angle lens to a 135mm focal length short telephoto lens. Hasselblad also produces a single zoom lens with a focal length range of 35 to 75mm.

===== X1D-50c =====
In June 2016, Hasselblad announced the X1D-50c, the first of a new line of medium format mirrorless cameras. The X1D is comparable in size to current full-frame digital SLRs, but is equipped with a 43.8 x 32.9 mm CMOS sensor. The camera uses a new XCD mount, with two lenses initially available for sale. At the same time, an H Mount adapter was announced, allowing H System Lenses to be used with full autofocus. Currently, there are fifteen XCD Lenses available. Hasselblad announced the X1D II 50C in June 2019, an upgraded variant of the original camera with the exact same sensor but faster electronics and a lower price point. The body color was changed from silver on the original X1D to a gunmetal color on the X1D II, and the grip material was changed as well. 

===== X2D 100C =====

Hasselblad launched the 100 megapixel X2D 100C in September 2022, with better AF, IBIS, a revised design and three new X system lenses.

===Lenses===

Hasselblad has marketed lenses made by several different manufacturers for its camera bodies, primarily designed and built by Carl Zeiss AG, but other lens manufacturers have included Fujifilm, Kodak, Rodenstock, and Schneider Kreuznach.

===Scanners===
When Hasselblad merged with Imacon in 2004, it acquired Imacon&#x27;s existing range of Flextight scanners. In 2006, Hasselblad launched two additional Flextight models, the X1 and the X5.
* The X1 had the ability to scan positive/negative film at 6300 dpi optical resolution, and a 60 MB/minute scan speed.
* The X5 added A4 reflective scanning, a batch / slide feeder, active cooling to keep noise down, 8000 dpi optical resolution, and a 300 MB/minute scan speed.

===Phocus (software)===

Hasselblad also produces its own advanced image processing software called &quot;Phocus&quot;. The latest version of Phocus is available on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X, and by taking advantage of the operating system&#x27;s raw image format library, the Mac OS X version of Phocus supports raw image formats from other DSLR manufacturers. Phocus is available as a free download from the Hasselblad homepage.

In 2010, Hasselblad announced that future Windows versions of Phocus will not provide raw file support for 3rd-party cameras.

==== Phocus Mobile 2 ====
In June 2019, Hasselblad announced the new Phocus Mobile 2, enabling a more portable workflow via USB-C and Wi-Fi connection for the traveling photographer. With Phocus Mobile 2, users can import, edit and rate RAW images and import and rate full quality JPEG images directly on their iPad Pro or iPad Air 2019 model. In addition, Phocus Mobile 2 supports full quality image export, tethered shooting and direct camera control.

==Collaborations==
=== Sony ===

In 2012 Hasselblad began marketing redesigned versions of Sony digital cameras.

At the 2012 photokina trade show in Germany, Hasselblad announced it would release a new mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera (MILC) using the Sony E-mount. The camera, called the Lunar, is based on the Sony NEX-7, including its 24.3 MP APS-C sensor, processing engine and user interface. The Lunar, which is marketed as an &quot;ultimate luxury&quot; model, was released in summer 2013.

On 23 July 2013 Hasselblad announced the Stellar, a &quot;luxury&quot; compact digital camera based on the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX100.

On 3 February 2014, Hasselblad introduced a restyled Sony α99 as the Hasselblad HV. According to the company&#x27;s press-release, their version of the α99 is &quot;tough as nails&quot;, featuring more robust construction than the original.

On 26 November 2014, Hasselblad announced the Stellar II based on the DSC-RX100M2. No further rebranded Sony products have been released by Hasselblad.

Unlike Leica in a similar partnership with Panasonic, Hasselblad did not make claims of reprogrammed image processing. The company, however, used the same marketing strategy, selling the OEM cameras under their brand at the prices two or three times higher than those of the original Sony cameras.

=== Mobile phones (OnePlus and Oppo) ===
On 8 March 2021, OnePlus announced a $150 million deal with Hasselblad to develop camera technology for OnePlus. The OnePlus 9 series are the first smartphones that included improved cameras made in partnership with Hasselblad.

In February 2022, Oppo announced a three-year partnership with Hasselblad, to co-develop industry-leading camera technologies for Oppo&#x27;s flagship Find X series. The triple-camera 5G handset Oppo Find X5 uses Hasselblad technology for the first time on an Oppo device, followed by the series&#x27; successors the Oppo Find X6 and the Oppo Find X7.

== Company publications ==
Hasselblad published the &quot;Hasselblad Forum&quot; until 2007, and it was replaced by the new large-format journal, &quot;Victor&quot;. &quot;Victor&quot; is available online as PDF, but registration is required.

<doc id="153833" wikidata="Q191503" url="?curid=153833" title="Duel">
<text>A duel is an arranged engagement in combat between two people with matched weapons.

During the 17th and 18th centuries (and earlier), duels were mostly single combats fought with swords (the rapier and later the small sword), but beginning in the late 18th century in England, duels were more commonly fought using pistols. Fencing and shooting continued to coexist throughout the 19th century.

The duel was based on a code of honor. Duels were fought not to kill the opponent but to gain &quot;satisfaction&quot;, that is, to restore one&#x27;s honor by demonstrating a willingness to risk one&#x27;s life for it. As such, the tradition of dueling was reserved for the male members of nobility; however, in the modern era, it extended to those of the upper classes. On occasion, duels with swords or pistols were fought between women.

Legislation against dueling dates back to the medieval period. The Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215) outlawed duels and civil legislation in the Holy Roman Empire against dueling was passed in the wake of the Thirty Years&#x27; War.
From the early 17th century, duels became illegal in the countries where they were practiced. Dueling largely fell out of favour in England by the mid-19th century and in Continental Europe by the turn of the 20th century. Dueling declined in the Eastern United States in the 19th century and by the time of the American Civil War, dueling had begun to wane even in the
South. Public opinion, not legislation, caused the change. Research has linked the decline of dueling to increases in state capacity.

==History==

===Early history and Middle Ages===

In Western society, the formal concept of a duel developed out of the medieval judicial duel and older pre-Christian practices such as the Viking Age &quot;holmgang&quot;. In medieval society, judicial duels were fought by knights and squires to end various disputes. Countries such as France, Germany, England, and Ireland practiced this tradition. Judicial combat took two forms in medieval society, the feat of arms and chivalric combat. The feat of arms was used to settle hostilities between two large parties and supervised by a judge. The battle was fought as a result of a slight or challenge to one party&#x27;s honor which could not be resolved by a court. Weapons were standardized and typical of a knight&#x27;s armoury, for example longswords or polearms; however, weapon quality and augmentations were at the discretion of the knight; for example, a spiked hand guard or an extra grip for half-swording. The parties involved would wear their own armour; for example, one knight wearing full plate might face another wearing chain mail. The duel lasted until one party could no longer fight back. In early cases, the defeated party was then executed. This type of duel soon evolved into the more chivalric &quot;pas d&#x27;armes,&quot; or &quot;passage of arms&quot;, a chivalric hastilude that evolved in the late 14th century and remained popular through the 15th century. A knight or group of knights ( or &quot;holders&quot;) would stake out a travelled spot, such as a bridge or city gate, and let it be known that any other knight who wished to pass ( or &quot;comers&quot;) must first fight, or be disgraced. If a traveling did not have weapons or horse to meet the challenge, one might be provided, and if the chose not to fight, he would leave his spurs behind as a sign of humiliation. If a lady passed unescorted, she would leave behind a glove or scarf, to be rescued and returned to her by a future knight who passed that way.

The Catholic Church was critical of dueling throughout medieval history, frowning both on the traditions of judicial combat and on the duel on points of honor among the nobility. Judicial duels were deprecated by the Lateran Council of 1215, but the judicial duel persisted in the Holy Roman Empire into the 15th century. The word duel comes from the Latin &quot;duellum&quot;, cognate with &quot;bellum&quot;, meaning &#x27;war&#x27;.

===Renaissance and early modern Europe===
During the early Renaissance, dueling established the status of a respectable gentleman and was an accepted manner to resolve disputes. 

The first published &quot;code duello&quot;, or &quot;code of dueling&quot;, appeared in Renaissance Italy. The first formalized national code was that of France, during the Renaissance. From the late 1580s to the 1620s, an estimated 10,000 French individuals (most of them nobility) were killed in duels.

By the 17th century, dueling had become regarded as a prerogative of the aristocracy, throughout Europe, and attempts to discourage or suppress it generally failed. For example, King Louis XIII of France outlawed dueling in 1626, a law which remained in force afterwards, and his successor Louis XIV intensified efforts to wipe out the duel. Despite these efforts, dueling continued unabated, and it is estimated that between 1685 and 1716, French officers fought 10,000 duels, leading to over 400 deaths.

In Ireland, as late as 1777, a code of practice was drawn up for the regulation of duels, at the Summer assizes in the town of Clonmel, County Tipperary. A copy of the code, known as &#x27;The twenty-six commandments&#x27;, was to be kept in a gentleman&#x27;s pistol case for reference should a dispute arise regarding procedure.

===Enlightenment-era opposition===
By the late 18th century, Enlightenment era values began to influence society with new self-conscious ideas about politeness, civil behavior, and new attitudes toward violence. The cultivated art of politeness demanded that there should be no outward displays of anger or violence, and the concept of honor became more personalized.

By the 1770s, the practice of dueling was increasingly coming under attack from many sections of enlightened society, as a violent relic of Europe&#x27;s medieval past unsuited for modern life. As England began to industrialize and benefit from urban planning and more effective police forces, the culture of street violence in general began to slowly wane. The growing middle class maintained their reputation with recourse to either bringing charges of libel, or to the fast-growing print media of the early 19th century, where they could defend their honor and resolve conflicts through correspondence in newspapers.

Influential new intellectual trends at the turn of the 19th century bolstered the anti-dueling campaign; the utilitarian philosophy of Jeremy Bentham stressed that praiseworthy actions were exclusively restricted to those that maximize human welfare and happiness, and the Evangelical notion of the &quot;Christian conscience&quot; began to actively promote social activism. Individuals in the Clapham Sect and similar societies, who had successfully campaigned for the abolition of slavery, condemned dueling as ungodly violence and as an egocentric culture of honor.

===Modern history===
The former United States Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton was killed in a duel against the sitting Vice President Aaron Burr in 1804. Between 1798 and the Civil War, the U.S. Navy lost two-thirds as many officers to dueling as it did in combat at sea, including naval hero Stephen Decatur. Many of those killed or wounded were midshipmen or junior officers. Despite prominent deaths, dueling persisted because of contemporary ideals of chivalry, particularly in the South, and because of the threat of ridicule if a challenge was rejected.

By about 1770, the duel underwent a number of important changes in England. Firstly, unlike their counterparts in many continental nations, English duelists enthusiastically adopted the pistol, and sword duels dwindled. Special sets of dueling pistols were crafted for the wealthiest of noblemen for this purpose. Also, the office of &#x27;second&#x27; developed into &#x27;seconds&#x27; or &#x27;friends&#x27; being chosen by the aggrieved parties to conduct their honor dispute. These friends would attempt to resolve a dispute upon terms acceptable to both parties and, should this fail, they would arrange and oversee the mechanics of the encounter.

In England, to kill in the course of a duel was formally judged as murder, but generally the courts were very lax in applying the law, as they were sympathetic to the culture of honor. Despite being a criminal act, military officers in many countries could be punished if they failed to fight a duel when the occasion called for it. In 1814, a British officer was court-martialed, cashiered, and dismissed from the army for failing to issue a challenge after he was publicly insulted. This attitude lingered on – Queen Victoria even expressed a hope that Lord Cardigan, prosecuted for wounding another in a duel, &quot;would get off easily&quot;. The Anglican Church was generally hostile to dueling, but non-conformist sects in particular began to actively campaign against it.

By 1840, dueling had declined dramatically; when the 7th Earl of Cardigan was acquitted on a legal technicality for homicide in connection with a duel with one of his former officers, outrage was expressed in the media, with &quot;The Times&quot; alleging that there was deliberate, high-level complicity to leave the loophole in the prosecution and reporting the view that &quot;in England there is one law for the rich and another for the poor,&quot; and &quot;The Examiner&quot; describing the verdict as &quot;a defeat of justice.&quot;

The last-known fatal duel between Englishmen in England occurred in 1845, when James Alexander Seton had an altercation with Henry Hawkey over the affections of his wife, leading to a duel at Browndown, near Gosport. However, the last-known fatal duel to occur in England was between two French political refugees, Frederic Cournet and Emmanuel Barthélemy near Englefield Green in 1852; the former was killed. In both cases, the winners of the duels, Hawkey and Barthélemy, were tried for murder. But Hawkey was acquitted and Barthélemy was convicted only of manslaughter; he served seven months in prison.
Dueling also began to be criticized in America in the late 18th century; Benjamin Franklin denounced the practice as uselessly violent, and George Washington encouraged his officers to refuse challenges during the American Revolutionary War because he believed that the death by dueling of officers would have threatened the success of the war effort.

In the early nineteenth century, American writer and activist John Neal took up dueling as his earliest reform issue, attacking the institution in his first novel, &quot;Keep Cool&quot; (1817) and referring to it in an essay that same year as &quot;the unqualified evidence of manhood&quot;. Ironically, Neal was challenged to a duel by a fellow Baltimore lawyer for insults published in his 1823 novel &quot;Randolph&quot;. He refused and mocked the challenge in his next novel, &quot;Errata&quot;, published the same year.

Reports of dueling gained in popularity in the first half of the 19th century especially in the South and the states of the Old Southwest. However, in this regional context, the term &quot;dueling&quot; had severely degenerated from its original 18th-century definition as a formal social custom among the wealthy classes, using fixed rules of conduct. Instead, &#x27;dueling&#x27; was used by the contemporary press of the day to refer to any melee knife or gun fight between two contestants, where the clear object was simply to kill one&#x27;s opponent.

Dueling began an irreversible decline in the aftermath of the Civil War. Even in the South, public opinion increasingly came to regard the practice as little more than bloodshed.

====Prominent 19th-century duels====

====United States====
The most notorious American duel is the Burr–Hamilton duel, in which notable Federalist and former Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton was fatally wounded by his political rival, the sitting Vice President of the United States Aaron Burr.

Another American politician, Andrew Jackson, later to serve as a General Officer in the U.S. Army and to become the seventh president, fought two duels, though some legends claim he fought many more. On May 30, 1806, he killed prominent duellist Charles Dickinson, suffering himself from a chest wound that caused him a lifetime of pain. Jackson also reportedly engaged in a bloodless duel with a lawyer and in 1803 came very near dueling with John Sevier. Jackson also engaged in a frontier brawl (not a duel) with Thomas Hart Benton in 1813.

In 1827, during the Sandbar Fight, James Bowie was involved in an arranged pistol duel that quickly escalated into a knife-fighting melee, not atypical of American practices at the time.

On September 22, 1842, future President Abraham Lincoln, at the time an Illinois state legislator, met to duel with state auditor James Shields, but friends intervened and persuaded them against it.

In 1864, American writer Mark Twain, then a contributor to the &quot;New York Sunday Mercury&quot;, narrowly avoided fighting a duel with a rival newspaper editor, apparently through the intervention of his second, who exaggerated Twain&#x27;s prowess with a pistol.

====France====
In 1808, two Frenchmen are said to have fought in balloons over Paris, each attempting to shoot and puncture the other&#x27;s balloon. One duellist is said to have been shot down and killed with his second.

On 30 May 1832, French mathematician Évariste Galois was mortally wounded in a duel at the age of twenty, cutting short his promising mathematical career. He spent the night before the duel writing mathematics; the inclusion of a note claiming that he did not have time to finish a proof spawned the urban legend that he wrote his most important results on that night.

In 1843, two Frenchmen are said to have fought a duel by means of throwing billiard balls at each other.

====Ireland====
Irish political leader Daniel O&#x27;Connell killed John D&#x27;Esterre in a duel in February 1815. O&#x27;Connel offered D&#x27;Esterre&#x27;s widow a pension equal to the amount her husband had been earning at the time, but the Corporation of Dublin, of which D&#x27;Esterre had been a member, rejected O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s offer and voted the promised sum to D&#x27;Esterre&#x27;s wife themselves. D&#x27;Esterre&#x27;s wife consented to accept an allowance for her daughter, which O&#x27;Connell regularly paid for more than thirty years until his death. The memory of the duel haunted him for the remainder of his life.

====Russia====
The works of Russian poet Alexander Pushkin contained a number of duels, notably Onegin&#x27;s duel with Lensky in &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;. These turned out to be prophetic, as Pushkin himself was mortally wounded in a controversial duel with Georges d&#x27;Anthès, a French officer rumored to be his wife&#x27;s lover. D&#x27;Anthès, who was accused of cheating in this duel, married Pushkin&#x27;s sister-in-law and went on to become a French minister and senator.

====Germany====
In the 1860s, Otto von Bismarck was reported to have challenged Rudolf Virchow to a duel. Virchow, being entitled to choose the weapons, chose two pork sausages, one infected with the roundworm &quot;Trichinella&quot;; the two would each choose and eat a sausage. Bismarck reportedly declined. The story could be apocryphal, however.

====Scotland====
In Scotland, James Stuart of Dunearn, was tried and acquitted after a duel that fatally wounded Sir Alexander Boswell. George Buchan published his own examination of arguments in favour of duelling alongside an account of the trial, taken in shorthand. Other duels have been fought in Scotland mostly between soldiers or the gentry with several subsequently brought to the law courts.

====Canada====
The last known fatal duel in Ontario was in Perth, in 1833, when Robert Lyon challenged John Wilson to a pistol duel after a quarrel over remarks made about a local school teacher, whom Wilson married after Lyon was killed in the duel. Victoria, British Columbia was known to have been the centre of at least two duels near the time of the gold rush. One involved a British arrival by the name of George Sloane, and an American, John Liverpool, both arriving via San Francisco in 1858. In a duel by pistols, Sloane was fatally injured and Liverpool shortly returned to the US. The fight originally started on board the ship over a young woman, Miss Bradford, and then carried on later in Victoria&#x27;s tent city. Another duel, involving a Mr. Muir, took place around 1861, but was moved to a US island near Victoria.

===Decline in the 19th and 20th centuries===
Duels had mostly ceased to be fought to the death by the late 19th century.

By the start of World War I, dueling had not only been made illegal almost everywhere in the Western world, but was also widely seen as an anachronism. Military establishments in most countries frowned on dueling because officers were the main contestants. Officers were often trained at military academies at government expense; when officers killed or disabled one another it imposed an unnecessary financial and leadership strain on a military organization, making dueling unpopular with high-ranking officers.

With the end of the duel, the dress sword lost its position as an indispensable part of a gentleman&#x27;s wardrobe, a development described as an &quot;archaeological terminus&quot; by Ewart Oakeshott, concluding the long period during which the sword had been a visible attribute of the free man, beginning as early as three millennia ago with the Bronze Age sword.

====Legislation====
Charles I outlawed dueling in Austria-Hungary in 1917. Germany (the various states of the Holy Roman Empire) has a history of laws against dueling going back to the late medieval period, with a large amount of legislation () dating from the period after the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Prussia outlawed dueling in 1851, and the law was inherited by the of the German Empire after 1871. Pope Leo XIII in the encyclica (1891) asked the bishops of Germany and Austria-Hungary to impose penalties on duellists. In Nazi-era Germany, legislations on dueling were tightened in 1937. After World War II, West German authorities persecuted academic fencing as duels until 1951, when a Göttingen court established the legal distinction between academic fencing and dueling.

In 1839, after the death of a congressman, dueling was outlawed in Washington, D.C. A constitutional amendment was even proposed for the federal constitution to outlaw dueling. Some U.S. states&#x27; constitutions, such as West Virginia&#x27;s, contain explicit prohibitions on dueling to this day. In Kentucky, state members of the Electoral College must swear that they had never engaged in a duel with a deadly weapon, under a clause in the State Constitution enacted in the 1850s and still valid. Other U.S. states, like Mississippi until the late 1970s, formerly had prohibitions on dueling in their state constitutions, but later repealed them, whereas others, such as Iowa, constitutionally prohibited known duelers from holding political office until the early 1990s.

From 1921 until 1992, Uruguay was one of the few places where duels were fully legal. During that period, a duel was legal in cases where &quot;an honor tribunal of three respectable citizens, one chosen by each side and the third chosen by the other two, had ruled that sufficient cause for a duel existed&quot;.

====Pistol sport dueling====

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, pistol dueling became popular as a sport in France. The duelists were armed with conventional pistols, but the cartridges had wax bullets and were without any powder charge; the bullet was propelled only by the explosion of the cartridge&#x27;s primer.

Participants wore heavy, protective clothing and a metal helmet with a glass eye-screen. The pistols were fitted with a shield that protected the firing hand.

=====Olympic dueling=====
Pistol dueling was an associate (non-medal) event at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London.

====Late survivals====
Dueling culture survived in France, Italy, and Latin America well into the 20th century. After World War II, duels had become rare even in France, and those that still occurred were covered in the press as eccentricities. Duels in France in this period, while still taken seriously as a matter of honor, were not fought to the death. They consisted of fencing with the épée mostly in a fixed distance with the aim of drawing blood from the opponent&#x27;s arm.

In 1949, former Vichy official Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour fought school teacher Roger Nordmann.
The last known duel in France took place in 1967, when Socialist Deputy and Mayor of Marseille Gaston Defferre insulted Gaullist Deputy René Ribière at the French Parliament and was subsequently challenged to a duel fought with swords. Ribière lost the duel, having been wounded twice. In Uruguay, a pistol duel was fought in 1971 between Danilo Sena and Enrique Erro, in which neither of the combatants was injured.

Various modern jurisdictions still retain mutual combat laws, which allow disputes to be settled via consensual unarmed combat, which are essentially unarmed duels, though it may still be illegal for such fights to result in grievous bodily harm or death. Few if any modern jurisdictions allow armed duels.

==Rules==

===Offence and satisfaction===
The traditional situation that led to a duel often happened after a perceived offense, whether real or imagined, when one party would demand satisfaction from the offender. The demand was commonly symbolized by an inescapably insulting gesture, such as throwing a glove to the ground before the offender.

Usually, challenges were delivered in writing by one or more close friends who acted as &quot;seconds&quot;. The challenge, written in formal language, laid out the real or imagined grievances and a demand for satisfaction. The challenged party then had the choice of accepting or refusing the challenge. Grounds for refusing the challenge could include that it was frivolous, or that the challenger was not generally recognized as a &quot;gentleman&quot; since dueling was limited to persons of equal social status. However, care had to be taken before declining a challenge, as it could result in accusations of cowardice or be perceived as an insult to the challenger&#x27;s seconds if it was implied that they were acting on behalf of someone of low social standing. Participation in a duel could be honorably refused on account of a major difference in age between the parties and, to a lesser extent, in cases of social inferiority on the part of the challenger. Such inferiority had to be immediately obvious, however. As author Bertram Wyatt-Brown states, &quot;with social distinctions often difficult to measure&quot;, most men could not escape on such grounds without the appearance of cowardice.

Once a challenge was accepted, if not done already, both parties (known as &quot;principals&quot;) would appoint trusted representatives to act as their seconds with no further direct communication between the principals being allowed until the dispute was settled. The seconds had a number of responsibilities, of which the first was to do all in their power to avert bloodshed provided their principal&#x27;s honor was not compromised. This could involve back and forth correspondence about a mutually agreeable lesser course of action, such as a formal apology for the alleged offense.

In the event that the seconds failed to persuade their principals to avoid a fight, they then attempted to agree on terms for the duel that would limit the chance of a fatal outcome, consistent with the generally accepted guidelines for affairs of honor. The exact rules or etiquette for dueling varied by time and locale but were usually referred to as the code duello. In most cases, the challenged party had the choice of weapons, with swords being favored in many parts of continental Europe and pistols in the United States and Great Britain.

It was the job of the seconds to make all of the arrangements in advance, including how long the duel would last and what conditions would end the duel. Often sword duels were only fought until blood was drawn, thus severely limiting the likelihood of death or grave injury since a scratch could be considered as satisfying honor. In pistol duels, the number of shots to be permitted and the range were set out. Care was taken by the seconds to ensure the ground chosen gave no unfair advantage to either party. A doctor or surgeon was usually arranged to be on hand. Other things often arranged by the seconds could go into minute details that might seem odd in the modern world, such as the dress code (duels were often formal affairs), the number and names of any other witnesses to be present and whether or not refreshments would be served.

===Field of honor===
The chief criteria for choosing the field of honor were isolation, to avoid discovery and interruption by the authorities; and jurisdictional ambiguity, to avoid legal consequences. Islands in rivers dividing two jurisdictions were popular dueling sites; the cliffs below Weehawken on the Hudson River where the Hamilton–Burr duel occurred were a popular field of honor for New York duelists because of the uncertainty of whether New York or New Jersey had jurisdiction. Duels traditionally took place at dawn, when the poor light would make the participants less likely to be seen, and to force an interval for reconsideration or sobering up.

For some time before the mid-18th century, swordsmen dueling at dawn often carried lanterns to see each other. This happened so regularly that fencing manuals integrated lanterns into their lessons. An example of this is using the lantern to parry blows and blind the opponent. The manuals sometimes show the combatants carrying the lantern in the left hand wrapped behind the back, which is still one of the traditional positions for the off-hand in modern fencing.

===Conditions===
At the choice of the offended party, the duel could be fought to a number of conclusions:
* To first blood, in which case the duel would be ended as soon as one man was wounded, even if the wound was minor.
* Until one man was so severely wounded as to be physically unable to continue the duel.
* To the death (or ), in which case there would be no satisfaction until one party was mortally wounded.
* In the case of pistol duels, each party would fire one shot. If neither man was hit and if the challenger stated that he was satisfied, the duel would be declared over. If the challenger was not satisfied, a pistol duel could continue until one man was wounded or killed, but to have more than three exchanges of fire was considered barbaric, and, on the rare occasion that no hits were achieved, somewhat ridiculous.

Under the latter conditions, one or both parties could intentionally miss in order to fulfill the conditions of the duel, without loss of either life or honor. However, doing so, known as deloping, could imply that one&#x27;s opponent was not worth shooting. This practice occurred despite being expressly banned by the Irish of 1777. Rule XII stated: &quot;No dumb shooting or firing in the air is admissible in any case ... children&#x27;s play must be dishonourable on one side or the other, and is accordingly prohibited.&quot;

Practices varied, however, but unless the challenger was of a higher social standing, such as a baron or prince challenging a knight, the person being challenged was allowed to decide the time and weapons used in the duel. The offended party could stop the duel at any time if he deemed his honor satisfied. In some duels, the seconds would take the place of the primary duelist if the primary was not able to finish the duel. This was usually done in duels with swords, where one&#x27;s expertise was sometimes limited. The second would also act as a witness.

===Pistol duel===
There were various methods of pistol dueling. The mode where the two duelists stood back-to-back, walked away from each other for a set number of paces before turning and firing was known as the &quot;French&quot; method. Another method required the duelists to stand still at an agreed distance and fire simultaneously on a signal – this was the type of duel favored in Britain. A variant of this required the duelists to take turns to shoot, with the challenger shooting first or the right of first shot being decided by a coin toss.

The distance at which the pistols were fired might depend on local custom, the wishes of the duelists or sometimes the severity of the insult. The American dueling code of 1838 suggested a distance between 10 and 20 paces. There were incidences of pistol duels taking place at just two or three paces, with a virtual certainty of one or both duelists being injured or killed.

A method popular in Continental Europe was known as a &quot;barrier duel&quot; or a duel (&quot;at pleasure&quot;); it did not have a set shooting distance. The two duelists began some distance apart. Between them there were two lines on the ground separated by an agreed distance – this constituted the barrier and they were forbidden to cross it. After the signal to begin, they could advance towards the barrier to close the distance and were permitted to fire at any time. However, the one that shot first was required to stand still and allow his opponent to walk right up to his barrier line and fire back at leisure.

Many historical duels were prevented by the difficulty of arranging the &quot;&quot;. In the instance of Richard Brocklesby, the number of paces could not be agreed upon; and in the affair between Mark Akenside and Ballow, one had determined never to fight in the morning, and the other that he would never fight in the afternoon. John Wilkes, &quot;who did not stand upon ceremony in these little affairs&quot;, when asked by Lord Talbot how many times they were to fire, replied, &quot;just as often as your Lordship pleases; I have brought a bag of bullets and a flask of gunpowder.&quot;

==Western traditions==

===Europe===

====Great Britain and Ireland====
The duel arrived at the end of the 16th century with the influx of Italian honor and courtesy literature – most notably Baldassare Castiglione&#x27;s &quot;Libro del Cortegiano&quot; (Book of the Courtier), published in 1528, and Girolamo Muzio&#x27;s &quot;Il Duello&quot;, published in 1550. These stressed the need to protect one&#x27;s reputation and social mask and prescribed the circumstances under which an insulted party should issue a challenge.
The word &quot;duel&quot; was introduced in the 1590s, modeled after Medieval Latin &quot;duellum&quot; (an archaic Latin form of &quot;bellum&quot; &quot;war&quot;, but associated by popular etymology with &quot;duo&quot; &quot;two&quot;, hence &quot;one-on-one combat&quot;).

Soon domestic literature was being produced such as Simon Robson&#x27;s &quot;The Courte of Ciuill Courtesie&quot;, published in 1577. Dueling was further propagated by the arrival of Italian fencing masters such as Rocco Bonetti and Vincento Saviolo. By the reign of James I dueling was well entrenched within a militarized peerage – one of the most important duels being that between Edward Bruce, 2nd Lord Kinloss and Edward Sackville (later the 4th Earl of Dorset) in 1613, during which Bruce was killed. James I encouraged Francis Bacon as Solicitor-General to prosecute would-be duelists in the Court of Star Chamber, leading to about two hundred prosecutions between 1603 and 1625. He also issued an edict against dueling in 1614 and is believed to have supported production of an anti-dueling tract by the Earl of Northampton.

Dueling, however, continued to spread out from the court, notably into the army. In the mid-17th century it was for a time checked by the activities of the Parliamentarians whose Articles of War specified the death penalty for would-be duelists. Nevertheless, dueling survived and increased markedly with the Restoration. Among the difficulties of anti-dueling campaigners was that although monarchs uniformly proclaimed their general hostility to dueling, they were nevertheless very reluctant to see their own favorites punished. In 1712 both the Duke of Hamilton and Charles 4th Baron Mohun were killed in a celebrated duel induced by political rivalry and squabbles over an inheritance.

By the 1780s, the values of the duel had spread into the broader and emerging society of gentlemen. Research shows that much the largest group of later duelists were military officers, followed by the young sons of the metropolitan elite (see Banks, &quot;A Polite Exchange of Bullets&quot;). Dueling was also popular for a time among doctors and, in particular, in the legal professions. Quantifying the number of duels in Britain is difficult, but there are about 1,000 attested between 1785 and 1845 with fatality rates at least 15% and probably somewhat higher.

In 1777, at the Summer assizes in the town of Clonmel, County Tipperary, a code of practice was drawn up for the regulation of duels. It was agreed by delegates from counties Tipperary, Galway, Mayo, Sligo and Roscommon, and intended for general adoption throughout Ireland. An amended version known as &#x27;The Irish Code of Honor&#x27;, and consisting of 25 rules, was adopted in some parts of the United States. The first article of the code stated:

The 19th-century Irish statesman Daniel O&#x27;Connell took part in a duel in 1815. Following the death of his opponent, John D&#x27;Esterre, O&#x27;Connell repented and from that time wore a white glove on his right hand when attending Mass as a public symbol of his regret. Despite numerous challenges, he refused ever to fight another duel.

The last duel in England was fought in 1852 between two French political exiles. In 1862, in an article entitled &quot;Dead (and gone) Shots&quot;, Charles Dickens recalled the rules and myths of Irish dueling in his periodical &quot;All the Year Round&quot;.

=====British prime ministers who took part in duels=====
Four Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom engaged in duels, although only two of them – Pitt and Wellington – held the office at the time of their duels.
* William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne fought a duel with Colonel William Fullarton (1780)
* Pitt–Tierney duel. William Pitt the Younger fought a duel with George Tierney (1798)
* Canning–Castlereagh duel. George Canning fought a duel with Lord Castlereagh (1809)
*Wellington–Winchilsea duel. The Duke of Wellington fought a duel with Lord Winchilsea (1829)

====Holy Roman Empire and Germany====
In Early New High German, the duel was known as &quot;Kampf&quot;, or &quot;Kampffechten&quot;. The German dueling tradition originates in the Late Middle Ages, within the German school of fencing. In the 15th century, duels were fought between members of the nobility wearing full plate armor. During the late 16th and the 17th century, this tradition was gradually replaced with the modern fencing with the rapier following the Dardi school, while at the same time the practice of dueling spread to the bourgeois classes, especially among students.

The term &quot;Kampf&quot; is replaced by the modern German &quot;Duell&quot; during the same period, attested in the Latin form &quot;duellum&quot; from c. 1600, and as &quot;Duell&quot; from the 1640s. A modern remnant of German dueling culture is found in the non-lethal Mensur tradition in academic fencing.

====Greece====
In the Ionian Islands in the 19th century, there was a practice of formalized fighting between men over points of honor. Knives were the weapons used in such fights. They would begin with an exchange of sexually related insults in a public place such as a tavern, and the men would fight with the intention of slashing the other&#x27;s face, rather than killing. As soon as blood was drawn onlookers would intervene to separate the men. The winner would often spit on his opponent and dip his neckerchief in the blood of the loser, or wipe the blood off his knife with it.

The winner would generally make no attempt to avoid arrest and would receive a light penalty, such as a short jail sentence and/or a small fine.

====Poland====
In Poland, duels have been known since the Middle Ages. The best known Polish code was written as late as 1919 by Władysław Boziewicz. At this time duels were already forbidden in Poland, but the &quot;Polish Honorary Code&quot; was quite widely in use. Punishments for participation in duels were rather mild – up to a year&#x27;s imprisonment if the outcome of the duel was death or grievous bodily harm.

====Russia====
The tradition of dueling and the word &quot;duel&quot; itself were brought to Russia in the 17th century by adventurers in Russian service. Dueling quickly became so popular – and the number of casualties among the commanding ranks so high – that, in 1715, Emperor Peter I was forced to forbid the practice on pain of having both duelists hanged. Despite this official ban, dueling became a significant military tradition in the Russian Empire with a detailed unwritten dueling code – which was eventually written down by V. Durasov and released in print in 1908. This code forbade duels between people of different ranks. For instance, an infantry captain could not challenge a major but could easily pick on a Titular Counsellor. On the other hand, a higher ranked person could not stoop to challenge lower ranks; so, it was up to his subordinates or servants to take revenge on their master&#x27;s behalf.

Dueling was also common among prominent Russian writers, poets, and politicians. The Russian poet Alexander Pushkin fought 29 duels, challenging many prominent figures before being killed in a duel with Georges d&#x27;Anthès in 1837. His successor Mikhail Lermontov was killed four years later by fellow Army officer Nikolai Martynov. The dueling tradition died out in the Russian Empire slowly from the mid-19th century.

===Americas===

====Latin America====
Duels were common in much of South America during the 20th century, although generally illegal. In Argentina, during the 18th and 19th century, it was common for &quot;gauchos&quot; – cowboys – to resolve their disputes in a fight using working knives called &quot;facones&quot;. After the turn of the 19th century, when repeating handguns became more widely available, use of the facón as a close-combat weapon declined. Among the gauchos, many continued to wear the knife, though mostly as a tool. However, it was occasionally still used to settle arguments &quot;of honor&quot;. In these situations two adversaries would attack with slashing attacks to the face, stopping when one could no longer see clearly through the blood.

In Peru there were several high-profile duels by politicians in the early part of the 20th century including one in 1957 involving Fernando Belaúnde Terry, who went on to become president. In 2002 Peruvian independent congressman Eittel Ramos challenged Vice President David Waisman to a duel with pistols, saying the vice president had insulted him. Waisman declined.

Uruguay decriminalized dueling in 1920, and in that year José Batlle y Ordóñez, a former President of Uruguay, killed Washington Beltran, editor of the newspaper &quot;El País&quot;, in a formal duel fought with pistols. In 1990, the &quot;La República&quot; owner Federico Fasano Mertens editor was challenged to a duel by an assistant police chief. Although not forbidden by the government, the duel did not take place. Dueling was once again prohibited in 1992.

A senator, and future President of Chile, Salvador Allende, was challenged to a duel by his colleague Raúl Rettig (who would later be his ambassador to Brazil) in 1952. Both men agreed to fire one shot at each other, and both fired into the air. At that time, dueling was already illegal in Chile.

There is a frequently quoted claim that dueling is legal in Paraguay if both parties are blood donors. No evidence exists that this is indeed true, and the notion has been outright denied by members of Paraguayan government.

====United States====

European styles of dueling established themselves in the colonies of European states in North America. Duels were to challenge someone over a woman or to defend one&#x27;s honor. In the US, dueling tended to arise over political differences.

As early as 1728, some US states began to restrict or prohibit the practice. The penalty established upon conviction of killing another person in a duel in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in its 1728 law to punish and prevent dueling stated &quot;In Case any Person shall slay or kill any other in Duel or Fight, as aforesaid and upon Conviction thereof suffer the Pains of Death, as is by Law provided for wilful Murder, the Body of such Person, shall not be allowed Christian Burial, but be buried without a Coffin, with a Stake driven Through the Body, at or near the Place of Execution, as aforesaid.&quot;

Dueling was the subject of an unsuccessful federal amendment to the United States Constitution in 1838. It was fairly common for politicians at that time in the United States to end disputes through duels, such as the Burr–Hamilton duel and the Jackson–Dickinson duel. While dueling had become outdated in the North since the early 19th century, this was not true of other regions of the nation.

Physician J. Marion Sims described the dueling culture in 1830s South Carolina:

However, as the 19th century progressed, the American definition of &#x27;dueling&#x27; had clearly degenerated from an inherited European social custom using seconds and set rules of conduct. Instead, the term was increasingly used to describe &quot;any&quot; violent fight or melee between two or more contestants using mixed weapons – clubs, bottles, Bowie knives, or firearms of any type or description. Newspapers of the day freely used the term &quot;duel&quot; to include fights between combatants of any class or social order.

By 1859, 18 states had outlawed dueling outright, and with few exceptions, traditional dueling using seconds and formal rules of conduct had largely died out in the US by the 1870s. In 1891, Kentucky passed a law that anyone sworn into any statewide or county office or judgeship in Kentucky must declare under oath that he or she has not participated in, acted as a second or otherwise assisted in a duel, a law which is still in effect.

Crude so-called &#x27;quick-draw&#x27; duels, though in reality very rare, were also fought to uphold personal honor in the western American frontier, partly influenced by the code duello brought by Southern emigrants. The quick draw duel is a common trope in a gunfighter story in most Western stories, although some of the few real life Wild West duels that did occur included the Wild Bill Hickok – Davis Tutt shootout and Luke Short – Jim Courtright duel. Gunfighters Jim Levy and Tom Carberry became infamous for participating in at least two quick draw duels in their lifetimes. Besides quick draw duels, more formal European duels were also fought in the Old West such as those participated by former cowboys Hugh Anderson and Burton C. Mossman. Settlements such as Tombstone and Dodge City attempted to prevent these so-called duels by prohibiting civilians from carrying firearms by local ordinance, with little success. Instead, conflicts were increasingly resolved by the formation of organized law enforcement and the institution of judicial process.

====Canada====
In Upper Canada, then a British colony, John Wilson killed Robert Lyon on June 13, 1833, in Perth. That incident is believed by some to have been the last fatal duel fought in Canada; it was certainly the last in what is now Ontario. However, several reliable sources state that the last fatal duel in what is now Canada occurred in Lower Canada (now Quebec) on May 22, 1838. The duelists were British officer Major Henry Warde and lawyer Robert Sweeney; Warde was wounded in that incident and subsequently died.

===Australia===
Australia had a history of dueling, with the last recorded one being in Sydney between Thomas Mitchell and Stuart Donaldson (later Premier of New South Wales) in 1851. Only Donaldson&#x27;s hat was damaged.

==Eastern traditions==

===India===
Duels or &quot;niyuddha&quot; were held in ancient India (including modern-day Pakistan and Bangladesh) for various reasons. Many kshatriya considered it shameful to die in bed, and in their old age often arranged for a &quot;yuddha-dhan&quot;, literally meaning &quot;combat charity&quot;. According to this practice when a warrior felt he did not have much time to live, he would go along with a few attendants and ask another king for a duel or a small scale battle. In this way he chooses his own time and manner of death and is assured that he will die fighting. Duels to the death were legal in some periods, and punishable by execution in others.

Ancient epics and texts like the &quot;Dharmashastra&quot; tell that duels took place under strict rules of conduct, and to violate them was both shameful and sinful. According to these rules, it was forbidden to injure or kill an opponent who has lost their weapon, who surrenders, or who has been knocked unconscious. The &quot;Manusmṛti&quot; tells that if a warrior&#x27;s topknot comes loose during a duel, the opponent must give him time to bind his hair before continuing. Both duelists are required to wield the same weapon, and specific rules may have existed for each weapon. For example, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; records that hitting below the waist is forbidden in mace duels. In one ancient form of dueling, two warriors wielded a knife in the right hand while their left hands were tied together.

The Portuguese traveler Duarte Barbosa tells that dueling was a common practice among the nobles of the Vijayanagara Empire, and it was the only legal manner in which &quot;murder&quot; could be committed. After fixing a day for the duel and getting permission from the king or minister, the duellists would arrive at the appointed field &quot;with great pleasure&quot;. Duelists would wear no armor and were bare from the waist up. From the waist down they wore cotton cloth tightly round with many folds. The weapons used for dueling were swords, shields and daggers which the king would appoint them of equal length. Judges decided what rewards would be given to duelists; the winner may even acquire the loser&#x27;s estate.

Duels in Manipur were first recorded in the &quot;Chainarol-Puya&quot; which details the ethics of dueling. When a fighter was challenged, the day for the bout would be fixed to allow for time to prepare the weapons. Allowing the opponent the first chance to fire an arrow or hurl a spear was considered particularly courageous. The duel itself was not necessarily to the death, and usually ended once first blood has been drawn. However, the victor was still expected to behead the loser. Either before the duel or before the beheading, the fighters would share the meals and wine prepared by their wives. If it had been so requested beforehand, the loser&#x27;s body may be cremated. Heads were taken as trophies, as was custom among the headhunters of northeast India. Various taboos existed such as not killing an opponent who runs, begs or cries out of fear, or anyone who pleads for protection.

In medieval Kerala, duels known as ankam were fought between the Chekavar or &quot;Ankachekavar&quot; warriors trained in Kalaripayattu. These duels were conducted in order to settle disputes between nobles, chieftains or rulers. Each side used to engage warriors to fight for them in combat at a fixed location and time. Both nobles would be represented by a Chekavar. These duels were usually fought to death, and the ruler whose Chekavar survived was considered as the winner.

===Indonesia===
Weapons and rules for dueling in the Indonesian archipelago vary from one culture to another. In Madura, dueling is known as &quot;carok&quot; and was typically practiced with the sickle or celurit. The Madurese people imbued their sickles with a , a type of mythical spirit, by a way of prayer before engaging in a duel.

The traditional form of dueling among the Bugis-Makassar community was called &quot;sitobo lalang lipa&quot; in which the duellists fight in a sarong. The challenger stands with a loosened sarong around him and respectfully invites the other man to step into the sarong. The sarong itself is kept taut around both their waists. When both men are inside, an agreement to fight til death and thereafter shall be no hereditary grudge nor will any party be allowed to question the duel, shall be made. If both fighters agree, they then engage each other within the confined space of a single sarong. Unlike the more typical kris duel of Javanese and Malay culture, the Bugis-Makassar community instead wield badik, the local single-edge knife. Because avoiding injury is near-impossible even for the victor, this type of duel was considered a sign of extraordinary bravery, masculinity and the warrior mentality. Although true &quot;sitobo lalang lipa&quot; are no longer practiced, enactments of these duels are still performed at cultural shows today.

===Japan===
In Edo period Japan, there was a tradition of dueling () among the samurai class.

On April 14, 1612, the famous Japanese swordsman Miyamoto Musashi dueled his rival Sasaki Kojiro on the island of Funajima. Miyamoto is said to have fought over 60 duels and was never defeated.

===Philippines===
Dueling was a common practice in the Philippines since ancient times, and continued to be recorded during Spanish and American colonialism. In the Visayas, there is a tradition of dueling where the offended party would first &quot;hagit&quot; or challenge the offender. The offender would have the choice whether to accept or decline the challenge. In the past, choice of weapons was not limited. But most often, bolos, rattan canes, and knives were the preferred weapons. Duels were either first-blood, submission, or to the last man standing. Duels to death were known as &quot;huego-todo&quot; (without bounds). Some of the older generation of Filipino martial artists could still recall details of duels which occurred during their youth.

Duels with the bolo knife were prominent in North and Central Philippines, common in farmlands where the machete-like bolo is commonly used as a domestic tool. A duel reported internationally occurred on 14 April 1920 by Prescott Journal Miner which was known as &quot;The First Bolo Duel in Manila since the American Occupation&quot;. It happened when Ángel Umali and Tranquilino Paglinawan met with friends in a vacant lot near the city centre before dusk to settle a feud; Paglinawan lost his left hand. With no law against bolo fights, Umali was charged for a petty crime.

Bolo fights are still seen today, albeit rarely, and have become part of Filipino rural culture. On 7 January 2012, two middle-aged farmers were wounded after a bolo duel over the harvest of rice in a village in Zamboanga City. Geronimo Álvarez and Jesús Guerrero were drinking and at the height of their arguing Álvarez allegedly pulled out his bolo and hacked Guerrero. Guerrero also pulled his bolo and repeatedly hacked Álvarez, and their relatives immediately intervened and rushed them to a hospital.

<text>Jorge Raúl Porcel de Peralta (; 7 September 1936 – 16 May 2006), known as Jorge Porcel, was an Argentine comedy actor and television host. He was nicknamed &quot;El Gordo de América&quot; (&quot;America&#x27;s Fat Guy&quot;). Porcel is considered, along with Alberto Olmedo, one of Argentina&#x27;s greatest comic actors of the twentieth century.

== Film career ==
Porcel worked in 49 movies, starting with 1962&#x27;s &quot;Disloque en Mar del Plata&quot;, and ending with &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot; (1993). Many of these 49 movies were collaborations with Olmedo. Among the movies they did together was 1986&#x27;s &quot;Rambito y Rambón: Primera Misión&quot;. (&quot;Little Rambo and Big Rambo: First Mission&quot;)

Many of Porcel and Olmedo&#x27;s movies in the 1970s and 1980s were adult-oriented comedies. Conservative Argentine authorities rated these movies as PM-18 (age 18 and above), except for some movies planned for family audiences, which had &quot;tamer&quot; content. These movies are considered to be the pinnacle of Argentina&#x27;s sexy comedy movie genre. Most of these movies were directed by Gerardo Sofovich or his brother Hugo. Porcel virtually stopped appearing in these movies after the accidental death of Olmedo, which left him clinically depressed.

== Films ==
== Television career ==

Porcel had many TV hit shows as well, including &quot;Operación Ja Ja&quot; (both the 1960s original and the 1980s remake) and &quot;Polémica en el bar&quot; (Debate at the Café), where he had celebrated moments of comedy with fellow comedian Juan Carlos Altavista. Most of these TV efforts were linked to the Sofovich brothers. He also did &quot;Las Gatitas Y Ratones de Porcel&quot; (Little Cats &amp; Mice of Porcel).

After he retired from filming movies in Argentina, he moved to Miami, where he starred in a risqué late-night variety show named &quot;A la cama con Porcel&quot; (&quot;To Bed with Porcel&quot;) on the Telemundo network, and was given a cameo in Hollywood production Carlito&#x27;s Way. &quot;A La Pasta con Porcel&quot; is a restaurant in Miami Beach opened by Porcel and named after his popular television show.

Porcel&#x27;s health deteriorated with time, due to his struggles with obesity and diabetes, to the point of ending up using a wheelchair in his later years. He toured during 1999 through Latin America to promote his autobiography &quot;Laughs, Applause and Tears&quot;. By this time, he had also become a born again Christian.

Porcel died in a hospital in Miami after a gallbladder surgery at the age of 69. His body was flown to Argentina and buried at the Chacarita Cemetery.

== Music ==
In 1980 he recorded a bolero record called &quot;Pure heart&quot; (Spanish: Puro Corazón (1980)) . Jorge Porcel loved music and in his shows he used to sing boleros, as in Las gatitas y ratones de Porcel (Porcel&#x27;s kittens and mice) (where he was frequently accompanied by piano player Mike Rivas) and at &quot;¿Lo viste a Porcel? (Have you seen Porcel).&quot; With his character Don Mateo he took part in a record from the show Operacióm Ja-Já (Operation Ha ha) singing along with Rolo Puente, Leo Dan&#x27;s hit «Libre, solterito y sin nadie» (Free, single and with nobody).

== Comics ==
In 1970&#x27;s decade, for several years, Cielosur Editora published several magazines dedicated to TV characters, as Piluso, Minguito and El Gordo Porcel. &quot;Las aventuras del Gordo Porcel&quot; (The adventures of Porcel the Fat Man) was the title of the one dedicated to Jorge. The usual play -with drawings by Francisco Mazza- consisted of el Gordo getting in trouble and several confusions, during the time in between the feasts of food prepared by his mother, who he lived with. Other frequent characters are his girlfriend and his dog Banana, who had his own comic.

<text>[[Adobe Inc.|Adobe]] Illustrator is a vector graphics editor and design software developed and marketed by Adobe. Originally designed for the Apple Macintosh, development of Adobe Illustrator began in 1985. Along with Creative Cloud (Adobe&#x27;s shift to a monthly or annual subscription service delivered over the Internet), Illustrator CC was released. The latest version, Illustrator 2025, was released on October 14, 2024, and is the 29th generation in the product line. Adobe Illustrator was reviewed as the best vector graphics editing program in 2021 by &quot;hp&quot; &quot;Magazine&quot;.

==History==
===Versions 1–1.6 (Illustrator 88)===
Development of Adobe Illustrator for the Apple Macintosh began in 1985 (shipping in January 1987) as Adobe&#x27;s second software product after PostScript. Adobe co-founder and CEO John Warnock created Illustrator in late 1986 to automate many of the manual tasks utilized by his wife, Marva, a graphic designer. It used lines and bézier curves to render infinitely scalable graphics. Illustrator was released in early 1987, and became a commercialization of Adobe&#x27;s in-house font development software and PostScript file format. 

Adobe Illustrator is the companion product of Adobe Photoshop. Photoshop is primarily geared toward digital photo manipulation and photorealistic styles of computer illustration, while Illustrator provides results in the typesetting and logo graphic areas of design. Early magazine advertisements (featured in graphic design trade magazines such as &quot;Communication Arts&quot;) referred to the product as &quot;the Adobe Illustrator&quot;. Illustrator 88, the product name for version 1.7, was released in 1988 and introduced many new tools and features.

&quot;Byte&quot; in 1989 listed Illustrator 88 as among the &quot;Distinction&quot; winners of the Byte Awards, stating that with it Adobe had &quot;pulled ahead&quot; of previously industry-dominant competitor Aldus FreeHand.

Early versions of the software did not support working in preview mode and users needed to have two windows open on their desktop in order to have a live preview of their work. One window would show the work in progress and the other window would show a preview of the work in progress.

===Versions 2–6===
Although during its first decade Adobe developed Illustrator primarily for Macintosh, it sporadically supported other platforms. In the early 1990s, Adobe released versions of Illustrator for Display PostScript licensees NeXT, Digital Equipment Corporation Ultrix, Silicon Graphics IRIX, and Sun Solaris platforms, but they were discontinued due to poor market acceptance. The first version of Illustrator for Windows, version 2.0, was released in early 1989 and flopped. The next Windows version, version 4.0, was widely criticized as being too similar to Illustrator 1.1 instead of the Macintosh 3.0 version, and certainly not the equal of Windows&#x27; most popular illustration package CorelDRAW. (There were no versions 2.0 or 4.0 for the Macintosh—although, the second release for the Mac was titled Illustrator 88—the year of its release. And there was no version 6 for Windows.) Version 4 was, however, the first version of Illustrator to support editing in preview mode, which did not appear in a Macintosh version until 5.0 in 1993. Version 6 was the last truly Macintosh version of Illustrator. The interface changed radically with the following version to bring consistency between Mac and Windows computer platforms. The changes remained until CS6 when some small steps were taken to restore the app to a slightly more Mac-like interface.

===Versions 7–10===

With the introduction of Illustrator 7 in 1997, Adobe made critical changes in the user interface with regard to path editing (and also to converge on the same user interface as Adobe Photoshop), and many users opted not to upgrade. Illustrator also began to support TrueType, effectively ending the &quot;font wars&quot; between PostScript Type 1 and TrueType. Like Photoshop, Illustrator also began supporting plug-ins, greatly and quickly extending its abilities.

With true user interface parity between Macintosh and Windows versions starting with 7.0, designers could finally standardize on Illustrator. Corel did port CorelDRAW FreeHand still not available in Illustrator (higher scaling percentages, advanced find-and-replace feature, selective round-corner editing, export/print selected objects only, etc.). Famously, Aldus made a matrix comparing its own FreeHand to Illustrator and Draw in which Draw&#x27;s one &quot;win&quot; was that it came with three different clip art views of the human pancreas.

Adobe bought Aldus in 1994 for PageMaker. As part of the transaction, the Federal Trade Commission issued a complaint of Adobe Systems on October 18, 1994, ordering a divestiture of FreeHand to &quot;remedy the lessening of competition resulting from the acquisition&quot; because of Adobe&#x27;s Illustrator software. As a result, Macromedia acquired Free Hand in 1995 from its original developer, Altsys, and continued its development through 2004.

The difference in strengths between Photoshop and Illustrator became clear with the rise of the Internet, Illustrator was enhanced to support Web publishing, rasterization previewing, PDF, and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). Adobe was an early developer of SVG for the web and Illustrator exported SVG files via the SVG File Format plugin. Using the Adobe SVG Viewer (ASV), introduced in 2000, allowed users to view SVG images in most major browsers until it was discontinued in 2009. Native support for SVG was not complete in all major browsers until Internet Explorer 9 in 2011.

Illustrator Version 9 included a tracing feature, similar to that within Adobe&#x27;s discontinued product Streamline.

Illustrator version 10 was released by Adobe in November 2001.

===Versions CS–CS6===
Illustrator CS (also called version 11), released by Adobe for Mac and Windows in October 2003, was the first version to include 3-dimensional capabilities allowing users to extrude or revolve shapes to create simple 3D objects.

Illustrator CS2 (version 12), released by Adobe in April 2005, was available for both the Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows operating systems. It was the last version for the Mac which did not run natively on Intel processors. Among the new features included in Illustrator CS2 were Live Trace, Live Paint, a control palette and custom workspace. Live Trace allows for the conversion of bitmap imagery into vector art and improved upon the previous tracing abilities. Live Paint allows users more flexibility in applying color to objects, specifically those that overlap. In the same year as the CS2 release, Adobe Systems announced an agreement to acquire Macromedia in a stock swap valued at about $3.4 billion and it integrated the companies&#x27; operations, networks, and customer-care organizations shortly thereafter. Adobe now owned Freehand along with the entire Macromedia product line and in 2007, Adobe announced that it would discontinue development and updates to the Freehand program. Instead, Adobe would provide tools and support to ease the transition to Illustrator.

Illustrator CS3 included interface updates to the Control Bar, the ability to align individual points, multiple Crop Areas, the Color Guide panel and the Live Color feature among others. CS3 was released on March 27, 2007.

CS4 was released in October 2008. It features a variety of improvements to old tools along with the introduction of a few brand-new tools acquired from FreeHand. The ability to create multiple artboards is one of CS4&#x27;s main additions from Freehand. The artboards allow you to create multiple versions of a piece of work within a single document. Other tools include the Blob Brush, which allows multiple overlapping vector brush strokes to easily merge or join, and a revamped gradient tool allowing for more in-depth color manipulation as well as transparency in gradients.

CS5 was released in April 2010. Along with a number of enhancements to existing functionality, Illustrator CS5&#x27;s new features include a Perspective Grid tool taken from FreeHand, a Bristle Brush (for more natural and painterly looking strokes) and a comprehensive update to strokes, referred to by Adobe as &quot;Beautiful Strokes&quot;.

In 2011 the Adobe Illustrator team developed a vector drawing app for iPad and iPhone, called Adobe Ideas. The app had many of the features of Adobe Illustrator, yet it was a free download. This allowed professionals to sketch and ideate &quot;on the go&quot; and allowed anyone to access world-class vector drawing capabilities. As a result, Facebook and social media posts appeared from all over the world with vector drawings from Adobe Ideas from pros and novices alike. 

Version CS6 was the 16th generation of Adobe Illustrator. Adobe added many more features and several bug fixes such as a new user interface, layer panels, RGB codes, and color ramp to increase performance. CS6 was released on April 23, 2012.

===Version CC===
Along with Creative Cloud (the result of Adobe&#x27;s shift on its release strategy), Illustrator CC was released. This version (the 17th) was the first to be only sold in a subscription-based service model, in line with the other software in the formerly called Creative Suite. As part of Creative Cloud, this version brought improvements in that subject such as color, font and program settings syncing, saving documents to the cloud, and integration with Behance (a creative collaborative network), as well as other features such as a new touch-compatible type tool, images in brushes, CSS extraction, and files packaging.

==Branding==
Starting with version 1.0, Adobe chose to license an image of Sandro Botticelli&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot; from the Bettmann Archive and use the portion containing Venus&#x27; face as Illustrator&#x27;s branding image. John Warnock desired a Renaissance image to evoke his vision of PostScript as a new Renaissance in publishing, and Adobe employee Luanne Seymour Cohen, who was responsible for the early marketing material, found Venus&#x27; flowing tresses a perfect vehicle for demonstrating Illustrator&#x27;s strength in tracing smooth curves over bitmap source images. Over the years the rendition of this image on Illustrator&#x27;s splash screen and packaging became more stylized to reflect features added in each version.

The image of Venus was replaced (albeit still accessible via easter egg) in Illustrator CS (11.0) and CS2 (12.0) by a stylized flower to conform to the Creative Suite&#x27;s nature imagery. In CS3, Adobe changed the suite branding once again, to simple colored blocks with two-letter abbreviations, resembling a periodic table of elements. Illustrator was represented by the letters Ai in white against an orange background (oranges and yellows were prominent color schemes in Illustrator branding going back as far as version 4.0). The CS4 icon is almost identical, except for a slight alteration to the font and the color which is dark gray. The CS5 icon is also virtually the same, except that this time the logo is like a box, along with all the other CS5 product logos, with the &quot;Ai&quot; bright yellow. CS6 changed it a bit to a brown square with a yellow border and yellow lettering, and in CC 2014 the colors were upgraded to a sharper tone and thinner borders.

==Compatibility==
Compatibility with Inkscape: Inkscape&#x27;s native format is SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), which is supported by Adobe Illustrator, but the two implementations are not fully compatible. Inkscape also exports to PS, EPS and PDF formats which Illustrator can recognize.

==Tools==
A sidebar that appears at the left of the screen with a variety of tools to select, create, and manipulate objects or artworks in Illustrator. These tools can be selected as following: drawing, typing, painting, reshaping, slicing and cutting, symbolism, moving and zooming, and graph. Some tools have a small triangle at the bottom right of the toolbox icon. A small triangle has the option to view or expand some hidden tools by holding down the mouse button on the triangle.

Some examples of basic tools in Illustrator are selection tools, paintbrush tools, pen tools, pencil tools e.g. Selection tools are used to the layout, adjust, and organize the artwork by selecting, positioning, and stacking objects accurately. Moreover, selection tools can group, lock or hide, and measure objects. Paintbrush tools can be used to modify the appearance of the artwork. There are different types of brushes: calligraphic, scatter, art, pattern, and bristle. Pen tools create straight and curved lines for the artwork and they can add anchor points to paths and delete from paths. Pencil tools allow the user to draw and edit freehand lines.

== File formats ==
The Adobe Illustrator Artwork format is the native Illustrator file format.

It is a proprietary file format developed by Adobe Systems for representing single-page vector-based drawings in either the EPS or PDF formats. The .ai filename extension is used by Adobe Illustrator.

The AI file format was originally a native format called PGF. PDF compatibility is achieved by embedding a complete copy of the PGF data within the saved PDF format file. This format is not related to .pgf using the same name &quot;Progressive Graphics Format&quot;.

The same &quot;dual path&quot; approach as for PGF is used when saving EPS-compatible files in recent versions of Illustrator. Early versions of the AI file format are true EPS files with a restricted, compact syntax, with additional semantics represented by Illustrator-specific DSC comments that conform to DSC&#x27;s Open Structuring Conventions. These files are identical to their corresponding Illustrator EPS counterparts, but with the EPS (procedure sets) omitted from the file and instead externally referenced using %%Include directives.

The following formats are also supported:

* SVG format
* AutoCAD file formats — Implemented by Drawings SDK (previously Teigha Drawings) by Open Design Alliance.
** AutoCAD Drawing (.dwg)
** AutoCAD Interchange File (.dxf)

== Illustrator Draw ==
Illustrator Draw was a free-form vector drawing app for Android and iOS users. Along with Illustrator, it is currently marketed by Adobe through Creative Cloud. Drawings made with the Illustrator Draw app can be exported to the desktop programs of Adobe Illustrator.

As of 2022, Illustrator Draw is retired and replaced by Adobe Fresco.

<text>WestJet Airlines, founded in 1994 and headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, is the second-largest airline in Canada. It began operations in 1996 with 220 employees, three aircraft, and five destinations. It was launched as a low-cost alternative to the country&#x27;s major airlines. Today, WestJet operates scheduled, charter, and cargo air service, transporting more than 25 million passengers per year. The airline has a significant domestic and international network, which serves over 100 destinations across North America, Caribbean, Europe, Asia, and Central America. WestJet has an average of 777 flights per day, solidifying its position as the eighth-largest airline in North America by frequency.

WestJet&#x27;s fleet primarily consists of Boeing 737 aircraft (Next Generation and MAX families), which are well-suited for its extensive list of short and medium-haul routes. In 2015, WestJet begun offering long-haul flights which necessitated the acquisition of wide-body aircraft, and it took delivery of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner in 2019.

WestJet has two direct subsidiaries: WestJet Encore, which operates the De Havilland Canada Dash 8, the Q400&quot;NextGen&quot;, on routes in Western Canada, and WestJet Cargo which operates four cargo aircraft, the Boeing 737 (800BCF), which were previously used as WestJet passenger aircraft and converted for cargo use.

In December 2019, WestJet Airlines was acquired by Kestrel Bidco Inc., a subsidiary of Onex Corporation. This acquisition resulted in WestJet transitioning from a publicly traded company on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) under the symbol &quot;WJA&quot; to a private company.

In May 2023, WestJet expanded its reach further with the acquisition of Sunwing, a Canadian leisure airline. The full integration is expected to be completed during 2025, bringing Sunwing&#x27;s staff and aircraft under the WestJet banner.

WestJet is not a member of any major airline alliances, such as Star Alliance, Oneworld, or SkyTeam. However, it utilizes codeshare and interline agreements with various airlines. These agreements allow WestJet to place its flight code on flights operated by other airlines, and vice versa.

==History==
===1994–1999: First flights===

WestJet was founded on June 27, 1994, by Clive Beddoe, David Neeleman, Mark Hill, Tim Morgan, and Donald Bell. WestJet was based on the low-cost carrier business model pioneered by Southwest Airlines and Morris Air in the United States. Its original routes were all located in Western Canada, which gave the airline its name.

On February 29, 1996, the first WestJet flight (a Boeing 737-200) departed. Initially, the airline served Calgary, Edmonton, Kelowna, Vancouver and Winnipeg with a fleet of three used 737-200 aircraft and 225 employees. By the end of that same year, the company had added Regina, Saskatoon and Victoria to its network.

In mid-September 1996, WestJet&#x27;s fleet was grounded due to a disagreement with Transport Canada over maintenance schedule requirements. The airline suspended all service for two weeks before resuming flights.

In early 1999, Clive Beddoe stepped down as WestJet&#x27;s CEO and was replaced by former Air Ontario executive Steve Smith. In July 1999, WestJet made its initial public offering of stock at 2.5 million shares, opening at $10 per share. The same year, the cities of Thunder Bay, Grande Prairie, and Prince George were added to WestJet&#x27;s route map.

In 2000, WestJet CEO Steve Smith was released from WestJet after 18 months in the position, apparently due to differences in management style; Smith went on to head rival Air Canada&#x27;s low-cost subsidiary Zip. After Smith&#x27;s departure, Clive Beddoe again became CEO of the company, a position he held until July 2007.

===2000–2003: Domestic expansion===

Due to restructuring in the Canadian airline industry resulting from Air Canada&#x27;s takeover of Canadian Airlines in 2000, WestJet expanded into Eastern Canada, beginning service to the cities of Hamilton and Ottawa, Ontario, and Moncton, New Brunswick. The airline selected John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport to be the focus of its Eastern Canadian operations and its main connection point in Eastern Canada.

In 2001, WestJet&#x27;s expansion continued with routes to Comox, along with Sault Ste. Marie, Sudbury, Ontario, Thompson and Brandon, Manitoba; however, service to each of these four cities has since been withdrawn. Service to Brandon, Manitoba and Sudbury, Ontario, was subsequently resumed by WestJet&#x27;s wholly owned subsidiary, WestJet Encore.

In 2002, the airline also added another two new Eastern Canadian destinations: the Ontario cities of London and Toronto. In April 2003, WestJet added Windsor, Montreal, Halifax, St. John&#x27;s and Gander.

WestJet entered into a two-year agreement with Air Transat in August 2003 whereby WestJet aircraft would be filled by Transat&#x27;s two main tour operators, World of Vacations and Transat Holidays. These chartered flights operated largely to destinations in Mexico and the Caribbean and the planes were operated by WestJet crews. This agreement between WestJet and Air Transat was amicably terminated in February 2009.

In 2004, rival airline Air Canada accused WestJet of industrial espionage and filed a civil suit against WestJet in Ontario Superior Court. Air Canada accused WestJet of accessing Air Canada confidential information via a private website to gain a business advantage. On May 29, 2006, WestJet admitted to the charges levelled by Air Canada and agreed to pay C$5.5 million in legal and investigation fees to Air Canada and donate C$10 million to various children&#x27;s charities in the names of Air Canada and WestJet.

===2004–2006: International expansion===
In January 2004, WestJet announced that it was moving the focus of its Eastern operations from Hamilton to Toronto the following April, fully moving into the lucrative Toronto–Ottawa–Montreal triangle and tripling the total number of its flights out of Toronto Pearson International Airport.

In 2004, several U.S. destinations were added or announced. These included San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando and LaGuardia Airport in New York City. In early 2005, Palm Springs and San Diego were added to the company&#x27;s list of destinations, while New York–LaGuardia was dropped. In April 2005, it announced new seasonal service to Charlottetown and ceased service to Gander. In fall 2005, Ft. Myers and Las Vegas were added to the growing list of destinations.

In late August 2005, WestJet flew to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, transporting members of a Vancouver-based urban search and rescue team to assist with Hurricane Katrina relief efforts.

After rumours and speculation surrounding the implementation of extended-range twin-engine operations (ETOPS), WestJet announced new service to the Hawaiian Islands from Vancouver on September 20, 2005. In December 2005, the airline began flying from Vancouver to Honolulu and Maui.

WestJet&#x27;s first scheduled service outside Canada and the United States began in 2006, to Nassau, The Bahamas. This was considered a huge milestone within the company&#x27;s long-term destination strategy and was a vital goal for future international market presence.

In September 2006, Sean Durfy took over as president of WestJet from founder Clive Beddoe.

On October 26, 2006, WestJet announced that it had its best quarterly profit to date, of C$52.8 million.

===2007–2009: Continued growth===

In 2007, WestJet announced that it would begin flights from Deer Lake in Newfoundland, Saint John in New Brunswick and Kitchener-Waterloo in Ontario. In June 2007, WestJet added seven new international seasonal flights to Saint Lucia, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Mexico as well as a third Hawaiian destination, Kona.

The same year, WestJet commissioned the construction of a new six-story head office building, next to their existing hangar facility at the Calgary International Airport. The building was constructed following the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System, featuring a rainwater retention system and geothermal heating. The first employees moved in during the first quarter of 2009, and the building officially opened the following May. The WestJet Campus building was certified as LEED Gold standard in October 2011.
In May 2008, WestJet launched daily non-stop service to Quebec City. The next month, WestJet commenced seasonal service between Calgary and New York City via Newark Liberty International Airport. In May 2009, the airline launched new seasonal service to the cities of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories and Sydney, Nova Scotia; service to Yellowknife was later extended through the winter of 2009–10.

During the 2000s (decade), WestJet made significant gains in domestic market share against Air Canada. In 2000 it held only 7% to Air Canada&#x27;s 77%, though by the end of 2009 WestJet had risen to 38%, against Air Canada&#x27;s 55%.

In late April 2009, WestJet temporarily suspended service to several of its destinations in Mexico due to the outbreak of influenza A (H1N1) in the country. The suspension of service to Cabo San Lucas, Mazatlán and Puerto Vallarta lasted from early May until mid-June, with seasonal service to Cancún being restored the following fall.

In July 2009, WestJet announced 11 new international destinations for its winter schedule. These included expanded service to the United States, to Atlantic City, New Jersey, Lihue (Kauai), Hawaii and Miami, Florida. New Caribbean destinations included Providenciales, in the Turks and Caicos Islands; Sint Maarten, Netherlands Antilles; Freeport, The Bahamas; as well as the cities of Varadero, Holguín and Cayo Coco in Cuba. Ixtapa and Cozumel were also added to the list of destinations served in Mexico.

In November 2009, WestJet announced service to the British island territory of Bermuda, which commenced in May 2010. WestJet also resumed seasonal service to Windsor, Ontario that same month.

=== 2010–2016: Overseas expansion ===
In March 2010, Sean Durfy resigned from his position as WestJet&#x27;s CEO, citing personal reasons. He was replaced by Gregg Saretsky, a former executive at Canadian Airlines and Alaska Airlines and previously Vice-President of WestJet Vacations and Executive Vice-President of Operations.

In July 2010, WestJet announced service to Santa Clara, Cuba, New Orleans and Grand Cayman bringing the total number of destinations to 71. Service to New Orleans lasted only one season and did not return the next year.

In late 2010, WestJet announced it was wet-leasing a Boeing 757 aircraft to expand service between Calgary to Honolulu and Maui and Edmonton to Maui, on a seasonal basis. Also that year, the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA), an independent administrative tribunal of the Government of Canada that regulates airlines, found WestJet&#x27;s baggage policies to be unreasonable and/or contrary to the requirements of the &quot;Canada Transportation Act&quot; and/or the &quot;Air Transport Regulations&quot; on several different occasions.
On January 26, 2011, after Air Canada terminated California service, WestJet announced plans to enter service to John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California from Vancouver and Calgary starting May of that year.

In November 2011, WestJet won an auction for time slots at New York&#x27;s LaGuardia Airport ushering in a return to service to New York. Details of WestJet&#x27;s scheduled service to LaGuardia were officially announced in January 2012. From 2012 to 2014, WestJet further expanded into the United States by adding Chicago via O&#x27;Hare International Airport, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, Myrtle Beach International Airport, and New York&#x27;s John F. Kennedy International Airport.

On November 15, 2013, WestJet announced their first destination in Europe. Seasonal service from St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland to Dublin, Ireland, would operate from June to October 2014.

In January 2014, WestJet chartered an Atlas Air Boeing 747-400 to transport stranded passengers and luggage during the 2013 Central and Eastern Canada ice storm. The charter flew from Toronto Pearson International Airport to Calgary International Airport.

On July 7, 2014, WestJet announced that it was in the &quot;advanced stages of sourcing&quot; four wide-body aircraft that would begin flying by the fall of 2015. These would initially serve on the seasonal Alberta-Hawaii routes when WestJet&#x27;s service agreement with Thomas Cook Airlines—who currently fly these routes on behalf of WestJet—expires in the spring of 2015. WestJet would take delivery of four Boeing 767-300ERs in summer 2015. WestJet took delivery of the first of these aircraft on August 27, 2015.
On June 16, 2015, WestJet announced the launch of service to London&#x27;s Gatwick Airport on May 6, 2016. It is the carrier&#x27;s third transatlantic destination after Dublin and Glasgow. The majority of flights to London use the wide-body 767-300ER aircraft. On September 15, 2015, WestJet flights to London direct from Edmonton, St. John&#x27;s, Vancouver, Winnipeg (seasonal) Calgary and Toronto (year-round) went on sale to the public. During winter months, WestJet continued to serve the seasonal Edmonton - Maui, Calgary - Honolulu, and Calgary - Maui flights with the 767-300ER aircraft before their eventual retirement in 2020.

===2017–2019: Transition to full-service carrier===

In April 2017, WestJet announced plans to launch an ultra-low-cost carrier in late 2017. The new airline would operate using Boeing 737-800 aircraft, and compete with new entrants to the market, such as Flair Airlines. The launch of the new airline, named Swoop, was delayed until June 2018.

On December 6, 2017, WestJet and Delta Air Lines signed a preliminary memorandum of understanding to extend their current codeshare agreement into a joint venture, pending regulatory and board approval. On July 19, 2018, WestJet and Delta Air Lines signed a definitive ten-year agreement into a joint venture between the two airlines. This joint venture would have served more than 95% of the Canada–U.S. demand. The airlines&#x27; current frequent flier programs would also be updated to be more closely aligned, and the airlines will be co-located at key hub airports. However, in November 2020, Delta and WestJet agreed to scrap their plans for a joint venture, as the demands of the United States Department of Transportation were seen &quot;unreasonable and unacceptable&quot; by both airlines.

While announcing an expansion of the senior leadership team on January 11, 2018, Gregg Saretsky reconfirmed the airline&#x27;s strategic goal to become a global, full-service carrier.

On March 8, 2018, the CEO of WestJet, Gregg Saretsky retired. He was replaced by company vice-president, Ed Sims.
On May 8, 2018, WestJet announced that it would be adding the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner to its fleet. The first aircraft was delivered to the airline in January 2019.

On May 10, 2018, WestJet&#x27;s unionized pilots voted 91 percent in favour of strike action. The key issue in negotiations was the outsourcing of work to operate Swoop aircraft. On May 25, 2018, WestJet and the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) agreed to a settlement process through the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.

On May 14, 2018, WestJet announced new 2-2 Premium Economy seating to replace its previous 3-3 seats which had a middle seat blocker. The new seats feature a wider configuration on 737 aircraft. The offering began on its Boeing 737 MAX-8 aircraft in winter 2018, with all 737s being reconfigured by 2020.

On May 31, 2018, WestJet operated its first flight to mainland Europe with the inaugural flight from Halifax Stanfield International Airport to Paris&#x27; Charles de Gaulle Airport.

The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) announced its application to the Canadian Government for certification of WestJet&#x27;s approximately 3,200 flight attendants on July 9, 2018. On July 31, 2018, the Government of Canada via the Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB) issued an interim order certifying CUPE as the accredited union for WestJet mainline flight attendants.

On October 12, 2018, WestJet announced its new branding, along with details on the arrival on the Boeing 787-9. WestJet changed its slogan from &quot;&quot;Owners Care&quot; to &quot;Love where you&#x27;re going&quot;&quot;, announced a new logo (however, such logo was seen in May with the announcement of the 787 Dreamliner along with its livery), announced the Boeing 787 routes and launch dates, and an overall new brand image. Boeing 787 flights were announced to commence on April 28, 2019, with service from Calgary International Airport to London Gatwick Airport, with service to Paris and Dublin following.

On May 13, 2019, WestJet announced it had reached an agreement to be purchased by Onex Corporation for $5 billion Canadian dollars. At the time, it had 13 Boeing 737 Max jets in suspended operation, with another 57 of the type ordered from the manufacturer. The purchase price of WestJet was slashed heavily due to the grounding of the MAX aircraft.

===2020–2022: COVID-19 pandemic===
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic response required by world governments including Canada, WestJet faced an unprecedented decline in demand for flights along with the rest of the aviation industry. In addition, there were numerous cases of COVID-19 reported on board WestJet flights.

In March 2020, WestJet suspended all international flights, resulting in widespread workforce adjustments. Approximately half of the employees, totalling 6,900, were laid off on March 24. Subsequently, on April 9, WestJet temporarily rehired 6,400 employees through the federal wage subsidy program (CEWS). Additional layoffs followed, with approximately 8,000 employees between April and June, as part of a restructuring plan, leaving only 4,500 employees on the payroll. Before the pandemic, WestJet employed over 14,000 individuals. By February 2021, the company laid off an additional 250 staff members due to ongoing travel restrictions. However, it&#x27;s noteworthy that a majority of employees were successfully recalled by February 2022, reflecting the company&#x27;s efforts in adapting to the challenging circumstances.
===2022–present: Focus on Western Canada and strategic low-cost plan===
On June 16, 2022, WestJet announced that it will be reaffirming the airline&#x27;s commitment to &quot;embracing its cost-conscious roots in service of affordable air travel for Canadians&quot;. With this in mind, the current CEO has announced that the airline will be returning to its low-cost roots, shifting its focus to western Canada, and investing in leisure routes. This change resulted in numerous routes and destinations in eastern Canada to be dropped.

On September 29, 2022, WestJet announced it had placed an order for an additional 42 Boeing 737 MAX 10, making the airline&#x27;s narrow-body order book the largest in Canada.

On October 6, 2022, WestJet&#x27;s CEO, Alexis von Hoensbroech, and Alberta Premier, Jason Kenney, announced a major partnership between the Government of Alberta and the WestJet Group. The agreement outlined that Calgary International Airport would become WestJet&#x27;s sole global hub and the company would designate the airport as &quot;the only airport where WestJet connects directly to intercontinental destinations&quot; Additionally, WestJet would base its entire Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet in Calgary, opening up the potential for new routes to Europe and Asia. WestJet would also base over 100 aircraft in Calgary and double its capacity at the airport before the end of the decade.

On December 5, 2022, WestJet announced its first destination in Asia, with service from Calgary International Airport to Narita International Airport beginning with three times weekly service on April 30, 2023. WestJet also announced new routes from Calgary to Barcelona–El Prat Airport and Edinburgh Airport, both being served three times a week beginning in May 2023, as well as frequency increases on existing European routes as a part of their plan to increase capacity in Calgary by more than 25% in 2023.

In November 2023, WestJet announced the restart of transatlantic service in Eastern Canada utilizing its Boeing 737 MAX 8 fleet, with the return of service from Toronto to Dublin and Edinburgh, St. John&#x27;s to London (Gatwick) and Halifax to Dublin, Edinburgh and London (Gatwick). The airline also announced the expansion of transatlantic service from Calgary with new non-stop flights to Keflavík Airport in Reykjavik, Iceland. WestJet also revealed plans to expand its Asian footprint with new seasonal service from Calgary International Airport to South Korea&#x27;s Incheon International Airport.

In June 2024, WestJet&#x27;s aircraft mechanic union launched a three-day strike, forcing over 1000 flights to be cancelled in the lead up to the Canada Day long weekend. In October 2024, WestJet will be transitioning all WestJet Link routes from Link to Encore, ending the airline&#x27;s six-year capacity purchase agreement with Pacific Coastal Airlines. The change is announced as a growth strategy for WestJet&#x27;s regional network, which will see the WestJet Link routes now being operated by WestJet Encore&#x27;s 78-seat Bombardier Q400, as opposed to Pacific Coastal&#x27;s 34-seat Saab 340B.

==Acquisition of Sunwing==
On March 2, 2022, the WestJet Group announced its intent to acquire the Canadian low-cost airline Sunwing. Both WestJet and Sunwing reported that they had reached a mutual, definitive agreement for the merger. Following the close of the transaction, the two airlines would create a new &quot;tour business operating unit&quot; which would be led by current Sunwing CEO Stephen Hunter, which would bind the two airlines&#x27; vacation units - Sunwing Vacations and WestJet Vacations - together. The &quot;tour business operating unit&quot; would be based out of Sunwing&#x27;s head office in Toronto, while the operations of Sunwing Airlines would be transitioned and managed at WestJet&#x27;s head office in Calgary. The acquisition announcement was made shortly after WestJet&#x27;s new CEO Alexis Von Hoensbroech assumed the role. Shortly after, the Canadian Competition Bureau was asked to review this intent.

On October 26, 2022, the Canadian Competition Bureau sent a letter to Transport Canada under the Government of Canada, raising &quot;significant concerns&quot; and &quot;uncertainty&quot; on the acquisition. The letter raised concerns about the elimination of competition between the two airlines, which would result in &quot;substantial lessening&quot; or &quot;prevention&quot; of competition in the sale of airline vacation packages to Canadians, specifically to ones which are for sun destinations, such as to Mexico or the Caribbean. The report stated that &quot;the proposed transaction will result in one of Canada&#x27;s largest integrated tour operations being acquired by one of its primary rivals in the provision of vacation packages.&quot; The report also stated that &quot;overall, WestJet and Sunwing account for 37 percent of non-stop capacity between Canada and sun destinations, and 72 percent of non-stop capacity between Western Canada and sun destinations.&quot; The report also outlined warnings in which for the acquisition would take place, it would likely result in &quot;higher ticket prices and lower services offered.&quot;

In the report, the Competition Bureau also raised concerns about the &quot;monopoly&quot; that the merger would create on 16 routes between Canada and Mexico or the Caribbean. However, in an emailed statement to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation which was sent on October 26, 2022, from Sunwing spokesperson Melanie Anne Filipp said that the routes which were identified by the Competition Bureau were &quot;predominately&quot; in Western Canada and accounted for a &quot;very small portion of Sunwing&#x27;s operations&quot; - just over 10 percent - and were &quot;primarily seasonal routes&quot;. As well, Filipp says that 6 out of 16 routes that the Competition Bureau had identified as a concern were no longer being operated by Sunwing. &quot;We remain confident that this transaction is good news for Canadians.&quot;

News outlets have also been quoting Air Canada and Air Transat&#x27;s failed merger. The acquisition, which was set to merge Canada&#x27;s largest airline with Canada&#x27;s third largest and top leisure airline, fell through, even after the Canadian government gave Air Canada and Transat the green light to go through with the merger, which saw Air Canada buyout Air Transat for just over US $150 million. It fell through after European Union regulators refused to grant Air Canada and Transat A.T. the go-ahead for the buyout, which is where Air Transat and Air Canada gain lots of revenue - on trans-Atlantic flights from Canada to Europe. In April 2021, Air Canada and Air Transat mutually agreed to terminate the buyout.

On March 10, 2023, the Canadian federal government formally approved the WestJet Sunwing merger. &quot;Today&#x27;s decision was not taken lightly, especially in light of everything that happened over the holidays for those who flew with Sunwing,” Canadian Transport Minister Omar Alghabra said in a statement, as he referred to the chaos during the December 2022 North American winter snowstorm that disrupted millions who had travel plans over the winter holidays. Sunwing&#x27;s handling over the situation was heavily criticized as it left thousands stranded in Cancún, Mexico. “After considering the pros and cons, we have made the decision that will allow Sunwing to continue to provide affordable vacation packages to Canadians, create more good jobs and protect current jobs as well as Canadians who have already purchased tickets.” he continued. However, with the green light, are several conditions in which the merger must follow. It goes as follows:

* Extending Sunwing vacation packages to five new Canadian cities
* Maintaining a vacations business head office in Toronto and a regional head office in Montreal for at least five years
* Improve regional connectivity and baggage handling
* Boost net employment at Sunwing&#x27;s aforementioned Toronto head office
* Gradually ending its seasonal plane-leasing practice to protect jobs in Canada (refers to Sunwing&#x27;s seasonal practices of leasing its Boeing 737 aircraft to airlines in Europe, such as TUI, whom it has leased its aircraft to during the summer season for several years now.)

On May 1, 2023, The WestJet Group completed its acquisition of Sunwing Vacations and Sunwing Airlines. Stephen Hunter, formerly the CEO of Sunwing Vacations, has been appointed CEO of the WestJet Group&#x27;s Vacations Business, responsible for all tour operating and vacation package businesses of both the Sunwing Vacations and WestJet Vacations brands. The WestJet Group&#x27;s newly combined tour operator businesses, comprising WestJet Vacations and Sunwing Vacations, will be headquartered in Toronto, Ontario and will continue to operate a Montreal office.

On June 17, 2023, WestJet confirmed it will wind down Sunwing Airlines, integrating the low-cost carrier into its mainline business within two years as part of a plan to streamline operations on an unknown date.

On September 29, 2023, WestJet stated via an announcement that they aim to merge Sunwing&#x27;s entirety into WestJet by October 2024. They plan to convert all of Sunwing&#x27;s 18 Boeing 737 aircraft into WestJet&#x27;s mainline and transition more than 2,000 current Sunwing employees into WestJet&#x27;s existing structure by that date. This merger is on top of WestJet&#x27;s decision to shut down Swoop, its former ultra-low-cost carrier which it brought into the market in 2017. As of October 2023, Swoop has been fully integrated into WestJet; however, the aircraft from Swoop retain the Swoop livery and cabin.

==Corporate affairs==
===Ownership and structure===

WestJet Airlines Ltd. is operated by WestJet Group, a private company, incorporated and domiciled in Canada, which since December 2019 has been owned by Toronto-based private equity firm Onex Corporation.
On May 13, 2019, WestJet announced that it had accepted an offer from Onex Corporation to purchase the company, a $5-billion deal that would require shareholder approval (in July) and regulatory approval. The offer was for $31 a share, substantially higher than the closing price of approximately $18 at the close of trading on the previous business day. Completion of the acquisition was announced on December 11, 2019, after the regulator had determined that WestJet will continue to meet Canadian ownership and control requirements if Onex amends its bylaws to ensure any matters voted on by the board of directors are done with a majority of Canadian directors present.

==Destinations and Hubs==

===Hubs===
WestJet currently operates two hubs.

* Calgary: WestJet&#x27;s Western Canada global hub. WestJet&#x27;s fleet of Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft are based at this airport.
* Toronto–Pearson: WestJet&#x27;s Eastern Canada hub connecting to destinations across Canada and sun destinations.

===Destinations===

WestJet and WestJet Encore currently fly to more than 100 destinations in 28 countries throughout North and Central America, the Caribbean and Europe including 39 cities in Canada and 29 in the United States.

WestJet provides the most Canadian flights to Cancún, Puerto Vallarta, Las Vegas and Orlando, offering non-stop routes (some of them seasonal) from twelve Canadian cities to Cancun and Puerto Vallarta, nine to Las Vegas and eleven to Orlando. Since 2008, WestJet is the largest international carrier, by volume of passengers, flying into Las Vegas. WestJet also serves 20 destinations in the Caribbean and seven in Mexico, some on a seasonal basis.In July 2015, WestJet announced flights to Gatwick Airport operated by Boeing 767 aircraft, which had not previously been part of the airline&#x27;s fleet, starting spring 2016.

In January 2018, WestJet announced its first flight to mainland Europe. WestJet started flying between Halifax and Paris in May 2018. The airline in this route is being operated with its new Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft.

In October 2018, new international destinations and routes were announced. Starting in 2019, WestJet began direct flights from Calgary to Dublin and Paris. WestJet is using its new Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft to fly these new routes. In addition, the current Calgary to Gatwick Airport route, which was formerly served by WestJet&#x27;s Boeing 767 aircraft, has been replaced by new Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft. At the end of October, WestJet also announced two new destinations. It began flights between Calgary and Atlanta, WestJet&#x27;s expected joint-venture carrier Delta Air Lines&#x27; largest hub, in March 2019. WestJet is the only carrier operating a direct route between Calgary and Atlanta. The airline also announced flights between Toronto and Barcelona, its second destination in mainland Europe which began in May 2019. In June 2021, WestJet announced the opening of a new route from Calgary to Amsterdam followed by Seattle in November 2021, providing convenient connections for business and leisure travellers.

In 2022, WestJet embraced a focus on offering connections to a major international hub and replaced its previous service to London Gatwick with a new route to London Heathrow Airport in March, and Rome was added to WestJet&#x27;s European offerings in May.

In 2023, WestJet strengthened its presence in the United States, and its partnership with Delta with new routes to Detroit in May and Minneapolis and Washington Dulles in June. The Detroit service strengthens WestJet&#x27;s presence in the U.S. Midwest, and Minneapolis gained year-round transborder connectivity with the new route, while Washington Dulles offers access to the political and business hub of the United States capital.

Services to Tokyo, WestJet&#x27;s first destination outside of North America and Europe, began in April 2023. Bonaire, the &#x27;B&#x27; in ABC Islands, joined WestJet&#x27;s vacation destinations in December 2023.

In 2024, the airline announced upcoming services to Reykjavík, Iceland (Keflavík) and Seoul, South Korea both to begin in May.

==Alliances and codeshare agreements==
===History===
In 1999, WestJet was in talks regarding a possible &#x27;feeder&#x27; arrangement for Air Canada&#x27;s network. These talks were discontinued when Air Canada went forward with the acquisition of Canadian Airlines the following year.

In 2005, WestJet began a limited interline agreement with Taiwan-based China Airlines, in part to test the company&#x27;s capability to partner with other carriers.

In 2006, WestJet announced it had been in talks with 70 airlines around the world interested in an interline or codeshare agreement. In August 2006, in a &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; interview, then-WestJet CEO Sean Durfy stated that WestJet was in talks with Oneworld. Durfy said that, if a deal with Oneworld were reached, it would allow WestJet to maintain its scheduling flexibility; Durfy was later quoted in 2007 saying that a deal for WestJet to join the Oneworld alliance was unlikely. Despite this, WestJet did formalize a deal with Oneworld in November 2008, to partner on sales of travel to corporate and business travellers.

In July 2008, WestJet announced it had signed a memorandum of understanding to build a distribution and codeshare agreement with U.S.-based Southwest Airlines. However, in April 2010 WestJet announced that the airline partnership with Southwest Airlines was terminated and in October 2010, WestJet partnered with American Airlines instead and later added Delta Air Lines. In light of a possible joint venture between WestJet and Delta, American and WestJet ceased their codeshare agreement on July 31, 2018.

In 2017, WestJet, easyJet and Norwegian Air Shuttle teamed up to provide direct connections at London Gatwick Airport. The scheme, dubbed by easyJet as &quot;Worldwide by easyJet&quot; allows passengers to connect from easyJet flights to American and Canadian destinations with WestJet and Norwegian.

==Fleet==
===Current fleet===
, WestJet operates an all-Boeing mainline fleet composed of the following aircraft:

===Fleet strategy===

The mainline fleet currently consists exclusively of Boeing aircraft, while wholly owned subsidiary Encore flies Bombardier Q400s. 20 aircraft were initially ordered with options for up to 25 more. The first two units were delivered in mid-June 2013. Scheduled passenger service on these aircraft began on June 24, 2013. The first Boeing 737 Next Generation, a 737-700 delivery took place in 2001, and the first deliveries of 737-600 and 737-800 aircraft began in 2005, with the final 737-600 aircraft delivered in September 2006.

Boeing confirmed on August 2, 2007, that WestJet had placed an order for 23 Boeing 737 Next Generation aircraft. The order was primarily for 737-700 but with conversion rights to Boeing 737-800s.

In the winter season before acquiring their Boeing 767s and Boeing 787 Dreamliners, WestJet temporarily wet leased some Boeing 757-200s to expand service between Alberta and Hawaii. From February through April 2011, a single aircraft was leased for this purpose; in the winter of 2011–12, a single aircraft was again leased. For the winter seasons from 2012 to 2015, this was expanded to two aircraft. In April 2013, it was announced that WestJet would sell ten of its oldest 737-700s and purchase ten 737-800s to modernize and increase capacity of its fleet.

In May 2014, CEO Gregg Saretsky announced that WestJet was considering acquiring wide-body aircraft to operate long-haul international routes. By July of the same year, Saretsky confirmed that wide-body service would begin in 2015. In late June 2014, WestJet announced that the wide-body aircraft were to be second-hand Boeing 767 (767-300ERs) sourced from Qantas. The four Boeing 767s were an average of 25 years old, which meant that they needed frequent repairs and downtime for sourcing parts. This resulted in a poor on-time performance of 38 percent in 2016, costing the airline approximately $5 million in the second quarter of 2016. In 2017, WestJet reduced the number of flights from Winnipeg and Edmonton to reduce utilization of the planes for the summer 2017, to cope with any unforeseen delays or cancellations.

In late December 2016, 77% of WestJet pilots approved a new deal that will increase pay for pilots flying wide-body aircraft such as the Boeing 767, Boeing 787 or Airbus A330. In a statement, the airline said that it was seeking more large aircraft intending to add new destinations. Saretsky also stated that he hoped for wide-body growth to be responsible, but quick. As of May 2, 2017, WestJet announced the purchase of up to 20 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft; 10 were firm orders with deliveries from 2019 through 2021, and 10 were options for delivery between 2020 and 2024. WestJet ended up only purchasing seven Boeing 787-9 and cancelled the remaining orders. It is believed that the cancelled Boeing 787 orders may have been converted to Boeing 737 MAX orders instead.

===Historical fleet===
In 2003 and 2004, WestJet donated two of its 737-200s to post-secondary schools in western Canada, one to the British Columbia Institute of Technology and a second to the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology&#x27;s Art Smith Aero Centre. In early 2005, it was announced that the Boeing 737 fleet would be retired and replaced by newer, more fuel-efficient 737 Next Generation series aircraft. On July 12, 2005, WestJet announced that it had completed the sale of its remaining 737-200 to Miami-based Apollo Aviation Group. On January 9, 2006, the last Boeing 737-200 was flown during a fly-by ceremony at the WestJet hangar in Calgary, piloted by WestJet founder Don Bell and was a charter flight from Las Vegas to Calgary.

In July 2020, WestJet retired their fleet of 4 Boeing 767s (767-300ER) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2021, it was announced that the four 767-300 aircraft from WestJet were to be among a total of 11 to be purchased by Amazon and converted to freight use.

In the past, WestJet operated the following aircraft:

===Livery===
WestJet&#x27;s aircraft are painted white except for the lettering on the fuselage, wings and vertical stabilizer.

The tail is divided roughly into slanted thirds, coloured (from front to back) navy blue, white and teal. This pattern is used on the outside of the blended winglets at the end of the wings while, on the inside, the winglets are painted white with &quot;WestJet.com&quot; in dark blue lettering.

In February 2010, WestJet introduced a special livery on one Boeing 737-800 aircraft promoting its customer-service promise, or &quot;Care-antee&quot;, in both English and French. This aircraft also featured a new tail design. In 2013, the Care-antee aircraft underwent a second livery change in partnership with Disney, featuring Mickey Mouse from the movie &quot;Fantasia&quot; and adopting the name &quot;Magic Plane&quot;. A second Disney aircraft was completed in 2015, named &quot;&quot;Frozen&quot; Plane&quot;, with characters Elsa and Anna on the vertical stabilizer and a similar theme in the cabin. Following the new CEO&#x27;s decision, the Disney aircraft were repainted into the normal livery in 2024.

In May 2018, WestJet unveiled a new livery, the first significant change since the inception of the company. It includes a new font for the word &quot;WestJet&quot;; written across the middle of the aircraft fuselage is &quot;The Spirit of Canada&quot; on the port side and &quot;L&#x27;esprit du Canada&quot; on the starboard side. An updated, stylized maple leaf on the aircraft tail is also included.

On January 17, 2019, WestJet&#x27;s first Dreamliner was delivered with the name &#x27;Clive Beddoe&#x27;, a tribute to one of its founder and former chairman of the board of directors. The aircraft is painted in its new livery.

<text>Chief information officer (CIO), chief digital information officer (CDIO) or information technology (IT) director, is a job title commonly given to the most senior executive in an enterprise who works with information technology and computer systems, in order to support enterprise goals.

Normally, the CIO reports directly to the chief executive officer, but may also report to the chief operating officer or chief financial officer. In military organizations, the CIO reports to the commanding officer. The role of chief information officer was first defined in 1981 by William R. Synnott, former senior vice president of the Bank of Boston, and William H. Gruber, a former professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management. A CIO will sometimes serve as a member of the board of directors.

==The need for CIOs==
CIOs and CDIOs play an important role in businesses that use technology and data because they provide a critical interface between the business needs, user needs, and the information and communication technology (ICT) used in the work. In recent years it has become increasingly understood that knowledge limited to just business or just IT is not sufficient for success in this role. Instead, CIOs need both kinds of knowledge to manage IT resources and to manage and plan &quot;ICT, including policy and practice development, planning, budgeting, resourcing and training.&quot; Also, CIOs are playing an increasingly important role in helping to control costs and increase profits via the use of ICT, and to limit potential organizational damage by setting up appropriate IT controls and planning for IT recovery from possible disasters.

These objectives also demand a combination of personal skills. &quot;Computer Weekly&quot; magazine highlights that &quot;53% of IT leaders report a shortage of [IT managers] with a high-level of personal skills, such as communication and leadership&quot; in the workplace. Because information technologies and digital tools evolve so quickly, organizations are sometimes challenged to find staff with the necessary combination of skills in the marketplace, and may look to train existing staff to mitigate skill shortages. CIOs are needed to bridge the gap between IT and non-IT professional roles to support effective working relationships.

==Roles and responsibilities==
The chief information officer of an organization is responsible for several business functions. First and most importantly, the CIO must fulfill the role of a business leader. The CIO makes executive decisions regarding matters such as the purchase of IT equipment from suppliers or the creation of new IT systems. Also as a business leader, the CIO is responsible for leading and directing the workforce of their specific organization. A CIO is typically &quot;required to have strong organizational skills.&quot; This is particularly relevant for the chief information officer of an organization who must balance roles and responsibilities in order to gain a competitive advantage, whilst keeping the best interests of the organization&#x27;s employees in mind. CIOs also have the responsibility of recruiting, so it is important that they work proactively to source and nurture the best employees possible.

CIOs are required to map out both the ICT strategy and ICT policy of an organization. The ICT strategy covers future-proofing, procurement, and the external and internal standards laid out by an organization. Similarly, the CIO must develop the ICT policy, which details how ICT is utilized and applied. Both are needed for the protection of the organization in the short and long term and the process of strategizing for the future. Paul Burfitt, former CIO of AstraZeneca, also outlines the role of the CIO in IT governance, which he refers to as the &quot;clarifying [of] accountability and the role of committees&quot;.

In recent years, CIOs have become more closely involved in customer-facing products. With the rising awareness in organizations that their customers are expecting digital services as part of their relationship with an organization, CIOs have been tasked with more product-oriented responsibilities.

==Risks involved==
The CIO faces a rather high risk of error and failures, as a result of the challenging nature of the role, along with a large number of responsibilities – such as the provision of finance, recruitment of professionals, establishing data protection and development of policy and strategy. The CIO of U.S company Target was forced into resignation in 2014 after the theft of 40 million credit card details and 70 million customer details by hackers. CIOs that are knowledgeable about their industry are able to adapt and thereby reduce their chances of error.

With the introduction of legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), CIOs have now become increasingly focused on how their role is regulated and can lead to financial and reputational damage to a business. However, regulations such as GDPR have also been advantageous to CIOs, enabling them to have the budget and authority in the organization to make significant changes to the way information is managed. Sabah Khan-Carter of Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corp described GDPR as &quot;a really big opportunity for most organizations&quot;.

==Educational background and technology skills==
Many candidates have a Master of Business Administration degree or a Master of Science in Management degree. More recently, CIOs&#x27; leadership capabilities, business acumen, and strategic perspectives have taken precedence over technical skills. It is now quite common for CIOs to be appointed from the business side of the organization, especially if they have project management skills.

Despite the strategic nature of the role, a 2017 survey, conducted by Logicalis, of 890 CIOs across 23 countries found that 62% of CIOs spend 60% or more of their time on day to day IT activities.

In 2012, Gartner Executive Programs conducted a global CIO survey and received responses from 2,053 CIOs from 41 countries and 36 industries. Gartner reported that survey results indicated that the top ten technology priorities for CIOs for 2013 were analytics and business intelligence, mobile technologies, cloud computing, collaboration technologies, legacy modernization, IT management, customer relationship management, virtualization, security, and enterprise resource planning.

&quot;CIO&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;State of the CIO 2008&quot; survey asked 558 IT leaders whom they report to, and the results were: CEO (41%), CFO (23%), COO (16%), corporate CIO (7%) and other (13%).

Typically, the CIO is involved with driving the analysis and re-engineering of existing business processes, identifying and developing the capability to use new tools, reshaping the enterprise&#x27;s physical infrastructure and network access, and identifying and exploiting the enterprise&#x27;s knowledge resources. Many CIOs head the enterprise&#x27;s efforts to integrate the Internet into both its long-term strategy and its immediate business plans. CIOs are often tasked with either driving or heading up crucial IT projects that are essential to the strategic and operational objectives of an organization. A good example of this would be the implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which typically has wide-ranging implications for most organizations.

Another way that the CIO role has changed is an increasing focus on service management. As SaaS, IaaS, BPO and other flexible delivery techniques are brought into organizations the CIO usually manages these 3rd party services. In essence, a CIO in the modern organization needs business skills and the ability to relate to the organization as a whole, as opposed to being a technological expert with limited functional business expertise. The CIO position is as much about anticipating technology and usage trends in the market place as it is about ensuring that the business navigates these trends with expert guidance and strategic planning aligned to the corporate strategy.

==Distinction between CIO, CDO, and CTO==
The roles of chief information officer, chief digital officer and chief technology officer are often mixed up. It has been stated that CTOs are concerned with technology itself, often customer-facing, whereas CIOs are much more concerned with its applications within the business and how they can be managed.

More specifically, CIOs oversee a business&#x27;s IT systems and functions, create and deliver strategies and policies, and focus on internal customers. In contrast to this, CTOs focus on the external customers to the organization and how technology can make the company more profitable.

The traditional definition of CTOs focused on using technology as an external competitive advantage now includes CDOs who use the power of modern technologies, online design and big data to digitize a business.

==CIO Councils==
CIO Councils bring together a number of CIOs from different organizations which aim to work together, for example across healthcare or across government. Examples include the UK public sector&#x27;s CIO Council, the London CIO Council for the healthcare sector, and the Chief Information Officers Council in the USA.

==Awards and recognition==

It is not uncommon for CIOs to be recognized and awarded annually, particularly in the technology space. These awards are commonly dictated by the significance of their contribution to the industry and generally occur in local markets only. Awards are generally judged by industry peers, or senior qualified executives such as the chief executive officer, chief operating officer or chief financial officer. Generally, awards recognize substantial impact to the local technology market.

In Australia, the top 50 CIOs are recognized annually under the CIO50 banner. In the United States of America, United Kingdom and New Zealand CIOs are recognized under the CIO100 banner.

<doc id="153854" wikidata="Q2453303" url="?curid=153854" title="Unitard">
<text>A unitard is a skintight, one-piece garment with long legs and sometimes long sleeves, usually stopping at the wrists and ankles. It differs from a leotard which does not have long legs. The leotard is also usually considered a more feminine clothing item, while the unitard is not. The garment can be thought of as a combination of a leotard and leggings, and was historically called a &quot;one-piece long legged leotard&quot;. The term &quot;unitard&quot; is mostly used in relation to sports, while it is usually referred to as a &quot;catsuit&quot; in other contexts.

==Usage in sports==
Unitards are worn by acrobats, gymnasts, dancers, equestrian vaulters, athletes, circus performers, as well as others who require overall body coverage without impeding flexibility. It is closely related to the wrestling singlet, which is basically a unitard with shorter legs.

In 1985, Anne White&#x27;s decision to wear a white unitard for the first two sets of a match in the Women&#x27;s Singles Championship at Wimbledon was widely reported. Unitards remain an unusual sight in some sports such as tennis, although Serena Williams wore one during a 2013 Wimbledon practice, and during the 2018 French Open (after which the garment type was banned there).

In the 90s, wearing unitards in figure skating was &quot;illegal in competition and discouraged in practice&quot;. And although modern rules allow them, they remain a rare sight in competitions, where dresses are seen as more appropriate by conservative judges.

The North Carolina State college men&#x27;s basketball team wore a unitard designed by Nike shortly in 1989 under coach Jim Valvano &quot;to address the issue of jerseys coming untucked&quot;, but they were retired after only two games.

Colourful unitards are the trademark of fitness coach Mr Motivator.

==Usage elsewhere==
Superheroes in comics, ads, TV shows and films are frequently depicted wearing costumes that resemble unitards, although they are rarely called that explicitly.
The members of the rock band Queen were known for wearing unitards during their concerts in the late 1970s. Some of the uniforms worn by female characters in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise have been called unitards, and criticized for promoting sexiness.

<doc id="153856" wikidata="Q731168" url="?curid=153856" title="Cal Ripken Jr.">
<text>Calvin Edwin Ripken Jr. (born August 24, 1960), nicknamed &quot;the Iron Man&quot;, is an American former baseball shortstop and third baseman who played his entire 21-season career in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Baltimore Orioles (1981–2001). One of his position&#x27;s most productive offensive players, Ripken compiled 3,184 hits, 431 home runs, and 1,695 runs batted in during his career, and he won two Gold Glove Awards for his defense. He was a 19-time All-Star and was twice named American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP), in 1983 and 1991. Ripken holds the record for consecutive games played (2,632), having surpassed Lou Gehrig&#x27;s streak of 2,130 which had stood for 56 years and which many deemed was unbreakable. In 2007, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility with 98.53% of votes, the sixth-highest election percentage ever to-date.

Born in Maryland, Ripken grew up traveling around the United States as his father, Cal Sr., was a player and coach in the Orioles&#x27; organization. After playing at Aberdeen High School, Ripken Jr. was drafted by the Orioles in the second round of the 1978 MLB draft. He reached the major leagues in 1981 as a shortstop but moved to third base in 1982, but the following year, he was shifted back to shortstop, his long-time position for Baltimore. That year, Ripken also won the AL Rookie of the Year Award and began his consecutive games played streak. In 1983, he won a World Series championship over the Philadelphia Phillies and his first AL MVP Award. One of Ripken&#x27;s best years came in 1991 when he was named an All-Star, won the Home Run Derby, and was the recipient of his first All-Star Game MVP Award, his second AL MVP Award, and first Gold Glove Award. He broke the consecutive games played record on September 6, 1995, in his 2,131st consecutive game, which fans voted as the league&#x27;s &quot;most memorable moment&quot; in the history of the game in an MLB.com poll; Ripken voluntarily ended his 17-year streak at 2,632 games before the final home game of the 1998 season. He switched back to third base for the final five years of his career. In 2001, his final season, Ripken was named the All-Star Game MVP and was honored with the Commissioner&#x27;s Historic Achievement Award.

Ripken is considered one of the best shortstops in baseball history. At , , he pioneered the way for the success of taller, larger shortstops. He holds the record for most home runs hit as a shortstop, at 345, breaking the record of 298 previously held by Ernie Banks, and was selected as the starting shortstop for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Ripken is a best-selling author and the President and CEO of Ripken Baseball, Inc., whose goal is to expand the love of baseball from a grassroots level. Since his retirement, he has purchased three minor league baseball teams, and a minority stake with the Orioles. He has been active in charity work throughout his career and is still considered an ambassador of the game. He lives in Annapolis, Maryland, and is married to Laura Ripken, née Kiessling, a judge on the Appellate Court of Maryland.

==Early life==
Ripken was born in Havre de Grace, Maryland, the son of Violet Roberta &quot;Vi&quot; Ripken (née Gross) and Cal Ripken Sr. He has German, English, and Irish ancestry. Though the Ripkens called Aberdeen, Maryland, their home, they were often on the move because of Cal Sr.&#x27;s coaching duties with the Baltimore Orioles organization. Cal Sr., in fact, was in Topeka, Kansas, with one of his teams when his son was born. Cal Jr. grew up around baseball and got started in it at a very young age. He was able to receive instruction from players on his father&#x27;s teams, most notably from Doug DeCinces. He also got advice from his father, who once remarked to his mother that his questions were better than the ones reporters had. At the age of three, Ripken knew he wanted to be a ballplayer, and at the age of 10, Ripken &quot;knew the game inside and out&quot;. Ripken and his brother Billy attended Aberdeen High School. They both played baseball there; Cal also played soccer. He has two other siblings, Ellen and Fred.

Ripken began his high school career playing second base; his coach, Don Morrison, said, &quot;I was considering moving him to short, but I was unsure if his arm was strong enough.&quot; Despite Morrison&#x27;s concerns, Ripken did move to shortstop as a sophomore, combining strong fielding with a team-leading 10 runs batted in (RBI). Needing pitching help, the Aberdeen Eagles began using Ripken as a pitcher as well in his junior year. He responded by striking out 55 batters in innings pitched with three shutouts while batting .339 with 21 hits and nine RBIs. He was named the Harford County Most Valuable Player (MVP) while helping Aberdeen become county champions for the first time since 1959. During his senior year, Ripken again had a strong season, lifting his batting average to .688 at one point and posting a 0.79 ERA with 45 strikeouts over his first 26 innings. In the playoffs, Ripken pitched the state championship game against Thomas Stone High School.

The Eagles trailed 3–1 when Ripken, noting that rain was coming and that the game would be canceled and replayed because the Eagles had not yet played the fourth inning, made nine throws to first base to ensure the game would be replayed. When the game was played the next week, Ripken struck out 17, allowed two hits, and threw a complete game as Aberdeen won the state championship. He threw 102 pitches in the 7–1 victory.

==Minor league career==
The Baltimore Orioles drafted Ripken in the second round of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft 48th overall. Despite a story written by SABR, Ripken was selected with the Orioles&#x27; predetermined draft pick, not through a forfeited pick from the Boston Red Sox after the Sox selected Dick Drago in the 1977 re-entry draft. The Orioles would select catcher Cecil Whitehead with the pick they received from Boston two picks after Ripken. 

On deciding to go straight from high school to the professional level, he said, &quot;When the colleges started coming around, Dad and I talked about mostly whether I was going to pursue a career in baseball. If I had the ability, the feeling was to get on with it, and if it didn&#x27;t work out, start over again in college at 25 or 26.&quot; Ripken played both pitcher and shortstop in high school; in fact, the Orioles were the only team not just interested in his pitching ability. The Orioles decided to start him playing shortstop in the minor leagues, deciding it would be easier for him to transition back to pitching if necessary than it would be for him to start hitting again.

In 1978, to begin Ripken&#x27;s minor league career, the Orioles assigned him to the Bluefield Orioles of the rookie Appalachian League. He batted .264 with 63 hits, no home runs, and 24 RBIs, failing to make the league&#x27;s all-rookie team. 

In 1979, Ripken moved up to the Single-A Miami Orioles of the Florida State League. Shortly into the season, Miami manager Lance Nichols decided to move Ripken to third base, saying, &quot;Cal was having some problems at short, so naturally I decided to shift him to third ... Third base was a perfect fit for Cal and our team.&quot; On July 2, Ripken hit his first professional home run, a game-winner in the 12th inning against Joseph Abone of the West Palm Beach Expos. Ripken batted .303, hit five home runs, led the league with 28 doubles, and had 54 RBIs while playing in all 105 of Miami&#x27;s games. He was named an All-Star after the season. His performance earned him a brief call-up to the Charlotte Orioles of the Double-A Southern League; Ripken batted .180 in a month with them, albeit with three home runs. 

Ripken began 1980 with Charlotte. His manager at Charlotte, Jimmy Williams, predicted him to set the team home run record, and Ripken did not disappoint. At season&#x27;s end, he had 25 home runs, besting the previous record by four. He also had 28 doubles, 78 RBIs, and a .492 slugging percentage. Ripken was named an All-Star while helping Charlotte win the Southern League championship.

In 1981, Ripken was added to Baltimore&#x27;s 40-man roster. He attended spring training with the Orioles, but was sent to the Rochester Red Wings of the Triple-A International League to start the season. At Rochester, Ripken played in the longest professional baseball game. Ripken started at third base and played all 33 innings against the Pawtucket Red Sox (which featured another future Hall of Famer, Wade Boggs) in a game that took parts of three days to complete. Ripken hit 23 home runs for Rochester while batting .288 with 75 RBIs in 114 games. He was named the International League Rookie of the Year.

==Major league career==

===1981–1986===

The Orioles were planning to keep Ripken in Rochester through 1981, but searching for improvement in the second half of the 1981 season, they called him up on August 7. Manager Earl Weaver planned to have Ripken take over the role of utility infielder, in place of Wayne Krenchicki, who had been sent down to make room for Ripken on the roster. He made his debut on August 10 as a pinch runner for Ken Singleton in the 12th inning of a game against the Kansas City Royals. Ripken scored on a hit by John Lowenstein, giving the Orioles the win. His first major league hit came six days later against Dennis Lamp of the Chicago White Sox. Ripken finished the season batting .182 without an extra-base hit as the Orioles finished fourth in the second half of the season.

Ripken received the third base job for the Orioles in 1982 when the team traded DeCinces before the start of the season. He homered in his very first at-bat of the first game of the Orioles&#x27; 1982 season against Dennis Leonard of Kansas City as part of a three-hit outing. However, he slumped to begin the season; his batting average was .118 through May 1. Ripken looked for advice from several Orioles players and coaches but was most aided by advice from Reggie Jackson: &quot;Just know what you know you can do, not what everybody else tells you to do.&quot; After that, Ripken hit well for the rest of the season. On May 29, Ripken did not play the second game of a doubleheader, the last time he missed a game until 1998. On July 1, Weaver decided to permanently shift Ripken to shortstop, deciding that it was harder to find a shortstop who could hit than it was to find a third baseman who could hit. Weaver said, &quot;You never know. Rip might be a great shortstop.&quot; Ripken hit 28 home runs that year en route to winning the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award. Aided by Ripken, the Orioles contended for the playoffs until they lost to the Milwaukee Brewers on the final day of the season.

Ripken advanced even more in 1983, having what would be one of the best years of his career. He played well all season on the way to earning the first of 19 All-Star berths. Roommate Rick Dempsey gave this analysis of Ripken&#x27;s performance: &quot;Certainly there were pitchers who faced him in 1982 and made or tried to make adjustments against him. But Cal was determined and worked hard to offset their adjustments.&quot; At season&#x27;s end, Ripken had set Orioles&#x27; records for RBIs by a shortstop (102) and hits by all players (211). He led the major leagues in hits and doubles (47) while also leading the AL with 121 runs scored. As a shortstop, he led the league in fielding percentage (.970), assists (534), and double plays (111), although he did not win the Gold Glove Award. After the season, he was named the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP), hitting .318 with 27 home runs. Ripken became the first player in MLB history to win Rookie of the Year and MVP Awards in consecutive seasons.

Ripken made the playoffs for the first time as the Orioles won the AL East in 1983. The Orioles defeated the White Sox in the ALCS before beating the Philadelphia Phillies four games to one in the 1983 World Series. In the series, Ripken hit just .167 with no homers and only one RBI. Although not contributing significantly in the World Series with his bat, he made a number of key plays defensively at shortstop, including the final out of the series on a Garry Maddox lineout in Game 5. Before the 1984 season, Ripken signed a four-year contract for &quot;about&quot; $1 million a year, the largest contract the Orioles had ever given to a player of his age. Again, he was named to the All-Star Game. He racked up another fine season, batting .304 with 27 home runs, 86 RBIs, and 103 runs scored. Although he failed to win a Gold Glove, he set an AL record with 583 assists. The Orioles had a winning record but only managed to finish in fifth place. Ripken&#x27;s streak nearly came to an end in 1985. Against the Texas Rangers in the second game of the season, he sprained his ankle on a fielding play. Ripken finished the game, but afterward, Dr. Charles Silverstein ordered him to rest for 24 hours. However, the Orioles had an off day after that game, and Ripken was back for their next game. During the season, Ripken was managed by his father when Cal Sr. filled in between Joe Altobelli and Weaver for one game on June 14. Ripken finished the year batting .282 with 26 home runs and 110 RBIs while also leading the league with 123 double plays and 286 putouts.
During June 1986, Ripken recorded a 17-game hitting streak. It was a tough season for the Orioles, as they finished last for the first time in their tenure in Baltimore. In a speech to the team before the All-Star break, Weaver criticized the healthy players on the team for not hitting, except Ripken. &quot;Do you know the kid hasn&#x27;t missed an infield practice all year? Now, he&#x27;s going to the All-Star Game,&quot; Weaver said. He batted .282 with 81 RBIs, a drop partly because the Orioles scored 110 fewer runs than the year before. He was the first Oriole other than Eddie Murray since 1979 to lead the team in home runs, with 25.

===1987–1990===
Cal Ripken Sr. replaced the retired Weaver as manager of the Orioles at the beginning of the 1987 season. That year, Ripken Sr. became the first manager to write two of his sons into the lineup card when both Ripken Jr. and his brother and fellow Oriole, Billy Ripken, played in the same game on July 11. Later in the season, Ripken Sr. decided to take Ripken Jr. out of the game on September 14, in a blow-out loss to the Toronto Blue Jays at Exhibition Stadium. Ron Washington replaced him in the eighth inning, ending Ripken&#x27;s streak of 8,243 consecutive innings played. Ripken Sr. called the streak a &quot;burden&quot; after the game, saying, &quot;I had to do it sometime.&quot; Consecutive innings streaks have not always been recorded, but Ripken&#x27;s remains unchallenged by historians. Ripken finished the year batting a career-low .252, but he still hit 27 home runs, had 98 RBIs, and walked a career-high 81 times. He also recorded a .982 fielding percentage.

The Orioles considered having Ripken replace Ray Knight at third base in 1988, but they decided to keep him at shortstop. After the Orioles started the season 0–6, Ripken Sr. was fired and replaced by Frank Robinson. The Orioles started the year 0–21, with Ripken slumping as well to open the season. He finished the year batting just .264, although he led major league shortstops with 23 home runs and 81 RBIs. He also had a particularly memorable play in the All-Star Game, making a tremendous catch and strong throw to retire Will Clark in the second inning. Ken Rosenthal of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; called it &quot;the gem of the evening.&quot;

During the 1988 season, Ripken had signed a three-year contract with an option for a fourth year, preventing him from being a free agent at season&#x27;s end. On August 2, 1989, he and Billy combined for seven hits against the Boston Red Sox, with Cal Jr. providing a game-winning hit late in the game. That was an AL record for hits by brothers; the major league record was held by Lloyd and Paul Waner, who had eight on June 25, 1932. Fifteen days later, he passed Steve Garvey by playing in his 1,208th straight game, moving to third on baseball&#x27;s all-time list behind Lou Gehrig and Everett Scott. Despite this accomplishment, Ray Robinson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Few regarded Ripken... or anyone else, as the successor to the Iron Horse.&quot; The Orioles, after posting three straight losing seasons, contended for the playoffs most of the year before missing out in the final week of the season. Ripken slumped in September, as he had only seven hits in his final 55 at bats. He batted .257 in 1989 but was especially impressive for his fielding; he once went 47 games in a row without an error and finished the year with a .990 fielding percentage.

Ripken slumped offensively in 1990, batting .209 through his first 59 games. However, throughout the year, he impressed players and fans with his fielding. On June 12, he broke Mark Belanger&#x27;s Baltimore record for most consecutive errorless chances by a shortstop. He went 67 straight games before experiencing what was originally scored an error on June 26. However, official scorer Bill Steka decided the error was really Mike Devereaux&#x27;s fault and changed the call the next day. Ripken continued the streak to 95 games, breaking the Major League record for shortstops and setting the AL record for infielders other than third basemen. On June 12, he also passed Scott to move into second place all-time for consecutive games played. The milestone came at Memorial Stadium; however, the fans booed him because of his offensive slump. Ripken finished the year batting .250, leading the Orioles with 21 home runs, 84 RBIs, 150 hits, and 78 runs scored. He and Billy tied for the team lead with 28 doubles. Ripken committed only three errors in 1990, shattering the previous record of six in a season. Despite his fielding accomplishments, Ozzie Guillén, who had committed 17 errors, won the Gold Glove Award. Some felt that Ripken should have won the award: Tim Kurkjian called the vote a &quot;crime&quot;, and Bobby Valentine stated that he was, &quot;embarrassed by the actions of my peers.&quot;

===1991–1995===

Ripken had a career year in 1991. Through the All-Star break, his batting average was .348, making him the first shortstop to be leading the league in average through that point since Lou Boudreau in 1947. He finished the season by hitting .323 with a career-high 34 home runs and 114 RBIs. In addition, Ripken hit 46 doubles, stole a career-high six bases, and hit five triples while posting his career lowest strikeout rate and fewest strikeouts in a season with 600 or more plate appearances. He became the first Major League shortstop ever to tally 30 home runs and 200 or more hits or 30 home runs and 40 or more doubles.

Ripken won his second AL MVP award, his first Gold Glove Award, the All-Star Game MVP Award (going two for three including a three-run home run off Dennis Martínez), the Gatorade Home Run Derby contest (hitting a then-record 12 home runs in 22 swings, including seven consecutive homers to start the contest), Louisville Slugger &quot;Silver Slugger Award&quot;, Associated Press (AP) Player of the Year Award, and &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Player of the Year Award. The only other player in MLB history to win all those awards in the same season, excluding the Home Run Derby, was Maury Wills in 1962. His home run off of former Orioles and then Montreal Expos pitcher Dennis Martínez was the defining moment of American League&#x27;s 4–2 victory in the 1991 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. As a result, Ripken was the first player to win both the Home Run Derby and All-Star Game MVP Award in the same year. As for his regular-season MVP award, he was the first to win the award in the American League while playing with a sub-.500 club; the Orioles finished in sixth place that year with a 67–95 record. Ripken was only the second player to be named league MVP on a team with a losing record; Andre Dawson was the first in 1987, winning the NL MVP with the last-place Chicago Cubs.

At the end of the 1991 season, Memorial Stadium, the Orioles&#x27; home since 1954, saw its last MLB game against the Tigers. Ripken was the last Oriole to bat at the stadium, hitting into a double play against Detroit&#x27;s Frank Tanana on October 6, 1991.

During the 1992 season, Ripken and the Orioles tried to work out a new contract. Several times throughout the season, Ripken endured batting slumps. He said after the season, &quot;I don&#x27;t like to make excuses for the fact that I wasn&#x27;t hitting, but I was distracted ... I just felt like the Orioles were playing mind games with me. Whether that was right or wrong, it was bothering me.&quot; On August 22, Ripken finally signed a five-year, $30.5 million contract, the largest in baseball history at the time. Ripken&#x27;s slumps continued, and he was even booed by Orioles&#x27; fans late in the season. He finished the year batting .251 with career-lows in home runs (14) and RBIs (72). The Orioles contended for the playoffs much of the year, and were not eliminated until September 27. However, he did win his second Gold Glove Award.
For the first time in Ripken&#x27;s career, he became the only Ripken in the Orioles&#x27; organization, as the Orioles ousted his father as coach and traded Billy to Texas. His slump continued at the start of the 1993 season, but Ripken managed to get out of it in May by adopting a taller batting stance. Because of his early-season struggles, some criticized him for playing every day. Bobby Bonds said of Ripken&#x27;s playing every day, &quot;That&#x27;s idiotic. If I were his manager, he&#x27;d be out of there.&quot; Oriole coach Davey Lopes responded that only Ripken could tell whether or not he needed a day off. On June 6, Ripken injured his knee during a brawl against the Seattle Mariners and was convinced for most of the next day that he would be unable to play. However, the knee felt better at gametime, enabling the streak to continue. Ripken achieved a personal milestone on July 10, when he collected his 2,000th career hit, during a game at Oriole Park at Camden Yards against Wilson Álvarez of the White Sox. Because of Ripken&#x27;s struggles, most managers and some sportswriters felt he should be left out of the All-Star Game in Baltimore that year; however, the fans gave him more than two million votes to ensure his spot. Following the All-Star break, Ripken&#x27;s hitting improved greatly, as he batted .300 with 14 home runs and 46 RBIs for the rest of the season. He finished the year batting .257 with 24 home runs and 90 RBIs.

Before the 1994 season, the Elias Sports Bureau informed the Orioles that Ripken had surpassed Ernie Banks for most career home runs as a shortstop with his 278th on July 15 against Scott Erickson. Banks met Ripken at a ceremony on February 9 and said, &quot;I&#x27;m extremely happy that he broke this record because it give me a chance to come back and be remembered too.&quot; Ripken started the season strong, batting .340 with 19 RBIs through April. On May 24, Ripken had six RBIs, including his 300th home run against Teddy Higuera, as the Orioles rallied from a 5–0 deficit to defeat the Brewers 13–5. On August 1, he played in his 2,000th consecutive game, a 1–0 victory over the Twins at the Metrodome. Through 112 games, Ripken batted .315 with 13 home runs and 75 RBIs before the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike canceled the rest of the season.
Many baseball fans within and outside of the United States tuned into ESPN to watch Ripken surpass Lou Gehrig&#x27;s 56-year-old record for consecutive games played (2,130 games). The game, between the Orioles and the California Angels, still ranks as one of the network&#x27;s most-watched baseball games (baseball&#x27;s most-watched game was Game 7 of the 1986 World Series). Cal&#x27;s children, Rachel and Ryan, threw out the ceremonial first balls. Both President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore were at the game; Clinton was with the commentators on ESPN for the Orioles&#x27; half of the fourth inning. The Orioles erected special box seats for the game to raise money for the Johns Hopkins University to study Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease. When the game became official after the bottom of the fifth inning, the numerical banners that displayed Ripken&#x27;s streak on the wall of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Warehouse at Camden Yards outside the stadium&#x27;s right-field wall changed from 2130 to 2131.
Ripken received a standing ovation from the crowd, the opposing players, and the umpires that lasted more than 22 minutes, one of the longest standing ovations for any athlete; ESPN did not go to a commercial break during the entire ovation. During the ovation, Ripken did a lap around the entire Camden Yards warning track to shake hands and give high-fives to the fans.

After the game concluded, there was an elaborate ceremony which included a number of speeches from dignitaries including Joe DiMaggio, a teammate of Gehrig. During his speech, Ripken said, &quot;Tonight I stand here, overwhelmed, as my name is linked with the great and courageous Lou Gehrig. I&#x27;m truly humbled to have our names spoken in the same breath. This year has been unbelievable. I&#x27;ve been cheered in ballparks all over the country. People not only showed me their kindness, but more importantly, they demonstrated their love of the game of baseball. I give my thanks to baseball fans everywhere. Tonight, I want to make sure you know how I feel. As I grew up here, I not only had dreams of being a big league ballplayer, but also of being a Baltimore Oriole. For all of your support over the years, I want to thank you, the fans of Baltimore, from the bottom of my heart. This is the greatest place to play.&quot;

Reflecting on that evening after his election to the Hall of Fame, Ripken said, &quot;Bobby Bonilla and Rafael Palmeiro pushed me out of the dugout and said, &#x27;Hey, if you don&#x27;t do a lap around this thing, we&#x27;ll never get the game started.&#x27; I thought it was a ridiculous sort of thing ... but as I started to do it, the celebration of 50,000 started to be very one-on-one and very personal. I started seeing people I knew ... Those were the people that had been around the ballpark all those years, and it was really a wonderful human experience.&quot;

Ripken hit .262 in 1995 with 17 home runs and had 88 RBIs.

===1996–2001===

Ripken began the 1996 season slowly, but his playing improved as the season went on. On June 14 at Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City against the Royals, Ripken broke the world record of consecutive games played by playing in his 2,216th. The record had been held by Sachio Kinugasa of Japan. Kinugasa was at the game to watch Ripken break his record. On July 15, Ripken was moved to third base as an experiment, with Manny Alexander taking the shortstop position. He was told the change would be permanent but was moved back to shortstop after Alexander had one hit in his six games at shortstop. Ripken appeared in 163 games during the regular season in 1996, batting .278 with 26 home runs, 102 RBIs, and a .980 fielding percentage at shortstop. He returned to the playoffs for the first time in 13 years as the Orioles won the AL Wild Card. In the AL Division Series, Baltimore defeated Cleveland in four games, with Ripken batting .444 in the series. His average fell to .250 in the ALCS as the Orioles were defeated in five games by the Yankees.

In 1997, the Orioles signed free-agent shortstop Mike Bordick from the Oakland Athletics and moved Ripken back to third base permanently. General manager Pat Gillick said that the move was made not because of problems by Ripken but because more defensive options were available at shortstop than at third base. Had Ripken not wanted to move back to third base, the Orioles likely would have signed Tim Naehring instead.

Ripken was scheduled to become a free agent following the 1997 season, but at the start of the year he agreed to a two-year extension with the Orioles. During the season, he suffered from nerve damage that at times kept him from being able to sit on the bench. However, he did not miss a game and batted .270 with 17 home runs and 84 RBIs as the Orioles again made the playoffs—this time by winning the AL East. Ripken batted .438 as the Orioles defeated the Mariners in four games in the ALDS. He batted .348 and hit a home run in the ALCS, but the Orioles fell to Cleveland in six games.

Ripken batted .271 with 14 home runs and 61 RBIs in 1998. On September 20, before the final home game of the season against the Yankees, Ripken decided to end his streak at 2,632 games, having surpassed Gehrig&#x27;s previous record by 502 games. Rookie third baseman Ryan Minor started in his place, at first thinking it was a rookie prank. Realizing that the streak was coming to an end, the fans, his teammates, and the visiting Yankees (with David Wells being the first to notice that Ripken was not playing during batting practice) gave Ripken an ovation after the game&#x27;s first out was recorded. Ripken later stated that he decided to end the streak at the end of the season to avoid any offseason controversy about his playing status and to end the streak entirely on his own terms while he still could. Ripken returned to the lineup for the final seven games of the season, on the road against the Toronto Blue Jays and Boston Red Sox.
In 1999, Ripken had the highest batting average of his career, at .340. Although he was injured at both the beginning and the end of the 1999 season and also mourned the loss of his father and former coach Cal Ripken Sr. only a few days before 1999&#x27;s opening game, he hit 18 homers in 332 at-bats (one HR every 18.4 AB&#x27;s). He had the best individual game of his career, going 6-for-6 with two home runs off John Smoltz and tying a club record with 13 total bases against the Atlanta Braves on June 13. On September 2, he hit the 400th home run of his career against Rolando Arrojo of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.

Ripken&#x27;s 1999 season ended early due to injury when he was only nine hits away from joining the 3,000 hit club. He achieved the milestone early in the 2000 season in the April 15th game against the Twins at the Metrodome when he singled off reliever Héctor Carrasco; Eddie Murray, another member of the club and the Orioles&#x27; first-base coach, was the first to congratulate him. Ripken had a good night at the plate, recording three hits, the third of which was the milestone. Ripken missed all of July and August with a back injury. He was selected to the All-Star Game but sat out because of the injury, marking the first All-Star Game that he missed since his rookie season. In 83 games, Ripken batted .256 (his lowest total since 1992) with 15 home runs and 56 RBIs.

In June 2001, Ripken announced he would retire at the end of the season. He was voted the starting third baseman in the All-Star Game at Seattle&#x27;s Safeco Field on July 10, 2001. In a tribute to Ripken&#x27;s achievements and stature in the game, shortstop Alex Rodriguez (unknowingly foreshadowing his own future) insisted on exchanging positions with third baseman Ripken for the first inning, so that Ripken could play shortstop as he had for most of his career. That move allowed Ripken to claim the record of most MLB All-Star Game appearances at shortstop. In the third inning, Ripken made his first plate appearance and was greeted with a standing ovation. Ripken then homered off the first pitch from Chan Ho Park. Ripken ended up with All-Star MVP honors, becoming one of four players in MLB history with multiple All-Star Game MVP Awards (1991 and 2001) and the only player to be named All-Star Game MVP in two different decades.

The Orioles planned to retire Ripken&#x27;s #8 in a ceremony before the final home game of the 2001 season, in late September. Ripken&#x27;s final game was originally set to be played at Yankee Stadium; however, the September 11, 2001, attacks led to the postponement of a week&#x27;s worth of games. The games missed were added onto the end of the season&#x27;s schedule. Because all the games the Orioles missed were at home, this changed the location of Ripken&#x27;s final game to Oriole Park, much to the delight of Orioles fans. On October 6, Ripken ended his career in the on-deck circle in the bottom of the ninth inning. Longtime teammate Brady Anderson, also playing in his last game for the Orioles, swung and missed on a fastball high and tight on a 3–2 count to end the game. After the game, Ripken gave a speech thanking the fans for their support over 20 seasons. Ripken was healthier in his final season than he had been over his last two, as he appeared in 128 games. He batted a career-low .239 with 14 home runs and 68 RBIs.

==Charity==

Throughout his career, Ripken has contributed his time and money to numerous charitable organizations. Following the signing of his new contract in 1984, Ripken announced he would distribute 1984 Orioles tickets to underprivileged children in Harford County, donate to the Harford Center, and donate to the Baltimore School for the Performing Arts. In 1988, he and wife Kelly founded the Cal Ripken Jr., Lifelong Learning Center, which is dedicated to teaching adults to read. In 1992, MLB recognized him with the Roberto Clemente Award. In 1997, Ripken received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council members and Baltimore Orioles co-owners Peter Angelos and Tom Clancy.

Ripken has made donations to many various charitable causes, including donations supporting research on Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease. After he broke Gehrig&#x27;s record, the Orioles, along with private donors, created the Cal Ripken/Lou Gehrig Fund for Neuromuscular Research at Johns Hopkins University. Along with his brother Billy, he formed the Cal Ripken Sr., Foundation in 2001 to give underprivileged children the opportunity to attend baseball camps around the country and learn the game. The Foundation is a branch of Ripken Baseball. In addition to controlling these camps and Ripken&#x27;s minor league teams, Ripken Baseball operates for-profit camps and designs ballfields for youth, college, and professional teams. He gives speeches about his time in baseball and some of the lessons he has learned. Between 2001 and 2004, inclusive, Ripken served as commissioner of the White House Tee Ball Initiative of President George W. Bush, in which capacity he worked to promote the value of teamwork amongst players and volunteership amongst the public and helped to teach tee ball fundamentals to teams of children at the White House.
In 2007, Ripken, along with Andre Agassi, Muhammad Ali, Lance Armstrong, Warrick Dunn, Mia Hamm, Jeff Gordon, Tony Hawk, Andrea Jaeger, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Mario Lemieux, and Alonzo Mourning founded Athletes for Hope, a charitable organization, which helps professional athletes get involved in charitable causes and inspires millions of non-athletes to volunteer and support the community. Ripken also announced a partnership with Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities, with the donation of US$1 million in cash and equipment from the Cal Ripken Sr. Foundation.

On August 13, 2007, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced that Ripken had been named Special Sports Envoy for the US State Department and that he would be going to China in October: &quot;... we&#x27;re just delighted that somebody of Cal Ripken&#x27;s stature is going to be someone who will go out and represent America so well and represent what we consider to be American values, but universal values; that hard work and diligence and the willingness to really put it all on the line every day is something that kids need to learn&quot;, said Rice. &quot;A Shortstop in China&quot; premiered on the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network on May 8, 2009, chronicling Ripken&#x27;s trip to China to share the game of baseball with youth and coaches while nurturing American-Chinese diplomacy. The documentary included footage from the 11 clinics Cal and former Oriole B. J. Surhoff held from Beijing to Guangzhou. The documentary also showed Ripken accepting his appointment from Rice and featured a variety of interviews, from Ripken&#x27;s wife Kelly to former Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, Karen Hughes.

On May 31, 2008, Ripken received an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree from the University of Delaware and served as the university&#x27;s commencement speaker. On May 19, 2013, Ripken received an honorary Doctor of Public Service degree from the University of Maryland while serving as the university&#x27;s general commencement speaker.

In an interview with Ray Robinson, Ripken said, &quot;My personal philosophy is to get a feeling of fulfillment through my work. I have a desire to create something. I guess that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve long been fascinated by two books, &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; and &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; [both by Ayn Rand]. The leading figure in &#x27;The Fountainhead,&#x27; an architect named Howard Roark, is someone I&#x27;ve thought about a good deal.&quot;

==Legacy==
At , , Ripken was a departure from the prototypical shortstop of the time—small, fleet-of-foot players who played a defensively difficult position but often did not post the home run and batting average totals that an outfielder might. Power hitting shortstops such as Alex Rodriguez, Nomar Garciaparra and Miguel Tejada are often seen by fans to be part of Ripken&#x27;s legacy.

Nonetheless, Ripken demonstrated the ability to play excellent defense at shortstop, and as a result remained a fixture there for well over a decade, leading the league in assists several times, winning the Gold Glove twice, and, in 1990, setting the MLB record for best fielding percentage in a season at his position. Though not a flashy fielder, Ripken displayed excellent fundamentals, and studied batters and even his own pitching staff so he could position himself to compensate for his lack of physical speed. Ripken&#x27;s legacy as a fielder is reflected by his place near the top of almost every defensive statistical category—he holds at least one all-time record (for either season, career, or most seasons leading the league) in assists, putouts, fielding percentage, double plays, and fewest errors. Ripken&#x27;s career range factor was 4.73 (and as high as 5.50 for a single season), a mark few shortstops have reached.

Ripken&#x27;s power, which led to records such as most home runs by a shortstop and 13th place in career doubles, had consequences. His propensity to drive the ball often led to his grounders getting to fielders quickly for tailor-made double-play balls. In 1999, Ripken passed Hank Aaron as the player who had grounded into the most double plays in his career (a record that was again broken by Albert Pujols in 2017). Ripken is third on the fielding side for double plays by a shortstop (1565, behind Omar Vizquel&#x27;s 1734 and Ozzie Smith&#x27;s 1590).

Ripken was also notable for never settling on a signature batting stance during his long career. Sometimes referred to as &quot;the man of 1,000 stances&quot;, Ripken would change his stance in response to a slump, or if his current choice &quot;didn&#x27;t feel good.&quot; When asked about his propensity for experimentation during an interview, Ripken responded that a batting stance &quot;was only a starting point&quot;.

A poll of fans by &quot;MLB.com&quot; ranked Ripken&#x27;s 2,131st straight game the &quot;Most Memorable Moment&quot; in MLB history, leading such moments as Gehrig&#x27;s farewell speech in 1939 and Jackie Robinson&#x27;s breaking of the color barrier in 1947. The write-up in the 1996 &quot;Sporting News Baseball Guide&quot;, which was written shortly after Ripken set the record, called the streak &quot;what almost everyone considered the high point of the major league season.&quot; In 2005, the Orioles honored Ripken on the 10th anniversary of his 2,131st consecutive game. After the top of the fifth inning, the numbers 2130 on the warehouse behind the stadium changed to 2131, just as they did on September 6, 1995.

Ripken has stated that he never felt comfortable being compared to Gehrig. 

Billy and Cal Ripken are one of only four two-brother combinations in major league history to play second base/shortstop on the same club. The others are Garvin and Granny Hamner for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1945; the twins Eddie and Johnny O&#x27;Brien with the Pittsburgh Pirates in the mid-1950s, and Frank and Milt Bolling for the Detroit Tigers in 1958.

On January 9, 2007, Ripken was elected to the Hall of Fame, appearing on 537 out of 545 of the ballots cast (98.53%), eight votes short of a unanimous selection. His percentage is the sixth-highest in history, behind Mariano Rivera (100%), Derek Jeter (99.75%), Ken Griffey Jr. (99.32%), Tom Seaver (98.84%), and Nolan Ryan (98.79%). Tony Gwynn, who was appearing on his first ballot as well, was chosen alongside Ripken. Both Hall of Fame-Elects were formally inducted on July 29, 2007. The induction ceremony was attended by a record 75,000 people including special guests of Ripken: John Travolta, Kelly Preston, Steve Geppi, and Ron Shapiro (Ripken&#x27;s agent during his career).

Ripken has received several tributes outside of baseball. On September 23, 2001, the NASCAR Winston Cup series and MBNA renamed the fall race at Dover International Speedway in Dover, Delaware, naming the race the MBNA Cal Ripken Jr. 400. The race paid tribute to the legacy of Ripken, who was in attendance greeting the competing drivers as they crossed the stage during driver introductions. Driver Bobby Labonte had a special paint scheme on his #18 Interstate Batteries car featuring Baltimore Orioles colors along with Ripken&#x27;s retirement seal. The race was won by Dale Earnhardt Jr., who was then driving the #8 car. The race was also the first race held after the September 11, 2001, attacks as the race scheduled for Loudon a week earlier had been postponed in the wake of the attacks. On March 30, 2008, I-395&#x27;s eastern branch in Baltimore, from I-95 to Conway Street, was named &quot;Cal Ripken Way&quot;.

Because of Ripken&#x27;s success during his career, he became a prominent advertising figure, appearing in advertisements for brands such as Nike, Chevrolet, True Value Hardware, Wheaties, PowerAde, and other companies, some of which were small, Maryland businesses. These advertisements would often stress Ripken&#x27;s &quot;dependability, durability, and wholesomeness&quot;, linking that to their product. Ripken became an emblem to Americans through his hard work, loyalty to the Orioles, and his charity off the field.

Ripken was humble about his success, once saying, Author Glen Macnow responded to Ripken&#x27;s comments by writing, &quot;Anyone who has seen Cal Ripken Jr. play knows differently.&quot;

==Personal life==
Ripken was married to Kelly Geer. They have a daughter, Rachel, and a son, Ryan. On April 28, 2016, Ripken and Geer finalized their divorce after a one-year separation.

In 2018 Ripken married Laura Kiessling, who is a judge in the Appellate Court of Maryland. They have four children between them and reside in Annapolis, Maryland. 
His son Ryan was also a baseball player, and was drafted by the Orioles in the 20th round of Major League Baseball&#x27;s 2012 amateur draft. He chose to attend college instead, beginning his first year at the University of South Carolina in 2012. He transferred to Indian River Community College and was drafted in the 15th round of the Major League Baseball&#x27;s 2014 amateur draft by the Washington Nationals. After being released by the Nationals in March 2017, he signed with the Orioles and was assigned to the Aberdeen Ironbirds, which were owned by his father, and played at a stadium that carries the family name. Ryan advanced as high as the AAA Norfolk Tides in 2021, but after going unsigned through the following offseason, he announced his retirement from professional baseball.

Ripken&#x27;s mother, Violet Ripken, was kidnapped at gunpoint and safely returned on July 24, 2012. She was gone for 12 hours before her disappearance was reported to authorities. On October 15, 2013, she was approached by a man with a handgun in a parking lot at the NBRS Bank in Aberdeen, Maryland. The man demanded her car, but he fled after she activated a key alarm. She was unharmed. A spokesman for the Aberdeen Police said the two incidents appeared unrelated.

In 2020, Ripken announced that he&#x27;d undergone successful treatment for prostate cancer.

Ripken has written or cowritten 17 books, and contributed forewards to numerous others. After the 1996 season, he released an autobiography titled &quot;The Only Way I Know&quot;, co-written with Mike Bryan, which was a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller. Following his retirement, he wrote several more, including &quot;Play Baseball the Ripken Way: The Complete Illustrated Guide to the Fundamentals&quot;, also written by his brother Billy and co-authored by Larry Burke, in 2005. He released the book &quot;Parenting Young Athletes the Ripken Way&quot;, co-written with Rick Wolff, in 2006 after seeing too many young athletes who he felt were being pressured unnecessarily by their parents. He said, &quot;I was thinking, &#x27;This just creates too much pressure on kids.&#x27; They need to find an environment in which they can explore their game ... without all these kinds of pressures being brought to bear. Once I started thinking about it, I saw we had more than enough to fill a book.&quot; Then in 2007, he released three books, starting with &quot;Coaching Youth Baseball the Ripken Way&quot;, also written by his brother Billy and co-authored by Scott Lowe, which highlights 50 practice drills, topics include coaching responsibly, goal setting for youth, and effective practice planning. Later, in April of that year, he released two more books: &quot;Get in the Game: 8 Elements of Perseverance That Make the Difference&quot;, co-written with Donald T. Phillips, described as a motivational guide to success; and &quot;The Longest Season&quot;, co-written with Ron Mazellan, a children&#x27;s book about the Orioles&#x27; 1988 season. In 2011, he released &quot;Hothead&quot;, a children&#x27;s fiction book co-written with Kevin Cowherd which was also a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. In addition, he has been writing a weekly youth sports advice newspaper column in the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; since 2005.

In addition to his writing, Ripken has been the subject of several books. In 1995, Harvey Rosenfeld released a biography on him entitled &quot;Iron Man: The Cal Ripken Jr., Story&quot;. Later, in 2007, Jeff Seidel released a biography on him entitled, &quot;Iron Man: Cal Ripken Jr., a Tribute&quot;. A children&#x27;s biography of Ripken, &quot;Cal Ripken Jr., Quiet Hero&quot; was published in 1993 by Lois Nicholson. In addition, Ripken has been the subject of scholarly publications analyzing the impact of his career.

===Business ventures===
Ripken owns several minor league baseball teams. In 2002, he purchased the Utica Blue Sox of the New York–Penn League and moved them to his hometown of Aberdeen, renaming them the Aberdeen IronBirds. The team is the High-A affiliate team in the Orioles&#x27; system and plays at Ripken Stadium. On June 28, 2005, he announced that he was purchasing the Augusta GreenJackets of the South Atlantic League, a Single-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants. At the end of the 2008 season, Ripken purchased the Vero Beach Devil Rays of the Single-A advanced Florida State League and moved them to Port Charlotte, Florida, where they were renamed the Charlotte Stone Crabs.

On January 10, 2007, Ripken expressed interest in purchasing the Baltimore Orioles if current owner Peter Angelos were to sell the team. He had yet to be approached as of 2013 about the potential purchase of the team. Though he had not purchased them, Ripken was quoted in a July 17, 2010, Associated Press article as saying he would consider rejoining the Orioles part-time as an advisor and full-time after his son graduated from high school in 2012. 

In October 2007, Ripken began working as a studio analyst for TBS Sports during the 2007 Major League Baseball playoffs. He continued to serve in the role .

Ripken was on the board of directors of ZeniMax Media until 2021. On February 28, 2008, Ripken announced his venture into the massively multiplayer online sports game market with &quot;Cal Ripken&#x27;s Real Baseball&quot;.

In 2013, Ripken sold the Augusta GreenJackets to Agon Sports &amp; Entertainment. In 2016, Ripken sold the Charlotte Stone Crabs to Caribbean Baseball Initiative headed by Lou Schwechheimer.

The Ripken Experience is a group of sports complexes. The first opened in Aberdeen, Maryland. A second location with nine baseball fields is located in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Opened in 2006, it cost $26 million with $7 million more spent since then. A third location was set to open in summer 2016 in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.

In January 2024, John P. Angelos reached a $1.725 billion deal to sell the Baltimore Orioles to a group led by David Rubenstein. The group included Ripken, Michael Bloomberg, former Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke, New York investment manager Michael Arougheti and NBA legend Grant Hill. It was not immediately clear how large Ripken&#x27;s stake will be or what sort of role he will have. By March 2024, Ripken agreed to serve as an advisor with the team.

<text>A skin-tight garment is a garment that is held to the skin usually by elastic tension using some type of stretch fabric. Commercial stretch fabrics (&#x27;elastomerics&#x27;) such as spandex or elastane (widely branded as &#x27;Lycra&#x27;) came onto the market in 1962, and revolutionized many areas of the clothing industry. A wide variety of clothing may be made to be skin-tight, and it is common for clothing to be skin-tight for some uses, such as in stockings, bodystockings, swimsuits and women&#x27;s bras.

==History and types==
===Leotard===
In 1886, the name leotard was given to a one-piece skin-tight garment that covers the torso including the crotch, but not the legs or arms. The garment was named after French acrobatic performer Jules Léotard (1838–1870), many years after his death, who wore the garment in his acrobatic act. In the early 20th century, use of leotards was mainly confined to circus and acrobatic shows, but were also worn by professional dancers, such as the showgirls of Broadway. Leotards on the stage were typically worn with stockings or tights.

In the 1950s, traditionally-styled leotards continued to be worn mainly by stage performers and circus actors, but leotards began to be used as simple and functional exercise garments, often in institutional settings like schools and in fitness training. These were almost always black and worn together with thick tights. Between 1950 and 1970, leotards remained as such in appearance until a style change in the 1970s, when more colorful leotards appeared on the scene, most often in ballet and exercise.

===Swimwear===
The 1920s and 1930s saw leotards influencing swimsuit styles, with women&#x27;s one-piece swimsuits today still being similar in appearance to leotards. The most common type of one-piece swimsuit is the maillot or tank suit, which resembles a sleeveless leotard or bodysuit. In early years the one-piece swimsuit would have a narrow skirt slip or micro-shorts, for modesty considerations, but these were beginning to disappear in the 1940s. A recent innovation in one-piece swimsuits is the bodyskin, which superficially resembles a unitard or wetsuit. Although these cover the entire torso, arms and legs, their function is not modesty, but reducing friction through the water for professional swimmers.

===Bodystocking===
A bodystocking is a one-piece skin-tight garment that covers the torso, legs and sometimes the arms of the wearer. It is a foundation garment or an article of lingerie usually made from a sheer fabric similar to that used for stockings or pantyhose, or from fishnet, lace or an opaque material, or a variation of these materials. A bodystocking differs from a unitard, which is worn as an outfit or article of clothing, and a leotard, which is used as a practice garment or performance costume by acrobats, gymnasts and other similar performers. Designed to be revealed, but not to be too revealing, bodystockings may be worn as undergarments by performers such as belly dancers and exotic dancers.

Bodystockings were used on stage in at least 1860s. In 1861, American actress Adah Isaacs Menken controversially wore a flesh coloured bodystocking on stage, to preserve her modesty and stay within the obscenity laws, while giving the illusion of nudity.

===Unitard===
A unitard is a type of garment that combines the features of a leotard with those of tights, covering the legs and sometimes extending to the arms. It is essentially a one-piece outfit that is both a leotard and a legging, often resembling a bodystocking but designed to be worn as outerwear for everyday use.

===Bodysuit===
A bodysuit covers the torso, crotch, and sometimes the legs, hands, and feet. The style of a basic bodysuit is similar to a one-piece swimsuit and a leotard, though the materials may vary, and a bodysuit, unlike a swimsuit or leotard, has snaps, hooks or velcro at the crotch. A bodysuit may have sleeves and varying shoulder strap and collar styles. Bodysuits can be made from a number of fabrics, including cotton, lace, nylon, etc. In general, textile bodysuits include expandable fiber such as spandex for a better fit to the shape of the body.

A bodysuit is normally worn with trousers or a skirt, exposing at most the top of the garment above the waist. The top, torso part may act as a top for the smooth line it gives or because it cannot become untucked from trousers or skirt. They may also be worn generally by women as underwear, activewear, or foundation garments. Unlike a leotard, a bodysuit is not usually considered a form of athletic wear. The purpose of the opening at the crotch is to facilitate access during a visit to the toilet.

===Stocking and pantyhose===
Modern stockings became popular in the 1920s with the rise in women&#x27;s hemlines. They were sheer, first made of silk or rayon (then known as &quot;artificial silk&quot;), and after 1940 of nylon. Nylon stockings were cheap, durable, and sheer compared to their cotton and silk counterparts. These stocking were very popular, and the demand for them has continued, though it has given ground to tights or pantyhose. During the 1960s, improved textile manufacturing processes made pantyhose cheaper, while spandex (or elastane) made them more comfortable and durable, and the miniskirt made the pantyhose a necessity to many women. The popularity of pantyhose grew into a wardrobe staple throughout the 1970s and 1980s. From 1995 there was a steady decline in sales of pantyhose, levelling off in 2006 with American sales less than half of what they had once been.

===Sportswear===
The development and use of stretch fabrics simplified the construction of clothing. First used in swimsuits and women&#x27;s bras, fashion designers began using them as early as the mid-1980s. They entered the mainstream market in the early 1990s, and are now widely used in sports clothing.

In various athletic and performance contexts, skin-tight garments, also known as skin suits, offer a range of benefits, including injury protection and prevention of scrapes, while also providing enhanced muscle support and reduced muscle vibration. These garments also help to minimize wind and friction drag, making them ideal for activities such as swimming, cycling, skating, skiing, and running. Moreover, they offer protection from cuts, stings, and abrasions, as well as safeguarding against the harmful effects of UV radiation from the sun. This type of clothing is a key component of many athletic ensembles, providing a comprehensive solution for athletes seeking to optimize their performance and safety.

==Other uses==
It is possible that military personnel have incorporated skintight clothing into their uniforms, as suggested by a North Korean soldier who was spotted wearing a skintight blue suit during a military exhibition. However, the purpose of this attire remains unclear.

Skin-tight garments also intersect with the realm of fetishism; certain types of fetishized clothing, such as latex and spandex suits, are designed to be extremely skintight. For individuals with a rubber or spandex fetish, these garments hold a strong sexual appeal, which may be attributed to the sensation they create on the skin, making it feel more sensitive, while also providing a sense of being naked yet clothed.

In a more practical application, skin-tight spacesuits serve a crucial purpose for astronauts by helping to maintain the shape of their spines. The equal pressure exerted by the suit on the skin&#x27;s surface provides support to the muscles, which is essential for astronauts who spend extended periods in space.

<doc id="153859" wikidata="Q90685" url="?curid=153859" title="Palisade">
<text>A palisade, sometimes called a stakewall or a paling, is typically a row of closely placed, high vertical standing tree trunks or wooden or iron stakes used as a fence for enclosure or as a defensive wall. Palisades can form a stockade.

==Etymology==
&quot;Palisade&quot; derives from &quot;pale&quot;, from the Latin word &quot;&quot;, meaning stake, specifically when used side by side to create a wood defensive wall. (see , English: Etymology 2 on Wiktionary).

== Typical construction ==
Typical construction consisted of small or mid-sized tree trunks aligned vertically, with as little free space in between as possible. The trunks were sharpened or pointed at the top, and were driven into the ground and sometimes reinforced with additional construction. The height of a palisade ranged from around a metre to as high as 3–4 m. As a defensive structure, palisades were often used in conjunction with earthworks.

Palisades were an excellent option for small forts or other hastily constructed fortifications. Since they were made of wood, they could often be quickly and easily built from readily available materials. They proved to be effective protection for short-term conflicts and were an effective deterrent against small forces. However, because they were wooden constructions they were also vulnerable to fire and siege weapons.

Often, a palisade would be constructed around a castle as a temporary wall until a permanent stone wall could be erected.

==Ancient Greece and Rome==
Both the Greeks and Romans created palisades to protect their military camps. The Roman historian Livy describes the Greek method as being inferior to that of the Romans during the Second Macedonian War. The Greek stakes were too large to be easily carried and were spaced too far apart. This made it easy for enemies to uproot them and create a large enough gap in which to enter. In contrast, the Romans used smaller and easier to carry stakes which were placed closer together, making them more difficult to uproot.

== Precolumbian North America ==
The Iroquoian peoples, who coalesced as tribes around the Great Lakes, often defended their settlements with palisades. Within the palisades the peoples lived in communal groups in numerous longhouses, sometimes in communities as large as 2,000 people. Archeological evidence of such palisades has been found at numerous 15th and 16th-century sites in both Ontario, Canada, and in New York, United States.

Many settlements of the native Mississippian culture of the Midwestern United States used palisades. A prominent example is the Cahokia Mounds site in Collinsville, Illinois. A wooden stockade with a series of watchtowers or bastions at regular intervals formed a enclosure around Monk&#x27;s Mound and the Grand Plaza. Archaeologists found evidence of the stockade during excavation of the area and indications that it was rebuilt several times, in slightly different locations. The stockade seems to have separated Cahokia&#x27;s main ceremonial precinct from other parts of the city, as well as being a defensive structure.
Other examples include the Angel Mounds site in southern Indiana, Aztalan State Park in Wisconsin, the Kincaid site in Illinois, the Parkin site and the Nodena sites in northeastern Arkansas, and the Etowah site in Georgia.

==Colonial America==
Palisaded settlements were common in Colonial North America, for protection against indigenous peoples and wild animals. The English settlements in Jamestown, Virginia (1607), Cupids, Newfoundland (1610) and Plymouth, Massachusetts (1620) were all originally fortifications that were surrounded by palisades.

Such defensive palisades were also frequently used in New France. In addition, colonial architecture used vertical palings as the walls of houses, in what was called &quot;poteaux en terre&quot; construction. Some 18th-century houses in this style survive in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, initially settled by French colonists from the Illinois Country to the east of the Mississippi River.

== Ottoman Empire ==
A &quot;palanka&quot; was a type of wooden fort constructed of palisades, built by the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans during the 16th and 17th centuries. They could be erected for a variety of reasons such as protecting a strategically valuable area or a town Some palankas evolved into larger settlements.

==Half-timber palisade construction==
In the late nineteenth century, when milled lumber was not available or practical, many Adirondack buildings were built using a palisade architecture. The walls were made of vertical half timbers; the outside, rounded half with its bark still on faced Adirondack weather, while the inside half was sanded and varnished for a finished wood look. Typically, the cracks between the vertical logs were filled with moss and sometimes covered with small sticks. Inside, the cracks were covered with narrow wooden battens. This palisade style was much more efficient to build than the traditional horizontal log cabin, since two half logs provided more surface area than one whole log and the vertical alignment meant a stronger structure for supporting loads like upper stories and roofs. It also presented a more finished look inside. Examples of this architectural style can still be found in the Adirondacks, such as around Big Moose Lake.

== Modern uses ==
In areas with extremely high rates of violent crime and property theft, a common means to prevent crime is for residential houses to be protected by perimeter defenses such as ornamental iron bars, brick walls, steel palisade fences, wooden palisade fences and electrified palisade fences (railings). The City of Johannesburg promotes the use of palisade fencing over opaque, usually brick, walls, as criminals cannot hide as easily behind the fence. Its manual on safety includes guidance, such as avoiding having vegetation alongside the fence, as this allows criminals to make an unseen breach.

<text>A moat is a deep, broad ditch dug around a castle, fortification, building, or town, historically to provide it with a preliminary line of defence. Moats can be dry or filled with water. In some places, moats evolved into more extensive water defences, including natural or artificial lakes, dams and sluices. In older fortifications, such as hillforts, they are usually referred to simply as ditches, although the function is similar. In later periods, moats or water defences may be largely ornamental. They could also act as a sewer.

==Historical use==

===Ancient===
Some of the earliest evidence of moats has been uncovered around ancient Egyptian fortresses. One example is at Buhen, a settlement excavated in Nubia. Other evidence of ancient moats is found in the ruins of Babylon, and in reliefs from ancient Egypt, Assyria, and other cultures in the region.

Evidence of early moats around settlements has been discovered in many archaeological sites throughout Southeast Asia, including Noen U-Loke, Ban Non Khrua Chut, Ban Makham Thae and Ban Non Wat. The use of the moats could have been either for defensive or agriculture purposes.

===Medieval===
Moats were excavated around castles and other fortifications as part of the defensive system as an obstacle immediately outside the walls. In suitable locations, they might be filled with water. A moat made access to the walls difficult for siege weapons such as siege towers and battering rams, which needed to be brought up against a wall to be effective. A water-filled moat made the practice of mining – digging tunnels under the castles in order to effect a collapse of the defences – very difficult as well. &quot;Segmented moats&quot; have one dry section and one section filled with water. Dry moats that cut across the narrow part of a spur or peninsula are called &quot;neck ditches&quot;. Moats separating different elements of a castle, such as the inner and outer wards, are &quot;cross ditches&quot;.

The word was adapted in Middle English from the Old French () and was first applied to the central mound on which a castle was erected (see Motte and bailey) and then came to be applied to the excavated ring, a &#x27;dry moat&#x27;. The shared derivation implies that the two features were closely related and possibly constructed at the same time. The term &quot;moat&quot; is also applied to natural formations reminiscent of the artificial structure and to similar modern architectural features.

===Later western fortification===
With the introduction of siege artillery, a new style of fortification emerged in the 16th century using low walls and projecting strong points called bastions, which was known as the &quot;trace italienne&quot;. The walls were further protected from infantry attack by wet or dry moats, sometimes in elaborate systems. When this style of fortification was superseded by lines of polygonal forts in the mid-19th century, moats continued to be used for close protection.

===Africa===
The Walls of Benin were a combination of ramparts and moats, called Iya, used as a defence of the capital Benin City in present-day Edo State of Nigeria. It was considered the largest man-made structure lengthwise, second only to the Great Wall of China and the largest earthwork in the world. Recent work by Patrick Darling has established it as the largest man-made structure in the world, larger than Sungbo&#x27;s Eredo, also in Nigeria. It enclosed of community lands. Its length was over of earth boundaries. It was estimated that earliest construction began in 800 and continued into the mid-15th century.

The walls are built of a ditch and dike structure, the ditch dug to form an inner moat with the excavated earth used to form the exterior rampart.

The Benin Walls were ravaged by the British in 1897. Scattered pieces of the walls remain in Edo, with material being used by the locals for building purposes. The walls continue to be torn down for real-estate developments.

The Walls of Benin City were the world&#x27;s largest man-made structure. Fred Pearce wrote in &quot;New Scientist&quot;:They extend for some 16,000 kilometres in all, in a mosaic of more than 500 interconnected settlement boundaries. They cover 6,500 square kilometres and were all dug by the Edo people. In all, they are four times longer than the Great Wall of China, and consumed a hundred times more material than the Great Pyramid of Cheops. They took an estimated 150 million hours of digging to construct, and are perhaps the largest single archaeological phenomenon on the planet.

===Asia===
Japanese castles often have very elaborate moats, with up to three moats laid out in concentric circles around the castle and a host of different patterns engineered around the landscape. The outer moat of a Japanese castle typically protects other support buildings in addition to the castle.

As many Japanese castles have historically been a very central part of their cities, the moats have provided a vital waterway to the city. Even in modern times the moat system of the Tokyo Imperial Palace consists of a very active body of water, hosting everything from rental boats and fishing ponds to restaurants.

Most modern Japanese castles have moats filled with water, but castles in the feudal period more commonly had &#x27;dry moats&#x27; , a trench. A is a dry moat dug into a slope. A is a series of parallel trenches running up the sides of the excavated mountain, and the earthen wall, which was also called , was an outer wall made of earth dug out from a moat. Even today it is common for mountain Japanese castles to have dry moats. A is a moat filled with water.

Moats were also used in the Forbidden City and Xi&#x27;an in China; in Vellore Fort in India; Hsinchu in Taiwan; and in Southeast Asia, such as at Angkor Wat in Cambodia; Mandalay in Myanmar; Chiang Mai in Thailand and Huế in Vietnam.

===Australia===
The only moated fort ever built in Australia was Fort Lytton in Brisbane. As Brisbane was much more vulnerable to attack than either Sydney or Melbourne a series of coastal defences was built throughout Moreton Bay, Fort Lytton being the largest. 
Built between 1880 and 1881 in response to fear of a Russian invasion, it is a pentagonal fortress concealed behind grassy embankments and surrounded by a water-filled moat.

===North America===

Moats were developed independently by North American indigenous people of the Mississippian culture as the outer defence of some fortified villages. The remains of a 16th-century moat are still visible at the Parkin Archeological State Park in eastern Arkansas.

The Maya people also used moats, for example in the city of Becan.

European colonists in the Americas often built dry ditches surrounding forts built to protect important landmarks, harbours or cities (e.g. Fort Jay on Governors Island in New York Harbor).

==Modern usage==
=== Architectural usage ===

Dry moats were a key element used in French Classicism and Beaux-Arts architecture dwellings, both as decorative designs and to provide discreet access for service. Excellent examples of these can be found in Newport, Rhode Island at Miramar (mansion) and The Elms, as well as at Carolands, outside of San Francisco, California, and at Union Station in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Additionally, a dry moat can allow light and fresh air to reach basement workspaces, as for example at the James Farley Post Office in New York City.

=== Anti-terrorist moats ===
Whilst moats are no longer a significant tool of warfare, modern architectural building design continues to use them as a defence against certain modern threats, such as terrorist attacks from car bombs and improvised fighting vehicles. For example, the new location of the Embassy of the United States in London, opened in 2018, includes a moat among its security features - the first moat built in England for more than a century. Modern moats may also be used for aesthetic or ergonomic purposes.

The Catawba Nuclear Station has a concrete moat around the sides of the plant not bordering a lake. The moat is a part of precautions added to such sites after the September 11, 2001 attacks.

=== Safety moats ===
Moats, rather than fences, separate animals from spectators in many modern zoo installations. Moats were first used in this way by Carl Hagenbeck at his Tierpark in Hamburg, Germany. The structure, with a vertical outer retaining wall rising direct from the moat, is an extended usage of the ha-ha of English landscape gardening.

=== Border defence moats ===
In 2004, plans were suggested for a two-mile moat across the southern border of the Gaza Strip to prevent tunnelling from Egyptian territory to the border town of Rafah.

In 2008, city officials in Yuma, Arizona planned to dig out a two-mile stretch of a wetland known as Hunters Hole to control immigrants coming from Mexico.

=== Pest control moats ===
Researchers of jumping spiders, which have excellent vision and adaptable tactics, built water-filled miniature moats, too wide for the spiders to jump across. Some specimens were rewarded for jumping then swimming and others for swimming only. &quot;Portia fimbriata&quot; from Queensland generally succeeded, for whichever method they were rewarded. When specimens from two different populations of &quot;Portia labiata&quot; were set the same task, members of one population determined which method earned them a reward, whilst members of the other continued to use whichever method they tried first and did not try to adapt.

As a basic method of pest control in bonsai, a moat may be used to restrict access of crawling insects to the bonsai.

<text>A sled, skid, sledge, or sleigh is a land vehicle that slides across a surface, usually of ice or snow. It is built with either a smooth underside or a separate body supported by two or more smooth, relatively narrow, longitudinal runners similar in principle to skis. This reduces the amount of friction, which helps to carry heavy loads.

Some designs are used to transport passengers or cargo across relatively level ground. Others are designed to go downhill for recreation, particularly by children, or competition (compare cross-country skiing with its downhill cousin). Shades of meaning differentiating the three terms often reflect regional variations depending on historical uses and prevailing climate.

In British English, &quot;sledge&quot; is the general term, and more common than &quot;sled&quot;. &quot;Toboggan&quot; is sometimes used synonymously with &quot;sledge&quot; but more often to refer to a particular type of sledge without runners. &quot;Sleigh&quot; refers to a moderate to large-sized, usually open-topped vehicle to carry passengers or goods, and typically drawn by horses, dogs, or reindeer.
In American usage &quot;sled&quot; remains the general term but often implies a smaller device, often for recreational use. &quot;Sledge&quot; implies a heavier sled used for moving freight or massive objects. &quot;Sleigh&quot; refers more specifically than in Britain to a vehicle which is essentially a cold-season alternative to a carriage or wagon and has seating for passengers; what can be called a dog-sleigh in Britain is known only as a dog-sled in North America.

In Australia, where there is limited snow, &quot;sleigh&quot; and &quot;sledge&quot; are given equal preference in local parlance.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;sled&quot; comes from Middle English , which itself has the origins in Middle Dutch word &quot;&quot;, meaning &#x27;sliding&#x27; or &#x27;slider&#x27;. The same word shares common ancestry with both &quot;sleigh&quot; and &quot;sledge&quot;. The word &quot;sleigh&quot;, on the other hand, is an anglicized form of the modern Dutch word and was introduced to the English language by Dutch immigrants to North America.

==Operation==

Sleds are especially useful in winter but can also be drawn over wet fields, muddy roads, and even hard ground if one helps them along by greasing the blades (&quot;grease the skids&quot;) with oil or alternatively wetting them with water. For an explanation of why sleds and other objects glide with various degrees of friction ranging from very little to fairly little friction on ice, icy snow, wet snow, and dry snow, see the relevant sections in the articles on ice and ice skating. The traditional explanation of the pressure of sleds on the snow or ice producing a thin film of water and this enabling sleds to move on ice with little friction is insufficient. 

Various types of sleds are pulled by animals such as reindeer, horses, mules, oxen, or dogs.

==History==


The people of Ancient Egypt are thought to have used sledges (aka &quot;skids&quot;) extensively in the construction of their public works, in particular for the transportation of heavy obelisks over sand.

Sleds and sledges were found in the Oseberg &quot;Viking&quot; ship excavation. The sledge was also highly prized, because – unlike wheeled vehicles – it was exempt from tolls.

Until the late 19th century, a closed winter sled, or &quot;vozok&quot;, provided a high-speed means of transport through the snow-covered plains of European Russia and Siberia. It was a means of transport preferred by royals, bishops, and boyars of Muscovy. Several royal &quot;vozoks&quot; of historical importance have been preserved in the Kremlin Armoury.

Man-hauled sledges were the traditional means of transport on British exploring expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic regions in the 19th and early 20th centuries, championed for example by Captain Scott. Dog sleds were used by most others, such as Roald Amundsen.

In the Philippines, a traditional carabao-drawn sled is known as the &quot;kangga&quot;. It is still used in place of wheeled carts over rough or muddy terrain, while also having the advantage of traveling over rice paddy dikes without destroying them.

==Modern sleds==
===Transport===
Some of these originally used draft animals but are now more likely to be pulled by an engine (snowmobile or tractor). Some use human power.
* The word &quot;motor sled&quot; is colloquial term for a snowmobile 
* The Inuit &quot;qamutiik&quot; is uniquely adapted for travel on the sea ice.
* The &quot;pulk&quot; (or &quot;ahkio&quot;) is a traditional sled of the Lapland region, used for expeditions, mountain rescue, and cold weather military units to haul equipment, supplies, and passengers.
* Rescue toboggan, developed from the &quot;pulk&quot; 
* Stone boat, a farm vehicle used for moving heavy objects such as stones or haybales; can be towed by a tractor.
Today some people use kites to tow exploration sleds.

===Recreation===

There are several types of recreational sleds designed for sliding down snowy hills (sledding):

* Toboggan, an elongated sled without runners, usually made from wood or plastic, but sometimes made from sheet metal.
* Saucer, a round sled curved like a saucer (see also flying saucer), also without runners and usually made out of plastic or metal
* Flexible Flyer, a steerable wooden sled with thin metal runners
* Kicksled or spark, a human-powered sled
* Inflatable sled or tube, a plastic membrane filled with air to make a very lightweight sled, like an inner tube
* Foam slider, a flat piece of durable foam with handles and a smooth underside
* Backcountry sled, a deep, steerable plastic sled to kneel on with pads and a seat belt
* Airboard, a snow bodyboard, i.e. an inflatable single-person sled

===Competition===

A few types of sleds are used only for a specific sport:

* Bobsled (British: bobsleigh), an aerodynamic composite-bodied vehicle on lightweight runners
* Luge and the skeleton, tiny one or two-person sleds with runners

===Other===
* A cutter is an open, lightweight, horse-drawn sleigh that usually holds no more than two people. It was developed in the United States around 1800. Historic styles were often quite decorative. About 1920, cutter racing began in the American Rocky Mountain west, first using a simple homemade chariot on skis, later replaced by a bicycle-wheeled chariot that was also pulled over snow.
*Troika, a traditional Russian vehicle drawn by three horses, usually a sled, but it may also be a wheeled carriage.
* A sled or &quot;stone boat&quot;, seen in truck and tractor pulling and horse pulling. A flat sled able to carry increasing amounts of weight to determine the maximum load the animal or machine can pull.

==See also==
* Snowboard
* Luge
* Travois, a frame used to drag loads over land, i.e. another horse-drawn transport method without wheels

<text>JVC (short for Japan Victor Company) is a Japanese brand owned by JVCKenwood. Founded in 1927 as the Victor Talking Machine Company of Japan and later as , the company was best known for introducing Japan&#x27;s first televisions and for developing the Video Home System (VHS) video recorder.

From 1953 to 2008, the Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. was the majority stockholder in JVC. In 2008, JVC merged with Kenwood Corporation to create JVCKenwood. JVC sold their electronic products in their home market of Japan under the &quot;Victor&quot; name with the His Master&#x27;s Voice logo. However, the company used the name JVC or Nivico in the past for export; this was due to differing ownership of the His Master&#x27;s Voice logo and the ownership of the &quot;Victor&quot; name from successors of the Victor Talking Machine Company. In 2011, the Victor brand for electronics in Japan was replaced by the global JVC brand. However, the previous &quot;Victor&quot; name and logo are retained by JVCKenwood Victor Entertainment, and are used as JVCKenwood&#x27;s luxury HiFi marque.

==History==

===1927 creation to World War II===
JVC was founded in 1927 as the Victor Talking Machine Company of Japan, Limited, a subsidiary of the United States&#x27; leading phonograph and record company, the Victor Talking Machine Company of Camden, New Jersey. In 1929, the Radio Corporation of America purchased Victor and its foreign subsidiaries, including the Japan operations. In the late 1920s, JVC produced only phonographs and records; following the acquisition by RCA, JVC began producing radios, and in 1939, Japan&#x27;s first locally-made television. In 1943, amidst the hostilities between the United States and Japan during World War II, JVC seceded from RCA Victor, retaining the &#x27;Victor&#x27; and &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot; trademarks for use in Japan only. After the war, JVC resumed distribution of RCA Victor recordings in Japan until RCA established its separate distribution in Japan during the late 1960s. Today, the record company in Japan is known as Victor Entertainment.

===Post-war===

In 1953, JVC became majority-owned by the Panasonic Corporation. Panasonic released its ownership in 2007.

In the 1960s, JVC established the Nivico (Nippon Victor Corporation) brand for Delmonico&#x27;s line of console televisions and stereos.

In 1970, JVC marketed the Videosphere, a portable cathode-ray tube (CRT) television inside a space-helmet-shaped casing with an alarm clock at the base. It was a commercial success.

In 1971, JVC introduced the first discrete system for four channel quadraphonic sound on vinyl records - CD-4 (Compatible Discrete Four Channel) or Quadradisc, as it was called by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) in the United States.

In 1973, the JVC Cutting Center opened (in the USA) to provide mastering for CD-4 discs. The Mark II 1/2 speed system was used until mid-1975 when it was replaced with the Mark III 1/2 speed system. In 1978, Mobile Fidelity began using the JVC Cutting Center to 1/2 speed master Stereo/Mono discs.

In 1975, JVC introduced the first combined portable battery-operated radio with inbuilt TV, as the model 3050. The TV was a black-and-white CRT. One year later, JVC expanded the model to add a cassette recorder, as the 3060, creating the world&#x27;s first boombox with radio, cassette and TV.

In 1976, the first VCR to use VHS was the Victor HR-3300, and was introduced by the president of JVC at the Okura Hotel in Tokyo on September 9, 1976. JVC started selling the HR-3300 in Akihabara, Tokyo, Japan on October 31, 1976. Region-specific versions of the JVC HR-3300 were also distributed later on, such as the HR-3300U in the United States, and HR-3300EK in the United Kingdom.

===1970s, 1980s and the VHS/Betamax format war===
In the late 1970s, JVC developed the VHS format, introducing the first VHS recorders to the consumer market in 1976 for the equivalent of US$1,060. Sony, which had introduced the Betamax home videocassette tape a year earlier, became the main competitor for JVC&#x27;s VHS format into the 1980s, creating the videotape format war. The Betamax cassette was smaller, with slightly superior picture quality to the VHS cassette, but this resulted in Betamax having less recording time. The two companies competed fiercely to encourage others to adopt their format, but by 1984 forty companies were using JVC&#x27;s VHS format, while only 12 used Betamax. Sony began producing VHS recorders in 1988. However, Sony stopped making Betamax recorders for the US market in 1993; they stopped production of the format completely in 2002. One reason for the market penetration of VHS in the UK were the sales of blank tapes by JVC UK Ltd to major Hollywood studios. This launched the nascent home video rental market, which was hardly touched by Sony at the time. This ability to take movies home helped the sale of the VHS hardware immensely. Added to this JVC stated in a promotional tape presented by BBC TV legend Cliff Michelmore, that &quot;You&#x27;ll be able to buy the sort of films the BBC and ITV will never show you, for whatever reason&quot;. The adult movie industry adopted VHS as their common format and with a certain level of software availability, hardware sales grew.

===Other notable achievements===
In 1979, JVC demonstrated a prototype of its video high density (VHD) disc system. This system was capacitance-based, like capacitance electronic disc (CED), but the discs were grooveless with the stylus being guided by servo signals in the disc surface. The VHD discs were initially handled by the operator and played on a machine that looked like an audio LP turntable, but JVC used caddy-housed discs when the system was marketed. Development suffered numerous delays, and the product was launched in 1983 in Japan, followed by the United Kingdom in 1984, to a limited industrial market.

In 1981, JVC introduced a line of revolutionary direct-drive cassette decks, topped by the DD-9, that provided previously unattainable levels of speed stability.

During the 1980s JVC briefly marketed its portable audio equipment similar to the Sony Walkman on the market at the time. The JVC CQ-F2K was released in 1982 and had a detachable radio mounted to the headphones for a compact, wire-free listening experience. JVC had difficulty making the products successful, and a few years later stopped making them. In Japan, JVC marketed the products under the name &quot;Victor&quot;.

In 1986, JVC released the HC-95, a personal computer with a 3.58 MHz Zilog Z80A processor, 64 KB RAM, running on MSX Basic 2.0. It included two 3.5&quot; floppy disk drives and conformed to the graphics specification of the MSX-2 standard. However, like the Pioneer PX-7, it also carried a sophisticated hardware interface that handled video superimposition and various interactive video processing features. The JVC HC-95 was first sold in Japan, and then Europe, but sales were disappointing.

JVC video recorders were marketed by the Ferguson Radio Corporation in the UK, with just cosmetic changes. However, Ferguson needed to find another supplier for its camcorders when JVC produced only the VHS-C format, rather than video8. Ferguson was later acquired by Thomson SA, which ended the relationship. JVC later invented hard drive camcorders.

===21st century===

In October 2001, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences presented JVC an Emmy Award for &quot;outstanding achievement in technological advancement&quot; for &quot;Pioneering Development of Consumer Camcorders&quot;. Annual sponsorships of the world-renowned JVC Tokyo Video Festival and the JVC Jazz Festival have helped attract the attention of more customers.

JVC has been a worldwide football (soccer) supporter since 1982, having a former kit sponsorship with Arsenal and continuing its role as an official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup Korea/Japan. JVC made headlines as the first-ever corporate partner of the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. JVC has recently forged corporate partnerships with ESPN Zone and Foxploration. In 2005, JVC joined HANA, the High-Definition Audio-Video Network Alliance, to help establish standards in consumer-electronics interoperability.

In 2005, JVC announced their development of the first DVD-RW DL media (the dual-layer version of the rewritable DVD-RW format).

In December 2006, Matsushita entered talks with Kenwood and Cerberus Capital Management to sell its stake in JVC. 
In 2007, Victor Company of Japan Ltd confirmed a strategic capital alliance with Kenwood and SPARKX Investment, resulting in Matsushita&#x27;s holding being reduced to approximately 37%.
In March 2008, Matsushita (Panasonic) agreed to spin off the company and merge it with Kenwood Electronics, creating JVCKenwood Holdings on October 1, 2008.

In April 2008, JVC announced that it was closing its TV plants in East Kilbride (Scotland) and Japan. This left it with one plant in Thailand. It stated it would outsource European production to an OEM.

JVC TVs for North America are now being manufactured by AmTRAN Video Corporation along with distribution, service, and warranty under license from JVCKenwood. In Europe, Currys plc, owner of Currys, has a similar arrangement with JVCKenwood.

In Europe, JVC sells mainly some audio accessories, like headphones, and until recently DIN-type car audio. Also in Europe, JVC is present with camcorders, security cameras, audio systems, and with their emblematic boom box, projectors. JVC TV sets in Europe are manufactured mainly by Turkish manufacturer Vestel but are unavailable in all countries.

JVC manufactures car audio head units and speakers for the aftermarket car audio market.

==Sponsorship==
JVC is a well-known brand among English football fans due to the firm&#x27;s sponsorship of Arsenal from 1981 to 1999, when Sega took over as Arsenal&#x27;s sponsors. JVC&#x27;s 18-year association with Arsenal is one of the longest club-sponsor associations with any professional football club. JVC also sponsored Scottish football club Aberdeen in the late-1980s and early-1990s as well as the FIFA World Cup from 1982 to 2002.

JVC also sponsors the &quot;away&quot; shirts of the Australian A-League club, Sydney FC, and Dutch race driver Christijan Albers.

JVC has also been a sponsor of a massively multiplayer online game called &quot;&quot; since 2003.

==Brand name==


JVC is generally known within Japan by the Victor brand, preceded by the His Master&#x27;s Voice logo featuring the dog Nipper. Because of a conflict in trademarks between HMV, RCA, and Victor, HMV and RCA are not allowed to use Nipper in Japan. At one time, the company used the Nivico name (for &quot;Nippon Victor Company&quot;) overseas, before rebranding to JVC, which stands for Japan&#x27;s Victor Company. Therefore, the Victor and JVC-Victor web sites looked quite different. Conversely, the entertainment retailer HMV cannot use the His Master&#x27;s Voice motto or logo in Japan; its logo is a stylized image of a gramophone only. After the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), purchased the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1929 and became RCA Victor in Japan, RCA also had acquired the use of Nipper and His Master&#x27;s Voice logo, but for use in the Western Hemisphere. In 2011, JVC decided to phase out the &quot;Victor&quot; brand for electronics in Japan, but retained its use for its premium audio products, recording studios Victor Studio, and record label JVCKenwood Victor Entertainment.

<text>&lt;noinclude&gt;
Pajamas (or pyjamas in Commonwealth English, ( )) are several related types of clothing worn as nightwear or while lounging. Pajamas are soft garments derived from the South-Asian Muslim bottom-wear, the &quot;pyjamas&quot;, which were adopted in the Western world as nightwear.

The garments are sometimes colloquially referred to as PJs, jammies, jim-jams or in South Asia, night suits.

==Etymology==

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the word pajama is a borrowing via Urdu from Persian. Its etymology is: Urdu pāy-jāma, pā-jāma and its etymon Persian pāy-jāma, pā-jāma, singular noun &lt; Persian pāy, pā foot, leg + jāma clothing, garment (see jama n.1) + English -s, plural ending, after drawers.

==History== 

The worldwide use of pajamas (the word and the clothing) outside the Indian subcontinent is the result of adoption by British colonists in the Indian subcontinent in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the British influence on the wider Western world during the Victorian era.
Pajamas had been introduced to England as &quot;lounging attire&quot; as early as the seventeenth century, then known as &quot;mogul&#x27;s breeches&quot; (Beaumont and Fletcher) but they soon fell out of fashion. The word &quot;pajama&quot; (as &quot; pai jamahs,&quot; &quot;Paee-jams&quot; and variants) is recorded in English use in the first half of the nineteenth century. They did not become a fashion in Britain and the Western world as sleeping attire for men until the Victorian period, from about 1870.

&quot;Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases&quot; (1886) summarizes the state of usage at the time (s.v. &quot;pyjammas&quot;):
Such a garment is used by various persons in India &quot;e.g.&quot; by women of various classes, by Sikh men, and most by Mohammedans of both sexes. It was adopted from the Mohammedans by Europeans as an article of &quot;dishabille&quot; [highly casual clothing] and of night attire, and is synonymous with Long Drawers, Shulwaurs, and Mogul-Breeches [...] It is probable that we English took the habit like a good many others from the Portuguese. Thus Pyrard (c. 1521) says, in speaking of Goa Hospital: &quot;&quot;Ils ont force &quot;caleçon&quot; sans quoy ne couchent iamais les Portugais des Indes&quot;&quot; [fr., &quot;They have plenty of the undergarments without which the Portuguese in India never sleep&quot;] [...] The word is now used in London shops. A friend furnishes the following reminiscence: &quot;The late Mr. B—, tailor in Jermyn Street, some on 12 years ago, in reply to a question why pyjammas had feet sewn on to them (as was sometimes the case with those furnished by London outfitters) answered: &quot;I believe, Sir, it is because of the White Ants.&quot;

==Types==

===Traditional===

&quot;Traditional pajamas&quot; consist of a shirt-and-trousers combination made of soft fabric, such as flannel or lightweight silk. The shirt element usually has a placket front and sleeves with no cuffs.

Pajamas are usually worn as nightwear with bare feet and without undergarments. They are often worn for comfort by people in their homes, especially by children, especially on the weekend.

===Contemporary===

Contemporary pajamas are derived from traditional pajamas. There are many variations in style such as short sleeve pajamas, pajama bottoms of varying length, and pajamas incorporating various non-traditional materials. Often, people of both sexes opt to sleep or lounge in just pajama pants, usually with a t-shirt. For this reason, pajama pants are often sold as separates. Stretch-knit sleep apparel with rib-knit trimmings are common, mostly with young children.

Although pajamas are usually distinguished from one-piece sleeping garments such as nightgowns, in the US, they have sometimes included the latter or a somewhat shorter nightshirt as a top. Some pajamas, especially those designed for infants and toddlers, feature a &quot;drop seat&quot; (also known as a &quot;trap door&quot; or &quot;butt flap&quot;): a buttoned opening in the seat, designed to allow the wearer conveniently to use a toilet.

== Fire safety ==
In the United States, pajamas for children are required to comply with fire safety regulations. If made of flammable fabric, such as cotton, they must be tight fitting. Loose-fitting pajamas must be treated with a fire retardant. Regulations in the United Kingdom are less stringent; pajamas which do not comply with fire safety standards may be sold, but must be labelled &quot;KEEP AWAY FROM FIRE&quot;.

==Society and culture==

Pajamas in the Western world have been regarded as essentially indoors wear, or wear for the home, whether treated as daywear or nightwear.

When Bette Davis wore her husband&#x27;s pajama top as a nightie in the 1943 film &quot;Old Acquaintance&quot;, it caused a fashion revolution, with I. Magnin selling out of men&#x27;s sleepwear the morning after the movie opened, and all of it to young women.

Since the late 18th century some people, in particular those in the US and to some extent Britain, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, have worn pajamas in public for convenience or as a fashion statement.

One reason for the increased wearing of pajamas in public is that people no longer face the same social pressure as in the past.

In January 1976, the gulf emirate Ras Al Khaimah, UAE introduced a strict dress code for all local government workers forbidding them from wearing pajamas to work.

In January 2016, the Tesco supermarket in St Mellons, Cardiff, United Kingdom, started a ban on customers wearing pajamas.

In May 2010, Shanghai discouraged the wearing of pajamas in public during Expo 2010.

In January 2012, a local Dublin branch of the Government&#x27;s Department of Social Protection advised that pajamas were not regarded as appropriate attire for clients attending the office for welfare services.

Many school and work dress codes do not allow pajamas. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, an Illinois school district set remote learning guidelines which state that pajamas should not be worn while studying remotely and students should follow the same dress code as they normally would at school.

Schools sometimes designate a &quot;pajama day&quot; when students and staff come to school in their pajamas to boost school spirit.

In movies and television, characters are often depicted wearing pajamas in bed, as a more proper alternative to other forms of nightwear. These are commonly pajama pants with a shirt or t-shirt.

<text>A draped garment (draped dress) is a garment that is made of a single piece of cloth that is draped around the body; drapes are not cut away or stitched as in a tailored garment. Drapes can be held to the body by means of knotting, pinning, fibulae, clasps, sashes, belts, tying drawstrings, or just plain friction and gravity alone. Many draped garments consist of only one single piece. 

An advanced form of the garment is the [[tailor]]ed dress, which is constructed from fabric that has been cut into pieces and stitched together to fit various parts of the body. In comparison to draped dresses, they are more fitted to the body.

== History ==
Draping is a most ancient and widespread form of clothing. Many visual arts of the Romans and Indian sculptures, terracottas, cave paintings, and wood carvings (also shown in picture gallery) representing men and women show the same, unstitched clothes with various wrapping and draping styles. 

Uttariya, and Antariya are few evident clothing items of draped garments from the Vedic period. Kasaya, another rectangular piece of the Buddhist robe, is a real example of the draped garment. Further evolved forms are Sari, and Odhni, etc.

The kāṣāya, also called &quot;jiāshā&quot; (Chinese: 袈裟), consists of three pieces, with the saṃghāti as the most visible part of the buddhist attire. It is worn over the upper robe (&quot;uttarāsaṅga&quot;). Uttarāsaṅga is a robe covering the upper body that comes over the undergarment, or &quot;antarvāsa&quot;. The antarvāsa is the inner robe covering the lower body. The latter are covered with &quot;saṃghāti&quot;.

== Examples ==

More examples of draped clothing are:
* Uttariya an upper body garment.
* Adivasah is a loose-fitting outer garment, it is a type of over garment similar to a mantle or cloak.
* Antariya a lower body garment.
*Angvastra a kind of stole.
*Stanapatta a chest band to cover the breasts.
* Sari is a draped garment of south Asia, typically wrapped around the waist, with one end draped over the shoulder, partly baring the midriff.
*Peplos Long draped garment worn by women of Ancient Greece; often open on one side, with a deep fold at the top, and fastened on both shoulders.
*Palla (garment) a long rectangular piece of cloth, folded in half lengthwise and used as a cloak by Roman women.
* Chitons
* Togas a very long length of woolen fabric that Romans wrapped around themselves, draping it over the left shoulder and arm and leaving the right arm free.
* Himation an ancient Greek garment similar to the Roman toga.
* Stolas long full robe with or without sleeves and drawn in with a belt; it was worn by Roman women, corresponding to the toga, that was worn by men. The stola was usually woollen.
*Sudanese thawb: Women&#x27;s outer draped garment, a rectangular length of fabric, generally two meters wide and four to seven meters long.
* Pareos
* Ponchos
* Cloaks
* Shawls
*Scarf
*Matchcoats, a Native American garment similar to the ancient Greek himation.

=== Haute couture ===
Wrapped and draped dresses continue to inspire many fashion designers. Madame Grès was a well-known French couturier known for her draping art. Her most notable work are so-called floor-length draped Grecian goddess gowns.

<doc id="153875" wikidata="Q7573076" url="?curid=153875" title="Spandex fetishism">
<text>Spandex fetishism is a fetishistic attraction to people wearing form-fitting stretch fabrics or to the wearing of items of clothing made of such material. Spandex garments are often worn by swimmers, gymnasts, ballet dancers, wrestlers, rowers, cyclists, contortionists and circus performers, and spandex fetishists may incorporate fantasies about these activities into their particular fetish.

One reason spandex and other tight fabrics may be fetishized is that the garment forms a &quot;second skin&quot;, acting as a surrogate for the wearer&#x27;s own skin. Wearers of skin-tight nylon and cotton spandex garments can appear naked or coated in a shiny or matte substance like paint. The tightness of the garments may also be seen as sexual bondage. Another reason, at least pertinent to nylon-spandex fabric, is that the material can have a very smooth and silk-like finish, which lends a tactile dimension to the fetish - as well as a visual one. The pressure of tight garments against the genitals can become quite sensual.

Pantyhose fetishism can be viewed as a class of spandex fetishism.

<doc id="153882" wikidata="Q330262" url="?curid=153882" title="Spandex">
<text>Spandex, Lycra, or elastane is a synthetic fiber known for its exceptional elasticity. It is a polyether-polyurea copolymer that was invented in 1958 by chemist Joseph Shivers at DuPont.
==Name==
The name &quot;spandex&quot;, which is an anagram of the word &quot;expands&quot;, is the preferred name in North America. In continental Europe, it is referred to by variants of &quot;elastane&quot;. It is primarily known as &quot;Lycra&quot; in the UK, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Latin America, Australia, and New Zealand.

Brand names for spandex include Lycra (made by The Lycra Company, previously a division of DuPont Textiles and Interiors), Elaspan (The Lycra Company), Acepora (Taekwang Group), Creora (Hyosung), INVIYA (Indorama Corporation), ROICA and Dorlastan (Asahi Kasei), Linel (Fillattice), and ESPA (Toyobo).

==Production==
Unlike many other synthetic fibers, spandex cannot be melt-processed because the polymer degrades upon melting. Spandex fibers are produced by several spinning technologies. Typically, a concentrated solution of the polymer is drawn through spinnerets at temperatures where the solvent evaporates.

Spandex is mainly composed of a polyurea derived from the reaction of a diol and a diisocyanate. Two classes of spandex are defined by the &quot;macrodiols&quot;. One class of macrodiols is the oligomer produced from tetrahydrofuran (i.e. polytetrahydrofuran). Another class of diols, the so-called ester diols, are oligomers derived from condensation of adipic acid and glycols. Spandex produced from the ester diols is more resilient photochemically and to chlorinated water. Almost always, the diisocyanate is methylenebis(phenyl isocyanate). The key linking reaction is formation or the urea (aka urethane):
The polyurea is usually treated with various diamines, which function as chain extenders.

== Function ==
The exceptional elasticity of spandex fibers increases the clothing&#x27;s pressure comfort, enhancing the ease of body movements. Pressure comfort is the response towards clothing by the human body&#x27;s pressure receptors (mechanoreceptors present in skin sensory cells). The sensation response is affected mainly by the stretch, snug, loose, heavy, lightweight, soft, and stiff structure of the material. 

The elasticity and strength (stretching up to five times its length) of spandex has been incorporated into a wide range of garments, especially in skin-tight garments. A benefit of spandex is its significant strength and elasticity and its ability to return to the original shape after stretching and faster drying than ordinary fabrics. For clothing, spandex is usually mixed with cotton or polyester, and accounts for a small percentage of the final fabric, which therefore retains most of the look and feel of the other fibers. An estimated 80% of clothing sold in the United States contained spandex in 2010.

== History ==
The easy condensation of diols and diisocyanates was recognized in the 1930s as the result of work by Otto Bayer. Fibers suitable for replacing nylon were not created from urethanes, but instead this theme led to a family of specialized elastic fabrics.

In the post-World War II era, DuPont Textiles Fibers Department, formed in 1952, became the most profitable division of DuPont, dominating the synthetic fiber market worldwide. At this time, women began to emerge as a significant group of consumers because of their need for underwear and hosiery. After conducting market research to find out what women wanted from textiles, DuPont began developing fibers to meet such needs—including a better fiber for women&#x27;s girdles, which were commonly made of rubber at the time. 

In the early 1950s chemist Joseph C. Shivers modified Dacron polyester, producing an elastic fiber that could withstand high temperatures. 

=== Lycra brand ===
To distinguish its brand of spandex fiber, DuPont chose the trade name &quot;Lycra&quot; (originally called &quot;Fiber K&quot;). DuPont launched an extensive publicity campaign for its Lycra brand, taking advertisements and full-page ads in top women&#x27;s magazines. Audrey Hepburn helped catapult the brand on and off-screen during this time; models and actresses like Joan Collins and Ann-Margret followed Hepburn&#x27;s aesthetic by posing in Lycra clothing for photo shoots and magazine covers.

By the mid-1970s, with the emergence of the women&#x27;s liberation movement, girdle sales began to drop as they came to be associated with anti-independence and emblematic of an era that was quickly passing away. In response, DuPont marketed Lycra as the aerobic fitness movement emerged in the 1970s. The association of Lycra with fitness had been established at the 1968 Winter Olympic Games, when the French ski team wore Lycra garments. The fiber came to be especially popular in mid-thigh-length shorts worn by cyclists.

By the 1980s, the fitness trend had reached its height in popularity and fashionistas began wearing shorts on the street. Spandex proved such a popular fiber in the garment industry that, by 1987, DuPont had trouble meeting worldwide demand. In the 1990s a variety of other items made with spandex proved popular, including a successful line of body-shaping foundation garments sold under the trade name &quot;Bodyslimmers&quot;. As the decade progressed, shirts, pants, dresses, and even shoes were being made with spandex blends, and mass-market retailers like Banana Republic were even using it for menswear.

In 2019, control of the Lycra Company was sold by Koch Industries to Shandong Ruyi.

== Environmental impact ==
Most clothes containing spandex are difficult to recycle. Even a 5% inclusion of spandex will render the fabric incompatible with most mechanical recycling machines.

<doc id="153886" wikidata="Q1417676" url="?curid=153886" title="Rubber and PVC fetishism">
<text>Rubber fetishism, or latex fetishism, is the fetishistic attraction to people wearing latex clothing or, in certain cases, to the garments themselves. PVC fetishism is closely related to rubber fetishism, with the former referring to shiny clothes made of the synthetic plastic polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and the latter referring to clothes made of rubber, which is generally thicker, less shiny, and more matte than latex. PVC is sometimes confused with the similarly shiny patent leather, which is also a fetish material. Latex or rubber fetishists sometimes refer to themselves as &quot;rubberists&quot;. Male rubberists tend to call themselves &quot;rubbermen&quot;.

The terms &quot;PVC&quot;, &quot;vinyl&quot; and &quot;PU&quot; tend to be used interchangeably by retailers for clothing (PVC clothing as a form of plastic clothing) made from shiny plastic-coated fabrics. These fabrics usually consist of a backing woven from polyester fibers with a surface coating of shiny plastic. The plastic layer itself is typically a blend of PVC and polyurethane (PU), with 100% PVC producing a stiff fabric with a glossy shine and 100% PU producing a stretchy fabric with a silky shine. A manufacturer&#x27;s label may say, for example, 67% polyester, 33% polyurethane for a fabric that contains no PVC; or 80% polyvinyl chloride, 20% polyurethane with mention of the polyester backing omitted. The plastic layer is often textured to look like leather (&quot;leatherlook&quot;, &quot;pleather&quot;), as opposed to smooth (&quot;wetlook&quot;, &quot;patent&quot;).

==Motives==

One reason why latex or other tight shiny fabrics may be fetishised is perhaps that the garment forms a &quot;second skin&quot; that acts as a fetishistic surrogate for the wearer&#x27;s own skin. Thus, wearers of skin-tight latex or PVC garments may be perceived by the viewer as being naked, or simply coated in a shiny substance like paint. Latex and PVC can also be polished to be shiny and can also be produced in bright colours, adding further visual stimulus to add to the physical sensations produced by the material. The tightness of the garments may also be viewed as a kind of sexual bondage. The smell of latex rubber is also a turn-on for some rubber fetishists, and such garments are usually impregnated with chemicals to enhance the odour. Some rubberists also enjoy the idea of exhibitionism, and some fantasise about going out in public wearing fetish attire. Some do this, especially in more liberal areas (e.g., Berlin, New York, Montreal, San Francisco).

A compelling reason that people are turned on by wearing rubber is its transformative abilities. As with any costume, a rubberist can imagine themselves having a new identity, especially one that permits a different code of behavior.

==Practices==

Latex fetishism sometimes involves dressing up in the material; looking at it worn by sexual partners; or fantasies sometimes wearers of skin-tight or other latex garments, such as divers and workers wearing industrial protective clothing. Another common stereotype is of the image of a dominatrix wearing a skin-tight, usually jet-black, latex or PVC catsuit.

Some latex enthusiasts are also turned on by the wearing of draped latex garments, such as cloaks. Other rubber paraphernalia, such as wet suits, gas masks, splash suits, Mackintoshes, galoshes, Wellington boots, rubber/plastic pants, and diapers are also often added to the scenario. Heavier fetishists often attempt duplicating all kinds of &quot;everyday wear&quot; into a rubber counterpart. Some PVC enthusiasts are turned on by PVC hazmat suits and other forms of industrial protective clothing.

For hygienic reasons, many sex toys such as dildos and butt plugs are made from rubber or similar materials, and this is also a factor in rubber fetishism. Some rubber fetishists are also medical fetishists or have an interest in klismaphilia; medical gloves and catheters are made from latex, as are condoms.

A substantial industry exists to produce specialist latex or rubber fetish clothing garments for rubber enthusiasts.

Many latex or rubber clothes appear on websites such as eBay, and in recent years clothes made in PVC have been prevalent in young people&#x27;s fashions, particularly in jackets, skirts and trousers. Several mainstream designers have made latex clothing.

A number of fetish magazines have been published on the subject of rubber and PVC fetishism, including &quot;AtomAge&quot;, &quot;Dressing for Pleasure&quot;, &quot;Marquis&quot;, &quot;«O»&quot;, &quot;Shiny International&quot;, and &quot;Skin Two&quot;.

==Latex look-alike materials==
PVC/vinyl and metal are two other shiny materials used for clothing, from regular street wear (raincoats) to PVC hazmat suits and other forms of industrial protective clothing. As with latex, these materials became more noted as fetish material in the 1960s and early 1970s. During that era, boots and garments made of PVC and vinyl were made and worn in public areas to some degrees. The British TV programme &quot;The Avengers&quot; showcased this.

Numerous underground fetish production houses were started, which published magazines such as &quot;Shiny&quot;, &quot;Shiny&#x27;s International&quot;, &quot;Rubberist&quot;, &quot;Dressing for Pleasure&quot; (both of these publications later merged with each other), and rubber fetish author Helen Henley and others of this time frame.

Fashion designers such as Jean Paul Gaultier, Yves Saint Laurent, Pierre Cardin and André Courrèges have used PVC in their collections. Since 2010, the PVC has been the target of fashion for both the male and female public.

<text>The Mackintosh raincoat (abbreviated as mac) is a form of waterproof raincoat, first sold in 1824, made of rubberised fabric. 

The Mackintosh is named after its Scottish inventor Charles Macintosh, although many writers added a letter &quot;k&quot;. The variant spelling of &quot;Mackintosh&quot; is now standard.

Although the Mackintosh coat style has become generic, a genuine Mackintosh coat is made from rubberised or rubber laminated material.

== History ==
It has been claimed that the material was invented by the surgeon James Syme, but then copied and patented by Charles Macintosh; Syme&#x27;s method of creating the solvent from coal tar was published in Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Annals of Philosophy&quot; in 1818; this paper also describes the dissolution of natural rubber in naphtha.

However, a detailed history of the invention of the Mackintosh was published by Schurer. The essence of Macintosh&#x27;s process was the sandwiching of an impermeable layer of a solution of rubber in naphtha between two layers of fabric. The naphtha was distilled from coal tar, with the Bonnington Chemical Works being a major supplier. Syme did not propose the sandwich idea, and his paper did not mention waterproofing. Waterproofing garments with rubber was an old idea and was practised in pre-Columbian times by the Aztecs, who impregnated fabric with latex. Later French scientists made balloons gas-tight (and incidentally, impermeable) by impregnating fabric with rubber dissolved in turpentine, but this solvent was not satisfactory for making apparel.

In 1830 Macintosh&#x27;s company merged with the clothing company of Thomas Hancock in Manchester. Hancock had also been experimenting with rubber coated fabrics since 1819. Production of rubberised coats soon spread across the UK. All kinds of coats were produced with rubberized material, including riding coats and coats supplied to the British Army, British railways, and UK police forces.

Early coats had problems with poor smell, stiffness, and a tendency to melt in hot weather. Hancock improved his waterproof fabrics, patenting a method for vulcanising rubber in 1843, solving many of the problems.
Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the company continued to make waterproof clothing. In 1925 the company was taken over by Dunlop Rubber.

== Revival ==
In the mid-1990s the Mackintosh brand owner, Traditional Weatherwear, was on the verge of closing its factory in Blairlinn, Cumbernauld near Glasgow. Around the turn of the 21st century, senior staff members acquired the company and established the traditional rubberised Mackintosh coat as an upmarket brand in its own right. The company collaborated with leading fashion houses such as Gucci, Hermès, Louis Vuitton, and Liberty. The coats became particularly popular with Japanese women, and the company won a Queen&#x27;s Award for Enterprise in 2000 for its success in international trade. In December 2003 the company name was formally changed to Mackintosh.

In 2007, Mackintosh was bought by Tokyo firm Yagi Tsusho. With the backing of its parent company, Mackintosh has continued to expand its reputation and marketing operations. In January 2011, the company opened its first fashion store in London.
In Japan the brand is distributed by Sanyo Shokai.

<doc id="153895" wikidata="Q127385223" url="?curid=153895" title="Gender neutrality in languages with gendered third-person pronouns">
<text>A third-person pronoun is a pronoun that refers to an entity other than the speaker or listener. Some languages, such as Slavic, with gender-specific pronouns have them as part of a grammatical gender system, a system of agreement where most or all nouns have a value for this grammatical category. A few languages with gender-specific pronouns, such as English, Afrikaans, Defaka, Khmu, Malayalam, Tamil, and Yazgulyam, lack grammatical gender; in such languages, gender usually adheres to &quot;natural gender&quot;, which is often based on biological sex. Other languages, including most Austronesian languages, lack gender distinctions in personal pronouns entirely, as well as any system of grammatical gender.

In languages with pronominal gender, problems of usage may arise in contexts where a person of unspecified or unknown social gender is being referred to but commonly available pronouns are gender-specific. Different solutions to this issue have been proposed and used in various languages.

== Overview of grammar patterns in languages==

=== No gender distinctions in personal pronouns ===
Many languages of the world (including most Austronesian languages, many East Asian languages, the Quechuan languages, and the Uralic languages) do not have gender distinctions in personal pronouns, just as most of them lack any system of grammatical gender. In others, such as many of the Niger–Congo languages, there is a system of grammatical gender (or noun classes), but the divisions are based on classifications other than sex, such as animacy, rationality, or countability. In Swahili, for example, the independent third person pronoun yeye &#x27;she/he&#x27; can be used to refer to a female or male being. What matters in this case is that the referent belongs to the animate class (i.e humans or non-human animals) as opposed to an inanimate class. Since pronouns do not distinguish the social gender of the referent, they are considered neutral in this kind of system.

=== Grammatical gender ===
In other languages – including most Indo-European and Afro-Asiatic languages – third-person personal pronouns (at least those used to refer to people) intrinsically distinguish male from female. This feature commonly co-exists with a full system of grammatical gender, where all nouns are assigned to classes such as masculine, feminine and neuter.

In languages with grammatical gender, even pronouns which are semantically gender-neutral may be required to take a gender for such purposes as grammatical agreement. Thus in French, for example, the first- and second-person personal pronouns may behave as either masculine or feminine depending on the sex of the referent; and indefinite pronouns such as (&#x27;someone&#x27;) and (&#x27;no one&#x27;) are treated conventionally as masculine, even though as a noun (&#x27;person&#x27;) is only feminine regardless of the sex of the referent. (See .) There are both direct and indirect options for nonbinary referents, although the use of some forms is contested.

Example of agreement in a language with grammatical gender
 (1) &quot;Les tomates, elles sont encore vertes.&quot;   Formal French
 &#x27;The tomatoes, they are still green.&#x27; FP,
 (Lambrecht 1981:40, cited by Gelderen, 2022, p. 33)

 (2) &quot;C&#x27;est que chacun, il a sa manière de ...&quot;   Swiss spoken French
 &#x27;Everyone has his own way of ...&#x27;
 (Fronseca-Greber 2000:338, cited by Gelderen, 2022, p. 33)

=== Gender distinctions only in third-person pronouns ===

A grammatical gender system can erode as observed in languages such as Odia (formerly Oriya), English and Persian. In English, a general system of noun gender has been lost, but gender distinctions are preserved in the third-person singular pronouns. This means that the relation between pronouns and nouns is no longer syntactically motivated in the system at large. Instead, the choice of anaphoric pronouns is controlled by referential gender or social gender.

Example of agreement in English

 (3) Maryi &quot;described Bill&quot;j &quot;to herself&quot;i&quot;.&quot;

 (4) Johnj &quot;came in and he&quot;j &quot;was wearing a hat.&quot;

=== Issues concerning gender and pronoun usage ===
Issues concerning gender and pronoun usage commonly arise in situations where it is necessary to choose between gender-specific pronouns, even though the sex of the person or persons being referred to is not known, not specified, or (for plurals) mixed. In English and many other languages, the masculine form has sometimes served as the default or unmarked form; that is, masculine pronouns have been used in cases where the referent or referents are not known to be (all) female. This collective masculine is also the case in ancient languages, like Classical Greek and Biblical Hebrew and have influenced the modern forms. This leads to sentences such as (5a) in English, and (6a) in French.

Example of gender-neutral masculine: English
 (5) a. &quot;If anybody comes, tell him.&quot; masculine &quot;him&quot; used to refer to a person of unknown sex
 b. *&quot;If anybody comes, tell her.&quot; feminine &quot;her&quot; is not used to refer to a person of unknown sex
Example of collective masculine: French
 (6) a. Vos amis sont arrivés — Ils étaient en avance. 
 &#x27;Your friends have arrived - they were early.&#x27;
 Note: plural masculine &quot;ils&quot; used if group has men and women
 b. Vos amies sont arrivées — Elles étaient en avance. 
 &#x27;Your friendsFEM have arrivedFEM - theyFEM were early.&#x27;
 Note: plural feminine &quot;elles&quot; used if group has only women;
 noun is feminine (&quot;amies&quot;), as is past participle (&quot;arrivées&quot;)

As early as 1795, dissatisfaction with the convention of the collective masculine led to calls for gender-neutral pronouns, and attempts to invent pronouns for this purpose date back to at least 1850, although the use of singular &quot;they&quot; as a natural gender-neutral pronoun in English has persisted since the 14th century.

== Gender-neutral pronouns in modern standard English ==

The English language has gender-specific personal pronouns in the third-person singular. The masculine pronoun is &quot;he&quot; (with the related forms him, his and himself); the feminine is &quot;she&quot; (with the related forms her, hers and herself); the neuter is it (with the related forms its and itself). The third-person plural they (and its related forms them, their, themselves) are gender-neutral and can also be used to refer to singular, personal antecedents, as in (7).

 (7) &quot;Where a recipient of an allowance under section 4 absents themself from Canada,&quot;
 &quot;payment of the allowance shall&quot; ...

Generally speaking, he refers to males, and she refers to females. When a person has adopted a persona of a different gender (such as when acting or performing in drag), pronouns with the gender of the persona are used. In gay slang, the gender of pronouns is sometimes reversed (gender transposition).

He and she are normally used for humans; use of it can be dehumanizing, and, more importantly, implies a lack of gender even if one is present, and is usually, thus, inappropriate. It is sometimes used to refer to a baby or a child in a generic sense as in response to the question What is it? when a baby has been born: -It&#x27;s a girl/boy. However, when talking to parents of intersex babies, some doctors are advised to use your baby instead. It is often used for non-human animals of unknown sex, but he or she is frequently used for a non-human animal with a known sex. He or she are also for a non-human animal who is referred to by a proper name, as in (8) where Fido is understood to be the name of a dog. At least one grammar states that &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot; is obligatory for animals referred to by a proper name.

 (8) &quot;Fido adores his blanket&quot;.

The other English pronouns (the first- and second-person personal pronouns I, we, you, etc.; the third-person plural personal pronoun they; the indefinite pronouns one, someone, anyone, etc.; and others) do not make male–female gender distinctions; that is, they are gender-neutral. The only distinction made is between personal and non-personal reference (someone vs. something, anyone vs. anything, who vs. what, whoever vs. whatever, etc.).

She is sometimes used for named ships and countries; this may be considered old-fashioned and is in decline. In some local dialects and casual speech she and he are used for various objects and named vehicles (like a personal car). Animate objects like robots and voice assistants are often assumed to have a gender and sometimes have a name with a matching gender. (See .)

For people who are transgender, style guides and associations of journalists and health professionals advise use of the pronoun preferred or considered appropriate by the person in question. When dealing with clients or patients, health practitioners are advised to take note of the pronouns used by the individuals themselves, which may involve using different pronouns at different times. This is also extended to the name preferred by the person referred to. LGBTQ+ advocacy groups also advise using the pronouns and names preferred or considered appropriate by the person referred to. They further recommend avoiding gender confusion when referring to the background of transgender people, such as using a title or rank to avoid a gendered pronoun or name.

For English, there is no universal agreement on a gender-neutral third-person pronoun which could be used for a person whose gender is unknown or who is a non-binary gender identity; various alternatives are described in the following sections.

===Singular &quot;they&quot; as a gender-neutral pronoun===

Since at least the 14th century, they (including related forms such as them, their, theirs, themselves, and themself) has been used with a plural verb form to refer to a singular antecedent. This usage is known as the singular they, as it is equivalent to the corresponding singular form of the pronoun.

 (9) &quot;There&#x27;s not a man I meet but doth salute me&quot;
 &quot;As if I were their well-acquainted friend&quot;
 &lt;(William Shakespeare, A Comedy of Errors, 1623)
 instead of: &quot;As if I were his well-acquainted friend&quot;

This is the generalized usage in third person. To imply &#x27;his&#x27; is incorrect. 

 (10) &quot;Every fool can do as they&#x27;re bid.&quot;
 &lt;(Jonathan Swift, Polite Conversation, 1738)
 instead of: &quot;Every fool can do as he&#x27;s bid.&quot;

 (11) &quot;Both sisters were uncomfortable enough.&quot;
 &quot;Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves.&quot;
 &lt;(Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice, 1813)&quot;&quot;
 instead of: &quot;Each felt for the other, and of course for herself.&quot;

Prescription against singular they has historically impacted more formal registers of writing. Conversely, to the present day, singular they continues to be attested in both speech and less formal registers of writing in British and American English. Recent corpus data suggest that English dialects in Hong Kong, India, and Singapore use this epicene less than British English. The &quot;Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot; and the &quot;Merriam-Webster Dictionary&quot; include the following examples among the possible uses of singular they, which they note is not universally adopted by all speakers.
 (12) &quot;Anyone who arrives at the door can let themself in using this key.&quot;

 (13) &quot;I knew certain things about ... the person I was interviewing ...&quot;
 They &quot;had adopted their gender-neutral name a few years ago,&quot;
 &quot;when they began to consciously identify as nonbinary ...&quot;
 (Amy Harmon)
While many speakers recognize the need for gender neutral pronouns, they nevertheless deem referential singular &quot;they,&quot; as in (13), ungrammatical or unfit for the job due to the ambiguity it can create in certain contexts. New pronouns such as ve (used in science fiction) and ze/hir have been proposed in order to avoid the perceived limitations of singular they. Currently, these new pronouns are only used by a small percentage of speakers while singular they remains the most widely selected option.

==== Antecedents for singular &quot;they&quot; ====
Generally speaking, there are three kinds of antecedents with which the singular they can be used.

* In (14), singular they occurs with a quantified singular antecedent or a singular antecedent of unknown gender.
* In (15), singular they occurs with a singular antecedent known to be nonbinary or ungendered.
* In (16), singular they occurs with a singular antecedent of any gender, with no restriction on description or name.

In examples (14-16), subscripti indicates coreference; moreover, examples such as (15) and (16) are sometimes referred to as &#x27;referential they&#x27;.

 (14) a. Anyonei who thinks theyi need more time should ask for an extension.
 b. The personi at the door left before I could see who theyi were.

 (15) a. Kellyi said theyi were leaving early.
 b. The strongest studenti will present theiri paper next.
 (16) a. Mariai wants to send theiri students on the field trip.
 b. We heard from Arthuri that theyi needed time to think about the idea.
 c. We asked [the first girl in line]i to introduce themself/themselvesi.
 d. Your brotheri called to say theyi would be late.

==== Speaker variation ====
In the twenty-first century, syntactic research differentiates three groups of English speakers which can be identified, based on their judgments about pronoun usage for (14), (15) and (16).

* Group A speakers judge only (14) to be acceptable. Such speakers reject &quot;referential&quot; singular when they know the referent&#x27;s binary gender, which is taken to indicate that gender features are contrastive in their lexicons. For this group of speakers, usage of singular &quot;they&quot; in (14) is acceptable to because the quantified antecedent &quot;anyone&quot; and the definite description &quot;the person&quot; lack a gender specification.
* Group B speakers judge both (14) and (15) to be acceptable. For these speakers, gender is thought to still be contrastive in their lexicons; however, they have created special entries for individuals that use the singular &quot;they&quot; pronoun.
* Group C speakers judge (14), (15) and (16) to be acceptable. It has been proposed that gender is losing its featural contrast in these speakers&#x27; lexicons.
A recent study by Kirby Conrod found these speaker groups to be correlated with age and gender identity. Relative to age, participants of all ages accepted the usage in (14), whereas younger participants rated usage of referential &quot;they&quot; in (15) and (16) higher than did their older counterparts. Relative to gender identity, non-binary and transgender participants rated referential &quot;they&quot; higher than did cisgender participants. Elsewhere, cisgender speakers with at least one trans or non-binary family member have also been found to rate all three cases as acceptable. Another study found a correlation between resistance to the second and third uses and prescriptivist attitudes about language.

Work by Keir Moulton and colleagues, published in 2020, has also found that the presence of a linguistic antecedent — which is the case for examples (14), (15), and (16) — significantly improves the acceptability judgments of singular &quot;they&quot;. In sentences with a linguistic antecedent, such as (17a), the use of singular &quot;they&quot; is judged to be equally acceptable whether or not the hearer knows the (binary) gender of the referent. In sentences where singular &quot;they&quot; is purely deictic and has no linguistic antecedent, such as (17b), the use of singular &quot;they&quot; is judged to be less acceptable than the use of a singular gendered pronoun (such as he or she) when the hearer knows the referent&#x27;s (binary) gender. The authors suggest that the use of a gender-neutral antecedent (e.g. server or reporter) may signal the irrelevance of gender in the discourse context, making singular &quot;they&quot; more acceptable. Additionally, having a linguististic antecedent clarified that the speaker was referring to a singular antecedent, rather than a plural one. In the deictic case, without a linguistic antecedent, these signals were not overt, and the speakers&#x27; judgment depended more on their experience with the pronoun itself.

Type of antecedent affects acceptability of singular &quot;their&quot; (subscript i denotes coreference)
 (17) a. &quot;The reporteri &quot;said that theiri &quot;cellphone was recording the whole interview&quot;.
 Note: judged as more acceptable
 b. Theyi &quot;said that their&quot;i &quot;cellphone was recording the whole interview&quot;. 
 Note: judged as less acceptable

Another study found an effect of social distance on speaker judgments of singular they use. Usage was judged to be more acceptable when the speaker was not personally close with the referent, compared to use for referents with whom the speaker was personally close. The authors suggested that, in the former case, the referent&#x27;s gender may be less likely to be known or relevant.

=== Reference to males and females ===

====Generic &quot;he&quot;====
Forms of the pronoun &quot;he&quot; were used for both males and females during the Middle English and Modern English periods. Susanne Wagner observed that &quot;There was rather an extended period of time in the history of the English language when the choice of a supposedly masculine personal pronoun (&quot;him&quot;) said nothing about the gender or sex of the referent.&quot; An early example of prescribing the use of &quot;he&quot; to refer to a person of unknown gender is Anne Fisher&#x27;s 1745 grammar book &quot;A New Grammar&quot;. Older editions of Fowler also took this view. This usage continues to this day:
 (18) a. &quot;The customer brought his purchases to the cashier for checkout.&quot;
 b. &quot;In a supermarket, a customer can buy anything he needs.&quot;
 c. &quot;When a customer argues, always agree with him.&quot;

This may be compared to usage of the word &quot;man&quot; for humans in general (although that was the original sense of the word &quot;man&quot; in the Germanic languages, much as the Latin word for &quot;human in general&quot;, &quot;homo&quot;, came to mean &quot;male human&quot;—which was &quot;vir&quot;, in Latin—in most of the Romance languages).
 (19) a. &quot;All men are created equal.&quot;
 b. Man &quot;cannot live by bread alone.&quot;

The use, in formal English, of he, him or his as a gender-neutral pronoun has traditionally been considered grammatically correct. For example, William Safire in his &quot;On Language&quot; column in &quot;The New York Times&quot; approved of the use of generic he, mentioning the mnemonic phrase &quot;the male embraces the female&quot;. A reader replied with an example of use of the purportedly gender-neutral &quot;he&quot;, as in (20). Such examples point to the fact indiscriminate use of generic he leads to non-sensical violations of semantic gender agreement.

 (20) &quot;&quot;The average American needs the small routines of getting ready for work.&quot;
 &quot;As he shaves or blow-dries his hair or pulls on his panty-hose,&quot;
 &quot;he is easing himself by small stages into the demands of the day.&quot;&quot;
 (C. , &quot;The New York Times&quot; (1985); as quoted by Miller and Swift.)

The use of generic &quot;he&quot; has increasingly been a source of controversy, as it can be perceived as reflecting a positive bias towards men and a male-centric society, and a negative bias against women. In some contexts, the use of he, him or his as a gender-neutral pronoun may give a jarring or ridiculous impression:

 (21) a. &quot;... everyone will be able to decide for himself whether or not to have an abortion.&quot;
 (Albert Bleumenthal, N.Y. State Assembly (cited in Longman 1984,
 as quoted in &quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Concise Dictionary of English Usage&quot;
 b. &quot;&quot;... the ideal that every boy and girl should be so equipped&quot;
 &quot;that he shall not be handicapped in his struggle for social progress&quot;..&quot;.&quot;&quot;
 (C. C. Fries, &quot;American English Grammar&quot; (1940), quoted in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; 1983;
 as cited in &quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Concise Dictionary of English Usage&quot;
 c. &quot;... She and Louis had a game—who could find the ugliest photograph of himself.&quot;
 (Joseph P. Lash, &quot;Eleanor and Franklin&quot; (1971), quoted in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; 1983;
 as cited in &quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Concise Dictionary of English Usage&quot;)

The use of generic he has also been seen as prejudicial by some, as in the following cases:
* The Massachusetts Medical Society effectively blocked membership of female physicians on the grounds that the society&#x27;s by-laws used the pronoun &quot;he&quot; when referring to members.
* The Persons Case, the legal battle over whether Canadian women counted as legal persons eligible to sit in the Senate, partially turned on use of &quot;he&quot; to refer to a (generic) person qualified to be a senator.

Avoidance of the generic he is seen by proponents of non-sexist writing as indicating that the purportedly gender-neutral he is in fact not gender-neutral since it &quot;brings a male image to mind&quot;. The same would apply to the generic she, bringing a female image to mind. She has traditionally been used as a generic pronoun when making generalizations about people belonging to a group when most members of that group are assumed to be female:

 (22) a. &quot;A secretary should keep her temper in check.&quot;
 b. &quot;A nurse must always be kind to her patients.&quot;
The 19th and 20th centuries saw an upsurge in consciousness and advocacy of gender equality, and this has led in particular to advocacy for gender-neutral language. In this context, the usage of generic he has declined in favor of other alternatives.

==== &quot;He or she&quot;, &quot;(s)he&quot; ====
To disambiguate contexts where a referent encompasses both males and females, periphrasis is used. Though cumbersome, this solution is attested with the full range of English pronouns, include the subject pronouns he or she (23), the object pronouns him or her (24), the possessive pronoun his or hers (25), and the reflective pronouns himself or herself (26). In writing, these periphrastic forms are sometimes abbreviated to he/she, (s)he, s/he, him/her, his/her, himself/herself, hers/his, but are not easily abbreviated in verbal communication.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge s/he&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of (s)he and s/he, a writer does in principle have the choice of which pronoun to place first. However, usage indicates that the masculine pronouns is most often mentioned first.

 (23) a. &quot;If any employee needs to take time off,&quot;
 &quot;s/he should contact the Personnel Department&quot;.
 b. &quot;Talk to your doctor and see if s/he knows of any local groups.&quot;
 c. &quot;Each employee must sign the register when she/he enters or leaves&quot;.
 d. &quot;Read to children and let them participate from time to time by telling them what&quot;
 &quot;they think the author would add if she or he was present with them&quot;.&quot;&quot;

 (24) a. &quot;How often do you perform small acts of kindness for your partner&quot;
 (&quot;like making him or her coffee in the mornin&quot;g)?.
 b. &quot;Clearly, no one in the entire United States simply meets someone,&quot;
 &quot;talks with him or her a while, and falls in love any more.&quot;

 (25) a. &quot;We must fight the tradition that forces the actor to accept poverty&quot;
 &quot;as a precondition of his or her profession&quot;.
 b. [insert example]

 (26) a. &quot;... at the collegiate level the student must advocate for himself or herself.&quot;
 b. &quot;... no student, of any background, should be expected at the outset&quot;
 &quot;to recognize him or herself in it&quot;.
 c. &quot;Everyone will improve him/herself in his/her area&quot; ...

Some observers, such as the linguist James McCawley, suggest that the use of periphrastic forms may promote stereotypes: &quot;he and she [can foster] the standard sexual stereotypes [in that] if you say he or she, you imply that women aren&#x27;t included unless they are specifically mentioned, and you make it easier to talk about cases where only one sex is included than where both are.&quot;

====Alternation of &quot;she&quot; and &quot;he&quot;====
Authors sometimes employ rubrics for selecting &quot;she&quot; or &quot;he&quot; such as:
* Use the gender of the primary author.
* Alternate between &quot;she&quot; and &quot;he&quot;.
* Alternate by paragraph or chapter.
* Use &quot;she&quot; and &quot;he&quot; to make distinctions between two groups of people.

=== &quot;It&quot; as a gender-neutral pronoun ===
Old English had grammatical gender, and thus commonly used &quot;it&quot; for people, even where they were clearly female or male:

* (meaning &#x27;child&#x27;) had grammatical neuter gender, as did compound words formed from it, e.g. &#x27;male-child&#x27; and &#x27;female-child&#x27;. All three were pronominalized by the neuter pronoun it ().
* (meaning &quot;female&quot;, modern &quot;wife&quot;) had grammatical neuter gender, and so were pronominalized by the neuter pronoun it &quot;it&quot;. When wif was the non-head member of a compound — as with &#x27;female-person&#x27;, modern &#x27;woman&#x27; — the gender of the compound was determined by the head of the compound, in this case , which had grammatical masculine gender, and so was pronominalized by the masculine pronoun he.

Over time, English gradually developed a system of natural gender (gender based on semantic meaning) which now holds sway in Modern English.

==== For human children ====
In Modern English, pronouns referring to adult humans are typically gendered: feminine &quot;she&quot;, masculine &quot;he&quot;. However, in some contexts, children may be referred to with the gender-neutral pronoun &quot;it&quot;. When not referring specifically to children, &quot;it&quot; is not generally applied to people, even in cases where their gender is unknown.

The 1985 edition of the Quirk et al. grammar observes that whereas &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot; are used for entities treated as people (including anthropomorphized entities), the pronoun &quot;it&quot; is normally used for entities not regarded as persons. But the pronoun &quot;it&quot; can be used of children in some circumstances, for instance when the sex is indefinite or when the writer has no emotional connection to the child, as in a scientific context lsuch as (26). According to &quot;The Handbook of Non-Sexist Writing&quot; (1995), &quot;it&quot; is also sometimes the &quot;obvious&quot; choice for children. Examples given include (27a), and the more colloquial (27b). &quot;It&quot; may even be used when the child&#x27;s sex is known: In the passage given in (27c), the characters refer to the boy-child at the center of the narrative as a &quot;he&quot;, but then the narrator refers to it as an &quot;it&quot;. In this case, the child has yet to be developed into a character that can communicate with the reader.

 (27) a. A child learns to speak the language of its environment.
 (Quirk et al., &quot;A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language&quot; (1985), p. 316–317, 342)
 b. To society, a baby&#x27;s sex is second in importance to its health. 
 (Miller &amp; Swift, &quot;The Handbook of Non-Sexist Writing&quot; (1995), p. 58)
 c. &quot;He looks like nobody but himself,&quot; said Mrs. Owens, firmly.
 ... It was then that ... the child opened its eyes wide in wakefulness.
 It stared around it ...
 (Neil Gaiman, &quot;The Graveyard Book&quot; (2008), p. 25)

====For non-human animals====
The Quirk et al. 1985 grammar states that the use of gendered he or she is optional for non-human animals of known sex. It gives the following example, which illustrates the use of both the gender-neutral possessive its and the gendered possessive her to refer to a bird:

 (28) &quot;The robin builds its nest in a well-chosen position ...&quot;
 &quot;and, after the eggs have hatched, the mother bird feeds her young there for several weeks ...&quot;
 (Quirk et al., A comprehensive grammar of the English language (1985), p. 316–317, 342)

===&quot;One&quot; as a gender-neutral pronoun===
Another gender-neutral pronoun that can be used to refer to people is the impersonal pronoun &quot;one&quot;. This can be used in conjunction with the generic he according to the preference and style of the writer.
*&quot;Each student should save his questions until the end.&quot;
*&quot;One should save one&#x27;s questions until the end.&quot;
*&quot;One should save his questions until the end.&quot;
In everyday language, generic &quot;you&quot; is often used instead of &quot;one&quot;:
*&quot;You should save your questions until the end.&quot;

=== Historical, regional, and proposed gender-neutral singular pronouns ===
Historically, there were two gender-neutral pronouns native to English dialects, ou and &quot;(h)a&quot;. According to Dennis Baron&#x27;s &quot;Grammar and Gender&quot;:
Relics of these gender-neutral terms survive in some British dialects of Modern English — for example hoo for &#x27;she&#x27;, in Yorkshire — and sometimes a pronoun of one gender can be applied to a human or non-human animal of the opposite gender.

* hoo is also sometimes used in the West Midlands and south-west England as a common gender pronoun
* er can be used in place of either &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot; in some West Country dialects, although only in weak (unstressed) positions such as in tag questions
* hye could refer to either he or she in Essex in the south-east of England, in the Middle English period
* yo: a 2007 paper reports that in some schools in the city of Baltimore, &quot;yo&quot; has come to be used as a gender-neutral pronoun.

Since at least the 19th century, numerous proposals for the use of other non-standard gender-neutral pronouns have been introduced:

* e, (&quot;es&quot;, &quot;em&quot;) is the oldest recorded English gender-neutral (ungendered) pronoun with declension, coined by Francis Augustus Brewster in 1841. &quot;E&quot;, &quot;es&quot;, &quot;em&quot;, and &quot;emself&quot; were also proposed by James Rogers in 1890. The aim was to provide a neutral, ungendered pronoun because the link of pronouns to sex was considered a major flaw. Donald G. MacKay (1980) experimented with the use of &quot;e&quot;, &quot;es&quot;, &quot;em&quot;, and &quot;eself&quot;.
* thon, proposed by Charles Crozat Converse in 1884 — other sources date its coinage to 1858 — received the greatest mainstream acceptance. A contraction of &#x27;that one&#x27;, thon was listed in &quot;Funk and Wagnall&#x27;s Standard Dictionary&quot; from 1898 through to 1964, and was also included in &quot;Webster&#x27;s Second New International Dictionary&quot; (but not in its the first and third editions).
* co was coined by the feminist writer Mary Orovan in 1970. It is in common usage in intentional communities of the Federation of Egalitarian Communities, appearing in the bylaws of several of these communities. In addition to using co when the gender of the antecedent is unknown or indeterminate, some use co as gender-blind language, where co replaces gendered pronouns.
* ze has several variants (see table below) and is used to meet the needs of unspecified gender situations and transgender persons. Kate Bornstein, an American transgender author, uses the pronoun forms ze and hir in the 1996 book &quot;Nearly Roadkill: An Infobahn Erotic Adventure&quot;. Jeffrey A. Carver, an American science fiction writer, uses the pronoun hir in the 1989 novel &quot;From a Changeling Star&quot; for a different-gendered nonhuman.

===Table of standard and non-standard third-person singular pronouns===


== Emergence of gender-neutral pronouns in languages with grammatical gender ==
=== French &quot;iel&quot; ===

In 2021, the dictionary Le Petit Robert de la Langue Française added a third-person gender neutral pronoun to its lexicon: (plural ). Although &quot;Petit Robert&quot; has added , there is no discussion in its entry regarding how the language, which uses a grammatical gender system in which every content word has a gender, should proceed with agreement.

As reported in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, this merger of the third person masculine pronoun il &#x27;he&#x27; and the third person feminine pronoun elle &#x27;she&#x27; is used to refer to a person of any gender. It has caused controversy amongst both linguists and politicians who claim that the French language cannot be manipulated. The dictionary takes the position that it is observing how the French language evolves, adding it as a point of reference. However, the Larousse (a prominent encyclopedia of the French language) disagrees, calling iel a &quot;pseudo pronoun&quot;.

=== Polish &quot;onu&quot; and &quot;ono&quot; ===

The Polish language does not have officially recognized and standardized gender-neutral pronoun. The most popular neopronoun, created to address nonbinary people, is . It was originally created by science fiction and fantasy writer Jacek Dukaj, for his 2004 book &quot;Perfect Imperfection&quot;. From the surname of the author, this, and similar neopronouns created by him, are referred to as , and after term coined by him, the post-gender pronouns (Polish: &quot;zaimki postpłciowe&quot;).

Some nonbinary Polish-speakers also use , which corresponds to the English &quot;it&quot;. The use of as a gender-neutral pronoun was recommended in a grammar book in 1823.


===Swedish &quot;hen&quot;===

The Swedish language has a four-gender distinction for definite singular third-person pronouns:

* masculine singular &quot;han&quot; &#x27;he&#x27;
* feminine singular &quot;hon&quot; &#x27;she&#x27;
* common singular &quot;den&quot; &#x27;it&#x27;
* neuter singular &quot;det&quot; &#x27;it&#x27;

The indefinite/impersonal third person is gender-neutral, as is the plural third person:

* plural third person &quot;de&quot; &#x27;they&#x27;
* &quot;man&quot; &#x27;someone&#x27;

As for first-person and second-person pronouns, they are gender-neutral in both the singular and plural

* first person: singular &quot;jag&quot;; plural &quot;vi&quot;
* second-person: singular &quot;du&quot;; plural &quot;ni&quot;

On nouns, the neuter gender is marked by the definite singular suffixal article -t, whereas common gender is marked with the suffix with -n. The same distinction applies to the indefinite adjectival singular forms. For people and animals with specified gender, the masculine or feminine pronouns are used, but the nouns still take either neutral or common articles. There is no gender distinction in the plural.

In Swedish, the word &quot;hen&quot; was introduced generally in the 2000s as a complement to the gender-specific &quot;hon&quot; (&quot;she&quot;) and &quot;han&quot; (&quot;he&quot;). It can be used when the gender of a person is not known or when it is not desirable to specify them as either a &quot;she&quot; or &quot;he&quot;. The word was proposed by Rolf Dunås in 1966 and could be used occasionally, like in a guideline from the Swedish building council from 1980, authored by Rolf Reimers. Its origin may have been a combination of &quot;han&quot; and &quot;hon&quot;.

It was proposed again in 1994, with reference to the Finnish &quot;hän&quot;, similarly pronounced, a personal pronoun that is gender-neutral, since Finnish completely lacks grammatical gender. In 2009 it was included in Nationalencyklopedin. However, it did not receive widespread recognition until around 2010, when it began to be used in some texts, and provoked some media debates and controversy, but is included since 2015 in &quot;Svenska Akademiens ordlista&quot;, the most authoritative spelling dictionary of the Swedish language, by the Swedish Academy.

, Swedish manuals of style treat &quot;hen&quot; as a neologism. Major newspapers like &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; have recommended against its usage, though some journalists still use it. The Swedish Language Council has not issued any general recommendations against the use of &quot;hen&quot;, but advises against the use of the object form &quot;henom&quot; (&quot;her/him&quot;); it instead recommends using &quot;hen&quot; as both the subject and object form. &quot;Hen&quot; has two basic usages: as a way to avoid a stated preference to either gender; or as a way of referring to individuals who are transgender, who prefer to identify themselves as belonging to a third gender or who reject the division of male/female gender roles on ideological grounds. Its entry will cover two definitions: as a reference to an individual&#x27;s belonging to a third gender, or where the sex is not specified.

Traditionally, Swedish offers other ways of avoiding using gender-specific pronouns; e.g., &quot;vederbörande&quot; (&quot;the referred person&quot;) and &quot;man&quot; (&quot;one&quot;, as in &quot;Man borde ...&quot;/&quot;One should ...&quot;) with its objective form &quot;en&quot; or alternatively &quot;en&quot; as both subjective and objective since &quot;man&quot;/&quot;one&quot; sounds the same as &quot;man&quot;/&quot;male adult&quot; although they are discernible through syntax. &quot;Denna/Denne&quot; (&quot;this one or she/he&quot;) may refer to a non-gender-specific referent already or soon-to-be mentioned (&quot;Vederbörande kan, om denne så vill, ...&quot;/&quot;The referent may, if he wishes, ...&quot;). Because &quot;denne&quot; is objectively masculine, the use of the word to refer to anyone irrespective of gender is not recommended. One method is rewriting into the plural, as Swedish – like English – has only gender-neutral pronouns in the plural. Another method is writing the pronoun in the referent&#x27;s grammatical gender (&quot;Barnet får om &quot;det&quot; vill.&quot;/&quot;The child is allowed to, if &quot;it&quot; wants to.&quot; The word &quot;barn&quot;/child is grammatically neuter, thus the use of the third-person neuter pronoun &quot;det&quot;); some nouns retain their traditional pronouns, e.g., &quot;man&quot;/&quot;man&quot; uses &quot;han&quot;/&quot;he&quot;, and &quot;kvinna&quot;/&quot;woman&quot; uses &quot;hon&quot;/&quot;she&quot;. While grammatically correct, using &quot;den/det&quot; to refer to human beings may sound as if the speaker regards the referenced human beings as objects, so &quot;han&quot;/&quot;hon&quot; is preferred, for example about children or work titles such as &quot;föraren&quot; (&quot;driver&quot;) or &quot;rörmokaren&quot; (&quot;plumber&quot;).

=== Norwegian &quot;hen&quot;===

As a continuation of earlier discussions along the same lines as well as the continuing uptake, the Language Council of Norway proposes the gender-neutral pronoun (from Swedish ; compare Finnish ) to be recognised officially.

Previously, the gender-neutral pronoun has been proposed to fill the gap between the third person pronouns (&#x27;she&#x27;) and (&#x27;he&#x27;). However, the usage of has not widely embraced, as it is rarely used, and even then only by limited special interest groups. A reason for the marginal interest in a neuter gender word is the constructed nature of the word, together with the fact that the word is homonymous with several older words both in official language and dialectal speech, such as (&#x27;the other&#x27;) and (&#x27;beyond&#x27;). One can also use or or ( means &#x27;one&#x27;). These three are considered impersonal.

Amongst LGBT interest groups the word &quot;hen&quot; is now in use after the Swedish implementation in 2010.

==Emergence of gendered pronouns in languages without grammatical gender==

===Mandarin===
==== Lack of gender contrasts in spoken language ====
Traditionally, the third person pronoun in Mandarin is gender-neutral. In spoken standard Mandarin, there is no gender distinction in personal pronouns: can mean &#x27;he&#x27; or &#x27;she&#x27; (or even &#x27;it&#x27; for non-human objects). Although it is claimed that when the antecedent of the spoken pronoun is unclear, native speakers assume it is a male person, no evidence is given to support this claim. Many studies instead demonstrate the opposite: Mandarin speakers do not differentiate pronoun genders in the composition of the preverbal message that guides grammatical encoding during language production. Even proficient bilingual Mandarin-English learners do not process gender information in the conceptualizer. As a result, Mandarin speakers often mix up the gendered pronouns of European languages in speech. Even if they seldom make other types of errors, native Mandarin speakers can make such pronoun errors when speaking in English. This is even the case after they have been living in an immersive environment and after having attained a relatively high English level.

==== Emergence of gender contrasts via orthography ====
Although spoken Mandarin remains ungendered, a specific written form for &#x27;she&#x27; ( ) was created in the early twentieth century under the influence of European languages. In today&#x27;s written Chinese, the same sound is written with different characters: () for &#x27;he&#x27;, () for &#x27;she&#x27; and () for &#x27;it&#x27;. However, such distinction did not exist before the late 1910s. There was only () as a general third person pronoun (he/she/it&#x27;), which did not specify gender or humanness.

In 1917, the influential poet and linguist Liu Bannong borrowed the Old Chinese graph (, with the radical which means &#x27;female&#x27;) into the written language to specifically represent &#x27;she&#x27;. As a result, the old character (), which previously could also refer to females, has become sometimes restricted to meaning &#x27;he&#x27; only in written texts. The character has the radical () with means &#x27;human&#x27;, which also shows it originally was a generic term for people in general instead of a term for males, which should take the radical for male, (), like other Chinese characters that represent specifically male concepts.

The creation of gendered pronouns in Chinese orthography was part of the May Fourth Movement to modernize Chinese culture, and specifically an attempt to assert sameness between Chinese and European languages, which generally have gendered pronouns. The leaders of the movement also coined other characters, such as for objects, (radical: , &quot;cow&quot;) for animals, and (radical: , &#x27;spirit&#x27;) for gods. Their pronunciations were all . The latter two have fallen out of use in mainland China.

Liu and other writers of that period tried to popularize a different pronunciation for the feminine pronoun, including from the Wu dialect and from a literary reading, but these efforts failed, and all forms of the third-person pronoun retain identical pronunciation. (This situation of identical pronunciation with split characters is present not only in Mandarin but also in many other varieties of Chinese.)

The Cantonese third-person-singular pronoun is (), and may refer to people of any gender. For a specifically female pronoun, some writers replace the person radical () with the female radical (), forming the character (). However, this analogous variation to is neither widely accepted in standard written Cantonese nor grammatically or semantically required. Moreover, while the character () has no meaning in classical Chinese, the character () has a separate meaning unrelated to its dialectic use in standard or classical Chinese.

As of 2013, there is a recent trend on the Internet for people to write &quot;TA&quot; in Latin script, derived from the pinyin romanization of Chinese, as a gender-neutral pronoun.

For second-person pronouns, is used for both genders. In addition, the character has sometimes been used as a female second-person pronoun in Taiwan and Hong Kong.

===Japanese===
==== Emergence of gendered third-person forms ====
Pure personal pronouns do not exist in traditional Japanese, as pronouns are generally dropped. In addition, reference to a person is using their name with a suffix such as the gender-neutral added to it. For example:

&#x27;She (Ms. Saitō) came&#x27; would be ().

In modern Japanese, () is the male and () the female third-person pronouns. Historically, was a word in the demonstrative paradigm (i.e., a system involving demonstrative prefixes, , , (historical: ), and ), used to point to an object that is physically far but psychologically near. The feminine counterpart , on the other hand, is a combination of (adnominal () version of ) and (&#x27;woman&#x27;), coined for the translation of its Western equivalents. It was not until the Meiji period that and were commonly used as the masculine and feminine pronoun in the same way as their Western equivalents. Although their usage as the Western equivalent pronouns tends to be infrequent—because pronouns tend to be dropped— and are commonly used today to mean &#x27;boyfriend&#x27; and &#x27;girlfriend&#x27; respectively.

==== Emergence of gendered first-person forms ====
First-person pronouns, , , and , while not explicitly carrying gender, can strongly imply gender based on inherent levels of politeness or formality as well as hierarchical connotations. While and are traditionally characterized as masculine pronouns, is characterized as feminine. In addition, of the two masculine-leaning pronouns, is considered to be less masculine than and often connote a softer form of masculinity. When wishing to connote a sense of authority and confidence to their interlocutors, male speakers tend to use the first-person form .

<text>A ticker symbol or stock symbol is an abbreviation used to uniquely identify publicly traded shares of a particular stock or security on a particular stock exchange. Ticker symbols are arrangements of symbols or characters (generally Latin letters or digits) which provide a shorthand for investors to refer to, purchase, and research securities. Some exchanges include ticker extensions, which encode additional information such as share class, bankruptcy status, or voting rights into the ticker. 

The first ticker symbol was used in 1867, following the invention of the ticker tape machine by Edward Calahan. It was used to identify shares of the Union Pacific Railroad Company.

==Interpreting the symbol==
Stock symbols are unique identifiers assigned to each security traded on a particular market. A stock symbol can consist of letters, numbers, or a combination of both, and is a way to uniquely identify that stock. The symbols were kept as short as possible to reduce the number of characters that had to be printed on the ticker tape, and to make it easy to recognize by traders and investors.

The allocation of symbols and formatting conventions is specific to each stock exchange. In the US, for example, stock tickers are typically between 1 and 4 letters and represent the company name where possible. For example, US-based computer company stock Apple Inc. traded on the NASDAQ exchange has the symbol AAPL, while the motor company Ford&#x27;s stock that is traded on the New York Stock Exchange has the single-letter ticker F. In Europe, most exchanges use three-letter codes; for example, Dutch consumer goods company Unilever traded on the Amsterdam Euronext exchange has the symbol UNA. In Asia, numbers are often used as stock tickers to avoid issues for international investors when using non-Latin scripts. For example, the bank HSBC&#x27;s stock traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange has the ticker symbol 0005.

Symbols sometimes change to reflect mergers. Prior to the 1999 merger with Mobil Oil, Exxon used a phonetic spelling of the company &quot;XON&quot; as its ticker symbol. The symbol of the firm after the merger was &quot;XOM&quot;. Symbols are sometimes reused. In the US the single-letter symbols are particularly sought after as vanity symbols. For example, since March 2008 Visa Inc. has used the symbol V that had previously been used by Vivendi which had delisted and given up the symbol.

To fully qualify a stock, both the ticker and the exchange or country of listing needs to be known. On many systems both must be specified to uniquely identify the security. This is often done by appending the location or exchange code to the ticker.

=== Other identifiers ===
Although stock tickers identify a security, they are exchange dependent, generally limited to stocks, and can change. These limitations have led to the development of other codes in financial markets to identify securities for settlement purposes. The most prevalent of these is the International Securities Identifying Number (ISIN). An ISIN uniquely identifies a security and its structure is defined in ISO 6166. Securities for which ISINs are issued include bonds, commercial paper, stocks, and warrants. The ISIN code is a 12-character alpha-numerical code that does not contain information characterizing financial instruments, but serves for uniform identification of a security at trading and settlement.

The ISIN identifies the security, not the exchange (if any) on which it trades; it is, therefore, not a replacement for the ticker symbol. For instance, Daimler AG stock trades on twenty-two different stock exchanges worldwide and is priced in five foreign currencies; it has the same ISIN on each (DE0007100000), though not the same ticker symbol. ISIN cannot specify a particular trade in this case, and another identifier, typically the three- or four-letter exchange code (such as the Market Identifier Code), will have to be specified in addition to the ISIN.

===Symbol for stock market indices===
While usually a stock ticker identifies a security that can be traded, stock market indices are also sometimes assigned a symbol, even though they can generally not be traded. Symbols for indices are usually distinguished by adding a symbol in front of the name, such as a circumflex (or &#x27;caret&#x27;) or a dot. For example, Reuters lists the Nasdaq Composite index under the symbol &quot;.IXIC&quot;.

==Symbols by country==

=== Australia ===

In Australia the Australian Securities Exchange uses the following conventions:
Three character base symbol with the first and third character being alphanumeric and the second alphabetic. ETFs and ETMFs can be either 3 or 4 characters. Exchange-traded warrants and exchange-traded options are six characters. ETOs can have numbers in the sixth character.

=== Canada ===
In Canada the Toronto Stock Exchange TSX and the TSXV use the following special codes after the ticker symbol:

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, prior to 1996, stock codes were known as EPICs, named after the London Stock Exchange&#x27;s Exchange Price Information Computer (e.g.: &quot;MKS&quot; for Marks and Spencer). Following the introduction of the Sequence trading platform in 1996, EPICs were renamed Tradable Instrument Display Mnemonics (TIDM), but they are still widely referred to as EPICs. Stocks can also be identified using their SEDOL (Stock Exchange Daily Official List) number or their ISIN (International Securities Identification Number).

===United States===
In the United States, modern letter-only ticker symbols were developed by Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s (S&amp;P) to bring a national standard to investing. Previously, a single company could have many ticker symbols as they varied between the dozens of individual stock markets. The term &quot;ticker&quot; refers to the noise made by the ticker tape machines once widely used by stock exchanges.

The S&amp;P system was later standardized by the securities industry and modified as the years passed. Stock symbols for preferred stock have not been standardized.

Some companies use a well-known product as their ticker symbol. Belgian brewer AB InBev, the brewer of Budweiser beer, uses &quot;BUD&quot; (symbolizing its premier product in the United States) as its three-letter ticker for American Depository Receipts. Its rival, the Molson Coors Brewing Company, uses a similarly beer-related symbol, &quot;TAP&quot;. Likewise, Southwest Airlines pays tribute to its headquarters at Love Field in Dallas through its &quot;LUV&quot; symbol. Cedar Fair Entertainment Company, which operates large amusement parks in the United States, uses &quot;FUN&quot; as its symbol. Harley-Davidson uses &quot;HOG&quot;, an abbreviation for the corporate-sponsored Harley Owners Group. Yamana Gold uses &quot;AUY&quot;, because on the periodic table of elements, &quot;Au&quot; is the symbol for gold. Sotheby&#x27;s, an auction house, previously used the symbol &quot;BID&quot;. Petco uses the symbol &quot;WOOF&quot;. 

While most symbols come from the company&#x27;s name, sometimes it happens the other way around. Tricon Global, owner of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, adopted the symbol &quot;YUM&quot; to represent its corporate mission when the company was spun out of PepsiCo in 1997. In 2002, the company changed its name to match its symbol, adopting the name Yum! Brands.

Symbols sometimes change to reflect mergers. Before the 1999 merger with Mobil, Exxon used a phonetic spelling of the company &quot;XON&quot; as its ticker symbol. The symbol of the firm after the merger was &quot;XOM&quot;. After Hewlett-Packard merged with Compaq, the new firm took on the ticker symbol &quot;HPQ&quot;. (The former symbols were HWP and CPQ.) AT&amp;T&#x27;s ticker symbol is &quot;T&quot;; accordingly, the company is referred to simply as &quot;Telephone&quot; on Wall Street (the T symbol is so well known that when SBC purchased the company, it took the AT&amp;T name, capitalizing on its history and keeping the desired single letter symbol).

Some examples of US Stock symbols include:

* A – Agilent Technologies
* AAPL – Apple
* BRK.(A/B) - Berkshire Hathaway (Class A or B shares marked by a letter following period, BRK.A or BRK.B)
* C – Citigroup
* GOOG – Alphabet (parent company of Google)
* HOG – Harley-Davidson
* HPQ - Hewlett-Packard
* INTC – Intel
* KO – The Coca-Cola Company 
* LUV - Southwest Airlines (after their main hub at Love Field)
* MMM – 3M (originally known as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing)
* MSFT – Microsoft
* T - AT&amp;T
* TGT – Target Corporation
* TXN – Texas Instruments
* XOM - ExxonMobil
* WOOF - Petco
* WMT – Walmart

Formerly, a glance at a U.S. stock symbol and its appended codes would allow an investor to determine where a stock trades; however, in July 2007, the SEC approved a rule change allowing companies moving from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq to retain their three-letter symbols; DirecTV was one of the first companies to make this move. When first implemented, the rule change did not apply to companies with one or two-letter symbols, but subsequently any stock was able to move from the NYSE to the Nasdaq without changing its symbol. CA Technologies, which traded under the symbol CA before it was acquired in 2018, moved from the NYSE to the Nasdaq in April 2008 and kept its two-letter symbol.

===Other countries===
In countries where Arabic script is used, and in East Asia, transliterated Latin script versions of company names may be confusing to an unpracticed Western reader; stock symbols provide a simple means of clear communication in the workplace. Many Asian countries use numerical or alphanumerical ticker symbols of only digits and Roman letters to facilitate international trade.

<text>The Emirate of Ajman (; ) (Gulf Arabic: إمارة عيمان emāratʿymān) is one of the seven emirates of the United Arab Emirates. It joined the United Arab Emirates federation on December 2, 1971. It has an area of 259 square kilometers (100 sq mi), which makes it the smallest of the emirates in terms of area, while its population of approximately 504,846 in 2017 according to the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Center makes it the fourth most populous emirate in the country. It is named after the city of Ajman, which is its seat of government. The main landmass of the emirate is a semi-enclave, surrounded on the north, east, and south by the Emirate of Sharjah.

Located on the coast of the Persian Gulf, Ajman also controls two small inland exclaves: Manama and Masfout, both of which are primarily agricultural. Approximately 95% of the population of the emirate resides in the city of Ajman, which forms part of the Dubai-Sharjah-Ajman metropolitan area. Ajman is ruled by Sheikh Humaid bin Rashid Al Nuaimi III of the Na&#x27;im tribe. The Crown Prince of the emirate is Sheikh Ammar bin Humaid Al Nuaimi.

==Geography==

The Emirate of Ajman covers . 95% of the population lives in the city of Ajman.

=== Manama and Masfout ===
As well as the city of Ajman, the emirate encompasses two landlocked exclaves, Manama and Masfout. Manama is located 73 kilometers to the capital&#x27;s east, covering an area of 26 km2. Manama is in the plains at the foothills of the Hajjar Mountains some 60 km east of Ajman city. It also consists of a little, primarily agricultural oasis containing quarries and mines of magnesium and chromium. While Masfout is in the mountains proper, some 110 km southeast of Ajman City. It consists of a small town that provides essential services and valleys sustained by subsistence farming and marble quarrying.

The city and main territory of Ajman is bordered to the landward side by Sharjah, while Manama shares borders with Sharjah and Fujairah. Masfout borders Oman, Dubai (the village and exclave of Hatta) and Ras Al Khaimah. Both Manama and Masfout are fertile regions and support widespread agricultural development.

Most of the main emirate&#x27;s landmass is developed, with extensive suburbs stretching out almost to the E311 arterial road, with light industrial zones and warehousing towards the northeast. Ajman&#x27;s creek has been dredged and walled to form a port area and this is the location for the Ajman Port and the Ajman Free Zone. Ajman has a thriving textile industry and is home to some 15% of the UAE&#x27;s manufacturing firms.

The small areas of sandy desert outside the city support scant seasonal growths of wild grasses and scrub, ghaf trees and occasional date palms. Acacia and ghaf trees are to be found in abundance in Manama, which has long been established as an agricultural centre. Date palm groves and fruit tree plantations are characteristic of Masfout.

Ajman&#x27;s GDP was $4.23 billion in 2012, in which it had a positive trade balance with exports of $1.61 billion and imports of $600 million. Ajman grew by 5% as GDP increased from 15,690 million dirhams in 2012 to 16,441 million in 2013, according to the annual economic reports of Ajman 2013 and 2014.

Ajman&#x27;s economy is dominated by five sectors: manufacturing; construction; wholesale and retail; real estate and business services; and transport, storage and communications. In 2012, these sectors contributed some 82% of total GDP, with manufacturing (37%) and construction (15%) the two largest contributors. The three largest growth sectors in Ajman from 2010 to 2012 were social and personal services, which grew 6.4%, transport, storage and communication, which grew 5.1% and manufacturing, which grew 5%.

In 2013, the relative share of manufacturing activity formed 35% of GDP. The construction sector constituted 15%, including general contracting and maintenance, construction, and civil construction such as roads, bridges, and water systems. The relative contribution of the wholesale, retail trade, and repair services sector, which includes the resale of new and used goods, repair, and maintenance, reached about 13% of the value of GDP in the same year.

The fastest-growing trades in the manufacturing sector from 2009 to 2011 were carpentry and paper products, printing and publishing. Overall, the manufacturing sector in Ajman grew 16.3% over this period. The re-exporting of chemicals and plastic products clocked over 100% growth in this same time period.

Major export markets from 2009 to 2011 were represented by the GCC countries (31%) and Asia (27%), while Africa and Asia were the fastest growing export markets over this period. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Iran were the Ajman&#x27;s principal export trade partners.

Investments in Ajman grew in 2013 by 5% compared to 2012. Exports (including re-export) grew in the second quarter of 2014 by 53%.

=== Ajman Free Zone (AFZA) ===
Established in 1988 to lead the industrial development of the emirate by attracting various companies and offering different privileges. Ajman Port and Ajman Free Zone are major contributors to the emirate&#x27;s economy. Exporting to over 65 countries, the Free Zone has some 256 industrial companies and more than 12,000 companies operated in it.

The business activity in Ajman Free Zone grew at an annual growth rate of about 23%, while the licenses issued grew from 1590 in 2009 to 2386 in 2011. The number of issued licenses by Ajman Municipality increased from 17,873 in 2009 to 21,799 in 2011 at an annual average rate of 10.4%.

The renewed licenses in Ajman Free Zone increased by 33% in 2014 compared to 2013, while the new licenses issued in the same period achieved an increase of 70%.

===Real estate===
Ajman was the first emirate in the UAE to offer 100% freehold to global investors, in 2004. This led to real estate prices rising rapidly, from $11 per square foot and, by 2007, developers had announced projects worth $21.78 billion, consisting of around 65,000 units in all. In an emirate with a population that used to be 240,000 the figure was high by any standard and the pace of development was not sustainable, with the global financial crisis intervening to bring development to a sharp halt. With considerable pain from investors in stalled projects, the Ajman Real Estate Regulatory Agency came under considerable pressure.

By 2011, work was continued on a number of projects, including the mixed business, leisure and residential development Ajman One.

===Recent developments===

A development boom followed the opening of Ajman&#x27;s real estate market to global investors in 2004, with &#x27;true&#x27; freehold on offer. By 2008 the growth of real estate speculation and investment had led to the establishment of a real estate regulator, the Ajman Real Estate Regulatory Agency. Arguably ineffective in the face of the fast-moving and evolutionary gold rush taking place, ARERA had not implemented widespread policies or regulations to curb the overheating market by the time the global financial crisis intervened and brought many developments to a crashing halt. As of 2014, a number of key stalled projects had restarted, marking a more cautious and measured return to the development of the emirate&#x27;s real estate market, which has recently benefited from offering competitive rentals to nearby Sharjah and Dubai.

The construction of Ajman International Airport began in the second half of 2008 after rescheduling the plan in 2003 in the Al Manama area of Ajman. Airport operations were scheduled to begin by 2011, and the airport was expected to host about 1 million passengers a year, rising to 10.4 million by 2046. The project stalled but has now been restarted and was projected to be completed by 2018 and will entail an investment of some $575m. However, it was put on hold till early 2020.

In 2007, the Ajman Marina project was launched by the Tanmiyat Group. The $3 billion was being constructed in two phases over the following five years. The project includes running tracks and facilities to attract international sporting events and provide a draw for tourism to the emirate.

==Places of interest==

Ajman Fort was formerly the residence of the Ruler of Ajman but turned over to Ajman Police as their barracks in 1967. It was subsequently converted into a museum and housed an eclectic collection of artifacts and exhibitions of traditional life in Ajman.

The Red Fort was built during Sheikh Humaid bin Abdul Aziz Al Nuaimi (1910–1928), and consists of four rooms in two towers. The fort was restored in 1986 and a third tower was added to the two older towers. Gravel and red plaster were used in the construction of the walls of the fort and hence it was named the Red Fort. Sandalwood was used in the beams and supports for the construction of the roofs.

Manama museum, opened on 2 December 2012, is located in Al Mareer Fort, which was originally built during the reign of Sheikh Rashid bin Humaid Al Nuaimi (1873 – 1891). A yard overlooks seven rooms and a well. The fort is surrounded by palm trees irrigated by the old Manama Falaj.

Located on the Ajman Corniche, the square Al Murabaa Watchtower was built in the 1930s.

Ajman&#x27;s busy corniche is a popular evening and weekend destination for families and features a number of fast food outlets, coffee shops and stalls, hotels and other establishments.

==Education==

It is the principal higher education institution in Ajman, with colleges offering specializations in engineering, information technology, dentistry, mass communication, pharmacy and health sciences, business administration, environment, water and energy, education and law. Consisting of two clusters, J1 (25 lecture halls and 23 laboratories) and J2 (56 lecture halls and 56 laboratories), the university includes a teaching hospital for both dental and medical specializations.

The Gulf Medical University (GMU), previously Gulf Medical College, was established in 1998 as a leading medical university in the Gulf region and was awarded university status in July 2008 after an order issued by Sheikh Nahyan Bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research.

<text>In linguistics, a neologism (; also known as a coinage) is any newly formed word, term, or phrase that has achieved popular or institutional recognition and is becoming accepted into mainstream language. Most definitively, a word can be considered a neologism once it is published in a dictionary.

Neologisms are one facet of lexical innovation, i.e., the linguistic process of new terms and meanings entering a language&#x27;s lexicon. The most precise studies into language change and word formation, in fact, identify the process of a &quot;neological continuum&quot;: a &quot;nonce word&quot; is any single-use term that may or may not grow in popularity; a &quot;protologism&quot; is such a term used exclusively within a small group; a &quot;prelogism&quot; is such a term that is gaining usage but still not mainstream; and a &quot;neologism&quot; has become accepted or recognized by social institutions.

Neologisms are often driven by changes in culture and technology. Popular examples of neologisms can be found in science, technology, fiction (notably science fiction), films and television, commercial branding, literature, jargon, cant, linguistics, the visual arts, and popular culture.

Examples of words that were 20th-century neologisms include &quot;laser&quot; (1960), an acronym of &quot;light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation&quot;; &quot;robot&quot; (1921) from Czech writer Karel Čapek&#x27;s play &quot;R.U.R. (Rossum&#x27;s Universal Robots)&quot;; and &quot;agitprop&quot; (1930; a portmanteau of Russian &quot;agitatsiya&quot; (agitation) and &quot;propaganda&quot;).

==Background==

Neologisms are often formed by combining existing words (see compound noun and adjective) or by giving words new and unique suffixes or prefixes. Neologisms can also be formed by blending words, for example, &quot;brunch&quot; is a blend of the words &quot;breakfast&quot; and &quot;lunch&quot;, or through abbreviation or acronym, by intentionally rhyming with existing words or simply through playing with sounds. A relatively rare form of neologism is when proper names are used as words (e.g., boycott, from Charles Boycott), including , dick, Chad, and Karen.

Neologisms can become popular through memetics, through mass media, the Internet, and word of mouth, including academic discourse in many fields renowned for their use of distinctive jargon, and often become accepted parts of the language. Other times, they disappear from common use just as readily as they appeared. Whether a neologism continues as part of the language depends on many factors, probably the most important of which is acceptance by the public. It is unusual for a word to gain popularity if it does not clearly resemble other words. 

==History and meaning==
The term &quot;neologism&quot; is first attested in English in 1772, borrowed from French &quot;néologisme&quot; (1734). The French word derives from Greek νέο- &quot;néo&quot;(=&quot;new&quot;) and λόγος /&quot;lógos&quot;, meaning &quot;speech, utterance&quot;. In an academic sense, there is no professional neologist, because the study of such things (cultural or ethnic vernacular, for example) is interdisciplinary. Anyone such as a lexicographer or an etymologist might study neologisms, how their uses span the scope of human expression, and how, due to science and technology, they spread more rapidly than ever before in the present times.

The term &quot;neologism&quot; has a broader meaning which also includes &quot;a word which has gained a new meaning&quot;. Sometimes, the latter process is called &quot;semantic shifting&quot;, or &quot;semantic extension&quot;. Neologisms are distinct from a person&#x27;s &quot;idiolect&quot;, one&#x27;s unique patterns of vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation.

Neologisms are usually introduced when it is found that a specific notion is lacking a term, or when the existing vocabulary lacks detail, or when a speaker is unaware of the existing vocabulary. The law, governmental bodies, and technology have a relatively high frequency of acquiring neologisms. Another trigger that motivates the coining of a neologism is to disambiguate a term which may be unclear due to having many meanings.

==Literature==

Neologisms may come from a word used in the narrative of fiction such as novels and short stories. Examples include &quot;grok&quot; (to intuitively understand) from the science fiction novel about a Martian entitled &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; by Robert A. Heinlein; &quot;McJob&quot; (precarious, poorly-paid employment) from &quot;Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture&quot; by Douglas Coupland; &quot;cyberspace&quot; (widespread, interconnected digital technology) from &quot;Neuromancer&quot; by William Gibson and &quot;quark&quot; (Slavic slang for &quot;rubbish&quot;; German for a type of dairy product) from James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;.

The title of a book may become a neologism, for instance, &quot;Catch-22&quot; (from the title of Joseph Heller&#x27;s novel). Alternatively, the author&#x27;s name may give rise to the neologism, although the term is sometimes based on only one work of that author. This includes such words as &quot;Orwellian&quot; (from George Orwell, referring to his dystopian novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;) and &quot;Kafkaesque&quot; (from Franz Kafka).

Names of famous characters are another source of literary neologisms. Some examples include: &quot;Quixotic&quot;, referring to a misguided romantic quest like that of the title character in &quot;Don Quixote&quot; by Miguel de Cervantes; &quot;Scrooge&quot;, a pejorative for misers based on the avaricious main character in Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;; and &quot;Pollyanna&quot;, referring to people who are unfailingly optimistic like the title character of Eleanor H. Porter&#x27;s &quot;Pollyanna&quot;.

=== Scientific literature ===
Neologisms are often introduced in technical writing, so-called &quot;Fachtexte&quot; or &#x27;technical texts&#x27; through the process of lexical innovation. Technical subjects such as philosophy, sociology, physics, etc. are especially rich in neologisms. In philosophy, as an example, many terms became introduced into languages through processes of translation, e.g., from Ancient Greek to Latin, or from Latin to German or English, and so on. So Plato introduced the Greek term ποιότης (&quot;poiotēs&quot;), which Cicero rendered with Latin &quot;qualitas&quot;, which subsequently became our notion of &#x27;quality&#x27; in relation to epistemology, e.g., a quality or attribute of a perceived object, as opposed to its essence. In physics, new terms were introduced sometimes via nonce formation (e.g., Murray Gell-Man&#x27;s &quot;quark&quot;, taken from James Joyce) or through derivation (e.g. John von Neumann&#x27;s &quot;kiloton&quot;, coined by combining the common prefix &quot;kilo-&quot; &#x27;thousand&#x27; with the noun &quot;ton&quot;). Neologisms therefore are a vital component of scientific jargon or &quot;termini technici&quot;.

==Cant==
Polari is a cant used by some actors, circus performers, and the gay subculture to communicate without outsiders understanding. Some Polari terms have crossed over into mainstream slang, in part through their usage in pop song lyrics and other works. Example include: &quot;acdc&quot;, &quot;barney&quot;, &quot;blag&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;camp&quot;, &quot;khazi&quot;, &quot;cottaging&quot;, &quot;hoofer&quot;, &quot;mince&quot;, &quot;ogle&quot;, &quot;scarper&quot;, &quot;slap&quot;, &quot;strides&quot;, &quot;tod&quot;, &quot;[rough] trade&quot; (rough trade).

Verlan (), (&quot;verlan&quot; is the reverse of the expression &quot;l&#x27;envers&quot;) is a type of argot in the French language, featuring inversion of syllables in a word, and is common in slang and youth language. It rests on a long French tradition of transposing syllables of individual words to create slang words. Some &quot;verlan&quot; words, such as &quot;meuf&quot; (&quot;femme&quot;, which means &quot;woman&quot; roughly backwards), have become so commonplace that they have been included in the &quot;Petit Larousse&quot;. Like any slang, the purpose of &quot;verlan&quot; is to create a somewhat secret language that only its speakers can understand. Words becoming mainstream is counterproductive. As a result, such newly common words are re-verlanised: reversed a second time. The common &quot;meuf&quot; became &quot;feumeu&quot;.

== Popular culture ==
Neologism development may be spurred, or at least spread, by popular culture. Examples of pop-culture neologisms include the American alt-Right (2010s), the Canadian portmanteau &quot;Snowmageddon&quot; (2009), the Russian parody &quot;Monstration&quot; (), Santorum ().

Neologisms spread mainly through their exposure in mass media. The genericizing of brand names, such as &quot;coke&quot; for Coca-Cola, &quot;kleenex&quot; for Kleenex facial tissue, and &quot;xerox&quot; for Xerox photocopying, all spread through their popular use being enhanced by mass media.

However, in some limited cases, words break out of their original communities and spread through social media. &quot;DoggoLingo&quot;, a term still below the threshold of a neologism according to Merriam-Webster, is an example of the latter which has specifically spread primarily through Facebook group and Twitter account use. The suspected origin of this way of referring to dogs stems from a Facebook group founded in 2008 and gaining popularity in 2014 in Australia. In Australian English it is common to use diminutives, often ending in –o, which could be where doggo-lingo was first used. The term has grown so that Merriam-Webster has acknowledged its use but notes the term needs to be found in published, edited work for a longer period of time before it can be deemed a new word, making it the perfect example of a neologism.

== Translations ==

Because neologisms originate in one language, translations between languages can be difficult.

In the scientific community, where English is the predominant language for published research and studies, like-sounding translations (referred to as &#x27;naturalization&#x27;) are sometimes used. Alternatively, the English word is used along with a brief explanation of meaning.
The four translation methods are emphasized in order to translate neologisms: transliteration, transcription, the use of analogues, and loan translation.

When translating from English to other languages, the naturalization method is most often used. The most common way that professional translators translate neologisms is through the Think aloud protocol (TAP), wherein translators find the most appropriate and natural sounding word through speech. As such, translators can use potential translations in sentences and test them with different structures and syntax. Correct translations from English for specific purposes into other languages is crucial in various industries and legal systems. Inaccurate translations can lead to &#x27;translation asymmetry&#x27; or misunderstandings and miscommunication. Many technical glossaries of English translations exist to combat this issue in the medical, judicial, and technological fields.

== Other uses ==
In psychiatry and neuroscience, the term &quot;neologism&quot; is used to describe words that have meaning only to the person who uses them, independent of their common meaning. This can be seen in schizophrenia, where a person may replace a word with a nonsensical one of their own invention (e.g., &quot;I got so angry I picked up a dish and threw it at the gelsinger&quot;). The use of neologisms may also be due to aphasia acquired after brain damage resulting from a stroke or head injury.

<text>Ralph Hammond Innes (15 July 1913 – 10 June 1998) was a British novelist who wrote over 30 novels, as well as works for children and travel books.

==Biography==
Innes was born in Horsham, Sussex, and educated at Feltonfleet School, Cobham, Surrey, where he was head boy, and later at Cranbrook School in Kent. He left in 1931 to work as a journalist, initially with the &quot;Financial News&quot;. &quot;The Doppelganger&quot;, his first novel, was published in 1937. In WWII, he served in the Royal Artillery, eventually rising to the rank of Major. During the war, further books were published, including &quot;Wreckers Must Breathe&quot; (1940), &quot;The Trojan Horse&quot; (1940) and &quot;Attack Alarm&quot; (1941), the last of which was based on his experiences as an anti-aircraft gunner during the Battle of Britain at RAF Kenley. After being demobilized in 1946, he worked full-time as a writer, achieving multiple early successes. His novels are known for a fine attention to accurate detail in descriptions of places, such as in &quot;Air Bridge&quot; (1951), set partially at RAF Gatow, RAF Membury after its closure and RAF Wunstorf during the Berlin Airlift.

Innes produced books in a regular sequence, with six months of travel to settings all over the world and research followed by six months of writing. Many of his works featured events at sea and of metallurgy. His output decreased in the 1960s, but was still substantial. He became interested in ecological themes, as in &quot;High Stand&quot;, his &quot;tree&quot; novel. He continued writing until just before his death. His last novel was &quot;Delta Connection&quot; (1996).

Unusually for the thriller genre, Innes&#x27; protagonists were often not &quot;heroes&quot; in the typical sense, but ordinary men suddenly thrust into extreme situations by circumstance. Often, this involved being placed in a hostile environment (the Arctic, the open sea, deserts), or unwittingly becoming involved in a larger conflict or conspiracy. The protagonist generally is forced to rely on his own wits and making best use of limited resources, rather than the weapons and gadgetry commonly used by thriller writers.

Four of his early novels were adapted into films: &quot;Snowbound&quot; (1948) from &quot;The Lonely Skier&quot; (1947), &quot;Hell Below Zero&quot; (1954) from &quot;The White South&quot; (1949), &quot;Campbell&#x27;s Kingdom&quot; (1957) from the book of the same name (1952), and &quot;The Wreck of the Mary Deare&quot; (1959) also from the book of the same name (1956). His 1973 novel &quot;Golden Soak&quot; was adapted into a six-part television series in 1979. It was partly filmed in Nullagine, Western Australia. An audio adaptation of &quot;The Doomed Oasis&quot; was repeated on the UK digital radio station BBC Radio 7 (now called BBC Radio 4 Extra).

In 1937, he married actress Dorothy Mary Lang, who died in 1989. Innes&#x27;s great love and experience of the sea as a yachtsman, was reflected in many of his novels. Hammond and his wife both travelled in and raced their yachts &quot;Triune of Troy&quot; and &quot;Mary Deare&quot;. They lived together in Suffolk for many years, in the village of Kersey. After their deaths, they left the bulk of their estate and all of their Public Lending Rights to the Association of Sea Training Organisations, to enable young people to gain training and experience in sailing the element they both loved.

In 1978, Hammond Innes was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his services to literature.

<text>Invisibility is the state of an object that cannot be seen. An object in this state is said to be &quot;invisible&quot; (literally, &quot;not visible&quot;). The phenomenon is studied by physics and perceptual psychology.

Since objects can be seen by light from a source reflecting off their surfaces and hitting the viewer&#x27;s eyes, the most natural form of invisibility (whether real or fictional) is an object that neither reflects nor absorbs light (that is, it allows light to pass through it). This is known as 
transparency, and is seen in many naturally occurring materials (although no naturally occurring material is 100% transparent).

Invisibility perception depends on several optical and visual factors. For example, invisibility depends on the eyes of the observer and/or the instruments used. Thus an object can be classified as &quot;invisible&quot; to a person, animal, instrument, etc. In research on sensorial perception it has been shown that invisibility is perceived in cycles.

Invisibility is often considered to be the supreme form of camouflage, as it does not reveal to the viewer any kind of vital signs, visual effects, or any frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum detectable to the human eye, instead making use of radio, infrared or ultraviolet wavelengths.

In illusion optics, invisibility is a special case of illusion effects: the illusion of free space.

The term is often used in fantasy and science fiction, where objects cannot be seen by means of magic or hypothetical technology.

== Practical efforts ==
Technology can be used theoretically or practically to render real-world objects invisible.

Making use of a real-time image displayed on a wearable display, it is possible to create a see-through effect. This is known as active camouflage. Though stealth technology is declared to be invisible to radar, all officially disclosed applications of the technology can only &quot;reduce&quot; the size and/or clarity of the signature detected by radar.

In 2003 the Chilean scientist Gunther Uhlmann postulates the first mathematical equations to create invisible materials.
In 2006, a team effort of researchers from Britain and the US announced the development of a real cloak of invisibility, an artificially made meta material that is invisible to the microwave spectrum, though it is only in its first stages.

In filmmaking, people, objects, or backgrounds can be made to look invisible on camera through a process known as chroma keying. 

Engineers and scientists have performed various kinds of research to investigate the possibility of finding ways to create real optical invisibility (cloaks) for objects. Methods are typically based on implementing the theoretical techniques of transformation optics, which have given rise to several theories of cloaking.

Currently, a practical cloaking device does not exist. A 2006 theoretical work predicts that the imperfections are minor, and metamaterials may make real-life &quot;cloaking devices&quot; practical. The technique is predicted to be applied to radio waves within five years, and the distortion of visible light is an eventual possibility. The theory that light waves can be acted upon the same way as radio waves is now a popular idea among scientists. The agent can be compared to a stone in a river, around which water passes, but slightly down-stream leaves no trace of the stone. Comparing light waves to the water, and whatever object that is being &quot;cloaked&quot; to the stone, the goal is to have light waves pass around that object, leaving no visible aspects of it, possibly not even a shadow. This is the technique depicted in the 2000 television portrayal of The Invisible Man.

Two teams of scientists worked separately to create two &quot;Invisibility Cloaks&quot; from &#x27;metamaterials&#x27; engineered at the nanoscale level. They demonstrated for the first time the possibility of cloaking three-dimensional (3-D) objects with artificially engineered materials that redirect radar, light or other waves around an object. While one uses a type of fishnet of metal layers to reverse the direction of light, the other uses tiny silver wires. Xiang Zhang, of the University of California, Berkeley said: &quot;In the case of invisibility cloaks or shields, the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock. An observer looking at the cloaked object would then see light from behind it, making it seem to disappear.&quot;

UC Berkeley researcher Jason Valentine&#x27;s team made a material that affects light near the visible spectrum, in a region used in fibre optics: &#x27;Instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water, it would actually appear to be above the water&#x27;s surface. For a metamaterial to produce negative refraction, it must have a structural array smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation being used.&quot; Valentine&#x27;s team created their &#x27;fishnet&#x27; material by stacking silver and metal dielectric layers on top of each other and then punching holes through them. The other team used an oxide template and grew silver nanowires inside porous aluminum oxide at tiny distances apart, smaller than the wavelength of visible light. This material refracts visible light.

The Imperial College London research team achieved results with microwaves. An invisibility cloak layout of a copper cylinder was produced in May, 2008, by physicist Professor Sir John Pendry. Scientists working with him at Duke University in the US put the idea into practice.

Pendry, who theorized the invisibility cloak &quot;as a joke&quot; to illustrate the potential of metamaterials, said in an interview in August 2011 that grand, theatrical manifestations of his idea are probably overblown: &quot;I think it’s pretty sure that any cloak that Harry Potter would recognize is not on the table. You could dream up some theory, but the very practicality of making it would be so impossible. But can you hide things from light? Yes. Can you hide things which are a few centimeters across? Yes. Is the cloak really flexible and flappy? No. Will it ever be? No. So you can do quite a lot of things, but there are limitations. There are going to be some disappointed kids around, but there might be a few people in industry who are very grateful for it.&quot;

In Turkey in 2009, Bilkent University Search Center Of Nanotechnology researches explained and published in &quot;New Journal of Physics&quot; that they achieved to make invisibility real in practice using nanotechnology making an object invisible with no shadows etc. next to perfect transparent scene by producing nanotechnologic material that can also be produced like a suit anyone can wear.

In 2019, Hyperstealth Biotechnology has patented the technology behind a material that bends light to make people and objects near invisible to the naked eye. The material, called Quantum Stealth, is currently still in the prototyping stage, but was developed by the company&#x27;s CEO Guy Cramer primarily for military purposes, to conceal agents and equipment such as tanks and jets in the field. Unlike traditional camouflage materials, which are limited to specific conditions such as forests or deserts, according to Cramer this &quot;invisibility cloak&quot; works in any environment or season, at any time of day. This is despite its actual application requiring artificial backgrounds made up of horizontal lines.

== Psychological ==

A person can be described as invisible if others refuse to see them or routinely overlook them. The term was used in this manner in the title of the book &quot;Invisible Man&quot;, by Ralph Ellison, in reference to the protagonist, likely modeled after the author, being overlooked on account of his status as an African American. This is supported by the quote taken from the Prologue, &quot;I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me.&quot; (Prologue.1)

== Fictional use ==

In fiction, people or objects can be rendered completely invisible by several means:

* Magical objects such as rings, cloaks and amulets can be worn to grant the wearer permanent invisibility (or temporary invisibility until the object is taken off).
* Magical potions can be consumed to grant temporary or permanent invisibility.
* Magic spells can be cast on people or objects, usually giving temporary invisibility.
* Some mythical creatures can make themselves invisible at will, such as in some tales in which leprechauns or Chinese dragons can shrink so much that humans cannot see them.
* In science fiction, the idea of a &quot;cloaking device&quot;.

In some works, the power of magic creates an effective means of invisibility by distracting anyone who might notice the character. But since the character is not truly invisible, the effect could be betrayed by mirrors or other reflective surfaces.

Where magical invisibility is concerned, the issue may arise of whether the clothing worn by and any items carried by the invisible being are also rendered invisible. In general they are also regarded as being invisible, but in some instances clothing remains visible and must be removed for the full invisibility effect.
