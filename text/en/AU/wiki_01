<text>A toothbrush is a special type of brush used to clean the teeth, gums, and tongue. It consists of a head of tightly clustered bristles, atop of which toothpaste can be applied, mounted on a handle which facilitates the cleaning of hard-to-reach areas of the mouth. They should be used in conjunction with something to clean between the teeth where the bristles of the toothbrush cannot reach - for example floss, tape, interdental brushes or toothpicks.

They are available with different bristle textures, sizes, and forms. Most dentists recommend using a soft toothbrush since hard-bristled toothbrushes can damage tooth enamel and irritate the gums.

Because many common and effective ingredients in toothpaste are harmful if swallowed in large doses, tooth paste should instead be spat out. The act of brushing teeth is most often done at a sink within the kitchen or bathroom, where the brush may be rinsed off afterwards to remove any debris remaining and then dried to reduce conditions ideal for bacterial growth (and, if it is a wooden toothbrush, mold as well).

Some toothbrushes have plant-based handles, often bamboo. However, numerous others are made of cheap plastic; such brushes constitute a significant source of pollution. Over 1 billion toothbrushes are disposed of into landfills annually in the United States alone. Bristles are commonly made of nylon (which, while not biodegradable, as plastic is, may still be recycled), bamboo viscose, or bristle of boar.

==History==

===Precursors===
Before the invention of the toothbrush, a variety of oral hygiene measures had been used. This has been verified by excavations during which tree twigs, bird feathers, animal bones and porcupine quills were recovered.

The predecessor of the toothbrush is the chew stick. Chew sticks were twigs with frayed ends used to brush the teeth while the other end was used as a toothpick. The earliest chew sticks were discovered in Sumer in southern Mesopotamia in 3500 BC, an Egyptian tomb dating from 3000 BC, and mentioned in Chinese records dating from 1600 BC.

The Indian way of using tooth wood for brushing is presented by the Chinese Monk Yijing (635–713 CE) when he describes the rules for monks in his book:
&quot;Every day in the morning, a monk must chew a piece of tooth wood to brush his teeth and scrape his tongue, and this must be done in the proper way. Only after one has washed one&#x27;s hands and mouth may one make salutations. Otherwise both the saluter and the saluted are at fault. In Sanskrit, the tooth wood is known as the dantakastha—danta meaning tooth, and kastha, a piece of wood. It is twelve finger-widths in length. The shortest is not less than eight finger-widths long, resembling the little finger in size. Chew one end of the wood well for a long while and then brush the teeth with it.&quot;

The Greeks and Romans used toothpicks to clean their teeth, and toothpick-like twigs have been excavated in Qin dynasty tombs. Chew sticks remain common in Africa, the rural Southern United States, and in the Islamic world, the use of the chewing stick, miswak, is regarded as a pious action and is prescribed for use before every prayer, occurring five times a day. Miswaks have been used by Muslims since the 7th century. Twigs of Neem Tree have been used by ancient Indians. Neem, in its full bloom, can aid in healing by keeping the area clean and disinfected. In fact, even today, Neem twigs called &quot;datun&quot; are used for brushing teeth in India, although not hugely common.

===Toothbrush===
The first bristle toothbrush resembling the modern one was found in China. Used during the Tang dynasty (619–907), it consisted of hog bristles. The bristles were sourced from hogs living in Siberia and northern China because the colder temperatures provided firmer bristles. They were attached to a handle manufactured from bamboo or bone, forming a toothbrush. In 1223, Japanese Zen master Dōgen Kigen recorded in his &quot;Shōbōgenzō&quot; that he saw monks in China clean their teeth with brushes made of horsetail hairs attached to an oxbone handle. The bristle toothbrush spread to Europe, brought from China to Europe by travellers. It was adopted in Europe during the 17th century. The earliest identified use of the word toothbrush in English was in the autobiography of Anthony Wood who wrote in 1690 that he had bought a toothbrush from J. Barret. Europeans found the hog bristle toothbrushes imported from China too firm and preferred softer bristle toothbrushes made from horsehair. Mass-produced toothbrushes made with horse or boar bristle continued to be imported to Britain from China until the mid 20th century.

In the UK, William Addis is believed to have produced the first mass-produced toothbrush in 1780. In 1770, he had been jailed for causing a riot. While in prison he decided that using a rag with soot and salt on the teeth was ineffective and could be improved. After saving a small bone from a meal, he drilled small holes into the bone and tied into the bone tufts of bristles that he had obtained from one of the guards, passed the tufts of bristle through the holes in the bone and sealed the holes with glue. After his release, he became wealthy after starting a business manufacturing toothbrushes. He died in 1808, bequeathing the business to his eldest son. It remained within family ownership until 1996. Under the name Wisdom Toothbrushes, the company now manufactures 70 million toothbrushes per year in the UK. By 1840 toothbrushes were being mass-produced in Britain, France, Germany, and Japan. Pig bristles were used for cheaper toothbrushes and badger hair for the more expensive ones.

Hertford Museum in Hertford, UK, holds approximately 5000 brushes that make up part of the Addis Collection. The Addis factory on Ware Road was a major employer in the town until 1996. Since the closure of the factory, Hertford Museum has received photographs and documents relating to the archive, and collected oral histories from former employees.

The first patent for a toothbrush was granted to H.N. Wadsworth in 1857 (U.S.A. Patent No. 18,653) in the United States, but mass production in the United States did not start until 1885. The improved design had a bone handle with holes bored into it for the Siberian boar hair bristles. Unfortunately, animal bristle was not an ideal material as it retained bacteria, did not dry efficiently and the bristles often fell out. In addition to bone, handles were made of wood or ivory. In the United States, brushing teeth did not become routine until after World War II, when American soldiers had to clean their teeth daily.
During the 1900s, celluloid gradually replaced bone handles. Natural animal bristles were also replaced by synthetic fibers, usually nylon, by DuPont in 1938. The first nylon bristle toothbrush made with nylon yarn went on sale on February 24, 1938. The first electric toothbrush, the Broxodent, was invented in Switzerland in 1954. By the turn of the 21st century nylon had come to be widely used for the bristles and the handles were usually molded from thermoplastic materials.

Johnson &amp; Johnson, a leading medical supplies firm, introduced the &quot;Reach&quot; toothbrush in 1977. It differed from previous toothbrushes in three ways: it had an angled head, similar to dental instruments, to reach back teeth; the bristles were concentrated more closely than usual to clean each tooth of potentially cariogenic (cavity-causing) materials; and the outer bristles were longer and softer than the inner bristles. Other manufacturers soon followed with other designs aimed at improving effectiveness. In spite of the changes with the number of tufts and the spacing, the handle form and design, the bristles were still straight and difficult to maneuver. In 1978 Dr. George C. Collis developed the Collis Curve toothbrush which was the first toothbrush to have curved bristles. The curved bristles follow the curvature of the teeth and safely reach in between the teeth and into the sulcular areas.

In January 2003, the toothbrush was selected as the number one invention Americans could not live without according to the Lemelson-MIT Invention Index.

==Types of toothbrush==

===Multi-sided toothbrushes===
A multi-sided toothbrush is a fast and easy way to brush the teeth.

===Electric toothbrush===

It has been discovered that compared to a manual brush, the multi-directional power brush might reduce the incidence of gingivitis and plaque, when compared to regular side-to-side brushing. These brushes tend to be more costly and damaging to the environment when compared to manual toothbrushes. Most studies report performances equivalent to those of manual brushings, possibly with a decrease in plaque and gingivitis. An additional timer and pressure sensors can encourage a more efficient cleaning process.
Electric toothbrushes can be classified, according to the speed of their movements as: standard power toothbrushes, sonic toothbrushes, or ultrasonic toothbrushes. Any electric toothbrush is technically a powered toothbrush. If the motion of the toothbrush is sufficiently rapid to produce a hum in the audible frequency range (20 Hz to 20,000 Hz), it can be classified as a sonic toothbrush. Any electric toothbrush with movement faster than this limit can be classified as an ultrasonic toothbrush. Certain ultrasonic toothbrushes, such as the Megasonex and the Ultreo, have both sonic and ultrasonic movements.

There are different electric toothbrush heads designed for sensitive teeth and gums, increased stain removal, or different-sized bristles for tight or gapped teeth. The hand motion with an electric toothbrush is different from a manual toothbrush. They are meant to have the bristles do the work by just placing and moving the toothbrush, so that fewer back and forth strokes are needed.

===Interdental brush===

An interdental or interproximal (&quot;proxy&quot;) brush is a small brush, typically disposable, either supplied with a reusable angled plastic handle or an integral handle, used for cleaning between teeth and between the wires of dental braces and the teeth.

The use of interdental brushes in conjunction with tooth brushing has been shown to reduce both the amount of plaque and the incidence of gingivitis when compared to tooth brushing alone. Although there is some evidence that after tooth brushing with a conventional tooth brush, interdental brushes remove more plaque than dental floss, a systematic review reported insufficient evidence to determine such an association.

The size of interdental brushes is standardized in ISO 16409. The brush size, which is a number between 0 (small space between teeth) and 8 (large space), indicates the &quot;passage hole diameter&quot;. This corresponds to the space between two teeth that is just sufficient for the brush to go through without bending the wire. The color of the brushes differs between producers. The same is the case with respect to the wire diameter.

===End-tuft brush===

The small round brush head comprises seven tufts of tightly packed soft nylon bristles, trimmed so the bristles in the center can reach deeper into small spaces. The brush handle is ergonomically designed for a firm grip, giving the control and precision necessary to clean where most other cleaning aids cannot reach. These areas include the posterior of the wisdom teeth (third molars), orthodontic structures (braces), crowded teeth, and tooth surfaces that are next to missing teeth. It can also be used to clean areas around implants, bridges, dentures and other appliances.

===Chewable toothbrush===

A chewable toothbrush is a miniature plastic moulded toothbrush which can be placed inside the mouth. While not commonly used, they are useful to travelers and are sometimes available from bathroom vending machines. They are available in different flavors such as mint or bubblegum and should be disposed of after use. Other types of disposable toothbrushes include those that contain a small breakable plastic ball of toothpaste on the bristles, which can be used without water.

===Musical toothbrush===
A musical toothbrush is a type of manual or powered toothbrush designed to make tooth brushing habit more interesting. It is more commonly introduced to children to gain their attention and positively influence their tooth brushing behavior. The music starts while child starts brushing, it continuously plays during the brushing and it ends when the child stops brushing.

===Toothpaste-less toothbrush===
===Reusable toothbrush===
==Tooth brushing==
===Hygiene and care===
It is not recommended to share toothbrushes with others, since besides general hygienic concerns, there is a risk of transmitting diseases that are typically transmittable by blood, such as Hepatitis C.

It is advisable to rinse the toothbrush with water, shake it off and let dry after use.

Studies have shown that brushing to remove dental plaque more often than every 48 hours is enough to maintain gum and tooth health. Tooth brushing can remove plaque up to one millimeter below the gum line. Each person has a habitual brushing method, so more frequent brushing does not cover additional parts of the teeth or mouth.
Most dentists recommended patients brush twice a day in the hope that frequent brushing would clean more areas of the mouth.
Tooth brushing is the most common preventive healthcare activity, but tooth and gum disease remain high, since lay people clean at most 40% of their tooth margins at the gum line. Videos show that even when asked to brush their best, they do not know how to clean effectively.

===Adversity of toothbrushes===
Teeth can be damaged by several factors including poor oral hygiene, but also by wrong oral hygiene. Especially for sensitive teeth, damage to dentin and gums can be prevented by several measures including a correct brushing technique.

It is beneficial when using a straight bristled brush: not to scrub horizontally over the necks of teeth; not to press the brush too hard against the teeth, to choose a toothpaste that is not too abrasive; and to wait at least 30 minutes after consumption of acidic food or drinks before brushing.
Harder toothbrushes reduce plaque more efficiently but are more stressful to teeth and gum; using a medium to soft brush for a longer cleaning time was rated to be the best compromise between cleaning result and gum and tooth health.

A study by University College London found that advice on brushing technique and frequency given by 10 national dental associations, toothpaste and toothbrush companies, and in dental textbooks was inconsistent.

<text>, also called Doll&#x27;s Day or Girls&#x27; Day, is a religious (Shinto) day in Japan (but not a national holiday), celebrated on 3March of each year. Platforms covered with a red carpet–material are used to display a set of representing the Emperor, Empress, attendants, and musicians in traditional court dress of the Heian period.

== Customs ==
 is one of the that are held on auspicious dates of the Lunisolar calendar: the first day of the first month, the third day of the third month, and so on. After the adoption of the Gregorian calendar, these were fixed on 1January, 3March, 5May, 7July, and 9September. The festival was traditionally known as the , as peach trees typically began to flower around this time. Although this is no longer true since the shift to Gregorian dates, the name remains and peaches are still symbolic of the festival.

The primary aspect of is the display of seated male and female dolls (the and ), which represent a Heian period wedding, but are usually described as the Emperor and Empress of Japan. The dolls are usually seated on red cloth, and may be as simple as pictures or folded paper dolls, or as intricate as carved three-dimensional dolls. More elaborate displays will include a multi-tiered of dolls that represent ladies of the court, musicians, and other attendants, with all sorts of accoutrements. The entire set of dolls and accessories is called the . The number of tiers and dolls a family may have depends on their budget.

Families normally ensure that girls and women have a set of the two main dolls before their first Hinamatsuri. The dolls are usually fairly expensive ($1,500 to $2,500 for a five-tier set, depending on quality) and may be handed down from older generations as heirlooms. The spends most of the year in storage, and girls or women and their mothers begin setting up the display a few days before 3March (boys and men normally do not participate, as 5May, now Children&#x27;s Day, was historically called &quot;Boys&#x27; Day&quot;). Traditionally, the dolls were supposed to be put away by the day after , the superstition being that leaving the dolls any longer will result in a late marriage for the daughter, but some families may leave them up for the entire month of March. Practically speaking, the encouragement to put everything away quickly is to avoid the rainy season and humidity that typically follows .

Historically, the dolls were used as toys, but in modern times they are intended for display only. The display of dolls is usually discontinued when the girls and women reach ten years of age.

During and the preceding days, girls and women hold parties with their friends. Typical foods include , , , , and . The customary drink is , also called , a non-alcoholic sake.

 ceremonies are held around the country, where participants make dolls out of paper or straw and send them on a boat down a river, carrying one&#x27;s impurities and sin with them. Some locations, such as at the Nagashibina Doll Museum in Tottori City, still follow the lunisolar calendar instead of doing it on 3March.

, traditional decoration for &quot;Hinamatsuri&quot;, are lengths of coloured cords (usually in red), usually featuring decorations of miniature baby-dolls, which were originally made from leftover kimono silk (so the idea of repurposing fabric scraps is central to this craft; it is a great activity for using up leftover materials). &quot;Tsurushi-Bina&quot; are not limited to featuring miniature baby-dolls, but also flowers (i.e., camellia flower, etc.), shells, &quot;Temari&quot; balls, colourful triangles to represent mountains (such as Mount Fuji, etc.), etc., and with tassels at the bottom.

==Placement==
The actual placement order of the dolls from left to right varies according to family tradition and location, but the order of dolls per level is the same. The layer of covering is called or simply , a red carpet with rainbow stripes at the bottom. The description that follows is for a complete set.

===First, top platform===
The top tier holds two dolls, known as . The words &quot;dairi&quot; means &quot;imperial palace&quot;. These are the &quot;obina&quot; holding a and &quot;mebina&quot; holding a fan. The pair are also known as and (lord and princess) or and (honored palace official and honored doll). Although they are sometimes referred to as the Emperor and Empress, they only represent the positions and not particular individuals themselves (with the exception of some dolls from the Meiji Era that actually depict Emperor Meiji and Empress Shōken). The two are usually placed in front of a gold folding screen and placed beside green Japanese garden trees.

Optional are the two lampstands, called , and the paper or silk lanterns that are known as , which are usually decorated with cherry or plum blossom patterns.

Complete sets would include accessories placed between the two figures, known as , composing of two vases of artificial .

Generally speaking, the Kansai style arrangement has the male on the right, while Kantō style arrangements have him on the left (from the viewer&#x27;s perspective).

===Second platform===
The second tier holds three court ladies who serve sake to the male and female dolls. Commonly, two dolls are standing on both sides of one seated doll, but there are people who use two seated dolls on both sides of one standing doll.

The doll on the viewer&#x27;s left bears a . The one on the viewer&#x27;s right holds a . The doll in the middle carries different items in Kyoto compared with the rest of Japan. In Kyoto, the middle doll carries a upon which is something auspicious such as ; whereas in the rest of Japan, she carries a upon which a sake cup is rested.

Accessories placed between the ladies are , stands with round table-tops for seasonal sweets, excluding &quot;hishi mochi&quot;.

===Third platform===
The third tier holds five male musicians . Each holds a musical instrument except the singer, who holds a fan:
# , seated,
# , standing,
# , standing,
# , or , seated,
# , holding a , standing.

There are ancient sets with seven or ten musicians and at least one with female musicians.

===Fourth platform===

== Origin ==

It is said that the first time Hina dolls were shown in the manner they are now as part of the Peach Festival was when the young princess Meisho succeeded to the throne of her abdicating father, Emperor Go-Mizunoo, in 1629. Because empresses regnant in Japan at the time were not allowed to get married, Meisho&#x27;s mother, Tokugawa Masako, created a doll arrangement showing Meisho blissfully wedded. Hinamatsuri then officially became the name of the festival in 1687. Doll-makers began making elaborate dolls for the festival (some growing as tall as high before laws were passed restricting their size). Over time, the &quot;hinakazari&quot; evolved to include fifteen dolls and accessories. As dolls became more expensive, tiers were added to the &quot;hinadan&quot; so that the expensive ones could be placed out of the reach of young children.

During the Meiji period as Japan began to modernize and the emperor was restored to power, Hinamatsuri was deprecated in favor of new holidays that focused on the emperor&#x27;s supposed bond with the nation. By focusing on marriage and families, it represented Japanese hopes and values. The dolls were said to represent the emperor and empress; they also fostered respect for the throne. The holiday then spread to other countries via the Japanese diaspora, although it remains confined to Japanese immigrant communities and descendants.

<text>is a Japanese manga artist and singer. She is included in the Year 24 Group by some critics, journalists, and academics, although her inclusion has been debated due to a focus more on epic stories than the internal psychology of those mangaka. She was one of the most popular Japanese comic artists in the 1970s, being best known for &quot;The Rose of Versailles&quot;.

== Education ==
Ikeda was a student at the Tokyo University of Education (now known as Tsukuba University) as a philosophy major. Influenced by the Japanese New Left and student protest movements in the late 1960s, she became a member of the Democratic Youth League of Japan, the youth wing of the Japanese Communist Party. In her sixth year of college, she started serializing her most famous manga, &quot;The Rose of Versailles&quot;, and subsequently dropped out after seven years of college due to busyness with serialization.

== Career ==
Ikeda began publishing manga in the magazine &quot;Kashihonya&quot; while studying philosophy. She debuted in 1967 with &quot;Bara Yashiki no Shōjo&quot;.

Ikeda has written and illustrated many shōjo manga, many of which are based on historical events, such as the French Revolution or the Russian Revolution. Her use of foreign settings and androgynous themes made &quot;The Rose of Versailles&quot; and &quot;Orpheus no Mado&quot; enormous successes.

Her most famous manga is &quot;The Rose of Versailles&quot;, also known as &quot;Lady Oscar&quot; in Europe. This manga, loosely based on the French Revolution, has been made into several Takarazuka musicals, an anime series, and a live-action film. After &quot;Rose of Versailles&quot; concluded, Ikeda wrote articles for &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot;. In 1985 Ikeda began studying at Tokyo College of Music at which she graduated from in 1999 and began performing as an opera singer. Her voice is in the soprano range. She made a comeback to the comic industry as a script writer in 1999. Her recent manga includes &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;. It is a manga version of the opera written by Richard Wagner. Recently her series The Rose of Versailles received a movie adaptation by studio MAPPA which released in Japan in late January of 2025.

In 2008, she was awarded France&#x27;s National Order of the Legion of Honour for her contribution to Japan&#x27;s cultural awareness of France and received the medal of &quot;Chevalier&quot; from the French ambassador to Japan. She was awarded the Japan Cartoonists Association Award of Excellence work Orpheus no Mado in 1980.

She was also a guest at the 2011 Angoulême International Comics Festival. In 2010 she attended Romics in Rome, Italy and performed with Yoshitaka Murata and Giacomo Rocchetti. Ikeda also worked on a three part opera by the title of Nemuro Otoko which was composed in 2021 and performed in Finland.

<text>Japanese traditional dance describes a number of Japanese dance styles with a long history and prescribed method of performance. Some of the oldest forms of traditional Japanese dance may be among those transmitted through the tradition, or folk dances relating to food producing activities such as planting rice () and fishing, including rain dances. There are large number of these traditional dances, which are often subfixed , , and , and may be specific to a region or village. and are the two main groups of Japanese dances, and the term was coined in modern times as a general term for dance, by combining (which can also be pronounced ) and (which can also be pronounced ).

 is a more reserved genre of dance that often has circling movements, and dances of the Noh theatre are of this tradition. A variation of the style of Japanese dance is , or Kyoto-style dance. developed in the 17th century Tokugawa cultural period. It is heavily influenced by the elegance and sophistication of the manners often associated with the Imperial Court in Kyoto. has more vigorous stepping movements and is more energetic, and dances of the kabuki theatre belong to this category.

==Classification==
There are several types of traditional Japanese dance. The most basic classification is into two forms, and , which can be further classified into genres such as Noh or , the latter style having its origins in the pleasure districts of Kyoto and Osaka.

The style is reserved and typified by circling movements where the body is kept low to the ground. The style includes folk dances performed at annual festival events and dances that were part of traditional kabuki performances. The style features larger movements and is typically more energetic.

Traditional dance forms in the present day have also been influenced by Western dance forms like ballet, which were introduced to Japan during the Meiji Restoration. In (&#x27;The Heron Maiden&#x27;) the dancer&#x27;s role is the spirit of the heron. In classical versions, the spirit assumes a handsome, strong pose at the end of the dance. However, this classical ending was altered in later versions (which borrowed heavily from Anna Pavlova&#x27;s performances of &quot;The Dying Swan&quot;) so the spirit gradually became lifeless, ultimately sinking to the floor.

==Kabuki==

 is a classical Japanese dance-drama. Kabuki theatre is known for the stylization of its drama and for the elaborate make-up worn by some of its performers.

The individual kanji characters, from left to right, mean , , and . Kabuki is therefore sometimes translated as &#x27;the art of singing and dancing&#x27;. These are, however, characters which do not reflect actual etymology. The kanji of &#x27;skill&#x27; generally refers to a performer in kabuki theatre. Since the word &#x27;kabuki&#x27; is believed to derive from the verb , meaning &#x27;to lean&#x27; or &#x27;to be out of the ordinary&#x27;, &quot;kabuki&quot; can be interpreted as &#x27;avant-garde&#x27; or &#x27;bizarre&#x27; theatre. The expression referred originally to those who were bizarrely dressed and swaggered on a street.

The history of kabuki began in 1603, when Izumo no Okuni, possibly a shrine maiden of Izumo Taisha Temple, began performing a new style of dance drama in the dry riverbeds of Kyoto, and they were then called &quot;strange&quot; or &quot;unusual&quot; (&quot;kabuki&quot;). This new form of dance drama is thought to have been derived from folk-dances performed only by women, and . Kabuki became a common form of entertainment in Yoshiwara, the registered red-light district in Edo. During the Genroku era, kabuki thrived. The structure of a kabuki play was formalized during this period, as were many elements of style. Conventional character types were established, as were many of the most popular and still-performed plays.

==Noh ==
The origin of Noh can be traced back to as far as the fourteenth century. Noh is a dance that is done to music that is made by flutes and small hand drums called . At various points the performers dance to vocal and percussion music; these points are called or . Noh dances are put together by a series of forms. Forms are patterns of body movements that are done elegantly and with beauty.

There are several types of Noh dances. A type that is neither slow nor fast is called , and is usually performed by a female dancer. A slower type of dance is the , which is also done by a female, sometimes dressed up as a ghost of a noble woman, a spirit, or a deity. A male&#x27;s dance is . In the performer does not wear a mask and is portraying the character as being heroic. Another male dance is , where the dancer acts as though he is a deity. This is a very fast dance. The female version of this is called and can be performed in various ways. is a dance that imitates music played at the imperial court and is usually done by the main character in a Noh drama. These are the six varieties that make up the Noh dance types.

Costumes are a major part of Noh theatre, including the Noh . Dances and play may start out slowly, so actors create flamboyant, colourful costumes to keep the audience engaged. They also dress to fit the aspects the characters represent, for example a bamboo hat worn by a character represents country life. The most important part of the Noh costumes are the masks. The Noh masks are thought to be the most artistic masks in Japan. The masks are only worn by the main characters. The masks have neutral expressions so it is the job of the actor to bring the character to life.


 is different from most other traditional dances. It is intended for entertainment on stage. is a refined dance that has been improved throughout four centuries.

There are four parts to , the most significant part being kabuki . Most of the repertoire has been borrowed from 18th and 19th century kabuki theatre and even from the (pleasure quarters) of Edo Japan.

The third part of these dances comes from the folk dances; the spinning and jumping used in folk dances was incorporated into . The last part came from a mixture of European and American culture that is found in Japan today.

 did not reach its present form until the Meiji Restoration of 1868 during a time when Western dance forms were being introduced to Japan. Thus, the present day form of was influenced by dance forms like ballet.

==Folk dances==

There are a wide variety of folk dances in Japan. Folk dances are often the basis from which other dance forms developed. An example of a Japanese folk dance is the , a dance based upon the fluttering movements of the Eurasian tree sparrow. It was first performed and improvised by stonemasons who were constructing Sendai Castle for the Date Masamune. The emblem of the Date clan incorporates two tree sparrows. The sparrow dance is now performed yearly in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture at the Aoba festival in mid-May. School children in Miyagi prefecture learn and perform the sparrow dance, especially during the Obon Festival.
====
 is a type of folk dance performed during the Obon Festival. It was originally a dance to welcome the spirits of the dead. These dances and the music that accompanies them are different for every region of Japan. Usually, the dance involves people dancing around a , a high wooden scaffold. The people move either counter clockwise or clockwise, away and towards the . Sometimes they switch direction.

The movement and gestures in a dance often depict the history, work or geography of the region.

<text>A slam dunk, also simply known as a dunk, is a type of basketball shot that is performed when a player jumps in the air, controls the ball above the horizontal plane of the rim, and scores by shoving the ball directly through the basket with one or both hands. It is a type of field goal that is worth two points. Such a shot was known as a &quot;dunk shot&quot; until the term &quot;slam dunk&quot; was coined by former Los Angeles Lakers announcer Chick Hearn.

The slam dunk is usually the highest percentage shot and a crowd-pleaser. Thus, the maneuver is often taken from the basketball game and showcased in slam dunk contests such as the NBA Slam Dunk Contest held during the annual NBA All-Star Weekend. The first incarnation of the NBA Slam Dunk Contest was held during the half-time of the 1976 ABA All-Star Game.

A study was carried out in 2015 to show the effectiveness of different shot types, including slam dunks. The study was carried out across five different levels of basketball (NBA, EuroBasket, the Slovenian 1st Division, and two minor leagues). Overall the study showed that slam dunks were a very effective way of scoring in the game of basketball, particularly in the NBA, which had the highest dunk percentage in the study.

==History==

Joe Fortenberry, playing for the McPherson Globe Refiners, dunked the ball in 1936 in Madison Square Garden. The feat was immortalized by Arthur Daley, Pulitzer Prize winning sports writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in an article in March 1936. He wrote that Joe Fortenberry and his teammate, Willard Schmidt, instead of shooting up for a layup, leaped up and &quot;pitch[ed] the ball downward into the hoop, much like a cafeteria customer dunking a roll in coffee&quot;.

During the 1940s, 7-foot center and Olympic gold medalist Bob Kurland was dunking regularly during games. Yet defenders viewed the execution of a slam dunk as a personal affront that deserved retribution; thus defenders often intimidated offensive players and thwarted the move. Kurland&#x27;s rival big man George Mikan noted &quot;We used to dunk in pregame practice, not in the game.&quot; Satch Sanders, a career Boston Celtic from 1960 to 1973, said: &quot;in the old days, [defenders] would run under you when you were in the air ... trying to take people out of games so they couldn&#x27;t play. It was an unwritten rule.&quot; 

Still, by the 1950s and early 1960s some of the NBA&#x27;s tallest and strongest centers such as Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain had incorporated the move into their offensive arsenal. Slightly smaller players at forward and guard then began to dunk, helping to popularize the move, like &quot;Jumping&quot; Johnny Green, Gus Johnson, Elgin Baylor, and Connie Hawkins in the 1960s; and David Thompson and Julius Erving in the 1970s. This transformed dunking into the standard fare it is today. 
===1956 rule changes===
In the 1950s, Jim Pollard and Wilt Chamberlain had both dunked from the free throw line—15 feet from the basket. Chamberlain was able to dunk from the free-throw line without a running start, beginning his forward movement from within the top half of the free-throw circle. This was the catalyst for the 1956 NCAA rule change which requires that a shooter maintain both feet behind the line during a free-throw attempt. An inbounds pass over the backboard was also banned because of Chamberlain. Offensive goaltending, also called basket interference, was introduced as a rule in 1956 after Bill Russell had exploited it at San Francisco and Chamberlain was soon to enter college play. While at the University of Kansas, Chamberlain was known to have dunked on an experimental 12-foot basket set up by Phog Allen. When Chamberlain dunked the ball it was called a &quot;dipper dunk.&quot;
===Lew Alcindor rule===
Dunking was banned in the NCAA and high school sports from 1967 to 1976. Many people have attributed the ban to the dominance of the college phenomenon Lew Alcindor (now known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar); the no-dunking rule is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Lew Alcindor rule.&quot; Others have attributed the ban to racial motivations, as at the time most of the prominent dunkers in college basketball were African-American, and the ban took place less than a year after the 1966 NCAA University Division basketball championship game, wherein a Texas Western team with an all-black starting lineup beat an all-white Kentucky team to win the national championship. Under head coach Guy Lewis, Houston (with Elvin Hayes) made considerable use of the on their way to the Final Four 

=== Breakaway rims ===
In the NBA, in 1976 Arthur Erhat filed a patent for &quot;a rim that had give but immediately returned to its original position,&quot; making dunking safe for the first time by significantly reducing the shattering of backboards. In 1979, Erving&#x27;s teammate and center Darryl Dawkins twice shattered NBA backboards with dunks leading to a quickly-enacted rule making it an offence to break the backboard. Technology has evolved to adapt to the increased strength and weight of players to withstand the force of such dunks, such as the breakaway rim (introduced to the NBA in 1981) changes to the material used for the backboards, and strengthening of the goal standards themselves. The invention by Arthur Ehrat to create the breakaway rim with a spring on it led to the return of the dunk in college basketball.

All-star power forward Gus Johnson of the Baltimore Bullets was the first of the famous backboard breakers in the NBA, shattering three during his career in the 1960s and early 1970s. Luke Jackson also shattered a backboard in 1968. In the ABA, Charlie Hentz broke two backboards in the same game on 6 November 1970 resulting in the game being called.

The NBA has made shattering the backboard a technical foul, although it will not count towards a player&#x27;s count of seven that can draw a suspension, or two towards ejection from a game, though it counts towards a player&#x27;s count of six personal fouls. This has assisted in deterring this action, as it can cost the team points.

=== Slam Dunk Contest era ===
The first-ever Slam Dunk Contest was held on January 27, 1976 at McNichols Sports Arena in Denver during halftime of the 1976 ABA All-Star Game, the league&#x27;s final All-Star game before the completion of the ABA–NBA merger. Erving defeated Thompson in the championship round, after leaping from the free-throw line. The other participants were Artis Gilmore, George Gervin, and Larry Kenon. 

The NBA held its first Slam Dunk Contest as a one-off, season-long event similar to NBA Horse event held the following season. During halftime at each game, there was a one-on-one slam dunk competition. Former ABA player Darnell &quot;Dr. Dunk&quot; Hillman was named the winner that season. Although he received the winner&#x27;s $15,000 check, Hillman did not receive a trophy until 2017.

====Modern era====
The Houston Cougars from 1982 to 1984, with Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler, were known as Phi Slama Jama. The national champion 1982 North Carolina Tar Heels also featured two notable dunkers: James Worthy and Michael Jordan.
Larry Nance won the first modern dunk contest in 1984. Spud Webb at defeated Dominique Wilkins in the 1986 dunk contest. 

Michael Jordan nicknamed &quot;Air Jordan&quot; for his dunking ability, popularized a dunk referred to by some fans as the &quot;Leaner&quot; in 1987 contest. This dunk was so called because Jordan&#x27;s body was not perpendicular to the ground while performing the dunk. TNT viewers rated it &quot;the best dunk of all time&quot; over Vince Carter&#x27;s between-the-legs slam. In the 1988 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, which came down to Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins, Jordan dunked from the free-throw line, much like Erving, but parted his legs making his dunk arguably more memorable than Erving&#x27;s. 

Twice in his rookie season () during games, center Shaquille O&#x27;Neal dunked so hard that he broke the hydraulic support of one goal standard (against the Phoenix Suns) and broke the welds holding up another goal standard, causing the basket to break off and fall to the floor (against the New Jersey Nets), although in neither case did the glass break. This resulted in reinforced backboard supports as well. During that same season, New Jersey&#x27;s Chris Morris shattered a backboard in a game against the Chicago Bulls (the most recent shattered-backboard incident in the NBA to date).

In the 1996 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, winner Brent Barry dunked from the free-throw line. Barry received 49 (out of 50) for the dunk. Kobe Bryant won the 1997 Dunk Contest.

====2000–present====
Vince Carter dunked while leaping over 7-foot-2 (2.18 m) French center Frédéric Weis in the 2000 Summer Olympics. The French media dubbed it &quot;le dunk de la mort&quot;—&quot;the dunk of death&quot;. In the 2000 dunk contest Carter used an elbow hang along with his reverse 360 windmill dunk (reminiscent of Kenny Walker&#x27;s 360 windmill dunk in 1989 except that Carter spins clockwise, whereas Walker spins counter-clockwise) and between-the-legs dunk. When performed, much of the audience was speechless, including the judges, because none had seen these types of dunks before.

In the 2008 Sprite Rising Star&#x27;s Slam Dunk Contest Dwight Howard performed the &quot;Superman&quot; dunk. He donned a Superman outfit as Orlando Magic guard Jameer Nelson tied a cape around his shoulders. Nelson alley-ooped the basketball as Howard jumped from within the key side of the free throw circle line, caught the ball, and threw it through the rim. This dunk is somewhat controversial, as his hand was not over as well as on a vertical plane to the rim. Some insist that it should in fact be considered a dunk because the ball was thrust downward into the basket, meeting the basic definition of the dunk.

During the 2009 NBA dunk contest, Howard had a separate goal brought onto the court, and the rim was noticeably significantly higher than a standard goal. Howard, after going into a 1950s-era telephone booth and again fashioning the Superman attire, caught a pass from Nelson and easily completed a two-handed dunk on the higher goal. While this was not performed for record-setting purposes, the dunk received a perfect score and a warm response from the crowd, in part because of its theatrics. Also in this contest, 5&#x27;9&quot; guard Nate Robinson wore a green New York Knicks jersey and green sneakers to represent Kryptonite, playing on Howard&#x27;s Superman theme. He used a green &quot;Kryptonite&quot; ball, and jumped over the 6&#x27;11&quot; Howard prior to dunking. This dunk and the theatrics could have won the competition for Robinson, who was voted the winner by the NBA fans. Robinson then thanked Howard for graciously allowing him to dunk over him, asking the crowd to also give Howard a round of applause.

More recently, the Clippers earned the nickname &quot;Lob City&quot; from 2011 onwards, with Chris Paul utilizing alley-oop passes regularly to teammates Blake Griffin, and DeAndre Jordan.

JaVale McGee currently holds the world record for Most Basketball Dunks in a Single Jump: three. While competing in the 2011 NBA Sprite Slam Dunk Contest, McGee jumped with two balls in his possession and dunked each prior to receiving and slamming an alley-oop pass from then teammate John Wall.

In the 2016 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, Zach LaVine dunked from the free throw line on three occasions: One Hand, Windmill, and Between the Legs. All of the Dunks received a score of 50 for the dunk and won the Dunk contest.

==Dunk types==

Dunk types reflect the various motions performed on the way to the basket. They start with the basic one- or two-hand forward-facing dunk and go on through various levels of athleticism and intricacy. Discrete dunk types can be modified by appending other moves; for example, a player who passes the ball off the backboard, catches it in the air, and executes a &quot;double-pump dunk&quot; would be said to have completed a &quot;self-pass off the backboard, double pump&quot;.

===Tomahawk===
One of the simplest dunk types is the &quot;tomahawk&quot; dunk, resembling the windup and sharp downward motion of a blow with a tomahawk. A Tomahawk dunk can be performed with one or two hands, and when two hands are used, it is called a backscratcher. Initially referred to as a gorilla dunk, that term is uncommon now. During the jump, the ball is raised above, and often behind the player&#x27;s head for a wind-up before slamming the ball down into the net at the apex of the jump. Due to the undemanding body mechanics involved in execution, the tomahawk is employed by players of all sizes and jumping abilities. Because of the ball-security provided by the use of both hands, the two-handed tomahawk is a staple of game situations—frequently employed in alley-oops and in offense-rebound put-back dunks.

In one common variation, a 360° spin may be completed prior to or simultaneously with the tomahawk. Circa 2009, independent slam dunker Troy McCray pioneered an especially complex variant of the dunk: once the tomahawk motion is complete, instead of slamming the ball in the rim, a windmill dunk (see below) is then performed.

===Windmill===
Before takeoff, or at the onset of the jump, the ball is brought to the abdomen and then the windmill motion is started by moving the ball below the waist according to the length of the player&#x27;s fully extended arm. Then following the rotation of the outstretch arm, the ball is moved in a circular motion, typically moving from the front towards the back, and then slammed through the rim. Although, due to momentum, many players are unable to palm the ball through the entire windmill motion, the dunk is often completed with one-hand as centripetal force allows the player to guide the ball with only their dunking hand. In some instances sticky resins or powders may be applied to the palm, these are thought to improve grip and prevent loss of possession. Amongst players, subtle variations in the direction of the windmill depend on bodily orientation at takeoff and also jumping style (one-foot or two-feet) in relation to dominant hand.

There are a number of variations on the windmill, the most common being the aforementioned one- or two-hand variants. In these cases, the windmill motion may be performed with the previously discussed one-arm technique and finished with one- or two-hands, or the player may control the ball with two hands, with both arms performing the windmill motion, finishing with one or both hands. Additionally, the ball may be &quot;cuffed&quot; between the hand and the forearm—generally with the dominant hand. The cuff technique provides better ball security, allowing for a faster windmill motion and increased force exerted on the basket at finish, with either one or both hands. Using the cuffing method, players are also afforded the opportunity of performing the windmill motion towards the front, a technique exploited by French athlete Kadour Ziani when he pioneered his trademark double-windmill.

Occasionally in the game setting, the windmill is performed via alley-oop but is rarely seen in offense-rebound putback dunks due to the airtime required. Dominique Wilkins popularized powerful windmills—in games as well as in contests—including two-handed, self-pass, 360°, rim-hang, and combined variants thereof.

===Double Clutch===
At the onset of the jump, the ball is controlled by either one or both hands and once in the air is typically brought to chest level. The player will then quickly thrust the ball downwards and fully extend their arms, bringing the ball below the waist. Finally the ball is brought above the head and dunked with one or both hands; and the double clutch appears as one fluid motion. As a demonstration of athletic prowess, the ball may be held in the below-the-waist position for milliseconds longer, thus showcasing the player&#x27;s hang time (jumping ability).

Whether the result of a 180° spin or body angle at takeoff, the double clutch is generally performed with the player&#x27;s back toward the rim. While this orientation is rather conducive to the double clutch motion, Spud Webb was known to perform this dunk while facing the basket. Additionally, Kenny &quot;Sky&quot; Walker, Tracy McGrady—in the 1989 and 2000 NBA Contests, respectively—and others, have performed 360° variation of the double clutch (McGrady completed a lob self-pass before the dunk). Circa 2007, independent slam dunker T-Dub performed the double clutch with a 540° spin which he concluded by hanging on the rim.

===Between the Legs===
For one-footed jumpers, the ball is generally transferred to the non-dominant hand just before or upon take-off; for two-footers, this transfer is often delayed for milliseconds as both hands control the ball to prevent dropping it. Once airborne, the dunker generally transfers the ball from non-dominant to dominant hand beneath a raised leg. Finally, the ball is brought upwards by the dominant hand and slammed through the rim.

The between-the-legs dunk was popularized by Isaiah Rider in the 1994 NBA slam dunk contest, who called it &quot;The East Bay Funk Dunk,&quot; so much so that the dunk is often colloquially referred to as a &quot;Rider dunk&quot;—notwithstanding Orlando Woolridge&#x27;s own such dunk in the NBA contest a decade earlier. Since then, the under-the-leg has been attempted in the NBA contest by a number of participants, and has been a staple of other contests as well. Its difficulty—due to the required hand-eye coordination, flexibility, and hang-time—keeps it generally reserved for exhibitions and contests, not competitive games. Ricky Davis has managed to complete the dunk in an NBA game, but both he and Josh Smith have botched at least one in-game attempt as well.

Because of the possible combinations of starting and finishing hands, and raised-legs, there are many variations on the basic under-the-legs dunk—more so than any other. For example, in a 1997 French Dunk contest, Dali Taamallah leapt with his right leg while controlling the ball with his left hand, and once airborne he transferred the ball from his left hand, underneath his right leg to his right hand before completing the dunk. NBA star Jason Richardson has also pioneered several notable variations of the between-the-legs including a lob-pass to himself and a pass off of the backboard to himself. Independent athlete Shane &#x27;Slam&#x27; Wise introduced a cuffed-cradle of the ball prior to initiating the under the leg transfer and finishing with two-hands. While a number of players have finished the dunk using one- or two-hands with their backs to the rim, perhaps the most renowned variant of the dunk is the combination with a 360°, or simply stated: a 360-between-the-legs. Due to the athleticism and hang-time required, the dunk is a crowd favorite and is heralded by players as the preeminent of all dunks.

===Elbow Hang===

The player approaches the basket and leaps as they would for a generic dunk. Instead of simply dunking the ball with one or two hands, the player allows their forearm(s) to pass through the basket, hooking their elbow pit on the rim before hanging for a short period of time. Although the dunk was introduced by Vince Carter in the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk contest, Kobe Bryant was filmed performing the dunk two years earlier in 1998 at an exhibition in the Philippines and during the 1997 offseason at Magic Johnson&#x27;s A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Magic charity event as well as Roy Hinson who performed the dunk during warm-ups for the 1986 NBA Slam Dunk contest. Colloquially, the dunk has a variety of names including &#x27;honey dip&#x27;, &#x27;cookie jar&#x27;, and &#x27;elbow hook&#x27;.

In the 2011 NBA contest, Los Angeles Clippers power-forward Blake Griffin completed a self-pass off of the backboard prior to elbow-hanging on the rim. A number of other variants of the elbow hang have been executed, including a lob self-pass, hanging by the arm pit, a windmill, and over a person. Most notable are two variations which as of July 2012, have yet to be duplicated. In 2008, Canadian athlete Justin Darlington introduced an iteration aptly entitled a &#x27;double-elbow hang&#x27;, in which the player inserts both forearms through the rim and subsequently hangs on both elbows pits. Circa 2009, French athlete Guy Dupuy demonstrated the ability to perform a between-the-legs elbow hang; however, Guy opted not to hang on the rim by his elbow, likely because the downward moment could have resulted in injury.

===Alley-oop===

An alley-oop dunk, as it is colloquially known, is performed when a pass is caught in the air and then dunked. The application of an alley-oop to a slam dunk occurs in both games and contests. In games, when only fractions of a second remain on the game or shot clock, an alley-oop may be attempted on in-bound pass because neither clock resumes counting down until an in-bounds player touches the ball. The images to the right depict an interval spanning 1/5 of a second.

=== Other ===
James White in the 2006 NCAA Slam Dunk Contest successfully performed tomahawk and windmill variations of the foul-line dunk. Though he was unable to complete a between-the-legs from the foul line at that contest, he has been known to execute it on other occasions.

In the 2008 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, Jamario Moon leaped from the foul-line then, using his non-dominant hand, caught and dunked a bounce-pass from teammate Jason Kapono.

Independent 6&#x27;2&quot; North American athlete Eric Bishop introduced a dunk entitled the &#x27;Paint Job&#x27;. The title is in reference to the key on a basketball court, often known as &#x27;paint&#x27; in common parlance. Approaching along the baseline with a running dribble, Bishop jumped with one-foot at the border of the key, dunked with one-hand while gliding over the key and landed just beyond the border on the side opposite his take-off—a 16-foot flight.

At least one player has performed a 720 degree dunk (that is, two full turns in the air): Taurian Fontenette also known as &quot;Air Up There&quot; during a Streetball game.

==Dunking in women&#x27;s play==

Dunking is much less common in women&#x27;s basketball than in men&#x27;s play. Dunking is slightly more common during practice sessions, but many coaches advise against it in competitive play because of the risks of injury or failing to score.

In 1978, Cardte Hicks became the first woman to dunk in a professional game during a men&#x27;s professional game in the Netherlands.

In 1984, Georgeann Wells, a 6&#x27;7&quot; (201 cm) junior playing for West Virginia University, became the first woman to score a slam dunk in women&#x27;s collegiate play, in a game against the University of Charleston on 21 December. On December 4, 1994, Charlotte Smtih, then a member of the UNC Tar Heels women&#x27;s basketball team, became the second collegiate women&#x27;s player ever to dunk.

As of 2024, at least 37 dunks have been scored by 8 different WNBA players. The first and second were scored by Lisa Leslie of the Los Angeles Sparks, on 30 July 2002 (against the Miami Sol), and 9 July 2005. Other WNBA dunks have been scored by Michelle Snow (first during an All-Star game), Candace Parker (twice), Sylvia Fowles, Brittney Griner, Jonquel Jones, Elena Delle Donne, Liz Cambage, and Awak Kuier.

The record for the most WNBA dunks belongs to Brittney Griner, with 25 career dunks as of 2024. Griner was also the first player to dunk twice in one game (27 May 2013, her WNBA debut) and the first to dunk in a playoff game (25 August 2014). Griner was also prolific in high school and college: as a high school senior, she dunked 52 times in 32 games and set a single-game record of seven dunks. As a standout at Baylor University, Griner became the seventh player to dunk during a women&#x27;s college basketball game and the second woman to dunk twice in a single college game.

At the 2012 London Olympics, Liz Cambage of the Australian Opals became the first woman to dunk in the Olympics, scoring against Russia.

===Women in dunk contests===

In 2004, as a high school senior, Candace Parker was invited to participate in the McDonald&#x27;s All-American Game and accompanying festivities where she competed in and won the slam dunk contest. In subsequent years other women have entered the contest; though Kelley Cain, Krystal Thomas, and Maya Moore were denied entry into the same contest in 2007. Brittney Griner intended to participate in the 2009 McDonald&#x27;s Dunk Contest but was unable to attend the event due to the attendance policy of her high school. Breanna Stewart, at 6&#x27;3&quot; (191 cm), Alexis Prince (6&#x27;2&quot;; 188 cm), and Brittney Sykes (5&#x27;9&quot;; 175 cm) competed in the 2012 contest; Prince and Sykes failed to complete their dunks, while Stewart landed two in the first round but missed her second two attempts in the final round.

==Use as a phrase==
One of many sports idioms, the phrase &quot;slam dunk&quot; is often used outside of basketball to refer colloquially to something that has a certain outcome or guaranteed success (a &quot;sure thing&quot;).
This is related to the high probability of success for a slam dunk versus other types of shots. Additionally, to &quot;be dunked on&quot; or to get &quot;posterized&quot; is sometimes popularly used to indicate that a person has been easily embarrassed by another, in reference to the embarrassment associated with unsuccessfully trying to prevent an opponent from making a dunk. This ascension to popular usage is reminiscent of, for example, the way that the baseball-inspired phrases &quot;step up to the plate&quot; and &quot;he hit it out of the park,&quot; or American football-inspired phrases such as &quot;victory formation&quot; or &quot;hail Mary&quot; have entered popular North American vernacular.

<doc id="147734" wikidata="Q179645" url="?curid=147734" title="Shinjuku">
<text>, officially called Shinjuku City, is a special ward of Tokyo, Japan. It is a major commercial and administrative center, housing the northern half of the busiest railway station in the world (Shinjuku Station) as well as the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, the administrative center of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. , the ward has an estimated population of 346,235 and a population density of 18,232 people per km2. The total area is 18.23 km2. Since the end of World War II, Shinjuku has become a major secondary center of Tokyo (&quot;fukutoshin&quot;), rivaling the original city center in Marunouchi.

&quot;Shinjuku&quot; is also commonly used to refer to Shinjuku Station. The southern half of this area and majority of the station are in fact located in the neighboring Shibuya ward.

==History==
In 1634, during the Edo period, as the outer moat of the Edo Castle was built, a number of temples and shrines moved to the Yotsuya area on the western edge of Shinjuku. In 1698, Naitō-Shinjuku had developed as a new (shin) station (shuku or juku) on the Kōshū Kaidō, one of the major highways of that era. Naitō was the family name of a &quot;daimyō&quot; whose mansion stood in the area; his land is now a public park, the Shinjuku Gyoen. In 1898, the Yodobashi Water Purification Plant, the city&#x27;s first modern water treatment facility, was built in the area that is now between the park and the train station.

In 1920, the town of Naitō-Shinjuku, which comprised large parts of present-day Shinjuku (the neighborhood, not the municipality), parts of Nishi-Shinjuku and Kabukichō was integrated into Tokyo City. Shinjuku began to develop into its current form after the Great Kantō Earthquake in 1923, since the seismically stable area largely escaped the devastation. Consequently, West Shinjuku is one of the few areas in Tokyo with many skyscrapers.

The Tokyo air raids from May to August 1945 destroyed almost 90% of the buildings in the area in and around Shinjuku Station. The pre-war form of Shinjuku and the rest of Tokyo was retained after the war because the roads and rails, damaged as they were, remained, and these formed the heart of Shinjuku in the post-war construction. Only in Kabuki-cho was a grand reconstruction plan put into action.

The present ward was established on March 15, 1947 with the merger of the former wards of Yotsuya, Ushigome, and Yodobashi. It served as part of the athletics 50 km walk and marathon course during the 1964 Summer Olympics. In March 1965, the Yodobashi Water Purification Plant closed and was replaced by skyscrapers in the following years.

In 1991, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government moved from the Marunouchi district of Chiyoda to the current building in Shinjuku (the Tokyo International Forum stands at the former site vacated by the government).

==Geography==
Shinjuku is surrounded by Chiyoda to the east; Bunkyo and Toshima to the north; Nakano to the west, and Shibuya and Minato to the south.
The current city of Shinjuku grew out of several separate towns and villages, which have retained some distinctions despite growing together as part of the Tokyo metropolis.

* East Shinjuku (or administratively called ): The area east of Shinjuku Station between Higashi-Shinjuku Station and Shinjuku-sanchome Station, historically known as Naito-Shinjuku, houses the city hall and the flagship Isetan department store, as well as several smaller areas of interest:
** Kabukichō: Tokyo&#x27;s best-known red-light district, renowned for its variety of bars, restaurants, and sex-related establishments near Seibu-Shinjuku Station.
** Golden Gai: An area of tiny shanty-style bars and clubs. Musicians, artists, journalists, actors and directors gather here, and the ramshackle walls of the bars are plastered with film posters.
** Shinjuku Gyo-en: A large park, 58.3 hectares, 3.5 km in circumference, blending Japanese traditional, English landscape and French formal style gardens.
** Shinjuku Ni-chōme: Tokyo&#x27;s best-known gay district.
* Nishi-Shinjuku: The area west of Shinjuku Station, historically known as Yodobashi, is home to Tokyo&#x27;s largest concentration of skyscrapers. Several of the tallest buildings in Tokyo are located in this area, including the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, KDDI Building and Park Tower.
* Ochiai: The northwestern corner of Shinjuku, extending to the area around Ochiai-minami-nagasaki Station and the south side of Mejiro Station, is largely residential with a small business district around Nakai Station.
* Ōkubo: The area surrounding Okubo Station, Shin-Okubo Station and Higashi-Shinjuku Station is best known as Tokyo&#x27;s historic ethnic Korean neighborhood after World War II.
* Totsuka: The northern portion of Shinjuku surrounding Takadanobaba Station and Waseda University, today commonly referred to as Nishi-Waseda. The Takadanobaba area is a major residential and nightlife area for students, as well as a commuter hub.
* Toyama: A largely residential and school area, in the east of Ōkubo and south of Waseda University, extending to the area around Nishi-Waseda Station, Gakushuin Women&#x27;s College and Toyama Park.
* Ushigome: A largely residential area in the eastern portion of the city.
** Ichigaya: A commercial area in eastern Shinjuku, site of the Ministry of Defense.
** Kagurazaka: A hill descending to the Iidabashi Station area, once one of Tokyo&#x27;s last remaining &quot;hanamachi&quot; or &quot;geisha&quot; districts, and currently known for hosting a sizable French community.
* Yotsuya: An upscale residential and commercial district in the southeast corner of Shinjuku. The Arakichō area is well known for its many small restaurants, bars, and &quot;izakaya&quot;.

&quot;Shinjuku&quot; is often popularly understood to mean the entire area surrounding Shinjuku Station, but the Shinjuku Southern Terrace complex and the areas to the west of the station and south of Kōshū Kaidō are part of the Yoyogi and Sendagaya districts of the special ward of Shibuya.

Naturally, most of Shinjuku is occupied by the Yodobashi Plateau, the most elevated portion of which extends through most of the Shinjuku Station area. The Kanda River runs through the Ochiai and Totsuka areas near sea level, but the Toshima Plateau also builds elevation in the northern extremities of Totsuka and Ochiai. The highest point in Shinjuku is Hakone-san in Toyama Park, 44.6 m above sea level.

<text>Toothpaste is a paste or gel dentifrice used with a toothbrush to clean and maintain the aesthetics and health of teeth. Toothpaste is used to promote oral hygiene: it is an abrasive that aids in removing dental plaque and food from the teeth, assists in suppressing halitosis, and delivers active ingredients (most commonly fluoride) to help prevent tooth decay (dental caries) and gum disease (gingivitis). Due to variations in composition and fluoride content, not all toothpastes are equally effective in maintaining oral health. The decline of tooth decay during the 20th century has been attributed to the introduction and regular use of fluoride-containing toothpastes worldwide. Large amounts of swallowed toothpaste can be poisonous. Common colors for toothpaste include white (sometimes with colored stripes or green tint) and blue.
==History==

===Early toothpastes===
Since 5000 BCE, the Egyptians made a tooth powder, which consisted of powdered ashes of ox hooves, myrrh, powdered and burnt eggshells, and pumice. The Greeks, and then the Romans, improved the recipes by adding abrasives such as crushed bones and oyster shells. In the 9th century, Iraqi musician and fashion designer Ziryab invented a type of toothpaste, which he popularized throughout Islamic Spain. The exact ingredients of this toothpaste are unknown, but it was reported to have been both &quot;functional and pleasant to taste&quot;. It is not known whether these early toothpastes were used alone, were to be rubbed onto the teeth with rags, or were to be used with early toothbrushes, such as neem-tree twigs and &quot;miswak&quot;. During Japan&#x27;s Edo period, inventor Hiraga Gennai&#x27;s &quot;Hika rakuyo&quot; (1769) contained advertisements for &quot;Sosekiko&quot;, a &quot;toothpaste in a box.&quot; Toothpastes or powders came into general use in the 19th century.

== Usefulness ==
Toothpastes are generally useful to maintain dental health. Toothpastes containing fluoride are effective at preventing tooth decay. Toothpastes may also help to control and remove plaque build-up, promoting healthy gums. A 2016 systematic review indicated that using toothpaste when brushing the teeth does not necessarily impact the level of plaque removal. However, the active ingredients in toothpastes are able to prevent dental diseases with regular use.

==Ingredients==
Toothpastes are derived from a variety of components, the three main ones being abrasives, fluoride, and detergent.

===Abrasives===
Abrasives constitute 8-20% of a typical toothpaste. These insoluble particles are designed to help remove plaque from the teeth. The removal of plaque inhibits the accumulation of tartar (calculus) helping to minimize the risk of gum disease. Representative abrasives include particles of aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3), calcium carbonate (CaCO3), magnesium carbonate (MgCO3), sodium bicarbonate, various calcium hydrogen phosphates, various silicas and zeolites, and hydroxyapatite (Ca5(PO4)3OH).

After the Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015, the use of microbeads in toothpaste has been discontinued in the US, however since 2015 the industry has shifted toward instead using FDA-approved &quot;rinse-off&quot; metallized-plastic glitter as their primary abrasive agent. Some brands contain powdered white mica, which acts as a mild abrasive, and also adds a cosmetic glittery shimmer to the paste. The polishing of teeth removes stains from tooth surfaces, but has not been shown to improve dental health over and above the effects of the removal of plaque and Calculus.

Abrasives, like the dental polishing agents used in dentists&#x27; offices, also cause a small amount of enamel erosion which is termed &quot;polishing&quot; action. The abrasive effect of toothpaste is indicated by its RDA value. Toothpastes with RDA values above 250 are potentially damaging to the surfaces of teeth. The American National Standards Institute and American Dental Association considers toothpastes with an RDA below 250 to be safe and effective for a lifetime of use.

===Fluorides===
Fluoride in various forms is the most popular and effective active ingredient in toothpaste to prevent cavities. Fluoride is present in small amounts in plants, animals, and some natural water sources. The additional fluoride in toothpaste has beneficial effects on the formation of dental enamel and bones. Sodium fluoride (NaF) is the most common source of fluoride, but stannous fluoride (SnF2), and sodium monofluorophosphate (Na2PO3F) are also used. At similar fluoride concentrations, toothpastes containing stannous fluoride have been shown to be more effective than toothpastes containing sodium fluoride for reducing the incidence of dental caries and dental erosion, as well as reducing gingivitis. Some stannous fluoride-containing toothpastes also contain ingredients that allow for better stain and calculus removal. A systematic review revealed stabilised stannous fluoride-containing toothpastes had a positive effect on the reduction of plaque, gingivitis and staining, with a significant reduction in calculus and halitosis compared to other toothpastes. Furthermore, numerous clinical trials have shown gluconate chelated stannous fluoride toothpastes possess superior protection against dental erosion and dentine hypersensitivity compared to other fluoride-containing and fluoride-free toothpastes.

Much of the toothpaste sold in the United States has 1,000 to 1,100 parts per million fluoride. In European countries, such as the UK or Greece, the fluoride content is often higher; a sodium fluoride content of 0.312% w/w (1,450 ppm fluoride) or stannous fluoride content of 0.454% w/w (1,100 ppm fluoride) is common. All of these concentrations are likely to prevent tooth decay, according to a 2019 Cochrane review. Concentrations below 1,000 ppm are not likely to be preventive, and the preventive effect increases with concentration. Clinical trials support the use of high fluoride (5,000 ppm fluoride) dentifrices, for prevention of root caries in elderly adults by reducing the amount of plaque accumulated, decreasing the number of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and possibly promoting calcium fluoride deposits to a higher degree than after the use of traditional fluoride containing dentifrices.

Most toothpaste products have a shelf life of about two years, after which the fluoride and antibacterial properties may become less effective. While expired toothpaste is generally safe to use, regulatory bodies like the FDA require expiration dates on fluoride-containing toothpaste to ensure optimal effectiveness.

===Surfactants===
Many, although not all, toothpastes contain sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) or related surfactants (detergents). SLS is found in many other personal care products as well, such as shampoo, and is mainly a foaming agent, which enables uniform distribution of toothpaste, improving its cleansing power.

===Other components===

====Antibacterial agents====
Triclosan, an antibacterial agent, is a common toothpaste ingredient in the United Kingdom. Triclosan or zinc chloride prevent gingivitis and, according to the American Dental Association, helps reduce tartar and bad breath. A 2006 review of clinical research concluded there was evidence for the effectiveness of 0.30% triclosan in reducing plaque and gingivitis. Another Cochrane review in 2013 has found that triclosan achieved a 22% reduction in plaque, and in gingivitis, a 48% reduction in bleeding gums. However, there was insufficient evidence to show a difference in fighting periodontitis and there was no evidence either of any harmful effects associated with the use of triclosan toothpastes for more than 3 years. The evidence relating to plaque and gingivitis was considered to be of moderate quality while for periodontitis was low quality. Recently, triclosan has been removed as an ingredient from well-known toothpaste formulations. This may be attributed to concerns about adverse effects associated with triclosan exposure. Triclosan use in cosmetics has been positively correlated with triclosan levels in human tissues, plasma and breast milk, and is considered to have potential neurotoxic effects. Long-term studies are needed to substantiate these concerns.

Chlorhexidine is another antimicrobial agent used in toothpastes; however, it is more commonly added in mouthwash products. Sodium laureth sulfate, a foaming agent, is a common toothpaste ingredient that also possesses some antimicrobial activities. There are also many commercial products available in the market containing different essential oils, herbal ingredients (e.g. chamomile, neem, chitosan, &quot;Aloe vera&quot;), and natural or plant extracts (e.g. hinokitiol). These ingredients are claimed by the manufacturers to fight plaque, bad breath and prevent gum disease. A 2020 systematic metareview found that herbal toothpastes are as effective as non-herbal toothpastes in reducing dental plaque at shorter period of follow-up (4 weeks). However, this evidence comes from low-quality studies.

The stannous (tin) ion, commonly added to toothpastes as stannous fluoride or stannous chloride, has been shown to have antibacterial effects in the mouth. Research has shown that stannous fluoride-containing toothpaste inhibits extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production in a multispecies biofilm greater than sodium fluoride-containing toothpaste. This is thought to contribute to a reduction in plaque and gingivitis when using stannous fluoride-containing toothpastes when compared to other toothpastes, and has been evidenced through numerous clinical trials. In addition to its antibacterial properties, stabilised stannous fluoride toothpastes have been shown to protect against dental erosion and dentine hypersensitivity, making it a multifunctional component in toothpaste formulations.

====Flavorants====
Toothpaste comes in a variety of colors and flavors, intended to encourage use of the product. The three most common flavorants are peppermint, spearmint, and wintergreen. Toothpaste flavored with peppermint-anise oil is popular in the Mediterranean region. These flavors are provided by the respective oils, e.g. peppermint oil. More exotic flavors include Anethole anise, apricot, bubblegum, cinnamon, fennel, lavender, neem, ginger, vanilla, lemon, orange, and pine. Alternatively, unflavored toothpastes exist.

====Remineralizing agents====
Chemical repair (remineralization) of early tooth decay is promoted naturally by saliva. However, this process can be enhanced by various remineralisation agents. Fluoride promotes remineralization, but is limited by bioavailable calcium. Casein phosphopeptide stabilised amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) is a toothpaste ingredient containing bioavailable calcium that has been widely researched to be the most clinically effective remineralization agent that enhances the action of saliva and fluoride. Peptide-based systems, hydroxyapatite nanocrystals and a variety of calcium phosphates have been advocated as remineralization agents; however, more clinical evidence is required to substantiate their effectiveness.
====Miscellaneous components====
Agents are added to suppress the tendency of toothpaste to dry into a powder. Included are various sugar alcohols, such as glycerol, sorbitol, or xylitol, or related derivatives, such as 1,2-propylene glycol and polyethyleneglycol. Strontium chloride or potassium nitrate is included in some toothpastes to reduce sensitivity. Two systemic meta-analysis reviews reported that arginine, and calcium sodium phosphosilicate – CSPS containing toothpastes are also effective in alleviating dentinal hypersensitivity respectively. Another randomized clinical trial found superior effects when both formulas were combined.

Sodium polyphosphate is added to minimize the formation of tartar.

Chlorohexidine mouthwash has been popular for its positive effect on controlling plaque and gingivitis, however, a systemic review studied the effects of Chlorhexidine toothpastes and found insufficient evidence to support its use, tooth surface discoloration was observed as a side effect upon using it, which is considered a negative side effect that can affect patients&#x27; compliance.

Sodium hydroxide, also known as lye or caustic soda, is listed as an inactive ingredient in some toothpaste, for example Colgate Total.

=== Xylitol ===
A systematic review reported two out of ten studies by the same authors on the same population showed toothpastes with xylitol as an ingredient were more effective at preventing dental caries in permanent teeth of children than toothpastes containing fluoride alone. Furthermore, xylitol has not been found to cause any harmful effects. However, further investigation into the efficacy of toothpastes containing xylitol is required as the currently available studies are of low quality and high risk of bias.

==Safety==
===Fluoride===
Fluoride-containing toothpaste can be acutely toxic if swallowed in large amounts, but instances are exceedingly rare and result from prolonged and excessive use of toothpaste (i.e. several tubes per week). Approximately 15 mg/kg body weight is the acute lethal dose, even though as small amount as 5 mg/kg may be fatal to some children.

The risk of using fluoride is low enough that the use of full-strength toothpaste (1350–1500 ppm fluoride) is advised for all ages. However, smaller volumes are used for young children, for example, a smear of toothpaste until three years old. A major concern of dental fluorosis is for children under 12 months ingesting excessive fluoride through toothpaste. Nausea and vomiting are also problems which might arise with topical fluoride ingestion.

===Diethylene glycol===
The inclusion of sweet-tasting but toxic diethylene glycol in Chinese-made toothpaste led to a recall in 2007 involving multiple toothpaste brands in several nations. The world outcry made Chinese officials ban the practice of using diethylene glycol in toothpaste.

===Triclosan===
Reports have suggested triclosan, an active ingredient in many kinds of toothpastes, can combine with chlorine in tap water to form chloroform. An animal study revealed the chemical might modify hormone regulation, and many other lab researches proved bacteria might be able to develop resistance to triclosan in a way which can help them to resist antibiotics also.

=== Polyethylene glycol – PEG ===
PEG is a common ingredient in some of the formulas of toothpastes; it is a hydrophilic polymer that acts as a dispersant in toothpastes. Also, it is used in many cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulas, for example: ointments, osmotic laxatives, some of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, other medications and household products. However, 37 cases of PEG hypersensitivity (delayed and immediate) to PEG-containing substances have been reported since 1977, suggesting that they have unrecognized allergenic potential.

===Miscellaneous issues and debates===
With the exception of toothpaste intended to be used on pets such as dogs and cats, and toothpaste used by astronauts, most toothpaste is not intended to be swallowed, and doing so may cause nausea or diarrhea. Tartar fighting toothpastes have been debated. Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) has been proposed to increase the frequency of mouth ulcers in some people, as it can dry out the protective layer of oral tissues, causing the underlying tissues to become damaged. In studies conducted by the university of Oslo on recurrent aphthous ulcers, it was found that SLS has a denaturing effect on the oral mucin layer, with high affinity for proteins, thereby increasing epithelial permeability. In a double-blind cross-over study, a significantly higher frequency of aphthous ulcers was demonstrated when patients brushed with an SLS-containing versus a detergent-free toothpaste. Also patients with Oral Lichen Planus who avoided SLS-containing toothpaste benefited.

===Alteration of taste perception===
After using toothpaste, orange juice and other fruit juices are known to have an unpleasant taste if consumed shortly afterwards. Sodium lauryl sulfate, used as a surfactant in toothpaste, alters taste perception. It can break down phospholipids that inhibit taste receptors for sweetness, giving food a bitter taste. In contrast, apples are known to taste more pleasant after using toothpaste. Distinguishing between the hypotheses that the bitter taste of orange juice results from stannous fluoride or from sodium lauryl sulfate is still an unresolved issue and it is thought that the menthol added for flavor may also take part in the alteration of taste perception when binding to lingual cold receptors.

===Whitening toothpastes===
Many toothpastes make whitening claims. Abrasion is the principal way that toothpaste removes stains, and toothpastes that are not marketed as whitening can still remove stains by abrasion. Some of these toothpastes contain peroxide, the same ingredient found in tooth bleaching gels. Whitening toothpaste cannot alter the natural color of teeth or reverse discoloration by penetrating surface stains or decay. To remove surface stains, whitening toothpaste may include abrasives to gently polish the teeth or additives such as sodium tripolyphosphate to break down or dissolve stains. When used twice a day, whitening toothpaste typically takes two to four weeks to make teeth appear whiter. Whitening toothpaste is generally safe for daily use, but excessive use might damage tooth enamel. A recent systematic review in 2017 concluded that nearly all dentifrices that are specifically formulated for tooth whitening were shown to have a beneficial effect in reducing extrinsic stains, irrespective of whether or not a chemical discoloration agent was added. However, the whitening process can permanently reduce the strength of the teeth, as the process scrapes away a protective outer layer of enamel.

===Herbal and natural toothpastes===

Herbal toothpastes are marketed to consumers who wish to avoid some of the artificial ingredients commonly found in regular toothpastes. The ingredients found in so-called natural toothpastes vary widely but often include baking soda, aloe, eucalyptus oil, myrrh, camomile, calendula, neem, toothbrush tree, plant extract (strawberry extract), and essential oils. Many herbal toothpastes do not contain fluoride or sodium lauryl sulfate.

A 2020 meta-analysis showed some evidence for the efficacy of herbal toothpaste, albeit from poor quality studies. According to a study by the Delhi Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research, many of the herbal toothpastes being sold in India were adulterated with nicotine.

Charcoal has also been incorporated in toothpaste formulas; however, there is no evidence to determine its safety and effectiveness, and the American Dental Association does not recommend its use.

== Government regulation ==
In the United States toothpaste is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a cosmetic, except for ingredients with a medical purpose, such as fluoride, which are regulated as drugs. Drugs require scientific studies and FDA approval in order to be legally marketed in the United States, but cosmetic ingredients do not require pre-approval, except for color additives. The FDA does have labelling and requirements and bans certain ingredients.

==Striped toothpaste==

Striped toothpaste was invented by Leonard Marraffino in 1955. The patent (US patent , issued 1957) was subsequently sold to Unilever, which marketed the novelty under the Stripe brand-name in the early 1960s. This was followed by the introduction of the Signal brand in Europe in 1965 (UK patent 813,514). Although Stripe was initially very successful, it never again achieved the 8% market share that it cornered during its second year.
Marraffino&#x27;s design, which remains in use for single-color stripes, is simple. The main material, usually white, sits at the crimp end of the toothpaste tube and makes up most of its bulk. A thin pipe, through which that carrier material will flow, descends from the nozzle to it. The stripe-material (this was red in Stripe) fills the gap between the carrier material and the top of the tube. The two materials are not in separate compartments, but they are sufficiently viscous that they will not mix. When pressure is applied to the toothpaste tube, the main material squeezes down the thin pipe to the nozzle. Simultaneously, the pressure applied to the main material causes pressure to be forwarded to the stripe material, which thereby issues out through small holes (in the side of the pipe) onto the main carrier material as it is passing those holes.

In 1990, Colgate-Palmolive was granted a patent (USPTO ) for two differently colored stripes. In this scheme, the inner pipe has a cone-shaped plastic guard around it, and about halfway up its length. Between the guard and the nozzle-end of the tube is a space for the material for one color, which issues out of holes in the pipe. On the other side of the guard is space for second stripe-material, which has its own set of holes.

In 2016, Colgate-Palmolive was granted a patent (USPTO ) for suitable sorts of differently colored toothpastes to be filled directly into tubes to produce a striped mix without any separate compartments. This required adjustment of the different components&#x27; behavior (rheology) so that stripes are produced when the tube is squeezed.

Striped toothpaste should not be confused with layered toothpaste. Layered toothpaste requires a multi-chamber design (e.g. USPTO ), in which two or three layers extrude out of the nozzle. This scheme, like that of pump dispensers (USPTO ), is more complicated (and thus, more expensive to manufacture) than either the Marraffino design or the Colgate designs.

The iconic depiction of a wave-shaped blob of toothpaste sitting on a toothbrush is called a &quot;nurdle&quot;.

===Tooth powder===
Tooth powders for use with toothbrushes came into general use in the 19th century in Britain. Most were homemade, with chalk, pulverized brick, or salt as ingredients. An 1866 Home Encyclopedia recommended pulverized charcoal, and cautioned that many patented tooth powders that were commercially marketed did more harm than good.

Arm &amp; Hammer marketed a baking soda-based toothpowder in the United States until approximately 2000, and Colgate currently markets toothpowder in India and other countries.

===Modern toothpaste===
An 18th-century American and British toothpaste recipe called for burned bread. Another formula around this time called for dragon&#x27;s blood (a resin), cinnamon, and burned alum.

In 1873 the Colgate company began the mass production of aromatic toothpaste in jars.
By 1900, a paste made of hydrogen peroxide and baking soda was recommended for use with toothbrushes. Pre-mixed toothpastes were first marketed in the 19th century, but did not surpass the popularity of tooth-powder until World War I.

Together with Willoughby D. Miller, Newell Sill Jenkins developed the first toothpaste containing disinfectants, branded as Kolynos. The name is a combination of two Greek words, meaning &quot;beautifier&quot; and &quot;disease preventer&quot;. Numerous attempts to produce the toothpaste by pharmacists in Europe proved uneconomic. After returning to the US, he continued experimenting with Harry Ward Foote (1875–1942), professor of chemistry at Sheffield Chemical Laboratory of Yale University. After 17 years of development of Kolynos and clinical trials, Jenkins retired and transferred the production and distribution to his son Leonard A. Jenkins, who brought the first toothpaste tubes on the market on April 13, 1908. Within a few years the company expanded in North America, Latin America, Europe and the Far East. A branch operation opened in London in 1909. In 1937, Kolynos was produced in 22 countries and sold in 88 countries. Kolynos has been sold mainly in South America and in Hungary. Colgate-Palmolive took over the production of American Home Products in 1995 at a cost of one billion US dollars.

Fluoride was first added to toothpastes in the 1890s. Tanagra, containing calcium fluoride as the active ingredient, was sold by Karl F. Toellner Company, of Bremen, Germany, based upon the early work of chemist Albert Deninger. An analogous invention by Roy Cross, of Kansas City, Missouri, was initially criticized by the American Dental Association (ADA) in 1937. Fluoride toothpastes developed in the 1950s received the ADA&#x27;s approval. To develop the first ADA-approved fluoride toothpaste, Procter &amp; Gamble started a research program in the early 1940s. In 1950, Procter &amp; Gamble developed a joint research project team headed by Joseph C. Muhler at Indiana University to study new toothpaste with fluoride. In 1955, Procter &amp; Gamble&#x27;s Crest launched its first clinically proven fluoride-containing toothpaste. On August 1, 1960, the ADA reported that &quot;Crest has been shown to be an effective anticavity (decay preventative) dentifrice that can be of significant value when used in a conscientiously applied program of oral hygiene and regular professional care.&quot;

In 1980, the Japanese company, Sangi Co., Ltd., launched APADENT, the world&#x27;s first remineralizing toothpaste to use a nano-form of hydroxyapatite, the main component of tooth enamel, rather than fluoride, to remineralize areas of mineral loss below the surface of tooth enamel (incipient caries lesions). After many years of laboratory experiments and field trials, its hydroxyapatite ingredient was approved as an active anti-caries agent by the Japanese Ministry of Health in 1993, and given the name Medical Hydroxyapatite to distinguish it from other forms of hydroxyapatite used in toothpaste, such as dental abrasives.

In 2006, BioRepair appeared in Europe with the first European toothpaste containing synthetic hydroxylapatite as an alternative to fluoride for the remineralization and reparation of tooth enamel. The &quot;biomimetic hydroxylapatite&quot; is intended to protect the teeth by creating a new layer of synthetic enamel around the tooth instead of hardening the existing layer with fluoride that chemically changes it into fluorapatite.

====Dispensing====
Toothpaste is usually dispensed via a collapsible tube or with a more rigid pump. Several traditional and innovative designs have been developed. The dispenser must be matched to the flow properties of the toothpaste. 
In 1880, Doctor Washington Sheffield of New London, CT manufactured toothpaste into a collapsible tube, Dr. Sheffield&#x27;s Creme Dentifrice. He had the idea after his son traveled to Paris and saw painters using paint from tubes. In York in 1896, Colgate-Palmolive Dental Cream was packaged in collapsible tubes imitating Sheffield. The original collapsible toothpaste tubes were made of lead.

<text>Nervous Breakdown is the debut EP by the American hardcore punk band Black Flag, released in January 1979 by SST Records. It was the label&#x27;s first release, and the only non-compilation release to feature Keith Morris on vocals.

==Recording==
The recording was financed by Greg Ginn with proceeds he had earned from his mail-order ham radio electronics business, Solid State Tuners (SST). Through Spot, then an apprentice engineer whom Ginn had already known from living in Hermosa Beach, California, the band found Media Art, a studio that had recently completed construction.

The recording was originally supposed to be released by Bomp! Records, but the band felt that the label was taking too long to put the record out. Eventually, the band took the master rights back, and Ginn put some more earnings from his ham radio business, located a pressing plant in the phone book, and co-founded SST Records with Black Flag bassist Chuck Dukowski, borrowing the label&#x27;s name from his business.

It is commonly misconstrued that Spot was the producer and engineer of &quot;Nervous Breakdown&quot;. In his sleeve notes for the 1982 outtakes anthology &quot;Everything Went Black&quot;, Spot pointed out that as an apprentice engineer, his involvement in the sessions was limited to setting up microphones during the tracking sessions, and doing rough mixes for the band to hear.

The initial pressing of &quot;Nervous Breakdown&quot; was 2,000 copies. Black Flag were able to use the record as &quot;a badge of legitimacy&quot; (according to Dukowski) to begin getting live gigs in the Los Angeles area.

Four other songs were completed during the recording, &quot;Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot;, &quot;White Minority&quot; and &quot;No Values&quot;, which were later released as part of the &quot;Everything Went Black&quot; compilation album.

==Release history==
The EP is still in print both in its original form (a 7&quot; vinyl EP), as a 5&quot; CD single, and as part of the anthology &quot;The First Four Years&quot;. It was also available at times as a 3&quot; CD single, a 10&quot; colored vinyl EP, and as part of the various artists compilation of SST singles, &quot;The 7 Inch Wonders of the World&quot;.

==Track listing==

<text>The Japanese tea ceremony (known as or lit. &#x27;Hot water for tea&#x27;) is a Japanese cultural activity involving the ceremonial preparation and presentation of , powdered green tea, the procedure of which is called . 

The term &quot;Japanese tea ceremony&quot; does not exist in the Japanese language. In Japanese the term is &quot;Sadō&quot; or &quot;Chadō&quot;, which literally translated means &quot;tea way&quot; and places the emphasis on the Tao (道). The English term &quot;Teaism&quot; was coined by Okakura Kakuzō to describe the unique worldview associated with Japanese way of tea as opposed to focusing just on the presentation aspect, which came across to the first western observers as ceremonial in nature.

In the 1500s, Sen no Rikyū revolutionized Japanese tea culture, essentially perfecting what is now known as the Japanese tea ceremony and elevating it to the status of an art form. He redefined the rules of the tea house, tea garden, utensils, and procedures of the tea ceremony with his own interpretation, introduced a much smaller and rustic, distorted ceramic tea bowls specifically for the tea ceremony, and perfected the tea ceremony based on the aesthetic sense of . 

Sen no Rikyū&#x27;s great-grandchildren founded the Omotesenke, Urasenke, and Mushakōjisenke schools of tea ceremony, and the tea ceremony spread not only to and the samurai class but also to the general public, leading to the establishment of various tea ceremony schools that continue to this day. 

Zen Buddhism was a primary influence in the development of the culture of Japanese tea. Shinto has also greatly influenced the Japanese tea ceremony. For example, the practice of purifying one&#x27;s hands and mouth before practicing the tea ceremony is influenced by the Shinto purification ritual of . The architectural style of the &quot;chashitsu&quot; and the gate that serves as the boundary between the tea garden and the secular world have been influenced by Shinto shrine architecture and the . 

Much less commonly, Japanese tea practice uses leaf tea, primarily , a practice known as .

Tea gatherings are classified as either an informal tea gathering () or a formal tea gathering (). A is a relatively simple course of hospitality that includes , thin tea, and perhaps a light meal. A is a much more formal gathering, usually including a full-course meal followed by confections, thick tea, and thin tea. A may last up to four hours.

== History ==

The first documented evidence of tea in Japan dates to the 9th century. It is found in an entry in the having to do with the Buddhist monk , who had brought some tea back to Japan on his return from Tang China. The entry states that Eichū personally prepared and served (tea beverage made by steeping tea leaves in hot water) to Emperor Saga, who was on an excursion in Karasaki (in present Shiga Prefecture) in 815. By imperial order in 816, tea plantations began to be cultivated in the Kinki region of Japan. However, the interest in tea in Japan faded after this.

In China, tea had already been known, according to legend, for more than three thousand years (though the earliest archaeological evidence of tea-drinking dates to the 2nd century BCE). The form of tea popular in China in Eichū&#x27;s time was – tea compressed into a nugget in the same manner as the tea is today. This then would be ground in a mortar, and the resulting ground tea mixed together with various other herbs and flavourings. The custom of drinking tea, first for medicinal, and then largely for pleasurable reasons, was already widespread throughout China. In the early 9th century, Chinese author Lu Yu wrote &quot;The Classic of Tea&quot;, a treatise on tea focusing on its cultivation and preparation. Lu Yu&#x27;s life had been heavily influenced by Buddhism, particularly the Zen–Chán Buddhist school. His ideas would have a strong influence in the development of the Japanese tea.

Around the end of the 12th century, the style of tea preparation called , in which powdered was placed into a bowl, hot water added, and the tea and hot water whipped together, was introduced to Japan by Buddhist monk Eisai on his return from China. He also took tea seeds back with him, which eventually produced tea that was considered to be the most superb quality in all of Japan. This powdered green tea was first used in religious rituals in Buddhist monasteries. By the 13th century, when the Kamakura shogunate ruled the nation and tea and the luxuries associated with it became a kind of status symbol among the warrior class, there arose parties wherein contestants could win extravagant prizes for guessing the best quality tea – that was grown in Kyoto, deriving from the seeds that Eisai brought from China.

The next major period in Japanese history was the Muromachi period, pointing to the rise of , centered around the cultural world of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu and his villa in the northern hills of Kyoto (Kinkaku-ji), and later during this period, the rise of Higashiyama culture, centered around the elegant cultural world of Ashikaga Yoshimasa and his retirement villa in the eastern hills of Kyoto (Ginkaku-ji). This period, approximately 1336 to 1573, saw the budding of what is generally regarded as Japanese traditional culture as it is known today.

The use of Japanese tea developed as a &quot;transformative practice&quot; and began to evolve its own aesthetic, in particular that of principles. represents the inner, or spiritual, experiences of human lives. Its original meaning indicated quiet or sober refinement, or subdued taste &quot;characterized by humility, restraint, simplicity, naturalism, profundity, imperfection, and asymmetry&quot; and &quot;emphasizes simple, unadorned objects and architectural space, and celebrates the mellow beauty that time and care impart to materials.&quot; 

, on the other hand, represents the outer, or material side of life. Originally, it meant &quot;worn&quot;, &quot;weathered&quot;, or &quot;decayed&quot;. Particularly among the nobility, understanding emptiness was considered the most effective means to spiritual awakening, while embracing imperfection was honoured as a reminder to cherish one&#x27;s unpolished and unfinished nature – considered to be the first step to , or enlightenment. 
Central are the concepts of &quot;omotenashi&quot;, which revolves around hospitality.

Murata Jukō is known in history as an early developer of tea as a spiritual practice. He studied Zen under the monk Ikkyū, who revitalized Zen in the 15th century, and this is considered to have influenced his concept of .

By the 16th century, tea drinking had spread to all levels of society in Japan. Sen no Rikyū and his work &quot;Southern Record&quot;, perhaps the best-known – and still revered – historical figure in tea, followed his master Takeno Jōō&#x27;s concept of , a philosophy that each meeting should be treasured, for it can never be reproduced. His teachings perfected many newly developed forms in architecture and gardens, art, and the full development of the &quot;way of tea&quot;. The principles he set forward – , , , and – are still central to tea.

Sen no Rikyū was the leading teamaster of the regent Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who greatly supported him in codifying and spreading the way of tea, also as a means of solidifying his own political power. Hideyoshi&#x27;s tastes were influenced by his teamaster, but nevertheless he also had his own ideas to cement his power such as constructing the Golden Tea Room and hosting the Grand Kitano Tea Ceremony in 1587. The symbiotic relationship between politics and tea was at its height. However, it was increasingly at odds with the rustic and simple aesthetics continuously advertised by his tea master, which the regent increasingly saw as a threat to cementing his own power and position, and their once close relationship began to suffer. 

In 1590, one of the leading disciples of Rikyu, Yamanoue Sōji, was brutally executed on orders of the regent. One year later the regent ordered his teamaster to commit ritual suicide. The way of tea was never so closely intertwined with politics before or after. After the death of Rikyū, essentially three schools descended from him to continue the tradition. The way of tea continued to spread throughout the country and later developed not only from the court and samurai class, but also towards the townspeople. Many schools of Japanese tea ceremony have evolved through the long history of and are active today.

==Venues==

Japanese tea ceremonies are typically conducted in specially constructed spaces or rooms designed for the purpose of tea ceremony. While a purpose-built -floored room is considered the ideal venue, any place where the necessary implements for the making and serving of the tea can be set out and where the host can make the tea in the presence of the seated guest(s) can be used as a venue for tea. For instance, a tea gathering can be held picnic-style in the outdoors, known as . For this occasion a red parasol called is used. 

A purpose-built room designed for the style of tea is called a , and is ideally 4.5- in floor area. A purpose-built typically has a low ceiling, a hearth built into the floor, an alcove for hanging scrolls and placing other decorative objects, and separate entrances for host and guests. It also has an attached preparation area known as a .

A 4.5-mat room is considered standard, but smaller and larger rooms are also used. Building materials and decorations are deliberately simple and rustic in style tea rooms. can also refer to free-standing buildings for tea. Known in English as tea houses, such structures may contain several tea rooms of different sizes and styles, dressing and waiting rooms, and other amenities, and be surrounded by a tea garden called a .

==Seasons==
Seasonality and the changing of the seasons are considered important for enjoyment of tea and tea ceremony. Traditionally, tea practitioners divide the year into two main seasons: the season, constituting the colder months (traditionally November to April), and the season, constituting the warmer months (traditionally May to October).

For each season, there are variations in the performed and utensils and other equipment used. Ideally, the configuration of the in a 4.5 mat room changes with the season as well.

During the sunken hearth season, the Chajin opens the sunken hearth in the middle of the tea room. Water is heated using the sunken hearth. The sunken hearth is the only form of heat in the room during the winter. During the brazier season, water is heated in a raised brazier. The weather determines the exact time to use the sunken hearth or brazier. During the time of year when the brazier does not provide enough heat to the room for the guests to be warm, but the hearth was too warm, the Chajin could cover the hearth with the lid, and put the brazier on top of it.

The location of the hearth or brazier is the biggest change between seasons, however, there are many other changes that are made, such as the incense, utensils, and clothing worn. During the winter, a type of incense known as Neriko, a type of incense that is formed into pellets, is used. Jin or Byakudan are used in the summer, and during the end of spring or the beginning of autumn, the Chajin puts out Kokukobei or Umegako. Guests drink tea from a more cylindrical style of bowl in the winter to keep in heat, and use a flat bowl in the summer to release heat. Different designs are depicted on the tea bowl based on the season. During the summer, participants wear a kimono made up of one layer to ensure that it is not too hot. However, outside the summer, participants wear a double-layered kimono so they will be warmer.

==Thick and thin tea==
There are two main ways of preparing for tea consumption: and , with the best quality tea leaves used in preparing thick tea. Historically, the tea leaves used as packing material for the leaves in the would be served as thin tea. Japanese historical documents about tea that differentiate between and first appear in the Tenmon era (1532–1555). The first documented appearance of the term is in 1575.

As the terms imply, is a thick blend of matcha and hot water that requires about three times as much tea to the equivalent amount of water than . To prepare , and hot water are whipped using the , while is kneaded with the whisk to smoothly blend the large amount of powdered tea with the water.

The host serves thin tea to each guest in an individual bowl, while one bowl of thick tea is shared among several guests. This style of sharing a bowl of first appeared in historical documents in 1586, and is a method considered to have been invented by Sen no Rikyū.

The most important part of a is the preparation and drinking of , which is followed by . A may involve only the preparation and serving of thin tea (and accompanying confections), representing the more relaxed, finishing portion of a .

== Equipment ==

The equipment for tea ceremony is called . A wide range of is available and different styles and motifs are used for different events and in different seasons. All the tools for tea are handled with exquisite care, being scrupulously cleaned before and after each use and before storing, with some handled only with gloved hands. Some items, such as the tea storage jar which has the name , are so revered that, historically, they were given proper names like people, and were admired and documented by multiple diarists. The honorary title is given to the ten artisans that provide the utensils for the events held by the three primary Schools of Japanese tea known as the .

Some of the more essential components of tea ceremony are:






== Procedures ==
 
Procedures vary from school to school, and with the time of year, time of day, venue, and other considerations. The noon tea gathering of one host and a maximum of five guests is considered the most formal . The following is a general description of a noon held in the cool weather season at a purpose-built tea house.

The guests arrive a little before the appointed time and enter an interior waiting room, where they store unneeded items such as coats, and put on fresh socks. Ideally, the waiting room has a floor and an alcove (), in which is displayed a hanging scroll which may allude to the season, the theme of the , or some other appropriate theme.

The guests are served a cup of the hot water, tea, roasted barley tea, or . When all the guests have arrived and finished their preparations, they proceed to the outdoor waiting bench in the , where they remain until summoned by the host.

Following a silent bow between host and guests, the guests proceed in order to a (stone basin) where they ritually purify themselves by washing their hands and rinsing their mouths with water, and then continue along the to the tea house. They remove their footwear and enter the tea room through a small &quot;crawling-in&quot; door (), and proceed to view the items placed in the and any tea equipment placed ready in the room, and are then seated -style on the in order of prestige.

When the last guest has taken their place, they close the door with an audible sound to alert the host, who enters the tea room and welcomes each guest, and then answers questions posed by the first guest about the scroll and other items.

The begins in the cool months with the laying of the charcoal fire which is used to heat the water. Following this, guests are served a meal in several courses accompanied by and followed by a small sweet () eaten from special paper called , which each guest carries, often in a decorative wallet or tucked into the breast of the kimono. After the meal, there is a break called a during which the guests return to the waiting shelter until summoned again by the host, who uses the break to sweep the tea room, take down the scroll and replace it with a flower arrangement, open the tea room&#x27;s shutters, and make preparations for serving the tea.

Having been summoned back to the tea room by the sound of a bell or gong rung in prescribed ways, the guests again purify themselves and examine the items placed in the tea room. The host then enters, ritually cleanses each utensil – including the tea bowl, whisk, and tea scoop – in the presence of the guests in a precise order and using prescribed motions, and places them in an exact arrangement according to the particular procedure being performed. When the preparation of the utensils is complete, the host prepares thick tea.

Bows are exchanged between the host and the guest receiving the tea. The guest then bows to the second guest, and raises the bowl in a gesture of respect to the host. The guest rotates the bowl to avoid drinking from its front, takes a sip, and compliments the host on the tea. After taking a few sips, the guest wipes clean the rim of the bowl and passes it to the second guest. The procedure is repeated until all guests have taken tea from the same bowl; each guest then has an opportunity to admire the bowl before it is returned to the host, who then cleanses the equipment and leaves the tea room.

The host then rekindles the fire and adds more charcoal. This signifies a change from the more formal portion of the gathering to the more casual portion, and the host will return to the tea room to bring in a and more confections, usually , to accompany the thin tea, and possibly cushions for the guests&#x27; comfort.

The host will then proceed with the preparation of an individual bowl of thin tea to be served to each guest. While in earlier portions of the gathering conversation is limited to a few formal comments exchanged between the first guest and the host, in the portion, after a similar ritual exchange, the guests may engage in casual conversation.

After all the guests have taken tea, the host cleans the utensils in preparation for putting them away. The guest of honour will request that the host allow the guests to examine some of the utensils, and each guest in turn examines each item, including the tea caddy and the tea scoop. (This examination is done to show respect and admiration for the host.) The items are treated with extreme care and reverence as they may be priceless, irreplaceable, handmade antiques, and guests often use a special brocaded cloth to handle them.

The host then collects the utensils, and the guests leave the tea house. The host bows from the door, and the gathering is over. A tea gathering can last up to four hours, depending on the type of occasion performed, the number of guests, and the types of meal and tea served.

== Types ==

Every action in – how a kettle is used, how a teacup is examined, how tea is scooped into a cup – is performed in a very specific way, and may be thought of as a procedure or technique. The procedures performed in are known collectively as . The act of performing these procedures during a is called &quot;doing &quot;.

There are many styles of , depending upon the school, occasion, season, setting, equipment, and countless other possible factors. The following is a short, general list of common types of .
 is so called because the equipment is removed from and then replaced into a special box known as a . developed as a convenient way to prepare the necessary equipment for making tea outdoors. The basic equipment contained in the are the tea bowl, tea whisk (kept in a special container), tea scoop and tea caddy, and linen wiping cloth in a special container, as well as a container for little candy-like sweets. Many of the items are smaller than usual, to fit in the box. This gathering takes approximately 35–40 minutes.

 is so called because, except for the hot water kettle (and brazier if a sunken hearth is not being used), the essential items for the tea-making, including even the fresh water container, are carried into the tea room by the host as a part of the . In other , the water jar and perhaps other items, depending upon the style of , are placed in the tea room before the guests enter.
, , or is a simple procedure for making (thin tea). The tea bowl, tea whisk, tea scoop, and tea caddy are placed on a tray, and the hot water is prepared in a kettle called a , which is heated on a brazier. This is usually the first learned, and is the easiest to perform, requiring neither much specialized equipment nor a lot of time to complete. It may easily be done sitting at a table, or outdoors, using a thermos pot in place of the and portable hearth.
In the style, the tea is prepared with the host seated on a chair at a special table, and the guests also seated on chairs at tables. It is possible, therefore, for -style to be conducted nearly anywhere, even outdoors. The name refers to the host&#x27;s practice of performing the first and last bows while standing. In there is usually an assistant who sits near the host and moves the host&#x27;s seat out of the way as needed for standing or sitting. The assistant also serves the tea and sweets to the guests. This procedure originated in the Urasenke school, initially for serving non-Japanese guests who, it was thought, would be more comfortable sitting on chairs.

== Essential elements ==
=== Tea room ===
The Japanese traditional floor mats, , are used in various ways in tea offerings. Their placement, for example, determines how a person walks through the tea room , and the different seating positions.

The use of flooring has influenced the development of tea. For instance, when walking on it is customary to shuffle, to avoid causing disturbance. Shuffling forces one to slow down, to maintain erect posture, and to walk quietly, and helps one to maintain balance as the combination of and makes for a slippery surface; it is also a function of wearing kimono, which restricts stride length. One must avoid walking on the joins between mats, one practical reason being that that would tend to damage the . Therefore, tea students are taught to step over such joins when walking in the tea room.

The placement of in tea rooms differs slightly from the normal placement in regular Japanese-style rooms, and may also vary by season (where it is possible to rearrange the mats). In a 4.5 mat room, the mats are placed in a circular pattern around a centre mat. Purpose-built tea rooms have a sunken hearth in the floor which is used in winter. A special is used which has a cut-out section providing access to the hearth. In summer, the hearth is covered either with a small square of extra , or, more commonly, the hearth is replaced with a full mat, totally hiding the hearth.

It is customary to avoid stepping on this centre mat whenever possible, as well as to avoid placing the hands palm-down on it, as it functions as a kind of table: tea utensils are placed on it for viewing, and prepared bowls of tea are placed on it for serving to the guests. To avoid stepping on it people may walk around it on the other mats, or shuffle on the hands and knees.

Except when walking, when moving about on the tatami one places one&#x27;s closed fists on the mats and uses them to pull oneself forward or push backwards while maintaining a position.

There are dozens of real and imaginary lines that crisscross any tearoom. These are used to determine the exact placement of utensils and myriad other details; when performed by skilled practitioners, the placement of utensils will vary minutely from gathering to gathering. The are used as one guide for placement, and the joins serve as a demarcation indicating where people should sit.

 provide a more comfortable surface for sitting -style. At certain times of year (primarily during the new year&#x27;s festivities) the portions of the where guests sit may be covered with a red felt cloth.

===Hanging scroll===
Calligraphy, mainly in the form of hanging scrolls, plays a central role in tea. Scrolls, often written by famous calligraphers or Buddhist monks, are hung in the (scroll alcove) of the tea room. They are selected for their appropriateness for the occasion, including the season and the theme of the particular get-together. Calligraphic scrolls may feature well-known sayings, particularly those associated with Buddhism, poems, descriptions of famous places, or words or phrases associated with tea.

Historian and author Haga Kōshirō points out that it is clear from the teachings of Sen no Rikyū recorded in the that the suitability of any particular scroll for a tea gathering depends not only on the subject of the writing itself but also on the virtue of the writer. Haga points out that Rikyū preferred to hang (&quot;ink traces&quot;), the calligraphy of Zen Buddhist priests, in the tea room. A typical example of a hanging scroll in a tea room might have the kanji , expressing the four key principles of the Way of Tea. Some contain only a single character; in summer, would be appropriate. Hanging scrolls that feature a painting instead of calligraphy, or a combination of both, are also used. Scrolls are sometimes placed in the waiting room as well.

===Flower arrangement===
 (literally &quot;tea flower&quot;) is the simple style of flower arrangement used in tea rooms. has its roots in , an older style of Japanese flower arranging, which itself has roots in Shinto and Buddhism.

It evolved from the &quot;free-form&quot; style of called , which was used by early tea masters. is said, depending upon the source, to have been either developed or championed by Sen no Rikyū. He is said to have taught that should give the viewer the same impression that those flowers naturally would give if they were still growing outdoors, in nature.

Unnatural or out-of-season materials are never used, as well as props and other devices. The containers in which are arranged are referred to generically as . arrangements typically comprise few items, and little or no filler material. In the summer, when many flowering grasses are in season in Japan, however, it is seasonally appropriate to arrange a number of such flowering grasses in an airy basket-type container. Unlike (which often uses shallow, wide dishes), tall, narrow are frequently used in . The containers for the flowers used in tea rooms are typically made from natural materials such as bamboo, as well as metal or ceramic, but rarely glass as (another flower arrangement) uses short, glass vases.

 arrangements are so simple that frequently no more than a single blossom is used; this blossom will invariably lean towards or face the guests.

===Meal===

 or is a meal served in the context of a formal tea function. In , only fresh seasonal ingredients are used, prepared in ways that aim to enhance their flavour. Great care is taken in selecting ingredients and types of food, and the finished dishes are carefully presented on serving ware that is chosen to enhance the appearance and seasonal theme of the meal. Dishes are intricately arranged and garnished, often with real edible leaves and flowers that are to help enhance the flavour of the food. Serving ware and garnishes are as much a part of the experience as the food; some might argue that the aesthetic experience of seeing the food is even more important than the physical experience of eating it.

Courses are served in small servings in individual dishes. Each diner has a small lacquered tray to themselves; very important people may be provided their own low, lacquered table or several small tables.

Because generally follows traditional eating habits in Japan, meat dishes are rare.

===Clothing===


Many of the movements and components of tea ceremonies evolved from the wearing of &quot;kimono&quot;. For example, certain movements are designed to keep dangling sleeves out of the way or prevent them from becoming dirty. Other motions allow for the straightening of the &quot;kimono&quot; and the .

Some aspects of tea ceremony – such as the use of silk cloths – cannot be performed without wearing a &quot;kimono&quot; and , or a belt substitute, as the cloth is folded and tucked into the within the ceremony. Other items, such as , smaller cloths known as , and fans, require &quot;kimono&quot; collars, sleeves and the worn with them in order to be used throughout the ceremony; otherwise, a substitute for storing these items on the person must be found.

For this reason, most tea ceremonies are conducted in &quot;kimono&quot;, and though students may practice wearing Western clothes, students of tea ceremony will need to wear &quot;kimono&quot; at some point. On formal occasions, the host of the tea ceremony will always wear &quot;kimono&quot;, and for guests, formal &quot;kimono&quot; or Western formal wear must be worn. No matter the style of clothing, the attire worn at a tea gathering is usually subdued and conservative, so as not to be distracting.

For women, the type of &quot;kimono&quot; worn is usually an – a solid-colour, unpatterned &quot;kimono&quot;, worn with a in an appropriate fabric; slub-weave silks, patterns and generally bright-coloured are not worn. kimono may also be worn, as their patterns are small enough as to be unobtrusive.

Men may wear &quot;kimono&quot; only, or (for more formal occasions) a combination of &quot;kimono&quot; and (a long, divided or undivided skirt worn over the &quot;kimono&quot;). Those who have earned the right may wear a &quot;kimono&quot; with a or jacket instead of .

Women wear various styles of &quot;kimono&quot; depending on the season and the event; women generally do not wear for tea occasions, and do not gain the right to wear a .

Lined &quot;kimono&quot; are worn by both men and women in the winter months, and unlined &quot;kimono&quot; are worn in the summer. For formal occasions, (&quot;kimono&quot; with three to five family crests on the sleeves and back) are worn. Both men and women wear white (divided-toe socks).

== Schools ==

In Japan, those who wish to study tea ceremony typically join a &quot;circle&quot;, a generic term for a group that meets regularly to participate in a given activity. There are also tea clubs at many junior and high schools, colleges and universities.

Classes may be held at community centres, dedicated tea schools, or at private homes. Tea schools often teach a wide variety of pupils who may study at different times; for example, the school may have a group for women, a group for older students, and a group for younger students. Students normally pay a monthly fee which covers tuition and the use of the school&#x27;s (or teacher&#x27;s) bowls and other equipment, the tea itself, and the sweets that students serve and eat at every class. Students must be equipped with their own , fan, paper, and , as well as their own wallet in which to place these items. 

Though some groups and practitioners of tea ceremony may wear Western clothing, for most occasions of tea ceremony – particularly if the teacher is highly ranked within the tradition – wearing kimono is mostly considered essential, in particular for women. In some cases, advanced students may be given permission to wear the school&#x27;s mark in place of the usual family crests on formal kimono. This permission usually accompanies the granting of a , or &quot;tea name&quot;, to the student.

New students typically begin by observing more advanced students as they practice. New students may be taught mostly by more advanced students; the most advanced students are taught exclusively by the teacher. The first things new students learn are how to correctly open and close sliding doors, how to walk on tatami, how to enter and exit the tea room, how to bow and to whom and when to do so, how to wash, store and care for the various equipment, how to fold the , how to ritually clean tea equipment, and how to wash and fold . As they master these essential steps, students are also taught how to behave as a guest at tea ceremonies: the correct words to say, how to handle bowls, how to drink tea and eat sweets, how to use paper and sweet-picks, and myriad other details.

As they master the basics, students will be instructed on how to prepare the powdered tea for use, how to fill the tea caddy, and finally, how to measure the tea and water and whisk it to the proper consistency. Once these basic steps have been mastered, students begin to practice the simplest , typically beginning with . Only when the first offering has been mastered will students move on. Study is through observation and hands on practice; students do not often take notes, and many teachers discourage the practice of note-taking.

As they master each offering, some schools and teachers present students with certificates at a formal ceremony. According to the school, this certificate may warrant that the student has mastered a given , or may give the student permission to begin studying a given . Acquiring such certificates is often very costly; the student typically must not only pay for the preparation of the certificate itself and for participating in the gathering during which it is bestowed, but is also expected to thank the teacher by presenting him or her with a gift of money. The cost of acquiring certificates increases as the student&#x27;s level increases.

Typically, each class ends with the whole group being given brief instruction by the main teacher, usually concerning the contents of the (the scroll alcove, which typically features a hanging scroll (usually with calligraphy), a flower arrangement, and occasionally other objects as well) and the sweets that have been served that day. Related topics include incense and kimono, or comments on seasonal variations in equipment or offerings.


Like the formal traditions of , there are formal traditions of , distinguished as , typically involving the high-grade class of . This offering, more Chinese in style, was introduced to Japan in the 17th century by Ingen, the founder of the Ōbaku school of Zen Buddhism, also more Chinese in style than earlier schools. In the 18th century, it was popularized by the Ōbaku monk Baisao, who sold tea in Kyoto, and later came to be regarded as the first master. It remains associated with the Ōbaku school, and the head temple of Manpuku-ji hosts regular tea conventions.

<doc id="147739" wikidata="Q193638" url="?curid=147739" title="Shibuya">
<text>is a special ward in Tokyo, Japan. A major commercial center, Shibuya houses two of the busiest railway stations in the world, Shibuya Station and Shinjuku Station. 

As of January 1, 2024, Shibuya Ward has an estimated population of 230,609 in 142,443 households and a population density of . The total area is . Notable neighborhoods and districts of Shibuya include Harajuku, Ebisu, Omotesandō, Yoyogi and Sendagaya.

Shibuya came into the possession of the Shibuya clan in the early 1160s, after which the area was named. The branch of the clan that ruled this area was defeated by the Later Hōjō clan on 13 January 1524, during the Sengoku period, and the area then came under their control. During the Edo period, Shibuya, particularly Maruyamachō on Dōgenzaka, prospered as a town on Oyama Road (present-day Route 246), and in the Meiji era, as a Hanamachi. Shibuya emerged as a railway terminus during the expansion of the railway network beginning in the 19th century, and was incorporated as a ward in the City of Tokyo on 1 October 1932.

Shibuya, once a mediocre area developed around the railway terminus, overtook Shinjuku as a hub for youth culture in the 1970s. The coinciding competition between Seibu (whose most notable development projects include Shibuya Parco) and Tokyu (Tokyu Hands,Shibuya 109) to develop the area as a commercial center added to its appeal to young people, which in turn spread to other neighborhoods in the ward, such as Harajuku.

==History==

Shibuya came into the possession of the Shibuya clan in the early 1160s, after which the area was named. The clan was a cadet branch of the Taira clan descended from Taira no Yoshifumi. The clan built a fortress near the present-day Konnō Hachimangu Shrine. The branch of the clan that ruled this area was defeated by the Later Hōjō clan on 13 January 1524, during the Sengoku period, and the area then came under their control. During the Edo period, Shibuya, particularly Maruyamachō on Dōgenzaka, prospered as a town on Oyama Road (present-day Route 246), and in the Meiji era, as a Hanamachi.

The village of Shibuya was incorporated in 1889 by the merger of the villages of Kami-Shibuya, Naka-Shibuya and Shimo-Shibuya within Minami-Toshima County (Toyotama County from 1896). The village covered the territory of modern-day Shibuya Station area as well as the Hiroo, Daikanyama, Aoyama, and Ebisu areas. Shibuya became a town in 1909. The town of Shibuya merged with the neighboring towns of Sendagaya (which included the modern Senda, Harajuku and Jingumae areas) and Yoyohata (which included the modern Yoyogi and Hata areas) to form Shibuya-ku suburban ward upon being absorbed into Tokyo City in 1932. Shibuya became an urban special ward under the Local Autonomy Act in 1947.

The Tokyu Toyoko Line opened in 1932, making Shibuya a key terminal between Tokyo and Yokohama, and was joined by the forerunner of the Keio Inokashira Line in 1933 and the forerunner of the Tokyo Metro Ginza Line in 1938. The story of Hachikō, a dog who waited for his deceased master at Shibuya Station every day from 1923 to 1935, created a national sensation due to his unwavering loyalty. A statue of Hachikō was built adjacent to the station, and the surrounding Hachikō Square is now one of the most popular meeting points in the area.

During the occupation of Japan, Yoyogi Park was used as a housing compound for U.S. personnel known as &quot;Washington Heights&quot;. The U.S. military left in 1964, and much of the park was repurposed as venues for the 1964 Summer Olympics. The ward itself served as part of the athletics 50 km walk and marathon course during the 1964 games.

In the mid-1990s, Shibuya-kei, a microgenre of pop music, became mainstream in Japan. Distinguished by a &quot;cut-and-paste&quot; approach, it peaked in the late 1990s and declined after its principal players began moving onto other music styles.

Shibuya Stream, a skyscraper and retail complex, was completed in 2018. The East Wing of a mixed-used skyscraper, Shibuya Scramble Square, was completed in August 2019. A shopping mall, Shibuya Fukuras, was completed in October 2019.

Miyashita Park closed in 2017 and reopened in July 2020 as a shopping complex with a rooftop park.

==Geography==

Shibuya includes many well-known commercial and residential districts such as Daikanyama, Ebisu, Harajuku, Hiroo, Higashi, Omotesandō, Sendagaya, and Yoyogi.

===Districts===
* Hatagaya Area:
** Sasazuka, Hatagaya, Honmachi

* Hikawa-Shimbashi Area:
** Shibuya, Higashi, Ebisu, Hiroo

== Demographics ==
Per Japanese census data, the population is rising again after decline between 1960 and 2000.

==Politics and government==
Shibuya is run by a city assembly of 34 elected members. The mayor is Ken Hasebe, an independent.

===Elections===
* 2003 Shibuya mayoral election

=== Same-sex partnership certificate ===
In 2015, as the council passed &quot;Ordinance for Promoting Respect of Gender Equality and Diversity in the Ward&quot;, Shibuya Ward became the first Japanese municipality that issues same-sex partnership certificates. According to this ordinance, same-sex couples who live in Shibuya are allowed &quot;to rent apartments together, and have gained hospital visitation rights as family members&quot;. The ordinance was intended to bring three benefits to same-sex couples: &quot;(1) rental housing within the ward (co-signing of tenancy agreements for municipal/public housing), (2) medical institutions within the ward (hospital visitation and medical decision-making rights as family members), and (3) employment conditions within the ward (e.g. family benefits, congratulations and condolence leave)&quot;. In order to apply for the certificate, couples must be 20-years-old or older residents of Shibuya Ward and have to state that &quot;their relationship is based on love and mutual trust&quot; in a notarized document. Koyuki Higashi (a former member of the Takarazuka Revue) and Hiroko Masuhara (an entrepreneur), a lesbian couple, were the first to receive this certification. Since the Shibuya Ward passed the ordinance, seven other municipalities in Japan have begun offering similar certificates.

The BBC notes that in practice, the ordinance is not binding, though their names will be posted on the ward&#x27;s website if they violate the ordinance. Shimizu says the system &quot;is not equivalent to marriage, as it does not accord same-sex couples the same rights as heterosexual couples when it comes to inheritance, joint filing of taxes, or social welfare&quot;. As it requires at least a hundred thousand yen to apply for the certificate, it can be restrictive to some couples. Shimizu argues that Shibuya Ward has been criticized for pinkwashing as &quot;while passing this ordinance, the administration also moved to expel the homeless in Miyashita Park and other parks in the ward&quot;. Pointing out that the mayor of Shibuya Ward in an interview stated that this is not a matter of human rights, but of diversity, Yuri Horie claimed that the term of diversity seems to be used to divide citizens into the good and the bad; it raises only the ones who contribute to the consumeristic society as representer of &quot;diversity of sexuality&quot; while excluding the useless ones. Yuki Tsuchiya, a lesbian activist, also argues that LGBT individuals are used to promote the ward.

==Sightseeing and local landmarks==

Shibuya is famous for its scramble crossing, called Shibuya Crossing. It is located in front of the Shibuya Station Hachikō exit and stops vehicles in all directions to allow pedestrians to inundate the entire intersection. Shibuya Crossing is the &quot;world&#x27;s busiest pedestrian crossing&quot;, with upwards of 3,000 people at a time. A statue of the dog Hachikō, remembered for his unwavering loyalty to his deceased owner, is installed outside Shibuya Station. The statue and its surrounding Hachikō Square are a common meeting place and are almost always crowded. On the southwest side of Shibuya Station, there is a Moyai statue, given to Shibuya by the people of Niijima Island in 1980.

<text>James Harold Doolittle (December 14, 1896 – September 27, 1993) was an American military general and aviation pioneer who received the Medal of Honor for his raid on Japan during World War II, known as the Doolittle Raid in his honor. He made early coast-to-coast flights and record-breaking speed flights, won many flying races, and helped develop and flight-test instrument flying. According to the US FAA, he was the first pilot ever to perform a successful instrument flight.

Doolittle grew up in Nome, Alaska. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1922. That year, he made the first cross-country flight in an Airco DH.4, and in 1925, was awarded a doctorate in aeronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the first such doctorate degree issued in the United States. In 1927, he performed the first outside loop, thought at the time to be a fatal aerobatic maneuver, and two years later, in 1929, pioneered the use of &quot;blind flying&quot;, where a pilot relies on flight instruments alone, which later won him the Harmon Trophy and made all-weather airline operations practical.

Doolittle was a flying instructor during World War I and a reserve officer in the United States Army Air Corps, but was recalled to active duty during World War II. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for personal valor and leadership as commander of the Doolittle Raid, a bold long-range retaliatory air raid on some of the Japanese main islands on April 18, 1942, four months after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The raid used 16 B-25B Mitchell medium bombers with reduced armament to decrease weight and increase range, each with a crew of five and no escort fighter aircraft. It was a major morale booster for the United States and Doolittle was celebrated as a hero, making him one of the most important national figures of the war.

Doolittle was promoted to lieutenant general and commanded the Twelfth Air Force over North Africa, the Fifteenth Air Force over the Mediterranean, and the Eighth Air Force over Europe. He retired from the Air Force in 1959 but remained active in many technical fields. Doolittle was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1967, eight years after retirement and only five years after the Hall was founded. He was eventually promoted to general in 1985, presented to him by President Ronald Reagan 43 years after the Doolittle Raid. In 2003, he topped &quot;Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the greatest pilots of all time, and ten years later, &quot;Flying&quot; magazine ranked Doolittle sixth on its list of the 51 Heroes of Aviation. He died in 1993 at the age of 96, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Early life and education==
Doolittle was born December 14, 1896, in Alameda, California. He spent his youth in Nome, Alaska, where he earned a reputation as a boxer. His parents were Frank Henry Doolittle and Rosa (Rose) Cerenah Doolittle (). By 1910, Jimmy Doolittle was attending school in Los Angeles. When his school attended the 1910 Los Angeles International Air Meet at Dominguez Field, Doolittle saw his first airplane.

He attended Los Angeles City College after graduating from Manual Arts High School, together with later film director Frank Capra, in Los Angeles. He entered the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied at the College of Mines. He was a member of Theta Kappa Nu fraternity, which later merged into Lambda Chi Alpha during the later stages of the Great Depression.

==Military career==

Doolittle took a leave of absence in October 1917 to enlist in the Signal Corps Reserve as a flying cadet; he received ground training at the School of Military Aeronautics (an Army school) on the campus of the University of California, and flight-trained at Rockwell Field, California. Doolittle received his Reserve Military Aviator rating and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Signal Officers Reserve Corps of the U.S. Army on March 11, 1918.

During World War I, Doolittle stayed in the United States as a flight instructor and performed his war service at Camp John Dick Aviation Concentration Center (&quot;Camp Dick&quot;), Texas; Wright Field, Ohio; Gerstner Field, Louisiana; Rockwell Field, California; Kelly Field, Texas, and Eagle Pass, Texas.

Doolittle served at Rockwell as a flight leader and gunnery instructor. At Kelly Field, he served with the 104th Aero Squadron and with the 90th Aero Squadron of the 1st Surveillance Group. His detachment of the 90th Aero Squadron was based at Eagle Pass, patrolling the Mexican border. Recommended by three officers for retention in the Air Service during demobilization at the end of the war, Doolittle qualified by examination and received a Regular Army commission as a 1st Lieutenant, Air Service, on July 1, 1920.

On May 10, 1921, he was engineering officer and pilot for an expedition recovering a plane that had force-landed in a Mexican canyon on February 10 during a transcontinental flight attempt by Alexander Pearson Jr. Doolittle reached the plane on May 3 and found it serviceable, then returned May 8 with a replacement motor and four mechanics. The oil pressure of the new motor was inadequate, and Doolittle requested two pressure gauges, using carrier pigeons to communicate. The additional parts were dropped by air and installed, and Doolittle flew the plane to Del Rio, Texas, himself, taking off from a airstrip hacked out of the canyon floor.

Subsequently, he attended the Air Service Mechanical School at Kelly Field and the Aeronautical Engineering Course at McCook Field, Ohio. Having at last returned to complete his college degree, he earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of California, Berkeley in 1922, and joined the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.

Doolittle was one of the most famous pilots during the inter-war period. On September 4, 1922, he made the first of many pioneering flights, flying a de Havilland DH-4—which was equipped with early navigational instruments—in the first cross-country flight, from Pablo Beach (now Jacksonville Beach), Florida, to Rockwell Field, San Diego, California, in 21 hours and 19 minutes, making only one refueling stop at Kelly Field. The U.S. Army awarded him the Distinguished Flying Cross.
Within days after the transcontinental flight, he was at the Air Service Engineering School (a precursor to the Air Force Institute of Technology) at McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio. For Doolittle, the school assignment had special significance: &quot;I had applied for the Engineering School because I thought there should be a better rapport between the aeronautical engineer and the pilot. It seemed to me that the engineers felt pilots were all a little crazy or else they wouldn&#x27;t be pilots. The pilots felt the engineers as a group were, if not incompetent, at least not thoroughly acquainted with the pilot&#x27;s viewpoint—that all the engineers did was zip slide rules back and forth and come out with erroneous results and bad aircraft. I thought from a philosophical point of view that it would be good to have engineers and pilots understand one another better. It seemed desirable to marry these two capabilities in one person—and I wanted to be that person.&quot;

In July 1923, after serving as a test pilot and aeronautical engineer at McCook Field, Doolittle entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In March 1924, he conducted aircraft acceleration tests at McCook Field, which became the basis of his master&#x27;s thesis and led to his second Distinguished Flying Cross. He received his SM degree in Aeronautics from MIT in June 1924. Because the Army had given him two years to get his degree and he had done it in just one, he immediately started working on his Sc.D. in Aeronautics, which he received in June 1925. His doctorate in aeronautical engineering was the first issued in the United States. He said that he considered his master&#x27;s work more significant than his doctorate.

Following graduation, Doolittle attended special training in high-speed seaplanes at Naval Air Station Anacostia in Washington, D.C. He also served with the Naval Test Board at Mitchel Field, Long Island, New York, and was a familiar figure in air speed record attempts in the New York area. He won the Schneider Cup race in a Curtiss R3C in 1925 with an average speed of . For that feat, Doolittle was awarded the Mackay Trophy in 1926.

In April 1926, Doolittle was given a leave of absence to go to South America to perform demonstration flights for Curtiss Aircraft. In Chile, he broke both ankles while demonstrating his acrobatic abilities in an incident that was known as Night of the Pisco Sours. Despite having both ankles in casts, Doolittle put his Curtiss P-1 Hawk through aerial maneuvers that outdid the competition. He returned to the United States and was confined to Walter Reed Army Hospital for his injuries until April 1927. He was then assigned to McCook Field for experimental work, with additional duty as an instructor pilot to the 385th Bomb Squadron of the Air Corps Reserve. During this time, in 1927 he was the first to perform an outside loop, previously thought to be a fatal maneuver. Carried out in a Curtiss fighter at Wright Field in Ohio, Doolittle executed the dive from , reached , bottomed out upside down, then climbed and completed the loop.

===Instrument flight===

Doolittle&#x27;s most important contribution to aeronautical technology was his early advancement of instrument flying. He was the first to recognize that true operational freedom in the air could not be achieved until pilots developed the ability to control and navigate aircraft in flight from takeoff run to landing rollout, regardless of the range of vision from the cockpit. Doolittle was the first to envision that a pilot could be trained to use instruments to fly through fog, clouds, precipitation of all forms, darkness, or any other impediment to visibility, and in spite of the pilot&#x27;s own possibly convoluted motion sense inputs. Even at this early stage, the ability to control aircraft was getting beyond the motion sense capability of the pilot. That is, as aircraft became faster and more maneuverable, pilots could become seriously disoriented without visual cues from outside the cockpit, because aircraft could move in ways that pilots&#x27; senses could not accurately decipher.

Doolittle was also the first to recognize these psycho-physiological limitations of the human senses (particularly the motion sense inputs, i.e., up, down, left, right). He initiated the study of the relationships between the psychological effects of visual cues and motion senses. His research resulted in programs that trained pilots to read and understand navigational instruments. A pilot learned to &quot;trust his instruments,&quot; not his senses, as visual cues and his motion sense inputs (what he sensed and &quot;felt&quot;) could be incorrect or unreliable.

In 1929, he became the first pilot to take off, fly and land an airplane using instruments alone, without a view outside the cockpit. Having returned to Mitchell Field that September, he helped develop blind-flying equipment. He helped develop, and was then the first to test, the now universally used artificial horizon and directional gyroscope. He attracted wide newspaper attention with this feat of &quot;blind&quot; flying and later received the Harmon Trophy for conducting the experiments. These accomplishments made all-weather airline operations practical.

===Reserve status===

In January 1930, Doolittle advised the Army on the construction of Floyd Bennett Field in New York City. Doolittle resigned his regular commission on February 15, 1930, and was commissioned a Major in the Air Reserve Corps a month later, being named manager of the Aviation Department of Shell Oil Company, in which capacity he conducted numerous aviation tests. While in the Reserve, he also returned to temporary active duty with the Army frequently to conduct tests.

Doolittle helped influence Shell Oil Company to produce the first quantities of 100 octane aviation gasoline. High octane fuel was crucial to the high-performance planes that were developed in the late 1930s.

In 1931, Doolittle won the first Bendix Trophy race from Burbank, California, to Cleveland, in a Laird Super Solution biplane.

In 1932, Doolittle set the world&#x27;s high-speed record for land planes at in the Shell Speed Dash. Later, he took the Thompson Trophy race at Cleveland in the notorious Gee Bee R-1 racer with a speed averaging . After having won the three big air racing trophies of the time, the Schneider, Bendix, and Thompson, he officially retired from air racing, stating, &quot;I have yet to hear anyone engaged in this work dying of old age.&quot;

In April 1934, Doolittle was selected to be a member of the Baker Board. Chaired by former Secretary of War Newton D. Baker, the board was convened during the Air Mail scandal to study Air Corps organization. In 1940, he became president of the Institute of Aeronautical Science.

The development of 100-octane aviation gasoline on an economic scale was due in part to Doolittle, who had become aviation manager of Shell Oil Company. Around 1935 he convinced Shell to invest in refining capacity to produce 100-octane fuel on a scale that nobody needed since no aircraft existed that required a fuel that nobody made. Some fellow employees would call his effort &quot;Doolittle&#x27;s million-dollar blunder&quot; but time would prove him correct. Before this the Army had considered 100-octane tests using pure octane but at $25 a gallon it did not happen. By 1936 tests at Wright Field using a cheaper alternative to pure octane proved the value of the fuel and both Shell and Standard Oil of New Jersey would win the contract to supply test quantities for the Army. By 1938 the price was down to 17.5 cents a gallon, only 2.5 cents more than 87 octane fuel. By the end of WW II, the price would be down to 16 cents a gallon and the U.S. armed forces would be consuming 20 million gallons a day.

Doolittle returned to active duty in the U.S. Army Air Corps on July 1, 1940, with the rank of Major. He was assigned as the assistant district supervisor of the Central Air Corps Procurement District at Indianapolis and Detroit, where he worked with large auto manufacturers on the conversion of their plants to aircraft production. The following August, he went to England as a member of a special mission and brought back information about other countries&#x27; air forces and military build-ups.

==Doolittle Raid==

Following the reorganization of the Army Air Corps into the USAAF in June 1941, Doolittle was promoted to lieutenant colonel on January 2, 1942, and assigned to Army Air Forces Headquarters to plan the first retaliatory air raid on the Japanese homeland following the attack on Pearl Harbor. He volunteered for and received General H.H. Arnold&#x27;s approval to lead the top-secret attack of 16 B-25 medium bombers from the aircraft carrier , with targets in Tokyo, Kobe, Yokohama, Osaka and Nagoya.

After training at Eglin Field and Wagner Field in northwest Florida, Doolittle, his aircraft, and volunteer flight crews proceeded to McClellan Field, California for aircraft modifications at the Sacramento Air Depot, followed by a short final flight to Naval Air Station Alameda, California for embarkation aboard the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Hornet&quot;. On April 18, Doolittle and his 16 B-25 crews took off from &quot;Hornet&quot;, reached Japan, and bombed their targets. Fifteen of the planes then headed for their recovery airfield in China, while one crew chose to land in Russia due to their bomber&#x27;s unusually high fuel consumption. As did most of the other crewmen who participated in the one-way mission, Doolittle and his crew bailed out safely over China when their B-25 ran out of fuel. By then, they had been flying for about 12 hours, it was nighttime, the weather was stormy, and Doolittle was unable to locate their landing field. Doolittle came down in a rice paddy (saving a previously injured ankle from breaking) near Quzhou. He and his crew linked up after the bailout and were helped through Japanese lines by Chinese guerrillas and American missionary John Birch. Other aircrews were not so fortunate, although most eventually reached safety with the help of friendly Chinese. Seven crew members lost their lives, four as a result of being captured and murdered by the Japanese and three due to an aircraft crash or while parachuting. Doolittle thought he would be court martialed due to having to launch the raid ahead of schedule after being spotted by a Japanese patrol boat and the loss of all the aircraft.

==Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign==
After the raid, the Japanese Imperial Army began the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign (also known as Operation Sei-go) to prevent these eastern coastal provinces of China from being used again for an attack on Japan and to take revenge on the Chinese people. An area of some was laid waste. &quot;Like a swarm of locusts, they left behind nothing but destruction and chaos,&quot; eyewitness Father Wendelin Dunker wrote. The Japanese killed an estimated 10,000 Chinese civilians during their search for Doolittle&#x27;s men. People who aided the airmen were tortured before they were killed. Father Dunker wrote of the destruction of the town of Ihwang: &quot;They shot any man, woman, child, cow, hog, or just about anything that moved, They raped any woman from the ages of 10–65, and before burning the town they thoroughly looted it ... None of the humans shot were buried either ...&quot; The Japanese entered Nancheng (Jiangxi), population 50,000 on June 11, &quot;beginning a reign of terror so horrendous that missionaries would later dub it &#x27;the Rape of Nancheng.&#x27; &quot; evoking memories of the infamous Rape of Nanjing five years before. Less than a month later, the Japanese forces put what remained of the city to the torch. &quot;This planned burning was carried on for three days,&quot; one Chinese newspaper reported, &quot;and the city of Nancheng became charred earth.&quot;

When Japanese troops moved out of the Zhejiang and Jiangxi areas in mid-August, they left behind a trail of devastation. Chinese estimates put the civilian death toll at 250,000. The Imperial Japanese Army had also spread cholera, typhoid, plague infected fleas and dysentery pathogens. The Japanese biological warfare Unit 731 brought almost of paratyphoid and anthrax to be left in contaminated food and contaminated wells with the withdrawal of the army from areas around Yushan, Kinhwa and Futsin. Around 1,700 Japanese troops died out of a total 10,000 Japanese soldiers who fell ill with disease when their biological weapons attack rebounded on their own forces.

Doolittle went on to fly more combat missions as commander of the 12th Air Force in North Africa, for which he was awarded four Air Medals. He later commanded the 12th, 15th and 8th Air Forces in Europe. The other surviving members of the Doolittle raid also went on to new assignments.

Doolittle received the Medal of Honor from President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House for planning and leading his raid on Japan. His citation reads: &quot;For conspicuous leadership above and beyond the call of duty, involving personal valor and intrepidity at an extreme hazard to life. With the apparent certainty of being forced to land in enemy territory or to perish at sea, Lt. Col. Doolittle personally led a squadron of Army bombers, manned by volunteer crews, in a highly destructive raid on the Japanese mainland.&quot; He was also promoted to brigadier general.

The Doolittle Raid is viewed by historians as a major morale-building victory for the United States. Although the damage done to Japanese war industry was minor, the raid showed the Japanese that their homeland was vulnerable to air attack, and forced them to withdraw several front-line fighter units from Pacific war zones for homeland defense. More significantly, Japanese commanders considered the raid deeply embarrassing, and their attempt to close the perceived gap in their Pacific defense perimeter led directly to the decisive American victory at the Battle of Midway in June 1942.

When asked from where the Tokyo raid was launched, President Roosevelt coyly said its base was Shangri-La, a fictional paradise from the popular novel and film &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;. In the same vein, the U.S. Navy named one of its &quot;Essex&quot;-class fleet carriers .

==World War II, post-raid==
In July 1942, as a brigadier general—he had been promoted by two grades on the day after the Tokyo attack, bypassing the rank of full colonel—Doolittle was assigned to the nascent Eighth Air Force. This followed his rejection by General Douglas MacArthur as commander of the South West Pacific Area to replace Major General George Brett. Major General Frank Andrews first turned down the position and offered a choice between George Kenney and Doolittle, MacArthur chose Kenney. In September, Doolittle became commanding general of the Twelfth Air Force, soon to be operating in North Africa. He was promoted to major general in November 1942, and in March 1943 became commanding general of the Northwest African Strategic Air Force, a unified command of U.S. Army Air Force and Royal Air Force units. In September, he commanded a raid against the Italian town of Battipaglia that was so thorough in its destruction that General Carl Andrew Spaatz sent him a joking message: &quot;You&#x27;re slipping Jimmy. There&#x27;s one crabapple tree and one stable still standing.&quot;

Maj. Gen. Doolittle took command of the Fifteenth Air Force in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations in November 1943. On June 10, he flew as co-pilot with Jack Sims, fellow Tokyo Raider, in a B-26 Marauder of the 320th Bombardment Group, 442nd Bombardment Squadron on a mission to attack gun emplacements at Pantelleria. Doolittle continued to fly, despite the risk of capture, while being privy to the Ultra secret, which was that the German encryption systems had been broken by the British. From January 1944 to September 1945, he held his largest command, the Eighth Air Force (8 AF) in England as a lieutenant general, his promotion date being March 13, 1944, and the highest rank ever held by an active reserve officer in modern times.

===Escort fighter tactics===
Doolittle&#x27;s major influence on the European air war occurred late in 1943—and primarily after he took command of the Eighth Air Force on January 6, 1944—when he changed the policy of requiring escorting fighters to remain with their bombers at all times. Instead, he permitted escort fighters to fly far ahead of the bombers&#x27; combat box formations, allowing them to freely engage the German fighters lying in wait for the bombers. Throughout most of 1944, this tactic negated the effectiveness of the twin-engined &quot;Zerstörergeschwader&quot; heavy fighter wings and single-engined &quot;Sturmgruppen&quot; of heavily armed Fw 190As by clearing the Luftwaffe&#x27;s bomber destroyers from ahead of the bomber formations. After the bombers had hit their targets, the American fighters were free to strafe German airfields, transportation, and other &quot;targets of opportunity&quot; on their return flight to base. These tasks were initially performed with Lockheed P-38 Lightnings and Republic P-47 Thunderbolts through the end of 1943. They were progressively replaced with the long-ranged North American P-51 Mustangs as the spring of 1944 wore on.

==Postwar==
===Doolittle Board===

Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson asked Doolittle on March 27, 1946, to head a commission on the relationships between officers and enlisted men in the Army called the &quot;Doolittle Board&quot; or the &quot;GI Gripes Board&quot;. The Army implemented many of the board&#x27;s recommendations in the postwar volunteer Army, though many professional officers and noncommissioned officers thought that the Board &quot;destroyed the discipline of the Army&quot;. Columnist Hanson Baldwin said that the Doolittle Board &quot;caused severe damage to service effectiveness by recommendations intended to &#x27;democratize&#x27; the Army—a concept that is self-contradictory&quot;.

===U.S. space program===
Doolittle became acquainted with the field of space science in its infancy. He wrote in his autobiography, &quot;I became interested in rocket development in the 1930s when I met Robert H. Goddard, who laid the foundation [in the US]. ... While with Shell [Oil] I worked with him on the development of a type of [rocket] fuel. ... &quot; Harry Guggenheim, whose foundation sponsored Goddard&#x27;s work, and Charles Lindbergh, who encouraged Goddard&#x27;s efforts, arranged for (then Major) Doolittle to discuss with Goddard a special blend of gasoline. Doolittle piloted himself to Roswell, New Mexico in October 1938 and was given a tour of Goddard&#x27;s workshop and a &quot;short course&quot; in rocketry and space travel. He then wrote a memo, including a rather detailed description of Goddard&#x27;s rocket. In closing he said, &quot;interplanetary transportation is probably a dream of the very distant future, but with the moon only a quarter of a million miles away—who knows!&quot; In July 1941 he wrote Goddard that he was still interested in rocket propulsion research. The Army, however, was interested only in JATO at this point. Doolittle was concerned about the state of rocketry in the US and remained in touch with Goddard.

Shortly after World War II, Doolittle spoke to an American Rocket Society conference at which a large number interested in rocketry attended. The topic was Robert Goddard&#x27;s work. He later stated that at that time &quot;... we [the aeronautics field in the US] had not given much credence to the tremendous potential of rocketry.

In 1956, Doolittle was appointed chairman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) because the previous chairman, Jerome C. Hunsaker, thought Doolittle to be more sympathetic to the rocket, which was increasing in importance as a scientific tool as well as a weapon. The NACA Special Committee on Space Technology was organized in January 1958 and chaired by Guy Stever to determine the requirements of a national space program and what additions were needed to NACA technology. Doolittle, Dr. Hugh Dryden and Stever selected committee members including Dr. Wernher von Braun from the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, Sam Hoffman of Rocketdyne, Abe Hyatt of the Office of Naval Research and Colonel Norman Appold from the USAF missile program, considering their potential contributions to US space programs and ability to educate NACA people in space science.

===Reserve status===
On 5 January 1946, Doolittle reverted to inactive reserve status in the Army Air Forces in the grade of lieutenant general, a rarity in those days when reserve officers were usually limited to the rank of major general or rear admiral, a restriction that would not end in the US armed forces until the 21st century. He retired from the United States Army on 10 May 1946. On 18 September 1947, his reserve commission as a general officer was transferred to the newly established United States Air Force. Doolittle returned to Shell Oil as a vice president, and later as a director.

In the summer of 1946, Doolittle went to Stockholm where he consulted about the &quot;ghost rockets&quot; that had been observed over Scandinavia.

In 1947, Doolittle became the first president of the Air Force Association, an organization which he helped create.

In 1948, Doolittle advocated the desegregation of the US military. He wrote, &quot;I am convinced that the solution to the situation is to forget that they are colored.&quot; Industry was in the process of integrating, Doolittle said, &quot;and it is going to be forced on the military. You are merely postponing the inevitable and you might as well take it gracefully.&quot;

In March 1951, Doolittle was appointed a special assistant to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, serving as a civilian in scientific matters which led to Air Force ballistic missile and space programs. In 1952, following a string of three air crashes in two months at Elizabeth, New Jersey, the President of the United States, Harry S. Truman, appointed him to lead a presidential commission examining the safety of urban airports. The report &quot;Airports and Their Neighbors&quot; led to zoning requirements for buildings near approaches, early noise control requirements, and initial work on &quot;super airports&quot; with runways, suited to 150 ton aircraft.

Doolittle was appointed a life member of the MIT Corporation, the university&#x27;s board of trustees, an uncommon permanent appointment, and served as an MIT Corporation Member for 40 years.

In 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower asked Doolittle to perform a study of the Central Intelligence Agency; the resulting work was known as the Doolittle Report, 1954, and was classified for a number of years.

From 1957 to 1958, he was chairman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). This period was during the events of Sputnik, Vanguard and Explorer. He was the last person to hold this position, as the NACA was superseded by NASA. Doolittle was asked to serve as the first NASA administrator, but he turned it down.

Doolittle retired from Air Force Reserve duty on February 28, 1959. He remained active in other capacities, including chairman of the board of TRW Space Technology Laboratories. &quot;Doolittle Drive&quot; at TRW&#x27;s Space Park was named in his honor.

==Personal life==
Doolittle married Josephine &quot;Joe&quot; E. Daniels on December 24, 1917. At a dinner celebration after Jimmy Doolittle&#x27;s first all-instrument flight in 1929, Josephine Doolittle asked her guests to sign her white damask tablecloth. Later, she embroidered the names in black. She continued this tradition, collecting hundreds of signatures from the aviation world. The tablecloth was donated to the Smithsonian Institution. Married for exactly 71 years, Josephine Doolittle died on December 24, 1988, five years before her husband.

The Doolittles had two sons, James Jr., and John. Both became military officers and pilots. James Jr. was an A-26 Invader pilot in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II and later a fighter pilot in the U.S. Air Force in the late 1940s through the late 1950s. He died by suicide in 1958, aged 38. At the time of his death, James Jr. was a Major and commander of the 524th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, piloting the F-101 Voodoo.

The other son, John P. Doolittle, retired from the Air Force as a colonel, and his grandson, Colonel James H. Doolittle III, was the vice commander of the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base, California.

James H. &quot;Jimmy&quot; Doolittle died from a stroke at the age of 96 in Pebble Beach, California, on September 27, 1993, and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, near Washington, D.C., next to his wife. In his honor at the funeral, there was also a flyover of Miss Mitchell, a lone B-25 Mitchell, and USAF Eighth Air Force bombers from Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana. After a brief graveside service, fellow Doolittle Raider Bill Bower began the final tribute on the bugle. When emotion took over, Doolittle&#x27;s great-grandson, Paul Dean Crane, Jr., played Taps.

Doolittle was initiated to the Scottish Rite Freemasonry, where he took the 33rd degree, becoming also a Shriner.

==Dates of military rank==
==Honors and awards==

On April 4, 1985, President Ronald Reagan promoted Doolittle to the rank of full four-star general (O-10) on the U.S. Air Force retired list. Initially, Senator Barry Goldwater had sponsored legislation to waive Doolittle&#x27;s ineligibility by statute, since he was ineligible for the rank as a reservist as well as for lack of being on active duty. However, the legislation stalled in the House, causing Goldwater to request that Reagan promote him with only Senate consent. This was arguably unlawful because of the Senate&#x27;s inability to waive statutory restrictions. In a later ceremony, President Ronald Reagan and U.S. Senator and retired Air Force Reserve Major General Barry Goldwater pinned on Doolittle&#x27;s four-star insignia. Later, in 1986, the Comptroller General ruled that the promotion was unlawful for pay or benefit purposes due to the lack of implementing legislation. This effectively made it entirely honorary.

In addition to his Medal of Honor for the Tokyo raid, Doolittle received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, two Distinguished Service Medals, the Silver Star, three Distinguished Flying Crosses, the Bronze Star Medal, four Air Medals, and decorations from Belgium, China, Ecuador, France, Great Britain, and Poland. He was the first American to be awarded both the Medal of Honor and the Medal of Freedom. He is also one of only two persons (the other being Douglas MacArthur) to receive both the Medal of Honor and a British knighthood, when he was appointed an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.

In 1972, Doolittle received the Tony Jannus Award for his distinguished contributions to commercial aviation, in recognition of the development of instrument flight.

Doolittle was awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1959. In 1983, he was awarded the United States Military Academy&#x27;s Sylvanus Thayer Award. He was inducted in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America as the only member of the air racing category in the inaugural class of 1989, and into the Aerospace Walk of Honor in the inaugural class of 1990.

<text>Quintus Herennius Etruscus Messius Decius (died c. June 251), known simply as Herennius Etruscus, was briefly Roman emperor in 251, ruling jointly under his father Decius. His father was proclaimed emperor by his troops in September 249 while in Pannonia and Moesia, in opposition to Philip. Decius defeated Philip in battle, and was then proclaimed emperor by the Senate. Etruscus, still a child, was elevated to (heir) in 250, then further raised to (emperor) in May 251. When the Goths, under Cniva, invaded the Danubian provinces, he was sent with a vanguard, followed by the main body of Roman troops, led by Decius. They ambushed Cniva at the Battle of Nicopolis ad Istrum in 250, routing him, before being ambushed and routed themselves at the Battle of Beroe. Etruscus was killed in the Battle of Abritus the following year, alongside his father. After the deaths of both emperors, Trebonianus Gallus, who had been governor of Moesia, was elected emperor by the remaining Roman forces.

==Life==
Quintus Herennius Etruscus Messius Decius was the son of Decius, a Roman general who later became emperor, and Herennia Etruscilla, his wife. His birth date is sometimes given between 220 and 230, but there is no way to confirm this. Etruscus was probably a young boy when he was proclaimed emperor in 251, as depicted in his coins.

Decius became emperor after being sent to lead troops in the provinces of Pannonia and Moesia, where he was declared emperor by his troops in September 249, in opposition to Philip the Arab. He led his troops against Philip, their forces meeting in September 249, near Verona, Italy. In this battle, Philip was slain, after which the Roman Senate declared Decius emperor, and honored him with the name Traianus, a reference to Emperor Trajan.

Both Herennius Etruscus and his younger brother Hostilian were elevated to in 250, and in May 251 Herennius Etruscus was elevated to , making him co-emperor under Decius. He was also made consul for 251.

In 249, the Goths, led by King Cniva, invaded the Danubian provinces of the Roman Empire with a huge force. They split into two columns; one column launched an assault on Dacia, and the other force, made up of 70,000 men, and personally led by Cniva, invaded Moesia. Cniva&#x27;s forces further split into two groups; one marched to assault Philippopolis, and the other marched to Novae. Cniva was prevented from laying siege to Novae by Trebonianus Gallus, the governor of Moesia and future emperor, and thus moved south, on to Nicopolis. By this time news of the invasion reached Rome, and both Decius and Herennius Etruscus traveled to repulse the Gothic invasion, although Hostilian remained in Rome. Herennius Etruscus was sent forward with a vanguard, followed by the main body of Roman forces, led by Decius. Decius and Herennius Etruscus took the Gothic forces by surprise in the Battle of Nicopolis, and beat them decisively. Following the crushing defeat, Cniva retreated over the Haemus Mons (Balkan Mountains), and met up with his other forces at Philippopolis. Cniva then ambushed the forces of Decius and Herennius Etruscus at the Battle of Beroe, near the small town of Beroca at the base of the Haemus Mons. The Roman forces were beaten decisively in this engagement and fled in disarray to Moesia where Decius and Herennius Etruscus worked to reorganize them. Cniva then returned to Philippopolis, and with the help of Titus Julius Priscus, the Roman governor of Thrace, managed to capture the city.

Decius and Herennius Etruscus launched a counterattack in spring 251 and were initially successful in pushing back the Goths. However, Cniva set an ambush for them, in June 251, near Abritus (modern-day Razgrad, Bulgaria). In this battle, both Decius and Herennius Etruscus were killed. The exact circumstances of the death of Herennius Etruscus are vague. The main source for the event, Aurelius Victor, says only that Herennius Etruscus was killed when he &quot;pressed the attack too boldly&quot;. Aurelius Victor specifies that he was acting as an , commanding troops from a distance but not physically engaging in the combat, rather than a commilito, who physically fought in the battle. After the news of his death reached Decius, he refused to be consoled, stating that the loss of one life was minor to a battle, and thus continued the combat, in which he was also slain. The death of Decius is similarly obscure, although it is agreed upon that he must have died either during the battle, as a , during the retreat from the battle, or else was slain while serving as . The reserve forces of Trebonianus Gallus failed to reinforce the main army in time to save Decius and Herennius Etruscus, although whether this was due to treachery or misfortune is unknown.

After the death of both Decius and Herennius Etruscus, and much of the Roman army with them, the remaining forces immediately elected Trebonianus Gallus, the governor of Moesia, as emperor. Trebonianus Gallus made peace with Cniva on humiliating terms, allowing them to keep their prisoners and spoils in order to secure peace. In order to gain popular support, Trebonianus Gallus retained Herennia Etruscilla as &quot;Augusta&quot; (empress), and elevated Hostilian to , making him co-emperor alongside Trebonianus Gallus himself. Hostilian died in November 251, either from a plague or murder, after which Volusianus, Trebonianus Gallus&#x27; son, was raised to . After Trebonianus Gallus was overthrown by Aemilianus in 253, Herennia Etruscilla faded into obscurity.

<text>Hostilian (; died July 251) was briefly Roman emperor in 251. Hostilian was born to Decius and Herennia Etruscilla at an unknown date and elevated to &quot;caesar&quot; in 250 by Decius. After Decius and Herennius Etruscus, Hostilian&#x27;s brother, were killed at the Battle of Abritus, an ambush by the Goths, Trebonianus Gallus was proclaimed emperor by the legions. Almost immediately, he elevated Hostilian to co-emperor and his own son, Volusianus, to &quot;caesar&quot;. Hostilian died soon after, either due to plague or being murdered by Trebonianus Gallus.

==History==

Hostilian was born at an unknown date, to Decius, a Roman general who later became Emperor, and his wife Herennia Etruscilla. He had a brother, Herennius Etruscus, and one sister. His full name based on coinage and inscriptions was Gaius Valens Hostilianus Messius Quintus, but to this the historian Aurelius Victor adds Perpenna or Perperna, a name of Etruscan origin.

In September 249 the army of Decius declared him emperor, in opposition to Philip the Arab. He defeated and killed Philip in a battle near Verona, after which the Roman Senate confirmed Decius&#x27;s appointment and honoured him with the name &quot;Traianus&quot;, a reference to Emperor Trajan.

In or around September 250, Decius appointed both his sons &quot;caesars&quot; and in May 251 Herennius Etruscus was elevated to the rank of &quot;augustus&quot;, which made Decius and Etruscus co-emperors, with Hostilian as the heir of either or both of them. In June 251, Decius and Herennius Etruscus were killed by the Goths at the Battle of Abritus, and Trebonianus Gallus was declared emperor. To placate the public after this abrupt change of rulers, Gallus elevated Hostilian to &quot;augustus&quot;. After a short period as co-emperor, Hostilian died in circumstances which are still disputed. His death is sometimes dated to November, but contemporary sources indicate that he died in or before August, probably in July. Aurelius Victor and the author of the &quot;Epitome de Caesaribus&quot; say that Hostilian died of a plague. Zosimus claims that he was killed by Trebonianus Gallus. Gallus&#x27;s son Volusianus became the new co-emperor.

Some historians identify Hostilian as the Roman general depicted in the &quot;Ludovisi Battle sarcophagus&quot;, but this is unlikely given that all of his coins depict him as a beardless young boy. It&#x27;s possible that both Hostilian and Herennius Etruscus were still children or teenagers at the time of their death.

== Numismatics ==
The &quot;aurei&quot; of Hostilian fall into four types bearing the bust of Hostilian on the obverse, with the reverse showing: Mars walking to the right; priestly implements; Mercury standing; and Roma seated, holding Victoria.

<text>Project Vanguard was a program managed by the United States Navy Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), which intended to launch the first artificial satellite into low Earth orbit using a Vanguard rocket as the launch vehicle from Cape Canaveral Missile Annex, Florida.

In response to the launch of Sputnik 1 on 4 October 1957, the U.S. restarted the Explorer program, which had been proposed earlier by the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA). Privately, however, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and President Dwight D. Eisenhower were aware of progress being made by the Soviets on Sputnik from secret spy plane imagery. Together with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), ABMA built Explorer 1 and launched it on 1 February 1958 (UTC). Before work was completed, however, the Soviet Union launched a second satellite, Sputnik 2, on 3 November 1957. Meanwhile, the spectacular failure of Vanguard TV3 on 6 December 1957, deepened American dismay over the country&#x27;s position in the Space Race.

On 17 March 1958, Vanguard 1 became the second artificial satellite successfully placed in a low Earth orbit by the United States. It was the first solar-powered satellite. Just in diameter and weighing , Vanguard 1 was described by then-Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev as, &quot;The grapefruit satellite&quot;. Vanguard 1, and the upper stage of its launch vehicle, are the oldest artificial satellites still in space, as Vanguard&#x27;s predecessors, Sputnik 1, Sputnik 2, and Explorer 1, have decayed from orbit.

== Project history ==
In the early 1950s, the American Rocket Society set up an ad hoc Committee on Space Flight, of which Milton W. Rosen, NRL project manager for the Viking rocket, became chair. Encouraged by conversations between Richard W. Porter of General Electric and Alan T. Waterman, Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF), Rosen on 27 November 1954, completed a report describing the potential value of launching an Earth satellite. The report was submitted to the NSF early in 1955. As part of planning for the International Geophysical Year (1957–1958), the U.S. publicly undertook to place an artificial satellite with a scientific experiment into orbit around the Earth.

=== The three services&#x27; proposals ===
Proposals to do this were presented by the United States Air Force (USAF), the United States Army (USA), and the United States Navy (USN). The Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) under Dr. Wernher von Braun had suggested using a modified Redstone rocket (see: Juno I) while the Air Force had proposed using the Atlas launch vehicle, which did not yet exist. The Navy proposed designing a rocket system based on the Viking and Aerobee rocket systems.

The Air Force proposal was not seriously considered, as Atlas development was years behind the other vehicles. Among other limitations, the Army submission focused on the launch vehicle, while a payload was assumed to become available from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and the network of ground tracking stations was assumed to be a Navy project. The Navy proposal detailed all three aspects of the mission.

== The Navy&#x27;s project ==
In August 1955, the US DOD Committee on Special Capabilities chose the Navy&#x27;s proposal as it appeared most likely, by spring 1958, to fulfill the following:

# Place a satellite in orbit during the International Geophysical Year.
# Accomplish a scientific experiment in orbit.
# Track the satellite and ensure its attainment of orbit.

Another consideration was that the Navy proposal used civilian sounding rockets rather than military missiles, which were considered inappropriate for peaceful scientific exploration. What went unstated at the time was that the U.S. already had a covert satellite program underway, WS-117, which was developing the ability to launch spy satellites using USAF Thor IRBMs. The US government was concerned that the Soviets would object to military satellites overflying the Soviet Union as they had to various aircraft incursions and the balloons of the Genetrix project. The idea was that if a clearly &quot;civilian&quot; and &quot;scientific&quot; satellite went up first, the Soviets might not object, and thus the precedent would be established that space was above national boundaries.

Designated Project Vanguard, the program was placed under Navy management and DoD monitorship. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in Washington was given overall responsibility, while initial funding came from the National Science Foundation. The director was John P. Hagen (1908–1990), an astronomer who in 1958 would become the assistant director of space flight development with the formation of NASA. After a delay due to the NRL changing the shape of the satellite from a conical shape, the initial spherical Vanguard satellites were built at the NRL, and contained as their payload seven mercury cell batteries in a hermetically sealed container, two tracking radio transmitters, a temperature sensitive crystal, and six clusters of solar cells on the surface of the sphere. The first satellite was called Vanguard TV3.

NRL was also responsible for developing the Vanguard rocket launch vehicles through a contract to the Martin Company (which had built the Viking rockets), developing and installing the satellite tracking system, and designing, constructing, and testing the satellites. The tracking system was called Minitrack. The Minitrack stations, designed by NRL but subcontracted to the Army Corps of Engineers, were 14 stations along a north–south line running along the east coast of North America and the west coast of South America. Minitrack was the forerunner of another NRL-developed system called NAVSPASUR, which remains operational today under the control of the Air Force and is a major producer of spacecraft tracking data.

=== Sputnik and Explorer 1 ===
The original schedule called for the TV3 to be launched during the month of September 1957, but because of delays this did not happen. On October 4, 1957, the Vanguard team learned of the launch of Sputnik 1 by the USSR while still working on a test vehicle (TV-2) designed to test the first stage of their launcher rocket. While demoralizing to the Vanguard team, Minitrack was successful in tracking Sputnik, a major success for NRL. At 11:44:35 a.m. on December 6, an attempt was made to launch TV-3. The Vanguard rocket rose about into the air when the engine lost thrust, and the rocket immediately sank back down to the launch pad and exploded. The payload nosecone detached and landed free of the exploding rocket, the small satellite&#x27;s radio beacon still beeping. The satellite was too damaged for further use; it now resides in the National Air and Space Museum.

After the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 2, on November 3, 1957, then Secretary of Defense Neil H. McElroy directed the U.S. Army to use the Juno I and launch a satellite. On January 31, 1958, the U.S. Army launched the Explorer 1 satellite. With the launch of Sputnik 1 and 2 the previous concern, the right of satellite overflight, had become moot: those satellites were launched by an early version of the Soviet R-7 rocket, the basis of the USSR&#x27;s early ICBMs, and definitely military, as well as roughly 40 times larger than the Vanguard launcher.

On March 17, 1958, the program successfully launched the Vanguard satellite TV-4. TV-4 achieved a stable orbit with an apogee of and a perigee of . It was estimated that it would remain in orbit for at least 240 years, and it was renamed Vanguard I, which in addition to its upper launch stage remains the oldest human-made satellite still in orbit.

In late 1958, with responsibility for Project Vanguard having been transferred to NASA, the nucleus of the Goddard Space Flight Center was formed. After four failed launches, the program once again succeeded with SLV-4, renamed Vanguard II. After two more failures, the program ended with the launch of Vanguard III in 1959.

== Accomplishments ==
Despite being overshadowed by Sputnik 1, and having to overcome the widespread humiliation of its unsuccessful early attempts, the Vanguard Project eventually met its scientific objectives, providing a wealth of information on the size and shape of the Earth, density of air, temperature ranges, and micrometeorite impact. The Vanguard 1 radio continued to transmit until 1964, and tracking data obtained with this satellite revealed that Earth is not quite a perfect sphere: it is slightly pear-shaped, elevated at the North Pole and flattened at the South Pole. It corrected ideas about the atmosphere&#x27;s density at high altitudes and improved the accuracy of world maps. The Vanguard program was transferred to NASA when that agency was created in mid-1958.

The Vanguard &quot;Satellite Launch Vehicle&quot;, a term invented for the operational SLV rockets as opposed to the Test Vehicle TV versions, was a much smaller and lighter launcher than the Redstone-based Jupiter-C/Juno 1 rocket which launched the Explorer satellites, or the immense R-7 that the Soviets used to launch the early Sputniks.

The Vanguard 1 program introduced much of the technology that has since been applied in later U.S. satellite programs, from rocket launching to satellite tracking. For example, it validated in flight that solar cells could be used for several years to power radio transmitters. Vanguard&#x27;s solar cells operated for about seven years, while conventional batteries used to power another on-board transmitter lasted only 20 days.

Although Vanguard&#x27;s solar-powered &quot;voice&quot; became silent in 1964, it continues to serve the scientific community. Ground-based optical tracking of the now-inert Vanguards continues to provide information about the effects of the Sun, Moon, and Atmosphere of Earth on satellite orbits. Vanguard 1 marked its 50th year in space on 17 March 2008. In the years following its launch, the small satellite has made more than 196,990 revolutions of the Earth and traveled , the distance from Earth to beyond the dwarf planet Pluto and halfway back. Original estimates had the orbit lasting for 2,000 years, but it was discovered that solar radiation pressure and atmospheric drag during high levels of solar activity produced significant perturbations in the perigee height of the satellite, which caused a significant decrease in its expected lifetime to about 240 years.

== Launch history ==
Test vehicle launches
The first Vanguard flight, a successful suborbital test of the Vanguard TV0 single-stage vehicle, was launched on 8 December 1956. On 1 May 1957, the two-stage test vehicle TV1 was successfully launched. Vanguard TV2, another successful suborbital test, was launched 23 October 1957.

The Vanguard rocket launched three satellites out of eleven launch attempts:
# Vanguard TV3 – 6 December 1957 – Failed to orbit satellite – low tank pressure caused engine cutoff T+2 seconds
# Vanguard TV3 Backup – 5 February 1958 – Failed to orbit satellite – control failure caused vehicle breakup T+55 seconds
# &quot;Vanguard 1 – 17 March 1958 – Orbited satellite&quot;
# Vanguard TV5 – 28 April 1958 – Failed to orbit satellite – 3rd stage separation failure
# Vanguard SLV-1 – 27 May 1958 – Failed to orbit 9.98 kg satellite – 2nd stage attitude control failure prevented the 3rd stage from entering the correct angle for orbital insertion
# Vanguard SLV 2 – 26 June 1958 – Failed to orbit 9.98 kg satellite – 2nd stage lost thrust after only 8 seconds of burning due to fuel line obstruction
# Vanguard SLV 3 – 28 September 1958 – Failed to orbit 9.98 kg satellite – 2nd stage insufficient thrust for orbital insertion due to fuel line obstruction
# &quot;Vanguard 2 – 17 February 1959 – Orbited satellite&quot;
# Vanguard SLV 5 – 13 April 1959 – Failed to orbit satellite – 2nd stage hydraulics failure led to loss of control
# Vanguard SLV 6 – 22 June 1959 – Failed to orbit 10.3 kg satellite – 2nd stage exploded due to stuck helium vent valve
# &quot;Vanguard 3 –18 September 1959 – Orbited satellite&quot;

<doc id="147759" wikidata="Q1207295" url="?curid=147759" title="Dez Cadena">
<text>Dez Cadena (born June 2, 1961) is an American punk rock singer and guitarist. He was the third vocalist and later rhythm guitarist for hardcore punk band Black Flag from 1980 to 1983. Cadena played guitar with Misfits from 2001 to 2015, initially joining the band alongside Doyle, Jerry Only, and Robo for their 25th Anniversary Tour.

==Early life==
Born in Newark, New Jersey, his father, Ozzie Cadena, was a well-known A&amp;R man in the music industry, and the co-founder of iconic jazz label Savoy Records.

At age thirteen, Cadena moved to Hermosa Beach, California. While tending a yard sale at his father&#x27;s house, Cadena met Ron Reyes and the two became friends. Reyes introduced Cadena to the local punk scene and they both started watching the early incarnation of Black Flag when they were still going by the name Panic. Soon Reyes replaced Keith Morris as vocalist of the band.

== Career ==

===Early career===
Cadena joined Black Flag in 1980, replacing singer Ron Reyes. During the first year of touring with the band, his hoarse voice became a recognizable and often imitated style of singing in hardcore punk. Eventually, and due in part to straining his voice, Cadena decided he wanted to play guitar. Henry Rollins joined as vocalist, and for a period, Cadena played rhythm guitar alongside founder Greg Ginn, including on the seminal 1981 album &quot;Damaged&quot;.

Eventually, Cadena wanted to explore other forms of music so he left Black Flag and started DC3.

Before, during and after his stint in Black Flag, Cadena was a member of Redd Kross, Twisted Roots, and Ella and the Blacks, a band which he co-founded. He also made a guest appearance on Hüsker Dü&#x27;s 1984 double album, &quot;Zen Arcade&quot;.

===1990s===
During the mid-1990s, Cadena teamed up with George Hurley and Tom Troccoli to form Vida. Originally VIDA was formed w/ former Saccharine Trust drummer, Tony Cicero. 
The original line-up recording of the Minutemen tune Reserved for 99&#x27; can be found on the cover compilation &quot;Our Band Could Be Your Life&quot;. Their self-titled album was released by Blue Man from Uranus Records. The band has since dissolved. He also played with raucous Hermosa Beach bar band The Jim Mellon Quartet, as well as Steve Reed and Dave Markey in Carnage Asada. Cadena played guitar and sang lead vocals for the super-group Chop on their only single, which consisted of Blue Öyster Cult covers. The group also included Mike Watt, Dave Markey, Dave Peterson, and Dave Travis.

In around 1999, Cadena toured as part of ex-Guns N&#x27; Roses bassist Duff McKagan&#x27;s solo band to promote McKagan&#x27;s latest album &quot;Beautiful Disease&quot; which was never actually released because of the merger between Universal and PolyGram, but promoted on tour.

===Misfits===

Cadena first played with Misfits on the band&#x27;s 25th anniversary tour in 2001, initially joining the band alongside Doyle, Jerry Only and ROBO, following the departure of Michale Graves and Dr. Chud who had left the band to form the short-lived Graves. Only took over singing duties although Michale Graves filled in as a guest for a number of shows alongside future Blitzkrieg bandmate Marky Ramone. Robo returned to the band for the first time since the 1980s having played on the band&#x27;s classic &quot;Earth A.D./Wolfsblood&quot; album alongside Jerry and Doyle. Cadena had also played with Robo in Black Flag in the early 1980s. This line-up featured one bonus track only on the &quot;Cuts From The Crypt&quot; compilation. They split up when Doyle left the band after a failed reunion with Glenn Danzig, later joining Danzig instead. Robo and Marky Ramone both handled drum duties for the band on this tour before Robo left once again.

In 2003, Only pieced together a line-up for the &quot;Project 1950&quot; cover album which featured himself, Cadena and Marky Ramone. The band toured to support the album and released one single, once again a cover for &quot;The Day The Earth Caught Fire&quot; by Japan&#x27;s Balzac. Cadena also played lead guitar for punk rock supergroup Osaka Popstar during this period, along with Jerry Only, Marky Ramone, John Cafiero and Ivan Julian. The band has released one album to date, &quot;Osaka Popstar and the American Legends of Punk&quot;, in 2006. In 2005 and 2006, Cadena was also a member of the raucous Hermosa Beach bar band, The Jim Mellon Quartet.

Around 2006, Marky left Misfits and was replaced by Robo for the 30th Anniversary Tour. In 2007 Only announced that this line-up would release a new album. This was delayed due to the bands&#x27; relentless touring. Eventually in 2009 the band released a new single &quot;Land of the Dead&quot; before once again ejecting Robo from the band due to constant visa problems. Cadena was also a judge for the 8th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists during this time.

The band then hired Murphy&#x27;s Law drummer Eric Arce who had filled in for the band on various shows over the past ten years. The band was then in the studio to finally record their new album &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rain&quot; in 2011, with Cadena writing and singing a number of songs. The album was met with mixed reviews despite debuting at number 70 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The band toured worldwide in support of the album following its release.

Between Misfits tours, Cadena plays in the NY/NJ area as &quot;Dez Cadena + The Broken Down Bitches&quot;. He is currently working on a solo record featuring guest musicians and friends.

Cadena also contributed vocals to the song &quot;From The Shadows&quot; from &quot;Recognise&quot;, the debut album from UK band JD &amp; the FDCs, which was released in July 2012. Former WWE Women&#x27;s Champion Amy Dumas also appears on the track. A video, featuring Cadena, was released on March 4, 2013.

===Post-Misfits===
On Monday June 22, 2015, Cadena announced he was no longer in Misfits. In August 2015, it was revealed he was battling cancer.

On October 25, 2015, Cadena began performing with Jon Caspi &amp; The First Gun on guitar and singing lead on a few songs during live performances. Together, Cadena and Jon Caspi &amp; The First Gun recorded a song called &quot;SUN&quot; which was digitally released on Brighton Bar Records in February 2016. The video for the song was released on April 19, 2016.

Cadena has also been performing with his band The Buzz Aldrin Trio, playing a variety of material which has included covers of Black Flag, Television, Wire, and The Sex Pistols.

As of 2017, he has been performing and recording with Jon Caspi and the First Gun, as well as his outfit Mister Stratosphere.

Cadena continues to play and record with Jon Caspi and the First Gun, releasing three singles in 2019 (two Jon Caspi originals, &quot;Never Change&quot; and &quot;Stuck On You&quot;, plus a cover of The Who classic &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot;). In May 2020, the band released another single (&quot;Drill a Whole&quot;) from their forthcoming album, &quot;Live at 650&quot;.

In 2021, Cadena contributed lead guitar to a track called &quot;Proof&quot; by the horror punk band Lords of October, written by Uncle Salem, Lucifer Fulci, Aleister Kane, and October Phoenix for their concept album, &quot;Cryptozoology&quot;. The lyric video also featuring Cadena was released on December 25, 2021, on LordsofOctober.com and YouTube.

In September and October 2022, Jon Caspi and the First Gun had several releases on Fake Chapter Records featuring Cadena, including a re-recording of &quot;Raise &#x27;Em High&quot; with special guest Jesse Malin, a &quot;live in the studio&quot; album (&quot;The Studio 650 Sessions&quot;), and a more roots-rock oriented ep (&quot;Raise &#x27;Em High and Other Delights&quot;).

=== FLAG ===
In 2013, Keith Morris, Chuck Dukowski, Dez Cadena, Bill Stevenson and Descendents member Stephen Egerton, created FLAG as an offshoot of Black Flag. As of now, they are only touring. No plans for an album have been announced.

<doc id="147760" wikidata="Q16468" url="?curid=147760" title="Moors murders">
<text>The Moors murders were a series of child killings committed by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley in and around Manchester, England, between July 1963 and October 1965. The victims were five children—Pauline Reade, John Kilbride, Keith Bennett, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans—aged between 10 and 17, at least four of whom were sexually assaulted. The bodies of two of the victims were discovered in 1965, in graves dug on Saddleworth Moor; a third grave was discovered there in 1987, more than twenty years after Brady and Hindley&#x27;s trial. Bennett&#x27;s body is also thought to be buried there, but despite repeated searches it remains undiscovered.

The pair were charged only for the murders of Kilbride, Downey and Evans, and received life sentences under a whole life tariff. The investigation was reopened in 1985 after Brady was reported as having confessed to the murders of Reade and Bennett. Hindley stopped claiming her innocence in 1987 and confessed to all of the murders. After confessing to these additional murders, Brady and Hindley were taken separately to Saddleworth Moor to assist in the search for the graves.

Characterised by the press as &quot;the most evil woman in Britain,&quot; Hindley made several appeals against her life sentence, claiming she was a reformed woman and no longer a danger to society, but was never released. She died in 2002 in West Suffolk Hospital, aged 60, after serving 36 years in prison.

Brady was diagnosed as a psychopath in 1985 and confined in the high-security Ashworth Hospital. He made it clear that he wished to never be released and repeatedly asked to be allowed to die. He died in 2017, at Ashworth, aged 79, having served 51 years.

The murders were the result of what Malcolm MacCulloch, professor of forensic psychiatry at Cardiff University, described as a &quot;concatenation of circumstances&quot;. The trial judge, Justice Fenton Atkinson, described Brady and Hindley in his closing remarks as &quot;two sadistic killers of the utmost depravity&quot;. Their crimes were the subject of extensive worldwide media coverage.

== Background ==
===Ian Brady===
Ian Brady was born in the Gorbals area of Glasgow as Ian Duncan Stewart on 2 January 1938 to Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Stewart, an unmarried tea room waitress. The identity of Brady&#x27;s father has never been reliably ascertained, although his mother said he was a reporter working for a Glasgow newspaper who died three months before Brady was born. Stewart had little support and after a few months was forced to give her son into the care of Mary and John Sloan, a local couple with four children of their own. Brady took their family name and became known as Ian Sloan. His mother continued to visit him throughout his childhood. 

At age 9, Brady visited Loch Lomond with his family, where he reportedly discovered an affinity for the outdoors. A few months later the family moved to a new council house on an overspill estate at Pollok. Various authors have stated that Brady tortured animals, although he objected to such accusations. It was reported, for example, that Brady boasted of killing his first cat when he was aged just 10, and then went on to burn another cat alive, stone dogs and cut off rabbits&#x27; heads.

Brady&#x27;s behaviour worsened when he attended Shawlands Academy, a school for above-average pupils. As a teenager he twice appeared before a juvenile court for housebreaking. Brady left the academy aged 15 and took a job as a tea boy at a Harland and Wolff shipyard in Govan. Nine months later, he began working as a butcher&#x27;s messenger boy. Brady had a girlfriend, Evelyn Grant, but their relationship ended when he threatened her with a flick knife after she visited a dance with another boy. He again appeared before the court, this time with nine charges against him, and shortly before his 17th birthday he was placed on probation on condition that he live with his mother. By then, Brady&#x27;s mother had moved to Manchester and married an Irish fruit merchant named Patrick Brady; Patrick got Ian a job as a fruit porter at Smithfield Market, and Ian took Patrick&#x27;s surname.

Within a year of moving to Manchester, Brady was caught with a sack full of lead seals he had stolen and was trying to smuggle out of the market. He was sent to Strangeways Prison for three months. As he was still under age 18, Brady was sentenced to two years in a borstal for &quot;training.&quot; He was sent to Latchmere House in London, and then Hatfield borstal in the West Riding of Yorkshire. After being discovered drunk on alcohol he had brewed, Brady was moved to the much tougher unit in Hull. Released on 14 November 1957, Brady returned to Manchester, where he took a labouring job which he hated, and was dismissed from another job in a brewery. Deciding to &quot;better himself,&quot; he obtained a set of instruction manuals on bookkeeping from a local public library, with which he &quot;astonished&quot; his parents by studying alone in his room for hours.

In January 1959, Brady applied for, and was offered, a clerical job at Millwards Merchandising, a wholesale chemical distribution company based in Gorton. He was regarded by his colleagues as a quiet, punctual, but short-tempered young man. Brady read books, including &quot;Teach Yourself German&quot; and &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, as well as works on Nazi atrocities. He rode a Tiger Cub motorcycle, which he used to visit the Pennines.

===Myra Hindley===
Myra Hindley was born in Crumpsall on 23 July 1942 to parents Nellie and Bob Hindley, and raised in Gorton, then a working-class area of Manchester dominated by Victorian slum housing. Her father was an alcoholic who was frequently violent towards his wife and children. The family home was in poor condition, and Hindley was forced to sleep in a single bed next to her parents&#x27; double bed. Their living situation deteriorated further when Hindley&#x27;s younger sister, Maureen, was born in August 1946. The following year, five-year-old Myra was sent to live nearby with her grandmother.

Hindley&#x27;s father had served with the Parachute Regiment and was stationed in North Africa, Cyprus and Italy during the Second World War. He had been known as a hard man while in the army and he expected his daughter to be equally tough; he taught her to fight and insisted that she stick up for herself. When Hindley was aged about eight, a local boy scratched her cheeks, drawing blood. She burst into tears and ran to her father, who threatened to &quot;leather&quot; her if she did not retaliate; Hindley found the boy and knocked him down with a series of punches. As she wrote later, &quot;At eight years old I&#x27;d scored my first victory.&quot; Malcolm MacCulloch, professor of forensic psychiatry at Cardiff University, has written that Hindley&#x27;s &quot;relationship with her father brutalised her ... She was not only used to violence in the home but rewarded for it outside. When this happens at a young age, it can distort a person&#x27;s reaction to such situations for life.&quot;

In June 1957, one of Hindley&#x27;s closest friends, 13-year-old Michael Higgins, invited Hindley to go swimming with friends at a local disused reservoir, but she instead went out elsewhere with another friend. Higgins drowned in the reservoir; and Hindleya good swimmerwas deeply upset and blamed herself. She took up a collection for a wreath; his funeral was held at St Francis&#x27;s Monastery in Gorton Lane.

The monastery where Hindley had been baptised a Catholic as an infant in 1942 had a lasting effect on her. Hindley&#x27;s father had insisted she have a Catholic baptism; her mother agreed on the condition that she not be sent to a Catholic school, believing that &quot;all the monks taught was the catechism&quot;. Hindley was increasingly drawn to the Roman Catholic Church after she started at Ryder Brow Secondary Modern and began taking instruction for formal reception into the Church soon after Higgins&#x27; funeral. She took the confirmation name of Veronica and received her First Communion in November 1958.

Hindley&#x27;s first job was as a junior clerk at a local electrical engineering firm. She ran errands, typed, made tea and was well liked enough that when she lost her first week&#x27;s wage packet, the other women took up a collection to replace it. At 17, Hindley became engaged after a short courtship but called it off several months later after deciding the young man was immature and unable to provide her with the life she wanted. She took weekly judo lessons at a local school but found partners reluctant to train with her as she was often slow to release her grip. Hindley took a job at Bratby and Hinchliffe, an engineering company in Gorton, but was dismissed for absenteeism after six months.

===As a couple===
In January 1961, the 18-year-old Hindley joined Millwards as a typist. She soon became infatuated with Brady. Hindley began a diary and, although she had dates with other men, some of the entries detail her fascination with Brady, to whom she eventually spoke for the first time on 27 July. Over the next few months she continued to make entries but grew increasingly disillusioned with Brady, until 22 December when he asked her on a date to the cinema. (Many sources state that the film was &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot;, but Hindley recalled it as &quot;King of Kings&quot;.) 

Brady and Hindley&#x27;s dates followed a regular pattern: a trip to the cinemausually to watch an X-rated filmthen back to Hindley&#x27;s house to drink German wine. Brady then gave Hindley reading material, and the pair spent their work lunch breaks reading aloud to one another from accounts of Nazi atrocities. She began to emulate an ideal of Aryan perfection, bleaching her hair blonde and applying thick crimson lipstick. Hindley occasionally expressed concern at some aspects of Brady&#x27;s character; in a letter to a childhood friend, she mentioned an incident where she had been drugged by Brady but also wrote of her obsession with him. A few months later, she asked her friend to destroy the letter. In her 30,000-word plea for parole submitted to Home Secretary Merlyn Rees, Hindley said:

Hindley began to change her appearance further, wearing clothing considered risqué such as high boots, short skirts and leather jackets. The couple became less sociable to their colleagues. They were regulars at the library, borrowing books on philosophy as well as crime and torture. They also read works by the Marquis de Sade, Friedrich Nietzsche and Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;. Although Hindley was not a qualified driver (she passed her test on 7 November 1963 after failing three times), she often hired a van, in which the couple planned bank robberies. 

Hindley befriended George Clitheroe, the president of the Cheadle Rifle Club, and on several occasions visited two local shooting ranges. Clitheroe, although puzzled by her interest, arranged for her to buy a .22 rifle from a gun merchant in Manchester. She also asked to join a pistol club, but she was a poor shot and allegedly bad-tempered, so Clitheroe told her that she was unsuitable. She did, however, manage to purchase a Webley .45 and a Smith &amp; Wesson .38 from other members of the club. Brady and Hindley&#x27;s plans for robbery came to nothing, but they became interested in photography. Brady already owned a Box Brownie, which he used to take photographs of Hindley and her dog, Puppet, but he upgraded to a more sophisticated model, and also purchased lights and darkroom equipment. The pair took photographs of each other that, for the period, would have been considered explicit. For Hindley, this demonstrated a marked change from her earlier, more shy and prudish nature.

===As murderers===

Hindley claimed that Brady began to talk about &quot;committing the perfect murder&quot; in July 1963, and often spoke to her about Meyer Levin&#x27;s &quot;Compulsion&quot;, published as a novel in 1956 and adapted for the cinema in 1959. The story tells a fictionalised account of the Leopold and Loeb case, two young men from wealthy families who attempt to commit the perfect murder of a 12-year-old boy, and who escape the death penalty because of their age.

By June 1963, Brady had moved in with Hindley at her grandmother&#x27;s house in Bannock Street, Gorton, and on 12 July the two murdered their first victim, 16-year-old Pauline Reade. Reade had attended school with Hindley&#x27;s younger sister Maureen and had also been in a short relationship with David Smith, a local teenager with three criminal convictions for minor crimes. Police found nobody who had seen Reade immediately before her disappearance, and although the 15-year-old Smith was questioned by police, he was cleared of any involvement in her death.

Their next victim, 12-year-old John Kilbride, was lured away from a market in the town of Ashton-under-Lyne on 23 November and murdered on Saddleworth Moor, where his body was buried. A huge search was undertaken, with over 700 statements taken and 500 &quot;missing&quot; posters printed. Eight days after he failed to return home, 2,000 volunteers scoured waste ground and derelict buildings. Hindley hired a vehicle a week after Kilbride went missing, and again on 21 December, apparently to make sure the burial sites at Saddleworth Moor had not been disturbed. In February 1964, she bought a second-hand Austin Traveller but soon after traded it for a Mini van.

Keith Bennett, also aged 12, disappeared in the Longsight district of Manchester on 16 June 1964. His stepfather, Jimmy Johnson, became a suspect; in the two years following Bennett&#x27;s disappearance, Johnson was taken for questioning on four occasions. Detectives searched under the floorboards of the family home, and on discovering that the houses in the row were connected, extended the search to the entire street.

Maureen Hindley married David Smith on 15 August 1964. The marriage was hastily arranged and performed at a register office. None of Maureen&#x27;s relatives attended. Hindley did not approve of the marriage, and her mother was embarrassed, as Maureen was then seven months pregnant. The newlyweds moved into Smith&#x27;s father&#x27;s house. The next day, Brady suggested that the four take a day-trip to Windermere. This was the first time Brady and Smith had met properly, and Brady was apparently impressed by Smith&#x27;s demeanour. The two talked about society, the distribution of wealth and the possibility of robbing a bank. The young Smith was similarly impressed by Brady, who throughout the day had paid for his food and wine. The trip to the Lake District was the first of many outings. Hindley was apparently jealous of their friendship but became closer to her sister.
In 1964, Hindley, her grandmother and Brady were rehoused as part of the postwar slum clearances in Manchester, relocating to 16 Wardle Brook Avenue in the new overspill estate of Hattersley, near the Cheshire town of Hyde. Brady and Hindley became friendly with Patricia Hodges, an 11-year-old girl who lived at 12 Wardle Brook Avenue. Hodges accompanied the couple on their trips to Saddleworth Moor to collect peat, something that many householders on the new estate did to improve the soil in their gardens, which were full of clay and builder&#x27;s rubble. The couple never harmed Hodges, since she lived only a few doors away, which would have made it easier for police to solve any disappearance.

Early on Boxing Day 1964, Hindley left her grandmother at a relative&#x27;s house and refused to allow her back to Wardle Brook Avenue that night. That same day, 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey disappeared from a funfair in Ancoats. Despite a huge search, she was not found. Her stepfather, Alan West, was treated as a suspect by police and repeatedly questioned over her disappearance, but no evidence was uncovered and the disappearance remained unsolved for nearly a year. The following day, Hindley brought her grandmother back home. 

By February 1965, Hodges had stopped visiting Wardle Brook Avenue, but Smith was still a regular visitor. Brady gave Smith books to read, and the two discussed robbery and murder. On Hindley&#x27;s 23rd birthday in July 1965, her sister and brother-in-law, who had until then been living with relatives, were rehoused in Underwood Court, a new multi-storey block of flats not far from Wardle Brook Avenue. The two couples began to see each other more regularly, but usually only on Brady&#x27;s terms.

During the 1990s, Hindley claimed that she took part in the killings only because Brady had drugged her, was blackmailing her with pornographic pictures he had taken of her and had threatened to kill Maureen. In 2008 her solicitor, Andrew McCooey, reported that she told him:

==Murders==
===Pauline Reade===
On 12 July 1963, Brady told Hindley that he wanted to commit the &quot;perfect murder.&quot; After work he instructed her to drive a borrowed van around the area while he followed on his motorcycle; when he spotted a likely victim he would flash his headlight. Driving down Gorton Lane, Brady saw a young girl and signalled Hindley, who did not stop because she recognised the girl as an eight-year-old neighbour of her mother. Sometime after 7:30 p.m., on Froxmer Street, Brady signalled Hindley to stop for 16-year-old Pauline Reade, a schoolmate of Hindley&#x27;s sister Maureen on her way to a dance; Hindley offered Reade a lift. At various times Hindley gave conflicting statements about the extent to which she, versus Brady, was responsible for Reade being selected as their first victim, but said she felt that there would be less attention given to the disappearance of a teenager than of a young child.

Once Reade was in the van, Hindley asked her to help in searching Saddleworth Moor for an expensive lost glove; Reade agreed and they drove there. When Brady arrived on his motorcycle, Hindley told Reade he would be helping in the search. Hindley later claimed that she waited in the van while Brady took Reade onto the moor. Brady returned alone after about thirty minutes, and took Hindley to the spot where Reade lay dying; Reade&#x27;s clothes were in disarray and she had been nearly decapitated by two cuts to the throat, including a four-inch incision across her voice box &quot;inflicted with considerable force&quot; and into which the collar of her coat and a throat chain had been pushed. When Hindley asked Brady whether he had raped Reade, Brady replied, &quot;Of course I did.&quot; Hindley stayed with Reade while Brady retrieved a spade he had hidden nearby on a previous visit, then returned to the van while Brady buried Reade. In Brady&#x27;s account, Hindley was not only present for the attack, but participated in the sexual assault.

===John Kilbride===
In the early evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in Ashton-under-Lyne, Brady and Hindley offered 12-year-old John Kilbride a lift home, also promising him a bottle of sherry. Once Kilbride was inside Hindley&#x27;s hired Ford Anglia car, Brady said they would have to make a detour to their home for the sherry. Brady then suggested another detour, this time to search for a glove Hindley had lost on Saddleworth Moor. When they reached the moor, Brady took Kilbride with him while Hindley waited in the car. Brady then sexually assaulted Kilbride and tried to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before strangling him with a shoelace or string. He then buried his body in a shallow grave and, at some point afterwards, photographed Hindley and her pet dog standing atop the recently-disturbed ground.

===Keith Bennett===
Early in the evening of 16 June 1964, Hindley asked 12-year-old Keith Bennett, who was on his way to his grandmother&#x27;s house in Longsight, for help in loading some boxes into her Mini Pick-up, after which she said she would drive him home. Brady was in the back of the van. Hindley drove to a lay-by on Saddleworth Moor and Brady went off with Bennett, supposedly looking for a lost glove. After about thirty minutes Brady returned alone, carrying a spade that he had hidden there earlier, and, in response to Hindley&#x27;s questions, said that he had sexually assaulted Bennett and strangled him with a piece of string.

===Lesley Ann Downey===
Brady and Hindley visited a funfair in Ancoats on 26 December 1964 and noticed that 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey was apparently alone. They approached her and deliberately dropped some shopping they were carrying, then asked her for help in taking the packages to their car, and then to Wardle Brook Avenue. At the house, Downey was undressed, gagged and forcibly posed for photographs before being raped and killed, perhaps strangled with a piece of string. The attack was recorded on a reel-to-reel audio tape, with both Brady and Hindley&#x27;s voices appearing, as their victim screamed and begged for mercy. Hindley later maintained that she went to run a bath for Downey and found the victim dead when she returned; Brady claimed that Hindley committed the murder. The following morning Brady and Hindley drove Downey&#x27;s body to Saddleworth Moor and buried hernaked with her clothes at her feetin a shallow grave.

===Edward Evans===
On the evening of 6 October 1965, Hindley drove Brady to Manchester Central railway station, where she waited outside in the car whilst he selected a victim. After a few minutes Brady reappeared in the company of 17-year-old Edward Evans, an apprentice engineer who lived in Ardwick, to whom he introduced Hindley as his sister. Brady later claimed that he had picked up Evans for a sexual encounter. They drove to Brady and Hindley&#x27;s home at Wardle Brook Avenue, where they relaxed over a bottle of wine.

At some point Brady sent Hindley to fetch Smith, her brother-in-law. Although Hindley&#x27;s family had not approved of Maureen&#x27;s marriage to Smith, Brady had been cultivating a friendship with his brother-in-law, who had become &quot;in awe&quot; of Brady, something that increasingly worried Hindley as she felt it compromised their safety. Hindley returned with Smith and told him to wait outside for her signal, a flashing light. When the signal came, Smith knocked on the door and was met by Brady, who asked if he had come for &quot;the miniature wine bottles&quot; and left him in the kitchen, saying that he was going to collect the wine. Smith later told the police:

Smith then watched Brady throttle Evans with a length of electrical cord. Brady sprained his ankle in the struggle, and Evans&#x27; body was too heavy for Smith to carry to the car on his own, so they wrapped it in plastic sheeting and put it in the spare bedroom with the intention of disposing of it later.

== Investigation ==
=== Arrest ===
After the murder of Evans, Smith agreed to return the following morning with his dead daughter&#x27;s pram, to transport the body to the car before disposing of it on Saddleworth Moor. He arrived home around 3:00 a.m. and asked his wife to make a cup of tea, which he drank before vomiting and telling her what he had witnessed. At 6:10 a.m., having waited for daylight and armed himself with a screwdriver and bread knifein case Brady was planning to intercept himSmith called police from a phone box on the estate. He was picked up by a police car from the phone box and taken to Hyde police station, where he told officers what he had witnessed the previous night.

Police Superintendent Bob Talbot of the Stalybridge police division went to Wardle Brook Avenue, accompanied by a detective sergeant. Wearing a bread deliveryman&#x27;s overall on top of his uniform, he asked Hindley at the back door if her husband was home. When she denied that she had a husband or that a man was in the house, Talbot identified himself. Hindley led him into the living room, where Brady was lying on a divan, writing to his employer about his ankle injury. Talbot explained that he was investigating &quot;an act of violence involving guns&quot; that was reported to have taken place the previous evening. Hindley denied there had been any violence, and allowed police to look around the house. When police asked for the key to the locked spare bedroom, she said it was at her workplace; but after police offered to take her to retrieve it, Brady told her to hand it over. Evans&#x27; body was discovered in the bedroom, and Brady was arrested on suspicion of murder. As Brady was getting dressed, he said, &quot;Eddie and I had a row and the situation got out of hand.&quot;

=== Initial analysis ===
Though Hindley was not initially arrested, she demanded to go with Brady to the police station, taking her dog. She refused to make any statement about Evans&#x27; death beyond claiming it had been an accident, and was allowed to go home on the condition that she return the next day. Over the next four days Hindley visited her employer and asked to be dismissed so that she would be eligible for unemployment benefits. On one of these occasions, she found an envelope belonging to Brady which she burned in an ashtray; she claimed she did not open it but believed it contained plans for bank robberies.

In the meantime, the police were uncovering more evidence and became convinced that Hindley was actively involved in the murder of Evans and other possible victims. On 11 October, she too was arrested and taken into custody. She was charged as an accessory to the murder of Evans and remanded at Risley Prison.

Police searching the house at Wardle Brook Avenue found an old exercise book with the name &quot;John Kilbride&quot;, which made them suspect that Brady and Hindley had been involved in the unsolved disappearances of other children and teenagers. Brady told police that he and Evans had fought, but insisted that he and Smith had murdered Evans and that Hindley had &quot;only done what she had been told.&quot; 

Smith said that Brady had asked him to return anything incriminating, such as &quot;dodgy books&quot;, which Brady then packed into suitcases; he had no idea what else the suitcases contained or where they might be, though he mentioned that Brady &quot;had a thing about railway stations.&quot; A search of left-luggage offices turned up the suitcases at Manchester Central railway station on 15 October; the claim ticket was later found in Hindley&#x27;s prayer book. Inside one of the cases were—among an assortment of costumes, notes, photographs and negatives—nine pornographic photographs of a young girl, soon identified as Downey, naked and with a scarf tied across her mouth, and a sixteen-minute audiotape recording of a girl identifying herself as &quot;Lesley Ann Weston&quot; screaming, crying and pleading to be allowed to return home to her mother. Downey&#x27;s mother was asked by police to look at the two photographs which were deemed appropriate in order to identify her daughter, and also identified the voice from the recording, too, was of her daughter.

Officers making inquiries at neighbouring houses spoke to Hodges, who had on several occasions been taken to Saddleworth Moor by Brady and Hindley, and was able to point out their favourite sites along the A635 road. Police immediately began to search the area, and on 16 October found an arm bone protruding from the peat, which was presumed at first to be that of Kilbride, but which the next day was identified as that of Downey, whose body was still visually identifiable; her mother was able to identify the clothing, which had also been buried in the grave.
Also among the photographs in the suitcase were a number of scenes of the Moors. Smith had told police that Brady had boasted of &quot;photographic proof&quot; of multiple murders, and officers, struck by Brady&#x27;s decision to remove the apparently innocent landscapes from the house, appealed to locals for assistance finding locations to match the photographs. On 21 October they found the &quot;badly decomposed&quot; body of Kilbride, which his mother had to identify by clothing. That same day, already being held for the murder of Evans, Brady and Hindley appeared at Hyde Magistrates&#x27; Court charged with Downey&#x27;s murder. Each was brought before the court separately and remanded into custody for a week. They made a two-minute appearance on 28 October, and were again remanded into custody.

The investigating officers suspected Brady and Hindley of murdering other missing children and teenagers who had disappeared from areas in and around Manchester over the previous few years, and the search continued for a while after the discovery of Kilbride&#x27;s body, but with winter setting in it was called off in November. Various newspapers were also keen to name possible further victims of the &quot;Moors Murders&quot;, with Reade and Bennett being two of them.

Presented with the evidence of the tape recording, Brady admitted to taking the photographs of Downey, but insisted that she had been brought to Wardle Brook Avenue by two men who had subsequently taken her away again, alive. By 2 December, Brady had been charged with the murders of Kilbride, Downey and Evans. Hindley had been charged with the murders of Downey and Evans, and being an accessory to the murder of Kilbride. At the committal hearing on 6 December, Brady was charged with the murders of Evans, Kilbride, and Downey, and Hindley with the murders of Evans and Downey, as well as with harbouring Brady in the knowledge that he had killed Kilbride. The prosecution&#x27;s opening statement was held &quot;in chambers&quot; rather than in open court, and the defence asked for a similar stipulation but was refused. The proceedings continued before three magistrates in Hyde over an eleven-day period during December, at the end of which the pair were committed for trial at Chester Assizes.

Many of the photographs taken by Brady and Hindley on the moor featured Hindley&#x27;s dog Puppet, sometimes as a puppy. To help date the photos, detectives had a veterinary surgeon examine the dog to determine his age; the examination required a general anaesthetic from which Puppet did not recover. Hindley was furious, and accused the police of murdering the dog – one of the few occasions detectives witnessed any emotional response from her. Hindley wrote to her mother:
=== Trial ===
The 14-day trial began in a specially-prepared court room at Chester Assizes before Mr Justice Fenton Atkinson, on 19 April 1966. The dock was fitted with bulletproof glass to protect Brady and Hindley because it was feared that someone might try to kill them, such was the public outrage at the crimes. Other elaborate security precautions included a public address system costing £2,500 and £500 worth of telephone equipment. National and international journalists covering the trial booked up most of the city&#x27;s hotel rooms. Onlookers – some travelling for hours – would stand outside Chester Assizes every day during the trial.

Brady and Hindley were charged with murdering Evans, Downey and Kilbride. The Attorney General, Sir Elwyn Jones, led the prosecution, assisted by William Mars-Jones. Brady was defended by Emlyn Hooson QC, the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP), and Hindley was defended by Godfrey Heilpern QC, recorder of Salford from 1964; both were experienced Queen&#x27;s Counsel.

Smith was the chief prosecution witness. Before the trial, the &quot;News of the World&quot; newspaper offered £1,000 to Smith for the rights to his story; the American &quot;People&quot; magazine made a competing offer of £6,000 (equivalent to about £ and £ respectively in ). When Smith accepted the &quot;News of the World&quot; offer—its editors had promised additional future payments for syndication and serialisation—he agreed to be paid £15 weekly until the trial, and £1,000 in a lump sum if Brady and Hindley were convicted. During the trial, the judge and defence barristers repeatedly questioned Smith and his wife about the nature of the arrangement. At first, Smith refused to name the newspaper, risking contempt of court; when he eventually identified the &quot;News of the World&quot;, Jones, as Attorney General, immediately promised an investigation. Comparing Smith&#x27;s testimony with his initial statements to police, Atkinson—though describing the paper&#x27;s actions as &quot;gross interference with the course of justice&quot;—concluded it was not &quot;substantially affected&quot; by the financial incentive. Jones decided not to charge the &quot;News of the World&quot; on similar grounds.

Both Brady and Hindley entered pleas of not guilty; Brady testified for over eight hours, Hindley for six. Brady admitted to striking Evans with the axe, but claimed that someone else had &quot;killed&quot; Evans, pointing to the pathologist&#x27;s statement that his death had been &quot;accelerated by strangulation&quot;; Brady&#x27;s &quot;calm, undisguised arrogance did not endear him to the jury [and] neither did his pedantry&quot;, wrote Duncan Staff. Hindley denied any knowledge that the photographs of Saddleworth Moor found by police had been taken near the graves of their victims.

The sixteen-minute tape recording of Downey, on which the voices of Brady and Hindley were audible, was played in open court. Hindley admitted that her attitude towards Downey was &quot;brusque and cruel&quot;, but claimed that was only because she was afraid that someone might hear the child&#x27;s screams. Hindley claimed that when Downey was being undressed she herself was &quot;downstairs&quot;; when the pornographic photographs were taken she was &quot;looking out the window&quot;; and that when Downey was being strangled she &quot;was running a bath&quot;.

On 6 May, after having deliberated for a little over two hours, the jury found Brady guilty of all three murders, and Hindley guilty of the murders of Downey and Evans. As the death penalty for murder had been abolished six months earlier, the judge passed the only sentence that the law now allowed for murder: life imprisonment. Brady was sentenced to three concurrent life sentences and Hindley was given two, plus a concurrent seven-year term for harbouring Brady in the knowledge that he had murdered Kilbride. Brady was taken to HM Prison Durham and Hindley was sent to HM Prison Holloway.

In his closing remarks, Mr Justice Atkinson described the murders as &quot;truly horrible&quot; and the accused as &quot;two sadistic killers of the utmost depravity&quot;; he recommended they spend &quot;a very long time&quot; in prison before being considered for parole, but did not stipulate a tariff. Anyone sentenced to life imprisonment would be liable to spend the rest of his or her natural life in prison, but could be paroled on life licence by the Home Secretary on recommendation of the Parole Board.

He described Brady as &quot;wicked beyond belief&quot; and said he saw no reasonable possibility of reform and suitability for parole for him, though he did not think the same necessarily true of Hindley once &quot;removed from [Brady&#x27;s] influence&quot;. Throughout the trial Brady and Hindley &quot;stuck rigidly to their strategy of lying&quot;, and Hindley was later described as &quot;a quiet, controlled, impassive witness who lied remorselessly&quot;.

=== Later investigation ===
Since Brady and Hindley&#x27;s arrests, newspapers had been keen to connect them to other missing children and teenagers from the area. One such victim was Stephen Jennings, a three-year-old West Yorkshire boy who was last seen alive in December 1962; his body was found buried in a field in 1988, but the following year his father, William Jennings, was found guilty of his murder. Jennifer Tighe, a 14-year-old girl who disappeared from an Oldham children&#x27;s home in December 1964, was mentioned in the press some forty years later but was confirmed by police to be alive. This followed claims in 2004 that Hindley had told another inmate that she and Brady had murdered a sixth victim, a teenage girl.

In 1985, Brady allegedly told Fred Harrison, a journalist working for &quot;The Sunday People&quot;, that he had killed Reade and Bennett, something the police already suspected as both lived near Brady and Hindley and had disappeared at about the same time as Kilbride and Downey. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) reopened the investigation, now to be headed by Detective Chief Superintendent Peter Topping, head of GMP&#x27;s Criminal Investigation Department (CID).

On 3 July 1985, DCS Topping visited Brady, then being held at HM Prison Gartree in Leicestershire, but found him &quot;scornful of any suggestion that he had confessed to more murders&quot;. Police nevertheless decided to resume their search of Saddleworth Moor, once more using the photographs taken by Brady and Hindley to help them identify possible burial sites. In November 1986, Bennett&#x27;s mother wrote to Hindley begging to know what had happened to her son, a letter that Hindley seemed to be &quot;genuinely moved&quot; by. It ended: &quot;I am a simple woman, I work in the kitchens of Christie&#x27;s Hospital. It has taken me five weeks labour to write this letter because it is so important to me that it is understood by you for what it is, a plea for help. Please, Miss Hindley, help me.&quot;

Police visited Hindley – then being held in HM Prison Cookham Wood in Kent – a few days after she received the letter, and although she refused to admit any involvement in the killings, she agreed to help by looking at photographs and maps to try to identify spots she had visited with Brady. She showed particular interest in photos of the area around Hollin Brown Knoll and Shiny Brook, but said that it was impossible to be sure of the locations without visiting the moor. Home Secretary Douglas Hurd agreed with DCS Topping that a visit would be worth risking despite security problems presented by threats against Hindley. Writing in 1989, Topping said that he felt &quot;quite cynical&quot; about Hindley&#x27;s motivation in helping the police. Although Winnie Johnson&#x27;s letter may have played a part, he believed that Hindley, knowing of Brady&#x27;s &quot;precarious&quot; mental state, was concerned he might co-operate with the police and reap any available public-approval benefit.

On 16 December 1986, Hindley made the first of two visits to assist the police search of the moor. Police closed all roads onto the moor, which was patrolled by 200 officers, some armed. Hindley and her solicitor left Cookham Wood at 4:30 a.m., flew to the moor by helicopter from an airfield near Maidstone, and then were driven, and walked, around the area until 3:00 pm. Hindley had difficulty connecting what she saw to her memories, and was apparently nervous of the helicopters flying overhead. The press described the visit as a &quot;fiasco&quot;, a &quot;publicity stunt&quot;, and a &quot;mindless waste of money&quot;, but DCS Topping defended it, saying &quot;we needed a thorough systematic search of the moor ... It would never have been possible to carry out such a search in private.&quot;

On 19 December, David Smith, then 38, spent about four hours on the moor helping police identify additional areas to be searched. DCS Topping continued to visit Hindley in prison, along with her solicitor Michael Fisher and her spiritual counsellor, Peter Timms, who had been a prison governor before becoming a Methodist minister. On 10 February 1987 Hindley formally confessed to involvement in all five murders, but this was not made public for more than a month. The tape recording of her statement was over seventeen hours long; Topping described it as a &quot;very well worked out performance in which, I believe, she told me just as much as she wanted me to know, and no more&quot;. He added that he &quot;was struck by the fact that [in Hindley&#x27;s telling] she was never there when the killings took place. She was in the car, over the brow of the hill, in the bathroom and even, in the case of the Evans murder, in the kitchen&quot;; he felt he &quot;had witnessed a great performance rather than a genuine confession&quot;.

Police visited Brady in prison again and told him of Hindley&#x27;s confession, which at first he refused to believe. Once presented with some of the details that Hindley had provided of Reade&#x27;s abduction, Brady decided that he too was prepared to confess, but on one condition: that immediately afterwards he be given the means to commit suicide, a request with which it was impossible for the authorities to comply.

At about the same time, Johnson sent Hindley another letter, again pleading with her to assist the police in finding the body of her son Keith. In the letter, Johnson was sympathetic to Hindley over the criticism surrounding her first visit. Hindley, who had not replied to the first letter, responded by thanking Johnson for both letters, explaining that her decision not to reply to the first resulted from the negative publicity that surrounded it. She claimed that, had Johnson written to her fourteen years earlier, she would have confessed and helped the police. She also paid tribute to DCS Topping, and thanked Johnson for her sincerity. Hindley made her second visit to the moor in March 1987. This time, the level of security surrounding her visit was considerably higher. She stayed overnight in Manchester, at the flat of the police chief in charge of GMP training at Sedgley Park, Prestwich, and visited the moor twice. Hindley confirmed to police that the two areas in which they were concentrating their search—Hollin Brown Knoll and Hoe Grain—were correct, although she was unable to locate either of the graves. She did, though, later remember that as Reade was being buried she had been sitting next to her on a patch of grass and could see the rocks of Hollin Brown Knoll silhouetted against the night sky.

In April 1987, news of Hindley&#x27;s confession became public. Amidst strong media interest Lord Longford pleaded for her release, writing that continuing her detention to satisfy &quot;mob emotion&quot; was not right. Fisher persuaded Hindley to release a public statement, which touched on her reasons for denying her guilt previously, her religious experiences in prison, and the letter from Johnson. She said that she saw no possibility of release, and also exonerated Smith from any part in the murders other than that of Evans.

Over the next few months interest in the search waned, but Hindley&#x27;s clue had focused efforts on a specific area. On 1 July, after more than 100 days of searching, they found Reade&#x27;s body below the surface, from where Downey&#x27;s had been found. Brady had been co-operating with the police for some time, and when this news reached him he made a formal confession to DCS Topping, and in a statement to the press said that he too would help police in their search. He was taken to the moor on 3 July but seemed to lose his bearings, blaming changes in the intervening years; the search was called off at 3:00 pm, by which time a large crowd of press and television reporters had gathered on the moor.

DCS Topping refused to allow Brady a second visit to the moor before police called off their search on 24 August. Brady was taken to the moor a second time on 8 December, and claimed to have located Bennett&#x27;s burial site, but the body was never found.

Soon after his first visit to the moor, Brady wrote a letter to a BBC reporter, giving some sketchy details of five additional deaths that he claimed to have been involved in: a man in the Piccadilly area of Manchester, another victim on Saddleworth Moor, two more in Scotland, and a woman whose body was allegedly dumped in a canal. Police, failing to discover any unsolved crimes matching the details that he supplied, decided that there was insufficient evidence to launch an official investigation. Hindley told Topping that she knew nothing of these killings.

Although Brady and Hindley had confessed to the murders of Reade and Bennett, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) decided that nothing would be gained by a further trial; as both were already serving life sentences no further punishment could be inflicted.

In 2003, the police launched Operation Maida, and again searched the moor for Bennett&#x27;s body, this time using sophisticated resources such as a US reconnaissance satellite which could detect soil disturbances. In mid-2009, the GMP said they had exhausted all avenues in the search for Bennett, that &quot;only a major scientific breakthrough or fresh evidence would see the hunt for his body restart&quot;. It was stated that any further participation by Brady would be via a &quot;walk through the moors virtually&quot; using 3D modelling, rather than a visit by him to the moor. Donations from the public funded a search by volunteers from a Welsh search and rescue team in 2010. In 2012, it was claimed that Brady may have given details of the location of Bennett&#x27;s body to a visitor; a woman was subsequently arrested on suspicion of preventing the burial of a body without lawful excuse, but a few months later the Crown Prosecution Service announced that there was insufficient evidence to press charges. In 2017, the police asked a court to order that two locked briefcases owned by Brady be opened, arguing that they might contain clues to the location of Bennett&#x27;s body; the application was declined on the grounds that no prosecution was likely to result.

On 30 September 2022, Greater Manchester Police began a search for human remains on the moor after receiving information from amateur investigator and author Russell Edwards, who had reportedly found a skull. After seeing a photograph of a jaw bone, a spokesperson for the police said, of the identity of the remains, that it was &quot;far too early to be certain&quot;. On 1 October the police reported that no further remains had been found. On 7 October the police announced they had ended their search without finding any sign of human remains.

==Incarceration==

===Brady===

Following his conviction Brady was moved to HM Prison Durham, where he asked to live in solitary confinement. He spent nineteen years in mainstream prisons before being diagnosed as a psychopath in November 1985 and sent to the high-security Park Lane Hospital, now Ashworth Hospital, in Maghull, Merseyside; he made it clear that he never wanted to be released.

The trial judge recommended that Brady&#x27;s life sentence should mean life, and successive Home Secretaries agreed with that decision. In 1982, the Lord Chief Justice Lord Lane said of Brady: &quot;this is the case if ever there is to be one when a man should stay in prison till he dies&quot;. The November 2007 death of John Straffen, who had spent 55 years in prison for murdering three children, meant that Brady became the longest-serving prisoner in England and Wales.

Although Brady refused to work with Ashworth&#x27;s psychiatrists, he occasionally corresponded with people outside the hospitalsubject to prison authorities&#x27; censorship including Lord Longford, writer Colin Wilson, and various journalists. In one letter, written in 2005, Brady claimed that the murders were &quot;merely an existential exercise of just over a year, which was concluded in December 1964&quot;. By then, he claimed, he and Hindley had turned their attention to armed robbery, for which they had begun to prepare by acquiring guns and vehicles.

During several years of interactions with forensic psychologist Chris Cowley, including face-to-face meetings, Brady told him of an &quot;aesthetic fascination [he had] with guns&quot;, despite his never having used one to kill. He complained bitterly about conditions at Ashworth, which he hated. In 1999, his right wrist was broken in what he claimed was an &quot;hour-long, unprovoked attack&quot; by staff. Brady subsequently went on hunger strike, but while English law allows patients to refuse treatment, those being treated for mental disorders under the Mental Health Act 1983 have no such right if the treatment is for their mental disorder. He was therefore force-fed and transferred to another hospital for tests after he fell ill. Brady recovered and in March 2000 asked for a judicial review of the legality of the decision to force-feed him, but was refused permission.

In 2001, Brady wrote &quot;The Gates of Janus&quot;, which was published by the US underground publisher Feral House. The book, Brady&#x27;s analysis of serial murder and specific serial killers, sparked outrage when announced in the UK. In the book, Brady recounted his friendship in prison with the &quot;teacup poisoner&quot; Graham Young, who shared Brady&#x27;s admiration for Nazi Germany.

According to Cowley, Brady regretted Hindley&#x27;s imprisonment and the consequences of their actions, but not necessarily the crimes themselves. He saw no point in making any kind of public apology; instead, he &quot;expresse[d] remorse through actions&quot;. Twenty years of transcribing classical texts into braille came to an end when the authorities confiscated Brady&#x27;s translation machine, for fear it might be used as a weapon. He once offered to donate one of his kidneys to &quot;someone, anyone who needed one&quot;, but was blocked from doing so. According to Wilson, &quot;it was because these attempts to express remorse were thrown back at him that he began to contemplate suicide&quot;. In 2006 officials intercepted 50 paracetamol pills hidden inside a hollowed-out crime novel sent to Brady by a female friend.

The mother of the remaining undiscovered victim, Keith Bennett, received a letter from Brady at the end of 2005 in which, she said, he claimed that he could take police to within of her son&#x27;s body but the authorities would not allow it. He did not refer directly to Bennett by name and did not claim he could take investigators directly to the grave, but spoke of the &quot;clarity&quot; of his recollections.

In 2012, Brady applied to be returned to prison, reiterating his desire to starve himself to death. At a mental health tribunal in June the following year, he claimed that he suffered not from paranoid schizophrenia, as his doctors at Ashworth maintained, but a personality disorder. Brady&#x27;s application was rejected and the judge stated that he &quot;continues to suffer from a mental disorder which is of a nature and degree which makes it appropriate for him to continue to receive medical treatment&quot;.

After receiving end-of-life care, Brady died of restrictive pulmonary disease at Ashworth Hospital on 15 May 2017; the inquest found that he died of natural causes and that his hunger strike had not been a contributory factor. Brady had refused food and fluids for more than forty-eight hours on various occasions, causing him to be fitted with a nasogastric tube, although his inquest noted that his body mass index was not a cause for concern. He was cremated without a ceremony, and his ashes disposed of at sea during the night.

===Hindley===
Hindley lodged an unsuccessful appeal against her conviction immediately after the trial. She corresponded with Brady by letter until 1971, when she ended their relationship. The two remained in sporadic contact for several months, but Hindley had fallen in love with one of her prison warders, Patricia Cairns. A former assistant governor claimed that such relationships were not unusual in Holloway at that time, as &quot;many of the officers were gay, and involved in relationships either with one another or with inmates&quot;. Hindley successfully petitioned to have her status as a Category A prisoner changed to Category B, which enabled Governor Dorothy Wing to take her on a walk round Hampstead Heath, part of her unofficial policy of reintroducing her charges to the outside world when she felt they were ready. The excursion caused a furore in the national press and earned Wing an official rebuke from the then-Home Secretary Robert Carr. With help from Cairns, and the outside contacts of another prisoner, Maxine Croft, Hindley planned a prison escape, but it was thwarted when impressions of the prison keys were intercepted by an off-duty policeman. Cairns was sentenced to six years in jail for her part in the plot.

Hindley was told that she should spend twenty-five years in prison before being considered for parole. The Lord Chief Justice agreed with that recommendation in 1982, but in January 1985 Home Secretary Leon Brittan increased her tariff to thirty years. By that time Hindley claimed to be a reformed Catholic. Downey&#x27;s mother was at the centre of a campaign to ensure that Hindley was never released from prison, and until her death in February 1999, she regularly gave television and newspaper interviews whenever Hindley&#x27;s release was rumoured. In February 1985, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told Brittan that his proposed minimum sentences of thirty years for Hindley and forty years for Brady were too short, saying, &quot;I do not think that either of these prisoners should ever be released from custody. Their crime was the most hideous and cruel in modern times.&quot;

In 1987, Hindley admitted that the plea for parole she had submitted to the Home Secretary eight years earlier was &quot;on the whole ... a pack of lies&quot;, and to some reporters her co-operation in the searches on Saddleworth Moor &quot;appeared a cynical gesture aimed at ingratiating herself to the parole authorities&quot;. Then-Home Secretary David Waddington imposed a whole life tariff on Hindley in July 1990, after she confessed to having been more involved in the murders than she had admitted. Hindley was not informed of the decision until 1994, when a Law Lords ruling obliged the Prison Service to inform all life sentence prisoners of the minimum period they must serve in prison before being considered for parole. In 1996, the Parole Board recommended that Hindley be moved to an open prison. She rejected the idea and in early 1998 was moved to the medium-security HM Prison Highpoint; the House of Lords ruling left open the possibility of later freedom. Between December 1997 and March 2000, Hindley made three separate appeals against her life tariff, claiming she was a reformed woman and no longer a danger to society, but each was rejected by the courts.

When in 2002 another life sentence prisoner challenged the Home Secretary&#x27;s power to set minimum terms, Hindley and hundreds of others, whose tariffs had been increased by politicians, looked likely to be released. Hindley&#x27;s release seemed imminent and plans were made by supporters for her to be given a new identity. Home Secretary David Blunkett ordered the GMP to find new charges against Hindley to prevent her release from prison. The investigation was headed by Superintendent Tony Brett, and initially looked at charging Hindley with the murders of Reade and Bennett, but the advice given by government lawyers was that because of the DPP&#x27;s decision taken fifteen years earlier, a new trial would probably be considered an abuse of process.

On 25 November 2002, the Law Lords agreed that judges, not politicians, should decide how long a criminal spends behind bars, and stripped the Home Secretary of the power to set minimum sentences. Just prior to this, on 15November 2002, Hindley, aged 60 and a chain smoker, died from bronchial pneumonia at West Suffolk Hospital. She had been diagnosed with angina in 1999 and hospitalised after suffering a brain aneurysm. Camera crews &quot;stood rank and file behind steel barriers&quot; outside, but none of Hindley&#x27;s relatives were among the small congregation of eight to ten people who attended a short service at Cambridge crematorium. Such was the strength of feeling more than thirty-five years after the murders that a reported twenty local undertakers refused to handle her cremation. Four months later, her ashes were scattered by her ex-partner, Patricia Cairns, less than from Saddleworth Moor in Stalybridge Country Park. The &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; reported on possible fears that this would result in visitors choosing to avoid or vandalise the park.

==Aftermath==
David Smith became &quot;reviled by the people of Manchester&quot; for financially profiting from the murders. During the trial, Maureen—eight months pregnant—was attacked in the lift of the building in which she and Smith lived. Their home was vandalised, they regularly received hate mail, and Maureen wrote that she could not let her children out of her sight when they were small. After declining to prosecute the &quot;News of the World&quot;, Attorney General Sir Elwyn Jones came under political pressure to impose new regulations on the press, but was reluctant to legislate on &quot;chequebook journalism&quot;. Instead, he accepted the offer of the Press Council to produce a &quot;declaration of principle&quot; which was published in November 1966 and included rules forbidding criminal witnesses being paid or interviewed—but the &quot;News of the World&quot; promptly rejected the declaration and the council had no power to enforce its provisions.

After stabbing another man during a fight, in an attack he claimed was triggered by the abuse he had suffered since the trial, Smith was sentenced to three years in prison in 1969. That same year his children were taken into the care of the local authority. Maureen moved from Underwood Court to a single-bedroom property, and found work in a department store. Subjected to whispering campaigns and petitions to remove her from the estate where she lived, Maureen received no support from her family—her mother had supported Myra during the trial. On his release from prison, Smith moved in with a 15-year-old girl who became his second wife and won custody of his three sons. Maureen managed to repair the relationship with her mother, and moved into a council property in Gorton. She divorced Smith in 1973, and married a lorry driver, Bill Scott, with whom she had a daughter.

Maureen and her immediate family made regular visits to see Hindley, who reportedly adored her niece. In 1980, Maureen suffered a brain haemorrhage; Hindley was allowed to visit her in hospital, but arrived an hour after her death. Sheila and Patrick Kilbride, who were by then divorced, attended Maureen&#x27;s funeral thinking that Hindley might be there; Patrick mistook Bill Scott&#x27;s daughter from a previous relationship for Hindley and tried to attack her. Shortly before her death at the age of 70, Sheila said: &quot;If she [Hindley] ever comes out of jail I&#x27;ll kill her&quot;. It was a threat repeated by her son Danny.

In 1972, Smith was acquitted of the murder of his father, who had been suffering from terminal cancer. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to two days&#x27; detention. He remarried and moved to Lincolnshire with his three sons, and was exonerated of any participation in the Moors murders by Hindley&#x27;s confession in 1987. In 2011, he co-authored the book &quot;Witness&quot; with biographer Carol Ann Lee. Smith died from cancer in Ireland in 2012.

Reade&#x27;s mother was admitted to Springfield Mental Hospital in Manchester. She was present, under heavy sedation, at the funeral of her daughter on 7 August 1987. Five years after their son was murdered, Sheila and Patrick Kilbride divorced. Downey&#x27;s mother died in 1999 from cancer of the liver. Since her daughter&#x27;s death, she had campaigned to ensure that Hindley remained in prison, and doctors said that the stress had contributed to the severity of her illness. Bennett&#x27;s mother continued to visit Saddleworth Moor, where it is believed that Bennett is buried. She died in August 2012.

Manchester City Council decided in 1987 to demolish the house in which Brady and Hindley had lived on Wardle Brook Avenue, and where Downey and Evans were murdered, citing &quot;excessive media interest [in the property] creating unpleasantness for residents&quot;.

In November 2017 it was revealed that, without the knowledge of her family, some of the remains of Pauline Reade, including her jaw bone, had been kept at the University of Leeds by Greater Manchester Police. GMP apologised to the Reade family. In October 2018 her remains were re-buried at her grave in Gorton Cemetery, Manchester.

===Lasting notoriety ===
The photographs and tape recording of the torture of Downey exhibited in court, and the nonchalant responses of Brady and Hindley, helped to ensure their lasting notoriety. Brady, who said that he did not want to be released, was rarely mentioned in the news, but Hindley&#x27;s insistent desire to be released made her a figure of public hate—especially as she failed to confess to involvement in the Reade and Bennett murders for twenty years. Hindley&#x27;s role in the crimes also violated gender norms: her betrayal of the maternal role fed public perceptions of her &quot;inherent evil&quot;, and made her a &quot;poster girl&quot; for moral panics about serial murder and paedophilia in subsequent decades. Her often reprinted photograph, taken shortly after she was arrested, is described by some commentators as similar to the mythical Medusa and, according to author Helen Birch, has become &quot;synonymous with the idea of feminine evil&quot;. At the 1997 &quot;Sensation&quot; art exhibition, the painting &quot;Myra&quot; caused controversy, as it was a reproduction of Hindley&#x27;s mugshot, shortly after she was arrested, composed of children&#x27;s handprints. Given Hindley&#x27;s status as co-defendant in the first serial murder trial held since the abolition of the death penalty, retribution was a common theme among those who sought to keep her locked away. Even Hindley&#x27;s mother insisted that she should die in prison, partly for fear for Hindley&#x27;s safety. Some commentators expressed the view that of the two, Hindley was the &quot;more evil&quot;.

Lord Longford, a Catholic convert, campaigned to secure the release of &quot;celebrated&quot; criminals, and Hindley in particular, which earned him constant derision from the public and the press. He described Hindley as a &quot;delightful&quot; person and said &quot;you could loathe what people did but should not loathe what they were because human personality was sacred even though human behaviour was very often appalling&quot;. Tabloid newspapers branded him a &quot;loony&quot; and a &quot;do-gooder&quot; for supporting Hindley, whom they described as evil. She became a long-running source of material for the press, which printed embellished tales of her &quot;cushy&quot; life at the &quot;5-star&quot; Cookham Wood Prison and her liaisons with prison staff and other inmates.

The book &quot;The Loathsome Couple&quot; by Edward Gorey (Mead, 1977) was inspired by the Moors murders. Manchester band The Smiths&#x27; song &quot;Suffer Little Children&quot;, from their 1984 self-titled debut album, was also inspired by the case. The case featured in two television dramas in 2006, &quot;See No Evil: The Moors Murders&quot; and &quot;Longford&quot;.

It was first reported in May 1995 that Hindley and Rosemary—who were both incarcerated in HMP Durham at the time—had formed a &quot;friendship&quot;. Hindley denied the claims. Rosemary acknowledged that they knew each other from being on the same wing, but denied further speculation that the two were “having an affair”.

<text>The Osci (also called Oscans, Opici, Opsci, Obsci, Opicans) were an Italic people of Campania and Latium adiectum before and during Roman times. They spoke the Oscan language, also spoken by the Samnites of Southern Italy. Although the language of the Samnites was called Oscan, the Samnites were never referred to as Osci, nor were the Osci called Samnites.

Traditions of the Opici fall into the legendary period of Italian history, roughly from the beginning of the first millennium BC until the foundation of the Roman Republic. No consensus can be reached concerning their location and language. By the end of this period, the Oscan language had evolved and was spoken by a number of sovereign tribal states. By far the most important of these in terms of military prowess and wealth was the Samnites, who rivalled Rome for about 50 years in the second half of the 4th century BC, sometimes being allies, and sometimes at war with the city, until they were finally subdued with considerable difficulty and were incorporated into the Roman state.

The Osci kept their independence by playing one state against another, especially the Romans and Samnites. Their sovereignty was finally lost during the Second Samnite War when, prior to invading Samnium, the Romans found it necessary to secure the border tribes. After the war, the Oscans assimilated quickly to Roman culture. Their cultural legacy survived only in place names and literary references.

==Classical sources==

According to Aristotle, the Opici lived in &quot;the part of Italy towards Tyrrhenia&quot; and were also called Ausones. Antiochus of Syracuse agreed that the Opici were Ausones and placed them in Campania. Strabo, however, the chief source for the fragments of Antiochus, himself distinguished between the Osci and the Ausones, remarking that the Osci had disappeared, but the Romans still used their dialect as a literary language, and that the &quot;high sea&quot; near Sicily was still named Ausonian even though the Ausonians never lived near it. Aurunci is the Roman name for Ausones by a commonplace change of an s to an r in Latin: *Ausuni&gt; *Auruni&gt; *Aurunici&gt; Aurunci. They were perhaps the same people in the early Roman Republic. In the 4th century BC, the names came to be applied to distinct tribes.

==Oscans of the early republic==
A people called the Aurunci by Livy appear the earliest in history. In 503 BC, the Latin colonies of Cora and Pometia rebelled against Roman authority, obtaining the assistance of the Aurunci, seat unknown. Two consular armies sent against them won after a hard-fought battle in which &quot;many more were killed than were taken prisoners; the prisoners were everywhere butchered, even the hostages ... fell a victim to the enemy&#x27;s bloodthirsty rage&quot;. The enemy fell back on Pometia, which was besieged by the Romans. The Aurunci sallied out, burned the siege towers, massacred the troops and grievously wounded one of the consuls. The Romans withdrew but returned later in greater force. Taking the town, they beheaded the Aurunci officers, sold the Pometians into slavery, levelled the buildings and put the land up for sale.

The Aurunci appear one more time in the early republic in a failed attempt to support the Volsci in their struggle against Rome. In 495 BC, putting an army on the march for Rome, they sent envoys ahead to demand the withdrawal of the Romans from Volscian territory. The consul Publius Servilus Priscus Structus met them on the march at Arricia and &quot;in one battle finished the war&quot;. No more is heard of the Oscans for almost a century.

== Conflict and subjugation ==
In the last half of the 4th century BC, the remaining Oscan populations (who were not Samnites) lived in three sovereign states: the Sidicini, the Aurunci and the Ausones. The Sidicini&#x27;s capital city was Teanum, which minted its own coins bearing inscriptions in the Oscan language. The town of Cales was the capital of the Ausones.

===Volscian war===
The beginning of the end of Oscan sovereignty was their attempted exploitation of an opportunity to maraud against the Romans in the period of instability following a major victory against the Volsci, a tribe occupying the Volsci Mountains overlooking and including the Pontine Marshes. During the final revolt of the Volsci, the Romans had sacked and levelled Satricum about 346 BC and had sold the remaining 4,000 fighting men into slavery. For whatever reasons, the Aurunci chose this moment to send a marauding expedition against the Romans. Panic ensued in the city. The senators saw a wider conspiracy with the Latin League. They appointed Lucius Furius Camillus dictator, halted business, drafted an army on the spot and sent it into the field against the Aurunci, but &quot;the war was finished in the very first battle&quot;. The Romans used the army to complete the conquest of the Volsci at Sora.

===First Samnite War===
The Samnites in 343 BC &quot;made an unprovoked attack upon the Sidicini&quot;, who appealed to Campania for military assistance and received it. After losing two battles and being penned within Capua, the Campanians offered themselves to Rome with tears and prostrations in the Senate House. The Senate accepted the offer and granted assistance on the grounds that Campania would be an ally in the rear of the Aequi and Volsci in case of further conflict with them. When Roman envoys presented the Samnite Senate with demands for withdrawal from Campania, the answer was no; moreover, the envoys were allowed to hear staged orders of Samnite commanders to their troops to march on Campania immediately. So began the First Samnite War (343–341 BC).

The Roman Senate declared war, the people ratified the declaration, and two consular armies were sent into Samnium and Campania respectively. For two years the Romans knew only victories until at last the Samnites sued for the restoration of their former alliance with one condition: they would be free to war on the Sidicini if they wished. The Romans had an agreement with Campania, but none with the Sidicini. The Senate bought peace by ratifying the treaty and paying off their army.

===Latin War===
The Samnites used their army to attack the Sidicini again. In desperation, the latter offered themselves to Rome but were turned down on the grounds that they were too late. The Sidicini allied with a force being raised by the Latin league against the Samnites. They were joined by the Campanians. A multi-national army began to devastate Samnium. The Samnites now appealed to Rome under the terms of their treaty, asking if in fact, Rome was sovereign over Campania. The Romans disavowed any agreement that would restrain the Campanians and Latins from making war on whomever else they pleased.

Encouraged by Roman refusal to assume leadership, the Latins made plans to turn their army against Rome once the Samnite threat had been neutralized. Word of the plans leaked to the Romans, who reacted by inviting ten Latin chiefs to Rome to receive orders under the terms of the treaty. As the price for submitting to Rome, the Latins demanded a new common government, with one consul and half the Senate to be elected from the Latins. When Titus Manlius Torquatus, one of the consuls for 340 BC, heard these conditions, he swore by Jupiter&#x27;s statue that if the Senate accepted them he would kill every Latin in the Senate House with drawn sword. Emotional posturing began around the statue; a Latin envoy, Lucius Annaeus, slipped on the stairs while railing against Jupiter and hit his head, becoming unconscious. At that moment, a thunderstorm burst on the Senate House. Interpreting these events as a sign the Romans declared war on the Latins and their allies and allied themselves with the Samnites. The two years of conflict, 340–338, is known as the Latin War.

In a number of legendary battles, the Romans defeated the Latin League, taking away the sovereignty of its tribal states, who subsequently assimilated to Rome. The consul, Lucius Furius Camillus, asked the Senate: &quot;Do you wish to adopt ruthless measures against a people that have surrendered and been defeated? ... Or do you wish to follow the example of your ancestors and make Rome greater by conferring her citizenship on those whom she has defeated?&quot; The Senate chose to offer different terms to different Latin cities. Colonists were placed throughout Latium.

===Fall of Cales===
The Aurunci and Sidicini, who had been perforce in the Latin camp, received separate treaties from Rome. In 337, the Sidicini attacked the Aurunci for no reason given by Livy. The Roman Senate decided that the terms of the latter&#x27;s treaty warranted military intervention, but meanwhile the Aurunci abandoned their towns in Campania in favour of a mountain stronghold, Suessa, which they renamed Aurunca. Further events escalated the conflict: the Ausones of Cales joined the Sidicini. In 335, the Romans sent a consular army under Marcus Valerius Corvus to lay siege to Cales. Informed by an escaped prisoner (who broke his chains and climbed the wall in plain sight without being observed) that the enemy were all drunk and sleeping, Corvus took the city in a night-time rout and garrisoned it. The Senate voted to send 2,500 colonists, to whom enemy land was distributed. The Ausoni were never again sovereign.

===Peace with the Sidicini and Aurunci===
After the fall of Cales, both consular armies were sent against the Sidicini, who fortified themselves in Teanum with a large army. Livy does not reveal the outcome of this campaign. The Romans were struck by a plague (the most typical plague in the region was malaria, carried by the marsh mosquitos); both consuls were relieved for suspicion of impiety, but the Roman army remained among the Sidicini. Livy changes the topic to relations with the Samnites in preparation for his account of the Second Samnite War (326–304 BC). The Sidicini do not appear in that war or ever again in history, but Teanum goes on as Teanum Sidicinum and its territory as Sidicinus ager. If the Romans had fought a great battle and had obliterated the Sidicini there would be some mention of it or some evidence of a discontinuity at Teano. Instead, the city prospers. Smith accords with the general conclusion that between 335 and 326, most likely in 334, the Sidicini consented to lay down their arms and become part of the greater Roman municipality. Livy&#x27;s omission remains unexplained.

The Aurunci similarly disappeared from tradition after they became subject to Rome. After the Samnites were pacified, the region kept the peace and was prosperous. It was a popular vacation spot, being on high ground away from the pestilential air, which today is recognized to be the malaria mosquito.

==Vestiges of the Oscans at Rome==
Their debauchery was adopted by the larger Roman society over time, and the term &quot;Osci loqui&quot; or &quot;Obsci loqui&quot; came to mean licentious or lewd language. Another vestige of the Oscans at Rome was the Atellan Farce, also known as the Oscan Games, which were masked improvised farces in Ancient Rome. The Oscan athletic games were very popular, and usually preceded by longer pantomime plays.

<text>Keith Morris (born September 18, 1955) is an American singer and songwriter known for his role as frontman of the hardcore punk bands Black Flag, Circle Jerks, and Off!. Born and raised in Hermosa Beach, California, he formed Black Flag at the age of 21 with guitarist Greg Ginn and performed on the band&#x27;s 1979 debut EP &quot;Nervous Breakdown&quot;. Shortly after leaving Black Flag in 1979, he formed the Circle Jerks with guitarist Greg Hetson; the band released seven albums between 1980 and 1995 and have broken up and reformed on numerous occasions. In 2009 Morris formed the supergroup Off! with guitarist Dimitri Coats, bassist Steven Shane McDonald, and drummer Mario Rubalcaba. Morris has also appeared as a guest vocalist on several albums by other artists.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Morris was born September 18, 1955, and grew up in Hermosa Beach, California. Morris is Jewish. His father, Jerry, had been a budding jazz drummer in his youth and practiced with visiting jazz groups at the Lighthouse Café. Jerry later opened a bait shop in the 1970s and struck up a friendship with jazz record producer Ozzie Cadena (both men&#x27;s sons, Keith and Dez, later became singers in Black Flag). Keith attended Mira Costa High School, where brothers Greg and Raymond Ginn were also students, and graduated in 1973. He then studied fine art and painting at the Pasadena Arts Center while working at his father&#x27;s bait shop. One of his co-workers at the shop was Bill Stevenson, a Mira Costa student eight years Morris&#x27; junior who would also go on to be a member of Black Flag.

Morris and his friends spent their spare time hanging out by the Strand under Hermosa Beach pier, where they took drugs: &quot;I&#x27;d get off work, and we&#x27;d get up to trouble,&quot; he later recalled, &quot;smoking angel dust, snorting elephant tranquilizers. Just real goofy, &#x27;why-would-you-want-to-do-that?&#x27; kinda stuff, the kind of thing you get up to when you&#x27;re young, and into experimenting. If it was a good experience, then cool; if not, well, then it was just a real hard lesson learned.&quot; His early musical tastes included various rock acts such as Bob Seger, Foreigner, Montrose, Styx, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Queen, Ten Years After, Status Quo, Uriah Heep, UFO, the Scorpions, Aerosmith, Ted Nugent, and the MC5, &quot;any kind of fist-pumping, &#x27;flick-your-bic&#x27; rock. I was into anything that was loud&quot;. He became a freely opinionated and passionate fan of heavy rock and protopunk, and took a job working at local record store Rubicon Records.

===Black Flag===
In 1976, Morris co-founded Black Flag (then-known as Panic) along with guitarist Greg Ginn. Their work ethic proved too challenging for some early members; Ginn and Morris had an especially hard time finding a reliable bass guitarist, and often rehearsed without a bassist, a factor that contributed to the development of Ginn&#x27;s distinctive, often low-pitched guitar sound. The band went through three bass players before Chuck Dukowski joined and then Robo answered a &quot;Pennysaver&quot; ad and became their drummer.

After a number of line-up changes, Morris recorded vocals for the first Black Flag EP &quot;Nervous Breakdown&quot;. After two years in the band, Morris left the band citing, among other reasons, creative differences with Ginn and Dukowski and his own &quot;freaking out on cocaine and speed.&quot; Morris stated in his autobiography he had also become disillusioned with what he saw as Black Flag&#x27;s &quot;militaristic&quot; approach to practicing, despite not getting many shows at the time, and being left &quot;out of the loop&quot; on decisions for the band.

===Circle Jerks===
After leaving Black Flag in 1979, Morris founded the Circle Jerks, along with former Redd Kross guitarist Greg Hetson. They were soon joined by Roger Rogerson (bass) and Lucky Lehrer (drums). In contrast to the top-down decision-making of Black Flag, the Circle Jerks agreed on collective decisions for material and performances. Morris and the band increased their global popularity after being featured in the Penelope Spheeris 1981 documentary &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot;. 
Cited as one of the most important hardcore punk groups, the Circle Jerks were active until 1990, when Hetson left the band to continue playing guitar and release a number of albums with Bad Religion.

The Circle Jerks reunited in 1994 and released their last studio album to date in 1995. The group performed on and off until 2011, when they went back on hiatus. In November 2019, plans were announced for a 2020 reunion tour in support of the 40th anniversary of their 1980 album, &quot;Group Sex&quot;, however the tour was postponed until September 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The band continued touring North and South America with the Descendents in 2023 and 2024.

===Off!===
In 2010, Morris formed Off! with Dimitri Coats from Burning Brides when the Circle Jerks could not agree on material for a new album. They were soon joined by bassist Steven Shane McDonald from Redd Kross and drummer Mario Rubalcaba from Earthless/Rocket From The Crypt/Hot Snakes.

Morris stated in a 2011 interview that Off! was asked to open future dates for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and were agreeable despite potential criticism from their fans. Ultimately, Off! ended up not touring with Red Hot Chili Peppers, though singer Anthony Kiedis wore an Off! hat at every show of the band&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m with You World Tour&quot;, as well as some of their music videos. Morris had performed in place of Kiedis in 1984 when the latter was a no-show for an early RHCP concert in Los Angeles.

Off! released a compilation of their first years&#x27; work on Vice Records, followed by three studio albums. Their final album, &quot;Free LSD&quot;, released in 2022, is to be used as the soundtrack to a science fiction film of the same name due for release in 2024. The film was written and directed by guitarist Dimitri Coats, with band members in starring roles. The band announced their breakup in 2024, performing three farewell shows in July of that year to promote the film and album.

===FLAG===
In 2013, Keith Morris, Chuck Dukowski, Dez Cadena, Bill Stevenson and Descendents member Stephen Egerton, created FLAG as an offshoot of Black Flag. As of 2013, they were only touring. No plans for an album have been announced.

===Other works===
After the Circle Jerks&#x27; first break-up in 1990, Morris led the bands Bug Lamp and Midget Handjob. He also provided backing vocals on &quot;Operation Rescue&quot;, from Bad Religion&#x27;s album &quot;Against the Grain&quot; (1990).

Morris also narrated Chris Fuller&#x27;s 2007 Gotham Award-nominated independent film &quot;Loren Cass&quot;.

Morris appeared as the DJ for the West Coast Punk Rock station Channel X in the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; released on September 17, 2013.

In 2016, Morris released an autobiography called &quot;My Damage: The Story of a Punk Rock Survivor.&quot;

===Personal life===
After years of addiction to drugs and alcohol, Morris has been sober since 1988.
In 1999, he was diagnosed with adult onset diabetes.

On April 13, 2022, it was revealed on the Circle Jerks&#x27; Facebook page that Morris had contracted and was recovering from COVID-19.

<text>Private property is a legal designation for the ownership of property by non-governmental legal entities. Private property is distinguishable from public property, which is owned by a state entity, and from collective or cooperative property, which is owned by one or more non-governmental entities. John Locke described private property as a natural law principle arguing in his labor theory of property that when a person mixes their labor with nature, the labor enters the object conferring individual private ownership. Private property is foundational to capitalism, an economic system based on the private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit. As a legal concept, private property is defined and enforced by a country&#x27;s political system.

== History ==

The first evidence of private property may date back to the Babylonians in 1800 BC, as evidenced by the archeological discovery of Plimpton 322, a clay tablet used for calculating property boundaries; however, written discussions of private property were not seen until the Persian Empire, and emerged in the Western tradition at least as far back as Plato.

Before the 18th century, English speakers generally used &quot;property&quot; to refer to land ownership. In England, &quot;property&quot; came to have a legal definition in the 17th century. Private property defined as property owned by commercial entities emerged with the great European trading companies of the 17th century. The issue of the enclosure of agricultural land in England, especially as debated in the 17th and 18th centuries, accompanied efforts in philosophy and political thought—by Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679), James Harrington (1611–1677), and John Locke (1632–1704), for example—to address the phenomenon of property ownership.

In arguing against supporters of absolute monarchy, Locke conceptualized property as a natural right that God had not bestowed exclusively on the monarchy. In his labor theory of property, Locke stated that property is a natural result of labor improving upon nature, and thus by labor expenditure the laborer becomes entitled to its produce. Influenced by the rise of mercantilism, Locke argued that private property was antecedent to and thus independent of government. Locke distinguished between &quot;common property&quot;, by which he meant common land, and property in consumer goods and producer-goods. His chief argument for property in land ownership was that it led to improved land management and cultivation over common land.

In the 18th century, during the Industrial Revolution, the moral philosopher and economist Adam Smith (1723–1790), in contrast to Locke, distinguished between the &quot;right to property&quot; as an acquired right, and natural rights. Smith confined natural rights to &quot;liberty and life&quot;. Smith also drew attention to the relationship between employee and employer and identified that property and civil government were dependent upon each other, recognizing that &quot;the state of property must always vary with the form of government&quot;. Smith further argued that civil government could not exist without property, as the government&#x27;s main function was to define and safeguard property ownership.

In the 19th century, the economist and philosopher Karl Marx (1818–1883) provided an influential analysis of the development and history of property formations and their relationship to the technical productive forces of a given period. Marx&#x27;s conception of private property has proven influential for many subsequent economic theories and for communist, socialist, and anarchist political movements, and led to the widespread association of private property—particularly private property in the means of production—with capitalism.

== Legal and real-world aspects ==

Private property is a legal concept defined and enforced by a country&#x27;s political system. The area of law that deals with the subject is called property law. The enforcement of property law concerning &quot;private&quot; property is a matter of &quot;public&quot; expense. Defence of property is a common method of justification used by defendants who argue that they should not be held liable for any loss and injury that they have caused because they were acting to protect their property. Courts have generally ruled that the use of force may be acceptable.

In many political systems, the government requests that owners pay for the privilege of ownership. A property tax is an ad valorem tax on the value of a property, usually levied on real estate. The tax is levied by the governing authority of the jurisdiction in which the property is located. It may be imposed annually or at the time of a real estate transaction, such as in real estate transfer tax. Under a property-tax system, the government requires or performs an appraisal of the monetary value of each property, and tax is assessed in proportion to that value. The four broad types of property taxes are land, improvements to land (immovable human-made objects, such as buildings), personal property (movable human-made objects), and intangible property.

The social and political context in which private property is administered will determine the extent to which an owner will be able to exercise rights over the same. The rights to private property often come with limitations. For example, local government may enforce rules about what kind of building may be built on private land (building code), or whether a historical building may be demolished or not. Theft is common in many societies, and the extent to which central administration will pursue property crime varies enormously.

Some forms of private property are uniquely identifiable and may be described in a title or a certificate of ownership. The rights to a property may be transferred from one &quot;owner&quot; to another. A transfer tax is a tax on the passing of title to property from one person (or entity) to another. An owner may request that, after death, private property be transferred to family members, through inheritance. In certain cases, ownership may be lost to the public interest. Private real estate may be confiscated or used for public purposes, for example to build a road.

== Theory ==

The legal framework of a country or society defines some of the practical implications of private property. There are no expectations that these rules will define a rational and consistent model of economics or social system. Although contemporary neoclassical economics—currently the dominant school of economics—rejects some of the assumptions of the early philosophers underpinning classical economics, it has been argued that neoclassical economics continues to be influenced by the legacy of natural moral theory and the concept of natural rights, which has led to the presentation of private market exchange and private property rights as &quot;natural rights&quot; inherent in nature.

Economic liberals (defined as those who support a private sector-driven market economy) consider private property to be essential for the construction of a prosperous society. They believe private ownership of land ensures the land will be put to productive use and its value protected by the landowner. If the owners must pay property taxes, this forces the owners to maintain a productive output from the land to keep taxes current. Private property also attaches a monetary value to land, which can be used to trade or as collateral. Private property thus is an important part of capitalization within the economy.

Socialist economists are critical of private property as socialism aims to substitute private property in the means of production for social ownership or public property. Socialists generally argue that private property relations limit the potential of the productive forces in the economy when the productive activity becomes a collective activity, where the role of the capitalist becomes redundant (as a passive owner). Socialists generally favor social ownership either to eliminate the class distinctions between owners and workers and as a component of the development of a post-capitalist economic system.

In response to the socialist critique, the Austrian School economist Ludwig Von Mises argued that private property rights are a requisite for what he called rational economic calculation and that the prices of goods and services cannot be determined accurately enough to make efficient economic calculation without having clearly defined private-property rights. Mises argued that a socialist system, which by definition would lack private property in the factors of production, would be unable to determine appropriate price valuations for the factors of production. According to Mises, this problem would make rational socialist calculation impossible.

In capitalism, ownership can be viewed as a &quot;bundle of rights&quot; over an asset that entitles its holder to a strong form of authority over it. Such a bundle is composed of a set of rights that allows the owner of the asset to control it and decide on its use, claim the value generated by it, exclude others from using it, and the right to transfer the ownership (set of rights over the asset) of it to another holder. In Marxian economics and socialist politics, a distinction is made between &quot;private property&quot; and &quot;personal property&quot;. The former is defined as the means of production about private ownership over an economic enterprise based on socialized production and wage labor whereas the latter is defined as consumer goods or goods produced by an individual. Prior to the 18th century, private property usually referred to land ownership.

== Criticism ==
Private property in the means of production is the central element of capitalism criticized by socialists. In Marxist literature, private property refers to a social relationship in which the property owner takes possession of anything that another person or group produces with that property and capitalism depends on private property. The socialist critique of private ownership is heavily influenced by the Marxist analysis of capitalist property forms as part of its broader critique of alienation and exploitation in capitalism. Although there is considerable disagreement among socialists about the validity of certain aspects of Marxist analysis, the majority of socialists are sympathetic to Marx&#x27;s views on exploitation and alienation.

Socialists critique the private appropriation of property income because such income does not correspond to a return on any productive activity and is generated by the working class, it represents exploitation. The bourgeoisie, the property-owning (capitalist) class, lives off passive property income produced by the proletariat (working population) by their claim to ownership in the form of stock or private equity. This exploitative arrangement is perpetuated due to the structure of capitalist society. Capitalism is regarded as a class system akin to historical class systems like slavery and feudalism.

Private ownership has been criticized on non-Marxist ethical grounds by advocates of market socialism. According to the economist James Yunker, the ethical case for market socialism is that because passive property income requires no mental or physical exertion on the part of the recipient, and its appropriation by a small group of private owners is the source of the vast inequalities in contemporary capitalism, social ownership in a market economy would resolve the major cause of social inequality and its accompanying social ills. Weyl and Posner argue that private property is another name for monopoly and can hamper allocative efficiency. Through the use of taxation and modified Vickrey auctions, they argue that partial common property ownership is a more efficient and just way to organize the economy.

The justifications for private property rights have also been critiqued as tools of empire that enable land appropriation. According to academic commentator Brenna Bhandar, the language implemented in property legislation dictates colonized peoples as unable to effectively own and utilize their land. It is suggested that personal rights are interchangeable with property rights, therefore communities that utilize communal methods of land ownership are not equally validated by private property ideals. It is also argued by critical race theorist Cheryl Harris that race and property rights have been conflated over time, with only those qualities unique to white settlement recognized legally. Indigenous use of land, focusing on common ownership, is distinguished from private property ownership and Western understandings of land law.

<text>The Pillar of Eliseg – also known as Elise&#x27;s Pillar or Croes Elisedd in Welsh – stands near Valle Crucis Abbey, Denbighshire, Wales [Grid reference ]. It was erected by Cyngen ap Cadell (died 855), king of Powys in honour of his great-grandfather Elisedd ap Gwylog. The form &quot;Eliseg&quot; found on the pillar is assumed to be a mistake by the carver of the inscription.

==History==

Whilst the pillar itself dates to the 9th century, the large artificial mound is thought to be significantly older, probably from the Early Bronze Age.

==Inscription==
The Latin inscription consisted of some thirty-one lines of insular script. It not only mentioned several individuals described in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, but also complemented the information presented in that text. Considerable portions of the original inscription were read by the antiquarian Edward Lluyd in 1696 and his transcript seems to have been remarkably accurate according to Robert Vermaat of &quot;Vortigern Studies&quot;.

A generally accepted translation of this inscription, one of the longest surviving inscriptions from pre-Viking Wales, is as follows:

The pillar was thrown down by the Roundheads during the English Civil War and a grave under it opened. Edward Lhuyd examined the pillar and copied the inscription in 1696. The lower half disappeared but the upper half was re-erected in 1779. The original inscription is now illegible.

==Archaeological examination==
Trevor Lloyd, the landowner in 1773, is said to have conducted an examination and found a stone cist burial in which he claimed to have found a skeleton and artefacts, which he removed.

The mound that supports the pillar was subjected to excavation in the years 2010, 2011 and 2012 by Project Eliseg. This established that the earliest phase of construction was that of a kerbed platform cairn, dated by type to around 2000 BC. A small cist in the first phase of construction yielded evidence of burnt human bone, confirming its use as a burial site. The second phase of construction consisted of a raising in height of the cairn and contained a large cist considered as Early Bronze Age; however, no human remains were found. A further cist was found in this phase which contained 7 kg of cremated bone, representing numerous adult, juvenile and infant burials. A flint knife and a bone pin were also recovered. The final phase of construction appeared to be relatively modern and probably subsequent to the re-erection of the cross.

<doc id="147769" wikidata="Q1626955" url="?curid=147769" title="Chuck Dukowski">
<text>Gary Arthur McDaniel (born February 1, 1954), better known by his stage name Chuck Dukowski, is an American punk rock musician. He is most well-known for being the bass player and an occasional songwriter for Black Flag.

==Career==

===Early years===
Dukowski was born on February 1, 1954, and raised in a self-described middle-class family in San Pedro, Los Angeles, California, where his father worked for the industrial company TRW. Dukowski&#x27;s mother was German, and her family lineage had many musicians and composers.

Dukowski attended San Pedro High School and later Chadwick School, where he played football. After graduation, he went to college to study psychobiology.

===Würm===
Dukowski&#x27;s first band was Würm, which started in 1973. By 1977, the band had moved to Hermosa Beach and lived in a communal house called &quot;the Würmhole&quot; but Würm broke up later that year.

===Black Flag===
Keith Morris and Greg Ginn were regulars at Würmhole parties. in 1977, Dukowski joined their Morris and Ginn&#x27;s band, Panic, before they played their first show. Panic changed their name to Black Flag after discovering another band using the name &quot;Panic&quot;. Dukowski left the band in 1983 before the recording of &quot;My War&quot;, and afterward served as Black Flag&#x27;s manager. He was responsible for booking nationwide and worldwide tours until 1986. Dukowski wrote or co-wrote some of Black Flag&#x27;s most popular songs, including &quot;My War,&quot; &quot;The Bars,&quot; &quot;I Love You,&quot; and &quot;Modern Man&quot;. Dukowski started SST Records with Ginn in 1978 and was a co-owner until 1989. During Black Flag&#x27;s appearance in &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot;, he is credited as Gary McDaniel.

===Later projects===
After Black Flag, Dukowski reformed Würm, which continued until guitarist Ed Danky died. Other bands Dukowski formed include SST &quot;supergroup&quot; October Faction, and SWA, formed in 1985 with Merrill Ward of Overkill.

Dukowski has a new band with his wife, artist and musician Lora Norton, and son Milo called The Chuck Dukowski Sextet. They released their debut album, &quot;Eat My Life&quot;, on Dukowski&#x27;s own Nice &amp; Friendly Records in 2006. In 2013 Chuck launched Flag with former Black Flag members Keith Morris, Bill Stevenson, Dez Cadena, and Descendents/All guitarist Stephen Egerton to perform the music of Black Flag.

He appeared in the documentaries &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot;, &quot;Open Your Mouth And Say... Mr. Chi Pig&quot;, &quot;We Jam Econo&quot;, &quot;Urban Struggle: The Battle of the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest,&quot; and &quot;We Were Feared (Clockwork Orange County)&quot;.

=== FLAG ===
In 2013, Keith Morris, Chuck Dukowski, Dez Cadena, Bill Stevenson, and Descendents member Stephen Egerton created FLAG as an offshoot of Black Flag. , they are only touring. No plans for an album have been announced.
==Stage name==
&quot;Chuck Dukowski&quot; is a stage name, originating from a Zippo lighter with &quot;Chuck the Duke&quot; inscribed on it that he found while searching for change. Feeling that the name &quot;Chuck the Duke&quot; sounded macho, he wanted to add a Polish sounding last name, as Poles were frequently picked on. He turned &quot;Chuck the Duke&quot; into &quot;Chuck Dukowski&quot;. Dukowski was credited under his real name on original pressings of Black Flag&#x27;s &quot;Nervous Breakdown&quot; EP, as well as in the documentary film &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot; and its companion soundtrack album. He is credited as &quot;Charles Dukowski&quot; on Black Flag&#x27;s &quot;Damaged&quot; LP.

<doc id="147771" wikidata="Q436831" url="?curid=147771" title="Kira Roessler">
<text>Kira Roessler (born June 12, 1961) is an American musician who was the bass guitarist for the influential hardcore punk band Black Flag from 1983 to 1985. Since the mid-1980s, she has been a member of the rock duo Dos with her now ex-husband Mike Watt.

Roessler also works as a dialogue editor. She was on the sound editing team for &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot;, which won a 2015 Oscar. She was also on the teams that won Emmy Awards for the &quot;John Adams&quot; episode &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread on Me&quot; and on the series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.

== Early life ==
Born in New Haven, Connecticut, Roessler lived there until age eight when her family moved to the Caribbean until she was eleven and thereafter in California, mostly in Los Angeles. Her brother is Paul Roessler, a keyboardist known for involvement in several Los Angeles–area bands including the Screamers.

== Career ==

===Music===
Roessler began studying piano when she was six but quit at age eleven. At fourteen she picked up the bass guitar and committed to learning the instrument. Her first band was called Waxx and she played her first gig at age sixteen at Whisky a Go Go. Other early bands were Sexsick, the Visitors, and the Monsters. She then joined with a post-Germs Pat Smear to form Twisted Roots.

Members of Black Flag heard her playing while she was sitting in with L.A. punk group DC3. This led to her being asked to join Black Flag in 1983 to replace founding member Chuck Dukowski. Vocalist Henry Rollins later reported that Greg Ginn, Black Flag&#x27;s leader, guitarist and primary songwriter, had grown frustrated with Dukowski&#x27;s failure to progress as a musician beyond the band&#x27;s hardcore punk roots and was drawn to Roessler&#x27;s more nimble and sophisticated playing. Roessler was majoring in applied engineering at UCLA, and Black Flag&#x27;s subsequent tours were scheduled around her classes—a condition of her joining the band. Her bass playing was featured on five of Black Flag&#x27;s studio albums and two officially released live albums. During her early live performances with the band she was sometimes mistaken as male due to her androgynous appearance, and she subsequently dressed in more feminine garb. She remained in the band until completing touring behind their album &quot;In My Head&quot; in the autumn of 1985. She graduated from UCLA in 1986.

After Black Flag, she formed the twin-bass duo Dos with Mike Watt (to whom she was married between 1987 and 1994). Dos&#x27; most recent album was released in 2011. She wrote or co-wrote songs for what would be the Minutemen&#x27;s final album, &quot;3-Way Tie&quot;, and contributed lyrics to Watt&#x27;s post-Minutemen band Firehose. She later contributed artwork to Watt&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Ball-Hog or Tugboat?&quot;.

She appeared as a backing vocalist on the tribute album &quot;Rise Above: 24 Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West Memphis Three&quot; in 2003 along with other musical artists, including other Black Flag veterans.

In December 2018, Roessler joined with Devra Hoff to form the twin-bass band AwkWard and released their first album &quot;In Progress&quot;.

On August 13, 2021, on the Protonic Reversal podcast, Kira revealed that an album of solo material would be released on October 19 on Kitten Robot records.

===Film work===
Roessler works as a dialogue editor on theatrical films in Los Angeles, sometimes credited under her full name, sometimes simply as &quot;kira&quot;. She has worked on productions including &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; (2002), &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot; (2003), and &quot;The Twilight Saga: New Moon&quot; (2009), and has also appeared onscreen in the documentaries &quot;We Jam Econo: The Story of the Minutemen&quot;, &quot;American Hardcore&quot; and &quot;What Drives Us&quot; . She won Emmy Awards for her work on the &quot;John Adams&quot; episode &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread on Me&quot; and on the series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.

Roessler was on the sound editing team for &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot;, which won an Oscar in 2016.

<text> (; &quot;Residence of the President&quot;), formerly the Viceregal Lodge, is the official residence and principal workplace of the President of Ireland. 

It is located off Chesterfield Avenue in the Phoenix Park in Dublin, with the building&#x27;s design being credited to amateur architect Nathaniel Clements but more likely guided by professionals (John Wood of Bath, Sir Edward Lovett Pearce and Richard Cassels) and completed around 1751 to 1757.

==History==
===Origins===
The original house was designed by park ranger and amateur architect Nathaniel Clements in the mid-18th century. It was bought by the Crown in the 1780s to become the summer residence of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the British viceroy in the Kingdom of Ireland. His official residence was in the Viceregal Apartments in Dublin Castle. The house in the park later became the &quot;Viceregal Lodge&quot;, the &quot;out of season&quot; residence of the Lord Lieutenant (also known as the Viceroy), where he lived for most of the year from the 1820s onwards. During the Social Season (January to Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day in March), he lived in state in Dublin Castle.

Phoenix Park once contained three official state residences. The Viceregal Lodge, the Chief Secretary&#x27;s Lodge and the Under Secretary&#x27;s Lodge. The Chief Secretary&#x27;s Lodge, now called Deerfield, is the official residence of the United States Ambassador to Ireland. The Under Secretary&#x27;s Lodge, now demolished, served for many years as the Apostolic Nunciature, the Medieval core of the building surviving as Ashtown Castle.

Some historians have claimed that the garden front portico of Áras an Uachtaráin (which can be seen by the public from the main road through the Phoenix Park) was used as a model by Irish architect James Hoban, who designed the White House in Washington, D.C. However, the porticoes were not part of Hoban&#x27;s original design and were, in fact, added to the White House at a later date by Benjamin Henry Latrobe.

===Phoenix Park Murders===
In 1882, its grounds were the location of the Phoenix Park Murders. The Chief Secretary for Ireland (the British Cabinet minister with responsibility for Irish affairs), Lord Frederick Cavendish, and his Under-Secretary, Thomas Henry Burke, were stabbed to death with surgical knives while walking back to the residence from Dublin Castle. A small insurgent group called the Irish National Invincibles was responsible. John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer, the then Lord Lieutenant, heard the victims&#x27; screams from a window in the ground floor drawing room.

==Government usage==
===Residence of the Governor-General===
In 1911, the house underwent a large extension for the visit of King George V and Queen Mary. With the creation of the Irish Free State in December 1922, the office of Lord Lieutenant was abolished. The new state intended to place the new representative of the Crown, Governor-General Tim Healy, in a new, smaller residence, but because of death threats from the anti-treaty IRA, he was installed in the Viceregal Lodge temporarily. The building was at the time nicknamed &quot;Uncle Tim&#x27;s Cabin&quot; after him, in imitation of the famous US novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; by the US author Harriet Beecher Stowe. It remained the official residence of the Governor-General of the Irish Free State until 1932, when the new Governor-General, Domhnall Ua Buachalla, was installed in a specially hired private mansion in the southside of Dublin.

===Residence of the President===

The house was left empty until 1938, when the first President of Ireland, Douglas Hyde, lived there temporarily while plans were made to build a new presidential palace on the grounds. The outbreak of the Second World War saved the building, which had been renamed &quot;Áras an Uachtaráin&quot; (meaning house or residence of the president in Irish), from demolition, as plans for its demolition and the design of a new residence were put on hold. By 1945 it had become too closely identified with the presidency of Ireland to be demolished, though its poor condition meant that extensive demolition and rebuilding of parts of the building were necessary, notably the kitchens, servants&#x27; quarters and chapel. Since then, further restoration work has been carried out from time to time.

President Hyde lived in the residential quarters on the first floor of the main building. Later presidents moved to the new residential wing attached to the main house that had been built on for the visit of King George V in 1911. However, in 1990 Mary Robinson moved back to the older main building. Her successor, Mary McAleese, lived in the 1911 wing.

Compared to other European royal and presidential palaces, Áras an Uachtaráin has only a handful of staterooms: the state drawing room, large and small dining rooms, the President&#x27;s Office and Library, a large ballroom and a presidential corridor lined with the busts of past presidents (Francini Corridor), and some fine eighteenth and nineteenth century bedrooms above, all in the main building.

All taoisigh as well as government ministers receive their seal of office from the president at Áras an Uachtaráin as do judges, the attorney general, the comptroller and auditor general, and senior commissioned officers of the Defence Forces. It is also the venue for the meetings of the Presidential Commission and the Council of State.

Áras an Uachtaráin also houses the headquarters of the Garda Mounted Unit.

The Office of Public Works completely furnishes the private quarters of Áras an Uachtaráin for the presidential family.

==Visitors==
Various visiting British monarchs stayed at the Viceregal Lodge while Ireland was part of the United Kingdom, notably Queen Victoria and King George V. American presidents hosted there include John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has also visited. Other famous visitors to Áras an Uachtaráin have been Nelson Mandela, Aung Sang Suu Kyi, Prince Rainier III and Princess Grace of Monaco; King Baudouin of Belgium; King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofía of Spain; Pope John Paul II; Prince Charles and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; Indian prime-ministers Jawaharlal Nehru and Narendra Modi; and Pope Francis.

On 17 May 2011, Queen Elizabeth II became the first British monarch to visit the residence in 100 years, on the occasion of her state visit to Ireland. She was welcomed by President Mary McAleese, inspected a guard of honour, signed the visitors book and planted an Irish oak sapling.

Guests do not normally stay at Áras an Uachtaráin. Although it has 92 rooms, many of these are used for storage of presidential files, for household staff and official staff, including military aides-de-camp, a secretary to the president, and a press office. Foreign dignitaries usually stay at Farmleigh, the State guest house, located close to Áras an Uachtaráin in Castleknock.

On 1 May 2004, during Ireland&#x27;s six-month presidency of the European Union, Áras an Uachtaráin was the Venue for the &quot;European Day of Welcomes&quot; (Accession Day) in which ten new members joined the EU. All 25 heads of government attended the flag-raising ceremony in the gardens of the building. A large security operation involving the Garda Síochána and the Irish Defence Forces closed off Áras an Uachtaráin and the Phoenix Park.

Like most OPW buildings, Áras an Uachtaráin is open for free guided tours every Saturday.

<text>Julio Roberto Valverde Valencia (born 1955), better known by his stage name Robo, is a Colombian-American drummer. He came to prominence in the early 1980s with punk band Black Flag, and more recently has been a member of Misfits.

==Life and career==
Robo (at the time known by his birth name, Roberto Valverde), born in Cali, who came to the United States on a student visa in early 1975. He stayed after the visa expired.

Robo began playing drums in 1976, while living in El Segundo, California and working in a plastics factory. In 1978, he joined Black Flag as the band&#x27;s second drummer, replacing Brian Migdol. He toured and recorded with them through 1981, performing on the EPs &quot;Jealous Again&quot; and &quot;Six Pack&quot;, and their first full-length album, &quot;Damaged&quot;. He was forced out of the band after being detained at Heathrow Airport over visa complications just prior to Black Flag&#x27;s return from their 1982 UK tour; in order to fulfill existing commitments back in the US, the band replaced Robo before he was able to return to the country. When he did eventually return later that year, he learned that the Misfits were seeking a drummer. He relocated to New Jersey to join that band full-time, touring and recording the &quot;Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood&quot; album before quitting in the summer of 1983, a few months before The Misfits&#x27; final dissolution. Robo would eventually, along with Jerry and Doyle Caiafa and Frank LiCata (aka Franché Coma), be a party to the 1992 lawsuit against Glenn Danzig which led to the settlement of unpaid back royalties to Danzig&#x27;s former Misfits bandmates, as well as provisions for the apportionment of future royalties and merchandising/licensing rights. This settlement was also significant in establishing the exclusive right of the plaintiffs, rather than Danzig, to perform and record as The Misfits moving forward, giving rise to the Caiafas&#x27; revamped version of the band from 1995 on.

In 2003, Robo drummed for Black Flag during their reunion shows. He was joined by Dez Cadena on vocals and rhythm guitar, Greg Ginn on lead guitar, and C&#x27;el Revuelta on bass. In 2005, he rejoined the Misfits, then featuring Jerry Only on bass and vocals and fellow former Black Flag member Cadena on guitar. When touring, the band played Misfits songs as well as Black Flag songs, with Cadena singing the Black Flag songs. Robo appeared on the &quot;Land of the Dead&quot; single.

He was briefly mentioned in the Jim Jarmusch short film &quot;Coffee and Cigarettes: Somewhere in California&quot; by Iggy Pop, who suggested using Robo&#x27;s drumming talents to an offended Tom Waits.

Robo has been married once, to Barbara Mazzone Valverde, and they have one son, Vincent Valverde (formerly of the band TALP), who was born on December 6, 1985. Robo and Barbara subsequently divorced.

In 2010, Robo dropped out of the Misfits due to passport troubles.

On January 25, 2013, it was announced that Robo would be participating in Black Flag&#x27;s upcoming reunion show at Hevy Music Festival in Folkestone, their first UK show in 30 years, in August. A few days later, it was announced that Gregory Moore would be the drummer for Black Flag, not Robo.

==Playing style==
Robo&#x27;s drum style relies heavily on open high-hat to generate the frenetic sounds on early Black Flag records. His signature drum kit during that era was transparent to match Greg Ginn&#x27;s see-through Dan Armstrong guitar, and was unique in that all of the drums and cymbals were parallel to the ground rather than tilted towards him in the typical style. He was also known for wearing plastic and metal bracelets during concerts and recording sessions; they can sometimes be heard faintly clattering on recordings. While many drummers utilize a style which uses quick movements originating from the wrist, Robo&#x27;s style consists of stiff, robotic movements of the entire arm. His stage name was given to him by his Black Flag bandmates, and is both a play on his name (Roberto) and a reference to his drumming style.

<doc id="147777" wikidata="Q1540073" url="?curid=147777" title="Sports in Japan">
<text>Sports in Japan are a significant part of Japanese culture. Traditional sports, such as sumo and martial arts, as well as Western imports like baseball, association football, basketball and tennis are popular with both participants and spectators.

Sumo is considered Japan&#x27;s national sport. Baseball was introduced to the country by visiting Americans in the 19th century. The Nippon Professional Baseball league has been Japan&#x27;s largest professional sports competition in terms of television ratings and spectators. Martial arts such as judo, karate and modern kendō are also widely practiced and enjoyed by spectators in the country. Association football has gained wide popularity since the founding of the Japan Professional Football League in 1992. Other popular sports include figure skating, rugby union, golf, table tennis and racing, especially auto racing. Some new sports were invented by changing elements of imported sports.

==History==

===Pre-Edo period===
Sumo shows an important side of traditional Japanese sport, a religious occasion as well as a sporting event. Many sumo rituals are closely associated with Shinto belief. It is believed that some ancient sumo matches were purely religious events with predetermined outcomes as an offering to kami, with some matches regarded as divination – e.g. if a well-liked fisherman competed and won, a good catch was predicted for the year.

The Kamakura period was a starting point for many martial arts. Kyūdō became popular as , literally &quot;bow skill&quot;, as a pastime for the samurai class. Yabusame also started as a sport in this period, but is now considered a sacred ceremony.

===Edo period===
In the Edo period, sports became a popular way to spend time. The only problem was that they were often accompanied by gambling. A notice to punish playing and betting on sumo without authorization was repeatedly posted to little effect. Kyūdō was encouraged by &quot;shōguns&quot; and &quot;daimyōs&quot; as a pastime, and contests as well as record making attempts were held. On April 26, 1686, a samurai named &quot;Wasa Daihachiro&quot; competing in the Tōshiya made an unsurpassed record of shooting 13,053 arrows and hitting the mark 8,133 times over a 24-hour period. This is even more remarkable when one considers the shooting range for this attempt, a 120-meter-long corridor with a ceiling of only 2.2 meters. In the Olympic Games, archers shoot over a distance of only 70 meters. Martial arts like jujutsu were popular but schools avoided inter-school matches, leaving room only for intramural matches.

===After Meiji Restoration===
After the Meiji Restoration, various kinds of Western sports were introduced into Japan. Playing sports was adopted as a school activity and matches between universities became popular. During the 1870s, track and field events, baseball, football, rugby union, cricket and ice skating were introduced. In 1911, an Austrian gave skiing instruction to the Japanese army. In those days, Western sports were played by a few people, but through the educational system, they spread throughout the country. Western sports were initially stressed as a form of mental discipline, but Japanese have now come to enjoy them as recreational activities. Professional sports, the most famous being baseball which continues even today, started in the late 1920s but persistent rumors of bribes and a general attitude that sports should be for players or as a hobby persisted. Matches between schools attracted large crowd until after World War II when airing sporting events on radio and television became common. Manga with sports-themed stories (colloquially called &quot;&quot;) have also played a part in attracting readers to slightly less popular sports, such as volleyball, association football, basketball, or American football, although there are also stories focusing on more popular sports like baseball.

Other sports like table tennis and fencing have been popular at different times. Baseball was a staple of early television, and boxing and sumo were aired periodically. Initially, running live sports games was viewed with skepticism as it was believed that fans would rather stay at home if they could watch for free. But, as it actually increased interest and sold more merchandise, airing of sports on television became popular.

Judo has been recognized as an official event in the Olympic Games since the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. It is also one of the four main forms of amateur competitive wrestling practiced internationally today. Keirin racing has also become an Olympic Games event since the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney.

Motorsports have become quite popular in Japan, especially during the latter third of the 20th century. Japanese car manufacturers use a relatively new form of motorsport that is distinctly Japanese and is now being exported abroad.

Japan hosted the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, which were postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Professional organizations==
The most popular professional sports in Japan are baseball, association football (soccer), sumo wrestling, basketball, and golf. Note that most practitioners in the martial arts are not professional, but amateurs.

Notes: 
* Japan has no professional Gridiron Football teams. The above means watching the US National Football League and Canadian Canadian Football League games on TV.

In addition, there are professional sports for gambling purposes; some fans enjoy them as spectator sports without betting money.
* Horse racing – 25 races have international Grade I ratings. Arima Kinen is the world&#x27;s biggest betting race.
* Keirin – bicycle racing. Became an Olympic sport in 2000 in its modified form
* Kyotei – powerboat racing
* Auto Race – motorbike racing on oval tracks

== School and sport ==

There are opportunities to play various sports for all ages, and school plays an important role in community. Kindergarten and lower elementary school students can play in a private sport club that can be joined for a moderate fee. Most martial arts can be started as little as 5 to 6 years old. When a student starts 5th grade, school offers free after-school activities for its students to participate. Middle and high schools also encourage their students to join school sport clubs.

Prefectural and national-wide level contests and tournaments are held every winter and summer for all sports. Some of the tournaments, such as National High School Baseball Championship, have a very high level of popularity among fans, comparable to professional sports.

==International competition==
The second Monday of October is a national holiday of Japan, Health and Sports Day. This date, originally October 10, commemorates the opening day of the 1964 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo. The event was documented in &quot;Tokyo Olympiad&quot; by filmmaker, Kon Ichikawa. Japan has hosted many international competitions including the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, 2002 FIFA World Cup, and the 2006 and 2009 World Baseball Classic. Tokyo also hosted the 2020 Summer Olympics.

The 2019 Rugby World Cup, or &#x27;RWC 2019&#x27; was hosted by Japan. This was announced by RWCL Chairman Bernard Lapasset in Irish capital Dublin at a special IRB meeting on 28 July 2009, along with the host of the 2015 Rugby World Cup, England.

Many major figure skating events are regularly held in Japan. The Grand Prix event, the NHK Trophy, has been held in various cities throughout Japan every year since 1979. Japan has also been host of the World Figure Skating Championships and ISU Grand Prix Final numerous times. In 2009, it held the first ISU World Team Trophy in Tokyo, an event set to take place every two years. Figure skating is also a commercial success in Japan, and made-for-television competitions and ice shows like the Japan Open are broadcast across the nation. Along with countries such as the United States, Canada, and Russia, Japan is widely considered to be a leading country in the sport.

==Individual sports==
===Sumo===
Sumo wrestling is the national sport in Japan. Sumo wrestling is believed to have originated in Japan, with its governing body being the Japan Sumo Association. It is considered a &quot;gendai budō&quot;, which refers to modern Japanese martial art, but the sport has a history spanning many centuries. Many ancient traditions have been preserved in sumo, and even today the sport includes many ritual elements, such as the use of salt purification, from Shinto.

Life as a wrestler is highly regimented, with rules regulated by the Japan Sumo Association. Most sumo wrestlers are required to live in communal sumo training stables, known in Japanese as &quot;heya&quot;, where all aspects of their daily lives – from meals to their manner of dress – are dictated by strict tradition.

===Boxing===

The history of boxing in Japan began in 1854 when Matthew Perry landed at Shimoda, Shizuoka soon after the Convention of Kanagawa. At that time, American sailors often engaged in sparring matches on board their ships, with their fists wrapped in thin leather. It was the first example of boxing conveyed to Japan. In addition, an ōzeki-ranked sumo wrestler named was summoned by the shogunate, and ordered to fight a boxer and a wrestler from the United States. There were three fought matches, using different martial arts&#x27; styles, before Perry and other spectators. Koyanagi reportedly won.

In Japan, every professional boxer must contract with a manager under the Japan Boxing Commission (JBC) rules, and is required to belong to a boxing gym which has exclusive management rights for boxers as a member of each regional subsidiary body of Japan Pro Boxing Association under the Japan&#x27;s conventional gym system. Two professional boxers belonging to the same gym have not been allowed to fight against each other unless one of them transfers to other gym, because it might disrupt the gym system. However, it is often quite difficult for boxers to transfer between the gyms due to the matters on transfer fees, match fees and so on.

===Figure skating===
In the 2009–10 season all four reigning World Champion singles skaters were from Japan. Figure skating events in Japan are well attended and TV broadcasts attract a large audience. The major surge in its popularity has come mainly within the past decade with the success of its native skaters, but there have been avid fans in the country for international skaters for much longer. Skater Dorothy Hamill is known to have received pearls from the Japanese royal family in the 1970s. Figure Skaters in Japan also enjoy some level of celebrity – some like Mao Asada and Yuzuru Hanyu (the first Japanese male figure skater to win an Olympic gold medal) becoming household names and gaining large sponsorships. The NHK Trophy, a major figure skating Grand-Prix event, is hosted in Japan every year.

===Skiing===

Skiing is also popular and taught in schools in northern parts of the mountainous country. In particular, Japan has been producing good ski jumpers since the Sapporo Olympics in 1972, when Japanese athletes won all three medals in the 70 Meter Jumps with Yukio Kasaya getting the first gold for Japan in Winter Olympics. In the 1990s, Noriaki Kasai and Kazuyoshi Funaki scored many wins in the FIS Ski Jumping World Cup. More recently, Ryoyu Kobayashi won the overall title in the 2018–19 season. In the women&#x27;s arena, the four-time season champion Sara Takanashi is renewing her world record of most wins in the World Cup.

===Mixed martial arts===
Mixed martial arts (MMA) has been the most popular combat sport in Japan since the 1970s, and the country is considered a world power. The first example of this sport in Japan was the historic fight between Japanese fighter Antonio Inoki and American boxer Muhammad Ali. The classic match between a professional boxer and a professional wrestler turned sour when each refused to engage in the other&#x27;s fighting style, and after a 15-round stalemate the match was declared a draw.

The Japanese promotion PRIDE Fighting Championships was one of the most important organizations in the world, and was called &quot;the Mecca of MMA&quot; because it brought together the best fighters in Japan and the world until its demise in 2007. Today there are promotions such as Rizin Fighting Federation (the most important in the country), Pancrase, Shooto and ZST.

==Popular team sports==
===Baseball===

Baseball is historically the most popular team sport in Japan. It was introduced to Japan in 1872 by Horace Wilson, who taught at the Kaisei School in Tokyo. The first baseball team was called the Shimbashi Athletic Club and was established in 1878. Baseball has been a popular sport ever since. It is called in Japanese, combining the characters for &quot;field&quot; and &quot;ball&quot;.

Hiroshi Hiraoka, who was in the United States studying engineering, introduced the game to his co-workers at Japan&#x27;s national railways in 1878. He and his co-workers created the first baseball team, the Shimbashi Athletic Club, and dominated other teams which popped up in Japan. However, it was not until 1896 that a team from Ichikō, the elite University of Tokyo preparatory school, defeated a team from the Yokohama Country &amp; Athletic Club 29 to 4 that the sport took a dominant hold in Japanese popular culture. The match was the first recorded international baseball game in Asia. After that victory, several other universities in Japan adopted the sport, and it quickly spread throughout Japan. Since then, teams from Japan have traveled to learn from their American counterparts. Waseda University was one of the first teams to cross the ocean to improve their skills. In 1905, the team traveled to the United States, where it played college teams from around the country. Other universities in Japan made similar trips, and U.S. teams traveled to Japan to play.

From 1913 to 1922, American MLB stars visited Japan and played against university teams. They also held clinics on technique. Herb Hunter, a retired major league player, made eight trips to Japan, from 1922 to 1932 to organize games and coaching clinics.

Baseball is also played in Japan&#x27;s junior and senior high schools. Each year in March and August, two tournaments are held at Koshien Stadium for senior high school teams that win a prefecture tournament. References to high school baseball () generally refer to the two annual baseball tournaments, played by high schools nationwide culminating at a final showdown at Hanshin Kōshien Stadium in Nishinomiya, Japan. They are organized by the Japan High School Baseball Federation in association with Mainichi Shimbun for the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament in the spring (also known as &quot;Spring Kōshien&quot;), and Asahi Shimbun for the National High School Baseball Championship in the summer (also known as &quot;Summer Kōshien&quot;). These nationwide tournaments enjoy widespread popularity, arguably equal to or greater than professional baseball. Qualifying tournaments are often televised locally and each game of the final stage at Kōshien is televised nationally on NHK. The tournaments have become a national tradition, and large numbers of frenzied students and parents travel from hometowns to cheer for their local team. It is a common sight to see players walking off the field in tears after being eliminated from the tournament by a loss.

===Association football===

Association football is the second most popular team sport in Japan, behind Baseball. The Japan Football Association (JFA) is the governing body of Japanese football. The JFA organizes the men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, and futsal national teams.

Association football was introduced to Japan during the Meiji period by O-yatoi gaikokujin, foreign advisors hired by the Japanese government, along with many other foreign sports, like baseball. The first Japanese football club is considered to be Tokyo Shūkyū-dan, founded in 1917, which is now competing in the Tokyo Prefectural amateur league.

In the 1920s, football associations were organized and regional tournaments began in universities and high schools, especially in Tokyo. In the 1930s, the Japan national football team was organized and drew 3–3 with China to win their first title at the Far Eastern Championship Games. The Japan national team also competed in the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, the team had a first victory in an Olympic game with a 3–2 win over powerful Sweden.

The Japan national team is very successful at an international level, and has competed in the 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, 2018, and 2022FIFA World Cups. Its best result was reaching the Round of 16 in 2002, 2010, 2018, and 2022. The Japanese national team has also competed in six AFC Asian Cups, with the team being the Champions in 1992, 2000, 2004 and 2011 AFC Asian Cups. The team&#x27;s highest ranking was 9th in the world in February 1998. Japan has competed in many other footballing events including the Confederations Cup, the East Asian Football Championship, and the Copa América.

The J.League is the most popular football league in Japan and has grown rapidly in just a few decades-with teams such as FC Tokyo and Kashima Antlers regularly competing in continental competition and the league drawing the talents of Andrés Iniesta and Fernando Torres.

The women&#x27;s national team has enjoyed major success at the World Cup, winning the 2011 edition in Germany and finishing as runner-up in the 2015 edition in Canada.

The national team&#x27;s colors are blue and white, Japan&#x27;s main colors in most international sporting competitions.

===Basketball===
Especially since the emergence of Yuta Tabuse and Takuya Kawamura, basketball has received a recent revival and become a popular sport in Japan. The Japan national basketball team won the FIBA Asia Championship twice and has qualified for the event 25 out of 26 times. Japan was host to the 2006 FIBA World Championship which was played in the host cities of Hamamatsu, Hiroshima, Saitama, Sapporo and Sendai and on 9 December 2017, Japan was announced as co-host the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup with Philippines and Indonesia some matches will be in host city of Okinawa City.

The prime basketball league in the country is the B.League.

In 2010 the Japan Basketball Association recognized Takehiko Inoue, the creator of &quot;Slam Dunk&quot;, for the series&#x27; role in popularizing the sport in Japan as part of its 80th anniversary celebrations.

In 2019, Rui Hachimura was selected ninth overall in the draft by the Washington Wizards of the NBA. He is a son between a Beninese father and Japanese mother.

In 2016, the Sunwolves joined Super Rugby as that competition&#x27;s first Japanese team and first from the Northern Hemisphere. Super Rugby began in 1996 as Super 12, involving franchised teams from Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, and had involved only those countries until 2016. The competition became Super 14 in 2006 when it added two teams, and adopted its current name of Super Rugby when it expanded to 15 teams in 2011. The 2016 season saw the addition of three new teams, including the first-ever entry from Argentina. The Sunwolves play home matches mostly at Chichibunomiya Rugby Stadium in Tokyo, with select &quot;home&quot; matches also played in Singapore.

The first recorded instance of rugby being played in Japan was in 1874, when British sailors staged a game in Yokohama. The sport was introduced to students at Keio university in 1899, by Professor Edward Bramwell Clarke and Tanaka Ginnosuke.

<doc id="147778" wikidata="Q257533" url="?curid=147778" title="Music of Japan">
<text>In Japan, music includes a wide array of distinct genres, both traditional and modern. The word for &quot;music&quot; in Japanese is 音楽 (&quot;ongaku&quot;), combining the kanji 音 &quot;on&quot; (sound) with the kanji 楽 &quot;gaku&quot; (music, comfort). Japan is the world&#x27;s largest market for music on physical media and the second-largest overall music market, with a retail value of US$2.7 billion in 2017.

==Traditional and folk music==
===Gagaku, hougaku===

The oldest forms of traditional Japanese music are:

* , or Buddhist chanting
* , or orchestral court music

both of which date to the Nara (710–794) and Heian (794–1185) periods. Gagaku classical music has been performed at the Imperial court since the Heian period. Kagura-uta (神楽歌), Azuma-asobi (東遊) and Yamato-uta (大和歌) are indigenous repertories. Tōgaku (唐楽) allegedly resembles a Chinese Tang dynasty (618–907) style; komagaku may have come from the Korean Peninsula.
In addition, gagaku subdivides into kangen (管弦) (instrumental music) and bugaku (舞楽) (dance accompanied by gagaku).
Samurai listened to and performed these music activities, in their practices of enriching their lives and understanding.

===Biwa hōshi, Heike biwa and goze===

The biwa (琵琶 - Chinese: pipa), a form of short-necked lute, was played by a group of itinerant performers (biwa hōshi). The root of Biwa music was The Tale of the Heike&quot;. Biwa hōshi&quot; organized into a guild-like association. The biwa is Japan&#x27;s traditional instrument.&quot;&quot;
Lafcadio Hearn related in his book &quot;&quot; (1903) &quot;Mimi-nashi Hoichi&quot; (Hoichi the Earless), a Japanese ghost story about a blind biwa hōshi who performs &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot;.

Blind women, known as goze (瞽女), toured beginning in the medieval era, sang and played accompanying music on a lap drum. From the seventeenth century they often played the koto or the shamisen. Goze organizations sprung up in many places, and existed until the 21st century in Niigata Prefecture.

===Wadaiko===
Wadaiko, a Japanese drum, comes in various sizes and is used in variety of musical genres. It has become particularly popular in recent years as the central instrument of percussion ensembles whose repertory is based on a variety of folk- and festival-music of the past. Such taiko music is played by large drum ensembles called &quot;kumi-daiko&quot;. Its origins remain uncertain, but can be traced to the 7th century, when a clay figure of a drummer documented its existence. Chinese influences followed, but the instrument and its music remained uniquely Japanese. Taiko drums during this period were used during battle to intimidate the enemy and to communicate commands. Taiko continue to be used in the religious music of Buddhism and Shintō. In the past players were holy men who played only at special occasions and in small groups, but in time secular men (rarely women) also played the taiko in semi-religious festivals such as the bon dance.

Modern ensemble taiko was invented by Daihachi Oguchi in 1951. A jazz drummer, Oguchi incorporated his musical background into large ensembles of his design. His energetic style made his group popular throughout Japan, and made the Hokuriku region a center for taiko music. Musical groups to arise from this wave of popularity included Oedo Sukeroku Taiko, founded by Seido Kobayashi. 1969 saw a group called Za Ondekoza; Za Ondekoza gathered young performers who innovated a new roots revival taiko, which was used as a way of life in communal lifestyles. During the 1970s the Japanese government allocated funds to preserve Japanese culture, and many community taiko groups formed. Later in the century, taiko groups spread across the world, especially to the United States. The video game &quot;Taiko no Tatsujin&quot; is based around taiko.

===Min&#x27;yō folk music===

Japanese folk songs (&quot;min&#x27;yō&quot;) can be grouped and classified in many ways but it is often convenient to think of five main categories:
* fisherman&#x27;s work song, farmer&#x27;s work song
* lullaby
* religious songs (such as sato kagura, a form of Shintoist music)
* songs used for gatherings such as weddings, funerals, and festivals (matsuri, especially Obon)
* children&#x27;s songs (warabe uta)

In min&#x27;yō, three-stringed lute known as the shamisen, taiko drums, and a bamboo flute called shakuhachi typically accompany the singers. Other instruments that could accompany include a transverse flute known as the shinobue, a bell known as kane, a hand drum called the tsuzumi, and/or a 13-stringed zither known as the koto. In Okinawa the main instrument is the sanshin. These are traditional Japanese instruments, but modern instrumentation, such as electric guitars and synthesizers, is also used in this day and age, when enka singers cover traditional min&#x27;yō songs (enka being a Japanese music genre all its own).

An ondo generally describes any folk song with a distinctive swing that may be heard as 2/4 time rhythm (though performers usually do not group beats). The typical folk song heard at Obon festival dances is typically an ondo. A bushi (&quot;melody&quot; or &quot;rhythm&quot;) is a song with a distinctive melody. The word is rarely used on its own, but is usually prefixed by a term referring to occupation, location, personal name or the like. Bon uta are songs for Obon, the lantern festival of the dead. Komori uta are lullabies. The names of min&#x27;yo songs often include a descriptive term, usually at the end. For example: Tokyo Ondo, Kushimoto Bushi, Hokkai Bon Uta, and Itsuki no Komoriuta.

Many of these songs include extra stress on certain syllables as well as pitched shouts (kakegoe). Kakegoe are generally shouts of cheer but in min&#x27;yō, they are often included as parts of choruses. There are many kakegoe, though they vary from region to region. In Okinawa Min&#x27;yō, for example, the common &quot;ha iya sasa!&quot; appears. In mainland Japan, however, &quot;a yoisho!,&quot; &quot;sate!,&quot; or &quot;a sore!&quot; are more common. Others include &quot;a donto koi!,&quot; and &quot;dokoisho!&quot;

Recently a guild-based system known as the iemoto system has been in effect in some forms of min&#x27;yō. This system originally developed for transmitting classical genres such as nagauta, shakuhachi, or koto music, but since it proved profitable to teachers and was supported by students who wished to obtain certificates of proficiency. It continues to spread to genres such as min&#x27;yō, Tsugaru-jamisen and other forms of music that were traditionally transmitted more informally. Today some min&#x27;yō are passed on in such pseudo-family organizations and long apprenticeships are common.

===Okinawan folk music===
Umui, religious songs, shima uta, dance songs, and, especially kachāshī, lively celebratory music, were all popular on the island. Okinawan folk music differs from mainland Japanese folk music in several ways.

Okinawan folk music is often accompanied by the sanshin, whereas in mainland Japan the shamisen accompanies instead. Other Okinawan instruments include the sanba (which produce a clicking sound similar to that of castanets), taiko and a sharp finger whistle called .

A pentatonic scale is often used in min&#x27;yō from the main islands of Japan. In this pentatonic scale the subdominant and leading tone (scale degrees 4 and 7 of the Western major scale) are omitted, resulting in a musical scale with no half steps between each note. (Do, Re, Mi, Sol, La in solfeggio, or scale degrees 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6). Okinawan min&#x27;yō, however, uses scales that include the half-steps omitted in the aforementioned pentatonic scale, when analyzed in the Western discipline of music. In fact, the most common scale used in Okinawan min&#x27;yō includes scale degrees 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

===Traditional instruments===

* Taiko (i.e. Wadaiko) 太鼓～和太鼓
* Tsuzumi (鼓) (also known as Kotsuzumi)

== Arrival of Western music ==
===Japanese blues/Enka===
After the Meiji Restoration introduced Western musical instruction, Shuji Isawa compiled songs like &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; for use in public education. Two major forms of music that developed during this period were shōka, which was composed to bring western music to schools, and gunka.

As Japan moved towards representative democracy in the late 19th century, leaders hired singers to sell copies of songs that aired their messages, since the leaders themselves were usually prohibited from speaking in public. 
A distinctively Japanese form of tango called &quot;dodompa&quot; emerged. Kayōkyoku became associated with traditional Japanese structures influenced by Enka. Famous enka singers include Hibari Misora, Saburo Kitajima, Ikuzo Yoshi and Haruo Minami.

===Art music===

====Western classical music====

Shuji Isawa (1851–1917) studied music at Bridgewater Normal School and Harvard University and was an important figure in the development of Western-influenced Japanese music in the Meiji Era (1868–1912). On returning to Japan in 1879, Isawa formed the Ongaku-Torishirabe-Gakari (Music Investigation Agency), a national research center for Western music; it was later renamed the Tokyo Music School (Tôkyô ongaku gakkô). In 1880, Isawa&#x27;s American friend and teacher, Luther Whiting Mason, accepted a two-year appointment. Kosaku Yamada, Yoshinao Nakada, and Toru Takemitsu are Japanese composers who have successively developed what is now known as Japanese Classical Music.

Western classical music established a strong presence in Japan, making the country one of the most important markets for this music tradition. Toru Takemitsu composed avant-garde music, contemporary classical music, and movie scoring.

===== Orchestras =====
* Hiroshima Symphony Orchestra
* Hyogo Performing Arts Center Orchestra
* Japan Philharmonic Orchestra
* Kanagawa Philharmonic Orchestra
* Nagoya Philharmonic Orchestra
* New Japan Philharmonic
* NHK Symphony Orchestra
* Orchestra Ensemble Kanazawa
* Osaka Philharmonic Orchestra
* Osaka Shion Wind Orchestra
* Sapporo Symphony Orchestra
* Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra
* Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra
* Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra
* Tokyo Symphony Orchestra
* Yomiuri Nippon Symphony Orchestra
Besides traditional symphony orchestras, Japan is internationally prominent in the field of wind bands. The All-Japan Band Association is the governing body for wind band competitions in the country.

====Jazz====

From the 1930s on (except during World War II, when it was repressed as music of the enemy) jazz maintained a strong presence in Japan. The country is an important market for the music, and it is common that recordings unavailable in the United States or Europe are available there. A number of Japanese jazz musicians, such as June (born in Japan) and Sadao Watanabe have a large fan base outside their native country.

==Popular music==

===J-pop===
J-pop, an abbreviation for Japanese pop is a loosely defined musical genre that entered the musical mainstream of Japan in the 1990s. J-pop has its roots in 1960s pop and rock music, such as the Beatles, which 70s rock bands fused rock with Japanese music. J-pop was further defined by Japanese new wave bands such as Southern All Stars in the late 1970s. Eventually, J-pop replaced &quot;kayōkyoku&quot; (&quot;Lyric Singing Music&quot;, a term for Japanese pop music from the 1920s to the 1980s) in the Japanese music scene. The term was coined by the Japanese media to distinguish Japanese music from foreign music.

====Idol music====

Japanese idol musical artists are a significant part of the market, with girl groups and boy bands regularly topping the singles chart. These include boy band Arashi, which had the best-selling singles of 2008 and 2009, and girl group AKB48, which have had the best-selling singles each year of the 2010s. Since the end of the 2010s, more and more idol groups have emerged. Their success is sometimes termed &quot;Idol sengoku jidai&quot; (アイドル戦国時代; lit. Idol war age). In 2014, about 486,000 people attended Momoiro Clover Z&#x27;s live concerts, which was the highest record for female musicians in Japan for this year. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, many idol groups have seen their sales plummet. For example, AKB48&#x27;s physical sales have fallen from over a million copies sold per single to around 300,000, while groups such as Nogizaka46, Sakurazaka46 or Hinatazaka46 have seen a smaller drop, with average sales of 500,000 to 700,000 copies for their recent singles, making them the most trending Japanese idol groups of the 2020s.

====Dance and disco music====
In 1984, American musician Michael Jackson&#x27;s album &quot;Thriller&quot; became the first album by a Western artist to sell over one million copies in Japanese Oricon charts history. His style is cited as one of the models for Japanese dance music, leading the popularity of Avex Group musicians and dancers.

In 1990, Avex Trax began to release the Super Eurobeat series in Japan. Eurobeat in Japan led the popularity of group dance form Para Para. While Avex&#x27;s artists such as Every Little Thing and Ayumi Hamasaki became popular in the 1990s, in the late 1990s Hikaru Utada and Morning Musume emerged. Hikaru Utada&#x27;s debut album, &quot;First Love&quot;, became the highest-selling album in Japan selling over 7 million copies, while Ayumi Hamasaki became Japan&#x27;s top selling female and solo artist, and Morning Musume remains one of the most well-known girl groups in the Japanese pop music industry.

===Rock===
In the 1960s, many Japanese rock bands were influenced by Western rock, along with Appalachian folk music, psychedelic rock, mod and similar genres: a phenomenon called Group Sounds (G.S.). John Lennon became one of the most popular Western musicians in Japan. Late 1960s, Group Sounds bands such as The Tempters, the Tigers, the Golden Cups, the Spiders, the Jaguars, the Ox, the Village Singers, the Carnabeats, the Wild Ones, the Mops were popular. After the boom of Group Sounds came folk singer-songwriters. the Tigers was the most popular Group Sounds band in the era. Later, some of the members of the Tigers, the Tempters and the Spiders formed the first Japanese supergroup Pyg.

Kenji Sawada and Kenichi Hagiwara started their solo career in the early 1970s along with rock bands such as the Power House, Blues Creation, and late 70s hard rock bands like Murasaki, Condition Green, Bow Wow. Carol (led by Eikichi Yazawa), RC Succession and Funny Company helped define the rock sound. In the late 70s, Creation and Char performed Jeff Beck-style rock. Beginning in the late sixties, but mostly in the seventies, musicians mixed rock with American-style folk and pop elements, usually labelled folk rock because of their regular use of the acoustic guitar. This includes bands like Tulip, Banban, and Garo. Rock artists include an early Southern All Stars.
Japanese musicians began experimenting with electronic rock in the 1970s. The most notable was Isao Tomita, whose 1972 album &quot;Electric Samurai: Switched on Rock&quot; featured electronic synthesizer renditions of contemporary rock and pop songs. Other early examples of electronic rock records include Inoue Yousui&#x27;s folk rock and pop rock album &quot;Ice World&quot; (1973) and Osamu Kitajima&#x27;s progressive psychedelic rock album &quot;Benzaiten&quot; (1974), both of which involved contributions from Haruomi Hosono, who later started the electronic music group &quot;Yellow Magic Band&quot; (later known as Yellow Magic Orchestra) in 1977.

In the 1980s, Yutaka Ozaki was popular in young rock fans. Pop rock group such as C-C-B, Tokyo JAP, and Red Warriors gained hit songs. Boøwy inspired alternative rock bands like Shonen Knife, the Pillows, and Tama &amp; Little Creatures as well as more experimental bands such as Boredoms and mainstream bands such as Glay. In 1980, Huruoma and Ry Cooder, an American musician, collaborated on a rock album with Shoukichi Kina, driving force behind the aforementioned Okinawan band Champloose. They were followed by Sandii &amp; the Sunsetz, who further mixed Japanese and Okinawan influences. Also during the 1980s, Japanese metal and rock bands gave birth to the movement known as visual kei, represented during its history by bands like X Japan, Buck-Tick, Luna Sea, Malice Mizer and many others, some of which experienced national, and international success in the latest years.

In the 1990s, Japanese rock musicians such as B&#x27;z, Mr. Children, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel, Glay, Southern All Stars, Judy and Mary, Tube, Spitz, Wands, T-Bolan, Field of View, Deen, Lindberg, Sharam Q, the Yellow Monkey, the Brilliant Green and Dragon Ash achieved great commercial success. B&#x27;z is the #1 best selling act in Japanese music since Oricon started to count, followed by Mr. Children. In the 1990s, pop songs were often used in films, anime, television advertisement and dramatic programming, becoming some of Japan&#x27;s best-sellers. The rise of disposable pop has been linked with the popularity of karaoke, leading to criticism that it is consumerist: Kazufumi Miyazawa of the Boom said &quot;I hate that buy, listen, and throw away and sing at a karaoke bar mentality.&quot; Of the visual kei bands, Luna Sea, whose members toned down their on-stage attire with on-going success, was very successful, while Malice Mizer, La&#x27;cryma Christi, Shazna, Janne Da Arc, and Fanatic Crisis also achieved commercial success in the late 1990s.

The rock band Supercar, which was characterized as having &quot;almost foundational importance to 21st century Japanese indie rock&quot;, released its influential first album in 1998. They remained active through 2005, with their later albums containing more electronic rock.
The first Fuji Rock Festival opened in 1997. Rising Sun Rock Festival opened in 1999. Summer Sonic Festival and Rock in Japan Festival opened in 2000. Though the rock scene in the 2000s was not as strong, bands such as Bump of Chicken, Asian Kung–Fu Generation, One Ok Rock, Flow, Orange Range, Radwimps, Sambomaster, Remioromen, Uverworld and Aqua Timez achieved success. Orange Range also ventured into hip hop. Established bands as B&#x27;z, Mr. Children, Glay, and L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel continued to top charts, though B&#x27;z and Mr. Children are the only bands to maintain high sales through the years.

Japanese rock has a vibrant underground rock scene, best known internationally for noise rock bands such as Boredoms and Melt Banana, as well as stoner rock bands such as Boris, psychedelic rock bands such as Acid Mothers Temple, and alternative acts such as Shonen Knife (who were championed in the West by Kurt Cobain), Pizzicato Five and the Pillows (who gained international attention in 1999 for the &quot;FLCL&quot; soundtrack). More conventional indie rock artists such as Eastern Youth, the Band Apart and Number Girl found some success in Japan, but little recognition outside of their home country. Other notable international touring indie rock acts are Mono and Nisennenmondai.

====Punk rock / alternative====

Early examples of punk rock include SS, the Star Club, the Stalin, , , Bomb Factory, Lizard (who were produced by the Stranglers) and Friction (whose guitarist Reck played with Teenage Jesus and the Jerks before returning to Tokyo) and the Blue Hearts. The early punk scene was filmed by Sogo Ishii, who directed the 1982 film &quot;Burst City&quot; featuring a cast of punk bands/musicians and also filmed videos for The Stalin. In the 1980s, hardcore bands such as GISM, Gauze, Confuse, Lip Cream and Systematic Death began appearing, some incorporating crossover elements. The independent scene also included a diverse number of alternative/post-punk/new wave artists such as Aburadako, P-Model, Uchoten, Auto-Mod, Buck-Tick, Guernica and Yapoos (both of which featured Jun Togawa), G-Schmitt, Totsuzen Danball and Jagatara, along with noise/industrial bands such as Hijokaidan and Hanatarashi.

Ska-punk bands of the late nineties extending in the years 2000 include Shakalabbits and 175R (pronounced &quot;inago rider&quot;).

===Heavy metal===

Japan is a successful market for metal bands. Notable examples are Judas Priest&#x27;s &quot;Unleashed in the East&quot;, Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Made in Japan&quot;, Iron Maiden&#x27;s &quot;Maiden Japan&quot;, Michael Schenker Group&#x27;s &quot;One Night at Budokan&quot; and Dream Theater&#x27;s &quot;Live at Budokan&quot;.

Japanese metal emerged in the late 1970s, pioneered by bands like Bow Wow, formed in 1975 by guitarist Kyoji Yamamoto, and Loudness, formed in 1981 by guitarist Akira Takasaki. Contemporary bands like Earthshaker, Anthem and 44 Magnum released their debut albums only around the mid eighties. The first overseas live performances were by Bow Wow in 1978 in Hong Kong, the Montreux Jazz Festival, and the Reading Festival in England in 1982. In 1983, Loudness toured United States and Europe. In 1985, the first Japanese metal act was signed to a major US label. Their albums &quot;Thunder in the East&quot; and &quot;Lightning Strikes&quot;, released in 1985 and 1986, peaked at number 74 (while number 4 in homeland Oricon chart), and number 64 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts respectively. Till the end of the eighties only two other bands, Ezo and Dead End, released albums in the United States. In the eighties few bands had a female member, like the all-female band Show-Ya fronted by Keiko Terada, and Terra Rosa with Kazue Akao on vocals. In September 1989, Show-Ya&#x27;s album &quot;Outerlimits&quot; was released, reaching #3 on the Oricon album chart. Heavy metal bands reached their peak in the late 1980s and then many disbanded until the mid-1990s.
In 1982, some of the first Japanese glam metal bands were formed, like Seikima-II with Kabuki-inspired makeup, and X Japan who pioneered the Japanese movement known as visual kei, and became the best-selling metal band. In 1985, Seikima-II&#x27;s album &quot;Seikima-II - Akuma ga Kitarite Heavy Metal&quot; was released and although it reached number 48 on the Oricon album chart, it exceeded 100,000 in sales, the first time for any Japanese metal band. Their albums charted regularly in the top ten until the mid-1990s. In April 1989, X Japan&#x27;s second album &quot;Blue Blood&quot; was released and went to number 6, and after 108 weeks on charts sold 712,000 copies. Their third and best-selling album &quot;Jealousy&quot; was released in July 1991; it topped the charts and sold 1.11 million copies. Two number one studio albums, &quot;Art of Life&quot; and &quot;Dahlia&quot;, a singles compilation &quot;X Singles&quot;, all sold more than half a million, ending up with thirteen top five singles before disbanding in 1997.

Japanese metal came to global attention in 2014 with the success of &quot;kawaii metal&quot; band Babymetal. They recorded viral YouTube hits like &quot;Gimme Chocolate!!&quot; as well as international performances including at the UK&#x27;s Sonisphere Festival 2014 and Canada&#x27;s Heavy Montréal alongside the likes of Metallica and Slayer. Babymetal was the opening act to five of Lady Gaga&#x27;s concerts in her 2014 tour. Babymetal won numerous awards including Kerrang!&#x27;s The Spirit of Independence Award and Metal Hammer&#x27;s Breakthrough Band Award.

====Extreme metal====
Japanese extreme metal bands formed in the wake of the American and European wave, but did not get any bigger exposure until the 1990s, and the genre took underground form in Japan. The first thrash metal bands formed in the early 1980s, like United, whose music incorporates death metal elements, and Outrage. United performed in Los Angeles at the metal festival &quot;Foundations Forum&quot; in September 1995 and released a few albums in North America. Formed in the mid-1980s, Doom played in the United States in October 1988 at CBGB, and was active until 2000 when it disbanded.

The first bands to play black metal music were Sabbat, who is still active, and Bellzlleb, who was active until the early 1990s. Other notable acts are Sigh, Abigail, and Gallhammer.

Doom metal also gained an audience in Japan. The two best-known Japanese doom metal acts are Church of Misery and Boris: both gained considerable popularity outside the country.

====Metalcore====
In the 2000s, Japanese metalcore bands such as Tokyo&#x27;s Crystal Lake, Nagoya natives Coldrain and Deathgaze, Kobe&#x27;s Fear, and Loathing in Las Vegas, and Osaka&#x27;s Crossfaith formed.

===Hip hop===

Hip-hop came in the late 1980s and continues to thrive. This was mainly due to the music world&#x27;s belief that &quot;Japanese sentences were not capable of forming the rhyming effect that was contained in American rappers&#x27; songs.&quot;

Different &quot;families&quot; of rappers perform on stage at a genba, or nightclub. A family is essentially a collection of rap groups that are usually headed by one of the more famous Tokyo acts, which also include proteges. They are important because they are &quot;the key to understanding stylistic differences between groups.&quot; Hip-hop fans in the audience are in control of the club. They judge who is the winner in rap contests on stage. An example of this can be seen with the battle between rap artists Dabo (a major label artist) and Kan (an indie artist). Kan challenged Dabo while Dabo was mid-performance. The event highlighted showed &quot;the openness of the scene and the fluidity of boundaries in clubs.&quot;

=== Grime ===
Grime is a British electronic genre that emerged in the early 2000s derived from UK garage and jungle, and draws influence from dancehall, ragga, and hip hop. The style is typified by rapid, syncopated breakbeats, generally around 140 bpm, and often features an aggressive or jagged electronic sound. Rapping is a significant element, and lyrics often revolve around gritty depictions of urban life.

In 2004, Japanese DJ&#x27;s began to play grime. In 2008 that MC&#x27;s, primarily from Osaka, began to emerge. The MC&#x27;s were inspired by British grime crew Roll Deep, and their mixtape &quot;Rules And Regulations.&quot; The Osaka MC&#x27;s consisted of pioneers MC Dekishi, MC Duff and MC Tacquilacci. MC Dekishi released the first ever Japanese grime mixtape in 2009, titled &quot;Grime City Volume 1&quot;. Osaka MC&#x27;s are known for rapping extremely fast. Another scene sprung up in the Tokyo region of Shibuya led by Carpainter, Double Clapperz, MC ONJUICY, PAKIN and Sakana Lavenda.

===Synth-pop and club music===
Synth-pop in Japan was influenced by German electronic and techno artists such as Kraftwerk. New wave and synth-pop bands such as Hikasyuu, P-Model and The Plastics were popular. Many musicians of the 1970s and 80s who were known for pop music turned to techno production such as C-C-B and Akiko Yano. In the 1990s, Denki Groove formed and became mainstays of the Japanese electronica scene. Artists such as Polysics pay explicit homage to this era. Capsule&#x27;s Yasutaka Nakata has been involved behind the scenes of popular electropop acts Perfume and Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, both of which had domestic and international success; Kyary in particular was dubbed the &quot;Kawaii Harajuku Ambassador&quot;.

==== Kawaii Future Bass ====

Kawaii Future Bass is a subgenre of Future Bass, with a generally upbeat sound and heavily inspired by Japanese culture, and often includes Japanese lyrics or references to anime or manga. It began to see success around 2015, mostly pioneered by Snail&#x27;s House. Due to Japan&#x27;s increasing influence in foreign countries, Kawaii Future Bass grew popular around the world.

===Roots and country music===
In the late 1980s, roots bands like Shang Shang Typhoon and the Boom became popular. Okinawan roots bands like Nenes and Kina were also commercially and critically successful. This led to a second wave of Okinawan music, led by the sudden success of Rinken Band. Bands followed, including the comebacks of Champluse and Kina, as led by Kawachiya Kikusuimaru; very similar to kawachi ondo is Tadamaru Sakuragawa&#x27;s goshu ondo.

J-country is a form of J-pop that originated in the 1960s, during the international popularity of Westerns. Major companies such as Nintendo and Sony continue to produce country and Western music within Japan.

===Latin, reggae and ska music===

Music from Indonesia, Jamaica and elsewhere were assimilated. African soukous and Latin music, like Orquesta de la Luz (オルケスタ・デ・ラ・ルス), was popular as was Jamaican reggae and ska, exemplified by Mice Teeth, Mute Beat, La-ppisch, Home Grown and Ska Flames, Determinations, and Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra.

===Noise music===

Another recognized music form from Japan is noise music, also known as Japanoise when referring to noise music made by Japanese artists. Some of the most prominent representatives of this form include Merzbow, Masonna, Hanatarash, and The Gerogerigegege. As befits the challenging nature of the music, some noise music performers have become notorious for their extreme on-stage antics including (but not limited to) physically injuring themselves, destroying their musical equipment, or damaging the venue they are playing at.

=== Theme music ===

Theme music for films, anime, tokusatsu () and dorama are considered a separate music genre. While musicians and bands from all genres have recorded for Japanese television and film, several artists and groups have spent most of their careers performing theme songs and composing soundtracks for visual media. Such artists include Masato Shimon (current holder of the world record for most successful single in Japan for &quot;Oyoge! Taiyaki-kun&quot;), Ichirou Mizuki, all of the members of JAM Project (i.e. Hironobu Kageyama who sung the openings for &quot;Dengeki Sentai Changeman&quot; and &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;), Akira Kushida, members of Project.R, Isao Sasaki and Mitsuko Horie. Notable composers of Japanese theme music include Joe Hisaishi, Michiru Oshima, Yoko Kanno, Toshihiko Sahashi, Yuki Kajiura, Kōtarō Nakagawa, Shunsuke Kikuchi and Yuki Hayashi.

=== Game music ===
When the first electronic games were sold, they had rudimentary sound chips with which to produce music. As the technology advanced, quality increased dramatically. The first game to take credit for its music was &quot;Xevious&quot;, also noteworthy (at that time) for its deeply constructed stories. One of the most important games in the history of the video game music is &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;. Koichi Sugiyama, who composed for various anime and TV shows, including &quot;Cyborg 009&quot; and a feature film of &quot;Godzilla vs. Biollante&quot;, got involved in the project out of curiosity and proved that games can have serious soundtracks. Until his involvement, music and sounds were often neglected in the development of video games and programmers with little musical knowledge were forced to write the soundtracks as well. Undaunted by technological limits, Sugiyama worked with only 8-part polyphony to create a soundtrack that would not tire the player despite hours of gameplay.

A well-known author of game music is Nobuo Uematsu. Uematsu&#x27;s earlier compositions for the game series, &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, on Famicom (Nintendo Entertainment System in America), were arranged for full orchestral score. In 2003, he took his rock-based tunes from their original MIDI format and created the Black Mages. Yasunori Mitsuda is the composer of music for such games as &quot;Xenogears&quot;, &quot;Xenosaga Episode I&quot;, &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;, and &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;. Koji Kondo, the sound manager for Nintendo, wrote themes for &quot;Zelda&quot; and &quot;Mario&quot;. Jun Senoue composed for &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. He also is the main guitarist of Crush 40, which is known for creating the theme songs to &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;, &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot;, &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot;, and &quot;Sonic and the Black Knight&quot;, as well as other &quot;Sonic&quot; games. Motoi Sakuraba composed the &quot;Tales&quot;, &quot;Dark Souls&quot;, &quot;Eternal Sonata&quot;, &quot;Star Ocean&quot;, &quot;Valkyrie Profile&quot;, &quot;Golden Sun&quot;, and the &quot;Baten Kaitos&quot; games, as well as numerous Mario sports games. Yuzo Koshiro composed electronic music-influenced soundtracks for games such as &quot;Revenge of Shinobi&quot; and the &quot;Streets of Rage&quot; series.

Pop singers such as Hikaru Utada, Nana Mizuki and BoA sometimes sing for games.

<text>, also known by its romanized initialism NHK, is a Japanese public broadcaster. It is a statutory corporation funded by viewers&#x27; payments of a television license fee.

NHK operates two terrestrial television channels (NHK General TV and NHK Educational TV), three satellite television channels (NHK BS; as well as two ultra-high-definition television channels, NHK BS Premium 4K and NHK BS8K), and three radio networks (NHK Radio 1, NHK Radio 2, and NHK FM).

NHK also provides an international broadcasting service, known as NHK World-Japan. NHK World-Japan is composed of NHK World TV, NHK World Premium, and the shortwave radio service Radio Japan (RJ). World Radio Japan also makes some of its programs available on the Internet.

NHK was the first broadcaster in the world to broadcast in high-definition (using multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding, also known as Hi-Vision) and in 8K.

==History==

NHK&#x27;s earliest forerunner was the , founded in 1924 under the leadership of Count Gotō Shinpei. Tokyo Broadcasting Station, along with separate organizations in Osaka and Nagoya, began radio broadcasts in 1925. The three stations merged under the first incarnation of NHK in August 1926. NHK was modelled on the BBC of the United Kingdom, and the merger and reorganisation was carried out under the auspices of the pre-war Ministry of Communications. NHK&#x27;s second radio network began in 1931, and the third radio network (FM) began in 1937.

===Radio broadcasting===
NHK began shortwave broadcasting on an experimental basis in the 1930s, and began regular English- and Japanese-language shortwave broadcasts in 1935 under the name Radio Japan, initially aimed at ethnic Japanese listeners in Hawaii and the west coast of North America. By the late 1930s, NHK&#x27;s overseas broadcasts were known as Radio Tokyo, which became an official name in 1941.

In November 1941, the Imperial Japanese Army nationalised all public news agencies and coordinated their efforts via the Information Liaison Confidential Committee. All published and broadcast news reports became official announcements of the Imperial Army General Headquarters in Tokyo for the duration of World War II. The famous Tokyo Rose wartime programs were broadcast by NHK. NHK also recorded and broadcast the &quot;Gyokuon-hōsō&quot;, the surrender speech made by Emperor Hirohito, in August 1945.

Following the war, in September 1945, the Allied occupation administration under General Douglas MacArthur banned all international broadcasting by NHK, and repurposed several NHK facilities and frequencies for use by the Far East Network (now American Forces Network). Japanese-American radio broadcaster Frank Shozo Baba joined NHK during this time and led an early post-war revamp of its programming. Radio Japan resumed overseas broadcasts in 1952.

A new was enacted in 1950, which made NHK a listener-supported independent corporation and simultaneously opened the market for commercial broadcasting in Japan. NHK started television broadcasting in 1953, followed by its educational TV channel in 1959 and color television broadcasts in 1960.

NHK opened the first stage of its current headquarters in Japan&#x27;s capital city&#x27;s special ward Shibuya as an international broadcasting center for the 1964 Summer Olympics, the first widely televised Olympic Games. The complex was gradually expanded through 1973 when it became the headquarters for NHK. The previous headquarters adjacent to Hibiya Park was redeveloped as the Hibiya City high-rise complex.

===Satellite broadcasting===
NHK began experimental satellite broadcasting with the NHK BS 1 channel in 1984, followed by NHK BS 2 in 1985. Both channels began regular broadcasts in 1989. In April 2011, BS 1 was rebranded while BS 2 channel ceased broadcasting and was replaced by &quot;BS Premium&quot; which broadcasts on the channel formerly used by BShi.

International satellite broadcasts to North America and Europe began in 1995, which led to the launch of NHK World in 1998. It became free-to-air over the Astra 19.2°E (Astra 1L) and Eurobird satellites in Europe in 2008.

===Digital television===

NHK began digital television broadcasting in December 2000 through BS Digital, followed by terrestrial digital TV broadcasts in three major metropolitan areas in 2003. NHK&#x27;s digital television coverage gradually expanded to cover almost all of Japan by 24 July 2011, when analog transmissions were discontinued &amp; ended (except in three prefectures that were heavily affected by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami – Iwate, Miyagi, Fukushima – where it was discontinued on 31 March 2012).

===&quot;Studies of Broadcasting&quot;===
From 1963 to 1999, NHK published the journal &quot;Studies of broadcasting: an international annual of broadcasting science&quot;.

==Organization==
NHK is a dependent corporation chartered by the Japanese Broadcasting Act and primarily funded by license fees. NHK World broadcasting (for overseas viewers/listeners) is funded by the Japanese government. The annual budget of NHK is subject to review and approval by the Diet of Japan. The Diet also appoints the twelve-member board of governors (経営委員会 &quot;keiei iinkai&quot;) that oversees NHK.

NHK is managed on a full-time basis by an consisting of a president, executive vice president and seven to ten managing directors who oversee the areas of NHK operations. The executive board reports to the board of governors.

==License fee==
NHK is funded by , a system analogous to the license fee used in some English-speaking countries. The Broadcasting Act which governs NHK&#x27;s funding stipulates anyone with equipment able to receive NHK must pay. The fee is standardized, with discounts for 6 and 12 monthly payments, as well a different fee rate for residents of Okinawa prefecture. For viewers making annual payments by credit card with no special discounts, the reception fee is 12,765 yen per year for terrestrial reception only, and 21,765 yen per year for both terrestrial and broadcast satellite reception.

However, the Broadcasting Act specifies no punitive actions for nonpayment; as a result, after a rash of NHK-related scandals including an accounting one, the number of people in 2006 who had not paid the license fee surpassed one million watchers. This incident sparked debate over the fairness of the fee system. That year, the NHK opted to take legal action against those most flagrantly in violation of the law. By fiscal year 2023, the amount of those refusing to pay had gone up to 1.66 million.

This fee and how it is charged is unpopular with some citizens. This led to the formation of the , also known as , a single-issue political party, which has protested this fee with representatives in the upper house.

In the 2025 fiscal year, NHK will have a projected shortfall of 40 billion yen in license fees. But the network seeks to fill the hole left by non-paying and no-television-watching watchers by collecting fees for a new streaming service planned to start at the beginning of the year. According to NHK, the new &quot;internet-only&quot; fee of 1,100 yen (USD $7) a month, the same as the broadcast fee, could add around 100 million yen (USD $634,000) to its yearly budget.

==TV programming==
NHK broadcasts a variety of programming.

===News===
NHK offers local, national, and world news reports. &quot;NHK News 7&quot; airs daily and is broadcast bilingually with both Japanese and English audio tracks on NHK General TV and NHK&#x27;s international channels TV Japan and NHK World Premium. The flagship news program &quot;News Watch 9&quot; is also bilingual and airs on NHK General TV and the international channels and NHK World Premium. &quot;World News&quot;, a program which airs bulletins from international broadcasters interpreted in Japanese, is aired on NHK BS1 with &quot;Catch! Sekai no Top News&quot; in the morning and &quot;International News Report&quot; at night, with the latter also airing on NHK World Premium. News on NHK BS1 is aired at 50 minutes past the hour except during live sports events.

NHK also offers news for the deaf (which airs on NHK Educational TV), regional news (which airs on NHK General TV) and children&#x27;s news. &quot;Newsline&quot; is an English-language newscast designed for foreign viewers and airs on NHK World.

In his book &quot;Broadcasting Politics in Japan: NHK and Television News&quot;, Ellis S. Krauss states: &#x27;In the 1960s and 1970s, external critics of NHK news were complaining about the strict neutrality, the lack of criticism of the government, and the &#x27;self-regulation in covering events&#x27;. Krauss claims that little had changed by the 1980s and 1990s. After the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, NHK was criticised for underplaying the dangers from radioactive contamination.

===Emergency reporting===
Under the Broadcasting Act, NHK is under the obligation to broadcast early warning emergency reporting in times of natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis. Their national network of seismometers in cooperation with the Japan Meteorological Agency makes NHK capable of delivering earthquake early warnings seconds after detection, as well as a more detailed report with Shindo intensity measurements within two-to-three minutes after the quake. They also broadcast air attack warnings in the event of war, using the J-Alert system.

All warnings are broadcast in Japanese, with tsunami warnings also delivered in four foreign languages: English, Mandarin Chinese, Korean and Portuguese (Japan has small Chinese, Korean and Brazilian populations). The warnings were broadcast in these languages during the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

===Sports===
NHK broadcasts sumo wrestling, baseball games, Olympic Games, soccer games, and a range of other sports. Their broadcast of the last two days of October 1952&#x27;s autumn sumo tournament became the first ever televised sports broadcast in Japan.

===Music===
The NHK Symphony Orchestra, financially sponsored by NHK, was formerly (until 1951) the Japanese Symphony Orchestra. Its website details the orchestra&#x27;s history and ongoing concert programme. Since 1953, NHK has broadcast the &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot; song contest on New Year&#x27;s Eve, ending shortly before midnight in PIX System.

===Drama===
A sentimental morning show, a weekly jidaigeki and a year-long show, the &quot;Taiga drama&quot;, spearhead the network&#x27;s fiction offerings.

NHK is also making efforts at broadcasting dramas made in foreign countries as .

===Children===
The longest running children&#x27;s show in Japan, , started broadcasting in 1959 and still airs to this day Monday to Friday at 17:36–18:00 JST, Sunday at 17:30–17:54 JST, with rebroadcasts Tuesday to Sunday at 5:00–5:24 JST on NHK World Premium.

==Employee and internal issues==
===Insider trading ban===
In 2007, three employees of NHK were fined and fired for insider trading. They had profited by trading shares based on exclusive NHK knowledge.

On 11 July 2008, NHK introduced a ban prohibiting stock trading by employees, numbering around 5,700, who had access to its internal news information management system. The employees were required to pledge in writing that they would not trade in stocks, and were required to gain approval from senior staff to sell shares they already held. NHK banned short-term stock trading completed in periods of six months or less for all other employees.

The ban did not extend to employees&#x27; families, nor did NHK request any reports on their transactions.

===Overwork death===
On 24 July 2013, a reporter at NHK Metropolitan Broadcasting Center died of congestive heart failure. In May 2014, the Shibuya Labor Standards Inspection Office of the Tokyo Labor Bureau certified it as a &quot;karōshi&quot; (overwork death). Although NHK did not report on this matter, it was announced in October 2017. Ryōichi Ueda, the chairman of NHK, visited the reporter&#x27;s parents&#x27; home and apologized to them.

=== Relationship with Johnny &amp; Associates and Starto Entertainment ===

In regards to NHK&#x27;s relationship with Johnny &amp; Associates, they have stated that NHK acknowledges that sexual abuse allegations related to Johnny &amp; Associates had repeatedly been reported for many years, but NHK also stated that they lacked awareness of the issue at that time and chose not to follow up or cover the issue entirely. In addition, they stated that they failed in their role as a news media organization, and simply sat idle as many minors became sexual abuse victims. On 8 September 2023, NHK said in a statement that they took the matter seriously, and that they would &quot;work harder to ensure that human rights are more respected in the broadcasting industry&quot; when it comes to using performers who best fit program content and production. The public broadcaster added that it did not fully acknowledge the sexual abuse matter despite various weekly magazine articles about the allegations and a Tokyo High Court ruling in 2004. A few weeks later, NHK announced that it would suspend new contracts with Johnny&#x27;s performers–including for their annual New Year&#x27;s Eve television special &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot;–until the company has implemented compensation and recurrence prevention measures. In February 2024, the company announced a strict policy of terminating the appearance of talents formerly affiliated with Johnny &amp; Associates on its programs and not allowing them to appear on new programs after FY2024. In October 2024, NHK Chairman Nobuo Inaba announced at a regular press conference that, he had confirmed efforts of Smile-Up to compensate victims and prevent recurrence and the separation of management from Starto Entertainment is steadily progressing, and that requests to perform–including Kōhaku Uta Gassen for current Starto celebrities would resume. Commercial broadcasters had already announced on the resumption of new appointments to celebrities belonging to Starto.

==Criticism and controversies==
===Criticism over comments about Japanese wartime history===
NHK has occasionally faced various criticisms for its treatment of Japan&#x27;s wartime history.

, the 21st Director-General of NHK, caused controversy by discussing Japan&#x27;s actions in World War II at his first press conference after being appointed on 20 December 2013. It was reported that Momii said NHK should support the Japanese government in its territorial dispute with China and South Korea. He also caused controversy by what some describe as the playing down of the comfort women issue in World War II, according to the &quot;Taipei Times&quot;, stating, &quot;[South] Korea&#x27;s statements that Japan is the only nation that forced this are puzzling. &#x27;Give us money, compensate us&#x27;, they say, but since all of this was resolved by the Japan–Korea peace treaty, why are they reviving this issue? It&#x27;s strange.&quot; It was subsequently reported by &quot;The Japan Times&quot; that on his first day at NHK Momii asked members of the executive team to hand in their resignation on the grounds they had all been appointed by his predecessor.

A number of civil society groups protested against Momii&#x27;s continued tenure as Director-General of NHK. On 27 January 2014, the issued a public letter calling for Momii&#x27;s resignation on the grounds that the remarks he made at his inaugural press conference were explosive. The letter stated that if Momii did not resign by the end of April, its members would freeze their licence fee payments for half a year. While Momii did not resign, he was not reappointed and retired after serving only one term of three years.

On 17 October 2014, &quot;The Times&quot; claimed to have received internal NHK documents which banned any reference to the Nanjing Massacre, to Japan&#x27;s use of wartime sex slaves during World War II, and to its territorial dispute with China in its English-language broadcasting.

===Black Lives Matter video===
On 10 June 2020, NHK apologized and took down an 80-second video about the Black Lives Matter movement and George Floyd protests that was criticized for its &quot;crude&quot; animation of protesters and its focus on economic inequality rather than police brutality. An official statement signed by Yuichi Tabata, head of NHK&#x27;s International News Division, was released through NHK&#x27;s official website.

===Olympics documentary claims===
On 9 January 2022, NHK issued an apology over false allegations made in Director Naomi Kawase&#x27;s Tokyo Olympics documentary. Kawase was selected by the IOC in 2018 to cover Japanese reactions to the event and later during the COVID-19 pandemic. Footage and captions in the documentary alleged that protesters were being paid money to attend anti-Olympics rallies. One of the men interviewed later stated he was &quot;unsure&quot; if he had actually attended any anti-Olympics rallies. NHK Osaka cited &quot;editorial oversights&quot; and &quot;deficiencies in research&quot;, issuing an apology. Some anti-Olympic activists demanded that the documentary should be removed. Some activists were concerned that the misinformation was spread by NHK to silence those who opposed the Tokyo Olympics during the pandemic. NHK denied that the footage was deliberately fabricated to mislead the public. On 13 January 2022, the NHK Osaka director Terunobu Maeda apologized during a press conference, admitting that the captions &quot;should not have been included&quot;. Once again, he denied that the incident was a fabrication. On 10 February 2022 NHK Osaka announced an internal review and fired 6 production staff members. 

===COVID-19===
In December 2023, Japan&#x27;s Broadcasting Ethics and Program Improvement Organization (BPO) concluded that NHK had breached broadcasting ethics in its &quot;News Watch 9&quot; program, where people believed to have died from COVID-19 vaccine injury were treated as if they had died from COVID-19. Regarding the incident as an inappropriate way of reporting, NHK stated that it would take measures to avoid the repetition of the misconduct.

===Editorial independence===
, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated NHK to be &quot;Captured Public or State Managed/Owned Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

<text>, also known as the Star Festival (, &quot;Hoshimatsuri&quot;), is a Japanese festival originating from the Chinese Qixi Festival. It celebrates the meeting of the deities Orihime and Hikoboshi (represented by the stars Vega and Altair respectively). According to legend, the Milky Way separates these lovers, and they are allowed to meet only once a year on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month of the lunisolar calendar. The date of Tanabata varies by region of the country, but the first festivities begin on 7 July of the Gregorian calendar. The celebration is held at various days between July and August.

== History ==
The festival was introduced to Japan by the Empress Kōken in 755. It originated from , an alternative name for Qixi which is celebrated in China and also was adopted in the Kyoto Imperial Palace from the Heian period.

The festival gained widespread popularity amongst the general public by the early Edo period, when it became mixed with various Obon or Bon traditions (because Bon was held on 15th of the seventh month then), and developed into the modern Tanabata festival. Popular customs relating to the festival varied by region of the country, but generally, girls wished for better sewing and craftsmanship, and boys wished for better handwriting by writing wishes on strips of paper. At this time, the custom was to use dew left on taro leaves to create the ink used to write wishes. Incidentally, Bon is now held on 15 August on the solar calendar, close to its original date on the lunar calendar, making Tanabata and Bon separate events.

The name Tanabata is remotely related to the Japanese reading of the Chinese characters 七夕, which used to be read as &quot;Shichiseki&quot; (see explanation about the various kanji readings). It is believed that a Shinto purification ceremony existed around the same time, in which a Shinto miko wove a special cloth on a loom called a and offered it to a god to pray for protection of rice crops from rain or storm and for good harvest later in autumn. Gradually this ceremony merged with &quot;Kikkōden&quot; to become &quot;Tanabata&quot;. The Chinese characters 七夕 and the Japanese reading &quot;Tanabata&quot; joined to mean the same festival, although originally they were two different things, an example of &quot;jukujikun&quot;.

==Story==

Like Qixi and Chilseok, Tanabata was inspired by the famous Chinese folklore story, &quot;The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl&quot;. Some versions were included in the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;.

The most popular version is as follows:

, daughter of the , wove beautiful clothes by the bank of the . Her father loved the cloth that she wove and so she worked very hard every day to weave it. However, Orihime was sad that because of her hard work she could never meet and fall in love with anyone. Concerned about his daughter, Tentei arranged for her to meet (also referred to as ) who lived and worked on the other side of the Amanogawa. When the two met, they fell instantly in love with each other and married shortly thereafter. However, once married, Orihime would no longer weave cloth for Tentei and Hikoboshi allowed his cows to stray all over Heaven. In anger, Tentei separated the two lovers across the Amanogawa and forbade them to meet. Orihime became despondent at the loss of her husband and asked her father to let them meet again. Tentei was moved by his daughter&#x27;s tears and allowed the two to meet on the 7th day of the 7th month if she worked hard and finished her weaving. The first time they tried to meet, however, they found that they could not cross the river because there was no bridge. Orihime cried so much that a flock of magpies came and promised to make a bridge with their wings so that she could cross the river. It is said that if it rains on Tanabata, the magpies cannot come because of the rise of the river and the two lovers must wait until another year to meet. The rain of this day is called &quot;The tears of Orihime and Hikoboshi&quot;.

===Names===
====Characters====
&quot;Orihime&quot; and &quot;Hikoboshi&quot; are called various names in the different versions of the story.
====Festival====
The Festival of &quot;Tanabata&quot; is also known by various names:
===Other stories===
====Human male and Heavenly female====
Japanese scholars pointed out that some tales of the &quot;Tanabata&quot; cross over with the character of the &quot;Celestial Maiden&quot; (otherwise known in Japan as &quot;Tennin Nyoobo&quot; or &quot;Hagoromo&quot;).

Comparative scholarship on the Japanese variants points that at the beginning of the story, the human male goes near a lake for a variety of reasons (a prayer to the gods for a wife; a vision sent in a dream; a grateful animal points him the way). Over the course of the story, the human partner reaches the celestial realm where his wife and her family live. Once there, he is forced to perform tasks before they reunite. At the end of the narrative, the husband breaks a taboo (he should not eat a certain melon/gourd, but he does and is washed away) and he and his celestial wife are separated, only to reunite again during the night of 7 July.

James Danandjaja relates the Japanese tale of &quot;Amafuri Otome&quot; (&quot;The Woman who came from the Sky&quot;), as a similar tale of the unmarried mortal man, named Mikeran, who withholds the kimono from a bathing lady so she cannot fly home to the sky. Years after they marry, she finds her kimono and flies home with their children. Mikeran fashions a thousand straw sandals to reach the sky world and find his wife. When he meets his parents-in-law, the father-in-law forces him to perform some tasks, and tricks the human with cutting a thousand watermelons in one day. The human&#x27;s sky wife knows it is a trap, but he does it anyway and is washed away by a flood created from the watermelons. Thus, they can only meet on the night of the &quot;Tanabata&quot; festival.

====Human female and Heavenly male====
Professors Masako Satō and Noriko T. Reider provided a narrative analysis of an ancient tale involving a human female and her future consort, Prince Ame-waka-hiko. In this tale of the &quot;Otogi-zōshi&quot; genre, the Prince takes the form of a serpent and marries a human woman. He later reveals he is a heavenly deity named Dragon Prince. After some time, he disappears and his human bride must seek him out (akin to the Graeco-Roman myth of Cupid and Psyche), even reaching the heavenly realm, where his father, an &quot;oni&quot;, lives. At the end of this tale, the lovers are forcibly separated by the oni father and can only reunite during the &quot;Tanabata&quot;.

Noriko T. Reider draws attention to a second story of this combination: the &quot;Qian Luwei Tale&quot;. In this version, the human wife&#x27;s father is identified as Qian Luwei, and the male deity is Hikoboshi, the son of &quot;Bontennō&quot;, Brahma.

== Customs ==

In present-day Japan, people generally celebrate this day by writing wishes, sometimes in the form of poetry, on , small pieces of paper, and hanging them on bamboo, sometimes with other decorations (see also Wish Tree). The bamboo and decorations are often set afloat on a river or burned after the festival, around midnight or on the next day. This is analogous to the custom of floating paper ships and candles on rivers during Obon. Many areas in Japan have their own Tanabata customs, which are mostly related to local Obon traditions. There is also a traditional Tanabata song:

== Date ==
The original Tanabata date was based on the Japanese lunisolar calendar, which is about a month behind the Gregorian calendar. As a result, some festivals are held on 7 July, some are held on a few days around 7 August (according to the &quot;One-Month Delay&quot; way), while the others are still held on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month of the traditional Japanese lunisolar calendar, which is usually in August in the Gregorian Calendar.

The Gregorian dates of &quot;the seventh day of the seventh lunar month of the Japanese lunisolar calendar&quot; for the coming years are:
* 2018: August 17
* 2019: August 7
* 2020: August 25
* 2021: August 14
* 2022: August 4
* 2023: August 22
* 2024: August 10
* 2025: August 29
* 2026: August 19

== Festivals ==

Large-scale Tanabata festivals are held in many places in Japan, mainly along shopping malls and streets, which are decorated with large, colorful streamers. The most famous Tanabata festival is held in Sendai from 6 to 8 August. In the Kantō area, two of the largest Tanabata festivals are held in Hiratsuka, Kanagawa (around 7 July) and in Asagaya, Tokyo immediately prior to the start of the Obon holiday in mid August. A Tanabata festival is also held in São Paulo, Brazil around the first weekend of July and Los Angeles, California in the beginning of August.

Although Tanabata festivals vary by region, most festivals involve Tanabata decoration competitions. Other events may include parades and Miss Tanabata contests. Like other Japanese matsuri, many outdoor stalls sell food, provide carnival games, etc., and add to the festive atmosphere.

Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea often celebrates the Tanabata Festival featuring a greeting parade with Minnie Mouse as Orihime and Mickey Mouse as Hikoboshi.
== Sendai festival ==
The Sendai Tanabata Festival is the most famous in Japan. Tanabata has been celebrated in the region since the time of Date Masamune (1567–1636) who was the first warlord in the Sendai area. The festival began shortly after the city was founded in the early Edo Period. The Tanabata festival gradually developed and became larger over the years. Although the festival&#x27;s popularity started to dwindle after the Meiji Restoration, and almost disappeared during the economic depression that occurred after World War I, volunteers in Sendai revived the festival in 1928 and established the tradition of holding the festival from 6 to 8 August.

During World War II it was impossible to hold the festival, and almost no decorations were seen in the city from 1943 to 1945, but after the war, the first major Tanabata festival in Sendai was held in 1946, and featured 52 decorations. In 1947, the Showa Emperor Hirohito visited Sendai and was greeted by 5,000 Tanabata decorations. The festival subsequently developed into one of the three major summer festivals in the Tōhoku region and has become a major tourist attraction. The festival now includes a fireworks show that is held on 5 August.

At the Sendai Tanabata Festival, people traditionally use seven different kinds of decorations, which each represent different meanings. The seven decorations and their symbolic meanings are:

The ornamental ball (薬玉; Kusudama) often decorated above streamers in present-day Tanabata decorations was originally conceived in 1946 by the owner of a shop in downtown Sendai. The ball was originally modeled after the dahlia flower. In recent years, box-shaped ornaments have become popular alternatives to the ornamental ball. Since 2018, streamers inspired by the costumes of the two-time Olympic figure skating champion Yuzuru Hanyu have been on display at the Zuihōden.

==G8 summit in 2008==

In 2008, the 34th G8 summit in Tōyako, Hokkaidō coincided with Tanabata. As host, Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda invited the G8 leaders to participate in the spirit of the festival. They were each asked to write a wish on a piece of paper called &quot;tanzaku&quot;, to hang the &quot;tanzaku&quot; on a bamboo tree, and then to take the necessary actions to change the world for the better. As a symbolic gesture, the actual writing and the act of hanging up that note is at least a first step.

The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made colored strips of paper and a bamboo tree for G8 wishes available in Roppongi during the summit. Protesting organizations in Sapporo during the G8 summit also tried to use the spirit of Tanabata to focus attention on a somewhat different set of wishes. Non-governmental organizations including Oxfam and CARE International set up an online wish petition campaign to coincide with the G8 Summit and Tanabata. Outside Japan, Fukuda&#x27;s timely gesture had unanticipated consequences. For example, the Indian nationally circulated newspaper, &quot;The Hindu&quot;, picked up on this festival theme by printing an editorial featuring unconventional Tanabata wishes.

Fukuda also invited his fellow citizens to try turning off the lights in their house and stepping outside to enjoy with their family the sight of the Milky Way in the night sky. On 7 July, the Japanese Ministry of the Environment anticipated that over 70,000 facilities and households across Japan would switch off their lights from 20:00 to 22:00 as a symbolic step and as a wish for the future.

<text>Tourism in Japan is a major industry and contributor to the Japanese economy. In 2019, the sector directly contributed 11 trillion yen (US$100 billion), or 2% of the GDP, and attracted 31.88 million international tourists. In 2024, 38.6 million international tourists visited Japan.

There are 26 World Heritage Sites in Japan, including Himeji Castle, Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto and Nara. Popular attractions for foreigners include Tokyo and Osaka, Mount Fuji, Kyoto, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, ski resorts such as Niseko in Hokkaido, Okinawa, riding the Shinkansen and taking advantage of Japan&#x27;s hotel and hotspring network.

The &quot;2024&quot; &quot;Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report&quot; ranked Japan 3rd out of 141 countries overall, which was the highest in Asia. Japan gained relatively high scores in almost all of the featured aspects, such as health and hygiene, safety and security, cultural resources and business travel. 
== History ==
=== From the middle ages to early modern period ===
In medieval Japan, travel became increasingly common with cultural and aristocratic figures from Kyoto, and they initiated the genre of travel literature in Japan. Notable examples of travel literature from this period include the &quot;Tosa Nikki&quot; (935), part of the &quot;Sarashina Nikki&quot; (12th century), and the volume 4 of the &quot;Tohazugatari&quot; (1313). By the late medieval period, supported by a network of inns offering fixed-rate lodging and meals, travel was widespread. Hot springs such as Kusatsu, Arima, and Gero gained fame, attracting notable figures such as warriors and monks. Tourist souvenirs including ladles and toothpicks were popular among visitors. Pilgrimages to Mount Fuji also flourished.

During the Edo period, despite restrictions on travelling through checkpoints, guidebooks facilitated the popularisation of travel. Commoners with permits could undertake leisure trips, often disguised as pilgrimages. Inns, teahouses, and local products thrived, and travel information spread via diaries and &quot;ukiyo-e&quot; prints. Pilgrimages such as the Ise Grand Shrine’s &quot;Okage Mairi&quot; became major social phenomena, marking the beginnings of a modern tourism industry. However, foreign travel was extremely rare due to Japan&#x27;s isolation policy. Matsuo Bashō&#x27;s 1689 trip to the then &quot;far north&quot; of Japan, which inspired his famous haibun work &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot;, occurred not long after Hayashi Razan categorized the Three Views of Japan in 1643. During this time, Japan was a closed country to foreigners, so no foreign tourism existed in Japan.

=== Meiji era and international tourism ===
Japan opened its borders in the late Edo period, but due to its location in the Far East and the limited transport options, there were not many foreign visitors. Foreigners eventually gained the freedom to travel within Japan, and efforts to actively attract international tourists began on the Japanese side. In 1912, the Japan Travel Bureau (JTB) was established. Another major milestone in the development of the tourism industry in Japan was the 1907 passage of the Hotel Development Law, as a result of which the Railways Ministry began to construct publicly owned hotels throughout Japan. During the interwar period, overseas travel to distant places such as Europe and the Americas was primarily limited to businesspeople, immigrants, and students, with leisure travel being mostly reserved for the wealthy.

In terms of domestic tourism, the dismantling of the feudal system, the development of transport networks such as railways and steamships, and the spread of information made domestic travel easier. Tourism-oriented travel became increasingly popular, and regions across Japan began developing themselves for sightseeing and leisure purposes. Long-distance domestic travel became accessible. 

=== Postwar period ===
During the postwar Allied occupation period, most foreign tourists in Japan were GHQ personnel or visitors from the United States. In 1954, Konosuke Matsushita, the founder of Panasonic, contributed an article titled &quot;The Case for a Tourism-Oriented Nation&quot; to the &quot;Bungei Shunju&quot;. Matsushita argued that tourism could be considered a form of trade, and he pointed out that while exporting goods involves depleting Japan&#x27;s resources, scenic attractions such as Mount Fuji and the Seto Inland Sea remain unchanged no matter how often they are viewed. He proposed that revenue earned through inbound tourism could be reinvested in other industries, and help rebuild the country&#x27;s economy beyond its pre-war stature.

For much of post-war period, Japan has been an exceptionally unattractive tourist destination for its population and GDP size. According to the IMF, WTO, and OECD, from 1995 to 2014, it was by far the least visited country. As of 2013, Japan was one of the least visited countries in the OECD on a per capita basis. Japan avoided campaigns to attract inbound tourists, especially because its large current account surplus had caused international friction with some countries. There were also factors such as Japan being the world&#x27;s most expensive countries at the time (for example, Tokyo was rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the most expensive city in the world for 14 years in a row ending in 2006), as well as the language barrier.

==== Active promotion of inbound tourism (21st century) ====
From 2013, under the Abe administration, policies to attract international tourists were implemented to offset the shrinking domestic demand caused by population decline and ageing. As a result, by 2014, for the first time in 55 years, income from foreign tourists exceeded the amount spent by Japanese tourists abroad, which means Japan finally ran a tourism surplus. Within six years, the number of international visitors has more than tripled, reaching 31.9 million visitors in 2019. Japan received a record 36.87 million tourist arrivals in 2024, an increase of over 47% from the year prior.

== Current status ==
Domestic tourism remains a vital part of Japanese economy and Japanese culture. Across the nation, Japanese children in many middle schools see the highlight of their years as a visit to Tokyo Tower, Yomiuriland, Tokyo Disneyland, Sensō-ji, and/or Tokyo Skytree, and many high school students often visit Okinawa or Hokkaido. The extensive rail network together with domestic flights sometimes in planes with modifications to favor the relatively short distances involved in intra-Japan travel allows efficient and speedy transport. International tourism plays a smaller role in the Japanese economy compared to other developed countries; in 2013, international tourist receipts was 0.3% of Japan&#x27;s GDP, while the corresponding figure was 1.3% for the United States and 2.3% for France. In 2019, the value was up to 1.0% of GDP, driven by an increase in international tourism, while the country&#x27;s GDP has remained stable.

Tourists from South Korea have made up the largest number of inbound tourists several times in the past. In 2010, their 2.4 million arrivals made up 27% of the tourists visiting Japan. Travelers from China have been the highest spenders in Japan by country, spending an estimated 196.4 billion yen (US$2.4 billion) in 2011, or almost a quarter of total expenditure by foreign visitors, according to data from the Japan Tourism Agency. From 2016 to 2020, Japanese government hoped to receive 40 million foreign tourists every year by 2020. According to the Japan National Tourism Organization in 2017, 3 out of 4 foreign tourists came from other parts of East Asia, namely South Korea, mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Japanese film, TV, video game, and manga/anime industries play a role in driving tourism to Japan. In surveys held by Statista between 2019 and 2020, 24.2% of tourists from the United States, said they were motivated to visit Japan because of Japanese popular culture.

=== Overtourism ===
Following the easing of COVID-19-era travel restrictions, 2024 is on track to be a record-breaking year for the number of overseas tourists. This tourism boom can be attributed in part to the weakening Japanese yen. The unprecedented number of foreign tourists has led to claims that some parts of Japan are suffering from overtourism.

In response to this surge, officials in some parts of Japan have introduced measures to counter its negative effects. For example, Yamanashi Prefecture has set a cap of daily climbers of Mount Fuji at 4,000 people and began charging an entrance fee of ¥2,000. Also in Yamanashi Prefecture, a mesh barrier was set up to block a view of Mount Fuji behind a Lawson convenience store in Fujikawaguchiko due to tourist-caused disturbances in the area.

As of 2024, some Japanese officials have considered instituting a two-tiered pricing system which would have foreign tourists pay more than residents at certain tourist attractions in order to counter the effects of overtourism.

<doc id="147793" wikidata="Q101751" url="?curid=147793" title="1994 FIFA World Cup">
<text>The 1994 FIFA World Cup was the 15th FIFA World Cup, the world championship for men&#x27;s national soccer teams. It was hosted by the United States and took place from June 17 to July 17, 1994, at nine venues across the country. The United States was chosen as the host by FIFA on July 4, 1988. Despite soccer&#x27;s relative lack of popularity in the host nation, the tournament was the most financially successful in World Cup history. It broke tournament records with overall attendance of 3,587,538 and an average of 68,991 per game, figures that stand unsurpassed as of 2022, despite the expansion of the competition from 24 to 32 teams starting with the 1998 World Cup.

Brazil was crowned the winner after defeating Italy 3–2 in a penalty shootout at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, near Los Angeles, after the game had ended 0–0 after extra time. It was the first World Cup final to be decided on penalties. The victory made Brazil the first nation to win four World Cup titles. There were three new entrants in the tournament: Greece, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia; Russia also appeared as a separate nation for the first time, following the breakup of the Soviet Union, and for the first time since 1938, a unified Germany took part in the tournament. It was also the defending champion, but was eliminated in the quarterfinals by Bulgaria. It was the first World Cup where three points were awarded for a victory instead of two and also the first with the back-pass rule. This was done to encourage a more attacking style of soccer as a response to the criticism of the defensive tactics and low-scoring matches of the 1990 World Cup. This resulted in an average of 2.71 goals per match, compared to 2.21 in 1990.

==Background and preparations==
===Bidding process===
Three nations bid to host the event: United States, Brazil, and Morocco. The vote was held in Zurich on July 4, 1988 (Independence Day in the United States), and only took one round with the United States bid receiving a little over half of the votes by the FIFA Executive Committee members. FIFA hoped that by staging the world&#x27;s most prestigious tournament there, it would lead to a growth of interest in the sport.

An inspection committee also found that the proposed Brazilian stadiums were deficient, while the Moroccan bid relied on the construction of nine new stadiums. Conversely, all the proposed stadiums in the United States were already built and fully functioning; U.S. Soccer spent $500 million preparing and organizing the tournament, far less than the billions other countries previously had spent and subsequently would spend on preparing for this tournament. The U.S. bid was seen as the favorite and was prepared in response to losing the right to be the replacement host for the 1986 tournament following Colombia&#x27;s withdrawal.

One condition FIFA imposed was the creation of a professional soccer league – Major League Soccer was founded in 1993 and began operating in 1996. There was some initial controversy about awarding the World Cup to a country where soccer was not a nationally popular sport, and at the time, in 1988, the U.S. no longer had a professional league; the North American Soccer League, established in 1967, had folded in 1984 after attendance faded. The success of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, particularly the soccer tournament that drew 1.4 million spectators throughout the event, also contributed to FIFA&#x27;s decision.

The United States had previously bid to host the 1986 FIFA World Cup, after Colombia withdrew as the host nation in November 1982 because of economic concerns. Despite a presentation led by former North American Soccer League players Pelé and Franz Beckenbauer, as well as former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, the executive committee selected Mexico. There were proposals by FIFA to introduce larger goals and breaks after every quarter instead of just at halftime in order to appease U.S. television advertisers. These proposals were met with resistance, and ultimately rejected.

==Venues==
The games were played in nine cities across the contiguous United States. All stadiums had a capacity of at least 53,000 and were occupied by professional or college American football teams.

Other host city candidates included Atlanta, Denver, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Miami, Minneapolis, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Seattle, and Tampa, as well as smaller communities such as Annapolis, Maryland; Columbus, Ohio; Corvallis, Oregon; and New Haven, Connecticut. Some sites, including Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami and Candlestick Park in San Francisco, were rejected because of conflicts with Major League Baseball. Stanford Stadium, southeast of San Francisco, and the Citrus Bowl in Orlando, Florida, were picked (the Miami Orange Bowl, another Miami venue, required major renovations to meet tournament standards).

The Rose Bowl hosted the most matches with eight, four of them in the knockout stage, including the final. Giants Stadium hosted seven games including a semifinal; Foxborough Stadium, Stanford Stadium, and the Cotton Bowl hosted six games each, and Soldier Field, Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, and the Citrus Bowl hosted five games each. Pontiac Silverdome, the first indoor stadium used in a World Cup, hosted the least number of matches, four group-stage games. The Silverdome was also the only venue of the nine used that did not host knockout round games.

Aside from the oceanic coolness of Boston (Foxborough), the Mediterranean climate of San Francisco (Stanford), and occasionally the coolness of Chicago, as they had been in Mexico in 1970 and 1986 most matches were played in hot and/or humid conditions, thanks to nearly all of the games being scheduled to be played during the day. Although playing in the mostly dry heat and smoggy conditions of Los Angeles (Pasadena) and the mixture of heat and humidity of Washington and New Jersey sometimes proved to be difficult, the cities with the most consistently oppressive conditions were Orlando and Dallas in the South, because of the combination of heat and extreme humidity. The Floridian tropical climate of Orlando meant all games there were played in temperatures of or above with dew points above 70 or more (the temperature there during the group stage game between Mexico and Ireland was ) due to the mid-day start times. Dallas was not much different: in the humid heat of a Texas summer, temperatures exceeded during mid-day, when games there were staged in the open-type Cotton Bowl meant that conditions were just as oppressive there as they were in Orlando. Detroit also proved to be difficult: the Pontiac Silverdome did not have a working cooling system and because it was an air-supported stadium, the air could not escape through circulation, so temperatures inside the stadium would climb past with 40% humidity. United States midfielder Thomas Dooley described the Silverdome as &quot;the worst place I have ever played at&quot;.

Since the tournament, Pontiac Silverdome, Giants Stadium, and Foxboro Stadium have been demolished, and RFK Stadium is slated for demolition beginning in January 2025. Stanford Stadium, the Cotton Bowl, the Citrus Bowl (now Camping World Stadium), and Soldier Field have all been moderately or heavily modified. The Rose Bowl is the only largely unmodified stadium used for this tournament.

==Participating teams and officials==

===Qualification===
Three teams—one African, one Asian, and one European—made their debuts at the 1994 tournament. Nigeria qualified from the African zone alongside Cameroon and Morocco as CAF was granted three spots as a result of the strong performances by African teams in 1986 and 1990. In the Asian zone, Saudi Arabia qualified for the first time by topping the final round group ahead of South Korea as both edged out Japan, which was close to making its own World Cup debut, but was denied by Iraq in what became known as the &quot;Agony of Doha&quot;. In the European zone, Greece made its first World Cup appearance after topping a group from which Russia also qualified, competing independently for the first time after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

The defending champion, West Germany, was united with its East German counterpart, representing the unified Germany for the first time since the 1938 World Cup. Norway qualified for the first time since 1938, Bolivia for the first time since 1950 (and the last time as of 2022), and Switzerland for the first time since 1966. Norway&#x27;s 56-year gap between appearances in the final tournament equaled Egypt&#x27;s record in the previous tournament as the longest. This record was later broken when Wales qualified for the 2022 tournament after a 64-year absence. Mexico had its first successful qualification campaign since 1978, failing to qualify in 1982, qualifying as host in 1986, and being banned for the Cachirules scandal in 1990.

The qualification campaigns of both Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia were affected by political events. The nation of Czechoslovakia dissolved in 1993, completing its qualifying group under the name &quot;Representation of Czechs and Slovaks&quot; (RCS), but failed to qualify for the finals, having been edged out by Romania and Belgium in Group 4. Yugoslavia (which was supposed to play in Group 5) was suspended from international competition in 1992 as part of United Nations sanctions against the country as a result of the Yugoslav Wars. The sanctions were not lifted until 1994, by which time it was no longer possible for the team to qualify. Chile&#x27;s suspension from the 1990 FIFA World Cup, following the forced interruption of its qualification game against Brazil, extended to the 1994 qualifiers as well.

This was the first World Cup since World War II in which none of the UK Home Nations of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales qualified (they withdrew their FIFA memberships between 1928 and 1946, during the first three tournaments), with England (finishing third behind Norway and Netherlands in Group 2) missing out after having finished fourth in the 1990 tournament, and Scotland (who finished fourth in Group 1) failing to qualify for the first time since 1970. France, which had been already designated as host of the 1998 tournament, also missed out following surprise home losses to Israel and Bulgaria. This was the second World Cup in a row for which France had failed to qualify, and the last one to date not to feature England, France, and Japan. Other notable absentees were 1986 and 1990 Round of 16 participants Uruguay, UEFA 
Euro 1992 champions Denmark, Poland, Portugal, and Hungary.

==Draw==
===Seeding and drawing===
The FIFA Organizing Committee upheld the tradition to seed the host (United States) and defending champion (Germany), along with the other four teams ranked in the top five based on their results obtained in the last three FIFA World Cups. The newly introduced FIFA World Ranking was not used as part of the calculated ranking for the seeding in this World Cup, as FIFA considered it to be too new. Despite that it was not used in any way, for comparison purposes the teams&#x27; pre-tournament FIFA World ranking position from June 1994 are shown in parentheses, followed by the official and used ranking (OR) position determined by the results obtained in the last three world cups.

The six top-seeded teams, were allocated in pot 1 and would be drawn into the first position of the six groups playing in the group stage. The remaining 18 teams were allocated into three pots based on geographical sections, with the: six qualified teams from Africa and Americas in pot 2, the top-6 ranked European teams in pot 3, while pot 4 comprised the 7th-10th best qualified European teams along with the two qualified Asian teams.

The principle of the draw was that each of the six drawn groups would have one team drawn respectively from pot 1, 2, 3 and 4; while respecting the following geographical limitations:
# At least two European teams from UEFA in all groups, with one group having three European teams.
# United States and Mexico could not be drawn in the same group, because only one CONCACAF team per group.
# Brazil and Argentina could not be drawn with another South American team, because only one CONMEBOL team per group.
# As all qualified Asian teams from AFC were in pot 4, and all qualified African teams from CAF in pot 2, this automatically ensured only allowing maximum one Asian team and maximum one African team per group, as part of the normal draw procedure - without needing to observe special restricting sub-rules for them.
* The draw took place at the Las Vegas Convention Center and was televised live on December 19, 1993, on ESPN in the United States &amp; Eurosport in all Europe with English language commentary on the latter channel by Scottish sportscaster Archie Macpherson. The draw presenters were Dick Clark and Faye Dunaway.

Ahead of the draw, the FIFA Organizing Committee had decided to allocate the top-seeded first group position A1 for the United States as the host, C1 for defending champion Germany, and E1 for the Italian team, which had requested to play most of its group matches at Giants Stadium in New York. The three other top-seeded teams would be located at the first position of either group B/D/F, with the decision largely depending on the identity of the other drawn group members for the seeded teams. Therefore, this last decision would only be made by a secret vote made by the FIFA Organizing Committee a few minutes after all teams had been drawn for all groups, and the decision would only be announced as the last step of the televised draw event. To make this procedure possible, the six drawn groups would during the draw be given the colors green, orange, white, black, pink and blue; and the closing remarks at the event would then reveal the group letters represented by the colors. The six groups from A to F would play their group matches in the following nine cities:
* Group A and B played in Detroit, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.
* Group C and D played in Chicago, Dallas, and Boston.
* Group E and F played in New York, Washington DC, and Orlando.

Procedure for the draw:
# Pot 1 was used to draw the six top-seeded teams into the first position of the six groups designated by the colors green, orange, white, black, pink and blue. Group letters behind each color would only be decided by a following secret FIFA Organizing Committee vote and only be revealed after the draw had been completed, although the committee had already predetermined ahead of the draw that (1) the United States should play in group A, (2) Germany should play in group C, and (3) Italy should play in group E.
# Pot 2 was used to draw one team to each of the six colored groups, with the draw conducted in the color order from left to right (green, orange, white, black, pink, blue); while this order however at the same time had to respect the following restricted geographical rules:
#* Rule 1: First two drawn non South American teams shall irrespectively of the color order, first be drawn into the two groups led by a South American team, in order to avoid the possibility for these groups later to be drawn by a second South American team.
#* Rule 2: First drawn South American team or one of the last two African teams shall irrespectively of the color order, first be drawn into the group led by the CONCACAF team, the United States, in order to avoid the possibility for this group later to be drawn by the second CONCACAF team Mexico.
#* Rule 3: One of the two South American teams or one of the last two African teams shall irrespectively of the color order, first be drawn into the first available open group being led by a European team, in order to avoid the meeting of two South American teams in the same group.
#* Rule 4: Mexico can not be drawn together with the United States as they are both CONCACAF teams, so Mexico will be grouped with the first still open available group being led by a European or South American team, as per the color order.
# Pot 3 was used to draw one European team to each of the six colored groups, with the draw conducted in the color order from left to right (green, orange, white, black, pink, blue).
# Pot 4 was used to draw one European/Asian team to each of six colored groups, with the draw conducted in the color order from left to right (green, orange, white, black, pink, blue). However, in order to respect the geographical rule that five of the groups shall have two European teams - and the rule that three European teams is only allowed in one group, the color order will be skipped subject to these allocation rules:
#* Rule 1: All drawn Asian (AFC) teams would not be drawn into any of the three groups led by a top-seeded CONCACAF/CONMEBOL team (United States/Brazil/Argentina), but would instead only be allowed to join a group being led by a top-seeded European team.
#* Rule 2: All drawn European (UEFA) teams, shall first be drawn into the three groups led by a top-seeded CONCACAF/CONMEBOL team (United States/Brazil/Argentina), until the point of time when only European team(s) remain to be drawn from the last pot 4.
# The exact group position number for the teams (2, 3 or 4) in each colored group, were also drawn immediately from six special group bowls, after each respective team had been drawn from pot 2, 3 and 4.
# Group letters behind each color (green, orange, white, black, pink and blue) would finally be decided by a final secret FIFA Organizing Committee vote, being announced as the last part of the televised event.

The draw was officiated by FIFA general-secretary Joseph Blatter. Teams were drawn by former and at the time football players such as Eusébio, Tony Meola, Bobby Charlton, Roger Milla, Michel Platini, and Marco van Basten; actor Beau Bridges; Women&#x27;s World Cup champion Michelle Akers; model Carol Alt; artist Peter Max; racecar driver Mario Andretti; and Olympic gold medalist in gymnastics Mary Lou Retton. Numbers for placement in the group were drawn by German legend Franz Beckenbauer, heavyweight boxing champion Evander Holyfield, and comedian and actor Robin Williams.

===Results of the draw===

In each group, the teams played three games, one against each of the other teams. After completion of the group stage, the best two teams in each group, as well as the four best-ranked third-place teams, advanced to the round of 16 in the knockout stage. This format was identical to the tournament structure used in 1986 and 1990 except that a win now earned three points instead of two, to encourage more attacking play.

==Summary==

The format of the competition stayed the same as in the 1990 World Cup: 24 teams qualified, divided into six groups of four. Sixteen teams would qualify for the knockout phase: the six group winners, the six group runners-up, and the four third-placed teams with the best records. This was the last time this format was used, due to the expansion of the finals tournament in 1998 to 32 teams. FIFA introduced three rule changes for this tournament to encourage attacking play: three points awarded for a win in a group stage match instead of two, a relaxed offside rule and a ban on picking up back-passes to goalkeepers. The number of goals increased to 2.73 per game from the record-low of 2.21 in 1990.

The tournament saw the end of Diego Maradona&#x27;s World Cup career, having played in the 1982, 1986, and 1990 World Cups, and leading Argentina to the 1986 World Cup title and the final of the 1990 World Cup. Maradona was expelled from the tournament by FIFA after he failed a drug test that uncovered ephedrine, a weight-loss drug, in his blood. Colombia, despite high expectations due to their style and impressive qualifying campaign, failed to advance from the round robin. The team was dogged by influence from betting syndicates and drug cartels, with coach Francisco Maturana receiving death threats over squad selection. After scoring an own goal for the United States and effectively eliminating Colombia from the competition, defender Andrés Escobar was shot to death on his return to Colombia outside a bar in a Medellín suburb 10 days later, possibly in retaliation for his mistake.

Bulgaria was one of the biggest surprises of the tournament. The Bulgarians had never won a game in five previous World Cup appearances, but, led by Hristo Stoichkov, who would eventually share the tournament lead in scoring, they presented a formidable challenge for the title. The team won two of their three group games to qualify for the second round, where they advanced after a 3–1 penalty shootout win over Mexico. They then faced reigning world champions Germany in the quarterfinals, where goals from Stoichkov and Letchkov gave them a 2–1 victory. Bulgaria went on to finish in fourth place after losing to Italy in the semifinals and Sweden in the third-place game.

The host nation United States, after a 23rd-place finish in the 1990 tournament, advanced to the second round as one of the best third-place teams. They were eliminated in the Round of 16 in a 1–0 defeat to Brazil on Independence Day.

Brazil&#x27;s win over the hosts helped take them to the final against Italy. Brazil&#x27;s path was relatively smooth as they never trailed over 270 minutes of the knockout stage, defeating the Netherlands in the quarterfinals and Sweden in the semis after the aforementioned win over the hosts. The Italians meanwhile had made hard work of reaching the final. During the group stage, Italy struggled and narrowly advanced to the next round, despite losing 1–0 to the Republic of Ireland. Italian playmaker Roberto Baggio, who as the reigning FIFA World Player of the Year and Ballon D&#x27;Or holder, was expected to be one of the stars of the tournament, had not yet scored a goal. During the Round of 16 games against Nigeria, Italy was trailing 1–0 in the dying minutes when Baggio scored the tying goal, forcing the game into extra time. He scored again with a penalty kick to send Italy through. Baggio carried the Italians from there, scoring the game-winning goal in the quarterfinal against Spain, and both goals in Italy&#x27;s semifinal victory over Bulgaria.

The third-place playoff was set between Bulgaria and Sweden, the team which scored more goals than any other in this World Cup with 15 over seven matches. These teams had also previously met in the qualifying group. Sweden won, 4–0. Swedish forward Tomas Brolin was named to the All-star team.

The final game at the Rose Bowl was tense but devoid of scoring chances. It was the second time in 24 years that the two nations had met in a final. After 120 goalless minutes, the World Cup was decided for the first time by a penalty shootout. After four rounds, Brazil led 3–2, and Baggio, playing injured, had to score to keep Italy&#x27;s hopes alive. He missed by shooting it over the crossbar, and the Brazilians were crowned champions for the fourth time. After the game ended, Vice President Al Gore hosted the awarding ceremony by handing Brazilian captain Dunga the prestigious trophy; the Brazil national team dedicated the title to the deceased Formula One motor racing champion and countryman Ayrton Senna, who had died two and a half months prior.

The tournament&#x27;s Golden Boot went jointly to Bulgaria&#x27;s Stoichkov and Oleg Salenko of Russia, the latter becoming the first player to score five goals in a game, coming in a 6–1 victory against Cameroon. Both players scored six goals in the tournament. Brazilian striker Romário, with five goals, won the Golden Ball as the tournament&#x27;s best player.

Despite the controversy, the U.S. staged a hugely successful tournament, with an average attendance of nearly 70,000, surpassing the 1966 FIFA World Cup average attendance of 51,000, thanks to the large seating capacities of the stadiums in the United States in comparison to the generally smaller venues of Europe and Latin America. To this day, the total attendance for the final tournament of nearly 3.6 million remains the highest in World Cup history, despite the expansion of the competition from 24 to 32 teams at the 1998 World Cup in France.

===Opening ceremony===

The opening ceremony of the World Cup was held on June 17 at Chicago&#x27;s Soldier Field. The ceremony was emceed by Oprah Winfrey, who introduced Diana Ross: she gave a musical performance. Ross was also intended to score a penalty at the beginning of her performance, with the goal then splitting in two as part of a pre-orchestrated stunt. Instead, she kicked the ball wide to the left, missing the goal, but the goalposts collapsed anyway in accordance with the stunt plans. In addition, Daryl Hall and Jon Secada also gave musical performances. It was officially opened by then-President Bill Clinton.

==Group stage==
&quot;Times are Eastern Daylight Time (UTC−4) (East Rutherford, Foxborough, Orlando, Pontiac and Washington), Central Daylight Time (UTC−5) (Chicago and Dallas), and Pacific Daylight Time (UTC−7) (Pasadena and Stanford).&quot;
In the following tables:
*Pld = total games played
*W = total games won
*D = total games drawn (tied)
*L = total games lost
*GF = total goals scored (goals for)
*GA = total goals conceded (goals against)
*GD = goal difference (GF−GA)
*Pts = total points accumulated

===Group A===
The Group A game between the United States and Switzerland was the first to take place indoors, played under the roof at the Pontiac Silverdome.

Following the tournament, Colombian defender Andrés Escobar was shot dead on his return to Colombia, possibly in retaliation, after his own goal had contributed to his country&#x27;s elimination.

Victories against Colombia and the United States (in front of a crowd of 93,869) were enough to see Romania through as group winners, despite a 4–1 hammering by Switzerland in between. The magnitude of that victory allowed Switzerland to move ahead of the United States on goal difference, although the hosts qualified for the second round as one of the best third-placed teams.

Switzerland&#x27;s 4–1 victory over Romania came nearly 40 years to the date of Switzerland&#x27;s last World Cup victory, also a 4–1 victory, on that occasion over Italy. The United States&#x27; 2–1 victory over Colombia was its first World Cup victory since June 29, 1950, when it upset England 1–0 in the 1950 World Cup.

===Group B===
Group B produced two of the four semifinalists of this World Cup — Brazil and Sweden — and was also one of the two groups in which only two, rather than three, sides progressed to the second round. The match between the two eliminated teams, Cameroon and Russia, broke two World Cup records. Oleg Salenko of Russia became the first – and remains the only – man to score five goals in a single World Cup game as Russia won 6–1. The goals also ensured that Salenko finished the tournament joint-top scorer with six goals, having previously bagged one against Sweden. Cameroon left a mark too as Roger Milla, at the age of 42, became the oldest World Cup goalscorer of all time, as he grabbed his side&#x27;s consolation goal in the game. The result was not enough to take Russia through following losses to Brazil and Sweden. Brazil beat Cameroon, and then confirmed the top spot with a draw to Sweden.

The Swedes also progressed, finishing in second place with five points. Sweden&#x27;s 3–1 victory over Russia was the nation&#x27;s first World Cup victory since July 3, 1974. Russia failed to progress to the second round for the second time (accounting for the Soviet Union&#x27;s results four years before), while Cameroon failed to repeat their surprise performance from the previous tournament.

----

----

===Group C===
As was the case with Group B, Group C would only send two teams into the Round of 16 as Spain and defending champions Germany progressed to round two. Coming from two goals down with four minutes left to snatch a 2–2 draw against Spain, the South Koreans very nearly eclipsed that feat against Germany when they came from 3–0 down to lose narrowly 3–2. In spite of these comebacks, South Korea was held to a 0–0 draw against Bolivia in their other group game when a win would have seen them through. Spain&#x27;s late implosion against the South Koreans effectively decided that it would be Germany who won the group and not them.

Germany, who defeated Bolivia 1–0 in the tournament&#x27;s opening game, finished with seven points. Spain had to settle for second place despite leading in all three games.

Despite Bolivia finishing last in the group, Erwin Sanchez made team history after scoring the nation&#x27;s first World Cup goal in a 3–1 loss to Spain. Prior to 1994, Bolivia had never scored in either of their previous appearances at the 1930 and 1950 World Cups.

----

----

===Group D===

Tournament favorites Argentina led by Diego Maradona collected a maximum of six points from their opening two games after dominating Greece 4–0 in Foxboro with a Gabriel Batistuta hattrick before winning a close match against a formidable Nigeria with a 2–1 victory on the same field four days later; despite this Argentina finished third in the group. Nigeria had been very impressive on their World Cup debut, and despite the narrow loss to Argentina, had emerged as group winners following victories against Bulgaria and Greece, the latter in which Nigeria doubled its lead late on a goal from Daniel Amokachi – a goal that would allow Nigeria to top its group. Maradona only played with Argentina during their first two games, both in Foxborough (playing Greece and Nigeria and scoring his last ever World Cup goal against the former); he was thrown out of the tournament after testing positive for ephedrine.

Having qualified for the tournament through a last-gasp goal against France, Bulgaria surprised many people, as the nation had never even won a game at the World Cup finals prior to this tournament. Despite losing its opening game 3–0 to Nigeria, Bulgaria came back in style with a 4–0 win over neighbor Greece (who had suffered exactly the same fate five days earlier against Argentina), and a 2–0 win against Argentina saw them advance. Argentina had actually been winning the group going into injury time, while Bulgaria played the last 25 minutes with 10 men; however, a 91st-minute header from Nasko Sirakov meant that Argentina dropped two places and finished third. Nigeria won the group on goal difference. Bulgaria&#x27;s victory over Argentina earned them second place.

----

----

===Group E===

Group E remains the only group in World Cup history in which all four teams finished with the same points. All four teams even had the same goal difference. It began at Giants Stadium where Ray Houghton&#x27;s chip ensured a shock Irish victory over the then-three-time champions Italy by 1–0, as well as gaining a measure of revenge for the previous World Cup, in which Italy both hosted and eliminated Ireland at the quarterfinal stage. The next day in Washington, Norway played its first World Cup game since 1938 and Kjetil Rekdal&#x27;s goal five minutes from time proved decisive in an equally tense encounter as Norway beat Mexico.

In the second round of group play, Luis García&#x27;s double had Mexico 2–0 up and in control of the game before a disagreement on the touchline resulted in fines for both Republic of Ireland&#x27;s manager, Jack Charlton, and their striker John Aldridge. Aldridge was able to regain concentration in time to score six minutes from the end of the game to make it 2–1. Despite their loss, Aldridge&#x27;s goal proved crucial to Ireland in the final group standings.

During the previous day at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, Italy&#x27;s World Cup hopes seemed to be diminishing fast as goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca was sent off with the game still at 0–0. Yet despite this, Italy was still able to salvage an important 1–0 victory. Norway would ultimately pay a price for their inability to take advantage of Pagliuca&#x27;s dismissal. With the four teams level on points, the final two group games would each have to finish as draws for things to stay that way. Republic of Ireland made it through after a dreary 0–0 draw with Norway; while Massaro and Bernal traded strikes as Italy and Mexico played to a 1–1 draw.

Those results meant that Mexico won the group on goals scored, with three in the group. With Ireland and Italy also progressing having finished with identical records, the Irish team qualified as second place as a result of their victory against the Italians. Norway&#x27;s shortcomings in attack ultimately let them down, and they exited the tournament with only one goal.

----

----

===Group F===
Just as happened to Argentina in Group D, Belgium endured the same fate in Group F. Despite winning both of its first two matches 1–0 against Morocco and neighbors Netherlands, Belgium finished third as, in an upset, it lost to tournament newcomers Saudi Arabia 1–0 in the third game. During that game, Saudi player Saaed Al-Owairan ran from his own half through a maze of Belgian players to score the game&#x27;s only goal.

Saudi Arabia advanced through to the Round of 16 as well, having also defeated Morocco 2–1. The Netherlands endured a somewhat nervier experience. The opening 2–1 victory against Saudi Arabia was followed by the 1–0 loss against Belgium before another 2–1 victory against Morocco, with Bryan Roy scoring the winner a mere 12 minutes from time, saw the Dutch win the group having scored more goals than Belgium and beaten Saudi Arabia. Morocco, despite losing all three of their group games, did not leave without a fight, as each of their losses were by just a single goal, 1–0 to Belgium, 2–1 to Saudi Arabia, and 2–1 to the Netherlands.

==Symbols==
===Mascot===

The official mascot of this World Cup was &quot;Striker, the World Cup Pup&quot;, a dog wearing a red, white and blue soccer uniform with a ball. Striker was designed by the Warner Bros. animation team. A dog was picked as the mascot because dogs are a popular domestic pet in the United States.

===Match ball===

The official match ball was &quot;Questra&quot;, manufactured by Adidas. Following the convention of the addition of decorations to the established Adidas Tango style since the Azteca and the Etrusco Unico, this one featured space-themed decorations, not only due to its name, but that 1994 marked the 25th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission in which the first Moon landing took place, which is considered to be one of the most important moments in the history of the host country and the world.

===Music===

The official song was &quot;Gloryland&quot;.

==Aftermath and legacy==

* Although USA &#x27;94 marked the seventh time FIFA hosted the World Cup in the Americas (after being held in Uruguay, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and twice by Mexico in 1970 and 1986), the United States became the first host in the Americas outside of the Latin American spectrum, and the first in the Anglosphere outside of England.
* The game between the United States and Switzerland at the Pontiac Silverdome on June 18 was the first to be played indoors in World Cup history: grass was grown by Michigan State University and was the first time since 1965 (the failed attempt at the Astrodome) that natural turf was used in an indoor stadium in the United States. To date, only Sapporo Dome in 2002 and Arena AufSchalke in 2006 have subsequently hosted indoor games in World Cup history.
* Oleg Salenko of Russia became the first player to score five goals in a single World Cup finals game in his country&#x27;s group stage win over Cameroon. Cameroon&#x27;s Roger Milla also scored a goal in the same game, becoming the oldest player to score a goal in a World Cup. At 42, he was also the oldest player to appear in a World Cup, a record held until 2014, when Faryd Mondragón (43 years, 3 days) of Colombia broke the record in their game against Japan at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In turn, goalkeeper Essam El Hadary (45 years, 161 days) of Egypt would surpass Mondragón against Saudi Arabia, in the Volgograd Arena, Volgograd, Russia, on June 25, 2018. However, Milla remains the oldest outfield player to perform in the World Cup.
* For the first time, during the entering of the players onto the field, the FIFA Anthem, composed by Franz Lambert, was played.
* Gianluca Pagliuca of Italy became the first goalkeeper to be sent off in a World Cup game, dismissed for handling outside his area against Norway.
* Brazil&#x27;s eleven goals in their seven games was a record for the lowest average goals scored per game for any World Cup-winning side, but this record was broken by Spain&#x27;s eight goals in 2010. The three goals Brazil conceded in those seven games was at the time also the lowest average goals conceded per game, although this was subsequently surpassed by France in 1998, Italy in 2006, and Spain in 2010.
* The finals were the first time FIFA decided to experiment with the style of jerseys worn by officials, forgoing the traditional black. They could choose between burgundy, yellow or silver shirts depending on what was necessary to avoid a clash of colors with the two competing teams. This custom has since been followed, but with black shirts added as an option later.
* The finals were also the first time that players had their shirt numbers printed on the center front (or on the right or left breast, in Morocco&#x27;s and Russia&#x27;s case respectively) of the shirt, as well as their names printed on the back of their jerseys in a World Cup, just as other American sports did, to make their identification easier for sportscasters. This custom followed from Euro 92, and has continued ever since (although numbers printed on the center front had been experimented during the 1991 FIFA U-20 World Cup held in Portugal).
* The finals were the first to award 3 points for a win in the group stage to motivate teams to play an attacking style.
* In disciplinary matters, for the first time yellow cards accumulated in the group stage were wiped clean after its completion, and players started with a clean slate at the start of the knockout stage. Previously, players were suspended for one game if accumulating two yellow cards throughout the tournament. Now, players were suspended for one game after accumulating two yellow cards in the group stage, or two yellow cards in the knockout stage. This was in response to the situation in 1990, where players such as Claudio Caniggia and Paul Gascoigne were suspended for the later games.
* The 1994 World Cup revolutionized television coverage of sports in the United States and then worldwide through the sponsored scoreboard and game clock that were constantly shown on screen throughout the game. Being fully privately-funded, television sports coverage in the United States had long relied upon commercial breaks, a feature suitable for sports such as baseball, basketball, ice hockey, and American football (which all have breaks in the action), but long considered incompatible with soccer, due to the long stretches of uninterrupted play. Led by Fox Sports, which debuted its NFL coverage about a month following the completion of the World Cup, virtually every television network included their version of the scoreboard clock by the decade&#x27;s end.
* The 1994 World Cup final was the first (and to date only) goalless final in World Cup history. It was also the first to be decided by a penalty shootout, followed by the 2006 and 2022 finals.
* This was the last World Cup in which games other than the last two in each group were played simultaneously, although this only happened once in this tournament: Saudi Arabia vs. Morocco and Belgium vs. Netherlands in Group F. From France &#x27;98 onwards, each game in the first two rounds of group play and the whole knockout stage have been played separately to maximize television audiences.
* This was the last World Cup featuring 24 nations, and the last in which third-placed teams were still able to progress to the round of 16. From 1998 on, there were 32 nations, with only the top two in each group progressing.
* This was the first and the last World Cup in which both teams taking part in the third-place game, Sweden and Bulgaria, received bronze medals from FIFA, although only the winner was credited with finishing third.
