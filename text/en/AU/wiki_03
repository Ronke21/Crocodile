<text>Pope Benedict XV (Latin: &quot;Benedictus XV&quot;; ), born Giacomo Paolo Giovanni Battista della Chiesa (; 21 November 1854 – 22 January 1922), was head of the Catholic Church from 1914 until his death in 1922. His pontificate was largely overshadowed by World War I and its political, social, and humanitarian consequences in Europe.

Between 1846 and 1903, the Catholic Church had experienced two of its longest pontificates in history up to that point. Together Pius IX and Leo XIII ruled for a total of 57 years. In 1914, the College of Cardinals chose della Chiesa at the relatively young age of 59 at the outbreak of World War I, which he labeled &quot;the suicide of civilized Europe&quot;. The war and its consequences were the main focus of Benedict XV. He immediately declared the neutrality of the Holy See and attempted from that perspective to mediate peace in 1916 and 1917. Both sides rejected his initiatives. German Protestants rejected any &quot;Papal Peace&quot; as insulting. The French politician Georges Clemenceau regarded the Vatican initiative as being anti-French. Having failed with diplomatic initiatives, Benedict XV focused on humanitarian efforts to lessen the impacts of the war, such as attending prisoners of war, the exchange of wounded soldiers and food deliveries to needy populations in Europe. After the war, he repaired the difficult relations with France, which re-established relations with the Vatican in 1921. During his pontificate, relations with Italy improved as well, as Benedict XV now permitted Catholic politicians led by Don Luigi Sturzo to participate in national Italian politics.

In 1917, Benedict XV promulgated the Code of Canon Law, which was released on 27 May, the creation of which he had prepared with Eugenio Pacelli (the future Pope Pius XII) and Pietro Gasparri during the pontificate of Pope Pius X. The new Code of Canon Law is considered to have stimulated religious life and activities throughout the Church. He named Gasparri to be his Cardinal Secretary of State and personally consecrated Nuncio Pacelli on 13 May 1917 as Archbishop. World War I caused great damage to Catholic missions throughout the world. Benedict XV revitalized these activities, asking in &quot;Maximum illud&quot; for Catholics throughout the world to participate. For that, he has been referred to as the &quot;Pope of Missions&quot;. His last concern was the emerging persecution of the Catholic Church in Soviet Russia and the famine there after the revolution. Benedict XV was devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary and authorized the Feast of Mary, Mediatrix of all Graces.

After seven years in office, Pope Benedict XV died on 22 January 1922 after battling pneumonia since the start of that month. He was buried in the grottoes of Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica. With his diplomatic skills and his openness towards modern society, &quot;he gained respect for himself and the papacy.&quot;

== Early life ==
Giacomo della Chiesa was born prematurely at Pegli, a suburb of Genoa, Italy, the third son and sixth child of Marchese Giuseppe della Chiesa (1821–1892) and his wife Marchesa Giovanna Filippa Vittoria Maria Migliorati (1827–1904). Genealogy findings report that his father&#x27;s side produced Pope Callixtus II and also claimed descent from Berengar II of Italy and that his maternal family produced Pope Innocent VII. He was also a descendant of Blessed Antonio della Chiesa. His sister, Giulia della Chiesa (1850 - ?) married in 1876 Faustino Persico. His brother, Giovanni Antonio della Chiesa (1853 - 1920), married Eugenia Jacobini (1863 - 1918), the niece of Cardinal Angelo Jacobini, and had issue. Due to his premature birth, Giacomo was left with a limp and completed much of his early education at home. His other brother Johann Anton was an admiral in the Italian navy.

His wish to become a priest was rejected early on by his father, who insisted on a legal career for his son. At age 21 he acquired a doctorate in Law on 2 August 1875. He had attended the University of Genoa, which after the unification of Italy was largely dominated by anti-Catholic and anti-clerical politics. With his doctorate in Law and at legal age, he again asked his father for permission to study for the priesthood, which was now reluctantly granted. He insisted, however, that his son conduct his theological studies in Rome, not in Genoa, so that he would not end up as a village priest or provincial monsignore.

Della Chiesa entered the Almo Collegio Capranica and was there in Rome when, in 1878, Pope Pius IX died and was followed by Pope Leo XIII. The new pope received the students of the Capranica in private audience only a few days after his coronation. Shortly thereafter, della Chiesa was ordained a priest by Cardinal Raffaele Monaco La Valletta on 21 December 1878 at the Lateran basilica.

From 1878 until 1883 he studied at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy in Rome. It was there, on every Thursday, that students were required to defend a research paper, to which cardinals and high members of the Roman Curia were invited. Mariano Rampolla, then Secretary for Oriental Affairs of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, took note of him and furthered his entry in the diplomatic service of the Vatican in 1882, where he was employed by Rampolla as a secretary and in January 1883 accompanied nuncio Rampolla to Madrid.

Just after Leo XIII&#x27;s death in 1903, Rampolla tried to make della Chiesa the secretary of the conclave, but the Sacred College elected Rafael Merry del Val, a conservative young prelate, the first sign that Rampolla would not be the next Pope. When Cardinal Rampolla had to leave his post with the election of his opponent Pope Pius X, and was succeeded by Merry del Val, della Chiesa was retained in his post.

== Bologna ==

=== Archbishop ===
Della Chiesa&#x27;s association with Rampolla, the architect of Pope Leo XIII&#x27;s (1878–1903) foreign policy, made his position in the Secretariat of State under the new pontificate somewhat uncomfortable. Italian papers announced that on 15 April 1907 the papal nuncio Aristide Rinaldini in Madrid would be replaced by della Chiesa, who had worked there before. Pius X, chuckling over the journalist&#x27;s knowledge, commented, &quot;Unfortunately, the paper forgot to mention whom I nominated as the next Archbishop of Bologna.&quot; The Vatican had supposedly &quot;gone so far as to make out the papers naming him the papal nuncio, but [della Chiesa] refused to accept them&quot;. On 18 December 1907, in the presence of his family, the diplomatic corps, numerous bishops and cardinals, and his friend Rampolla, he received the episcopal consecration from Pope Pius X himself. The Pope donated his own episcopal ring and crosier to the new bishop and spent much time with the della Chiesa family on the following day. On 23 February 1908, della Chiesa took possession of his new diocese, which included 700,000 persons, 750 priests, as well as 19 male and 78 female religious institutes. In the episcopal seminary, some 25 teachers educated 120 students preparing for the priesthood.

As bishop, he visited all parishes, making a special effort to see the smaller ones in the mountains which could only be accessed on horse-back. He always saw preaching as the main obligation of a bishop. He usually gave two or more sermons a day during his visitations. His emphasis was on cleanliness inside all churches and chapels and on saving money wherever possible, for he said, &quot;Let us save to give to the poor.&quot; A meeting of all priests in a synod had to be postponed at the wish of the Vatican considering ongoing changes in Canon Law. Numerous churches were built or restored. He personally originated a major reform of the educational orientation of the seminary, adding more science courses and classic education to the curriculum. He organized pilgrimages to Marian shrines in Loreto and Lourdes at the 50th anniversary of the apparition. The unexpected death of his friend, supporter and mentor Rampolla on 16 December 1913 was a major blow to della Chiesa, who was one of the beneficiaries of his will.

=== Cardinal ===
It was a custom that the Archbishop of Bologna would be made a cardinal in one of the coming consistories. In Bologna this was surely expected of della Chiesa as well, since, in previous years, either cardinals were named as archbishops, or archbishops as cardinals soon thereafter. Pius X did not follow this tradition and left della Chiesa waiting for almost seven years. When a delegation from Bologna visited him to ask for della Chiesa&#x27;s promotion to the College of Cardinals, he jokingly replied by making fun of his own family name, Sarto (meaning &quot;tailor&quot;), for he said, &quot;Sorry, but a Sarto has not been found yet to make the cardinal&#x27;s robe.&quot;

Cardinal Rampolla died on 16 December 1913. On 25 May 1914, della Chiesa was created a cardinal, becoming Cardinal-Priest of the &quot;titulus&quot; &quot;Santi Quattro Coronati,&quot; which before him was occupied by Pietro Respighi. When the new cardinal tried to return to Bologna after the consistory in Rome, an unrelated socialist, anti-monarchic and anti-Catholic uprising began to take place in Central Italy. This was accompanied by a general strike, the looting and destruction of churches, telephone connections and railway buildings, and a proclamation of a secular republic. In Bologna itself, citizens and the Catholic Church opposed such developments successfully. The Socialists overwhelmingly won the following regional elections with great majorities.

As World War I approached, the question was hotly discussed in Italy as to which side to be on. Officially, Italy was still in an alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary. However, in the Tyrol, an integral part of Austria which was mostly German-speaking, the southern part, the province of Trentino, was exclusively Italian-speaking. The clergy of Bologna was not totally free from nationalistic fervor either. Therefore, in his capacity as Archbishop, on the outbreak of World War I, della Chiesa made a speech on the Church&#x27;s position and duties, emphasizing the need for neutrality, promoting peace and the easing of suffering.

== Pontificate ==
=== Election to the Papacy ===

Following the death of Pius X, the resulting conclave opened at the end of August 1914. The war would clearly be the dominant issue of the new pontificate, so the cardinals&#x27; priority was to choose a man with great diplomatic experience. Thus on 3 September 1914, della Chiesa, despite having been a cardinal only three months, was elected pope, taking the name of Benedict XV. He chose the name because of his devotion to St. Benedict of Nursia, perhaps also in honour of Pope Benedict XIV, who had been an archbishop from Bologna. Upon being elected pope, he was also formally the Grand Master of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, prefect of the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office and prefect of the Sacred Consistorial Congregation. There was, however, a Cardinal-Secretary to run these bodies on a day-to-day basis.

Due to the enduring Roman Question, after the announcement of his election to the papacy by the Cardinal Protodeacon, Benedict XV, following in the footsteps of his two most recent predecessors, did not appear on the balcony of St. Peter&#x27;s basilica overlooking St. Peter&#x27;s Square to grant the &quot;urbi et orbi&quot; blessing. Benedict XV was crowned in the Sistine Chapel on 6 September 1914, and, also as a form of protest due to the Roman question, there was no ceremony for the formal possession of the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran.

In the 1914 conclave, the cardinals were divided into two factions: the &quot;reactionaries&quot; and the &quot;conservatives&quot;. The decade-long campaign waged against Modernism cast a cloud over the conclave, and also ensured on the part of the deceased pontiff that there were fewer moderate and progressive cardinals in the Sacred College. However, the cardinals feared that one of the sides in World War I might potentially influence the conclave to elect a pope that would prove amenable to their side and their positions. While the cardinals expressed relief in the abolition of the veto in 1904, there was still a palpable fear that there would be subtle attempts to exert control over the cardinals, hence, deep suspicion in many cardinals of their European colleagues. During the conclave, Cardinal Domenico Serafini and his faction had enough votes to ensure that della Chiesa was not elected, particularly since the eighth ballot had della Chiesa with a majority, though below the two-thirds needed for election.

While Serafini was considered &quot;papabile&quot; due to his position at the Holy Office, and his alignment with the policies of Pius X, other cardinals such as Andrea Carlo Ferrari and Désiré-Joseph Mercier believed that the new pope needed to focus not on Modernism and doctrinal debates, but rather, a softer focus after the somewhat harsh reign of Pius X. To that end, those cardinals turned towards electing the liberal Archbishop of Pisa Pietro Maffi. Della Chiesa, on the other hand, was wedged between Maffi and Serafini as representing the best and worst of both factions, hence his contention in the balloting. While della Chiesa seemed to secure support from some conservative cardinals, Maffi lagged considerably and hence Serafini was positioned as della Chiesa&#x27;s main rival. Since Maffi had lagged in the balloting, his supporters decided to counter Serafini and threw their support for della Chiesa, securing his election by only one vote in what was a protracted conclave.

Upon his election, Benedict XV was unable to locate a suitable cassock to wear since the three that were available to him did not appropriately fit his frail form. From a diary that recorded the events of the conclave, &quot;the papal habit that was chosen was the small one, but lacking in some part, and being a little long, it was adapted with clothespin pins, and raised and covered with a gold tassel sash&quot;.

=== Peace efforts ===
Benedict XV&#x27;s pontificate was dominated by World War I, which he termed, along with its turbulent aftermath, &quot;the suicide of Europe.&quot; Benedict&#x27;s first encyclical extended a heartfelt plea for an end to hostilities. His early call for a general Christmas truce in 1914 was ignored, although informal truces were organized. Late in the war, in May–October 1917, the apparitions of Our Lady of Fatima occurred in Fatima, Portugal, apparitions that would be declared &quot;worthy of belief&quot; in 1930 during the papacy of his successor, Pius XI.

The national antagonisms between the warring parties were accentuated by religious differences before the war, with France, Italy and Belgium being largely Catholic. Vatican relations with Great Britain were good, while neither Prussia nor Imperial Germany had any official relations with the Vatican. In Protestant circles of Germany, the notion was popular that the Catholic Pope was neutral on paper only, strongly favoring the allies instead. Benedict was said to have prompted Austria-Hungary to go to war in order to weaken the German war machine. Also, allegedly, the Papal Nuncio in Paris explained in a meeting of the &quot;Institut Catholique&quot;, &quot;to fight against France is to fight against God&quot;, and the Pope was said to have exclaimed that he was sorry not to be a Frenchman. The Belgian Cardinal Désiré-Joseph Mercier, known as a brave patriot during German occupation but also famous for his anti-German propaganda, was said to have been favored by Benedict XV for his enmity to the German cause. After the war, Benedict also allegedly praised the Treaty of Versailles, which humiliated the Germans.

These allegations were rejected by the Vatican&#x27;s Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri, who wrote on 4 March 1916 that the Holy See is completely impartial and does not favor the allied side. This was even more important, so Gasparri noted, after the diplomatic representatives of Germany and Austria-Hungary to the Vatican were expelled from Rome by Italian authorities. However, considering all this, German Protestants rejected any &quot;Papal Peace&quot;, calling it insulting. French politician Georges Clemenceau, a fierce anti-clerical, claimed to regard the Vatican initiative as anti-French. Benedict made many unsuccessful attempts to negotiate peace, but these pleas for a negotiated peace made him unpopular, even in Catholic countries like Italy, among many supporters of the war who were determined to accept nothing less than total victory.

On 1 August 1917, Benedict issued a seven-point peace plan stating that:
# &quot;the moral force of right… be substituted for the material force of arms,&quot;
# there must be &quot;simultaneous and reciprocal diminution of armaments,&quot;
# a mechanism for &quot;international arbitration must be established,&quot;
# &quot;true liberty and common rights over the sea&quot; should exist,
# there should be a &quot;renunciation of war indemnities,&quot;
# occupied territories should be evacuated, and
# there should be &quot;an examination… of rival claims.&quot;

Great Britain reacted favorably though popular opinion was mixed. President of the United States Woodrow Wilson rejected the plan. Bulgaria and Austria-Hungary were also favorable, but Germany replied ambiguously. Benedict also called for outlawing conscription, a call he repeated in 1921.

Some of the proposals eventually were included in Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points call for peace in January 1918.

In Europe, each side saw him as biased in favor of the other and was unwilling to accept the terms he proposed. Still, although unsuccessful, his diplomatic efforts during the war are credited with an increase of papal prestige and served as a model in the 20th century for the peace efforts of Pius XII before and during World War II, the policies of Paul VI during the Vietnam War, and the position of John Paul II before and during the Iraq War.

In addition to his efforts in the field of international diplomacy Pope Benedict also tried to bring about peace through Christian faith, as he published a special prayer in 1915 to be spoken by Catholics throughout the world.

=== Humanitarian efforts ===

 Almost from the beginning of the war, November 1914, Benedict negotiated with the warring parties about an exchange of wounded and other prisoners of war who were unable to continue fighting. Tens of thousands of such prisoners were exchanged through his intervention. On 15 January 1915, he proposed an exchange of civilians from the occupied zones, which resulted in 20,000 persons being sent to unoccupied Southern France in one month. In 1916, Benedict managed to hammer out an agreement between both sides by which 29,000 prisoners with lung disease from the gas attacks could be sent into Switzerland. In May 1918, he also negotiated an agreement whereby prisoners on both sides with at least 18 months of captivity and four children at home would also be sent to neutral Switzerland.

He succeeded in 1915 in reaching an agreement by which the warring parties promised not to let prisoners of war (POWs) work on Sundays and holidays. Several individuals on both sides were spared the death penalty after his intervention. Hostages were exchanged and corpses repatriated. The Pope founded the &quot;Opera dei Prigionieri&quot; to assist in distributing information on prisoners. By the end of the war, some 600,000 items of correspondence were processed by the Vatican. Almost a third of it concerned missing persons. Some 40,000 people had asked for help in the repatriation of sick POWs and 50,000 letters were sent from families to their loved ones who were POWs.

Both during and after the war, Benedict was primarily concerned about the fate of the children, on whose behalf he issued an encyclical. In 1916 he appealed to the people and clergy of the United States to help him feed the starving children in German-occupied Belgium. His aid to children was not limited to Belgium but extended to children in Lithuania, Poland, Lebanon, Montenegro, Syria and Russia. Benedict was particularly appalled at the new military invention of aerial warfare and protested several times against it to no avail.

In May and June 1915, the Ottoman Empire waged a genocide against the Armenian Christian minorities in Anatolia. The Vatican attempted to get Germany and Austria-Hungary involved in protesting to its Turkish ally. The Pope himself sent a personal letter to Sultan Mehmed V, who was also Caliph of Islam. It had no success &quot;as over a million Armenians died, either killed outright by the Turks or from maltreatment or starvation&quot;.

=== After the war ===
At the time, the anti-Vatican resentment, combined with Italian diplomatic moves to isolate the Vatican in light of the unresolved Roman Question, contributed to the exclusion of the Vatican from the Paris Peace Conference, 1919 (although it was also part of a historical pattern of political and diplomatic marginalization of the papacy after the loss of the Papal States). Despite this, he wrote an encyclical pleading for international reconciliation, &quot;Pacem, Dei Munus Pulcherrimum.&quot;

After the war, Benedict focused the Vatican&#x27;s activities on overcoming famine and misery in Europe and establishing contacts and relations with the many new states which were created because of the demise of Imperial Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Germany. Large food shipments, and information about and contacts with POWs, were to be the first steps for a better understanding of the papacy in Europe.

Regarding the Versailles Peace Conference, the Vatican believed that the economic conditions imposed on Germany were too harsh and threatened the European economic stability as a whole. Cardinal Gasparri believed that the peace conditions and the humiliation of the Germans would likely result in another war as soon as Germany would be militarily in a position to start one. The Vatican also rejected the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, seeing in this step an inevitable and eventual strengthening of Germany. The Vatican also had great reservations about the creation of small successor states which, in the view of Gasparri, were not viable economically and therefore condemned to economic misery. Benedict rejected the League of Nations as a secular organization that was not built on Christian values. On the other hand, he also condemned European nationalism that was rampant in the 1920s and asked for &quot;European Unification&quot; in his 1920 encyclical &quot;Pacem Dei Munus Pulcherrimum&quot;, &quot;peace, a beautiful gift of God&quot;. Similarly, Benedict XV extolled the virtues of peace, denouncing the fragility of a peace that is not wholly oriented towards reconciliation. Prophetically, the Pope wrote that &quot;if almost everywhere the war somehow ended and some peace pacts were signed, the germs of ancient grudges still remain. No peace has value if hatred and enmities are not put down together by means of a reconciliation based on mutual charity&quot;.

The pope was also disturbed by the communist revolution in Russia. He reacted with horror to the strongly anti-religious policies adopted by Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s government along with the bloodshed and widespread famine which occurred during the subsequent Russian Civil War. He undertook the greatest efforts trying to help the victims of the Russian famine with millions in relief.

== Diplomatic agenda ==
In the post-war period, Pope Benedict XV was involved in developing the Church administration to deal with the new international system that had emerged. The papacy was faced with the emergence of numerous new states such as Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Finland, and others. Germany, France, Italy, and Austria were impoverished from the war. In addition, the traditional social and cultural European order was threatened by right-wing nationalism and fascism as well as left-wing socialism and communism, all of which potentially threatened the existence and freedom of the Church. To deal with these and related issues, Benedict engaged in what he knew best, a large scale diplomatic offensive to secure the rights of the faithful in all countries.

=== Italy ===
Leo XIII already had agreed to the participation of Catholics in local but not national politics. Relations with Italy improved as well under Benedict XV, who de facto reversed the stiff anti-Italian policy of his predecessors by allowing Catholics to participate in national elections as well. This led to a surgence of the Italian People&#x27;s Party under Luigi Sturzo. Anti-Catholic politicians were gradually replaced by persons who were neutral or even sympathetic to the Catholic Church. King Victor Emmanuel III himself gave signals of his desire for better relations, when, for example, he sent personal condolences to the Pontiff on the death of his brother.

Benedict XV, along with most traditional Catholics of his time, opposed voting rights for women in principle, on the grounds that it would take them out of their &quot;natural sphere&quot;. However, he was pragmatic and recognized female suffrage could be a &quot;social necessity in some countries...in order to counter the generally subversive views of the socialists with the supposedly conservative votes of women&quot;, believing that women would help support traditional Catholic positions if granted suffrage.

=== France ===
Benedict XV also attempted to improve relations with the anti-clerical Republican government of France, and canonized the French national heroine Saint Joan of Arc. In the mission territories of the Third World, he emphasized the necessity of training native priests to quickly replace the European missionaries, and founded the Pontifical Oriental Institute and the Coptic College in the Vatican. Pius XI would entrust the &quot;Orientale&quot; to the Jesuits and make it a part of the Jesuit&#x27;s Gregorian Consortium in Rome (along with the Gregorian University and the Biblicum). In 1921, France re-established diplomatic relations with the Vatican.

=== Soviet Union ===
The end of the war caused the revolutionary development, which Benedict XV had foreseen in his first encyclical. With the Russian Revolution, the Vatican was faced with a new, so far unknown, situation.

=== Lithuania and Estonia ===

The relations with Russia changed drastically for a second reason. The Baltic states and Poland gained their independence from Russia after World War I, thus enabling a relatively free Church life in those former Russia-controlled countries. Estonia was the first country to look for Vatican ties. On 11 April 1919, Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri informed the Estonian authorities that the Vatican would agree to have diplomatic relations. A concordat was agreed upon in principle a year later in June 1920. It was signed on 30 May 1922. It guaranteed freedom for the Catholic Church, established archdioceses, liberated clergy from military service, allowed the creation of seminaries and Catholic schools, and enshrined church property rights and immunity. The Archbishop swore alliance to Estonia.

Relations with Catholic Lithuania were slightly more complicated because of the Polish occupation of Vilnius, a city and archiepiscopal seat, which Lithuania claimed as its own. Polish forces had occupied Vilnius and committed acts of brutality in its Catholic seminary there. This generated several protests by Lithuania to the Holy See.

=== Poland ===
Before all other heads of state, Pope Benedict XV in October 1918 congratulated the Polish people on their independence. In a public letter to Archbishop Aleksander Kakowski of Warsaw, he remembered their loyalty and the many efforts of the Holy See to assist them. He expressed his hopes that Poland would again take its place in the family of nations and continue its history as an educated Christian nation. In March 1919, he nominated 10 new bishops and, soon after, Achille Ratti, who was already in Warsaw as his representative, as papal nuncio. He repeatedly cautioned Polish authorities against persecuting Lithuanian and Ruthenian clergy. During the Bolshevik advance against Warsaw during the Polish–Soviet War, he asked for worldwide public prayers for Poland. Nuncio Ratti was the only foreign diplomat to stay in the Polish capital. On 11 June 1921, he wrote to the Polish episcopate, warning against political misuses of spiritual power, urging again for peaceful coexistence with neighbouring peoples, stating that &quot;love of country has its limits in justice and obligations&quot;. He sent nuncio Ratti to Silesia to act against potential political agitations of the Catholic clergy.

Ratti, a scholar, intended to work for Poland and build bridges to the Soviet Union, hoping even to shed his blood for Russia. Pope Benedict XV needed him as a diplomat and not as a martyr and forbade any trip into the USSR even though he was the official papal delegate to Russia. However, he continued his contacts with Russia. This did not generate much sympathy for him within Poland at the time. He was asked to go. While he tried honestly to show himself as a friend of Poland, Warsaw forced his departure after his neutrality in Silesian voting was questioned by Germans and Poles. Nationalistic Germans objected to a Polish nuncio supervising elections, and Poles were upset because he curtailed agitating clergy. On 20 November, when German Cardinal Adolf Bertram announced a papal ban on all political activities of clergymen, calls for Ratti&#x27;s expulsion climaxed in Warsaw.

=== Israel ===
As part of the preliminary diplomatic negotiations leading to the Balfour Declaration, Pope Benedict gave his support to a Jewish homeland in Palestine to Zionist diplomat Nahum Sokolow on 4 May 1917, describing the return of the Jews to Palestine as &quot;providential; God has willed it.&quot;

=== United States ===
Cardinal James Gibbons helped secure a meeting between the pope and President Woodrow Wilson which took place on 4 January 1919. The cardinal had sent a letter to the President imploring him to visit the pope after learning that Wilson was to go to Europe. Not long after, Wilson confirmed the visit and went to meet the pope accompanied by the Pontifical North American College rector Charles O&#x27;Hearn. Benedict XV took Wilson by the hand and led him into the study for their meeting, with the pope later presenting Wilson with a gift: a mosaic of Saint Peter. The interpreter had to be present for the meeting, since the pope was speaking in French, and Wilson only spoke English. The presidential party was presented to the pope, and after presenting his personal physician Admiral Grayson (telling the pope that he &quot;is the man who keeps me well&quot;), the pope said: &quot;Apparently, he has done a splendid job&quot;, before offering words to Grayson. The pope blessed the entourage, despite Wilson&#x27;s slight confusion, after the pope assured Wilson his blessing did not discriminate those of other faiths, since Wilson was a Presbyterian.

=== Ireland ===
Following the declaration of the Irish Republic in 1919, Benedict XV was visited by Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly in May 1920, who explained Irish politics and presented a memorandum, hoping for support from the &quot;Sovereign Pontiff&quot;.

In 1921, a peace agreement was formalized between the British Empire and the Irish Republic that saw to the end of the Irish War of Independence. Negotiations were conducted in London, however, there was a rise in tension during the negotiations over separate telegrams sent to Benedict XV by both King George V and Éamon de Valera. The telegram sent by de Valera took issue with the language that George V used in his message to the pope and responded to simply clarify the nature between both parties and the reasons that there had been tension between the two. In his letter to George V, the Pope praised the ongoing efforts for peace, saying that &quot;We rejoice at the resumption of the Anglo-Irish negotiations&quot; and that the negotiations would &quot;end the age-long dissention&quot; between both sides. Benedict XV further declared himself &quot;overjoyed with the agreement happily reached in regard to Ireland&quot;.

A source of contention, despite firm denials by the Holy See in 1933, is the allegation that Benedict XV, in a private interview with Count George Noble Plunkett in mid-April 1916, imparted an Apostolic blessing to the Irish Republic just two weeks before the Easter Rising. The fact that the Pope is purported to have done so was widely accepted by Republicans, though categorically denied later by &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; in 1933. Additionally, it was alleged that Plunkett pledged the Irish Republic to fidelity to the Holy See, with the Pope formally imparting his blessing on the endeavors of the Irish Republic, prompting the Archbishop of Armagh Michael Logue to send a telegram to the Pope on 30 April 1916 asking for a clarification as to what occurred during the meeting. When &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; denied these claims in 1933, the paper said that &quot;the news was entirely unfounded&quot; and that the actions of Benedict XV were &quot;in open contradiction to the well-known gentleness of the late Pontiff and to his most lively desire for peace and the prevention of any further effusion of blood&quot;. Plunkett himself affirmed the truth of the allegations, saying &quot;The fact is that the that the Papal Blessing given the men of 1916 by Pope Benedict has only one witness remaining – myself. Those who profess to refute me have not evidence to support them&quot;.

== Church affairs ==
=== Theology ===
In internal Church affairs, Benedict XV reiterated Pius X&#x27;s condemnation of Modernist scholars and the errors in modern philosophical systems in &quot;Ad beatissimi Apostolorum&quot;. He declined to readmit to communion scholars who had been excommunicated during the previous pontificate. However, he calmed what he saw as the excesses of the anti-Modernist campaign within the Church. On 25 July 1920, he wrote the motu proprio Bonum sane on Saint Joseph and against naturalism and socialism.

=== Canon law reform ===

In 1917 Benedict XV promulgated the Church&#x27;s first comprehensive Code of Canon Law, the preparation of which had been commissioned by Pope Pius X, and which is thus known as the Pio-Benedictine Code. This Code, which entered into force in 1918, was the first consolidation of the Church&#x27;s Canon Law into a modern Code made up of simple articles. Previously, Canon law was dispersed in a variety of sources and partial compilations. The new codification of canon law is credited with reviving religious life and providing judicial clarity throughout the Church.

In addition, continuing the concerns of Leo XIII, he furthered Eastern Catholic culture, theology and liturgy by founding an Oriental Institute for them in Rome and creating the Sacred Congregation for the Oriental Church in 1917. In 1919, he founded the Pontifical Ethiopian College within the Vatican walls with St. Stephen&#x27;s Church, behind St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, as the college&#x27;s designated church.

=== Catholic missions ===
On 30 November 1919, Benedict XV appealed to all Catholics worldwide to sacrifice for Catholic missions, stating at the same time in &quot;Maximum illud&quot; that these missions should foster local culture and not import European cultures.

=== Mariology ===
Pope Benedict personally addressed in numerous letters the pilgrims at Marian sanctuaries. He named Mary the Patron of Bavaria, and permitted, in Mexico, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception of Guadaloupe. He authorised the Feast of Mary Mediator of all Graces. He condemned the misuse of Marian statues and pictures, dressed in priestly robes, which he outlawed 4 April 1916.

During World War I, Benedict placed the world under the protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary and added the invocation &quot;Mary Queen of Peace&quot; to the Litany of Loreto. He promoted Marian veneration throughout the world by elevating 20 well-known Marian shrines such as Ettal Abbey in Bavaria into minor basilicas. He also promoted Marian devotions in May. The dogmatic constitution on the Church issued by the Second Vatican Council quotes the Marian theology of Benedict XV.

Pope Benedict issued the motu proprio &quot;Bonum sane&quot; on 25 July 1920, encouraging devotion to Saint Joseph &quot;since through St. Joseph we go directly to Mary, and through Mary to the source of every holiness, Jesus Christ, who consecrated the domestic virtues with his obedience to St. Joseph and Mary.&quot;

He issued an encyclical on Ephraim the Syrian depicting Ephraim as a model of Marian devotion, as well as the Apostolic Letter &quot;Inter Soldalica&quot; of 22 March 1918.
* &quot;As the blessed Virgin Mary does not seem to participate in the public life of Jesus Christ, and then, suddenly appears at the stations of his cross, she is not there without divine intention. She suffers with her suffering and dying son, almost as if she would have died herself. For the salvation of mankind, she gave up her rights as the mother of her son and sacrificed him for the reconciliation of divine justice, &quot;as far as she was permitted to do&quot;. Therefore, &quot;one can say&quot;, she redeemed with Christ the human race.&quot;

== Writings ==
During his seven-year pontificate, Benedict XV wrote a total of twelve encyclicals. In addition to the encyclicals mentioned, he issued &quot;In hac tanta&quot; on St. Boniface (14 May 1919), &quot;Paterno iam diu&quot; on the Children of Central Europe (24 November 1919), &quot;Spiritus Paraclitus&quot; on St. Jerome (September 1920), &quot;Principi Apostolorum Petro&quot; on St. Ephram the Syrian (5 October 1920), &quot;Annus iam plenus&quot; also on Children in Central Europe (1 December 1920), &quot;Sacra propediem&quot; on the Third Order of St. Francis (6 January 1921), &quot;In praeclara summorum&quot; on Dante (30 April 1921), and &quot;Fausto appetente die&quot; on St. Dominic (29 June 1921).

His Apostolic Exhortations include &quot;Ubi primum&quot; (8 September 1914), &quot;Allorché fummo chiamati&quot; (28 July 1915) and &quot;Dès le début&quot; (1 August 1917). The Papal bulls of Benedict XV include &quot;Incruentum Altaris&quot; (10 August 1915), &quot;Providentissima Mater&quot; (27 May 1917), &quot;Sedis huius&quot; (14 May 1919), and &quot;Divina disponente&quot; (16 May 1920). Benedict issued nine Briefs during his pontificate: &quot;Divinum praeceptum&quot; (December 1915), &quot;Romanorum Pontificum&quot; (February 1916), &quot;Cum Catholicae Ecclesiae&quot; (April 1916), &quot;Cum Biblia Sacra&quot; (August 1916), &quot;Cum Centesimus&quot; (October 1916), &quot;Centesimo Hodie&quot; (October 1916), &quot;Quod Ioannes&quot; (April 1917), &quot;In Africam quisnam&quot; (June 1920), and &quot;Quod nobis in condendo&quot; (September 1920).

=== &quot;Ad beatissimi Apostolorum&quot; ===
&quot;Ad beatissimi Apostolorum&quot; is an encyclical of Benedict XV given at St. Peter&#x27;s, Rome, on the Feast of All Saints on 1 November 1914, in the first year of his pontificate. This first encyclical coincided with the beginning of World War I, which he labeled &quot;The Suicide of Civilized Europe.&quot; Benedict described the combatants as the greatest and wealthiest nations of the earth, stating that &quot;they are well-provided with the most awful weapons modern military science has devised, and they strive to destroy one another with refinements of horror. There is no limit to the measure of ruin and of slaughter; day by day the earth is drenched with newly shed blood and is covered with the bodies of the wounded and of the slain.&quot;

In light of the senseless slaughter, the pope pleaded for &quot;peace on earth to men of good will&quot; (Luke 2:14), insisting that there are other ways and means whereby violated rights can be rectified.

The origin of the evil is a neglect of the precepts and practices of Christian wisdom, particularly a lack of love and compassion. Jesus Christ came down from Heaven for the very purpose of restoring among men the Kingdom of Peace, as He stated, &quot;A new commandment I give unto you: That you love one another.&quot; This message is repeated in John 15:12, in which Jesus says, &quot;This is my commandment that you love one another.&quot; Materialism, nationalism, racism, and class warfare are the characteristics of the age instead, so Benedict XV described:
* &quot;Race hatred has reached its climax; peoples are more divided by jealousies than by frontiers; within one and the same nation, within the same city there rages the burning envy of class against class; and amongst individuals it is self-love which is the supreme law over-ruling everything.&quot;

=== &quot;Humani generis redemptionem&quot; ===
The encyclical &quot;Humani generis redemptionem&quot;, from 15 June 1917, deals with blatant ineffectiveness of Christian preaching. According to Benedict XV, there are more preachers of the Word than ever before, but &quot;in the state of public and private morals as well as the constitutions and laws of nations, there is a general disregard and forgetfulness of the supernatural, a gradual falling away from the strict standard of Christian virtue, and that men are slipping back into the shameful practices of paganism.&quot; The Pope squarely put part of the blame on those ministers of the Gospel who do not handle it as they should. It is not the times but the incompetent Christian preachers who are to blame, for no one today can say for sure that the Apostles were living in better times than ours. Perhaps, the encyclical states, that the Apostles found minds more readily devoted to the Gospel, or they may have met others with less opposition to the law of God.

As the encyclical tells, first are the Catholic bishops. The Council of Trent taught that preaching &quot;is the paramount duty of Bishops.&quot; The Apostles, whose successors the bishops are, looked upon the Church as something theirs, for it was they who received the grace of the Holy Spirit to begin it. Saint Paul wrote to the Corinthians, &quot;Christ sent us not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel.&quot; Council of Trent Bishops are required to select for this priestly office those only who are &quot;fit&quot; for the position, i.e. those who &quot;can exercise the ministry of preaching with profit to souls.&quot; Profiting souls does not mean doing such &quot;eloquently or with popular applause, but rather with spiritual fruit.&quot; The Pope requested that all the priests who are incapable of preaching or of hearing confession be removed from the position.

=== &quot;Quod iam diu&quot; ===
&quot;Quod iam diu&quot; was an encyclical given at Rome at St. Peter&#x27;s on 1 December 1918, in the fifth year of his Pontificate. It requested that, after World War I, all Catholics of the world pray for a lasting peace and for those who are entrusted to make such during peace negotiations.

The pope noted that true peace has not yet arrived, but the Armistice has suspended the slaughter and devastation by land, sea and air. It is the obligation of all Catholics to &quot;invoke Divine assistance for all who take part in the peace conference,&quot; as the encyclical states. The Pope concludes that prayer is essential for the delegates who are to meet to define peace, as they are in need of much support.

=== &quot;Maximum illud&quot; ===
&quot;Maximum illud&quot; is an apostolic letter of Benedict XV issued on 30 November 1919, dealing with the Catholic missions. After reminding bishops of their responsibility to support the missions, he advised missionaries not to regard the mission as their own but to welcome others to the task and to collaborate with those around them. He underlined the necessity of proper preparation for the work in foreign cultures and the need to acquire language skills before doing such work, especially in the Orient. He tells missionaries that: &quot;Especially among the infidels, who are guided more by instinct than by reason, preaching by example is much more profitable than that of words&quot;. He requested a continued striving for personal sanctity and praised the selfless work of women religious in the missions. &quot;Mission&quot;, however, &quot;is not only for missionaries, but all Catholics must participate through their apostolate of prayer, by supporting vocations, and by helping financially.&quot; The letter concludes with the naming of several organizations which organize and supervise mission activities within the Catholic Church.

== Internal activities ==
=== Canonizations and beatifications ===

Benedict XV canonized three individuals, all in May 1920: Gabriel of Our Lady of Sorrows, Joan of Arc, and Margaret Mary Alacoque. He also beatified a total of forty-six people, including the Uganda Martyrs (1920), Oliver Plunkett (1920) and Louise de Marillac (1920).

=== Doctor of the Church ===
He named Ephrem the Syrian as a Doctor of the Church on 5 October 1920.

=== Consistories ===

The pope created 32 cardinals in five consistories, elevating men into the cardinalate such as Pietro La Fontaine (1916) and Michael von Faulhaber (1921); he reserved two &quot;in pectore&quot; but later published one name (Adolf Bertram). The pope&#x27;s death in 1922 therefore invalidated the second appointment (it has been alleged that the second &quot;in pectore&quot; cardinal was to be Pavel Huyn).

Benedict XV elevated 31 Europeans into the College of Cardinals with Dennis Joseph Dougherty as the single non-European cardinal appointed. In the 1916 consistory, no German or Austro-Hungarian cardinals were able to attend due to the intensity of the war. In that consistory, by naming Adolf Bertram as a cardinal &quot;in pectore&quot;, Benedict XV hoped not to provoke any negativity in his selection from the Allies, particularly the Italians. Bertram was not formally invested in the Sacred College until December 1919, after the war had concluded.

In the 1921 consistory, Benedict XV is reported to have said, that &quot;We gave you the red robe of a Cardinal... very soon, however, one of you will wear the white robe&quot;.

== Personality and appearance ==

Pope Benedict XV was a slight man. He wore the smallest of three cassocks that were prepared for the election of a new pope in 1914, and became known as &quot;Il Piccoletto&quot; or &quot;The Little Man&quot;. The cassock he wore upon his election had to be quickly stitched up so it could properly fit him. The new pope jokingly said to the tailors: &quot;My dear, had you forgotten me?&quot; He was dignified in bearing and courtly in terms of manners, but his appearance was not that of a pope. He had a sallow complexion, a mat of black hair, and prominent teeth. He himself had referred to his appearance as an &quot;ugly gargoyle upon the buildings of Rome&quot;. It was even said that his father looked upon his newborn son with incredulity and turned away in dismay at the sight of the infant della Chiesa, due to the small, bluish pallor and frail appearance of the infant.

He was renowned for his generosity, answering all pleas for help from poor Roman families with large cash gifts from his private revenues. When he was short on money, those who would be admitted to an audience would often be instructed by prelates not to mention their financial woes, as Benedict would inevitably feel guilty that he could not help the needy at the time. He also depleted the Vatican&#x27;s official revenues with large-scale charitable expenditure during World War I. Upon his death, the Vatican Treasury had been depleted to the equivalent in Italian lira of U.S. $19,000 ($ in 2025).

Benedict XV was a careful innovator by Vatican standards. He was known to carefully consider all novelties before he ordered their implementation, then insisting on them to the fullest. He rejected clinging to the past for the past&#x27;s sake with the words &quot;Let us live in the present and not in history.&quot; His relation to secular Italian powers was reserved yet positive, avoiding conflict and tacitly supporting the Royal Family of Italy. Yet, like Pius IX and Leo XIII, he also protested against interventions of State authorities in internal Church affairs. Pope Benedict was not considered a man of letters. He did not publish educational or devotional books. His encyclicals are pragmatic and down-to-earth, intelligent and at times far-sighted. He remained neutral during the battles of the &quot;Great War,&quot; when almost everybody else was claiming &quot;sides.&quot; Like that of Pius XII during World War II, his neutrality was questioned by all sides then and even to this day.

== Legacy ==

Benedict XV made valiant efforts towards the Catholic Church. In 2005, Pope Benedict XVI recognized the significance of his long-ago predecessor&#x27;s commitment to peace by taking the same name upon his own rise to the pontificate. Benedict XV&#x27;s humane approach to the world in 1914–1918 starkly contrasted with most of the monarchs and leaders of the time, with few notable exceptions.

Pope Pius XII showed high regard for Benedict XV, who had consecrated him a bishop on 13 May 1917, the very day of the first reported apparitions of Our Lady of Fatima. While Pius XII considered another Benedict, Benedict XIV, in terms of his sanctity and scholarly contributions to be worthy as Doctor of the Church, he thought that Benedict XV during his short pontificate was truly a man of God, who worked for peace. He helped prisoners of war and many others who needed help in dire times, and was extremely generous to Russia. He praised him as a Marian Pope who promoted the devotion to Our Lady of Lourdes, for his encyclicals &quot;Ad beatissimi Apostolorum&quot;, &quot;Humani generis redemptionem&quot;, &quot;Quod iam diu&quot;, and &quot;Spiritus Paraclitus&quot;, and for the codification of Canon Law.

Pope Benedict XVI showed his own admiration for Benedict XV following his election to the papacy on 19 April 2005. The election of a new Pope is often accompanied by conjecture over his choice of papal name; it is widely believed that a Pope chooses the name of a predecessor whose teachings and legacy he wishes to continue. Cardinal Ratzinger&#x27;s choice of &quot;Benedict&quot; was seen as a signal that Benedict XV&#x27;s views on humanitarian diplomacy and his stance against relativism and modernism would be emulated during the reign of the new Pope. During his first General Audience in St. Peter&#x27;s Square on 27 April 2005, Pope Benedict XVI paid tribute to Benedict XV when explaining his choice:

<text>John Oswald (born May 30, 1953 in Kitchener, Ontario) is a Canadian composer, saxophonist, media artist and dancer. His best known project is &quot;Plunderphonics&quot;, the practice of making new music out of previously existing recordings (see sound collage and musical montage).

==Early life==
Oswald was introduced to sampling from a young age having been gifted a reel-to-reel player from his parents at age 9. He then attended Simon Fraser University in the 1970s, becoming part of World Soundscape Project while on campus. It was there that Oswald became familiar with recorded sounds from different environments and applying them to new work created. 

==Philosophy==
Oswald coined the term &quot;plunderphonics&quot; to describe his craft in a paper called &quot;Plunderphonics, or Audio Piracy as a Compositional Prerogative&quot; which he presented at the Wired Society Electro-Acoustic Conference in Toronto in 1985. Inspired by William S. Burroughs&#x27; cut-up technique, Oswald had been devising plunderphonic-style compositions since the late 1960s. In an interview with Norman Igma following the release of the Plunderphonics EP in 1988, he described the concept as follows:
&quot;A plunderphone is a recognizable sonic quote, using the actual sound of something familiar which has already been recorded. Whistling a bar of &quot;Density 21.5&quot; is a traditional musical quote. Taking Madonna singing &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and rerecording it backwards or slower is plunderphonics, as long as you can reasonably recognize the source. The plundering has to be blatant though. There&#x27;s a lot of samplepocketing, parroting, plagiarism and tune thievery going on these days which is not what we&#x27;re doing.&quot;
Plunderphonics is related to but distinct from sampling used in genres such as hip-hop.

==Works==
His 1975 track &quot;Power&quot; married frenetic Led Zeppelin guitars to the impassioned exhortations of a Southern US evangelist years before hip hop discovered the potency of the same (and related) ingredients. Similarly, his 1990 track &quot;Vane&quot;, which pitted two different versions of the song &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; (the Carly Simon original and a cover by Faster Pussycat) against each other, was a blueprint for the contemporary pop subgenre, &#x27;glitch pop&#x27; or &#x27;mashup&#x27;.

In 1980, Oswald founded the Mystery Tapes Laboratory, which created unnamed, unattributed works on cassette, described on the plunderphonics website as &quot;little boxes of sonifericity specifically formulated for the curious listener. Available in your choice of aural flavors: subliminal, blasted, excerpted, repeatpeateatattttttedly, these cinemaphonically-concocted aggregates of très different but exquisitely manifest, unprecedentedly varied festerings of audio quality fine magnetic cassette tapes are the best of whatever you&#x27;ve been listening for&quot;. Oswald continues to be Director of Research at Mystery Tapes.

His greatest source of controversy was the 1988 release of the Plunderphonics EP, which he distributed to the press and to radio stations. It contained four plundered tracks: &quot;Don&#x27;t&quot; by Elvis Presley which included piano accompaniment by Bob Wiseman, &quot;Pocket&quot; by Count Basie, a version of Dolly Parton singing &quot;The Great Pretender&quot; in which &quot;she gets to sing a duet with himself(sic)&quot;, and &quot;Spring&quot;, a version of Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s The Rite of Spring. In 1989, Oswald released an expanded version of the Plunderphonics album on compact disc containing twenty-five tracks, each using material from a different artist. In 1990, notice was given to Oswald by the Canadian Recording Industry Association on behalf of several of their clients (notably Michael Jackson, whose song &quot;Bad&quot; had been cut up, layered, and rearranged as &quot;Dab&quot;) that all undistributed copies of Plunderphonics be destroyed under threat of legal action.
&quot;&quot;I wasn&#x27;t selling the disc in the stores, so I let listeners tape it off the radio for free,&quot; explains Oswald, who paid for the production and manufacture of the CD out of his own pocket. He receives no royalties or financial compensation for airplay. Brian Robertson, president of CRIA says, ``What this demonstrates is the vulnerability of the recording industry to new technology...All we see is just another example of theft.&quot;&quot;

&quot;Oswald received notice from CRIA&#x27;s lawyers demanding that he cease distributing Plunderphonic as of Xmas eve &#x27;89. &quot;They insisted I quit playing Santa Claus,&quot; Oswald observes.&quot;
In 1993 Oswald released &quot;Plexure&quot;. Arguably his most ambitious composition to date, it attempted to microsample the history of CD music up to that point (1982–1992) in a 20 minute collage of bewildering complexity. The ambition of this piece would later be recalled by the British bootlegger Osymyso, whose &quot;Intro-Inspection&quot; emulates the pop-junkie feel of &quot;Plexure&quot;.

From 1993 to 1996, Oswald worked on and released &quot;Grayfolded&quot;, a 2-Disc set commissioned by the Grateful Dead consisting of pieces created from over 100 performances of the song &quot;Dark Star&quot;. Oswald initially created and released disc 1, &quot;Transitive Axis&quot;, which contains a 59 minute 59 second work in 9 movements. Feeling that there was more territory to explore, Oswald worked on disc 2, Mirror Ashes, which is a composition in &quot;6*&quot; movements. Once both discs were complete they were packaged together with extensive liner notes and a &quot;visual time map&quot; of the sources used in the compositions. &quot;Grayfolded&quot; was selected the #1 international recording of the decade by the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;.

In addition to his extensive work in &quot;plunderphonics&quot;, Oswald is also involved with music, as a composer and improviser. His compositions for orchestra often do include electronic elements, such as &quot;Concerto for Wired Conductor and Orchestra&quot; (?), but has also composed for acoustic ensembles, such as &quot;Acupuncture&quot; (1991). Oswald improvises with the saxophone, and is a member of free improvisation group CCMC. 

===Other projects===
Oswald is also actively involved in dance, as a composer for dance works, as a collaborator with choreographers, and as an active Contact Improviser.

Oswald founded the record label &quot;fony&quot;, which produced the retrospective box set &quot;69 plunderphonics 96&quot; (a.k.a. Plunderphonics 69/96) and reissued &quot;Grayfolded&quot;. The label also rereleased &quot;Plexure&quot; and released &quot;Aparanthesi&quot;, a work which uses the single note A in an experiment with timbre, dynamics, and layering, on CD in 2003.

Since 2000 Oswald has been as active in exhibiting his visual art as in continuing his musical activities.

===Legacy===
In 2004, Oswald was one of six artists to win the annual Governor General&#x27;s Awards in Visual and Media Arts, as awarded by the Canada Council for the Arts, for lifetime achievement.

<doc id="147858" wikidata="Q42323" url="?curid=147858" title="Pope Pius XI">
<text>Pope Pius XI (), born Ambrogio Damiano Achille Ratti (; 31 May 1857 – 10 February 1939), was the head of the Catholic Church from 6 February 1922 to 10 February 1939. He also became the first sovereign of the Vatican City State upon its creation as an independent state on 11 February 1929. He remained pope until his death in February 1939.

Pius XI issued numerous encyclicals, including &quot;Quadragesimo anno&quot; on the 40th anniversary of Pope Leo XIII&#x27;s groundbreaking social encyclical &quot;Rerum novarum&quot;, highlighting the capitalistic greed of international finance, the dangers of socialism/communism, and social justice issues, and &quot;Quas primas&quot;, establishing the feast of Christ the King in response to anti-clericalism. The encyclical &quot;Studiorum ducem&quot;, promulgated 29 June 1923, was written on the occasion of the 6th centenary of the canonization of Thomas Aquinas, whose thought is acclaimed as central to Catholic philosophy and theology. The encyclical also singles out the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot; as the preeminent institution for the teaching of Aquinas: &quot;ante omnia Pontificium Collegium Angelicum, ubi Thomam tamquam domi suae habitare dixeris&quot; (before all others the Pontifical Angelicum College, where Thomas can be said to dwell). The encyclical &quot;Casti connubii&quot; promulgated on 31 December 1930 prohibited Catholics from using contraception. 

To establish or maintain the position of the Catholic Church, Pius XI concluded a record number of concordats, including the &quot;Reichskonkordat&quot; with Nazi Germany, and he condemned their betrayals four years later in the encyclical &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot; (&quot;With Burning Concern&quot;). During his pontificate, the longstanding hostility with the Italian government over the status of the papacy and the Church in Italy was successfully resolved in the Lateran Treaty of 1929. He was unable to stop the persecution of the Church and the killing of clergy in Mexico, Spain, and the Soviet Union. He canonized saints including Thomas More, Peter Canisius, Bernadette of Lourdes, and Don Bosco. He beatified and canonized Thérèse de Lisieux, for whom he held special reverence, and gave equivalent canonization to Albertus Magnus, naming him a Doctor of the Church due to his writings&#x27; spiritual power. He took a strong interest in fostering the participation of laypeople throughout the Church, especially in the Catholic Action movement. The end of his pontificate was dominated by speaking out against Hitler and Mussolini, and defending the Catholic Church from intrusions into its life and education.

Pius XI died on 10 February 1939 in the Apostolic Palace and was buried in the Papal Grotto of Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica. In the course of excavating space for his tomb, two levels of burial grounds were uncovered that revealed bones now venerated as the bones of St. Peter.

== Early life and career ==

Ambrogio Damiano Achille Ratti was born in Desio, in the province of Milan, in 1857, the son of the owner of a silk factory. His parents were Francesco Antonio Ratti (1823–1881) and his wife Angela Teresa née Galli-Cova (1832–1918); his siblings were Carlo (1853–1906), Fermo (1854–1929), Edoardo (1855–1896), Camilla (1860–1946), and Cipriano. He was ordained a priest in 1879 and was selected for a life of academic studies within the Church. He obtained three doctorates (in philosophy, canon law, and theology) at the Gregorian University in Rome, and from 1882 to 1888 was a professor at a seminary in Padua. His scholarly speciality was as an expert paleographer, a student of ancient and medieval Church manuscripts. In 1888, he was transferred from seminary teaching to the Ambrosian Library in Milan, where he worked till 1911.

During this time, Ratti edited and published an edition of the Ambrosian Missal (the rite of Mass used in a wide territory in northern Italy, coinciding above all with the diocese of Milan). He also engaged in research and writing on the life and works of the reforming Archbishop of Milan, Charles Borromeo. Ratti became head of the Ambrosian Library in 1907 and undertook a thorough programme of restoration and reclassification of its collections. In his spare time, he was an avid mountaineer, reaching the summits of Monte Rosa, the Matterhorn, Mont Blanc, and Presolana. A scholar-athlete pope was not seen again until John Paul II. In 1911, Ratti was appointed by Pope Pius X Vice-Prefect of the Vatican Library, and in 1914 was promoted to Prefect.

In 1918, Pope Benedict XV (1914–1922) appointed Ratti to what was in effect a diplomatic post, as apostolic visitor (an unofficial papal representative) in Poland. In the aftermath of World War I, a Polish state was restored, though the process was in practice incomplete, since the territory was still under the effective control of Germany and Austria-Hungary. In October 1918, Benedict was the first head of state to congratulate the Polish people on the occasion of the restoration of their independence. In March 1919, he appointed ten new bishops and on 6 June 1919 reappointed Ratti, this time to the rank of papal nuncio and on 3 July appointed him a titular archbishop. Ratti was consecrated as a bishop on 28 October 1919.
According to German theologian Joseph Schmidlin&#x27;s &quot;Papstgeschichte der Neuesten Zeit&quot;, Benedict and Ratti repeatedly cautioned Polish authorities against persecuting Lithuanian and Ruthenian clergy. During the Bolshevik advance against Warsaw during the Polish-Soviet War, Benedict asked for worldwide public prayers for Poland, while Ratti was the only foreign diplomat who refused to flee Warsaw when the Red Army was approaching the city in August 1920. On 11 June 1921, Benedict asked Ratti to deliver his message to the Polish episcopate, warning against political misuses of spiritual power, urging peaceful coexistence with neighboring peoples, and saying that &quot;love of country has its limits in justice and obligations&quot;.

Ratti intended to work for Poland by building bridges to men of goodwill in the Soviet Union, even to shedding his blood for Russia. But Benedict needed Ratti as a diplomat, not a martyr, and forbade his traveling to the USSR despite his being the official papal delegate for Russia. The nuncio&#x27;s continued contacts with Russians did not generate much sympathy for him within Poland at the time. After Benedict sent Ratti to Silesia to forestall potential political agitation within the Polish Catholic clergy, Ratti was asked to leave Poland. On 20 November, when German Cardinal Adolf Bertram announced a papal ban on all political activities of clergymen, calls for Ratti&#x27;s expulsion climaxed. Ratti was asked to leave. &quot;While he tried honestly to show himself as a friend of Poland, Warsaw forced his departure, after his neutrality in Silesian voting was questioned&quot; by Germans and Poles. Nationalistic Germans objected to the Polish nuncio supervising local elections, and patriotic Poles were upset because he curtailed political action among the clergy.

=== Elevation to the papacy ===
In the consistory of 3 June 1921, Benedict XV created three new cardinals, including Ratti, who was appointed Archbishop of Milan simultaneously. Benedict told them, &quot;Well, today I gave you the red hat, but soon it will be white for one of you.&quot; After the Vatican celebration, Ratti went to the Benedictine monastery at Monte Cassino for a retreat to prepare spiritually for his new role. He accompanied Milanese pilgrims to Lourdes in August 1921. Ratti received a tumultuous welcome on a visit to his home town of Desio, and was enthroned in Milan on 8 September. On 22 January 1922, Benedict XV died unexpectedly of pneumonia.

At the conclave to choose a new pope, which was the longest of the 20th century, the College of Cardinals was divided into two factions, one led by Rafael Merry del Val favoring the policies and style of Pius X and the other favoring those of Benedict XV led by Pietro Gasparri.

Gasparri approached Ratti before voting began on the third day and told him he would urge his supporters to switch their votes to Ratti, who was shocked to hear this. When it became clear that neither Gasparri nor del Val could win, the cardinals approached Ratti, thinking him a compromise candidate not identified with either faction. Cardinal Gaetano de Lai approached Ratti and was believed to have said: &quot;We will vote for Your Eminence if Your Eminence will promise that you will not choose Cardinal Gasparri as your secretary of state&quot;. Ratti is said to have responded: &quot;I hope and pray that among so highly deserving cardinals the Holy Spirit selects someone else. If I am chosen, it is indeed Cardinal Gasparri whom I will take to be my secretary of state&quot;.

Ratti was elected on the conclave&#x27;s 14th ballot on 6 February 1922 and took the name Pius XI, explaining that Pius IX was the pope of his youth and Pius X had appointed him head of the Vatican Library. It was rumored that immediately after the election, he decided to appoint Pietro Gasparri as his Cardinal Secretary of State. When asked if he accepted his election, Ratti was said to have replied: &quot;In spite of my unworthiness, of which I am deeply aware, I accept&quot;. He went on to say that his choice in papal name was because &quot;Pius is a name of peace&quot;.

After the dean Cardinal Vincenzo Vannutelli asked if he assented to the election, Ratti paused in silence for two minutes, according to Cardinal Désiré-Joseph Mercier. The Hungarian cardinal János Csernoch later commented: &quot;We made Cardinal Ratti pass through the fourteen stations of the Via Crucis and then we left him alone on Calvary&quot;.

As Pius XI&#x27;s first act as pope, he revived the traditional public blessing from the balcony, &quot;Urbi et Orbi&quot; (&quot;to the city and to the world&quot;), abandoned by his predecessors since the loss of Rome to the Italian state in 1870. This suggested his openness to a rapprochement with the government of Italy. Less than a month later, considering that all four cardinals from the Western Hemisphere had been unable to participate in his election, he issued &quot;Cum proxime&quot; to allow the College of Cardinals to delay the start of a conclave for as long as 18 days following the death of a pope.

== Public teaching: &quot;The Peace of Christ in the Reign of Christ&quot; ==
Pius XI&#x27;s first encyclical as pope was directly related to his aim of Christianizing all aspects of increasingly secular societies. &quot;Ubi arcano&quot;, promulgated in December 1922, inaugurated the &quot;Catholic Action&quot; movement.

Similar goals were in evidence in two encyclicals of 1929 and 1930. &quot;Divini illius magistri&quot; (&quot;That Divine Teacher&#x27;s&quot;) (1929) made clear the need for Christian over secular education. &quot;Casti connubii&quot; (&quot;Chaste Wedlock&quot;) (1930) praised Christian marriage and family life as the basis for any good society; it condemned artificial means of contraception, but acknowledged the unitive aspect of intercourse:

* ...[A]ny use whatsoever of matrimony exercised in such a way that the act is deliberately frustrated in its natural power to generate life is an offense against the law of God and of nature, and those who indulge in such are branded with the guilt of a grave sin.
* ...Nor are those considered as acting against nature who in the married state use their right in the proper manner although on account of natural reasons either of time or of certain defects, new life cannot be brought forth. For in matrimony as well as in the use of the matrimonial rights there are also secondary ends, such as mutual aid, the cultivating of mutual love, and the quieting of concupiscence which husband and wife are not forbidden to consider so long as they are subordinated to the primary end and so long as the intrinsic nature of the act is preserved.

=== Political teachings ===
In contrast to some of his 19th-century predecessors who favored monarchy and dismissed democracy, Pius XI took a pragmatic approach toward different forms of government. In his encyclical &quot;Dilectissima Nobis&quot; (1933), in which he addressed the situation of the Church in Republican Spain, he proclaimed,

=== Social teachings ===

Pius XI argued for a reconstruction of economic and political life on the basis of religious values. &quot;Quadragesimo anno&quot; (1931) was written to mark &#x27;forty years&#x27; since Pope Leo XIII&#x27;s (1878–1903) encyclical &quot;Rerum novarum&quot;, and restated that encyclical&#x27;s warnings against both socialism and unrestrained capitalism, as enemies to human freedom and dignity. Pius XI instead envisioned an economy based on cooperation and solidarity.

In &quot;Quadragesimo anno&quot;, Pius XI wrote that social and economic issues are vital to the Church not from a technical point of view but morally and ethically. Ethical considerations include the nature of private property in terms of its functions for society and the development of the individual. He defined fair wages and called international capitalism materially and spiritually exploitative.

==== Gender roles ====
Pius XI wrote that mothers should work primarily within the home, or in its immediate vicinity, and concentrate on household duties. He argued that every effort in society must be made for fathers to make high enough wages that it never becomes necessary for mothers to work. Forced dual-income situations in which mothers work he called an &quot;intolerable abuse&quot;. Pius also criticized egalitarianist stances, describing modern attempts to &quot;liberate women&quot; as a &quot;crime&quot;. He wrote that attempts to liberate women from their husbands are a &quot;false liberty and unnatural equality&quot; and that the true emancipation of women &quot;belongs to the noble office of a Christian woman and wife.&quot;

==== Private property ====
The Church has a role in discussing the issues related to the social order. Social and economic issues are vital to it not from a technical point of view but morally and ethically. Ethical considerations include the nature of private property. Within the Catholic Church, several conflicting views had developed. Pius declared private property essential for individual development and freedom, and said that those who deny private property also deny personal freedom and development. He also said that private property has a social function and loses its morality if it is not subordinated to the common good, and governments have a right to redistribution policies. In extreme cases, he granted the state a right to expropriate private property.

==== Capital and labor ====

A related issue, said Pius, is the relation between capital and labor and the determination of fair wages. Pius develops the following ethical mandate: The Church considers it a perversion of industrial society to have developed sharp opposite camps based on income. He welcomes all attempts to alleviate these differences. Three elements determine a fair wage: the worker&#x27;s family, the economic condition of the enterprise, and the economy as a whole. The family has an innate right to development, but this is possible only within the framework of a functioning economy and a sound enterprise. Thus, Pius concludes that cooperation and not conflict is a necessary condition, given the interdependence of the parties involved.

==== Social order ====
Pius XI believed that industrialization results in less freedom at the individual and communal level because numerous free social entities get absorbed by larger ones. The society of individuals becomes the mass class-society. People are much more interdependent than in ancient times, and become egoistic or class-conscious in order to save some freedom for themselves. The pope demands more solidarity, especially between employers and employees, through new forms of cooperation and communication. Pius displays an unfavorable view of capitalism, especially anonymous international finance markets. He identifies certain dangers for small and medium-size enterprises that have insufficient access to capital markets and are squeezed or destroyed by larger ones. He warns that capitalist interests can become a danger for nations, which could be reduced to &quot;chained slaves of individual interests&quot;.

Pius XI was the first Pope to use the power of modern communications technology in evangelizing the wider world. He established Vatican Radio in 1931, and was the first Pope to broadcast on radio.

== Internal Church affairs and ecumenism ==
In his management of the Church&#x27;s internal affairs, Pius XI mostly continued the policies of his predecessor. Like Benedict XV, he emphasized spreading Catholicism in Africa and Asia and training native clergy in those territories. He ordered every religious order to devote some of its personnel and resources to missionary work.

Pius XI continued the approach of Benedict XV on the issue of how to deal with the threat of modernism in Catholic theology. He was thoroughly orthodox theologically and had no sympathy with modernist ideas that relativized fundamental Catholic teachings. He condemned modernism in his writings and addresses. But his opposition to modernist theology was by no means a rejection of new scholarship within the Church, as long as it was developed within the framework of orthodoxy and compatible with the Church&#x27;s teachings. Pius XI was interested in supporting serious scientific study within the Church, establishing the Pontifical Academy of the Sciences in 1936. In 1928 he formed the Gregorian Consortium of universities in Rome administered by the Society of Jesus, fostering closer collaboration between their Gregorian University, Biblical Institute, and Oriental Institute.

Pius XI strongly encouraged devotion to the Sacred Heart in his encyclical &quot;Miserentissimus Redemptor&quot; (1928).

Pius XI was the first pope to directly address the Christian ecumenical movement. Like Benedict XV he was interested in achieving reunion with the Eastern Orthodox (failing that, he determined to give special attention to the Eastern Catholic churches). He also allowed the dialogue between Catholics and Anglicans that had been planned during Benedict XV&#x27;s pontificate to take place at Mechelen, but these enterprises were firmly aimed at actually reuniting with the Catholic Church other Christians who basically agreed with Catholic doctrine, bringing them back under papal authority. To the broad pan-Protestant ecumenical movement he took a less favorable attitude.

He rejected, in his 1928 encyclical &quot;Mortalium animos&quot;, the idea that Christian unity could be attained by establishing a broad federation of many bodies holding conflicting doctrines; rather, the Catholic Church was the true Church of Christ. &quot;The union of Christians can only be promoted by promoting the return to the one true Church of Christ of those who are separated from it, for in the past they have unhappily left it.&quot; The pronouncement also prohibited Catholics from joining groups that encouraged interfaith discussion without distinction.

The next year, the Vatican was successful in lobbying the Mussolini regime to require Catholic religious education in all schools, even those with a majority of Protestants or Jews. The Pope expressed his &quot;great pleasure&quot; with the move.

In 1934, the Fascist government at the Vatican&#x27;s urging agreed to expand the probation on public gatherings of Protestants to include private worship in homes.

=== Activities ===
==== Beatifications and canonizations ====

Pius XI canonized 34 saints during his pontificate, including Bernadette Soubirous (1933), Thérèse of Lisieux (1925), John Vianney (1925), John Fisher and Thomas More (1935), and John Bosco (1934). He also beatified 464 of the faithful, including Pierre-René Rogue (1934) and Noël Pinot (1926).

Pius XI also declared Saints to be Doctors of the Church:
* Peter Canisius (21 May 1925)
* John of the Cross (24 August 1926; naming him &quot;Doctor mysticus&quot; or &quot;Mystical Doctor&quot;)
* Robert Bellarmine (17 September 1931)
* Albert the Great (16 December 1931; naming him &quot;Doctor universalis&quot; or &quot;Universal Doctor&quot;)

==== Consistories ====

Pius XI created 76 cardinals in 17 consistories, including August Hlond (1927), Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster (1929), Raffaele Rossi (1930), Elia Dalla Costa (1933), and Giuseppe Pizzardo (1937). One of those was his successor, Eugenio Pacelli, who became Pope Pius XII. Pius XI in fact believed that Pacelli would be his successor and dropped many hints that this was his hope. On one such occasion at a consistory for new cardinals on 13 December 1937, while posing with the new cardinals, Pius XI pointed to Pacelli and told them: &quot;He&#x27;ll make a good pope!&quot;

Pius XI also accepted the resignation of a cardinal from the cardinalate in 1927: the Jesuit Louis Billot.

The pope deviated from the usual practice of naming cardinals in collective consistories, opting instead for smaller and more frequent consistories, with some of them being less than six months apart. Unlike his predecessors, he increased the number of non-Italian cardinals.

In 1923, Pius XI wanted to appoint Ricardo Sanz de Samper y Campuzano (majordomo in the Papal Household) to the College of Cardinals but was forced to abandon the idea when King Alfonso XIII of Spain insisted that the pope appoint cardinals from South America despite the fact that Sanz hailed from Colombia. Since Pius XI did not want to appear to be influenced by political considerations, he chose in the December 1923 consistory to name no South American cardinals at all. According to an article by the historian Monsignor Vicente Cárcel y Ortí, a 1928 letter from Alfonso XIII asked the pope to restore Valencia as a cardinalitial see and appoint its archbishop, Prudencio Melo y Alcalde, a cardinal. Pius XI responded that he could not do so because Spain already had the habitual number of cardinals (set at four) with two of them fixed (Toledo and Seville) and the other two variable. Pius XI recommended that Alfonso XIII wait for a future occasion, but he never did make the archbishop a cardinal, and not until 2007 was the diocese given a cardinal archbishop. In December 1935, the pope intended to appoint the Jesuit priest Pietro Tacchi Venturi a cardinal, but abandoned the idea given that the British government would have regarded the move as a friendly gesture toward Fascism since the priest and Benito Mussolini were considered to be close.

== International relations ==

The pontificate of Pius XI coincided with the early aftermath of the First World War. Many of the old European monarchies had been swept away and a new and precarious order formed across the continent. In the East, the Soviet Union arose. In Italy, the Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini took power, while in Germany, the fragile Weimar Republic collapsed with the Nazi seizure of power. His reign was one of busy diplomatic activity for the Vatican. The Church made advances on several fronts in the 1920s, improving relations with France and, most spectacularly, settling the Roman question with Italy and gaining recognition of an independent Vatican state.

Pius XI&#x27;s major diplomatic approach was to make concordats. He concluded eighteen such treaties during the course of his pontificate. However, wrote Peter Hebblethwaite, these concordats did not prove &quot;durable or creditable&quot; and &quot;wholly failed in their aim of safeguarding the institutional rights of the Church&quot; for &quot;Europe was entering a period in which such agreements were regarded as mere scraps of paper&quot;.

From 1933 to 1936 Pius wrote several protests against the Nazi regime, while his attitude to Mussolini&#x27;s Italy changed dramatically in 1938, after Nazi racial policies were adopted in Italy. Pius XI watched the rising tide of totalitarianism with alarm and delivered three papal encyclicals challenging the new creeds: against Italian Fascism &quot;Non abbiamo bisogno&quot; (1931; &quot;We Do Not Need [to Acquaint You]&quot;); against Nazism &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot; (1937; &quot;With Deep Concern&quot;), and against atheist Communism &quot;Divini redemptoris&quot; (1937; &quot;Divine Redeemer&quot;). He also challenged the extremist nationalism of the Action Française movement and antisemitism in the United States.

=== Relations with France ===
France&#x27;s republican government had long been anti-clerical, and much of the French Catholic Church anti-republican. The 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State had expelled many religious orders from France, declared all Church buildings to be government property, and had led to the closure of most Church schools. Since that time Pope Benedict XV had sought a rapprochement, but it was not achieved until the reign of Pope Pius XI. In &quot;Maximam gravissimamque&quot; (1924), many areas of dispute were tacitly settled and a bearable coexistence made possible.

In 1926, worried by the agnosticism of its leader Charles Maurras, Pius XI condemned the monarchist movement Action Française. The Pope also judged that it was folly for the French Church to continue to tie its fortunes to the unlikely dream of a monarchist restoration, and distrusted the movement&#x27;s tendency to defend the Catholic religion in merely utilitarian and nationalistic terms. Prior to this, Action Française had operated with the support of a great number of French lay Catholics, such as Jacques Maritain, as well as members of the clergy. Pius XI&#x27;s decision was strongly criticized by Cardinal Louis Billot who believed that the political activities of monarchist Catholics should not be censured by Rome. He later resigned from his position as Cardinal, the only man to do so in the twentieth century, which is believed by some to have been the ultimate result of Pius XI&#x27;s condemnation, though these claims have been disputed. Pius XI&#x27;s successor, Pope Pius XII, repealed the papal ban on the group in 1939, once again allowing Catholics to associate themselves with the movement. However, despite Pius XII&#x27;s actions to rehabilitate the group, &quot;Action Française&quot; ultimately never recovered to their former status.

=== Relations with Italy and the Lateran Treaties ===

Pius XI aimed to end the long breach between the papacy and the Italian government and to gain recognition once more of the sovereign independence of the Holy See. Most of the Papal States had been seized by the forces of King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy (1861–1878) in 1860 at the foundation of the modern unified Italian state, and the rest, including Rome, in 1870. The Papacy and the Italian Government had been at loggerheads ever since: the Popes had refused to recognise the Italian state&#x27;s seizure of the Papal States, instead withdrawing to become prisoners in the Vatican, and the Italian government&#x27;s policies had always been anti-clerical. Now Pius XI thought a compromise would be the best solution.

To bolster his own new regime, Benito Mussolini was also eager for an agreement. After years of negotiation, in 1929, the Pope supervised the signing of the Lateran Treaties with the Italian government. According to the terms of the treaty that was one of the agreed documents, Vatican City was given sovereignty as an independent nation in return for the Vatican relinquishing its claim to the former territories of the Papal States. Pius XI thus became a head of state (albeit the smallest state in the world), the first Pope who could be termed a head of state since the Papal States fell after the unification of Italy in the 19th century. The concordat that was another of the agreed documents of 1929 recognised Catholicism as the sole religion of the state (as it already was under Italian law, while other religions were tolerated), paid salaries to priests and bishops, gave civil recognition to church marriages (previously couples had to have a civil ceremony), and brought religious instruction into the public schools. In turn, the bishops swore allegiance to the Italian state, which had veto power over their selection. The Church was not officially obligated to support the Fascist regime; the strong differences remained, but the seething hostility ended. Friction continued over the Catholic Action youth network, which Mussolini wanted to merge into his Fascist youth group.

The third document in the agreement paid the Vatican 1.75 billion lira (about $100 million) for the seizures of church property since 1860. Pius XI invested the money in the stock markets and real estate. To manage these investments, the Pope appointed the lay-person Bernardino Nogara, who, through shrewd investing in stocks, gold, and futures markets, significantly increased the Catholic Church&#x27;s financial holdings. The income largely paid for the upkeep of the expensive-to-maintain stock of historic buildings in the Vatican which until 1870 had been maintained through funds raised from the Papal States.
The Vatican&#x27;s relationship with Mussolini&#x27;s government deteriorated drastically after 1930 as Mussolini&#x27;s totalitarian ambitions began to impinge more and more on the autonomy of the Church. For example, the Fascists tried to absorb the Church&#x27;s youth groups. In response, Pius issued the encyclical &quot;Non abbiamo bisogno&quot; (&quot;We Have No Need)&quot; in 1931. It denounced the regime&#x27;s persecution of the church in Italy and condemned &quot;pagan worship of the State.&quot; It also condemned Fascism&#x27;s &quot;revolution which snatches the young from the Church and from Jesus Christ, and which inculcates in its own young people hatred, violence and irreverence&quot;.

From the earliest days of the Nazi takeover in Germany, the Vatican was taking diplomatic action to attempt to defend the Jews of Germany. In the spring of 1933, Pope Pius XI urged Mussolini to ask Hitler to restrain the anti-Semitic actions taking place in Germany. Mussolini urged Pius to excommunicate Hitler, as he thought it would render him less powerful in Catholic Austria and reduce the danger to Italy and wider Europe. The Vatican refused to comply and thereafter Mussolini began to work with Hitler, adopting his anti-Semitic and race theories. In 1936, with the Church in Germany facing clear persecution, Italy and Germany agreed to the Berlin-Rome Axis.

=== Relations with Germany and Austria ===

The Nazis, like the Pope, were unalterably opposed to Communism. In the years leading up to the 1933 election, the German bishops opposed the Nazi Party by proscribing German Catholics from joining and participating in it. This changed by the end of March after Cardinal Michael Von Faulhaber of Munich met with the Pope. One author claims that Pius expressed support for the regime soon after Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, with the author asserting that he said, &quot;I have changed my mind about Hitler, it is for the first time that such a government voice has been raised to denounce Bolshevism in such categorical terms, joining with the voice of the pope.&quot;

A threatening, though initially sporadic persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany followed the 1933 Nazi takeover in Germany. In the dying days of the Weimar Republic, the newly appointed Chancellor Adolf Hitler moved quickly to eliminate political Catholicism. Vice Chancellor Franz von Papen was dispatched to Rome to negotiate a Reich concordat with the Holy See. Ian Kershaw wrote that the Vatican was anxious to reach an agreement with the new government, despite &quot;continuing molestation of Catholic clergy, and other outrages committed by Nazi radicals against the Church and its organisations&quot;. Negotiations were conducted by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, who later became Pope Pius XII (1939–1958). The &quot;Reichskonkordat&quot; was signed by Pacelli and by the German government in June 1933, and included guarantees of liberty for the Church, independence for Catholic organisations and youth groups, and religious teaching in schools. The treaty was an extension of existing concordats already signed with Prussia and Bavaria, but wrote Hebblethwaite, it seemed &quot;more like a surrender than anything else: it involved the suicide of the [Catholic] Centre Party... &quot;.

&quot;The agreement&quot;, wrote William Shirer, &quot;was hardly put to paper before it was being broken by the Nazi Government&quot;. On 25 July, the Nazis promulgated their sterilization law, an offensive policy in the eyes of the Catholic Church. Five days later, moves began to dissolve the Catholic Youth League. Clergy, nuns and lay leaders began to be targeted, leading to thousands of arrests over the ensuing years, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or &quot;immorality&quot;.

In February 1936, Hitler sent Pius a telegram congratulating the Pope on the anniversary of his coronation, but Pius responded with criticisms of what was happening in Germany, so forcefully that the German foreign secretary Konstantin von Neurath wanted to suppress the response, but Pius insisted it be forwarded to Hitler.

==== Austria ====

The pope supported the Christian Socialists in Austria, a country with an overwhelmingly Catholic population but a powerful secular element. He especially supported the regime of Engelbert Dollfuss (1932–1934), who wanted to remold society based on papal encyclicals. Dollfuss suppressed the anti-clerical factions and the socialists, but was assassinated by Austrian Nazis in 1934. His successor Kurt von Schuschnigg (1934–1938) was also pro-Catholic and received Vatican support. The Anschluss saw the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in early 1938. 

At the direction of Cardinal Theodor Innitzer, the churches of Vienna pealed their bells and flew swastikas for Hitler&#x27;s arrival in the city on 14 March. However, wrote Mark Mazower, such gestures of accommodation were &quot;not enough to assuage the Austrian Nazi radicals, foremost among them the young Gauleiter Globocnik&quot;. Globocnik launched a campaign against the Church, confiscating property, closing Catholic organisations, and sending many priests to Dachau. Anger at the treatment of the Church in Austria grew quickly and October 1938, wrote Mazower, saw the &quot;very first act of overt mass resistance to the new regime&quot;, when a rally of thousands left Mass in Vienna chanting &quot;Christ is our Fuehrer&quot;, before being dispersed by police. A Nazi mob ransacked Cardinal Innitzer&#x27;s residence, after he denounced Nazi persecution of the Church. The American National Catholic Welfare Conference wrote that Pope Pius, &quot;again protested against the violence of the Nazis, in language recalling Nero and Judas the Betrayer, comparing Hitler with Julian the Apostate.&quot;

==== &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot; ====

The Nazis claimed jurisdiction over all collective and social activity and interfered with Catholic schooling, youth groups, workers&#x27; clubs and cultural societies. By early 1937, the church hierarchy in Germany, which had initially attempted to co-operate with the new government, had become highly disillusioned. In March, Pope Pius XI issued the encyclical &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot; accusing the Nazi Government of violations of the 1933 Concordat, and of sowing the &quot;tares of suspicion, discord, hatred, calumny, of secret and open fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church&quot;. The Pope noted on the horizon the &quot;threatening storm clouds&quot; of religious wars of extermination over Germany.

Copies had to be smuggled into Germany so they could be read from church pulpits.
The encyclical, the only one ever written in German, was addressed to German bishops and was read in all parishes of Germany. The text is credited to Munich Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber and to Cardinal Secretary of State Eugenio Pacelli, who later became Pope Pius XII.

There was no advance announcement of the encyclical, and its distribution was kept secret in an attempt to ensure the unhindered public reading of its contents in all the Catholic churches of Germany. The encyclical condemned particularly the paganism of Nazism, the myth of race and blood, and fallacies in the Nazi conception of God:

The Nazis responded with an intensification of their campaign against the churches, beginning around April. There were mass arrests of clergy and church presses were expropriated.

==== Response of the press and governments ====
While numerous German Catholics, including those who participated in the secret printing and distribution of the encyclical, went to jail and concentration camps, the Western democracies remained silent, which Pius XI labeled bitterly a &quot;conspiracy of silence&quot;. As the extreme nature of Nazi racial anti-Semitism became obvious, and as Mussolini in the late 1930s began imitating Hitler&#x27;s anti-Jewish race laws in Italy, Pius XI continued to make his position clear. After Fascist Italy&#x27;s Manifesto of Race was published, the pope said in a public address in the Vatican to Belgian pilgrims in 1938: &quot;Mark well that in the Catholic Mass, Abraham is our Patriarch and forefather. Anti-Semitism is incompatible with the lofty thought which that fact expresses. It is a movement with which we Christians can have nothing to do. No, no, I say to you it is impossible for a Christian to take part in anti-Semitism. It is inadmissible. Through Christ and in Christ we are the spiritual progeny of Abraham. Spiritually, we [Christians] are all Semites&quot;. These comments were reported by neither Osservatore Romano nor Vatican Radio. They were reported in Belgium on 14 September 1938 issue of La Libre Belgique and on 17 September 1938 issue of French Catholic daily La Croix. They were then published worldwide but had little resonance at the time in the secular media. The &quot;conspiracy of silence&quot; included not only the silence of secular powers against the horrors of Nazism but also their silence on the persecution of the Church in Mexico, the Soviet Union and Spain. Despite these public comments, Pius was reported to have suggested privately that the Church&#x27;s problems in those three countries were &quot;reinforced by the anti-Christian spirit of Judaism&quot;.

==== &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; ====

In 1933, when the new Nazi government began to instigate its program of anti-Semitism, Pius XI ordered the papal nuncio in Berlin, Cesare Orsenigo, to &quot;look into whether and how it may be possible to become involved&quot; in aiding Jews. Orsenigo proved ineffective in this, concerned more with anti-church Nazi policies, and how these might affect German Catholics.

On 11 November 1938, following the Nazi &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; pogrom, Pius XI joined Western leaders in condemning the pogrom. In response, the Nazis organised mass demonstrations against Catholics and Jews in Munich, and the Bavarian Gauleiter Adolf Wagner declared before 5,000 protesters: &quot;Every utterance the Pope makes in Rome is an incitement of the Jews throughout the world to agitate against Germany&quot;. On 21 November, in an address to the world&#x27;s Catholics, the Pope rejected the Nazi claim of racial superiority, and insisted instead that there is only a single human race. Robert Ley, the Nazi Minister of Labour declared the following day in Vienna: &quot;No compassion will be tolerated for the Jews. We deny the Pope&#x27;s statement that there is but one human race. The Jews are parasites.&quot; Catholic leaders, including Cardinal Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster of Milan, Cardinal Jozef-Ernest van Roey in Belgium and Cardinal Jean Verdier in Paris, backed the Pope&#x27;s strong condemnation of &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;.

=== Relations with East Asia ===
Under Pius XI, papal relations with East Asia were marked by the rise of the Japanese Empire to prominence, as well as the unification of China under Chiang Kai-shek. In 1922 he established the position of Apostolic Delegate to China, and the first person in that capacity was Celso Benigno Luigi Costantini. On 1 August 1928, the Pope addressed a message of support for the political unification of China. Following the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and the creation of Manchukuo, the Holy See recognized the new state. On 10 September 1938, the Pope held a reception at Castel Gandolfo for an official delegation from Manchukuo, headed by Manchukuoan Minister of Foreign Affairs Ts&#x27;ai Yün-sheng.

=== Involvement with American efforts ===

Mother Katharine Drexel, who founded the American order of Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament for Indians and Colored People, corresponded with Pius XI, as she had with his papal predecessors. (In 1887, Pope Leo XIII had encouraged Katharine Drexel—then a young Philadelphia socialite— to do missionary work with America&#x27;s disadvantaged people of color). In the early 1930s, Mother Drexel wrote Pius XI asking him to bless a publicity campaign to acquaint white Catholics with the needs of the disadvantaged races among them. An emissary had shown him photos of Xavier University, a college for blacks in New Orleans which Mother Drexel had founded to provide higher education to Catholic African-Americans. Pius XI replied promptly, sending his blessing and encouragement. Upon his return, the emissary told Mother Katharine that the Pope said he had read the novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; as a boy, and it had ignited his lifelong concern for the American Negro.
=== Brazil ===
In 1930, Pius XI declared the Immaculate Conception under the title of Our Lady of Aparecida as the Queen and Patroness of Brazil.

=== Persecution of Christians ===

Pius XI was faced with unprecedented persecution of the Catholic Church in Mexico and Spain and with the persecution of all Christians, especially the Eastern Catholic Churches, in the Soviet Union. He called this the &quot;terrible triangle&quot;.

==== Soviet Union ====
Worried by the persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union, Pius XI mandated Berlin nuncio Eugenio Pacelli to work secretly on diplomatic arrangements between the Vatican and the Soviet Union. Pacelli negotiated food shipments for Russia and met with Soviet representatives, including Foreign Minister Georgi Chicherin, who rejected any kind of religious education and the ordination of priests and bishops but offered agreements without the points vital to the Vatican. Despite Vatican pessimism and a lack of visible progress, Pacelli continued the secret negotiations, until Pius XI ordered them discontinued in 1927 because they generated no results and would be dangerous to the Church if made public.

The &quot;harsh persecution short of total annihilation of the clergy, monks, and nuns and other people associated with the Church&quot;, continued well into the 1930s. In addition to executing and exiling many clerics, monks and laymen, the confiscation of Church implements &quot;for victims of famine&quot; and the closing of churches were common. Yet according to an official report based on the census of 1936, some 55% of Soviet citizens identified themselves openly as religious.

==== Mexico ====

During the pontificate of Pius XI, the Catholic Church was subjected to extreme persecutions in Mexico, which resulted in the death of over 5,000 priests, bishops and followers. In the state of Tabasco the Church was in effect outlawed altogether. In his encyclical &quot;Iniquis afflictisque&quot; from 18 November 1926, Pope Pius protested against the slaughter and persecution. The United States intervened in 1929 and moderated an agreement. The persecutions resumed in 1931. Pius XI condemned the Mexican government again in his 1932 encyclical &quot;Acerba animi&quot;. Problems continued with reduced hostilities until 1940, when in the new pontificate of Pope Pius XII President Manuel Ávila Camacho returned the Mexican churches to the Catholic Church.

There were 4,500 Mexican priests serving Mexican believers before the rebellion. In 1934 over 90% of them suffered persecution as only 334 priests were licensed by the government to serve fifteen million people. Excluding foreign religious, over 4,100 Mexican priests were eliminated by emigration, expulsion and assassination. By 1935, 17 Mexican states were left with no priests at all.

==== Spain ====

The Republican government which came to power in Spain in 1931 was strongly anti-clerical, secularising education, prohibiting religious education in the schools, and expelling the Jesuits from the country. On Pentecost 1932, Pope Pius XI protested against these measures and demanded restitution.

== Syro-Malankara Catholic Church ==
Pius XI accepted the Reunion Movement of Mar Ivanios along with four other members of the Malankara Orthodox Church in 1930. As a result of the Reunion Movement, the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church is in full communion with the Bishop of Rome and the Catholic Church.

== Condemnation of racism ==
The Fascist government in Italy abstained from copying Germany&#x27;s racial and anti-Semitic laws and regulations until 1938, when Italy introduced anti-Semitic legislation. In a public speech, the Pope sought to dissuade Italy from adopting demeaning racist legislation, stating that the term &quot;race&quot; is divisive, more appropriate to differentiate animals. He said the Catholic view sees instead &quot;the unity of human society&quot; whose differences are like the different tones in music. Italy, a civilized country, should not be led by the barbarian German legislation. He also criticized the Italian government for attacking Catholic Action and even the papacy itself.

In April 1938, at the request of Pius XI, the Sacred Congregation of seminaries and universities developed a syllabus condemning racist theories. Its publication was postponed.

In one historian&#x27;s view:

=== &quot;Humani generis unitas&quot; ===
Pius XI planned an encyclical &quot;Humani generis unitas&quot; (The Unity of the Human Race) to denounce racism in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, as well as antisemitism, colonialism and violent German nationalism. He died without issuing it. Pius XI&#x27;s successor, Pius XII, who was not aware of the draft encyclical, chose not to publish it. However, Pius XII&#x27;s first encyclical &quot;Summi Pontificatus&quot; (&quot;On the Supreme Pontificate&quot;, 12 October 1939), published after the beginning of World War II, bore the subtitle &quot;On the Unity of Human Society&quot; and used many of the arguments of the document drafted for Pius XI, while avoiding its negative characterizations of the Jewish people.

To denounce racism and anti-Semitism, Pius XI sought out the American journalist priest John LaFarge and summoned him to Castel Gandolfo on 25 June 1938. The pope told the Jesuit that he planned to write an encyclical denouncing racism, and asked LaFarge to help write it while swearing him to strict silence. LaFarge took up this task in secret in Paris, but the Jesuit Superior-General Wlodimir Ledóchowski promised the pope and LaFarge that he would facilitate the encyclical&#x27;s production. This proved to be a hindrance since Ledóchowski was privately an anti-Semite and conspired to block LaFarge&#x27;s efforts whenever and wherever possible. In late September 1938, the Jesuit had finished his work and returned to Rome, where Ledóchowski welcomed him and promised to deliver the work to the pope immediately. LaFarge was directed to return to the United States, while Ledóchowski concealed the draft from the pope, who remained wholly unaware of what had transpired.

But in the fall of 1938, LaFarge had realized the Pope still had not received the draft and sent a letter to Pius XI where he implied that Ledóchowski had the document in his possession. Pius XI demanded that the draft be delivered to him, but did not receive it until 21 January 1939 with a note from Ledóchowski, who warned that the draft&#x27;s language was excessive and advised caution. Pius XI planned to issue the encyclical following his meeting with bishops on 11 February, but died before both the meeting and encyclical&#x27;s promulgation could take place.

== Personality ==
Pius XI was seen as a blunt-spoken and no-nonsense man, qualities he shared with Pope Pius X. He was passionate about science and was fascinated with the power of radio, which would soon result in the founding and inauguration of Vatican Radio. He was intrigued by new forms of technology that he employed during his pontificate. He was also known for a rare smile.

Pius XI was known to have a temper at times and was someone who had a keen sense of knowledge and dignity of the office he held. In keeping with a papal tradition discarded by his immediate predecessors he insisted that he eat alone with no one around him and would not allow his assistants or any other priests or clergy to dine with him. He would frequently meet with political figures but would always greet them seated. He insisted that when his brother and sister wanted to see him, they had to refer to him as &quot;Your Holiness&quot; and book an appointment.

Pius XI was also a very demanding individual, certainly one of the stricter pontiffs at that time. He held very high standards and did not tolerate any sort of behaviour that was not up to that standard. In regard to Angelo Roncalli, the future Pope John XXIII, a diplomatic blunder in Bulgaria, where Roncalli was stationed, led Pius XI to make Roncalli kneel for 45 minutes as a punishment. However, when in due course Pius learned that Roncalli had made the error in circumstances for which he could not fairly be considered culpable, he apologized to him. Aware of the implied impropriety of a Supreme Pontiff&#x27;s going back on a reprimand in a matter concerning Catholic faith and morals, but also deeply conscious that on a human level he had failed to keep his temper in check, he made his apology &quot;as Achille Ratti&quot; and in doing so stretched out his hand in friendship to Monsignor Roncalli.

== Death and burial ==
Pius XI had been ill for some time when, on 25 November 1938, he suffered two heart attacks within several hours. He had serious breathing problems and could not leave his apartment. He gave his last major pontifical address to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, which he had founded, speaking without a prepared text on the relation between science and the Catholic religion. Medical specialists reported that heart insufficiency combined with bronchial attacks had hopelessly complicated his already poor prospects.

Pius XI died at 5:31 a.m. (Rome time) of a third heart attack on 10 February 1939, at the age of 81. His last words to those near him at the time of his death were spoken with clarity and firmness: &quot;My soul parts from you all in peace.&quot; Some believe he was murdered, based on the fact that his primary physician, Francesco Petacci, was the father of Claretta Petacci, Mussolini&#x27;s mistress. Cardinal Eugène Tisserant wrote in his diary that the pope had been murdered, a claim that Carlo Confalonieri later strongly denied.

The Pope&#x27;s last audible words were reported to have been &quot;peace, peace&quot;. Those at his bedside at 4:00 am realized that his end was near, at which stage the sacrist was summoned to administer the final sacrament 11 minutes before the pope&#x27;s death. The pontiff&#x27;s confessor Cardinal Lorenzo Lauri arrived a few seconds too late. After his final words, the pope&#x27;s lips moved slowly. Rocchi said it was possible to discern that the pope was making an effort to recite a Latin prayer. About half a minute before his death, Pius XI raised his right hand weakly and tried making the sign of the Cross to impart his last blessing to those gathered at his bedside. One of the last things he was reported to have said was &quot;We still had so many things to do&quot;. He died among a low murmur of psalms recited by those present. Upon his death, his face was covered by a white veil. Pacelli, in accordance with his duties as Camerlengo, lifted the veil and gently struck the pope&#x27;s forehead three times with a small, ceremonial silver hammer, reciting his Christian name (Achille) and pausing for an answer to confirm that the pope had died, before turning to those present and in Latin saying: &quot;Truly the pope is dead.&quot;

Upon Pius XI&#x27;s death, the Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury Cosmo Lang paid tribute to his efforts for world peace, calling him a man of &quot;sincere piety&quot; who bore his duties with exceptional &quot;dignity and courage&quot;. Others who sent messages of condolences were Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, the former visiting the Vatican to pay his respects. Flags were flown half-staff in Rome, Paris, and Berlin.

Pius XI&#x27;s body was placed in a wooden coffin, placed in a bronze casket, which was then placed in a lead casket. The casket was designed by Antonio Berti. Pius XI was buried in the crypt of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica on 14 February 1939, in the Chapel of Saint Sebastian, close to Saint Peter&#x27;s tomb. The day of the funeral was a day of mourning in Italy and Ireland. His tomb was modified in 1944 to be more ornate.

== Legacy==

Pius XI is remembered as the pope who reigned between the two great wars of the 20th century. As the onetime librarian who reorganized the Vatican archives, nevertheless, he was hardly a withdrawn and bookish figure. He also refounded the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in 1936, with the aim of turning it into the &quot;scientific senate&quot; of the Church. Hostile to any form of ethnic or religious discrimination, he appointed over 80 academicians from various countries, backgrounds, and areas of research. In his honor, John XXIII established the Pius XI Medal, which the Council of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences awards to a young scientist under 45 who has distinguished himself or herself at the international level.

Pius was also a well-known mountain climber with many peaks in the Alps named after him, he having been the first to scale them. A Chilean glacier bears Pius XI&#x27;s name. In 1942, Bishop T. B. Pearson founded the Achille Ratti Climbing Club, based in the United Kingdom and named for Pius XI.

The Syro-Malankara Catholic Church founded a school in his name in Kattanam, Alappuzha, Kerala, India (Pope Pius XI Higher Secondary School, Kattanam).

Pius XI High School in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, founded in 1929, is named in honor of the pontiff.

<text>Pope Pius VIII (; born Francesco Saverio Maria Felice Castiglioni; 20 November 1761 – 30 November 1830) was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 31 March 1829 to his death in November 1830.

Pius VIII&#x27;s pontificate was the shortest of the 19th century, and is likely the least remembered. His brief papacy witnessed the Catholic Emancipation in the United Kingdom in 1829, which he welcomed, and the July Revolution in France in 1830, which he reluctantly accepted. Pius VIII is often remembered for his writings on marriages between Catholics and Protestants: in the 1830 brief &quot;Litteris altero abhinc&quot;, he declared that a marriage could only be properly blessed if proper provisions had been made to ensure the bringing up of children in the Catholic faith. His death, less than two years after his election to the papacy, has led to speculation of a possible murder.

==Early life==
Francesco Saverio Castiglioni was born in Cingoli, Marche, the third of eight children of Count Ottavio Castiglioni (1714 - 1804) and his wife Sanzia/Sancia Teresa Ghislieri. His brother Filippo Giulio Castiglioni (1774 - 1846) married and had Radegonda Nazzarena Castiglioni, born in 1810, who was married to a maternal nephew of Pope Pius IX. His baptismal name was recorded as Francesco Saverio Maria Felice. An ancestor of his was Pope Celestine IV. He studied at the Collegio Campana run by the Society of Jesus and, after that, at the University of Bologna, where he earned a doctorate in canon and civil law (&quot;utroque iure&quot;) in 1785. He was ordained to the priesthood in Rome on 17 December 1785.

He served as the Vicar General of Anagni (1788–1790), Fano (1790–1797) and Ascoli Piceno (1797–1800).

==Episcopate and cardinalate==
On 11 August 1800 Castiglioni was appointed Bishop of Montalto. He received episcopal consecration on 17 August in Rome at the Church of Santi Domenico e Sisto. Cardinal Giuseppe Doria Pamphili served as consecrator, assisted by Nicola Buschi and Camillo Campanelli. He refused to swear allegiance to Napoleon or to his client state, the Kingdom of Italy. On 29 July 1808 he was arrested and taken to Milan. Castiglioni was subsequently taken to Pavia, to Mantua, and then to Turin, where he arrived on 10 November 1813. On 18 November he was brought back to Milan. Finally, after Napoleon fell, Castiglioni returned to his diocese on 16 June 1814. He was praised by Pope Pius VII who in 1816 elevated him to the cardinalate as the Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Traspontina. He held various high offices thereafter, including that of Apostolic Penitentiary. He soon became a Cardinal-Bishop of the suburbicarian see of Frascati.

Castiglioni was considered a front-runner in the conclave of 1823. He was known to be close to Pius VII, who often referred to Castiglioni as &quot;Pius VIII&quot;. However, he failed to gain the necessary votes, in part due to controversy surrounding an alliance between him and another favorite, Secretary of State Ercole Consalvi. Annibale Cardinal della Genga was elected instead, and he took the name of Pope Leo XII.

== Papacy ==
=== Election ===
After the death of Pope Leo XII in 1829, Castiglioni, who had all the qualities and skills required to be pope, was again considered to be a major candidate, though was questioned due to his frail health and age. Despite these concerns, he was elected as pope in the papal conclave of 1829. Given that Pope Pius VII had referred to him as Pius VIII, it seemed only suitable that it was the pontifical name that he chose. He was crowned on 5 April 1829 by Cardinal Giuseppe Albani.

Throughout the conclave, Cardinal Albani settled on proposing Castiglioni as a candidate for the papacy on the basis that his infirmities and age would see a short papacy in which he could persuade the ailing pontiff to hand over aspects of governance to himself. This was on the basis that Albani did not desire to be pope, but rather to be appointed as Cardinal Secretary of State in which he would hold power in terms of ecclesial governance. Albani approached Castiglioni with his offer, drawing up an agreement which Castiglioni signed without demur. With Castiglioni elected, Albani ended up being appointed to his desired posting.

When the conclave opened, the French cardinals were told that the French court would support seven cardinals for the papacy, which included Castiglioni. King Charles X had a very positive opinion of Castiglioni, and favored either Castiglioni, Placido Zurla, Emmanuele de Gregorio, or Cesare Brancadoro to become pope. Castiglioni led in the first ballot with eleven votes, and on 4 March in his capacity as the Major Penitentiary distributed ashes to the cardinals since it was Ash Wednesday. While there were whispers of a faction supporting de Gregorio, a faction consisting of Cardinals Antonio Maria Frosini, Carlo Maria Pedicini, Antonio Palotta, Tommaso Maria Raimondo Leopoldo Arezzo, and Agostino Rivarola was said to have started shoring up support for Castiglioni. On 6 March, de Gregorio was still in the lead, with Castiglioni receiving fifteen votes in the afternoon scrutiny. Due to a series of controversies surrounding de Gregorio throughout the day, de Gregorio&#x27;s votes had fallen on 7 March, while Castiglioni received fourteen in the morning and fifteen in the afternoon. On 14 March, Castiglioni received 20 votes in the morning and 23 in the afternoon, while fluctuating on 15 and 16 March. Castiglioni received 22 votes in the 20 March morning vote while Bartolomeo Pacca&#x27;s votes increased that afternoon from 11 to 19 in a bid to end the deadlock and elect a compromise candidate. Castiglioni&#x27;s voting total remained the same on the following day.

In the morning vote on 23 March, he had received 24 votes and received 26 in the afternoon. Meanwhile, Cappellari received 19 votes that had originally been cast for Pacca due to his supporters deciding upon him as an amenable compromise and because Pacca was officially vetoed. On 24 March, Cardinals Carlo Oppizzoni and Fabrizio Sceberras Testaferrata, from different factions, were both privately in agreement to canvass additional support for Castiglioni. While Cappellari received 22 votes in an indication that his candidacy was improving, Castiglioni received 23 votes while de Gregorio had sunk to two votes. On 26 March, in the afternoon scrutiny, de Gregorio had suddenly risen to 24 votes while Castiglione had sunk to 14 or 15. He sunk to 13 on 28 March, though the results changed on 30 March in which de Gregorio had secured 23 votes and Castiglioni had secured just over 25 in the morning, only for both candidates to sink in the afternoon scrutiny. On 31 March, he had secured 28 votes with a clear lead, and barely had two-thirds majority in the morning ballot. In the next ballot, Castiglioni was elected as pope with 47 votes.

=== Modernism and Biblical translations ===
As Pope Pius VIII, he initiated some reforms in the Papal States. On 24 May 1829 he issued an encyclical, &quot;Traditi humilitati&quot;. Regarding religious pluralism, he condemned the &quot;foul contrivance of the sophists of this age&quot; that would place Catholicism on a par with any other religion. Regarding Bible translations, he wrote in that encyclical:
On 25 March 1830, in the brief &quot;Litteris altero&quot;, he condemned the masonic secret societies and modernist biblical translations. 

A further letter of pastoral concern sent to the Upper Rhineland bishops, which Pius wrote at the end of June 1830, is referred to by his successor Gregory XVI in the latter&#x27;s papal brief &quot;Quo Graviora&quot; of 1833. Gregory refers to a request for information on the bishops&#x27; actions in response, which he says &quot;though three years have elapsed&quot;, had not yet been received.

===Marriage===
Pius accepted the situation on mixed marriages between Protestants and Catholics in Germany, but he opposed changes in Ireland and Poland, which were still strongly Catholic. In his brief &quot;Litteris altero abhinc&quot;, he declared that a mixed marriage could only be blessed by a priest if proper promises had been made to educate the children of the marriage as Catholics. However, the brief also which allowed priests to offer &quot;passive assistance&quot; at a mixed marriage ceremony when the non-Catholic party declined to make the oath providing for the children of the marriage to be brought up as Catholics. The provision for &quot;passive assistance&quot; meant that a priest could conduct a wedding, acting as a witness, but the marriage would not be blessed or seen as a sacrament.

===Organisation of Catholic dioceses===
The Holy See&#x27;s website refers to three papal briefs (&quot;breve&quot;) bearing the name &quot;Inter multiplices&quot;:
*a brief of 15 May 1829 establishing the Diocese of Mobile, at that time covering the states of Alabama and Florida.
*a brief of 11 August 1829 separating the pastoral care of Prince Edward Island (PEI), New Brunswick and the Magdalen Islands in Canada from the Diocese of Quebec, creating a new episcopal see based in Charlottetown, PEI.
*a brief of 4 September 1829 separating the territory of Cape Breton from the Diocese of Quebec and placing it in the care of the Apostolic Vicar of Nova Scotia.
In the last of these letters, he wrote that his concern for &quot;the state of the Dioceses distributed over the entire earth&quot; occupied a place second to none among his cares.

===Consistories===
Pius VIII also held three consistories in which he elevated a total of six men into the cardinalate. He held these ceremonies on 27 July 1829, 15 March 1830 and 5 July 1830. Pius VIII also nominated eight cardinals &quot;&quot;in pectore&quot; in the March 1830 consistory, however, he never publicly revealed the names before his death hence rendering the appointments moot.

===Beatifications===
He canonized no saints during his brief pontificate but he beatified two individuals. On 23 December 1829 he beatified Benincasa da Montepulciano, and on 4 March 1830 he beatified Chiara Gambacorti. Pius VIII proclaimed Saint Bernard of Clairvaux a Doctor of the Church on 20 August 1830, titling him as &quot;Doctor mellifluus&quot;&quot; (&quot;Mellifluous Doctor&quot;).

=== Other activities ===

Pius&#x27; brief pontificate saw the Catholic Emancipation in the United Kingdom and the July Revolution in France, which occurred in 1829 and 1830, respectively. Pius VIII recognised Louis Philippe I (1830–48) as French king and allowed him to use the French king&#x27;s customary title &quot;Roi Très Chrétien&quot;, which means &quot;His Most Christian Majesty&quot;.

Also of remarkable importance to the future is a letter of his to a French bishop, in which he allowed the taking of moderate interest (under the principle of foregoing a profit by investing the lent capital; see &quot;Vix pervenit&quot; for the discussion of the topic).

Being, at that time, head of the Papal States, he remained popular for decades for removing the so-called &quot;cancelletti&quot; (grids) from the taverns, which Leo XII had ordered to be put there to hinder the consumption of wine unless accompanied by a meal. A poem was written about him that ran thus:which in English roughly reads: At the time when the highest Pius / approached God in the highest / He asked him: What have you got done? / He answered: &quot;There&#x27;s nothing I&#x27;ve got done.&quot; / But the angels present knew better: / &quot;He cancelled the cancelletter&quot;.

=== Health and death ===

Pius VIII was in very poor health during most of his papacy. He became very ill in early November 1830, developing fistulas on his neck and knee while his entire body became covered with pustules, which the doctors were able to manage by 15 November. Pius VIII became seriously ill again on 23 November, had difficulties in breathing for the following three nights, and was given the Viaticum on 28 November and the Extreme Unction later that day at 9:30pm. He died on 30 November 1830 at the age of 69 in the Quirinal Palace in Rome.

Certain theories have emerged suggesting that Pius VIII was poisoned, but no proof has been found to verify this claim.

Cardinal Camillo di Pietro gave the funeral oration for the late pope, before the cardinals entered the conclave to choose a successor. Pius VIII was succeeded by Pope Gregory XVI.

<doc id="147860" wikidata="Q1792644" url="?curid=147860" title="Style (visual arts)">
<text>In the visual arts, style is a &quot;...distinctive manner which permits the grouping of works into related categories&quot; or &quot;...any distinctive, and therefore recognizable, way in which an act is performed or an artifact made or ought to be performed and made&quot;. Style refers to the visual appearance of a work of art that relates to other works with similar aesthetic roots, by the same artist, or from the same period, training, location, &quot;school&quot;, art movement or archaeological culture: &quot;The notion of style has long been historian&#x27;s principal mode of classifying works of art&quot;.
Style can be divided into the general style of a period, country or cultural group, group of artists or art movement, and the individual style of the artist within that group style. Divisions within both types of styles are often made, such as between &quot;early&quot;, &quot;middle&quot; or &quot;late&quot;. In some artists, such as Picasso for example, these divisions may be marked and easy to see; in others, they are more subtle. Style is seen as usually dynamic, in most periods always changing by a gradual process, though the speed of this varies greatly, from the very slow development in style typical of prehistoric art or Ancient Egyptian art to the rapid changes in Modern art styles. Style often develops in a series of jumps, with relatively sudden changes followed by periods of slower development.

After dominating academic discussion in art history in the 19th and early 20th centuries, so-called &quot;style art history&quot; has come under increasing attack in recent decades, and many art historians now prefer to avoid stylistic classifications where they can.

==Overview==
Any piece of art is in theory capable of being analysed in terms of style; neither periods nor artists can avoid having a style, except by complete incompetence, and conversely natural objects or sights cannot be said to have a style, as style only results from choices made by a maker. Whether the artist makes a conscious choice of style, or can identify his own style, hardly matters. Artists in recent developed societies tend to be highly conscious of their own style, arguably over-conscious, whereas for earlier artists stylistic choices were probably &quot;largely unselfconscious&quot;.

Most stylistic periods are identified and defined later by art historians, but artists may choose to define and name their own style. The names of most older styles are the invention of art historians and would not have been understood by the practitioners of those styles. Some originated as terms of derision, including Gothic, Baroque, and Rococo. Cubism on the other hand was a conscious identification made by a few artists; the word itself seems to have originated with critics rather than painters, but was rapidly accepted by the artists.

Western art, like that of some other cultures, most notably Chinese art, has a marked tendency to revive at intervals &quot;classic&quot; styles from the past. In critical analysis of the visual arts, the style of a work of art is typically treated as distinct from its iconography, which covers the subject and the &quot;content&quot; of the work, though for Jas Elsner this distinction is &quot;not, of course, true in any actual example; but it has proved rhetorically extremely useful&quot;.

==History of the concept==

Classical art criticism and the relatively few medieval writings on aesthetics did not greatly develop a concept of style in art, or analysis of it, and though Renaissance and Baroque writers on art are greatly concerned with what we would call style, they did not develop a coherent theory of it, at least outside architecture:

Artistic styles shift with cultural conditions; a self-evident truth to any modern art historian, but an extraordinary idea in this period [Early Renaissance and earlier]. Nor is it clear that any such idea was articulated in antiquity... Pliny was attentive to changes in ways of art-making, but he presented such changes as driven by technology and wealth. Vasari, too, attributes the strangeness and, in his view the deficiencies, of earlier art to lack of technological know-how and cultural sophistication.

Giorgio Vasari set out a hugely influential but much-questioned account of the development of style in Italian painting (mainly) from Giotto to his own Mannerist period. He stressed the development of a Florentine style based on &quot;disegno&quot; or line-based drawing, rather than Venetian colour. With other Renaissance theorists like Leon Battista Alberti he continued classical debates over the best balance in art between the realistic depiction of nature and idealization of it; this debate was to continue until the 19th century and the advent of Modernism.

The theorist of Neoclassicism, Johann Joachim Winckelmann, analysed the stylistic changes in Greek classical art in 1764, comparing them closely to the changes in Renaissance art, and &quot;Georg Hegel codified the notion that each historical period will have a typical style&quot;, casting a very long shadow over the study of style. Hegel is often attributed with the invention of the German word &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;, but he never actually used the word, although in &quot;Lectures on the Philosophy of History&quot;, he uses the phrase &quot;der Geist seiner Zeit&quot; (the spirit of his time), writing that &quot;no man can surpass his own time, for the spirit of his time is also his own spirit.&quot;

Constructing schemes of the period styles of historic art and architecture was a major concern of 19th century scholars in the new and initially mostly German-speaking field of art history, with important writers on the broad theory of style including Carl Friedrich von Rumohr, Gottfried Semper, and Alois Riegl in his &quot;Stilfragen&quot; of 1893, with Heinrich Wölfflin and Paul Frankl continuing the debate in the 20th century. Paul Jacobsthal and Josef Strzygowski are among the art historians who followed Riegl in proposing grand schemes tracing the transmission of elements of styles across great ranges in time and space. This type of art history is also known as formalism, or the study of forms or shapes in art.

Semper, Wölfflin, and Frankl, and later Ackerman, had backgrounds in the history of architecture, and like many other terms for period styles, &quot;Romanesque&quot; and &quot;Gothic&quot; were initially coined to describe architectural styles, where major changes between styles can be clearer and more easy to define, not least because style in architecture is easier to replicate by following a set of rules than style in figurative art such as painting. Terms originated to describe architectural periods were often subsequently applied to other areas of the visual arts, and then more widely still to music, literature and the general culture.

In architecture stylistic change often follows, and is made possible by, the discovery of new techniques or materials, from the Gothic rib vault to modern metal and reinforced concrete construction. A major area of debate in both art history and archaeology has been the extent to which stylistic change in other fields like painting or pottery is also a response to new technical possibilities, or has its own impetus to develop (the &quot;kunstwollen&quot; of Riegl), or changes in response to social and economic factors affecting patronage and the conditions of the artist, as current thinking tends to emphasize, using less rigid versions of Marxist art history.

Although style was well-established as a central component of art historical analysis, seeing it as the over-riding factor in art history had fallen out of fashion by World War II, as other ways of looking at art were developing, as well as a reaction against the emphasis on style; for Svetlana Alpers, &quot;the normal invocation of style in art history is a depressing affair indeed&quot;. According to James Elkins &quot;In the later 20th century criticisms of style were aimed at further reducing the Hegelian elements of the concept while retaining it in a form that could be more easily controlled&quot;. Meyer Schapiro, James Ackerman, Ernst Gombrich and George Kubler (&quot;The Shape of Time: Remarks on the History of Things&quot;, 1962) have made notable contributions to the debate, which has also drawn on wider developments in critical theory. In 2010 Jas Elsner put it more strongly: &quot;For nearly the whole of the 20th century, style art history has been the indisputable king of the discipline, but since the revolutions of the seventies and eighties the king has been dead&quot;, though his article explores ways in which &quot;style art history&quot; remains alive, and his comment would hardly be applicable to archaeology.

The use of terms such as Counter-&quot;Maniera&quot; appears to be in decline, as impatience with such &quot;style labels&quot; grows among art historians. In 2000 Marcia B. Hall, a leading art historian of 16th-century Italian painting and mentee of Sydney Joseph Freedberg (1914–1997), who invented the term, was criticised by a reviewer of her &quot;After Raphael: Painting in Central Italy in the Sixteenth Century&quot; for her &quot;fundamental flaw&quot; in continuing to use this and other terms, despite an apologetic &quot;Note on style labels&quot; at the beginning of the book and a promise to keep their use to a minimum. 
A rare recent attempt to create a theory to explain the process driving changes in artistic style, rather than just theories of how to describe and categorize them, is by the behavioural psychologist Colin Martindale, who has proposed an evolutionary theory based on Darwinian principles. However this cannot be said to have gained much support among art historians.

==Individual style==

Traditional art history has also placed great emphasis on the individual style, sometimes called the signature style, of an artist: &quot;the notion of personal style—that individuality can be uniquely expressed not only in the way an artist draws, but also in the stylistic quirks of an author&#x27;s writing (for instance)— is perhaps an axiom of Western notions of identity&quot;. The identification of individual styles is especially important in the attribution of works to artists, which is a dominant factor in their valuation for the art market, above all for works in the Western tradition since the Renaissance. The identification of individual style in works is &quot;essentially assigned to a group of specialists in the field known as connoisseurs&quot;, a group who centre in the art trade and museums, often with tensions between them and the community of academic art historians.

The exercise of connoisseurship is largely a matter of subjective impressions that are hard to analyse, but also a matter of knowing details of technique and the &quot;hand&quot; of different artists. Giovanni Morelli (1816 – 1891) pioneered the systematic study of the scrutiny of diagnostic minor details that revealed artists&#x27; scarcely conscious shorthand and conventions for portraying, for example, ears or hands, in Western old master paintings. His techniques were adopted by Bernard Berenson and others, and have been applied to sculpture and many other types of art, for example by Sir John Beazley to Attic vase painting. Personal techniques can be important in analysing individual style. Though artists&#x27; training was before Modernism essentially imitative, relying on taught technical methods, whether learnt as an apprentice in a workshop or later as a student in an academy, there was always room for personal variation. The idea of technical &quot;secrets&quot; closely guarded by the master who developed them, is a long-standing &quot;topos&quot; in art history from Vasari&#x27;s probably mythical account of Jan van Eyck to the secretive habits of Georges Seurat. 
However the idea of personal style is certainly not limited to the Western tradition. In Chinese art it is just as deeply held, but traditionally regarded as a factor in the appreciation of some types of art, above all calligraphy and literati painting, but not others, such as Chinese porcelain; a distinction also often seen in the so-called decorative arts in the West. Chinese painting also allowed for the expression of political and social views by the artist a good deal earlier than is normally detected in the West. Calligraphy, also regarded as a fine art in the Islamic world and East Asia, brings a new area within the ambit of personal style; the ideal of Western calligraphy tends to be to suppress individual style, while graphology, which relies upon it, regards itself as a science.

The painter Edward Edwards said in his &quot;Anecdotes of Painters&quot; (1808): &quot;Mr. Gainsborough&#x27;s manner of penciling was so peculiar to himself, that his work needed no signature&quot;. Examples of strongly individual styles include: the Cubist art of Pablo Picasso, the Pop Art style of Andy Warhol, Impressionist style of Vincent Van Gogh, Drip Painting by Jackson Pollock

==Manner==
&quot;Manner&quot; is a related term, often used for what is in effect a sub-division of a style, perhaps focused on particular points of style or technique. While many elements of period style can be reduced to characteristic forms or shapes, that can adequately be represented in simple line-drawn diagrams, &quot;manner&quot; is more often used to mean the overall style and atmosphere of a work, especially complex works such as paintings, that cannot so easily be subject to precise analysis. It is a somewhat outdated term in academic art history, avoided because it is imprecise. When used it is often in the context of imitations of the individual style of an artist, and it is one of the hierarchy of discreet or diplomatic terms used in the art trade for the relationship between a work for sale and that of a well-known artist, with &quot;Manner of Rembrandt&quot; suggesting a distanced relationship between the style of the work and Rembrandt&#x27;s own style. The &quot;Explanation of Cataloguing Practice&quot; of the auctioneers Christie&#x27;s&#x27; explains that &quot;Manner of...&quot; in their auction catalogues means &quot;In our opinion a work executed in the artist&#x27;s style but of a later date&quot;. Mannerism, derived from the Italian &quot;maniera&quot; (&quot;manner&quot;) is a specific phase of the general Renaissance style, but &quot;manner&quot; can be used very widely.

==Style in archaeology==
In archaeology, despite modern techniques like radiocarbon dating, period or cultural style remains a crucial tool in the identification and dating not only of works of art but all classes of archaeological artefact, including purely functional ones (ignoring the question of whether purely functional artefacts exist). The identification of individual styles of artists or artisans has also been proposed in some cases even for remote periods such as the Ice Age art of the European Upper Paleolithic.

As in art history, formal analysis of the morphology (shape) of individual artefacts is the starting point. This is used to construct typologies for different types of artefacts, and by the technique of seriation a relative dating based on style for a site or group of sites is achieved where scientific absolute dating techniques cannot be used, in particular where only stone, ceramic or metal artefacts or remains are available, which is often the case. Sherds of pottery are often very numerous in sites from many cultures and periods, and even small pieces may be confidently dated by their style. In contrast to recent trends in academic art history, the succession of schools of archaeological theory in the last century, from culture-historical archaeology to processual archaeology and finally the rise of post-processual archaeology in recent decades has not significantly reduced the importance of the study of style in archaeology, as a basis for classifying objects before further interpretation.

==Stylization==

Stylization and stylized (or stylisation and stylised in (non-Oxford) British English, respectively) have a more specific meaning, referring to visual depictions that use simplified ways of representing objects or scenes that do not attempt a full, precise and accurate representation of their visual appearance (&quot;mimesis&quot; or &quot;realistic&quot;), preferring an attractive or expressive overall depiction. More technically, it has been defined as &quot;the decorative generalization of figures and objects by means of various conventional techniques, including the simplification of line, form, and relationships of space and color&quot;, and observed that &quot;[s]tylized art reduces visual perception to constructs of pattern in line, surface elaboration and flattened space&quot;.

Ancient, traditional, and modern art, as well as popular forms such as cartoons or animation very often use stylized representations, so for example &quot;The Simpsons&quot; use highly stylized depictions, as does traditional African art. The two Picasso paintings illustrated at the top of this page show a movement to a more stylized representation of the human figure within the painter&#x27;s style, and the Uffington White Horse is an example of a highly stylized prehistoric depiction of a horse. Motifs in the decorative arts such as the palmette or arabesque are often highly stylized versions of the parts of plants.

Even in art that is in general attempting mimesis or &quot;realism&quot;, a degree of stylization is very often found in details, and especially figures or other features at a small scale, such as people or trees etc. in the distant background even of a large work. But this is not stylization intended to be noticed by the viewer, except on close examination. Drawings, &quot;modelli&quot;, and other sketches not intended as finished works for sale will also very often stylize.

&quot;Stylized&quot; may mean the adoption of any style in any context, and in American English is often used for the typographic style of names, as in &quot;AT&amp;T is also stylized as ATT and at&amp;t&quot;: this is a specific usage that seems to have escaped dictionaries, although it is a small extension of existing other senses of the word.

==Computer identification and recreation==
In a 2012 experiment at Lawrence Technological University in Michigan, a computer analysed approximately 1,000 paintings from 34 well-known artists using a specially developed algorithm and placed them in similar style categories to human art historians. The analysis involved the sampling of more than 4,000 visual features per work of art.

Apps such as Deep Art Effects can turn photos into art-like images claimed to be in the style of painters such as Van Gogh. With the development of sophisticated text-to-image AI art software, using specifiable art styles has become a widespread tool in the 2020s.

<text>Joseph Louis Barrow (May 13, 1914 – April 12, 1981) was an American professional boxer who competed from 1934 to 1951. Nicknamed &quot;the Brown Bomber&quot;, Louis is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential boxers of all time. He reigned as the world heavyweight champion from 1937 until his temporary retirement in 1949. He was victorious in 25 consecutive title defenses, a record for all weight classes. Louis has the longest single reign as champion of any boxer in history.

Louis&#x27;s cultural impact was felt well outside the ring. He is widely regarded as the first African-American to achieve the status of a nationwide hero within the United States, and was also a focal point of anti-Nazi sentiment leading up to and during World War II because of his historic rematch with German boxer Max Schmeling in 1938. He was instrumental in integrating the game of golf, helping break the sport&#x27;s color barrier in America by appearing under a sponsor&#x27;s exemption in a PGA event in 1952.

==Early life==
Born on May 13, 1914, in rural Chambers County, Alabama—in a ramshackle dwelling on Bell Chapel Road, located about off State Route 50 and roughly from LaFayette—Louis was the seventh of eight children of Munroe Barrow and Lillie (Reese) Barrow. He weighed at birth. Both of his parents were children of former slaves, alternating between sharecropping and rental farming.

Louis suffered from a speech impediment and spoke very little until about the age of six. Munroe Barrow was committed to a mental institution in 1916 and, as a result, Joe knew very little of his biological father. Around 1920, Louis&#x27;s mother married Pat Brooks, a local construction contractor, having received word that Munroe Barrow had died while institutionalized (in reality, Munroe Barrow lived until 1938, unaware of his son&#x27;s fame).

In 1926, shaken by a gang of white men in the Ku Klux Klan, Louis&#x27;s family moved to Detroit, Michigan, forming part of the post-World War I Great Migration. Joe&#x27;s brother worked for Ford Motor Company (where Joe would himself work for a time at the River Rouge Plant) and the family settled into a home at 2700 Catherine (now Madison) Street in Detroit&#x27;s Black Bottom neighborhood.

Louis attended Bronson Vocational School for a time to learn cabinet-making.

==Amateur career==
The Great Depression severely affected the Barrow family, but Joe still made time to work out at a local youth recreation center at 637 Brewster Street in Detroit. His mother attempted to get him interested in playing the violin. He is rumoured to have tried to hide his pugilistic ambitions from his mother by carrying his boxing gloves inside his violin case.

Louis made his debut in early 1932 at the age of 17. Legend has it that before the fight, the barely literate Louis wrote his name so large that there was no room for his last name, and thus became known as &quot;Joe Louis&quot; for the remainder of his boxing career (more likely, Louis simply omitted his last name to keep his boxing a secret from his mother). After this debut—a loss to future Olympian Johnny Miler—Louis compiled numerous amateur victories, eventually winning the club championship of his Brewster Street recreation center, the home of many aspiring Golden Gloves fighters.

In 1933, Louis won the Detroit-area Golden Gloves Novice Division championship against Joe Biskey for the light heavyweight classification. He later lost in the Chicago Golden Gloves Tournament of Champions. The next year, competing in the Golden Gloves&#x27; Open Division, he won the light heavyweight classification, this time also winning the Chicago Tournament of Champions against Joe Bauer. However, a hand injury forced Louis to miss the New York/Chicago Champions&#x27; cross-town bout for the ultimate Golden Gloves championship. In April 1934, he followed up his Chicago performance by winning the light heavyweight United States Amateur Champion National AAU tournament in St. Louis, Missouri.

By the end of his amateur career, Louis&#x27;s record was 50–4, with 43 knockouts.

==Professional career==
Joe Louis had only three losses in his 69 professional fights. He tallied 52 knockouts and held the championship from 1937 to 1949, the longest span of any heavyweight titleholder. After returning from retirement, Louis failed to regain the championship in 1950, and his career ended after he was knocked out by Rocky Marciano in 1951.

===Early years===
Louis&#x27;s amateur performances attracted the interest of professional promoters, and he was soon represented by a black Detroit-area bookmaker named John Roxborough. As Louis explained in his autobiography, Roxborough convinced the young fighter that white managers would have no real interest in seeing a black boxer work his way up to title contention:

[Roxborough] told me about the fate of most black fighters, ones with white managers, who wound up burned-out and broke before they reached their prime. The white managers were not interested in the men they were handling but in the money they could make from them. They didn&#x27;t take the proper time to see that their fighters had a proper training, that they lived comfortably, or ate well, or had some pocket change. Mr. Roxborough was talking about Black Power before it became popular.

Roxborough knew a Chicago area boxing promoter named Julian Black who already had a stable of mediocre boxers against which Louis could hone his craft, this time in the heavyweight division. After becoming part of the management team, Black hired fellow Chicago native Jack &quot;Chappy&quot; Blackburn as Louis&#x27;s trainer. Louis&#x27;s initial professional fights were all in the Chicago area, his professional debut coming on July 4, 1934, against Jack Kracken in the Bacon Casino on Chicago&#x27;s south side. Louis earned $59 for knocking out Kracken in the first round. $59 in 1934 is equivalent to $1,148.60 in 2020 dollars. Louis won all 12 of his professional fights that year, 10 by knockout.

In September 1934, while promoting a Detroit-area &quot;coming home&quot; bout for Louis against Canadian Alex Borchuk, Roxborough was pressured by members of the Michigan State Boxing Commission to have Louis sign with white management. Roxborough refused and continued advancing Louis&#x27;s career with bouts against heavyweight contenders Art Sykes and Stanley Poreda.

While training for a fight against Lee Ramage, Louis noticed a young female secretary for the black newspaper at the gym. After Ramage was defeated, the secretary, Marva Trotter, was invited to the celebration party at Chicago&#x27;s Grand Hotel. Trotter later became Louis&#x27;s first wife in 1935.

During this time, Louis also met Truman Gibson, the man who would become his personal lawyer. As a young associate at a law firm hired by Julian Black, Gibson was charged with personally entertaining Louis during the pendency of business deals.

====Title contention====
Although Louis&#x27;s management was finding him bouts against legitimate heavyweight contenders, no path to the title was forthcoming. While professional boxing was not officially segregated, many white Americans did not like the prospect of a black champion. In 1908, during an era of severe anti-black repression, Jack Johnson became the first black heavyweight champion. Johnson&#x27;s flamboyant lifestyle and marriage to a white woman engendered an enormous backlash that greatly limited opportunities of black fighters in the heavyweight division. Black boxers were denied championship bouts, and there were few heavyweight black contenders at the time, though there were African Americans who fought for titles in other weight divisions, and a few notable black champions, such as Tiger Flowers. Louis and his handlers would counter the legacy of Johnson by emphasizing the Brown Bomber&#x27;s modesty and sportsmanship. Biographer Gerald Astor stated that &quot;Joe Louis&#x27; early boxing career was stalked by the specter of Jack Johnson&quot;.

If Louis were to rise to national prominence among such cultural attitudes, a change in management would be necessary. In 1935, boxing promoter Mike Jacobs sought out Louis&#x27;s handlers. After Louis&#x27;s narrow defeat of Natie Brown on March 29, 1935, Jacobs and the Louis team met at the Frog Club, a black nightclub, and negotiated a three-year exclusive boxing promotion deal. The contract, however, did not keep Roxborough and Black from attempting to cash in as Louis&#x27;s managers; when Louis turned 21 on May 13, 1935, Roxborough and Black each signed Louis to an onerous long-term contract that collectively dedicated half of Louis&#x27;s future income to the pair.

Black and Roxborough continued to carefully and deliberately shape Louis&#x27;s media image. Mindful of the tremendous public backlash Johnson had suffered for his unapologetic attitude and flamboyant lifestyle, they drafted &quot;Seven Commandments&quot; for Louis&#x27;s personal conduct. These included:
* Never have his picture taken with a white woman
* Never gloat over a fallen opponent
* Never engage in fixed fights
* Live and fight clean
As a result, Louis was generally portrayed in the white media as a modest, clean-living person, which facilitated his burgeoning celebrity status.

With the backing of a major promotion, Louis fought thirteen times in 1935. The bout that helped put him in the media spotlight occurred on June 25, when Louis knocked out 6&#x27;6&quot;, 265-pound former world heavyweight champion Primo Carnera in six rounds. Foreshadowing the Louis–Schmeling rivalry to come, the Carnera bout featured a political dimension. Louis&#x27;s victory over Carnera, who symbolized Benito Mussolini&#x27;s regime in the popular eye, was seen as a victory for the international community, particularly among African Americans, who were sympathetic to Ethiopia, which was attempting to maintain its independence by fending off an invasion by fascist Italy. America&#x27;s white press began promoting Louis&#x27;s image in the context of the era&#x27;s racism; nicknames they created included the &quot;Mahogany Mauler&quot;, &quot;Chocolate Chopper&quot;, &quot;Coffee-Colored KO King&quot;, &quot;Safari Sandman&quot;, and one that stuck: &quot;The Brown Bomber&quot;.

Helping the white press to overcome its reluctance to feature a black contender was that in the mid-1930s boxing desperately needed a marketable hero. Since the retirement of Jack Dempsey in 1929, the sport had devolved into a sordid mixture of poor athletes, gambling, fixed fights, thrown matches, and control of the sport by organized crime. &quot;New York Times&quot; Columnist Edward Van Ness wrote, &quot;Louis ... is a boon to boxing. Just as Dempsey led the sport out of the doldrums ... so is Louis leading the boxing game out of a slump&quot;. Likewise, biographer Bill Libby asserted that &quot;The sports world was hungry for a great champion when Louis arrived in New York in 1935&quot;.

While the mainstream press was beginning to embrace Louis, many still opposed the prospect of another black heavyweight champion. In September 1935, on the eve of Louis&#x27;s fight with former titleholder Max Baer, &quot;Washington Post&quot; sportswriter Shirley Povich wrote about some Americans&#x27; hopes for the white contender, &quot;They say Baer will surpass himself in the knowledge that he is the lone white hope for the defense of Nordic superiority in the prize ring&quot;. However, the hopes of white supremacists would soon be dashed.

Although Baer had been knocked down only once before in his professional career (by Frankie Campbell), Louis dominated the former champion, knocking him out in the fourth round. Unknowingly, Baer suffered from a unique disadvantage in the fight: earlier that evening, Louis had married Marva Trotter at a friend&#x27;s apartment and was eager to end the fight in order to consummate the relationship. Later that year, Louis also knocked out Paulino Uzcudun, who had never been knocked down before.

====Louis vs. Schmeling====
By this time, Louis was ranked as the No. 1 contender in the heavyweight division and had won the Associated Press&#x27; &quot;Athlete of the Year&quot; award for 1935. What was considered to be a final tune-up bout before an eventual title shot was scheduled for June 1936 against Max Schmeling. Although a former world heavyweight champion, Schmeling, who had been knocked out by Max Baer, Louis had handily beaten, was not considered a threat to Louis, then with a professional record of 27–0. Schmeling had won his title on a technicality when Jack Sharkey was disqualified after giving Schmeling a low blow in 1930. Schmeling was also 30 years old at the time of the Louis bout and allegedly past his prime. Louis&#x27;s training retreat was located at Lakewood, New Jersey, where he was first able to practice the game of golf, later to become a lifelong passion. Noted entertainer Ed Sullivan had initially sparked Louis&#x27;s interest in the sport by giving an instructional book to Joe&#x27;s wife Marva. Louis spent significant time on the golf course rather than training for the match.

Conversely, Schmeling prepared intently for the bout. He had thoroughly studied Louis&#x27;s style and believed he had found a weakness. By exploiting Louis&#x27;s habit of dropping his left hand after a jab, Schmeling handed Louis his first professional loss by knocking him out in round 12 at Yankee Stadium on June 19, 1936. The event would lead to the historic rematch of the two, in one of the world&#x27;s most famous sporting events.

===World championship===
After defeating Louis, Schmeling expected a title shot against James J. Braddock, who had unexpectedly defeated Max Baer for the heavyweight title the previous June. Madison Square Garden (MSG) had a contract with Braddock for the title defense and also sought a Braddock–Schmeling title bout. But Jacobs and Braddock&#x27;s manager Joe Gould had been planning a Braddock–Louis matchup for months.

Schmeling&#x27;s victory gave Gould tremendous leverage, however. If he were to offer Schmeling the title chance instead of Louis, there was a very real possibility that Nazi authorities would never allow Louis a shot at the title. Gould&#x27;s demands were therefore onerous: Jacobs would have to pay 10% of all future boxing promotion profits (including any future profits from Louis&#x27;s future bouts) for ten years. Braddock and Gould would eventually receive more than $150,000 from this arrangement. Well before the actual fight, Jacobs and Gould publicly announced that their fighters would fight for the heavyweight title on June 22, 1937. Figuring that the New York State Athletic Commission would not sanction the fight in deference to MSG and Schmeling, Jacobs scheduled the fight for Chicago.

Each of the parties involved worked to facilitate the controversial Braddock–Louis matchup. Louis did his part by knocking out former champion Jack Sharkey on August 18, 1936. Meanwhile, Gould trumped up anti-Nazi sentiment against Schmeling, and Jacobs defended a lawsuit by MSG to halt the Braddock–Louis fight. A federal court in Newark, New Jersey, eventually ruled that Braddock&#x27;s contractual obligation to stage his title defense at MSG was unenforceable for lack of mutual consideration.

The stage was set for Louis&#x27;s title shot. On the night of the fight, June 22, 1937, Braddock was able to knock Louis down in round one, but afterward could accomplish little. After inflicting constant punishment, Louis defeated Braddock in round eight, knocking him out cold with a strong right hand that busted James&#x27; teeth through his gum shield and lip and sent him to the ground for a few minutes. It was the first and only time that Braddock was knocked out (the one other stoppage of Braddock&#x27;s career was a TKO due to a cut). Louis&#x27;s ascent to the world heavyweight championship was complete.

Louis&#x27;s victory was a seminal moment in African American history. Thousands of African Americans stayed up all night across the country in celebration. Noted author and member of the Harlem Renaissance Langston Hughes described Louis&#x27;s effect in these terms:

Each time Joe Louis won a fight in those depression years, even before he became champion, thousands of black Americans on relief or W.P.A., and poor, would throng out into the streets all across the land to march and cheer and yell and cry because of Joe&#x27;s one-man triumphs. No one else in the United States has ever had such an effect on Negro emotions—or on mine. I marched and cheered and yelled and cried, too.

====Initial title defenses====
Despite his championship, Louis was haunted by the earlier defeat to Schmeling. Shortly after winning the title, he was quoted as saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be called champ until I whip Max Schmeling&quot;. Louis&#x27;s manager Mike Jacobs attempted to arrange a rematch in 1937, but negotiations broke down when Schmeling demanded 30% of the gate. When Schmeling instead attempted to arrange for a fight against British Empire champion Tommy Farr, known as the &quot;Tonypandy Terror&quot;—ostensibly for a world championship to rival the claims of American boxing authorities—Jacobs outmaneuvered him, offering Farr a guaranteed $60,000 to fight Louis instead. The offer was too lucrative for Farr to turn down.

On August 30, 1937, after a postponement of four days due to rain, Louis and Farr finally touched gloves at New York&#x27;s Yankee Stadium before a crowd of approximately 32,000. Louis fought one of the hardest battles of his life. The bout was closely contested and went the entire 15 rounds, with Louis being unable to knock Farr down. Referee Arthur Donovan was even seen shaking Farr&#x27;s hand after the bout, in apparent congratulation. Nevertheless, after the score was announced, Louis had won a controversial unanimous decision. &quot;Time&quot; described the scene thus: &quot;After collecting the judges&#x27; votes, referee Arthur Donovan announced that Louis had won the fight on points. The crowd of 50,000 ... amazed that Farr had not been knocked out or even knocked down, booed the decision&quot;.

It seems the crowd believed that referee Arthur Donovan Sr. had raised Farr&#x27;s glove in victory. Seven years later, in his published account of the fight, Donovan spoke of the &quot;mistake&quot; that may have led to this confusion. He wrote:

As Tommy walked back to his corner after shaking Louis&#x27; hand, I followed him and seized his glove. &quot;Tommy, a wonderful perform—&quot; I began ... Then I dropped his hand like a red-hot coal! He had started to raise his arm. He thought I had given him the fight and the world championship! I literally ran away, shaking my head and shouting. &quot;No! No! No!&quot; realising how I had raised his hopes for a few seconds only to dash them to the ground ... That&#x27;s the last time my emotions will get the better of me in a prize fight! There was much booing at the announced result, but, as I say it, it was all emotional. I gave Tommy two rounds and one even—and both his winning rounds were close.

Speaking over the radio after the fight, Louis admitted that he had been hurt twice.

In preparation for the inevitable rematch with Schmeling, Louis tuned up with bouts against Nathan Mann and Harry Thomas.

====Louis vs. Schmeling II====

The rematch between Louis and Schmeling would become one of the most famous boxing matches of all time and is remembered as one of the major sports events of the 20th century. Following his defeat of Louis in 1936, Schmeling had become a national hero in Germany. Schmeling&#x27;s victory over an African American was touted by Nazi officials as proof of their doctrine of Aryan superiority. When the rematch was scheduled, Louis retreated to his boxing camp in New Jersey and trained incessantly for the fight. A few weeks before the bout, Louis visited the White House, where President Franklin D. Roosevelt told him, &quot;Joe, we need muscles like yours to beat Germany&quot;. Louis later admitted: &quot;I knew I had to get Schmeling good. I had my own personal reasons and the whole damned country was depending on me&quot;.

When Schmeling arrived in New York City in June 1938 for the rematch, he was accompanied by a Nazi party publicist who issued statements that a black man could not defeat Schmeling and that when Schmeling won, his prize money would be used to build tanks in Germany. Schmeling&#x27;s hotel was picketed by anti-Nazi protesters in the days before the fight.

On the night of June 22, 1938, Louis and Schmeling met for the second time in the boxing ring. The fight was held in Yankee Stadium before a crowd of 70,043. It was broadcast by radio to millions of listeners throughout the world (including 58% of radio-equipped U.S. households), with radio announcers reporting on the fight in English, German, Spanish, and Portuguese. Before the bout, Schmeling weighed in at 193 pounds; Louis weighed in at 198¾ pounds.

The fight lasted two minutes and four seconds. Louis battered Schmeling with a series of swift attacks, forcing him against the ropes and giving him a paralyzing body blow (Schmeling afterward claimed it was an illegal kidney punch). Schmeling was knocked down three times and only managed to throw two punches in the entire bout. On the third knockdown, Schmeling&#x27;s trainer threw in the towel and referee Arthur Donovan stopped the fight.

Well-established as one of the most significant boxing matches in history,
 the fight has been widely regarded as among the most important or historic sports events of all time. It was the first time that many white Americans openly cheered for a black man against a white opponent.

====&quot;Bum of the Month Club&quot;====
In the 29 months from January 1939 through May 1941, Louis defended his title thirteen times, a frequency unmatched by any heavyweight champion since the end of the bare-knuckle era. The pace of his title defenses, combined with his convincing wins, earned Louis&#x27;s opponents from this era the collective nickname &quot;Bum of the Month Club&quot;. Notables of this lambasted pantheon include:
* World light heavyweight champion John Henry Lewis who, attempting to move up a weight class, was knocked out in the first round by Louis on January 25, 1939.
* &quot;Two Ton&quot; Tony Galento, who was able to knock Louis to the canvas with a left hook in the third round of their bout on June 28, 1939, before letting his guard down and being knocked out in the fourth.
* Chilean Arturo Godoy, whom Louis fought twice in 1940, on February 9 and June 20. Louis won the first bout by a split-decision, and the rematch by a knockout in the eighth round.
* Al McCoy, putative New England heavyweight champion, whose fight against Louis is probably best known for being the first heavyweight title bout held in Boston, Massachusetts, (at the Boston Garden on December 16, 1940). The popular local challenger dodged his way around Louis before being unable to respond to the sixth-round bell.
* Clarence &quot;Red&quot; Burman, who pressed Louis for nearly five rounds at Madison Square Garden on January 31, 1941, before succumbing to a series of body blows.
* Gus Dorazio, of whom Louis remarked, &quot;At least he tried&quot;, after being leveled by a short right hand in the second round at Philadelphia&#x27;s Convention Hall on February 17.
* Abe Simon, who endured thirteen rounds of punishment before 18,908 at Olympia Stadium in Detroit on March 21 before referee Sam Hennessy declared a TKO.
* Tony Musto, who, at 5&#x27;7½&quot; and 198 pounds, was known as &quot;Baby Tank&quot;. Despite a unique crouching style, Musto was slowly worn down over eight and a half rounds in St. Louis on April 8, and the fight was called a TKO because of a severe cut over Musto&#x27;s eye.
* Buddy Baer (brother of former champion Max), who was leading the May 23, 1941, bout in Washington, D.C., until an eventual barrage by Louis, capped by a hit at the sixth round bell. Referee Arthur Donovan disqualified Baer before the beginning of the seventh round as a result of stalling by Baer&#x27;s manager.

Despite its derogatory nickname, most of the group were top-ten heavyweights. Of the 12 fighters Louis faced during this period, five were rated by &quot;The Ring&quot; as top-10 heavyweights in the year they fought Louis: Galento (overall #2 heavyweight in 1939), Bob Pastor (#3, 1939), Godoy (#3, 1940), Simon (#6, 1941) and Baer (#8, 1941). Four others (Musto, Dorazio, Burman and Johnny Paychek) were ranked in the top 10 in a different year.

====Louis vs. Conn====
Louis&#x27;s string of lightly regarded competition ended with his bout against Billy Conn, the light heavyweight champion and a highly regarded contender. The fighters met on June 18, 1941, in front of a crowd of 54,487 fans at the Polo Grounds in New York City. The fight turned out to be what is commonly considered one of the greatest heavyweight boxing fights of all time.

Conn would not gain weight for the challenge against Louis, saying instead that he would rely on a &quot;hit and run&quot; strategy. This prompted Louis&#x27;s famous response: &quot;He can run, but he can&#x27;t hide&quot;.

However, Louis had clearly underestimated Conn&#x27;s threat. In his autobiography, Joe Louis said:

I made a mistake going into that fight. I knew Conn was kinda small and I didn&#x27;t want them to say in the papers that I beat up on some little guy so the day before the fight I did a little roadwork to break a sweat and drank as little water as possible so I could weigh in under 200 pounds. Chappie was as mad as hell. But Conn was a clever fighter, he was like a mosquito, he&#x27;d sting and move.
Conn had the better of the fight through 12 rounds, although Louis was able to stun Conn with a left hook in the fifth, cutting his eye and nose. By the eighth round, Louis began suffering from dehydration. By the twelfth round, Louis was exhausted, with Conn ahead on two of three boxing scorecards. But against the advice of his corner, Conn continued to closely engage Louis in the later stages of the fight. Louis made the most of the opportunity, knocking Conn out with two seconds left in the thirteenth round.

The contest created an instant rivalry that Louis&#x27;s career had lacked since the Schmeling era, and a rematch with Conn was planned for late 1942. The rematch had to be abruptly canceled, however, after Conn broke his hand in a much-publicized fight with his father-in-law, Major League ballplayer Jimmy &quot;Greenfield&quot; Smith. By the time Conn was ready for the rematch, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor had taken place.

==World War II==
Louis fought a charity bout for the Navy Relief Society against his former opponent Buddy Baer on January 9, 1942, which raised $47,000 for the fund. The next day, he volunteered to enlist as a private in the United States Army at Camp Upton, Long Island. Newsreel cameras recorded his induction, including a staged scene in which a soldier-clerk asked, &quot;What&#x27;s your occupation?&quot;, to which Louis replied, &quot;Fighting and let us at them Japs&quot;.

Another military charity bout on March 27, 1942, (against another former opponent, Abe Simon) netted $36,146. Before the fight, Louis had spoken at a Relief Fund dinner, saying of the war effort, &quot;We&#x27;ll win, &#x27;cause we&#x27;re on God&#x27;s side&quot;. The media widely reported the comment, instigating a surge of popularity for Louis. Slowly, the press began to eliminate its stereotypical racial references when covering Louis and instead treated him as a sports hero. Despite the public relations boon, Louis&#x27;s charitable fights proved financially costly. Although he saw none of the roughly $90,000 raised by these and other charitable fights, the IRS later credited these amounts as taxable income paid to Louis. After the war, the IRS pursued the issue.

For basic training, Louis was assigned to a segregated cavalry unit based in Fort Riley, Kansas. The assignment was at the suggestion of his friend and lawyer Truman Gibson, who knew of Louis&#x27;s love for horsemanship. Gibson had previously become a civilian advisor to the War Department, in charge of investigating claims of harassment against black soldiers. Accordingly, Louis used this personal connection to help the cause of various black soldiers with whom he came into contact. In one noted episode, Louis contacted Gibson in order to facilitate the Officer Candidate School (OCS) applications of a group of black recruits at Fort Riley, which had been inexplicably delayed for several months. Among the OCS applications Louis facilitated was that of young UCLA athletic legend Jackie Robinson, later to break the baseball color barrier. The episode spawned a personal friendship between the two men.

Realizing Louis&#x27;s potential for raising &quot;esprit de corps&quot; among the troops, the Army placed him in its Special Services Division rather than sending him into combat. Louis went on a celebrity tour with other notables, including fellow boxer Sugar Ray Robinson. He traveled more than and staged 96 boxing exhibitions before two million soldiers. In England during 1944, he was reported to have signed as a player for Liverpool Football Club as a publicity stunt.

In addition to his travels, Louis was the focus of a media recruitment campaign encouraging African-American men to enlist in the Armed Services, despite the military&#x27;s racial segregation. When he was asked about his decision to enter the racially segregated U.S. Army, he said: &quot;Lots of things wrong with America, but Hitler ain&#x27;t going to fix them&quot;. In 1943, Louis made an appearance in the wartime Hollywood musical &quot;This Is the Army&quot;, directed by Michael Curtiz. He appeared as himself in a musical number, &quot;The Well-Dressed Man in Harlem&quot;, which emphasized the importance of African-American soldiers and promoted their enlistment.

Louis&#x27;s celebrity power was not directed solely toward African Americans. In a famous wartime recruitment slogan, he echoed his prior comments of 1942: &quot;We&#x27;ll win, because we&#x27;re on God&#x27;s side&quot;. The publicity of the campaign made Louis widely popular stateside, even outside the world of sports. Never before had white Americans embraced a black man as their representative to the world.

Although Louis never saw combat, his military service saw challenges of its own. During his travels, he often experienced blatant racism. On one occasion, a military policeman (MP) ordered Louis and Ray Robinson to move to a bench in the rear of an Alabama Army camp bus depot. &quot;We ain&#x27;t moving&quot;, said Louis. The MP tried to arrest them, but Louis forcefully argued the pair out of the situation. In another incident, Louis exerted his influence to persuade a commanding officer to drop charges against now Lt. Jackie Robinson, who had resisted being told to move his seat on a southern bus, and retaliated against a Captain who had called Robinson a &quot;nigger&quot;.

Louis was eventually promoted to the rank of technical sergeant on April 9, 1945. On September 23 of the same year, he was awarded the Legion of Merit (a military decoration rarely awarded to enlisted soldiers) for &quot;incalculable contribution to the general morale&quot;. Receipt of the honor qualified him for immediate release from military service on October 1, 1945.

==Later career and retirement==
Louis emerged from his wartime service significantly in debt. In addition to his looming tax bill—which had not been finally determined at the time, but was estimated at greater than $100,000—Jacobs claimed that Louis owed him $250,000.

Despite the financial pressure on Louis to resume boxing, his long-awaited rematch against Billy Conn had to be postponed to the summer of 1946, when weather conditions could accommodate a large outdoor audience. On June 19, a disappointing 40,000 saw the rematch at Yankee Stadium, in which Louis was not seriously tested. Conn, whose skills had deteriorated during the long layoff, largely avoided contact until being dispatched by knockout in the eighth round. Although the attendance did not meet expectations, the fight was still the most profitable of Louis&#x27;s career to date. His share of the purse was $600,000, of which Louis&#x27;s managers got $140,000, his ex-wife $66,000 and the U.S. state of New York $30,000.

After trouble finding another suitable opponent, on December 5, 1947, Louis met Jersey Joe Walcott, a 33-year-old veteran with a 44–11–2 record. Walcott entered the fight as a 10-to-1 underdog. Nevertheless, Walcott knocked down Louis twice in the first four rounds. Most observers in Madison Square Garden felt Walcott dominated the 15-round fight. When Louis was declared the winner in a split decision, the crowd booed.

Louis was under no illusion about the state of his boxing skills, yet he was too embarrassed to quit after the Walcott fight. Determined to win and retire with his title intact, Louis signed on for a rematch. On June 25, 1948, about 42,000 people came to Yankee Stadium to see the aging champion, who weighed 213½ pounds, the heaviest of his career to date. Walcott knocked Louis down in the third round, but Louis survived to knock out Walcott in the eleventh.

Louis would not defend his title again before announcing his retirement from boxing on March 1, 1949. In his bouts with Conn and Walcott, it had become apparent that Louis was no longer the fighter he had once been. As he had done earlier in his career, however, Louis would continue to appear in numerous exhibition matches worldwide. In August 1949 Cab Calloway rendered homage to the &quot;king of the ring&quot; with his song &quot;Ol&#x27; Joe Louis&quot;.

===Comeback===

At the time of Louis&#x27;s initial retirement, the IRS was still completing its investigation of his prior tax returns, which had always been handled by Mike Jacobs&#x27;s personal accountant. In May 1950, the IRS finished a full audit of Louis&#x27;s past returns and announced that, with interest and penalties, he owed the government more than $500,000. Louis had no choice but to return to the ring.

After asking Gibson to take over his personal finances and switching his management from Jacobs and Roxborough to Marshall Miles, the Louis camp negotiated a deal with the IRS under which Louis would come out of retirement, with all Louis&#x27;s net proceeds going to the IRS. A match with Ezzard Charles—who had acquired the vacant heavyweight title in June 1949 by outpointing Walcott—was set for September 27, 1950. By then, Louis was 36 years old and had been away from competitive boxing for two years. Weighing in at 218 pounds, Louis was still strong, but his reflexes were gone and Charles repeatedly beat him to the punch. By the end of the fight, Louis was cut above both eyes, one of which was shut tight by swelling. He knew he had lost even before Charles was declared the winner. The result was not the only disappointing aspect of the fight for Louis; only 22,357 spectators paid to witness the event at Yankee Stadium, and his share of the purse was a mere $100,458. Louis had to continue fighting.

After facing several club-level opponents and scoring a knockout victory over EBU heavyweight champion Lee Savold, the International Boxing Club guaranteed Louis $300,000 to face undefeated heavyweight contender Rocky Marciano on October 26, 1951. Despite his being a 6-to-5 favorite, few boxing insiders believed Louis had a chance. Marciano himself was reluctant to participate in the bout, but was understanding of Louis&#x27;s position: &quot;This is the last guy on earth I want to fight&quot;. It was feared, particularly among those who had witnessed Marciano&#x27;s punching power first-hand, that Louis&#x27;s unwillingness to quit would result in serious injury. Fighting back tears, Ferdie Pacheco said in the &quot;SportsCentury&quot; documentary about Louis&#x27;s bout with Marciano, &quot;He [Louis] wasn&#x27;t just going to lose. He was going to take a vicious, savage beating. Before the eyes of the nation, Joe Louis, an American hero if ever there was one, was going to get beaten up&quot;. Louis was dropped in the eighth round by a Marciano left and knocked through the ropes and out of the ring less than thirty seconds later.

In the dressing room after the fight, Louis&#x27;s Army touring companion, Sugar Ray Robinson, wept. Marciano also attempted to console Louis, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, Joe&quot;. &quot;What&#x27;s the use of crying?&quot; Louis said. &quot;The better man won. I guess everything happens for the best&quot;.

After facing Marciano, with the prospect of another significant payday all but gone, Louis retired for good from professional boxing. He would, as before, continue to tour on the exhibition circuit, with his last contest taking place on December 16, 1951, in Taipei, Taiwan, against Corporal Buford J. deCordova.

==Taxes and financial troubles==
Despite Louis&#x27;s lucrative purses over the years, most of the proceeds went to his handlers. Of the over $4.6 million earned during his boxing career, Louis himself received only about $800,000. Louis was nevertheless extremely generous to his family, paying for homes, cars and education for his parents and siblings, often with money fronted by Jacobs. He invested in a number of businesses, all of which eventually failed, including the Joe Louis Restaurant, the Joe Louis Insurance Company, a softball team called the Brown Bombers, the Joe Louis Milk Company, Joe Louis pomade (hair product), Joe Louis Punch (a drink), the Louis-Rower P.R. firm, a horse farm and the Rhumboogie Café in Chicago. He gave liberally to the government as well, paying back the city of Detroit for any welfare money his family had received.

A combination of this largesse and government intervention eventually put Louis in severe financial straits. His entrusting of his finances to former manager Mike Jacobs haunted him. After the $500,000 IRS tax bill was assessed, with interest accumulating every year, the need for cash precipitated Louis&#x27;s post-retirement comeback. Even though his comeback earned him significant purses, the incremental tax rate in place at the time (90%) meant that these boxing proceeds did not even keep pace with interest on Louis&#x27;s tax debt. As a result, by the end of the 1950s, he owed over $1 million in taxes and interest. In 1953, when Louis&#x27;s mother died, the IRS appropriated the $667 she had willed to Louis. To bring in money, Louis engaged in numerous activities outside the ring. He appeared on various quiz shows, and an old Army friend, Ash Resnick, gave Louis a job greeting tourists to the Caesars Palace hotel in Las Vegas, where Resnick was an executive. For income, Louis even became a professional wrestler. He made his professional wrestling debut on March 16, 1956, in Washington, D.C. at the Uline Arena, defeating Cowboy Rocky Lee. After defeating Lee in a few matches, Louis discovered he had a heart ailment and retired from wrestling competition. However, he continued as a wrestling referee until 1972.

Louis remained a popular celebrity in his twilight years. His friends included former rival Max Schmeling, who provided Louis with financial assistance during his retirement—and mobster Frank Lucas, who, disgusted with the government&#x27;s treatment of Louis, once paid off a $50,000 tax lien held against him. These payments, along with an eventual agreement in the early 1960s by the IRS to limit its collections to an amount based on Louis&#x27;s current income, allowed Louis to live comfortably toward the end of his life.

After the Louis-Schmeling fight, Jack Dempsey expressed the opinion that he was glad he never had to face Joe Louis in the ring. When Louis fell on hard financial times, Dempsey served as honorary chairman of a fund to assist Louis.

==Professional wrestling career==
In an effort to improve his financial situation, Joe Louis got involved with professional wrestling in 1954. His first recorded match was on August 6, 1954, in a victory over Bobby Nelson.
In 1956, Louis went on a short-lived wrestling tour arranged by promoter Ray Fabiani. This was cut short after a match against Cowboy Rocky Lee on May 31, 1956, when Louis&#x27; ribs were cracked, and he subsequently lost his wrestling license.

Louis returned to the wrestling ring on March 15, 1959, where he lost to Buddy Rogers in Columbus, Ohio. This led to a hiatus until the late 1960s and early 1970s, when he engaged in several wrestling matches. His last match was in 1973 but he continued as a referee.

==Professional golf==

One of Louis&#x27; other passions was the game of golf, in which he also played a historic role. He was a long-time devotee of the sport since being introduced to the game before the first Schmeling fight in 1936. In 1952, Louis was invited to play as an amateur in the San Diego Open on a sponsor&#x27;s exemption, which was announced at the time as the first instance of an African-American to play in a PGA Tour event (in fact, professional Howard Wheeler was one of seven African-Americans to compete in the Tam O&#x27;Shanter Open in Niles, Illinois in 1942, and Wheeler appeared in subsequent PGA-sanctioned events in Philadelphia in the 1940s, qualifying for the 1950 and 1951 U.S. Open).

Initially, the PGA of America was reluctant to allow Louis to enter the event, having a bylaw at the time limiting PGA membership to white Americans. Louis&#x27;s celebrity status eventually pushed the PGA toward removing the bylaw, although the &quot;Caucasian only&quot; clause in the PGA of America&#x27;s constitution was not formally amended until November 1961. The change, however, paved the way for the first generation of African-American professional golfers such as Calvin Peete.

Two weeks after the 1952 San Diego Open, Louis was invited to play in the 1952 Tucson Open. Louis shot a 69 in the opening round and a 72 in the 2nd round. His 2-round total of 141 enabled him to make the cut. Joe Louis is the only champion athlete from another sport ever to make the cut in a PGA event.

Louis himself financially supported the careers of several other early black professional golfers, such as Bill Spiller, Ted Rhodes, Howard Wheeler, James Black, Clyde Martin and Charlie Sifford. He was also instrumental in founding The First Tee, a charity helping underprivileged children become acquainted with the game of golf. His son, Joe Louis Barrow Jr., served as CEO of the organization until 2017.

In 2009, the PGA of America granted posthumous membership to Ted Rhodes, John Shippen and Bill Spiller, who were denied the opportunity to become PGA members during their professional careers. The PGA also has granted posthumous honorary membership to Louis. A public golf course in Riverdale, Illinois, just south of Chicago, is named for him.

==Personal life==


Louis had two children by wife Marva Trotter (daughter Jacqueline in 1943 and son Joseph Louis Barrow Jr. in 1947). They divorced in March 1945 only to remarry a year later, but were again divorced in February 1949. Marva moved on to an acting and modeling career. On Christmas Day 1955, Louis married Rose Morgan, a successful Harlem businesswoman; their marriage was annulled in 1958. Louis&#x27;s final marriage—to Martha Jefferson, a lawyer from Los Angeles, on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day 1959—lasted until his death. They had four children: another son named Joseph Louis Barrow Jr, John Louis Barrow, Joyce Louis Barrow, and Janet Louis Barrow. The younger Joe Louis Barrow Jr. lives in New York City and is involved in boxing. Though married four times, Louis discreetly enjoyed the company of other women like Lena Horne and Edna Mae Harris.

Joe and Marva Louis endorsed and campaigned for liberal, anti-segregation Republican candidate Wendell Willkie in the 1940 United States presidential election. Louis said:

This country has been good to me. It gave me everything I have. I have never come out for any candidate before but I think Wendell L. Willkie will give us a square deal. So I am for Willkie because I think he will help my people, and I figure my people should be for him, too.

Drugs took a toll on Louis in his later years. In 1969, he was hospitalized after collapsing on a New York City street. While the incident was at first credited to &quot;physical breakdown&quot;, underlying problems would soon surface. In 1970, he spent five months at the Colorado Psychiatric Hospital and the Veterans Administration Hospital in Denver, hospitalized by his wife, Martha, and his son, Joe Louis Barrow Jr., for paranoia. In a 1971 book, &quot;Brown Bomber&quot;, by Barney Nagler, Louis disclosed the truth about these incidents, stating that his collapse in 1969 had been caused by cocaine, and that his subsequent hospitalization had been prompted by his fear of a plot to destroy him. Strokes and heart ailments caused Louis&#x27;s condition to deteriorate further later in the decade. He had surgery to correct an aortic aneurysm in 1977 and thereafter used a POV/scooter for a mobility aid.

==Death==

Louis died of cardiac arrest in Desert Springs Hospital near Las Vegas on April 12, 1981, just hours after his last public appearance viewing the Larry Holmes–Trevor Berbick heavyweight championship fight. President Ronald Reagan waived the eligibility rules for burial at Arlington National Cemetery and Louis was buried there with full military honors on April 21, 1981. His funeral was paid for in part by former competitor and friend, Max Schmeling, who also acted as a pallbearer.

==Film and television==

Louis appeared in six full-length films and two short films.

Louis had a starring role in the 1938 race film &quot;Spirit of Youth&quot;, in which he played a boxer with many similarities to himself.

In 1943, he was featured in the full-length movie &quot;This is the Army&quot;, which starred Ronald Reagan, with appearances by Kate Smith singing &quot;God Bless America&quot; and Irving Berlin, and which was directed by Michael Curtiz.

In 1946 he played himself in &quot;Joe Palooka, Champ&quot;, a movie based on the comic strip &quot;Joe Palooka&quot; created by Ham Fisher.

Louis once again played himself in the short film &quot;Johnny At The Fair&quot; in 1947. The short film takes place at the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) where a boy becomes separated from his parents and meets a host of celebrities including former Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon MacKenzie King and champion figure skater Barbara Ann Scott.

In 1948 Louis starred as himself in Joseph Lerner&#x27;s &quot;The Fight Never Ends&quot;.

In 1955 Louis was once again cast as himself in a small role in The Square Jungle written by George Zuckerman and starring Tony Curtis.

Louis&#x27;s last feature-length movie role took place in the 1970 comedy &quot;The Phynx&quot; in which a rock band goes on tour in Albania in order to save Americans being held hostage.

He was a guest on the television show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; in 1955. In 1977, Louis made a small cameo appearance on the TV series &quot;Quincy M.E.&quot;

In 1953, Robert Gordon directed a movie about Louis&#x27;s life, &quot;The Joe Louis Story&quot;. Filmed in Hollywood, it starred Golden Gloves fighter and Louis lookalike Coley Wallace in the title role. The film suffered from low budget and production values, sluggishly intercutting clips from Louis&#x27;s actual bouts with indifferent audio sync.

==Legacy==

Louis is widely regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time. He reigned as the world heavyweight champion from 1937 to 1949, during which he participated in 26 championship fights, defeated 21 fighters, made 25 defenses and was a world champion for 11 years and 10 months. The latter two are still records in the heavyweight division, the former in any division. Louis has won the most world heavyweight title fights in history, at 26. In addition to his accomplishments inside the ring, Louis uttered two of boxing&#x27;s most famous observations: &quot;He can run, but he can&#x27;t hide&quot; and &quot;Everyone has a plan until they&#x27;ve been hit&quot;.

Louis was named fighter of the year four times by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine in 1936, 1938, 1939, and 1941. His fights with Max Baer, Max Schmeling, Tommy Farr, Bob Pastor and Billy Conn were named fight of the year by that same magazine. Louis won the Sugar Ray Robinson Award in 1941. In 2005, Louis was ranked as the best heavyweight of all time by the International Boxing Research Organization, and was ranked number one on &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 greatest punchers of all time&quot;. In a 1978 poll conducted by HBO, the Boxing Writers of America voted Louis the greatest heavyweight of all time. Hank Kaplan, Bert Sugar, Teddy Atlas, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, and Sugar Ray Robinson named Louis as the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time.

Louis is also remembered in sports outside of boxing. A former indoor sports venue was named after him in Detroit, the Joe Louis Arena, where the Detroit Red Wings played their NHL games from 1979 to 2017. In 1936, Vince Leah, then a writer for &quot;The Winnipeg Tribune&quot; used Joe Louis&#x27;s nickname to refer to the Winnipeg Football Club after a game. From that point, the team became known popularly as the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.

His recognition also transcends the sporting world. In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Joe Louis on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans. On August 26, 1982, Louis was posthumously approved for the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest award given to civilians by the U.S. legislative branch. Congress stated that he &quot;did so much to bolster the spirit of the American people during one of the most crucial times in American history and which have endured throughout the years as a symbol of strength for the nation&quot;. Following Louis&#x27;s death, President Ronald Reagan said, &quot;Joe Louis was more than a sports legend—his career was an indictment of racial bigotry and a source of pride and inspiration to millions of white and black people around the world&quot;.

On October 16, 1986, a memorial to Louis was dedicated at Jefferson Avenue and Woodward in Detroit. The sculpture, commissioned by Time, Inc. and executed by Robert Graham, is a arm with a fisted hand suspended by a pyramidal framework. It represents the power of his punch both inside and outside the ring.

In an interview with Arsenio Hall in the late 1980s, former heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali stated that his two biggest influences in boxing were Sugar Ray Robinson and Joe Louis. After Joe Louis died, Ali stated, &quot;Whatever I said before, I don&#x27;t mean it, &#x27;cause Joe Louis was the greatest.&quot; Ali then told the Washington Post: 

 On February 27, 2010, an bronze statue of Louis was unveiled in his Alabama hometown. The statue, by sculptor Casey Downing Jr., sits on a base of red granite outside the Chambers County Courthouse.

In 1993, he became the first boxer to be honored on a postage stamp issued by the U.S. Postal Service.

Various other facilities have been named after Joe Louis. In 1984, the four streets surrounding Madison Square Garden were named Joe Louis Plaza in his honor. The former Pipe O&#x27; Peace Golf Course in Riverdale, Illinois (a Chicago suburb), was in 1986 renamed &quot;Joe Louis The Champ Golf Course&quot;. American Legion Post 375 in Detroit is also named after Joe Louis. Completed in 1979 at a cost of $4 million, Joe Louis Arena, nicknamed The Joe, was a hockey arena located in downtown Detroit. It was the home of the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League from 1979 until 2017. The planned demolition of the Arena prompted the City of Detroit in 2017 to rename the Inner Circle Greenway as the Joe Louis Greenway. The biking and walking trail passes through the cities of Detroit, Hamtramck, Highland Park, and Dearborn.

In one of the most widely quoted tributes to Louis, &quot;New York Post&quot; sportswriter Jimmy Cannon, when responding to another person&#x27;s characterization of Louis as &quot;a credit to his race&quot;, stated, &quot;Yes, Joe Louis is a credit to his race—the human race&quot;.

Joe Louis trained at the site of the Pompton Lakes (NJ) Elks Club. When he won one of his fights, he donated the first ambulance to the Pompton Lakes First Aid Squad.

<text>Random optimization (RO) is a family of numerical optimization methods that do not require the gradient of the optimization problem and RO can hence be used on functions that are not continuous or differentiable. Such optimization methods are also known as direct-search, derivative-free, or black-box methods.

The name random optimization is attributed to Matyas who made an early presentation of RO along with basic mathematical analysis. RO works by iteratively moving to better positions in the search-space which are sampled using e.g. a normal distribution surrounding the current position.

== Algorithm ==

Let formula_1 be the fitness or cost function which must be minimized. Let formula_2 designate a position or candidate solution in the search-space. The basic RO algorithm can then be described as:

* Initialize x with a random position in the search-space.
* Until a termination criterion is met (e.g. number of iterations performed, or adequate fitness reached), repeat the following:
** Sample a new position y by adding a normally distributed random vector to the current position x
** If (&quot;f&quot;(y) &lt; &quot;f&quot;(x)) then move to the new position by setting x = y
* Now x holds the best-found position.

This algorithm corresponds to a (1+1) evolution strategy with constant step-size.

== Convergence and variants ==
Matyas showed the basic form of RO converges to the optimum of a simple unimodal function by using a limit-proof which shows convergence to the optimum is certain to occur if a potentially infinite number of iterations are performed. However, this proof is not useful in practice because a finite number of iterations can only be executed. In fact, such a theoretical limit-proof will also show that purely random sampling of the search-space will inevitably yield a sample arbitrarily close to the optimum.

Mathematical analyses are also conducted by Baba and Solis and Wets to establish that convergence to a region surrounding the optimum is inevitable under some mild conditions for RO variants using other probability distributions for the sampling. An estimate on the number of iterations required to approach the optimum is derived by Dorea. These analyses are criticized through empirical experiments by Sarma who used the optimizer variants of Baba and Dorea on two real-world problems, showing the optimum to be approached very slowly and moreover that the methods were actually unable to locate a solution of adequate fitness, unless the process was started sufficiently close to the optimum to begin with.

* Random search is a closely related family of optimization methods which sample from a hypersphere instead of a normal distribution.
* Luus–Jaakola is a closely related optimization method using a uniform distribution in its sampling and a simple formula for exponentially decreasing the sampling range.
* Pattern search takes steps along the axes of the search-space using exponentially decreasing step sizes.
* Stochastic optimization

<text>John R. Koza is a computer scientist and a former adjunct professor at Stanford University, most notable for his work in pioneering the use of genetic programming for the optimization of complex problems. Koza co-founded Scientific Games Corporation, a company which builds computer systems to run state lotteries in the United States. John Koza is also credited with being the creator of the &#x27;scratch card&#x27; with the help of retail promotions specialist Daniel Bower.

Koza was born in 1944 and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in computer science from the University of Michigan, being the second person to ever earn a bachelor&#x27;s degree in computer science. He earned a doctoral degree in computer science from the University of Michigan in 1972.

Koza was featured in Popular Science for his work on evolutionary programming that alters its own code to find far more complex solutions. The machine, which he calls the &quot;invention machine&quot;, has created antennae, circuits, and lenses, and has received a patent from the US Patent Office.

In the political space, Koza advocates for a plan to revamp the way states choose their electors for the Electoral College in the United States, such that candidates who win the majority of the popular vote would then win a majority of the electors through an interstate compact. He established the organization National Popular Vote Inc. to advocate for state adoption of the policy and the election of supportive candidates.

<doc id="147871" wikidata="Q165714" url="?curid=147871" title="Live (band)">
<text>Live , often typeset as , LĪVE, or +LĪVE+, is an American rock band formed in York, Pennsylvania, in 1984 by Ed Kowalczyk (lead vocals, guitars), Patrick Dahlheimer (bass), Chad Gracey (drums), and Chad Taylor (guitars). As of 2022, Kowalczyk is the only remaining member of the original lineup.

Live earned fame for their single &quot;Operation Spirit (The Tyranny of Tradition)&quot;, whose video received airtime on MTV. Their second album, &quot;Mental Jewelry&quot;, released in 1991, enjoyed modest sales. Their biggest success came in 1994 with their third album, &quot;Throwing Copper&quot;, which sold eight million copies in the U.S. The band had a string of hit singles in the mid-1990s, including &quot;Lightning Crashes&quot;, which stayed at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for ten consecutive weeks and the Modern Rock Tracks (now Alternative Songs) chart for nine weeks from February 25 to April 22, 1995. The band has sold over twenty million albums worldwide.

When touring, Live has used additional musicians, including Kowalczyk&#x27;s younger brother Adam, British keyboardist Michael &quot;Railo&quot; Railton, rhythm guitarist Christopher Thorn of Blind Melon, and guitarist Zak Loy of Alpha Rev.

In 2009, Kowalczyk left the band; he was replaced by singer Chris Shinn and the band released the album &quot;The Turn&quot; in October 2014. Kowalczyk rejoined Live in December 2016 and in 2018, they released a new EP, &quot;Local 717&quot;. Kowalczyk fired Taylor in June 2022 after taking majority control of the band. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reported that Gracey and Dahlheimer have since been let go as well. Kowalczyk began performing as Live with three touring musicians in October 2022.

==History==
===&quot;The Death of a Dictionary&quot; and &quot;Mental Jewelry&quot;: 1984–1992===
Live started in the early 1980s under the name First Aid, as a trio of Taylor, Dahlheimer, and Gracey. Kowalczyk joined in 1984, when the group lost a talent show. They went through various different names, including Action Front, Paisley Blues, and Club Fungus, before settling on Public Affection in January 1987. Gracey picked the name based on a comment by his girlfriend at the time. When the band graduated from high school, they recorded a self-released cassette of original songs, titled &quot;The Death of a Dictionary&quot;, in 1989. In 1990, they released an EP of demos produced by Jay Healy, titled &quot;Divided Mind, Divided Planet&quot;, via their &quot;Black Coffee&quot; mailing list. They played regular concerts at CBGB in New York City, which helped earn them a contract with Radioactive Records in 1991. In June that year, the band changed its name to Live.

Under the new name, the band entered the studio with producer Jerry Harrison (of Talking Heads) and recorded the EP &quot;Four Songs&quot;. The single &quot;Operation Spirit (The Tyranny of Tradition)&quot; went to number nine on the Modern Rock chart and was followed by their debut album, 1991&#x27;s &quot;Mental Jewelry&quot;, which Harrison again produced. Pat Dalheimer said, &quot;So important to have somebody else in the room to help us, especially with arrangements. I mean, we were still learning how to write songs...Jerry just seemed to know everything...this guy&#x27;s a wizard!&quot; Some of the album&#x27;s lyrics, written by Kowalczyk, were inspired by Indian philosopher and writer Jiddu Krishnamurti.

===&quot;Throwing Copper&quot;: 1993–1996===
After appearances on the MTV &quot;120 Minutes&quot; tour, at Woodstock &#x27;94, and on Peter Gabriel&#x27;s WOMAD tour, the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Throwing Copper&quot;, achieved mainstream success. The record featured the singles &quot;I Alone&quot;, &quot;All Over You&quot;, and the number-one US Modern Rock hits &quot;Selling the Drama&quot; and &quot;Lightning Crashes&quot;. &quot;Lightning Crashes&quot; also stayed at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for ten consecutive weeks. The band appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, where they played &quot;I Alone&quot; and &quot;Selling the Drama&quot;, and they performed for the first time in the UK, on &quot;The Word&quot;.

The success of these singles eventually gained &quot;Throwing Copper&quot; the number one position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart on May 6, 1995, its 52nd week on the chart. It was the third longest gap between an album first charting and reaching number one, behind Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s eponymous album in 1976 (58 weeks) and Paula Abdul&#x27;s &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot; in 1989 (64 weeks). It is Live&#x27;s best-selling album to date, having sold eight million copies in the US alone.

===&quot;Secret Samadhi&quot; and &quot;The Distance to Here&quot;: 1997–2000===
The success of &quot;Throwing Copper&quot; helped 1997&#x27;s &quot;Secret Samadhi&quot; (co-produced by the band and Jay Healy) to reach the number one position in its debut on the US album chart. It took its name from Samadhi, a state of Hindu meditation. The album contained four Modern Rock hit singles, but failed to match its predecessor&#x27;s success, with sales reaching two million. The band performed &quot;Lakini&#x27;s Juice&quot; and &quot;Heropsychodreamer&quot; from the album on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

Jerry Harrison returned as co-producer for 1999&#x27;s &quot;The Distance to Here&quot;, which entered the US album chart at number four and featured the hit single &quot;The Dolphin&#x27;s Cry&quot;. In 2000, Live embarked on a co-headlining tour with Counting Crows. On that tour, Counting Crows&#x27; lead singer, Adam Duritz, often joined Live for their performance of &quot;The Dolphin&#x27;s Cry&quot;, while Kowalczyk sang a verse of &quot;Hanginaround&quot; with Counting Crows.

===&quot;V&quot;, &quot;Birds of Pray&quot;, and &quot;Awake: The Best of Live&quot;: 2001–2004===
On September 18, 2001, the experimental &quot;V&quot; (originally to be called &quot;Ecstatic Fanatic&quot;) was released to mixed reviews. The first single was &quot;Simple Creed&quot;, which featured a rap by Tricky, but the events of 9/11, which occurred a week before &quot;V&quot; was released, meant that the melancholic &quot;Overcome&quot; received significant airplay and became the album&#x27;s selling point. &quot;V&quot; reached number 22 in the US. Also in 2001, Live contributed a live version of the song &quot;I Alone&quot; to the charity album &quot;Live in the X Lounge IV&quot;.

In May 2003, the band released the Jim Wirt-produced &quot;Birds of Pray&quot;, which reached number 28 on the US album chart, boosted by the unexpected success of the single &quot;Heaven&quot;, Live&#x27;s first U.S. Hot 100 hit single since &quot;The Dolphin&#x27;s Cry&quot;.

In November 2004, Live released a greatest hits compilation, &quot;&quot;. &quot;Awake&quot; included &quot;We Deal in Dreams&quot;, a previously unreleased song from the &quot;Throwing Copper&quot; sessions, a cover version of Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;I Walk the Line&quot;, and a new version of their song &quot;Run Away&quot;, with Shelby Lynne sharing lead vocals with Kowalczyk. A deluxe version of the album included a DVD with 22 music videos and an interview with Kowalczyk.

===&quot;Songs from Black Mountain&quot;, &quot;Radiant Sea&quot;, and live DVD: 2005–2008===
In 2005, Live signed to Sony BMG Music Entertainment&#x27;s Epic label. They released the album &quot;Songs from Black Mountain&quot; in June 2006. The record peaked at number 52 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, and reached number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Independent album chart. The first single was &quot;The River&quot;.

On season five of &quot;American Idol&quot;, finalist Chris Daughtry was accused of performing Live&#x27;s version of Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;I Walk the Line&quot; and claiming it as his own interpretation. A week later, Daughtry acknowledged this was true and said that Live was one of his favorite bands. In May 2006, Live appeared on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; to address this issue. On August 2, 2008, Daughtry and Live performed the band&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;I Walk the Line&quot; together at the Toms River Fest in Toms River, New Jersey.

On September 14, 2007, Live released &quot;Radiant Sea: A Collection of Bootleg Rarities and Two New Songs&quot;, their first album since 1989 on their own Action Front Records label. The new songs were &quot;Beautiful Invisible&quot; and &quot;Radiant Sea&quot;. Live recorded their first concert DVD in the Netherlands during two shows at the Paradiso on June 30 and July 1, 2008. &quot;Live at the Paradiso – Amsterdam&quot; was released on November 11, 2008, on DVD and CD. Also in 2008, the band headlined a US tour that also featured Blues Traveler and Collective Soul.

An unreleased Live song, &quot;Hold Me Up&quot;, features in the 2008 Kevin Smith film &quot;Zack and Miri Make a Porno&quot;. Smith said, &quot;I first heard (the song) in &#x27;95 when we were putting together the &quot;Mallrats&quot; soundtrack. It was actually in the film for the first test screening, but Live decided they wanted to hold onto it as a potential single off their next album ... When I was editing &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; ... I put in a request for it...again, I was denied. Third time, apparently, was the charm. Needed a song for that sequence in &quot;Zack and Miri&quot; and remembered the Live track. This time, the band signed off on us using the track. Took 13 years, but was worth the wait!&quot; In spite of Smith&#x27;s endorsement, the song does not appear on the movie&#x27;s soundtrack album.

===Kowalczyk&#x27;s departure, the Gracious Few, and &quot;The Turn&quot;: 2009–2015===
After a concert in July 2009, Live announced that the band would take a two-year hiatus to work on other projects. Kowalczyk recorded his solo album &quot;Alive&quot;, and the other band members formed a group with Kevin Martin and Sean Hennesy of Candlebox, called The Gracious Few. That band proceeded to record a self-titled debut album in California for release in September 2010. On November 30, 2009, Taylor revealed that the &quot;hiatus&quot; could become a permanent split. The other members of Live accused Kowalczyk of unreasonable demands in contract and salary negotiations.

On June 8, 2011, Taylor revealed that he, Dahlheimer, and Gracey would restart the band without Kowalczyk. He made no mention of any new lead singer, but said, &quot;We&#x27;ll have to begin addressing the hole left by our singer&#x27;s departure&quot;. He added that, &quot;I need to feel Live once again without the constraints that were placed on it over the last few years. Chad [Gracey], Patrick, and I invested most of our lives to writing, recording, and performing the songs of Live. We deserve a chance to reconnect with the fans to say goodbye to the old era and hello to the new.&quot; Kowalczyk disapproved of their decision. He complained that &quot;they obfuscate that it&#x27;s not the real band. They don&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s not the original lineup. They just kind of go out and surprise people, and it&#x27;s really sort of lame&quot;.

On January 24, 2012, Taylor, Dahlheimer, and Gracey announced that they were leading members in a project to renovate a four-story building at 210 York Street in York. The building housed a technology company, creating sixty new jobs. It also included a brand new recording studio.

Live returned from their nearly three-year hiatus on March 12, 2012, with Chris Shinn, formerly of Unified Theory, as their new lead singer. The new lineup performed before an invited audience at the Strand-Capitol Performing Arts Center in York. They performed with new touring members, including Gracious Few bandmate Sean Hennesy on rhythm guitar and Alexander Lefever on keyboards. In July 2012, Live commenced more legal proceedings against Kowalczyk for misuse of the band&#x27;s name while promoting his live performances. Live&#x27;s first major tour with Shinn was as part of the Summerland Tour 2013, playing 35 shows across the US. Other featured bands were Everclear, Filter, and Sponge.

Live&#x27;s first album to feature Shinn, &quot;The Turn&quot;, was released on October 28, 2014. The record&#x27;s first single, &quot;The Way Around Is Through&quot;, was uploaded to YouTube on September 10, 2014, and officially released on September 16.

During 2014–2015, Kowalczyk embarked on a worldwide tour, playing acoustic &quot;unplugged&quot; shows celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the release of &quot;Throwing Copper&quot;. Zak Loy accompanied Kowalczyk on this tour, playing guitar, mandolin, pedal steel, and singing backing vocals.

===Kowalczyk&#x27;s return and Taylor&#x27;s firing: 2016–present===
On October 24, 2016, Chad Taylor and Ed Kowalczyk, along with singer Zoe LaBelle, took part in an interview for WVYC. Although the primary reason for the interview was to promote new music by LaBelle that Taylor had worked on, it marked the first time that the two former bandmates had publicly appeared together since 2009. Fueling speculation over a possible reunion, the Live Facebook page returned on November 16, 2016, with an early picture of the band&#x27;s original lineup and a new logo. On the same day, Ed Kowalczyk&#x27;s Facebook page was also updated with a new profile picture and cover photo, both displaying the same logo from the band&#x27;s page. Despite the changes on Facebook, Live&#x27;s website remained black until December 9, when a countdown was posted suggesting new information would be released on December 12. Later that day, Live&#x27;s Twitter and Facebook pages announced that the band&#x27;s original lineup had reunited with tour dates in 2017. In autumn 2018, they released the singles &quot;Love Lounge&quot; and &quot;Be a Giver, Man&quot;. On October 12, they released their new EP, &quot;Local 717&quot;.

On June 21, 2022, Kowalczyk announced that Chad Taylor had been fired from the band the day before. Gracey tweeted: &quot;For anyone interested...Ed is not the problem in this band...and it&#x27;s not this Chad...and he doesn&#x27;t play bass. We have among us a person that stirs and then, no pun intended, sells drama.&quot;

In September 2022, Kowalczyk announced that he would be touring as Live without Dahlheimer or Gracey. In a November 2022 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, former lead singer Chris Shinn confirmed that Dahlheimer and Gracey have since been let go as well. This leaves Kowalczyk as the only original member left in the band.

In November 2022, it was reported that Gracey filed a lawsuit against Taylor and Dahlheimer as managers of their company, ThinkLoud. Gracey cited counts of breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.

In February 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; released a detailed article on the discord within the band, mostly focusing on the issues between Chad Taylor and former business partner Billy Hynes. Immediately after the article&#x27;s publication, Hynes sued Taylor for defamation. In August 2023, the Pennsylvania State Police charged Hynes with two felonies involving theft of nearly $4.4 million from the band&#x27;s business and its primary investor, though Hynes and the investor&#x27;s attorney have said that they reached settlement over such issues in August 2022.

In September 2023, Live announced a co-headlining tour of Australia with Incubus for April 2024, marking the first time the two bands have toured together.

<text>George Clinton (July 26, 1739April 20, 1812) was an American soldier, statesman, and a prominent Democratic-Republican in the formative years of the United States of America. Clinton served as the fourth vice president of the United States from 1805 until his death in 1812. He also served as the first governor of New York from 1777 to 1795 and again from 1801 to 1804. Along with John C. Calhoun, he is one of two vice presidents to hold office under two consecutive presidents. He was also the first vice-president to die in office.

Born in the Province of New York, Clinton served in the French and Indian War, rising to the rank of lieutenant in the colonial militia. He began a legal practice after the war and served as a district attorney for New York City. He became Governor of New York in 1777 and remained in that office until 1795. Clinton supported the cause of independence during the American Revolutionary War and served in the Continental Army despite his gubernatorial position. During and after the war, Clinton was an opponent of Vermont&#x27;s entrance into the Union on account of disputes over land claims.

Opposed to the ratification of the United States Constitution, Clinton became a prominent Anti-Federalist and advocated for the addition of the United States Bill of Rights. In the early 1790s, he emerged as a leader of the incipient Democratic-Republican Party, and Clinton served as the party&#x27;s vice presidential candidate in the 1792 presidential election. Clinton received the third most electoral votes in the election, as President George Washington and Vice President John Adams both won re-election. Clinton did not seek re-election in 1795, but served as governor again from 1801 to 1804. He was the longest-serving governor in U.S. history until Terry Branstad surpassed his record in 2015.

Clinton was again tapped as the Democratic-Republican vice presidential nominee in the 1804 election, as President Thomas Jefferson dumped Aaron Burr from the ticket. Clinton sought his party&#x27;s presidential nomination in the 1808 election, but the party&#x27;s congressional nominating caucus instead nominated James Madison. Despite his opposition to Madison, Clinton was re-elected as vice president. Clinton died in 1812, leaving the office of vice president vacant for the first time in U.S. history. Clinton&#x27;s nephew, DeWitt Clinton, continued the Clinton New York political dynasty after his uncle&#x27;s death.

==Early life==
Clinton was born in 1739 in Little Britain, province of New York. His parents were Anglo-Irish Colonel Charles Clinton (1690–1773) and Elizabeth Denniston Clinton (1701–1779), who had left County Longford, Ireland, in 1729 to escape the Penal Laws, a series of laws passed by the Irish Parliament designed to force nonconformists and Catholics to accept the Anglican Church of Ireland. His political interests were inspired by his father, who was a farmer, surveyor, and land speculator, and served as a member of the New York colonial assembly. George Clinton was the brother of General James Clinton and the uncle of New York&#x27;s future governor, DeWitt Clinton. George was tutored by a local Scottish clergyman.

==French and Indian War service==
During the French and Indian War, he first served on the privateer &quot;Defiance&quot; operating in the Caribbean, before enlisting in the provincial militia, where his father held the rank of Colonel. During the French and Indian War George rose to the rank of Lieutenant, accompanying his father in 1758 on Bradstreet&#x27;s 1758 seizure of Fort Frontenac, cutting one of the major communication and supply lines between the eastern centers of Montreal and Quebec City and France&#x27;s western territories. He and his brother James were instrumental in capturing a French vessel.

==Political career==

His father&#x27;s survey of the New York frontier so impressed the provincial governor (also named George Clinton, and &quot;a distant relative&quot;) that he was offered a position as sheriff of New York City and the surrounding county in 1748. After the elder Clinton declined the honor, the governor later designated George as successor to the Clerk of the Ulster County Court of Common Pleas, a position he would assume in 1759 and hold for the next 52 years.
After the war, he read law in New York City under the attorney William Smith. He returned home (which at that time was part of Ulster County) and began his legal practice in 1764. He became district attorney the following year. He was a member of the New York General Assembly for Ulster County from 1768 to 1775, aligned with the anti-British Livingston faction. His brother James was a member of the New York Provincial Congress that assembled in New York City on April 20, 1775.

===Revolutionary War===
As a member of the New York General Assembly, Clinton was a vocal opponent of British imperial policies. In January 1775, he introduced a motion for the Assembly to approve the resolutions of the First Continental Congress. The motion was defeated, prompting Clinton to warn that the colonies would soon need to take to arms. In March 1775, he twice introduced a motion to declare that the British Parliament had no right to levy taxes on American colonies. His actions caught the attention of the Provincial Congress, which elected him to be one of New York&#x27;s delegates to the Second Continental Congress. In Philadelphia, Clinton took his seat in Congress on May 15, 1775. He remained a delegate until July 8, 1776. However, on December 19, 1775, the Provincial Congress commissioned him a brigadier general in New York&#x27;s state militia, tasked with defending the Highlands of the Hudson River from British attack. This role caused him to be absent from many sessions of the Continental Congress. Although he resigned his seat before New York&#x27;s delegates had been granted permission to vote for, or sign, the Declaration of Independence, he was an enthusiastic supporter of American independence, even suggesting in one speech to Congress that a reward should be offered for the assassination of King George III. While commanding forces of the New York state militia, he built two forts along the Hudson River and stretched a giant chain across the river to keep British forces in New York City from sailing northward.

===Wartime governor===
On March 25, 1777, Clinton was commissioned a brigadier general in the Continental Army. In June 1777, he was elected at the same time Governor and Lieutenant Governor of New York. He formally resigned the Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s office and took the oath of office as Governor on July 30. He was re-elected five times, remaining in office until June 1795. Although he had been elected governor, he retained his commission in the Continental Army and commanded forces at Fort Clinton and Fort Montgomery on October 6, 1777. He remained in the Continental Army until it was disbanded on November 3, 1783.
He was known for his hatred of Tories and used the seizure and sale of Tory estates to help keep taxes down. A supporter and friend of George Washington, he supplied food to the troops at Valley Forge, rode with Washington to the first inauguration and gave an impressive dinner to celebrate it. In 1783, at Dobbs Ferry, Clinton and Washington negotiated with General Sir Guy Carleton for the evacuation of the British troops from their remaining posts in the United States. That same year, Clinton became an original member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati and served as its president from 1794 to 1795.

===National leader===
In the early 1780s, Clinton supported Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s call for a stronger federal government than had been provided in the Articles of Confederation. However, Clinton eventually came to oppose Hamilton&#x27;s proposal to allow Congress to impose tariffs, fearing that this power would cut into his home state&#x27;s main source of income. He became one of the most prominent opponents to the ratification of the proposed United States Constitution, which would grant several new powers to the federal government. After New York and other states had ratified the Constitution, Clinton focused on passing constitutional amendments designed to weaken the powers of the federal government. In 1791, three years after the ratification of the Constitution, the states ratified the United States Bill of Rights.

Twentieth-century historian Herbert Storing identifies Clinton as &quot;Cato&quot;, the pseudonymous author of the Anti-Federalist essays which appeared in New York newspapers during the ratification debates. However, the authorship of the essays is disputed.

In the first U.S. presidential election, held from 1788 to 1789, many Anti-Federalists supported Clinton for the position of vice president. Federalists rallied around the candidacy of John Adams, and Adams finished second in the electoral vote behind George Washington, making Adams vice president. Clinton received just three electoral votes, partly because the New York legislature deadlocked and was unable to appoint a slate of electors.

In the 1792 presidential election, he was chosen by the nascent Democratic-Republican Party as their candidate for vice president. While the Republicans joined in the general acclamation of Washington for a second term as president, they objected to the allegedly &quot;monarchical&quot; attitude of Vice President Adams. Clinton was nominated rather than Thomas Jefferson because the Virginia electors could not vote for Washington, and for a second Virginian. Clinton received 50 electoral votes to 77 for Adams. His candidacy was damaged by his anti-Federalist record and by his narrow and disputed re-election as governor in 1792. (He won by only 108 votes, and the substantial anti-Clinton vote of Otsego County was excluded on a technicality.)

He did not run for re-election as governor in 1795. Some Democratic-Republican party leaders attempted to recruit him to run for vice president in 1796 election, but Clinton refused to run and party leaders instead turned to another New Yorker, Aaron Burr. Clinton nonetheless received seven electoral votes. He held no political office after 1795 until he was elected to the New York State Assembly in April 1800, and was a member of the 24th New York State Legislature. He entered the 1801 gubernatorial race at Burr&#x27;s urging, and defeated the Federalist Party nominee, Stephen Van Rensselaer. Clinton served as governor until 1804. With 21 years of service, he was the longest-serving governor of a U.S. state until December 14, 2015, when Iowa governor Terry Branstad surpassed him.

====Threats to conquer Vermont====
The land that is in the present-day state of Vermont was before 1764 a disputed territory claimed by the colonies of New Hampshire and New York. During 1749–1764 it was governed as a &quot;de facto&quot; part of New Hampshire and many thousands of settlers arrived. In 1764 King George III awarded the disputed region, then called the New Hampshire Grants, to New York. New York refused to recognize property claims based on New Hampshire law, thus threatening the eviction of many settlers. Consequently, New York&#x27;s authority was resisted by local authorities and the militia known as the Green Mountain Boys. In 1777, having no further hope of rulings from the king or courts of England to protect their property, the politicians of the disputed territory declared it an independent state to be called Vermont. Vermont&#x27;s repeated petitions for admission to the Union over the next several years were denied by the Continental Congress, in large part because of opposition from the state of New York and its governor George Clinton.

In 1778 Clinton wrote to some Vermonters loyal to New York, encouraging them &quot;to Oppose the ridiculous and destructive Scheme of erecting those Lands into an Independent State.&quot;

On March 2, 1784, the legislature of New York, with Clinton&#x27;s support, instructed its Congressional delegates to &quot;press Congress for a decision in the long protracted controversy&quot; and that New York would have to &quot;recur to force, for the preservation of her lawful authority&quot; and that if Congress would not act, then New York would be &quot;destitute of the protection of the United States.&quot;

However, a Congressional committee recommended recognition of Vermont and its admission to the Union. The committee&#x27;s recommended bill was opposed by New York&#x27;s delegates and did not pass. Six years later the New York legislature decided to give up New York&#x27;s claims to Vermont on the condition that Congress would admit Vermont to the Union, and the new state was admitted on March 4, 1791.

===Vice presidency (1805–1812)===
Clinton was selected as President Jefferson&#x27;s running mate in the 1804 presidential election, replacing Aaron Burr. Vice President Burr had fallen out with the Jefferson administration early in his tenure, and President Jefferson often consulted with Clinton rather than Burr regarding New York appointments. Clinton was selected to replace Burr in 1804 due to his long public service and his popularity in the electorally important state of New York. He was also favored by Jefferson because, at age 69 in 1808, Jefferson hoped that Clinton would be too old to launch a presidential bid against Jefferson&#x27;s preferred successor, Secretary of State James Madison.

When the Democratic-Republican ticket won the 1804 election, Clinton became the fourth vice president of the United States, and would become the first vice president to serve under two presidents, Jefferson and Madison. During his first term as vice president, under Thomas Jefferson, Clinton found himself marginalized by the President, as Jefferson sought to avoid enhancing his vice president&#x27;s stature―still cognizant that Clinton could challenge Madison in 1808. Not only was Clinton largely ignored by President Jefferson, he struggled in his position as President of the Senate. He was unfamiliar with the rules of the Senate, and many senators viewed him as an ineffective presiding officer.

Clinton attempted to challenge Madison for the presidency in the 1808 election, but was outmaneuvered by Madison&#x27;s supporters when the congressional nominating caucus chose him as the vice presidential nominee. Clinton&#x27;s supporters nonetheless put him forward as a presidential candidate, attacking the foreign policy of the Jefferson administration. The Federalist Party considered endorsing Clinton&#x27;s candidacy, but ultimately chose to re-nominate their 1804 ticket of Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and Rufus King. Clinton received just six electoral votes for president as Madison consolidated support within the party. Although Clinton had effectively run against Madison, he received the vice presidential votes of most Democratic-Republican electors, who did not want to set a precedent of defying the choice of the congressional nominating caucus. By his receiving votes for both offices in the 1808 election, Clinton became (and remains) the only person to receive votes in six different electoral college contests.

After the 1808 election, although he was ostensibly a member of the Madison administration, Clinton and his supporters frequently opposed Madison. Clinton helped block the appointment of Albert Gallatin as Secretary of State. He also cast an important tie-breaking vote that prevented the recharter of the First Bank of the United States.

==Death==

In his eighth year as Vice President (his fourth under President Madison), George Clinton died from a heart attack on April 20, 1812, at the age of 72. Clinton was the first vice president to die in office as well as the first vice president to die overall. Clinton was the first of two vice presidents to serve in the position under two different presidents, the other being John C. Calhoun.

His original burial was in Washington, D.C. He was re-interred at the Old Dutch Churchyard in Kingston, New York, in 1908.

Clinton&#x27;s nephew, DeWitt Clinton, challenged Madison in 1812 after George Clinton&#x27;s death. DeWitt Clinton won the backing of most Federalists, but was nonetheless defeated by Madison.

==Marriage and children==
On February 7, 1770, Clinton married Sarah Cornelia Tappen (died 1800); they had five daughters and one son. Only three of them outlived their father, and the longest-lived child died at the age of just 45.

# Catharine Clinton (1770–1811); married firstly, to John Taylor, and secondly Pierre Van Cortlandt, Jr.
# Cornelia Tappen Clinton (1774–1810); married Edmond-Charles Genêt
# George Washington Clinton (1778–1813); married Anna Floyd, daughter of William Floyd
# Elizabeth Clinton (1780–1825); married Matthias B. Tallmadge
# Martha Washington Clinton (1783–1795)
# Maria Clinton (1785–1829); married Dr. Stephen D. Beekman, a grandson of Pierre Van Cortlandt

==Legacy==

Historian Alan Taylor described George Clinton as &quot;The astutest politician in Revolutionary New York,&quot; a man who &quot;understood the power of symbolism and the new popularity of a plain style especially when practiced by a man with the means and accomplishments to set himself above the common people.&quot; His marriage to Cornelia Tappen strengthened his political position in heavily Dutch Ulster County.

Clinton County, New York; Clinton County, Ohio; the village of Clinton, Oneida County, New York (site of Hamilton College), and Clintonville, Columbus, Ohio are all named for him.

In 1873, the state of New York donated a bronze statue of Clinton to the U.S. Capitol&#x27;s National Statuary Hall Collection. In 1787 Clinton was depicted on an unauthorized copper coin minted privately in New York with &quot;EXCELSIOR&quot; on reverse.

He was depicted in the painting &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot; by John Trumbull even though he neither signed it nor was present when it was signed. In 1976 the painting appeared on the reverse of the two dollar bill and printed again in series 1995 and 2003.

In 2000, the State of New York ceremonially renamed the Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge in honor of Clinton.

<doc id="147873" wikidata="Q214289" url="?curid=147873" title="Michelle Yeoh">
<text>Yeoh Choo Kheng (; born 6 August 1962), known professionally as Michelle Yeoh (), is a Malaysian actress. She is the recipient of various accolades, including an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award. Credited as Michelle Khan in her early films, she rose to fame in the 1980s and 1990s after starring in Hong Kong action and martial arts films where she performed her own stunts. These roles included &quot;Yes, Madam&quot; (1985), &quot;Magnificent Warriors&quot; (1987), &quot;Police Story 3: Super Cop&quot; (1992), &quot;The Heroic Trio&quot;, &quot;Tai Chi Master&quot; (both 1993), and &quot;Wing Chun&quot; (1994).

After moving to the United States, Yeoh gained international recognition for starring in the James Bond film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; (1997) and in Ang Lee&#x27;s wuxia martial arts film &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; (2000); the latter gained her a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. Her Hollywood career progressed with roles in &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; (2005), &quot;Sunshine&quot; (2007), and &quot;The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor&quot; (2008). She continued to appear in Hong Kong and Chinese cinema, starring in &quot;True Legend&quot;, &quot;Reign of Assassins&quot; (both 2010), &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny&quot; (2016), and &quot;Master Z: Ip Man Legacy&quot; (2018). In 2011, she portrayed Aung San Suu Kyi in the British biographical film &quot;The Lady&quot;.

Yeoh played supporting roles in the romantic comedies &quot;Crazy Rich Asians&quot; (2018) and &quot;Last Christmas&quot; (2019), as well as in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&quot; (2021) and the television series &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; (2017–2020). Her voice acting work has included &quot;Kung Fu Panda 2&quot; (2011), &quot;&quot; (2022), and &quot;&quot; (2023). For her starring role as Evelyn Quan Wang in &quot;Everything Everywhere All at Once&quot; (2022), she won the Academy Award for Best Actress, becoming the first Asian to win the category, and the first Malaysian to win an Academy Award. She has since featured in the mystery film &quot;A Haunting in Venice&quot; (2023) and the musical fantasy film &quot;Wicked&quot; (2024).

The film review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes ranked her the greatest action heroine of all time in 2008. In 1997, she was chosen by &quot;People&quot; as one of the &quot;50 Most Beautiful People in the World&quot;, and in 2009 the same magazine listed her as one of the &quot;35 All-Time Screen Beauties&quot;. In 2022, &quot;Time&quot; named her one of the world&#x27;s 100 most influential people on its annual listicle and its Icon of the Year. In 2024, she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

== Early life and education ==
Yeoh was born on 6 August 1962 in Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia, to Janet Yeoh and Yeoh Kian-teik. Her father was elected as a Senator of Malaysia from 1959 to 1969 as a member of Perak&#x27;s Malaysian Chinese Association, the Chairman of the Perak Bar Association, and the founder of &quot;Sri Maju&quot; in 1975, a major intercity coach service in Malaysia and Singapore. Of Hokkien and Cantonese ancestry, she grew up speaking English to her father, the family&#x27;s native Malay Chinese, and could understand some Malaysian Cantonese from her maternal grandmother who lived with them. She learned to speak Cantonese and Mandarin fluently in the 1980s and 1990s after starting her career in Hong Kong. Despite that, she never learned to read or write Chinese characters, which she has said was her greatest regret.

Yeoh was keen on dance from an early age, beginning ballet at age four. She went to the girls school Main Convent Ipoh. At age 15, she moved with her parents to the United Kingdom. There, she was enrolled in The Hammond School, Chester, where she started to train as a ballet dancer. However, a spinal injury prevented her from becoming a professional ballet dancer, and she shifted her attention to choreography and other arts. She received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Crewe + Alsager College of Higher Education in 1983.

== Career ==
===Early career and first retirement (1983–1991)===
In 1983, twenty-year-old Yeoh won the Miss Malaysia World contest. She was Malaysia&#x27;s representative at the Miss World 1983 pageant in London, where she placed eighteenth. Later that year, she traveled to Australia where she won the 1984 Miss Moomba International pageant. Her first acting work was in a television commercial for Guy Laroche watches with Jackie Chan. This caught the attention of a fledgling Hong Kong film production company, D&amp;B Films. Although she had a passive understanding of the Ipoh Cantonese spoken in her hometown, she could not speak it. During a phone call in Cantonese, she was offered to co-star in a television commercial with a Sing Long, and only realized that was Jackie Chan&#x27;s Cantonese name when she arrived in the studio. She learned to speak Cantonese as she began her career in Hong Kong.

Yeoh began her acting career in action and martial arts films, in which she performed her own stunts. Yeoh&#x27;s first lead role came in her third film, &quot;Yes, Madam&quot; (1985). Yeoh initially used the pseudonym Michelle Khan, a stage name selected by D&amp;B Films for its potential appeal to international and Western audiences. In 1987, Yeoh married her first husband Dickson Poon, a co-founder of D&amp;B Films, and decided to retire from acting.

===Return as an action star (1992–2001)===

After five years of marriage, Yeoh divorced Poon and returned to acting with &quot;Police Story 3: Super Cop&quot; (1992). She appeared in &quot;The Heroic Trio&quot; (1993), and the Yuen Woo-ping films &quot;Tai Chi Master&quot; and &quot;Wing Chun&quot; in 1993 and 1994, respectively.

She changed her stage name back to Michelle Yeoh when she started her Hollywood career with &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; in 1997. In the 1997 James Bond film, she played Wai Lin opposite star Pierce Brosnan. Brosnan was impressed, describing her as a &quot;wonderful actress&quot; who was &quot;serious and committed about her work.&quot; He referred to her as a &quot;female James Bond&quot; in reference to her combat abilities. Yeoh wanted to perform her own stunts but was prevented because director Roger Spottiswoode considered it too dangerous. Nevertheless, she performed all of her own fighting scenes.

In 1997, Yeoh played Soong Ai-ling in the award-winning &quot;The Soong Sisters&quot;. Yeoh was approached by director Ang Lee to star as Yu Shu Lien in her first Mandarin-language martial arts film &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; (2000). She did not speak Mandarin until the 2000s, and she had to learn the Mandarin lines for &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; phonetically. The film was an international success, and earned Yeoh a BAFTA 2000 nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role.

===Career fluctuations (2002–2016)===

In 2002, Yeoh produced her first English film, &quot;The Touch&quot;, through her own production company Mythical Films. In 2004, Yeoh met Jean Todt, a French motor racing executive, in Shanghai during a publicity event for Ferrari. They became engaged later that same year.

In 2005, Yeoh starred as Mameha in the film adaptation of &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;, and she continued her English-language work in 2007 with &quot;Sunshine&quot;. In 2008, Yeoh starred in the fantasy action film &quot;The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor&quot; with Brendan Fraser and Jet Li. In 2011, she portrayed Aung San Suu Kyi in Luc Besson&#x27;s &quot;The Lady&quot;. Yeoh was blacklisted by the Burmese government allegedly because of her participation in &quot;The Lady&quot;; she was refused entry to Myanmar on 22 June 2011 and was deported on the same day.

In October 2011, Yeoh was chosen by Guerlain to be its skincare ambassador. Yeoh&#x27;s role was to help strengthen the French cosmetics company&#x27;s relationship with Asia.

Yeoh did not branch out into television until 2015, with her first role playing Mei Foster, wife to the British Ambassador to Thailand, who is secretly a North Korean spy named Li-Na, on the fifth season of the Cinemax/Sky series &quot;Strike Back&quot;.

===Supporting roles (2017–2020)===
In 2016, Yeoh was cast as Starfleet Captain Philippa Georgiou of the starship USS &quot;Shenzhou&quot; in the series &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, and recurs as Georgiou&#x27;s &quot;mirror&quot; doppelganger later in the series. Yeoh went on to play the role for three seasons, garnering critical acclaim and becoming a fan favourite. Following the success of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, a spinoff series with Yeoh in the leading role, was commissioned in 2019. The series, which would centre on Yeoh&#x27;s character, Emperor Georgiou working as a member of Section 31, a secret galactic spy organization, was still &quot;in development&quot; as of January 2023, but in April, Paramount+ announced it had ordered a &quot;Star Trek: Section 31&quot; feature film starring Yeoh, rather than a series.

In 2018, Yeoh played family matriarch Eleanor Young in Jon M. Chu&#x27;s &quot;Crazy Rich Asians&quot;, a film adaptation of Kevin Kwan&#x27;s book of the same name, opposite Constance Wu and Henry Golding. Carlos Aguilar of &quot;TheWrap&quot; described her performance as &quot;convincingly subdued&quot;. In 2019, she played Christmas themed-store owner &quot;Santa&quot; in &quot;Last Christmas&quot;, opposite Henry Golding and Emilia Clarke. The film was a box office success, grossing over $121 million worldwide. Yeoh played Ying Nan in Marvel Studios&#x27; &quot;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&quot; (2021), directed by Destin Daniel Cretton. It was announced at The Game Awards 2020 that Yeoh would star in &quot;Ark: The Animated Series&quot;, a series based on the video game &quot;&quot; by Studio Wildcard, in which she plays the role of Meiyin Li, a 3rd-century Chinese rebel leader, known as the Beast Queen.

===Award success (2021–present)===

In 2022, Yeoh starred in the science fiction surreal comedy film &quot;Everything Everywhere All at Once&quot; from filmmaking duo Daniels, released in March 2022 to widespread critical acclaim. In the film, she played struggling laundromat owner Evelyn Quan Wang, a role that was widely praised by critics, with David Ehrlich of &quot;IndieWire&quot; claiming it the &quot;greatest performance that Michelle Yeoh has ever given&quot;. It was for this role that Yeoh earned her first Golden Globe win (becoming the first Malaysian actor to win Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy at the Golden Globes), her first Independent Spirit nomination and win, her first Oscar nomination and win, her second BAFTA nomination, and her first Critics&#x27; Choice Awards nomination. Additionally, she became the first Asian woman to win any individual lead film category in the Screen Actors Guild Awards, winning the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role. She also became the first Malaysian to be nominated for and win an Academy Award, and the first Asian and second &quot;woman of color&quot; to win the Academy Award for Best Actress.

Yeoh appeared in the Disney+ series &quot;American Born Chinese&quot;, based on the book of the same name by Gene Luen Yang. She starred as a psychic medium alongside Kenneth Branagh in &quot;A Haunting in Venice&quot;, released in 2023. In the same year, Yeoh became an International Olympic Committee member, and delivered a speech at Harvard Law School&#x27;s 2023 class day. 

In January 2024 , she led the eight-part action comedy series &quot;The Brothers Sun&quot; for Netflix, which received generally positive reviews. She has since starred as Madame Morrible in the two-part film adaptation of the musical &quot;Wicked&quot; directed by Jon M. Chu, with the first film released in November 2024, and slated for November 2025. 

In May 2024, Yeoh was cast in a lead role as a replicant alongside Hunter Schafer in the Amazon science-fiction television series &quot;Blade Runner 2099&quot;. She will also star as human scientist Dr. Karina Mogue in &quot;Avatar 4&quot;, set to release on December 21, 2029.

== Activism ==
Michelle Yeoh devotes a large part of her time to charitable and social endeavors, including disaster relief, HIV/AIDS, poverty reduction, animal conservation, gender equality and road safety. She has been an ambassador and leading campaigner for FIA&#x27;s Make Roads Safe campaign to be recognized as a global public health and development priority since 2008. Among many activities on behalf of the campaign, she promoted safer road design at the events around the world, spoke at the United Nations General Assembly, Asia Development Bank, World Bank, walked to promote traffic safety at the Formula One race, and launched the Call for a Decade of Action for Road Safety at an event in Vietnam organized by the Asia Injury Prevention Foundation. She also filmed a documentary on global road safety, &quot;Turning Point&quot;, a version of which was shown on BBC World News.

Michelle Yeoh has donated her time as a WildAid ambassador for endangered animals and is a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for the Sustainable Development Goals initiative since 2016. Yeoh is a patron of the Save China&#x27;s Tigers project committed to protecting the endangered South China tiger. She also joined UNDP&#x27;s first-ever animal ambassadors, two panda cubs, to kick off the Pandas for the Global Goals campaign. In order to raise awareness about wildlife conservation and climate change, she collaborated with National Geographic to produce the documentary &quot;Among the Great Apes with Michelle Yeoh&quot;, while emphasizing the importance of responsible consumerism, sustainable fashion, and ethical business practices. In 2013, she changed to the role of executive producer for the project &quot;Pad Yatra: A Green Odyssey&quot;. The film recorded a journey of 700 people, led by the 12th Gyalwang Drukpa, to the perilous Himalayan mountain range. They traveled 450 miles, planted 50.000 trees, and educated the villagers on environmental responsibility.

Yeoh&#x27;s activism extends to health and well-being issues, ranging from patrons to ambassadors, through organizations including AIDS Concern, Hong Kong Cancer Fund, amfAR, Live To Love, and Paris Brain Institute. She also joined UNAIDS&#x27;s commissioner team, and serves on the board of directors of the Suu Foundation, a non-political charity established to support the health, education, human rights, and development of the people of Myanmar. As one of the survivors of the 2015 Nepal earthquake, after evacuation, she returned to the disaster-hit country to help rehabilitate affected people and donate 100.000 euros for victims.

Throughout her career, Yeoh has always portrayed strong roles and been defiant in working against stereotypes. After &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, she did not work for almost two years due to the stereotypical roles offered to her in America. She told &quot;People&quot;: &quot;At that point (1990s), people in the industry couldn&#x27;t really tell the difference between whether I was Chinese, Japanese, Korean or if I even spoke English. They would talk very loudly and very slowly&quot;. She has long spoken out about racism in Hollywood, typically in her awards acceptance speech at the Golden Globes. The day after her Oscar win, she published an opinion essay in &quot;The New York Times&quot; calling for true gender equality.

== Personal life ==

Yeoh was married to Hong Kong entrepreneur Dickson Poon, known for his ownership of businesses such as Harvey Nichols and Charles Jourdan, from 1988 to 1992. From 1998 to 2000, Yeoh dated and was eventually engaged to Alan Heldman, an American cardiologist.

In 2004, she started dating Jean Todt, then the general manager and CEO of Scuderia Ferrari and later the president of the FIA. On 26 July 2004, the couple got engaged. As of 2019, she lives in Geneva, Switzerland, with Todt. In an Instagram post, former Scuderia Ferrari driver Felipe Massa said that Yeoh and Todt were married on 27 July 2023 in Geneva.

Yeoh does not have any children, and has cited her inability to have children as the reason for ending her first marriage.

Yeoh is Buddhist and an activist. Yeoh expressed her support for Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak and the political coalition Barisan Nasional ahead of the 2013 Malaysian general election. In 2022, she told &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; that Shakespeare and Stephen King were her favorite authors and that Tarzan was her favorite fictional hero.

<text>Meccano is a brand of construction set created in 1898 by Frank Hornby in Liverpool, England. The system consists of reusable metal strips, plates, angle girders, wheels, axles and gears, and plastic parts that are connected using nuts and bolts. It enables the building of working models and mechanical devices.

In 1913, a very similar construction set was introduced in the United States under the brand name Erector. In 1990, Meccano bought the Erector brand and unified its presence on all continents. In 2013, the Meccano brand was acquired by the Canadian toy company Spin Master. Meccano maintained a manufacturing facility in Calais, France until 2023.

== History ==
=== First sets ===
In 1901 Frank Hornby, a clerk from Liverpool, England, invented and patented a new toy called &quot;Mechanics Made Easy&quot; that was based on the principles of mechanical engineering. It was a model construction kit consisting of perforated metal strips, plates and girders, with wheels, pulleys, gears, shaft collars and axles for mechanisms and motion, and nuts and bolts and set screws to connect the pieces. The perforations were at a standard spacing, the axles were 8-gauge, and the nuts and bolts used BSW threads. The only tools required to assemble models were a screwdriver and spanners (wrenches). It was more than just a toy: it was educational, teaching basic mechanical principles like levers and gearing.

The parts for Hornby&#x27;s new construction kit were initially supplied by outside manufacturers, but as demand began to exceed supply, Hornby set up his own factory in Duke Street, Liverpool. As the construction kits gained in popularity they soon became known as Meccano and went on sale across the world. In September 1907, Hornby registered the Meccano trademark, and in May 1908, he formed Meccano Ltd. To keep pace with demand, a new Meccano factory was built in Binns Road, Liverpool in 1914, which became Meccano Ltd&#x27;s headquarters for the next 60 years. Hornby also established Meccano factories in France, Spain and Argentina. The word &quot;Meccano&quot; was thought to have been derived from the phrase &quot;Make and Know&quot;.

The first construction sets had parts that were rather crudely made: the metal strips and plates had a tinplate finish, were not rounded at the ends and were not very sturdy. But manufacturing methods were improving all the time and by 1907 the quality and appearance had improved considerably: the metal strips were now made of thicker steel with rounded ends and were nickel-plated, while the wheels and gears were machined from brass.

The first sets under the new Meccano name were numbered 1 to 6. In 1922 the No. 7 Meccano Outfit was introduced, which was the largest set of its day, and the most sought after because of its model building capabilities and prestige.

In 1926, to mark the 25th anniversary of his patent, Hornby introduced &quot;Meccano in Colours&quot; with red and green coloured Meccano pieces. Initially plates were a light red and items like the braced girders were a pea-green. However, the following year strips and girders were painted dark green, the plates Burgundy red, while the wheels and gears remained brass. In 1934, the Meccano pieces changed colour again: the strips and girders became gold while the plates were changed to blue with gold criss-cross lines on them, but only on one side, the reverse remaining plain blue. This new colour scheme was only available in the United Kingdom until the end of the Second World War in 1945. The old red and green sets were still produced for the export market and were re-introduced in the UK after the war.

=== Heyday ===
In 1934, the nine basic Meccano outfits (numbered 00 to 7) were replaced by eleven outfits, labelled 0, A to H, K and L, the old No. 7 Outfit becoming the L Outfit. In 1937, the alphabetical outfit series was replaced by a numeric series, 0 to 10, the L Outfit being replaced by the smaller No. 10 Outfit. Although having fewer pieces than the L Outfit, the No. 10 Outfit became Meccano&#x27;s flagship set and remained relatively unchanged until it was discontinued a half-century later in 1992. Accessory sets were retained, numbered 1A to 9A, that converted a set to the next in the series (for example, accessory set 6A would convert a No. 6 set to a No. 7 set). As had been the case from early days, Meccano Ltd would also supply individual Meccano parts to complement existing sets.

The Second World War interrupted the production of Meccano in England when the Binns Road factory converted to manufacturing for the war effort. The Korean War in 1950 also disrupted production due to a metal shortage and it was not until the mid-1950s that Meccano production returned to normal with new parts being added to all the sets.

In 1955, outfits 00 to 10 as well as conversion sets 00A to 9A were available.

In 1958, the colours were changed slightly to what became known as &#x27;light red and green&#x27; but this incarnation had the shortest lifespan as the colours changed dramatically in 1964 to the black and yellow colour scheme. However, this light red and green period did see the introduction of about 90 new parts, more modern packaging, a new cabinet was introduced for the number 10 set, the first plastic parts were introduced, and the &quot;exploded diagram&quot; instructions made their début.

In 1961, a Mechanisms Outfit and a Gears Outfit were added to the range, and in 1962 outfit 00 was withdrawn.

=== Takeovers ===
In the early 1960s, Meccano Ltd experienced financial problems and was purchased by Lines Bros Ltd (who operated under the brand name &quot;Tri-ang&quot;) in 1964. In an attempt to redefine Meccano&#x27;s image, the colour scheme was changed again, this time to yellow and black plates, with silver strips and girders. The silver was soon replaced by zinc in 1967 when it was found that the silver pieces marked easily. The colours of yellow and black were chosen because they were the colours typically used by most large construction vehicles of the day.

In 1970, electronic parts were introduced, and the current black-coloured plates were changed to blue. The range of sets was reduced by one with the deletion of the old No. 9 set and the renumbering of the old No. 0 to 8 sets to No. 1 to 9. The No. 10 set remained unchanged.

Lines Brothers went into voluntary liquidation in 1971 and Airfix Industries purchased the Meccano business in the UK and General Mills of the US purchased the French business. The French company was known as Miro Meccano. In 1973, outfits 1 to 10 were still available, but new kits were added: Army Multikit, Highway Multikit, Pocket Meccano, and two Clock Kits.

In 1978, the range of Meccano sets was further reduced and changed with the replacement of the No. 2 to 8 sets by six completely new sets, labelled A and 1 to 5. The old No. 9 and 10 sets were left largely unchanged. While some Airfix divisions were profitable, particularly their model kits, they needed to save money. With unions threatening all out industrial action if there were any job losses, Airfix shut down the Binns Road factory, bringing to an end the manufacture of Meccano in England. Meccano still continued to be manufactured in France, as the British and French businesses had different owners.

At the time in the seventies, Meccano France SA launched and produced brand new dark blue MECCANO Construction Kits Set 1 to set 10 Boxes Model Range until the early 1990s. These were also sold in conjunction with the smaller &quot;Complementary Sets CX Series&quot; so that the builders could make more technical and more realistic working models with his own existing normal sets, making it more demanding and harder per kit for the builder or owner as the sequence MECCANO Set 1 TO Set 10 was available.

=== General Mills acquires all rights to Meccano === 

In 1981, General Mills bought up Airfix Products and with it what was left of Meccano Ltd UK, giving it complete control of the Meccano franchise. All the existing Meccano sets were scrapped and a totally new range of sets were designed for production in Calais, France called &quot;Meccano Junior&quot;, a new product range consisting of plastic construction kits with tools included, although these new sets would only allow the young builder to make small models.

=== Meccano becomes independent === 

In 1985, General Mills left the toy business completely, selling off their toy divisions. Meccano was sold out to a French accountant, Marc Rebibo, and, once again, all existing Meccano sets were scrapped. The &quot;Meccano Junior&quot; sets were replaced with three &quot;Premier Meccano&quot; sets and two &quot;Motor&quot; sets (including a six-speed motor) were introduced. Due to high demand, the old Meccano No.1 to No.10 construction sets from 1981 were re-introduced.

In 1989, Marc Rebibo sold what remained of Meccano to Dominique Duvauchelle. Allen head zinc plated steel bolts replaced the original slot-headed brass-plated bolts and the &quot;Plastic Meccano Junior&quot; sets were brought back. With younger model builders in mind, many theme sets were also introduced, including the &quot;Construction and Agricultural&quot; 200-Series &amp; 300-Series, the &quot;Space&quot; 100-Series, and the &quot;Dynamic&quot; 400-Series minisets. The old-style No. 5 to 10 sets remained in production until 1992.

In 1994, additional theme sets were introduced and a pull-back friction motor was added to the Plastic Meccano System. In 1996, &quot;Action Control&quot; sets with infrared controls were added and 1999 saw the introduction of a &quot;Motion System&quot; range of sets that changed the look of Meccano completely. There were six one-model sets, two five-model sets, and five new sets numbered 10 to 50, the 20 to 50 sets being motorised. A complete change from the normal practice (sticking to a single majority colour) was that every set had its own colour scheme, often in bright neon colours.

In 2000, Nikko, a Japanese toy manufacturer, purchased 49 per cent of Meccano and took on its marketing internationally through its established channels for radio-controlled toys. Development and design remained with Meccano SN, based in Calais, France. Nikko launched a successful range of new sets, including &quot;Crazy Inventors&quot; and the &quot;Future Master&quot; range. Significantly, Nikko radio control and programmable electronics started to appear in the System. However, under commercial pressure, Nikko sold its interest in the Meccano name and System back to Meccano SN, the French parent company, in August 2007. During 2013, the Meccano brand was acquired in its entirety by the Canadian toy company Spin Master.

Meccano today is very different from its heyday in the 1930s to 1950s. The target market of youngsters has not changed significantly; however, the mass market, instant-appeal approach does not always satisfy serious Meccano enthusiasts. For example, it is often difficult to obtain original spares.

Many parts were introduced since the Liverpool factory closed under the French-and-Japanese running of the company. These included plastic parts, can motors, and modern battery holders. Metal became an expensive raw material to work with and many of the metal parts were replaced with plastic parts. Allen (hex-headed) zinc electroplated steel bolts replaced the slotted bolts.

Original specialist parts, such as very long (up to ) angle girders, loom shuttles, printing rollers, etc. often required for large Super Models are becoming more difficult to obtain. There are replica manufacturers who satisfy the needs of enthusiasts who wish to build models requiring these parts.

What has remained the same during all these years is the Imperial perforation spacing and the inch whitworth thread for nuts and bolts (and other threaded parts). These unchanged standards and complete interchangeability of parts results in many modern models functioning perfectly with Meccano components that are more than 100 years old and vice versa. Indeed, old and new parts can be intermixed with impunity, the only problem being the odd mixture of colour schemes.

=== Spin Master era ===

In 2013, Canadian toy company Spin Master acquired Meccano. It launched &quot;Meccano Evolution&quot;, a new &quot;back to basics&quot; iteration of Meccano, which allowed smaller and more detailed models to be built using simpler and more &quot;functional&quot; parts than were supplied in previous &quot;new Meccano&quot; sets. Meccano Evolution has narrower strips, with holes spaced at twice the density of the original system. In late 2013, the company also opened a public &quot;Meccano Lab&quot; play space and R&amp;D centre, in Calais, France.

In 2015, Spin Master launched Meccanoids, Meccano modular robots.

In February 2023, Spin Master said the Calais factory would close as it was still losing money. The factory closed on 31 October 2023.

In January 2025, Spin Master announced it was licensing Meccano to British toy company Addo Play under a long-term agreement. Addo Play has agreed to develop, design and manufacture a refreshed line-up of Meccano products. These will include play-sets, junior products and collaborations.

== Components ==

With a Meccano set there was a wide range of models that could be built. Here are the models for which instructions were given in the largest set of the late 1950s, the &quot;Outfit 10&quot;:

:&quot;&quot;Railway Service Crane&quot;, &quot;Sports Motor Car&quot;, &quot;Coal Tipper&quot;, &quot;Cargo Ship&quot;, &quot;Double Decker Bus&quot;, &quot;Lifting Shovel&quot;, &quot;Blocksetting Crane&quot;, &quot;Beam Bridge&quot;, &quot;Dumper Truck&quot;, &quot;Automatic Gantry Crane&quot;, &quot;Automatic Snow Loader&quot;, &quot;4-4-0 Passenger Locomotive&quot;

On top of these there were instruction leaflets available for:

:&quot;Combine Harvester&quot;, &quot;The Eiffel Tower&quot;, &quot;Showman&#x27;s Traction Engine&quot;, &quot;Twin-Cylinder Motor Cycle Engine&quot;, &quot;Trench Digger&quot;, &quot;Bottom Dump Truck&quot;, &quot;Road Surfacing Machine&quot;, &quot;Mechanical Loading Shovel&quot;&quot;

The instructions sometimes contained errors, which caused difficulty for small children.

Since this time, enthusiasts such as G. Maurice Morris and MW Models have taken to publishing their own model plans, ranging from small models up to large and complex machines.

=== Motors ===

The current range of Meccano electric motors are small DC types designed to run on domestic batteries. These are low-torque high-speed &quot;can&quot; motors. These are inexpensive and suitable for small models that a child might construct from the standard range of sets. Adult enthusiasts tend to use a wider range of high-performance motors that are better suited to powering large models. During Meccano&#x27;s heyday, the electric motors available were universal wound (for use on DC or AC supplies) that were called the MECCANO MOTOR M-Series in the 1970s; these electric motors ranged from 3 volt to the E20R 20 volt Electric Reversible Motor depending on the motor model. They became better known as the M1, M3 and M5 Electric Motors. Particularly well known were the E020, E20R and E15R universal motors, issued after the Second World War.

These could be run from a mains Meccano Transformer No.T20 1 AMP 20 Volts Set or, in the case of the E15R, a 12 V car battery. Earlier there had been short-lived (and potentially lethal) mains motors designed for DC mains with a domestic lightbulb in series to drop the voltage, followed by motors of the post-War pattern but wound for 4.5 or 6 V DC and suited to lead/acid accumulator power. These, as well as the latter accumulator are now rare if in good condition.

For many years, live steam engines were made and sold under the Meccano brand, although they were not made by Meccano. Earlier examples were just vertical steam engines, typical of the time, sold under the Meccano name. The first to be specially designed for Meccano was introduced in 1929. This was a vertically boilered engine in a chassis designed to facilitate it being integrated into Meccano models.

From 1965 to 1976, Mamod made a steam engine for Meccano, the design of which was based on the 1929 version, with a similar chassis but using a standard Mamod horizontal boiler and engine parts. The model had no official model number, being known simply as the Meccano steam engine. However, it has since become generally known as the MEC1. Even after it was no longer being sold under the Meccano name, Mamod continued to manufacture the same model (with minor differences) until 1985, under their own name with the model number SP3.

There were also at least three different clockwork motors sold under the Meccano brand name (&quot;Magic&quot;, No.1 and No.2). The No.2 motor was made for Meccano by Märklin in Germany.

== Compatible kits ==

Some model construction kits are compatible with Meccano. One example is the Swiss brand , which has been manufactured since 1941. Their elements are mainly made of thick stable metal in order to fit to the general approach of Swiss Quality. Other examples are Exacto and .

Meccano has always had several compatible products on the market (such as X-Series Meccano, Plastic Meccano, Mogul Toys and Speed-Play). In 2007, a plastic robot named &quot;Spykee&quot; arrived. The robot is controlled using a WiFi interface and has a webcam but cannot climb stairs as is sometimes claimed. It can also be controlled over the Internet and configured as a security camera. The robot is primarily packaged in a single plastic base component and comprises additional bolt-on plastic parts that are present for aesthetic purposes only (i.e. the arms do not function). The robot base does include some standard Meccano hole spacing. By September 2008, the Spykee robot family numbers five, with each robot having different capabilities.

Since the 1920s, construction kits compatible with Meccano were manufactured in the Soviet Union. They did not have a uniform colour scheme, parts could be in any colour. Usually the strips and girders were not painted, and the plates could be either unpainted or painted in red, yellow, and blue. In the 1970s, plastic parts were introduced. The (, &quot;Outlook&quot;) plant in Moscow produced some sets which included electrical motors and gears. The largest set of the 1970s–1980s was called (, &quot;Adolescence-3&quot;) and contained about 200 parts. The (&quot;Adolescence&quot;) series were practically identical to Meccano sets with the same number, but there is no evidence of larger sets (equivalent to No. 4 or larger) being produced. There were instructions for building 44 models. Today, many similar kits, mostly Russian and Chinese-produced, are being sold in Russia.

Unlike the Czech Merkur sets, the Soviet ones used mixed Metric and Imperial measurements despite the latter having been abandoned in Russia since the 1920s. The spacing between holes was and the hole diameter was , but the nuts and bolts included were metric.

From the mid-1910s, in the US, there was a system called Erector, invented by A.C. Gilbert. Erector was largely compatible with Meccano. A.C. Gilbert died in 1961, and the company went into decline, filing for bankruptcy in 1967. After several changes of ownership, in 2000, Meccano bought the Erector brand and unified its presence on all continents.

In 1934, Meccano began to be used in the construction of differential analysers, a type of analogue computer used to solve differential equations using methods which have since been superseded by the digital computer. Though invented on paper in the 19th century, the first such machine had only been built in 1931, and normally they would be built by specialist manufacturers, at great cost.

For example, in 1947, UCLA in the US installed a differential analyser built for them by General Electric at a cost of $125,000. However, a &quot;proof of concept&quot; model of a differential analyser which made extensive use of Meccano parts was built at Manchester University, England, in 1934, by Douglas Hartree and Arthur Porter: use of Meccano meant that the machine was cheap to build, and it proved &quot;accurate enough for the solution of many scientific problems&quot;. This machine is now in the Science Museum in London.

A similar machine built by J.B. Bratt at Cambridge University in 1935 is now in the Museum of Transport &amp; Technology collection in Auckland, New Zealand. After a lengthy period of neglect, a restoration effort began in 2003, and a successful &quot;full run through&quot; of this machine was completed on 16 December 2008.

A memorandum written for the British military&#x27;s Armament Research Department in 1944 describes how this same machine was modified during the Second World War for improved reliability and enhanced capability, and identifies its wartime applications as including research on the flow of heat, explosive detonations, and simulations of transmission lines.

The memorandum is now in The National Archives, UK. It has been said that this machine was used in preparation for Operation Chastise, otherwise known as the &quot;Dam Busters raid&quot;; However after extensive enquiries and literature searches over the last few years, no evidence can be found that the Differential Analyser no. 2, nor any other differential analyser, was used for this purpose.

In 1949, an Erector set was used to build the precursor to the modern artificial heart by William Sewell and William Glenn of the Yale School of Medicine. The external pump successfully bypassed the heart of a dog for more than an hour.

In the 1970s, information theory pioneer Claude Shannon constructed a bounce-juggling machine from an Erector set.

In the late 1980s, with an Erector Set, various old toys, and bits of jewellery, Jack Kevorkian jury-rigged a machine he called the Thanatron (later renamed to the Mercitron.) Three bottles were suspended from a beam: one filled with a saline solution to open a patient&#x27;s veins, another with barbiturates for sedation, and a third with potassium chloride to stop the heart. The concept was that the doctor connected the patient to an IV, and the patient would pull a chain on the device to start the lethal medications flowing. He called it his &quot;Rube Goldberg suicide device&quot;.

In 2005, Tim Robinson displayed his own Meccano differential analyser at the Computer History Museum, at Mountain View, California, US, and Robinson has also built and exhibited two models of Charles Babbage&#x27;s difference engine, also using Meccano.

In 1990 Meccano S.A. built a giant Ferris wheel in France. It was modelled after the original 1893 Ferris Wheel built by George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition at Chicago and was shipped to the United States to promote &quot;Erector Meccano&quot; after Meccano S.A. had bought out the &quot;Erector&quot; trade name and began selling Meccano sets in the U.S. It went on display in New York City after which it was purchased by Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not! and put on display in their St. Augustine, Florida museum. The model, the largest at the time, was high, weighs , was made from 19,507 pieces, 50,560 nuts and bolts, and took 1,239 hours to construct. At this mass and size, some deviation from Meccano-only parts was a necessity, to prevent it collapsing (mainly in the structural spokes). The largest model by mass would certainly be in contention but some models have topped .

In the late 1990s, engineer Mark Sumner utilised Erector to create a working model for &quot;Soarin&#x27;&quot;, an attraction at Disney&#x27;s California Adventure in Anaheim, California and Walt Disney World&#x27;s Epcot near Orlando, Florida.

A large model, weighing approximately and long, was built in September 2009 by TV presenter James May and a team of volunteers from the engineering department of the University of Liverpool, who created a Meccano bridge spanning the Leeds &amp; Liverpool Canal in Liverpool. As with other models of this size and weight some non-Meccano parts were used. It was built from &quot;[about] 100,000 pieces of real Meccano&quot;, taking 1,100 hours, and consisted of a &quot;swing bridge&quot; section, and a &quot;drawbridge&quot; section. A contender for the largest model on record was built in 2014 by Graham Shepherd of Grahamstown, South Africa. The fully motorised Krupp 288 Bucket Wheel Excavator (as used on large opencast mining) is complete with auxiliary conveyors. Construction utilised Meccano parts as well as replica and strengthened parts (thickened profile plates and high tensile bolts in areas carrying large loads). Shepherd reports the model as being in mass and tall. It required substantial timber support frames to facilitate final assembly.

Meccano and Erector remain very versatile constructional mediums. Almost any mechanical device can be built with these systems, from structures, to complex working cranes, automatic gearboxes or clocks.

== Popularity and influence ==

Frank Hornby launched the Meccano Guild in 1919, to encourage boys of all ages—as well as early clubs—to become part of a central organisation, which oversaw club formation, and set guidelines for club proceedings. The &quot;Meccano Magazine&quot; was used as a means to keep Guild clubs informed of each other&#x27;s activities (as well as encourage the sales of Meccano).

The International Society of Meccanomen was founded in 1989 in England, nine years after the Liverpool factory closed. This organisation is considered the modern replacement of the Guild system and now has some 600 members in over 30 countries.

Today, over one hundred years since its inception, there are thousands of Meccano enthusiasts worldwide, many clubs and hundreds of websites covering Meccano history, model building instructions and nostalgia. Individuals and companies worldwide still manufacture parts, some long out of production. There are annual Meccano exhibitions around the world, notably in France (at a different venue around May each year) and at Skegness in England (around July every year). Many notable shows also take place in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand each year, to name a few.

Publications devoted fully or in part to Meccano included &quot;Meccano Magazine&quot; from 1916 to 1981, and numerous Special Model Leaflets aimed at serious enthusiasts, on how to construct very large, complex models and machines. Some models use many more parts than an entire Set 10. The original large models from the 1930s model leaflets are called the Meccano Super Models, often popular at Meccano and other model engineering exhibitions and sometimes used as nostalgic showpieces by retailers. Modern dedicated publications include: &quot;Constructor Quarterly&quot;, &quot;The International Meccanoman&quot; and the &quot;ModelPlans&quot; series of instructions. These feature large model instructions and ideas for enthusiasts. There are also a myriad of club-generated periodicals, featuring Meccano content and keeping enthusiasts in touch.

The careers many people chose were influenced by their experience and knowledge gained from using the product.

Meccano is mentioned in the first chapter of Graham Greene&#x27;s novel &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot;. It also mentioned at some length in J. J. Connington&#x27;s 1928 detective novel, &quot;Nemesis at Raynham Parva&quot; (U.S. title, &quot;Grim Vengeance&quot;, 1929).

Pierre Bastien is a French musical artist who has created a large collection of kinetic experimental musical instruments constructed with Meccano.

In Sydney, Australia an overhead gantry with directional signs and traffic lights erected in 1962 is named the Meccano Set.

Arthur C. Clarke mentions his childhood fascination with Meccano and his return to it as an adult in his 1989 memoir, &quot;Astounding Days: A Science Fictional Autobiography&quot;.

On 6 April 2013 a new footbridge was opened at Nob End, Little Lever, Bolton, Manchester over the Bolton and Bury Canal. It is made of Meccano parts, including bolts and nuts, accurately scaled up by ten times.

Meccano is the centrepiece of the Mentoring Using Meccano program of School Volunteer Program ACT. Volunteers use Meccano to mentor bright primary school students who need help in improving their communication or social skills, which builds students&#x27; self-esteem.

<doc id="147880" wikidata="Q1102020" url="?curid=147880" title="Cliveden set">
<text>The Cliveden set were an upper-class group of politically influential people active in the 1930s in the United Kingdom, prior to the Second World War. They were in the circle of Nancy Astor, Viscountess Astor, the first female Member of Parliament to take up her seat. The name comes from Cliveden, a stately home in Buckinghamshire that was Astor&#x27;s country residence. 

The &quot;Cliveden Set&quot; tag was coined by Claud Cockburn in his journalism for the communist newspaper &quot;The Week&quot;. His notion of an upper class pro-German conspiracy was widely accepted by opponents of Appeasement in the late 1930s. It was long accepted that the aristocratic Germanophile social network supported friendly relations with Nazi Germany and helped create the 1930s policy of appeasement. John L. Spivak, writing in 1939, devoted a chapter to the Cliveden Set. 

After the end of World War II in Europe, the discovery of the Nazis&#x27; &quot;Black Book&quot; in September 1945 showed that all the group&#x27;s members were to be arrested as soon as Britain had been invaded by the Axis. Lady Astor remarked, &quot;It is the complete answer to the terrible lie that the so-called &#x27;Cliveden Set&#x27; was pro-Fascist.&quot; 

New research shows that the Astors invited a very wide range of guests, including socialists, communists and enemies of appeasement. Scholars no longer claim there was any Cliveden conspiracy. Historian Andrew Roberts says: &quot;The myth of Cliveden being a nest of appeasers, let alone pro-Nazis, is exploded.&quot; Norman Rose&#x27;s 2000 account of the group rejects the conspiracy theory of a pro-Nazi cabal. Carroll Quigley argues against the &quot;mistaken idea&quot; that the Cliveden group was pro-German: &quot;They were neither anti-German in 1910 nor Pro-German in 1938, but pro-Empire all the time.&quot;

Christopher Sykes, in a sympathetic 1972 biography of Nancy Astor, argued that the entire story about the Cliveden Set had been an ideologically motivated fabrication by Cockburn that came to be generally accepted by the public, which was looking for scapegoats for the British prewar appeasement of Adolf Hitler. Some academic arguments have stated that Cockburn&#x27;s account may have not have been entirely accurate, but that his main allegations cannot be easily dismissed.

==Alleged conspirators==
* Nancy Astor, Viscountess Astor, politician and socialite
* Geoffrey Dawson, editor of the London &quot;Times&quot; newspaper
* Philip Kerr (Lord Lothian), author and politician
* Edward Wood (Lord Halifax), politician
* William Montagu, 9th Duke of Manchester, politician
* Robert Brand

==Fictional portrayals==
===&quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;===
In the fourth and fifth episodes of season six of the 1960s sitcom &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, the two-part episode &quot;Lady Chitterly&#x27;s Lover&quot; involves a plot to negotiate Britain&#x27;s surrender from a fictitious member of the Cliveden Set, Sir Charles Chitterly. While this is based on no direct historical counterpart, it does incorporate – among other events – elements of the visit to Nazi Germany in the late 1930s of the former British King Edward VIII after he had abdicated the throne in 1936 and settled into exile in France.

===&quot;The Remains of the Day&quot;===
Lord Darlington, the fictional secondary protagonist in Nobel Prize-winning British author Sir Kazuo Ishiguro&#x27;s 1989 novel &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; is based on an amalgamation of several of the more prominent members of the Cliveden Set, some of whom are listed above. The novel was turned into the 1993 film of the same name which was nominated for eight Academy Awards and six BAFTA Awards, including a BAFTA win for Sir Anthony Hopkins in the Best Actor category. The social gatherings that are held at the fictional Darlington Hall in the film between Nazis and British subjects seeking peace and being manipulated by the Nazi representatives are based on several dinner parties and other social gatherings that were held by the Cliveden Set.

<text>In political science, power is the ability to influence or direct the actions, beliefs, or conduct of actors. Power does not exclusively refer to the threat or use of force (coercion) by one actor against another, but may also be exerted through diffuse means (such as institutions). 

Power may also take structural forms, as it orders actors in relation to one another (such as distinguishing between a master and an enslaved person, a householder and their relatives, an employer and their employees, a parent and a child, a political representative and their voters, etc.), and discursive forms, as categories and language may lend legitimacy to some behaviors and groups over others.

The term &quot;authority&quot; is often used for power that is perceived as legitimate or socially approved by the social structure. 

Scholars have distinguished between soft power and hard power.

== Theories ==

=== Five bases of power ===
In a now-classic study (1959), social psychologists John R. P. French and Bertram Raven developed a schema of sources of power by which to analyse how power plays work (or fail to work) in a specific relationship.

According to French and Raven, power must be distinguished from influence in the following way: power is that state of affairs that holds in a given relationship, A-B, such that a given influence attempt by A over B makes A&#x27;s desired change in B more likely. Conceived this way, power is fundamentally &quot;relative;&quot; it depends on the specific understandings A and B each apply to their relationship and requires B&#x27;s recognition of a quality in A that would motivate B to change in the way A intends. A must draw on the &#x27;base&#x27; or combination of bases of power appropriate to the relationship to effect the desired outcome. Drawing on the wrong power base can have unintended effects, including a reduction in A&#x27;s own power.

French and Raven argue that there are five significant categories of such qualities, while not excluding other minor categories. Further bases have since been adduced, in particular by Gareth Morgan in his 1986 book, &quot;Images of Organization&quot;.

==== Legitimate power ====

Also called &quot;positional power&quot;, legitimate power is the power of an individual because of the relative position and duties of the holder of the position within an organization. Legitimate power is formal authority delegated to the holder of the position. It is usually accompanied by various attributes of power, such as a uniform, a title, or an imposing physical office.

In simple terms, power can be expressed as being &quot;upward&quot; or &quot;downward&quot;. With downward power, a company&#x27;s superiors influence subordinates to attain organizational goals. When a company exhibits upward power, subordinates influence the decisions of their leader or leaders.

==== Referent power ====

Referent power is the power or ability of individuals to attract others and build loyalty. It is based on the charisma and interpersonal skills of the powerholder. A person may be admired because of a specific personal trait, and this admiration creates the opportunity for interpersonal influence. Here, the person under power desires to identify with these personal qualities and gains satisfaction from being an accepted follower. Nationalism and patriotism count towards an intangible sort of referent power. For example, soldiers fight in wars to defend the honor of the country. This is the second-least obvious power but the most effective. Advertisers have long used the referent power of sports figures for product endorsements, for example. The charismatic appeal of the sports star supposedly leads to an acceptance of the endorsement, although the individual may have little real credibility outside the sports arena. Abuse is possible when someone who is likable yet lacks integrity and honesty rises to power, placing them in a situation to gain personal advantage at the cost of the group&#x27;s position. Referent power is unstable alone and is not enough for a leader who wants longevity and respect. When combined with other sources of power, however, it can help a person achieve great success.

==== Expert power ====

Expert power is an individual&#x27;s power deriving from the skills or expertise of the person and the organization&#x27;s needs for those skills and expertise. Unlike the others, this type of power is usually highly specific and limited to the particular area in which the expert is trained and qualified. When they have knowledge and skills that enable them to understand a situation, suggest solutions, use solid judgment, and generally outperform others, then people tend to listen to them. When individuals demonstrate expertise, people tend to trust them and respect what they say. As subject-matter experts, their ideas will have more value, and others will look to them for leadership in that area.

==== Reward power ====

Reward power depends on the ability of the power wielder to confer valued material rewards; it refers to the degree to which the individual can give others a reward of some kind, such as benefits, time off, desired gifts, promotions, or increases in pay or responsibility. This power is obvious, but it is also ineffective if abused. People who abuse reward power can become pushy or be reprimanded for being too forthcoming or &#x27;moving things too quickly&#x27;. If others expect to be rewarded for doing what someone wants, there is a high probability that they will do it. The problem with this basis of power is that the rewarder may not have as much control over rewards as may be required. Supervisors rarely have complete control over salary increases, and managers often cannot control all actions in isolation; even a company CEO needs permission from the board of directors for some actions. When an individual uses up available rewards or the rewards do not have enough perceived value for others, their power weakens. One of the frustrations of using rewards is that they often need to be bigger each time if they are to have the same motivational impact. Even then, if rewards are given frequently, people can become so satiated by the reward it loses its effectiveness.

In terms of cancel culture, the mass ostracization used to reconcile unchecked injustice and abuse of power is an &quot;upward power.&quot; Policies for policing the internet against these processes as a pathway for creating due process for handling conflicts, abuses, and harm that is done through established processes are known as &quot;downward power.&quot;

==== Coercive power ====
Coercive power is the application of negative influences. It includes the ability to defer or withhold other rewards. The desire for valued rewards or the fear of having them withheld can ensure the obedience of those under power. Coercive power tends to be the most obvious but least effective form of power, as it builds resentment and resistance from the people who experience it. Threats and punishment are common tools of coercion. Implying or threatening that someone will be fired, demoted, denied privileges, or given undesirable assignments – these are characteristics of using coercive power. Extensive use of coercive power is rarely appropriate in an organizational setting, and relying on these forms of power alone will result in a very cold, impoverished style of leadership. This is a type of power commonly seen in the fashion industry by coupling with legitimate power; it is referred to in the industry-specific literature as &quot;glamorization of structural domination and exploitation&quot;.

=== Principles in interpersonal relationships ===
According to Laura K. Guerrero and Peter A. Andersen in &quot;Close Encounters: Communication in Relationships&quot;:
* Power as a perception: Power is a perception in the sense that some people can have objective power but still have trouble influencing others. People who use power cues and act powerfully and proactively tend to be perceived as powerful by others. Some people become influential even though they do not overtly use powerful behavior.
* Power as a relational concept: Power exists in relationships. The issue here is often how much relative power a person has in comparison to one&#x27;s partner. Partners in close and satisfying relationships often influence each other at different times in various arenas.
* Power as resource-based: Power usually represents a struggle over resources. The more scarce and valued resources are, the more intense and protracted the power struggles. The scarcity hypothesis indicates that people have the most power when the resources they possess are hard to come by or are in high demand. However, scarce resources lead to power only if they are valued within a relationship.
* The principle of least interest and dependence power: The person with less to lose has greater power in the relationship. Dependence power indicates that those who are dependent on their relationship or partner are less powerful, especially if they know their partner is uncommitted and might leave them. According to interdependence theory, the quality of alternatives refers to the types of relationships and opportunities people could have if they were not in their current relationship. The principle of least interest suggests that if a difference exists in the intensity of positive feelings between partners, the partner who feels the most positive is at a power disadvantage. There&#x27;s an inverse relationship between interest in a relationship and the degree of relational power.
* Power as enabling or disabling: Power can be enabling or disabling. Research has shown that people are more likely to have an enduring influence on others when they engage in dominant behavior that reflects social skill rather than intimidation. Personal power is protective against pressure and excessive influence by others and/or situational stress. People who communicate through self-confidence and expressive, composed behavior tend to be successful in achieving their goals and maintaining good relationships. Power can be disabling when it leads to destructive patterns of communication. This can lead to the chilling effect, where the less powerful person often hesitates to communicate dissatisfaction, and the demand withdrawal pattern, which is when one person makes demands and the other becomes defensive and withdraws (Mawasha, 2006). Both effects have negative consequences for relational satisfaction.
* Power as a prerogative: The prerogative principle states that the partner with more power can make and break the rules. Powerful people can violate norms, break relational rules, and manage interactions without as much penalty as powerless people. These actions may reinforce the powerful person&#x27;s dependence on power. In addition, the more powerful person has the prerogative to manage both verbal and nonverbal interactions. They can initiate conversations, change topics, interrupt others, initiate touch, and end discussions more easily than less powerful people. (See expressions of dominance.)

=== Rational choice framework ===

Game theory, with its foundations in the Walrasian theory of rational choice, is increasingly used in various disciplines to help analyze power relationships. One rational-choice definition of power is given by Keith Dowding in his book &quot;Power&quot;.

In rational choice theory, human individuals or groups can be modelled as &#x27;actors&#x27; who choose from a &#x27;choice set&#x27; of possible actions in order to try to achieve desired outcomes. An actor&#x27;s &#x27;incentive structure&#x27; comprises (its beliefs about) the costs associated with different actions in the choice set and the likelihoods that different actions will lead to desired outcomes.

In this setting, we can differentiate between:
# outcome power – the ability of an actor to bring about or help bring about outcomes;
# social power – the ability of an actor to change the incentive structures of other actors in order to bring about outcomes.

This framework can be used to model a wide range of social interactions where actors have the ability to exert power over others. For example, a &#x27;powerful&#x27; actor can take options away from another&#x27;s choice set; can change the relative costs of actions; can change the likelihood that a given action will lead to a given outcome; or might simply change the other&#x27;s beliefs about its incentive structure.

As with other models of power, this framework is neutral as to the use of &#x27;coercion&#x27;. For example, a threat of violence can change the likely costs and benefits of different actions; so can a financial penalty in a &#x27;voluntarily agreed&#x27; contract, or indeed a friendly offer.

=== Cultural hegemony ===
In the Marxist tradition, the Italian writer Antonio Gramsci elaborated on the role of ideology in creating a cultural hegemony, which becomes a means of bolstering the power of capitalism and of the nation-state. Drawing on Niccolò Machiavelli in &quot;The Prince&quot; and trying to understand why there had been no Communist revolution in Western Europe while it was claimed there had been one in Russia, Gramsci conceptualised this hegemony as a centaur, consisting of two halves. The back end, the beast, represented the more classic material image of power: power through coercion, through brute force, be it physical or economic. But the capitalist hegemony, he argued, depended even more strongly on the front end, the human face, which projected power through &#x27;consent&#x27;. In Russia, this power was lacking, allowing for a revolution. However, in Western Europe, specifically in Italy, capitalism had succeeded in exercising &quot;consensual&quot; power, convincing the working classes that their interests were the same as those of capitalists. In this way, a revolution had been avoided.

While Gramsci stresses the significance of ideology in power structures, Marxist-feminist writers such as Michele Barrett stress the role of ideologies in extolling the virtues of family life. The classic argument to illustrate this point of view is the use of women as a &#x27;reserve army of labour&#x27;. In wartime, it is accepted that women perform masculine tasks, while after the war, the roles are easily reversed. Therefore, according to Barrett, the destruction of capitalist economic relations is necessary but not sufficient for the liberation of women.

=== Tarnow ===
Eugen Tarnow considers what power hijackers have over air plane passengers and draws similarities with power in the military. He shows that power over an individual can be amplified by the presence of a group. If the group conforms to the leader&#x27;s commands, the leader&#x27;s power over an individual is greatly enhanced, while if the group does not conform, the leader&#x27;s power over an individual is nil.

=== Foucault ===

For Michel Foucault, the real power will always rely on the ignorance of its agents. No single human, group, or actor runs the dispositif (machine or apparatus), but power is dispersed through the apparatus as efficiently and silently as possible, ensuring its agents do whatever is necessary. It is because of this action that power is unlikely to be detected and remains elusive to &#x27;rational&#x27; investigation. Foucault quotes a text reputedly written by political economist Jean Baptiste Antoine Auget de Montyon, entitled (1778), but turns out to be written by his secretary Jean-Baptise Moheau (1745–1794), and by emphasizing biologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who constantly refers to milieus as a plural adjective and sees into the milieu as an expression as nothing more than water, air, and light confirming the genus within the milieu, in this case the human species, relates to a function of the population and its social and political interaction in which both form an artificial and natural milieu. This milieu (both artificial and natural) appears as a target of intervention for power, according to Foucault, which is radically different from the previous notions on sovereignty, territory, and disciplinary space interwoven into social and political relations that function as a species (biological species). Foucault originated and developed the concept of &quot;docile bodies&quot; in his book &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot;. He writes, &quot;A body is docile that may be subjected, used, transformed and improved.

=== Clegg ===
Stewart Clegg proposes another three-dimensional model with his &quot;circuits of power&quot; theory. This model likens the production and organization of power to an electric circuit board consisting of three distinct interacting circuits: episodic, dispositional, and facilitative. These circuits operate at three levels: two are macro and one is micro. The &quot;episodic circuit&quot; is at the micro level and is constituted of irregular exercise of power as agents address feelings, communication, conflict, and resistance in day-to-day interrelations. The outcomes of the episodic circuit are both positive and negative. The &quot;dispositional circuit&quot; is constituted of macro level rules of practice and socially constructed meanings that inform member relations and legitimate authority. The &quot;facilitative circuit&quot; is constituted of macro level technology, environmental contingencies, job design, and networks, which empower or disempower and thus punish or reward agency in the episodic circuit. All three independent circuits interact at &quot;obligatory passage points&quot;, which are channels for empowerment or disempowerment.

=== Galbraith ===
John Kenneth Galbraith (1908–2006) in &quot;The Anatomy of Power&quot; (1983)
summarizes the types of power as &quot;&quot; (based on force), &quot;compensatory&quot; (through the use of various resources) or &quot;conditioned&quot; (the result of persuasion), and the sources of power as &quot;personality&quot; (individuals), &quot;property&quot; (power-wielders&#x27; material resources), and/or &quot;organizational&quot; (from sitting higher in an organisational power structure).

=== Gene Sharp ===
Gene Sharp, an American professor of political science, believes that power ultimately depends on its bases. Thus, a political regime maintains power because people accept and obey its dictates, laws, and policies. Sharp cites the insight of Étienne de La Boétie.

Sharp&#x27;s key theme is that power is not monolithic; that is, it does not derive from some intrinsic quality of those who are in power. For Sharp, political power, the power of any state – regardless of its particular structural organization – ultimately derives from the subjects of the state. His fundamental belief is that any power structure relies upon the subjects&#x27; obedience to the orders of the ruler(s). If subjects do not obey, leaders have no power.

His work is thought to have been influential in the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević, in the 2011 Arab Spring, and other nonviolent revolutions.

=== Björn Kraus ===
Björn Kraus deals with the epistemological perspective on power regarding the question of the possibilities of interpersonal influence by developing a special form of constructivism (named relational constructivism). Instead of focusing on the valuation and distribution of power, he asks first and foremost what the term can describe at all. Coming from Max Weber&#x27;s definition of power, he realizes that the term power has to be split into &quot;instructive power&quot; and &quot;destructive power&quot;. More precisely, instructive power means the chance to determine the actions and thoughts of another person, whereas destructive power means the chance to diminish the opportunities of another person. How significant this distinction really is, becomes evident by looking at the possibilities of rejecting power attempts: Rejecting instructive power is possible; rejecting destructive power is not. By using this distinction, proportions of power can be analyzed in a more sophisticated way, helping to sufficiently reflect on matters of responsibility. This perspective permits people to get over an &quot;either-or-position&quot; (either there is power or there is not), which is common, especially in epistemological discourses about power theories, and to introduce the possibility of an &quot;as well as-position&quot;.

=== Unmarked categories ===
The idea of &quot;unmarked categories&quot; originated in feminism. As opposed to looking at social difference by focusing on what or whom is perceived to be different, theorists who use the idea of unmarked categories insist that one must also look at how whatever is &quot;normal&quot; comes to be perceived as unremarkable and what effects this has on social relations. Attending the &quot;un&quot;marked category is thought to be a way to analyze linguistic and cultural practices to provide insight into how social differences, including power, are produced and articulated in everyday occurrences.

Feminist linguist Deborah Cameron describes an &quot;unmarked&quot; identity as the default, which requires no explicit acknowledgment. Heterosexuality, for instance, is unmarked, assumed as the norm, unlike homosexuality, which is &quot;marked&quot; and requires clearer signaling as it differs from the majority. Similarly, masculinity is often unmarked, while femininity is marked, leading to studies that examine distinctive features in women’s speech, whereas men’s speech is treated as the neutral standard.

Although the &quot;unmarked&quot; category is typically not explicitly &quot;noticed&quot; and often goes overlooked, it is still necessarily &quot;visible&quot;.

=== Counterpower ===

The term &#x27;counter-power&#x27; (sometimes written &#x27;counterpower&#x27;) is used in a range of situations to describe the countervailing force that can be utilised by the oppressed to counterbalance or erode the power of elites. A general definition has been provided by the anthropologist David Graeber as &#x27;a collection of social institutions set in opposition to the state and capital: from self-governing communities to radical labor unions to popular militias&#x27;. Graeber also notes that counter-power can also be referred to as &#x27;anti-power&#x27; and &#x27;when institutions [of counter-power] maintain themselves in the face of the state, this is usually referred to as a &#x27;dual power&#x27; situation&#x27;. Tim Gee, in his 2011 book &quot;Counterpower: Making Change Happen&quot;, put forward the theory that those disempowered by governments&#x27; and elite groups&#x27; power can use &quot;counterpower&quot; to counter this. In Gee&#x27;s model, &quot;counterpower&quot; is split into three categories: &quot;idea counterpower&quot;, &quot;economic counterpower&quot;, and &quot;physical counterpower&quot;.

Although the term has come to prominence through its use by participants in the global justice/anti-globalization movement of the 1990s onwards, the word has been used for at least 60 years; for instance, Martin Buber&#x27;s 1949 book &#x27;Paths in Utopia&#x27; includes the line &#x27;Power abdicates only under the stress of counter-power&#x27;.

=== Other theories ===
* Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) defined power as a man&#x27;s &quot;present means, to obtain some future apparent good&quot; (&quot;Leviathan&quot;, Ch. 10).
* The ideas of David Hume (1711-1776) on the undesirable excesses with which monotheistic intolerance can consolidate power have had wide resonance.
* The thought of Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) underlies much 20th-century analysis of power. Nietzsche disseminated ideas on the &quot;will to power&quot;, which he saw as the domination of other humans as much as the exercise of control over one&#x27;s environment.
* Some schools of psychology, notably those associated with Alfred Adler (1870–1937), place power dynamics at the core of their theory (where orthodox Freudians might place sexuality).
* Paul Tillich (1886–1965) saw law as structuring/expressing power and developing through &quot;sacramental&quot; (community) and theocratic stages before reaching a secular rational mode.
* Rodolfo Henrique Cerbaro suggests understanding power as &quot;what counts as a means of determining a subject&#x27;s position in a given competition&quot;.

== Psychological research ==
Recent experimental psychology suggests that the more power one has, the less one takes on the perspective of others, implying that the powerful have less empathy. Adam Galinsky, along with several coauthors, found that when those who are reminded of their powerlessness are instructed to draw Es on their forehead, they are 3 times more likely to draw them such that they are legible to others than those who are reminded of their power. Powerful people are also more likely to take action. In one example, powerful people turned off an irritatingly close fan twice as much as less powerful people. Researchers have documented the bystander effect: they found that powerful people are three times as likely to first offer help to a &quot;stranger in distress&quot;.

A study involving over 50 college students suggested that those primed to feel powerful through stating &#x27;power words&#x27; were less susceptible to external pressure, more willing to give honest feedback, and more creative. In one paper, power was defined &quot;as a possibility to influence others.&quot;Research experiments were done as early as 1968 to explore power conflict. One study concluded that facing one with more power leads to strategic consideration whereas facing one with less power leads to a social responsibility.

===Bargaining games===
There have also been studies aimed at comparing behavior done in different situations were individuals were given power. In an &quot;ultimatum game&quot;, the person in given power offers an ultimatum and the recipient would have to accept that offer or else both the proposer and the recipient will receive no reward. In a &quot;dictator game&quot;, the person in given power offers a proposal and the recipient would have to accept that offer. The recipient has no choice of rejecting the offer. The dictator game gives no power to the recipient whereas the ultimatum game gives some power to the recipient. The behavior observed was that the person offering the proposal would act less strategically than would the one offering in the ultimatum game. Self-serving also occurred and a lot of pro-social behavior was observed.

When the counterpart recipient is completely powerless, lack of strategy, social responsibility and moral consideration is often observed from the behavior of the proposal given (the one with the power).

== Tactics ==
Tactics that political actors use to obtain their goals include using overt , collaboration, or even manipulation. One can classify such power tactics along three different dimensions:
# Soft and hard: Soft tactics take advantage of the relationship between the influencer and the target. They are more indirect and interpersonal (e.g., collaboration, socializing). Conversely, hard tactics are harsh, forceful, direct, and rely on concrete outcomes. However, they are not more powerful than soft tactics. In many circumstances, fear of social exclusion can be a much stronger motivator than some kind of physical punishment.
# Rational and nonrational: Rational tactics of influence make use of reasoning, logic, and sound judgment, whereas nonrational tactics may rely on emotionality or misinformation. Examples of each include bargaining and persuasion, and evasion and put-downs, respectively.
# Unilateral and bilateral: Bilateral tactics, such as collaboration and negotiation, involve reciprocity on the part of both the person influencing and their target. Unilateral tactics, on the other hand, develop without any participation on the part of the target. These tactics include disengagement and the deployment of &quot;fait accomplis&quot;.

People tend to vary in their use of power tactics, with different types of people opting for different tactics. For instance, interpersonally oriented people tend to use soft and rational tactics. Moreover, extroverts use a greater variety of power tactics than do introverts. People will also choose different tactics based on the group situation, and based on whom they wish to influence. People also tend to shift from soft to hard tactics when they face resistance.

=== Balance of power ===
Because power operates both relationally and reciprocally, sociologists speak of the &quot;balance of power&quot; between parties to a relationship:
all parties to all relationships have &quot;some&quot; power: the sociological examination of power concerns itself with discovering and describing the relative strengths: equal or unequal, stable or subject to periodic change. Sociologists usually analyse relationships in which the parties have relatively equal or nearly equal power in terms of &quot;constraint&quot; rather than of power. In this context, &quot;power&quot; has a connotation of unilateralism. If this were not so, then all relationships could be described in terms of &quot;power&quot;, and its meaning would be lost. Given that power is not innate and can be granted to others, to acquire power one must possess or control a form of power currency.

=== Political power in authoritarian regimes ===
In authoritarian regimes, political power is concentrated in the hands of a single leader or a small group of leaders who exercise almost complete control over the government and its institutions. Because some authoritarian leaders are not elected by a majority, their main threat is that posed by the masses. They often maintain their power through political control tactics like:

# Repression: The state targets actors who challenge their beliefs. Can be done directly or indirectly.
#:* Autocrats repress actors they perceive as having irreconcilable interests, and cooperate with those they think have reconcilable ones.
#:* Because of preference falsification- distinguishing between an individual&#x27;s private preference and public preference- sometimes repression in itself is not enough.
# Indoctrination: The state controls public education and uses propaganda to diffuse its views and values into society. 
#:* A one standard deviation increase in pro-regime propaganda reduces the odds of protest the following day by 15%. 
# Coercive distribution: The state distributes welfare and resources to keep people dependent while offering benefits to people they know they can manipulate. 
# Infiltration: The state assigns people to go into grassroot level to sway the public in favor of the authoritarian regime. 

Although several regimes follow these general forms of control, different authoritarian sub-regime types rely on different political control tactics.

== Effects ==
Power changes those in the position of power and those who are targets of that power.

=== Approach/inhibition theory ===
Developed by D. Keltner and colleagues, approach/inhibition theory assumes that having power and using power alters psychological states of individuals. The theory is based on the notion that most organisms react to environmental events in two common ways. The reaction of &quot;approach&quot; is associated with action, self-promotion, seeking rewards, increased energy and movement. &quot;Inhibition&quot;, on the contrary, is associated with self-protection, avoiding threats or danger, vigilance, loss of motivation and an overall reduction in activity.

Overall, approach/inhibition theory holds that power promotes approach tendencies, while a reduction in power promotes inhibition tendencies.

=== Positive ===
* Power prompts people to take action
* Makes individuals more responsive to changes within a group and its environment
* Powerful people are more proactive, more likely to speak up, make the first move, and lead negotiation 
* Powerful people are more focused on the goals appropriate in a given situation and tend to plan more task-related activities in a work setting
* Powerful people tend to experience more positive emotions, such as happiness and satisfaction, and they smile more than low-power individuals
* Power is associated with optimism about the future because more powerful individuals focus their attention on more positive aspects of the environment
* People with more power tend to carry out executive cognitive functions more rapidly and successfully, including internal control mechanisms that coordinate attention, decision-making, planning, and goal-selection

=== Negative ===
*Powerful people are prone to take risky, inappropriate, or unethical decisions and often overstep their boundaries
* They tend to generate negative emotional reactions in their subordinates, particularly when there is a conflict in the group 
* When individuals gain power, their self-evaluation become more positive, while their evaluations of others become more negative
* Power tends to weaken one&#x27;s social attentiveness, which leads to difficulty understanding other people&#x27;s point of view
* Powerful people also spend less time collecting and processing information about their subordinates and often perceive them in a stereotypical fashion
* People with power tend to use more coercive tactics, increase social distance between themselves and subordinates, believe that non-powerful individuals are untrustworthy, and devalue work and ability of less powerful individuals

== Reactions ==

=== Tactics ===
A number of studies demonstrate that harsh power tactics (e.g. punishment (both personal and impersonal), rule-based sanctions, and non-personal rewards) are less effective than soft tactics (expert power, referent power, and personal rewards). It is probably because harsh tactics generate hostility, depression, fear, and anger, while soft tactics are often reciprocated with cooperation. Coercive and reward power can also lead group members to lose interest in their work, while instilling a feeling of autonomy in one&#x27;s subordinates can sustain their interest in work and maintain high productivity even in the absence of monitoring.

Coercive influence creates conflict that can disrupt entire group functioning. When disobedient group members are severely reprimanded, the rest of the group may become more disruptive and uninterested in their work, leading to negative and inappropriate activities spreading from one troubled member to the rest of the group. This effect is called &quot;Disruptive contagion or ripple effect&quot; and it is strongly manifested when reprimanded member has a high status within a group, and authority&#x27;s requests are vague and ambiguous.

=== Resistance to coercive influence ===
Coercive influence can be tolerated when the group is successful, the leader is trusted, and the use of coercive tactics is justified by group norms. Furthermore, coercive methods are more effective when applied frequently and consistently to punish prohibited actions.

However, in some cases, group members chose to resist the authority&#x27;s influence. When low-power group members have a feeling of shared identity, they are more likely to form a &quot;Revolutionary Coalition&quot;, a subgroup formed within a larger group that seeks to disrupt and oppose the group&#x27;s authority structure. Group members are more likely to form a revolutionary coalition and resist an authority when authority lacks referent power, uses coercive methods, and asks group members to carry out unpleasant assignments. It is because these conditions create reactance, individuals strive to reassert their sense of freedom by affirming their agency for their own choices and consequences.

=== Kelman&#x27;s compliance-identification-internalization theory of conversion ===
Herbert Kelman identified three basic, step-like reactions that people display in response to coercive influence: compliance, identification, and internalization. This theory explains how groups convert hesitant recruits into zealous followers over time.

At the stage of &quot;compliance,&quot; group members comply with authority&#x27;s demands, but personally do not agree with them. If authority does not monitor the members, they will probably not obey.

&quot;Identification&quot; occurs when the target of the influence admires and therefore imitates the authority, mimics authority&#x27;s actions, values, characteristics, and takes on behaviours of the person with power. If prolonged and continuous, identification can lead to the final stage – internalization.

When &quot;internalization&quot; occurs, individual adopts the induced behaviour because it is congruent with his/her value system. At this stage, group members no longer carry out authority orders but perform actions that are congruent with their personal beliefs and opinions. Extreme obedience often requires internalization.

==Power literacy==
Power literacy refers to how one perceives power, how it is formed and accumulates, and the structures that support it and who is in control of it. Education can be helpful for heightening power literacy. In a 2014 TED talk Eric Liu notes that &quot;we don&#x27;t like to talk about power&quot; as &quot;we find it scary&quot; and &quot;somehow evil&quot; with it having a &quot;negative moral valence&quot; and states that the pervasiveness of power illiteracy causes a concentration of knowledge, understanding and clout. Joe L. Kincheloe describes a &quot;cyber-literacy of power&quot; that is concerned with the forces that shape knowledge production and the construction and transmission of meaning, being more about engaging knowledge than &quot;mastering&quot; information, and a &quot;cyber-power literacy&quot; that is focused on transformative knowledge production and new modes of accountability.

* Osnos, Evan, &quot;Ruling-Class Rules: How to thrive in the power elite – while declaring it your enemy&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, 29 January 2024, pp. 18–23. &quot;In the nineteen-twenties... American elites, some of whom feared a Bolshevik revolution, consented to reform... Under Franklin D. Roosevelt... the U.S. raised taxes, took steps to protect unions, and established a minimum wage. The costs, [Peter] Turchin writes, &#x27;were borne by the American ruling class.&#x27;... Between the nineteen-thirties and the nineteen-seventies, a period that scholars call the Great Compression, economic equality narrowed, except among Black Americans... But by the nineteen-eighties the Great Compression was over. As the rich grew richer than ever, they sought to turn their money into political power; spending on politics soared.&quot; (p. 22.) &quot;[N]o democracy can function well if people are unwilling to lose power – if a generation of leaders... becomes so entrenched that it ages into gerontocracy; if one of two major parties denies the arithmetic of elections; if a cohort of the ruling class loses status that it once enjoyed and sets out to salvage it.&quot; (p. 23.)

<doc id="147887" wikidata="Q2916407" url="?curid=147887" title="Tel Dothan">
<text>Dothan (Hebrew: ) (also Dotan) was a location mentioned twice in the Hebrew Bible. It has been identified with Tel Dothan (), also known as Tel al-Hafireh, located adjacent to the Palestinian town of Bir al-Basha, and ten kilometers (driving distance) southwest of Jenin in the West Bank, near Dotan Junction of Route 60.

==Identification==
The modern consensus is that the archaeological site of Tel Dothan corresponds to ancient Dothan.

Eusebius places Dothan 12 miles to the north of Sebaste; broadly consistent with the modern location.

===Other proposed locations===
Van de Velde noted that the Crusaders and later mediaeval travellers had located Dothan at the village of Hittin.

==Hebrew Bible==
Dothan is first mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (Book of Genesis) in connection with the history of Joseph, as the place in which the sons of Jacob (Israel) had moved their sheep and, at the suggestion of Judah, the brothers sold Joseph to the Ishmaelite merchants (). It later appears as the residence of Elisha (Second Book of Kings, ) and the scene of a vision of chariots and horses of fire surrounding the mountain on which the city stood.
The plain near Dothan is also mentioned in the apocryphal Book of Judith.

==History and archaeology==
===Northern kingdom of Israel (Samaria)===
The city served as an Israelite administrative centre, and archaeologist have discovered a large complex and Hebrew inscriptions at the site.

A bronze bull has been found in an Israelite sanctuary east of Tell Dothan, in the mountains of Samaria, dated to around the 11th century, which may be related to the episode of the golden calf.

===Crusader period===
Castellum Beleismum (Latin) or Chastiau St Job (medieval French) was the Frankish name of a tower built by the Crusaders on the ancient tell in 1156 and given to the Hospitallers in 1187.

===Modern discovery===
Charles William Meredith van de Velde visited the site in 1851, and was considered the first modern traveller to visit it. He described the discovery in his 1854 book:
...I saw a huge tell at the distance of only a few hundred yards from our way, covered over with ruins, and the fragment of an ancient aqueduct, that had been supported on arches. I asked Abu Monsur the name of the tell, and the answer was, &quot;Haida Dothan&quot; (that is, Dothan). &quot;Dothan,&quot; I asked, &quot;Dothan?&quot; &quot;Nahm; Dothan, Dothan, Dothan!&quot; exclaimed the testy old shech, as if hurt at my not believing him at the instant. My object in reiterating the question was to get him to repeat the name; for the discovery of Dothan was a very special circumstance, with respect to which I was anxious to assure myself, by having the name properly pronounced.

Van de Velde&#x27;s visit had taken place a few days before Edward Robinson&#x27;s; Robinson credited van ve Velde with the discovery.

==Modern use of the name==
The Israeli settlement of Mevo Dotan (lit. &quot;Approach to Dothan&quot;) is named for the city, as is Dothan, Alabama in the US.

<text>District Harburg is a district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) in Lower Saxony, Germany. It takes its name from the town of Harburg upon Elbe, which used to be the capital of the district but is now part of Hamburg and therefore no longer within the district. It is bounded by (from the east and clockwise) the districts of Lüneburg, Heidekreis, Rotenburg (Wümme) and Stade, by the City of Hamburg and the State of Schleswig-Holstein (District of Lauenburg).

==History==
In 1885 the Prussian government established three districts in this region: the District of Harburg, the District of Winsen and the district-free City of Harburg upon Elbe. In 1932 the districts of Winsen and Harburg were merged; the City of Harburg-Wilhelmsburg (which had been merged in 1927) became the capital of the district, although it remained district-free and hence was not a part of the district.

In 1937 the City of Harburg-Wilhelmsburg was incorporated into the City of Hamburg with the Greater Hamburg Act. Harburg and Wilhelmsburg became two boroughs of Hamburg. The District of Harburg remained with the State of Prussia and retained its autonomy. Winsen upon Luhe became the new capital of the District in 1944.

==Geography==
The District is located south of Hamburg and includes several suburbs of the Hamburg metropolitan area. In the south of the district part of the Lüneburg Heath (&quot;Lüneburger Heide&quot;) is found.

==Coat of arms==
The lion was the heraldic animal of the Welfen family and the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg, to which the region belonged before it became part of Prussia. The key is from the arms of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, to which western parts of the district belonged earlier.

<doc id="147895" wikidata="Q158246" url="?curid=147895" title="Conradin">
<text>Conrad III (25 March 1252 – 29 October 1268), called &quot;the Younger&quot; or &quot;the Boy&quot;, but usually known by the diminutive Conradin (, ), was the last direct heir of the House of Hohenstaufen. He was Duke of Swabia (1254–1268) and nominal King of Jerusalem (1254–1268) and Sicily (1254–1258). After his attempt to reclaim the Kingdom of Sicily for the Hohenstaufen dynasty failed, he was captured and beheaded.

==Early childhood==
Conradin was born in Wolfstein, Bavaria, to Conrad IV of Germany and Elisabeth of Bavaria. Though he never succeeded his father as Roman-German king, he was recognized as king of Sicily and Jerusalem by supporters of the Hohenstaufens in 1254.

Having lost his father in 1254, he grew up at the court of his uncle and guardian, Louis II, Duke of Bavaria. His guardians were able to hold Swabia for him. Jerusalem was held by a relative from the royal house of Cyprus as regent. In Sicily, his father&#x27;s half-brother Manfred continued as regent, but began to develop plans to usurp the kingship.

Little is known of his appearance and character except that he was as &quot;beautiful as Absalom, and spoke good Latin&quot;. Although his father had entrusted him to the guardianship of the church, Pope Alexander IV forbade Conradin&#x27;s election as Roman-German king and offered the Hohenstaufen lands in Germany to King Alfonso X of Castile and Richard of Cornwall

==Political and military career==
Having assumed the title of King of Jerusalem and Sicily, Conradin took possession of the Duchy of Swabia in 1262, and remained for some time in his duchy. Conradin&#x27;s first invitation to Italy came from the Guelphs of Florence: they asked him to take arms against Manfred, who had been crowned king of Sicily in 1258 on a false rumor of Conradin&#x27;s death. Louis refused this invitation on his nephew&#x27;s behalf. In 1266 count Charles I of Anjou, called by the new pope Clement IV, defeated and killed Manfred at Benevento, taking possession of southern Italy: envoys from the Ghibelline cities went then to Bavaria and urged Conradin to come and free Italy. Count Guido de Montefeltro representing Henry of Castile, Senator of Rome, offered him the support of the eternal city. Pledging his lands, Conradin crossed the Alps and issued a manifesto at Verona setting forth his claim on Sicily.

Notwithstanding the defection of his uncle Louis and of other companions who returned to Germany, the threats of Clement IV, and a lack of funds, his cause seemed to prosper. Proclaiming him King of Sicily, his partisans, among them Prince Henry of Castile, both in the north and south of Italy took up arms. Rome received his envoy with enthusiasm; and the young king himself received welcomes at Pavia, Pisa and Siena. In September 1267 a Spanish fleet under Frederick of Castile, and a number of knights from Pisa, and Spanish knights soldiering from Tunis, disembarked in the Sicilian city of Sciacca, and most of the island rebelled against the Angevin rule. Only Palermo and Messina remained loyal to Charles. The revolt spread to Calabria and Apulia. In November of the same year the Pope excommunicated him. His fleet won a victory over that of Charles I of Anjou, and in July 1268, Conradin himself entered Rome to a great and popular reception.

Having strengthened his forces, he marched towards Lucera to join the Siculo Muslims troops settled there since the time of his grandfather. On 23 August 1268 his multinational army of Italian, Spanish, Roman, Siculos and German troops encountered that of Charles at Tagliacozzo, in a hilly area of central Italy. The eagerness of Conradin&#x27;s forces, notably that of the Spanish knights led by Infante Henry of Castile who mounted a triumphant charge and captured the Angevin banner, initially appeared to have secured victory. But their inability to see through Charles&#x27; ruse allowed the latter to ultimately emerge victorious once the elite of his army, the veteran French knights he had hidden behind a hill, entered the battle to the surprise of the enemy. Escaping from the field of battle, Conradin reached Rome, but acting on advice to leave the city he proceeded to Astura in an attempt to sail for Sicily. However, upon reaching his destination he was arrested and handed over to Charles, who imprisoned him in the Castel dell&#x27;Ovo in Naples, together with the inseparable Frederick of Baden. On 29 October 1268 Conradin and Frederick were beheaded.

==Legacy==

With Conradin&#x27;s death at 16, the direct (male) line of the Hohenstaufen dynasty became extinct. His remains, with those of Frederick of Baden, lie in the church of the monastery of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel at Naples, founded by his mother for the good of his soul; and here in 1847 Maximilian, crown prince of Bavaria, erected a marble statue by Bertel Thorvaldsen to his memory. In the 14th-century &quot;Codex Manesse&quot;, a collection of medieval German lyrics, preserved at Heidelberg, there appear two songs written by Conradin, and his fate has formed the subject of several dramas.

His hereditary Kingdom of Jerusalem passed to the heirs of his great-great-grandmother Isabella I of Jerusalem, among whom a succession dispute arose. The senior heir in primogeniture was Hugh of Brienne, a second cousin of Conradin&#x27;s father, but another second cousin Hugh III of Cyprus already held the office of regent and managed to keep the kingdom as Hugh I of Jerusalem. Conradin&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s first cousin Mary of Antioch also staked her claim on basis of proximity of blood, which she later sold to Conradin&#x27;s executioner Charles of Anjou.

According to a strict sense of legitimacy, the general heiress of his Kingdom of Sicily and the Duchy of Swabia was his aunt Margaret, half-sister of his father Conrad IV (the youngest but only surviving child of Frederick II and his third wife, Isabella of England) and married with Albert, Landgrave of Thuringia since 1255. Their son Frederick claimed Sicily and Swabia on her right.

However, these claims met with little favor. Swabia, pawned by Conradin before his last expedition, was disintegrating as a territorial unit. He went unrecognized in Outremer, and Charles of Anjou was deeply entrenched in power in Southern Italy. Margrave Frederick proposed an invasion of Italy in 1269, and attracted some support from the Lombard Ghibellines, but his plans were never carried out, and he played no further part in Italian affairs.

Finally, Sicily passed to Charles of Anjou, but the Sicilian Vespers in 1282 resulted in dual claims on the Kingdom; the Aragonese heirs of Manfred retaining the island of Sicily and the Angevin party retaining the southern part of Italy, popularly called the Kingdom of Naples.

==In literature==

Conradin was the subject of artistic interpretation in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Several paintings and works of literature, especially poetry, depicted his military campaign and his execution. Felicia Hemans, best known for &quot;The boy stood on the burning deck&quot;, wrote in 1824 &quot;The Death of Conradin&quot;. Charles Swain wrote &quot;Conradin&quot; in 1832, a poem which inspired the first of &quot;Three Tone Poems for Solo Piano&quot; by Justin Henry Rubin. &quot;Conradin : a philosophical ballad&quot; was written by C. R. Ashbee, dedicated to his patron and friend Colonel Shaw Hellier, and published in 1908 by Essex House Press, &quot;one of the most significant private presses at work during the Arts and Crafts movement&quot;

The novel &quot;Põlev lipp&quot; (&quot;The Burning Banner&quot;) by Karl Ristikivi (1961; in Estonian) depicts Conradin&#x27;s Italian campaign. A translation into the French by Jean Pascal Ollivry , entitled &quot;L&#x27;étendard en flammes&quot;, was published in Paris in 2005.

<text>Fred Arthur Leuchter Jr. (born February 7, 1943) is an American manufacturer of execution equipment and Holocaust denier, best known as the author of the Leuchter report, a pseudoscientific document alleging there were no gas chambers at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Prior to the document&#x27;s publication, he was contracted by authorities of several U.S. states to improve the designs of instruments for capital punishment. He was charged in Massachusetts with misrepresenting himself to penitentiaries as an engineer, despite having no relevant qualifications. He plea bargained with state prosecutors and received two years&#x27; probation. He has also been accused of running a &quot;death row shakedown&quot;, where he threatened to testify for the defense in capital cases if he was not given contracts for his services by that state.

Leuchter became internationally known for his testimony in defense of Holocaust denier Ernst Zündel in 1988. His study for Zündel&#x27;s trial has been referred to as the Leuchter report since it was published by Zündel with that title.

Leuchter&#x27;s work is often presented by Holocaust deniers as scientifically based evidence for Holocaust denial, even though his research methods and findings having been widely discredited on both scientific and historical grounds. Leuchter and his report are the subject of &quot;Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr.&quot;, a 1999 feature-length documentary film by Errol Morris.

==Education and pre-report career==
Leuchter was born on February 7, 1943, to Fred Arthur Leuchter Sr. in Malden, Massachusetts.

He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Boston University in 1964. He holds patents for a geodetic instrument and an electronic sextant.

===Fred Leuchter Associates===
Leuchter started Fred Leuchter Associates in 1979, with which he sold services to several states to help them maintain, improve, document, and ascertain the effectiveness of their equipment for administration of capital punishment.  His initial work was with electric chairs, starting in Tennessee. His broader claims are that his work in this area is humanitarian, providing greater respect for both guards and those to be executed. He also claims that he offered his services at considerable economy: off-the-shelf parts, labor, and a 20% profit. By his own account, consultation among various state government agencies spread his reputation from Tennessee to other states, and further assignments followed. Leuchter &quot;aggressively solicited business&quot;, and in 1985 the state of New Jersey purchased his proposal for a lethal injection system for $30,000.

==Zündel trial and investigation at Auschwitz==
In 1988 Leuchter was hired by Ernst Zündel, who was being tried in Canada for publishing works of Holocaust denial, to investigate and testify as an expert witness at his trial, for a fee of $30,000. Leuchter was recommended to Zündel by Bill Armontrout, warden for Missouri State Penitentiary in Jefferson City, Missouri. In his capacity as warden, Armontrout was personally responsible for carrying out executions by the use of cyanide gas. Leuchter traveled to Auschwitz and Birkenau to examine the structures identified by former guards, former prisoners, and investigators as gas chambers, and concluded that they could not have been used for mass murder.

Zündel&#x27;s &quot;Samisdat&quot; &quot;Publications&quot; published his findings as &quot;The Leuchter Report: An Engineering Report on the Alleged Execution Chambers at Auschwitz, Birkenau, and Majdanek Poland&quot; (published in England as &quot;Auschwitz: The End of the Line: The Leuchter Report – The First Forensic Examination of Auschwitz&quot;), which the court accepted only as evidentiary display and not as direct evidence. Leuchter was therefore required to explain it and to testify to the validity of his conclusions under oath during the trial. His report was republished and translated by various denial organizations, and he has since lectured on it and his subsequent experiences. Protests were organized in response to his lectures.

In 1988, prior to writing the report, Leuchter had traveled to several sites of structures identified as gas chambers, where, without permission, he collected samples from walls, ceilings and floors, using a chisel and hammer to chip and scrape off pieces of the masonry. He took copious notes about the floor plans and layout, and all of his actions were videotaped by a cameraman. (Leuchter, who had married only about one month before the trip, told his wife that the trip to Auschwitz-Birkenau was their honeymoon.) Leuchter then brought the samples back to Boston, where he presented them to Alpha Analytical Laboratories, a chemical laboratory, for testing. Leuchter told Alpha only that he would use the samples as evidence in a court case about an industrial accident. The lab tested them for exposure to cyanide and found trace amounts in the crematoria, which Leuchter dismissed in his report:

Leuchter compared the low amounts in the Krema to the higher readings in his positive control sample.

Lab manager James Roth testified under oath to the results at the trial. It was only after he left the stand that Roth learned what the trial was about. In an interview for Morris&#x27;s film, Roth states that cyanide would have formed an extremely fine layer on the walls, to the depth of one-tenth of a human hair. Leuchter had taken samples of indeterminate thickness (he is seen in Morris&#x27;s film hammering at the bricks with a rock hammer). Not informed of this, Roth had pulverized the entire samples, thus severely diluting the cyanide-containing layer of each sample with an indeterminate amount of brick, varying for each sample. Roth offers the analogy that the tests were like &quot;analyzing paint on a wall by analyzing the timber that&#x27;s behind it.&quot;

Leuchter did not examine the walls of the gas chambers until 50 years after they had been used; his critics note that it would have been virtually impossible to discover any cyanide at all using his method. In fact, tests conducted on ventilation grates immediately after the end of the war showed substantial amounts of cyanide. The chambers were demolished by the Nazis when they abandoned Auschwitz, and the facilities Leuchter examined were, in fact, partially reconstructed. Leuchter was unaware that parts of the camp and chambers had been reconstructed, so he had no way of knowing if the bricks he was scraping had actually been used in the original gas chamber.

Leuchter claimed that the relatively low concentration of cyanide residue measured in his samples of the remains of the gas chambers in Auschwitz, compared to his samples of the &quot;delousing chambers&quot; in which clothes were deloused using the same gas, hydrogen cyanide, excluded the possibility of them being used to kill humans. His report assumed that lower concentrations are required for delousing than to kill humans and other warm-blooded creatures; in fact, with their simpler structures and slower metabolisms, insects are more resistant to such gross metabolic poisons than mammals. Both toxicological study and practical experience demonstrate that it takes a much higher concentration of cyanide (16,000 parts per million) to kill insects than to kill humans (300 ppm), as well as an exposure time of many hours rather than only minutes. Leuchter also failed to explain his belief that Zyklon B was used only for delousing, in view of his belief that the product would present technical difficulties in ventilating and decontaminating such as to make it impractical for use in a gas chamber. Nor did he explain why such large chambers would be needed for delousing clothes.

Leuchter also wrongly assumed that it would take 20 to 30 hours to air a room disinfected with Zyklon B. Since far lower concentrations are required when gassing people than for delousing, it would take only 20 to 30 minutes to ventilate the room; therefore, the forced-ventilation systems used would be more than adequate to allow the gas chambers to be operated without endangering the executioners.

Leuchter&#x27;s report also made claims about the capacity of the crematoria, although he admitted he had no experience with cremation technology. When questioned in court, Leuchter admitted he had never seen a document by the Waffen-SS Commandant for construction issued when the crematoria were constructed, which estimated they had a 24-hour capacity of 4,756 people, more than 30 times Leuchter&#x27;s estimate of 156.

===Repeating of Leuchter report&#x27;s tests===
In February 1990, Professor Jan Markiewicz, Director of the Forensic Institute of Kraków, redid the analysis. Markiewicz decided that the Prussian blue test was unreliable because it depended on the acidity of the environment, which was low in the gas chambers. Markiewicz and his team used microdiffusion techniques to test for cyanide in samples from the gas chambers, from delousing chambers, and from living areas elsewhere within Auschwitz. The negative control samples from the living quarters tested negative, while cyanide residue was found in both the delousing chambers and the gas chambers. The amount of cyanide found had a great variability, possibly due to 50 years of exposure to the elements to varying degrees, but even so, the categorical results were that cyanide was found where expected in both the gas chambers and the delousing facilities, and not found in the living quarters, supporting the hypothesis that the gas chambers were exposed to high levels of cyanide like the delousing facilities, and not low levels for routine fumigation, like the living quarters.

==Life and career after Leuchter report==
Protests were organized outside the courthouse in Canada and near Leuchter&#x27;s home in Malden, Massachusetts. Despite the bad publicity, he remained active as a capital punishment consultant until 1990, when his lack of qualifications to practice was exposed. In the late 1980s, following the Ernst Zündel trial, he was featured in both &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; and &quot;Primetime Live&quot; in items on capital punishment, neither of which mentioned his association with Zündel. Also following his involvement in the Zündel trial, Leuchter began lecturing to Holocaust denial groups, such as the Institute for Historical Review (IHR), about his research and continued belief in the conclusions he testified to in the trial. In a speech to the Eleventh IHR Conference in October 1992, he said:

In this case, it is myself that I post mortem—and the cadaver isn&#x27;t dead! Much to the dismay of my executioners, the execution was so badly botched that I am able to stand here before you to speak the truth, and to tell the world that it is not myself, but the Holocaust story that is dead. I repeat for the record: I was condemned for maintaining that there were no execution gas chambers as Auschwitz, Birkenau, Majdanek, Dachau, Mauthausen, or Hartheim Castle. There&#x27;s no proof for the charge, only innuendo, lies, and half-truths. Robert Faurisson, Ernst Zundel and others said this first. They, too, live as victims of botched executions, but nevertheless free to speak the truth in a strong and growing voice that repeats: No gas chambers, no gas chambers, no damn gas chambers!Because I was somewhat naïve at the time, I was not aware that by so testifying I was offending the organized world Jewish community. By providing final, definitive proof that there were no execution gas chambers utilized for genocidal purposes by the Germans at these wartime camps, I established the simple fact that the Holocaust story is not true. What I did not know was that anyone expressing such beliefs is guilty of a capital crime: that of thinking and telling the unspeakable truth about the greatest lie of the age.I would have to pay for this crime. While I innocently told the truth in Toronto, plans were made, and subsequently implemented, for a major effort to destroy me. If I could be destroyed and discredited—so the reasoning went—no one would accept my professional findings, no matter how truthful.

When he tried to sell parts of a lethal injection machine and other items from Fred Leuchter Associates, many of which were part of projects done for states who had refused to pay him for previously contracted or agreed-on work, he was again charged. When he claimed that the Massachusetts Attorney General determined that the sale of the offered equipment was not, in fact, illegal, states started denying his contracts on the basis of his lack of qualifications. His wife divorced him in this same period.

Leuchter was arrested in and shortly thereafter deported from the United Kingdom in November 1991. He had been banned from entering the country by the Home Office, thus his entry and presence there were illegal. Leuchter claimed that United States consulate personnel effectively refused him aid. He had been interrupted while giving an invited speech at David Irving&#x27;s instigation; his talk followed immediately one by Robert Faurisson. Leuchter has blamed criticism of his work on an &quot;international cabal ... those who have unjustly attacked me and violated my rights ... the Klarsfelds, Shapiros, and Kahns of the world&quot;.

According to the Institute for Historical Review, Leuchter subsequently took employment as a telemarketer.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, before selling execution equipment, Leuchter was a dealer in military surveillance equipment.

On October 24, 1990, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described him as &quot;self-proclaimed execution expert and manufacturer of death machinery.&quot; It quoted Edward A. Brunner, chairman of the anesthesia department at Northwestern University Medical School, as saying Leuchter&#x27;s lethal injection system would indeed paralyze a condemned criminal with Pavulon, but that far from being humane, the paralysis would merely stop the prisoner from screaming at the &quot;extreme pain in the form of a severe burning sensation&quot; caused by the potassium chloride injection. Potassium chloride is commonly used in judicial execution through lethal injection.

===Allegations of dishonest court appearances===
In 1990 &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported Alabama assistant attorney general Ed Carnes having called Leuchter&#x27;s views on the gas chamber &quot;unorthodox&quot;, and alleging that &quot;Leuchter was running a death row shakedown scheme: if a state didn&#x27;t purchase Leuchter&#x27;s services, he would testify at the last minute for the condemned man that the state&#x27;s death chamber might malfunction.&quot; The Associated Press quoted Carnes as claiming that Leuchter made &quot;money on both sides of the fence&quot;. In his memorandum to death penalty states, Carnes observed that in Florida and Virginia the federal courts had rejected Leuchter&#x27;s testimony as unreliable. The court in Florida had found that Leuchter had &quot;misquoted the statements&quot; contained in an important affidavit and had &quot;inaccurately surmised&quot; a crucial premise of his conclusion.

In Virginia, Leuchter provided a death row inmate&#x27;s attorney with an affidavit claiming the electric chair would fail. The Virginia court decided the credibility of Leuchter&#x27;s affidavit was limited because Leuchter was &quot;the refused contractor who bid to replace the electrodes in the Virginia chair&quot;.

===Charges of practicing without a license===
In 1991 Leuchter faced charges of practicing engineering without a license issued by the Board of Registration of Professional Engineers and of Land Surveyors, which regulates professional engineers, a violation of Massachusetts law. As a result of those charges, Leuchter signed a consent decree with the board, in which he stated that he was not and had never been registered as a professional engineer, despite having represented himself as one. He settled with prosecutors by serving two years of probation and agreeing to stop disseminating documents in which he presented himself as an engineer, including the Leuchter report. In a speech given over a year later, Leuchter claimed that:

a spurious criminal complaint was filed against me in the Massachusetts court system with the intent of destroying my reputation by putting me in prison for three months.In point of fact, a license is not required in Massachusetts, or any other state, unless the engineer is involved in construction of buildings, and is certifying compliance with specifications. There is also a statutory exemption for engineers who do not deal with the general public.As confirmation of the spurious nature of this charge, it should be pointed out there are more than fifty thousand practicing engineers in Massachusetts, of whom only five thousand are licensed. Although the state&#x27;s licensing law has been in effect since 1940, there has been no record of any prosecution for this offense.

Leuchter attributed the actions of the regulatory board against him to pressure from Jewish groups.

<doc id="147909" wikidata="Q4895685" url="?curid=147909" title="Linearity of differentiation">
<text>In calculus, the derivative of any linear combination of functions equals the same linear combination of the derivatives of the functions; this property is known as linearity of differentiation, the rule of linearity, or the superposition rule for differentiation. It is a fundamental property of the derivative that encapsulates in a single rule two simpler rules of differentiation, the sum rule (the derivative of the sum of two functions is the sum of the derivatives) and the constant factor rule (the derivative of a constant multiple of a function is the same constant multiple of the derivative). Thus it can be said that differentiation is linear, or the differential operator is a linear operator.

==Statement and derivation==
Let and be functions, with and constants. Now consider

:formula_1

By the sum rule in differentiation, this is

:formula_2

and by the constant factor rule in differentiation, this reduces to

:formula_3

Therefore,

:formula_4

Omitting the brackets, this is often written as:

:formula_5

==Detailed proofs/derivations from definition==
We can prove the entire linearity principle at once, or, we can prove the individual steps (of constant factor and adding) individually. Here, both will be shown.

Proving linearity directly also proves the constant factor rule, the sum rule, and the difference rule as special cases. The sum rule is obtained by setting both constant coefficients to formula_6. The difference rule is obtained by setting the first constant coefficient to formula_6 and the second constant coefficient to formula_8. The constant factor rule is obtained by setting either the second constant coefficient or the second function to formula_9. (From a technical standpoint, the domain of the second function must also be considered - one way to avoid issues is setting the second function equal to the first function and the second constant coefficient equal to formula_9. One could also define both the second constant coefficient and the second function to be 0, where the domain of the second function is a superset of the first function, among other possibilities.)

On the contrary, if we first prove the constant factor rule and the sum rule, we can prove linearity and the difference rule. Proving linearity is done by defining the first and second functions as being two other functions being multiplied by constant coefficients. Then, as shown in the derivation from the previous section, we can first use the sum law while differentiation, and then use the constant factor rule, which will reach our conclusion for linearity. In order to prove the difference rule, the second function can be redefined as another function multiplied by the constant coefficient of formula_8. This would, when simplified, give us the difference rule for differentiation.

In the proofs/derivations below, the coefficients formula_12 are used; they correspond to the coefficients formula_13 above.

===Linearity (directly)===
Let formula_14. Let formula_15 be functions. Let formula_16 be a function, where formula_16 is defined only where formula_18 and formula_19 are both defined. (In other words, the domain of formula_16 is the intersection of the domains of formula_18 and formula_19.) Let formula_23 be in the domain of formula_16. Let formula_25.

We want to prove that formula_26.

By definition, we can see that

formula_27
In order to use the limits law for the sum of limits, we need to know that formula_28 and formula_29 both individually exist. For these smaller limits, we need to know that formula_30 and formula_31 both individually exist to use the coefficient law for limits. By definition, formula_32 and formula_33. So, if we know that formula_34 and formula_35 both exist, we will know that formula_30 and formula_31 both individually exist. This allows us to use the coefficient law for limits to write

formula_38

and

formula_39

With this, we can go back to apply the limit law for the sum of limits, since we know that formula_40 and formula_41 both individually exist. From here, we can directly go back to the derivative we were working on.formula_42Finally, we have shown what we claimed in the beginning: formula_26.

===Sum===
Let formula_15 be functions. Let formula_16 be a function, where formula_16 is defined only where formula_18 and formula_19 are both defined.
(In other words, the domain of formula_16 is the intersection of the domains of formula_18 and formula_19.) Let formula_23 be in the domain of formula_16. Let formula_54.

We want to prove that formula_55.

By definition, we can see that

formula_56In order to use the law for the sum of limits here, we need to show that the individual limits, formula_57 and formula_58 both exist. By definition, formula_59and formula_60, so the limits exist whenever the derivatives formula_34 and formula_35 exist. So, assuming that the derivatives exist, we can continue the above derivation

formula_63
Thus, we have shown what we wanted to show, that: formula_55.

===Difference===
Let formula_15 be functions. Let formula_16 be a function, where formula_16 is defined only where formula_18 and formula_19 are both defined. (In other words, the domain of formula_16 is the intersection of the domains of formula_18 and formula_19.) Let formula_23 be in the domain of formula_16. Let formula_75.

We want to prove that formula_76.

By definition, we can see that:
formula_77

In order to use the law for the difference of limits here, we need to show that the individual limits, formula_57 and formula_58 both exist. By definition, formula_59 and that formula_60, so these limits exist whenever the derivatives formula_34 and formula_35 exist. So, assuming that the derivatives exist, we can continue the above derivation

formula_84

Thus, we have shown what we wanted to show, that: formula_76.

===Constant coefficient===
Let formula_18 be a function. Let formula_87; formula_88 will be the constant coefficient. Let formula_16 be a function, where j is defined only where formula_18 is defined. (In other words, the domain of formula_16 is equal to the domain of formula_18.) Let formula_23 be in the domain of formula_16. Let formula_95.

We want to prove that formula_96.

By definition, we can see that:

formula_97

Now, in order to use a limit law for constant coefficients to show that

formula_98 we need to show that formula_57 exists.
However, formula_59, by the definition of the derivative. So, if formula_34 exists, then formula_57 exists.

Thus, if we assume that formula_34 exists, we can use the limit law and continue our proof.

formula_104

Thus, we have proven that when formula_95, we have formula_106.

<doc id="147911" wikidata="Q79965" url="?curid=147911" title="Golden Horde">
<text>The Golden Horde, self-designated as Ulug Ulus ( in Kipchak Turkic), was originally a Mongol and later Turkicized khanate established in the 13th century and originating as the northwestern sector of the Mongol Empire. With the division of the Mongol Empire after 1259, it became a functionally separate khanate. It is also known as the Kipchak Khanate or the Ulus of Jochi, and replaced the earlier, less organized Cuman–Kipchak confederation.

After the death of Batu Khan (the founder of the Blue Horde) in 1255, his dynasty flourished for a full century, until 1359, though the intrigues of Nogai instigated a partial civil war in the late 1290s. The Horde&#x27;s military power peaked during the reign of Özbeg Khan (1312–1341), who adopted Islam. The territory of the Golden Horde at its peak extended from Siberia and Central Asia to parts of Eastern Europe from the Urals to the Danube in the west, and from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea in the south, while bordering the Caucasus Mountains and the territories of the Mongol dynasty known as the Ilkhanate.

The khanate experienced violent internal political disorder known as the Great Troubles (1359–1381), before it briefly reunited under Tokhtamysh (1381–1395). However, soon after the 1396 invasion of Timur, the founder of the Timurid Empire, the Golden Horde broke into smaller Tatar khanates which declined steadily in power. At the start of the 15th century, the Horde began to fall apart. By 1466, it was being referred to simply as the &quot;Great Horde&quot;. Within its territories there emerged numerous predominantly Turkic khanates. These internal struggles allowed Moscow to formally rid itself of the &quot;Tatar yoke&quot; at the Great Stand on the Ugra River in 1480, which traditionally marks the end of Mongol rule over Russia. The Crimean Khanate and the Kazakh Khanate, the last remnants of the Golden Horde, survived until 1783 and 1847 respectively, when they were conquered by the expanding Russian state.

== Name ==
The name Golden Horde is a partial calque of Russian (), itself supposedly a partial calque of Turkic . () was translated to &#x27;Golden&#x27;, while () was transliterated to &#x27;Horde&#x27;.

The Turkic word means &#x27;palace&#x27;, &#x27;camp&#x27; or &#x27;headquarters&#x27;, in this case the headquarters of the khan, being the capital of the khanate, metonymically extended to the khanate itself. The English word &quot;horde&quot;, in the sense of a large (and often threatening) group, emerged later, metaphorically extended from the reputation of the Mongol hordes.

The appellation &quot;Golden&quot; is said to have been inspired by the golden color of the tents the Mongols lived in during wartime, or an actual golden tent used by Batu Khan or by Özbeg Khan, or to have been bestowed by the Slavic tributaries to describe the great wealth of the khan.

It was not until the 16th century that Russian chroniclers begin explicitly using the term to refer to this particular successor khanate of the Mongol Empire. The first known use of the term, in 1565, in a Russian chronicle called &quot;History of Kazan&quot;, applied it to the Ulus of Batu, centered on Sarai. In contemporary Persian, Armenian and Muslim writings, and in the records of the 13th and early 14th centuries such as the Yuanshi and the , the khanate was called the &quot; of Jochi&quot; (&#x27;realm of Jochi&#x27; in Mongolian), (, &#x27;Qipchaq Steppe&#x27;) or &quot;Khanate of the Qipchaq&quot; and or .

The eastern or left wing (or &quot;left hand&quot; in official Mongol-sponsored Persian sources) was referred to as the Blue Horde in Russian chronicles and as the White Horde in Timurid sources (e.g. Zafar-Nameh). Western scholars have tended to follow the Timurid sources&#x27; nomenclature and call the left wing the White Horde. But Ötemish Hajji (), a historian of Khwarazm, called the left wing the Blue Horde, and since he was familiar with the oral traditions of the khanate empire, it seems likely that the Russian chroniclers were correct, and that the khanate itself called its left wing the Blue Horde. The khanate apparently used the term White Horde to refer to its right wing, which was situated in Batu&#x27;s home base in Sarai and controlled the ulus. The designations Golden Horde, Blue Horde, and White Horde have not been encountered in the sources of the Mongol period.

== Mongol origins (1225–1241) ==

At his death in 1227, Genghis Khan divided the Mongol Empire amongst his four sons as appanages, but the Empire remained united under the supreme khan. Jochi was the eldest, but he died six months before Genghis. The westernmost lands occupied by the Mongols, which included what is today southern Russia and Kazakhstan, were given to Jochi&#x27;s eldest sons, Batu Khan, who eventually became ruler of the Blue Horde, and Orda Khan, who became the leader of the White Horde. In 1235, Batu with the great general Subutai began an invasion westwards, first conquering the Bashkirs and then moving on to Volga Bulgaria in 1236. From there he conquered some of the southern steppes of present-day Ukraine in 1237, forcing many of the local Cumans to retreat westward. The Mongol campaign against the Kypchaks and Cumans had already started under Jochi and Subutai in 1216–1218 when the Merkits took shelter among them. By 1239 a large portion of Cumans were driven out of the Crimean peninsula, and it became one of the appanages of the Mongol Empire. The remnants of the Crimean Cumans survived in the Crimean Mountains, and they would, in time, mix with other groups in the Crimea (including Greeks, Goths, and Mongols) to form the Crimean Tatar population. Moving north, Batu began the Mongol invasion of Rus&#x27; and spent three years subjugating the principalities, whilst his cousins Möngke, Kadan, and Güyük moved southwards into Alania.

Using the migration of the Cumans as their &quot;casus belli&quot;, the Mongols continued west, raiding Poland and Hungary, which culminated in Mongol victories at the battles of Legnica and Mohi. In 1241, however, Ögedei Khan died in the Mongol homeland. Batu turned back from his siege of Vienna but did not return to Mongolia, rather opting to stay at the Volga River. His brother Orda returned to take part in the succession. The Mongol armies would never again travel so far west. In 1242, after retreating through Hungary, destroying Pest in the process, and subjugating Bulgaria, Batu established his capital at Sarai, commanding the lower stretch of the Volga River, on the site of the Khazar capital of Atil. Shortly before that, the younger brother of Batu and Orda, Shiban, was given his own enormous &quot;ulus&quot; east of the Ural Mountains along the Ob and Irtysh Rivers.

While the Mongolian language was undoubtedly in general use at the court of Batu, few Mongol texts written in the territory of the Golden Horde have survived, perhaps because of the prevalent general illiteracy. According to Grigor&#x27;ev, , or decrees of the Khans, were written in Mongol, then translated into the Cuman language. The existence of Arabic-Mongol and Persian-Mongol dictionaries dating from the middle of the 14th century and prepared for the use of the Egyptian Mamluk Sultanate suggests that there was a practical need for such works in the chancelleries handling correspondence with the Golden Horde. It is thus reasonable to conclude that letters received by the Mamluks – if not also written by them – must have been in Mongol.

== Golden Age ==

=== Batu Khan (1242–1256) ===

When the Great Khatun Töregene invited Batu to elect the next Emperor of the Mongol Empire in 1242, he declined to attend the kurultai and instead stayed at the Volga River. Although Batu excused himself by saying he was suffering from old age and illness, it seems that he did not support the election of Güyük Khan. Güyük and Büri, a grandson of Chagatai Khan, had quarreled violently with Batu at a victory banquet during the Mongol occupation of Eastern Europe. He sent his brothers to the kurultai, and the new Khagan of the Mongols was elected in 1246.

All the senior princes of Rus&#x27;, including Yaroslav II of Vladimir, Daniel of Galicia, and Sviatoslav III of Vladimir, acknowledged Batu&#x27;s supremacy. Originally Batu ordered Daniel to turn the administration of Galicia over to the Mongols, but Daniel personally visited Batu in 1245 and pledged allegiance to him. After returning from his trip, Daniel was visibly influenced by the Mongols, and equipped his army in the Mongol fashion, his horsemen with Mongol-style cuirasses, and their mounts armoured with shoulder, chest, and head pieces. Michael of Chernigov, who had killed a Mongol envoy in 1240, refused to show obeisance and was executed in 1246.

When Güyük called Batu to pay him homage several times, Batu sent Yaroslav II, Andrey II of Vladimir and Alexander Nevsky to Karakorum in Mongolia in 1247. Yaroslav II never returned and died in Mongolia. He was probably poisoned by Töregene Khatun, who probably did it to spite Batu and even her own son Güyük, because he did not approve of her regency. Güyük appointed Andrey as the grand prince of Vladimir and Alexander was given the princely title of Kiev. However, when they returned, Andrey went to Vladimir while Alexander went to Novgorod instead. A bishop by the name of Cyril went to Kiev and found it so devastated that he abandoned the place and went further east instead.

In 1248, Güyük demanded Batu come east to meet him, a move that some contemporaries regarded as a pretext for Batu&#x27;s arrest. In compliance with the order, Batu approached, bringing a large army. When Güyük moved westwards, Tolui&#x27;s widow and a sister of Batu&#x27;s stepmother Sorghaghtani warned Batu that the Jochids might be his target. Güyük died on the way, in what is now Xinjiang, at about the age of 42. Although some modern historians believe that he died of natural causes because of deteriorating health, he may have succumbed to the combined effects of alcoholism and gout, or he may have been poisoned. William of Rubruck and a Muslim chronicler state that Batu killed the imperial envoy, and one of his brothers murdered the Great Khan Güyük, but these claims are not completely corroborated by other major sources. Güyük&#x27;s widow Oghul Qaimish took over as regent, but she was unable to keep the succession within her branch of the family.
With the assistance of Batu, Möngke succeeded as Great Khan in 1251. Utilizing the discovery of a plot designed to remove him, Möngke as the new Great Khan began a purge of his opponents. Estimates of the deaths of aristocrats, officials, and Mongol commanders range from 77 to 300. Batu became the most influential person in the Mongol Empire as his friendship with Möngke ensured the unity of the realm. Batu, Möngke, and other princely lines shared rule over the area from Afghanistan to Turkey. Batu allowed Möngke&#x27;s census-takers to operate freely in his realm. Local censuses took place in the 1240s, including the areas of Russia and Turkey. In 1251–1259, Möngke conducted the first empire-wide census of the Mongol Empire; while North China was completed in 1252, Novgorod in the far northwest was not counted until winter of 1258–1259. There was an uprising in Novgorod against the Mongol census, but Alexander Nevsky forced the city to submit to the census and taxation.

With the new powers afforded to Batu by Möngke, he now had direct control over the princes of Rus&#x27;. However, Andrey II refused to submit to Batu. Batu sent a punitive expedition under Nevruy, who defeated Andrey and forced him to flee to Novgorod, then Pskov, and finally to Sweden. The Mongols overran Vladimir and harshly punished the principality. The Livonian Knights stopped their advance to Novgorod and Pskov. Thanks to his friendship with Sartaq Khan, Batu&#x27;s son, who was a Christian, Alexander was installed as the grand prince of Vladimir by Batu in 1252.

=== Berke (1258–1266) ===

After Batu died in 1256, his son Sartaq Khan was appointed by Möngke Khan. As soon as he returned from the court of the Great Khan in Mongolia, Sartaq died. The infant Ulaghchi succeeded him under the regency of Boragchin Khatun. The khatun summoned all the princes of Rus&#x27; to Sarai to renew their patents. In 1256, Andrey traveled to Sarai to ask for pardon. He was once again reappointed as the grand prince of Vladimir.

Ulaghchi died soon after and Batu Khan&#x27;s younger brother Berke, who had been converted to Islam, was enthroned as khan of the Golden Horde in 1258.

In 1256, Daniel of Galicia openly defied the Mongols and ousted their troops in northern Podolia. In 1257, he repelled Mongol assaults led by the prince Kuremsa on Ponyzia and Volhynia and dispatched an expedition with the aim of taking Kiev. Despite initial successes, in 1259 a Mongol force under Boroldai entered Galicia and Volhynia and offered an ultimatum: Daniel was to destroy his fortifications or Boroldai would assault the towns. Daniel complied and pulled down the city walls. In 1259 Berke launched savage attacks on Lithuania and Poland, and demanded the submission of Béla IV, the Hungarian monarch, and the French King Louis IX in 1259 and 1260. His assault on Prussia in 1259–1260 inflicted heavy losses on the Teutonic Order. The Lithuanians were probably tributary in the 1260s, when reports reached the Curia that they were in league with the Mongols.

In 1261, Berke approved the establishment of a church in Sarai.

=== Toluid Civil War (1260–1264) ===

After Möngke Khan died in 1259, the Toluid Civil War broke out between Kublai Khan and Ariq Böke. While Hulagu Khan of the Ilkhanate supported Kublai, Berke sided with Ariq Böke. There is evidence that Berke minted coins in Ariq Böke&#x27;s name, but he remained militarily neutral. After the defeat of Ariq Böke in 1264, he freely acceded to Kublai&#x27;s enthronement. However, some elites of the White Horde joined Ariq Böke&#x27;s resistance.

=== Berke–Hulagu war (1262–1266) ===

Möngke ordered the Jochid and Chagatayid families to join Hulagu&#x27;s expedition to Iran. Berke&#x27;s persuasion might have forced his brother Batu to postpone Hulagu&#x27;s operation, little suspecting that it would result in eliminating the Jochid predominance there for several years. During the reign of Batu or his first two successors, the Golden Horde dispatched a large Jochid delegation to participate in Hulagu&#x27;s expedition in the Middle East in 1256–1257.

One of the Jochid princes who joined Hulagu&#x27;s army was accused of witchcraft and sorcery against Hulagu. After receiving permission from Berke, Hulagu executed him. After that two more Jochid princes died suspiciously. According to some Muslim sources, Hulagu refused to share his war booty with Berke in accordance with Genghis Khan&#x27;s wish. Berke was a devoted Muslim who had had a close relationship with the Abbasid Caliph Al-Musta&#x27;sim, who had been killed by Hulagu in 1258. The Jochids believed that Hulagu&#x27;s state eliminated their presence in the Transcaucasus. Those events increased the anger of Berke and the war between the Golden Horde and the Ilkhanate soon broke out in 1262.

The increasing tension between Berke and Hulagu was a warning to the Golden Horde contingents in Hulagu&#x27;s army to flee. One contingent reached the Kipchak Steppe, another traversed Khorasan, and a third body took refuge in Mamluk ruled Syria where they were well received by Sultan Baybars (1260–1277). Hulagu harshly punished the rest of the Golden Horde army in Iran. Berke sought a joint attack with Baybars and forged an alliance with the Mamluks against Hulagu. The Golden Horde dispatched the young prince Nogai to invade the Ilkhanate but Hulagu forced him back in 1262. The Ilkhanid army then crossed the Terek River, capturing an empty Jochid encampment, only to be routed in a surprise attack by Nogai&#x27;s forces. Many of them were drowned as the ice broke on the frozen Terek River. The outbreak of conflict was made more annoying to Berke by the rebellion of Suzdal at the same time, killing Mongol darughachis and tax-collectors. Berke planned a severe punitive expedition. But after Alexander Nevsky begged Berke not to punish his people, and the cities of Vladimir-Suzdal agreed to pay a large indemnity, Berke relented. Alexander died on his trip back in Gorodets on the Volga. He was well loved by the people and called the &quot;sun of Suzdal&quot;.

When the former Seljuk Sultan Kaykaus II was arrested in the Byzantine Empire, his younger brother Kayqubad II appealed to Berke. An Egyptian envoy was also detained there. With the assistance of the Kingdom of Bulgaria (Berke&#x27;s vassal), Nogai invaded the Empire in 1265. By the next year, the Mongol-Bulgarian army was within reach of Constantinople. Nogai forced Michael VIII Palaiologos to release Kaykaus and pay tribute to the Horde. Berke gave Kaykaus Crimea as an appanage and had him marry a Mongol woman. Hulagu died in February 1265 and Berke followed the next year while on campaign in Tiflis, causing his troops to retreat.

Ariq Böke had earlier placed Chagatai&#x27;s grandson Alghu as Chagatayid Khan, ruling Central Asia. He took control of Samarkand and Bukhara. When the Muslim elites and the Jochid retainers in Bukhara declared their loyalty to Berke, Alghu smashed the Golden Horde appanages in Khorazm. Alghu insisted Hulagu attack the Golden Horde; he accused Berke of purging his family in 1252. In Bukhara, he and Hulagu slaughtered all the retainers of the Golden Horde and reduced their families into slavery, sparing only the Great Khan Kublai&#x27;s men. After Berke gave his allegiance to Kublai, Alghu declared war on Berke, seizing Otrar and Khorazm. While the left bank of Khorazm would eventually be retaken, Berke had lost control over Transoxiana. In 1264 Berke marched past Tiflis to fight against Hulagu&#x27;s successor Abaqa, but he died en route.

=== Mengu-Timur (1266–1280) ===
Berke left no sons, so Batu&#x27;s grandson Mengu-Timur was nominated by Kublai and succeeded his uncle Berke. However, Mengu-Timur secretly supported the Ögedeid prince Kaidu against Kublai and the Ilkhanate. After the defeat of Ghiyas-ud-din Baraq, a peace treaty was concluded in 1267 granting one-third of Transoxiana to Kaidu and Mengu-Timur. In 1268, when a group of princes operating in Central Asia on Kublai&#x27;s behalf mutinied and arrested two sons of the Qaghan (Great Khan), they sent them to Mengu-Timur. One of them, Nomoghan, favorite of Kublai, was located in the Crimea. Mengu-Timur might have briefly struggled with Hulagu&#x27;s successor Abagha, but the Great Khan Kublai forced them to sign a peace treaty. He was allowed to take his share in Persia. Independently from the Khan, Nogai expressed his desire to ally with Baibars in 1271. Despite the fact that he was proposing a joint attack on the Ilkhanate with the Mamluks of Egypt, Mengu-Timur congratulated Abagha when Baraq was defeated by the Ilkhan in 1270.

In 1267, Mengu-Timur issued a diploma (&quot;jarliq&quot;) to exempt Russian clergy from any taxation, and gave to the Genoese and Venice exclusive trading rights in Caffa and Azov. Some of Mengu-Timur&#x27;s relatives converted to Christianity at the same time and settled in Russia; one of them was a prince who settled in Rostov and became known as Tsarevich Peter of the Horde (Peter Ordynsky). Even though Nogai invaded the Orthodox Christian Byzantine Empire in 1271, the Khan sent his envoys to maintain friendly relationship with Michael VIII Palaiologos, who sued for peace and married one of his daughters, Euphrosyne Palaiologina, to Nogai. Mengu-Timur ordered the grand prince of Vladimir to allow German merchants free travel through his lands. The gramota says:

This decree also allowed Novgorod&#x27;s merchants to travel throughout the lands of Suzdal without restraint. Mengu Timur honored his vow: when the Danes and the Livonian Knights attacked the Novgorod Republic in 1269, the Khan&#x27;s great , Amraghan, and many Mongols assisted the army assembled by the grand prince Yaroslav. The Germans and the Danes were so cowed that they sent gifts to the Mongols and abandoned the region of Narva. The Mongol Khan&#x27;s authority extended to all principalities, and in 1274–1275 the census took place in all cities, including Smolensk and Vitebsk.

In 1277, Mengu-Timur launched a campaign against the Alans north of the Caucasus. Along with the Mongol army were also some of the princes who were ordered to join him in his expedition, where they took the fortified stronghold of the Alans, Dadakov, in 1278. After his Ossetian expedition, Mengu-Timur turned his attention to affairs with the Byzantine Empire and Egypt in an attempt to curb the authority of Nogai. Following the death of Constantine of Bulgaria in 1277, Michael VIII and Nogai supported different candidates to the throne, leading to relations to deteriorate. This led to an intervention by Mengu-Timur in Balkan affairs, in which Mengu-Timur and Metropolitan Kirill sent Bishop Theognost as their joint envoy to Michael VIII and the patriarch of Constantinople with their respective gifts and letters.

=== Dual khanship (1281–1299) ===


Mengu-Timur was succeeded in 1281 by his brother Töde Möngke, who was a Muslim. However, Nogai Khan was now strong enough to establish himself as an independent ruler. The Golden Horde was thus ruled by two khans.

Töde Möngke made peace with Kublai, returned his sons to him, and acknowledged his supremacy. Nogai and Köchü, Khan of the White Horde and son of Orda Khan, also made peace with the Yuan dynasty and the Ilkhanate. According to Mamluk historians, Töde Möngke sent the Mamluks a letter proposing to fight against their common enemy, the unbelieving Ilkhanate. This indicates that he might have had an interest in Azerbaijan and Georgia, which were both ruled by the Ilkhans.

In the 1270s, Nogai had raided Bulgaria, as well as Lithuania. He blockaded Michael Asen II inside Drăstăr in 1279, executed the rebel emperor Ivailo in 1280, and forced George Terter I to seek refuge in the Byzantine Empire in 1292. In 1284, Saqchi came under the Mongol rule during the major invasion of Bulgaria, and coins were struck in the Khan&#x27;s name. Smilets was installed by Nogai as emperor of Bulgaria. Accordingly, the reign of Smilets has been considered the height of Mongol overlordship in Bulgaria. When he was expelled by a local boyars , the Mongols launched another invasion to protect their protege. Nogai compelled Serbian king Stefan Milutin to accept Mongol supremacy and received his son, Stefan Dečanski, as hostage in 1287. Under his rule, the Vlachs, Slavs, Alans, and Turco-Mongols lived in modern-day Moldavia.

At the same time, the influence of Nogai greatly increased in the Golden Horde. Backed by him, some princes, such as Dmitry of Pereslavl, refused to visit the court of Töde Möngke in Sarai, while Dmitry&#x27;s brother Andrey of Gorodets sought assistance from Töde Möngke. Nogai vowed to support Dmitry in his struggle for the grand princely throne. On hearing about this, Andrey renounced his claims to Vladimir and Novgorod and returned to Gorodets. He returned with Mongol troops sent by Töde Möngke and seized Vladimir from Dmitry. Dmitry retaliated with the support of Mongol troops from Nogai and retook his holdings. In 1285, Andrey again led a Mongol army under a Borjigin prince to Vladimir, but Dmitry expelled them.

In 1283, Mengu-Timur converted to Islam and abandoned state affairs. Rumors spread that the khan was mentally ill and only cared for clerics and sheikhs. In 1285, Talabuga and Nogai invaded Hungary. While Nogai was successful in subduing Slovakia, Talabuga stalled north of the Carpathian Mountains. Talabuga&#x27;s soldiers were angered and sacked Galicia and Volhynia instead. In 1286, Talabuga and Nogai attacked Poland and ravaged the country. After returning, Talabuga overthrew Töde Möngke, who was left to live in peace. Talabuga&#x27;s army made unsuccessful attempts to invade the Ilkhanate in 1288 and 1290.

During a punitive expedition against the Circassians, Talabuga became resentful of Nogai, whom he believed did not provide him with adequate support during the invasions of Hungary and Poland. Talabuga challenged Nogai, but was defeated in a coup and replaced with Toqta in 1291.

Andrey, accompanied by a number of Rostov princes and the bishop of Rostov, went to Toqta to renew his patent and complain about Dmitry. Mikhail Yaroslavich was summoned to appear before Nogai in Sarai, where he chose to side with Nogai and went to him instead for confirmation of his throne, while Dmitry refused to appear, considering himself to be a vassal of Nogai. Daniel, Alexander Nevsky&#x27;s youngest son, failed to appear at the court of Toqta. The division of the authority of the Golden Horde led to the creation of two rival groups of Russian princes. Toqta attempted to reassert his authority over northern Russia; he confirmed Andrey as the grand prince and authorized him to depose Dmitry, who refused to surrender his throne. Toqta sent a punitive expedition led by his brother, Dyuden, to punish those stubborn subjects, leading to the sacking of a number of cities in 1293, including Vladimir and Moscow, finally forcing Dmitry to abdicate. Only the city of Tver offered stiff resistance to the Mongol invaders, leading to another Mongol army being sent to attack the city. Nogai did not choose to intervene in Russian affairs but was concerned by Toqta&#x27;s actions; he found it necessary to remind Toqta that he still held supreme power in the affairs of the Golden Horde and consequently sent his senior wife to Toqta in 1293, where she was received with due honor. In the same year, Nogai sent an army to Serbia and forced the king to acknowledge himself as a vassal.
Nogai&#x27;s daughter married a son of Kublai&#x27;s niece, Kelmish, who was wife of a Qongirat general of the Golden Horde. Nogai was angry with Kelmish&#x27;s family because her Buddhist son despised his Muslim daughter. For this reason, he demanded Toqta send Kelmish&#x27;s husband to him. Nogai&#x27;s independent actions relating to Russian affairs and foreign merchants had already irritated Toqta. Toqta thus refused and declared war on Nogai. Toqta was defeated in their first battle. Nogai&#x27;s army turned their attention to Caffa and Soldaia, looting both cities. Within two years, Toqta returned and killed Nogai in 1299 at the Kagamlik, near the Dnieper. Toqta had his son stationed troops in Saqchi and along the Danube as far as the Iron Gate. Nogai&#x27;s son Chaka of Bulgaria, first escaped to the Alans, and then Bulgaria where he briefly ruled as emperor before he was murdered by Theodore Svetoslav on the orders of Toqta.

After Mengu-Timur died, rulers of the Golden Horde withdrew their support from Kaidu, the head of the House of Ögedei. Kaidu tried to restore his influence in the Golden Horde by sponsoring his own candidate Kobeleg against Bayan (), Khan of the White Horde. After taking military support from Toqta, Bayan asked help from the Yuan dynasty and the Ilkhanate to organize a unified attack on the Chagatai Khanate under the leadership of Kaidu and his second-in-command Duwa. However, the Yuan court was unable to send quick military support.

=== General peace (1299–1312) ===

From 1300 to 1302, a severe drought occurred in the areas surrounding the Black Sea. However, the troubles were soon overcome and conditions in the Golden Horde rapidly improved under Toqta&#x27;s reign. After the defeat of Nogai Khan, his followers either fled to Podolia or remained under the service of Toqta, to become what would eventually be known as the Nogai Horde.

Toqta established the Byzantine-Mongol alliance by Maria, an illegitimate daughter of Andronikos II Palaiologos. A report reached Western Europe that Toqta was highly favourable to the Christians. According to Muslim observers, however, Toqta remained an idol-worshiper (Buddhism and Tengerism) and showed favour to religious men of all faiths, though he preferred Muslims.

He demanded that the Ilkhan Ghazan and his successor Oljeitu give Azerbaijan back but was refused. Then he sought assistance from Egypt against the Ilkhanate. Toqta made his man ruler in Ghazna, but he was expelled by its people. Toqta dispatched a peace mission to the Ilkhan Gaykhatu in 1294, and peace was maintained mostly uninterrupted until 1318.

In 1304, ambassadors from the Mongol rulers of Central Asia and the Yuan dynasty announced to Toqta their general peace proposal. Toqta immediately accepted the supremacy of Yuan emperor Temür Öljeytü, and all yams (postal relays) and commercial networks across the Mongol khanates reopened. Toqta introduced the general peace among the Mongol khanates to the Russian princes at the assembly in Pereyaslavl (Pereslavl-Zalessky). The Yuan influence seemed to have increased in the Golden Horde as some of Toqta&#x27;s coins carried &#x27;Phags-pa script in addition to Mongolian script and Persian characters.
 As the head of the Mongol empire, the Mongol Great Khans of the Yuan sent 100 dings of silver and 300 bolts of silk to the Golden Horde every year and the Jochid ruler Toqta was given additional fiefs in China for his diplomatic and military assistance to the Great Khan. Unlike the early years of the Mongol empire, only the Great Khan&#x27;s agents governed Chinese fiefs on the behalf of the Yuan and the Golden Horde until the collapse of the Mongol rule in China.

On his southwestern borders, Toqta arrested the Italian residents of Sarai and besieged Caffa in 1307. The cause was apparently Toqta&#x27;s displeasure at the Genoese slave trade of his subjects, who were mostly sold as soldiers to Egypt. In 1308, Caffa was plundered by the Mongols.

During the late reign of Toqta, tensions between princes of Tver and Moscow became violent. Daniel of Moscow seized the town of Kolomna from Ryazan, which turned to the local &quot;basqaq&quot; for protection. However, this did not deter Daniel, who defeated the Ryazan and Mongol troops in 1301, and then seized Mozhaysk in 1303 and then Pereslavl-Zalessky, which threw off the already weak balance of interprincely relations. Daniel may have been motivated to round out his appanage, which in terms of the modern administrative divisions of Russia, was not larger than Moskovsky Uyezd before 1917. His tenacity laid the pattern for his successors to become the rulers of all of Russia proper.

Toqta organized a new conference for the princes in Pereslavl-Zalessky in the autumn of 1304, which was attended by leading princes including Andrey of Vladimir, Mikhail of Tver, and Yury of Moscow, Daniel&#x27;s eldest son who succeeded him after his death in March 1304. Maximos, the metropolitan of the Russian Orthodox Church, was also in attendance. Toqta possibly intended to completely transform the political organization of his Russian ulus, though there is little information about the last years of his reign, with there only being accounts in the Russian annals of the interrelations among the princes, while Arab and Persian chroniclers focused on the Golden Horde&#x27;s relations with Egypt and Iran. Toqta probably intended to eliminate the special status of the grand principality of Vladimir, and to place all the Russian princes on the same level as his vassals with a definite appanage assigned to each one of them. Toqta decided to personally visit northern Russia to settle the conflict between the princes, but he fell ill and died while crossing the Volga in 1312, according to the writer who continued Rashid al-Din&#x27;s &quot;History&quot;.

== Islamization ==

=== Öz Beg Khan (1313–1341) ===

After Öz Beg Khan assumed the throne in 1313, he adopted Islam as the state religion. He built a large mosque in the city of Solkhat in the Crimea in 1314 and proscribed Buddhism and Shamanism among the Mongols in the Golden Horde. By 1315, Öz Beg had successfully Islamicized the Horde and killed Jochid princes and Buddhist lamas who opposed his religious policy. Under the reign of Öz Beg, trade caravans went unmolested and there was general order in the Golden Horde. When Ibn Battuta visited Sarai in 1333, he found it to be a large and beautiful city with vast streets and fine markets where six &quot;nations&quot; – Mongols, Alans, Kypchaks, Circassians, Russians and Greeks – each had their own quarters. Merchants had a special walled section of the city all to themselves.

Öz Beg continued the alliance with the Mamluks begun by Berke and his predecessors. He kept a friendly relationship with the Mamluk Sultan and his shadow Caliph in Cairo. In 1320, the Jochid princess Tulunbay was married to Al-Nasir Muhammad, Sultan of Egypt. Al-Nasir Muhammad came to believe that Tulunbay was not a real Chingissid princess but an impostor. In 1327–1328, he divorced her, and she then married one of al-Nasir Muhammad&#x27;s commanders. When Öz Beg learned of the divorce in 1334–1335, he sent an angry missive. Al-Nasir Muhammad claimed that she had died and showed his ambassadors a fake legal document as proof, although Tulunbay still lived and would only pass away in 1340.

The Golden Horde invaded the Ilkhanate under Abu Sa&#x27;id in 1318, 1324, and 1335. Öz Beg&#x27;s ally Al-Nasir refused to attack Abu Sa&#x27;id because the Ilkhan and the Mamluk Sultan signed a peace treaty in 1323. In 1326 Öz Beg reopened friendly relations with the Yuan dynasty and began to send tributes thereafter. From 1339 he received annually 24,000 ding in Yuan paper currency from the Jochid appanages in China. Öz Beg allowed the Great Khan to export Russian, Alan and Kypchak soldiers to China. In 1316, possibly due to the discontent among Mongol elites in Iran, some of the Ilkhanid emirs approached Öz Beg to take the throne of the Ilkhanate, but the Jochid khan declined after consulting with his senior emir, Qutluq Timür.

Öz Beg, whose total army exceeded 300,000, repeatedly raided Thrace in aid of Bulgaria&#x27;s war against Byzantium and Serbia beginning in 1319. The Byzantine Empire under Andronikos II Palaiologos and Andronikos III Palaiologos was raided by the Golden Horde between 1320 and 1341, until the Byzantine port of Vicina Macaria was occupied. Friendly relations were established with the Byzantine Empire for a brief period after Öz Beg married Andronikos III Palaiologos&#x27;s illegitimate daughter, who came to be known as &quot;Bayalun&quot;. In 1333, she was given permission to visit her father in Constantinople and never returned, apparently fearing her forced conversion to Islam. Öz Beg&#x27;s armies pillaged Thrace for forty days in 1324 and for 15 days in 1337, taking 300,000 captives. In 1330, Öz Beg sent 15,000 troops to Serbia in 1330 but was defeated. Backed by Öz Beg, Basarab I of Wallachia declared an independent state from the Hungarian crown in 1330.

With Öz Beg&#x27;s assistance, the grand prince Mikhail Yaroslavich won the battle against the party in Novgorod in 1316. While Mikhail was asserting his authority, his rival Yury of Moscow ingratiated himself with Öz Beg so that he appointed him as the grand prince and gave him his sister, Konchak, in marriage. After spending three years at Öz Beg&#x27;s court, Yury returned with an army of Mongols and Mordvins. After he ravaged the villages of Tver, Yury was defeated by Mikhail, and his new wife and the Mongol general, Kawgady, were captured. While she stayed in Tver, Konchak, who converted to Christianity and adopted the name Agatha, died. Mikhail&#x27;s rivals suggested to Öz Beg that he had poisoned the Khan&#x27;s sister and revolted against his rule. Mikhail was summoned to Sarai and executed on 22 November 1318. Yury became the grand prince once more. Yury&#x27;s brother Ivan accompanied the Mongol general Akhmyl in suppressing a revolt by Rostov in 1320. In 1322, Mikhail&#x27;s son, Dmitry, seeking revenge for his father&#x27;s murder, went to Sarai and persuaded the Khan that Yury had appropriated a large portion of the tribute due to the Horde. Yury was summoned to the Horde for a trial, but he was killed by Dmitry before any formal investigation. Eight months later, Dmitry was also executed by the Horde for his crime. The grand princely title went to Aleksandr Mikhailovich. In early 1326, Yury&#x27;s remains were returned to Moscow and buried by the bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church headed by Metropolitan Peter.

Öz Beg&#x27;s approach to Russian affairs was less constructive than that of Toqta, in which he made no attempt to change things in Russia, with his goal being to prevent the formation of a unified Russian state and to keep the balance between its princes, especially between those of Tver and Moscow. In 1327, the baskak Shevkal, cousin of Öz Beg, arrived in Tver from the Horde, with a large retinue. They took up residence at Aleksander&#x27;s palace. Rumors spread that Shevkal wanted to occupy the throne for himself and introduce Islam to the city. The Tverians revolted after Shevkal established his office, and the Mongol commissioner and most of his lieutenants were killed. Öz Beg summoned Ivan I, the prince of Moscow, and ordered him to lead a punitive expedition along with Alexander of Suzdal; the Muscovite and Suzdalian troops, reinforced by Mongol detachments, looted Tver and captured thousands of prisoners. The incident, the Tver Uprising of 1327, caused Öz Beg to begin backing Moscow as the leading Russian state. Öz Beg refrained from giving Moscow too much power, giving the patent for the grand princely title to Alexander of Suzdal, though Ivan I would be appointed as grand prince four years later following Alexander&#x27;s death, and given the right to collect taxes from other Russian potentates. As a result of the good relations between Ivan I and Öz Beg, the Moscow region began to prosper and its population grew rapidly. Ivan I also added to his grand princely title &quot;and all Russia&quot; in an imitation of the Russian Orthodox metropolitan&#x27;s title, who moved his residence to Moscow, making it the ecclesiastical capital of Russia, but it also marked the beginning of the drive to unify Russia.

The Mongols had undermined the strength of Galicia and Volhynia, where the Danilovichi had sought to improve internal conditions in the country from the late 13th-century, with Yuri I assuming the royal title (&quot;rex Russiae&quot;) during his reign, but the Lithuanian grand dukes managed to build a strong army and administration as well as uniting the Lithuanian and Belarusian provinces under their rule. Following Yuri&#x27;s death in 1308, the situation in Galicia and Volhynia quickly deteriorated, with both of his sons dying in 1323, leading to the throne to be offered to Boleslav of Mazovia. He was confirmed by Öz Beg as &quot;Yuri II&quot;. Gediminas of Lithuania gained control of Kiev and installed his brother Fedor as prince, but the principality&#x27;s tribute to the Khan continued. On a campaign a few years later, the Lithuanians under Fedor included the Khan&#x27;s baskak in their entourage. Yuri II married a daughter of Gediminas and possibly gave his daughter in marriage to a son of Gediminas, leading to Öz Beg to intervene to prevent the plans of Poland and Lithuania. Mongol forces raided the borderlands of Lithuania in 1336 and then Lublin in Poland the next year. The prince of Smolensk defied Öz Beg&#x27;s authority, instead recognizing the suzerainty of Gediminas. After the sudden death of Yuri II, who had no heirs, a committee of Galician boyars led by Dmytro Dedko took control of the city; a detachment of Mongol troops was sent to protect Galicia and Volhynia from the Poles, who were forced to retreat but did not give up on their claims to the region.

A decree, issued probably by Mengu-Timur, allowing the Franciscans to proselytize, was renewed by Öz Beg in 1314. Öz Beg allowed the Christian Genoese to settle in Crimea after his accession, but the Mongols sacked their outpost Sudak in 1322 when the Genoese clashed with the Turks. The Genoese merchants in the other towns were not molested. Pope John XXII requested Öz Beg to restore Roman Catholic churches destroyed in the region. Öz Beg signed a new trade treaty with the Genoese in 1339 and allowed them to rebuild the walls of Caffa. In 1332 he allowed the Venetians to establish a colony at Tanais on the Don. In 1333, when Ibn Battuta visited Sudak, he found the population to be predominantly Turkish.

=== Jani Beg (1342–1357) ===
Öz Beg&#x27;s eldest son Tini Beg reigned briefly from 1341 to 1342 before his younger brother, Jani Beg (1342–1357), came to power.

In 1344, Jani Beg tried to seize Caffa from the Genoese but failed. In 1347, he signed a commercial treaty with Venice. The slave trade flourished due to strengthening ties with the Mamluk Sultanate. Growth of wealth and increasing demand for products typically produce population growth, and so it was with Sarai. Housing in the region increased, which transformed the capital into the center of a large Muslim Sultanate.

The Black Death of the 1340s was a major factor contributing to the economic downfall of the Golden Horde. It struck the Crimea in 1345 and killed over 85,000 people.
Jani Beg abandoned his father&#x27;s Balkan ambitions and backed Moscow against Lithuania and Poland. Jani Beg sponsored joint Mongol-Rus&#x27; military expeditions against Lithuania and Poland. In 1344, his army marched against Poland with auxiliaries from Galicia–Volhynia, as Volhynia was part of Lithuania. In 1349, however, Galicia–Volhynia was occupied by a Polish-Hungarian force, and the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia was finally conquered and incorporated into Poland. This act put an end to the relationship of vassalage between Galicia–Volhynia and the Golden Horde. In 1352, the Golden Horde with its Rus&#x27; allies ravaged Polish territory and Lublin. The Polish king, Casimir III the Great, submitted to the Horde in 1357 and paid tribute in order to avoid more conflicts. The seven Mongol princes were sent by Jani Beg to assist Poland.

Jani Beg asserted Jochid dominance over the Chagatai Khanate and conquered Tabriz, ending Chobanid rule there in 1356. After accepting the surrender of the Jalayirids, Jani Beg boasted that three uluses of the Mongol Empire were under his control. However, on his way back from Tabriz, Jani Beg was murdered on the order of his own son, Berdi Beg. Following the assassination of Jani Beg, the Golden Horde quickly lost Azerbaijan to the Jalayir king Shaikh Uvais in 1357.

== Decline ==

=== Great Troubles (1359–1381) ===

Berdi Beg was killed in a coup by his brother Qulpa in 1359. Qulpa&#x27;s two sons were Christians and bore the Slavic names Michael and Ivan, which outraged the Muslim populace of the Golden Horde. In 1360, Qulpa&#x27;s brother Nawruz Beg revolted against the khan and killed him and his sons. In 1361, a descendant of Shiban (5th son of Jochi) was invited by some grandees to seize the throne. Khidr rebelled against Nawruz, whose own lieutenant betrayed him and handed him over to be executed. Khidr was slain by his own son, Timur Khwaja, in the same year. Timur Khwaja reigned for only five weeks before descendants of Öz Beg Khan seized power.

In 1362, the Golden Horde was divided between Keldi Beg in Sarai, Bulat Temir in Volga Bulgaria, and Abdullah in Crimea. Meanwhile, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania attacked the western tributaries of the Golden Horde and conquered Kiev and Podolia after the Battle of Blue Waters in 1363. A powerful Mongol general by the name of Mamai backed Abdullah but failed to take Sarai, which saw the reign of two more khans, Murad and Aziz. Abdullah died in 1370 and Muhammad Bolaq was enthroned as puppet khan by Mamai. Mamai also had to deal with a rebellion in Nizhny Novgorod. Muscovite troops impinged on the Bulgar territory of Arab-Shah, the son of Bulat Temir, who caught them off guard and defeated them on the banks of the Pyana River. However Arab-Shah was unable to take advantage of the situation because of the advance of another Mongol general from the east. Encouraged by the news of Muscovite defeat, Mamai sent an army against Dmitry Donskoy, who defeated the Mongol forces at the Battle of the Vozha River in 1378. Mamai hired Genoese, Circassian, and Alan mercenaries for another attack on Moscow in 1380. In the ensuing battle, Mongol forces once again lost at the Battle of Kulikovo.

By 1360, Urus Khan had set up court in Sighnaq. He was named Urus, which means Russian in Turkish language, presumably because &quot;Urus-Khan&#x27;s mother was a Russian princess... he was prepared to press his claims on Russia on that ground.&quot; In 1372, Urus marched west and occupied Sarai. His nephew and lieutenant Tokhtamysh deserted him and went to Timur for assistance. Tokhtamysh attacked Urus, killing his son Kutlug-Buka, but lost the battle and fled to Samarkand. Soon after, another general Edigu deserted Urus and went over to Timur. Timur personally attacked Urus in 1376 but the campaign ended indecisively. Urus died the next year and was succeeded by his son, Timur-Melik, who immediately lost Sighnaq to Tokhtamysh. In 1378, Tokhtamysh conquered Sarai.

By the 1380s, the Shaybanids and Qashan attempted to break free of the Khan&#x27;s power.

=== Tokhtamysh (1381–1395) ===

Tokhtamysh attacked Mamai, who had recently suffered a loss against Moscow, and defeated him in 1381, thus briefly reestablishing the Golden Horde as a dominant regional power. Mamai fled to the Genoese who killed him soon after. Tokhtamysh sent an envoy to the Russian states to resume their tributary status, but the envoy only made it as far as Nizhny Novgorod before he was stopped. Tokhtamysh immediately seized all the boats on the Volga to ferry his army across and commenced the Siege of Moscow (1382), which fell after three days under a false truce. The next year, most of the Russian princes once again made obeisance to the khan and received patents from him. Tokhtamysh also crushed the Lithuanian army at Poltava in the next year. Władysław II Jagiełło, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland, accepted his supremacy and agreed to pay tribute in return for a grant of Russian territory.

Elated by his success, Tokhtamysh invaded Azerbaijan in 1386 and seized Tabriz. He ordered money with his name on it coined in Khwarezm and sent envoys to Egypt to seek an alliance. In 1387, Timur sent an army into Azerbaijan and fought indecisively with the forces of the Golden Horde. Tokhtamysh invaded Transoxania and reached as far as Bukhara, but failed to take the city, and had to turn back. Timur retaliated by invading Khwarezm and destroyed Urgench. Tokhtamysh attacked Timur on the Syr Darya in 1389 with a massive army including Russians, Bulgars, Circassians, and Alans. The battle ended indecisively. In 1391, Timur gathered an army 200,000 strong and defeated Tokhtamysh at the Battle of the Kondurcha River. Timur&#x27;s allies Temür Qutlugh and Edigu took the eastern half of the Golden Horde. Tokhtamysh returned in 1394, ravaging the region of Shirvan. In 1395, Timur annihilated Tokhtamysh&#x27;s army again at the Battle of the Terek River, destroyed his capital, looted the Crimean trade centers, and deported the most skillful craftsmen to his own capital in Samarkand. Timur&#x27;s forces reached as far north as Ryazan before turning back.

=== Edigu (1395–1419) ===

Temür Qutlugh was chosen Khan in Sarai while Edigu became co-ruler, and Koirijak was appointed sovereign of the White Horde by Timur. Tokhtamysh fled to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and asked Vytautas for assistance in retaking the Golden Horde in exchange for suzerainty over the Russian lands. In 1399, Vytautas and Tokhtamysh attacked Temür Qutlugh and Edigu at the Battle of the Vorskla River but were defeated. The Golden Horde victory secured Kiev, Podolia, and some land in the lower Bug River basin. Tokhtamysh died in obscurity in Tyumen around 1405. His son Jalal al-Din fled to Lithuania and participated in the Battle of Grunwald against the Teutonic Order.

Temür Qutlugh died in 1400 and his cousin Shadi Beg was elected khan with Edigu&#x27;s approval. After defeating Vytautas, Edigu concentrated on strengthening the Golden Horde. He forbade selling Golden Horde subjects as slaves abroad. Later on the slave trade was resumed, but only Circassians were allowed to be sold. As a result, most of the Mamluk recruits in the 15th century were of Circassian origin. Timur died in 1405 and Edigu took advantage to seize Khwarezm a year later. From 1400 to 1408, Edigu gradually regained the eastern Russian tributaries, with the exception of Moscow, which he failed to take in a siege but ravaged the surrounding area. Smolensk was also lost to Lithuania. Shadi Beg rebelled against Edigu but was defeated and fled to Astrakhan. Shadi Beg was replaced by Pulad, who died in 1410 and was succeeded by Temur Khan, the son of Temür Qutlugh. Temur Khan turned against Edigu and forced him to flee to Khwarezm in 1411. Temur himself was ousted the next year by Jalal al-Din, who returned from Lithuania and briefly took the throne. In 1414, Shah Rukh of the Timurids conquered Khwarezm. Edigu fled to the Crimea where he launched raids on Kiev and tried to forge an alliance with Lithuania to win back the horde. Edigu died in 1419 in a skirmish with one of Tokhtamysh&#x27;s sons.

== Disintegration and succession ==

=== Khanate of Sibir (1405) ===

The Khanate of Sibir was ruled by a dynasty originating with Taibuga in 1405 at Chimgi-Tura. After his death in 1428, the khanate was ruled by the Uzbek khan Abu&#x27;l-Khayr Khan. When he died in 1468, the khanate split in two, with the Shaybanid Ibak Khan situated in Chimgi-Tura, and the Taibugid Muhammad at the fortress of Sibir, from which the khanate derives its name.

=== Uzbek Khanate (1428) ===

After 1419, the Golden Horde functionally ceased to exist. Ulugh Muhammad was officially Khan of the Golden Horde but his authority was limited to the lower banks of the Volga where Tokhtamysh&#x27;s other son Kepek also reigned. The Golden Horde&#x27;s influence was replaced in Eastern Europe by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, who Ulugh Muhammad turned to for support. The political situation in the Golden Horde did not stabilize. In 1422, the grandson of Urus Khan, Barak Khan, attacked the reigning khans in the west. Within two years, Ulugh, Kepek, and another claimant Dawlat Berdi, were defeated. Ulugh Muhammad fled to Lithuania, Kepek tried to raid Odoyev and Ryazan but failed to establish himself in those regions, and Dawlat took advantage of the situation to seize Crimea. Barak defeated an invasion by Ulugh Beg in 1427 but was assassinated the next year. His successor, Abu&#x27;l-Khayr Khan, founded the Uzbek Khanate.

=== Nogai Horde (1440s) ===

By the 1440s, a descendant of Edigu by the name of Musa bin Waqqas was ruling at Saray-Jük as an independent khan of the Nogai Horde.

=== Khanate of Kazan (1445) ===

Ulugh Muhammad ousted Dawlat Berdi from Crimea. At the same time, the khan Hacı I Giray fled to Lithuania to ask Vytautas for support. In 1426, Ulugh Muhammad contributed troops to Vytautas&#x27; war against Pskov. Despite the Golden Horde&#x27;s greatly reduced status, both Yury of Zvenigorod and Vasily Kosoy still visited Ulugh Muhammad&#x27;s court in 1432 to request a grand ducal patent. A year later, Ulugh Muhammad lost the throne to Sayid Ahmad I, a son of Tokhtamysh. Ulugh Muhammad fled to the town of Belyov on the upper Oka River, where he came into conflict with Moscow. Vasily II of Moscow attempted to drive him out but was defeated at the Battle of Belyov. Ulugh Muhammad became master of Belyov. Ulugh Muhammad continued to exert influence on Moscow, occupying Gorodets in 1444. Vasily II even wanted him to issue him a patent for the throne, but Ulugh Muhammad attacked him instead at Murom in 1445. On 7 July, Vasily II was defeated and taken prisoner by Ulugh Muhammad at the Battle of Suzdal. Despite his victory, Ulugh Muhammad&#x27;s situation was pressed. The Golden Horde was no more, he had barely 10,000 soldiers, and thus could not press the advantage against Moscow. A few months later he released Vasily II for a ransom of 25,000 rubles. Unfortunately, Ulugh Muhammad was murdered by his son, Mäxmüd of Kazan, who fled to the middle Volga region and founded the Khanate of Kazan in 1445. In 1447, Mäxmüd sent an army against Moscow but was repelled.

=== Crimean Khanate (1449) ===

In 1449, Hacı I Giray seized Crimea from Ahmad I, and founded the Crimean Khanate. The Crimean Khanate considered its state as the heir and legal successor of the Golden Horde and Desht-i Kipchak, called themselves khans of &quot;the Great Horde, the Great State and the Throne of the Crimea&quot;.

=== Qasim Khanate (1452) ===

One of Ulugh Muhammad&#x27;s sons, Qasim Khan, fled to Moscow, where Vasily II granted him land that became the Qasim Khanate.

=== Kazakh Khanate (1458) ===

In 1458, Janibek Khan and Kerei Khan led 200,000 of Abu&#x27;l-Khayr Khan&#x27;s followers eastwards to the Chu River where Esen Buqa II of Moghulistan granted them pasture lands. After Abu&#x27;l-Khayr Khan died in 1467, they assumed leadership over most of his followers, and became the Kazakh Khanate.

=== Great Horde (1459–1502) ===
In 1435, the khan Küchük Muhammad ousted Sayid Ahmad. He attacked Ryazan and suffered a major defeat against the forces of Vasily II. Sayid Ahmad continued to raid Muscovy and in 1449 made a direct attack on Moscow. However he was defeated by Muscovy&#x27;s ally Qasim Khan. In 1450, Küchük Muhammad attacked Ryazan but was turned back by a combined Russo-Tatar army. In 1451, Sayid Ahmad tried to take Moscow again and failed.

Küchük Muhammad was succeeded by his son Mahmud bin Küchük in 1459, from which point on the Golden Horde came to be known as the Great Horde. Mahmud was succeeded by his brother Ahmed Khan bin Küchük in 1465. In 1469, Ahmed attacked and killed the Uzbek Abu&#x27;l-Khayr Khan. In the summer of 1470, Ahmed organized an attack against Moldavia, the Kingdom of Poland, and Lithuania. By August 20, the Moldavian forces under Stephen the Great defeated the Tatars at the battle of Lipnic. In 1474 and 1476, Ahmed insisted that Ivan III, the grand prince of Moscow, recognize the khan as his overlord. In 1480, Ahmed organized a military campaign against Moscow, resulting in a face off between two opposing armies known as the Great Stand on the Ugra River. Ahmed judged the conditions unfavorable and retreated. This incident formally ended the &quot;Tatar yoke&quot; over the Russian lands. On 6 January 1481, Ahmed was killed by Ibak Khan, the prince of the Khanate of Sibir, and Nogays at the mouth of the Donets River.

Ahmed&#x27;s sons were unable to maintain the Great Horde. They attacked the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (which possessed much of Ukraine at the time) in 1487–1491 and reached as far as Lublin in eastern Poland before being decisively beaten at Zaslavl.

The Crimean Khanate, which had become a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire in 1475, subjugated what remained of the Great Horde, sacking Sarai in 1502. After seeking refuge in Lithuania, Sheikh Ahmed, last Khan of the Horde, died in prison in the Kaunas Castle some time after 1504. According to other sources, he was released from the Lithuanian prison in 1527.

Records of Golden Horde existence reach however as far as end of 18th century and it was mentioned in works of Russian publisher Nikolay Novikov in his work of 1773 &quot;Ancient Russian Hydrography&quot;.

=== Astrakhan Khanate (1466) ===

After 1466, Mahmud bin Küchük&#x27;s descendants continued to rule in Astrakhan as the khans of the Astrakhan Khanate.

=== Russian conquests ===

The Tsardom of Russia conquered the Khanate of Kazan in 1552, the Khanate of Astrakhan in 1556, and the Khanate of Sibir in 1582. The Crimean Tatars wreaked havoc in southern Russia, Ukraine and even Poland in the course of the 16th and early 17th centuries (see Crimean–Nogai slave raids in Eastern Europe), but they were not able to defeat Russia or take Moscow. Under Ottoman protection, the Khanate of Crimea continued its precarious existence until Catherine the Great annexed it on April 8, 1783. It was by far one of the longest-lived of the successor states to the Golden Horde.

== Tributaries ==


The subjects of the Golden Horde included Alans, Armenians, Bulgarians, Circassians, Crimean Greeks, Crimean Goths, Georgians, Russians, and Vlachs. The objective of the Golden Horde in conquered lands revolved around obtaining recruits for the army and exacting tax payments from its subjects. In most cases the Golden Horde did not implement direct control over the people they conquered. Moreover, Jochird rulers owned a fief in Dunhuang, 41,302 households in Pingyang, Shansi, 10,000 households in Zhending and Chinzhou, and additional apanages in Liaoshan and Heshun in China, as well as large fiefs in Azerbaijan and Iran, which was acquired later by the Ilkhanate, that led to the conflicts between two Mongol dynasties, and 5,000 men in Bukhara.

=== Influence ===

Aristocratic Russians responded more uniformly to Mongol rule but the same cannot be said with certainty for the peasantry. There is not much evidence for Mongol influence on the Russian peasantry, whose direct contact with the Mongols was mainly through slavery or forced labor. Russian sources generally tend to focus on military encounters with the Mongols but the literary prose betrays a greater Mongol impact on Russian society than accepted at face value. There was a great deal of familiarity with the Mongols among writers, who recorded the name of virtually every Mongol prince, grandee, and official they came into contact with. The &quot;Galician–Volhynian Chronicle&quot; recounts the words of Tovrul, a captured informant at the Siege of Kiev (1240), who identifies the Mongol captains by name. Russian sources contain a list of the khans of the Golden Horde as well as more detail on their careers during the time of Great Troubles than Arab-Persian sources. Even the names of numerous lesser ranked Mongols are mentioned. The Mongol khan was called &quot;tsar&quot;, a title also used for the &quot;basileus&quot;. It is evident that the writers expected their audience to be familiar with the names of individual Mongols and their attributes despite their pervasive hostility.

While the Mongols generally did not directly administer all of the Eastern European lands they conquered, in the cases of the Principality of Pereyaslavl, Principality of Kiev, and Podolia, they removed the native administration altogether and replaced it with their own direct control. The Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia, Principality of Smolensk, Principality of Chernigov, and Principality of Novgorod-Seversk retained their princes but also had to contend with Mongol agents who enforced recruitment and tax collection. The Novgorod Republic was exempt from the presence of Mongol agents after 1260 but still had to pay taxes. The Mongols took censuses in 1245, 1258, 1259, 1260, 1274, and 1275. No further censuses were taken after that. Some places such as the town of Tula became the personal property of individual Mongols such as the Khatun Taidula, the mother of Jani Beg.

The Russian aristocracy had to familiarize themselves with the workings of Mongol high society. The prince had to receive a patent for his throne from the khan, who then sent an envoy to install the prince on his throne. From the time of Öz Beg Khan on, a commissioner was appointed by the khan to reside at each of the principalities&#x27; capitals. Mongol rule loosened in the late 13th century so that some princes were able to collect taxes as the khan&#x27;s agents. By the early 14th century, all the grand dukes were collecting taxes by themselves, so that the average people no longer dealt with Mongol overlords while their rulers answered to Sarai.

Aristocratic familiarity with Mongol customs did not result in adopting Mongol culture. Any partiality shown towards Mongol customs could be dangerous, although in one instance they did adopt Mongol military attire. After visiting Batu&#x27;s camp in 1245, Daniel of Galicia was visibly influenced by the Mongols, and equipped his army in the Mongol fashion. Austrian visitors to his camp remarked that only Daniel himself dressed according to the custom in Rus&#x27;, with a coat of Greek brocade with gold lace, green leather boots, a gilded saddle, and gold-encrusted sword. Mongols that moved into Russian society shed their former customs as they adopted Orthodox Christianity and despite the numerous mentions of Mongol atrocities, some more honorable portrayals do exist. In &quot;The Tale of the Destruction of Ryazan&quot;, the Mongol Batu exhibited chivalric courtesy to the Russian noble Evpaty by allowing his men to carry him off the field in honor of his bravery. Russian nobles also fought alongside the Mongols as allies at times.

Intermarriage did happen but was rare. Theodore Rostislavich, Yury of Moscow, and Gleb Vasilkovich married Mongol princesses. Geb Vasilkovich spent his entire career among the Mongols in the steppes. Urus Khan&#x27;s mother may have been a Russian princess. Such intermarriage ceased after the Golden Horde Mongols converted to Islam until the 15th century when the weakened Horde&#x27;s Mongol grandees moved into Muscovite territory. Most of them entered into the service of grand princes, married aristocracy, converted to Christianity, and became assimilated. It is uncertain how much Mongol Tatar blood entered the Russian aristocracy. Some Mongols might have changed their names after converting while Russians took on Mongol nicknames as patronyms. The nobles of Ryazan and the Godunov clan of prince Chet claimed Tatar descent. Mongol ancestry was considered as prestigious as German, Latin, and Greek ancestry in the 16th century, although such views declined dramatically after the Time of Troubles. There was also intermarriage with their other subjects, such as between Berke and a Seljuk princess, and Jöge (eldest son of Nogai) and a Bulgarian princess.

==== Russian Orthodox Church ====

During early Mongol rule, the &quot;basqaqs&quot; collected taxes imposed by the Mongols, with only Russian clergy being exempt from the taxes, in a system known in Russian as &quot;baskachestvo&quot; (). In the privilege charters given to Russian clergy, the terms &quot;dan&quot; and &quot;poshlina&quot; are given, which, by the second half of the 13th century, primarily came to refer to the Tatar tribute.

The Mongols required the Russian Orthodox Church to pray for the health of the khan and in return they looked after the church&#x27;s health and fostered its growth. A bishopric was established in Sarai for Russians and to act as an intermediary between the Golden Horde and both the Russian Church and Byzantium. The khans granted the Church significant tax privileges which enabled it to recover from the invasion and prosper even more than before. It was during the 14th century that the Church made decisive inroads into the pagan countryside, possibly due to the attraction of economic benefits bestowed upon Church lands that incentivized peasants to settle. The &quot;Tale of Peters, tsarevich of the Horde&quot; was written in the 14th century. It tells of how the Mongol Peter, a descendant of Genghis Khan, converted and founded the Petrov monastery. Peter&#x27;s descendants used their ties to the khans to protect the monastery from the Rostov princes and the neighboring Russians who desired the fishing rights to that land. The depiction of Mongols by Church was mixed and awkward. It portrayed them as a disaster and their caretaker. This contradiction can be seen in the khans&#x27; portrayals in Church texts. Where the khans&#x27; names would have been in the missals, there was a blank space for the name to be read aloud orally. There was also a careful delineation between khan and &quot;Tatars&quot;. Hagiographers sometimes absolved the khans from their role in killing Russian princes. After the khans&#x27; power began to wane in the 14th century, the Church gave its full backing to the Russian princes. However even after Mongol rule ended, the Church still invoked the Mongol model as an example of how they should be treated. In the 16th century, churchmen circulated a translated Mongol &quot;yarlyk&quot; that granted tax immunity to the Church.

==== Administration ====

The historian Charles Halperin cautioned: &quot;To analyze the Mongols&#x27; administration of Russia requires meticulous examination both of the extant sources individually and of the larger picture they present. Many of the references to Mongol officials occur in unreliable texts from later periods, showing obvious signs of interpolation.&quot; Although it is evident that the Mongols started collecting taxes in the principalities as early as 1245 (shortly after they subdued them during or after the invasion of 1237), this appears to have been a localised affair with &quot;baskaki&quot; (singular &quot;baskak&quot; or &quot;basqaq&quot;, a Turkic word used in early sources meaning a local Mongol official who was primarily responsible for collecting tribute and conscripting troops), appointed per village, town or city, rather than a simultaneous imposition of a uniform taxation system.

During the first half of the 14th century, the &quot;basqaqs&quot; disappeared and the Russian princes themselves began to gather the total sum of taxes following a number of revolts at the end of the 13th century, leading to the princes to act as governors on behalf of the khan. The handling of Russian affairs was moved to Sarai, where various &quot;darughas&quot; supervised the Russian principalities. Along with the &quot;darugha&quot; of Moscow, other &quot;darughas&quot; may have existed with the same level of authority over other Russian territories such Ryazan and Tver. By the 14th century, the other &quot;drughas&quot; likely disappeared as the grand prince of Moscow assumed the role of collecting and presenting the taxes from all the Russian principalities. As the Horde became politically weakened and the grand princes of Moscow grew in power, it was possible for the tribute to be withheld, such as in 1372–1382 and 1396–1408. Ultimately, Ivan III stopped paying tribute in 1472–1476, leading to a standoff in 1480 which ended without military confrontation.

Moscow adopted the Mongol tax system and continued to collect tribute after they stopped passing it onto the Golden Horde. The Muscovite grand princes replaced the Mongol &quot;basqaq&quot; with officials called &quot;danshchiki&quot; who collected tribute known as &quot;dan&quot;, which was probably modeled after the Mongol tribute system. The Russians adopted the Mongol word for treasury, &quot;kazna&quot;, treasurer, &quot;kaznachey&quot;, and money, &quot;den&#x27;ga&quot;. The Muscovites used the Mongol customs tax system called &quot;tamga&quot;, from which the Russian word &quot;tamozhnya&quot; (customs house) is derived from. The &quot;yam&quot; postal system was adopted by Russia in the late 15th century as the peasants had already been paying a &quot;yam&quot; tax for centuries. The practice of &quot;poruka&quot;, collective responsibility of a sworn group, became more common in Russia during the Mongol period and may have been influenced by the Mongols. The Mongols may have spread the practice of beating the shins as a punishment from China to Russia, where this punishment for non-payment of debts was called &quot;pravezh&quot;. When the grand princes of Moscow collected the tribute, the term &quot;vykhod&quot; became more common instead of &quot;dan&quot;.

The existence of a double taxation system led to the increased exploitation of the Russian peasants and the gradual enrichment of the treasuries of the Russian princes; in addition, the tax obligations were greater for those who were poorer. The Russians also attempted to evade the yearly tribute, taking advantage of Tatar infighting, while at the same time also continuing the collection of tribute. The Tatar taxation system was exploitative for the Russian principalities during the 13th century, but by the 14th century, the grand principality of Moscow experienced uninterrupted economic growth starting from the reign of Ivan I. The grand princes of Moscow also manipulated the &quot;vykhod&quot;, which was made up of various taxes and tolls, allowing them to increase their revenue by imposing larger sums than was necessary, while the Tatar tribute was typically a negotiated sum. The most credible estimates put the amount of tribute between 5,000 and 7,000 rubles per year between 1380 and 1472, falling to 1,000 rubles after 1480. The tribute to the Horde decreased and was at times interrupted during the 14th and 15th centuries as a result of its political decline and the strengthening of Russian and Polish–Lithuanian authority.

==== Military ====

Some of the Mongols&#x27; subjects adopted Mongol military accoutrements. In 1245, Daniel of Galicia&#x27;s army was dressed in the Mongol fashion after a visit to Batu Khan&#x27;s camp. Austrian visitors to Daniel&#x27;s camp remarked that with the exception of Daniel himself, all the horsemen dressed like Mongols. Muscovite cavalrymen were equipped in a similar fashion to the Mongols as late as the 16th century, when they were depicted using a Mongol-style saddle with Mongol stirrups, wearing a Mongol helmet, and armed with a Mongol bow and quiver. European observers mistook them for Ottoman dress. Muscovite armies also deployed in a similar fashion to the Mongols with the right guard ranked above the left (due to a shamanist belief). The emphasis on cavalry declined in the 16th century as warfare increasingly involved sieges in Eastern Europe than on the steppes with nomadic horsemen.

=== Decline ===
Mongol rule in Galicia ended with its conquest by the Kingdom of Poland in 1349. The Golden Horde entered severe decline after the death of Berdi Beg in 1359, which started a protracted political crisis lasting two decades. In 1363, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania won the Battle of Blue Waters against the Golden Horde and conquered both Kiev and Podolia. After 1360, payment of tribute and taxes from Russian subjects to the declining Golden Horde decreased significantly. In 1374, Nizhny Novgorod rebelled and slaughtered an embassy sent by Mamai. For a brief period after the victorious Battle of Kulikovo in 1380 by Dmitry Donskoy against Mamai, Moscow was free of Mongol control until Tokhtamysh restored Mongol suzerainty over Moscow two years later following a siege. Tokhtamysh also crushed the Lithuanian army at Poltava in the next year. Władysław II Jagiełło, the grand duke of Lithuania and king of Poland, accepted his supremacy and agreed to pay tribute in turn for a grant of territory. In 1395, Timur annihilated Tokhtamysh&#x27;s army again at the Battle of the Terek River, destroyed his capital, looted the Crimean trade centers, and deported the most skillful craftsmen to his own capital in Samarkand. Timur&#x27;s forces reached as far north as Ryazan before turning back. Tokhtamysh fled to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and asked Vytautas for assistance in retaking the Golden Horde in exchange for suzerainty over the lands that were taken. In 1399, Vytautas and Tokhtamysh attacked Temür Qutlugh and Edigu at the Battle of the Vorskla River but were defeated. The Golden Horde victory secured for it Kiev, Podolia, and some land in the lower Bug River basin. Tokhtamysh died in obscurity in Tyumen around 1405. His son Jalal al-Din fled to Lithuania and participated in the Battle of Grunwald against the Teutonic Order.

From 1400 to 1408, Edigu gradually regained control of tributaries in Russia, with the exception of Moscow, which he failed to take in a siege but ravaged the surrounding countryside. Smolensk was lost to Lithuania. After Edigu died in 1419, the Golden Horde rapidly disintegrated but it still retained some vestige of influence in Eastern Europe. In 1426, Ulugh Muhammad contributed troops to Vytautas&#x27; war against Pskov and despite the horde&#x27;s reduced size, both Yury of Zvenigorod and Vasily Kosoy still visited Ulugh Muhammad&#x27;s court in 1432 to request a grand ducal patent. A year later, Ulugh Muhammad was ousted and fled to the town of Belev on the upper Oka River, where he came into conflict with Vasily II of Moscow, whom he defeated twice in battle. In 1445, Vasily II was taken prisoner by Ulugh Muhammad and ransomed for 25,000 rubles. Ulugh Muhammad was murdered in the same year by his son, Mäxmüd of Kazan, who fled to the middle Volga region and founded the Khanate of Kazan.

In 1447, Mäxmüd sent an army against Muscovy but was repelled. Another of Ulugh Muhammad&#x27;s sons, Qasim Khan, fled to Moscow, where Vasily II granted him land that became the Qasim Khanate Both the khans Küchük Muhammad and Sayid Ahmad attempted to reassert authority over Moscow. Küchük Muhammad attacked Ryazan and suffered a major defeat against the forces of Vasily II. Sayid Ahmad continued to raid Muscovy and in 1449, made a direct attack on Moscow. However he was defeated by Muscovy&#x27;s ally Qasim Khan. In 1450, Küchük Muhammad attacked Ryazan but was turned back by a combined Russo-Tatar army. In 1451, Sayid Ahmad tried to take Moscow again and failed.

In the summer of 1470, Ahmed Khan bin Küchük, ruler of the Great Horde, organized an attack against Moldavia, the Kingdom of Poland, and Lithuania. By August 20, the Moldavian forces under Stephen the Great defeated the Tatars at the battle of Lipnic. In 1474 and 1476, Ahmed insisted that Ivan III of Russia recognize the khan as his overlord. In 1480, Ahmed organized a military campaign against Moscow, resulting in a face off between two opposing armies known as the Great Stand on the Ugra River. Ahmed judged the conditions unfavorable and retreated. This incident formally ended the &quot;Tatar yoke&quot; over the Russian lands.

In 1502, the Horde was absorbed by the Crimean Khanate.

== Trade ==

Sarai carried on a brisk trade with the Genoese trade emporiums on the coast of the Black Sea – Soldaia, Caffa, and Azak. Mamluk Egypt was the Khans&#x27; long-standing trade partner and ally in the Mediterranean. Berke, the Khan of Kipchak had drawn up an alliance with the Mamluk Sultan Baibars against the Ilkhanate in 1261.

=== A change in trade routes ===

According to Baumer the natural trade route was down the Volga to Serai where it intersected the east–west route north of the Caspian, and then down the west side of the Caspian to Tabriz in Persian Azerbaijan where it met the larger east–west route south of the Caspian. In 1262, Berke began a war with the Il-Khan Hulagu Khan. This led to several battles on the west side of the Caspian which the Horde usually lost. The interruption of trade and conflict with Persia led the Horde to build trading towns along the northern route. They also allied with the Mamluks of Egypt who were the Il-Khan&#x27;s enemies. Trade between the Horde and Egypt was carried by the Genoese based in Crimea. An important part of this trade was slaves for the Mamluk army. Trade was weakened by a quarrel with the Genoese in 1307 and a Mamluk-Persian peace in 1323. Circa 1336 the Ilkhanate began to disintegrate which shifted trade north. Around 1340, the route north of the Caspian was described by Pegolotti. In 1347 a Horde siege of the Genoese Crimean port of Kaffa led to the spread of the black death to Europe. In 1395–96 Tamerlane laid waste to the Horde&#x27;s trading towns. Since they had no agricultural hinterland many of the towns vanished and trade shifted south.

== Geography and society ==

Genghis Khan assigned four Mongol mingghans: the Sanchi&#x27;ud (or Salji&#x27;ud), Keniges, Uushin, and Je&#x27;ured clans to Jochi. By the beginning of the 14th century, noyans from the Sanchi&#x27;ud, Hongirat, Ongud (Arghun), Keniges, Jajirad, Besud, Oirat, and Je&#x27;ured clans held importants positions at the court or elsewhere. There existed four mingghans (4,000) of the Jalayir in the left wing of the Ulus of Jochi (Golden Horde).

The population of the Golden Horde was largely a mixture of Turks and Mongols who adopted Islam later, as well as smaller numbers of Finno-Ugric peoples, Sarmato-Scythians, Slavs, and people from the Caucasus, among others (whether Muslim or not). Most of the Horde&#x27;s population was Turkic: Kipchaks, Cumans, Volga Bulgars, Khwarezmians, and others. The Horde was gradually Turkified and lost its Mongol identity, while the descendants of Batu&#x27;s original Mongol warriors constituted the upper class. They were commonly named &quot;the Tatars&quot; by the Russians and Europeans. Russians preserved this common name for this group down to the 20th century. Whereas most members of this group identified themselves by their ethnic or tribal names, most also considered themselves to be Muslims. Most of the population, both agricultural and nomadic, adopted the Kypchak language, which developed into the regional languages of Kypchak groups after the Horde disintegrated.

The descendants of Batu ruled the Golden Horde from Sarai Batu and later Sarai Berke, controlling an area ranging from the Volga River and the Carpathian Mountains to the mouth of the Danube River. The descendants of Orda ruled the area from the Ural River to Lake Balkhash. Censuses recorded Chinese living quarters in the Tatar parts of Novgorod, Tver and Moscow.

=== Internal organization ===

The Golden Horde&#x27;s elites were descended from four Mongol clans, Qiyat, Manghut, Sicivut and Qonqirat. Their supreme ruler was the Khan, chosen by the &quot;kurultai&quot; among Batu Khan&#x27;s descendants. The prime minister, also ethnically Mongol, was known as &quot;prince of princes&quot;, or &quot;beklare-bek&quot;. The ministers were called &quot;viziers&quot;. Local governors, or , were responsible for levying taxes and dealing with popular discontent. Civil and military administration, as a rule, were not separate.

The Horde developed as a sedentary rather than nomadic culture, with Sarai evolving into a large, prosperous metropolis. In the early 14th century, the capital was moved considerably upstream to Sarai Berqe, which became one of the largest cities of the medieval world, with 600,000 inhabitants. Sarai was described by the famous traveller Ibn Battuta as &quot;one of the most beautiful cities ... full of people, with the beautiful bazaars and wide streets&quot;, and having 13 congregational mosques along with &quot;plenty of lesser mosques&quot;. Another contemporary source describes it as &quot;a grand city accommodating markets, baths and religious institutions&quot;. An astrolabe was discovered during excavations at the site and the city was home to many poets, most of whom are known to us only by name.

Despite Russian efforts at proselytizing in Sarai, the Mongols clung to their traditional animist or shamanist beliefs until Uzbeg Khan (1312–1341) adopted Islam as a state religion. Several rulers – Mikhail of Chernigov and Mikhail of Tver among them – were reportedly assassinated in Sarai, but the Khans were generally tolerant and even released the Russian Orthodox Church from paying taxes.

=== Provinces ===

The Mongols favored decimal organization, which was inherited from Genghis Khan. It is said that there were a total of ten political divisions within the Golden Horde. The Golden Horde majorly was divided into Blue Horde (Kok Horde) and White Horde (Ak Horde). Blue Horde consisted of Pontic–Caspian steppe, Khazaria, Volga Bulgaria, while White Horde encompassed the lands of the princes of the left hand: Taibugin Yurt, Ulus Shiban, Ulus Tok-timur, Ulus Ezhen Horde.

==== Vassal territories ====

* Venetian port cities in Crimea (center at Qırım). After the Mongol conquest in 1238, the port cities in Crimea paid the Jochids custom duties, and the revenues were divided among all Chingisid princes of the Mongol Empire in accordance with the appanage system.,
* the banks of Azov,
* the country of Circassians,
* Walachia,
* Alania,
* Russian lands.

== Genetics ==

A 2016 study analyzed the DNA of 5 skeletons in Tavan Tolgoi, Mongolia dated between 1130–1250 AD, which are believed to be members of the Mongol Golden Family based on contextual evidence. The male individuals possibly associated with the Golden Family belonged to the West Eurasian paternal haplogroup R1b-M343, while one male of commoner status belonged to R1a. Four of the skeletons belonged to the East Eurasian mtDNA haplogroups D4 and CZ. All the skulls dated from Tavan Tolgoi graves were anthropologically Mongoloid. Despite their East Asian physical appearance, their genealogical admixture reveals a admixture of Mongoloid and Caucasoid ethnic groups which was attributed to inter-racial marriages between Mongolian plateau females and male migrants from Europe; however the authors could not determine when and how these intermarriages took place but it was likely to have existed through generations of intermixing through their ancestors, before the existence of the Golden family.

The study proposed multiple theories as to how the bodies were related to the Golden Family. The Tavan Tolgoi bodies could have been product of marriages between the female lineage of Genghis Khan’s Borjigin clan and the male lineage of either the Hongirad clans or the Ongud. The Ongud were a tribe that may have originated in West Asia and were descended from the Shatuo Turks, suggesting that they may have had a Caucasoid appearance based on the fact they were carriers of haplogroup R1b. Contemporary records from the Later Tang (923–937 AD) described some male Shatuo Turks as having deep set eyes with whiskers as well as slim bodies with light complexion. Many Ongud were resettled in the Golden Horde as administrators. Authors suggested that the Genghis Khan’s male lineage may have had some Caucasoid-specific genetic features because of descriptions in Rashid al-Din Hamadani&#x27;s &quot;Compendium of Chronicles&quot; written in the 14th century. The bodies could have been related to Genghis Khan&#x27;s male lineage, which they propose had R1b. It is also possible the bodies were related to Genghis Khan&#x27;s relatives or his generals who were not part of the male-lineage Borjigin clan.

These authors noted that there is a close link between the current day distribution of haplogroup R1b and the spread of the Mongol Empire, especially in the Golden Horde and Chagatai Khanate; and that the descendants of the Tavan Tolgoi specimens are now located mainly in West Eurasia, rather than Mongolia. A close association was observed between haplogroup R1b-M343 and the descendants of the Golden Horde, with a high frequency of R1b-M343 among Bashkirs and Eastern Russian Tatars, implying they may be direct descendants of the Tavan Tolgoi specimens. However R1b is largely absent from Mongolia, which the authors propose may have been caused by mass migration of Golden Family members and the Ongud to Eastern Europe and Central Asia, or massacres of Borjigin members there while West Eurasia was relatively safe.

A 2018 genetic study published in &quot;Nature&quot; examined the remains of two males buried in the Ulytau District in Kazakhstan . One male, who was a Buddhist member of the Golden Horde army, was of East Asian ancestry and carried paternal haplogroup C3 and the maternal haplogroup D4m2. The other male, who was of West Eurasian (European) ancestry, was a carrier of the paternal haplogroup R1 and the maternal haplogroup I1b. According to the authors, this could suggest assimilation of distinct ethnic groups in to the Golden Horde, however he could also be servant or slave.

<doc id="147912" wikidata="Q1190543" url="?curid=147912" title="Power rule">
<text>In calculus, the power rule is used to differentiate functions of the form formula_1, whenever formula_2 is a real number. Since differentiation is a linear operation on the space of differentiable functions, polynomials can also be differentiated using this rule. The power rule underlies the Taylor series as it relates a power series with a function&#x27;s derivatives.

== Statement of the power rule==
Let formula_3 be a function satisfying formula_4 for all formula_5, where formula_6. Then, 
:formula_7
The power rule for integration states that 
:formula_8
for any real number formula_9. It can be derived by inverting the power rule for differentiation. In this equation C is any constant.

==Proofs==

===Proof for real exponents===
Let where formula_2 is any real number. 

If then where formula_11 is the natural logarithm function, 
or as was required. 
Therefore, applying the chain rule to we see that 
formula_12
which simplifies to 

When we may use the same definition with where we now have This necessarily leads to the same result. Note that because formula_13 does not have a conventional definition when formula_2 is not a rational number, irrational power functions are not well defined for negative bases. In addition, as rational powers of −1 with even denominators (in lowest terms) are not real numbers, these expressions are only real valued for rational powers with odd denominators (in lowest terms).

Finally, whenever the function is differentiable at the defining limit for the derivative is:
formula_15
which yields 0 only when formula_2 is a rational number with odd denominator (in lowest terms) and and 1 when For all other values of the expression formula_17 is not well-defined for as was covered above, or is not a real number, so the limit does not exist as a real-valued derivative. For the two cases that do exist, the values agree with the value of the existing power rule at 0, so no exception need be made.

The exclusion of the expression formula_18 (the case from our scheme of exponentiation is due to the fact that the function formula_19 has no limit at (0,0), since formula_20 approaches 1 as x approaches 0, while formula_21 approaches 0 as y approaches 0. Thus, it would be problematic to ascribe any particular value to it, as the value would contradict one of the two cases, dependent on the application. It is traditionally left undefined.

===Proofs for integer exponents===
====Proof by induction (natural numbers)====
Let formula_22. It is required to prove that formula_23 The base case may be when formula_24 or formula_25, depending on how the set of natural numbers is defined.

When formula_24, formula_27

When formula_28, formula_29 

Therefore, the base case holds either way.

Suppose the statement holds for some natural number &quot;k&quot;, i.e. formula_30

When formula_31,formula_32By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers &quot;n&quot;.

====Proof by binomial theorem (natural number)====
Let formula_33, where formula_34.

Then,formula_35

Since n choose 1 is equal to n, and the rest of the terms all contain h, which is 0, the rest of the terms cancel. This proof only works for natural numbers as the binomial theorem only works for natural numbers.

====Generalization to negative integer exponents====
For a negative integer &quot;n&quot;, let formula_36 so that &quot;m&quot; is a positive integer.
Using the reciprocal rule,formula_37In conclusion, for any integer formula_38, formula_39

===Generalization to rational exponents=== 
Upon proving that the power rule holds for integer exponents, the rule can be extended to rational exponents.
====Proof by chain rule====
This proof is composed of two steps that involve the use of the chain rule for differentiation.
# Let formula_40, where formula_41. Then formula_42. By the chain rule, formula_43. Solving for formula_44, formula_45Thus, the power rule applies for rational exponents of the form formula_46, where formula_38 is a nonzero natural number. This can be generalized to rational exponents of the form formula_48 by applying the power rule for integer exponents using the chain rule, as shown in the next step.
# Let formula_49, where formula_50 so that formula_51. By the chain rule, formula_52 
From the above results, we can conclude that when formula_2 is a rational number, formula_54

====Proof by implicit differentiation====
A more straightforward generalization of the power rule to rational exponents makes use of implicit differentiation.

Let formula_55, where formula_56 so that formula_57.

Then,formula_58Differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to formula_5,formula_60Solving for formula_44,formula_62Since formula_63,formula_64Applying laws of exponents,formula_65Thus, letting formula_66, we can conclude that formula_67 when formula_2 is a rational number.

== History==
The power rule for integrals was first demonstrated in a geometric form by Italian mathematician Bonaventura Cavalieri in the early 17th century for all positive integer values of formula_69, and during the mid 17th century for all rational powers by the mathematicians Pierre de Fermat, Evangelista Torricelli, Gilles de Roberval, John Wallis, and Blaise Pascal, each working independently. At the time, they were treatises on determining the area between the graph of a rational power function and the horizontal axis. With hindsight, however, it is considered the first general theorem of calculus to be discovered. The power rule for differentiation was derived by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, each independently, for rational power functions in the mid 17th century, who both then used it to derive the power rule for integrals as the inverse operation. This mirrors the conventional way the related theorems are presented in modern basic calculus textbooks, where differentiation rules usually precede integration rules.

Although both men stated that their rules, demonstrated only for rational quantities, worked for all real powers, neither sought a proof of such, as at the time the applications of the theory were not concerned with such exotic power functions, and questions of convergence of infinite series were still ambiguous.

The unique case of formula_70 was resolved by Flemish Jesuit and mathematician Grégoire de Saint-Vincent and his student Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa in the mid 17th century, who demonstrated that the associated definite integral,
:formula_71
representing the area between the rectangular hyperbola formula_72 and the x-axis, was a logarithmic function, whose base was eventually discovered to be the transcendental number e. The modern notation for the value of this definite integral is formula_73, the natural logarithm.

==Generalizations==

===Complex power functions===

If we consider functions of the form formula_74 where formula_75 is any complex number and formula_76 is a complex number in a slit complex plane that excludes the branch point of 0 and any branch cut connected to it, and we use the conventional multivalued definition formula_77, then it is straightforward to show that, on each branch of the complex logarithm, the same argument used above yields a similar result: formula_78.

In addition, if formula_75 is a positive integer, then there is no need for a branch cut: one may define formula_80, or define positive integral complex powers through complex multiplication, and show that formula_81 for all complex formula_76, from the definition of the derivative and the binomial theorem.

However, due to the multivalued nature of complex power functions for non-integer exponents, one must be careful to specify the branch of the complex logarithm being used. In addition, no matter which branch is used, if formula_75 is not a positive integer, then the function is not differentiable at 0.

<doc id="147918" wikidata="Q1128980" url="?curid=147918" title="Industrial robot">
<text>An industrial robot is a robot system used for manufacturing. Industrial robots are automated, programmable and capable of movement on three or more axes.

Typical applications of robots include welding, painting, assembly, disassembly, pick and place for printed circuit boards, packaging and labeling, palletizing, product inspection, and testing; all accomplished with high endurance, speed, and precision. They can assist in material handling.

In the year 2023, an estimated 4,281,585 industrial robots were in operation worldwide according to International Federation of Robotics (IFR).

==Types and features==
There are six types of industrial robots.

=== Articulated robots ===

Articulated robots are the most common industrial robots. They look like a human arm, which is why they are also called robotic arm or manipulator arm. Their articulations with several degrees of freedom allow the articulated arms a wide range of movements.

=== Autonomous robot ===
An autonomous robot is a robot that acts without recourse to human control. The first autonomous robots environment were known as Elmer and Elsie, which were constructed in the late 1940s by W. Grey Walter. They were the first robots in history that were programmed to &quot;think&quot; the way biological brains do and meant to have free will. Elmer and Elsie were often labeled as tortoises because of how they were shaped and the manner in which they moved. They were capable of phototaxis which is the movement that occurs in response to light stimulus.

=== Cartesian coordinate robots ===

Cartesian robots, also called rectilinear, gantry robots, and x-y-z robots have three prismatic joints for the movement of the tool and three rotary joints for its orientation in space.

To be able to move and orient the effector organ in all directions, such a robot needs 6 axes (or degrees of freedom). In a 2-dimensional environment, three axes are sufficient, two for displacement and one for orientation.

=== Cylindrical coordinate robots ===
The cylindrical coordinate robots are characterized by their rotary joint at the base and at least one prismatic joint connecting its links. They can move vertically and horizontally by sliding. The compact effector design allows the robot to reach tight work-spaces without any loss of speed.

=== Spherical coordinate robots ===
Spherical coordinate robots only have rotary joints. They are one of the first robots to have been used in industrial applications. They are commonly used for machine tending in die-casting, plastic injection and extrusion, and for welding.

=== SCARA robots ===

SCARA is an acronym for Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm. SCARA robots are recognized by their two parallel joints which provide movement in the X-Y plane. Rotating shafts are positioned vertically at the effector. SCARA robots are used for jobs that require precise lateral movements. They are ideal for assembly applications.

=== Delta robots ===

Delta robots are also referred to as parallel link robots. They consist of parallel links connected to a common base. Delta robots are particularly useful for direct control tasks and high maneuvering operations (such as quick pick-and-place tasks). Delta robots take advantage of four bar or parallelogram linkage systems.

Furthermore, industrial robots can have a serial or parallel architecture.

=== Serial manipulators ===

Serial architectures a.k.a. serial manipulators are very common industrial robots; they are designed as a series of links connected by motor-actuated joints that extend from a base to an end-effector. SCARA, Stanford manipulators are typical examples of this category.

=== Parallel architecture ===
A parallel manipulator is designed so that each chain is usually short, simple and can thus be rigid against unwanted movement, compared to a serial manipulator. Errors in one chain&#x27;s positioning are averaged in conjunction with the others, rather than being cumulative. Each actuator must still move within its own degree of freedom, as for a serial robot; however in the parallel robot the off-axis flexibility of a joint is also constrained by the effect of the other chains. It is this closed-loop stiffness that makes the overall parallel manipulator stiff relative to its components, unlike the serial chain that becomes progressively less rigid with more components.

== Lower mobility parallel manipulators and concomitant motion ==
A full parallel manipulator can move an object with up to 6 degrees of freedom (DoF), determined by 3 translation &quot;3T&quot; and 3 rotation &quot;3R&quot; coordinates for full &quot;3T3R m&quot;obility. However, when a manipulation task requires less than 6 DoF, the use of lower mobility manipulators, with fewer than 6 DoF, may bring advantages in terms of simpler architecture, easier control, faster motion and lower cost. For example, the 3 DoF Delta robot has lower &quot;3T&quot; mobility and has proven to be very successful for rapid pick-and-place translational positioning applications. The workspace of lower mobility manipulators may be decomposed into &#x27;motion&#x27; and &#x27;constraint&#x27; subspaces. For example, 3 position coordinates constitute the motion subspace of the 3 DoF Delta robot and the 3 orientation coordinates are in the constraint subspace. The motion subspace of lower mobility manipulators may be further decomposed into independent (desired) and dependent (concomitant) subspaces: consisting of &#x27;concomitant&#x27; or &#x27;parasitic&#x27; motion which is undesired motion of the manipulator. The debilitating effects of concomitant motion should be mitigated or eliminated in the successful design of lower mobility manipulators. For example, the Delta robot does not have parasitic motion since its end effector does not rotate.

== Autonomy ==
Robots exhibit varying degrees of autonomy. 
Some robots are programmed to faithfully carry out specific actions over and over again (repetitive actions) without variation and with a high degree of accuracy. These actions are determined by programmed routines that specify the direction, acceleration, velocity, deceleration, and distance of a series of coordinated motions

Other robots are much more flexible as to the orientation of the object on which they are operating or even the task that has to be performed on the object itself, which the robot may even need to identify. For example, for more precise guidance, robots often contain machine vision sub-systems acting as their visual sensors, linked to powerful computers or controllers. Artificial intelligence is becoming an increasingly important factor in the modern industrial robot.

== History ==
The earliest known industrial robot, conforming to the ISO definition was completed by 
&quot;Bill&quot; Griffith P. Taylor in 1937 and published in Meccano Magazine, March 1938. The crane-like device was built almost entirely using Meccano parts, and powered by a single electric motor. Five axes of movement were possible, including &quot;grab&quot; and &quot;grab rotation&quot;. Automation was achieved using punched paper tape to energise solenoids, which would facilitate the movement of the crane&#x27;s control levers. The robot could stack wooden blocks in pre-programmed patterns. The number of motor revolutions required for each desired movement was first plotted on graph paper. This information was then transferred to the paper tape, which was also driven by the robot&#x27;s single motor. Chris Shute built a complete replica of the robot in 1997.
George Devol applied for the first robotics patents in 1954 (granted in 1961). The first company to produce a robot was Unimation, founded by Devol and Joseph F. Engelberger in 1956. Unimation robots were also called &quot;programmable transfer machines&quot; since their main use at first was to transfer objects from one point to another, less than a dozen feet or so apart. They used hydraulic actuators and were programmed in &quot;joint coordinates&quot;, i.e. the angles of the various joints were stored during a teaching phase and replayed in operation. They were accurate to within 1/10,000 of an inch (note: although accuracy is not an appropriate measure for robots, usually evaluated in terms of repeatability - see later). Unimation later licensed their technology to Kawasaki Heavy Industries and GKN, manufacturing Unimates in Japan and England respectively. For some time, Unimation&#x27;s only competitor was Cincinnati Milacron Inc. of Ohio. This changed radically in the late 1970s when several big Japanese conglomerates began producing similar industrial robots.

In 1969 Victor Scheinman at Stanford University invented the Stanford arm, an all-electric, 6-axis articulated robot designed to permit an arm solution. This allowed it accurately to follow arbitrary paths in space and widened the potential use of the robot to more sophisticated applications such as assembly and welding. Scheinman then designed a second arm for the MIT AI Lab, called the &quot;MIT arm.&quot; Scheinman, after receiving a fellowship from Unimation to develop his designs, sold those designs to Unimation who further developed them with support from General Motors and later marketed it as the Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly (PUMA).

Industrial robotics took off quite quickly in Europe, with both ABB Robotics and KUKA Robotics bringing robots to the market in 1973. ABB Robotics (formerly ASEA) introduced IRB 6, among the world&#x27;s first &quot;commercially available&quot; all electric micro-processor controlled robot. The first two IRB 6 robots were sold to Magnusson in Sweden for grinding and polishing pipe bends and were installed in production in January 1974. Also in 1973 KUKA Robotics built its first robot, known as FAMULUS, also one of the first articulated robots to have six electromechanically driven axes.

Interest in robotics increased in the late 1970s and many US companies entered the field, including large firms like General Electric, and General Motors (which formed joint venture FANUC Robotics with FANUC LTD of Japan). U.S. startup companies included Automatix and Adept Technology, Inc. At the height of the robot boom in 1984, Unimation was acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corporation for 107 million U.S. dollars. Westinghouse sold Unimation to Stäubli Faverges SCA of France in 1988, which is still making articulated robots for general industrial and cleanroom applications and even bought the robotic division of Bosch in late 2004.

Only a few non-Japanese companies ultimately managed to survive in this market, the major ones being: Adept Technology, Stäubli, the Swedish-Swiss company ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the German company KUKA Robotics and the Italian company Comau.

==Technical description==

===Defining parameters===
*&quot;Number of axes&quot; – two axes are required to reach any point in a plane; three axes are required to reach any point in space. To fully control the orientation of the end of the arm(i.e. the &quot;wrist&quot;) three more axes (yaw, pitch, and roll) are required. Some designs (e.g. the SCARA robot) trade limitations in motion possibilities for cost, speed, and accuracy.
*&quot;Degrees of freedom&quot; – this is usually the same as the number of axes.
*&quot;Working envelope&quot; – the region of space a robot can reach.
*&quot;Kinematics&quot; – the actual arrangement of rigid members and joints in the robot, which determines the robot&#x27;s possible motions. Classes of robot kinematics include articulated, cartesian, parallel and SCARA.
*&quot;Carrying capacity or payload&quot; – how much weight a robot can lift.
*&quot;Speed&quot; – how fast the robot can position the end of its arm. This may be defined in terms of the angular or linear speed of each axis or as a compound speed i.e. the speed of the end of the arm when all axes are moving.
*&quot;Acceleration&quot; – how quickly an axis can accelerate. Since this is a limiting factor a robot may not be able to reach its specified maximum speed for movements over a short distance or a complex path requiring frequent changes of direction.
*&quot;Accuracy&quot; – how closely a robot can reach a commanded position. When the absolute position of the robot is measured and compared to the commanded position the error is a measure of accuracy. Accuracy can be improved with external sensing for example a vision system or Infra-Red. See robot calibration. Accuracy can vary with speed and position within the working envelope and with payload (see compliance).
*&quot;Repeatability&quot; – how well the robot will return to a programmed position. This is not the same as accuracy. It may be that when told to go to a certain X-Y-Z position that it gets only to within 1 mm of that position. This would be its accuracy which may be improved by calibration. But if that position is taught into controller memory and each time it is sent there it returns to within 0.1mm of the taught position then the repeatability will be within 0.1mm.
Accuracy and repeatability are different measures. Repeatability is usually the most important criterion for a robot and is similar to the concept of &#x27;precision&#x27; in measurement—see accuracy and precision. ISO 9283 sets out a method whereby both accuracy and repeatability can be measured. Typically a robot is sent to a taught position a number of times and the error is measured at each return to the position after visiting 4 other positions. Repeatability is then quantified using the standard deviation of those samples in all three dimensions. A typical robot can, of course make a positional error exceeding that and that could be a problem for the process. Moreover, the repeatability is different in different parts of the working envelope and also changes with speed and payload. ISO 9283 specifies that accuracy and repeatability should be measured at maximum speed and at maximum payload. But this results in pessimistic values whereas the robot could be much more accurate and repeatable at light loads and speeds.
Repeatability in an industrial process is also subject to the accuracy of the end effector, for example a gripper, and even to the design of the &#x27;fingers&#x27; that match the gripper to the object being grasped. For example, if a robot picks a screw by its head, the screw could be at a random angle. A subsequent attempt to insert the screw into a hole could easily fail. These and similar scenarios can be improved with &#x27;lead-ins&#x27; e.g. by making the entrance to the hole tapered.
*&quot;Motion control&quot; – for some applications, such as simple pick-and-place assembly, the robot need merely return repeatably to a limited number of pre-taught positions. For more sophisticated applications, such as welding and finishing (spray painting), motion must be continuously controlled to follow a path in space, with controlled orientation and velocity.
*&quot;Power source&quot; – some robots use electric motors, others use hydraulic actuators. The former are faster, the latter are stronger and advantageous in applications such as spray painting, where a spark could set off an explosion; however, low internal air-pressurisation of the arm can prevent ingress of flammable vapours as well as other contaminants. Nowadays, it is highly unlikely to see any hydraulic robots in the market. Additional sealings, brushless electric motors and spark-proof protection eased the construction of units that are able to work in the environment with an explosive atmosphere. 
*&quot;Drive&quot; – some robots connect electric motors to the joints via gears; others connect the motor to the joint directly (&quot;direct drive&quot;). Using gears results in measurable &#x27;backlash&#x27; which is free movement in an axis. Smaller robot arms frequently employ high speed, low torque DC motors, which generally require high gearing ratios; this has the disadvantage of backlash. In such cases the harmonic drive is often used.
*&quot;Compliance&quot; - this is a measure of the amount in angle or distance that a robot axis will move when a force is applied to it. Because of compliance when a robot goes to a position carrying its maximum payload it will be at a position slightly lower than when it is carrying no payload. Compliance can also be responsible for overshoot when carrying high payloads in which case acceleration would need to be reduced.

===Robot programming and interfaces===

The setup or programming of motions and sequences for an industrial robot is typically taught by linking the robot controller to a laptop, desktop computer or (internal or Internet) network.

A robot and a collection of machines or peripherals is referred to as a workcell, or cell. A typical cell might contain a parts feeder, a molding machine and a robot. The various machines are &#x27;integrated&#x27; and controlled by a single computer or PLC. How the robot interacts with other machines in the cell must be programmed, both with regard to their positions in the cell and synchronizing with them.

&quot;Software:&quot; The computer is installed with corresponding interface software. The use of a computer greatly simplifies the programming process. Specialized robot software is run either in the robot controller or in the computer or both depending on the system design.

There are two basic entities that need to be taught (or programmed): positional data and procedure. For example, in a task to move a screw from a feeder to a hole the positions of the feeder and the hole must first be taught or programmed. Secondly the procedure to get the screw from the feeder to the hole must be programmed along with any I/O involved, for example a signal to indicate when the screw is in the feeder ready to be picked up. The purpose of the robot software is to facilitate both these programming tasks.

Teaching the robot positions may be achieved a number of ways:

&quot;Positional commands&quot; The robot can be directed to the required position using a GUI or text based commands in which the required X-Y-Z position may be specified and edited.

&quot;Teach pendant:&quot; Robot positions can be taught via a teach pendant. This is a handheld control and programming unit. The common features of such units are the ability to manually send the robot to a desired position, or &quot;inch&quot; or &quot;jog&quot; to adjust a position. They also have a means to change the speed since a low speed is usually required for careful positioning, or while test-running through a new or modified routine. A large emergency stop button is usually included as well. Typically once the robot has been programmed there is no more use for the teach pendant. All teach pendants are equipped with a 3-position deadman switch. In the manual mode, it allows the robot to move only when it is in the middle position (partially pressed). If it is fully pressed in or completely released, the robot stops. This principle of operation allows natural reflexes to be used to increase safety.

&quot;Lead-by-the-nose:&quot; this is a technique offered by many robot manufacturers. In this method, one user holds the robot&#x27;s manipulator, while another person enters a command which de-energizes the robot causing it to go into limp. The user then moves the robot by hand to the required positions and/or along a required path while the software logs these positions into memory. The program can later run the robot to these positions or along the taught path. This technique is popular for tasks such as paint spraying.

&quot;Offline programming&quot; is where the entire cell, the robot and all the machines or instruments in the workspace are mapped graphically. The robot can then be moved on screen and the process simulated. A robotics simulator is used to create embedded applications for a robot, without depending on the physical operation of the robot arm and end effector. The advantages of robotics simulation is that it saves time in the design of robotics applications. It can also increase the level of safety associated with robotic equipment since various &quot;what if&quot; scenarios can be tried and tested before the system is activated.[8] Robot simulation software provides a platform to teach, test, run, and debug programs that have been written in a variety of programming languages. 

&quot;Robot simulation&quot; tools allow for robotics programs to be conveniently written and debugged off-line with the final version of the program tested on an actual robot. The ability to preview the behavior of a robotic system in a virtual world allows for a variety of mechanisms, devices, configurations and controllers to be tried and tested before being applied to a &quot;real world&quot; system. Robotics simulators have the ability to provide real-time computing of the simulated motion of an industrial robot using both geometric modeling and kinematics modeling.

&quot;Manufacturing independent robot programming tools&quot; are a relatively new but flexible way to program robot applications. Using a visual programming language, the programming is done via drag and drop of predefined template/building blocks. They often feature the execution of simulations to evaluate the feasibility and offline programming in combination. If the system is able to compile and upload native robot code to the robot controller, the user no longer has to learn each manufacturer&#x27;s proprietary language. Therefore, this approach can be an important step to standardize programming methods.

&quot;Others&quot; in addition, machine operators often use user interface devices, typically touchscreen units, which serve as the operator control panel. The operator can switch from program to program, make adjustments within a program and also operate a host of peripheral devices that may be integrated within the same robotic system. These include end effectors, feeders that supply components to the robot, conveyor belts, emergency stop controls, machine vision systems, safety interlock systems, barcode printers and an almost infinite array of other industrial devices which are accessed and controlled via the operator control panel.

The teach pendant or PC is usually disconnected after programming and the robot then runs on the program that has been installed in its controller. However a computer is often used to &#x27;supervise&#x27; the robot and any peripherals, or to provide additional storage for access to numerous complex paths and routines.

===End-of-arm tooling===
The most essential robot peripheral is the end effector, or end-of-arm-tooling (EOAT). Common examples of end effectors include welding devices (such as MIG-welding guns, spot-welders, etc.), spray guns and also grinding and deburring devices (such as pneumatic disk or belt grinders, burrs, etc.), and grippers (devices that can grasp an object, usually electromechanical or pneumatic). Other common means of picking up objects is by vacuum or magnets. End effectors are frequently highly complex, made to match the handled product and often capable of picking up an array of products at one time. They may utilize various sensors to aid the robot system in locating, handling, and positioning products.

===Controlling movement===
For a given robot the only parameters necessary to completely locate the end effector (gripper, welding torch, etc.) of the robot are the angles of each of the joints or displacements of the linear axes (or combinations of the two for robot formats such as SCARA). However, there are many different ways to define the points. The most common and most convenient way of defining a point is to specify a Cartesian coordinate for it, i.e. the position of the &#x27;end effector&#x27; in mm in the X, Y and Z directions relative to the robot&#x27;s origin. In addition, depending on the types of joints a particular robot may have, the orientation of the end effector in yaw, pitch, and roll and the location of the tool point relative to the robot&#x27;s faceplate must also be specified. For a jointed arm these coordinates must be converted to joint angles by the robot controller and such conversions are known as Cartesian Transformations which may need to be performed iteratively or recursively for a multiple axis robot. The mathematics of the relationship between joint angles and actual spatial coordinates is called kinematics. See robot control

Positioning by Cartesian coordinates may be done by entering the coordinates into the system or by using a teach pendant which moves the robot in X-Y-Z directions. It is much easier for a human operator to visualize motions up/down, left/right, etc. than to move each joint one at a time. When the desired position is reached it is then defined in some way particular to the robot software in use, e.g. P1 - P5 below.

===Typical programming===
Most articulated robots perform by storing a series of positions in memory, and moving to them at various times in their programming sequence. For example, a robot which is moving items from one place (bin A) to another (bin B) might have a simple &#x27;pick and place&#x27; program similar to the following:

&quot;Define points P1–P5:&quot;

# Safely above workpiece (defined as P1)
# 10 cm Above bin A (defined as P2)
# At position to take part from bin A (defined as P3)
# 10 cm Above bin B (defined as P4)
# At position to take part from bin B. (defined as P5)

&quot;Define program:&quot;

# Move to P1
# Move to P2
# Move to P3
# Close gripper
# Move to P2
# Move to P4
# Move to P5
# Open gripper
# Move to P4
# Move to P1 and finish

For examples of how this would look in popular robot languages see industrial robot programming.

===Singularities===

The American National Standard for Industrial Robots and Robot Systems — Safety Requirements (ANSI/RIA R15.06-1999) defines a singularity as &quot;a condition caused by the collinear alignment of two or more robot axes resulting in unpredictable robot motion and velocities.&quot; It is most common in robot arms that utilize a &quot;triple-roll wrist&quot;. This is a wrist about which the three axes of the wrist, controlling yaw, pitch, and roll, all pass through a common point. An example of a wrist singularity is when the path through which the robot is traveling causes the first and third axes of the robot&#x27;s wrist (i.e. robot&#x27;s axes 4 and 6) to line up. The second wrist axis then attempts to spin 180° in zero time to maintain the orientation of the end effector. Another common term for this singularity is a &quot;wrist flip&quot;. The result of a singularity can be quite dramatic and can have adverse effects on the robot arm, the end effector, and the process. Some industrial robot manufacturers have attempted to side-step the situation by slightly altering the robot&#x27;s path to prevent this condition. Another method is to slow the robot&#x27;s travel speed, thus reducing the speed required for the wrist to make the transition. The ANSI/RIA has mandated that robot manufacturers shall make the user aware of singularities if they occur while the system is being manually manipulated.

A second type of singularity in wrist-partitioned vertically articulated six-axis robots occurs when the wrist center lies on a cylinder that is centered about axis 1 and with radius equal to the distance between axes 1 and 4. This is called a shoulder singularity. Some robot manufacturers also mention alignment singularities, where axes 1 and 6 become coincident. This is simply a sub-case of shoulder singularities. When the robot passes close to a shoulder singularity, joint 1 spins very fast.

The third and last type of singularity in wrist-partitioned vertically articulated six-axis robots occurs when the wrist&#x27;s center lies in the same plane as axes 2 and 3.

Singularities are closely related to the phenomena of gimbal lock, which has a similar root cause of axes becoming lined up.

==Market structure==
According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) study &quot;World Robotics 2024&quot;, there were about 4,281,585 operational industrial robots by the end of 2023. For the year 2018 the IFR estimates the worldwide sales of industrial robots with US$16.5 billion. Including the cost of software, peripherals and systems engineering, the annual turnover for robot systems is estimated to be US$48.0 billion in 2018.

China is the largest industrial robot market with 154,032 units sold in 2018. China had the largest operational stock of industrial robots, with 649,447 at the end of 2018. The United States industrial robot-makers shipped 35,880 robot to factories in the US in 2018 and this was 7% more than in 2017.

The biggest customer of industrial robots is automotive industry with 30% market share, then electrical/electronics industry with 25%, metal and machinery industry with 10%, rubber and plastics industry with 5%, food industry with 5%. In textiles, apparel and leather industry, 1,580 units are operational.

Estimated worldwide annual supply of industrial robots (in units):
== Health and safety ==
The International Federation of Robotics has predicted a worldwide increase in adoption of industrial robots and they estimated 1.7 million new robot installations in factories worldwide by 2020 [IFR 2017] . Rapid advances in automation technologies (e.g. fixed robots, collaborative and mobile robots, and exoskeletons) have the potential to improve work conditions but also to introduce workplace hazards in manufacturing workplaces. Despite the lack of occupational surveillance data on injuries associated specifically with robots, researchers from the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) identified 61 robot-related deaths between 1992 and 2015 using keyword searches of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries research database (see info from Center for Occupational Robotics Research). Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, NIOSH and its state partners have investigated 4 robot-related fatalities under the Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation Program. In addition the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has investigated dozens of robot-related deaths and injuries, which can be reviewed at OSHA Accident Search page. Injuries and fatalities could increase over time because of the increasing number of collaborative and co-existing robots, powered exoskeletons, and autonomous vehicles into the work environment.

Safety standards are being developed by the Robotic Industries Association (RIA) in conjunction with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). On October 5, 2017, OSHA, NIOSH and RIA signed an alliance to work together to enhance technical expertise, identify and help address potential workplace hazards associated with traditional industrial robots and the emerging technology of human-robot collaboration installations and systems, and help identify needed research to reduce workplace hazards. On October 16 NIOSH launched the Center for Occupational Robotics Research to &quot;provide scientific leadership to guide the development and use of occupational robots that enhance worker safety, health, and wellbeing.&quot; So far, the research needs identified by NIOSH and its partners include: tracking and preventing injuries and fatalities, intervention and dissemination strategies to promote safe machine control and maintenance procedures, and on translating effective evidence-based interventions into workplace practice.

<doc id="147920" wikidata="Q942939" url="?curid=147920" title="Edmund Blackadder">
<text>Edmund Blackadder is the single name given to a collection of fictional characters who appear in the BBC mock-historical comedy series &quot;Blackadder&quot;, each played by Rowan Atkinson. Although each series is set within a different period of British history, all the Edmund Blackadders in the franchise are part of the same familial line. Each character also shares notable personality traits and characteristics throughout each incarnation. In a 2001 poll conducted by Channel 4, Edmund Blackadder was ranked third on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters.

== Common characteristics ==
Each Blackadder is positioned in a different place in British society over each series, with the character mostly falling in social rank through history. He moves from a prince (&quot;The Black Adder&quot;) to a lord (&quot;Blackadder II&quot;), a knight/baronet (&quot;&quot;), a royal attendant (&quot;Blackadder the Third&quot;), a shopkeeper (&quot;Blackadder&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, named Ebeneezer Blackadder), to an army captain (&quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;). Throughout each series, Blackadder is a self-serving, cynical opportunist concerned solely with increasing his own influence, status and wealth. His character is symbolised by the adder, the only venomous snake native to Great Britain, which sometimes appears in the series as a visual motif.

With the exception of the first Blackadder incarnation, Prince Edmund, each is generally cynical, charismatic and intelligent. While he is haunted by bad luck, he is usually very capable of manipulating his way out of a crisis and in securing for himself some degree of prestige and fortune. Blackadder is also usually one of the few intelligent people present at any given time and is usually surrounded by incompetent, slow-witted servants, equals and superiors. As a result, he possesses an acerbic wit and is usually prepared with numerous quick put-downs, which are often wasted on those at whom they are directed.

He is frequently present at some of the defining moments of British history, but usually views his contemporaries with unbridled contempt, regardless of their historical importance or interest. He is also generally dismissive of the contemporary arts and culture in the various eras in which he lives, such as medieval folk pageants, Shakespeare, Romanticist poetry, and Charlie Chaplin films.

Each Blackadder is also surrounded by various other figures who reappear over the series. These include his manservant Baldrick (Tony Robinson) and the various imbecilic aristocrats with whose company he is lumbered, such as Lord Percy Percy (Tim McInnerny) and George (Hugh Laurie).

==Main Blackadders==
In this section, brief descriptions of the various Edmund Blackadders who have appeared in their own series or in another notable &quot;Blackadder&quot; production are provided.

===Prince Edmund, Duke of Edinburgh/The Black Adder (Late Medieval England)===
Prince Edmund (1461–1498) is the first man in the dynasty to refer to himself as &quot;The Black Adder&quot;, a suggestion of the first Baldrick. He appears in the first series, set shortly after The Wars of the Roses. He is the second son of the fictional King Richard IV of England (Brian Blessed), who, it is claimed at the beginning, was cast from all historical references by his successor, Henry Tudor (Peter Benson). Prince Edmund is a very different character from his descendants: he is slow-witted, cowardly, and the butt of the other characters&#x27; jokes. While he is as devious and amoral as his descendants, his Machiavellian schemes are usually spurred on by other characters. For all this he is determined and driven to power: his primary concern is to seize the English throne and become the king himself. After the death of Richard IV and Edmund&#x27;s older brother Harry (Robert East), he is briefly King of England; a lyric from one of the closing credits for &quot;Black Adder II&quot; describes him as &quot;a king / Although for only thirty seconds&quot;. Prince Edmund is one of the many Blackadders to be killed on screen: he dies after accidentally drinking poisoned wine, although he had already been severely mutilated by his childhood nemesis, the Duke of Burgundy (Patrick Allen).

===Edmund, Lord Blackadder (Elizabethan England)===

Edmund, Lord Blackadder, is the next-seen member of the dynasty, appearing in Elizabethan England. He is the central character of &quot;Black Adder II&quot; and is a nobleman in the court of Elizabeth I of England. Although his &quot;great-grandfather&quot; was Prince Edmund, he is much more intelligent, charismatic, acerbic, handsome and respected than his ancestor. Despite that fact, Edmund&#x27;s aristocratic title has lowered; he is now simply a lord, rather than a prince. His main concerns are pleasing his Queen (Miranda Richardson), a childish, spoiled tyrant who usually threatens to execute anyone who displeases her, usually by decapitation, and in outwitting his various contemporary rivals, usually in the form of Lord Melchett (Stephen Fry), for her favour. At the end of &quot;Blackadder II&quot;, specifically the final episode, &quot;Chains&quot;, Blackadder and Melchett are captured by two guards on the orders of the psychopathic Prince Ludwig the Indestructible of Germany (Hugh Laurie) who Blackadder had met in the past while Ludwig was disguised as a waitress named &quot;Big Sally&quot;. The two men are confined to a dungeon with Ludwig giving Queenie a week to decide who she will rescue. When Queenie ignores the two of them in favour of holding a big costume party, Blackadder and Melchett work together to outwit the two guards after Ludwig has departed to infiltrate the palace, arriving in time to expose Ludwig, who then attempts to flee, prompting Blackadder to throw a dagger at Ludwig that presumably either kills him or leaves him badly wounded. However, after the end credits have aired, it is shown that Ludwig has returned and murdered Blackadder, the real Queenie, Melchett, Nursie, Percy and Baldrick. Ludwig then poses as Queenie after the assassination.

The character shift from Prince Edmund in the first series to Lord Blackadder in the second is credited to the involvement of Ben Elton, who joined as the show&#x27;s co-writer alongside Richard Curtis. The latter Edmund became the &quot;de facto&quot; archetype; nearly all subsequent Blackadders in the series were modelled after Edmund, Lord Blackadder - the exception being Ebenezer Blackadder, who initially began as the nicest man in England to the point of naivete but who gradually fell back into the standard persona after being abused by almost everyone around him.

===Sir Edmund Blackadder (English Civil War)===
Sir Edmund Blackadder appears in the Comic Relief special &quot;&quot;; with the honorific of &quot;Sir&quot;, this Blackadder is either a Baronet or a Knight. Set during the English Civil War, Sir Edmund is (apparently) a loyal royalist and friend of Charles I, played by Stephen Fry. This Blackadder also appeared in an introductory sequence for Charles, Prince of Wales&#x27; fiftieth birthday Gala Performance, in which he was supposedly organising a birthday show for Charles II (also Fry).

===Edmund Blackadder Esq. (Regency Britain)===
Edmund Blackadder, Esq., is the Blackadder appearing in the Regency period of British history. His family having fallen on hard times, he is reduced to a life of servitude, a fall made even more insufferable by his position as butler to the oafish and uncouth George (Laurie), the Prince Regent. Despite this, he remains very intelligent (by far sharper than most of the people he associates with), and is usually found stealing from his employer. This Blackadder is the one who is most in control of his own affairs, so he is able to be more arrogantly confident than other Blackadders. This Blackadder is the only one of the main four incarnations not to be killed onscreen (the first one accidentally poisoned himself, the second was murdered, whilst the fourth is presumed to have died in battle). While history records this version of Blackadder as having been shot dead by the Duke of Wellington (Fry), in actuality Prince George was masquerading as Blackadder and vice versa, which results in Blackadder assuming the Prince Regent&#x27;s identity and later becoming King George IV.

===Mr. Ebenezer Blackadder (Victorian London)===
Mr. Ebenezer Blackadder, the Victorian Blackadder, appears in &quot;Blackadder&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;. Unlike his cold-hearted, cynical ancestors and the Dickens character Ebenezer Scrooge he is a parody of, he is by repute the nicest man in Victorian England. Unfortunately, this only serves to make him a target for the cynical crooks and cheats he is surrounded by, and a &quot;Christmas Carol&quot;-like encounter with the &quot;Ghost of Christmas&quot; sees him greatly inspired by his snide-yet-triumphant ancestors; he learns that if he reverts to their ways his descendants will rule the universe, otherwise they will end up as Baldrick&#x27;s slaves in the same time period. Upon the departure of the Ghost, Blackadder renounces his compassion and reverts to type on the spot.

===Captain Edmund Blackadder (World War I)===

Captain Edmund Blackadder appears in &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;, set during World War I. A long-time soldier, early in his career Blackadder was &quot;The Hero of Umboto Gorge&quot;, a fictional battle that took place in French Sudan in 1892, during which he saved the life of Douglas Haig. He also served in the 1898 Mahdist War and makes reference to having spent most of his career away from Britain.

Prior to the outbreak of World War I, Blackadder found life in the British Army agreeable, as he had enjoyed a relatively danger-free existence. His main responsibility was to maintain the British Empire, or as he personally put it: fighting natives who were usually &quot;two feet tall and armed with dried grass.&quot; However, in World War I, Blackadder is astute to the gravity and slaughter of trench warfare, and unlike his superior officers, realises that the earlier colonial battles produced wildly unrealistic expectations about future conflict. Characteristically reluctant to meet his end in the mud of the trenches of the Western Front, Blackadder&#x27;s sole goal is to escape his inevitable fate. His attempts to escape are thwarted by the idiotic General Melchett (Fry), and Melchett&#x27;s assistant Captain Kevin Darling (McInnerny), Blackadder&#x27;s nemesis.

Blackadder shares his trench with Private S. Baldrick (Robinson), and Lt. The Hon. George Colthurst St Barleigh (Laurie). Also shown from afar is Douglas Haig (Geoffrey Palmer), whom Blackadder had previously saved from death.

In the series finale, &quot;Goodbyeee&quot;, Captain Blackadder and his company are sent &quot;over the top&quot; in an offensive. After trying and failing to get out of the battle, Blackadder&#x27;s company charges into machine gun fire, before the scene fades to a field of poppies with only birdsong to be heard, leaving the fate of the company ambiguous.

In the alternative ending of the finale, it is shown that Blackadder survives by pretending to be dead, after the entire company perishes, and diving back to the trench for safety, surviving the war.

====Awards and decorations====
In the series, Captain Blackadder is seen wearing the following ribbons:

===Lord Edmund Blackadder / King Edmund III (Turn-of-the-Millennium)===
In &quot;&quot;, Lord Edmund Blackadder is the modern representative of the Blackadder family. He intends to play a turn-of-the-millennium-prank on his friends by claiming that he has a time machine – only to be unpleasantly surprised that the device that Baldrick has actually built (following Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s instructions to the letter, except for marking values on the instrument display) actually &quot;is&quot; a working time machine. He manages to alter time by:
# Beating up William Shakespeare (Colin Firth) and telling him that his plays are just people &quot;wearing stupid tights&quot; who are &quot;talking total crap&quot;. When Blackadder also leaves his ballpoint pen behind, he causes Shakespeare to be viewed by history not as the great playwright, but as the pen&#x27;s &quot;inventor&quot;. 
# Convincing Robin Hood&#x27;s (Rik Mayall) men that robbing from the rich is fine, but giving to the poor makes them look like complete lunatics, causing them to shoot Robin full of arrows.
# Causing the time machine to land on top of the Duke of Wellington (Fry) during the Battle of Waterloo, allowing Napoleon Bonaparte to win the battle and conquer the United Kingdom.

He restores history but then has the idea of changing history in his favour. In the present day, a news report shows the popular King Edmund III and his queen, Marian of Sherwood (Kate Moss), being greeted by the prime minister, Baldrick. With Baldrick working as his prime minister and Parliament dissolved, the Blackadder and Baldrick families have finally triumphed and become rulers of the UK.

==Other Blackadders==
Although not appearing within their own series or one-off special, various other Blackadders have appeared or been alluded to over the course of the series.

Several relatives of the Blackadder family include the Puritan Whiteadders, and the Highlander clan of MacAdder. Various one-off specials have introduced other Blackadders throughout history, from the Roman Centurion Blaccadicus, to a Grand Admiral Blackadder in the distant future who becomes ruler of the universe.

At the 2000 Royal Variety Performance, Atkinson performed a short monologue called &quot;Blackadder: The Army Years&quot; as Captain Lord Edmund Blackadder of Her Majesty&#x27;s Royal Regiment of Shirkers. It is possible that Captain Lord Blackadder is the same modern-day Lord Blackadder seen in &quot;Back and Forth&quot;, although no mention of military rank is made there.

In 2002, during the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, trailers for the Party at the Palace featured the Keeper of Her Majesty&#x27;s Lawn Sprinklers, Sir Osmond Darling-Blackadder, who was against the idea. Sir Osmond also co-hosted the light-hearted documentary on the celebrations &quot;Jubilee Girl&quot;. He is notable for being one of the few members of the family not to be named Edmund, and also for his double-barrelled name, suggesting a family connection to Kevin Darling.

At the 2012 charity event &quot;We Are Most Amused&quot;, Atkinson appeared in a sketch parodying the then current banking crisis as Sir Edmund Blackadder, CEO of the Melchett, Melchett and Darling Bank.

In the Blackadder script book &quot;The Whole Damn Dynasty&quot;, a number of Blackadders are mentioned, beginning with a druid by the name of Edmun, who is later succeeded by the Duc d&#x27;Blackadder, who is believed to have been the man who shot Harold II at The Battle of Hastings.

==Historicity==
Blackadder is a genuine surname, its usage in the UK currently documented back to the 15th century, which may explain the choice of the name, with the first series being set in this time period. The name is thought to be mostly Scottish in origin, which is not contradicted in the series, as the first Blackadder begins as the Duke of Edinburgh. However, the Scottish name means &quot;black water&quot; and the first series clearly links the name to the snake. (There is footage of a black snake in the opening credits.) In the third series, it is revealed that a branch of the Blackadder family is a significant clan in Scotland, although they have become known by the name MacAdder. There is a Clan Blackadder in reality. The late Dr Eric Blackadder, Chief Medical Officer at the BBC at the time of the first programme, made the unlikely claim that the series is named after him.

Among historical members of the Clan, in 1502, Robert Blackadder Archbishop of Glasgow presided over a botched ceremony where James IV of Scotland swore to keep perpetual peace with England. At the first attempt, the King read his oath from a paper where &quot;France&quot; was written instead of &quot;England.&quot;

George Buchanan mentions an Edmund Blackadder in his 1582 &quot;Rerum Scoticarum Historia&quot;, writing that Mary, Queen of Scots embarked on a boat at Leith to sail to Alloa Tower in June 1566, crewed by &quot;William and Edmond Blackadder, Edward Robertson and Thomas Dickson, all Bothwell&#x27;s vassals and notorious pirates.&quot; In 1567, her husband Lord Darnley was assassinated in mysterious circumstances after an explosion in Edinburgh. This Captain William Blackadder was one of the first upon the scene and taken to be one of the conspirators. He was accused, scapegoated for the murder, and executed by being hanged, drawn and quartered, with each of his four limbs being sent to a different Scottish city to be put on display. Later, it was said that he had only appeared on the street after hearing the explosion while drinking in a tavern at the Tron on the Royal Mile. Edmund Blackadder was at the battle of Carberry Hill in June 1567, and was one of the first to abandon the Queen and ride away.

A Major General Charles Blackader served in the British army during the First World War, commanding an Indian colonial brigade and the 38th (Welsh) Division on the Western Front, and a territorial brigade in Dublin during the Easter Rising of 1916.

The name &quot;Baldrick&quot; is also authentic – but much rarer – and has been dated in Britain back to the Norman Conquest of 1066. This name is Germanic in origin.

<doc id="147921" wikidata="Q865664" url="?curid=147921" title="Lucasian Professor of Mathematics">
<text>The Lucasian Chair of Mathematics () is a mathematics professorship in the University of Cambridge, England; its holder is known as the Lucasian Professor. The post was founded in 1663 by Henry Lucas, who was Cambridge University&#x27;s Member of Parliament in 1639–1640, and it was officially established by King Charles II on 18 January 1664. It has been called the most celebrated professorship in the world, and the most famous academic chair in the world due to the prestige of many of its holders, and the groundbreaking work done by them. It was said by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; to be one of the most prestigious academic posts in the world. Since its establishment, the professorship has been held by, among others, Isaac Newton, Charles Babbage, George Stokes, Joseph Larmor, Paul Dirac, and Stephen Hawking.

==History==
Henry Lucas, in his will, bequeathed his library of 4,000 volumes to the university and left instructions for the purchase of land whose yielding should provide £100 a year for the founding of a professorship.

It is the third oldest chair of mathematics in Great Britain, after the Gresham Professor of Geometry at Gresham College and the Savilian Professor of Geometry at the University of Oxford. 

In the 1800s and following decades, the Lucasian professors &quot;played important roles in making Britain the preeminent scientific state and in changing the university from a ‘gentleman’s club’ to a research institution.&quot;

Babbage applied for the vacancy in 1826, after Turton, but Airy was appointed. William Whewell (who considered applying, but preferred both Herschel and Babbage to himself) remarked that he would be the best professor, but that the heads of the colleges would not see that. Nonetheless, Babbage was appointed when the chair became free again two years later.

The current (19th) Lucasian Professor is Michael Cates, starting from 1 July 2015.
The previous holder of the post was theoretical physicist Michael Green who was a fellow in Clare Hall. He was appointed in October 2009, succeeding Stephen Hawking, who himself retired in September 2009, in the year of his 67th birthday, as required by the university. Green holds the position of Emeritus Lucasian Professor of Mathematics.

==Cultural references==
In the final episode of the science-fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, one of the main characters, the android Data, holds the Lucasian Chair in the late 24th century, albeit in an alternate reality.

<text>A syringe is a simple reciprocating pump consisting of a plunger (though in modern syringes, it is actually a piston) that fits tightly within a cylindrical tube called a barrel. The plunger can be linearly pulled and pushed along the inside of the tube, allowing the syringe to take in and expel liquid or gas through a discharge orifice at the front (open) end of the tube. The open end of the syringe may be fitted with a hypodermic needle, a nozzle or tubing to direct the flow into and out of the barrel. Syringes are frequently used in clinical medicine to administer injections, infuse intravenous therapy into the bloodstream, apply compounds such as glue or lubricant, and draw/measure liquids. There are also prefilled syringes (disposable syringes marketed with liquid inside).

The word &quot;syringe&quot; is derived from the Greek σῦριγξ (&quot;syrinx&quot;, meaning &quot;Pan flute&quot;, &quot;tube&quot;).

==Medical syringes==

Medical syringes include disposable and safety syringes, injection pens, needleless injectors, insulin pumps, and specialty needles. Hypodermic syringes are used with hypodermic needles to inject liquid or gases into body tissues, or to remove from the body. Injecting of air into a blood vessel is hazardous, as it may cause an air embolism; preventing embolisms by removing air from the syringe is one of the reasons for the familiar image of holding a hypodermic syringe pointing upward, tapping it, and expelling a small amount of liquid before an injection into the bloodstream.

The barrel of a syringe is made of plastic or glass, usually has graduated marks indicating the volume of fluid in the syringe, and is nearly always transparent. Glass syringes may be sterilized in an autoclave. Plastic syringes can be constructed as either two-part or three-part designs. A three-part syringe contains a plastic plunger/piston with a rubber tip to create a seal between the piston and the barrel, where a two-part syringe is manufactured to create a perfect fit between the plastic plunger and the barrel to create the seal without the need for a separate synthetic rubber piston. Two-part syringes have been traditionally used in European countries to prevent introduction of additional materials such as silicone oil needed for lubricating three-part plungers. Most modern medical syringes are plastic because they are cheap enough to dispose of after being used only once, reducing the risk of spreading blood-borne diseases. Reuse of needles and syringes has caused spread of diseases, especially HIV and hepatitis, among intravenous drug users. Syringes are also commonly reused by diabetics, as they can go through several in a day with multiple daily insulin injections, which becomes an affordability issue for many. Even though the syringe and needle are only used by a single person, this practice is still unsafe as it can introduce bacteria from the skin into the bloodstream and cause serious and sometimes lethal infections. In medical settings, single-use needles and syringes effectively reduce the risk of cross-contamination.

Medical syringes are sometimes used without a needle for orally administering liquid medicines to young children or animals, or milk to small young animals, because the dose can be measured accurately and it is easier to squirt the medicine into the subject&#x27;s mouth instead of coaxing the subject to drink out of a measuring spoon.

===Tip designs===
Syringes come with a number of designs for the area in which the blade locks to the syringe body. Perhaps the most well known of these is the Luer lock, which simply twists the two together.

Bodies featuring a small, plain connection are known as slip tips and are useful for when the syringe is being connected to something not featuring a screw lock mechanism.

Similar to this is the catheter tip, which is essentially a slip tip but longer and tapered, making it good for pushing into things where there the plastic taper can form a tight seal. These can also be used for rinsing out wounds or large abscesses in veterinary use.

There is also an eccentric tip, where the nozzle at the end of the syringe is not in the centre of the syringe but at the side. This causes the blade attached to the syringe to lie almost in line with the walls of the syringe itself and they are used when the blade needs to get very close to parallel with the skin (when injecting into a surface vein or artery for example).

===Standard U-100 insulin syringes===
Syringes for insulin users are designed for standard U-100 insulin. The dilution of insulin is such that 1 mL of insulin fluid has 100 standard &quot;units&quot; of insulin. A typical insulin vial may contain 10 mL, for 1000 units.

Insulin syringes are made specifically for a patient to inject themselves, and have features to assist this purpose when compared to a syringe for use by a healthcare professional:
*shorter needles, as insulin injections are subcutaneous (under the skin) rather than intramuscular,
*finer gauge needles, for less pain,
*markings in insulin units to simplify drawing a measured dose of insulin, and
*low dead space to reduce complications caused by improper drawing order of different insulin strengths.

===Multishot needle syringes===
There are needle syringes designed to reload from a built-in tank (container) after each injection, so they can make several or many injections on a filling. These are not used much in human medicine because of the risk of cross-infection via the needle. An exception is the personal insulin autoinjector used by diabetic patients and in dual-chambered syringe designs intended to deliver a prefilled saline flush solution after the medication.

===Venom extraction syringes===
Venom extraction syringes are different from standard syringes, because they usually do not puncture the wound. The most common types have a plastic nozzle which is placed over the affected area, and then the syringe piston is pulled back, creating a vacuum that allegedly sucks out the venom. Attempts to treat snakebites in this way are specifically advised against, as they are ineffective and can cause additional injury.

Syringes of this type are sometimes used for extracting human botfly larvae from the skin.

===Oral===
An oral syringe is a measuring instrument used to accurately measure doses of liquid medication, expressed in millilitres (mL). They do not have threaded tips, because no needle or other device needs to be screwed onto them. The contents are simply squirted or sucked from the syringe directly into the mouth of the person or animal.

Oral syringes are available in various sizes, from 1–10 mL and larger. An oral syringe is typically purple in colour to distinguish it from a standard injection syringe with a luer tip. The sizes most commonly used are 1 mL, 2.5 mL, 3 mL, 5 mL and 10 mL.

===Dental syringes===
A dental syringe is used by dentists for the injection of an anesthetic. It consists of a breech-loading syringe fitted with a sealed cartridge containing an anesthetic solution.

In 1928, Bayer Dental developed, coined and produced a sealed cartridge system under the registered trademark Carpule®. The current trademark owner is Kulzer Dental GmbH.

The carpules have long been reserved for anesthetic products for dental use. It is practically a bottomless flask. The latter is replaced by an elastomer plug that can slide in the body of the cartridge. This plug will be pushed by the plunger of the syringe. The neck is closed with a rubber cap. The dentist places the cartridge directly into a stainless steel syringe, with a double-pointed (single-use) needle. The tip placed on the cartridge side punctures the capsule and the piston will push the product. There is therefore no contact between the product and the ambient air during use.

The ancillary tool (generally part of a dental engine) used to supply water, compressed air or mist (formed by combination of water and compressed air) to the oral cavity for the purpose of irrigation (cleaning debris away from the area the dentist is working on), is also referred to as a dental syringe or a dental irrigation nozzle.

A 3-way syringe/nozzle has separate internal channels supplying air, water or a mist created by combining the pressurized air with the waterflow. The syringe tip can be separated from the main body and replaced when necessary.

In the UK and Ireland, manually operated hand syringes are used to inject lidocaine into patients&#x27; gums.

=== Dose-sparing syringes ===

A dose-sparing syringe is one which minimises the amount of liquid remaining in the barrel after the plunger has been depressed. These syringes feature a combined needle and syringe, and a protrusion on the face of the plunger to expel liquid from the needle hub. Such syringes were particularly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic as vaccines were in short supply.

===Regulation===
In some jurisdictions, the sale or possession of hypodermic syringes may be controlled or prohibited without a prescription, due to its potential use with illegal intravenous drugs.

==Non-medical uses==
The syringe has many non-medical applications.

===Laboratory applications===

Medical-grade disposable hypodermic syringes are often used in research laboratories for convenience and low cost. Another application is to use the needle tip to add liquids to very confined spaces, such as washing out some scientific apparatus. They are often used for measuring and transferring solvents and reagents where a high precision is not required. Alternatively, microliter syringes can be used to measure and dose chemicals very precisely by using a small diameter capillary as the syringe barrel.

The polyethylene construction of these disposable syringes usually makes them rather chemically resistant. There is, however, a risk of the contents of the syringes leaching plasticizers from the syringe material. Non-disposable glass syringes may be preferred where this is a problem. Glass syringes may also be preferred where a very high degree of precision is important (i.e. quantitative chemical analysis), because their engineering tolerances are lower and the plungers move more smoothly. In these applications, the transfer of pathogens is usually not an issue.

Used with a long needle or cannula, syringes are also useful for transferring fluids through rubber septa when atmospheric oxygen or moisture are being excluded. Examples include the transfer of air-sensitive or pyrophoric reagents such as phenylmagnesium bromide and &quot;n&quot;-butyllithium respectively. Glass syringes are also used to inject small samples for gas chromatography (1 μl) and mass spectrometry (10 μl). Syringe drivers may be used with the syringe as well.

===Cooking===
Some culinary uses of syringes are injecting liquids (such as gravy) into other foods, or for the manufacture of some candies.

Syringes may also be used when cooking meat to enhance flavor and texture by injecting juices inside the meat, and in baking to inject filling inside a pastry. It is common for these syringes to be made of stainless steel components, including the barrel. Such facilitates easy disassembly and cleaning.

===Others===
Syringes are used to refill ink cartridges with ink in fountain pens.

Common workshop applications include injecting glue into tight spots to repair joints where disassembly is impractical or impossible; and injecting lubricants onto working surfaces without spilling.

Sometimes a large hypodermic syringe is used without a needle for very small baby mammals to suckle from in artificial rearing.

Historically, large pumps that use reciprocating motion to pump water were referred to as syringes. Pumps of this type were used as early firefighting equipment.

There are fountain syringes where the liquid is in a bag or can and goes to the nozzle via a pipe. In earlier times, clyster syringes were used for that purpose.

Loose snus is often applied using modified syringes. The nozzle is removed so the opening is the width of the chamber. The snus can be packed tightly into the chamber and plunged into the upper lip. Syringes, called portioners, are also manufactured for this particular purpose.

==Historical timeline==

*Piston syringes were used in ancient times. During the 1st century AD Aulus Cornelius Celsus mentioned the use of them to treat medical complications in his &quot;De Medicina&quot;.
*9th century: The Iraqi/Egyptian surgeon Ammar ibn &#x27;Ali al-Mawsili&#x27; described a syringe in the 9th century using a hollow glass tube, and suction to remove cataracts from patients&#x27; eyes, a practice that remained in use until at least the 13th century.
*Pre-Columbian Native Americans created early hypodermic needles and syringes using &quot;hollow bird bones and small animal bladders&quot;.
*1650: Blaise Pascal invented a syringe (not necessarily hypodermic) as an application of what is now called Pascal&#x27;s law.
*1844: Irish physician Francis Rynd invented the hollow needle and used it to make the first recorded subcutaneous injections, specifically a sedative to treat neuralgia.
*1853: Charles Pravaz and Alexander Wood independently developed medical syringes with a needle fine enough to pierce the skin. Pravaz&#x27;s syringe was made of silver and used a screw mechanism to dispense fluids. Wood&#x27;s syringe was made of glass, enabling its contents to be seen and measured, and used a plunger to inject them. It is effectively the syringe that is used today.
*1865: Charles Hunter coined the term &quot;hypodermic&quot;, and developed an improvement to the syringe that locked the needle into place so that it would not be ejected from the end of the syringe when the plunger was depressed, and published research indicating that injections of pain relief could be given anywhere in the body, not just in the area of pain, and still be effective.
*1867: The Medical and Chirurgical Society of London investigated whether injected narcotics had a general effect (as argued by Hunter) or whether they only worked locally (as argued by Wood). After conducting animal tests and soliciting opinions from the wider medical community, they firmly sided with Hunter.
*1899: Letitia Mumford Geer patented a syringe which could be operated with one hand and which could be used for self-administered rectal injections.
*1946: Chance Brothers in Smethwick, West Midlands, England, produced the first all-glass syringe with interchangeable barrel and plunger, thereby allowing mass-sterilisation of components without the need for matching them.
*1949: Australian inventor Charles Rothauser created the world&#x27;s first plastic, disposable hypodermic syringe at his Adelaide factory.
*1951: Rothauser produced the first injection-moulded syringes made of polypropylene, a plastic that can be heat-sterilised. Millions were made for Australian and export markets.
*1956: New Zealand pharmacist and inventor Colin Murdoch was granted New Zealand and Australian patents for a disposable plastic syringe.

<text>Gordon Angus Deayton (; born 6 January 1956) is an English actor, writer, musician, comedian and broadcaster.

Deayton was the original presenter of the satirical panel game show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; (1990—2002), the host of British panel show &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot; (2007—2008), and a regular cast member of the David Renwick sitcom &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; (1990—2000). He also played George Windsor in the series &quot;Waterloo Road&quot;.

==Early life==
The youngest of three sons of a Prudential insurance broker/manager English father and a home economics school teacher Scottish mother, Deayton was brought up in Banstead, Surrey, and attended Oakhurst Grange School and Caterham School. He showed early promise as a footballer and had a trial with Crystal Palace. He was captain of the Caterham U16 Rugby team.

Deayton read French and German at New College, Oxford, where, in 1978, he was recruited into the Oxford Revue, performing with them at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. This led to the creation of the parody band the Hee Bee Gee Bees in 1980, with the songs written by Richard Curtis and Philip Pope. Their best-selling single &quot;Meaningless Songs (In Very High Voices)&quot; (plus the B-side &quot;Posing in the Moonlight&quot;) was a parody of the falsetto style of disco hits by the Bee Gees.

==Radio and television career==
Deayton began his career on &quot;Radio Active&quot;, a parody of British local radio stations broadcast on BBC Radio 4 between 1981 and 1987, which he co-wrote and performed. It transferred to television as &quot;KYTV&quot; between 1989 and 1993. Deayton presented a tribute to &quot;Radio Active&quot; and KYTV colleague and friend (and long-time BBC producer) Geoffrey Perkins for BBC Radio 4 on 4 October 2008.

Deayton was frequently a straight man alongside Rowan Atkinson. He starred with Atkinson as a pool attendant and a man on a park bench in the &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; episode &quot;The Curse of Mr. Bean&quot; and appeared opposite Atkinson in the &quot;Black Adder&quot; episode &quot;Born to Be King&quot; (1983) as one of the Jumping Jews of Jerusalem.

From 1988 to 1991, Deayton was a featured player in all three series of the Emmy award-winning sketch comedy programme &quot;Alexei Sayle&#x27;s Stuff.&quot; In 1990, Deayton was cast as the Meldrews&#x27; neighbour Patrick Trench in the British suburban sitcom &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; and was selected as host of &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. The same year, he featured on television advertising the Vauxhall Nova. Andre Ptaszynski tried to persuade him to take the lead role in Steven Moffat&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Chalk&quot;, a role eventually taken by David Bamber. Deayton worked with David Renwick again appearing in the miniseries &quot;If You See God, Tell Him&quot;.

In an episode of &quot;Coupling&quot;, he appears in a fantasy sequence with Mariella Frostrup. He hosted the late-1990s BBC show &quot;Before They Were Famous&quot;, which showed early and frequently embarrassing clips of TV and film stars (including Deayton himself) when they were relatively unknown. He was much in demand as a presenter of television specials including the BBC&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve show and the BAFTA Awards. He also featured in a series of advertisements for Barclaycard and the films &quot;Savage Hearts&quot; and &quot;Elizabeth&quot;.

===&quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;===
Deayton&#x27;s suave manner as host of &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; led to his being nicknamed &quot;TV&#x27;s Mr Sex&quot;, by a &quot;Time Out&quot; listings writer.

In May 2002, the British tabloid newspaper the &quot;News of the World&quot; reported he had taken cocaine and had sex with prostitutes. He was ridiculed by Paul Merton and Ian Hislop in the following episode of &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; but continued as presenter. Deayton began the episode with: &quot;Good evening and welcome to &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, where this week&#x27;s loser is presenting it.&quot; He added later, &quot;There is, by the way, no need to adjust your set, my face is this red.&quot;

Following more allegations in October, Deayton was dismissed after two episodes of the new series. One online poll, on the BBC&#x27;s own website, showed over three-quarters of respondents wanted Deayton to stay on as the programme&#x27;s host. In April 2003, Stephen Fry supported Deayton by refusing to appear on the show again.

Responding to Merton&#x27;s &quot;I didn&#x27;t stab him in the back, I stabbed him in the front&quot; line regarding the episode, in 2016 Deayton said: &quot;Yes, I&#x27;ve heard this and [his comment] is a way of not answering the question. But it&#x27;s such a tangled web to describe what happened. And Merton and Hislop probably don&#x27;t know what was happening in the background.&quot;

===Subsequent career===
After his stint on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; ended, Deayton&#x27;s work included a reunion of the &quot;Radio Active&quot; cast in a new episode in December 2002. In 2003, he guest-starred as Downing Street&#x27;s spin doctor in an episode of the BBC comedy &quot;Absolute Power&quot;, starring Stephen Fry and John Bird. In January 2004, he starred in the BBC comedy &quot;Nighty Night&quot;. Deayton had a cameo role as a hotel receptionist in the 2004 film &quot;Fat Slags&quot;. A few months later, he presented the quiz &quot;Bognor or Bust&quot;. In January 2006, he hosted an ITV show based upon self-help videos called &quot;Help Your Self&quot;.

Deayton is associated with Comic Relief/Sport Relief and featured in its broadcasts. He co-presented the Sport Relief charity programme &quot;Only Fools on Horses&quot; in July 2006. Deayton appeared for the England team as a second-half substitute in the Soccer Aid match in support of UNICEF on 27 May 2006. He returned as a starting player for England in a 7 September 2008 rematch.

In 2007, he was in &quot;Casualty&quot;, playing an exaggerated version of himself in a Comic Relief-related story. In June 2007, Deayton returned to the BBC to host panel show, &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot;. In November 2007, he was censured by the BBC for making a &quot;pungently personal&quot; joke about Jimmy Savile and his mother on the show. Deayton quietly left the show in 2009 and was replaced by Rob Brydon. On 3 September 2007, Deayton hosted the third series of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, but was dismissed in 2009 after arguments with chef Marco Pierre White and was replaced by Claudia Winkleman.

In 2008, Deayton also presented &quot;Comedy Sketchbook&quot;, a nostalgic look at classic comedy sketches, on BBC1. On 6 December 2008, he presented the 2008 British Comedy Awards, after host Jonathan Ross stepped down because of controversy surrounding &quot;The Russell Brand Show&quot; prank calls row.

His feature film appearances include the mysterious, all-knowing man in &quot;That Deadwood Feeling&quot; (2009, co-starring Jack Davenport, Dexter Fletcher and David Soul), &quot;Swinging with the Finkels&quot; (2011, written and directed by Jonathan Newman, with Mandy Moore and Martin Freeman), and &quot;Playing the Moldovans at Tennis&quot; (2012). He returned to BBC Radio 4 in 2011 to host the panel show &quot;It&#x27;s Your Round&quot;.

On 12 December 2012, Deayton joined the BBC drama series &quot;Waterloo Road&quot; as a cynical teacher and for a further series as deputy head, George Windsor. He made his first appearance in episode 27 of the eighth series in 2013. In December 2012, he appeared on the BBC Two programme &quot;World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Roads&quot;, in which he and Mariella Frostrup were filmed driving along the east coast of Madagascar. He co-starred with Anna Chancellor in the BBC sitcom &quot;Pramface&quot; (2013).

In August 2016, at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Deayton wrote and performed in a revival of &quot;Radio Active&quot;.

From 2017 to 2022, he featured in Moray Hunter&#x27;s radio sitcom &quot;Alone&quot; on BBC Radio 4 playing as Mitch, a widower and part-time therapist.

==Personal life==

At Oxford, Deayton was in a relationship with Helen Atkinson-Wood (later an actress and co-star on &quot;Radio Active&quot; and KYTV). While touring with the Hee Bee Gee Bees in Australia in the 1980s, Deayton saved Atkinson-Wood&#x27;s life when he rescued her after she was caught in a rip current while swimming off Sydney&#x27;s Manly Beach.

In the 1980s, Deayton lived with singer and actress Stephanie de Sykes.

From 1991 to 2015, he was in a relationship with scriptwriter Lise Mayer and they have a son together, to whom Richard Wilson is godfather.

<doc id="147930" wikidata="Q131779" url="?curid=147930" title="Opposite">
<text>In lexical semantics, opposites are words lying in an inherently incompatible binary relationship. For example, something that is &quot;even&quot; entails that it is not &quot;odd&quot;. It is referred to as a &#x27;binary&#x27; relationship because there are two members in a set of opposites. The relationship between opposites is known as opposition. A member of a pair of opposites can generally be determined by the question &quot;What is the opposite of  X ?&quot;

The term antonym (and the related antonymy) is commonly taken to be synonymous with opposite, but antonym also has other more restricted meanings. Graded (or gradable) antonyms are word pairs whose meanings are opposite and which lie on a continuous spectrum (hot, cold). Complementary antonyms are word pairs whose meanings are opposite but whose meanings do not lie on a continuous spectrum (&quot;push&quot;, &quot;pull&quot;). Relational antonyms are word pairs where opposite makes sense only in the context of the relationship between the two meanings (&quot;teacher&quot;, &quot;pupil&quot;). These more restricted meanings may not apply in all scholarly contexts, with Lyons (1968, 1977) defining antonym to mean gradable antonyms, and Crystal (2003) warning that antonymy and antonym should be regarded with care.

==General discussion==
Opposition is a semantic relation in which one word has a sense or meaning that negates or, in terms of a scale, is distant from a related word. Some words lack a lexical opposite due to an accidental gap in the language&#x27;s lexicon. For instance, while the word &quot;devout&quot; has no direct opposite, it is easy to conceptualize a scale of devoutness, where &quot;devout&quot; lies at the positive end with a missing counterpart at the negative end. In certain cases, opposites can be formed with prefixes like &quot;un-&quot; or &quot;non-,&quot; with varying levels of naturalness. For example, &quot;undevout&quot; is found in Webster&#x27;s 1828 dictionary, while the prefix pattern of &quot;non-person&quot; could theoretically extend to &quot;non-platypus.&quot;

Conversely, some words appear to be derived from a prefix suggesting opposition, yet the root term does not exist. An example is &quot;inept,&quot; which seems to be &quot;in-&quot; + *&quot;ept,&quot; although the word &quot;ept&quot; itself does not exist. Such words are known as unpaired words.
Opposites may be viewed as a special type of incompatibility. Words that are incompatible create the following type of entailment (where &quot;X&quot; is a given word and &quot;Y&quot; is a different word incompatible with word X):

: sentence &quot;A is  X &quot;  entails  sentence &quot;A is not  Y &quot; 

An example of an incompatible pair of words is &quot;cat : dog&quot;:

: &quot;It&#x27;s a cat&quot;  entails  &quot;It&#x27;s not a dog&quot; 

This incompatibility is also found in the opposite pairs &quot;fast : slow&quot; and &quot;stationary : moving&quot;, as can be seen below:

&quot;It&#x27;s fast&quot;  entails  &quot;It&#x27;s not slow&quot; 

:&quot;It&#x27;s stationary&quot;  entails  &quot;It&#x27;s not moving&quot;

Cruse (2004) identifies some basic characteristics of opposites:

* &quot;binarity&quot;, the occurrence of opposites as a lexical pair
* &quot;inherentness&quot;, whether the relationship may be presumed implicitly
* &quot;patency&quot;, the quality of how obvious a pair is

Some planned languages abundantly use such devices to reduce vocabulary multiplication. Esperanto has &quot;mal-&quot; (compare &quot;bona&quot; = &quot;good&quot; and &quot;malbona&quot; = &quot;bad&quot;), Damin has &quot;kuri-&quot; (&quot;tjitjuu&quot; &quot;small&quot;, &quot;kuritjitjuu&quot; &quot;large&quot;) and Newspeak has &quot;un-&quot; (as in &quot;ungood&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;).

Some classes of opposites include:

* &quot;antipodals&quot;, pairs of words which describe opposite ends of some axis, either literal (such as &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;, &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot;, &quot;east&quot; and &quot;west&quot;) or figurative or abstract (such as &quot;first&quot; and &quot;last&quot;, &quot;beginning&quot; and &quot;end&quot;, &quot;entry&quot; and &quot;exit&quot;)
* &quot;disjoint opposites&quot; (or &quot;incompatibles&quot;), members of a set which are mutually exclusive but which leave a &quot;lexical gap&quot; unfilled, such as &quot;red&quot; and &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;one&quot; and &quot;ten&quot;, or &quot;Monday&quot; and &quot;Friday&quot;.
* &quot;reversives&quot;, pairs of verbs which denote opposing processes, in which one is the reverse of the other. They are (or may be) performed by the same or similar subject(s) without requiring an object of the verbs, such as &quot;rise&quot; and &quot;fall&quot;, &quot;accelerate&quot; and &quot;decelerate&quot;, or &quot;shrink&quot; and &quot;grow&quot;.
* &quot;converses&quot; (or &quot;relational opposites&quot; or &quot;relational antonyms&quot;), pairs in which one describes a relationship between two objects and the other describes the same relationship when the two objects are reversed, such as &quot;parent&quot; and &quot;child&quot;, &quot;teacher&quot; and &quot;student&quot;, or &quot;buy&quot; and &quot;sell&quot;.
* &quot;overlapping antonyms&quot;, a pair of comparatives in which one, but not the other, implies the positive:
** An example is &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot;. The sentence &quot;&quot;x&quot; is better than &quot;y&quot; does not imply that &quot;x&quot; is good, but &quot;x&quot; is worse than &quot;y&quot;&quot; implies that &quot;x&quot; is bad. Other examples are &quot;faster&quot; and &quot;slower&quot; (&quot;fast&quot; is implied but not &quot;slow&quot;) and &quot;dirtier&quot; and &quot;cleaner&quot; (&quot;dirty&quot; is implied but not &quot;clean&quot;). The relationship between overlapping antonyms is often not inherent, but arises from the way they are interpreted most generally in a language. There is no inherent reason that an item be presumed to be bad when it is compared to another as being worse (it could be &quot;less good&quot;), but English speakers have combined the meaning semantically to it over the development of the language.

== Types of antonyms ==
An antonym is one of a pair of words with opposite meanings. Each word in the pair is the antithesis of the other. A word may have more than one antonym. There are three categories of antonyms identified by the nature of the relationship between the opposed meanings. 

=== Gradable antonyms ===
A gradable antonym is one of a pair of words with opposite meanings where the two meanings lie on a continuous spectrum. Temperature is such a continuous spectrum so &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold&quot;, two meanings on opposite ends of the spectrum, are gradable antonyms. Other examples include: &quot;heavy&quot; : &quot;light&quot;, &quot;fat&quot; : &quot;skinny&quot;, &quot;dark&quot; : &quot;light&quot;, &quot;young&quot; : &quot;old&quot;, &quot;early&quot; : &quot;late&quot;, &quot;empty&quot; : &quot;full&quot;, &quot;dull&quot; : &quot;interesting&quot;.

=== Complementary antonyms ===
A complementary antonym, sometimes called a binary or contradictory antonym (Aarts, Chalker &amp; Weiner 2014), is one of a pair of words with opposite meanings, where the two meanings do not lie on a continuous spectrum. There is no continuous spectrum between &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;even&quot; but they are opposite in meaning and are therefore complementary antonyms. Other examples include: &quot;mortal&quot; : &quot;immortal&quot;, &quot;exit&quot; : &quot;entrance&quot;, &quot;exhale&quot; : &quot;inhale&quot;, &quot;occupied&quot; : &quot;vacant&quot;.

=== Relational antonyms ===
A relational antonym is one of a pair of words that refer to a relationship from opposite points of view. There is no lexical opposite of &quot;teacher&quot;, but &quot;teacher&quot; and &quot;pupil&quot; are opposite within the context of their relationship. This makes them relational antonyms. Other examples include: &quot;husband&quot; : &quot;wife&quot;, &quot;doctor&quot; : &quot;patient&quot;, &quot;predator&quot; : &quot;prey&quot;, &quot;teach&quot; : &quot;learn&quot;, &quot;servant&quot; : &quot;master&quot;, &quot;come&quot; : &quot;go&quot;, &quot;parent&quot; : &quot;child&quot;.

==Auto-antonyms==
An auto-antonym is a word that can have opposite meanings in different contexts or under separate definitions:
* enjoin (to prohibit, issue injunction; to order, )
* (moving quickly; fixed in place)
* (to ; to )
* (punishment, prohibition; permission)
* ( in a specific place, postpone; direction, movement)

<text>The Eastern Berber languages are a group of Berber languages spoken in Libya and Egypt. They include Awjila, Sokna and Fezzan (El-Fogaha), Siwi and Ghadamès, though it is not clear that they form a valid genealogical group.

Eastern Berber is generally considered as part of the Zenatic Berber supergroup of Northern Berber.

==Classification==
Kossmann (1999:29, 33) divides them into two groups:
* one consisting of Ghadamès and Awjila. These two languages are the only Berber languages to preserve proto-Berber *β as β; elsewhere in Berber it becomes &quot;h&quot; or disappears.
* the other consisting of Nafusi (excluding Zuwara and southern Tunisia), Sokna (El-Foqaha) and Siwi. This shares some innovations with Zenati, and others (e.g. the change of *ă to ə and the loss of *β) with Northern Berber in general.

Blench (ms, 2006) lists the following as separate languages, with dialects in parentheses; like &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, he classifies Nafusi as Eastern Zenati.

*Siwa
*Awjila
*Sokna †
*Ghadamès
*Zurg †

The &quot;Lingvarium Project&quot; (2005) cites two additional languages: the extinct language of Jaghbub and the still-spoken Berber language of Tmessa, an oasis located in the north of the Murzuq District. Blažek (1999) considers the language spoken in Tmessa as a dialect of Fezzan.

<doc id="147935" wikidata="Q1130624" url="?curid=147935" title="Gang of Four (band)">
<text>Gang of Four are an English post-punk band, formed in 1976 in Leeds. The original members were singer Jon King, guitarist Andy Gill, bass guitarist Dave Allen and drummer Hugo Burnham. There have been many different line-ups including, among other notable musicians, Sara Lee, Gail Ann Dorsey, and David Pajo. After a brief lull in the 1980s, different constellations of the band recorded two studio albums in the 1990s. Between 2004 and 2006 the original line-up was reunited; Gill toured using the name between 2012 and his death in 2020. In 2021, the band announced that King, Burnham, and Lee would be reuniting for a US tour in 2022 with David Pajo on guitar and Sara Lee returning to the band. They continued to perform live, including at the Cruel World Festival in Pasadena, California; headlining Luna Fest in Coimbra, Portugal and a UK Tour in October 2023. They announced that their &quot;Long Goodbye&quot; tour in 2025 would be their last. For this tour, King and Burnham were joined by Ted Leo on guitar and Gail Greenwood on bass.

The band play a stripped-down mix of punk rock, funk and dub, with a lyrical emphasis on the social and political ills of society. Gang of Four are widely considered one of the leading bands of the late 1970s/early 1980s post-punk movement. Their debut album, &quot;Entertainment!&quot;, was ranked by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as the fifth greatest punk album of all time and at number 483 in their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2004, the album was listed by Pitchfork Media as the 8th best album of the 1970s and, in 2020, by &quot;Pop Matters&quot; as &quot;Best Post Punk album ever&quot;. &quot;Entertainment!&quot; continues to be influential, and was voted 49th in Rolling Stones&#x27; 2023 poll of &quot;100 Best Debut Albums of All time&quot;. Their early 80s albums (&quot;Songs of the Free&quot; and &quot;Hard&quot;) found them softening some of their more jarring qualities, and drifting towards dance-punk and disco. David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described Gang of Four as &quot;probably the best politically motivated band in rock &amp; roll.&quot;.

==History==
=== Early years and &quot;Entertainment!&quot; (1976–1979) ===
The band initially consisted of vocalist Jon King, guitarist Andy Gill, drummer Hugo Burnham and bass guitarist Dave Wolfson. After two or three gigs, Wolfson was replaced by Dave Allen.

Gang of Four&#x27;s music brought together an eclectic array of influences, ranging from the Frankfurt School of social criticism to the increasingly clear trans-Atlantic punk consensus. Gang of Four was named by Andy Corrigan, a member of the Mekons, while driving around with Gill and King when he came upon a newspaper billboard on the intra-Party coup against China&#x27;s &quot;Gang of Four&quot;.

The band&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Damaged Goods&quot; backed with &quot;(Love Like) Anthrax&quot; and &quot;Armalite Rifle&quot;, was recorded in June 1978 and released on 10 December 1978, on Edinburgh&#x27;s Fast Product label. It was a Number 1 indie chart hit and John Peel radio show favourite. &quot;Damaged Goods&quot; was voted one of the 100 Greatest debut singles of all time in 2020&#x27;s Rolling Stone Poll Two Peel radio sessions followed, which, with their incendiary live performances, propelled the band to international attention and sold-out shows across Europe and North America. They were then signed by EMI Records. The group&#x27;s debut single with this label, &quot;At Home He&#x27;s a Tourist&quot;, charted in 1979. Invited to appear on top rated BBC music program &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, the band walked off the show when the BBC told them to sing &quot;rubbish&quot; in the place of the original lyric &quot;rubbers&quot;, as the original line was considered too risqué. The single was then banned by BBC Radio and TV, which lost the band some support at EMI. King&#x27;s lyrics were always controversial and a later single, &quot;I Love a Man in a Uniform&quot;, was banned by the BBC during the Falklands War in 1982.

Critic Stewart Mason has called &quot;Anthrax&quot; not only the group&#x27;s &quot;most notorious song&quot; but also &quot;one of the most unique and interesting songs of its time&quot;. It&#x27;s also a good example of Gang of Four&#x27;s social perspective: after a minute-long, droning, feedback-laced guitar intro, the rhythm section sets up a funky, churning beat, and the guitar drops out entirely. In one stereo channel, King sings a &quot;post-punk anti-love song&quot;, comparing himself to a beetle trapped on its back (&quot;and there&#x27;s no way for me to get up&quot;) and equating love with &quot;a case of anthrax, and that&#x27;s some thing I don&#x27;t want to catch.&quot; Meanwhile, in the other stereo channel (and slightly less prominent in the mix), Gill reads (on the original EP version) a detailed account of the technical resources used on the song, which on the re-recorded album version is replaced by a deadpan monologue about public perception of love and the prevalence of love songs in popular music: &quot;Love crops up quite a lot as something to sing about &#x27;cause most groups make most of their songs about falling in love, or how happy they are to be in love; and you occasionally wonder why these groups do sing about it all the time.&quot; Although the two sets of lyrics tell independent stories they occasionally synchronise for emphasis.

According to critic Paul Morley, &quot;The Gang spliced the ferocious precision of Dr. Feelgood&#x27;s working-class blues with the testing avant-garde intrigue of Henry Cow. Wilfully avoiding structural obviousness, melodic prettiness and harmonic corniness, the Gang&#x27;s music was studded with awkward holes and sharp corners.&quot; At the time, the band was recognised to be doing something very different from other white guitar acts. Ken Tucker, in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, 1980, wrote: &quot;...rarely have the radical edges of black and white music come closer to overlapping... the Gang of Four utilize their bass guitar every bit as prominently and starkly as the curt bass figures that prod the spoken verses in (Kurtis Blow&#x27;s &quot;culture defining&quot; huge summer hit) &quot;The Breaks.&quot;

=== Later years (1980–1983) ===
In 1981, the band released their second LP, &quot;Solid Gold&quot;. Like &quot;Entertainment!&quot;, the album was uncompromising, spare, and analytical. King&#x27;s lyrics in such songs as &quot;Cheeseburger&quot;, &quot;He&#x27;d Send in the Army&quot; and &quot;In the Ditch&quot; exposed the paradoxes of warfare, work and leisure. Van Gosse, in a &quot;Village Voice&quot; review said: &quot;Gang of Four embody a new category in pop, which illuminates all the others, because the motor of their aesthetic is not a &#x27;personal creative vision.&#x27;&quot;

Dave Allen (who later co-founded Shriekback, King Swamp, Low Pop Suicide and the Elastic Purejoy) had left in 1981, and had been briefly replaced by Busta &quot;Cherry&quot; Jones, a sometime player with Parliament, Brian Eno and Talking Heads. After working with Gang of Four to complete their North American tour obligations, Jones left and was replaced by Sara Lee, who was Robert Fripp&#x27;s bassist in the League of Gentlemen. Lee was as good a singer as bassist, and she helped give the band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Songs of the Free&quot;, a more commercially accessible element. Although &quot;I Love a Man in a Uniform&quot; from the album was the band&#x27;s most radio-friendly song, it was banned in the UK shortly after its release because Britain went to war in the Falkland Islands. In the spring of 1983, Burnham left the band after the release of &quot;Songs of the Free&quot; and formed Illustrated Man. Gill and King continued Gang of Four, releasing &quot;Hard&quot; in 1983.

After that, the band broke up, and Lee moved to the United States where she has worked with a number of artists, including The B-52&#x27;s, Ryuichi Sakamoto, and Ani DiFranco.

1986 saw the release of &quot;The Peel Sessions&quot;, a collection of rawly rendered material recorded during the period 1979 to 1981 for British radio BBC. Melody Maker dubbed the album &quot;a perfect and classic nostalgia trip into the world of gaunt cynicism.&quot;

=== Gill and King reunion (1987–1997) ===
Gill and King reunited to record &quot;Mall&quot; in 1991, and finally &quot;Shrinkwrapped&quot; in 1995. &quot;Mall&quot; featured Gail Ann Dorsey, later famous for her longtime association with David Bowie, on bass.

=== Changing line-ups (2004–2012) ===

The original lineup of Jon King, Andy Gill, Dave Allen and Hugo Burnham reformed in November 2004. A UK tour in January 2005, shows in Europe and Japan and tours of the United States in May/June and again in September cemented their fierce live reputation. In October 2005, Gang of Four released a new disc featuring new recordings of songs from the albums &quot;Entertainment!&quot;, &quot;Solid Gold&quot; and &quot;Songs of the Free&quot; titled &quot;Return the Gift&quot;, accompanied by an album&#x27;s worth of remixes.

In January 2011, the band, now featuring Mark Heaney on drums, and Thomas McNeice on bass, released a new album, &quot;Content&quot;, which was called &quot;their best record since the Seventies&quot;. Jon Pareles, in a &quot;New York Times&quot; 4-star review, declared that [the band] &quot;have reclaimed, with a vengeance, their old attack&quot;.
Following successful tours of the US, Australia and Europe in 2011, King and Gill disagreed about the band&#x27;s direction and ceased working together.

=== Final line-up with Gill (2012–2020) ===

Gill, against the wishes of King, continued to tour and record under the Gang of Four name. With new lead vocalist John Sterry, as well as a returning McNiece, the band released &quot;What Happens Next&quot; in 2015, &quot;Complicit&quot; in 2018, and &quot;Happy Now&quot; in 2019, which featured a range of guest artists. XSNoise said &quot;The album [Happy Now] is as intense as any ever released on their discography.&quot;

Andy Gill died on 1 February 2020, and obituaries across the world hailed his legacy and impact. He was &quot;one of the most influential musicians of the post-punk era, leading his band Gang of Four to huge acclaim with his intense, angular, staccato guitar work that blended rock with funk,&quot; said the &quot;Independent&quot;. Gang of Four&#x27;s &quot;brusque, angular style would directly or indirectly influence post-punk and indie-rock bands like Red Hot Chili Peppers (who chose Mr. Gill to produce their debut album), The Jesus Lizard, Nirvana, Rage Against the Machine, Franz Ferdinand and Protomartyr,&quot; said the &quot;New York Times&quot;, adding: &quot;Michael Hutchence of INXS once said that Gang of Four’s music &#x27;took no prisoners,&#x27; adding, &#x27;It was art meets the devil via James Brown.&#x27;&quot; The NME wrote: &quot;Great musicians encapsulate their age; the very best echo endlessly onwards, and Andy Gill...has been reverberating along the baseline of alternative culture for 40 years.&quot;
Two EPs, &quot;This Heaven Gives Me Migraine&quot;, and &quot;Anti Hero&quot; were released after his death featuring some final studio recordings. A tribute album, &quot;The Problem of Leisure: A Celebration of Andy Gill and Gang of Four&quot;, was released in June 2021.

===Reunion (2021–present) ===
In October 2021, Gang of Four&#x27;s social media accounts posted a photo featuring King, Burnham, Lee, and David Pajo of Slint. They later announced that this line-up would be touring in 2022 in support of the &quot;77-81&quot; box set. In 2022, the box-set 77-81 earned Jon King a Grammy Nomination. 

==Legacy==

Gang of Four influenced a number of successful alternative acts throughout the 1980s and 1990s. R.E.M. frontman Michael Stipe cites Gang of Four as one of his band&#x27;s chief influences; Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers has stated that Gang of Four were the single most important influence on his band&#x27;s early music. Kurt Cobain, who has stated that Nirvana started as &quot;a Gang of Four and Scratch Acid ripoff&quot;, ranked &quot;Entertainment!&quot; 13th on the list of his 50 favourite albums in his journal. Buzz Osborne of Melvins has listed &quot;Solid Gold&quot; as one of his favorite albums, adding that &quot;I think that was a massive influence on our band – much more so than people think actually. Certainly, on our second record, &quot;Ozma&quot;. That was one of the main records we were listening to and one that probably influenced it more than most. I’ve never not listened to that record.&quot;

Andy Kellman, writing in AllMusic, argued that Gang of Four&#x27;s &quot;germs of influence&quot; can be found in many rap metal groups &quot;not in touch with their ancestry enough to realize it&quot;.

Other bands that have cited Gang of Four as an influence include Helmet, Band of Susans, Mission of Burma, and Saccharine Trust.

From the 2000s, the band enjoyed a resurgence in popularity, initially due to emergence of new post-punk revival bands such as Radio 4, Clinic, Liars, the Rapture, Neils Children, and then the rise of Franz Ferdinand, We Are Scientists and Bloc Party. Entertainment! continues to be influential, and was voted 49th in Rolling Stones&#x27; 2023 poll of &quot;100 Best Debut Albums of All time&quot;

<text>The Bristol Perseus was a British nine-cylinder, single-row, air-cooled radial aircraft engine produced by the Bristol Engine Company starting in 1932. It was the first production sleeve valve aero engine.

==Design and development==
In late 1925 and early 1926, the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) published a series of papers by Harry Ricardo on the sleeve valve principle. The main advantages over the traditional poppet valves was better volumetric efficiency and the ability to operate at higher rotational speeds. This allowed a smaller engine to produce the same power as a larger one, leading to better fuel efficiency and compact design, particularly in multi-row radial engines.

Roy Fedden, Bristol&#x27;s primary engine designer, became interested in the concept and by 1927 he had constructed a working two-cylinder V as a test bed, with the idea of developing it into a V-12. Problems cropped up on the design, notably the sleeves bursting during the power stroke and stripping their driving gears. A long series of tests and materials changes and improvements required six years and an estimated £2 million to cure. By 1933, the problems had been worked out and the Perseus went on to become the first sleeve valve aero-engine in the world, to be put into large quantity production.

The result was a Bristol Mercury-sized engine adapted to the sleeve valve system, the Perseus, and its smaller cousin, the Bristol Aquila. The first production versions of the Perseus were rated at 580 horsepower (433 kW), the same as the Mercury model for that year, which shows that the sleeve system was being underexploited. The engine was quickly uprated as improvements were introduced and by 1936 the Perseus was delivering 810 hp (604 kW), eventually topping out at 930 hp (690 kW) in 1939, while the Perseus 100 with an increased capacity of 1,635 cu in (26.8 L), produced at 2,700 rpm at 4,250 ft (1,296 m). This far outperformed even the most developed versions of the Mercury.

The Perseus saw limited use in the civilian field, notably on the Short Empire flying-boats but was more common in the expanding military field, where it was found on the Westland Lysander reconnaissance aircraft and the Vickers Vildebeest, Blackburn Botha, Skua and Roc bombers.

The main contribution of the Perseus is that its design was used as the basic piston and cylinder for two &quot;twinned&quot; (double-row) types: the tremendously successful Bristol Hercules and Bristol Centaurus engines. It was in these designs that the advantages of the sleeve valve were finally put to good use and by war&#x27;s end, the Centaurus was one of the most powerful engines in the world.

<doc id="147939" wikidata="Q1355804" url="?curid=147939" title="Constant of integration">
<text>In calculus, the constant of integration, often denoted by formula_1 (or formula_2), is a constant term added to an antiderivative of a function formula_3 to indicate that the indefinite integral of formula_3 (i.e., the set of all antiderivatives of formula_3), on a connected domain, is only defined up to an additive constant. This constant expresses an ambiguity inherent in the construction of antiderivatives.

More specifically, if a function formula_3 is defined on an interval, and formula_7 is an antiderivative of formula_8 then the set of &quot;all&quot; antiderivatives of formula_3 is given by the functions formula_10 where formula_1 is an arbitrary constant (meaning that &quot;any&quot; value of formula_1 would make formula_13 a valid antiderivative). For that reason, the indefinite integral is often written as formula_14 although the constant of integration might be sometimes omitted in lists of integrals for simplicity.

==Origin==

The derivative of any constant function is zero. Once one has found one antiderivative formula_7 for a function formula_8 adding or subtracting any constant formula_1 will give us another antiderivative, because formula_18 The constant is a way of expressing that every function with at least one antiderivative will have an infinite number of them.

Let formula_19 and formula_20 be two everywhere differentiable functions. Suppose that formula_21 for every real number &quot;x&quot;. Then there exists a real number formula_1 such that formula_23 for every real number &quot;x&quot;.

To prove this, notice that formula_24 So formula_25 can be replaced by formula_26 and formula_27 by the constant function formula_28 making the goal to prove that an everywhere differentiable function whose derivative is always zero must be constant:

Choose a real number formula_29 and let formula_30 For any &quot;x&quot;, the fundamental theorem of calculus, together with the assumption that the derivative of formula_25 vanishes, implying that 

formula_32

thereby showing that formula_25 is a constant function.

Two facts are crucial in this proof. First, the real line is connected. If the real line were not connected, one would not always be able to integrate from our fixed &quot;a&quot; to any given &quot;x&quot;. For example, if one were to ask for functions defined on the union of intervals [0,1] and [2,3], and if &quot;a&quot; were 0, then it would not be possible to integrate from 0 to 3, because the function is not defined between 1 and 2. Here, there will be &quot;two&quot; constants, one for each connected component of the domain. In general, by replacing constants with locally constant functions, one can extend this theorem to disconnected domains. For example, there are two constants of integration for formula_34, and infinitely many for formula_35, so for example, the general form for the integral of 1/&quot;x&quot; is:

formula_36

Second, formula_25 and formula_27 were assumed to be everywhere differentiable. If formula_25 and formula_27 are not differentiable at even one point, then the theorem might fail. As an example, let formula_7 be the Heaviside step function, which is zero for negative values of &quot;x&quot; and one for non-negative values of &quot;x&quot;, and let formula_42 Then the derivative of formula_25 is zero where it is defined, and the derivative of formula_27 is always zero. Yet it&#x27;s clear that formula_25 and formula_27 do not differ by a constant, even if it is assumed that formula_25 and formula_27 are everywhere continuous and almost everywhere differentiable the theorem still fails. As an example, take formula_25 to be the Cantor function and again let formula_50

It turns out that adding and subtracting constants is the only flexibility available in finding different antiderivatives of the same function. That is, all antiderivatives are the same up to a constant. To express this fact for formula_51 one can write:
formula_52
where formula_1 is constant of integration. It is easily determined that all of the following functions are antiderivatives of formula_54:
formula_55

==Significance==

The inclusion of the constant of integration is necessitated in some, but not all circumstances. For instance, when evaluating definite integrals using the fundamental theorem of calculus, the constant of integration can be ignored as it will always cancel with itself.

However, different methods of computation of indefinite integrals can result in multiple resulting antiderivatives, each implicitly containing different constants of integration, and no particular option may be considered simplest. For example, formula_56 can be integrated in at least three different ways.

formula_57Additionally, omission of the constant, or setting it to zero, may make it prohibitive to deal with a number of problems, such as those with initial value conditions. A general solution containing the arbitrary constant is often necessary to identify the correct particular solution. For example, to obtain the antiderivative of formula_54 that has the value 400 at &quot;x&quot; = π, then only one value of formula_1 will work (in this case formula_60).

The constant of integration also implicitly or explicitly appears in the language of differential equations. Almost all differential equations will have many solutions, and each constant represents the unique solution of a well-posed initial value problem.

An additional justification comes from abstract algebra. The space of all (suitable) real-valued functions on the real numbers is a vector space, and the differential operator formula_61 is a linear operator. The operator formula_61 maps a function to zero if and only if that function is constant. Consequently, the kernel of formula_61 is the space of all constant functions. The process of indefinite integration amounts to finding a pre-image of a given function. There is no canonical pre-image for a given function, but the set of all such pre-images forms a coset. Choosing a constant is the same as choosing an element of the coset. In this context, solving an initial value problem is interpreted as lying in the hyperplane given by the initial conditions.
