<text>Nottingham Forest Football Club is a professional association football club based in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, England. The club competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football.

Founded in 1865, Nottingham Forest have played their home games at the City Ground since 1898. The club has won two European Cups (now the UEFA Champions League), making them one of six English clubs to have claimed the competition. Additionally, they have secured one UEFA Super Cup, one League title, two FA Cups, four League Cups, and one FA Charity Shield.

The club has competed in the top two tiers of English football in all but five seasons since their admission to the Football League. Its most successful period came under the management of Brian Clough and Peter Taylor in the late 1970s and early 1980s, during which they achieved back-to-back European Cup triumphs in 1979 and 1980.

In Clough&#x27;s final decade at the club, Forest won the 1989 and 1990 League Cups. They were also losing finalists in the 1991 FA Cup final and 1992 League Cup final, before relegation from the Premier League in 1993. Upon their immediate return, Forest finished third in the Premier League in 1995, before suffering relegation again in 1997 and 1999. The team returned to the Premier League by winning the play-offs in 2022.

Forest&#x27;s main rivalry is with Derby County, with whom they contest the East Midlands derby. In 2007 the Brian Clough Trophy was founded, which has since then been given to the winner.

==History==
===19th century===

In 1865 a group of shinty players met at the Clinton Arms (now renamed The Playwright) at the junction of Nottingham&#x27;s Shakespeare Street and North Sherwood Street. J.S. Scrimshaw&#x27;s proposal to play association football instead was agreed and Nottingham Forest Football Club was formed. It was agreed at the same meeting that the club would purchase twelve tasselled caps coloured &#x27;Garibaldi Red&#x27; (named after the leader of the Italian &#x27;Redshirts&#x27; fighters). Thus the club&#x27;s official colours were established. Matches were originally played at Forest Racecourse, historically part of Sherwood Forest and the presumed source of the word &#x27;Forest&#x27; in the team&#x27;s name.

From 2019 to 2023, Nottingham Forest claimed to be the oldest remaining club in the English Football League. In 2019, when Notts County were relegated from the league, Stoke City claimed to be the oldest remaining club, but football historian Mark Metcalf stated that Stoke was formed in 1868, rather than the 1863 date on the club&#x27;s badge, and therefore Forest was the oldest club. The EFL also stated that Nottingham Forest was the oldest.

Forest&#x27;s first ever official game was played against Notts County taking place on 22 March 1866. On 23 April 1870, when the team played their first game in league play, the steward of the club was John Lymberry and William Henry Revis scored the first goal. On that day, Revis also won the prize for kicking a football furthest with a kick of 161 feet 8 inches.

In their early years Nottingham Forest were a multi-sports club. As well as their roots in bandy and shinty, Forest&#x27;s baseball club were British champions in 1899. Forest&#x27;s charitable approach helped clubs like Liverpool, Arsenal and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion to form. In 1886, Forest donated a set of football kits to help Arsenal establish themselves – the North London team still wear red. Forest also donated shirts to Everton and helped secure a site to play on for Brighton.

In 1878–79 season, Nottingham Forest entered into the FA Cup for the first time. Forest beat Notts County 3–1 in the first round at Beeston Cricket Ground before eventually losing 2–1 to Old Etonians in the semi-final.

Nottingham Forest&#x27;s application was rejected to join the Football League at its formation in 1888. Forest instead joined the Football Alliance in 1889.

They won the competition in 1892 before then entering the Football League. That season they reached and lost in an FA Cup semi-final for the fourth time to date. This time it was to West Bromwich Albion after a replay.
Nottingham Forest&#x27;s first FA Cup semi-final win was at the fifth attempt, the 1897–98 FA Cup 2–0 replay win against Southampton. The first game was drawn 1–1. Derby County beat Nottingham Forest 5–0 five days before the final. Six of the cup final side were rested in that league game. In that 1898 FA Cup final at Crystal Palace before 62,000 fans, Willie Wragg passed a 19th minute free kick to Arthur Capes. Capes shot through the defensive wall to score. Derby equalised with a free kick headed home by Steve Bloomer off the underside of the cross bar after 31 minutes. In the 42nd minute Jack Fryer was unable to hold a Charlie Richards shot giving Capes a tap in for his second goal. Wragg&#x27;s injury meant Forest had to change their line up with Capes dropping back to midfield. In the 86th minute John Boag headed away a corner by Nottingham Forest. John McPherson moved in to collect shooting low into the goal to win 3–1.

===First half of 20th century===
Forest lost FA Cup semi-finals in 1900 and 1902. They finished fourth in the 1900–01 Football League followed with fifth place the season after. The club then started to slide down the table. Forest were relegated for the first time in 1905–06. Grenville Morris had his first of five seasons as the club&#x27;s highest scorer en route to becoming the all-time club highest goalscorer with 213 goals.

Promotion as champions was immediate in 1906–07. The club was relegated a second time to the Second Division in 1911, and had to seek re-election in 1914 after finishing bottom of that tier; as the First World War approached it was in serious financial trouble. The outbreak of the War, along with the benevolence of the committee members, prevented the club going under.

In 1919, the Football League First Division was to be expanded from twenty clubs to twenty-two in time for the 1919–20 Football League: Forest was one of eight clubs to campaign for entry, but received only three votes. Arsenal and Chelsea gained the two additional top tier slots.

In a turnaround from the first six seasons struggling back in the Second Division, Forest were promoted as champions in 1921–22. They survived each of the first two seasons back in the top flight by one position. In the third season after promotion they were relegated as the division&#x27;s bottom club in 1924–25. They remained in the second tier until relegation in 1949 to the Football League Third Division.

===Re-emergence then decline (1950–1974)===
They were quickly promoted back two years later as champions, having scored a record 110 goals in the 1950–51 season. They regained First Division status in 1957.

Johnny Quigley&#x27;s solitary 1958–59 FA Cup semi-final goal beat Aston Villa. Billy Walker&#x27;s Forest beat Luton Town 2–1 in the 1959 FA Cup final. Like in 1898, Forest had lost heavily to their opponents only weeks earlier in the league. Stewart Imlach crossed for a 10th-minute opener by Roy Dwight (the cousin of Reg Dwight better known as Elton John). Tommy Wilson had Forest 2–0 up after 14 minutes. The game had an unusually large number of stoppages due to injury, particularly to Forest players. This was put down to the lush nature of the Wembley turf. The most notable of these stoppages was Dwight breaking his leg in a 33rd minute tackle with Brendan McNally. Forest had been on top until that point. Luton though gradually took control of the match, with Dave Pacey scoring midway through the second half. Forest were reduced to nine fit men with ten minutes remaining when Bill Whare crippled with cramp, became little more than a spectator. Despite late Allan Brown and Billy Bingham chances Chick Thomson conceded no further goals for Forest to beat the Wembley 1950s &#x27;hoodoo&#x27; (where one team was hampered by losing a player through injury). Club record appearance holder Bobby McKinlay played in the final winning team captained by Jack Burkitt.

By this time, Forest had replaced Notts County as the biggest club in Nottingham. Johnny Carey assembled a team including Joe Baker and Ian Storey-Moore that for a long spell went largely unchanged in challenging for the 1966–67 Football League title. They beat title rivals Manchester United 4–1 at the City Ground on 1 October. The 3–0 win against Aston Villa on 15 April had Forest second in the table, a point behind United. Injuries eventually took effect, meaning Forest had to settle for being League runners-up and losing in the FA Cup semi-final to Dave Mackay&#x27;s Tottenham Hotspur.

The 1966–67 season&#x27;s success seemed an opportunity to build upon, with crowds of 40,000 virtually guaranteed at the time. Instead, a mixture at the club of poor football management, the unique committee structure and proud amateurism meant decline after the 1966-67 peak. Forest were relegated from the top flight in 1972. Matt Gillies&#x27; October 1972 managerial departure was followed by short managerial reigns by Dave Mackay and Allan Brown. A 2–0 Boxing Day home defeat by Notts County prompted the committee (Forest had no board of directors then) to sack Brown.

===Brian Clough and Peter Taylor (1975–1982)===
Brian Clough became manager of Forest on 6 January 1975, twelve weeks after the end of his 44-day tenure as manager of Leeds United. Clough brought Jimmy Gordon to be his club trainer, as Gordon had been for him at Derby County and Leeds. Scottish centre-forward Neil Martin scored the only goal in Clough&#x27;s first game in charge, beating Tottenham Hotspur in an FA Cup third round replay.

Ian Bowyer was already at Forest and had won domestic and European trophies with Manchester City. Clough signed Scots duo John McGovern and John O&#x27;Hare in February, who both were part of Clough&#x27;s Derby County 1971–72 Football League title win. He signed Colin Barrett in March, initially on loan. Clough brought John Robertson and Martin O&#x27;Neill back into the fold after they had requested transfers under Brown. Viv Anderson had previously debuted for the first team and became a regular under Clough. The young Tony Woodcock was at Forest but was then unrated by Clough and was to be loaned to Lincoln City. Forest were 13th in English football&#x27;s second tier when Clough joined. They finished that season 16th. Forest signed Frank Clark in July of that close season on a free transfer. The season after, Forest finished eighth in Clough&#x27;s 1975–76 Football League first full season in charge. It was in this season, McGovern became long-standing club captain, taking over from a game in which Bob &quot;Sammy&quot; Chapman and Liam O&#x27;Kane were both injured.

Peter Taylor on 16 July 1976 rejoined Clough, becoming his assistant manager, as he had been when winning the league at Derby. Taylor, included being the club&#x27;s talent spotter in his role. After assessing the players, Taylor told Clough, &quot;that was a feat by you to finish eighth in the Second Division because some of them are only Third Division players&quot;. Taylor berated John Robertson for allowing himself to become overweight and disillusioned. He got Robertson on a diet and training regime that would help him become a European Cup winner. Taylor turned Woodcock from a reserve midfielder into a 42 cap England striker. In September 1976, he bought striker Peter Withe to Forest for £43,000, selling him to Newcastle United for £250,000 two years later. Withe was replaced in the starting team by Garry Birtles who Taylor had scouted playing for non-league Long Eaton United. Birtles also went on to represent England. In October 1976 Brian Clough acting on Peter Taylor&#x27;s advice signed Larry Lloyd for £60,000 after an initial loan period.

Together, Clough and Taylor took Forest to new heights. The first trophy of the Clough and Taylor reign was the 1976–77 Anglo-Scottish Cup. Forest beat Orient 5–1 on aggregate in the two-legged final played in December 1976. Clough valued winning a derided trophy as the club&#x27;s first silverware since 1959. He said, &quot;Those who said it was a nothing trophy were absolutely crackers. We&#x27;d won something, and it made all the difference.&quot;

On 7 May 1977, Jon Moore&#x27;s own goal meant Forest in their last league game of the season beat Millwall 1–0 at the City Ground. This kept Forest in the third promotion spot in the league table and dependent on Bolton Wanderers dropping points in three games in hand in the fight for third place. On 14 May Kenny Hibbitt&#x27;s goal from his rehearsed free kick routine with Willie Carr gave Wolves a 1–0 win at Bolton. Bolton&#x27;s defeat reached the Forest team mid-air en route to an end of season break in Mallorca. Forest&#x27;s third place promotion from the 1976–77 Football League Second Division was the fifth-lowest points tally of any promoted team in history, 52 (two points for a win in England until 1981).

Taylor secretly followed Kenny Burns concluding Burns&#x27;s reputation as a hard drinker and gambler was exaggerated. Taylor sanctioned his £150,000 July signing. Burns became FWA Footballer of the Year in 1977–78 after being moved from centre-forward to centre-back. Forest started their return to the top league campaign with a 3–1 win at Everton. Three further wins in league and cup followed without conceding a goal. Then came five early September goals conceded in losing 3–0 at Arsenal and beating Wolves 3–2 at home. Peter Shilton then signed for a record fee for a goalkeeper of £325,000. Taylor reasoned: &quot;Shilton wins you matches.&quot; 20-year-old John Middleton was first team goalkeeper pre-Shilton. Middleton later in the month went in part exchange with £25,000 to Derby County for Archie Gemmill transferring to Forest. Gemmill was another Scottish former 1972 Derby title winner.

Forest lost only three of their first 16 league games, the last of which was at Leeds United on 19 November 1977. They lost only one further game all season, the 11 March FA Cup sixth round defeat at West Bromwich Albion. Forest won the 1977–78 Football League seven-points ahead of runners-up Liverpool. Forest became one of the few teams (and the most recent team to date) to win the First Division title the season after winning promotion from the Second Division. This made Clough the third of four managers to win the English league championship with two different clubs. Forest conceded just 24 goals in 42 league games. They beat Liverpool 1–0 in the 1978 Football League Cup final replay despite cup-tied Shilton, Gemmill and December signing David Needham missing out. Chris Woods chalked up two clean sheets in the final, covering Shilton&#x27;s League Cup absence. McGovern missed the replay through injury, meaning Burns lifted the trophy as deputising captain. Robertson&#x27;s penalty was the only goal of the game.

Forest started season 1978–79 by beating Ipswich Town 5–0 for an FA Charity Shield record winning margin. In the 1978–79 European Cup they were drawn to play the trophy winners of the past two seasons, Liverpool. Home goals by Birtles and Barrett put Forest through 2–0 on aggregate. 26-year-old Barrett suffered a serious leg injury ten days later against Middlesbrough that ultimately ended his professional career two years later. On 9 December 1978, Liverpool ended Forest&#x27;s 42 match unbeaten league run dating back to November the year before. The unbeaten run was the equivalent of a whole season surpassing the previous record of 35 games held by Burnley in 1920/21. The record stood until surpassed by Arsenal in August 2004, a month before Clough&#x27;s death. Arsenal played 49 league games without defeat.

In February 1979, Taylor authorised the English game&#x27;s first £1 million transfer signing Trevor Francis from Birmingham City. In the European Cup semi-final first leg at home against 1. FC Köln, Forest were two goals behind after 20 minutes, then scored three to edge ahead before Köln equalised to start the German second leg ahead on the away goals rule. Ian Bowyer&#x27;s goal in Germany put Forest through. Günter Netzer asked afterwards, &quot;Who is this McGovern? I have never heard of him, yet he ran the game.&quot; Forest beat Malmö 1–0 in Munich&#x27;s Olympiastadion in the 1979 European Cup final; Francis, on his European debut, scored with a back post header from Robertson&#x27;s cross. Forest beat Southampton in the final 3–2 to retain the League Cup; Birtles scored twice, as did Woodcock once. Forest finished second in the 1978–79 Football League, eight points behind Liverpool.
Forest declined to play in the home and away 1979 Intercontinental Cup against Paraguay&#x27;s Club Olimpia. Forest beat F.C. Barcelona 2–1 on aggregate in the 1979 European Super Cup in January and February 1980, Charlie George scoring the only goal in the home first leg, while Burns scored an equaliser in the return in Spain. In the 1979–80 Football League Cup Forest reached a third successive final. A defensive mix up between Needham and Shilton let Wolves&#x27; Andy Gray tap in to an empty net. Forest passed up numerous chances, losing 1–0. In the 1979–80 European Cup quarter-final, Forest won 3–1 at Dinamo Berlin to overturn a 1–0 home defeat. In the semi-final, they beat Ajax 2–1 on aggregate. They beat Hamburg 1–0 in the 1980 European Cup final at Madrid&#x27;s Santiago Bernabéu Stadium to retain the trophy; after 20 minutes, Robertson scored, after exchanging passes with Birtles, and Forest then defended solidly. Forest finished fifth in the 1979–80 Football League.

In the 1980–81 European Cup first round, Forest lost 2–0 on aggregate to 1–0 defeats home and away by CSKA Sofia. McGovern subsequently said the double defeat by CSKA affected the team&#x27;s self-confidence, in that they had lost out to modestly talented opponents. Forest lost the 1980 European Super Cup on away goals after a 2–2 aggregate draw against Valencia; Bowyer scored both Forest goals in the home first leg. On 11 February 1981, Forest lost 1–0 in the 1980 Intercontinental Cup against Uruguayan side, Club Nacional de Football. The match was played for the first time at the neutral venue National Stadium in Tokyo before 62,000 fans.

The league and European Cup winning squad was broken up to capitalise on player sale value. Clough and Taylor both later said this was a mistake. The rebuilt side comprising youngsters and signings such as Ian Wallace, Raimondo Ponte and Justin Fashanu did not challenge for trophies. Taylor said in 1982, 

John McGovern and Peter Shilton transferred and Jimmy Gordon retired in the same close season.

===Clough without Taylor (1982–1993)===
Anderlecht beat Forest in the 1983–84 UEFA Cup semi-finals in controversial circumstances. Several contentious refereeing decisions went against Forest. Over a decade later, it emerged that before the match, referee Emilio Guruceta Muro had received a £27,000 &quot;loan&quot; from Anderlecht&#x27;s chairman Constant Vanden Stock. Anderlecht went unpunished until 1997, when UEFA banned the club from European competitions for one year. Guruceta Muro died in a car crash in 1987.

Forest beat Sheffield Wednesday on penalties in the Football League Centenary Tournament final in April 1988 after drawing 0–0. Forest finished third in the league in 1988 and made the 1987–88 FA Cup semi-finals. Stuart Pearce won the first of his five successive selections for the PFA Team of the Year.

On 18 January 1989, Clough joined the fray of a City Ground pitch invasion by hitting two of his own team&#x27;s fans when on the pitch. The football authorities responded with a fine and touchline ban for Clough. The match, against QPR in the League Cup, finished 5–2 to Forest.

Forest beat Everton 4–3 after extra time in the 1989 Full Members Cup final, then came back to beat Luton Town 3–1 in the 1989 Football League Cup final. This set Forest up for a unique treble of domestic cup wins, but tragedy struck a week after the League Cup win. Forest and Liverpool met for the second season in a row in the FA Cup semi-finals. The Hillsborough disaster claimed the lives of 97 Liverpool fans. The match was abandoned after six minutes. When the emotional replay took place, Forest struggled as Liverpool won 3–1. Despite these trophy wins, and a third-place finish in the First Division, Forest were unable to compete in the UEFA Cup, as English clubs were still banned from European competitions following the Heysel Stadium Disaster. Des Walker won the first of his four successive selections for the PFA Team of the Year.

Nigel Jemson scored as Forest beat Oldham Athletic 1–0 to retain the League Cup in 1990. English clubs were re-admitted to Europe for the following season, but only in limited numbers, and Forest&#x27;s League Cup win again did not see them qualify. The only UEFA Cup place that season went to league runners-up Aston Villa.

Brian Clough reached his only FA Cup final in 1991 after countless replays and postponements in the third, fourth and fifth rounds. Up against Tottenham Hotspur, Forest took the lead from a Pearce free kick, but Spurs equalised to take the game to extra-time, ultimately winning 2–1 after an own goal by Walker. Roy Keane declared himself fit to play in the final and was selected in preference to Steve Hodge; years later, Keane admitted he had not actually been fit to play, hence his insignificant role in the final.

In the summer of 1991, Millwall&#x27;s league top scorer Teddy Sheringham became Forest&#x27;s record signing, for a fee of £2.1 million. That season, Forest beat Southampton 3–2 after extra time in the Full Members Cup final, but lost the League Cup final 1–0 to Manchester United thanks to a Brian McClair goal. This meant that Forest had played in seven domestic cup finals in five seasons, winning five of them. Forest finished eighth in the league that season to earn a place in the new FA Premier League.

Walker transferred to Sampdoria during the summer of 1992. On 16 August 1992, Forest beat Liverpool 1–0 at home in the first-ever Premier League game to be televised live, with Sheringham scoring the only goal of the match. A week later, Sheringham moved to Tottenham. Forest&#x27;s form slumped, and Brian Clough&#x27;s 18-year managerial reign ended in May 1993 with Forest relegated from the inaugural Premier League. The final game of that season was away at Ipswich. Forest lost 2–1 with Clough&#x27;s son, Nigel, scoring the final goal of his father&#x27;s reign. Relegation was followed by Keane&#x27;s £3.75 million British record fee transfer to Manchester United.

===Frank Clark (1993–1996)===
Frank Clark from Forest&#x27;s 1979 European Cup winning team returned to the club in May 1993, succeeding Brian Clough as manager. Clark&#x27;s previous greatest management success was promotion from the Fourth Division with Leyton Orient in 1989. Clark convinced Stuart Pearce to remain at the club and also signed Stan Collymore, Lars Bohinen and Colin Cooper. Clark brought an immediate return to the Premier League when the club finished Division One runners-up at the end of the 1993–94 season.

Forest finished third in 1994–95 and qualified for the UEFA Cup – their first entry to European competition in the post-Heysel era. Collymore then transferred in the 1995–96 close season to Liverpool for a national record fee of £8.5million. Forest reached the 1995–96 UEFA Cup quarter-finals, the furthest an English team reached in UEFA competition that season. They finished ninth in the league.

The 1996–97 season quickly became a relegation battle. Clark left the club in December.

===Stuart Pearce and Dave Bassett (1997–1999)===
34-year-old captain Stuart Pearce was installed as player-manager on a temporary basis just before Christmas in 1996 and he inspired a brief upturn in the club&#x27;s fortunes. However, in March 1997 he was replaced on a permanent basis by Dave Bassett and left the club that summer after 12 years. Forest were unable to avoid relegation and finished the season in bottom place. They won promotion back to the Premier League at the first attempt, being crowned Division One champions in 1997–98. Bassett was sacked in January 1999, with Ron Atkinson replacing him.

===Into the 21st century below the top-flight (1999–2012)===
Ron Atkinson was unable to prevent Forest from once again slipping back into Division One, and announced his retirement from football management when Forest&#x27;s relegation was confirmed on 24 April 1999, with three weeks of the Premier League season still to play.

Former England captain David Platt succeeded Atkinson and spent approximately £12 million on players in the space of two seasons, including the Italian veterans Moreno Mannini, Salvatore Matrecano and Gianluca Petrachi. However, Forest could only finish 14th in Platt&#x27;s first season and 11th in his second. He departed in July 2001 to manage the England U21 side and was succeeded by youth team manager Paul Hart.

 Now faced with huge debts, which reduced Forest&#x27;s ability to sign new players, they finished 16th in Hart&#x27;s first season in charge. By December 2001, Forest were reported as losing over £100,000 every week, and their financial outlook was worsened by the collapse of ITV Digital, which left Forest and many other Football League clubs in severe financial difficulties. Despite the off-field difficulties, Forest finished 2002–03 in sixth place and qualified for the play-offs, where they lost to Sheffield United in the semi-finals. A poor league run the following season, following the loss of several key players, led to the sacking of Hart in February 2004 with Forest in danger of relegation. The decision was unpopular with certain quarters of the fanbase and Hart was described as a &quot;scapegoat&quot;.

Joe Kinnear was subsequently appointed and led the club to a secure 14th place in the final league table. The 2004–05 season saw Forest drop into the relegation zone once more, leading to Kinnear&#x27;s resignation in December 2004. Mick Harford took temporary charge of Forest over Christmas, before Gary Megson was appointed in the new year. Megson had already won two promotions to the Premier League with his previous club West Bromwich Albion, having arrived at the club when they were in danger of going down to Division Two, but failed to stave off relegation as the club ended the season second from bottom in 23rd place, becoming the first European Cup-winners ever to fall into their domestic third division.

In Forest&#x27;s first season in the English third tier in 54 years, a 3–0 defeat at Oldham Athletic in February 2006 led to the departure of Megson by &quot;mutual consent&quot; leaving the club mid-table only four points above the relegation zone. Frank Barlow and Ian McParland took temporary charge for the remainder of the 2005–06 season, engineering a six-match winning run and remaining unbeaten in ten games, the most notable result a 7–1 win over Swindon Town. Forest took 28 points from a possible 39 under the two, narrowly missing out on a play-off place, as they finished in 7th place.

Colin Calderwood, previously of Northampton Town, was appointed as Forest&#x27;s new manager in May 2006. He was their 12th new manager to be appointed since the retirement of Brian Clough 13 years earlier, and went on to become Forest&#x27;s longest-serving manager since Frank Clark. The Calderwood era was ultimately one of rebuilding, and included the club&#x27;s first promotion in a decade. In his first season, he led the club to the play-offs, having squandered a 7-point lead at the top of League One which had been amassed by November 2006. Forest eventually succumbed to a shock 5–4 aggregate defeat in the semi-finals against Yeovil Town; they had taken a 2–0 lead in the first leg at Huish Park, but were then beaten 5–2 on their own soil by the Somerset club. Calderwood achieved automatic promotion in his second year at the club, following an impressive run which saw Forest win six out of their last seven games of the season, culminating in a dramatic final 3–2 win against Yeovil Town at the City Ground. Forest kept a league record of 24 clean sheets out of 46 games, proving to be the foundation for their return to the second tier of English football and leaving them just one more promotion away from a return to the Premier League.

However, Calderwood&#x27;s side struggled to adapt to life in the Championship in the 2008–09 campaign and having been unable to steer Forest out of the relegation zone, Calderwood was sacked following a Boxing Day 4–2 defeat to the Championship&#x27;s bottom club Doncaster Rovers.

Under the temporary stewardship of John Pemberton, Forest finally climbed out of the relegation zone, having beaten Norwich City 3–2. Billy Davies, who had taken Forest&#x27;s local rivals Derby County into the Premier League two seasons earlier, was confirmed as the new manager on 1 January 2009 and watched Pemberton&#x27;s side beat Manchester City 3–0 away in the FA Cup, prior to taking official charge. Under Davies, Forest stretched their unbeaten record in all competitions following Calderwood&#x27;s sacking to six matches, including five wins. He also helped them avoid relegation as they finished 19th in the Championship, securing survival with one game to go.

Forest spent most of the 2009–10 campaign in a top-three position, putting together an unbeaten run of 19 league games, winning 12 home league games in a row (a club record for successive home wins in a single season), going unbeaten away from home from the beginning of the season until 30 January 2010 (a run spanning 13 games) whilst also claiming memorable home victories over local rivals Derby County and Leicester City. The club finished third, missing out on automatic promotion, and in the two-legged play-off semi-final were beaten by Blackpool, 2–1 away and 4–3 in the home leg, the club&#x27;s first defeat at home since losing to the same opposition in September 2009.
The 2010–11 season saw Forest finish in sixth place in the Championship table with 75 points, putting them into a play-off campaign for the fourth time in the space of eight years. Promotion was yet again to elude Forest, as they were beaten over two legs by eventual play-off final winners Swansea City. Having drawn the first leg 0–0 at the City Ground, they were eventually beaten 3–1 in the second leg.

In June 2011, Billy Davies had his contract terminated, and was replaced as manager by Steve McClaren, who signed a three-year contract. Forest started the 2011–12 season with several poor results and after a 5–1 defeat away to Burnley, David Pleat and Bill Beswick left the club&#x27;s coaching setup. Less than a week later, following a home defeat to Birmingham City, McClaren resigned, and chairman Nigel Doughty announced that he intended to resign at the end of the season. In October 2011, Nottingham Forest underwent several changes. These changes included the appointment of Frank Clark as new chairman of the club and also that of Steve Cotterill, replacing the recently departed Steve McClaren.

 Nigel Doughty, owner and previous chairman of the club, died on 4 February 2012, having been involved with the club since the late 1990s, with many estimating his total contribution as being in the region of £100 million.

===Al-Hasawi era (2012–2017)===
The Al-Hasawi family from Kuwait purchased the club in July 2012. They told the press that they had a long-term vision for the club based on a 3–5 year plan, and after interviewing several potential new managers, appointed Sean O&#x27;Driscoll, formerly the manager at Doncaster Rovers and Crawley Town, as the manager on 19 July 2012. He was known for playing an attractive brand of passing football (which had taken Doncaster Rovers into the league&#x27;s second tier for the first time since the 1950s) and what football fans would consider the Forest way. O&#x27;Driscoll had spent five months at the City Ground as coach under Steve Cotterill in the 2011–12 season.

By 15 December 2012, after the team&#x27;s 0–0 draw away to Brighton, Forest sat in ninth position with 33 points, just three points off the play-off positions. On the same weekend, the club announced that Omar Al-Hasawi had stepped down for personal reasons and Fawaz Al-Hasawi, the majority shareholder with 75%, had taken the position, with his brother Abdulaziz Al-Hasawi holding a 20% share and his cousin Omar Al-Hasawi holding a 5% share.

On 26 December 2012, O&#x27;Driscoll was sacked following a 4–2 victory over Leeds United, with the club stating their intentions of a change ahead of the January transfer window and hopes of appointing a manager with Premier League experience, eventually hiring Alex McLeish. Chief executive Mark Arthur as well as scout Keith Burt and club ambassador Frank Clark were dismissed in January 2013. On 5 February 2013, Forest and McLeish parted company by mutual agreement after 40 days of cooperation. Forest supporters and pundits alike registered their concern for the state of the club, with journalist Pat Murphy describing the situation as a &quot;shambles&quot;.
Two days after McLeish&#x27;s departure, the club re-appointed Billy Davies as manager, having been sacked as the team&#x27;s manager twenty months previously. His first match in charge was a draw, followed by a run of 10 undefeated games. In March 2014, the club terminated Davies&#x27;s employment, following a 5–0 defeat by Derby County. After initially rejecting the job in March 2014, fans favourite Stuart Pearce was named the man to replace Billy Davies, taking over from caretaker manager Gary Brazil. He signed a two-year contract commencing on 1 July 2014. Pearce led Forest to an unbeaten start to the season but failed to keep up the form. He was sacked in February 2015 and replaced by another former Forest player, Dougie Freedman.

Another mid-table finish meant that Forest began the 2015–16 season still in the Championship and now in their 17th season away from the Premier League. On 13 March 2016, Freedman was sacked, following a 3–0 defeat at home to Sheffield Wednesday, and Paul Williams was then appointed as temporary manager. Former Boulogne, Valenciennes, Real Sociedad, and Rennes head coach Philippe Montanier was appointed on a two-year contract on 27 June 2016 becoming the club&#x27;s first manager from outside the British isles, but was sacked after fewer than seven months in charge. Mark Warburton was named as the club&#x27;s new manager on 14 March 2017. Forest narrowly avoided relegation on the final day of the 2016–17 season, where a 3–0 home victory against Ipswich Town ensured their safety at the expense of Blackburn Rovers.

===Evangelos Marinakis and Premier League return (2017–present)===
On 18 May 2017, Evangelos Marinakis completed his takeover of Nottingham Forest, bringing an end to Al-Hasawi&#x27;s reign as Forest owner. Incumbent manager Mark Warburton was sacked on 31 December 2017 following a 1–0 home defeat to struggling Sunderland, with a record of one win in seven. He was replaced by Spaniard Aitor Karanka, who arrived on 8 January 2018, immediately after caretaker manager Gary Brazil had masterminded a 4–2 home win over holders Arsenal in the third round of the FA Cup. Karanka made 10 new signings during the January transfer window, and following a 17th-place finish, he made 14 new signings during the summer transfer window and the following season results improved. Despite a strong league position, Karanka left his position on 11 January 2019 after requesting to be released from his contract. He was replaced with former Republic of Ireland boss Martin O&#x27;Neill four days later. O&#x27;Neill was sacked in June after reportedly falling out with some of the senior first team players, and was replaced with Sabri Lamouchi on the same day. In Lamouchi&#x27;s first season in charge, despite spending most of the season in the playoffs, Forest dropped to seventh place on the final day. On 6 October 2020, Lamouchi was sacked by the club following a poor start to the 2020–21 season. He was replaced by former Brighton manager Chris Hughton. After an ultimately unsuccessful 11 months in charge, Hughton was sacked on 16 September 2021 after failing to win any of the club&#x27;s opening seven games of the 2021–22 season.

Forest chairman Nicholas Randall had initially promised that Forest planned to return to playing European football within five seasons, and yet poor transfers and a toxic club culture meant that Forest remained in the Championship four years into the Marinakis era. In the summer of 2021, structural changes were made at the club to try and correct the previous mistakes. Forest appointed Dane Murphy as Chief Executive, and George Syrianos was brought in as head of recruitment to bring about a more analytics driven transfer policy. The Forest hierarchy committed to avoiding the &quot;short-termism&quot; of previous windows by no longer signing players for more than £18,000 a week and mostly targeting younger signings that could be sold for a profit.

On 21 September 2021, Forest announced the appointment of Steve Cooper as the club&#x27;s new head coach. Cooper inspired a turnaround in form, arriving with the club in last place yet having them in 7th at Christmas, and all the way up in 4th by the end of the season, qualifying Forest for the playoffs for the first time since the 2010–11 season. In the 2022 Championship play-off semi-final, Forest defeated Sheffield United on penalties to advance to the final against Huddersfield Town, who they beat 1–0 at Wembley Stadium, and were promoted to the Premier League for the first time since the 1998–99 season. Having entered the Premier League with a depleted squad after the promotion, in the leadup to the next season Forest signed 21 players for the first team squad. This was a British transfer record. The club record fee was also broken multiple times, and the last such occasion in the transfer window was when Morgan Gibbs-White joined the club for £25 million with a potential to rise to £42 million subject to performance.

On 7 October 2022, after five straight defeats, the club announced Cooper had signed a new three-year contract. Results improved temporarily, but in early April, after another poor run beset with injuries, Marinakis was forced to again say he had confidence in the manager. “We have all been disappointed with recent performances, and it is very clear that a lot of hard work needs to be done to address this urgently. Results and performances must improve immediately&quot;, he said in a statement.

On 11 April 2023, with the club in the relegation zone, sporting director Filippo Giraldi was sacked after six months in the job.

On 20 May 2023, Nottingham Forest sealed their Premier League status for the following season with a 1–0 home victory over Arsenal, which also confirmed the title for Manchester City. Forest collected 11 points from their last six games.

On 19 December 2023, the club sacked Cooper; he was replaced by previous Al-Ittihad manager Nuno Espírito Santo. On 15 January 2024, Nottingham Forest was charged with breaching Premier League profit and sustainability rules in their accounts for 2022–23. On 18 March 2024, the club was docked four points, pushing them into the relegation places, after an independent commission found Forest&#x27;s 2022–23 losses breached the £61m threshold by £34.5m. The club appealed against the penalty, but their appeal was rejected.

Nottingham Forest secured their survival in the Premier League for the 2023–24 season with a 2–1 victory over Burnley at Turf Moor on 19 May 2024. Their overall score of 32 points in the league is the lowest for a team that avoided relegation.

==Club identity==
===Crest and colours===
Nottingham Forest have worn red since the club&#x27;s foundation in 1865. At the meeting in the Clinton Arms which established Nottingham Forest as a football club, the committee also passed a resolution that the team colours should be &#x27;Garibaldi red&#x27;. This decision was made in honour of Giuseppe Garibaldi, the Italian patriot who was the leader of the redshirts volunteers. At this time, clubs identified themselves more by their headgear than their shirts and a dozen red caps with tassels were duly purchased, making Forest the first club to &#x27;officially&#x27; wear red, a colour that has since been adopted by a significant number of others. Forest&#x27;s kit is the reason behind Arsenal&#x27;s choice of red, the club having donated a full set of red kits to Arsenal following their foundation (as Woolwich Arsenal) in 1886. Forest&#x27;s tour of South America in 1905 inspired Argentine club Independiente to adopt red as their club colour, after club&#x27;s President Arístides Langone described the tourists as looking like &quot;diablos rojos&quot; (&quot;red devils&quot;), which would become Independiente&#x27;s nickname.

The first club crest used by Forest was the city arms of Nottingham, which was first used on kits in 1947. The current club badge was introduced in 1974, following a competition in 1973 to design a new badge. The winning design was by Trent Polytechnic graphic design lecturer David Lewis. The logo has been incorrectly reported as being the brainchild of manager Brian Clough. However, he did not arrive at the club until the following year. Forest have two stars above the club badge to commemorate its European Cup victories in 1979 and 1980.

===Nomenclature===
The club has garnered many nicknames over time. Historically, the nickname of &quot;the Reds&quot; was used, as was &quot;Garibaldis&quot;. &quot;The Forest&quot; or the simpler &quot;Forest&quot; – as used on the club crest – is commonly used. Another, lesser-used, nickname referring to the club is the &quot;Tricky Trees&quot;.

==Stadium==
=== City Ground ===

Since 1898, Nottingham Forest have played their home games at the City Ground in West Bridgford, on the banks of the River Trent. Prior to moving to the City Ground, Forest played their home games at Forest Recreation Ground, then Trent Bridge, and finally the purpose-built Town Ground. Since 1994, the City Ground has been all-seater, a preparation that was made in time for the ground to be a venue for Euro 96, and currently has a capacity of 30,404.

The City Ground is 300 yards away from Notts County&#x27;s Meadow Lane stadium on the opposite side of the Trent, meaning the two grounds are the closest professional football stadia geographically in England. In 1898 the City Ground was within the boundaries of Nottingham, which had been given city status the year before and gave rise to the name of the stadium. However, a boundary change in the 1950s means that the City Ground now stands just outside of the city&#x27;s boundaries in the town of West Bridgford.

On 28 February 2019, Nottingham Forest announced plans to redevelop the City Ground and surrounding area, including the &quot;creation of a new, world-class Peter Taylor Stand&quot;. It is expected this will increase the capacity of the stadium to 38,000, making it the largest football stadium in the East Midlands. The club was hopeful that building work could begin at the end of the 2019-20 season, but the development was put on hold due to &quot;delays in the planning process&quot;. In September 2022, Rushcliffe Borough Council&#x27;s planning committee approved the club&#x27;s request for planning permission.

=== Ground history ===
==Local rivals, derbies and supporters==

Whilst Notts County is the closest professional football club geographically, Forest have remained at least one division higher since the 1994–95 season and the club&#x27;s fiercest rivalry is with Derby County, located 14 miles away. The rivalry stems from the 1898 FA Cup final when Forest caused a major upset, beating strong favourites Derby County 3–1. The two clubs contest the East Midlands derby, a fixture which has taken on even greater significance since the inception of the Brian Clough Trophy in 2007. As of February 2024, the two clubs have met on 111 occasions, with Forest winning 43 times and Derby winning 38 times with 30 games drawn.

Leicester City were widely considered to be Forest&#x27;s main East Midlands rivals prior to Brian Clough&#x27;s success at both Derby and Forest. The rivalry is now most fiercely felt by fans who live around the Leicestershire-Nottinghamshire border.

Forest&#x27;s other regional rival is Sheffield United, based in the neighbouring county of South Yorkshire, a rivalry which has roots in the UK miners&#x27; strike of 1984–85 when the miners of South Yorkshire walked out on long strikes but some Nottinghamshire miners, who insisted on holding a ballot, continued to work. The 2003 Championship play-off semi-final between the two clubs, in which Sheffield United finished as 5–4 aggregate winners, also fuelled the rivalry. They met again in the 2022 play-offs, with Forest coming out on top this time, and in 2023–24 faced each other in the Premier League for the first time since 1993, with Forest winning 2–1 at home, and 3-1 away.

<text>The Battle of Uclés (13 January 1809) saw an Imperial French corps led by Marshal Claude Perrin Victor attack a Spanish force under Francisco Javier Venegas. The French easily crushed their outnumbered foes, capturing over half of the Spanish infantry. Uclés is located in the province of Cuenca east of Tarancón and southeast of Madrid. The action occurred during what is called the Peninsular War in English-speaking countries and the Spanish War of Independence in Spain. The war was part of a larger struggle known as the Napoleonic Wars.

Emperor Napoleon invaded Spain with a huge army in late 1808, scattered the Spanish forces, and seized Madrid. However, the appearance of a British army commanded by John Moore caused the French emperor to order his army to pursue the British into northwest Spain. With their enemies spread thin, the Spanish armies began to revive. In late December 1808, the &quot;Army of the Center&quot; led by Pedro de Alcántara Álvarez de Toledo, 13th Duke of the Infantado advanced slowly toward Madrid, causing alarm among the scanty French forces guarding the capital. The cautious Infantado sent his lieutenant Venegas with a strong vanguard to annoy the French. After Venegas won a minor action at Tarancón, Victor concentrated his corps and marched against him in mid-January 1809. Without instructions or support from Infantado, Venegas unwisely tried to hold a strong position at Uclés. Victor overwhelmed the Spanish defenders with one division and herded many of them into the arms of his second division which had marched around their flank. Gathering up Venegas&#x27; survivors, Infantado led his crippled army into the mountains but not before losing much of his artillery. Blamed for the fiasco, Infantado was relieved of command. The next action in the area was the Battle of Ciudad Real in March.

==Background==
After the Dos de Mayo Uprising and the subsequent disaster at the Battle of Bailén, the French occupying armies in Spain were forced to pull back behind the Ebro River in the northeast. Shocked and enraged at the turn of events, Napoleon ordered 130,000 veteran soldiers to march into Spain. The French emperor planned to unite the reinforcements with the troops already there and lead them to conquer Spain and Portugal once and for all. Meanwhile, the Spanish people had been deceived by their relatively easy successes and believed that the struggle was almost over. The Spanish generals and politicians began to squabble among themselves. By 10 October 1808, Napoleon had 244,125 soldiers massed in eight army corps, the cavalry reserve, the Imperial Guard, and other formations for the purpose of conquering Spain. In November 1808, the Napoleonic armies struck with crushing force and the Spanish defenses unraveled in battles at Burgos, Espinosa, Tudela, and Somosierra. On 1 December, Madrid meekly capitulated to Napoleon. The French emperor reinstalled his brother Joseph Bonaparte as king and began rewriting the laws. He intended to send armies to seize Seville in the south and reconquer Portugal at the first opportunity. However, a new enemy appeared on the scene to upset Napoleon&#x27;s plans.

On 11 December 1808, General John Moore led a British army numbering 22,500 foot soldiers, 2,500 horsemen, and 66 artillery pieces northeast from Salamanca. Moore had written to a fellow general, &quot;if the bubble bursts and Madrid falls, we shall have to run for it.&quot; Soon after, Moore learned that Napoleon had seized Madrid and that over 200,000 Imperial French troops were in the field. Nevertheless, the British general decided to strike at Marshal Nicolas Soult&#x27;s isolated II Corps in the north of Spain. When the British cavalry routed Soult&#x27;s horsemen at the Battle of Sahagún on 21 December, the French marshal was completely surprised. Meanwhile, Napoleon found out what was going on and ordered 80,000 troops to march north to annihilate the British.

Getting news of the avalanche coming his way, Moore led his army toward Corunna in northwest Spain. Though ultimately the British army was safely evacuated, Moore was slain at the Battle of Corunna on 16 January 1809 and 5,000 of his soldiers died during the mid-winter retreat. Because of his unsuccessful effort to destroy Moore&#x27;s army, Napoleon&#x27;s plans for conquering Spain and Portugal were temporarily sidetracked. Napoleon personally quit Spain on 19 January 1809 and never returned. By 23 January he was in Paris, preparing for the next war with the Austrian Empire. Napoleon had predicted his conquest of Spain would cost 12,000 men, but the actual death toll from battle and disease through mid-January 1809 may have been as high as 75,000. The emperor hoped that his brother Joseph and his marshals would soon complete the conquest of the Iberian Peninsula. This hope proved to be a vain one.

==Operations==
The month of December saw General of Division Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr drub the Spanish forces of Captain General Juan Miguel de Vives y Feliu at the Battle of Molins de Rey while Marshal Jean Lannes began the Second Siege of Zaragoza. With Napoleon and his main field army away chasing Moore, the Imperial troops holding Madrid were too weak to mount any offensives. In total, there were 28,000 infantry, 8,000 cavalry, and 90 guns in Marshal Claude Perrin Victor&#x27;s I Corps, Marshal François Joseph Lefebvre&#x27;s IV Corps, and the cavalry divisions of Generals of Division Antoine Lasalle, Marie Victor de Latour-Maubourg, and Édouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud. Not counted was King Joseph&#x27;s Royal Guard consisting of four battalions and one cavalry regiment of Frenchmen plus two small regiments of Spanish deserters.

The cavalry formed the outer line of defense. Latour-Maubourg posted a cavalry brigade each in Tarancón, Ocaña, and Madridejos. To the west, Milhaud&#x27;s troopers patrolled the area around Talavera de la Reina. Farthest west were Lasalle&#x27;s horsemen watching Almaraz where there was an important bridge across the Tagus River. Victor defended Aranjuez with General of Division Eugène-Casimir Villatte&#x27;s division while Lefebvre held Talavera with the divisions of Generals of Division Horace François Sébastiani and Jean-Baptiste Cyrus de Valence. The 55th Line Infantry Regiment of General of Division Jean-Joseph, Marquis Dessolles&#x27;s absent reserve division was posted at Guadalajara. Aside from the Royal Guards, Madrid was garrisoned by General of Division François Amable Ruffin with an I Corps division and General of Division Jean François Leval with a IV Corps division.

The &quot;Army of the Center&quot; ended its retreat at Cuenca on 10 December 1808. Its new commander General Pedro de Alcántara Álvarez de Toledo, 13th Duke of the Infantado allowed his soldiers to rest but was forced to execute three soldiers. One, a lieutenant had refused to march and positioned his artillery battery to fire on the troops who were obeying orders. The remnant of the 1st Division was sent home to Valencia province to recruit, while the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Divisions were reorganized into four divisions including a Vanguard and a Reserve. Many low-strength line regiments were consolidated from three battalions into one or two. Stragglers and reinforcements swelled the ranks. The soldiers&#x27; spirits rose when a brigade under General Conde de Alacha Lilli marched into camp, having escaped from Napoleon&#x27;s armies. Hearing that the emperor had gone off to the north, Infantado decided to launch an offensive toward Madrid before his reorganization was completed.

==Spanish offensive==
On 25 December 1808, Infantado sent General Francisco Javier Venegas with the Vanguard and most of the cavalry to seize Tarancón while Brigadier General Antonio Senra and 4,000 soldiers moved on Aranjuez. Senra found Villatte&#x27;s division at Aranjuez and declined to attack, an action for which he was harshly criticized by Infantado. Meanwhile, Venegas managed to encircle General of Brigade André Thomas Perreimond and his dragoon brigade in Tarancón. At the last moment, the French detected what was afoot and hurriedly saddled up their horses. Perreimond decided to break out at once. When the dragoons charged the Spanish force that had gotten behind the town, the infantry were forced to form squares. Perreimond&#x27;s troopers then rode between the squares to safety, but not before 50 to 60 saddles were emptied. Because the Spanish cavalry was late into action, the two dragoon regiments got away without further damage.

Farther to the west, on December 24 Lefebvre marched to seize the bridge at Almaraz as instructed. His soldiers captured the bridge and four cannons in a coup, dispersing the Spanish defenders. At this time, the marshal made a remarkable error. Leaving only Lasalle&#x27;s cavalry and two battalions on the Tagus, he marched northeast to Ávila, ignoring repeated instructions from King Joseph to desist. Arriving at Ávila on 5 January, Lefebvre&#x27;s corps was completely removed from the defensive lines around Madrid. Infuriated with his disobedient subordinate, Napoleon removed Lefebvre from command and gave the IV Corps to Sébastiani.
With the IV Corps out of position, revolts breaking out, and the &quot;Army of the Center&quot; threatening Madrid, Joseph and his adviser Marshal Jean-Baptiste Jourdan were in a panic. Only Villatte and Latour-Maubourg with 9,000 soldiers stood between Infantado and the capital. But, instead of pressing his advantage, the Spanish commander became inert between 26 December and 11 January. Infantado seems to have spent his time concocting fantastic strategical schemes while leaving his lieutenant Venegas without instructions. To support the &quot;Army of the Center&quot;, a 6,000-man Spanish division under General Marquis del Palacio moved north from the Sierra Morena to Villaharta.

While Infantado dithered, Joseph and Jourdan moved swiftly against the local insurrections. The 27th Light Infantry put down the rebellion in Chinchón with extreme brutality; all the men in the town were massacred. Colmenar Viejo suffered also, with numerous inhabitants being executed. Joseph ordered Victor to shift east from Aranjuez to Arganda del Rey to block the road from Tarancón. On 8 January, the division of Dessolles arrived in Madrid followed in two days by the return of the IV Corps from Ávila. These heavy reinforcements allowed Napoleon&#x27;s defensive scheme around Madrid to be reestablished. Reinforced by the Dutch Brigade, Leval&#x27;s division was sent to garrison Talavera while Valence&#x27;s division was ordered to hold Toledo. The divisions of Dessolles and Sébastiani became the Madrid garrison. Victor was sent Ruffin&#x27;s division as a reinforcement and ordered to attack.

==Battle==
===Prelude===
Victor marched forth on 12 January with 12,000 infantry and 3,500 cavalry in the divisions of Ruffin, Villatte, Latour-Maubourg, and the I Corps light cavalry. Learning of the enemy&#x27;s approach, Venegas withdrew from Tarancón to Uclés where he was joined by Antonio Senra&#x27;s brigade. He requested further instructions from the commander of the &quot;Army of the Center&quot;, but none were forthcoming. Instead, Infantado sent three or four battalions of reinforcements and advised his lieutenant that he was on the way. However, he did not give any date for his appearance. Venegas had reservations about offering battle to Victor. But, perhaps swayed by the favorable defensive position at Uclés, he decided to stand his ground with approximately 9,500 foot soldiers, 1,800 horsemen, and five cannons, one of which was broken down. Though some of the regiments were veterans of Bailén, many of the units had shaky morale. 

===Forces===

On 11 January 1809, Infantado&#x27;s 21,216-strong army consisted of the 3,929-man Vanguard under Major General José María de la Cueva, 14th Duke of Alburquerque, the 4,295-strong Reserve led by Lieutenant General Manuel la Peña, the 5,121-man 1st Division commanded by Lieutenant General Antonio Malet, Marqués de Coupigny, the 5,288-strong 2nd Division under Major General Conde de Orgaz, approximately 2,800 cavalry, 383 sappers, and 386 artillerists. Venegas&#x27; force was a collection of units drawn piecemeal from all five major units of the &quot;Army of the Center&quot;. The Vanguard contributed 2,848 men, the Reserve 1,634, the 1st Division 2,804, the 2nd Division 1,917, and the cavalry 1,814. There were also 383 sappers and about 100 artillerists. Gaston Bodart stated that the Spanish took 11,300 men into battle. Historian David Gates wrote that there were 11,980 Spanish troops, including 9,500 infantry, 2,000 cavalry, and 480 gunners with 4 guns.

According to Charles Oman and Digby Smith, the French had 12,000 infantry and 3,500 cavalry. Oman also asserted that the I Corps artillery had 48 field pieces manned by 1,523 gunners. Smith stated that there were four foot artillery batteries, two per infantry division, plus two additional horse artillery batteries at Uclés. The three dragoon brigades were commanded by Generals of Brigade Perreimond, Ignace Laurent d&#x27;Oullenbourg, and Alexandre, vicomte Digeon. Gates stated that Victor commanded 16,300 men at Uclés. Of these, Ruffin led 5,000 troops, Villatte 7,000, Latour-Maubourg 2,500, General of Brigade Louis-Chrétien Carrière, Baron de Beaumont 1,300, and the artillery 500 with 32 guns. Bodart wrote that the French engaged 15,500 men in the battle. General of Division Pierre Belon Lapisse&#x27;s 2nd Division was on detached duty.

===Action===
Venegas strung out his soldiers along a northeast to southwest ridge. Three infantry battalions and four cavalry regiments formed an advance guard to watch the approach of the French from Tribaldos village. Four battalions defended the town of Uclés in the center with remaining cavalry and the four guns in front. Eight battalions held the right flank, while six battalions deployed on the left flank. Venegas held only a single battalion in reserve; the rest of his units formed a single overextended line. On 13 January, Victor marched from Tarancón at dawn in two columns. Victor with Villatte&#x27;s and most of Latour-Maubourg&#x27;s divisions took the right-hand road, which was more direct. Ruffin&#x27;s division and some cavalry took the left-hand road. Villatte quickly drove the advance guard out of Tribaldos; it fell back to the main Spanish position. After getting a good look at the Spanish line, Victor ordered Ruffin to sweep wide to the left and take Venegas in right flank and rear.
Victor deployed Villatte&#x27;s division and the cavalry, a total of about 7,000 foot soldiers and 2,500 horsemen. In the center, a battery unlimbered and began bombarding the Spanish cavalry and Uclés. The dragoons were posted behind the artillery. Meanwhile, the 94th and 95th Line under General of Brigade Jacques-Pierre-Louis Puthod made a wide sweep to the right. Ascending the end of the ridge where the slope was less steep, Puthod&#x27;s six battalions attacked the Spanish left flank and began driving it back. From his vantage point at the monastery in Uclés, Venegas ordered some units from the right flank to go to the assistance of his imperiled left. However, the French attack proceeded swiftly and crumpled up the Spanish left flank before the reinforcements could give any help. Puthod&#x27;s troops soon reached the walls of Uclés.

When Victor saw the success of his right wing, he ordered Villatte&#x27;s left wing brigade under General of Brigade Michel-Marie Pacthod to attack the Spanish right flank. Since many of the defending units had been sent to the left, Pacthod&#x27;s assault easily reached the top of the ridge. Shaken by the obvious reverse on the left flank, the right flank troops offered little resistance. Soon, Venegas&#x27;s entire force was retreating from the field. The cavalry seems to have fought hardly at all leaving only two or three battalions under General Pedro Agustín Girón to act as the rear guard. Meanwhile, Ruffin&#x27;s division lost its way and made a wider march than intended. Though Ruffin was late to the field, he and his troops fortuitously arrived squarely in the Spanish rear. Latour-Maubourg&#x27;s pursuing dragoons drove Venegas&#x27; hapless soldiers right into the arms of Ruffin&#x27;s nine battalions. The nimble Spanish cavalry largely escaped along with some left flank infantry, while Girón&#x27;s men broke out between two French regiments. But the majority of the Spanish foot soldiers were trapped and forced to surrender.

==Results==
The French captured four generals, 17 colonels, 306 lower-ranking officers, and 5,560 men for a total of 5,887 prisoners. The I Corps also seized four artillery pieces and 20 colors. In addition, the Spanish suffered losses of perhaps 1,000 killed and wounded. Victor admitted a loss of 150 though another source gave a total of 200 French casualties. Bodart wrote that the French sustained 200 casualties while inflicting 7,000 casualties on the Spanish. Despite their easy triumph, the French soldiery got out of control after the battle, sacking Uclés and murdering 69 civilians. In particular, monks were singled out for slaughter for allegedly firing on French soldiers. The prisoners were also treated cruelly, according to two French eyewitnesses. When the Spaniards were marched to Madrid, their captors shot down those who were unable to keep up; 30 or more men per day were put to death in this manner.

Meanwhile, Infantado with his remaining 9,000 soldiers set out from Cuenca on 12 January. By that evening he reached La Horcajada, which is east of Uclés. Continuing their advance on the 13th, Infantado&#x27;s men came across the remnants of Venegas&#x27; force and got word of the disaster. The army commander called for an immediate withdrawal to Cuenca. Gathering up his wagon train and supplies, Infantado abandoned his base and led his troops to Chinchilla de Monte-Aragón where he arrived on 20 January. However, the Spanish guns were delayed by bad weather and swollen streams. Protected by only one cavalry regiment, the artillery convoy was intercepted by Digeon&#x27;s brigade at Tórtola de Henares on the 18th. In all, 15 artillery pieces were seized by the French dragoons.

After occupying Cuenca, Victor determined that the &quot;Army of the Center&quot; was out of reach. The marshal then went looking for Palacios&#x27; division at Villaharta. When Palacios heard of the Uclés debacle, he withdrew to the Sierra Morena. Finding that his prey escaped, Victor occupied Madridejos. Deeming the Spanish people sufficiently cowed by the victory at Uclés, Napoleon finally allowed his brother Joseph to make a triumphal entry into his capital at Madrid. The spectacle occurred on 22 January after which King Joseph entered his palace. Under threat, Joseph&#x27;s Spanish subjects swore fealty to their new king. After marching to join Palacios at the Despeñaperros Pass, Infantado was removed from command for failing to support Venegas. General José de Urbina y Urbina, 3rd Conde de Cartaojal assumed command of the &quot;Army of the Center&quot;. The next action was the Battle of Ciudad Real on 27 March 1809.

<doc id="157296" wikidata="Q207658" url="?curid=157296" title="Brian Clough">
<text>Brian Howard Clough ( ; 21 March 1935 – 20 September 2004) was an English football player and manager, primarily known for his successes as a manager with Derby County and Nottingham Forest. He is one of four managers to have won the English league with two different clubs. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest managers of all time. Charismatic, outspoken and often controversial, his achievements with Derby and Forest, two clubs with little prior history of success, are rated among the greatest in football history. His teams were also noted for playing attractive football and for their good sportsmanship. Despite applying several times and being a popular choice for the job, he was never appointed England manager and has been dubbed the &quot;greatest manager England never had&quot;.

Clough played as a striker for Middlesbrough and Sunderland, scoring 251 league goals in 274 matches; he remains one of the Football League&#x27;s highest goalscorers. He won two England caps. He entered management after his playing career was ended by a serious injury at the age of 29. As a manager, Clough was closely associated with Peter Taylor, who served as his assistant manager at several clubs in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. He is also remembered for giving frequent radio and television interviews in which he made controversial remarks about players, other managers and the overall state of the game. In 1965, he took the manager&#x27;s job at Fourth Division Hartlepools United and appointed Peter Taylor as his assistant, the start of an enduring partnership that would bring them success at several clubs over the next two decades. In 1967, the duo moved on to Second Division Derby County who, in 1968–69, were promoted as Second Division champions and, three years later, crowned champions of England for the first time in the club&#x27;s history. In 1973, they reached the semi-finals of the European Cup. By this point, Clough&#x27;s relationship with chairman Sam Longson had deteriorated; he and Taylor resigned.

An eight-month spell in charge of Third Division club Brighton &amp; Hove Albion followed, before Clough (without Taylor) returned north in the summer of 1974 to become manager of Leeds United. This was widely regarded as a surprise appointment, given his previous outspoken criticism of the Leeds players and their manager Don Revie. He was sacked after just 44 days in the job, but within months, he had joined Second Division Nottingham Forest, where he was re-united with Taylor in the summer of 1976. In 1977, Forest were promoted to the top flight and the following season won the league title (the first in the club&#x27;s history), making Clough one of only four managers to have won the English league with two clubs. Forest also won two consecutive European Cups (in 1979 and 1980) and two League Cups (1978 and 1979), before Taylor retired in 1982. Clough stayed on as Forest manager for another decade and won two more League Cups (1989 and 1990) and reached the FA Cup final in 1991, but could not emulate his earlier successes. Forest were relegated from the Premier League in 1993, after which Clough retired from football.

==Childhood==
Brian Howard Clough was born on 21 March 1935 at 11 Valley Road, an inter-war council house in Grove Hill, Middlesbrough, North Riding of Yorkshire, He was the sixth of nine children of a local sweet shop worker, later sugar boiler and then manager. The eldest, Elizabeth, died on 11 February 1927 of septicaemia at the age of three. When talking of his childhood he said he &quot;adored it in all its aspects. If anyone should be grateful for their upbringing, for their mam and dad, I&#x27;m that person. I was the kid who came from a little part of paradise.&quot; On his upbringing in Middlesbrough, Clough claimed that it was &quot;not the most well-appointed place in the world, but to me it was heaven&quot;. &quot;Everything I have done, everything I&#x27;ve achieved, everything that I can think of that has directed and affected my life – apart from the drink – stemmed from my childhood. Maybe it was the constant sight of Mam, with eight children to look after, working from morning until night, working harder than you or I have ever worked.&quot;

Clough failed his Eleven-plus examination and attended Marton Grove Secondary Modern School. He later admitted in his autobiography, &quot;Walking on Water&quot;, that he had neglected his lessons in favour of sport, although at school he became Head Boy. He also said that cricket, rather than football, was his first love as a youngster, and that he would have rather scored a test century at Lord&#x27;s than a hat-trick at Wembley. He left school in 1950 without any qualifications, to work at ICI and did his national service in the RAF Regiment between 1953 and 1955.

== Playing career ==

Clough played for Great Broughton Juniors and, while working for ICI, Billingham Synthonia (scoring three goals in four games) before his national service in the RAF between 1953 and 1955. He combined playing football in the forces, though he was never selected for the RAF National team, and playing for the Boro third team when on leave.

===Middlesbrough===
Following this, he became a prolific striker for his home town club Middlesbrough since his debut in the 1955–56 season and an impressive 1956–57 season now as starter, scoring 204 goals in 222 league matches for Boro, including 40 or more goals in four consecutive seasons, being Division Two topscorer in two of them: 1958–59 and 1959–60. However, Clough also regularly submitted transfer requests since the 1957–58 season and had a tense relationship with some of his fellow players. He was especially irked by Boro&#x27;s leaky defence, which conceded goals as regularly as he scored them. In the 1960–61 season after a 6–6 draw against Charlton Athletic, Clough sarcastically asked his teammates how many goals they would have to score in order to win a match. He also publicly accused some of his teammates of betting against the team and deliberately letting in goals. While at Middlesbrough, Clough became acquainted with goalkeeper Peter Taylor, with whom he would later form a successful managerial partnership at several clubs. Clough played twice for the England national football team, against Wales on 17 October 1959 and Sweden on 28 October 1959, without scoring.

===Sunderland===

In July 1961, one of Clough&#x27;s transfer requests was finally accepted and he moved to Boro&#x27;s local rivals Sunderland for £55,000 scoring 34 goals in the 1961–62 season. With Sunderland, Clough scored a total of 63 goals in 74 matches. In the 1962–63 season, Clough had scored 24 league goals by December as Sunderland pushed for promotion. In a match against Bury at Roker Park on 26 December 1962, in icy conditions and torrential rain, Clough was put through on goal and collided with goalkeeper, Chris Harker. Clough tore the medial and cruciate ligaments in his knee, an injury which in that era usually ended a player&#x27;s career. He returned two years later, but could manage only three games and then retired from playing at the age of 29.

Clough&#x27;s manager at Sunderland was Alan Brown, a disciplinarian credited as a big influence on Clough. Brown inspired fear, imposed a strict code of conduct and would fine players for minor transgressions. He once upbraided Clough for talking to a friend during a training session. Such traits would later be adopted by Clough himself when he became a manager.

Of the players who have scored over 200 goals in the English leagues, Clough has the highest goals-per-game ratio of 0.916, and has the second highest ratio in the list that includes the Scottish leagues.

==Management career==

=== Hartlepools United===
After a short spell coaching the Sunderland youth team, in October 1965, Clough was offered the manager&#x27;s job at Hartlepools United (from 1977 the club became known as Hartlepool United). He accepted and immediately asked Peter Taylor (then managing non-league Burton Albion) to join him as his assistant. At the age of 30, Clough was then the youngest manager in the league. Hartlepools were perennial strugglers and had repeatedly had to apply for re-election to the Football League, having finished in the bottom two of the Fourth Division five times in the past six seasons. Such was the club&#x27;s perilous financial state in the 1965–66 season, Clough had to tour local pubs raising money to keep the club afloat and even applied for a coach driver&#x27;s licence to drive the team to away matches.

On 15 November 1966, the then chairman, Ernest Ord, who was known for playing mind games with managers, sacked Clough&#x27;s assistant Peter Taylor, claiming he could not afford to pay him anymore. Clough refused to accept it so Ord sacked him as well. However, there was a boardroom coup where the other board members refused to ratify the two sackings and which instead saw Ord ousted as chairman. Both Clough and Taylor were reinstated. Hartlepools&#x27; fortunes gradually improved and the club finished in a creditable eighth place in 1966–67. Their Hartlepools team featured three players who would play for Clough and Taylor at other clubs in the future: Les Green, who would be goalkeeper in Derby&#x27;s promotion-winning side of 1969, Tony Parry who Clough signed for Derby in 1972 in what is seen as a helpful gesture to his former club who needed funds from transfers and a 16-year-old John McGovern, who would later be signed by Clough at Derby County, Leeds United and Nottingham Forest, winning several major trophies in the process. On 14 May 1967, the two men then joined Second Division side Derby County as manager and assistant manager. They took charge on 1 June 1967. In the following season, Hartlepools were promoted for the first time in their history.

===Derby County===
Derby County had been rooted in the Second Division for a decade before Clough&#x27;s arrival, and had been outside the top flight for a further five years, their only major trophy being the FA Cup in 1946.

In Clough&#x27;s first season, the club finished one place lower than in the previous season, but he had started to lay the foundations for his future success by signing several new players, among them Roy McFarland, John O&#x27;Hare, John McGovern, Alan Hinton and Les Green. Of the inherited squad, 11 players departed and only four were retained: Kevin Hector, Alan Durban, Ron Webster and Colin Boulton. Clough also sacked the club secretary, the groundsman and the chief scout, along with two tea ladies he caught laughing after a Derby defeat. With the additional signings of Dave Mackay and Willie Carlin in 1968–69, Clough and Taylor&#x27;s management led Derby to become champions of the Second Division, establishing the club record of 22 matches without defeat on the way and the team was promoted to the First Division for the 1969–70 season.

Clough was universally seen as a hard but fair manager, who insisted on clean play from his players and brooked no stupid questions from the press. He insisted on being called &quot;Boss&quot; and earned great respect from his peers for his ability to turn a game to his and his team&#x27;s advantage. Derby&#x27;s first season back in the First Division saw them finish fourth, their best league finish for over twenty years, but, due to financial irregularities, the club was banned from Europe the following season and fined £10,000.

In 1970–71, the club finished ninth. In February 1971, Clough bolstered his squad by signing Colin Todd for a British record £175,000 on the same day Clough had denied that Derby were about to buy Todd. In the 1971–72 season, after tussling with Liverpool, Leeds United and Manchester City for the title, Derby finally topped the league table by one point after playing their final match, a 1–0 win over Liverpool. Manchester City did temporarily top the league after playing their last match, but had a slim chance of winning the title due to outstanding fixtures between the clubs directly below them. Peter Taylor took the players on holiday to Majorca as the clubs beneath them played their final matches. Clough was not with the squad, instead holidaying in the Isles of Scilly with his family and elderly parents. Both Liverpool and Leeds United had a chance to overtake Derby by winning their final matches (played a week later due to fixture congestion) but Leeds lost to Wolves and Liverpool drew at Arsenal, meaning Derby were league champions for the first time in their 88-year history. The team and management were on holiday when receiving the news they were champions.

====Feud with the Derby County board of directors====
In August 1972, Clough refused to go on an arranged pre-season tour of the Netherlands and West Germany unless he could take his family with him. Derby chairman Sam Longson told him that it was a working trip and not a holiday, so Clough put Taylor in charge of the tour instead and refused to go. The club did not contest the FA Charity Shield that year.

On 24 August 1972, Clough and Taylor signed David Nish from Leicester City for a then-record transfer fee of £225,000, without consulting the Derby board. Afterwards, Jack Kirkland, a director, warned Clough and Taylor there would be no more expensive buys like Nish. Then, in early September 1972, after the team had defeated Liverpool 2–1 at the Baseball Ground, Clough criticised the Derby County fans, stating that &quot;They started chanting only near the end when we were a goal in front. I want to hear them when we are losing. They are a disgraceful lot&quot;. In the same interview, Clough also verbally attacked the club&#x27;s board of directors for their policies. The following day, board chairman Sam Longson apologised to the fans and dissociated himself from Clough&#x27;s remarks.

That 1972–73 season, Derby failed to retain their title, finishing seventh, but reached the semi-finals of the European Cup in April 1973, when they were knocked out by Juventus 3–1 on aggregate. During the first leg in Turin, Clough was aggrieved by the performance of the match referee, whom he believed had been influenced and possibly bribed to favour the Italian side. After the game, Clough refused to speak to the Italian reporters, saying: &quot;No cheating bastards do I talk to. I will not talk to any cheating bastards&quot;. He instructed Brian Glanville to translate what he had said to them and questioned the Italian nation&#x27;s courage in the Second World War.

It was these sorts of frequent, outspoken comments – particularly against football&#x27;s establishment, such as the FA and club directors, and figures in the game such as Matt Busby, Alan Hardaker, Alf Ramsey, Don Revie and Len Shipman, along with players such as Billy Bremner, Norman Hunter and Peter Lorimer – combined with Clough&#x27;s increased media profile, that eventually led to his falling out with the Rams&#x27; chairman, Sam Longson, and the Derby County board of directors.

On 5 August 1973, Clough put his name to an article in the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; headlined &quot;I Would Put Leeds in Division Two – Brian Clough lashes Soccer&#x27;s bosses for letting off Don Revie&#x27;s &#x27;bad boys,&#x27;&quot; which savaged Leeds United&#x27;s disciplinary record, stating that Revie should be fined for encouraging his players in their unsporting behaviour and Leeds relegated to the Second Division. Clough also said that &quot;The men who run football have missed the most marvellous chance of cleaning up the game in one swoop&quot; and went on to say &quot;The trouble with football&#x27;s disciplinary system is that those who sat in judgement being officials of other clubs might well have a vested interest.&quot;

Days afterwards, Clough was charged with bringing the game into disrepute, but he was cleared on 14 November after he had later resigned from Derby. In September 1973, Clough travelled to West Ham United&#x27;s Upton Park and personally made a £400,000 bid for Bobby Moore, a player he long admired, and Trevor Brooking. West Ham manager Ron Greenwood informed Clough that neither was available but that he would pass his offer onto the West Ham board of directors anyway. Clough never told Derby&#x27;s chairman, secretary or any other board members at Derby about the bid. Longson found out four months later during a chance conversation with Eddie Chapman, West Ham&#x27;s secretary at the time, but by then Clough was no longer the Derby County manager.

====Resignation from Derby County====

On 27 April 1972, less than two weeks before taking Derby to the league title, Clough and Taylor had briefly resigned for a few hours to manage Coventry City before changing their minds after Longson offered them more money.

During the 1973–74 season, on 11 October 1973, Longson called for the sackings of both Clough and Taylor at a board meeting, but did not gain the support that was needed. Earlier that week, Longson had demanded that Clough stop writing newspaper articles and making television appearances, and prohibited both Clough and Taylor drinking alcohol on Derby County premises. Two days later, following a 1–0 win against Manchester United at Old Trafford, club director Jack Kirkland demanded to know what Taylor&#x27;s exact role within the club was, and instructed Taylor to meet him at the ground two days later to explain. On the same day, Longson accused Clough of making a V-sign at Matt Busby and chairman Louis Edwards and demanded that he apologise. Clough refused, and admitted later that he did make a V-sign, but it was aimed at Longson, not Busby or Edwards: he blamed Longson for providing too few tickets and seating for players&#x27; and staff&#x27;s wives, including his own and Taylor&#x27;s.

Clough and Taylor hoped to oust Longson as chairman, as they had done with Ord seven years earlier, but failed. Both Clough and Taylor resigned on the evening of 15 October 1973, and the resignation was accepted by Sam Longson the following morning, to widespread uproar from Rams fans, who demanded the board&#x27;s resignation along with Clough and Taylor&#x27;s reinstatement at the following home game against Leicester City four days later. That evening, Clough appeared on &quot;Parkinson&quot; and attacked football directors for their apparent &quot;lack of knowledge&quot; of football.

That week, Clough, as a television football pundit, memorably called Poland goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski a &quot;circus clown in gloves&quot; before the crucial World Cup qualifier with England at Wembley. The match, which England had to win in order to qualify for the 1974 World Cup finals, ended 1–1, and Tomaszewski made numerous magnificent saves, some of them unconventionally, to ensure his nation qualified for the finals at England&#x27;s expense. When commentator Brian Moore said &quot;You call him a clown, Brian, but he saved his side&quot;, Clough insisted &quot;Would you want him in your team every week?&quot;

The six years at Derby County had brought Clough to the attention of the wider football world. According to James Lawton, &quot;Derby was the wild making of Brian Clough. He went there a young and urgent manager who had done impressive work deep in his own little corner of the world at Hartlepools. He left surrounded by fascination and great celebrity: abrasive, infuriating, but plugged, immovably, into a vein of the nation.&quot;

===Brighton &amp; Hove Albion===
Such was the loyalty to Clough that, along with himself and Taylor, scouts and backroom staff completed the walk out, following the pair for their brief spell with Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. He proved less successful on the south coast than with his previous club, winning only 12 of his 32 games in charge of the Third Division side. Whereas nineteen months earlier he led Derby County to the league title and eight months earlier Clough was managing a team playing Juventus in the European Cup, he was now managing a club who, just after his appointment as manager, lost to non-league Walton &amp; Hersham 4–0 at home in an FA Cup replay. On 1 December 1973, his side lost 8–2 at home to Bristol Rovers. Brighton eventually finished in 19th place that 1973–74 season.

===Leeds United===
Clough left Brighton less than a year after his appointment, in July 1974, to become manager of Leeds United, following Don Revie&#x27;s departure to become manager of England, though this time Taylor did not join him. Clough&#x27;s move was very surprising given his previous outspoken criticism of both Revie, for whom Clough made no secret of his deep disdain, and the successful Leeds team&#x27;s playing style, which Clough had publicly branded &quot;dirty&quot; and &quot;cheating&quot;. Furthermore, he had called for Leeds to be demoted to the Second Division as a punishment for their poor disciplinary record.

He lasted in the job only 44 days before he was sacked by the Leeds directors on 12 September 1974, after alienating many of Leeds&#x27; star players. During one of the first training sessions he took for Leeds United, he reportedly said &quot;You can all throw your medals in the bin because they were not won fairly.&quot; Until Darko Milanic&#x27;s winless six games in 2014, he had the unenviable record of being Leeds United&#x27;s least successful permanent manager, winning only one match from six games. Leeds were fourth from bottom in 19th position with only four points from a possible twelve, their worst start since their last relegation campaign fifteen years earlier. His pay-off was estimated at £98,000, a huge amount at the time.

On the evening of his dismissal, Clough discussed his short reign at Elland Road with Yorkshire Television&#x27;s &quot;Calendar&quot; news programme. Revie also participated in the live broadcast, the two ex-managers spending as much time debating management practice with each other as with the host Austin Mitchell. Describing this televised interview as the culmination of the bitter rivalry between the two men, journalist Roger Hermiston stated: &quot;It was like watching a bickering couple about to get a divorce.&quot;

===Nottingham Forest===
Clough replaced Allan Brown as manager of Nottingham Forest on 6 January 1975, just over sixteen weeks after the end of his 44-day tenure as manager of Leeds United. Clough brought Jimmy Gordon to be his club trainer, as Gordon had been for him at Derby and Leeds. Forest won Clough&#x27;s first game in charge, an FA Cup third round replay against Tottenham Hotspur, with Scottish centre-forward Neil Martin scoring the only goal.

Ian Bowyer was already at Forest and had won domestic and European trophies with Manchester City. Clough signed Scottish duo John McGovern and John O&#x27;Hare in February from Leeds United, having been bought by Clough the previous year during his ill-fated 44-day managerial stint there; both players had been part of Clough&#x27;s title-winning team at Derby. He then brought John Robertson and Martin O&#x27;Neill back into the fold after they had requested transfers under Brown. Viv Anderson had previously made his debut for the first team and became a regular under Clough. Tony Woodcock, early in his career, was at Forest but was then unrated by Clough and was to be loaned to Lincoln City. Forest were 13th in English football&#x27;s second tier when Clough joined. They finished 16th at the end of the season. Forest signed Frank Clark in July 1975 on a free transfer. The following 1975–76 season, Forest finished eighth in Clough&#x27;s first full season in charge. It was in this season Clough made McGovern long standing club captain, taking over from a game in which Bob Chapman and Liam O&#x27;Kane were both injured.

On 16 July 1976, Peter Taylor re-joined Clough as his Assistant Manager, which he had been when winning the league at Derby. Taylor included being the club&#x27;s talent spotter in his role. After assessing the players Taylor told Clough &quot;that was a feat by you to finish eighth in the Second Division because some of them are only Third Division players&quot;. Taylor berated John Robertson for allowing himself to become overweight and disillusioned. He got Robertson on a diet and training regime that would help him become a European Cup winner. Taylor turned Woodcock from a reserve midfielder into a 42-cap England striker. In September 1976, he bought striker Peter Withe to Forest for £43,000, selling him to Newcastle United for £250,000 two years later. Withe was eventually replaced in the starting team by Garry Birtles who Taylor had scouted playing for non-league Long Eaton United. Birtles also went on to represent England. In October 1976, Clough, acting on Peter Taylor&#x27;s advice, signed Larry Lloyd for £60,000 after an initial loan period.

Together Clough and Taylor took Forest to new heights. The first trophy of the Clough and Taylor reign was the 1976–77 Anglo-Scottish Cup. Forest defeated Orient 5–1 on aggregate in the two-legged final played in December 1976. Clough valued winning a derided trophy as the club&#x27;s first silverware since 1959. He said, &quot;Those who said it was a nothing trophy were absolutely crackers. We&#x27;d won something, and it made all the difference.&quot;

On 7 May, Alan Moore&#x27;s own goal meant Forest in their last league game of the season defeated Millwall 1–0 at the City Ground. This kept Forest in the third promotion spot in the league table and dependent on Bolton Wanderers dropping points in three games in hand in the fight for third place. On 14 May Kenny Hibbitt&#x27;s goal from his rehearsed free kick routine with Willie Carr gave Wolves a 1–0 win at Bolton. Bolton&#x27;s defeat reached the Forest team mid-air en route to an end of 1976–77 season break in Mallorca. Forest&#x27;s third place promotion from the Second Division was the fifth-lowest points tally of any promoted team in history, 52 (two points for a win in England until 1981).

Taylor secretly followed Kenny Burns and concluded Burns&#x27; reputation as a hard drinker and gambler was exaggerated. Taylor sanctioned his £150,000 July signing. Burns became FWA Footballer of the Year in 1977–78 after being moved from centre-forward to centre-back. Forest started their return to the top league campaign with a 3–1 win at Everton. Three further wins in league and cup followed without conceding a goal. Then came five early September goals conceded in losing 3–0 at Arsenal and defeating Wolves 3–2 at home. Peter Shilton then signed for a record fee for a goalkeeper of £325,000. Taylor reasoned: &quot;Shilton wins you matches.&quot; 20 year old John Middleton was first team goalkeeper pre-Shilton. Middleton later in the month went in part exchange with £25,000 to Derby County for Archie Gemmill transferring to Forest. Gemmill was another Scottish former 1972 Derby title winner.

Forest lost only three of their first sixteen league games, the last of which was at Leeds United on 19 November 1977. They lost only one further game all season, an 11 March FA Cup sixth round defeat at West Bromwich Albion. Forest won the 1977–78 Football League, seven points ahead of runners-up Liverpool. Forest became one of the few teams (and the most recent team to date) to win the First Division title the season after winning promotion from the Second Division. This made Clough the third of four managers to win the English league championship with two different clubs. Forest conceded just 24 goals in 42 league games. They defeated Liverpool 1–0 in the 1978 Football League Cup Final replay, despite cup-tied Shilton, Gemmill and December signing David Needham not playing. Chris Woods chalked up two clean sheets in the final covering Shilton&#x27;s league cup absence. McGovern missed the replay through injury, and Burns lifted the trophy as the stand-in captain. Robertson&#x27;s penalty was the only goal of the game.

Forest started season 1978–79 by defeating Ipswich Town 5–0 for an FA Community Shield record win. In the 1978–79 European Cup they were drawn to play the trophy winners of the two previous seasons, Liverpool. Home goals by Birtles and Colin Barrett put Forest through 2–0 on aggregate. On 9 December 1978 Liverpool ended Forest&#x27;s 42 match undefeated league run dating back to the November the year before. The undefeated run was the equivalent of a whole season, surpassing the previous record of 35 games held by Burnley in 1920–21. The record stood until it was surpassed by Arsenal in August 2004, a month before Clough&#x27;s death. Arsenal played 49 league games without defeat.

In February 1979, Taylor authorised the English game&#x27;s first £1 million transfer, signing Trevor Francis from Birmingham City. In the April European Cup semi final home first leg against 1. FC Köln, Forest were two goals behind after twenty minutes. Forest scored three to edge ahead, but Köln equalised. Thus the German side started the second leg ahead on the away goals rule. Ian Bowyer&#x27;s goal, the only one of the game, put Forest through. Günter Netzer asked afterwards, &quot;Who is this McGovern? I have never heard of him, yet he ran the game.&quot; Forest defeated Malmö 1–0 in Munich&#x27;s Olympiastadion in the 1979 European Cup Final. Francis on his European debut scored with a back post header from Robertson&#x27;s cross. In addition, Forest defeated Southampton in the final 3–2 to retain the League Cup. Birtles scored twice, and Woodcock once. Forest finished second in the 1978–79 Football League, eight points behind Liverpool.

In the 1979–80 season Forest declined to play in the home and away 1979 Intercontinental Cup against Paraguay&#x27;s Club Olimpia. Forest defeated F.C. Barcelona 2–1 on aggregate in the 1979 European Super Cup in January and February 1980. Charlie George scored the only goal in the home first leg. Burns scored an equaliser in the return in Spain. In the 1979–80 Football League Cup, Forest reached a third successive final. A defensive mix up between Needham and Shilton let Wolves&#x27; Andy Gray tap in to an empty net. Forest missed numerous scoring chances and lost 1–0. In the 1979–80 European Cup quarter final, Forest won 3–1 at Dynamo Berlin to overturn a 1–0 home defeat. In the semi-final they defeated Ajax 2–1 on aggregate. They defeated Hamburg 1–0 in the 1980 European Cup Final at Madrid&#x27;s Santiago Bernabéu Stadium to retain the trophy. Robertson scored after exchanging passes with Birtles. Forest finished fifth in the 1979–80 Football League.

The next 1980–81 season in the European Cup first round, Forest lost 2–0 on aggregate, losing 1–0 both at home and away to CSKA Sofia. McGovern subsequently said the double defeat by CSKA affected the team&#x27;s self-confidence, in that they had lost out to &quot;modestly talented&quot; opponents. Forest lost the 1980 European Super Cup on away goals after a 2–2 aggregate draw against Valencia, with Bowyer scoring both Forest goals in the home first leg. On 11 February 1981, Forest lost 1–0 in the 1980 Intercontinental Cup against Uruguayan side Club Nacional de Football. The match was played for the first time at the neutral venue National Stadium in Tokyo before 62,000 fans.

The League and European Cup winning squad was broken up to capitalise on player sale value. Clough and Taylor both later said this was a mistake. The rebuilt side, comprising youngsters and signings such as Ian Wallace, Raimondo Ponte and Justin Fashanu, did not challenge for trophies. Taylor said in 1982, Jimmy Gordon retired in the same close season.

After clinched a decent fifth place in the 1982-83 season, the next campaign 1983-84 the club -returning to the continental competitions after two years- was defeated by Anderlecht in the UEFA Cup semi finals in controversial circumstances. Several contentious refereeing decisions went against Forest. Over a decade later it emerged that before the match the referee Guruceta Muro received a £27,000 &quot;loan&quot; from Anderlecht&#x27;s chairman Constant Vanden Stock. In 1997 UEFA subsequently banned Anderlecht for one year from European competition. Muro died in a car crash in 1987.

Forest defeated Sheffield Wednesday on penalties in the Football League Centenary Tournament final in April 1988 after drawing 0–0. Forest finished third in the league in the 1987–88 season and reached the FA Cup semi-finals. Stuart Pearce won the first of his five successive selections for the PFA Team of the Year.

On 18 January 1989, Clough joined the fray of a City Ground pitch invasion by hitting two of his own team&#x27;s fans when on the pitch. The football authorities fined Clough and issued him with a touchline ban. Forest defeated QPR 5–2 in that 1988–89 Football League Cup tie.

Forest defeated Everton 4–3 after extra time in the 1989 Full Members Cup final. They came back to defeated Luton Town 3–1 in the League Cup final. Nigel Clough scored two and Neil Webb one. Forest chased a unique cup treble in the 1988–89 season but tragedy struck a week after the League Cup win. Forest and Liverpool met for the second season in a row in the FA Cup semi-finals. The Hillsborough disaster claimed the lives of 97 Liverpool fans and the match was abandoned after six minutes. When the rescheduled game took place Forest struggled and Liverpool won 3–1. Forest finished third in the First Division for a second successive year. However they were unable to compete in the UEFA Cup as English clubs were still banned from European competitions following the Heysel Stadium Disaster. Des Walker won the first of his four successive selections for the PFA Team of the Year.

Nigel Jemson scored as Forest defeated Oldham Athletic 1–0 to retain the League Cup in 1990. Clough reached his only FA Cup final in 1991. Pearce put Forest ahead after sixteen minutes direct from a free kick against Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley. Spurs won 2–1 after an extra time own goal by Walker. Roy Keane declared himself fit to play in the final and was selected in preference to Steve Hodge. Keane later admitted he was not fit to play and that was why he had such an insignificant role in the final. English clubs were re-admitted to Europe for the 1990–91 season. English places in the competition were initially limited. 1990 League Cup winners Forest were not included. The only UEFA Cup place that season went to league runners-up Aston Villa.

In the summer of 1991, Millwall&#x27;s league top scorer Teddy Sheringham set Forest&#x27;s record signing fee at £2.1 million. In that 1991–92 season Forest defeated Southampton 3–2 after extra time in the Full Members Cup Final. Brian McClair&#x27;s solitary Manchester United goal defeated Forest in the 1992 Football League Cup Final. Forest had played in seven domestic cup finals at Wembley in five seasons, winning five. Forest finished eighth in the league that season to earn a place in the new FA Premier League.

Walker transferred in summer 1992 to Italian side Sampdoria. On 16 August 1992, Forest defeated Liverpool 1–0 at home in the first ever televised live Premier League game. Sheringham scored the only goal against Liverpool. Only one week later, Sheringham transferred to Tottenham. Forest&#x27;s form slumped, meaning Clough&#x27;s 18-year managerial reign ended in May 1993 with Forest relegated from the inaugural Premier League. In the final game of the season away to Ipswich, Forest lost 2–1, with Clough&#x27;s son, Nigel, scoring the last goal of the Brian Clough era at Nottingham Forest. Relegation was followed by Keane&#x27;s £3.75 million then-British record fee transfer to Manchester United.

===Links with other jobs===
Clough was a popular choice to be appointed England manager throughout the 1970s and 1980s. However, it was widely felt that the FA were unwilling to consider appointing him on account of his numerous outspoken comments about the English football authorities. He was interviewed for the job twice, in 1977 and 1982, but lost out to Ron Greenwood and Bobby Robson respectively. Such was the demand for Clough to be given the job that incumbent manager Robson told then-FA chairman Sir Bert Millichip: &#x27;I&#x27;m having a rough time and everybody wants Brian – give the job to him. If he&#x27;s successful, everybody&#x27;s happy. If he fails, that&#x27;s the end of the clamour for Brian Clough to be England manager&#x27;.&quot;

Clough was still a popular choice to be given the job of England manager before Graham Taylor&#x27;s appointment in 1990. Clough himself quipped: &quot;I&#x27;m sure the England selectors thought, if they took me on and gave me the job, I&#x27;d want to run the show. They were shrewd because that&#x27;s exactly what I would have done.&quot; He has been called the &quot;greatest manager England never had.&quot; In 1977, Clough was reportedly interested in the Everton manager&#x27;s job, but Gordon Lee was appointed instead.

Following Mike England&#x27;s dismissal as manager of Wales in February 1988, Clough was offered the position as manager of Wales on a part-time basis, something later done with John Toshack. Clough was keen on the chance to become an international manager, but the directors of Nottingham Forest refused to let him split his loyalties. According to Hamish Woodward writing in &quot;Atletifo Sports&quot;, Clough used the Wales job to earn himself an improved contract with Nottingham Forest. In April 1986, Clough had declared that he intended to spend the rest of his managerial career with Nottingham Forest. In June 1986, Clough was linked with the job of Scotland manager, but the vacancy was filled by Andy Roxburgh (a long-serving member of the Scotland coaching set-up) instead. Clough had also been linked with the Republic of Ireland job the previous year, before it was filled by fellow Englishman Jack Charlton.

===Rift with Peter Taylor===
Peter Taylor, Clough&#x27;s friend and long-time assistant at 
Hartlepools, Derby, Brighton and Forest, retired from football in 1982, bringing to an end their partnership. Several events had strained their friendship in the past: while at Derby, Taylor was riled when he learned that Clough had accepted a pay rise from Sam Longson without telling him; Taylor did not get one. Then, in 1980, Taylor released a book, &quot;With Clough, By Taylor&quot;, which detailed their partnership, but he had not told Clough that he was writing the book. Six months after retiring, Taylor was appointed Derby County manager. When their teams met in the FA Cup third round on 8 January 1983 at the Baseball Ground, the two managers ignored each other and did not speak. Derby County won the match 2–0.

When Taylor signed John Robertson from Forest without informing Clough on 21 May 1983, it was, according to Robertson, &quot;the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back&quot; and the two men would never speak again. In a tabloid article, Clough called Taylor a &quot;snake in the grass&quot; and declared that &quot;if his car broke down and I saw him thumbing a lift, I wouldn&#x27;t pick him up, I&#x27;d run him over.&quot; Taylor retorted that Clough&#x27;s outbursts were &quot;the sort of thing I have come to expect from a person I now regard with great distaste.&quot;

The rift had not been repaired by the time Taylor died in October 1990, but Clough and his family attended Taylor&#x27;s funeral. According to Taylor&#x27;s daughter Wendy, Clough was &quot;deeply upset&quot; by Taylor&#x27;s death and telephoned her when he heard the news. Clough dedicated his autobiography in 1994 to Taylor, and he also paid tribute to him when he was given the freedom of Nottingham, as he did in September 1999 when a bust was unveiled of Clough at the City Ground.

===Corruption allegations===
Clough was implicated in the 1990s &quot;bungs&quot; scandal in English football. A &quot;bung&quot; was a euphemism for illicit payments made between parties to ensure player transfer deals went through. In 1995 George Graham, then Arsenal manager, lost his job over payments during the transfer of two Scandinavian players in 1992.

Clough became involved in the scandal in June 1993 when he was named in court by Alan Sugar, then chairman of Tottenham Hotspur. Sugar, who was the club&#x27;s major shareholder, was taking legal action to sack Terry Venables, the club&#x27;s chief executive. Sugar testified in court that during the 1992 transfer of Teddy Sheringham from Nottingham Forest to Tottenham, Venables had told him that Clough &quot;liked a bung&quot;. Sugar said he sanctioned a cash payment of £58,750, which he believed would be paid to an agent, but instead was handed over to Ronnie Fenton, Clough&#x27;s assistant at Forest.

After an inquiry by the FA, Clough was charged with misconduct but the case was dropped due to his ill health. Former Premier League chief executive Rick Parry, who led the investigation into Clough, said: &quot;On the balance of evidence, we felt he was guilty of taking bungs. The evidence was pretty strong.&quot; A former Forest chief scout Alan Hill confirmed Clough had made illegal payments to players and backroom staff in breach of FA rules. Clough always denied the allegations, saying &quot;Asking me what it&#x27;s like to make money out of transfers is like asking &#x27;What&#x27;s it like to have VD?&#x27; I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;ve never had it.&quot;

==Later life==
Much of Clough&#x27;s retirement was spent concentrating on his fight against alcoholism, ill-health and corruption allegations. His battle with alcoholism dated back to the 1970s and was chronicled in part by Duncan Hamilton in his award-winning book &quot;Provided You Don&#x27;t Kiss Me: 20 Years With Brian Clough&quot;. He considered applying for the job as manager of Wolverhampton Wanderers on the sacking of Graham Taylor on 13 November 1995. Nothing came of it, however, and Clough&#x27;s managerial career was over.

In November 1994, Clough caused controversy over comments he made about the Hillsborough disaster. He wrote in his autobiography: &quot;I will always remain convinced that those Liverpool fans who died were killed by Liverpool people. They brought the tragedy on themselves--they were drunk, unruly and disorderly.&quot; He defended the comments in an interview with Clive Anderson. In 2001, he said: &quot;I now accept the investigations have made me realise I was misinformed. I wasn&#x27;t trying to be vindictive or unsympathetic, but my opinion has altered over the years. It was never my intention to hurt anyone.&quot;

Nottingham Forest honoured him by renaming the City Ground&#x27;s largest stand, the Executive Stand, the Brian Clough Stand. Clough was made an inaugural inductee of the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002 in recognition of his success and influence as a manager. In 1993, he was awarded the freedom of the city of Nottingham. In 2003, the city of Derby followed suit. He wrote a column for &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; magazine up until his death.

==Personal life and family==
Clough was a lifelong socialist, often appearing on miners&#x27; picket lines, donating large sums to trade union causes, canvassing for his local MP and being the chairman of the Anti-Nazi League. On two occasions, he was approached by the Labour Party to stand as a parliamentary candidate in general elections, but he declined in order to continue his managerial career in football. To accusations that he was a champagne socialist, Clough responded: &quot;Of course I&#x27;m a champagne socialist. The difference between me and a good Tory is he keeps his money while I share mine.&quot;

On 4 April 1959, Clough married Barbara Glasgow in Middlesbrough. He later said that marrying Barbara was &quot;the best thing I ever did&quot;. They went on to have three children: Simon, born on 15 June 1964, Nigel, born on 19 March 1966, and Elizabeth, born on 31 May 1967. During the 1980s the Clough family went on to mentor a couple of underprivileged youngsters from Sunderland, brothers Craig and Aaron Bromfield after a chance encounter in the North East prior to a Forest fixture. Craig at one point ended up living with the Cloughs for a significant period of time, coming to see Brian as a second father—the arrangement ending when Craig was found to have been stealing from the family. Craig, who later published a book on his experience, seems genuinely appreciative to the family and, to his credit, full of regret for the way the situation came to a conclusion. Nigel also became a professional footballer and played under his father at Forest in the 1980s and 1990s. He then moved into management and, in January 2009, followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps when he was appointed manager of Derby County.

In 2011, his family and friends contributed memories to a book entitled &quot;The Day I Met Brian Clough&quot;, which also included recollections from fans and journalists.
His widow, Barbara, died on 20 July 2013 at the age of 75. Her death was revealed to have been the result of a head injury sustained when she fell over in a car park of a hospital where she was being treated for cancer.

A lover of cricket, Clough was good friends with Yorkshire and England cricketer Geoffrey Boycott.

Clough was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1991 Birthday Honours for services to association football.

==Death==
Clough died of stomach cancer on 20 September 2004, on Ward 30, in Derby City Hospital, at the age of 69, having been admitted a few days earlier. Such was his popularity, fans of Derby County and Nottingham Forest, usually fierce rivals, mourned together following his death. A memorial service was held at Derby&#x27;s Pride Park Stadium on 21 October 2004 which was attended by more than 14,000 people. It was originally to have been held at Derby Cathedral, but had to be moved because of demand for tickets.

==Legacy==
In August 2005, the stretch of the A52 linking Nottingham and Derby was renamed Brian Clough Way. His widow Barbara expressed her gratitude to Nottingham City Council, saying: &quot;Brian would have been amazed but genuinely appreciative&quot;. Since the opening of the Nottingham Express Transit system, tram No. 215 has been named &quot;Brian Clough&quot;.

After a long process of fundraising, Clough&#x27;s home town of Middlesbrough commissioned a statue of him, which was unveiled on 16 May 2007. Although there was a movement to erect a statue in his birthplace at Grove Hill, the site chosen was the town&#x27;s Albert Park, through which he usually walked on his way from home to Ayresome Park, Middlesbrough&#x27;s former stadium.

In August 2008, a tribute website was set up in honour of Clough with the backing of his family. This helped to raise money for a statue of Clough, which was erected in Nottingham&#x27;s Old Market Square on 6 November 2008. In December 2006, the Brian Clough Statue Fund in Nottingham announced it had raised £69,000 in just 18 months for a statue of Clough in the city. The winning statue was selected from a choice of three designs in January 2008. The site chosen for the statue was at the junction of King Street and Queen Street in the centre of Nottingham. On 6 November 2008, the statue was unveiled by Clough&#x27;s widow Barbara, in front of a crowd of more than 5,000 people.
The tribute website brianclough.com is still attracting visitors from around the world and was praised by Barbara Clough on its tenth anniversary in 2010. Barbara Clough said she hoped it would &quot;continue to be a success for many years&quot;.
In 2007 and 2008, a redevelopment scheme building new houses on the old Middlesbrough General Hospital site named roads after famous former Middlesbrough F.C. players, including Willie Maddren, George Camsell and Clough.

Derby County and Nottingham Forest competed for the inaugural Brian Clough Trophy at Pride Park on 31 July 2007. In future, any league, cup or friendly game played between Derby and Forest will automatically become a Brian Clough Trophy game. Proceeds from the games will go to charities in the East Midlands.

In April 2009, Derby County announced that they would erect a statue of Clough and Peter Taylor at Pride Park, with sculptor Andy Edwards, who previously produced the Steve Bloomer bust already in the stadium, commissioned for the statue. The Brian Clough and Peter Taylor Monument was officially unveiled in a family service on 27 August 2010 and publicly on 28 August 2010.

==&quot;The Damned United&quot;==
The story of Clough&#x27;s turbulent 44-day spell in charge of Leeds United was the subject of a novel by David Peace titled &quot;The Damned Utd&quot;, published in 2006, which focuses on the rivalry between Clough and Don Revie. Despite critical acclaim, the novel was also the subject of controversy for its perceived negative portrayal of Clough as an obsessive, and for some historical inaccuracies. The publishers of the novel were successfully sued by Irish midfielder and former Leeds player Johnny Giles. He wrote: &quot;Many of the things Peace talks about in the book never happened and, for that reason, I felt it necessary to go to the courts to establish that this was fiction based on fact and nothing more&quot;. 
The Clough family expressed disappointment at the publication of the book. It includes a scene with Clough in the Elland Road car park burning Revie&#x27;s old desk, for which there is no factual source.

The book was later adapted into a film called &quot;The Damned United&quot;, starring Michael Sheen and released in 2009. It too was successfully sued for defamation, this time by Dave Mackay, who in 2010 received an apology and an undisclosed sum from the producers. The Clough family declined to co-operate with the film, despite efforts by the film-makers to lighten the dark tone of the novel.

==&quot;Bloody Southerners&quot;==
In 2018, a book chronicling Clough and Taylor&#x27;s hitherto unwritten time in management at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, &#x27;Bloody Southerners: Clough and Taylor&#x27;s Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Odyssey&#x27;, was written by Spencer Vignes and published by Biteback Publishing. Clough and Taylor had joined Brighton in November 1973, and Vignes speaks to the Brighton players who played under them. Clough himself only stayed for a few months, before heading to Leeds United at the end of the season. Taylor, meanwhile, chose to honour his contract with club chairman Mike Bamber, and stayed on as sole manager until the end of the 1975/76 season.

<doc id="157299" wikidata="Q1978005" url="?curid=157299" title="Nerf Herder">
<text>Nerf Herder is an American rock band from Santa Barbara, California, formed in 1994 by Parry Gripp (vocals, guitar), Charlie Dennis (bass) and Steve Sherlock (drums). They describe themselves as a &quot;geek rock&quot; band, and are known for simple modern punk-style songs with frequently humorous, juvenile, and pop-culture-referencing lyrics.

The band&#x27;s name is a reference to a line of dialogue between Princess Leia and Han Solo in &quot;Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back&quot;.

Their 1997 single &quot;Van Halen&quot;, a tribute to the band of the same name, received significant radio airplay and led to their first major record deal with Arista Records. They also composed and performed the theme music to the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer.&quot;

== History ==

Nerf Herder was formed in Santa Barbara in 1994 by Parry Gripp (vocals, guitar), Charlie Dennis (bass), and Steve Sherlock (drums). Dennis left the band after the release of their debut self-titled album, and was replaced first by Pete Newbury, with Dave Ehrlich also joining as a second guitarist. Newbury&#x27;s tenure touring with the band was, however, short-lived. He was briefly replaced in 1999 by bassist Marko 72, and then by Justin Fisher, who played bass and keyboards on two albums (&quot;How To Meet Girls&quot; &amp; &quot;American Cheese&quot;).

In 1999, Nerf Herder asked Arista to release them from their contract, so they could move forward with a new record, &quot;How to Meet Girls&quot;, with Honest Don&#x27;s Records, a subsidiary of Fat Wreck Chords. A special EP for My Records (run by Joey Cape from Lagwagon) titled &quot;My EP&quot; was released in 2001, and was followed in 2002 by their album &quot;American Cheese&quot;.

The band wrote and performed the theme song for the TV series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1997). In April 2003, Nerf Herder appeared as the musical guest in the final-season &quot;Buffy&quot; episode &quot;Empty Places&quot; – the very last band to play at The Bronze. Their special connection to the series was further acknowledged by a bit of dialogue, as &quot;Rock City News&quot; played in the background:

&lt;poem&gt;Kennedy: What kind of band plays during an apocalypse?
Dawn: I think this band might actually be one of the signs.&lt;/poem&gt;

By 2003, after the final &quot;American Cheese&quot; tour dates—during which time Ben Pringle (also of The Rentals during 2005–2008) had replaced Fisher (who had left amicably to front his own band, Psoma)—the band disintegrated. No official split was announced, but a post by Gripp on the band&#x27;s website some time afterwards detailed how most of the former band members had gone on to get normal jobs. Gripp did some work as a jingle writer, which led to his 2005 solo album &quot;For Those About to Shop, We Salute You&quot;, a 51-track concept album mimicking various musical styles and focusing on product commercialization.

In late 2006, Nerf Herder made a surprise comeback, announcing on their website that they were playing a handful of gigs with the original lineup of Gripp, Dennis, and Sherlock. For Gripp&#x27;s May 7, 2007 review of the day, he announced that the original lineup had finally finished recording their 4th album, which did not have a title at that time. Gripp stated that he wanted the title to be &quot;Brownerton&quot;, but that idea was shot down. He also stated that of the 13 songs recorded, they would probably pick 10 to be on the album. In June 2007, the band decided on the title &quot;Nerf Herder IV&quot;, and the album was released through Oglio Records on April 29, 2008. Pringle returned, and Former Size 14 singer Linus of Hollywood joined the live band (playing guitar and keyboard) in early 2008 for a series of West Coast shows and a short tour of Japan.

In 2014, Nerf Herder began working on album number five, titled &quot;Rockingham&quot;, which was released on March 11, 2016.

As of 2019, Nerf Herder has continued to perform live and is currently writing and recording new material.

<text>The Svitava () is a river in the Czech Republic, a left tributary of the Svratka River. It flows through the Pardubice and South Moravian regions. It is long.

==Etymology==
The river&#x27;s name referred to its clear water and was derived from &quot;svítat&quot;, which meant &quot;[be] clear&quot; in Old Czech. The river is first documented in 1125 in &quot;Chronica Boemorum&quot;.

==Characteristic==

The Svitava originates in the territory of Svitavy in the Svitavy Uplands at an elevation of and flows to Brno, where it enters the Svratka River at an elevation of . It is long. Its drainage basin has an area of .

The longest tributaries of the Svitava are:
==Settlements==

The river valley is densely populated and there are many relatively notable settlements on the river. Apart from the city of Brno, the most significant towns on the river are Blansko and Svitavy, named after the river. The river flows through the municipal territories of Svitavy, Hradec nad Svitavou, Banín, Březová nad Svitavou, Brněnec, Rozhraní, Stvolová, Skrchov, Letovice, Svitávka, Boskovice, Skalice nad Svitavou, Lhota Rapotina, Doubravice nad Svitavou, Rájec-Jestřebí, Ráječko, Blansko, Olomučany, Adamov, Bílovice nad Svitavou and Brno.

==Bodies of water==
There are 583 bodies of water in the basin area. The largest of them is the Letovice Reservoir with an area of , built on the Křetínka. Two fishponds are built on the upper course of the Svitava.

==Use==
There are a large number of mills and hydroelectric power stations on the river.

==Tourism==
The Svitava is suitable for river tourism. The river is navigable all year round, but there are many weirs on it. The most popular section for paddlers is between Letovice and Blansko.

<text>Pepper spray, oleoresin capsicum spray, OC spray, capsaicin spray, mace, or capsicum spray is a lachrymator (tear gas) product containing the compound capsaicin as the active ingredient that irritates the eyes to cause burning and pain sensations, as well as temporary blindness. Its inflammatory effects cause the eyes to close, temporarily taking away vision. This temporary blindness allows officers to more easily restrain subjects and permits people in danger to use pepper spray in self-defense for an opportunity to escape. It also causes temporary discomfort and burning of the lungs which causes shortness of breath. Pepper spray is used as a less lethal weapon in policing, riot control, crowd control, and self-defense, including defense against dogs and bears. 

Pepper spray was engineered originally for defense against bears, mountain lions, wolves and other dangerous predators, and is often referred to colloquially as bear spray.

Kamran Loghman, the person who developed it for use in riot control, wrote the guide for police departments on how it should be used. It was successfully adopted, except for improper usages such as when police sprayed peaceful protestors at University of California, Davis in 2011. Loghman commented, &quot;I have never seen such an inappropriate and improper use of chemical agents&quot;, prompting court rulings completely barring its use on docile persons.

==Components==

The active ingredient in pepper spray is capsaicin, which is derived from the fruit of plants in the genus &quot;Capsicum&quot;, including chilis in the form of oleoresin capsicum (OC). Extraction of OC from peppers requires capsicum to be finely ground, from which capsaicin is then extracted using an organic solvent such as ethanol. The solvent is then evaporated, and the remaining waxlike resin is the oleoresin capsaicin.

An emulsifier such as propylene glycol is used to suspend OC in water, and the suspension is then pressurized to make an aerosol pepper spray. Other sprays may use an alcohol (such as isopropyl alcohol) base for a more penetrating product, but a risk of fire is present if combined with a taser.

Determining the strength of pepper sprays made by different manufacturers can be confusing and difficult. Statements a company makes about their product strength are not regulated.
* The US federal government uses CRC (capsaicin and related capsaicinoids) content for regulation. CRC is the pain-producing component of the OC that produces the burning sensation. Personal pepper sprays can range from a low of 0.18% to a high of 3%. Most law enforcement pepper sprays use between 1.3% and 2%. The federal government of the United States has determined that bear attack deterrent sprays must contain at least 1.0% and not more than 2% CRC. Because the six different types of capsaicinoids under the CRC heading has different levels of potency (up to 2× on the SHU scale), the measurement does not fully represent the strength. Manufacturers do not state which particular type of capsaicinoids are used.
* Using the OC concentration is unreliable because the concentration of CRC (and potency of these compounds) can vary. Some manufacturers may show a very high percentage of OC, but the resin itself may not be spicy enough. Higher OC content only reliably implies a higher oil content, which may be undesirable as the hydrophobic oil is less able to soak and penetrate skin. Solutions of more than 5% OC may not spray properly.
* Scoville heat units (SHU) is a common indication of pepper spiciness. It does take into account the different potency of CRC compounds, but it cannot be reliably used in pepper spray because it measures the strength of the dry product, i.e. the OC resin and not what comes in the aerosol spray. As the resin is always diluted to make it spray-able, the SHU rating is not useful on its own.

==Counterparts==

There are several counterparts of pepper spray developed and legal to possess in some countries.
* In the United Kingdom, desmethyldihydrocapsaicin (known also as PAVA spray) is used by police officers. As a Section 5 weapon, it is not generally permitted to the public.
* Pelargonic acid morpholide (MPK) is widely used as a self-defense chemical agent spray in Russia, though its effectiveness compared to natural pepper spray is unclear.
* In China, Ministry of Public Security police units and security guards use tear gas ejectors with OC, CS or CN gases. These are defined as a &quot;restricted&quot; weapon that only police officers, as well as approved security, can use.

==Types==
*Aerosol compound
**Cone pattern dispersion - wide pattern, don&#x27;t have to aim precisely. It can be blown back by wind and if used inside a building, will eventually make room temporarily uninhabitable.
**Fog pattern dispersion (fogger)
**Stream pattern dispersion
**Grenade
*Gel compound: has greater accuracy and a reduced risk of blowback and area cross-contamination as the carrying gel does not disperse over a large area. The gel compound also adheres to the target making it more difficult to remove. 
*Foam compound

==Effects==
Pepper spray is an inflammatory agent. It inflames the mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, throat and lungs.

It causes immediate closing of the eyes, difficulty breathing, runny nose, and coughing. The duration of its effects depends on the strength of the spray; the average full effect lasts from 20 to 90 minutes, but eye irritation and redness can last for up to 24 hours.

The &quot;Journal of Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science&quot; published a study that concluded that single exposure of the eye to OC is harmless, but repeated exposure can result in long-lasting changes in corneal sensitivity. They found no lasting decrease in visual acuity.

The European Parliament Scientific and Technological Options Assessment (STOA) published in 1998 &quot;An Appraisal of Technologies of Political Control&quot;
The STOA appraisal states:

::&quot;Past experience has shown that to rely on manufacturers unsubstantiated claims about the absence of hazards is unwise. In the US, companies making crowd control weapons, (e.g. pepper-gas manufacturer Zarc International), have put their technical data in the public domain without loss of profitability.&quot;

:and

::&quot;Research on chemical irritants should be published in open scientific journals before authorization for any usage is permitted and that the safety criteria for such chemicals should be treated as if they were drugs rather than riot control agents;&quot;

For those taking drugs, or those subjected to restraining techniques that restrict the breathing passages, there is a risk of death. In 1995, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported at least 61 deaths associated with police use of pepper spray since 1990 in the USA. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) documented 27 people in police custody who died after exposure to pepper spray in California since 1993. However, the ACLU report counts all deaths occurring within hours of exposure to pepper spray regardless of prior interaction, taser use, or if drugs are involved. In all 27 cases listed by the ACLU, the coroners&#x27; report listed other factors as the primary cause of death; in a few cases the use of pepper spray may have been a contributing factor.

The US Army performed studies in 1993 at Aberdeen Proving Ground, and a UNC study in 2000 stated that the compound in peppers, capsaicin, is mildly mutagenic, and 10% of mice exposed to it developed cancer. Where the study also found many beneficial effects of capsaicin, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration released statements declaring exposure of employees to OC is an unnecessary health risk. As of 1999, it was in use by more than 2,000 public safety agencies.

The head of the FBI&#x27;s Less-Than-Lethal Weapons Program at the time of the 1991 study, Special Agent Thomas W. W. Ward, was fired by the FBI and was sentenced to two months in prison for receiving payments from a pepper-gas manufacturer while conducting and authoring the FBI study that eventually approved pepper spray for FBI use. Prosecutors said that from December 1989 through 1990, Ward received about $5,000 a month for a total of $57,500, from Luckey Police Products, a Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based company that was a major producer and supplier of pepper spray. The payments were paid through a Florida company owned by Ward&#x27;s wife.Direct close-range spray can cause more serious eye irritation by attacking the cornea with a concentrated stream of liquid (the so-called &quot;hydraulic needle&quot; effect). Some brands have addressed this problem by means of an elliptically cone-shaped spray pattern.

Pepper spray has been associated with positional asphyxiation of individuals in police custody. There is much debate over the actual cause of death in these cases. There have been few controlled clinical studies of the human health effects of pepper spray marketed for police use, and those studies are contradictory. Some studies have found no harmful effects beyond the effects described above. Due to these studies and deaths, many law enforcement agencies have moved to include policies and training to prevent positional deaths. However, there are some scientific studies that argue the positional asphyxiation claim is a myth due to pinpoint pressure on a person. The study by two universities stressed that no pressure should be applied to the neck area. They concluded that the person&#x27;s own weight is not enough to stop a person&#x27;s breathing with the rest of their body supported.

===Acute response===
For individuals not previously exposed to OC effects, the general feelings after being sprayed can be best likened to being &quot;set alight&quot;. The initial reaction, should the spray be directed at the face, is the involuntary closing of the eyes, an instant sensation of the restriction of the airways and the general feeling of sudden and intense searing pain about the face, nose, and throat. This is due to irritation of mucous membranes. Many people experience fear and are disoriented due to sudden restriction of vision even though it is temporary. There is associated shortness of breath, although studies performed with asthmatics have not produced any asthma attacks in those individuals, and monitoring is still needed for the individuals after exposure. Police are trained to repeatedly instruct targets to breathe normally if they complain of difficulty, as the shock of the exposure can generate considerable panic as opposed to actual physical symptoms.

==Treatment==
Capsaicin is not soluble in water, and even large volumes of water will not wash it off, only dilute it. In general, victims are encouraged to blink vigorously in order to encourage tears, which will help flush the irritant from the eyes.

A study of five often-recommended treatments for skin pain (Maalox, 2% lidocaine gel, baby shampoo, milk, or water) concluded that: &quot;...there was no significant difference in pain relief provided by five different treatment regimens. Time after exposure appeared to be the best predictor for a decrease in pain...&quot;.

Many ambulance services and emergency departments carry saline to remove the spray. Some of the OC and CS will remain in the respiratory system, but a recovery of vision and the coordination of the eyes can be expected within 7 to 15 minutes.

Some &quot;triple-action&quot; pepper sprays also contain &quot;tear gas&quot; (CS gas), which can be neutralized with sodium metabisulfite (Campden tablets), though it is not for use on a person, only for area clean up.

==Use==
Pepper spray typically comes in canisters, which are often small enough to be carried or concealed in a pocket or purse. Pepper spray can also be purchased concealed in items such as rings. There are also pepper spray projectiles available, which can be fired from a paintball gun or similar platform. It has been used for years against demonstrators and aggressive animals like bears. There are also many types such as foam, gel, foggers, and spray.

=== Oleoresin capsicum ===
Oleoresin capsicum, also known as capsicum oleoresin, is also used in food and medicine. In food, it serves as a concentrated and predictable source of spiciness. The food industry has accordingly changed to prefer a combination of milder and more predictable strains of jalapeno and OC for flavoring. In medicine, OC is used in a number of products for external use.

OC used for food is generally rated between 80 000 and 500 000 SHU, roughly equivalent to 0.6-3.9% capsaicin. Paprika oleoresin is a different extract, containing very little heat and mostly used for coloring.

==Legality==

===North America===

====Canada====
Pepper spray designed to be used against people is considered a prohibited weapon in Canada. The definition under regulation states &quot;any device designed to be used for the purpose of injuring, immobilizing or otherwise incapacitating any person by the discharge therefrom of (a) tear gas, Mace or other gas, or (b) any liquid, spray, powder or other substance that is capable of injuring, immobilizing or otherwise incapacitating any person&quot; is a prohibited weapon.

Only law enforcement officers may legally carry or possess pepper spray labeled for use on persons. Any similar canister with the labels reading &quot;dog spray&quot; or &quot;bear spray&quot; is regulated under the &quot;Pest Control Products Act&quot;—while legal to be carried by anyone, it is against the law if its use causes &quot;a risk of imminent death or serious bodily harm to another person&quot; or harming the environment and carries a penalty up to a fine of $500,000 and jail time of maximum 3 years. Carrying bear spray in public, without justification, may also lead to charges under the Criminal Code.

====United States====
It is a federal offense to carry/ship pepper spray on a commercial airliner or possess it in the secure area of an airport. State law and local ordinances regarding possession and use vary across the country. Pepper spray up to 4 oz. is permitted in checked baggage.

When pepper spray is used in the workplace, OSHA requires a pepper spray Safety Data Sheet (SDS) be available to all employees.

Pepper spray can be legally purchased and carried in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Some states regulate the maximum allowed strength of the pepper spray, age restriction, content and use.

* California: As of January 1, 1996 and as a result of Assembly Bill 830 (Speier), the pepper spray and Mace programs are now deregulated. Consumers will no longer be required to have the training, and a certificate is not required to purchase or possess these items. Pepper spray and Mace are available through gun shops, sporting goods stores, and other business outlets. California Penal Code Section 12400–12460 govern pepper spray use in California. Container holding the defense spray must contain no more than net weight of aerosol spray.

New legislations allow residents to purchase pepper spray without a Firearms Identification Card starting July 1.
* Florida: Any pepper spray containing no more than of chemical can be carried in public openly or concealed without a permit. Furthermore, any such pepper spray is classified as &quot;self-defense chemical spray&quot; and therefore not considered a weapon under Florida law.
* Michigan: Allows &quot;reasonable use&quot; of spray containing not more than 18% oleoresin capsicum to protect &quot;a person or property under circumstances that would justify the person&#x27;s use of physical force&quot;. It is illegal to distribute a &quot;self-defense spray&quot; to a person under 18 years of age.

* New Jersey: Non-felons over the age of 18 can possess a small amount of pepper spray, with no more than three-quarters of an ounce of chemical substance.
* New York: Can be legally possessed by any person age 18 or over. Restricted to no more than 0.67% capsaicin content.
** It must be purchased in person (i.e., cannot be purchased by mail-order or internet sale) either at a pharmacy or from a licensed firearm retailer (NY Penal Law 265.20 14) and the seller must keep a record of purchases. 
*** The use of pepper spray to prevent a public official from performing his/her official duties is a class-E felony.
*Texas law makes it legal for an individual to possess a small, commercially sold container of pepper spray for personal self-defense. However, Texas law otherwise makes it illegal to carry a &quot;Chemical dispensing device&quot;.
* Virginia: Code of Virginia § 18.2-312. Illegal use of tear gas, phosgene, and other gases. &quot;If any person maliciously releases or cause or procure to be released in any private home, place of business or place of public gathering any tear gas, mustard gas, phosgene gas or other noxious or nauseating gases or mixtures of chemicals designed to, and capable of, producing vile or injurious or nauseating odors or gases, and bodily injury results to any person from such gas or odor, the offending person shall be guilty of a Class 3 felony. If such act be done unlawfully, but not maliciously, the offending person shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the use of tear gas or other gases by police officers or other peace officers in the proper performance of their duties, or by any person or persons in the protection of the person, life or property.&quot;
* Washington: Persons over 18 may carry personal-protection spray devices. 
** Persons over age 14 may carry personal-protection spray devices with their legal guardian&#x27;s consent.
* Wisconsin: Tear gas is not permissible. 
** By regulation, OC products with a maximum OC concentration of 10% and weight range of oleoresin of capsicum and inert ingredients of are authorized. Further, the product cannot be camouflaged and must have a safety feature designed to prevent accidental discharge. The units may not have an effective range of over and must have an effective range of . 
*** In addition, there are certain labeling and packaging requirements: it must not be sold to anyone under 18, and the phone number of the manufacturer has to be on the label. The units must also be sold in sealed tamper-proof packages.

===Australia===
* Australian Capital Territory: Pepper spray is a &quot;prohibited weapon&quot;, making it an offence to possess or use it.
* New South Wales: Possession of pepper spray by unauthorized persons is illegal, under schedule 1 of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998, being classified as a &quot;prohibited weapon&quot;. 
* Northern Territory: Prescribed by regulation to be a prohibited weapon under the Weapons Control Act. 
** This legislation makes it an offense for someone without a permit, normally anyone who is not an officer of Police/Correctional Services/Customs/Defence, to carry a prohibited weapon.
* Tasmania: Possession of pepper spray by unauthorized persons is illegal, under an amendment of the Police Offences Act 1935, being classified as an &quot;offensive weapon&quot;. Likewise, possession of knives, batons, and any other instrument that may be considered, &quot;Offensive Weapons&quot; if they are possessed by an individual, in a Public Place, &quot;Without lawful excuse&quot;, leading to confusion within the police force over what constitutes &quot;lawful excuse&quot;. Self-defense as a lawful excuse to carry such items varies from one officer to the next. 
** Pepper spray is commercially available without a license. Authority to possess and use Oleoresin Capsicum devices remains with Tasmania Police Officers (As part of general-issue operational equipment), and Tasmanian Justice Department (H.M. Prisons) Officers.
* South Australia: in South Australia, possession of pepper spray without lawful excuse is illegal.
* Western Australia: The possession of pepper spray by individuals for self-defense subject to a &quot;reasonable excuse&quot; test has been legal in Western Australia following the landmark Supreme Court decision in Hall v Collins [2003] WASCA 74 (4 April 2003).
* Victoria: Schedule 3 of the &quot;Control of Weapons Regulations 2011&quot; designates &quot;an article designed or adapted to discharge oleoresin capsicum spray&quot; as a prohibited weapon.
* Queensland: in Queensland, pepper spray is considered an offensive weapon and can not be used for self-defence.

===New Zealand===
* Classed as a restricted weapon. 
** A permit is required to obtain or carry pepper spray. 
** Front-line police officers have routinely carried pepper spray since 1997. New Zealand Prison Service made OC spray available for use in approved situations in 2013. 
** New Zealand Defence Force Military Police are permitted to carry OC spray under a special agreement due to the nature of their duties.
** The Scoville rating of these sprays are 500,000 (sabre MK9 HVS unit) and 2,000,000 (Sabre, cell buster fog delivery). This was as a result of excessive staff assaults and a two-year trial in ten prisons throughout the country.

==Civilian use advocates==
In June 2002, West Australian resident Rob Hall was convicted for using a canister of pepper spray to break up an altercation between two guests at his home in Midland. He was sentenced to a good behavior bond and granted a spent conviction order, which he appealed to the Supreme Court. Justice Christine Wheeler ruled in his favor, thereby legalizing pepper spray in the state on a case-by-case basis for those who are able to show a reasonable excuse.

On 14 March 2012, a person dressed entirely in black entered the public gallery of the New South Wales Legislative Council and launched a paper plane into the air in the form of a petition to Police Minister Mike Gallacher calling on the government to allow civilians to carry capsicum spray.

<text>The Svratka (; ) is a river in the Czech Republic, a left tributary of the Thaya River. It flows through the Vysočina and South Moravian regions, including the city of Brno. It is long, making it the 9th longest river in the Czech Republic.

==Etymology==
According to one theory, the name originates from the Proto-Slavic verb &quot;vort&quot; (&quot;vrátit&quot; in modern Czech), which meant &quot;to return&quot;. It denoted &quot;a returning river&quot; (which meant meandering river). Another theory is that the name was derived from the Germanic &quot;Swarta&quot;, which meant &quot;black water&quot;. Sometimes the river was colloquially referred to as &quot;Švarcava&quot; or &quot;Švorcava&quot;.

==Characteristic==

The Svratka originates in the territory of Cikháj in the Upper Svratka Highlands at an elevation of and flows to the Nové Mlýny reservoirs, where it enters the Thaya River in Dolní Věstonice at an elevation of . It is long, making it the 9th longest river in the Czech Republic. Its drainage basin has an area of .

The longest tributaries of the Svratka are:
==Settlements==

The most notable settlement on the Svratka is the city of Brno, where the Svitava flows into the river. The river flows past the following municipalities: Cikháj, Herálec, Svratka, Křižánky, Březiny, Krásné, Spělkov, Telecí, Borovnice, Jimramov, Strachujov, Unčín, Dalečín, Chlum-Korouhvice, Vír, Koroužné, Štěpánov nad Svratkou, Ujčov, Nedvědice, Černvír, Doubravník, Borač, Štěpánovice, Tišnov, Veverská Bítýška, Brno, Modřice, Rajhrad, Židlochovice, Nosislav, Velké Němčice, Vranovice, Pouzdřany, Ivaň and Dolní Věstonice.

In the section from Březiny to Borovnice, the river forms the border between the Vysočina and Pardubice regions. In the section from Herálec to Jimramov, the river also forms the border between the historical lands of Bohemia and Moravia.

==Bodies of water==
The reservoirs Brno (), Vír I () and Vír II () are built on the Svratka. The largest body of water in the basin area is the Dalešice Reservoir with an area of , which is built on the Jihlava River. There are 4,942 bodies of water in the basin area.

==Economy==
The Svratka is among the popular rivers for river tourism. Two of its sections are navigable; however, the upper section is navigable only during the spring thaw and after heavy rains, and the lower section depends on the discharge of the Vír I and Vír II reservoirs. A short slalom channel is built between Vír I and Vír II.

<doc id="157304" wikidata="Q899341" url="?curid=157304" title="Suicidal Tendencies">
<text>Suicidal Tendencies is an American crossover thrash band formed in 1980 in Venice, California, by vocalist Mike Muir. The band has undergone various lineup changes, with Muir as the only remaining original member. Their current lineup includes Muir, guitarists Dean Pleasants and Ben Weinman, bassist Tye Trujillo and drummer Jay Weinberg. Notable musicians who have contributed to the band&#x27;s studio or live activities include guitarists Rocky George and Mike Clark; bassists Louiche Mayorga, Robert Trujillo, Ra Díaz, Josh Paul and Stephen &quot;Thundercat&quot; Bruner; and drummers Amery Smith, Jimmy DeGrasso, Brooks Wackerman, David Hidalgo Jr., Thomas Pridgen, Ron Bruner, Eric Moore, Dave Lombardo, Brandon Pertzborn, Greyson Nekrutman and session musician Josh Freese.

Along with D.R.I., Corrosion of Conformity, and Stormtroopers of Death, Suicidal Tendencies is often credited as one of &quot;the fathers of crossover thrash&quot;. They have released fourteen studio albums (four of which are composed of re-recorded or previously released material), two EPs, four split albums, four compilation albums, and two long-form videos. The band achieved its first success with their 1983 self-titled debut album; it spawned the single &quot;Institutionalized&quot;, which was one of the first hardcore punk videos to receive substantial airplay on MTV. Suicidal Tendencies&#x27; popularity continued to grow exponentially within the next decade, and with their second studio album &quot;Join the Army&quot; (1987), which was their first to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, the band was beginning to experiment with a heavy sound that helped create, develop and popularize the crossover thrash genre. Suicidal Tendencies&#x27; first three albums on the major label Epic Records — &quot;How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can&#x27;t Even Smile Today&quot; (1988), &quot;Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit... Déjà Vu&quot; (1989) and &quot;Lights...Camera...Revolution!&quot; (1990) — were well-received in the thrash metal and heavy metal communities, with the latter two earning Suicidal Tendencies gold certifications by the RIAA. The band&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;The Art of Rebellion&quot; (1992), became their greatest chart success, peaking at number 52 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and included three of their biggest hits &quot;Asleep at the Wheel&quot;, &quot;Nobody Hears&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Hate You Better&quot;. That album, along with its predecessor and its successors &quot;Still Cyco After All These Years&quot; (1993) and &quot;Suicidal for Life&quot; (1994), saw the band experiment further, with sounds and influences ranging from thrash metal to progressive and funk music.

Suicidal Tendencies disbanded in 1995 after severing ties from Epic. However, Muir (along with Clark) reformed the band a year later with a new lineup, releasing the albums &quot;Freedumb&quot; (1999) and &quot;Free Your Soul and Save My Mind&quot; (2000). Suicidal Tendencies&#x27; recorded output was minimal for the remainder of the 2000s, continuing mostly as a live band albeit occasionally performing new songs in concert and releasing them on split albums or compilation albums, including &quot;Friends &amp; Family, Vol. 2&quot; (2001) and &quot;Year of the Cycos&quot; (2008). The band returned to releasing new studio albums in the 2010s, starting with an album of re-recorded material, &quot;No Mercy Fool!/The Suicidal Family&quot; (2010), followed by two albums with all-new original material: &quot;13&quot; (2013) and &quot;World Gone Mad&quot; (2016); both albums were well-received by critics, and considered comebacks for Suicidal Tendencies. Their most recent releases are the EP &quot;Get Your Fight On!&quot; and an album featuring unreleased and re-recorded material, &quot;Still Cyco Punk After All These Years&quot;, both released in 2018. The band is currently working on new material for their fifteenth studio album.

==History==
===Early career and &quot;Suicidal Tendencies&quot; (1980–1986)===
Suicidal Tendencies was formed in 1980 as a punk band in Venice, California. The original lineup of the band consisted of Mike Muir on vocals, Mike Ball on guitar, Carlos &quot;Egie&quot; Egert on drums, and Mike Dunnigan on bass. After the recording of their first demo, Carlos Egert left the band and was replaced by Dunnigan&#x27;s brother, Sean. Muir, at the time a student at Santa Monica College, originally only intended Suicidal Tendencies as a &quot;party band&quot;, but as they grew in notoriety he soon found the band at the center of his life. Suicidal Tendencies had a rough start, including being voted &quot;Worst Band/Biggest Assholes&quot; by &quot;Flipside&quot; in 1982 but the following year were voted &quot;Best New Band&quot;. There were many rumors of the band being involved with gangs, and their concerts were known for violence.

In their original lineup photo, which can be seen inside their self-titled debut album, drummer Amery Smith is wearing a flipped up hat and under the bill are the markings &quot;V13&quot;, thought to be initials for Venice 13. Smith was not a member of V13 and the hat worn in the photo was borrowed from V13 member Steve Mayorga, brother of Suicidal Tendencies bassist Louiche Mayorga. Eventually another gang sprang up possibly named after the band, the Suicidal Cycos (also known as the Suicidals, Suis or Suicidal Boyz) with chapters in Venice, Long Beach, Santa Monica, Orange County, Oceanside, San Diego, and in San Antonio, Texas.
Suicidal Tendencies quickly gained a following and began performing at larger gigs. They recorded a demo in 1982 and were featured on the &quot;Slamulation&quot; compilation album on Mystic Records. The song featured was &quot;I Saw Your Mommy&quot;, which was later featured on their self-titled debut album. The Dunnigan brothers quit after these recordings, with Mike Dunnigan later joining Tony Alva&#x27;s band the Skoundrelz to be back with Mike Ball on guitar and Bela Horvath on drums. Ball stayed in the band for 2½ years before joining the Skoundrelz and was replaced by Dunnigan. Guitarist Rick Battson recorded the demo before the first album. Grant Estes learned that demo replacing him on guitar and playing on Suicidal Tendencies&#x27;s first record.

In 1983, Suicidal Tendencies signed with the independent label Frontier Records and released their self-titled debut. It was described by critic Steve Huey as &quot;Fast, furious, and funny... Mike Muir proves himself an articulate lyricist and commentator, delving into subjects like alienation, depression, and nonconformist politics with intelligence and humor.&quot; It contained the song &quot;Institutionalized&quot;, which featured a music video that became one of the first hardcore punk videos to receive substantial MTV airplay, and greatly expanded the band&#x27;s fan base. Prior to creating the &quot;Institutionalized&quot; video, the band appeared on an episode of the MTV program, &quot;The Cutting Edge&quot;, which generated some criticism by fans who regarded MTV as too mainstream; criticism to which Muir responded, &quot;I think it was the best thing that&#x27;s been on MTV! It&#x27;s a helluva lot better to see Suicidal Tendencies on [MTV] than it is to see Duran Duran.&quot; The song &quot;Institutionalized&quot; was later featured in the 1984 film &quot;Repo Man&quot;, as well as in a 1986 episode of the TV show &quot;Miami Vice&quot; which also featured a cameo appearance of the group performing in a club. Soon after the release of their debut album in 1983, Estes left the band and was replaced by Jon Nelson.

That same year was the beginning of Suicidal Tendencies&#x27;s four-year recording hiatus and Mike Muir and bassist Louiche Mayorga formed the label Suicidal Records as well as the band Los Cycos. After some lineup changes the band recorded the song &quot;It&#x27;s Not Easy&quot; written by Muir. &quot;Welcome to Venice&quot; was the first record to be released on Suicidal Records; the original masters were later destroyed in a fire. In 1989, Suicidal Tendencies re-recorded &quot;It&#x27;s Not Easy&quot; for their release &quot;Controlled By Hatred/Feel Like Shit... DejaVu&quot; album. The other Los Cycos track &quot;A Little Each Day&quot; which never made it to the album, was re-recorded for the 1987 Suicidal Tendencies release &quot;Join the Army&quot; and again on &quot;Still Cyco After All These Years&quot; released in 1993. In 2000 it resurfaced on the &quot;FNG&quot; compilation and a fourth time on 2008&#x27;s (split) album &quot;Lights...Camera...Revolution!/Still Cyco After All These Years&quot;. The band found a new label in Caroline Records in 1986.

===New musical direction and new members (1987–1989)===

With the line-up of Muir, Louiche Mayorga, George, and Herrera, the band released their second album, &quot;Join the Army&quot;, in 1987. The album was met with a mixed reaction from longtime fans due to its considerably more metal-oriented sound (an element brought to the table by Rocky George), as they were expecting another punk album. Nonetheless, &quot;Join the Army&quot; featured classic tracks such as the title track, &quot;War Inside My Head&quot; and &quot;Possessed to Skate&quot; (which featured a video, originally intended for an unsuccessful skateboard movie, which featured Timothy Leary).

Shortly afterwards, the band made some major changes. George&#x27;s metal influences (reflected in his Motörhead-esque songwriting contributions to &quot;Join the Army&quot;) began in turn influencing Muir, who replaced Keven Guercio as singer for Mike Clark&#x27;s speed metal band No Mercy prior to this. Muir hired Clark as a rhythm guitarist for Suicidal. Clark helped handle much of the band&#x27;s songwriting, which progressed into a more thrash-oriented musical direction. He fired Mayorga, who had been trying to keep the band in punk territory, and was replaced briefly by No Mercy bassist Ric Clayton, who was replaced by Bob Heathcote. Shortly after the band was picked up by Anthrax producer Mark Dodson and signed to the Columbia subsidiary Epic Records. 

The band&#x27;s first release with Epic was &quot;How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can&#x27;t Even Smile Today&quot;, released in 1988. The album was mostly stripped of the band&#x27;s punk and hardcore roots, instead featuring a thrash-oriented sound with more complex song structures and a greater emphasis on instrumental skill than the band had ever shown previously. However, the album was considerably more melodic than most thrash metal albums, perhaps a lasting influence of the band&#x27;s punk past. Singles and music videos were released for &quot;Trip at the Brain&quot; and the title track, which were successful and helped expand the bands audience. That same year the band was thanked by country musician Hank Williams Jr. at the 1988 CMA Awards; Williams&#x27; son was apparently a fan of Suicidal Tendencies.

In early 1989, Heathcote (who at the time was a father of one child) left the band to support his family and was replaced by Robert Trujillo, who joined Suicidal Tendencies right before their summer European tour with Anthrax. Later that year, Suicidal Tendencies released their fourth album (also referred to as a compilation of two EPs), &quot;Controlled By Hatred/Feel Like Shit...Déjà Vu&quot;. Although Trujillo appeared in the videos that promoted the album, he was not a member of the band at the time of its recording; bass duties were reportedly handled by Rocky George and Mike Clark. &quot;Controlled by Hatred...&quot; featured two versions of &quot;How Will I Laugh Tomorrow&quot;: the video version (the original song cut down for radio/video airplay) and the &quot;heavy emotion&quot; version (a semi-unplugged, more mellow version of the song). In addition to those two versions of &quot;How Will I Laugh Tomorrow&quot;, as well as two new original cuts (&quot;Just Another Love Song&quot; and &quot;Feel Like Shit...Deja Vu&quot;), the album includes four covers of No Mercy songs (&quot;Master of No Mercy&quot;, &quot;Waking the Dead&quot;, &quot;Controlled by Hatred&quot; and &quot;Choosing My Own Way of Life&quot;) and a cover version of Los Cycos&#x27; only-known existing track &quot;It&#x27;s Not Easy&quot;. The album featured the hit &quot;Waking the Dead&quot;, which at seven minutes was one of the most progressive tracks the band had released to date, and had a music video that received considerable airplay by &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; on MTV. &quot;Controlled By Hatred...&quot; eventually went gold, the first of only two Suicidal albums to do so.

===Height of popularity and funk-oriented era (1990–1993)===

In 1990, Suicidal Tendencies released the album that many fans consider to be their masterpiece, and the album that almost broke them into the rock mainstream, &quot;Lights...Camera...Revolution!&quot;. This album featured the same line-up as &quot;Controlled By Hatred...&quot;, with Trujillo on bass guitar. The songs were much more complex than on any other Suicidal album, some songs bordering on progressive metal, but also showed a new influence courtesy of Trujillo, funk. To accompany the album, Suicidal Tendencies released the home video &quot;Lights...Camera...Suicidal&quot;. The album was a hit, and featured the singles &quot;You Can&#x27;t Bring Me Down&quot;, &quot;Send Me Your Money&quot;, and the melodic thrash song &quot;Alone&quot;. All three singles were successful and its music videos (especially for &quot;You Can&#x27;t Bring Me Down&quot;) became staples on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;; this new-found popularity helped Suicidal Tendencies gain a wider audience in the heavy metal community, despite being commonly accused of &quot;selling out&quot; in the hardcore circle, and eventually resulted in &quot;Lights...Camera...Revolution!&quot; reaching gold status and being nominated for a Grammy award (losing to Metallica). The success of the album also led to the band&#x27;s first show in Los Angeles in years, in addition to headlining major U.S. tours (with a variety of acts such as Pantera, Exodus, Armored Saint, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, 24-7 Spyz, White Zombie and Leeway), their appearance on the European Clash of the Titans tour (with Megadeth, Slayer and Testament) and supporting Queensrÿche on their &quot;Empire&quot; tour.

Muir eventually became interested in the funk music that Trujillo had brought to the table of Suicidal Tendencies&#x27; influences. As a result, the two formed a funk metal side project in the vein of early Red Hot Chili Peppers called Infectious Grooves. Also recruiting ex-Jane&#x27;s Addiction drummer Stephen Perkins and Excel guitarist Adam Siegel, Infectious Grooves released their debut, &quot;The Plague That Makes Your Booty Move...It&#x27;s the Infectious Grooves&quot;, which featured Ozzy Osbourne singing the line &quot;therapy&quot; in the song &quot;Therapy&quot; in 1991. This helped expand Suicidal Tendencies&#x27; fan base into a wider audience that included members of the alternative rock community (funk metal was a popular alternative metal style at the time).

Herrera left Suicidal Tendencies in 1991 due to personal differences. The rest of the band continued as an incomplete four-piece for about a year, drafting now-famous drummer Josh Freese to record their new album which would become &quot;The Art of Rebellion&quot;, released in 1992. The album was very different from anything Suicidal Tendencies had done before, but it was actually their most melodic, accessible album to date. It lessened the bands thrash influences, instead focusing on a unique, almost alternative metal sound, with more emphasis on funk and progressive rock, as well as traditional metal guitars. Despite the experimentation, and the fact that it was released at a time when grunge became more successful than hard rock and heavy metal, &quot;The Art of Rebellion&quot; was greeted warmly by most fans and many critics, and garnered Suicidal Tendencies their highest chart position to date on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (reaching at number 52), and producing three hits: &quot;Asleep at the Wheel&quot;, &quot;Nobody Hears&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Hate You Better&quot;, all of which were successful on the Billboard singles charts. During the accompanying tour for &quot;The Art of Rebellion&quot;, the band had performed at mostly arenas and stadiums worldwide, sharing the stage with such mainstream rock staples as Metallica, Megadeth, Kiss, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Queensrÿche, Danzig, Alice in Chains, Faith No More and White Zombie, where they earned a wide reputation as an excellent live act. Also during this period, Suicidal Tendencies had found a permanent replacement for Herrera, former White Lion and Y&amp;T drummer Jimmy DeGrasso.

Now at their commercial peak, Suicidal Tendencies released &quot;Still Cyco After All These Years&quot; in 1993. The album was a re-recording of Suicidal Tendencies&#x27;s self-titled debut album with three additional songs (two re-recordings of &quot;Join the Army&quot; tracks, and the B-side to the 1990 single &quot;Send Me Your Money&quot;). It featured singles for the re-recorded versions of &quot;Institutionalized&quot; and &quot;I Saw Your Mommy&quot;, which managed to do well, as did the album. That same year also saw the release of another Infectious Grooves album, &quot;Sarsippius&#x27; Ark&quot;, which included new tracks as well as demo recordings of old songs, and live tracks.

===&quot;Suicidal for Life&quot;, disbandment and reunion (1994–2001)===
Disturbed by their recent commercial success and fame, and fear that the band was no longer relevant in the underground, Suicidal Tendencies released &quot;Suicidal for Life&quot; in 1994. The album was intended by the band to be the least accessible album they had released, starting out by having four consecutive songs with the word &quot;fuck&quot; in the title, and switching to a more aggressive style than on their previous studio album. &quot;Suicidal for Life&quot; was widely considered to be a disappointing album by critics, many of which claimed Muir had &quot;dumbed down&quot; his lyrical approach from previous albums. Fans also had a generally mixed reaction, although their reaction was more favorable than critics&#x27;.

Muir&#x27;s strategy worked, however. Despite obtaining the band&#x27;s second-highest chart position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 82, the album did not sell nearly as well as the past four Suicidal Tendencies records (although it did sell decently on the band&#x27;s reputation alone) and one of its singles, &quot;Love Vs. Loneliness&quot;, featured a gloomy music video that hurt the song&#x27;s airplay. One of the other singles, &quot;What You Need&#x27;s a Friend&quot;, did however receive good rotation on album-oriented radio stations, the most notable being KNAC.

It was also around this time the band, whose contract with Epic Records had expired, began to fall apart, and folded after a tour in 1995. Muir and Trujillo continued Infectious Grooves, releasing &quot;Groove Family Cyco&quot; later that year (this album was released before Suicidal Tendencies split), but they eventually folded as well, with Trujillo joining Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s band (and later Black Label Society and Metallica) and Muir performing as Cyco Miko, releasing &quot;Lost My Brain! (Once Again)&quot;. Rocky George formed the group Samsara and played in 40 Cycle Hum and Cro-Mags after Suicidal Tendencies&#x27;s breakup, eventually joining Fishbone. Mike Clark joined a band called Creeper, while Jimmy DeGrasso joined Dave Mustaine&#x27;s side project MD.45, and eventually replaced Nick Menza in Megadeth, who recruited guitarist Anthony Gallo (Suicidal Tendencies, Los Cycos) for his solo record entitled &quot;Life After Deth&quot;.

Around 1996, Suicidal Tendencies had reunited, with Muir and Clark hiring lead guitarist Dean Pleasants (formerly of Infectious Grooves), new bassist Josh Paul and new drummer Brooks Wackerman (formerly of Bad4Good, Infectious Grooves and Bad Religion, now with Avenged Sevenfold) as the respective replacements of George, Trujillo, and DeGrasso. Coinciding with the reunion, a greatest hits compilation, &quot;Prime Cuts&quot;, was released in 1997 by their former record company, apparently against the band&#x27;s will.

The band released their first new material in almost half a decade, the &quot;Six the Hard Way&quot; EP in 1998, which also included two live tracks. Released on Suicidal Records, this EP saw the band switching back to their original punk metal and skatepunk style (with songs originally recorded by Cyco Miko covered). This, along with the absence of George and Trujillo, upset many of the bands metal-era fans, but fans of the older punk Suicidal Tendencies warmly welcomed the new style.

The band stuck to a similar formula for &quot;Freedumb&quot;, released in 1999. Despite generally bad reviews from critics (who claimed that the band had &quot;dumbed themselves down&quot; not only lyrically, but musically as well) it was considered by fans of the band as their &quot;comeback album&quot;, with the title track, &quot;Cyco Vision&quot; and &quot;We Are A Family&quot; becoming fan favorites (although no singles from the album were released).

The following year Suicidal Tendencies released &quot;Free Your Soul and Save My Mind&quot;. Unlike its predecessor, which was more straightforward hardcore, this album saw the band covering most of the styles they had dabbled with in the past. Some songs were punk, but many of them were also thrash-oriented, and this was by far Suicidal Tendencies&#x27;s funkiest album yet. Fans and critics greeted the album warmly, and a new single, &quot;Pop Song&quot;, was released.

Infectious Grooves released their fourth and comeback album &quot;Mas Borracho&quot; in 2000, followed by Muir&#x27;s second solo album as Cyco Miko, &quot;Schizophrenic Born Again Problem Child&quot;, in 2001.

Suicidal Tendencies featured a new song on the &quot;Friends &amp; Family, Vol. 2&quot; compilation in 2001; after then, the band fell silent again.

===Years of touring and lineup changes (2001–2012)===
Wackerman (who had just joined Bad Religion) had left Suicidal Tendencies by 2001 while the band was on tour. Greg Saenz joined the band before Ron Bruner took over drum duties and Paul also left by the following year but was replaced by his brother Steve. The band toured during 2003, but were forced take another hiatus in 2004 due to Mike Muir requiring surgery for a back injury.
While the band failed to release an album with material, independently or otherwise, Suicidal Tendencies have continued to tour consistently since 2005. On October 29 of that year their live performance at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles was filmed. Suicidal Tendencies secured a spot in the metal/punk rock Soundwave Festival in Australia in February and March 2007, taking in Brisbane, Sydney and Perth. They performed at the Artefact Festival in France on April 29, 2007, and performed in Istanbul, Turkey on May 29. They also headlined the Tuborg Stage at the Download Festival, held at Donington Park, UK on Friday June 8, 2007, and closed select shows for the &quot;Sounds of the Underground&quot; tour in San Jose, California on August 3, Irvine, California on August 4, and Mesa, Arizona on August 5. On August 1, 2008, Suicidal Tendencies headlined the Porão do Rock Festival in Brasília in front of 15,000 people. By this stage Eric Moore had replaced Dave Hidalgo on drums. During the fall of 2008, the band toured with Madball, Terror, and Death by Stereo, opening select dates. During this tour &quot;Year of the Cycos&quot; – a compilation album featuring Suicidal Tendencies, Infectious Grooves, Cyco Miko and No Mercy – was available for the first time for purchase at the concerts or from their official website. From the album, the original track &quot;Come Alive&quot; was released as a video clip. The band replaced As I Lay Dying on the first five shows of the &quot;No Fear Energy Music Tour&quot; with Lamb of God. Suicidal Tendencies toured Europe from June through July 2009.

The first Suicidal Tendencies DVD &quot;Live at the Olympic Auditorium&quot;, featuring the full show recorded in Los Angeles back in 2005, was released on January 26, 2010, by Fontana Distribution via the band&#x27;s own imprint, Suicidal Records. On the same day, a was released as part of the &quot;Playlist&quot; music album series issued by Sony BMG.

In September 2010, Suicidal Tendencies released the album &quot;No Mercy Fool!/The Suicidal Family&quot; which consists of re-recordings of tracks from the &quot;Join the Army&quot; album and of old No Mercy songs, plus the previously released &quot;Come Alive&quot;.

===&quot;13&quot; and &quot;World Gone Mad&quot; (2013–2017)===

Suicidal Tendencies released &quot;13&quot;, their first album with new material in 13 years, on March 26, 2013. The band spent the next few years touring in support of the album, with such bands as D.R.I., Sick of It All, Slayer, Exodus, Slipknot, Beartooth, Megadeth, Children of Bodom and Havok. They also headlined the 2014 Persistence Tour, and appeared at many festivals such as Riot Fest in 2013, Amnesia Rockfest in 2014 and Motörhead&#x27;s Motörboat cruise and Knotfest in both 2015.

On March 11, 2014, Thomas Pridgen (former drummer of the Mars Volta) confirmed on his Instagram and Facebook page that he had joined Suicidal Tendencies. By the fall of 2014, Pridgen was no longer playing in Suicidal Tendencies, and Eric Moore rejoined the band.

On August 27, 2014, Suicidal Tendencies announced that bassist Tim Williams had died. Rawbiz was replaced by Michael Morgan, and two years later by Ra Díaz.

In a December 2014 interview with &quot;Loudwire&quot;, vocalist Mike Muir was asked if Suicidal Tendencies would release a follow-up to &quot;13&quot;. He replied, &quot;Right now I have no answer to that as far as the previous one. There were a lot of things that went on and I think for us now, if everyone said they wanted to get into the studio and there was something they really wanted to do, I&#x27;d take it into consideration. But we&#x27;re in the studio all the time, we&#x27;re always recording.&quot; In an April 2015 interview with Metalhead Blog, guitarist Dean Pleasants revealed that Suicidal Tendencies had been working on new material for a possible compilation album.

In a February 2016 interview, Muir hinted at a new EP, followed by a new full-length studio album, inspired by the then-current political climate and upcoming election. He also stated that the album and EP could be the band&#x27;s final recordings, although he added, &quot;I thought the first one would probably be the last we would do, too.&quot;
On February 20, 2016, Suicidal Tendencies announced that former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo, a longtime friend and supporter of the band, would be playing drums on their February–March 2016 tour with Megadeth, and again on their May–June 2016 European tour. On May 6, 2016, guitarist Nico Santora announced on his Facebook page that he had left Suicidal Tendencies to focus on his new project Lillake. He was replaced by Oneironaut guitarist Jeff Pogan.

On May 15, 2016, Suicidal Tendencies posted a video of Lombardo laying down tracks for the band&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;13&quot;, which was expected to be released in September. This video implied that Lombardo had become a permanent member of Suicidal Tendencies. On June 17, 2016, Suicidal Tendencies announced in a newsletter that they were in the final stages of mixing the new album, which was expected to be released on September 30, 2016. Mike Muir revealed in June 2016 interviews that the album would be called &quot;The World Gone Mad&quot;, and that the band planned to release a new EP in January 2017. However, the title of the album was later shortened to &quot;World Gone Mad&quot;. It was supported by the band&#x27;s first single in 22 years (since 1994&#x27;s &quot;Love Vs. Loneliness&quot;) &quot;Clap Like Ozzy&quot;. To promote &quot;World Gone Mad&quot;, Suicidal Tendencies supported Megadeth, Amon Amarth and Metal Church on the &quot;Dystopia&quot; tour in the United States in September–October 2016, and headlined two tours in 2017: the Persistence Tour with Agnostic Front in Europe in January, and a U.S. tour in February–March with Crowbar and Havok. Muir had stated in interviews that &quot;World Gone Mad&quot; may be Suicidal Tendencies&#x27; final studio album, though he later retracted this statement, saying, &quot;You can&#x27;t believe what anybody says nowadays — everybody&#x27;s effin&#x27; lyin&#x27;.&quot;

===&quot;Get Your Fight On!&quot;, &quot;Still Cyco Punk After All These Years&quot; and upcoming fifteenth studio album (2018–present)===
On December 1, 2017, Suicidal Tendencies announced that they had completed work on a new EP with producer Paul Northfield for an early 2018 release. Muir has described the EP as &quot;a little more specifically a statement of the time&quot; and an effort that &quot;could be interpreted as political.&quot; The EP, &quot;Get Your Fight On!&quot;, was released on March 9, 2018, and was the first of two releases the band had planned for release that year; the second being a new full-length, &quot;Still Cyco Punk After All These Years&quot;, released on September 7, 2018. The latter is a near re-recording of Cyco Miko&#x27;s first album &quot;Lost My Brain! (Once Again)&quot;.

On July 2, 2018, it was announced that guitarist Jeff Pogan had left Suicidal Tendencies for personal reasons. Former The Dillinger Escape Plan guitarist Ben Weinman filled in for him on the band&#x27;s summer and fall 2018 shows.

In March 2019, Weinman announced on his Twitter page that he was in the studio tracking down new material for the next Suicidal Tendencies album. In a July 2020 interview with Ultimate Guitar, however, Weinman stated that &quot;there hasn&#x27;t been any music made&quot;, but also stated that &quot;maybe when all this comes back, when things go back to normal, we can think about that.&quot;

On March 18, 2020, Muir announced on Suicidal Tendencies&#x27; Facebook page that they are working on an &quot;old-school vinyl release&quot; featuring instrumental &quot;songs from ST members and people related to ST.&quot;
Drummer Brandon Pertzborn had filled in Lombardo (who around this time had joined Mr. Bungle and Testament) as a drummer for the band as well as Tye Trujillo filling as a bassist, most likely due to the relationship his father, Robert Trujillo has with the band. Weinman announced that there would be new Suicidal Tendencies shows soon. On January 7 2023, the official Suicidal Tendencies social media account streamed what seemed to be a new song for a new album.

Drummer Greyson Nekrutman announced on April 18, 2023 via his social media page that he would be joining Suicidal Tendencies as the replacement of Brandon Pertzborn, who later joined The Offspring. In February of the following year, Nekrutman left the band to join Sepultura on their final world tour and was replaced by current Infectious Grooves and former Slipknot drummer Jay Weinberg.

On July 5, 2024, Suicidal Tendencies released a new version of their 1999 track &quot;We Are Family&quot; entirely in Portuguese under the title &quot;Nós Somos Família&quot;. This marked the band&#x27;s first song with Weinman, Trujillo and Weinberg, and included additional vocals by Brazilian musicians Badauí (CPM 22), João Gordo (Ratos de Porão), B Negão (Planet Hemp), Rodrigo Lima (Dead Fish), Supla, Fernanda Lira (Crypta), Milton Aguiar (Bayside Kings), Mayara Puertas (Torture Squad), Felipe Ribeiro (Treva), Pirata Homes (Anjo dos Becos), Ya Amaral (Eskrota), Júnior Bass, as well as football player Marinho and skateboarder Sandro Dias. Thiago Castanho and Marcão Britto also provided guitar on the track.

==Style and influence==
While their early material, including their first album, is considered hardcore punk, the band is well known for combining elements of thrash metal with funk, punk rock and alternative rock. Critics have also described Suicidal Tendencies as &quot;the godfathers&quot; of the genre crossover thrash, which they have been credited for creating along with Texas-based band D.R.I. and New York-based Stormtroopers of Death.

Various artists have expressed their admiration for Suicidal Tendencies or have cited them as an influence, including Anthrax, Body Count, Children of Bodom, Green Day, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Killswitch Engage, Megadeth, NOFX, The Offspring, Rage Against the Machine, Sepultura, Sevendust, Skrillex, Slayer, Slipknot, Soulfly, Staind, and Terror.

It was also their first album recorded with guitarist Mike Clark and their only release with bassist Bob Heathcote, who was replaced by Robert Trujillo in 1989.

==Musical style==
&quot;How Will I Laugh...&quot; is crucial to Suicidal Tendencies stylistic developments in that it sees the band abandoning most of their full-fledged punk influences in favor of a more thrash-oriented sound. One could see this stylistic changes in this album&#x27;s predecessor &quot;Join the Army&quot;, but this album had a distinctly more defined metal sound, more complex and lengthy songs, and better production values.

The addition of a rhythm guitarist Mike Clark (who had played with vocalist Mike Muir in No Mercy, which was supposed to originally be a metal-only side project) changed the band&#x27;s style heavily as well. Clark wrote much of the music for this album and gave lead guitarist Rocky George more soloing time, thus creating another factor in this album and future albums&#x27; more metal-oriented sound.

The album&#x27;s back cover shows each member standing in front of the side of the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Los Angeles, the front cover shows the members standing in front of the mausoleum next to the church. It has been renovated and expanded in the late 90&#x27;s, so it doesn&#x27;t look exactly like on the cover anymore.

== Reception ==

Reviews for &quot;How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can&#x27;t Even Smile Today&quot; have been mostly positive. AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey awards the album four-and-a-half stars out of five, and described it as &quot;one of its best efforts&quot;. For the musical direction, Huey stated, &quot;The band&#x27;s thrashy fusion of its hardcore roots with speed metal was fully developed by this point, and Mike Muir&#x27;s social commentary and self-analysis were as ragingly compelling and by turns amusing as ever.&quot; In the review made two months after the album release, &quot;RPM&quot; editors called the band one of the best of the current crop.

&quot;How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can&#x27;t Even Smile Today&quot; was moderately successful, peaking at number 111 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It remained on that chart for eleven weeks. The album featured the singles &quot;Trip at the Brain&quot; and the title track, both of which managed to become successful with their target audiences.

In August 2014, &quot;Revolver&quot; placed the album on its &quot;14 Thrash Albums You Need to Own&quot; list.

<text>Judith Ann Reisman (; April 11, 1935 – April 9, 2021) was an American conservative author, best known for her criticism and condemnation of the work and legacy of Alfred Kinsey. She has been referred to as the &quot;founder of the modern anti-Kinsey movement&quot;. During her career, Reisman occasionally served as a consultant to the U.S. Departments of Justice, Education, and Health and Human Services. She held a doctorate in communications from Case Western Reserve University, and was a visiting professor of law at Liberty University.

==Advocating for children==
Writing for AlterNet, blogger Max Blumenthal wrote about how Reisman&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s molestation set Reisman on the path of researching Kinsey&#x27;s activities. Purportedly, an investigation indicated a link between the assailant&#x27;s viewing of a pornographic magazine and the 13-year-old girl&#x27;s assault (noted in Reisman&#x27;s memorial page). Following the sexual assault, the accused boy and his family slipped out of the country, while her daughter lapsed into a deep depression. Fifteen years later, the daughter died from a brain aneurysm, which Reisman suspected was linked to the earlier trauma. 

Reisman was one of the founding members of the Reisman Institute, and served as its president until 2021. She delivered talks on child advocacy, and was the director of the Liberty Child Protection Center. She received the &quot;Protector of Children&quot; award from Citizens for Families in 2005, as well as the &quot;Save Our Children Scientist Of The Year For 1993&quot; from the Save Our Children National Alliance. She was nominated by the Inspector General for the Department of Defense to be part of the panel reviewing sexual misconduct for the US Air Force Academy in 2003.

===Children in the Kinsey reports===
Over the following years, her accusations against Kinsey became increasingly serious. She said that he was a fraud who had employed and relied on pedophiles for his research, and claimed that Kinsey himself had sexually abused children. This allegation drew a response from Kinsey biographer James H. Jones, who wrote that unless new evidence to the contrary becomes available, Reisman&#x27;s claims that Kinsey may have witnessed or personally participated in child molestation under the guise of scientific research should be considered groundless. 

Due to such ideas, she was &quot;ostracized by mainstream academia&quot;.

Prior to the release of the 2004 film &quot;Kinsey,&quot; Reisman and Laura Schlessinger attempted to place an advertisement &quot;alleging Kinsey was a pervert and a pedophile&quot;.

The Southern Poverty Law Center has described Reisman as a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; and a promoter of &quot;sexual pseudoscience&quot; in regard to her views on Kinsey. John Bancroft stated:
Reisman&#x27;s campaign against Kinsey was described by Morton Hunt (1999) as follows: &quot;To use smear tactics, methods of intimidation, and political trickery to achieve what one considers a moral end, is to live by the principle that the end justifies the means.&quot; (P. 209.)

Diederik F. Janssen has reviewed her book &quot;Sexual Sabotage: How One Mad Scientist Unleashed a Plague of Corruption and Contagion on America&quot; from a postmodern perspective. First, the observer says of her book: &quot;This takes the unseemly shape of a paranoid sermon on American decency held together by acerbic ad hominems, a tapestry of slippery slope arguments, a string of unwholesome linkages (&#x27;Nazi serial pedophiles&#x27;), and a litany of medieval, Victorian, and McCarthyian diagnostics (&#x27;plague,&#x27; &#x27;sexual psychopaths,&#x27; &#x27;sexual deviancy,&#x27; &#x27;perversions&#x27;).&quot; Then he considers that Reisman plays truth games precisely because Kinsey had invited sexologists to play truth games. Janssen sees her fault in &quot;exactly the scientific cover-up of moral dilemmas she accuses her nemesis Kinsey of. To maximize this argument: what needs criticism, &quot;on behalf of children,&quot; is scientism, not moralism.&quot; He notes that if taboos need &quot;scientific (medical) approval, their days may be numbered.&quot;

Reisman lambasted SCOTUS for trusting Kinsey&#x27;s legacy (sexology): &quot;[...] on June 26, 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court enshrined Kinsey&#x27;s fraudulent data as the revolutionary moral law of our land [...] a duplicitous sexual deviant was the primary source used by the United States Supreme Court as their &#x27;science&#x27; authority in Lawrence v. Texas.&quot;

About gay marriage she wrote to SCOTUS: &quot;this Court should not permit the institution of marriage to become the latest victim of the Kinseyan model of American society.&quot; She also wrote to the Court that mainstream sexology is &quot;an ideology built upon the sexual abuse of infants and children, and the libeling of the &#x27;Greatest Generation&#x27;.&quot; Her opponents, however, make the argument that, pedophiles had the most to lose (not win) from the sexual revolution.

The FBI could not find any felony committed by Kinsey. In the years following the death of Kinsey, as well as Senator McCarthy and his anticommunist crusade with it, Kinsey&#x27;s research only grew in public esteem and became increasingly accepted in academia in the years after his death, during which he was established as the American father of sexology.

Reisman&#x27;s book &quot;Kinsey: Crimes and Consequences; The Red Queen and the Grand Scheme&quot; was called &quot;wildly irresponsible and baffling book... Nonetheless, it contains some interesting information about the reaction to Kinsey.&quot;

===Images of children, crime and violence===

In 1983, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) was headed by social conservatives, including Alfred S. Regnery in the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP). Reisman had given a talk on a Washington, D.C. radio program and on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Crossfire&quot; about the &quot;connections between sex education, sex educators, and the pornography industry&quot; which was heard by a member of the DOJ, and Reisman was asked to discuss her views in person, which &quot;struck a common chord ... especially those opposed to sex education in the schools.&quot; She was then invited to apply for a grant, which was approved without competition for the amount of $798,531 (though later reduced to $734,371), to undertake a &quot;study at American University to determine whether Playboy, Hustler and other more explicit materials are linked to violence by juveniles.&quot; The allocation came under criticism as the grant was approved despite a staff memo from Pamela Swain, a director of research, evaluation and program development, in which she claimed that the study could be accomplished for $60,000.

By 1986, Reisman concluded her investigation of &quot;372 issues of &quot;Playboy&quot;, 184 issues of &quot;Penthouse&quot; and 125 issues of &quot;Hustler&quot;&quot; that found &quot;2,016 cartoons that included children apparently under the age of 17 and 3,988 other pictures, photographs and drawings that depict infants or youths,&quot; the details of which were collected into &quot;a three-volume report running to 1,600 pages&quot; titled &quot;Images of Children, Crime and Violence in Playboy, Penthouse, and Hustler.&quot; The report drew contemporary criticism in regards to its cost and quality. Sex crime researcher Avedon Carol commented that the report was a &quot;scientific disaster, riddled with researcher bias and baseless assumptions.&quot; The American University (AU), where Reisman&#x27;s study had been academically based, refused to publish the completed work, citing concerns by an independent academic auditor. Criminologist Robert Figlio of the University of Pennsylvania stated &quot;The term child used in the aggregate sense in this report is so inclusive and general as to be meaningless.&quot; Loretta Haroian stated about the report &quot;vigilantism: paranoid, pseudoscientific hyperbole with a thinly veiled, hidden agenda.&quot;

Author Susan Trento chronicled additional complexities surrounding the episode. Initially, Reisman was targeted by some as a proxy to attack Regnery. The nature of Reisman&#x27;s grant work and the concurrent Attorney General&#x27;s Commission on Pornography, which would author the Meese Report in 1986, caused anxiety in the pornography industry. Fears began to come to fruition when 7-Eleven stores stopped selling &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot;, in part citing Reisman&#x27;s work. Trento writes that the public relations firm headed by Robert Keith Gray was hired by &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot; &quot;to discredit Meese&#x27;s Pornography Commission&quot; specifically as well as others that threatened their business, presumably including Reisman. &quot;Whatever the merits of her research,&quot; Trento wrote, when support from the OJJDP was needed most, its leadership backed away from Reisman leaving her project to fail and leaving Reisman feeling &quot;bitter&quot; and &quot;helpless&quot; after &quot;spending years developing an expertise and doing what she thought was an excellent job in the public interest.&quot;

In 2017, Reisman became involved in a group called Investigating YouTube. Specifically, she voiced her concern about the disturbing content in YouTube videos targeted at children, involving suggestive imagery and violence while using popular children&#x27;s figures such as &quot;Frozen&quot;&#x27;s Elsa and Spider-Man.

===Sources of child sexual abuse===
When &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot; printed nude photos of Madonna in 1985, Reisman warned that because of the entertainer&#x27;s idolization by youth, their publication would destigmatize and &quot;encourage voluntary display by youngsters,&quot; leading to an increase in child pornography.

===Allegations of homosexual recruitment of children===
Reisman claimed that homosexuals employ recruitment techniques that rival those of the United States Marine Corps. Reisman cited &quot;a clear avenue for the recruitment of children&quot; by homosexuals in her public support of Oregon Ballot Measure 9 (1992).

==Erototoxins==

Reisman postulated a physical mechanism to account for the dangers she ascribed to pornography: when viewed, an addictive mixture of chemicals (such as glucose) which she dubbed &quot;erototoxins&quot;, floods the brain, causing harmful influences to it. Reisman hoped that MRI studies would prove porn-induced physical brain damage and predicted lawsuits against publishers and distributors of pornography similar to those against Big Tobacco, which resulted in the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. Further, if pornography can &quot;subvert cognition&quot;, then &quot;these toxic media should be legally outlawed, as is all other toxic waste, and eliminated from our societal structure.&quot; Finally, individuals who have suffered brain damage from &quot;pornography are no longer expressing &#x27;free speech&#x27; and, for their own good, shouldn&#x27;t be protected under the First Amendment.&quot;

Endorphins are substances produced by the brain as a result of various things including sexual arousal, physical exercise, strong pain, laughter, etc. They cause pleasurable sensations and are somewhat addictive; drugs like morphine attach to the same receptors as endorphins. However, endorphins do not fit Reisman&#x27;s definition of erototoxins, as many things cause them to be released, not only pornography.

The 2002–2011 Proceedings of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences state about her public statements about erototoxins: &quot;facts stood in the way of her opinion and testimony.&quot;
==Homosexuals and Nazism==
Reisman said that she believed that a homosexual movement in Germany gave rise to the Nazi Party and the Holocaust. She endorsed &quot;The Pink Swastika&quot;, a 1995 pseudohistorical book which expressed this view, and compared modern youth groups for homosexuals to the Hitler Youth. She equated Kinsey&#x27;s participation in the Boy Scouts with participation in the Hitler Youth.

==Mapplethorpe exhibition obscenity trial==

During the 1990 obscenity trial of Dennis Barrie, then director of the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati, for displaying controversial photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe, Reisman was called as the only expert witness for the prosecution. In the previous year, Reisman had authored an editorial in &quot;The Washington Times&quot; entitled &quot;Promoting Child Abuse as Art&quot; which &quot;accused Mapplethorpe of being both a Nazi and a child molester&quot;. The defense argued that she was not qualified as an art expert, but the judge allowed her to testify as a rebuttal witness. Among her credentials as a media specialist she listed: &quot;preparation of educational videotapes and slide presentations for the Smithsonian Institution as well as having worked for &quot;Scholastic&quot; magazine, created audio-visual segments for television&#x27;s &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; show, and did research for Attorney General Edwin Meese&#x27;s commission on pornography and for the conservative American Family Association.&quot; During her testimony, Reisman did not discuss the sexually explicit content of Mapplethorpe&#x27;s work, but rather she argued that the five photographs were not works of art because they either did not display a human face, or, in the case of &quot;Self-Portrait&quot;, the face &quot;... displayed no discernible emotion&quot; and absent emotion, the placement of the photographs in a museum implied that the activities displayed were appropriate. During cross-examination by the defense on her views of homosexuality, Reisman testified that &quot;anal sodomy is traumatically dysfunctional and is definitely associated with AIDS.&quot; She also claimed that the pictures of nude children legitimized pedophilia. The defense emphasized that Reisman&#x27;s experience with art was limited to her work as a songwriter.

Barrie and the center were acquitted of all charges by the jury.

==Litigation against the Kinsey Institute==
In 1991, Reisman, with an attorney from the Rutherford Institute, sued the Kinsey Institute, its then director June Reinisch, and Indiana University, for defamation as well as intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress regarding alleged attempts to censor her book &quot;Kinsey, Sex and Fraud&quot;. The case was ultimately dismissed with prejudice in 1994.

== Personal life ==
Reisman was the daughter of Mathew L. Gelernter and Ada née Goldberg. She married Arnold Reisman in 1955 in Los Angeles. Her family was Jewish.

== Obituaries ==

PinkNews reported on Reisman&#x27;s death, describing her as an anti-LGBT+ author of bizarre research papers. The obituary noted her claims that gay people caused the rise of the Nazi Party, her assertions that allowing gay members or staff within the Boy Scouts of America would lead to sexual predation, and her contributions towards upholding anti-sodomy laws in Jamaica.

She received praise from the John Birch Society, which stated &quot;[...] Judith Reisman repeatedly, over the past several decades, strode into many hostile enemy camps around the world — colleges, universities, legislative bodies, media outlets — to speak truth to power and to expose vile works of darkness.&quot;

Robert Knight said in &quot;The Washington Times&quot; that &quot;she was cast as a careless, right-wing fanatic&quot;, was scorned even by &quot;conservatives who were afraid of guilt by association&quot;, and that she had converted to Christianity.

<doc id="157315" wikidata="Q5420767" url="?curid=157315" title="Expanding nozzle">
<text>The expanding nozzle is a type of rocket nozzle that, unlike traditional designs, maintains its efficiency at a wide range of altitudes. It is a member of the class of altitude compensating nozzles, a class that also includes the plug nozzle and aerospike. While the expanding nozzle is the least technically advanced and simplest to understand from a modeling point of view, it also appears to be the most difficult design to build.

In the traditional bell nozzle the engine skirt is shaped to gradually flare out from the small-diameter exit from the combustion chamber, growing larger further from the chamber. The basic idea is to lower the pressure of the exhaust by expanding it in the nozzle, until it reaches ambient air pressure at the exit. For operations at sea level
the skirt is generally short and highly angled, at least in comparison to a skirt designed for operations in space, which are longer and more gradually shaped. This means that a rocket engine that spends any significant amount of time climbing through the atmosphere cannot be optimally shaped; as it climbs the ambient pressure changes, so the exact shape and length of the skirt would have to change in order to maintain the proper pressure. Rocket designers have to select the sweet spot that is most appropriate to their needs, realizing that this will reduce thrust by as much as 30% at other altitudes.

The expanding nozzle addresses this to a degree by including two skirts on a single engine, one inside the other. The first skirt, attached directly to the combustion chamber, is designed for use at lower altitudes and is short and squat. The second, sitting outside the first, fits over the lower altitude bell to extend it into a longer and narrower (measured in terms of length) bell used for higher altitudes. At liftoff the outer bell is pulled up from the inner bell, out of the way of the exhaust. As the spacecraft climbs, the outer bell is pushed back down over the inner bell to increase the thrust efficiency. Thus an expanding nozzle can have two sweet spots, which can lead to a major improvement in overall performance.

Generally simple in concept, the expanding nozzle is considerably more complex to build than it might seem. Engine bells must be cooled to avoid damage from the hot rocket exhaust, and this has presented problems in expanding nozzle designs. The cooling is normally accomplished by running either the oxidizer or fuel (in the case of LH2 fueled engines) through tubing in the bell. With the bell moving, plumbing carrying the coolant to the bell has to be flexible and this increases complexity to the extent that the advantages of the design are often considered too costly. In the case of liquid hydrogen, the fluid also has the disadvantage of being highly reactive chemically, making a variety of common flexible materials unsuitable for use in this role.

For the aforementioned reasons modern designs (e. g. NK-33-1, RL-10A-4, and RL-10B-2) feature radiatively cooled reinforced carbon–carbon nozzle extensions needing no coolant plumbing at all.

The first engine design to include an expanding nozzle appears to be the Pratt &amp; Whitney XLR-129. The XLR-129 was intended to power a McDonnell Aircraft boost-glide aircraft design that was entered as part of the Project ISINGLASS (or RHEINBERRY) study looking at follow-on designs to replace the Lockheed A-12 that was just entering service. It was a liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen design that used staged combustion and generated about thrust. An enlarged version of the XLR-129 was proposed for the Space Shuttle Main Engine contest, but this was won by the RS-25, an enlarged Rocketdyne HG-3. Since these engines are fired from the point of liftoff into extra-atmospheric space flight, any sort of altitude compensation could dramatically improve their overall performance. The expanding nozzle was later abandoned in a cost-cutting phase, and the RS-25 suffers a 25% loss of performance at low altitude as a result.

Glushko has used an expanding nozzle on one design, the RD-701 tripropellant rocket. Funding ran out with the fall of the Soviet state, but the designers are convinced the engine has potential and have approached several parties for additional funding.

<doc id="157317" wikidata="Q12605475" url="?curid=157317" title="Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States">
<text>Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241 (1964), was a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States holding that the Commerce Clause gave the U.S. Congress power to force private businesses to abide by Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or national origin in public accommodations.

== Background ==
This important case represented an immediate challenge to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the landmark piece of civil rights legislation, which represented the first comprehensive act by Congress on civil rights and race relations since the Civil Rights Act of 1875. In the 100 years preceding 1964, African Americans in the United States had been subjected to racial segregation, a system of racial separation which, while in name providing for &quot;separate but equal&quot; treatment of both white and African Americans, in fact provided inferior accommodation, services, and treatment for African Americans.

During the mid-20th century, partly as a result of cases such as &quot;Powell v. Alabama&quot;, 287 U.S. 45 (1932); &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot;, 321 U.S. 649 (1944); &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot;, 334 U.S. 1 (1948); &quot;Sweatt v. Painter&quot;, 339 U.S. 629 (1950); &quot;McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents&quot;, 339 U.S. 637 (1950); &quot;NAACP v. Alabama&quot;, 357 U.S. 449 (1958); &quot;Boynton v. Virginia&quot;, 364 U.S. 454 (1960); and, most notably, &quot;Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka&quot;, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), public opinion began to turn against segregation. Despite the outcomes of these cases, segregation remained in full effect into the 1960s in parts of the southern United States, where the Heart of Atlanta Motel was located.

== Court case ==

=== Petitioner&#x27;s argument ===
The Heart of Atlanta Motel was a large, 216-room motel that opened on September 5, 1956 in Atlanta, Georgia. In direct violation of the terms of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned racial discrimination in public places, largely based on Congress&#x27;s control of interstate commerce, the motel refused to rent rooms to African-American patrons. The owner, Moreton Rolleston, filed suit in federal court, arguing that the requirements of the Act exceeded the authority the Commerce Clause granted to Congress over interstate commerce. Rolleston specifically argued against Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or national origin in places of public accommodation. Hotels and motels are included as types of public accommodation in the Act, and so are restaurants that serve food substantially to those who participate in interstate travel. In further arguing against the validity of the Act&#x27;s basis on the Commerce Clause, he stated that people themselves are not commerce; rather, people engage in commerce. Therefore, a hotel or motel does not necessarily engage in interstate commerce because the profit comes from persons rather than goods. Rolleston also asserted that racial discrimination by an individual is not prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment or the Constitution, claiming that discrimination is a private wrong that individuals are allowed to commit.

In addition, Rolleston maintained that it violated his Fifth Amendment rights to choose customers and operate his business as he wished and resulted in unjust deprivation of his property without due process of law and just compensation. Finally, he contended that Congress had placed him in a position of involuntary servitude by forcing him to rent available rooms to African Americans, thereby violating his Thirteenth Amendment rights. Rolleston noted that in 1944 the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for the United States held that even if acts committed in involuntary servitude are compensated, it still violates the Thirteenth Amendment.

Rolleston maintained throughout his argument that the Constitution should be interpreted as it was at the time of its creation and as the Framers originally intended it. He concluded his opening argument by stating that the Supreme Court did not need to exist if the Commerce Clause allowed for Congress to enact any regulations it pleases.

=== Respondent&#x27;s argument ===
In response, Archibald Cox, the Solicitor General for the United States, countered that the restrictions requiring adequate accommodation for African Americans were unquestionably related to interstate travel and that Congress, under the Constitution&#x27;s Commerce Clause, certainly had the power to address such a matter in law. Cox stated that racial discrimination in inns and restaurants “constitute[s] a source of burden or obstruction to interstate commerce.” He brought up multiple examples in which protests over racial discrimination, some in regards to public accommodations and some with broader scopes, intensely affected the economy of certain areas. One of the prime examples was Birmingham, Alabama in the spring of 1963, during which department and downtown store sales dropped dramatically in the area and the amount of business failure rivaled the rates of the Great Depression. Cox also mentioned that areas that do not practice equal opportunity are often overlooked by companies that seek commercial and industrial expansion due to the possibility of demonstrations. He used Little Rock, Arkansas to exemplify this point, as business expansion fell by over 50 million dollars in the two years it experienced high racial tensions.

Cox also highlighted how discrimination by hotels and motels hinders interstate travel by limiting the availability of accommodations for travelers. He described the impediment discrimination imposes with a hypothetical road trip:On a motor trip between Washington D.C. and Miami, Florida, the average distance that was found between accommodations of reasonable quality open to Negroes was 141 miles. And when we think of the frequency by such we go by other hotels and motels open to everyone, the significance of a three or four-hour drive between the hope of accommodation is very significant indeed.

— Archibald CoxHe further argued that the Fifth Amendment does not forbid reasonable regulation of interstate commerce and that such incidental damage did not constitute the &quot;taking&quot; of property without just compensation or due process of law. He emphasized that the courts have consistently sustained cases that strengthen anti-discrimination measures. Lastly, he asserted that the Thirteenth Amendment applies primarily to slavery and the removal of widespread disabilities associated with it and so it undoubtedly would not place issues of racial discrimination in public accommodations beyond the reach of federal and state law:But surely it would turn the world quite upside down for anyone to seriously suggest that the Thirteenth Amendment was intended to prohibit either Congress or the state governments from guaranteeing Negroes equality of treatment in places of public accommodation.

— Archibald Cox

=== Ruling ===
On July 22 1964, the three judge panel for the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia ruled in favor of the United States. It issued a permanent injunction requiring the Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. to refrain from using racial discrimination when providing services or goods to guests or the general public on its premises. The case was combined with the case of the future Governor of Georgia Lester Maddox, regarding his Pickrick restaurant and his refusal to serve African Americans.

The plaintiffs appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which unanimously upheld the District Court ruling. The opinion of the court, announced on December 14, 1964, was delivered by Justice Tom C. Clark, with concurring opinions by Justices Arthur Goldberg, Hugo Black, and William O. Douglas.

The ruling held that Congress acted well within its authority under the Commerce Clause in passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, thereby upholding the act&#x27;s Title II in question. While it might have been possible for Congress to pursue other methods for abolishing racial discrimination, the way in which Congress did so, according to the Court, was perfectly valid. It found no merit in the arguments pursuant to the Thirteenth Amendment, finding it difficult to conceive that such an amendment might be applicable in restraining civil rights legislation. Having observed that 75% of the Heart of Atlanta Motel&#x27;s clientele came from out-of-state and that it was strategically located near Interstates 75 and 85 as well as two major Georgia highways, the Court found that the business clearly affected interstate commerce. Accordingly, it upheld the permanent injunction issued by the district court and required the Heart of Atlanta Motel to receive business from the clientele of all ethnicities.

== Case legacy ==
&quot;Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States&quot; has been cited in at least 690 other case decisions since its ruling, including multiple other Supreme Court cases. In the 1997 case &quot;Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison&quot; a summer camp in Maine that mainly serviced out-of-state residents fought against a state tax exemption statute that favored organizations that serviced state residents. The courts compared out-of-state campers staying at a summer camp to out-of-state residents occupying a hotel, deeming the camp a participant in interstate commerce. Another example is the 1966 case &quot;United States v. Guest&quot;, in which the courts ruled, due to the conspiratorial murder of Lt. Col. Lemuel Penn while he was traveling home, that forcefully depriving someone&#x27;s right to travel is unconstitutional.

<doc id="157320" wikidata="Q583612" url="?curid=157320" title="The Rocky Horror Show">
<text>The Rocky Horror Show is a musical with music, lyrics and book by Richard O&#x27;Brien. A humorous tribute to various B movies associated with the science fiction and horror genres from the 1930s to the early 1960s, the musical tells the story of a newly engaged couple getting caught in a storm and coming to the home of a mad transvestite scientist, Dr Frank-N-Furter, unveiling his new creation, Rocky, a sort of Frankenstein-style monster in the form of an artificially made, fully grown, physically perfect muscle man complete &quot;with blond hair and a tan&quot;.

The show was produced and directed by Jim Sharman. The original London production of the musical was premiered at the Royal Court Theatre (Upstairs) on 19 June 1973 (after two previews on 16 and 18 June 1973). It later moved to several other locations in London and closed on 13 September 1980. The show ran for a total of 2,960 performances in London and won the 1973 &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Theatre Award for Best Musical. Songs in the musical include &quot;Time Warp&quot; and &quot;Sweet Transvestite&quot; (co-written by O&#x27;Brien and Richard Hartley), while the costumes were designed by Sue Blane. Its 1974 debut in the US in Los Angeles had a successful nine-month run, but its 1975 Broadway debut at the Belasco Theatre lasted only three previews and forty-five showings, despite earning one Tony nomination and three Drama Desk nominations. Various international productions have since spanned across six continents as well as West End and Broadway revivals and eight UK tours. In 1991 it was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Musical Revival. Actor Tim Curry, who originated the role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter in the original London production, became particularly associated with the musical.

The musical was adapted into the 1975 film &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;, starring O&#x27;Brien as Riff Raff, with Curry also reprising his role; the film has the longest-running release in film history. In 2016, it was adapted into the television film &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let&#x27;s Do the Time Warp Again&quot;. The musical was ranked eighth in a BBC Radio 2 listener poll of the &quot;Nation&#x27;s Number One Essential Musicals&quot;, and it was one of eight British musicals featured on a commemorative stamp issued by the Royal Mail in 2011.

Beyond its cult status, &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; is also widely said to have been an influence on countercultural and sexual liberation movements that followed on from the 1960s. It was one of the first popular musicals to depict fluid sexuality during a time of division between generations and a lack of sexual difference acceptance. Like the film adaptation, the musical is noted for a long-running tradition of audience participation through call-back lines and attending dressed up as characters from the show. On the 50th anniversary of the musical in 2023, BBC News states that since debuting in London in 1973 the &quot;production has been performed in 20 different languages&quot; and been &quot;seen by 30 million people globally&quot;.

==History==

As an out-of-work actor in London in the early 1970s, Richard O&#x27;Brien wrote &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; to keep himself busy on winter evenings. Since his youth, he had developed a passion for science fiction and B horror movies; he wanted to combine elements of the unintentional humour of B horror movies, portentous dialogue of schlock-horror, Steve Reeves muscle films, and fifties rock and roll into &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;. A major theme running throughout the musical is transvestism, which according to O&#x27;Brien was not originally meant to be as prominent as it ended up being. He conceived and wrote the play set against the backdrop of the glam era that had manifested itself throughout British popular culture in the early 1970s; he has stated &quot;glam rock allowed me to be myself more&quot;, allowing his concept to come into being.

O&#x27;Brien took a small amount of his unfinished &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; to Australian director Jim Sharman, who decided he wanted to direct it at the small experimental space Upstairs at the Royal Court Theatre in Sloane Square, Chelsea, London, which was used as a project space for new work. Sharman had received considerable local acclaim as the director of the original Australian productions of &quot;Hair&quot; and &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. He went to London to direct the first British stage production of &quot;Superstar&quot;, during which he met O&#x27;Brien, who had played King Herod for just one performance. Sharman brought fellow Australians Nell Campbell and long-time scenic designer partner Brian Thomson into the production.

Star Tim Curry recalled his first encounter with the script:
The original creative team was then rounded out by costume designer Sue Blane and musical director Richard Hartley, although Pete Moss would later take over as musical director. Michael White was also brought in to produce &quot;Rocky Horror&quot;. As the musical went into rehearsal, the working title for it became &quot;They Came from Denton High&quot;, but it was changed just before previews at the suggestion of Sharman to &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;.

After two previews, the show was premiered—without an interval—at the Royal Court&#x27;s 63-seat Theatre Upstairs on 19 June 1973, and ran until 20 July 1973. The cast included Tim Curry, who had decided that Dr Frank-N-Furter should not just be a queen, he should speak like the Queen of the United Kingdom, extravagantly posh, Patricia Quinn, Nell Campbell (billed as Little Nell), Julie Covington, Christopher Malcolm (who would subsequently be the originator of the revival and tours in the 1990s) and O&#x27;Brien, with each performing in an all-out camp style. It was a creative triumph and a critical and commercial success. A reviewer at the premiere for &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote &quot;it achieves the rare feat of being witty and erotic at the same time&quot;, and Curry gives a &quot;garishly Bowiesque performance as the ambisextrous doctor.&quot; Record producer Jonathan King saw it on the second night and signed the cast to make the original cast recording over a long weekend—&quot;The Rocky Horror Show Original London Cast&quot;—that was rushed out on his UK Records label. King was involved heavily in the initial promotion for the show, as well as being the minority backer of it financially with White having a majority share.

The impact at the Royal Court Upstairs allowed the production be transferred to the 230-seat Chelsea Classic Cinema nearby on Kings Road from 14 August 1973 to 20 October 1973. &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; found a quasi-permanent home at the 500-seat King&#x27;s Road Theatre—another cinema house, even further down Kings Road—from 3 November 1973. The show received praise from London theatre critics and won the 1973 &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Award for Best Musical. When Richard O&#x27;Brien played Riff Raff in the original Broadway production of &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; in 1975 Robert Longden took over the role in London.

The show&#x27;s run at the King&#x27;s Road Theatre ended on 31 March 1979; it then transferred to the Comedy Theatre (now the Harold Pinter Theatre) in the West End to begin performances on 6 April 1979. At the new venue, &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; required some restaging, for the Comedy was the first theatre at which the musical had played that possessed a traditional proscenium arch stage. For the first time, the musical was also broken into two acts with an interval. It finished its run there on 13 September 1980 in what was its 2,960th performance in London.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
The Usherette, sometimes referred to as &quot;Trixie&quot;, who works in a derelict cinema, introduces tonight&#x27;s &quot;film&quot; in a song (&quot;Science Fiction/Double Feature&quot;), with masked Phantoms providing the backing vocals.

After attending the wedding of his best friend since high school (Ralph Hapschatt, now married to Janet Weiss&#x27; friend Betty Munroe), Brad Majors confesses his love to Janet Weiss (&quot;Dammit Janet&quot;) and the two become engaged. The Narrator appears and explains that Brad and Janet are leaving Denton to visit Dr. Everett Scott, their former science tutor, while driving into a rainstorm. During the trip, their car has a flat tyre and they are forced to walk through the rain to seek a telephone in an old castle (&quot;Over at the Frankenstein Place&quot;).

The Narrator explains that Brad and Janet are feeling &quot;apprehensive and uneasy&quot;, but must accept any help that they are offered. As Brad and Janet arrive, Riff Raff, the hunchbacked handyman and live-in butler, greets them, and his sister Magenta, the maid, appears. Riff Raff, Magenta and Columbia (a groupie) speak briefly of an unlucky delivery boy named Eddie who fell victim to unfortunate circumstances because he botched a delivery, before performing the show&#x27;s signature dance number (&quot;Time Warp&quot;). Brad and Janet try to leave at this point, but are stopped when Dr Frank-N-Furter, a pansexual, cross-dressing mad scientist, arrives. He introduces himself as &quot;a sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania&quot; and invites Brad and Janet up to his laboratory (&quot;Sweet Transvestite&quot;). As he goes up, Brad and Janet are stripped to their underwear to dry off.

Brad and Janet enter the laboratory, where Frank-N-Furter gives them laboratory coats to wear. Frank announces that he has discovered the secret to life itself. He unveils his creation, a blond, well-built man named Rocky, who is brought to life. As his bandages are removed, Rocky worries about his predicament (&quot;The Sword of Damocles&quot;). Frank admires Rocky&#x27;s physique by singing a tribute to muscle builders (&quot;Charles Atlas Song&quot;/&quot;I Can Make You a Man&quot;). A Coca-Cola freezer in the laboratory opens to reveal Frank and Columbia&#x27;s former lover, Eddie, a biker covered in surgical scars, who has been rendered a (slightly more) brain-damaged zombie, intent on rescuing Columbia, and escaping the castle while successfully causing large amounts of damage to Frank&#x27;s laboratory, exhibiting signs of partially returning memory of the way he lived life in the past (&quot;Hot Patootie – Bless My Soul&quot;). Frank panics, forces Eddie back into the freezer and hacks him to death (his weapon of choice typically being a pick axe or chainsaw). Frank tells Rocky — the recipient of the other half of Eddie&#x27;s brain — that he prefers him over Eddie (&quot;Charles Atlas Song (Reprise)&quot;/&quot;I Can Make You a Man (Reprise)&quot;), as although he and Eddie had a strong mental relationship, he had no muscle, and therefore, had to go. Brad and Janet, somewhat flustered after witnessing the re-murdering of Eddie, are then ushered to separate bedrooms for the night.

===Act II===
The Narrator foreshadows that Brad and Janet may be unsafe. Janet enjoys Brad&#x27;s advances in her darkened bedroom before realising that it is Frank in disguise. He convinces Janet that pleasure is no crime, and after she asks him to promise not to tell Brad, they resume their lovemaking. The scene changes to Brad&#x27;s darkened bedroom, where Brad makes love to Janet before discovering that, once again, it is Frank in disguise. Frank promises not to tell Janet, but as they resume, Riff Raff interrupts on the television monitor with the message that Rocky has escaped. Janet searches for Brad in the laboratory and discovers Rocky hiding there. Checking the television monitor, Janet sees Brad in bed with Frank and seduces Rocky (&quot;Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me&quot;). While searching the television monitor for Rocky, the rest of the group discovers that Janet has slept with him and Brad becomes hurt and angry (&quot;Once in a While&quot;). Riff Raff then notifies Frank that there is another visitor entering the castle: Dr. Everett Scott, the paraplegic science tutor whom Brad and Janet intended to visit.

Dr. Scott in a wheelchair is wheeled into the laboratory by Columbia, where Frank accuses him and Brad of trying to investigate his castle, knowing that Dr. Scott has connections with the FBI. Dr Scott assures him that he has come in search of Eddie, who is revealed to be his nephew (&quot;Eddie&#x27;s Teddy&quot;). Frank displays Eddie&#x27;s corpse to the group and then uses a device to electronically restrain the three visitors and a rebellious Rocky to the floor (&quot;Planet Schmanet Janet&quot;); the inhabitants of the castle are revealed to be space aliens led by Frank, who abandoned their original mission in order to engage in kinky sex with Earthlings and work on Rocky. Magenta insists that they return to their home planet now that they have been found out; Frank refuses and, instead, declares his intentions to put on a &quot;floor show&quot;.

Under Frank&#x27;s influence, Columbia, Rocky, Brad, and Janet perform song and dance routines while clad in lingerie (&quot;Rose Tint My World (Floor Show)&quot;). After, Frank entices them to lose all inhibition and give in to their natural carnal instincts, resulting in everyone beginning to engage in orgiastic sex (&quot;Don&#x27;t Dream It – Be It&quot;) before Frank leads them into the rousing concluding number of the floor show (&quot;Wild and Untamed Thing&quot;). The show comes to an abrupt end when Riff Raff and Magenta enter, wearing spacesuits and carrying ray guns. Riff Raff declares that he is usurping Frank&#x27;s authority and taking them all back to their home planet (&quot;Transit Beam&quot;). Frank makes a final plea for sympathy from Riff Raff, trying to make him understand his desire to spend the rest of his life having sex with Earthlings (&quot;I&#x27;m Going Home&quot;). Riff Raff is unmoved and guns down Columbia, Frank, and Rocky before ordering Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott to leave.

As the trio evacuates the castle, Riff Raff and Magenta express their excitement to return to their world and do the &quot;Time Warp&quot; again with their fellow Transylvanians (&quot;Spaceship&quot;). Brad and Janet watch as the castle blasts off into outer space, confused about the implications of their sexual escapades (&quot;Super Heroes&quot;). To conclude his tale, the Narrator says &quot;and crawling on the planet&#x27;s face, insects called the human race, lost in time, and lost in space – and meaning.&quot; As the show ends, The Usherette returns to recount the night&#x27;s events (&quot;Science Fiction/Double Feature (Reprise)&quot;).

*In the original London and Los Angeles productions, &quot;Sweet Transvestite&quot; came before &quot;Time Warp&quot;. This was changed for the film version and was subsequently updated for the stage version when O&#x27;Brien revised the script for the 1990 West End revival.
*&quot;Charles Atlas Song&quot; was replaced by a reworked version of the song, &quot;I Can Make You a Man&quot;, for the film version. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s revision of the script in 1990 featured a hybrid of the two songs under the title &quot;I Can Make You a Man&quot;, in the 1999 revised script this song was replaced by the film version, which continues to be used in all major productions. The reprise remains unchanged except for the title.

==Other productions==
===Original Los Angeles production (American premiere)===
Lou Adler had made millions with risky ventures such as Monterey Pop. His record label, Ode Records, was becoming known for harvesting experimental talent. In the late winter of 1973, Adler was in London and attended a performance of the show with Britt Ekland. Acting on impulse and seeing a hit, he met backstage with producers and within 36 hours had secured the American theatrical rights.

The show premiered at the Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles on 24 March 1974, running for nine months. The cast was all new except for Tim Curry. The rest of the cast consisted of Abigail Haness as Janet, Bill Miller as Brad, Bruce Scott as Riff-Raff, Jamie Donnelly as Magenta/Trixie, Boni Enten as Columbia, Meat Loaf as Eddie/Dr. Scott, Kim Milford as Rocky Horror, and Graham Jarvis as the Narrator. Paul Jabara played Dr. Frank-N-Furter when Curry left to film the movie.

The show played to a full house and a deal was made with 20th Century Fox for a film. Fox executive Gordon Stulberg saw the show at the Roxy and agreed to invest $1 million in the film project. Adler&#x27;s attempt to turn his club into a playhouse was successful. Meat Loaf remembered different celebrities who would come to the show, resulting in him meeting Elvis Presley at a performance.

===Original Sydney production (Australian premiere)===
Harry M. Miller produced the original Sydney production of Rocky Horror, which opened on 19 April 1974 at the New Arts Cinema (formerly The Astor, later The Valhalla and now an office building) in Glebe. It starred Reg Livermore as Frank-N-Furter, Jane Harders as Janet Weiss, Kate Fitzpatrick as Usherette and Magenta, Arthur Dignam as Narrator, Sal Sharah as Riff-Raff, John Paramor as Brad Majors, Graham Matters as Rocky, Maureen Elkner as Columbia, David Cameron as Eddie and Dr. Scott with Bob Hudson and Piero Von Arnam and Julie McGregor.

===Original Melbourne/Adelaide production===
After eighteen-month run in Sydney, Harry M. Miller&#x27;s production moved to Melbourne, with Max Phipps taking over the star role. It opened at the Regent Palace Theatre on 24 October 1975 and ran through 19 months and 458 performances, finally closing on 28 May 1977.

The Melbourne production included Max Phipps - Frank-N-Furter; Gregory Apps - Brad (later Stephen Clark); Paula Maxwell - Janet (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Diana Greentree); Tommy Dysart - narrator; Sal Sharah - Riff-Raff; Robyn Moase - Magenta (later Joan Brockenshire); Sue Smithers - Columbia (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Joan Millar); Graham Matters - Rocky (later Grant Whiteman, Clive Blackie); Terry Bader - Eddie/Dr Scott (later David Cameron, William Gluth). When Paula Maxwell left, resident stage director, Roland Rocchiccioli, moved Kear (at her request) into the role of Janet, and Joan Miller, who was an understudy, took over from Kear as Columbia. 
It was in Melbourne, during the Sword of Damocles number, that Grant Whiteman fell while swinging on ladder and being pursued by Max Phipps. Fortunately, there was a Doctor in the house. Without missing a beat, Rocchiccioli told Clive Blackie to get into the costume: &quot;This is your big chance. You&#x27;re on!&quot; he said. The show picked up from where Whiteman had fallen and went-on without further hitch. Soon after that Whiteman left, and, to Blackie&#x27;s surprise, Rocchiccioli put him into the role - without hesitation. He said to him: &quot;You&#x27;re the understudy. Of course you take over. That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re here for!&quot; He proved a very popular Rocky. What he lacked in height he made-up for in muscle. 
The show then transferred to Adelaide, where it opened on 12 August 1977 at The Warner Theatre. Max Phipps, Diana Greentree, Joan Millar, Tommy Dysart and Joan Brockenshire went on to reprise their roles from the Melbourne production. Staged by Roland Rocchiccioli, the Adelaide production – which was a transfer of Jim Sharman&#x27;s original Sydney and Melbourne productions, and adapted for the new theatre, was not a success, and closed after only two months. As Rocchiccioli said on ABC Television in Adelaide, talking with Clive Hale: &quot;It is the same Jim Sharman production as Melbourne. It is Brian Thomson&#x27;s design, except the set has been altered slightly because this is not a television theatre in the last days of its existence!&quot; Rocchiccioli later said he was astonished that it did not work in Adelaide after playing in Melbourne for the two years previous. Some weeks the company did ten performances, so great was the demand for tickets. It would have gone on running - possibly for another year - if Max Phipps had not decided to leave. He was exhausted. In the final months Harry M. Miller was selling standing-room at the back of the theatre for up to 50-patrons per performance.

After several weeks in Adelaide, Jon Finlayson replaced Max Phipps as Frank-N-Furter. Max had come-in to the production at the last moment, after Darrell Hilton and Rocchiccioli agreed on a parting of the ways, just days before the opening night. Other cast members included Tony Preece as Brad; Keith Reid (who was the Melbourne understudy) as Riff-Raff; Bill Binks as Eddie/Dr. Scott; and Shane Bourne as Rocky. The Adelaide reviews were
savage, and killed the production. Everyone was taken by surprise, including Max Phipps, who was brilliant in the role. Rocchiccioli said at the time: &quot;It&#x27;s baffling. Nothing has changed from Melbourne, and it&#x27;s difficult to know why they hate it so much&quot;. It is the only time the Rocky Horror Show has not been critically applauded in Australia. The show closed after two months, after running from 12 August to October 1977.

===Original New York City (Broadway) production===

In early 1975, Adler closed the show at the Roxy Theatre after a ten-month run. This gave actors time to return to the UK for the film version&#x27;s shooting. Adler planned to open on Broadway just before the film&#x27;s release. It was anticipated that this production would be as successful as &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; and serve as a public vehicle for the film version. It was unsuccessful and closed after 45 performances. The cast was identical to that of the Roxy cast but with O&#x27;Brien in place of Scott as Riff-Raff.

===Original San Francisco production===
The third U.S. production opened at the Montgomery Playhouse in San Francisco on 3 February 1976 and played 103 performances, closing on 30 May. The San Francisco production was directed by A. Michael Amarino, with musical direction and arrangements by Michael Reno. The production had a new cast and starred David James as Frank. The opening night cast included Roslyn Roseman as Trixie/Usherette/Magenta, Needa Greene as Janet, Robert Reynolds as Brad, Richard Gee as the Narrator, Buddy King as Riff Raff, Paula Desmond as Columbia, Bob Dulaney as Rocky, and Emil Borelli as Eddie/Dr Scott, with back-up vocals by Vikki D&#x27;Orazi, William J. Tacke, and Kelly St. John.

===UK productions===
&quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; has toured the United Kingdom regularly since the 1990–91 West End revival at the Piccadilly Theatre in productions produced by Christopher Malcolm&#x27;s, Richard O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s and Howard Panter&#x27;s &quot;Rocky Horror Company&quot;. Notable celebrities have been cast including Daniel Abineri, Peter Blake, Tim McInnerny, Anthony Head, Robin Cousins, Jason Donovan and Jonathan Wilkes as Frank-N-Furter, Gina Bellman as Janet Weiss, Edward Tudor-Pole as Riff Raff and TV&#x27;s Craig Ferguson and Adrian Edmondson as Brad Majors, Kate O’Sullivan as Magenta/Usherette.

Throughout the 90&#x27;s and into the 00&#x27;s it evolved and emerged as the behemoth touring show that it is thanks to the dedication of Christopher Malcolm who also directed several productions in the UK, Germany, South Africa and Buenos Aires amongst others.

Richard O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Rocky Horror Show completed its 2006–2007 tour on 14 July 2007 in Woking, Surrey after touring for almost eighteen months. The tour was directed by Christopher Luscombe and featured David Bedella as Frank. The 2006 tour cast, accompanied by Roger Lloyd-Pack as the Narrator and author O&#x27;Brien, performed &quot;The Time Warp&quot; live in Trafalgar Square on 22 July 2006 as part of &quot;The Big Dance&quot; event and was broadcast on BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot;. In 2008 David Bedella released his first album &quot;The Dean St. Sessions&quot;, produced by Nathan Amzi, which included a duet with O&#x27;Brien singing &quot;I&#x27;m Going Home&quot; as a bonus video.

In March 2009, the show returned with a new UK tour starting in the autumn. With Christopher Luscombe returning as the director, the tour was a revival of the 2006–2007 production with some adjustments to the direction, lighting, choreography, costumes and musical arrangements. The tour opened on 17 September 2009 at the New Wimbledon Theatre and closed on 4 December 2010 at the newly opened Aylesbury Waterside Theatre.

The first leg of the tour ran from September 2009 to July 2010 with a short break over the Christmas period. David Bedella reprised his role as Frank. The second leg of the tour began on 1 September 2010 at the New Victoria Theatre, Woking with several changes to the cast. During the UK tour&#x27;s summer break director Christopher Luscombe and the show&#x27;s creative team recreated the UK production in Seoul, South Korea with a new cast of American, Australian and New Zealander actors and local celebrities as the Narrator. The production played from August until October 2010 before a five-week New Zealand tour in November and December with Richard O&#x27;Brien making a rare appearance as the Narrator.

====2006 Charity concert====
On 3 May 2006, a benefit concert version of the musical to raise money for Amnesty International. Entitled &quot;The Rocky Horror Tribute Show&quot;, it was staged at the Royal Court Theatre (where the show had its world premiere in 1973) as a one night only event hosted by Richard O&#x27;Brien. The cast featured Anthony Head and Michael Ball sharing the role of Frank-N-Furter, Ade Edmondson and Stephen Gately sharing the role of Brad, Joanne Farrell and Sophie Lawrence sharing the role of Janet, Kraig Thornber as Riff Raff, Toyah Willcox as Magenta, Amy Rosefield as Columbia, Gary Amers as Rocky Horror, Ben Richards as Eddie, Julian Littman as Dr. Scott, and original cast member Patricia Quinn as The Usherette. Christopher Biggins, Rayner Bourton, Robin Cousins, Steve Pemberton, Tony Slattery, Jamie Theakston and O&#x27;Brien served as the show&#x27;s narrators, introducing each musical number. The concert also featured guest appearances from the original Columbia Nell Campbell, and Kimi Wong, O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s first wife and cast member from the 1975 film adaptation of the musical.

The concert was later released on DVD by Kultur International Films in October 2008.

====2012–13 UK tour====
In December 2012, a new production of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; began a year-long UK tour to celebrate the show&#x27;s 40th anniversary.

Christopher Luscombe has returned to direct the production, which stars Oliver Thornton as Frank-N-Furter, Ben Forster (winner of ITV1 series &quot;Superstar&quot;) as Brad Majors until February 2013, Roxanne Pallett (of &quot;Emmerdale&quot;) as Janet Weiss until May 2013 and Rhydian Roberts (of &quot;The X Factor&quot;) as Rocky until March 2013. Unlike recent productions, the tour will not feature interchanging guest Narrators with Philip Franks taking on the role.

The show also features Kristian Lavercombe returning to the role of Riff Raff, Abigail Jaye as Magenta/Usherette, Ceris Hine reprising the role of Columbia, Joel Montague as Eddie/Dr Scott, and Maria Coyne, Christos Dante, David Gale, and Rachel Grundy as the Phantoms, with Andrew Ahern as the swing.

====Live broadcast/2015–16 UK tour====

In 2015, the tour was staged at the London Playhouse Theatre and also broadcast in many cinemas across Europe, as well as on the BBC in October 2015, with Richard O&#x27;Brien taking the role as Narrator for the London dates only. On opening night, he received seven standing ovations when appearing on-stage. Tickets for the first week sold out in 72 hours so a second week was added. A charity gala night on 17 September at the Playhouse featured actors Stephen Fry, Anthony Head, Mel Giedroyc, Adrian Edmondson and former Spice Girl Emma Bunton sharing the role of Narrator. A UK-wide tour followed the London production.

===Australian productions===
====Riverina Trucking Company Production====
In 1978, &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; received its first regional production of Australia. Under the direction of Terry O&#x27;Connell and Les Winspear, the production was staged by the Riverina Trucking Company (RTC) in the city of Wagga Wagga, where it played for a three-week run.

In 1981, director Peter Barclay&#x27;s new interpretation of RTC production, marked by a fusion of directorial integrity and razzle-dazzle of colour and movement, opened on 22 July 1981 at Civic Theatre, Wagga Wagga. The cast included Terry O&#x27;Connell as Frank-N-Furter (reprising his role from the 1978 production), Annie Stanford as Janet, Paul Minifie as The Narrator, Bob Baines (another former member of the 1978 production) as Riff Raff, and Wayne Pygram as Rocky Horror.

The Sydney revival show toured successfully to Melbourne, Rockhampton, Townsville, Mount Isa, Canberra, Newcastle, Hobart, Launceston, Perth, Adelaide, and closed in Brisbane in October 1982.

David Toguri (who had previously done the choreography for the 1975 film adaptation of the musical) directed and choreographed the revival show. The cast featured Daniel Abineri as Frank-N-Furter, who had previously played the role in the first UK tour in 1979 and for a year in London&#x27;s West End Comedy Theatre in 1980, Antoinette Byron as Janet Weiss, David Frezza as Brad Majors, Perry Bedden (a cast member of the original 1975 film) as Riff Raff, Kerry Myers as Magenta/Usherette, Gina Mendoza as Columbia, Steve J.

During the tour, the role of The Narrator was shared between three different actors: Stuart Wagstaff, Ian &quot;Molly&quot; Meldrum (for 3 weeks in February during the Melbourne season) and Noel Ferrier (during the Adelaide season).

====1984 Tour====
In 1984 Wilton Morley revived the show to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the original Australian production and also marks Daniel Abineri&#x27;s second Australian outing as Frank-N-Further and his directorial debut. Although Abineri did play the role for the majority of the run, at the beginning of the tour Garry Scale took the lead. Later, at the Rialto Theatre in Brisbane, set designer Geoff Bieleseld used different stage levels to give the impression of space, which was an adaptation based on original designs by Brian Thomson. In Brisbane and Sydney Reg Livermore, the show&#x27;s original Frank-N-Furter, was cast in the same role.

The cast featured Anne Looby as Janet Weiss, David Garrett as Brad Majors (later Graeme McKeachie during the Brisbane/Sydney seasons), David Wheeler as Riff Raff, Suzanne Dudley as Magenta/Usherette (later Nataly Mosco during the Brisbane/Sydney seasons), Jill Watt as Columbia (later Cassandra Webb, Gina Mendoza), Wayne Pygram as Eddie/Dr. Scott, Ray Coughlin as Rocky Horror, and Stuart Wagstaff as Narrator (early in the tour David Clendinning).

====1985 Rural Tour====
Peter Batey directed the new all-star revival-production, which starred Joe Daniels in the central role of Frank-N-Furter. The show was mounted for limited engagements from August till November 1985 in Townsville, Cairns, Mount Isa, Mackay, Gladstone, Rockhampton, Tweed Heads, Newcastle, Burnie, Launceston, Hobart, Canberra, Wagga Wagga, Albury, Wangaratta, Shepparton, Warragul, and Ballarat.

====1986–1988 Australasia Tour====
Morley&#x27;s production was re-launched yet again in 1986, with Daniel Abineri both as director and in the lead role of Frank-N-Furter. This time the tour commenced in New Zealand, where its cast included local actors Andrew Binns as Brad, Ann Wilson as Janet, Andrea Cunningham as Magenta/Usherette, Rachel King as Columbia and Russell Crowe as Eddie/Dr. Scott. For a brief stint, former New Zealand Prime Minister Robert Muldoon appeared as the Narrator.

The following year, the production transferred to the Princess Theatre (and later the Comedy Theatre) in Melbourne, Australia for an eight-month run, and toured Australia for several years visiting Sydney, Perth, Tweed Heads, Brisbane (where it was staged as part of the World Expo 88), Parramatta, Newcastle and Canberra.

The cast featured Daniel Abineri as Frank-N-Furter, Megan Shapcott as Janet Weiss, Simon Westaway as Brad Majors, David Wheeler as Riff Raff, Lyn Shakespeare as Magenta/Usherette, Michelle Argue as Columbia (later Gina Mendoza), Steve Bastoni as Rocky Horror, and The Narrator variously was played by Gordon Chater, Stuart Wagstaff and others.

By the time the tour reached Brisbane, Daniel Abineri had retired as director and star and – based on Abineri&#x27;s original production, Wilton Morley took over duties, with Simon Westaway (who had played previously Brad in the Australian tour) as Frank-N-Furter. Other cast changes included: Ann Wilson and Andrew Binns as Janet and Brad (reprising their roles from the New Zealand tour), Bob Baines (and later Greg Parke) as Riff Raff, Luz Yeomans as Magenta/Usherette, Walter Grkovic as Eddie /Dr. Scott, Anthony Russell as Rocky Horror, and Bernard King as Narrator.

The production ended with a second New Zealand tour, which was directed by Terry O&#x27;Connell (late of the Riverina Trucking Company productions) with Simon Westaway as Frank-N-Furter. The rest of the cast mainly comprised New Zealand talent, including actor/director John Banas and comedian Billy T. James alternating as the Narrator. The tour visited Wellington, Auckland, Palmerston North, Christchurch, Dunedin and officially came to an end in December 1988.

It has been noted for being the last production based on the original show&#x27;s script and set design, before readaptation for the 1990 UK West End revival.

====German productions====
In 1980, two different interpretations of the musical were staged in Germany.

In 1980 director Walter Bockmayer, released The Rocky Horror Show in Essen as a German premiere, which opened on 20 January 1980 at the Grillo-Theater. This production deviated greatly from the original London productions in regards to characterisation, costuming and set design. Instead of the morbid castle Bockmayer&#x27;s extravagant design set his lustful Transylvanians in a sterile hospital on time travel.

Frank-N-Furter was played by the American guest star Decoven C. Washington, who thus became the first black man to embody the main antagonist. The cast also featured Rotraut Rieger as Janet Weiss, Detlev Greisner as Brad Majors, Fritz Brieserheister as Riff-Raff, Jutta Bryde as Magenta, Sue Hürzeler as Columbia, Yoyo Petit as Eddie, Manfried Hilbig as Dr. Scott, Till Krabbe as Rocky Horror, Siegfried Wittig as Narrator, and Helmut Fülberth as Usherette.

The second was a production imported from England by producer Cameron Mackintosh, which ran briefly in October/November. The show was supposed to have an extensive run, but a lack of co-operation from the German producers saw Mackintosh pull the show after only a few weeks. Mackintosh&#x27;s production primarily featured a cast of English actors, which included Jeff Shankley as Frank-N-Furter, Philip Bretherton as Brad, Perry Bedden (a cast member from the film adaptation of &quot;Rocky Horror&quot;) as Riff-Raff, Trevor Byfield as Eddie/Dr. Scott, and Nicholas Courtney as The Narrator.

====Norwegian production====
The musical premiered on 11 October 1977 at the Oslo Nye Centralteatret in Oslo, Norway, boasting a cast of both established actors and popular names from the music industry. The production was directed by David Toguri (with assistance from Brian Thomson), while Richard O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s original script was translated into Norwegian by actor Johan Fillinger and musician Ole Paus. The show generated heated controversy in the press, with newspapers and commentators declaring that the show signified the decline of morality in the country. But despite the press&#x27; hostility, the show performed a total of 129 times, before officially closing 18 March 1978.

====Spanish productions====
The first Spanish staging of the musical was performed in Madrid, Spain from September 1974 to July 1975, which was presented as &quot;a sexual satirical musical&quot; directed by Gil Carretero. The libretto was translated and adapted by Juan José Plans and Roberto Estevez, who toned down the original script&#x27;s profanity an approach in response to censorship during the Franco regime.

The show opened Cerebro Music Hall, playing every weeknight as an adults-only event at 11:00 pm to standing room only. Saturday nights would also include a second show that played at 1:00 am. The show received considerable media attention, due to its boundary-pushing themes being considered as a personal attack towards the Franco Regime that was ruling the country at that time.

After completing its run at the La Discoteca Cerebro, the show reopened at the Teatro Valle-Inclán, where it played from August to October 1975.

In 1977, a Catalan-language version of the musical directed by Ventura Pons and produced by Jordi Morell, with the slogan &quot;L&#x27;espectacle més desmadrat del segle&quot; &quot;(The most riotous show of the century),&quot; premiered on 4 March 1977 at Teatro Romea in Barcelona. The libretto was translated by Narcissus Comadira, who, like the translators of the Madrid production, changed the names of the three leads, Frank-N-Further, Janet Weiss and Brad Majors. The characters were renamed Dr. Frank Esteve, Anna Prou Grossa and Ramon Poch.

Following the event, many Facebook users have expressed outrage at Botelho&#x27;s claims. In his defense, the director said that the comments were nothing more than a joke and that they were taken out of context. According to him, it was just a discussion about the casting of actress Laverne Cox for the then-upcoming television film.

UK Tour actors Richard Meek and Haley Flaherty reprised their roles as Brad and Janet for the final week of the New Zealand run, flying out days after the end of the UK production in December 2010.

==Legacy==

Beyond its cult status, &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; is also widely hailed, alongside other experimental theatre works such as &quot;Hair&quot;, to have been an influence on the countercultural and sexual liberation movements that followed on from the 1960s. It was one of the first popular musicals to depict fluid sexuality during a time of division between generations and a lack of sexual difference acceptance.

As a result, the show received &quot;a mauling from New York-based critic Rex Reed, who said the production &#x27;was only for homosexuals&#x27;&quot;. However, O&#x27;Brien stated that it is rather a celebration of difference that allows marginalized communities to gather and coexist. Unlike Reed, other critics would suggest that &quot;though many people might laugh at the notion, Rocky Horror is in many ways a serious musical and a serious social document&quot;.

The musical was ranked eighth in a BBC Radio 2 listener poll of the &quot;Nation&#x27;s Number One Essential Musicals&quot;. &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; was one of eight UK musicals featured on Royal Mail stamps, issued in February 2011. In January 2023, it was announced that there would be an NFT collection to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the stage show&#x27;s first appearance.

<text>Reprography (a portmanteau of &quot;reproduction&quot; and &quot;photography&quot;) is the reproduction of graphics through mechanical or electrical means, such as photography or xerography. Reprography is commonly used in catalogs and archives, as well as in the architectural, engineering, and construction industries.

==Overview==
In the United States, the industry is a relatively small industry, with approximately 3000 firms. It comprises entrepreneurial businesses serving predominantly the large- and wide-format reproduction needs of the legal, architectural, engineering, manufacturing, retail, and advertising industries. Average sales volume is about $1.5 million and average employee counts are 20–25 people.

Large-format reproductions are produced with a variety of technologies dependent, in part, on the application of the final product and quantity needed. Examples of typical reproduction methods include: diazo (blueline), electrostatic (xerographic), photographic, laser, and ink jet.

Reproductions can be made from the same size or smaller/larger hard copy originals. Prints can also be computer generated from CADD (computer aided design and drafting) files or from a growing variety of desktop publishing and design software packages.

In addition to addressing the large-format reproduction needs of their customers, reprographers frequently sell reprographic equipment and consumable supplies. Other business services such as mounting and lamination, quick copying, microfilming, scanning and facility management may also be provided.

Typical items produced by reprographers include architectural/engineering blueprints and renderings, indoor and outdoor signage, maps, billboards, backlit displays, trade show graphics, legal and medical exhibits, etc. 
Most of the reprographics firms in the United States belong to the International Reprographics Association (IRgA).

Reprographics is also referred to as &quot;reproprinting&quot;.

<doc id="157333" wikidata="Q1930397" url="?curid=157333" title="USS Shenandoah (ZR-1)">
<text>USS &quot;Shenandoah&quot; was the first of four United States Navy rigid airships. It was constructed during 1922–1923 at Lakehurst Naval Air Station, and first flew in September 1923. It developed the U.S. Navy&#x27;s experience with rigid airships and made the first crossing of North America by airship. On the 57th flight, &quot;Shenandoah &quot; was destroyed in a squall line over Ohio in September 1925.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Shenandoah&quot; was originally designated FA-1, for &quot;Fleet Airship Number One&quot; but this was changed to ZR-1. The airship was long and weighed 36 tons (32,658 kg). It had a range of , and could reach speeds of . &quot;Shenandoah&quot; was assembled at Naval Air Station Lakehurst, New Jersey in 1922–1923, in Hangar No. 1, the only hangar large enough to accommodate the ship; its parts were fabricated at the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia. NAS Lakehurst had served as a base for Navy blimps for some time, but &quot;Shenandoah&quot; was the first rigid airship to join the fleet.

The design was based on captured Zeppelin bomber &quot;L-49&quot; (LZ-96), built in 1917. &quot;L-49&quot; was a lightened Type U &quot;height climber&quot;, designed for altitude at the expense of other qualities. The design was found insufficient and a number of the features of newer Zeppelins were used, as well as some structural improvements. The structure was built from a new alloy of aluminum and copper known as duralumin, supplied by Alcoa. Girders were fabricated at the Naval Aircraft Factory. Whether the changes introduced into the original design of &quot;L-49&quot; played a part in &quot;Shenandoah&quot;″s later breakup is a matter of debate. An outer cover of high-quality cotton cloth was sewn, laced or taped to the duralumin frame and painted with aluminum dope.

The gas cells were made of goldbeater&#x27;s skins, one of the most gas-impervious materials known at the time. Named for their use in beating and separating gold leaf, goldbeater&#x27;s skins were made from the outer membrane of the large intestines of cattle. The membranes were washed and scraped to remove fat and dirt, and then placed in a solution of water and glycerine in preparation for application to the rubberized cotton fabric providing the strength of the gas cells. The membranes were wrung out by hand to remove the water-glycerine storage solution and then rubber-cemented to the cotton fabric and finally given a light coat of varnish. The 20 gas cells within the airframe were filled to about 85% of capacity at normal barometric pressure. Each gas cell had a spring-loaded relief valve and manual valves operated from the control car.

===Pioneer of helium-filled rigids===
As the first rigid airship to use helium rather than hydrogen, &quot;Shenandoah&quot; had a significant edge in safety over previous airships. Helium was relatively scarce at the time, and &quot;Shenandoah&quot; used much of the world&#x27;s reserves just to fill its volume. —the next rigid airship to enter Navy service, originally built by &quot;Luftschiffbau Zeppelin&quot; in Germany as &quot;LZ 126&quot;—was at first filled with the helium from &quot;Shenandoah&quot; until more could be procured.

&quot;Shenandoah&quot; was powered by , eight-cylinder Packard gasoline engines. Six engines were originally installed, but in 1924 one engine (aft of the control car) was removed. The first frame of &quot;Shenandoah&quot; was erected by 24 June 1922; on 20 August 1923, the completed airship was floated free of the ground. Helium cost $55 () per thousand cubic feet at the time, and was considered too expensive to simply vent to the atmosphere to compensate for the weight of fuel consumed by the gasoline engines. Neutral buoyancy was preserved by installing condensers to capture the water vapor in the engine exhaust.

==Service history==

===Early naval service===

&quot;Shenandoah&quot; made her maiden flight on 4 September 1923. The airship was christened on 10 October 1923 by Marion Bartlett Thurber, wife of the Secretary of the Navy, and commissioned on the same day. Mrs. Denby named the airship after her home in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, and the word &quot;shenandoah&quot; was said to be a Native American word meaning &quot;daughter of stars&quot;.

&quot;Shenandoah&quot; was designed for fleet reconnaissance work of the type carried out by German naval airships in World War I. Her pre-commissioning trials included long-range flights during September and early October 1923, to test her airworthiness in rain, fog and poor visibility. On 27 October, &quot;Shenandoah&quot; celebrated Navy Day with a flight down the Shenandoah Valley and returned to Lakehurst that night by way of Washington and Baltimore, where crowds gathered to see the new airship in the beams of searchlights.

At this time, Rear Admiral William A. Moffett, Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics and staunch advocate of the airship, was discussing the possibility of using &quot;Shenandoah&quot; to explore the Arctic. He felt such a program would produce valuable weather data as well as experience in cold-weather operations. With its endurance and ability to fly at low speeds, the airship was thought to be well suited to such work and President Calvin Coolidge approved Moffett&#x27;s proposal. On 16 January 1924, the upper tail fin of the &quot;Shenandoah&quot; was damaged during a high gale while moored to the mast at Lakehurst. The sudden rolling of the airship tore her away from the mast, ripping out her mooring winches, deflating the first helium cell and puncturing the second. The airship was blown across the field and disappeared into the darkness. Zeppelin test pilot and commander Anton Heinen, who was aboard when the incident occurred, rode out the storm for several hours and landed the airship safely the next morning, while being blown backwards. Extensive repairs to the &quot;Shenandoah&quot; took nearly 4 months, and the Arctic expedition was scrapped.

&quot;Shenandoah&quot;″s repairs were completed in May, and in mid-1924 was working up its engines and radio equipment to prepare for fleet duty. In August 1924, the airship joined the Scouting Fleet and took part in tactical exercises. &quot;Shenandoah&quot; succeeded in discovering the &quot;enemy&quot; force as planned but lost contact with it in foul weather. Technical difficulties and lack of support facilities in the fleet forced the ship to depart the operating area ahead of time to return to Lakehurst. Although this marred the exercises as far as airship reconnaissance went, it emphasized the need for advanced bases and maintenance ships if lighter-than-air craft were to take any part in operations of this kind.

===Flight across North America===

In July 1924, the oiler put in at Norfolk Naval Shipyard for extensive modifications to become the Navy&#x27;s first airship tender. An experimental mooring mast above the water was constructed; additional accommodations both for the crew of &quot;Shenandoah&quot; and for the men who would handle and supply the airship were added; facilities for the helium, gasoline, and other supplies necessary for &quot;Shenandoah&quot; were built, as well as handling and stowage facilities for three seaplanes. &quot;Shenandoah&quot; engaged in a short series of mooring experiments with &quot;Patoka&quot; to determine the practicality of mobile fleet support of scouting airships. The first successful mooring was made on 8 August. During October 1924, &quot;Shenandoah&quot; flew from Lakehurst to California and on to Washington state to test newly erected mooring masts. This was the first flight of a rigid airship across North America.

===Later naval career===
1925 began with nearly six months of maintenance and ground test work. &quot;Shenandoah&quot; did not take to the air until 26 June, when it began preparations for summer operations with the fleet. In July and August, it again operated with the Scouting Fleet, successfully performing scouting tasks and being towed by &quot;Patoka&quot; while moored to that ship&#x27;s mast.

==Crash of &quot;Shenandoah&quot;==

On 2 September 1925, &quot;Shenandoah&quot; departed Lakehurst on a promotional flight to the Midwest that would include flyovers of 40 cities and visits to state fairs. Testing of a new mooring mast at Dearborn, Michigan, was included in the schedule. While passing through an area of thunderstorms and turbulence over Ohio early in the morning of 3 September, during its 57th flight, the &quot;Shenandoah&quot; was caught in a violent updraft that carried the ship beyond the pressure limits of its gas bags. The turbulence tore the airship apart, and it crashed in three main pieces near Caldwell, Ohio. Fourteen crew members, including Commander Zachary Lansdowne, were killed. Lansdowne and eight crew members in the control car (except for Lieutenant Anderson, who escaped) died when the car detached and fell from the airship; two men died after falling through holes in the hull; and four mechanics who fell with the engines were killed. There were twenty-nine survivors, who succeeded in riding the three sections of the airship to earth. The largest group was eighteen men who made it out of the stern after it rolled into a valley. Four others survived a crash landing of the central section. The remaining seven were in the bow section which Commander (later Vice Admiral) Charles E. Rosendahl managed to navigate as a free balloon. In this group was Anderson who—until he was roped in by the others—straddled the catwalk over a large hole.

The &quot;Shenandoah&quot; Crash Sites are located in the hillsides of Noble County. Site No. 1, in Buffalo Township, surrounded the Gamary farmhouse, which lay beneath the initial break-up. An early fieldstone and a second, recent granite marker identifies where Commander Lansdowne&#x27;s body was found. Site No. 2 (where the stern came to rest) is southwest of Site No. 1 across Interstate 77 in Noble Township. The rough outline of the stern is marked with a series of concrete blocks, and a sign marking the site is visible from the freeway. Site No. 3 is approximately southwest in Sharon Township at the northern edge of State Route 78 on the part of the old Nichols farm where the nose of &quot;Shenandoah&quot;″s bow was secured to trees. Although the trees have been cut down, a semi-circular gravel drive surrounds their stumps and a small granite marker commemorates the crash. The Nichols house was later destroyed by fire.

Among the survivors was Frederick J. Tobin, who later commanded the Navy landing party for the arrival of the zeppelin &quot;Hindenburg&quot; on May 6, 1937, when the airship exploded into flames, and led rescue operations in response.

==Aftermath==

===Looting===
The crash site attracted thousands of visitors in its first few days. Within five hours of the crash, more than a thousand people had arrived to strip the hulk of anything they could carry. On Saturday, 5 September 1925, the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; of Florida reported the crash site had quickly been looted by locals, describing the frame as being &quot;[laid] carrion to the whims of souvenir seekers&quot;. Among the items believed to have been taken were the vessel&#x27;s logbook and its barograph, both of which were considered critical to understanding how the crash had happened. Also looted were many of the ship&#x27;s 20 deflated silken gas cells, worth several thousand dollars each, most of them unbroken but ripped from the framework before the arrival of armed military personnel. Looting was so extensive it was initially believed that even the bodies of the dead had been stripped of their personal effects. That such looting was happening was denied by those publicly involved in the incident, however. Still, a local farmer on whose property part of the vessel&#x27;s wreckage lay began charging the throngs of visitors $1 (equivalent to about $ in ) for each automobile and 25¢ per pedestrian to enter the crash site, as well as 10¢ for a drink of water.

On 17 September the &quot;Milwaukee Sentinel&quot; reported that 20 Department of Justice operatives had been summoned to the site and that they, along with an unspecified number of federal and state prohibition agents, had visited private homes to collect four truck loads of wreckage along with personal of several crew members and a cap believed to have belonged to Commander Lansdowne. Lansdowne&#x27;s Annapolis class ring had also been thought to have been taken from his hand by looters, but it was found by chance in June 1937 near crash site #1. No one was charged with any crime.

===Inquiry===

The official inquiry brought to light the fact that the fatal flight had been made under protest by Commander Lansdowne (a native of Greenville, Ohio), who had warned the Navy Department of the violent weather conditions that were common to that area of Ohio in late summer. His pleas for a cancellation of the flight only caused a temporary postponement: his superiors were keen to publicize airship technology and justify the huge cost of the airship to the taxpayers. So, as Lansdowne&#x27;s widow consistently maintained at the inquiry, publicity rather than prudence won the day. This event was the trigger for Army Colonel Billy Mitchell to heavily criticize the leadership of both the Army and the Navy, leading directly to his court-martial for insubordination and the end of his military career. Heinen, according to the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, placed the mechanical fault for the disaster on the removal of eight of the craft&#x27;s 18 safety valves, saying that without them he would not have flown on her &quot;for a million dollars&quot;. These valves had been removed in order to better preserve the vessel&#x27;s helium, which at that time was considered a limited global resource of great rarity and strategic military importance; without these valves, the helium contained in the rising gas bags had expanded too quickly for the bags&#x27; valves&#x27; design capacity, causing the bags to tear apart the hull as they ruptured (the helium which had been contained in these bags became lost into the upper atmosphere).

After the disaster, airship hulls were strengthened, control cabins were built into the keels rather than suspended from cables, and engine power was increased. More attention was also paid to weather forecasting.

==Memorials==
Several memorials remain near the crash site. There is another memorial at Moffett Field, California, and a small private museum in Ava, Ohio.

The Noble Local School District—which serves the area where &quot;Shenandoah&quot; crashed—has named its elementary, junior high, and high school after &quot;Shenandoah&quot;. Their sports teams are named &quot;The Zeps,&quot; an abbreviation of &quot;Zeppelin.&quot; A truck stop located about away in Old Washington, Ohio was named Shenandoah Plaza after the airship. The truck stop has since closed and has been torn down.

==In popular culture ==
The crash of the &quot;Shenandoah&quot; was popularized by the songs &quot;The Hand of Fate&quot;, written in 1925 by Eugene Spencer and Don Drew, and &quot;The Wreck of the Shenandoah&quot; which was written by Vernon Dalhart and Carson Robison. The latter song was also issued as a record with Vernon Dalhart performing it. Also, the Shenandoah disaster is referenced in a line of dialogue from the 1930 film &quot;Madam Satan&quot;, the plot of which also concerns a zeppelin crash.

<text>The Tennis Court Oath (, ) was taken on 20 June 1789 by the members of the French Third Estate in a tennis court on the initiative of Jean Joseph Mounier. Their vow &quot;not to separate and to reassemble wherever necessary until the constitution of the kingdom is established&quot; became a pivotal event in the French Revolution.

The Estates-General had been called to address the country&#x27;s fiscal and agricultural crisis, but they had become bogged down in issues of representation immediately after convening in May 1789, particularly whether they would vote by order or by head (which would increase the power of the Third Estate, as it outnumbered the other two estates by a large margin). On 17 June the Third Estate began to call itself the National Assembly, led by Jean Sylvain Bailly and Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, Comte de Mirabeau, who took prominent roles in much of early stages of the Revolution.

On the morning of 20 June the deputies were shocked to discover that the door of the &quot;Salle des Menus-Plaisir&quot; was locked and guarded by soldiers. They immediately feared the worst and were anxious that an attack was imminent from King Louis XVI, so upon the suggestion of one of their members Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, the deputies congregated in a nearby indoor tennis court near the Palace of Versailles. 

The 576 of the 577 members from the Third Estate took the oath. Bailly was the first one who signed; the only person who did not join was Joseph Martin-Dauch, who would only execute decisions that were made by the monarch. To prevent further sessions, the tennis court was rented on 21 or 22 June by the count of Artois, a brother of the king. Meanwhile, the Assembly moved to the Versailles Cathedral.

==Background==


Before the Revolution, French society—aside from royalty—was divided into three estates. The First Estate comprised the clergy; the Second Estate was the nobility. The rest of France—some 97 per cent of the population—was the Third Estate, which ranged from very wealthy city merchants to impoverished rural farmers. The three estates had historically met in the Estates General, a legislative assembly, but this had not happened since 1614, under the reign of Louis XIII. It was the last of the Estates General of the Kingdom of France. Summoned by King Louis XVI, the Estates General of 1789 ended when the Third Estate formed the National Assembly and, against the wishes of the king, invited the other two estates to join. This signaled the outbreak of the French Revolution. 

The Third Estate comprised the overwhelming majority of the French population, but the structure of the Estates-General was such that the Third Estate comprised a bare majority of the delegates. A simple majority was sufficient—as long as delegate votes were cast together. The First and Second Estates preferred to divide the vote; a proposal might need to receive approval from each Estate or there might be two &quot;houses&quot; of the Estates-General (one for the first two Estates, and one for the Third) and a bill would need to be passed by both houses. Either way, the First and Second Estates could exercise a veto over proposals enjoying widespread support among the Third Estate, such as reforms that threatened the privileges of the nobility and clergy.

==Oath==

The deputies&#x27; fears, even if wrong, were reasonable, and the importance of the oath goes above and beyond its context. The oath was a revolutionary act and an assertion that political authority derived from the people and their representatives rather than from the monarchy. Their solidarity forced Louis XVI to order the clergy and the nobility to join the Third Estate in the National Assembly to give the illusion that he controlled the National Assembly. This oath was vital to the Third Estate as a protest that led to more power in the Estates General, every governing body thereafter. Among the oath-takers were five delegates from the colony of Saint-Domingue.

The text was prepared by Antoine Barnave and Isaac Le Chapelier. An English-language translation of the oath reads:

Considering that it has been called to establish the constitution of the realm, to bring about the regeneration of public order, and to maintain the true principles of monarchy; nothing may prevent it from continuing its deliberations in any place it is forced to establish itself; and, finally, the National Assembly exists wherever its members are gathered.

Decrees that all members of this Assembly immediately take a solemn oath never to separate, and to reassemble wherever circumstances require until the constitution of the realm is established and fixed upon solid foundations; and that said oath having been sworn, all members and each one individually confirms this unwavering resolution with his signature.

We swear never to separate ourselves from the National Assembly, and to reassemble wherever circumstances require until the constitution of the realm is drawn up and fixed upon solid foundations.

==Significance and aftermath==

The oath signified for the first time that French citizens formally stood in opposition to Louis XVI. The National Assembly&#x27;s refusal to back down forced the king to make concessions. It was foreshadowed by and drew considerably from the 1776 United States Declaration of Independence, especially the preamble. The oath inspired a wide variety of revolutionary activities in the months afterwards, ranging from rioting in the French countryside to renewed calls for a written constitution. It reinforced the Assembly&#x27;s strength, and although the king attempted to thwart its effect, Louis was forced to relent, and on 27 June 1789 he formally requested that voting occur based on head counts, not on each estates&#x27; power. 

The Tennis Court Oath preceded the Storming of the Bastille in July, the abolition of feudalism in August, and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen on 26 August. The members of the National Constituent Assembly became increasingly divided. The French Constitution of 1791 redefined the organization of the French government, taxation system, male census suffrage and the limits to the powers of government.

Following the 100 year celebration of the oath in 1889, what had been the Royal Tennis Court was again forgotten and deteriorated. Prior to World War II, there was a plan to convert it into a table tennis room for Senate administrators at the Palace. In 1989 the bicentenary of the French Revolution was an opportunity to restore the tennis court.

<text>The Clouds (, &quot;Nephelai&quot;) is a Greek comedy play written by the playwright Aristophanes. A lampooning of intellectual fashions in classical Athens, it was originally produced at the City Dionysia in 423BC and was not as well received as the author had hoped, coming last of the three plays competing at the festival that year. It was revised between 420 and 417BC and was thereafter circulated in manuscript form.

No copy of the original production survives, and scholarly analysis indicates that the revised version is an incomplete form of Old Comedy. This incompleteness, however, is not obvious in translations and modern performances. 

Retrospectively, &quot;The Clouds&quot; can be considered the world&#x27;s first extant &quot;comedy of ideas&quot; and is considered by literary critics to be among the finest examples of the genre. The play also, however, remains notorious for its caricature of Socrates, and is cited by Plato in the &quot;Apology&quot; as a contributing factor to the philosopher&#x27;s trial and execution.

==Plot==
The play begins with Strepsiades suddenly sitting up in bed while his son, Pheidippides, remains blissfully asleep in the bed next to him. Strepsiades complains to the audience that he is too worried about household debts to get any sleep – his wife (the pampered product of an aristocratic clan) has encouraged their son&#x27;s expensive interest in betting on horse races. Strepsiades, having thought up a plan to get out of debt, wakes the youth gently and pleads with him to do something for him. Pheidippides at first agrees to do as he is asked then changes his mind when he learns that his father wants to enroll him in The Thinkery, a school for wastrels and bums with which no self-respecting, athletic young man dares to be associated. Strepsiades explains that students of The Thinkery learn how to turn inferior arguments into winning arguments and this is the only way he can beat their aggrieved creditors in court. Pheidippides however will not be persuaded and Strepsiades decides to enroll himself in The Thinkery in spite of his advanced age.

There he meets a student who tells him about some of the recent discoveries made by Socrates, the head of The Thinkery, including a new unit of measurement for ascertaining the distance jumped by a flea (a flea&#x27;s &quot;foot&quot;, created from a minuscule imprint in wax), the exact cause of the buzzing noise made by a gnat (its rear end resembles a trumpet) and a new use for a large pair of compasses (as a kind of fishing-hook for stealing cloaks from pegs over the gymnasium wall). Impressed, Strepsiades begs to be introduced to the man behind these discoveries. The wish is soon granted; Socrates appears overhead, wafted in a basket at the end of a rope, the better to observe the Sun and other meteorological phenomena. The philosopher descends and quickly begins the induction ceremony for the new elderly student, the highlight of which is a parade of the Clouds, the patron goddesses of thinkers and other layabouts. The Clouds arrive singing majestically of the regions whence they arose and of the land they have now come to visit, loveliest in all being Greece. Introduced to them as a new devotee, Strepsiades begs them to make him the best orator in Greece by a hundred miles. They reply with the promise of a brilliant future. Socrates leads him into the dingy Thinkery for his first lesson and The Clouds step forward to address the audience.

Putting aside their cloud-like costumes, The Chorus declares that this is the author&#x27;s cleverest play and that it cost him the greatest effort. It reproaches the audience for the play&#x27;s failure at the festival, where it was beaten by the works of inferior authors, and it praises the author for originality and for his courage in lampooning influential politicians such as Cleon. The Chorus then resumes its appearance as clouds, promising divine favours if the audience punishes Cleon for corruption and rebuking Athenians for messing about with the calendar, since this has put Athens out of step with the moon.

Socrates returns to the stage in a huff, protesting against the ineptitude of his new elderly student. He summons Strepsiades outside and attempts further lessons, including a form of meditative incubation in which the old man lies under a blanket while thoughts are supposed to arise in his mind naturally. The incubation results in Strepsiades using the blanket to masturbate; finally, Socrates refuses to have anything more to do with him. The Clouds advise Strepsiades to find someone younger to do the learning for him. His son, Pheidippides, subsequently yields to threats by Strepsiades and reluctantly returns with him to the Thinkery, where they encounter the personified arguments Superior (Right) and Inferior (Wrong), associates of Socrates. Superior Argument and Inferior Argument debate with each other over which of them can offer the best education. Superior Argument sides with Justice and the gods, offering to prepare Pheidippides for an earnest life of discipline, typical of men who respect the old ways; Inferior Argument, denying the existence of Justice, offers to prepare him for a life of ease and pleasure, typical of men who know how to talk their way out of trouble. At the end of the debate, a quick survey of the audience reveals that buggers – people schooled by Inferior Arguments – have got into the most powerful positions in Athens. Superior Argument accepts his inevitable defeat, Inferior Argument leads Pheidippides into the Thinkery for a life-changing education and Strepsiades goes home happy. The Clouds step forward to address the audience a second time, demanding to be awarded first place in the festival competition, in return for which they promise good rains – otherwise they will destroy crops, smash roofs, and spoil weddings.

The story resumes with Strepsiades returning to The Thinkery to fetch his son. A new Pheidippides emerges, startlingly transformed into the pale intellectual man that he had once feared to become. Rejoicing in the prospect of talking their way out of financial trouble, Strepsiades leads the youth home for celebrations, just moments before the first of their aggrieved creditors arrives with a witness to summon him to court. Strepsiades comes back on stage, confronts the creditor and dismisses him contemptuously. A second creditor arrives and receives the same treatment before Strepsiades returns indoors to continue the celebrations. The Clouds sing ominously of a looming debacle and Strepsiades again comes back on stage, now in distress, complaining of a beating that his new son has just given him in a dispute over the celebrations. Pheidippides emerges coolly and insolently debates with his father a father&#x27;s right to beat his son and a son&#x27;s right to beat his father. He ends by threatening to beat his mother also, whereupon Strepsiades flies into a rage against The Thinkery, blaming Socrates for his latest troubles. He leads his slaves, armed with torches and mattocks, in a frenzied attack on the disreputable school. The alarmed students are pursued offstage and the Chorus, with nothing to celebrate, quietly departs.

==Historical background==
&quot;The Clouds&quot; represents a departure from the main themes of Aristophanes&#x27; early plays – Athenian politics, the Peloponnesian War and the need for peace with Sparta. The Spartans had recently stopped their annual invasions of Attica after the Athenians had taken Spartan hostages in the Battle of Sphacteria in 425 and this, coupled with a defeat suffered by the Athenians at the Battle of Delium in 424, had provided the right conditions for a truce. Thus the original production of &quot;The Clouds&quot; in 423 BC came at a time when Athens was looking forward to a period of peace. Cleon, the populist leader of the pro-war faction in Athens, was a target in all Aristophanes&#x27; early plays and his attempts to prosecute Aristophanes for slander in 426 had merely added fuel to the fire. Aristophanes however had singled Cleon out for special treatment in his previous play &quot;The Knights&quot; in 424 and there are relatively few references to him in &quot;The Clouds&quot;.

Freed from political and war-time issues, Aristophanes focuses in &quot;The Clouds&quot; on a broader issue that underlies many conflicts depicted in his plays – the issue of Old versus New, or the battle of ideas. The scientific speculations of Ionian thinkers such as Thales in the sixth century were becoming commonplace knowledge in Aristophanes&#x27; time and this had led, for instance, to a growing belief that civilized society was not a gift from the gods but rather had developed gradually from primitive man&#x27;s animal-like existence. Around the time that &quot;The Clouds&quot; was produced, Democritus at Abdera was developing an atomistic theory of the cosmos and Hippocrates at Cos was establishing an empirical and science-like approach to medicine. Anaxagoras, whose works were studied by Socrates, was living in Athens when Aristophanes was a youth. Anaxagoras enjoyed the patronage of influential figures such as Pericles, but oligarchic elements also had political advocates and Anaxagoras was charged with impiety and expelled from Athens around 437 BC.

The battle of ideas had led to some unlikely friendships that cut across personal and class differences, such as between the socially alert Pericles and the unworldly Anaxagoras, and between the handsome aristocrat, Alcibiades, and the ugly plebeian, Socrates. Socrates moreover had distinguished himself from the crowd by his heroism in the retreat from the Battle of Delium and this might have further singled him out for ridicule among his comrades. He was forty-five years old and in good physical shape when &quot;The Clouds&quot; was produced yet he had a face that lent itself easily to caricature by mask-makers, possibly a contributing reason for the frequent characterization of him by comic poets. 
In fact one of the plays that defeated &quot;The Clouds&quot; in 423 was called &quot;Connus&quot;, written by Ameipsias, and it too lampooned Socrates. 
There is a famous story, as reported for example by Aelian, according to which Socrates cheerfully rose from his seat during the performance of &quot;The Clouds&quot; and stood in silent answer to the whispers among foreigners in the festival audience: &quot;Who is &quot;Socrates&quot;?&quot;

==Portrayal of Socrates==
Plato appears to have considered &quot;The Clouds&quot; a contributing factor in Socrates&#x27; trial and execution in 399 BC. There is some support for his opinion in the modern age. Aristophanes&#x27; plays however were generally unsuccessful in shaping public attitudes on important questions, as evidenced by their ineffectual opposition to the Peloponnesian War, demonstrated in the play &quot;Lysistrata&quot;, and to populists such as Cleon. Moreover, the trial of Socrates followed Athens&#x27; traumatic defeat by Sparta, many years after the performance of the play, when suspicions about the philosopher were fuelled by public animosity towards his disgraced associates such as Alcibiades.

Socrates is presented in &quot;The Clouds&quot; as a petty thief, a fraud and a sophist with a specious interest in physical speculations. However, it is still possible to recognize in him the distinctive individual defined in Plato&#x27;s dialogues. 
The practice of asceticism (as for example idealized by the Chorus in lines 412–19), disciplined, introverted thinking (as described by the Chorus in lines 700–6) and conversational dialectic (as described by Socrates in lines 489–90) appear to be caricatures of Socratic behaviours later described more sympathetically by Plato. 
The Aristophanic Socrates is much more interested in physical speculations than is Plato&#x27;s Socrates, yet it is possible that the real Socrates did take a strong interest in such speculations during his development as a philosopher and there is some support for this in Plato&#x27;s dialogues &quot;Phaedo&quot; 96A and &quot;Timaeus&quot;.

It has been argued that Aristophanes caricatured a &#x27;pre-Socratic&#x27; Socrates and that the philosopher depicted by Plato was a more mature thinker who had been influenced by such criticism. Conversely, it is possible that Aristophanes&#x27; caricature of the philosopher merely reflects his own ignorance of philosophy. 
According to yet another view, &quot;The Clouds&quot; can best be understood in relation to Plato&#x27;s works, as evidence of a historic rivalry between poetic and philosophical modes of thought.

==&quot;The Clouds&quot; and Old Comedy==
During the &quot;parabasis proper&quot; (lines 518–626), the Chorus reveals that the original play was badly received when it was produced. References in the same parabasis to a play by Eupolis called &quot;Maricas&quot; produced in 421 BC and criticism of the populist politician Hyperbolus who was ostracized in 416 indicate that the second version of &quot;The Clouds&quot; was probably composed somewhere between 421–16 BC. 
The parabasis also includes an appeal to the audience to prosecute Cleon for corruption. Since Cleon died in 422 it can be assumed that this appeal was retained from the original production in 423 and thus the extant play must be a partial revision of the original play.

The revised play is an incomplete form of Old Comedy. Old Comedy conventionally limits the number of actors to three or four, yet there are already three actors on stage when Superior and Inferior enter the action and there is no song at that point that would allow for a change of costume. The play is unusually serious for an Old Comedy and possibly this was the reason why the original play failed at the City Dionysia. 
As a result of this seriousness, there is no celebratory song in the &quot;exodus&quot;, and this also is an uncharacteristic omission. A typical Aristophanic Chorus, even if it starts out as hostile to the protagonist, is the protagonist&#x27;s cheer squad by the end of the play. In &quot;The Clouds&quot; however, the Chorus appears sympathetic at first but emerges as a virtual antagonist by the end of the play.

The play adapts the following elements of Old Comedy in a variety of novel ways.
*Parodos: The arrival of the Chorus in this play is unusual in that the singing begins offstage some time before the Chorus appears. It is possible that the concealed Chorus was not fully audible to the audience and this might have been a factor in the original play&#x27;s failure. Moreover, the majestic opening song is more typical of tragedy than comedy.
*Parabasis: The &quot;parabasis proper&quot; (lines 518–62) is composed in eupolidean tetrameter rather than the conventional anapestic tetrameter. Aristophanes does not use eupolideans in any other of his extant plays. The first parabasis (510–626) is otherwise conventional. However the second parabasis (1113–30) is in a shortened form, comprising an epirrhema in trochaic tetrameter but without the songs and the antepirrhema needed for a conventional, symmetrical scene.
*Agon: The play has two agons. The first is between Superior and Inferior (949–1104). Superior&#x27;s arguments are in conventional anapestic tetrameter but Inferior presents his case in iambic tetrameters, a variation that Aristophanes reserves for arguments that are not to be taken seriously. A similar distinction between anapestic and iambic arguments is made in the agons in &quot;The Knights&quot; and &quot;The Frogs&quot;. The second agon in &quot;The Clouds&quot; is between Strepsiades and his son (1345–1451) and it is in iambic tetrameter for both speakers.
*Episodes: Informal dialogue between characters is conventionally in iambic trimeter. However the scene introducing Superior and Inferior is conducted in short lines of anapestic rhythm (889–948). Later, in the agon between Strepsiades and his son, a line of dialogue in iambic trimeter (1415) – adapted from Euripides&#x27; &quot;Alcestis&quot; – is inserted into a speech in iambic tetrameter, a transition that seems uncharacteristically clumsy.

<text>Still Cyco After All These Years is the seventh studio album by American crossover thrash band Suicidal Tendencies, released in 1993. The album is composed of re-recorded songs from the band&#x27;s 1983 debut album, &quot;Suicidal Tendencies&quot;; re-recordings of &quot;War Inside My Head&quot; and &quot;A Little Each Day&quot; from the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Join the Army&quot;; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Me Your Nothin&#x27;&quot; which was previously released as a B-side to &quot;Send Me Your Money&quot;.

The album was recorded in 1989–1990 during the &quot;Lights...Camera...Revolution!&quot; sessions. It contained the songs from the band&#x27;s 1983 self-titled debut album. Frontman Mike Muir was upset with Frontier Records, the independent label that released Suicidal Tendencies&#x27; debut album, over various royalty and publishing issues. Since Muir did not have the rights to reissue the debut, he instead re-recorded the songs for release through Epic Records.

Singles for &quot;Still Cyco After All These Years&quot; were released for &quot;Institutionalized&quot; and &quot;I Saw Your Mommy&quot;. Music videos were made for &quot;Institutionalized&quot; and &quot;War Inside My Head&quot; (previously available on the 1990 VHS &quot;Lights...Camera...Suicidal&quot;).

This album marked the only time Suicidal Tendencies did not make any personnel changes over three consecutive studio recordings, as the lineup of Mike Muir, Mike Clark, Dean Pleasants, Josh Paul and Brooks Wackerman had recorded their previous album &quot;Freedumb&quot; and their 1998 EP &quot;Six the Hard Way&quot;. Paul and Wackerman did, however, leave the band after the 2001 release of their split album &quot;Friends &amp; Family, Vol. 2&quot;.

<doc id="157347" wikidata="Q880348" url="?curid=157347" title="Battle of Aldenhoven (1794)">
<text>The Battle of Aldenhoven or Battle of the Roer (2 October 1794) saw a Republican French army commanded by Jean Baptiste Jourdan defeat a Habsburg army under François Sébastien Charles Joseph de Croix, Count of Clerfayt which was defending the line of the Roer River. A key crossing was won by the French right wing at Düren after heavy fighting. The Austrian retreat from the Roer conceded control of the west bank of the Rhine River to France. The battle occurred during the War of the First Coalition, part of a wider conflict called the Wars of the French Revolution. Aldenhoven is located in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany about 21 kilometres (13 mi) northeast of Aachen. 

== Background ==
The Flanders campaign of 1794 saw the French Army of the North and Army of the Ardennes under General Charles Pichegru, and later elements of the Army of the Moselle under General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, attack both flanks of the Coalition army facing them. 

After the pivotal battle of Fleurus on 26 June 1794, the Coalition army began what would become a general retreat out of Flanders, as the Austrian government had decided at this point that the Austrian Netherlands were too much trouble to hold on to. As French pressure forced the Coalition army further and further back, it divided into two major forces on divergent routes of retreat dictated by their governments’ political objectives, as the British and Dutch fell back northwards to defend the Dutch Republic, while the Austrians fell back eastwards to defend the Rhine.

== The Austrian Retreat to the Roer ==
After the battle of Fleurus, the Allied army, then under Prince Coburg, initially withdrew to Mont St. Jean. On 1 July, after the French armies that had defeated them under the battle, now formally constituted as the Army of Sambre-and-Meuse under Jourdan, captured Mons on their flank, they commenced a retreat towards Brussels. 

At this point, although the British and Dutch contingents in the allied army remained nominally under Coburg’s command, the Austrian and the Anglo-Dutch forces functioned essentially separately and with no regard for one another. On 5 July at Waterloo, Prince Coburg and the Duke of York, commander of the British contingent, agreed to defend a line from Antwerp to Louvain, Wavre, Gembloux and Namur, but Coburg promptly cancelled this agreement the next day when attacked by Jourdan and retreated with the Austrians towards Malines (Mechelen) and Louvain (Leuven), vacating Brussels along the way.

Attacked further on 7-8 July, and compelled to relinquish Namur, Coburg moved the Austrians even further back to a line centred on Tirlemont. A week later, French attacks captured Malines and Louvain, prompting Coburg to begin a retreat back across the Meuse, eventually crossing at Maastricht on 24 July, occupying a defensive line on the east bank.

Following this retreat, Coburg had resigned, and was replaced by Count Clerfayt. The Austrians held their position on the Meuse through August, as the Army of Sambre-and-Meuse awaited the return of some 40,000 men that had been detached under Barthelemy Scherer to besiege and recapture Coalition fortified towns that had now been abandoned in the rear following the allied retreat. 

Upon Scherer’s return on 4 September, Jourdan, now strong enough, launched an attack that crumpled Clerfayt’s left flank at the battle of the Ourthe, also known as the battle of Sprimont. With his entire position on the Meuse now outflanked and compromised, Clerfayt was forced to retreat further back the Roer river, the last river defence line before the Rhine itself. 

== French Order of Battle ==
The French Army of Sambre-and-Meuse that fought at the Roer River was made up of elements from three armies that had been assembled to fight at Fleurus–the right wing of the Army of the North, the Army of the Ardennes, and the left wing of the Army of the Moselle. 

Formally constituted as an army on 29 June under the command of Jourdan, the Army after the battle of Sprimont consisted of some 120,000 men in three corps, with the left wing under Jean-Baptiste Kleber, the right under Barthelemy Scherer, and the centre under Jourdan’s personal command.

Days after Sprimont, Jourdan detached some 15,000 men under Philibert Duhesme to besiege Maastricht. The remaining 105,000 men remaining were organised in divisions as follows:

Left Wing (Kleber)

* Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte
* Louis Friant
* Joseph Leonard Richard

Centre (Jourdan)

* Francois Lefebvre
* Jean-Etienne Championnet
* Antoine Morlot
* Jacques-Maurice Hatry
* Pierre Joseph Dubois (cavalry division)

Right Wing (Scherer)

* Francois Severin Marceau
* Jean Adam Mayer
* Honore Alexandre Hacquin

== Austrian Positions ==
Clerfayt&#x27;s 76,000-strong army was deployed behind the steep-banked Roer with its left flank at Düren and its right flank at Roermond.The positions around Aldenhoven were entrenched, as were other portions of the line, and the Austrians had destroyed all bridges and dug up all fords along the river. The river was also running high during this period of time, adding to the defence. Clerfayt placed the bulk of his forces between Düren and Linnich, with an advanced west-bank position at Aldenhoven in front of his center at Jülich. The extreme right was in tenuous communication with the army of the Duke of York near Grave. 

== French Plan of Attack ==
On 1 October 1794, Jourdan ordered Schérer and the Right Wing to cross the Roer and seize Düren. In the center, Jourdan directed Morlot and Championnet to capture Aldenhoven in the centre and cross the river at Jülich, while Lefebvre occupied Linnich on their left and Hatry occupied Altorp on their right. Meanwhile, Kléber and the Left Wing were instructed to move upstream from a position opposite Roermond and cross the Roer at Ratheim (near Hückelhoven). 

== Battle ==

On 2 October, General Jourdan ordered the Army of Sambre-and-Meuse to force the line of the Roer river, and the 100,000 men of the army attacked on a front of nearly 60 miles from Roermond to Düren. The French were generally on the road through the morning of 2 October and only came into action near mid-day.

=== Attack by the French Left Wing ===
Kleber commenced his advance at 5am. Bernadotte’s regular infantry forced the light troops of Franz von Werneck defending the left bank to retire behind entrenchments and eventually withdraw across the Roer when Kleber&#x27;s artillery came up, while his light troops reached the Roer amidst heavy artillery and musket fire. 

Bernadotte then swam the Roer south of Ratheim with the 71st Demi-Brigade and four companies of grenadiers, supported by artillery moved forward by Kleber. However, despite their success, Kleber’s other divisions were unable to cross until the following day, after the Austrian withdrawal. 

During this attack, the future marshal Michel Ney led one cavalry regiment in a charge after crossing the river.

=== Attack by the French Centre ===
The French centre under Jourdan’s direct supervision also achieved success in their attack. 

On the left, Lefebvre’s division advanced in a line of battalion columns, captured Linnich, and drove the Austrians back to Genevich on the right bank. He then established a bridge and crossed the Roer the next morning. On the right, Hatry also captured Altorp. 

Meanwhile, Championnet’s and Morlot’s divisions advanced towards Aldenhoven. Championnet reported being able to take advantage of the broken terrain in front of his position to rapidly approach and assault the enemy in his front with light artillery and columns of infantry. The divisions captured Aldenhoven and forced the Austrians to fall back to their prepared fortifications behind the town, where they held until they were threatened from the flanks by Lefebvre&#x27;s and Hatry&#x27;s successes. They then retreated back across the Roer to Julich. 

=== Attack by the French Right Wing ===
Scherer ordered his divisions to advance from their camps at Eschweiler and Gürzenich at 4am. He planned to outflank the Austrian left wing, under Count Latour, with Mayer’s division, while Marceau’s and Hacquin’s divisions frontally assaulted the Austrian defence.

Marceau’s division made considerable progress towards Düren, crossing the Roer by 3pm, but could not advance further without support from Mayer and Hacquin, both of which were delayed in their advances. Mayer’s outflanking move was delayed, but he eventually joined Marceau at 6pm. Together they captured and held Düren and advanced across the Düren plateau, although Mayer’s division was momentarily panicked by a terrible cannonade from a concealed artillery battery. Hacquin then joined them at 7pm from the direction of Eschweiler and the Bergheim forest, but arrived too late in the day to make any contribution to the main attack. Scherer then ordered his troops to bivouac in the field at the end of the day pending a resumption of the attack the next morning.

By the end of the day, Scherer&#x27;s corps had completely crossed the Roer and captured Düren, outflanking and essentially compromising Clerfayt&#x27;s entire river defence line.

== Aftermath ==
With only partial success achieved, Jourdan expected to continue the assault on 3 October, but Clerfayt, outnumbered and with his river line already breached on both flanks, withdrew in the night towards the Rhine, crossing to the right bank of the Rhine at Cologne on 6 October. That same day, the French soldiers pursuing Clerfayt occupied the part of the city on the left bank. With Clerfayt’s withdrawal, the French were left in possession of everything on the left bank of the Rhine. Jourdan occupied Bonn and Krefeld on 8 and 9 October, and Cleves (Kleve) on 18 October. Marceau captured Coblenz on 17 October with the help of reinforcements sent from the Army of the Moselle, which was at that time besieging Luxembourg. Dusseldorf was captured on 23 October following a massive bombardment that drove the Austrian garrison out. 

Reaching the Rhine also freed Jourdan to reinforce Duhesme at Maastricht, sending Kleber’s corps to enable more aggressive siege operations. Assembling sufficient siege artillery by 23 October, Kleber began bombarding Maastricht on 1 November. With no chance of relief, the city surrendered on 4 November, securing Jourdan’s supply lines. 

The battle of Aldenhoven was the last advance undertaken by the Army of Sambre-and-Meuse in 1794. On 25 November, Minister of War Lazare Carnot authorised the Army to go into winter quarters on the banks of the Rhine.

<doc id="157348" wikidata="Q601875" url="?curid=157348" title="Battle of Almonacid">
<text>The Battle of Almonacid was fought on 11 August 1809 during the Peninsular War between Sébastiani&#x27;s IV Corps of the French Peninsular Army, which King Joseph of Spain had withdrawn from the Battle of Talavera to defend Madrid, and the Spanish Army of La Mancha under General Venegas. After the decisive charges of Polish uhlans, the battle resulted in a French victory.

==Background==
The Spanish campaign in late 1809 started with the Battle of Talavera.

===Prelude===

After the defeat at Talavera, King Joseph retreated with his French army to the vicinity of Toledo and ordered General Sébastiani to attack the portion of the Spanish La Mancha army threatening Madrid under the command of Venegas at Aranjuez. On 5 August, however, due in large part to the hastiness of the attack and the limited number of Tagus River crossings, Sébastiani and the French forces were defeated in a short battle at Aranjuez. Sébastiani chose next to flank Venegas by moving his army west, crossing the Tagus at Toledo, and then returning to the east to attack the Spanish. Venegas, however, anticipated that Sébastiani would attempt such a tactic and moved his forces westward south of the Tagus. On 10 August, both armies were concentrated in the vicinity of Almonacid. 

Venegas&#x27; Spanish force consisted of 22,000 infantry, more than 3,000 horses and 29 pieces of artillery, and was organized in five divisions commanded respectively by Luis Lacy, Gaspar de Vigodet, Pedro Agustín Girón, Francisco González de Castejón and Tomás de Zeraín. Miguel de los Ríos and the Marquess of Gelo served as Majors General of the cavalry and the infantry, while Brigadiers Antonio de la Cruz and Juan Bouligni were Commanders-in-chief of Artillery and Engineers. They were so confident of victory that they disregarded all the established rules for camping out during times of military conflict, especially being so close to the enemy.
Sébastiani&#x27;s French force had crossed the Tagus on 9 August, settling that same day in the nearby town of Nambroca, a league away from Almonacid.

The Spanish commander, after hearing the opinion of the other generals, who agreed with him despite being aware of the retreat of the allied army from Talavera de la Reina towards Extremadura, decided to attack the French on 12 August in order to rest his troops. The French army anticipated this and appeared in front of the Spanish positions at half past five in the morning of 11 August, with 14,000 troops of the IV Corps commanded by Sebastiani, who attacked the Spanish immediately without waiting for the reserve under the command of Dessolles and King Joseph Bonaparte in person to come up.

The La Mancha army hastily positioned itself in front of Almonacid and on both sides in the following formation: Vigodet&#x27;s division, a little behind, on the far right, with much of the cavalry; continuing to the left, Castejón&#x27;s division was established on the Utrera hill, Zerain&#x27;s division beside it covering the Santo hill, and Lacy&#x27;s division closer at the Guazalate stream; the 3rd division, Girón&#x27;s, acting as reserve, was spread between the heights of Cerrojones, on the extreme left and the key to the entire line of battle, and the Cerro de la Cruz or Castillo hill, named for the castle ruins on its summit.

==Battle==
===First attacks===
After intense artillery fire, returned in kind by the Spaniards, Jean François Leval with Polish and German-Dutch divisions attacked the Spanish left wing. The Bailén and Jaén battalions of the 3rd Division twice repelled the Poles, but received no reinforcement from the reserve. With the Polish division encouraged by the Germans coming up to their left, the French army was able to storm the vital position of the Cerrojones, even though at great cost (the three Polish regiments making up the division lost 47 officers). The French right was supported by a large body of troops advancing over the level ground at the foot of that hill, carrying out an envelopment on the extreme left, not stopped by a cavalry charge by the horsemen of Fernando VII and Granada, led by Colonel Antonio Zea and Commander Nicolás Chacón (Captain Francisco Soto died in this charge). The 1st division, in order to confront the Germans, had to withdraw somewhat and to reposition itself diagonally to the rearguard. However, as the centre and right were now retreating as well, under attack by the remaining enemy forces supported by the reserve which had just arrived under Dessolles and Joseph Bonaparte, this division was itself forced to take refuge on the Castillo hill.

===Start of the battle===
The 4th division was heavily attacked by numerous enemy artillery and could only respond with one horsedrawn battery. Their chief Lieutenant-Colonel, captain of the Artillery, Jose Chacón, soon fell mortally wounded and died from these injuries on 13 August in Tembleque. Lieutenant-Colonel Alvaro Chacón from this same Corps also died on the battlefield. The regiments of Jerez de la Frontera, Córdoba and the Spanish Guards distinguished themselves through their calmness and courage, the second under the command of its colonel Brigadier Francisco Carvajal. The cavalry on the right did not pursue the charge launched to contain the French, and thus the French were able to press their attack with continued vigour. The 5th division also yielded the field in a similar manner and it was not long before the enemy also occupied the town and the Castillo hill. There, the Spanish troops were unable to resist the terrible rain of projectiles that the French artillery aimed at them from all sides.

Vigodet&#x27;s division intervened in time to prevent an immediate and disastrous defeat, speedily and skilfully carrying out a change of front, protected by lively fire from the Spanish guns. This manoeuvre contained the pursuit of the disorganised forces of the centre and also restored order on the left, where the Polish and German divisions threatened to surround the line completely and to cut off its retreat. There the 2nd division mounted renewed resistance to the advance of the victors, who then tried everywhere to break through this unexpected obstacle that was preventing them making the most of their victory. A large mass of Milhaud&#x27;s much-feared dragoons charged towards the left, and in that last period of the battle the troops of Vigodet covered themselves in glory. All fought with courage and self-sacrifice: the artillery, firing during withdrawal, covering with shrapnel the heads of the imperial columns; the cavalry, formed by riders of different Corps that went about reuniting the dispersed troops, its steadfastness impressing the very top ranks of the enemy; and the infantry remaining imperturbable amidst the intense fire and the prevailing confusion and disorder. A squad of grenadiers of the Provincial of Ronda sent by Lieutenant Antonio Espinosa, approaching the enemy horsemen with fixed bayonets, was able to stop them and even to pull away a cannon, which was spiked by their leader. The second lieutenant of artillery, Juan Montenegro, also managed to save a gun of his battery, sacrificing himself for his comrades-in-arms. Only the unfortunate accident of an explosion among the ammunition carts, frightening the horses, produced some disorder of which the enemy took advantage, harassing and hounding more closely on the final ascents, to stab a few soldiers and to take some of the guns.

===End of the battle===
The French had already taken 2,500 losses and did not continue active pursuit beyond Mora. The defeated Spanish army was able to take the Andalusia highway and arrive in good order at Manzanares. However, on arriving there, false rumours that enemy forces were in Valdepeñas (Ciudad Real) caused many of the Spanish to disperse, not stopping until they got to the Sierra Morena. Spanish losses did not exceed 4,000 men, including those who were killed, wounded and imprisoned. However, among the dead was the commander of the infantry regiment of the first division, Colonel Vicente Martínez, and among the wounded was the colonel of the Granada dragoons, Diego Ballesteros, who remained a prisoner in France until the end of the war.

==Aftermath==
The Spanish campaign in late 1809 proceeded with the second Madrid offensive in the Battle of Tamames.

==Legacy==
To commemorate this military feat, a royal decree of 30 May 1816 created a military medal with the following inscription in the centre: &quot;From Fernando VII&quot;, and around the edge: &quot;In Almonacid, 11th August 1809&quot;).

<text>The Battle of Amberg, fought on 24 August 1796, resulted in a Habsburg victory by Archduke Charles over a French army led by Jean-Baptiste Jourdan. This engagement marked a turning point in the Rhine campaign, which had previously seen French successes.

== Background ==

=== Plans ===
The French planned an invasion of southern Germany in 1796. General of Division (MG) Jourdan with the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse would advance from the middle Rhine while MG Jean Moreau would cross the river farther south with the Army of Rhin-et-Moselle. Jourdan held a bridgehead over the Rhine at Neuwied while MG Jean-Baptiste Kléber commanded his left wing based on an entrenched camp at Düsseldorf. Moreau&#x27;s army comprised 71,581 infantry and 6,515 cavalry. He organized these into a Right Wing under MG Pierre Ferino, a Center led by MG Louis Desaix, and a Left Wing commanded by MG Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr.

Field Marshal Archduke Charles commanded the Army of the Lower Rhine. Charles and his deputy, Feldzeugmeister (FZM) Wilhelm von Wartensleben faced Jourdan along the Lahn River. This stream flows in a southwesterly direction into the Rhine near Koblenz. To the south, FZM Maximilien, Count Baillet de Latour positioned his Army of the Upper Rhine to defend against Moreau.

=== June operations ===
On 4 June 1796, 11,000 soldiers of the Army of the Sambre-et-Meuse, under François Lefebvre pushed back a 6,500-man Austrian force at Altenkirchen, north of the Lahn. On 6 June, the French placed Ehrenbreitstein Fortress under siege. At Wetzlar on the Lahn, Lefebvre ran into Charles&#x27; concentration of 36,000 Austrians on 15 June. Casualties were light on both sides, but Jourdan pulled back to Niewied while Kléber recoiled toward Düsseldorf. Feldmarschal-Leutnant (FML) Pál Kray&#x27;s 30,000 soldiers bested Kléber&#x27;s 24,000 at Uckerath east of Bonn on 19 June, prompting the Frenchman to continue his withdrawal to the north.

Meanwhile, operations of the Army of the Rhin-et-Moselle progressed more successfully for the French. On the 15th, Desaix and 30,000 French troops defeated FML Franz Petrasch&#x27;s 11,000 Austrians at Maudach near Speyer. The French suffered 600 casualties while Austrian losses were three times as heavy. Part of Moreau&#x27;s army under MG Jean-Charles Abbatucci mounted an assault crossing over the Rhine at Kehl opposite Strasbourg on 24 June. The defenders were French émigrés and the forces of minor German states belonging to the Holy Roman Empire. They fought gamely, but were beaten with the loss of 700 men while the French lost 150. On 28 June, Desaix defeated FML Anton Sztaray&#x27;s Imperial troops again at Renchen, inflicting 1,400 casualties for only 200 French killed and wounded. In the following weeks the Austrians determined some of their Imperial German allies to be unreliable and disarmed them.

In reaction to the defeats in the south, Archduke Charles left Wartensleben in command of 35,000 men along the Lahn, put 30,000 troops into the fortress of Mainz and rushed south with 20,000 soldiers to reinforce Latour.

=== July operations ===
After a minor clash at Rastatt on 5 July, Archduke Charles and Latour took up a position at Malsch with 32,000 troops. On 9 July, Moreau defeated the Army of the Upper Rhine at the Battle of Ettlingen. The archduke retreated to Stuttgart, where he skirmished with the French on 21 July before continuing to withdraw east. When Jourdan heard of French successes against the Army of the Upper Rhine, he went over to the offensive. After a series of minor victories at Neuwied, Giessen, and Friedberg in der Wetterau in early July, the French pressed Wartensleben back to Frankfurt am Main.

=== August operations ===
Charles ordered Wartensleben to unite with him in order to crush Moreau. However, his colleague proved unwilling to cooperate. On 11 August, Moreau overpowered the outnumbered archduke at the Battle of Neresheim. The Austrian southern wing retreated to the south bank of the Danube at Donauwörth. To the north, Jourdan pushed Wartensleben back through Würzburg and Nuremberg. Kléber clashed with Kray on 17 August at Sulzbach-Rosenberg, west of Amberg. Charles&#x27; strategy of falling back before the two superior French armies while seeking an opportunity to combine against one of them had so far failed.

== Battle ==

=== Reconnaissance ===
A change in Austrian fortunes came when an alert cavalry brigadier, General-Major Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf detected an opportunity during a wide reconnaissance. He sent a note to Archduke Charles, &quot;If your Royal Highness will or can advance 12,000 men against Jourdan&#x27;s rear, he is lost.&quot; Charles left 30,000 men under Latour to watch Moreau, and hurried north with 27,000 to find Jourdan still pressing Wartensleben near Amberg. On 22 August at Neumarkt in der Oberpfalz, Charles brushed aside one of Jourdan&#x27;s divisions under MG Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte. This placed the archduke squarely on the French right rear.

=== Combat ===
The total forces available were 48,000 Austrians and 45,000 French. On 24 August, Charles struck the French right flank while Wartensleben attacked frontally. The French Army of Sambre-et-Meuse was overcome by weight of numbers and Jourdan retired northwest. The Austrians lost only 400 casualties of the 40,000 men they brought onto the field. French losses were 1,200 killed and wounded, plus 800 captured out of 34,000 engaged. Instead of supporting his colleague, Moreau pushed further east.

=== Results ===
On the same day as the Battle of Amberg, Moreau inflicted a sharp defeat on Latour at the Battle of Friedberg in Bavaria. On 1 September, Moreau clashed with Latour and Nauendorf at Geisenfeld, southeast of Ingolstadt. At the same time, Charles&#x27; victorious Austrians pursued Jourdan&#x27;s beaten army. The widening gap between the two French armies finally caused Moreau to abandon his gains and pull back toward Ulm. The Battle of Würzburg, fought on 3 September, would determine the winner of the campaign.

<text>The Battle of Salamanca (in French and Spanish known as the Battle of the Arapiles) took place on 22July 1812. An Anglo-Portuguese army under the Earl of Wellington (future Duke of Wellington) defeated Marshal Auguste Marmont&#x27;s French forces at Arapiles, south of Salamanca, Spain, during the Peninsular War. A Spanish division was also present but took no part in the battle.

The battle involved a succession of flanking manoeuvres in oblique order, initiated by the British heavy cavalry brigade and Pakenham&#x27;s 3rd Division and continued by the cavalry and the 4th, 5th and 6th divisions. These attacks resulted in a rout of the French left wing. Marmont and his deputy commander, General Bonet, received shrapnel wounds in the first few minutes of firing. Confusion amongst the French command may have been decisive in creating an opportunity, which Wellington seized.

General Bertrand Clauzel, third in seniority, assumed command and ordered a counter-attack by the French reserve toward the depleted Allied centre. The move proved partly successful but with Wellington having sent his reinforcements to the centre, the Anglo-Portuguese forces prevailed.

Allied losses numbered 3,129 British and 2,038 Portuguese dead or wounded. The Spanish troops took no part in the battle as they were positioned to block French escape routes and suffered just six casualties. The French suffered about 13,000 dead, wounded and captured. As a consequence of Wellington&#x27;s victory, his army was able to advance to and liberate Madrid for two months, before retreating to Portugal. The French were forced to abandon Andalusia permanently while the loss of Madrid irreparably damaged King Joseph&#x27;s pro-French government.

==Background==
In April 1812, following the successful Siege of Badajoz during the allied campaign in Spain, Wellington and the greater part of the Anglo-Portuguese army marched north to expel Marmont&#x27;s French army who had temporarily invaded Portugal. Following Marmont&#x27;s retreat to Salamanca Wellington took position behind the Agueda and Coa rivers. In May, acting on Wellington&#x27;s orders General Hill took a force of 7,000 men to destroy the bridge at Almaraz, breaking the only direct communications between Soult&#x27;s and Marmont&#x27;s armies.

On 13 June Wellington crossed the Agueda and advanced eastward to Salamanca, a town that was a major supply depot for the French army. The French had converted three convents into powerful forts to defend the town and the bridge across the river Tormes. On 19 June the first battery opened fire but it was not until 27 June that, with two of the convents battered and in flames and with no sign of relief, the French troops asked for surrender terms.

For several weeks Wellington found his movements north of Salamanca blocked by Marmont&#x27;s army, which constantly swelled with reinforcements. With the armies often marching close together, separated by the river, and Marmont repeatedly threatening Wellington&#x27;s supply line. Moving east, the French crossed to the south bank of the Tormes across another bridge at Huerta and by marching south then west hoped to turn the flank of Wellingtons&#x27; army. By the day of the battle Wellington had decided to withdraw his army all the way back to Portugal, but observed that with the two armies marching parallel to each other, with the British on the inside line, the French became strung out and Marmont had made the tactical error of separating his left flank from the main body of his army. The Duke immediately ordered the major part of his army to attack the overextended French left wing.

===Forces===
Marshal Marmont&#x27;s 50,000-man Army of Portugal contained eight infantry and two cavalry divisions, plus 78 artillery pieces. The infantry divisions were Maximilien Sebastien Foy&#x27;s 1st (4,900), Bertrand Clauzel&#x27;s 2nd (6,300), Claude François Ferey&#x27;s 3rd (5,400), Jacques Thomas Sarrut&#x27;s 4th (5,000), Antoine Louis Popon de Maucune&#x27;s 5th (5,000), Antoine François Brenier de Montmorand&#x27;s 6th (4,300), Jean Guillaume Barthélemy Thomières&#x27;s 7th (4,300), and Jean Pierre François Bonet&#x27;s 8th (6,400). Pierre François Xavier Boyer led 1,500 dragoons and Jean-Baptiste Theodore Curto commanded 1,900 light cavalry. Louis Tirlet directed 3,300 artillerymen and there were also 1,300 engineers, military police and wagon drivers.

Wellington&#x27;s 48,500-man army included eight infantry divisions, formed mainly by British and Portuguese units (also German and one of French royalists), and two independent brigades, five cavalry brigades and 54 cannons. The infantry divisions were Henry Frederick Campbell&#x27;s 1st (6,200), Edward Pakenham&#x27;s 3rd (5,800), Lowry Cole&#x27;s 4th (5,191), James Leith&#x27;s 5th (6,700), Henry Clinton&#x27;s 6th (5,500), John Hope&#x27;s 7th (5,100) and Charles Alten&#x27;s Light (3,500). Carlos de España commanded a 3,400-man Spanish division, while Denis Pack (2,600) and Thomas Bradford (1,900) led the independent Portuguese brigades.

Stapleton Cotton supervised the cavalry brigades. These included 1,000 British heavy dragoons (1st Cavalry Brigade) led by John Le Marchant, 1,000 British light dragoons (2nd Cavalry Brigade) under George Anson, 700 Anglo-German light horse under Victor Alten, 800 King&#x27;s German Legion (KGL) heavy dragoons led by Eberhardt Otto George von Bock and 500 Portuguese dragoons under Benjamin d&#x27;Urban. Hoylet Framingham commanded eight British (RHA: Ross, Bull, Macdonald; RA: Lawson&#x27;s, Gardiner, Greene, Douglas, May) and one Portuguese (Arriaga) six-gun artillery batteries.

==Battle==
===Manoeuvres===

Marmont&#x27;s army moved south early on 22July, its leading elements reaching an area southeast of Salamanca. To the west, the Marshal could see Wellington&#x27;s 7th Division deployed on a ridge. Spotting a dust cloud in the distance, Marmont assumed that most of the British army was in retreat and that he faced only a rearguard. He planned to move his French army south, then west to turn the British right flank.

This was a mistake as Wellington had most of his forces hidden behind the ridge, while his 3rd and 5th divisions were en route from Salamanca. Wellington had planned to retreat if outflanked, but waited to see if Marmont would make a blunder.

The Marshal&#x27;s army planned to move along an &quot;L&quot;-shaped ridge, with its angle near a steep height known as the Greater Arapile. That morning, the French occupied only the short, north-pointing part of the &quot;L&quot;. For his flanking move, Marmont marched his divisions west along the long side of the &quot;L&quot;. The Anglo-Allied army lay behind another &quot;L&quot;-shaped ridge, inside and parallel to the French &quot;L&quot;, and separated from it by a valley. Unseen by the French, Wellington assembled a powerful striking force along the long side of the British &quot;L&quot;.

As Marmont moved westward, the French became strung out along the long side of the &quot;L&quot;. Thomières&#x27;s division led the way, supported by Curto&#x27;s cavalry. After that, Maucune, Brenier, and Clauzel. Bonet, Sarrut and Boyer advanced close to the Greater Arapile, while Foy and Ferey held the short side of the &quot;L&quot;.

When the British 3rd Division and D&#x27;Urban&#x27;s brigade reached the top of the French &quot;L&quot;, they attacked Thomières. At the same time, Wellington launched the 5th and 4th divisions, backed by the 7th and 6th divisions, at the long side of the French &quot;L&quot;.

The 3rd Division came at the head of Thomières&#x27;s division in a two-deep line. Despite its deployment in column formation, the French division initially repulsed its attackers, but was then routed by a bayonet charge. Thomières was killed. Seeing British cavalry in the area, Maucune formed his division into squares, the standard formation to receive a mounted attack, but a poor choice when defending against infantry. With their two-deep line, Leith&#x27;s 5th Division easily defeated Maucune in a musketry duel. As the French foot soldiers fell back, Cotton ordered John Le Marchant&#x27;s heavy brigade (5th Dragoon Guards, 3rd and 4th dragoons) to attack them. The left wing of the French army was on the point of being defeated by the 3rd and 5th divisions of Anglo-Portuguese infantry when Le Marchant&#x27;s dragoons charged in and destroyed battalion after battalion with the heavy cavalrymen&#x27;s weapon, the sword, an exercise which had been designed by Le Marchant. Many of the French infantrymen sought the protection of the British infantry to escape the sabres of the dragoons. Le Marchant, knowing he had achieved a magnificent success having crushed eight French battalions, was leading a squadron when he was shot in the spine and killed. William Ponsonby succeeded to command of the brigade.

The French army lost its commander very early in the crisis. As Pakenham&#x27;s 3rd Division prepared to attack Thomières, Marmont finally realized his army&#x27;s peril. He dashed for his horse, but was caught in a British shellburst which broke his arm and two ribs. His second-in-command, Bonet, was wounded very soon afterwards. Records conflict, however, with Marmont claiming that he was wounded as his wing became overextended, and his incapacitation led to the error not being corrected before Wellington attacked. His enemies place the time of his wounding as during Wellington&#x27;s attack. For somewhere between 20 minutes and over an hour, the French Army of Portugal remained leaderless.

Cole&#x27;s 4th Division attacked Bonet&#x27;s division while Pack&#x27;s Portuguese assaulted the Greater Arapile. With the help of a 40-gun battery firing from the Greater Arapile, both attacks were repulsed by the French.

Assuming command, Clauzel did his best to salvage the dire situation. He committed Sarrut&#x27;s division to shore up the wrecked left flank, then launched a dangerous counterattack at Cole&#x27;s 4th Division using his own and Bonet&#x27;s divisions, supported by Boyer&#x27;s dragoons. This attack brushed aside Cole&#x27;s survivors and struck the 6th Division in Wellington&#x27;s second line. Marshal William Carr Beresford reacted promptly to the developing threat and immediately sent Spry&#x27;s Portuguese brigade of the 5th Division to engage the French infantry, while Wellington moved the 1st and 7th divisions to assist. After bitter resistance, the divisions of Clauzel and Bonet were defeated and the French army began to retreat.

As the rest of the French army streamed away, Clauzel ordered Ferey to hold off the victorious Allies at all costs. Ferey formed his division in a convex line, following the shape of the hillside. The French infantry had fought in battalion columns that day, but Ferey deployed seven battalions into a three-deep line, with both flanks covered by a battalion in square. The French divisional artillery battery was in close support. With its two British brigades in the front line, Clinton&#x27;s victorious 6th Division attacked Ferey&#x27;s division. The first volley of the French soldiers was particularly lethal. The slope was so steep that Ferey&#x27;s third rank could fire over the heads of the first two ranks. In the gathering dusk, it appeared to the soldiers of Clinton&#x27;s division that they were attacking a flaming mountain. On the British right flank, Major General Richard Hulse&#x27;s brigade suffered appalling losses: the 1st/11th Foot lost 340 men out of 516 as casualties while the 1/61st Foot lost 366 out of 546. The French also suffered severe losses and slowly edged backwards until the survivors formed at the edge of the forest. In this position, Ferey was killed by a round shot from the British artillery. There was a lull as Clinton withdrew his two mauled British brigades and placed Brigadier General Conde de Rezende&#x27;s Portuguese brigade in the front line for a final attack. The French shot the attacking formation to pieces; the Portuguese brigade reported 487 casualties. Clinton was compelled to replace them with his badly reduced British brigades. By this time the Allied 5th Division was pressing against the French left flank and Ferey&#x27;s line collapsed from left to right and disappeared into the forest. The French 31st Light Infantry Regiment on the right flank acted as rear guard. Ferey&#x27;s division lost over 1,100 men in this action. Wellington ordered Clinton to pursue, but his soldiers were completely exhausted. They advanced only 100 yards into the woods and went into bivouac.

===End===
Foy&#x27;s division covered the French retreat towards Alba de Tormes, where there was a bridge they could use to escape. Wellington, believing that the Alba de Tormes crossing was blocked by a Spanish battalion in a fortified castle, directed his pursuit along a different road. De Espana, however, had withdrawn the unit without informing Wellington, which allowed the French to escape. The French Army of Portugal suffered 7,000 killed and wounded and 7,000 captured. Besides Marmont&#x27;s severe wounding, two divisional commanders were killed and another wounded. Half of the 5,214 Anglo-Allied losses came from the 4th and 6th divisions. Cotton, Cole, and Leith were all wounded.

==Aftermath==
The Battle of Salamanca was a damaging defeat for the French and while they regrouped, Anglo-Portuguese forces entered Madrid on 6August. The Siege of Burgos ensued, then in the autumn the Anglo-Portuguese retreated to Portugal when renewed French concentrations threatened to trap them, although the French forces, which had been stripped of several experienced units to join the Russian campaign, were reluctant to go on the offensive.

A failure by Spanish troops to guard a crucial escape route over the bridge at Alba de Tormes tainted the victory. This may have resulted from a misunderstanding between Spanish and British commanders. Subsequent pursuit failed to destroy or to capture the fleeing French.

===Wellington===

The battle established Wellington as an offensive general. It was said that he &quot;defeated an army of 40,000 men in 40 minutes.&quot; Six days after the battle, Foy wrote in his diary,
&quot;This battle is the most cleverly fought, the largest in scale, the most important in results, of any that the English have won in recent times. It brings up Lord Wellington&#x27;s reputation almost to the level of that of Marlborough. Up to this day we knew his prudence, his eye for choosing good positions, and the skill with which he used them. But at Salamanca he has shown himself a great and able master of manoeuvring. He kept his dispositions hidden nearly the whole day: he allowed us to develop our movement before he pronounced his own: he played a close game: he utilized the oblique order in the style of Frederick the Great.&quot;

===Action at Garcia Hernandez===
The following day, Wellington&#x27;s King&#x27;s German Legion (KGL) heavy dragoons performed the astounding feat of &quot;breaking a square&quot; and over-running a portion of the French rearguard at the Battle of Garcia Hernandez. Moreover, they accomplished this twice within a few minutes.

===Imperial Eagle===
Two Imperial Eagles were captured at the battle of Salamanca. Ensign John Pratt of the Light Company of the 2nd Battalion 30th Foot took the Eagle of the 22nd Line Regiment, which is today on display in the Queen&#x27;s Lancashire Regiment Museum at Fulwood Barracks in Preston, Lancashire. The Eagle of the French 62nd Line (Thomières) was captured by Lieutenant Pearce of the 2nd Battalion 44th East Essex Regiment, a part of Lieutenant General Leith&#x27;s 5th Division. It is on display in the Essex Regiment Museum in Oaklands Park, Chelmsford, Essex. Three terracotta statues representing the captured eagles sit between the high pointed gables of Essex House, 375 High Street in Stratford, London.

=== Salamanca Day ===
Today, 22 July is known as Salamanca Day and is the regimental day for The Rifles.

==Cultural references==

*The battle is mentioned in Tolstoy&#x27;s novel &quot;War and Peace&quot;, Book 10 Chapter XXVI. Prior to the Battle of Borodino, Tolstoy describes Napoleon as receiving an aide-de-camp, Fabvier, who has just arrived with news of the Battle of Salamanca. &quot;Fabvier told him of the heroism and devotion of his troops fighting at Salamanca, at the other end of Europe, but with one thought – to be worthy of their Emperor – but with one fear – to fail to please him. The result of that battle had been deplorable. Napoleon made ironic remarks during Fabvier&#x27;s account, as if he had not expected that matters could not go otherwise in his absence&quot;.
*The battle features in &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Sword&quot; by Bernard Cornwell, in which Richard Sharpe helps Wellington bring the French to battle by feeding a known French spy false information. Cornwell also duplicated Wellington&#x27;s tactics at Salamanca in his retelling of Arthur&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Mount Badon, in &quot;&quot;, the third and final volume of Cornwell&#x27;s &quot;The Warlord Chronicles&quot;.
*The battle is described in Suzanna Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell&quot;, during the time that Jonathan Strange served under Lord Wellington.
*Salamanca Place, in Hobart, Tasmania, commemorates the battle. Mount Wellington is nearby.

<text>The Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube (20–21 March 1814) saw an Imperial French army under Napoleon face a much larger Allied army led by Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg during the War of the Sixth Coalition. On the second day of fighting, Emperor Napoleon finally realized he had blundered into battle as he was massively outnumbered, and immediately ordered a masked retreat. By the time the Austrian Field Marshal Schwarzenberg realized Napoleon was retreating, most of the French had already disengaged and the Allied pursuit afterwards failed to prevent the remaining French army from safely withdrawing to the north. This was Napoleon&#x27;s penultimate battle before his abdication and exile to Elba, the last being the Battle of Saint-Dizier.

While Napoleon fought against Prussian Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher&#x27;s Russo-Prussian army to the north, Schwarzenberg&#x27;s army pushed Marshal Jacques MacDonald&#x27;s army back toward Paris. After his victory at Reims, Napoleon moved south to threaten Schwarzenberg&#x27;s supply line to Germany. In response, the Austrian field marshal pulled his army back to Troyes and Arcis-sur-Aube. When Napoleon occupied Arcis, the normally cautious Schwarzenberg determined to fight it out rather than retreat. The clashes on the first day were inconclusive and Napoleon mistakenly believed he was following up a retreating enemy. On the second day, the French advanced to high ground and were appalled to see between 74,000 and 100,000 enemies in battle array south of Arcis. After bitter fighting with Napoleon personally participating, the French troops fought their way out, but it was a French setback.

== Background ==
=== Operations in the north ===
At the end of February 1814, Napoleon discovered that the Allied armies of Schwarzenberg and Blücher had separated and that Blücher&#x27;s army was making a lunge at Paris with 53,000 soldiers. Only 10,000 men under Marshals Auguste de Marmont and Édouard Mortier stood in Blücher&#x27;s path. The French emperor left 42,000 troops under marshals MacDonald and Nicolas Oudinot to contain Schwarzenberg&#x27;s main army and headed northwest with 35,000 soldiers to deal with the Prussian field marshal. Marmont and Mortier repulsed Blücher in the Battle of Gué-à-Tresmes on 28 February. However, Napoleon failed to catch Blücher who slipped out of the trap. At this time, the French emperor adopted a plan to first drive Blücher far away to the north, then to gather up the French frontier garrisons and finally to swoop down on Schwarzenberg&#x27;s supply line to Germany.

As Napoleon&#x27;s 48,000-man army chased Blücher&#x27;s army to the north, the Allies absorbed many reinforcements. These were led by Russian general Ferdinand von Wintzingerode and Prussian general Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Bülow. The French emperor believed that his opponent had 70,000 soldiers, but in fact, Blücher&#x27;s army numbered 110,000. On 7 March, Napoleon fought against Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov&#x27;s Russians in the Battle of Craonne which one authority called a French Pyrrhic victory. On 9–10 March Blücher defeated Napoleon&#x27;s much weaker army in the Battle of Laon. Marmont&#x27;s corps was routed, but Napoleon bluffed the Allies into not pursuing his beaten army. On 12 March an Allied corps under Emmanuel de Saint-Priest seized Reims from its French garrison. Napoleon immediately ordered his army to march to that city where he won the Battle of Reims the next day. Saint-Priest was mortally wounded and his corps routed with a loss of 3,000 men and 23 guns.

=== Napoleon strikes south ===
Napoleon spent three days resting his troops at Reims while Marshal Michel Ney reoccupied Châlons-sur-Marne. Ney was joined by a 3,000-man division that Jan Willem Janssens brought in from the Ardennes garrisons. The French emperor desired to move east to gather up other garrisons, but Schwarzenberg&#x27;s offensive to the south compelled him to march in that direction. While Napoleon operated against Blücher in the north, the main Allied army pressed MacDonald back toward Paris. On 27 February, Schwarzenberg defeated Oudinot in the Battle of Bar-sur-Aube, forcing MacDonald to withdraw to the west. The Allies overpowered MacDonald on 3–4 March at the Battle of Laubressel. Schwarzenberg occupied Troyes but halted there until 12 March in a welter of indecision. Encouraged by news of Blucher&#x27;s victory at Laon, the main Allied army crossed the River Seine and drove MacDonald beyond Provins by 16 March. Schwarzenberg&#x27;s offensive came to a sudden halt when tidings of Napoleon&#x27;s success at Reims arrived in the Allied camp.

Napoleon decided to move against Schwarzenberg with 24,000 soldiers plus reinforcements, while Marmont and Mortier with 21,000 troops observed Blücher&#x27;s army. The French emperor determined to march toward Arcis-sur-Aube, hoping to reach Troyes in the rear of the Allied main army. On 17 March Schwarzenberg withdrew his army toward the area between Troyes and Arcis. The following day, Napoleon&#x27;s advance guards drove Schwarzenberg&#x27;s cavalry south toward Arcis, creating alarm among the Allied leaders. The Austro-Bavarian V Corps under Karl Philipp von Wrede was ordered to hold Arcis until the remainder of Schwarzenberg&#x27;s army could retreat east from Troyes to Bar-sur-Aube. In the afternoon of 19 March, the French began to cross the River Aube at Plancy-l&#x27;Abbaye. A cavalry division under Louis-Michel Letort de Lorville continued southwest to Méry-sur-Seine where it captured an Allied pontoon train. The French cavalry divisions of Remi Joseph Isidore Exelmans and Pierre David de Colbert-Chabanais moved east on the south bank of the Aube from Plancy to Pouan-les-Vallées, halfway to Arcis.

Schwarzenberg interpreted this information as an indication that Napoleon&#x27;s main thrust was along the axis Plancy-Méry-Troyes. Believing that his communications were no longer threatened, he determined in the evening of 19 March to mass his army between Troyes and Arcis with the intention of advancing against the French. The Austrian army commander ordered Crown Prince William of Württemberg to assume command of the Allied III, IV and VI Corps and move to Charmont-sous-Barbuise, midway between Arcis and Troyes. The Guards and Reserve under Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly were directed to cross from the north to the south bank of the Aube and take a position at Mesnil-Lettre. On this day, MacDonald&#x27;s army was moving east along the north bank of the Seine with its leading elements at Pont-sur-Seine.

Napoleon believed that Schwarzenberg was in full retreat east to Bar-sur-Aube. In order to hurry the main Allied army on its way, the French emperor decided to move east on both the north and south banks of the Aube to seize Arcis. Once he gave the Allies a good shove, Napoleon planned to take the French army across the Marne at Vitry-le-François, march east and add the eastern garrisons to his army. The French emperor planned to add MacDonald&#x27;s 30,000 troops and Marmont&#x27;s 20,000 men to his army while on the march. Napoleon&#x27;s assessment of the situation was correct until Schwarzenberg decided to assume the offensive late on 19 March.

== Battle ==
===First day===
On 20 March, Schwarzenberg ordered Wrede to take position at Saint-Nabord-sur-Aube while extending the Crown Prince of Württemberg&#x27;s three corps between there and Voué. The Austrian field marshal intended to begin a westward advance at 11 am. Assuming that Napoleon was marching across his front from Plancy to Méry, Schwarzenberg hoped to smash into the exposed French flank. However, Napoleon was advancing east, not south, which threw off all of the Austrian army commander&#x27;s plans. In the event, the Crown Prince misunderstood his instructions and moved his troops to Prémierfait, taking them out of the day&#x27;s battle. Normally a proponent of vigorous measures, Tsar Alexander disapproved of Schwarzenberg&#x27;s resumption of the offensive.

Early in the morning, Ney and Horace Sebastiani&#x27;s cavalry advanced east along the south bank of the Aube. At 10:00 a.m. the French-occupied Arcis-sur-Aube which was abandoned by Wrede&#x27;s Bavarians. Local residents repeatedly warned that large Allied forces were within of Arcis. Ney and Sebastiani forwarded this information to Napoleon but the French emperor refused to believe it. The French quickly repaired the bridge over the Aube, which was only partially demolished by the Allies. Ney&#x27;s original orders called for his troops to cross to the north bank in preparation for a move eastward. Ney placed Janssens&#x27; division with its left flank in Torcy-le-Grand on the south bank of the Aube. Sebastiani&#x27;s cavalry took a position to Janssens&#x27; right while Pierre François Xavier Boyer&#x27;s division was placed in reserve. (Boyer&#x27;s division had only one brigade. Its second brigade was detached at the end of February and later became the third brigade of Jean François Leval&#x27;s division.)

At 1:00 pm. Napoleon arrived along the northern bank of the Aube river, crossed the bridge and met with Ney at Torcy-le-Grand. Convinced that the Allies were in full retreat, the French emperor accepted the report of a staff officer that only 1,000 Cossacks were nearby. Though he now knew that the Crown Prince&#x27;s left wing was out of touch, Schwarzenberg finally gave the order to launch an attack at 2:00 pm. Wrede&#x27;s infantry advanced on Torcy-le-Grand while a mass of Allied cavalry moved forward to challenge Sebastiani&#x27;s horsemen. Paisiy Sergeevich Kaisarov ordered an artillery bombardment, followed with a cavalry charge by his Cossacks, the Archduke Joseph Hussar Nr. 2 and Szekler Hussar Nr. 11 Regiments and Leopold von Geramb&#x27;s Austrian light cavalry brigade. The attack overthrew Colbert&#x27;s division in the first line and soon involved the defeat of Exelmans&#x27; division in the second line.

As a mob of fleeing French cavalry galloped for the Arcis bridge, Napoleon drew his sword and rode into their path shouting, &quot;See who will re-cross the bridge before me&quot;. At the same time, the crack troops of Louis Friant&#x27;s Old Guard division began crossing the bridge and took up a position to defend Arcis. Sebastiani&#x27;s badly shaken horsemen slowly began to recover from their panic and reorganize. During this crisis an Allied howitzer shell landed sputtering near the rallying troops. Seeing his soldiers flinching from the missile, Napoleon intentionally rode his horse directly over the bomb. The shell exploded and killed the horse, which went down, taking the emperor with it. Napoleon soon emerged unscathed from a cloud of smoke, mounted a fresh horse and rode off to inspect his army.
Wrede sent more cavalry to reinforce Kaisarov and ordered Anton Volkmann&#x27;s Austrian brigade to capture Torcy-le-Grand. The Bavarian corps commander hoped to seize the Arcis bridge to prevent more French reinforcements from arriving. Spearheaded by the Austrian Archduke Rudolf Infantry Regiment, Volkmann&#x27;s first attack broke into Torcy-le-Grand but was repelled by Guillaume Charles Rousseau&#x27;s brigade. However, Volkmann&#x27;s second attack drove the French from Torcy-le-Grand and it was necessary for Boyer&#x27;s troops to recapture the village, supported by intense artillery fire. Wrede ordered Peter de Lamotte&#x27;s Bavarian division to execute a third assault. The Allies captured Torcy-le-Grand for the third time but were ejected from the place by two Old Guard Grenadier battalions, a squadron of mounted gendarmes and a squadron of lancers. Between 5:00 and 8:00 pm, the French repulsed repeated assaults by the brigades of Volkmann, Georg Habermann and Prince Karl Theodor of Bavaria. The Allies detached the 1st Russian Grenadier Division under Pavel Nikolaevich Choglokov from the Reserve and sent it to support Wrede&#x27;s corps. The Archduke Rudolf Regiment suffered 500 casualties in the bitter fighting. Janssens was wounded and replaced by Étienne Nicolas Lefol.

At 2:00 pm, Letort&#x27;s guard cavalry left Méry with the newly captured pontoon train. During the afternoon, they became embroiled with the Crown Prince&#x27;s cavalry under Peter Petrovich Pahlen, Prince Adam of Württemberg and Johann Nepomuk von Nostitz-Rieneck. Letort&#x27;s horsemen inflicted 100 casualties on their foes while sustaining the loss of 120 men and three pontoons. Though assisted by Jean Nicolas Curely&#x27;s brigade from Sigismond Frédéric de Berckheim&#x27;s cavalry division, the French were driven back to Méry. Nevertheless, that evening Letort set out for Arcis via Plancy, leaving the pontoon train with Berckheim. 
At dusk, a 2,000-strong cavalry division under Charles Lefebvre-Desnouettes rode into Arcis. A new 4,500-man Young Guard division led by Christophe Henrion made it as far as Plancy before stopping to rest. Sebastiani&#x27;s rallied cavalry had skirmished with Kaisarov&#x27;s Allied horsemen all day. Deciding upon a night attack using Lefebvre-Desnouettes&#x27; fresh cavalry, Sebastiani placed guard lancers and &quot;Éclaireurs&quot; in the front rank, supported by cuirassiers. He hoped to silence an Allied artillery battery on Wrede&#x27;s left flank. Sebastiani&#x27;s &quot;magnificent&quot; charge smashed Kaisarov&#x27;s Cossacks and then veered to the left, pressing back some Austrian regiments. What was remarkable is that the attack included the jaded troopers of Colbert and Exelmans, who were routed earlier in the day. A brigade of Russian grenadiers formed a square and repelled the French horsemen. Bavarian, Russian, Austrian, and even a Prussian Guard cavalry squadron concentrated against the French, forcing their enemies to pull back, though they did it in good order. The cavalry of the two armies ended the fight with the village of Nozay between them.

===Second day===
On the first day, the Allies probably sustained 2,000 casualties and the French somewhat fewer. Despite their vastly superior numbers, the Allies did not gain an inch of ground. If Napoleon had understood that he was facing an army several times larger than his own, he probably would have retreated to the north bank of the Aube during the night. In fact, Tsar Alexander feared that Napoleon would pull back to the north bank and lunge east, seizing the bridge at Lesmont in the Allied rear. However, Napoleon still suffered from the delusion that Schwarzenberg&#x27;s army was in retreat while Wrede acted as rearguard. Though Schwarzenberg sent out his orders at 11:00 pm, the Crown Prince&#x27;s copy went astray and did not reach him until 5:00 a.m. on 21 March. Therefore, it took until 10:00 a.m. for the Crown Prince&#x27;s three corps to deploy between Wrede&#x27;s left flank and the Barbuise stream. The III Corps took post on Wrede&#x27;s left, the IV Corps was next and the VI Corps was on the extreme left near Voué. Part of the III Corps had been left behind to hold Troyes.

Historian Francis Loraine Petre stated that the Allies had 74,000 soldiers in line and 14,000 more guarding Troyes and the line of the Seine. David G. Chandler asserted that Schwarzenberg brought up and deployed over 80,000 troops to face the French. On the second day, the Allied host faced 28,000 French soldiers, of whom 9,000 were cavalrymen. George Nafziger credited the Allies with 83,400 infantry and 24,500 cavalry and Napoleon with 29,800 troops. Digby Smith and Gaston Bodart counted 100,000 Allied soldiers of whom only 43,000 came into action while the French army numbered 23,000-foot soldiers and 7,000 horsemen.

Napoleon, whose army numbered only 18,000 men on the first day, awaited reinforcements. Henrion&#x27;s division, consisting of the depots of the Young Guard, reached Arcis. Oudinot with Leval&#x27;s VII Corps infantry division and the II Cavalry Corps under Antoine Louis Decrest de Saint-Germain arrived at Arcis at 8:00 am. MacDonald&#x27;s II Corps, XI Corps, V Cavalry Corps and VI Cavalry Corps were still one day&#x27;s march away. However, another source stated that Édouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud&#x27;s V Cavalry Corps arrived on 21 March. The cavalry divisions of Berckheim and Jean-Marie Defrance also joined the French army at Arcis. Napoleon sent patrols to the east, but these detected nothing suspicious because Wrede had pulled back. At 10:00 a.m. the French emperor gave the order to attack. Altogether, Napoleon counted a total of 28,000 troops on 21 March.

As the troops of Ney and Sebastiani reached the crest of the plateau, they found themselves facing perhaps 100,000 enemies arrayed in three lines stretching from the Aube to the Barbuise. In front of this immense host were skirmishers and at least 100 field guns. Sebastiani immediately attacked Pahlen&#x27;s cavalry, opposite him, driving it back on the second line. The French position was extremely dangerous, especially since Torcy-le-Grand was left empty of troops and Arcis was lightly held. In this crisis, Ney kept his battalions in column, ready to retreat. If Schwarzenberg had launched a general attack at this time, the French army would have been shattered. Instead, the Austrian army commander called a council of war, which lasted until noon. The council decided to attack and Schwarzenberg drew up detailed instructions. However, he alone would give the signal to advance.

Sebastiani&#x27;s attack on Pahlen convinced Schwarzenberg that Napoleon was getting ready to advance. Actually, by 1:00 pm. Napoleon finally came to the realization that he was desperately outnumbered and needed to get his army out of danger. Ney began to pull his divisions back. A flurry of orders issued from Imperial Headquarters. By 1:30 pm, a bridge of boats was established at Villette-sur-Aube a short distance west of Arcis. Soon afterward, Antoine Drouot and the Old Guard were instructed to retreat by the Villette bridge while Lefol&#x27;s division and the reserve artillery crossed the Arcis span. The cavalry corps of Saint-Germain and Milhaud soon joined the retreat. Sebastiani was ordered to cover the operation, which his cavalry did by a phased withdrawal. To keep the Allies from interfering with the retreat, Napoleon ordered Oudinot to defend Arcis using Leval&#x27;s division, consisting of three brigades of Peninsular War veterans.

At 3:00 pm, Schwarzenberg finally realized that Napoleon was retreating. Instead of unleashing his corps at once, he called another council of war. Wrede was ordered to cross to the north bank of the Aube at Chaudrey, to the east of Arcis. Only his cavalry made it across the river there and his infantry had to march upstream and cross at Lesmont. The Crown Prince (IV Corps) and Ignaz Gyulai (III Corps) were directed to attack Arcis while the Russian grenadiers attacked Torcy-le-Grand. Meanwhile, Pahlen and Nikolay Raevsky (VI Corps) also pressed forward. During this advance, the Allied cavalry claimed to have captured a French cavalry brigade, while Pahlen&#x27;s horsemen captured three cannons. By 4:00 pm, the Allies arrived near Arcis which they took under fire with 80 cannons. In the face of this bombardment, Sebastiani withdrew his surviving horsemen across the Villette bridge and broke it down.

Oudinot deployed François Maulmont&#x27;s brigade on the right and Jacques de Montfort&#x27;s brigade on the left, with David Hendrik Chassé&#x27;s brigade in reserve. At this time, Henri Rottembourg&#x27;s 5th Young Guard Division took up a position covering the north end of the Arcis bridge; it had escorted Oudinot&#x27;s train. The intense Allied bombardment caused Oudinot&#x27;s soldiers serious losses and threw the troops withdrawing across the bridge into confusion. The 10th Light Infantry Regiment drove back an initial attack on Arcis, but the Allies soon forced their way into Arcis in great strength and Leval was wounded. With the defense at the last gasp, Chassé rallied 100 soldiers by beating the charge on a drum. This allowed the last few troops to make their way onto the bridge and safety at 6:00 pm. Maulmont&#x27;s brigade destroyed the bridge after it crossed.

== Conclusion ==
That evening, Oudinot blocked the causeway on the north bank of the Aube with his troops. MacDonald reached nearby Ormes with two divisions at 9:00 pm, joining François Étienne de Kellermann&#x27;s cavalry corps. Étienne Maurice Gérard&#x27;s corps reached Plancy while the division of François Pierre Joseph Amey was farther west at Anglure. Luckily for the French, the Allies did not try to cross to the north bank and disrupt MacDonald&#x27;s strung out forces. The rest of Napoleon&#x27;s army was headed north to Sompuis. From there, the French emperor planned to follow his plan to march east to Saint-Dizier and operate against the Allied supply lines. All day on 22 March, MacDonald&#x27;s troops blocked the bridge at Arcis so that the Allies were completely unaware of Napoleon&#x27;s movements.

Chandler wrote that the battle cost the French 3,000 casualties and the Allies 4,000 casualties. Smith and Bodart stated that the French lost 3,400 killed and wounded plus three guns and 800 men captured. Allied losses were about 3,000. Nafziger agreed that the French suffered 4,200 casualties. He added that the Bavarian corps alone lost 224 officers and 2,000 rank and file casualties. The French fought extremely well. On the first day, the divisions of Janssens and Boyer and two battalions of the Old Guard, perhaps 7,000 men, had fought Wrede&#x27;s 22,000 soldiers to a standstill. On 25 March the Allies defeated Marmont and Mortier at the Battle of Fère-Champenoise. Napoleon won a useless victory at the Battle of Saint-Dizier the following day. The Battle of Paris was fought on 30 March and the Allies occupied the French capital the next day. Napoleon abdicated on 6 April 1814.

<doc id="157357" wikidata="Q793448" url="?curid=157357" title="Battle of Bergen (1799)">
<text>The Battle of Bergen was fought on 19 September 1799 and resulted in a Franco-Dutch victory under Generals Guillaume Brune and Herman Willem Daendels against the Russians and British under the Duke of York who had landed in North Holland. The battlefield is marked by the Russisch Monument (1902).

== Order of battle ==
The Duke of York landed on 15 September, and assumed the command of the army, which now amounted to about 30,000 men with 1,200 light cavalry. On 19 September the forces, under the Duke of York, formed in four columns, moved forward from Schagerbrug.

At this period the Allies possessed a superiority of force with which it was decided to strike a decisive blow as early as possible. The Dutch, numbering 12,000, were in a strong position around Langedijk, somewhat in advance of the French, who, by drawing in all detachments, had raised their field strength to 10,000 men, who were positioned in Alkmaar, Bergen, Schoorl, and Egmond aan Zee.

=== Anglo-Russian Forces ===
Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany



== Battle plan and terrain ==
The British and Russian commanders noticed that the Republicans had left their right uncovered, and a very strong position unoccupied. This would have been difficult to correct if the attack on that flank had been vigorously carried out. They had also left Amsterdam undefended on the only side by which it was accessible.

The plan of operations was as follows: The left column was to turn the enemy&#x27;s right, on the Zuiderzee; the right was to drive the enemy from the heights of Camperduin, and to seize Bergen; the right-centre had to force the position at Warmenhuizen and Schoorldam, and to cooperate with the right column; while the left-centre had to obtain possession of Oudkarspel, on the main road leading to Alkmaar.

The enemy&#x27;s left was advantageously posted on the high sand hills which extend from the sea, in front of Petten, to the town of Bergen. The ground over which the centre columns had to move was intersected every three or four hundred yards by broad, deep, wet ditches and canals. The bridges across the few roads leading to the points of attack were destroyed, and obstacles had been carefully arranged.

== Action ==

Contrary to all reasonable expectations, the force under Sir Ralph Abercromby took no direct part in this action; consequently the allied troops engaged amounted to no more than between 15,000 and 18,000 men. The corps under Sir Ralph Abercromby began their march on the evening of 18 September, but his advance was delayed by the bad state of the roads, and he arrived at Hoorn many hours later than was expected. The objectives that would have been gained by this column would have had a material effect on the result of the whole expedition, and could only be attempted while the Duke of York possessed the superior force.

The battle was commenced by Russian forces, which had by 8 am, September 19, obtained possession of Bergen. In vain did they expect support from their British allies, which had not even lined up for the battle, because the British and Russian commanders had neglected to synchronize their clocks. As a result, Russian forces were rapidly encircled by the French, Hermann was made prisoner and his second-in-command Jerepsoff killed, while their troops were forced back through Bergen to Schoorl, which they also had to abandon.

This village was retaken by Major-General Manners’ Brigade, which was then reinforced by two battalions of Russians, by Major-General D’Oyley&#x27;s Brigade of Guards, and by the 35th Regiment, under Prince William. The action was renewed by these troops, who in their turn repulsed the enemy; but a lack of ammunition and the exhausted state of the corps engaged in that part of the field obliged them to retire on Petten and the Zijpe Canal.

The column under Lieutenant-General Dundas attacked the village of Warmenhuizen at dawn, where the enemy, with a large force of artillery, was strongly positioned. Three battalions of Russians, under Major-General Sedmoratsky, moving from Krabbendam, gallantly stormed the left of the village, with the 1st Regiment of Guards entering it on the right at the same time. The Grenadier battalion of Guards, the 3rd Regiment of Guards and the 2nd battalion 5th Regiment which had been previously detached to march upon Schoorldam to keep up the communication with Sir James Pulteney, were joined by the remainder of the column, which, after taking Warmenhuizen, had been reinforced by the 1st battalion 5th Regiment, and the whole moved forward and seized the village. They held it under artillery fire until the conclusion of the action.
The left-centre column, though opposed by the bulk of the Batavian army, under General Daendels, had overcome all opposition and taken possession of Oudkarspel, thus securing the direct line of advance on Alkmaar. Sir Ralph Abercromby had equally well accomplished his task by capturing the town of Hoorn, on the coast of the Zuiderzee, and placing himself in a favourable position for completing the turning movement. However, in consequence of the partial failure on the right, it was considered necessary to recall all the troops and re-occupy the former position.

The strength of the column which attacked Bergen would have been more than sufficient if it had been employed correctly. This column was numerically superior to the enemy, but it moved in mass in an intersected country, did not cover its flanks, and its operations having, contrary to order, been commenced long before daylight, its fire was probably more destructive to itself than to the enemy. That the other columns were not too weak for their tasks is shown by their having taken and held, until recalled, the points against which they had been directed.

== Losses ==
The losses on both sides were considerable:

British: 6 officers, 2 sergeants, 109 rank-and-file killed; 43 officers, 20 sergeants, 2 drummers, 345 rank-and-file, wounded; 22 sergeants, 5 drummers, 463 rank-and-file, missing.&lt;br&gt;
Russians: 1,741 non-commissioned officers, rank-and-file, and 44 officers, killed or captured. 1,225, including 49 officers, wounded.&lt;br&gt;
Republicans: 3,000 prisoners, including 60 officers. 16 guns taken.

== Aftermath ==
The newly appointed Russian Commander-in-Chief, Mikhail Kutuzov, who was rushing from St. Petersburg to assume command of Russian forces, learned about the debacle at Hamburg and, deeming the campaign to be doomed, promptly returned to Russia.

The Republicans re-occupied all the positions from which they had been driven, and their general line of defence was now covered on the right by inundations, the only roads across which were covered by field works. The space between Alkmaar and the Zuiderzee was thus rendered defensible by small numbers, and Amsterdam was secured on the land side. The remainder of the army, which had been reinforced, was concentrated between the Langedijk and the sea, and the post of Oudkarspel was strengthened by additional works, and by inundations. Schoorldam and Koedijk were also fortified. The next major engagement took place at Castricum on 6 October.

<text>The Second Battle of Boulou (29 April to 1 May 1794) took place during the War of the Pyrenees, part of the French Revolutionary Wars. This battle saw the French Army of the Eastern Pyrenees led by General of Division (GD) Jacques François Dugommier attack the joint Spanish-Portuguese Army of Catalonia under Lieutenant General (LG) Luis Fermín de Carvajal, Conde de la Unión. Dugommier&#x27;s decisive victory resulted in the French regaining nearly all the land they lost to the Kingdom of Spain in 1793.

The town of Le Boulou is on the Tech River south of the department capital at Perpignan and north of the France–Spain border.

The spring of 1794 found the Spanish army holding a slice of French territory south of the Tech River and north of the Pyrenees. The Spanish right wing on the Mediterranean coast was separated from the center and left wing by a mountainous gap. First, Dugommier mounted a successful feint with his right wing that drew Spanish troops away from the center. Then, he launched powerful French forces into the gap. These forces circled behind the Spanish center and forced their adversaries to retreat across a difficult mountain pass. The Spanish suffered heavy losses of troops and abandoned their wagon trains and all their artillery.

==Background==
===1793===
The year 1793 was a difficult time for the poorly trained French forces defending Roussillon against the Spanish army of Captain General Antonio Ricardos. The Siege of Bellegarde concluded in June with the French surrender of the Fort de Bellegarde, which dominated the key Pass of Le Perthus through the Pyrenees. However, Ricardos was repelled in the Battle of Perpignan on 17 July. The French army revived again under GD Eustache Charles d&#x27;Aoust to deal their enemies a sharp reverse at the Battle of Peyrestortes on 17 September. Five days later, Ricardos defeated the French at the Battle of Truillas.

Subsequently, the Spanish general fell back to the valley of the Tech River where he repulsed a series of French attempts to drive him back into Spain. D&#x27;Aoust tried and failed to oust the Spanish from Le Boulou on 3 October. In the First Battle of Boulou (or Pla del Rey) from 13 to 15 October, Ricardos bloodily repulsed the attacks of GD Louis Marie Turreau. D&#x27;Aoust was defeated again on 7 December at the Battle of Villelongue. The Spanish seized Fort Saint-Elme through the treason of its commander and, in the Battle of Collioure, captured the port of Collioure on 20 December, wiping out 4,000 of its garrison of 5,000 men. Soon afterward, D&#x27;Aoust was arrested and eventually executed.

===New commanders===
Fresh from his victory at the Siege of Toulon, GD Jacques François Dugommier arrived to lead the army on 16 January 1794. He began a complete reorganization of the army, setting up supply depots, hospitals, and arsenals, and also improving roads. After getting reinforcements from the Toulon army, Dugommier&#x27;s field army numbered 28,000. These troops were supported by 20,000 garrison troops and 9,000 green volunteers. He formed his field army into three infantry divisions under GD Dominique Catherine de Pérignon, GD Pierre Augereau, and GD Pierre François Sauret. There was a 2,500-strong cavalry division led by GD André de La Barre and a reserve headed by General of Brigade (GB) Claude Perrin Victor.

During the winter, Ricardos travelled to Madrid to discuss the campaign. He died there on 13 March 1794, allegedly after having drunk a cup of poisoned chocolate intended for the king&#x27;s favorite Manuel Godoy. It is more probable that Ricardos died of pneumonia. Ricardos&#x27; designated successor, Captain General Alejandro O&#x27;Reilly died on 23 March of an intestinal illness before he could reach the front. In the interim, LG Jerónimo Girón-Moctezuma, Marquis de las Amarillas assumed leadership over the Army of Catalonia. But in late April, LG Luis Fermín de Carvajal, Conde de la Unión finally accepted command of the army. Dejected by the weakened state of the army, de la Unión had refused army command three times, saying what was needed was an angel and not a man.

==Battle==

===Baiting the trap===
De la Unión deployed his 20,000-strong army to hold the Tech valley, with defences both north and south of the river. LG Eugenio Navarro commanded the right flank division, whose positions included Collioure and Port-Vendres on the coast. The 8,300-man centre division of LG de las Amarillas held strongpoints at Le Boulou, Montesquieu-des-Albères and the Camp of Trompettes. LG Juan Miguel de Vives y Feliu with 5,500 soldiers of the left division defended Céret, where de la Unión installed his headquarters. LG John Forbes&#x27; Portuguese contingent deployed on the extreme left at Arles-sur-Tech and Amélie-les-Bains-Palalda.

Dugommier placed Augereau on his right flank with 6,400 infantry and 80 cavalry. Augereau&#x27;s right brigade occupied Taillet, his centre brigade Oms, and his left brigade Llauro. Sauret&#x27;s division of 7,300 infantry and 100 Hussars held the coastal sector on the left flank. Pérignon&#x27;s centre division represented the main French striking force with 8,500 infantry and 1,300 cavalry, backed by three reserve brigades totalling 7,000 men.

The French commander believed that the Spanish army&#x27;s centre of gravity was too far west and planned to exploit this weakness. He hoped to cross the Tech and roll up the right flank of the Spanish centre division. To make this task easier, he directed Augereau to demonstrate in front of Céret and lure the Spanish into drawing more troops to their left flank. Pérignon held his troops back from the river to hide the true French intentions. The main Spanish communications ran from Le Boulou through the Pass of Le Perthus at altitude near the Fort de Bellegarde. Dugommier wanted to force the Army of Catalonia into a retreat over the much more difficult Col du Porteille at altitude, which was to the southwest of Le Perthus. If he could achieve this, the Spanish might have to abandon their wagons, cannons, and supplies.

In late April, Augereau built a redoubt at the Saint Ferriol hermitage, north of Céret. De la Unión countered by constructing two redoubts of his own. On 27 April, Augereau probed the Spanish positions, then retired. The following day, Augereau captured one of the new Spanish redoubts, prompting the Spanish army commander to order 2,000 troops under the Prince of Montforte from his center to his left. On 29 April, de la Unión launched 3,000 troops, including cavalry led by General Pedro Mendinueta y Múzquiz, to attack Augereau on the north bank. Following his instructions, the French division commander fought a rear guard action, drawing the Spanish troops toward Oms. De la Unión finally called off the attack, but he left Mendinueta&#x27;s cavalry to observe Augereau.

That night, the Spanish generals held a council of war. De la Unión&#x27;s chief of staff General Tomàs Morla saw through Augereau&#x27;s actions and proposed that Navarro&#x27;s division attack on the right while de Vives and de las Amarillas joined forces and attacked the French centre near Le Boulou. The council voted to adopt this action, which would secure the supply road from Le Boulou to Bellegarde. As a precaution, the council decided to withdraw the army&#x27;s trains by the road to Bellegarde. However, they decided there was plenty of time to issue orders the next morning, rather than that evening.

===French attack===
In the early hours of 30 April, Pérignon&#x27;s division crossed the Tech at the Brouilla ford, planning to climb the mountains behind the Spanish camps in order to take the defences in the rear. Martin&#x27;s left flank brigade marched past Saint-Génis-des-Fontaines and began ascending Saint Christopher Peak. His men reached the hermitage where they emplaced six cannon and 13 howitzers to fire on the Spanish positions from the rear. Then part of his brigade advanced west to cut the road to Bellegarde. Chabert&#x27;s brigade advanced on Villelongue-dels-Monts while Point&#x27;s right flank brigade began attacking the fortified camp at Montesquieu-des-Albères, defended by Colonel Francisco Javier Venegas. La Barre supported Point&#x27;s troops, while Victor with a reserve brigade occupied Saint-Génis to keep Navarro&#x27;s division sending help to the Spanish center. Two more reserve brigades under Lemoine attacked Trompettes. While these battles were being fought in the centre, Augereau retook Oms from Mendinueta on the French right flank and Sauret captured Argelès-sur-Mer from Navarro on the left. In order to give an impression of French superiority, Dugommier arrayed a large body of poorly trained volunteers near his headquarters at Banyuls-dels-Aspres.
De la Unión sent General Montforte with 2,800 infantry and 800 cavalry to reinforce the Camp of Trompettes and General Del Puerto with 2,000 more to help Venegas. But neither of these forces were able to halt the concentrated French offensive.

On 1 May, seeing his defences fatally compromised, de la Unión made preparations to retreat. Montforte abandoned Trompettes and withdrew to the south bank across a ford near Le Boulou. That day, the French assault overran the camp at Montesquieu-des-Albères and the Spanish retreated, taking the badly wounded Venegas with them. La Barre sent Quesnel with some cavalry along the south bank to cut off the Spanish retreat, but this effort failed. On the western flank, Augereau sent troops under brigade commanders Guieu and Mirabel to push Mendinueta&#x27;s cavalry back to Céret.

Chased by Quesnel&#x27;s cavalry, Montforte retreated south on the road to Bellegarde. But at Les Cluses he ran into an ambush set by Martin&#x27;s brigade. In a scene of chaos, a part of the Spanish wagon and artillery trains were wrecked or abandoned. The bulk of the Spanish army headed for Maureillas-las-Illas before climbing the steep road to the Col du Porteille. After covering the withdrawal at Céret, de Vives pulled out of the town and Augereau crossed the bridge to harass the Spanish retreat. The Portuguese division withdrew across a pass farther west.

==Results==
The Spanish army suffered 2,000 killed and wounded. An additional 1,500 soldiers, 140 guns, and all of the army trains and baggage fell into French hands. French losses were given as 20 killed. The number of wounded is not given. Historian Digby Smith stated, &quot;The Spanish army never recovered from this setback&quot;. After Boulou, the only Spanish forts on French soil were Collioure and Bellegarde. The French captured the first on 26 May while Bellegarde held out until 17 September 1794.

<text>The Battle of Brienne (29 January 1814) saw an Imperial French army led by Emperor Napoleon attack Prussian and Russian forces commanded by Prussian Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher. After heavy fighting that went on into the night, the French seized a château, nearly capturing Blücher. However, the French were unable to dislodge the Russians from the town of Brienne-le-Château. Napoleon himself, making his first appearance on a battlefield in 1814, was also nearly captured. Very early the next morning, Blücher&#x27;s troops quietly abandoned the town and retreated to the south, conceding the field to the French.

In late December 1813, two Allied armies initially numbering 300,000 men smashed through France&#x27;s weak defenses and moved west. By late January, Napoleon personally took the field to lead his armies. The French emperor hoped to cripple Blücher&#x27;s army before it could combine with the main Allied army under Austrian field marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg. Napoleon&#x27;s gamble failed, and Blücher escaped to join Schwarzenberg. Three days later, the two Allied armies combined their 120,000 men and attacked Napoleon in the Battle of La Rothière.

==Prelude==
===Plans===
In November 1813, the 70,000 French survivors of the disastrous German Campaign of 1813 crossed to the west bank of the Rhine River. Emperor Napoleon left 100,000 French soldiers in German garrisons, trapped by enemy blockading forces and hostile populations. All of Napoleon&#x27;s German allies switched sides and joined the Sixth Coalition. To the south, Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult&#x27;s 60,000 men and Marshal Louis Gabriel Suchet&#x27;s 37,000 defended the Spanish border. Napoleon&#x27;s step-son Eugène de Beauharnais with 50,000 troops defended the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy against the Austrian Empire. There were numerous French garrisons in Belgium, the Netherlands and eastern France, while 15,000 soldiers were isolated in Mainz.

Czar Alexander I of Russia and King Frederick William III of Prussia wished to dethrone Napoleon, but Emperor Francis I of Austria was not anxious to overthrow his son-in-law. Francis also feared that weakening France would strengthen his rivals, Russia and Prussia. Prince Schwarzenberg followed his emperor&#x27;s wait-and-see policy, while Blücher yearned to crush Napoleon at the earliest opportunity. Jean Baptiste Jules Bernadotte, the crown prince of Sweden and a former French marshal, led a third Allied army. He secretly wished to replace Napoleon as the leader of France and was not inclined to invade his former homeland. The Allied leaders met at Frankfurt-am-Main to work out a plan to fight Napoleon.

In the Allied plan that emerged, Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Bülow would advance with one of Bernadotte&#x27;s corps into the Netherlands and be joined there by a British corps under Thomas Graham, 1st Baron Lynedoch. Blücher would cross the middle Rhine with 100,000 troops and occupy Napoleon&#x27;s attention. Meanwhile, Schwarzenberg would cross the upper Rhine near Basel with 200,000 men and move toward Langres, falling on the French right flank.

To oppose this vast array, Napoleon deployed Marshal Claude Perrin Victor with 10,000 troops on the upper Rhine, Marshal Auguste de Marmont with 13,000 and Horace Sebastiani with 4,500 on the middle Rhine and Marshal Jacques MacDonald with 11,500 on the lower Rhine. Holland and Belgium were held by 15,000 troops led by Nicolas Joseph Maison. In reserve were the Old Guard under Marshal Édouard Mortier and two newly formed Young Guard divisions under Marshal Michel Ney. Well to the south at Lyon, Marshal Pierre Augereau was directed to form a new army.

===Operations===
On 22 December 1813, elements of Schwarzenberg&#x27;s army crossed the upper Rhine and moved into France and Switzerland. Blücher crossed the middle Rhine on 29 December. Napoleon&#x27;s cordon defense quickly collapsed in the face of these two Allied armies. Victor soon abandoned Nancy and on 13 January 1814 Marmont retreated to Metz. By 17 January, Marmont, Ney and Victor withdrew behind the Meuse River. Blücher&#x27;s army advanced in nine days and crossed the Meuse on 22 January. Schwarzenberg reached Langres on 17 January, where the cautious Austrian halted for a few days, convinced that Napoleon was about to attack him with 80,000 troops. When Schwarzenberg moved forward again, Mortier&#x27;s Imperial Guard slowed his advance by carrying out skillful rearguard actions. The First Battle of Bar-sur-Aube was fought on 24 January between Mortier&#x27;s guardsmen and two of Schwarzenberg&#x27;s corps.

At first, Napoleon grossly underestimated Allied numbers, crediting Schwarzenberg with 50,000 troops and Blücher with 30,000. By the end of January, he formed a more realistic estimate and resolved to prevent the armies of Blücher and Schwarzenberg from joining. In fact, the combined Allied armies would number 120,000 soldiers for the Battle of La Rothière on 1 February. On that date, the two Coalition armies brought 85,000 men and 200 guns into action against Napoleon, who could only oppose them with 45,100 soldiers and 128 guns.

Leaving his brother Joseph Bonaparte in charge of the capital, Napoleon departed from Paris and reached Châlons-sur-Marne on 26 January 1814. Near Châlons were the following forces. Victor led 14,747 men from the II Corps and Édouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud&#x27;s V Cavalry Corps. Marmont headed 12,051 troops from the VI Corps and Jean-Pierre Doumerc&#x27;s I Cavalry Corps. Ney directed 14,505 soldiers in three Young Guard infantry divisions under Claude Marie Meunier, Pierre Decouz and Henri Rottembourg and a Guard cavalry division under Charles Lefebvre-Desnouettes. MacDonald and Sebastiani were approaching from the north with about 10,000 men but were too distant to be available. Mortier with 20,000 soldiers, including 12,000 Imperial Guards, retreated west to Troyes after his clash with Schwarzenberg&#x27;s army.

Napoleon directed that his presence at the front should be kept a secret. He issued four days&#x27; rations to his army and marched it from Châlons toward Saint-Dizier, where he believed Blücher was located with about 25,000 soldiers and 40 guns. When his army reached Saint-Dizier, he found that his adversary had marched southwest to Brienne-le-Château. In a clash at Saint-Dizier on 27 January 1814, Milhaud&#x27;s 2,100 cavalrymen drove back 1,500 Russians of Sergey Nikolaevich Lanskoy&#x27;s 2nd Hussar Division. At Brienne, Blücher would be near parts of Schwarzenberg&#x27;s army and Napoleon hoped to drive the Prussian field marshal&#x27;s forces into the Aube River before he could be reinforced. Napoleon was familiar with Brienne; he had entered the Royal School of Brienne at the age of nine on 23 April 1779 and studied there for five and a half years.

On 28 January, Napoleon advanced toward Brienne in three columns. Étienne Maurice Gérard&#x27;s right column marched south from Vitry-le-François and included the infantry divisions of Étienne Pierre Sylvestre Ricard (of VI Corps) and Georges Joseph Dufour plus Cyrille Simon Picquet&#x27;s cavalry. The center column was made up of the Imperial Guard and marched southwest from Saint-Dizier through Montier-en-Der. The left column, consisting of Victor and Milhaud, marched south to Wassy before turning west to join the center column at Montier-en-Der. Marmont was left with Joseph Lagrange&#x27;s infantry division and the I Cavalry Corps near Bar-le-Duc to hold off Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg&#x27;s Prussian I Corps. Napoleon sent messages to Mortier at Troyes, Étienne Tardif de Pommeroux de Bordesoulle at Arcis-sur-Aube and Pierre David de Colbert-Chabanais at Nogent-sur-Seine to cooperate with his plan. Russian Cossacks captured all three couriers and delivered their dispatches to Blücher. By the morning of 29 January, the Prussian field marshal was aware that Napoleon had gotten between him and Yorck and was approaching him from the northeast with 30,000–40,000 soldiers.

The roads were in poor condition because of a thaw, but Napoleon&#x27;s soldiers managed to slog through the mud to reach Montier-en-Der and Wassy by nightfall on 28 January. Blücher was in Brienne with Zakhar Dmitrievich Olsufiev&#x27;s infantry corps while Fabian Gottlieb von Osten-Sacken&#x27;s Russian army corps was farther west at Lesmont. The Allied VI Corps under Peter Wittgenstein was approaching Joinville but its cavalry under Peter Petrovich Pahlen reached Brienne. Schwarzenberg&#x27;s headquarters was located at Chaumont. The Allied V Corps under Karl Philipp von Wrede was between Chaumont and Saint-Dizier. The Allied III Corps under Ignaz Gyulai and the IV Corps under Crownprince Frederick William of Württemberg were near Bar-sur-Aube. The Allied I Corps under Hieronymus Karl Graf von Colloredo-Mansfeld was well to the south at Châtillon-sur-Seine and the Reserve under Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly was marching from Langres to Chaumont.

==Battle==
Warned just in time of the impending French attack, Blücher recalled Sacken from Lesmont to Brienne. The Prussian field marshal had Olsufiev&#x27;s 6,000 infantry, Pahlen&#x27;s 3,000 cavalry and Lanskoy&#x27;s 1,600 hussars on hand until Sacken arrived. Olsufiev&#x27;s command was part of Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron&#x27;s Russian army corps. Blücher posted Olsufiev in Brienne, Pahlen in the plain to the northeast and Lanskoy near the Bois d&#x27;Ajou (Ajou Woods). The 9th Light Cavalry Division under Hippolyte Piré at the point of the French advance met three Cossack regiments under Nikolay Grigoryevich Scherbatov at Maizières-lès-Brienne. Scherbatov also directed the 4th and 34th Jäger Regiments which were detached from the Russian 4th Division in the Allied VI Corps. Piré was soon joined by the remainder of the V Cavalry Corps under the overall command of Emmanuel de Grouchy. The French horsemen pressed back Scherbatov and Pahlen after some skirmishing. Lefebvre-Desnouettes was wounded during the cavalry action.

By 3:00 pm Pahlen retreated through Brienne and reformed his horsemen on the Russian right flank. The French pursuit by the divisions of Samuel-François Lhéritier and André Briche stopped when it encountered three battalions of the 4th and 34th Jägers deployed in square formation. Sacken&#x27;s troops began arriving at Brienne at this time and he sent his cavalry under Ilarion Vasilievich Vasilshikov to the right flank. Napoleon called a halt until 3:30 pm when Guillaume Philibert Duhesme&#x27;s II Corps infantry division reached the field. Then the French emperor ordered a general attack. For an hour the soldiers of Duhesme and Olsufiev fought to a stalemate. Between 4:00 and 5:00 pm Decouz&#x27;s division of Ney&#x27;s corps reached the battlefield and was put in on Duhesme&#x27;s right flank. At first Decouz&#x27;s men were successful in forcing their way deeper into the town. However, Ney called a halt when trouble developed elsewhere on the field.

Noticing that Duhesme&#x27;s division was not supported by cavalry, Blücher hurled 40 cavalry squadrons under Pahlen and Vasilshikov at the French left flank. The Russian horsemen routed Duhesme&#x27;s division and captured eight artillery pieces. In the confusion, a group of Cossacks nearly captured Napoleon, but right afterward the unruffled French emperor rallied his shaken soldiers and led them back into action. Nightfall prevented a worse disaster to Duhesme, which came about because the French cavalry was all deployed on the right flank. By this time, Sacken&#x27;s troops were all on the field but his wagon train was still lumbering past Brienne. Blücher and his chief of staff, August Neidhardt von Gneisenau, thinking that the day&#x27;s fighting was ended, went to the château. They were nearly made prisoners when some of Victor&#x27;s infantry led by Louis Huguet-Chateau slipped up to the château by an unguarded road and seized the place. This coup was carried out by 400 soldiers of the 37th and 56th Line Infantry Regiments. Huguet-Chateau&#x27;s men also captured four guns but lost them to a Russian counterattack.

Napoleon ordered the divisions of Decouz and Meunier, supported by Lefebvre-Desnouettes&#x27; cavalry, to storm Brienne. The assault was completely unsuccessful; Decouz was mortally wounded and one of his brigadiers, Rear Admiral Pierre Baste, was killed outright. Another brigadier, Jean-Jacques Germain Pelet-Clozeau took temporary command of Decouz&#x27;s division. To keep Sacken&#x27;s trains from capture, Blücher ordered Sacken to clear the French from Brienne and Olsufiev to retake the château. After bitter fighting, Sacken drove the French from most of the town, but Olsufiev failed to recapture the château. Finally, Grouchy sent Lhéritier&#x27;s horsemen into the town but this gallant effort was futile. At midnight, Blücher ordered Olsufiev&#x27;s troops to retreat and two hours later gave Sacken instructions to withdraw. The Russian cavalry held their positions until morning. The French did not initially notice the Russian withdrawal and finally occupied Brienne at 4:00 am.

==Result==
Historian Francis Loraine Petre stated that both sides suffered about 3,000 casualties. He called the action &quot;scarcely a tactical victory for Napoleon&quot; and noted that the French were unable to keep Blücher from joining Schwarzenberg. Gaston Bodart asserted that the French had 36,000 men engaged against 30,000 Allies and that each side sustained 3,000 casualties. David G. Chandler reported that the French lost 3,000 and the Allies 4,000 casualties, but that the battle was &quot;inconclusive&quot;. Nikolay Orlov also claims that the battle was indecisive. Digby Smith asserted that Napoleon had 36,000 troops while the Allies had 28,000. The French lost 3,500 casualties and 11 guns and the Allies sustained 3,000 casualties. François Louis Forestier, commanding Victor&#x27;s 2nd Division, lost his life. Forestier died of his wounds on 5 February. Decouz succumbed to his wounds on 18 February. George Nafziger wrote that the French lost eight guns but found the Russian claim to capturing three additional guns doubtful. Nafziger gave combined casualties as 6,000 without specifying how many were lost on each side.

<text>The Battle of Gamonal (also known, in Spanish, as the Battle of Burgos) was fought on 10 November 1808, during the Peninsular War in the village of near Burgos, Spain. A French army under Soult overwhelmed the outnumbered Spanish troops under General Belvedere, opening central Spain, including Madrid, to invasion.

==Background==
Napoleon, staying for four days at Vitoria on his way down to Madrid, had been waiting, among other things, for the news that Bessières had occupied Burgos. Bessières himself, already aware that he was to be superseded by Soult, had not yet advanced on that city. Although his forces numbered some 70,000 men, of which nearly 20,000 were veteran cavalry from Germany, only the 18,000 bayonets and 6,500 sabres of his 2nd Corps and the cavalry of Milhaud and Franceschi were on the front line.

Facing them at Burgos were its garrison of 1,600 men, and four guns. However, on 7 November, Conde de Belvedere arrived from Madrid with his 1st Division (4,000 foot and 400 horse with twelve guns) of the army of Estremadura, and the following day they were joined by the 2nd Division of the same army, with about 3,000 infantry and two regiments of hussars. On the 10th, therefore, when Soult attacked, Belvedere—who took the command as the senior general present—had about 8,600 bayonets, 1,100 sabres, and sixteen guns under his orders.

==Battle==
The French attacked the Spanish positions before Burgos with a ratio 2:1. The two divisions of the Army of Extremadura were arrayed on the open plain at Gamonal and, broken by a massive cavalry charge, fled in panic, leaving the invaders to sack Burgos.

According to Oman (Oman, 1902), if Belvedere had attempted a stand at Burgos, he would have been able to take advantage of that city&#x27;s ancient fortifications, as well as the broken ground around it: &quot;But with the most cheerful disregard of common military precautions, the Count marched out of Burgos, advanced a few miles, and drew up his army across the high-road in front of the village of Gamonal. He was in an open plain, his right flank ill covered by the river Arlanzon, which was fordable in many places, his left completely &#x27;in the air&#x27;, near the village of Vellimar&quot;.

In front of the line was a large wood, which the road bisects and which gave the French troops ideal cover for hiding their movements until the last moment. Belvedere had stationed his two batteries on the centre, with six battalions in the first line, and with a cavalry regiment on each flank. The second line was formed of four battalions; two more battalions, the four guns, and his third cavalry regiment were coming up from the rear, but had not yet taken their post in the second line when the short and sudden battle was fought and lost.

Soult arrived with Lasalle&#x27;s light-cavalry division deployed in his front, followed by Milhaud&#x27;s dragoons and three infantry divisions of the 2nd Corps—Mouton in front, then Merle, with Bonnet bringing up the rear.

Milhaud&#x27;s division of dragoons rode southward and formed up on the banks of the river, facing the Spanish right, while Lasalle&#x27;s four regiments of light cavalry composed the French centre. Mouton&#x27;s twelve battalions deployed on the left and advanced through the wood, preceded by tirailleurs.

The seven regiments of cavalry which formed the left and centre of the French army delivered a devastating charge at the Spanish infantry in the plain and the regiment of Spanish hussars covering their flank was &quot;swept away like chaff before the wind&quot;. The infantry were still in line and did not have time to form squares before 5,000 horsemen swept over them, riding over five battalions, taking all their colours, killing half of them or taking them prisoner. The remnant fled towards Burgos, with Milhaud&#x27;s dragoons in pursuit, while Lasalle&#x27;s chasseurs fell upon the surviving half of Belvedere&#x27;s army. At the same moment Mouton&#x27;s infantry attacked them from the front. The result was a complete rout and all sixteen Spanish guns were captured, including those of the second line that had not even been unlimbered, let alone fired a single shot.

Although Belvedere himself made two attempts to rally his troops, one at the bridge, and the other outside the city itself, he was unable to stop them fleeing.

The only troops that held their line were, to the south, the 4th Battalion of the Walloon Guard, under Colonel Vicente Genaro de Quesada, and to the north, Lieutenant-colonel Juan Díaz Porlier&#x27;s 1st Regiment of Provincial Grenadiers, which managed to withstand the onslaught and retreat in order.

==Aftermath==
On entering the city of Burgos, the French army celebrated their victory by sacking it and even the house next to that in which Napoleon had taken up his quarters for the night was pillaged and set on fire, so that he had to shift into another street.

Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Spain proceeded with the Battle of Espinosa de los Monteros.

The Spanish defeats at Gamonal and Espinosa de los Monteros led to the dispersion of some 20,000 regular troops throughout Cantabria, Castilla-León, Navarra, País Vasco and Rioja, many of whom would form guerrilla bands to fight against the French.

This was, specifically, the case of Juan Díaz Porlier who, with his regular troops, would be active in the north of the country and whose division of 6,450 troops, made up of five infantry regiments and one of hussars, would, by early 1811, form the vanguard of the 33,230-strong 7th Army, which brought together five divisions of guerillas (Díaz Porlier&#x27;s Cantabrian Division, Longa&#x27;s Iberian Division, Renovales&#x27;s Basque Division, Espoz y Mina&#x27;s Navarran Division and Merino&#x27;s Castilian Division.

<text>The Battle of Brandywine, also known as the Battle of Brandywine Creek, was fought between the American Continental Army of General George Washington and the British Army of General Sir William Howe on September 11, 1777, as part of the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). The forces met near Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania. More troops fought at Brandywine than at any other battle of the American Revolution. It was also the second longest single-day battle of the war, after the Battle of Monmouth, with continuous fighting for 11 hours.

As Howe moved to take Philadelphia, then the American capital, the British forces routed the Continental Army and forced them to withdraw, first, to the City of Chester, Pennsylvania, and then northeast toward Philadelphia.

Howe&#x27;s army departed from Sandy Hook, New Jersey, across New York Bay from the occupied town of New York City on the southern tip of Manhattan Island, on July 23, 1777, and landed near present-day Elkton, Maryland, at the point of the &quot;Head of Elk&quot; by the Elk River at the northern end of the Chesapeake Bay, at the southern mouth of the Susquehanna River. Marching north, the British Army brushed aside American light forces in a few skirmishes. General Washington offered battle with his army posted behind Brandywine Creek, off the Christina River. While part of his army demonstrated in front of Chadds Ford, Howe took the bulk of his troops on a long march that crossed the Brandywine far beyond Washington&#x27;s right flank. Due to poor scouting, the Americans did not detect Howe&#x27;s column until it reached a position in rear of their right flank. Belatedly, three divisions were shifted to block the British flanking force at Birmingham Friends Meetinghouse and School, a Quaker meeting house.

After a stiff fight, Howe&#x27;s wing broke through the newly formed American right wing, which was deployed on several hills. At this point Lieutenant General Wilhelm von Knyphausen attacked Chadds Ford and crumpled the American left wing. As Washington&#x27;s army streamed away in retreat, he brought up elements of General Nathanael Greene&#x27;s division, which held off Howe&#x27;s column long enough for his army to escape to the northeast. Polish General Casimir Pulaski defended Washington&#x27;s rear, assisting in his escape. The defeat and subsequent maneuvers left Philadelphia vulnerable. The British captured it two weeks later on September 26, resulting in the city falling under British control for nine months, until June 1778.

In late August 1777, after a distressing 34-day journey from Sandy Hook on the coast of New Jersey, a Royal Navy fleet of more than 260 ships carrying some 17,000 British troops under the command of British General Sir William Howe landed at the head of the Elk River, on the northern end of the Chesapeake Bay near present-day Elkton, Maryland (then known as Head of Elk), approximately 40–50 miles (60–80 km) southwest of Philadelphia. Unloading the ships proved to be a logistical problem because the narrow river neck was shallow and muddy.

General George Washington had placed the American forces, about 20,300-strong, between Head of Elk and Philadelphia. His forces were able to reconnoiter the British landing from Iron Hill near Newark, Delaware, about 9 miles (14 km) to the northeast. Because of the delay disembarking from the ships, Howe did not set up a typical camp but quickly moved forward with the troops. As a result, Washington was not able to accurately gauge the strength of the opposing forces.

After a skirmish at Cooch&#x27;s Bridge south of Newark, the British troops moved north and Washington abandoned a defensive encampment along the Red Clay Creek near Newport, Delaware, to deploy against the British at Chadds Ford. This site was important as it was the most direct passage across the Brandywine River on the road from Baltimore to Philadelphia. On September 9, Washington positioned detachments to guard other fords above and below Chadds Ford, hoping to force the battle there. Washington employed General John Armstrong, commanding about 1,000 Pennsylvania militia, to cover Pyle&#x27;s Ford, 5.8 miles south of Chadds Ford, which was covered by Major Generals Anthony Wayne&#x27;s and Nathanael Greene&#x27;s divisions. Major General John Sullivan&#x27;s division extended northward along the Brandywine&#x27;s east banks, covering the high ground north of Chadds Ford along with Major General Adam Stephen&#x27;s division and Major General Lord Stirling&#x27;s divisions. Further upstream was a brigade under Colonel Moses Hazen covering Buffington&#x27;s Ford and Wistar&#x27;s Ford. Washington was confident that the area was secure.

The British grouped forces at nearby Kennett Square. Howe, who had better information about the area than Washington, had no intention of mounting a full-scale frontal attack against the prepared American defenses. He instead employed a flanking maneuver, similar to that used in the Battle of Long Island. About 6,800 men under the command of Wilhelm von Knyphausen advanced to meet Washington&#x27;s troops at Chadds Ford. The remainder of Howe&#x27;s troops, about 9,000 men, under the command of Charles, Lord Cornwallis, marched north to Trimble&#x27;s Ford across the West Branch of the Brandywine Creek, then east to Jefferis Ford across the East Branch (two fords that Washington had overlooked as a result of a poor understanding of the area and lack of credible reconnaissance), and then south to flank the American forces.

==Battle==
===British advance===

September 11 began with a heavy fog, which provided cover for the British troops. Washington received contradictory reports about the British troop movements and continued to believe that the main force was moving to attack at Chadds Ford.

Knyphausen&#x27;s Column

At 5:30 a.m. the British and Hessian troops began marching east along the &quot;Great Road&quot; (now Route 1) from Kennett Square, advancing on the American troops positioned where the road crossed Brandywine Creek. The first shots of the battle took place about 4 miles west of Chadds Ford, at Welch&#x27;s Tavern. Elements of Maxwell&#x27;s continental light infantry skirmished with the British vanguard (primarily the Queen&#x27;s Rangers – a battalion of loyalists). The British continued to advance and encountered a greater force of continentals behind the stone walls on the Old Kennett Meetinghouse grounds. The battle was fought at mid-morning around the meeting house while the pacifist Quakers continued to hold their midweek service. One of the Quakers later wrote, &quot;While there was much noise and confusion without, all was quiet and peaceful within.&quot;

From the Meetinghouse grounds, the battle continued for three miles to the Brandywine Creek, at Chadds Ford. Eventually the British pushed the Americans back but not before suffering heavy losses.

Cornwallis&#x27;s Column

The main British column under General Cornwallis (and accompanied by General Howe) set out from Kennett Square at 5:00 a.m.. Local loyalist sources had provided Howe with knowledge of two unguarded fords, above the forks of the Brandywine. The 17-mile flank march took approximately 9 hours to complete. The British appeared on the Americans&#x27; right flank at around 2 p.m. and took a much-needed rest on Osbourne&#x27;s Hill, a commanding position north of the Continental army. Having received intelligence from Colonel Bland&#x27;s scouts, Washington ordered Sullivan to take overall command of Stirling and Stephen&#x27;s divisions (in addition to his own) and quickly march north to meet the British flank attack. As they were forming their lines north of Dilworth, Howe launched his attack. Having taken overall command of the right wing of the army, Sullivan left his division to confer with the other generals. His own division he left under the command of Preudhomme de Borre, with orders to shift to the right in order to link up with Stirling and Stephen&#x27;s divisions (from left to right the divisions were arranged as Sullivan, Stirling, Stephen). As the British lines advanced, the Hessian Jaegers threatened to flank the American right forcing Stephen and Stirling to shift right. Howe was slow to attack, which bought time for the Americans to position some of their men on high ground near Birmingham Meetinghouse, about a mile (1.6 km) north of Chadds Ford. By 4 p.m., the British attacked. The British Brigade of Guards caught de Borre by surprise on the American left, before de Borre had time to fully form, and immediately sent them in to disarray, causing the entire division to rout. Initially, Stephen&#x27;s and Stirling&#x27;s divisions held firm, aided by a battery of artillery on a knoll between their divisions. However, the British light infantry battalions, aided by the Jaegers, eventually caused Stephen&#x27;s division to fall back. A bayonet charge by the British grenadier battalions, in the center, similarly forced Stirling to retreat. The Marquis de Lafayette had only just arrived, joining Stirling&#x27;s division, when he received a wound while trying to rally the retreating troops.

===Washington and Greene arrive near Dilworth===
Around 6 p.m., Washington and Greene arrived with reinforcements to try to hold off the British, who now occupied Meeting House Hill. Washington conferred with Greene and Knox, the latter of whom was head of artillery, in the yard of the William Brinton house. The 2nd Battalion of Grenadiers was nearing their position, and was joined by a fresh reserve brigade (the 4th British Brigade). It was determined that Knox would deploy artillery to slow the British advance. Greene&#x27;s reinforcements, combined with the remnants of Sullivan&#x27;s, Stephen&#x27;s, and Stirling&#x27;s divisions, formed south of Dilworth and stopped the pursuing British for nearly an hour, letting the rest of the army retreat. When darkness fell, Greene&#x27;s division finally began the march to Chester along with the rest of the army. The British army was not able to pursue due to the onset of night. The Americans were also forced to leave behind many of their cannons on Meeting House Hill because almost all of their artillery horses were killed.

====Knyphausen&#x27;s final attack====

Upon hearing the attack of Cornwallis&#x27;s column, Knyphausen launched an attack against the weakened American center across Chadds Ford, breaking through the divisions commanded by Wayne and William Maxwell and forcing them to retreat and leave behind most of their cannons. Armstrong&#x27;s militia, never engaged in the fighting, also decided to retreat from their positions. Further north, Greene sent Brigadier General George Weedon&#x27;s troops to cover the road just outside the town of Dilworth to hold off the British long enough for the rest of the Continental Army to retreat. Darkness brought the British pursuit to a standstill, which then allowed Weedon&#x27;s force to retreat. The defeated Americans retreated to Chester where most of them arrived at midnight, with stragglers arriving until morning. The American retreat was well organized, largely because of the efforts of Lafayette, who, although wounded, created a rally point that allowed for a more orderly retreat before being treated for his wound.

==Losses==
The official British casualty list detailed 587 casualties: 93 killed (eight officers, seven sergeants and 78 rank and file); 488 wounded (49 officers, 40 sergeants, four drummers and 395 rank and file); and six rank and file missing unaccounted for. Only 40 of the British Army&#x27;s casualties were Hessians. Historian Thomas J. McGuire writes that, &quot;American estimates of British losses run as high as 2,000, based on distant observation and sketchy, unreliable reports&quot;.

Most accounts of the American loss were from the British. One initial report by a British officer recorded American casualties at over 200 killed, around 750 wounded, and 400 prisoners were taken, many of them wounded. A member of General Howe&#x27;s staff claimed that 400 rebels were buried on the field by the victors. Another British officer wrote that, &quot;The Enemy had 502 dead in the field&quot;. General Howe&#x27;s report to the British colonial secretary, Lord George Germain, said that the Americans, &quot;had about 300 men killed, 600 wounded, and near 400 made prisoners&quot;.

No casualty return for the American army at Brandywine survives and no figures, official or otherwise, were ever released. The nearest thing to a hard figure from the American side was by Major General Nathanael Greene, who estimated that Washington&#x27;s army had lost between 1,200 and 1,300 men. On September 14, about 350 wounded Americans were taken from the British camp at Dilworth to a newly established hospital at Wilmington, Delaware. This would suggest that of the &quot;near 400&quot; prisoners reported by Howe, only about 50 had surrendered unwounded. If General Greene&#x27;s estimate of the total American loss was accurate, then they had between 1,160 and 1,260 killed, wounded or deserted during the battle. The British also captured 11 out of 14 of the American artillery pieces. Among the American wounded was the Marquis de Lafayette.

In addition to losses in battle, 315 men were posted as deserters from Washington&#x27;s camp during this stage of the campaign.

==Aftermath==
Washington had committed a serious error in leaving his right flank wide open and could have brought about his army&#x27;s annihilation had it not been for Sullivan, Stirling and Stephen&#x27;s divisions, which bought them time. Evening was approaching and, in spite of the early start Cornwallis had made in the flanking maneuver, most of the American army was able to escape. In his report to the Continental Congress detailing the battle, Washington stated: &quot;despite the day&#x27;s misfortune, I am pleased to announce that most of my men are in good spirits and still have the courage to fight the enemy another day.&quot;

British and American forces maneuvered around each other for the next several days with only a few encounters such as the Battle of the Clouds on September 16 and the Battle of Paoli on the night of September 20–21. In a matter of days, the Battles of Saratoga, hundreds of miles to the north, provided a victory over a British force which Howe was supposed to join.

In preparation for the fall of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania&#x27;s Supreme Executive Council ordered that eleven bells in the city, including the State House bell (known today as the Liberty Bell) and the bells from Christ Church and St. Peter&#x27;s Church, be taken down and removed from Philadelphia to prevent the British Army from taking possession of them and melting them down to cast into munitions for use in the war. The Liberty Bell was transported to Allentown, where it was hidden for nine months under floor boards at Zion United Church of Christ in the city.

The Continental Congress then abandoned Philadelphia, moving first to Lancaster, for one day and then to York.

On September 26, 1777, British forces marched into Philadelphia unopposed.

Eight Army National Guard units (103rd Eng Bn, A/1-104th Cav, 109th FA, 111th Inf, 113th Inf, 116th Inf, 1–175th Inf and 198th Sig Bn) and one active Regular Army Field Artillery battalion (1–5th FA) are derived from American units that participated in the Battle of Brandywine. There are thirty current U.S. Army units with lineages that go back to the colonial era.

==Battlefield preservation==

<text>In the Battle of [[Bautzen]] (20–21 May 1813), a combined Prusso-Russian army, retreating after their defeat at Lützen and massively outnumbered, was pushed back by Napoleon but escaped destruction. Some sources claim that Marshal Michel Ney failed to block their retreat. The Prussians were led by General Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, and the Russians by General Peter Wittgenstein.

==Prelude==
The Prusso-Russian army was in a full retreat following their defeat at the Battle of Lützen. Finally, generals Wittgenstein and Blücher were ordered to stop at Bautzen by Tsar Alexander I and King Frederick William III. The Russo-Prussian army was nearly 96,000 strong, but Napoleon had 144,000. Wittgenstein formed two strong defensive lines east of the River Spree, with the first holding strongpoints in villages and along hills and the second holding the bridges behind a river bend. Their left flank was anchored by the town of Bautzen and their right by a number of lakes.

Napoleon had planned to pin down his enemies to their lines on the first day and then trap them with Marshal Michel Ney&#x27;s troops the following day when they arrived. However, due to faulty reconnaissance, he became concerned that the Prusso-Russians had more soldiers and held stronger positions than they actually did. So Napoleon then decided he would not set up his trap until they had been softened up.

==Battle==
After an intense bombardment by the &quot;grande batterie&quot; of Napoleon&#x27;s artillery that started about noon and hours of heated fighting, the French overpowered the first defensive lines and seized the town of Bautzen. The Prusso-Russians fell back in good order. By nightfall, the French were positioning to cut the allies off from their line of retreat but the Coalition was aware of Ney&#x27;s approach to their right flank. But Marshal Ney became confused, and his faulty positioning left the door open for the Allies to escape.

Fighting on the following day, 21 May, was again hard and after several hours of setbacks, renewed French attacks began to gain momentum. But these assaults were only intended to fix the allies in place so they could be cut off and enveloped. Once again, Marshal Ney became distracted and decided to seize the village of , and thus lost sight of the strategic importance of cutting off the allies.

The Russo-Prussian army was being pushed back and at 4:00pm, the Tsar realized the threat that Ney posed on his right and that the battle was lost and issued orders for a general retreat. Without Ney&#x27;s forces to seal them in, however, they again escaped the crushing defeat Napoleon had hoped for. Losses on both sides totaled around 20,000. But some other sources (e.g. Dr Stubner) also say that the losses on French side were significantly higher because of their aggressive attack tactics which failed to cut off the allies from their lines and the allies in fact only lost 11,000–14,000. The French victory at Bautzen is therefore often called a Pyrrhic victory. Given his numerical superiority, the outcome was a missed opportunity for Napoleon.

==Aftermath==
Although another battle victory for the French, Bautzen was not the decisive, strategic result that Napoleon had wanted. Ney&#x27;s failure to cut the line of retreat robbed the French of complete victory. Once more, Napoleon had to settle for a narrow and costly victory with over 20,000 French casualties. To make matters worse, during the battle, Napoleon&#x27;s close friend and Grand Marshal of the Palace, General Geraud Duroc, was mortally wounded by a cannonball the day after the battle and died. Following Bautzen, Napoleon agreed to a nine-week truce with the Coalition, requested by the Allies on 2 June 1813. The Armistice of Pläswitz was signed on 4 June, and lasted until 20 July but was later extended to 10 August. On the same 4 June the Battle of Luckau was fought. Napoleon hoped to gather more troops, especially cavalry, and better train his new army, but the allies were not idle and mobilised better prepared forces. After hostilities were resumed, the Austrians joined the ranks of the allies. It is reported that Napoleon later (on Saint Helena) said that his agreement to that truce was a bad mistake because the break was of much more use to the allies than to him.

<text>The Battle of Carillon, also known as the 1758 Battle of Ticonderoga, was fought on July 8, 1758, during the French and Indian War (which was part of the global Seven Years&#x27; War). It was fought near Fort Carillon (now known as Fort Ticonderoga) on the shore of Lake Champlain in the frontier area between the British colony of New York and the French colony of New France.

In the battle, which took place primarily on a rise about three-quarters of a mile (one km) from the fort itself, a French army of about 3,600 men under General Marquis de Montcalm and the Chevalier de Levis defeated a numerically superior force of British troops under General James Abercrombie, which frontally assaulted an entrenched French position without using field artillery, a lack that left the British and their allies vulnerable and allowed the French to win a complete victory. The battle was the bloodiest of the American theater of the war, with over 3,000 casualties suffered. French losses were about 400, while more than 2,000 were British.

American historian Lawrence Henry Gipson wrote of Abercrombie&#x27;s campaign that &quot;no military campaign was ever launched on American soil that involved a greater number of errors of judgment on the part of those in positions of responsibility&quot;. Many military historians have cited the Battle of Carillon as a classic example of tactical military incompetence. Abercrombie, confident of a quick victory, ignored several viable military options, such as flanking the French breastworks, waiting for his artillery, or laying siege to the fort. Instead, relying on a flawed report from a young military engineer, and ignoring some of that engineer&#x27;s recommendations, he decided in favor of a direct frontal assault on the thoroughly entrenched French, without the benefit of artillery. Montcalm, while concerned about the weak military position of the fort, conducted the defense with spirit. However, due in part to a lack of time, he committed strategic errors in preparing the area&#x27;s defenses that a competent attacker could have exploited, and he made tactical errors that made the attackers&#x27; job easier.

The fort, abandoned by its garrison, was captured by the British the following year, and it has been known as Fort Ticonderoga (after its location) ever since. This battle gave the fort a reputation for impregnability that had an effect on future military operations in the area. There were several large-scale military movements through the area in both the French and Indian War, as well as the American Revolutionary War with the American Capture of Fort Ticonderoga and the British siege of the fort two years later, however this was the only major battle fought near the fort&#x27;s location.

==Geography==
Fort Carillon is situated on a point of land between Lake Champlain and Lake George, at a natural point of conflict between French forces moving south from Canada and the St. Lawrence River Valley across the lake toward the Hudson Valley, and British forces moving up the Hudson from Albany. The fort was sited with Lake Champlain to the east, with Mount Independence rising on the far side. Immediately to the south of the fort lay the mouth of the La Chute River, which drains Lake George. The river was largely non-navigable, and there was a portage trail from the northern end of Lake George to the location of a sawmill the French had built to assist in the fort&#x27;s construction. The trail crossed the La Chute twice; once about from Lake George, and again at the sawmill, which was about from the fort.

To the north of the fort was a road going to Fort St. Frédéric. To the west was a low rise of land, beyond which lay Mount Hope, a rise that commanded part of the portage trail, but was too far from the fort to pose it any danger. The most serious geographic defect in the fort&#x27;s location was Mount Defiance (known at the time of this battle as Rattlesnake Hill, and in the 1770s as Sugar Bush), which lay to the south of the fort, across the La Chute River. This hill, which was steep and densely forested, provided an excellent firing position for cannon aimed at the fort. Nicolas Sarrebource de Pontleroy, Montcalm&#x27;s chief engineer, said of the fort&#x27;s site, &quot;Were I to be entrusted with the siege of it, I should require only six mortars and two cannon.&quot;

==Background==
Prior to 1758, the French and Indian War had gone very poorly for the British, whose military met few of its objectives. Following a string of French victories in 1757 in North America, coupled with military setbacks in Europe, William Pitt gained full control of the direction of British military efforts in the Seven Years&#x27; War. Embarking on a strategy that emphasized defense in Europe, where France was strong, and offense in North America, where France was weak, he resolved to attack New France (the colonial holdings of France in North America) in three strategic campaigns. Large-scale campaigns were planned to capture Fort Duquesne on the Pennsylvania frontier and the fortress at Louisbourg (on Île-Royale, now known as Cape Breton Island). The third campaign, assigned to General James Abercrombie, was to launch an attack against Canada through the Champlain Valley. Pitt probably would have preferred to have George Howe, a skilled tactician and a dynamic leader, lead this expedition, but seniority and political considerations led him to appoint the relatively undistinguished Abercrombie instead. Howe was appointed a brigadier general, and placed as Abercrombie&#x27;s second in command.

The French, who had started construction on Fort Carillon in 1755, used it as a launching point for the successful siege of Fort William Henry in 1757. Despite that and other successes in North America in 1757, the situation did not look good for them in 1758. As early as March, Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, the commanding general responsible of the French forces in North America, and the Marquis de Vaudreuil, New France&#x27;s governor, were aware that the British were planning to send large numbers of troops against them, and that they would have relatively little support from King Louis XV of France. The lack of support from France was in large part due to an unwillingness of the French military to risk the movement of significant military forces across the Atlantic Ocean, which was dominated by Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy. This situation was further exacerbated by Canada&#x27;s poor harvest in 1757, which resulted in food shortages as the winter progressed.

Montcalm and Vaudreuil, who did not get along with each other, differed on how to deal with the British threat. They had fewer than 5,000 regular troops, an estimated six thousand militia men, and a limited number of Indian allies, to bring against British forces reported to number 50,000. Vaudreuil, who had limited combat experience, wanted to divide the French forces, with about 5,000 each at Carillon and Louisbourg, and then send a picked force of about 3,500 men against the British in the Mohawk River on the northwestern frontiers of the Province of New York. Montcalm believed this to be folly, as the plan would enable the British to easily divert some of their forces to fend off the French attack. Vaudreuil prevailed, and in June 1758 Montcalm left Quebec for Carillon.

==British preparations==
The British amassed their army, under the command of General James Abercrombie, near the remains of Fort William Henry, which lay at the southern end of Lake George but had been destroyed following its capture by the French the previous year. The army numbered fully 16,000 men, making it the largest single force ever deployed in North America at the time. Its complement of 6,000 regular troops included Lord John Murray&#x27;s Highlanders of the 42nd (Highland) Regiment of Foot, the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot, the 44th Regiment of Foot, 46th Regiment of Foot, the 55th Regiment of Foot, the 1st and 4th battalions of 60th (Royal American) Regiment, and Gage&#x27;s Light Infantry, while the provinces providing militia support included Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. On July 5, 1758, these troops embarked on boats, which unloaded them at the north end of Lake George on July 6.

==French defensive preparations==
Colonel François-Charles de Bourlamaque, in command of Fort Carillon prior to Montcalm&#x27;s arrival, knew by June 23 that a major British offensive was about to begin. He had sent a messenger bearing a letter from Vaudreuil to Abercrombie (part of a conventional exchange of pleasantries between opposing commanders) on June 10, expecting him to return; the fact that the British held him was an indication that the messenger had probably learned too much just by being in the British camp. Bourlamaque increased scouting activities, and learned from captured British scouts the approximate size of the British force.

Montcalm arrived at Fort Carillon on June 30, and found there a significantly under-staffed garrison, with only 3,500 men, and food sufficient for only nine days. Bourlamaque&#x27;s scouts reported that the British had 20,000 or more troops massing near the remains of Fort William Henry. Given the large force facing him and the defects of the fort&#x27;s site, Montcalm opted for a strategy of defending the likely approaches to the fort. He immediately detached Bourlamaque and three battalions to occupy and fortify the river crossing on the portage trail about two miles (3.2 km) from the northern end of Lake George, about from the fort. Montcalm himself took two battalions and occupied and fortified an advance camp at the sawmill, while remaining troops were put to work preparing additional defenses outside the fort. He also sent word back to Montreal of the situation, requesting that, if possible, the Chevalier de Lévis and his men, be sent as reinforcement; these were troops that Vaudreuil intended for duty at the western frontier forts. Lévis had not yet left Montreal, so Vaudreuil instead ordered him and 400 troops to Carillon. They departed Montreal on July 2.

When word reached Bourlamaque on July 5 that the British fleet was coming, he sent Captain Trépezet and about 350 men to observe the fleet, and, if possible, to prevent their landing. On learning the size of the British fleet, which was reportedly &quot;large enough to cover the face of [Lake George]&quot;, Montcalm ordered Bourlamaque to retreat. Bourlamaque, who was satisfied with his defensive situation, resisted, not withdrawing until Montcalm repeated the orders three times. Montcalm, now aware of the scope of the movement, ordered all of the troops back to Carillon, and had both bridges on the portage trail destroyed. These withdrawals isolated Trépezet and his men from the main body, a situation made worse for Trépezet when his Indian guides, alarmed by the size of the British fleet, abandoned him.

Beginning on the evening of July 6, the French began to lay out entrenchments on the rise northwest of the fort, about away, that commanded the land routes to the fort. On July 7, they constructed a lengthy series of abatis (felled trees with sharpened branches pointed outward) below these entrenchments. By the end of that day, they had also constructed a wooden breastwork above the trenches. These hastily erected defenses, while proof against small arms fire, would have been ineffective if the British had used cannons against them.
==Battle of Bernetz Brook==

The British army began an unopposed landing at the north end of Lake George on the morning of July 6. Abercrombie first landed an advance force to check the area where the forces were to disembark, and found it recently deserted; some supplies and equipment had been left behind by the French in their hasty departure. The bulk of the army landed, formed into columns, and attempted to march up the west side of the stream that connected Lake George to Lake Champlain, rather than along the portage trail, whose bridges Montcalm had destroyed. However, the wood was very thick, and the columns could not be maintained.

Near the area where Bernetz Brook enters the La Chute, Captain Trépezet and his troop, who were attempting to return to the French lines, encountered Phineas Lyman&#x27;s Connecticut regiment, sparking a skirmish in the woods. General Howe&#x27;s column was near the action, so he led it in that direction. As they approached the battle scene, General Howe was hit and instantly killed by a musket ball. A column of Massachusetts provincials, also drawn to the battle, cut off the French patrol&#x27;s rear. In desperate fighting, about 150 of Trepézet&#x27;s men were killed, and another 150 were captured. Fifty men, including Trepézet, escaped by swimming across the La Chute. Trepézet died the next day of wounds suffered in the battle.

Sources disagree on the number of casualties suffered. William Nester claims British casualties were light, only ten dead and six wounded, while Rene Chartrand claims that there were about 100 killed and wounded, including the loss of General Howe. The British, frustrated by the difficult woods, demoralized by Howe&#x27;s death, and exhausted from the overnight boat ride, camped in the woods, and returned to the landing point early the next morning.

==Portage road==
On July 7 Abercrombie sent Lieutenant Colonel John Bradstreet and a sizable force down the portage path. On reaching the first crossing, where Bourlamaque had camped, they rebuilt the bridge there, and proceeded on to the sawmill crossing. The army then followed, and set up its camp there. Scouts and prisoners reported to Abercrombie that Montcalm had 6,000 men and was expecting the Chevalier de Lévis to arrive at any moment with 3,000 reinforcements. Abercrombie ordered his engineer, Lieutenant Matthew Clerk, and one of his aides, Captain James Abercrombie (it is uncertain if the Abercrombies were related or not) to reconnoiter the French defenses. After ascending Rattlesnake Hill (as Mount Defiance was then known), they reported that the French position appeared to be incomplete, and could be &quot;easily forced, even without cannon&quot;. They were unaware that the French had disguised much of the works with shrubs and trees, and that they were in fact largely complete. Clerk&#x27;s report included recommendations to fortify both the summit and the base of Rattlesnake Hill. Abercrombie decided that they had to attack the next morning, hopefully before Lévis and his supposed 3,000 arrived. Lévis arrived at the fort on the evening of July 7 with his troop of 400 regulars.

Abercrombie held a war council that evening. The options he presented to his staff were limited to asking if the next day&#x27;s attack should be in three ranks or four; the council opted for three. Abercrombie&#x27;s plan of attack omitted Clerk&#x27;s recommendation to fortify the summit of Rattlesnake Hill; in addition to the frontal assault, 4 six-pound guns and a howitzer were to be floated down the La Chute River and mounted at the base of Rattlesnake Hill, with 20 bateaux of troops to support the effort.

Early on the morning of July 8, Clerk went out once again to the base of Rattlesnake Hill to observe the French defenses; his report indicated that he still felt the French lines could be taken by assault.

==Battle lines form==
The battle began on the morning of July 8 with Rogers&#x27; Rangers and light infantry from Colonel Thomas Gage&#x27;s 80th Regiment of Light-Armed Foot pushing the few remaining French scouts behind the entrenchments. They were followed by provincials from New York and Massachusetts, and then three columns of regulars, who made their way through the provincial formations to begin the attack. The 27th and 60th made up the right column, under the command of the 27th&#x27;s Lt. Col. William Haviland, the 44th and 55th under Lt. Col. John Donaldson made the center, and the 42nd and 46th under the 42nd&#x27;s Lt. Col. Francis Grant formed the left column. Each column was preceded by the regimental light infantry companies. Held in reserve were provincial regiments from Connecticut and New Jersey.

Montcalm had organized the French forces into three brigades and a reserve. He commanded the Royal Roussillon and Berry battalions in the center of the entrenchments, while Lévis commanded the Béarn, Guyenne, and la Reine battalions on the right, and Bourlamaque led the La Sarre and Languedoc battalions on the left. Each battalion was given roughly of the entrenchment to defend. Redoubts with cannon protected the flanks of the entrenchments, although the one on the right had not been completed. The low ground between the left flank and the La Chute River was guarded by militia and marines, who had also constructed abatis to help protect their position. Reserve forces were either in the fort itself, or on the grounds between the fort and the entrenchments on Mount Hope. Portions of each battalion were also held in reserve, to assist in areas where they might be needed.
==Battle==
While Abercrombie had expected the battle to begin at 1 pm, by 12:30 elements of the New York regiments on the left began engaging the French defenders. The sounds of battle led Haviland to believe that the French line might have been penetrated, so he ordered his men forward, even though not all of the regulars were in place, and Abercrombie had not given an order to advance. The result, rather than an orderly, coordinated advance on the French position, was a piecemeal entry of the regulars into the battle. As companies of the regulars came forward, they arranged themselves into lines as instructed, and then began to advance. The right column, with a shorter distance to travel, attacked first, followed by the center, and then the left. The 42nd had initially been held in reserve, but after insisting on being allowed to participate, they joined the action.

The French position was such that they were able to lay down withering fire on the British forces as they advanced, and the abatis (a word that shares derivation with &quot;abattoir&quot;, or slaughterhouse) rapidly became a killing field. By about 2 pm, it was clear that the first wave of attack had failed. Montcalm was active on the battlefield, having removed his coat, and was moving among his men, giving encouragement and making sure all of their needs were being met. Abercrombie, who was reported by early historians like Francis Parkman and Thomas Mante to be at the sawmill (and thus well away from the action), was reported by his aide, James Abercrombie, to be near the rear of the lines by the La Chute River during much of the battle, and to have approached the front of the French lines at one point early in the battle. It is uncertain why, after the first wave of attack failed, Abercrombie persisted in ordering further attacks. Writing in his own defense, he later claimed that he was relying on Clerk&#x27;s assessment that the works could be easily taken; this was clearly refuted by the failure of the first charge.

Around 2 p.m., the British barges carrying artillery floated down the La Chute River, and, contrary to plan, came down a channel between an island in the La Chute and the shore. This brought them within range of the French left and some of the fort&#x27;s guns. Fire from cannons on the fort&#x27;s southwest bastion&#x27;s sank two of the barges, spurring the remaining vessels to retreat.

Abercrombie ordered his reserves, the Connecticut and New Jersey provincials, into the battle around 2, but by 2:30 it was clear their attack also failed. Abercrombie then tried to recall the troops, but a significant number, notably the 42nd and 46th regiments on the British left, persisted in the attack. Around 5 pm the 42nd made a desperate advance that actually succeeded in reaching the base of the French wall; those that actually managed to scale the breastwork were bayoneted. One British observer noted that &quot;Our Forces Fell Exceeding Fast&quot;, while another wrote that they were &quot;Cut Down Like Grass&quot;. The slaughter went on until nightfall, with a great many men retreating behind a breastwork that had been erected at the back of the battlefield.

Finally realizing the scope of the disaster, Abercrombie ordered the troops to muster and march down to the landing on Lake George. The retreat in the dark woods became somewhat panicked and disorganized, as rumors of French attacks swirled among the troops. By dawn the next morning, the army was rowing back up Lake George, reaching its base at the southern end around sunset. The humiliating nature of the retreat was immediately apparent to some of its participants; Lieutenant Colonel Artemas Ward wrote that they &quot;shamefully retreated&quot;.

==Aftermath==
Montcalm, wary of a second British attack, and concerned about the fatigue of his troops after a long day of battle, had barrels of beer and wine brought forward to the lines. The troops spent the night alternating between sleeping and working on the defenses in anticipation of a renewed attack.

News of the battle was received in England shortly after news of the fall of Louisbourg, putting a damper on the celebrations marking that victory. The full scope of British victories in 1758 did not reach English shores until later in the year, when Pitt learned of the successes at Forts Duquesne and Frontenac, key steps in completing the conquest of New France. Had Carillon also fallen in 1758, the conquest might have been completed in 1758 or 1759; as it happened, Montreal (the last point of resistance) did not surrender until 1760, with campaigns launched from Fort Oswego, Quebec, and Carillon, which was captured and renamed Ticonderoga in 1759 by forces under the command of Jeffery Amherst, the victor at Louisbourg.

Abercrombie never led another military campaign. Although he was active at Lake George, he did little more than provide support for John Bradstreet&#x27;s successful attack on Fort Frontenac, which was authorized in a war council on July 13. Bradstreet left with 3,000 men on July 23, and Abercrombie then refused to engage in further offensive acts, alleging a shortage of manpower. William Pitt, the British Secretary of State who had designed the British military strategy and received word of the defeat in August, wrote to Abercrombie on September 18 that the &quot;King has judged proper that you should return to England.&quot; Abercrombie continued to be promoted, eventually reaching the rank of full General in 1772.

The fact that Indians allied to the British witnessed the debacle first hand complicated future relations with them. News of the defeat circulated widely in their communities, which had a significant effect on the ability of British agents to recruit Indians to their side for future operations.

==Casualties==
The battle was the bloodiest of the war, with over 3,000 casualties suffered. French casualties are normally considered to be comparatively light: 104 killed and 273 wounded in the main battle. Combined with the effective elimination of Trépezet&#x27;s force on July 6, there were about 550 casualties, about 13 per cent of the French force, a percentage similar to the losses of the British (who Chartrand calculates as having lost 11.5 to 15 per cent).

General Abercrombie reported 547 killed, 1,356 wounded, and 77 missing. Lévis in one report claimed that the French recovered 800 British bodies, implying that Abercrombie may have underreported the actual death toll. Chartrand estimates the number of British killed (or died of their wounds) at about 1,000 for the main battle, with about 1,500 wounded. The skirmish on July 6 cost the British about 100 killed and wounded, and the loss of General Howe.

The 42nd Regiment, known as the Black Watch, paid dearly with the loss of many lives and many severely wounded. More than 300 men (including 8 officers) were killed, and a similar number were wounded, representing a significant fraction of the total casualties suffered by the British. King George III, later in July 1758, designated the 42nd a &quot;Royal&quot; regiment, due to its gallantry in earlier battles, and issued letters of service for adding a second battalion &quot;as a testimony of his Majesty&#x27;s satisfaction and approbation of the extraordinary courage, loyalty, and exemplary conduct of the Highland regiment.&quot; However, the king did not learn of the regiment&#x27;s loss of almost half its strength in this battle until August.

A legend has long circulated concerning the death of the Black Watch&#x27;s Major Duncan Campbell. In 1742, the ghost of Campbell&#x27;s dead brother is said to have appeared to him in a dream with a promise to meet him again at &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;, a place name that was unknown to him at the time. Campbell died of wounds sustained during the battle.

==Analysis==
The actions of both commanders have been extensively analyzed in this action. While Montcalm performed well during the battle, some tactical options escaped his notice, and some of his actions in preparing the defenses at Carillon are open to question. In contrast, almost everything Abercrombie did has been questioned. It is widely held among historians that he was an incompetent commander.

===Montcalm===
Both commanders were a product of the environment of European warfare, which generally took place in open fields with relatively easy mobility, and were thus uncomfortable with woodland warfare. Neither liked the irregular warfare practiced by the Indians and British counterparts like Rogers&#x27; Rangers, but saw them as a necessary evil, given the operating environment. Although the French depended on Indian support to increase their comparatively small numbers throughout the war, Indian forces were quite low in this battle, and Montcalm generally disliked them and their practices.

Montcalm in particular would have benefited from practicing a more irregular form of warfare. He apparently never inspected the landing area at the north end of Lake George, which was a location from which he could contest the British landing. Furthermore, the French could then have used the confined woodlands to blunt the numerical advantage of the British, and contested the entire portage road. The fact that fortifications were built along the portage road but then abandoned by the French is one indication of this failure of strategic thinking. Nester estimates that contesting the first crossing on the portage road would have gained Montcalm an additional day for defensive preparations.
===Abercrombie===
James Holden, writing in 1911, noted that American and British writers, both contemporary and historical, used words like &quot;imbecile&quot;, &quot;coward&quot;, &quot;unready&quot;, and &quot;old woman&quot; to describe Abercrombie.

====Before the battle====
Criticisms of Abercrombie begin with his reliance on relatively poor intelligence. Reports reached him that the French strength at Carillon was 6,000, and that a further 3,000 were expected. Many of these reports were from French deserters or captives, and Abercrombie should have investigated them by sending out scouts or light infantry. Even if the reports were accurate, Abercrombie&#x27;s army still significantly outnumbered that of Montcalm. The same sources must also have reported the shortage of provisions at the fort, a sign that a siege would have ended quickly.

Abercrombie&#x27;s next error was an apparent over-reliance on the analysis of Matthew Clerk. His lack of experienced engineers caused the state of French defences to be repeatedly misread. What is clear is that Abercrombie, in his stated desire for haste, did not want to act on Clerk&#x27;s recommendation to fortify Rattlesnake Hill, and then sought to blame Clerk, claiming he was merely acting on the engineer&#x27;s advice. Clerk was one of the battle&#x27;s casualties, so he was unavailable to defend himself against assignment of some of the blame. Captain Charles Lee of the 44th Foot wrote, on the prospect of using cannon on Rattlesnake Hill, &quot;There was one hill in particular, which seem&#x27;d to offer itself as an ally to us, it immediately commanded the lines from hence two small cannon well planted must have drove the French in a very short time from their breast work [...] this was never thought of, which (one wou&#x27;d imagine) must have occur&#x27;d to any blockhead who was not absolutely so far sunk into Idiotism as to be oblig&#x27;d to wear a bib and bells.&quot;

The tactical decision not to bring cannons forward was probably one of Abercrombie&#x27;s most significant errors. The use of cannon against the French works would have cleared paths through the abatis and breached the breastworks.

Abercrombie also had the option to avoid a pitched battle, instead beginning siege operations against the French position. His force was large enough that he could have fully invested the French position and fended off any arriving reinforcements.

====Tactics====
Abercrombie made two notable errors of judgment during the battle. One was a failure to recognize after the first wave of attacks that his chosen method of attack was unlikely to work. Instead of ordering additional waves of troops to the slaughter, he should have retreated to a safe distance and considered alternative actions. The second failure was that he apparently never considered ordering a flanking maneuver against the French right. At a minimum this would have stretched the French defenses, allowing his attackers elsewhere to find weak points. In fact, the French twice in the battle sent companies of militia out of their works on the right to enfilade the British attackers.

====After the battle====
The disorganized nature of the British retreat demonstrated a loss of effective command. An experienced commander could easily have encamped at the Lake George landing, taken stock of the situation, and begun siege operations against the French. Abercrombie, to the surprise of some in his army, ordered a retreat all the way back to the south end of Lake George. Nester, unable to find other rational reasons for this, claims that the general must have panicked.

==Legacy==
While the fort itself was never endangered by the British assault, Ticonderoga became a byword for impregnability. Even though the fort was effectively handed to the British by a retreating French army in 1759, future defenders of the fort and their superior officers, who may not have been familiar with the site&#x27;s shortcomings, fell under the spell of this idea. In 1777, when General John Burgoyne advanced down Lake Champlain at the beginning of the Saratoga campaign, General George Washington, who had never seen the fort, thought highly of its defensive value. Anthony Wayne, who was at Fort Ticonderoga preparing its defenses before Burgoyne&#x27;s arrival, wrote to Washington that the fort &quot;can never be carried, without much loss of blood&quot;. Fort Ticonderoga was surrendered by the Americans without much of a fight in July 1777.

The modern flag of Quebec is based upon a banner reputedly carried by the victorious French forces at Carillon. The banner, now known as the flag of Carillon, dates back to the 17th century, confirmed by textile expert Jean-Michel Tuchscherer: &quot;The flag is without doubt an exceptional piece of document from the 17th century&quot;. As for the coat of arm under the madonna now erased, they were most probably that of Charles, Marquis of Beauharnois (1671–1749), Governor of New France from 1726 to 1747: Silver on one side with a saber, mounted on three merlettes. Only the governor had the right to inscribe his personal crest on a banner with the arms of France, and only Beauharnois had the eagles to support his crest. The flag was probably fabricated around 1726, date of the arrival of Marquis de Beauharnois, and May 29, 1732, date when it was flown for the order of Saint Louis, with its motto: &quot;Bellicae virtutis praemium&quot;. However, historian Alistair Fraser is of the opinion that stories of the flag&#x27;s presence on the battlefield appear to be a 19th-century fabrication, as there is no evidence that the large religious banner (2 by 3 meters, or 6 by 10 feet) on which the flag design was based was actually used as a standard at the battle.

==Cultural references==
A song called &quot;Piper&#x27;s Refrain&quot; by Rich Nardin is based on the legend of a Scottish Highlander soldier, Duncan Campbell, who is doomed to die &quot;at a place where he never had been&quot; called Ticonderoga. He is a member of the Highland brigade and dies in the attack on the fort. There is another song by Margaret MacArthur on the same subject. The Nardin song was recorded by Gordon Bok, Anne Mayo Muir, and Ed Trickett on their album, &quot;And So Will We Yet&quot;.

The battle is also described, with some historical accuracy, in James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s 1845 novel &quot;Satanstoe&quot;.

<text>The Battle of Champaubert (10 February 1814) was the opening engagement of the Six Days&#x27; Campaign. It was fought between a French army led by Emperor Napoleon and a small Russian corps commanded by Lieutenant General Count Zakhar Dmitrievich Olsufiev. After putting up a good fight, the Russian formation was destroyed; the survivors escaped into the woods while Olsufiev became a French prisoner. 

After defeating Napoleon at the Battle of La Rothière nine days earlier, the two main Allied armies under Austrian Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg and Prussian Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher separated. Schwarzenberg&#x27;s southern advance was slow while the Prussian field marshal&#x27;s march represented a more serious threat to Paris. Leaving part of his forces to hold off Schwarzenberg, Napoleon massed 30,000 troops to deal with Blücher, who allowed his 57,000-man army to become badly spread out. Allied lapses in communication and Blücher&#x27;s overconfidence left Olsufiev&#x27;s corps isolated near Champaubert when Napoleon&#x27;s army lunged from the south to deal it a crushing blow.

Champaubert is located in France, southwest of Épernay and east of Paris.

==Prelude==

===Allied pursuit===
On 1 February 1814, Prussian field marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher with 80,000 Allied troops from his own Army of Silesia and Austrian field marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg&#x27;s Army of Bohemia defeated Napoleon and 45,000 French soldiers in the Battle of La Rothière. This setback seriously shook the French army&#x27;s morale. Each side suffered about 6,000 casualties but the Allies captured 50–60 artillery pieces. The Allies were delighted by their victory, though it might have been more complete if all their reserves had been committed to the battle. At this time, the Allied generals made the questionable decision to separate their armies. Blücher&#x27;s army would advance from Châlons-sur-Marne toward Meaux while Schwarzenberg&#x27;s army operated on a more southerly route from Troyes toward Paris.

On 3 February, Napoleon&#x27;s army reached Troyes after completely breaking contact with the Allies the previous day. On 4 February, Schwarzenberg wrote his colleague Blücher that he was moving farther south in order to turn Napoleon&#x27;s right flank. The next day, Russian General Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly ordered Alexander Nikitich Seslavin&#x27;s scouting force from Schwarzenberg&#x27;s right flank to the left flank without notifying Blücher. Since the Prussian field marshal did not have a liaison officer with Seslavin&#x27;s force he did not realize that no one was watching for French forces in the space on his left flank. Also on 5 February, Napoleon decided to abandon Troyes and fall back to Nogent-sur-Seine. He planned to contain Schwarzenberg with part of his army while attacking Blücher.

Having prepared for a grand assault on Troyes, Schwarzenberg found the place empty of French troops on 7 February. He decided to let his troops rest for the next two days. Meanwhile, Napoleon reorganized his cavalry into the I Cavalry Corps under Étienne Tardif de Pommeroux de Bordesoulle, II Cavalry Corps led by Antoine-Louis Decrest de Saint-Germain, V Cavalry Corps commanded by Édouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud, VI Cavalry Corps directed by François Etienne de Kellermann and an independent division under Jean-Marie Defrance. The French emperor created a new VII Corps from two divisions transferred from the Spanish front and put Marshal Nicolas Oudinot in charge.

At the end of January a 10,000–11,000-man French corps under Marshal Jacques MacDonald approached from the north. Supposing that Schwarzenberg&#x27;s maneuvers would draw Napoleon away from his Army of Silesia, Blücher focused on destroying MacDonald&#x27;s corps. During the first week of February, the Prussian field marshal ordered Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg&#x27;s corps to pursue MacDonald along the main highway in the Marne River valley. Hoping to trap the French corps, Blücher sent Fabian Gottlieb von Osten-Sacken&#x27;s corps along the more direct road through Montmirail and La Ferté-sous-Jouarre. Trying to accomplish two strategic goals at once, the Prussian army commander hung back to allow the newly arrived corps of Peter Mikhailovich Kaptzevich and Friedrich von Kleist to catch up with him. Blücher utilized Zakhar Dmitrievich Olsufiev&#x27;s small corps to link the two parts of his army.

On 8 February, Sacken&#x27;s cavalry reached Viels-Maisons while his infantry was to the east at Montmirail. Olsufiev&#x27;s corps was farther east at Étoges while Blücher established his headquarters another east at Vertus. Kaptzevich and Kleist were east of their army commander in Châlons-sur-Marne. Yorck&#x27;s corps was in the Marne valley at least to the north, separated by bad roads. The Army of Silesia was now spread across a front of . Blucher assumed that Seslavin would report any danger coming from the south. That night, when his Cossacks were driven out of Sézanne, Sacken did not bother to report the incident to Blücher. In fact, it was Napoleon&#x27;s leading corps under Marshal Auguste de Marmont.

===French offensive===
Napoleon left 39,000 troops to contain Schwarzenberg&#x27;s Army of Bohemia. The formations were Oudinot&#x27;s VII Corps, Marshal Claude Perrin Victor&#x27;s II Corps, Étienne Maurice Gérard&#x27;s Reserve of Paris, Henri Rottembourg&#x27;s Young Guard infantry division, Milhaud&#x27;s V Cavalry Corps and smaller units. Napoleon&#x27;s striking force numbered about 20,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 horsemen. Another authority agreed that the French army numbered 30,000 men and added that it was supported by 120 guns. The army was formed by Marshal Michel Ney&#x27;s two Young Guard infantry divisions, Marmont&#x27;s VI Corps, part of the Imperial Guard cavalry, I Cavalry Corps and Defrance&#x27;s cavalry division. Bringing up the rear at Nogent was Marshal Édouard Mortier, duc de Trévise with two Old Guard infantry divisions.

On 9 February, MacDonald slipped across the Marne at La Ferté-sous-Jouarre, just ahead of Sacken. That day, Kaptzevich and Kleist rendezvoused with Blücher at Vertus, Olsufiev marched west to Champaubert, Sacken reached La Ferté-sous-Jouarre and Yorck was at Château-Thierry. According to Karl Freiherr von Müffling of Blücher&#x27;s staff, the Army of Silesia counted 57,000 men, including Sacken&#x27;s 20,000, Yorck&#x27;s 18,000 and Kaptzevich, Olsufiev and Kleist with a combined 19,000. Marmont&#x27;s cavalry advance guard appeared at Talus-Saint-Prix on the Petit Morin River. Because the horsemen soon withdrew, Blücher&#x27;s chief of staff August Neidhardt von Gneisenau believed they represented no danger. When Schwarzenberg asked the Prussian field marshal to support his right flank corps under Peter Wittgenstein, Blücher ordered Kaptzevich and Kleist to march southwest to Sézanne the next day. Olsufiev was ordered to march south from Champaubert. That night, Blücher finally received news that Napoleon was at Sézanne. Nevertheless, Gneisenau authorized Sacken to continue the pursuit of MacDonald to the west.

Napoleon&#x27;s soldiers plodded along roads deep in mud from days of rain. The men had to suffer hunger pangs when the provision wagons failed to turn up. The bogged artillery was only brought forward when the rural inhabitants in large numbers helped haul the guns through the mud. At first the French population had resigned itself to the Allied invasion, but after suffering at the hands of the Russians and Prussians, the people were eager to assist the army. On 10 February, as Blücher accompanied the column of Kaptzevich and Kleist while it marched toward Sézanne, the sound of artillery began to rumble ominously to the right near Champaubert.

==Battle==
===Forces===
===Action===
On 10 February Napoleon moved against Blücher&#x27;s over-extended army in the hope of smashing it. He caught Olsufiev&#x27;s IX Corps of 5,000 Russians near the village of Baye just south of Champaubert. The battle was one of the few times during the war that France was able to take the field with a large numerical advantage, in this case six-to-one. Planning to march south to Sézanne that day, Olsufiev left the Saint-Prix bridge over the Petit Morin intact. He also left the span unguarded, so that Napoleon&#x27;s cavalry seized it early in the morning. Marmont&#x27;s two VI Corps divisions led the French column. Joseph Lagrange&#x27;s 3rd Division filed across the Saint-Prix bridge followed by Étienne Pierre Sylvestre Ricard&#x27;s 8th Division. Following Napoleon&#x27;s instructions, 100 Guard Dragoons rode ahead into Bannay where they surprised and captured a group of Russian soldiers.

Olsufiev&#x27;s pickets were overrun by 10:00 am and although badly outnumbered, the Russian decided to fight rather than retreat. His decision was based partly on the mistaken hope that he would get reinforcements from Blücher in time to prevent a disaster. The correct decision would have been to retreat east to Étoges, but the Russian general had been criticized for the loss of the château during the Battle of Brienne on 29 January. He was also blamed for mishandling his troops at La Rothière and Sacken wanted him hauled before a court-martial. In the circumstances, Olsufiev chose to battle it out in order to clear his name. He did, however, send messengers to the Prussian army commander telling his superior what was occurring. In the event, Blücher brushed aside Olsufiev&#x27;s couriers, insisting that Napoleon was not on the scene and that the attackers were no more than 2,000 French partisans.

Lagrange&#x27;s division angled to the left toward Bannay, led by the 2nd Light Infantry Regiment and a marine battalion, while Ricard&#x27;s division marched straight toward Baye. Olsufiev sent Evstafi Evstafievich Udom with two jäger infantry battalions to clear the French skirmishers out of Baye. As the French pressure increased, Udom was reinforced so that he had the 10th, 12th, 22nd and 38th Jäger Regiments and six guns. Around 11:00 am Ricard pressed Udom&#x27;s troops back into Baye and the nearby woods. Olsufiev sent a brigade and six guns to hold the right flank while the bulk of his corps deployed between Baye and Bannay. The French brought 12 guns into action as more and more of their soldiers passed the bridge and arrived on the field. Pierre Pelleport&#x27;s brigade led Lagrange&#x27;s division as it assaulted Bannay. At 1:00 pm Olsufiev was still holding out on his forward position. At that hour, the Russian commander held a council of war in which his generals voted for a retreat to Étoges. Olsufiev refused, saying that he had specific orders to hold Champaubert.

Seeing that a small wood was the key to the position, Marmont organized a general attack. He sent the 113th Line Infantry forward deployed in skirmish order. Assisted by a horse artillery battery from I Cavalry Corps and a lancer squadron under Cyrille-Simon Picquet, Ricard&#x27;s division captured Baye. Lagrange attacked between Baye and Bannay. Ney&#x27;s divisions began to arrive and his guns pounded Bannay. Bordesoulle&#x27;s cavalry on the right and Jean-Pierre Doumerc&#x27;s on the left began edging around the Russian flanks. The 7th Battalion of the 4th Light Infantry were the first French troops to occupy Baye while Pelleport&#x27;s brigade took Bannay. Olsufiev pulled back and established a new line at the Andecy Farm. As French cavalry began to envelop both flanks, the Russians withdrew again toward Champaubert.

Since the terrain favored the French on the west flank, Lagrange launched an attack on that side. Without proper artillery support, the French infantry were stopped and thrown back by the concentrated fire of 24 Russian guns. Numerous French Guard field pieces, slowed by the mud, soon appeared and provided a rallying point for Lagrange&#x27;s men. After taking a detour, Doumerc&#x27;s horsemen appeared at Fromentières on the highway west of Champaubert. When Olsufiev received reports that the road east to Châlons was also blocked, he resolved to cut his way out in that direction. The Russian commander directed Prince Konstantin Poltoratsky with the Apsheron and Nacheburg Infantry Regiments and nine guns to hold Champaubert, while he attacked east toward Étoges with the bulk of his troops. Olsufiev&#x27;s breakout attempt failed.

With his artillery posted at the Champaubert crossroads, Poltoratsky&#x27;s brigade drove off several cavalry charges. In fierce fighting with the bayonet, Ricard&#x27;s soldiers captured the village, lost it to a counterattack, then clawed their way back into a few houses. After failing to cut his way out to the east, about 3:00 pm Poltoratsky began a fighting withdrawal to the north with his men in square formation. Heading for the village of La Caure, his soldiers kept the French back with regular volleys. About north of Champaubert they began to run out of ammunition and their ranks began to show unsteadiness. The French demanded that Poltoratsky capitulate and when he refused, they brought up a horse artillery battery and began blasting his troops with canister shot. Instead of being a possible refuge, the nearby woods turned out to be filled with French skirmishers. With his men being mown down by canister and riddled by musketry, Poltoratsky finally agreed to surrender his two regiments and cannons.

After failing to force its way to Étoges, Olsufiev&#x27;s main body veered to the north in an attempt to escape. Near La Caure, while maneuvering to enter a swampy forest, he exposed one of his flanks. Spotting the tactical error, Marmont ordered a brigade of Bordesoulle&#x27;s cuirassiers to charge. The heavy cavalrymen crashed into the Russian formation, cutting it in two parts. The Russian foot soldiers were completely routed, some of them throwing away their muskets and packs as they scattered into the woods. Marmont ordered the exits blocked and many Russians were captured. Udom and his fellow division commander Peter Yakovlevich Kornilov managed to get away with 1,500–2,000 men. That night they reached Port-à-Binson on the Marne after going cross-country. A 19-year old French conscript with fewer than six months of service made Olsufiev a prisoner.

==Aftermath==
According to Digby Smith the French lost 600 killed and wounded out of the 13,300 infantry and 1,700 cavalry that were engaged in the action. The Russians lost 2,400 men and 9 guns out of the 3,700 soldiers and 24 guns that were present. Captured were General-Leutnant Olsufiev and General-major Prince Konstantin Poltoratsky. Francis Loraine Petre credited Olsufiev with 4,000 infantry and 24 guns of which 1,600–1,700 men and 15 guns escaped. George Nafziger cited several sources including one that listed Russian losses as 1,400 dead and 1,894 captured including three generals and 21 guns, with 1,900 troops getting away. French losses were estimated at 200–600. David G. Chandler stated that French losses were only about 200 men and that only 1,000 out of 5,000 Russians escaped death or capture. Gaston Bodart stated that the Russians lost 2,400 men and 9 guns out of the 4,000 soldiers and 24 guns engaged. Bodart gave French casualties as 600 out of 5,000 men engaged. Kornilov assumed command of the remnant of IX Corps. Its approximately 1,500 survivors were grouped into three or four temporary battalions. This unlucky outfit suffered 600 more casualties and lost all their cannons at the Battle of Vauchamps on 14 February.

When Blücher heard about Olsufiev&#x27;s disaster, he ordered Kaptzevich and Kleist to turn around and make a night march back to Vertus. Sacken, who had marched west to Trilport, was ordered to return to Montmirail. Yorck was requested to meet Sacken near Montmirail while holding open an escape route over the Marne at Château-Thierry. After the battle, Napoleon found himself squarely in the middle of the overextended Army of Silesia. If he advanced to the east, he would merely push the corps of Kaptzevich and Kleist back. A move to the west held the possibility of trapping and destroying the forces under Sacken and Yorck, so he turned west. Napoleon ordered Marmont with Lagrange&#x27;s division and the I Cavalry Corps to hold Étoges and keep Blücher under observation. At 7:00 pm the emperor directed Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty with two cavalry divisions to occupy Montmirail. They were to be joined there in the morning by Ricard&#x27;s division and the divisions under Ney and Mortier. The Battle of Montmirail was fought the next day against Sacken and Yorck.

<text>Oingo Boingo () was an American new wave band formed by songwriter Danny Elfman in 1979. The band emerged from a surrealist musical theatre troupe, The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo, that Elfman had led and written material for in the years previous. Their highest-charting song, &quot;Weird Science&quot;, reached No. 45 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Oingo Boingo was known for their high-energy live concerts and experimental music, which can be described as combining elements of music such as art, punk, ska, rock, pop, jazz, and world, amongst other genres. The band&#x27;s body of work spanned 17 years, with various genre and line-up changes. Their best-known songs include &quot;Only a Lad&quot;, &quot;Little Girls&quot;, &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Party&quot; and &quot;Weird Science&quot;.

The band experienced multiple line-up changes, with Leon Schneiderman, Dale Turner, Sam Phipps, Danny Elfman, Steve Bartek, and John &quot;Vatos&quot; Hernandez being the constant members for most of their history. As a rock band, Oingo Boingo started as a ska and punk-influenced new wave octet, achieving significant popularity in Southern California. During the mid-1980s, the band adopted a more pop-oriented style, until a significant genre change to a more guitar-driven rock style in 1994. At that point, the name was shortened to simply Boingo and the keyboard and horn section were dropped. The band retired after a farewell concert on Halloween 1995, for which they reverted to the name Oingo Boingo and readopted the horn section.

==History==
===The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo (1972–1979)===

The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo began as a street theater troupe in Los Angeles, founded by Richard Elfman. The name was inspired by a fictional secret society on the &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; TV series called &quot;The Mystic Knights of the Sea&quot;. The earliest version of the band employed as many as 15 performers at any given time, playing over 30 instruments, including some instruments built by band members.

Richard&#x27;s brother Danny Elfman joined the band in 1974 and later became its leader. The group gradually moved away from its street theater origins and transformed into a dedicated musical theater act. The group performed an eclectic repertoire, ranging from Cab Calloway covers to instrumentals in the style of Balinese gamelan and Russian ballet music and, later, original songs by Danny Elfman. Guitarist Steve Bartek joined in 1976 as musical co-director. That year, the troupe appeared on the TV talent contest program &quot;The Gong Show&quot;, which they won.

===I.R.S. and A&amp;M years (1979–1984)===

In 1979, Danny Elfman reformed the group as a dedicated rock band, under the new name &quot;Oingo Boingo&quot;, at which point most existing members left. Steve Bartek and a brass trio of Dale Turner, Sam &quot;Sluggo&quot; Phipps, and Leon Schneiderman continued with the new band. Various reasons were given for the restart as a rock band, notably Danny&#x27;s emerging musical interests, and reducing the need for transportation and set-up of multiple stage sets and props. Elfman stated the shift was inspired by ska revival bands such as the Specials, Madness, and the Selecter, new wave bands like XTC, Devo, and Fun Boy Three, as well as the &quot;energy and speed&quot; of punk.

The name Oingo Boingo was settled on in 1979, at which point their early song &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid&quot; appeared on the Rhino Records Los Angeles rock and new wave &quot;up and coming&quot; compilation, &quot;L.A. In&quot;.

That same year, the band self-funded a promo EP record, known as the &quot;Demo EP&quot;, for distribution to radio stations and recording industry A&amp;R representatives to help land a contract. The effort paid off, as the record caught the attention of I.R.S. Records, who released a revised version of the EP in 1980: the &quot;Oingo Boingo (EP)&quot;.

The band had now coalesced as an octet: Danny Elfman on lead vocals and rhythm guitar; Steve Bartek on lead guitar; Richard Gibbs on keyboards; Kerry Hatch on bass; Johnny &quot;Vatos&quot; Hernandez on drums; and Leon Schneiderman, Sam &quot;Sluggo&quot; Phipps, and Dale Turner on horns. Early success for the group came in 1980 with the song &quot;Only a Lad&quot; from the eponymous EP. The song aired frequently in Los Angeles on KROQ-FM, and complemented the station&#x27;s then-unusual new wave format.

Following regional success of &quot;Only a Lad&quot;, the group released its first full-length album in 1981, also titled &quot;Only a Lad&quot; (and featuring a new recording of the song). The band released further albums &quot;Nothing to Fear&quot; in 1982, and &quot;Good for Your Soul&quot; in 1983. Although the band&#x27;s sound was termed as new wave, Oingo Boingo&#x27;s use of exotic percussion, a three-piece horn section, unconventional scales and harmony, and surreal imagery was a genre-skewing combination.

In 1984, bassist Kerry Hatch and keyboardist Richard Gibbs departed to form the short-lived band &quot;Zuma II&quot; and Oingo Boingo went on temporary hiatus, although this was not known publicly at the time. Elfman later claimed the two departing members had &quot;lost the spirit&quot;, but stated, &quot;I could never blame anybody for losing the spirit. It&#x27;s very hard being an 8-piece ensemble doing what, at the time, was non-commercial music&quot;.

===MCA years (1984–1992)===

Elfman used the 1984 hiatus as an opportunity to release a solo album, co-produced with Steve Bartek, with the remaining members of Oingo Boingo returning as session musicians. This was released as &quot;So-Lo&quot; in late 1984. At this point, new manager Mike Gormley, who had just left the position of VP of Publicity and Asst. to the Chairman of A&amp;M, negotiated a release from the label and signed the band to MCA Records.

Shortly after releasing &quot;So-Lo&quot;, Oingo Boingo returned to performing with new bassist John Avila and keyboardist Mike Bacich. The first release with the new line-up was &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Party&quot; in 1985. The album marked a notable change towards more pop oriented songwriting and production style, and became the band&#x27;s most commercially successful record. It featured their highest-charting song on the Billboard Hot 100, &quot;Weird Science&quot;, which was written for the John Hughes film of the same name.

The band appeared on a number of movie soundtracks in the early to mid-1980s, including an appearance in the movie &quot;Back to School&quot; in 1986, performing their hit single &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Party&quot;. The soundtrack to the movie &quot;Bachelor Party&quot; included a theme song written by Elfman, and a song unreleased on any Oingo Boingo album: &quot;Something Isn&#x27;t Right&quot;.

During this era, Danny Elfman also began scoring major films, beginning with 1985&#x27;s &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;. Elfman would go on to write the scores to almost all of Tim Burton&#x27;s films. Oingo Boingo guitarist Steve Bartek has orchestrated most of Elfman&#x27;s film and television scores.

The album &quot;BOI-NGO&quot; was released in 1987. Following its recording, Bacich was replaced by new keyboardist Carl Graves. The band&#x27;s 1988 release, &quot;Boingo Alive&quot;, comprised &quot;live&quot; re-recordings of previous album songs on a studio soundstage, plus a new song, &quot;Winning Side&quot;. This new track was also released as a single, and became a No. 14 hit on US Modern Rock radio stations.

In 1990, the band released their seventh studio album, &quot;Dark at the End of the Tunnel&quot;, featuring more mellow songs than any previous release, and including the singles &quot;Out of Control&quot; and &quot;Flesh &#x27;N Blood&quot;.

===Final years (1993–1995)===
Oingo Boingo continued to regularly perform live, most notably with annual Halloween concerts at Irvine Meadows and the Universal Amphitheatre. Following a short hiatus in 1992, during which time Elfman was busy scoring films, the band returned in 1993 with an increasingly different, hard-rock musical direction, and debuted new material such as &quot;Insanity&quot;, &quot;Helpless&quot; and the unreleased song &quot;Did It There&quot;. Shows during these years often included the so-called &quot;Sad Clown Orchestra&quot; providing additional accordion and circus percussion.

That same year, Oingo Boingo began recording an eighth studio album for new label Giant Records. The sessions stalled when Elfman became heavily involved writing the music for animated musical &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; with Tim Burton. Of this period, Elfman would later reflect that, after over 15 years, he had begun losing his passion for the band.

In 1994, the band consolidated their new musical style, and shortened its name to Boingo. Guitarist Warren Fitzgerald joined while keyboardist Carl Graves and the horn trio were removed. This marked the only year that the band toured without the horn section.

The previously shelved album was completed with the new 5-piece line-up, including orchestral instrumentation, and several songs improvised in the studio for the first time in the band&#x27;s history. This was released as &quot;Boingo&quot; in 1994, and would be the band&#x27;s final studio album.

In 1995, it was announced that Boingo would be disbanding after 17 years. The band embarked on a farewell tour in 1995, restoring the original horn trio, and reverting its name to Oingo Boingo, ending with a final Halloween performance at the Universal Amphitheatre. The concert was filmed and released on both VHS and CD in 1996 as &quot;Farewell&quot;.

===Post-breakup===
Following the band&#x27;s dissolution, Danny Elfman continued composing for film and has been nominated for four Academy Awards for his work. He has scored the majority of Tim Burton&#x27;s films since &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; in 1985, including &quot;Batman&quot; (1989), &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; (1990), &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; (1993) and &quot;Big Fish&quot; (2003). Other scores include &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; (1997), &quot;Men in Black&quot; (1997) and &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002). Elfman has also written themes for more than a dozen TV series, including &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, and &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. Elfman almost exclusively employs former Oingo Boingo guitarist Steve Bartek as his orchestrator.

For a period, John Avila and Johnny &quot;Vatos&quot; Hernandez continued to perform as Food for Feet and in the band Tito &amp; Tarantula in Los Angeles. Doug Lacy (Boingo live keyboardist and percussionist) recruited bassist John Avila, guitarist Steve Bartek, drummer Johnny &quot;Vatos&quot; Hernandez, and saxophonist Sam Phipps (among other musicians) for a band called Doug &amp; The Mystics. They recorded one album, &quot;New Hat&quot;, which included a cover of the Oingo Boingo song &quot;Try to Believe&quot;. Former keyboardist Richard Gibbs also began a career as a composer for film.

Danny Elfman has regularly stated that there will not be an Oingo Boingo reunion, initially citing his worry that playing live would exacerbate his hearing loss. In 2021 Elfman added that he disliked former bands reuniting now that they are older, likening them to &quot;zombies&quot;.

On Halloween 2015, a live concert performance of &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; culminated in Elfman and former Oingo Boingo guitarist Steve Bartek performing &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Party&quot; for the first time in twenty years, accompanied by the orchestra. The song was again performed on several subsequent &quot;Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; concert dates.

In April 2016, Oingo Boingo were honored with a resolution at Los Angeles City Hall. Popular L.A. radio and television personality Richard Blade gave a speech about the band&#x27;s legacy. Several members attended the meeting from across the band&#x27;s changing line-ups, including Johnny &quot;Vatos&quot; Hernandez, founding keyboardist Richard Gibbs, John Avila, Carl Graves, and Sam &quot;Sluggo&quot; Phipps.

On June 11, 2021, Elfman released his first solo studio album in 37 years, &quot;Big Mess.&quot; It includes the participation of former members of Oingo Boingo, such as Bartek, Fitzgerald, and Mann and a new arrangement and recording of Oingo Boingo&#x27;s &quot;Insects&quot; from the 1982 album &quot;Nothing to Fear&quot;.

====Tribute band====
Since Halloween 2005, former drummer Johnny &quot;Vatos&quot; Hernandez has regularly put together an Oingo Boingo tribute band, performing mainly throughout Southern California and Arizona, including the Grove of Anaheim. Initially billed as the &quot;Johnny &#x27;Vatos&#x27; Tribute to Halloween, Featuring Former Members of Oingo Boingo&quot;, Hernandez later titled the band &quot;Johnny Vatos Oingo Boingo Dance Party&quot; and then &quot;Oingo Boingo Former Members&quot;. Since 2015, Elfman has endorsed the group as the authorized Oingo Boingo tribute band, and given Hernandez exclusive rights to use the names &#x27;Boingo&#x27; and &#x27;Oingo Boingo&#x27;.

The tribute band is joined intermittently by former Oingo Boingo members such as Steve Bartek, Carl Graves, John Avila, and Sam &quot;Sluggo&quot; Phipps, while vocals are usually provided by singer Brendan McCreary. During the 2006 Halloween season, there were two &quot;Johnny &#x27;Vatos&#x27; Tribute to Halloween&quot; shows: one in Los Angeles, and one in Orange County, California, with Vatos, Bartek, Avila, Phipps, and Legacy.

<text>The Battle of Ciudad Real was fought on 27 March 1809 and resulted in a French victory under General Sebastiani against the Spanish under General Conde de Cartojal.

==Background==
The Spanish campaign in early 1809 started with the Battle of Uclés.

==Battle==
French 4th Corps (with attached Polish division under general Valance) had to cross the bridge over the Guadiana River which was defended by the Spanish corps of Count Urbina Cartaojal. Polish lancers of the Legion of the Vistula under colonel Jan Konopka charged through the bridge taking it by surprise, then outflanked Spanish infantry and attacked it from behind as the main French and Polish forces crossed the bridge, and attacked the Spanish front lines.

The battle was over when undisciplined Spanish soldiers dispersed, and began to retreat in the direction of Santa Cruz.
Józef Rudnicki, adjutant-major of the 4th Infantry Regiment of the Legion, described the battle in his diaries (spelling according to the original):

as soon as the French regiments of the 4th Corps met our division, we rushed immediately toward the Consuegra and Ciudad Real, before of which town we found the Spanish corps, waiting for us on good positions. We were outnumbered, but thanks to the rational orders of the general Sebastiani, in some od four hours on 27 March 1809 the Spaniards were defeated and dispersed. They were retreating in chaos toward Almagro, where the Order of Calatrava has its home, and toward the Santa Cruz de Mudela, and even further, into the Sierramorena Mountains.

==Results==
The Spanish corps lost some 2000 men killed or wounded and many more were taken prisoner. After the battle the count of Cartojal was deprived of command for incompetency, and replaced by general Venegas, hero of the Spanish War of Independence, and later the viceroy of New Spain.

==Aftermath==
The Spanish campaign in early 1809 proceeded with the first Madrid offensive in the Battle of Medellín.

<doc id="157378" wikidata="Q747386" url="?curid=157378" title="Battle of Craonne">
<text>The Battle of Craonne (7 March 1814) was a battle between an Imperial French army under Emperor Napoleon I opposing a combined army of Imperial Russians and Prussians led by Prussian Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher. The War of the Sixth Coalition engagement began when the bulk of Napoleon&#x27;s army tried to drive Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov&#x27;s 22,000 Russians off the Chemin des Dames plateau to the west of Craonne. After a bitter struggle, Napoleon&#x27;s attacks compelled Vorontsov&#x27;s force to withdraw, but French casualties exceeded Russian losses. While the battle raged, Blücher&#x27;s attempt to turn Napoleon&#x27;s east flank ended in failure due to poor planning.

In late February 1814, Blücher&#x27;s army separated from the main Allied army of Austrian field marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, moving northwest and making a dash at Paris. Napoleon left Marshal Jacques MacDonald with one army to observe Schwarzenberg and started after Blücher with another army. Blücher evaded Napoleon&#x27;s attempt to trap him and retreated north toward Laon, picking up reinforcements as he went. Russian forces under Ferdinand von Wintzingerode and a Prussian corps led by Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Bülow would soon give Blücher a huge numerical advantage over the French. Napoleon came into contact with Vorontsov&#x27;s corps on the evening of 6 March, believing that he had Blücher on the run. The next contest would be the Battle of Laon on 9–10 March.
Craonne is located southeast of Laon and about northeast of Paris.

==Background==
===Operations===
On 22 February 1814, Schwarzenberg with nearly 150,000 Allied troops faced Napoleon with half that number at Troyes. Because bad news arrived from the south and the Allied army was poorly supplied, but mainly because he believed that he was outnumbered, Schwarzenberg ordered a retreat that evening. Disappointed that no battle was going to be fought, Blücher proposed that his army separate from the main army and operate to the north. To this Schwarzenberg agreed and Blücher&#x27;s 53,000 soldiers began moving northwest. When he realized that the Prussian field marshal&#x27;s army was headed for Paris, Napoleon left 42,000 troops under Marshal Jacques MacDonald to contain Schwarzenberg and marched after Blücher with 35,000 men. An additional 10,000 soldiers under Marshals Auguste de Marmont and Édouard Mortier stood between the Prussian field marshal and Paris.

Marmont and Mortier blocked Blücher&#x27;s advance on 28 February when they defeated Friedrich von Kleist&#x27;s corps in the Battle of Gué-à-Tresmes. The following day, Blücher again failed to push the reinforced French out of his path, but time had run out. On 2 March the Prussian field marshal realized that Napoleon was following him and decided to retreat to the north bank of the Ourcq River. He knew that Wintzingerode&#x27;s Russians and Bülow&#x27;s Prussians were nearby and hoped to join them soon. The premature surrender of Soissons allowed Blücher to more easily cross to the north bank of the Aisne River on 3–4 March. By this time Napoleon knew that Wintzingerode had joined Blücher, giving him at least 70,000 men to oppose 48,000 French troops. However, the French emperor believed that Bülow was still well to the north near Avesnes-sur-Helpe.

===Pre-battle maneuvers===
In fact, Blücher may have had as many as 110,000 troops by this time. They were distributed as follows – Russians: Wintzingerode (30,000), Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron (26,000), Fabian Gottlieb von Osten-Sacken (13,700); Prussians: Bülow (16,900), Kleist (10,600), Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg (13,500). For his part, Napoleon had 34,233 troops on 2 March while Marmont and Mortier had been reinforced to 17,000 men but lost possibly 3,000 casualties in the week before Craonne. Yet, Napoleon hoped to get to Laon before Blücher&#x27;s army arrived there. On 5 March, Napoleon was at Fismes from where he hoped to move straight north to Laon. Since he lacked a pontoon bridge to cross the Aisne, the French emperor directed his forces to move northeast to Berry-au-Bac where there was a stone bridge. Berry-au-Bac was on the direct road from Reims to Laon. On this day, Napoleon ordered Jan Willem Janssens at Mézières to gather up the Ardennes garrisons and operate in Blücher&#x27;s rear areas. Janssens promptly obeyed and the movements of his troops threw a scare into the Allies.

At 5:00 am on 5 March, Guard cavalry divisions under Pierre David de Colbert-Chabanais and Louis Marie Levesque de Laferrière surprised and captured Reims and its Allied garrison. Napoleon ordered Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty to seize Berry-au-Bac with a cavalry force consisting of Rémi Joseph Isidore Exelmans&#x27; division and Louis Michel Pac&#x27;s brigade. At the Battle of Berry-au-Bac, Nansouty&#x27;s troopers overran some Russian cavalry and captured 200 men and two guns, but the main prize was their seizure of the bridge. Louis Friant&#x27;s 1st Old Guard Division and Claude Marie Meunier&#x27;s 1st Young Guard Division crossed and occupied positions as far north as Corbeny. From 3:00–6:00 pm on 5 March, Marmont and Mortier tried to capture Soissons from its Russian garrison, but were repulsed. The Russians sustained 1,056 casualties, while the French lost 800–900 men. Another source calculated French losses as 1,500 men.

Blücher realized that Napoleon was trying to reach Laon by the Reims road. He sent Bülow and his wagon trains back to Laon. The Prussian commander began to shift his other forces to the northeast. By 6 March Napoleon had 30,500 men near Berry-au-Bac. He planned to send an advanced guard north toward Festieux, but needed to make sure of Blücher&#x27;s intentions. During the day of 6 March, Meunier&#x27;s division encountered Russian forces near Vauclair Abbey (Vauclerc) while two battalions of the Old Guard were needed to flush out Craonne&#x27;s Russian defenders. At first Blücher directed his army to concentrate near Craonne, but he decided that position was too cramped for his 90,000 men. He also heard that French cavalry were advancing north on the Reims road. Changing plans, Blücher planned to assemble 10,000 cavalry and 60 horse artillery guns under Wintzingerode and send it toward Festieux. Wintzingerode&#x27;s force consisted of 5,500 of his own horsemen plus all of the reserve cavalry belonging to Langeron and Yorck. Blücher ordered Wintzingerode&#x27;s infantry, commanded by Vorontsov, to remain behind and directly oppose Napoleon&#x27;s army.

===6 March===
By 5:00 pm on 6 March, Meunier captured Vauclair Abbey from the Russians. Meunier and the Old Guard battalions captured Heurtebise Farm several times, but its Russian defenders threw them out each time and remained in possession of the place. The Russian forces involved were the 13th and 14th Jäger Regiments. That evening, Meunier withdrew a little to the north while the Old Guards occupied part of the Chemin des Dames ridge that they seized. Pierre François Xavier Boyer&#x27;s division was at Bouconville in support of Meunier, one Old Guard brigade was at Craonne and the other was at Corbeny, Exelmans&#x27; horsemen were at Craonnelle and Joseph Boyer de Rébeval&#x27;s division was at La Ville-aux-Bois-lès-Pontavert. The divisions of Colbert, Laferrière, Philibert Jean-Baptiste Curial, Henri François Marie Charpentier and Nicolas-François Roussel d&#x27;Hurbal were at Berry-au-Bac. Still south of the Aisne were Mortier at Cormicy, Jean-Toussaint Arrighi de Casanova at Roucy and Marmont more distant at Braine. With him, Mortier had the infantry divisions of Charles-Joseph Christiani and Paul-Jean-Baptiste Poret de Morvan and the cavalry division of Jean-Marie Defrance.

Blücher planned to have Vorontsov defend against a French attack on the Chemin des Dames ridge, while Sacken remained in support farther west at Braye-en-Laonnois. While Napoleon was facing Vorontsov, Wintzingerode&#x27;s cavalry, followed by Kleist, York and Langeron, would move east on the north side of the Ailette River, then strike Napoleon&#x27;s right flank and rear. Wintzingerode&#x27;s cavalry was supposed to gather at Filain before setting out on its march and was expected to arrive at Festieux at dawn. One difficulty was that Wintzingerode&#x27;s horsemen would first have to move west along the Chemin des Dames ridge to reach Filain. When Wintzingerode arrived at Filain during the night, he found that the cavalrymen of Yorck and Langeron were already in camp with their horses unsaddled. In the circumstances, Wintzingerode decided to wait until daybreak to start on his march, but he neglected to order a reconnaissance of the roads.

===7 March: Plans===
The Chemin des Dames (Ladies&#x27; Road) starts on the Soissons-Laon road and runs east along a continuous ridge to Craonne and then loses elevation before rising again a little at Corbeny. The ridge has an average height of above the Aisne valley on the south. North of the Ailette there is more ground of a similar elevation. The slope was wooded and steeper on the north side where the marshy Ailette ran west before joining the Oise River. The ridge varies from to in width. It is narrow in the places where ravines encroach from north and south. The Russian position was naturally strong because the ridge in front was narrow and easily targeted with artillery fire. North of the narrows were the Marion Woods while the Quatre Heures Woods were to the south. The ridge was steep on the right flank but even more so on the left. The disadvantage on the left flank was that the slope was so steep that it provided the French with &quot;dead ground&quot; or places where they could approach without coming under cannon fire.

At 8:00 am on 7 March, Vorontsov deployed his corps facing east in three lines, spaced apart. The first Russian line was long and a distance of west of Heurtebise Farm. The first line consisted of 14 battalions of Nikolay Vasilyevich Vuich&#x27;s 24th Division, Mikhail Ponset&#x27;s brigade of the 14th Division and the 13th Jägers. On the right of the first line were the Pavlograd Hussars and four Cossack regiments under Alexander Christoforovich Benkendorf. The 14th Jägers held the Heurtebise Farm and drew up in skirmish formation in front of the first line. The advance force was led by Afanasy Ivanovich Krasovsky and included two squadrons of the Pavlograd Hussars on the jägers&#x27; right. The village of Ailles on the left flank was held by skirmishers.

The Russian second line was made up of the seven battalions of Vasily Laptiev&#x27;s 21st Division. The third line under Pavel Aleksandrovich Stroganov comprised nine battalions in Nikolay Nikolaevich Hovansky&#x27;s 12th Division and Sergey Fyodorovich Zheltukhin&#x27;s brigade of 13th Division. Nikolay Diomidovich Myakinin commanded the corps artillery which deployed 12 heavy and 24 light guns in the center under Colonel Vinspar. The 12 guns of Horse Artillery Battery Nr. 11 were on the right flank and the 12 guns of Horse Battery Nr. 9 were on the left. Six guns of Heavy Foot Battery Nr. 28 were of the left of the second line dominating the slope on the left. There were 24 light and six heavy guns held in reserve. During the battle 18 guns from the reserve were brought forward as replacements while 12 guns were used during the retreat. Since 1811 Russian artillery batteries each numbered 12 field pieces.

According to one authority, Vorontsov commanded roughly 16,300 infantry, 1,000 regular cavalry, 1,000 Cossacks and 96 artillery pieces. Farther east at Cerny-en-Laonnois were 4,000 regular cavalry led by Ilarion Vasilievich Vasilshikov and 1,500 Cossacks under Akim Akimovich Karpov. This cavalry force was part of Sacken&#x27;s command. Sacken&#x27;s infantry was posted too far east to help Vorontsov. A second source credited Vorontsov with 16,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry and 96 guns, plus Vasilshikov&#x27;s 4,000 horsemen.

Napoleon had 23,573 infantry and 6,350 cavalry available, plus 102 guns. However, the 8,000 men from the Guard divisions of Christiani and Poret de Morvan were not destined to be used. One historian credited Napoleon with 30,000 troops and the Allies with 50,000. Napoleon planned to launch a frontal assault on Vorontsov&#x27;s Russians, using Marshal Claude Perrin Victor&#x27;s corps and Curial&#x27;s division. These formations were to be assisted by Friant&#x27;s division and the reserve artillery. On the French right flank Marshal Michel Ney would lead the divisions of Meunier and Pierre Boyer to attack. On the left, Nansouty was instructed to lead Exelmans and Pac to turn the Russian flank. By 8:00 am, Napoleon was aware that his enemies intended to fight.

===7 March: Fighting===
At 9:00 am, the French Imperial Guard artillery unlimbered on the east end of the Chemin des Dames ridge and opened fire. The Russian artillery replied, but the range was , too long to inflict much damage on either side. Blucher was with Vorontsov until 10:00 am when he rode off to learn the whereabouts of Wintzingerode&#x27;s column. Ney had been told to wait for the order to attack, but the bombardment caused him to send his troops forward. He ordered Pierre Boyer to attack Ailles with Meunier advancing on his left. One account stated that Curial&#x27;s division operated with Meunier&#x27;s troops from the beginning. Napoleon was partly responsible for Ney&#x27;s blunder because he did not explain his battle plan to the marshal. Sending his men into the attack without artillery support was Ney&#x27;s fault alone. The soldiers of both Meunier and Pierre Boyer were stopped in their tracks by the Russian cannons. Boyer de Rébeval&#x27;s division arrived on the field at 11:00 am, but Charpentier&#x27;s division was slowed by sleet-covered roads.

At about 11:00 am Heurtebise Farm burst into flame and was abandoned. Vorontsov ordered Krasovsky&#x27;s advanced troops to pull back to the main line. The 2nd Jäger Regiment from the second line moved forward and occupied Ailles. Because of Ney&#x27;s premature attack, Boyer de Rébeval&#x27;s division had to be diverted from the main attack to support the right flank. At 11:30 am, Ney&#x27;s artillery began pounding the Russian left flank and Ney personally led Meunier&#x27;s men forward to the top of the slope. Nansouty advanced up the Paissy spur and pushed back the cavalry on the Russian right flank despite being charged by three Cossack regiments and four squadrons of hussars led by Benkendorf. At noon, Boyer de Rébeval attacked and seized the Marion Woods. Early in the action, a bullet hit Victor in the thigh, putting him out of action. On the Russian side, Krasovsky was also quickly wounded and compelled to leave the field. Boyer de Rébeval&#x27;s advance was carried out by Auguste Julien Bigarré&#x27;s brigade with Jacques Lecapitaine&#x27;s brigade in reserve. They were supported by six batteries of Guard artillery plus 12 their own guns. Since Boyer de Rébeval&#x27;s men were raw conscripts with only 20 days of service their musketry and cannon fire was not very effective.

By 1:00 pm, the Russians threatened to drive the troops of Meunier and Boyer de Rébeval off the ridge. Boyer de Rébeval brought up Lecapitaine&#x27;s brigade on Bigarré&#x27;s left. Vorontsov committed Andrey Savvich Glebov&#x27;s brigade from the third line into the fight. The 19th Jäger and Shirvan Infantry Regiments pressed forward but Antoine Drouot moved up two Guard artillery batteries and their fire halted the Russian attack. At 1:30 pm Napoleon ordered Emmanuel de Grouchy to commit his cavalry in an effort to get the attack moving. Grouchy sent Louis Ernest Joseph Sparre&#x27;s dragoon brigade forward. Sparre&#x27;s troopers drove off the Pavlograd Hussars and then swept into Parkinson&#x27;s Horse Artillery Battery Nr. 9, cutting down the gunners. Both Grouchy and Sparre were wounded and the dragoons were forced to retreat. Boyer de Rébeval&#x27;s division fell back into the Marion Woods where it rallied.

At 1:45 pm, Laferrière&#x27;s 3rd Guard Cavalry Division charged the large Russian battery in the center. The elite horsemen got among the cannons but were unable to break the Russian foot soldiers behind the guns, who were formed in squares. Laferrière was badly wounded and his horsemen were met by intense fire. However, by the time the Russians forced the Guard cavalry to retire, Charpentier&#x27;s division reached the field and easily captured the Quatre Heures Woods. They were soon followed by Curial&#x27;s division. By 2:30 pm, Charpentier&#x27;s troops linked up with Nansouty&#x27;s horsemen on the French left and together they began to force back the Russian right flank. Nansouty reached the end of the Paissy valley before being turned back by cannon fire. By this time Ney had brought Meunier&#x27;s division onto the ridge and the Guard artillery moved forward. Pierre Boyer reported seeing an Allied force to the north; this was Kleist&#x27;s corps moving east.

That morning, having failed to reconnoiter the roads, Winzingerode selected a bad route. Meanwhile, Kleist selected a more direct route and the two columns crossed at Chevregny at 11:00 am, causing a traffic jam. Kleist finally arrived at Festieux at 4:00 pm. Blücher caught up with Winzingerode at 2:00 pm at Bruyères-et-Montbérault and realized there was no chance to carry out the intended attack on Napoleon&#x27;s east flank. Anxious that Sacken and Vorontsov were in danger, Blücher ordered those generals to retreat. Sacken received his orders at 3:00 pm. He instructed his cavalry to assist Vorontsov and sent his infantry north toward Laon. Vorontsov withdrew 22 dismounted guns and his wounded. He formed his infantry into a checkerboard of mutually-supporting squares and began to retreat to the west on the Chemin des Dames plateau.

At 2:30 pm Napoleon decided to launch the decisive blow. The reserve artillery was brought forward and placed in battery beside the guns belonging to Victor&#x27;s divisions and the Guard. Under the orders of Drouot, 88 guns pummeled the Russian infantry with grapeshot. The divisions of Friant and Curial pressed forward, supported by cavalry. By 3:00 pm, the 2nd and 6th Jäger Regiments abandoned Ailles to Pierre Boyer&#x27;s division. Napoleon appointed Augustin Daniel Belliard to replace the wounded Grouchy and switched the cavalry divisions of Roussel d&#x27;Hurbal and Colbert to the French left flank. Earlier, Napoleon asked Charpentier to take command of Victor&#x27;s corps. Four French cannons astride the main road were particularly effective in punishing the withdrawing Russian infantry.

The Russians fell back in good order to a position southwest of Ailles. At 4:00 pm Vorontsov withdrew again to the hamlet of Troyan near Cerny. Alexey Petrovich Nikitin prepared an ambush with 36 guns from Sacken&#x27;s corps. When the 6th Jägers fell back through their position, Nikitin&#x27;s guns opened a deadly fire on the pursuing French. Vasilshikov&#x27;s cavalry intervened just as Benkendorf&#x27;s horsemen were on the verge of being overwhelmed by the cavalry of Exelmans, Pac and Laferrière. Seeing Colbert&#x27;s horsemen swarming around several Russian infantry squares, Vasilshikov ordered Sergey Nicolaevich Lanskoy to lead the Mariopol and Alexandria Hussar Regiments to charge. This attack drove off Colbert&#x27;s troopers but the Russian hussars were in turn driven back by Nansouty&#x27;s cavalrymen. Vasilshiov sent forward three dragoon regiments and Nansouty&#x27;s cavalrymen were stopped as Lanskoy&#x27;s hussars rallied in the rear.

The Russians retired to another position on the Chemin des Dames plateau before crossing the Ailette at Chevregny. The French artillery took the crossing under fire and caused some confusion and loss, but Vorontsov&#x27;s corps got safely away to the north bank. Since other Allied forces were in the area, the French pursuit ended about 7:00–8:00 pm. The French army bivouacked along the Chemin des Dames ridge as follows: Charpentier&#x27;s infantry and the Guard cavalry at Filain, Colbert at Aizy-Jouy, Belliard at Ostel, Ney to the north of Ostel, Napoleon, Mortier and the Guard infantry at Braye-en-Laonnois. Étienne Tardif de Pommeroux de Bordesoulle&#x27;s cavalry camped at Heurtebise Farm to establish a link with Marmont&#x27;s corps at Berry-au-Bac.

==Result==
One historian stated that the Russians lost 5,000 while the French counted 5,500 casualties. A second authority placed French casualties between 5,400 and 8,000, while the Russians admitted losing 4,785 killed, wounded and missing. A third source broke down the Russian casualties into 1,529 dead and 3,256 wounded, while giving French losses as 8,000. General-Major Lanskoy was mortally wounded; Generalmajor Sergey Nikolaevich Ushakov II of the Courland Dragoon Regiment and Colonel Parkinson of the artillery were killed. General-Leutnant Laptiev and Generalmajors Hovansky, Glebov, Feodor Vasilyevich Zvarykin and Andrey Timofeevich Maslov were wounded. The Pavlograd Hussars lost 22 officers killed or wounded, the 13th Jägers lost 16 officers and 400 men and the Shirvan Infantry Regiment lost half its numbers. On the French side, Marshal Victor and Generals of Division Grouchy, Laferrière and Boyer de Rébeval were wounded as were Generals of Brigade Bigarré and Lecapitaine. Boyer de Rébeval&#x27;s division suffered losses of two out of three men. Neither side lost a cannon or a color. The 14th Voltigeurs, which was made up of French soldiers from Joseph Bonaparte&#x27;s disbanded Spanish Guard, lost 32 officers and was virtually annihilated.

According to two historians, Craonne was a Pyrrhic victory because the French held the battlefield at the day&#x27;s end, but their other objectives were not attained. Napoleon hoped to march rapidly to Laon and get there ahead of Blücher. In the event, the effort involved to drive off Vorontsov caused the French army to be spread out toward Soissons, rather than toward Laon. Napoleon had hoped to easily dispose of Vorontsov&#x27;s corps, but found that he had to fight a major battle. Instead of cutting off Blücher from Laon, Napoleon had to pursue the Allied army directly. If Blücher had added Sacken&#x27;s infantry to Vorontsov&#x27;s corps, Napoleon might well have been beaten. Napoleon believed that the Allied army was fleeing from him in confusion, but this was not the case. Napoleon&#x27;s army would sustain a defeat in the Battle of Laon on 9–10 March and be lucky not to suffer even worse damage.

<text>The Battle of Denain was fought on 24 July 1712 as part of the War of the Spanish Succession. It resulted in a French victory, under Marshal Villars, against Dutch and Austrian forces, under Prince Eugene of Savoy.

It was the war&#x27;s last battle in Flanders and one of the most consequential, breaking the Grand Alliance&#x27;s ability to threaten Paris and reversing nearly two years of French territorial losses. In itself a local and tactical victory, Denain was made decisive by its relentless exploitation by Villars, who skillfully maneuvered to reclaim strategic border fortifications that would blunt any allied effort to renew their advance on Paris and dictate peace terms to Louis XIV.

==Background==

The War of Spanish Succession had raged since 1701. After over a decade of war, France was in a dark period, both financially and militarily. The early victories of Marshal Villars at the Battle of Friedlingen and the Battle of Höchstadt were followed by numerous defeats to the Allied forces, most notably the armies under Prince Eugene of Savoy and the Duke of Marlborough. In 1708, after the rout of Oudenaarde, nearly all the strongholds of northern France were under the control of the Austro-Dutch-British coalition. There was also an economic crisis, and the winter of 1708-1709 was one of the most rigorous of the 18th century, leading to famine and high mortality.

The command of the French northern army went to Marshal Villars in 1709, who wasted no time in reorganising its demoralised forces. When the Allied campaign led by Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough engaged the French at Malplaquet, Villars was wounded and the French retreated from the field, but the Allies suffered twice as many casualties and their campaign soon sputtered out. France&#x27;s precarious position had been stabilized, the Allies were unable to achieve their goal of forcing harsh terms on the Bourbons and the war continued. In Britain the anti-war Tories managed to gain power in 1710 and were increasingly prepared to agree terms with French negotiators. Despite this the 1711 campaign saw Marlborough enjoy further success by leading his army through the lines Ne Plus Ultra and capturing Bouchain, a key fortress in northern France.

Marlborough had fallen out of favour with Queen Anne and his political opponents manoeuvred to have him dismissed as Captain General in December 1711.

==Prelude==
===Disunity in the Allied leadership===
In the first months of 1712, the War of the Spanish Succession was marked by disunity among the Grand Alliance. As a result of the 1710 British general election, the Whigs had been swept from power in Great Britain and replaced by the Tories, who were opposed to further involvement in the conflict. The Tory Harley ministry accused the Duke of Marlborough and his fellow Whig politicians of war profiteering; as a result, Marlborough, who had led the Allied armies in the Low Countries since 1702 was removed from office by Queen Anne under Tory pressure.

The Tories were also hostile towards the Dutch Republic, who they did not trust. In his 1711 work &quot;The Conduct of the Allies&quot;, Tory pamphleteer Jonathan Swift argued that the Dutch were ungrateful allies and a threat to Britain. Swift wrote that the Dutch were in &quot;a condition to strike terror into us, with 50,000 veterans ready to invade us from the country which we have conquered for them&quot;. When the Tory-dominated British House of Commons passed a resolution criticising the Dutch for not fulfilling prior agreements with Britain, Dutch statesman Anthonie Heinsius and his fellow &quot;regenten&quot; were outraged. The Dutch issued a reply to the resolution wherein they refuted Tory criticisms point by point, greatly embarrassing the Harley ministry.

Such disputes did not stop the Harley ministry from continuing secret peace negotiations with France. To keep their allies in the dark and maintain a strong negotiating position with France, the Harley ministry decided to participate in a new campaign in 1712, if only superficially. The Duke of Ormonde was chosen by the Harley ministry to command British troops in the Low Countries for this campaign. Although Ormonde was a veteran commander who had served under William III of England in the Nine Years&#x27; War, he was relatively inexperienced. Tory statesman Lord Oxford saw this as an advantage, as he could therefore control him more easily. Ormonde had been given secret instructions to frustrate the Allied war effort as much as possible, which would make the Dutch and Austrians more inclined to seek peace. However, the Dutch States General had no intention of allowing Ormonde to lead their army. They asked the Austrians to send Eugene of Savoy back to the Dutch Republic instead. The Austrians agreed to this and also sent an additional 20,000 men. 

===Beginning of the campaign===

The Duke of Marlborough, having conquered Bouchain in the previous year, had left most of his troops to occupy the outermost border towns, so that the French would be prevented from building up lines to cover their remaining lands during the winter. This prompted a plan in The Hague to burn down a large hay storehouse, set up by the French within Arras. This would prevent Villars from getting his armies into the field early in the year and allow Eugene to lay siege to Arras or Cambrai without the threat of a French army. On 2 and 3 March 1712 an Allied army under Arnold van Keppel, Earl of Albemarle closed in on Arras and bombarded the town. The action was a major success, but the advantage had to go entirely unused because the Emperor&#x27;s troops arrived too late to the Allied army. Villars had by then already assembled his army in the plain between Cambrai and Arras. 

In June, Prince Eugene besieged and captured Le Quesnoy. The Duke of Ormonde withdrew his forces during the siege, leading to a rift between the British and the rest of the Allies. In line with their prior agreement with the French, Ormonde removed his men towards Dunkirk. However, the 25,000–30,000 German and Danish troops in British pay refused to leave and declared to the Dutch field deputies that they would not leave the Allied army until they had received further orders from their respective sovereigns. The field deputies promised them that the Dutch Republic would pay them instead. Despite the absence of British troops, this meant that the Allies could still continue their offensive and Eugene and Count Tilly concluded the siege of Le Quesnoy succesfully.

Once the Allies were assured of the support of the auxiliary troops that had previously served under the English, they decided the fortress of Landrecies would be the next target. Ordinarily, they would have first captured Valenciennes to secure their supply lines, ensuring a more secure siege of the city. However, the political situation left the Dutch-Imperial army with limited time to break through the French line of fortresses, compelling them to take greater risks. The Allied army&#x27;s supply lines were exceedingly long and ran dangerously close to the French positions. Defending these extended lines required the army to be fragmented. 

The Dutch-Imperial army comprised 122 battalions and 273 squadrons. Although Villars initially commanded a larger force with 139 battalions and 249 squadrons, the situation shifted in favour of the Allies. As the defending party, Villars had to allocate 40 battalions to garrison various fortress towns. Additionally, to safeguard the interior from raids, like the one of Grovestins, he was compelled to detach 36 squadrons. Prince of Anhalt-Dessau encircled Landrecies with 34 battalions and 30 squadrons, while the main Allied force was positioned between Fontaine au Bois and Thiant. Some troops were reserved for guarding the supply line that went from Landrecies to Marchiennes.

A corps of 10 battalions and 23 squadrons under Albemarle was stationed at Denain, a fortified encampment, and not a fortress as was typically the case. It was only equipped with field fortifications that were no match for the overwhelming numerical superiority Albemarle would face. Due to the hard ground, it lacked high ramparts or a deep moat, had no outer ditch, and—perhaps most critically, despite what the painting by Jean Alaux suggest—was without a palisade. The retrenchment had been constructed to guard against sorties from Valenciennes and against smaller enemy raids. It does not appear that Albemarle and Eugene had anticipated facing a large enemy force or an entire army. Only a single pontoon bridge connected Albemarle’s encampment to the right bank of the Scheldt. Since the English had taken their bridging equipment with them, Albemarle had to provide the materials for a second pontoon bridge to the main army. The wooden bridge he planned as a replacement was still unfinished when the French arrived.

==Battle sequence==

After a detailed examination of the enemy dispositions, Villars decided in the greatest secrecy to attack Denain. Elements of the French cavalry were sent to seize the various bridges crossing the river Selle, which ran through le Cateau to join the Scheldt opposite Denain. During the evening, a French detachment also took up positions around a mill at Haspres, blocking the river that crossed there. That night, the French infantry began to march towards Prince Eugene&#x27;s forces at Landrecies. In response to the threat, Prince Eugene reinforced Landrecies, weakening the Allied right wing, under the Earl of Albemarle, which held Denain.

At dawn, however, Villars swung the line of advance of his army and aimed it behind the cover of the Selle in three columns at Denain. At five o&#x27;clock in the morning, Villars and his principal lieutenants drew up their plan of attack at Avesnes-le-Sec. They chose the windmill there as a vantage point for observation of the surrounding lowland. 24,000 French infantry would attack the 8,500 strong Dutch garrison of Denain. At seven o’clock, the French infantrymen reached Neuville-sur-Escaut and were immediately ordered to seize the bridges across the Scheldt. At eight o’clock, the Allies were surprised to discover the large French presence in the area. The Earl of Albemarle, at the head of the Dutch garrison in and around Denain, warned Prince Eugene, but the Prince of Savoy was then not greatly concerned. By one o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, the attack had already been started. The French sappers led the infantry against heavy fire and took Denain at the point of the bayonet. Many defenders were killed, and the remaining Dutch infantry attempted to escape across the mill bridge. However, it collapsed during the retreat, and hundreds of Allied troops drowned.

Realising the gravity of the situation, Prince Eugene attempted to force his way across the Scheldt at Prouvy to help Albemarle. Under the command of the Prince de Tingry, French regiments held the bridge at Prouvy against repeated Austrian attacks. Finally, as the day drew to a close, the French destroyed the bridge to prevent it falling into the hands of the enemy. That left the Prince of Savoy&#x27;s army blocked on the left flank by the Scheldt, and the Allies could not counterattack to retake Denain. There, Albemarle and his staff were taken prisoner, together with some 4,100 troops. The Allies suffered 6,500 to 8,000 losses, mostly borne by the Dutch, while French casualties were 500 to 2,100.

==Aftermath==
The battle was not immediately recognised to be as decisive as it turned out to be; most of Prince Eugene&#x27;s army was relatively unscathed. However, with the loss of Denain, the Allied position began to unravel, and over the next few months, the French recovered Le Quesnoy, Marchines, Douai, and Bouchain.

Almost immediately, Villars began a siege of the key allied supply base at Marchiennes, whose 100 cannon fell into French hands along with up to 9,000 prisoners and large volumes of stores and equipment. This movement threatened Eugene&#x27;s line of communications, compelling the Austrians to lift the siege of Landrecies and retire north. Villars responded by seizing Douai (31 July) and Le Quesnoy (8 October) after short sieges. The loss of Le Quesnoy alone cost the Allies 3,000 killed or wounded. Villars next moved against Bouchain, the site of Marlborough&#x27;s last triumph, taking the city 19 October. This had the effect of reestablishing the &quot;&quot;, the vital double-line of fortifications protecting Paris, dashing any remaining allied hopes of bringing Louis XIV to terms by a march on the French capital.

When news of the victory reached Versailles the court erupted in an outpouring of joy; Louis XIV was reportedly so moved that, for the first time in his sixty-year reign, the monarch thanked his courtiers for their support.

With Louis XIV&#x27;s realm secure, the decade-long war in Flanders came to a close. Few other theatres held comparable promise for advancing the Allied war aims: in the Alps, Marshal Berwick with some 35,000 men safely contained the opposing 50,000 Austrians and Savoyards; in Catalonia the Allies under Starhemberg were reeling after defeats at Brihuega and Villaviciosa; on the Portuguese frontier, the remaining Anglo-Portuguese army was falling back before a Spanish army under the Marquis de Bay, removing the last serious threat to Philip V&#x27;s succession; on the Rhine, the Duke of Württemberg could only bombard French lines, to which the French responded with cavalry raids into Germany before both sides settled into winter quarters.

Against this backdrop, the Dutch Estates General joined the British in negotiating a separate peace with Louis XIV, forcing Eugene to march the Imperial army back to Germany to continue the war in the Rhineland. When Villars and Eugene renewed operations in this new theatre the following season, the Frenchman again emerged victorious, taking the strongpoints of Freiburg and Landau and compelling the Emperor to sue for peace. The two men were then given power to negotiate a peace agreement and eventually drew up the terms of the Treaty of Rastatt which finally brought the last of the fighting to an end. Eugene&#x27;s reputation soon recovered when he won a major victory by defeating the Turks at the 1717 Siege of Belgrade.

<doc id="157381" wikidata="Q313731" url="?curid=157381" title="Archidamus II">
<text>Archidamus II ( ; died 427/6 BC) was a king of Sparta who reigned from approximately 469/8 BC to 427/6 BC. His father was Zeuxidamus (called Cyniscos by many Spartans). Zeuxidamus married and had a son, Archidamus. However, Zeuxidamus died before his father, Leotychidas.

After the death of his son and heir, Leotychidas married Eurydame, the sister of Menius and daughter of Diactorides. While they had no male offspring, they did have a daughter, Lampito, whom Leotychidas gave in marriage to his grandson Archidamus. They had a son Agis II.

Archidamus&#x27; later second marriage was to Eupolia. The Ephors objected to this union, arguing that due to Eupolia&#x27;s short stature, “She will bear us kinglets instead of kings”. He married her nonetheless and was for that fined by the Ephors.

To them were born a son, Agesilaus II, and a daughter, Cynisca.

==Rule==
Archidamus gained the Spartan throne after his grandfather, Leotychidas, was banished around 469 or 468 BC after being accused of bribery.

Archidamus was one of the kings of Sparta in the years preceding the Peloponnesian War. His coolness and presence of mind are said to have saved the Spartan state from destruction on the occasion of the great earthquake of 464 BC, but this story must be regarded as at least doubtful.

In 446 BC he reached agreement with Pericles on the Thirty Years&#x27; Peace between Athens and Sparta, bringing an end to the First Peloponnesian War, which had been raging since (with the possible exception of a 5-years peace established in 451 BC).

During the negotiations that preceded the Peloponnesian War, he did his best to prevent, or at least to postpone, the inevitable struggle, but was overruled by the war party. He invaded Attica at the head of the Peloponnesian forces in the summers of 431 BC, 430 BC and 428 BC, and in 429 BC conducted operations against Plataea. He died probably in 427 BC, certainly before the summer of 426 BC, and was succeeded on the Spartan throne by his son, Agis II.

==Quotes==
According to Thucydides in speeches attributed to Archidamus at the famous Debate at Sparta in 432 BC.

&quot;If we begin the war in haste, we&#x27;ll have many delays before we end it, owing to our lack of preparation.&quot;

<text>The Battle of Diersheim (20–21 April 1797) saw a French First Republic army led by Jean Victor Marie Moreau clash with a Habsburg army commanded by Anton Count Sztáray de Nagy-Mihaly. Though both sides suffered about 3,000 killed or wounded in the bitter fighting, the Austrians finally retreated with the loss of 2,000 prisoners and 13 artillery pieces. Austrian General Wilhelm von Immens was killed and Sztáray badly wounded. The combat at Diersheim was a waste of lives because Napoleon Bonaparte signed the Preliminaries of Leoben with Austria a few days earlier, calling for a truce. However, Moreau&#x27;s reputation was enhanced by his hard-won victory which occurred during the War of the First Coalition, part of the French Revolutionary Wars. Diersheim is one of a number of villages that make up the municipality of Rheinau. Diersheim lies one kilometer southwest of the Rhine River and about northeast of Kehl</text><links>
