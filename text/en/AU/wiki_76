<text>In fluid dynamics, turbulence or turbulent flow is fluid motion characterized by chaotic changes in pressure and flow velocity. It is in contrast to laminar flow, which occurs when a fluid flows in parallel layers with no disruption between those layers.

Turbulence is commonly observed in everyday phenomena such as surf, fast flowing rivers, billowing storm clouds, or smoke from a chimney, and most fluid flows occurring in nature or created in engineering applications are turbulent. Turbulence is caused by excessive kinetic energy in parts of a fluid flow, which overcomes the damping effect of the fluid&#x27;s viscosity. For this reason, turbulence is commonly realized in low viscosity fluids. In general terms, in turbulent flow, unsteady vortices appear of many sizes which interact with each other, consequently drag due to friction effects increases.

The onset of turbulence can be predicted by the dimensionless Reynolds number, the ratio of kinetic energy to viscous damping in a fluid flow. However, turbulence has long resisted detailed physical analysis, and the interactions within turbulence create a very complex phenomenon. Physicist Richard Feynman described turbulence as the most important unsolved problem in classical physics.

The turbulence intensity affects many fields, for examples fish ecology, air pollution, precipitation, and climate change.

== Examples of turbulence ==
* Smoke rising from a cigarette. For the first few centimeters, the smoke is laminar. The smoke plume becomes turbulent as its Reynolds number increases with increases in flow velocity and characteristic length scale.
* Flow over a golf ball. (This can be best understood by considering the golf ball to be stationary, with air flowing over it.) If the golf ball were smooth, the boundary layer flow over the front of the sphere would be laminar at typical conditions. However, the boundary layer would separate early, as the pressure gradient switched from favorable (pressure decreasing in the flow direction) to unfavorable (pressure increasing in the flow direction), creating a large region of low pressure behind the ball that creates high form drag. To prevent this, the surface is dimpled to perturb the boundary layer and promote turbulence. This results in higher skin friction, but it moves the point of boundary layer separation further along, resulting in lower drag.
*Clear-air turbulence experienced during airplane flight, as well as poor astronomical seeing (the blurring of images seen through the atmosphere).
* Most of the terrestrial atmospheric circulation.
* The oceanic and atmospheric mixed layers and intense oceanic currents.
* The flow conditions in many industrial equipment (such as pipes, ducts, precipitators, gas scrubbers, dynamic scraped surface heat exchangers, etc.) and machines (for instance, internal combustion engines and gas turbines).
* The external flow over all kinds of vehicles such as cars, airplanes, ships, and submarines.
* The motions of matter in stellar atmospheres.
* A jet exhausting from a nozzle into a quiescent fluid. As the flow emerges into this external fluid, shear layers originating at the lips of the nozzle are created. These layers separate the fast moving jet from the external fluid, and at a certain critical Reynolds number they become unstable and break down to turbulence.
* Biologically generated turbulence resulting from swimming animals affects ocean mixing.
* Snow fences work by inducing turbulence in the wind, forcing it to drop much of its snow load near the fence.
* Bridge supports (piers) in water. When river flow is slow, water flows smoothly around the support legs. When the flow is faster, a higher Reynolds number is associated with the flow. The flow may start off laminar but is quickly separated from the leg and becomes turbulent.
* In many geophysical flows (rivers, atmospheric boundary layer), the flow turbulence is dominated by the coherent structures and turbulent events. A turbulent event is a series of turbulent fluctuations that contain more energy than the average flow turbulence. The turbulent events are associated with coherent flow structures such as eddies and turbulent bursting, and they play a critical role in terms of sediment scour, accretion and transport in rivers as well as contaminant mixing and dispersion in rivers and estuaries, and in the atmosphere.

*In the medical field of cardiology, a stethoscope is used to detect heart sounds and bruits, which are due to turbulent blood flow. In normal individuals, heart sounds are a product of turbulent flow as heart valves close. However, in some conditions turbulent flow can be audible due to other reasons, some of them pathological. For example, in advanced atherosclerosis, bruits (and therefore turbulent flow) can be heard in some vessels that have been narrowed by the disease process.
* Recently, turbulence in porous media became a highly debated subject.
* Strategies used by animals for olfactory navigation, and their success, are heavily influenced by turbulence affecting the odor plume.
==Features==

Turbulence is characterized by the following features:

; Irregularity : Turbulent flows are always highly irregular. For this reason, turbulence problems are normally treated statistically rather than deterministically. Turbulent flow is chaotic. However, not all chaotic flows are turbulent.

; Diffusivity :The readily available supply of energy in turbulent flows tends to accelerate the homogenization (mixing) of fluid mixtures. The characteristic which is responsible for the enhanced mixing and increased rates of mass, momentum and energy transports in a flow is called &quot;diffusivity&quot;.

&quot;Turbulent diffusion&quot; is usually described by a turbulent diffusion coefficient. This turbulent diffusion coefficient is defined in a phenomenological sense, by analogy with the molecular diffusivities, but it does not have a true physical meaning, being dependent on the flow conditions, and not a property of the fluid itself. In addition, the turbulent diffusivity concept assumes a constitutive relation between a turbulent flux and the gradient of a mean variable similar to the relation between flux and gradient that exists for molecular transport. In the best case, this assumption is only an approximation. Nevertheless, the turbulent diffusivity is the simplest approach for quantitative analysis of turbulent flows, and many models have been postulated to calculate it. For instance, in large bodies of water like oceans this coefficient can be found using Richardson&#x27;s four-third power law and is governed by the random walk principle. In rivers and large ocean currents, the diffusion coefficient is given by variations of Elder&#x27;s formula.

;Rotationality :Turbulent flows have non-zero vorticity and are characterized by a strong three-dimensional vortex generation mechanism known as vortex stretching. In fluid dynamics, they are essentially vortices subjected to stretching associated with a corresponding increase of the component of vorticity in the stretching direction—due to the conservation of angular momentum. On the other hand, vortex stretching is the core mechanism on which the turbulence energy cascade relies to establish and maintain identifiable structure function. In general, the stretching mechanism implies thinning of the vortices in the direction perpendicular to the stretching direction due to volume conservation of fluid elements. As a result, the radial length scale of the vortices decreases and the larger flow structures break down into smaller structures. The process continues until the small scale structures are small enough that their kinetic energy can be transformed by the fluid&#x27;s molecular viscosity into heat. Turbulent flow is always rotational and three dimensional. For example, atmospheric cyclones are rotational but their substantially two-dimensional shapes do not allow vortex generation and so are not turbulent. On the other hand, oceanic flows are dispersive but essentially non rotational and therefore are not turbulent.

;Dissipation : To sustain turbulent flow, a persistent source of energy supply is required because turbulence dissipates rapidly as the kinetic energy is converted into internal energy by viscous shear stress. Turbulence causes the formation of eddies of many different length scales. Most of the kinetic energy of the turbulent motion is contained in the large-scale structures. The energy &quot;cascades&quot; from these large-scale structures to smaller scale structures by an inertial and essentially inviscid mechanism. This process continues, creating smaller and smaller structures which produces a hierarchy of eddies. Eventually this process creates structures that are small enough that molecular diffusion becomes important and viscous dissipation of energy finally takes place. The scale at which this happens is the Kolmogorov length scale.

Via this energy cascade, turbulent flow can be realized as a superposition of a spectrum of flow velocity fluctuations and eddies upon a mean flow. The eddies are loosely defined as coherent patterns of flow velocity, vorticity and pressure. Turbulent flows may be viewed as made of an entire hierarchy of eddies over a wide range of length scales and the hierarchy can be described by the energy spectrum that measures the energy in flow velocity fluctuations for each length scale (wavenumber). The scales in the energy cascade are generally uncontrollable and highly non-symmetric. Nevertheless, based on these length scales these eddies can be divided into three categories.
; Integral time scale
The integral time scale for a Lagrangian flow can be defined as:

: formula_1

where &quot;u&quot;′ is the velocity fluctuation, and formula_2 is the time lag between measurements.
; Integral length scales 
: Large eddies obtain energy from the mean flow and also from each other. Thus, these are the energy production eddies which contain most of the energy. They have the large flow velocity fluctuation and are low in frequency. Integral scales are highly anisotropic and are defined in terms of the normalized two-point flow velocity correlations. The maximum length of these scales is constrained by the characteristic length of the apparatus. For example, the largest integral length scale of pipe flow is equal to the pipe diameter. In the case of atmospheric turbulence, this length can reach up to the order of several hundreds kilometers.: The integral length scale can be defined as
:: formula_3
: where &quot;r&quot; is the distance between two measurement locations, and &quot;u&quot;′ is the velocity fluctuation in that same direction.
; Kolmogorov length scales : Smallest scales in the spectrum that form the viscous sub-layer range. In this range, the energy input from nonlinear interactions and the energy drain from viscous dissipation are in exact balance. The small scales have high frequency, causing turbulence to be locally isotropic and homogeneous.
; Taylor microscales : The intermediate scales between the largest and the smallest scales which make the inertial subrange. Taylor microscales are not dissipative scales, but pass down the energy from the largest to the smallest without dissipation. Some literatures do not consider Taylor microscales as a characteristic length scale and consider the energy cascade to contain only the largest and smallest scales; while the latter accommodate both the inertial subrange and the viscous sublayer. Nevertheless, Taylor microscales are often used in describing the term &quot;turbulence&quot; more conveniently as these Taylor microscales play a dominant role in energy and momentum transfer in the wavenumber space.

Although it is possible to find some particular solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations governing fluid motion, all such solutions are unstable to finite perturbations at large Reynolds numbers. Sensitive dependence on the initial and boundary conditions makes fluid flow irregular both in time and in space so that a statistical description is needed. The Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov proposed the first statistical theory of turbulence, based on the aforementioned notion of the energy cascade (an idea originally introduced by Richardson) and the concept of self-similarity. As a result, the Kolmogorov microscales were named after him. It is now known that the self-similarity is broken so the statistical description is presently modified.

A complete description of turbulence is one of the unsolved problems in physics. According to an apocryphal story, Werner Heisenberg was asked what he would ask God, given the opportunity. His reply was: &quot;When I meet God, I am going to ask him two questions: Why relativity? And why turbulence? I really believe he will have an answer for the first.&quot; A similar witticism has been attributed to Horace Lamb in a speech to the British Association for the Advancement of Science: &quot;I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids. And about the former I am rather more optimistic.&quot;

==Onset of turbulence==
The onset of turbulence can be, to some extent, predicted by the Reynolds number, which is the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces within a fluid which is subject to relative internal movement due to different fluid velocities, in what is known as a boundary layer in the case of a bounding surface such as the interior of a pipe. A similar effect is created by the introduction of a stream of higher velocity fluid, such as the hot gases from a flame in air. This relative movement generates fluid friction, which is a factor in developing turbulent flow. Counteracting this effect is the viscosity of the fluid, which as it increases, progressively inhibits turbulence, as more kinetic energy is absorbed by a more viscous fluid. The Reynolds number quantifies the relative importance of these two types of forces for given flow conditions, and is a guide to when turbulent flow will occur in a particular situation.

This ability to predict the onset of turbulent flow is an important design tool for equipment such as piping systems or aircraft wings, but the Reynolds number is also used in scaling of fluid dynamics problems, and is used to determine dynamic similitude between two different cases of fluid flow, such as between a model aircraft, and its full size version. Such scaling is not always linear and the application of Reynolds numbers to both situations allows scaling factors to be developed. 
A flow situation in which the kinetic energy is significantly absorbed due to the action of fluid molecular viscosity gives rise to a laminar flow regime. For this the dimensionless quantity the Reynolds number () is used as a guide.

With respect to laminar and turbulent flow regimes:

* laminar flow occurs at low Reynolds numbers, where viscous forces are dominant, and is characterized by smooth, constant fluid motion;
* turbulent flow occurs at high Reynolds numbers and is dominated by inertial forces, which tend to produce chaotic eddies, vortices and other flow instabilities.

The Reynolds number is defined as

:formula_4

where:
* is the density of the fluid (SI units: kg/m3)
* is a characteristic velocity of the fluid with respect to the object (m/s)
* is a characteristic linear dimension (m)
* is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (Pa·s or N·s/m2 or kg/(m·s)).

While there is no theorem directly relating the non-dimensional Reynolds number to turbulence, flows at Reynolds numbers larger than 5000 are typically (but not necessarily) turbulent, while those at low Reynolds numbers usually remain laminar. In Poiseuille flow, for example, turbulence can first be sustained if the Reynolds number is larger than a critical value of about 2040; moreover, the turbulence is generally interspersed with laminar flow until a larger Reynolds number of about 4000.

The transition occurs if the size of the object is gradually increased, or the viscosity of the fluid is decreased, or if the density of the fluid is increased.

==Heat and momentum transfer==
When flow is turbulent, particles exhibit additional transverse motion which enhances the rate of energy and momentum exchange between them thus increasing the heat transfer and the friction coefficient.

Assume for a two-dimensional turbulent flow that one was able to locate a specific point in the fluid and measure the actual flow velocity of every particle that passed through that point at any given time. Then one would find the actual flow velocity fluctuating about a mean value:

:formula_5

and similarly for temperature () and pressure (), where the primed quantities denote fluctuations superposed to the mean. This decomposition of a flow variable into a mean value and a turbulent fluctuation was originally proposed by Osborne Reynolds in 1895, and is considered to be the beginning of the systematic mathematical analysis of turbulent flow, as a sub-field of fluid dynamics. While the mean values are taken as predictable variables determined by dynamics laws, the turbulent fluctuations are regarded as stochastic variables.

The heat flux and momentum transfer (represented by the shear stress ) in the direction normal to the flow for a given time are

:formula_6

where is the heat capacity at constant pressure, is the density of the fluid, is the coefficient of turbulent viscosity and is the turbulent thermal conductivity.

==Kolmogorov&#x27;s theory of 1941==

Richardson&#x27;s notion of turbulence was that a turbulent flow is composed by &quot;eddies&quot; of different sizes. The sizes define a characteristic length scale for the eddies, which are also characterized by flow velocity scales and time scales (turnover time) dependent on the length scale. The large eddies are unstable and eventually break up originating smaller eddies, and the kinetic energy of the initial large eddy is divided into the smaller eddies that stemmed from it. These smaller eddies undergo the same process, giving rise to even smaller eddies which inherit the energy of their predecessor eddy, and so on. In this way, the energy is passed down from the large scales of the motion to smaller scales until reaching a sufficiently small length scale such that the viscosity of the fluid can effectively dissipate the kinetic energy into internal energy.

In his original theory of 1941, Kolmogorov postulated that for very high Reynolds numbers, the small-scale turbulent motions are statistically isotropic (i.e. no preferential spatial direction could be discerned). In general, the large scales of a flow are not isotropic, since they are determined by the particular geometrical features of the boundaries (the size characterizing the large scales will be denoted as ). Kolmogorov&#x27;s idea was that in the Richardson&#x27;s energy cascade this geometrical and directional information is lost, while the scale is reduced, so that the statistics of the small scales has a universal character: they are the same for all turbulent flows when the Reynolds number is sufficiently high.

Thus, Kolmogorov introduced a second hypothesis: for very high Reynolds numbers the statistics of small scales are universally and uniquely determined by the kinematic viscosity and the rate of energy dissipation . With only these two parameters, the unique length that can be formed by dimensional analysis is

:formula_7

This is today known as the Kolmogorov length scale (see Kolmogorov microscales).

A turbulent flow is characterized by a hierarchy of scales through which the energy cascade takes place. Dissipation of kinetic energy takes place at scales of the order of Kolmogorov length , while the input of energy into the cascade comes from the decay of the large scales, of order . These two scales at the extremes of the cascade can differ by several orders of magnitude at high Reynolds numbers. In between there is a range of scales (each one with its own characteristic length ) that has formed at the expense of the energy of the large ones. These scales are very large compared with the Kolmogorov length, but still very small compared with the large scale of the flow (i.e. ). Since eddies in this range are much larger than the dissipative eddies that exist at Kolmogorov scales, kinetic energy is essentially not dissipated in this range, and it is merely transferred to smaller scales until viscous effects become important as the order of the Kolmogorov scale is approached. Within this range inertial effects are still much larger than viscous effects, and it is possible to assume that viscosity does not play a role in their internal dynamics (for this reason this range is called &quot;inertial range&quot;).

Hence, a third hypothesis of Kolmogorov was that at very high Reynolds number the statistics of scales in the range are universally and uniquely determined by the scale and the rate of energy dissipation .

The way in which the kinetic energy is distributed over the multiplicity of scales is a fundamental characterization of a turbulent flow. For homogeneous turbulence (i.e., statistically invariant under translations of the reference frame) this is usually done by means of the &quot;energy spectrum function&quot; , where is the modulus of the wavevector corresponding to some harmonics in a Fourier representation of the flow velocity field :

:formula_8

where is the Fourier transform of the flow velocity field. Thus, represents the contribution to the kinetic energy from all the Fourier modes with , and therefore,

:formula_9

where is the mean turbulent kinetic energy of the flow. The wavenumber corresponding to length scale is . Therefore, by dimensional analysis, the only possible form for the energy spectrum function according with the third Kolmogorov&#x27;s hypothesis is

:formula_10

where formula_11 would be a universal constant. This is one of the most famous results of Kolmogorov 1941 theory, describing transport of energy through scale space without any loss or gain. The Kolmogorov five-thirds law was first observed in a tidal channel, and considerable experimental evidence has since accumulated that supports it.

Outside of the inertial area, one can find the formula below :

:formula_12

In spite of this success, Kolmogorov theory is at present under revision. This theory implicitly assumes that the turbulence is statistically self-similar at different scales. This essentially means that the statistics are scale-invariant and non-intermittent in the inertial range. A usual way of studying turbulent flow velocity fields is by means of flow velocity increments:

:formula_13

that is, the difference in flow velocity between points separated by a vector (since the turbulence is assumed isotropic, the flow velocity increment depends only on the modulus of ). Flow velocity increments are useful because they emphasize the effects of scales of the order of the separation when statistics are computed. The statistical scale-invariance without intermittency implies that the scaling of flow velocity increments should occur with a unique scaling exponent , so that when is scaled by a factor ,

:formula_14

should have the same statistical distribution as

:formula_15

with independent of the scale . From this fact, and other results of Kolmogorov 1941 theory, it follows that the statistical moments of the flow velocity increments (known as &quot;structure functions&quot; in turbulence) should scale as

:formula_16

where the brackets denote the statistical average, and the would be universal constants.

There is considerable evidence that turbulent flows deviate from this behavior. The scaling exponents deviate from the value predicted by the theory, becoming a non-linear function of the order of the structure function. The universality of the constants have also been questioned. For low orders the discrepancy with the Kolmogorov value is very small, which explain the success of Kolmogorov theory in regards to low order statistical moments. In particular, it can be shown that when the energy spectrum follows a power law

:formula_17

with , the second order structure function has also a power law, with the form

:formula_18

Since the experimental values obtained for the second order structure function only deviate slightly from the value predicted by Kolmogorov theory, the value for is very near to (differences are about 2%). Thus the &quot;Kolmogorov − spectrum&quot; is generally observed in turbulence. However, for high order structure functions, the difference with the Kolmogorov scaling is significant, and the breakdown of the statistical self-similarity is clear. This behavior, and the lack of universality of the constants, are related with the phenomenon of intermittency in turbulence and can be related to the non-trivial scaling behavior of the dissipation rate averaged over scale . This is an important area of research in this field, and a major goal of the modern theory of turbulence is to understand what is universal in the inertial range, and how to deduce intermittency properties from the Navier-Stokes equations, i.e. from first principles.

<text>In fluid dynamics, a vortex (: vortices or vortexes) is a region in a fluid in which the flow revolves around an axis line, which may be straight or curved. Vortices form in stirred fluids, and may be observed in smoke rings, whirlpools in the wake of a boat, and the winds surrounding a tropical cyclone, tornado or dust devil. 

Vortices are a major component of turbulent flow. The distribution of velocity, vorticity (the curl of the flow velocity), as well as the concept of circulation are used to characterise vortices. In most vortices, the fluid flow velocity is greatest next to its axis and decreases in inverse proportion to the distance from the axis. 

In the absence of external forces, viscous friction within the fluid tends to organise the flow into a collection of irrotational vortices, possibly superimposed to larger-scale flows, including larger-scale vortices. Once formed, vortices can move, stretch, twist, and interact in complex ways. A moving vortex carries some angular and linear momentum, energy, and mass, with it.

== Overview ==
In the dynamics of fluid, a vortex is fluid that revolves around the line of flow. This flow of fluid might be curved or straight. Vortices form from stirred fluids: they might be observed in smoke rings, whirlpools, in the wake of a boat or the winds around a tornado or dust devil.

Vortices are an important part of turbulent flow. Vortices can otherwise be known as a circular motion of a liquid. In the cases of the absence of forces, the liquid settles. This makes the water stay still instead of moving.

When they are created, vortices can move, stretch, twist and interact in complicated ways. When a vortex is moving, sometimes, it can affect an angular position.

For an example, if a water bucket is rotated or spun constantly, it will rotate around an invisible line called the axis line. The rotation moves around in circles. In this example the rotation of the bucket creates extra force.

The reason that the vortices can change shape is the fact that they have open particle paths. This can create a moving vortex. Examples of this fact are the shapes of tornadoes and drain whirlpools.

When two or more vortices are close together they can merge to make a vortex. Vortices also hold energy in its rotation of the fluid. If the energy is never removed, it would consist of circular motion forever.

==Properties==
===Vorticity===

A key concept in the dynamics of vortices is the vorticity, a vector that describes the &quot;local&quot; rotary motion at a point in the fluid, as would be perceived by an observer that moves along with it. Conceptually, the vorticity could be observed by placing a tiny rough ball at the point in question, free to move with the fluid, and observing how it rotates about its center. The direction of the vorticity vector is defined to be the direction of the axis of rotation of this imaginary ball (according to the right-hand rule) while its length is twice the ball&#x27;s angular velocity. Mathematically, the vorticity is defined as the curl (or rotational) of the velocity field of the fluid, usually denoted by formula_1 and expressed by the vector analysis formula formula_2, where formula_3 is the nabla operator and formula_4 is the local flow velocity.

The local rotation measured by the vorticity formula_1 must not be confused with the angular velocity vector of that portion of the fluid with respect to the external environment or to any fixed axis. In a vortex, in particular, formula_1 may be opposite to the mean angular velocity vector of the fluid relative to the vortex&#x27;s axis.

===Vortex types===
In theory, the speed of the particles (and, therefore, the vorticity) in a vortex may vary with the distance from the axis in many ways. There are two important special cases, however:

* If the fluid rotates like a rigid body – that is, if the angular rotational velocity is uniform, so that increases proportionally to the distance from the axis – a tiny ball carried by the flow would also rotate about its center as if it were part of that rigid body. In such a flow, the vorticity is the same everywhere: its direction is parallel to the rotation axis, and its magnitude is equal to twice the uniform angular velocity of the fluid around the center of rotation.
*:formula_7
* If the particle speed is inversely proportional to the distance from the axis, then the imaginary test ball would not rotate over itself; it would maintain the same orientation while moving in a circle around the vortex axis. In this case the vorticity formula_1 is zero at any point not on that axis, and the flow is said to be &quot;irrotational&quot;.
*:formula_9
====Irrotational vortices====

In the absence of external forces, a vortex usually evolves fairly quickly toward the irrotational flow pattern, where the flow velocity is inversely proportional to the distance . Irrotational vortices are also called &quot;free vortices&quot;.

For an irrotational vortex, the circulation is zero along any closed contour that does not enclose the vortex axis; and has a fixed value, , for any contour that does enclose the axis once. The tangential component of the particle velocity is then formula_10. The angular momentum per unit mass relative to the vortex axis is therefore constant, formula_11.

The ideal irrotational vortex flow in free space is not physically realizable, since it would imply that the particle speed (and hence the force needed to keep particles in their circular paths) would grow without bound as one approaches the vortex axis. Indeed, in real vortices there is always a core region surrounding the axis where the particle velocity stops increasing and then decreases to zero as goes to zero. Within that region, the flow is no longer irrotational: the vorticity formula_1 becomes non-zero, with direction roughly parallel to the vortex axis. The Rankine vortex is a model that assumes a rigid-body rotational flow where is less than a fixed distance 0, and irrotational flow outside that core regions.

In a viscous fluid, irrotational flow contains viscous dissipation everywhere, yet there are no net viscous forces, only viscous stresses. Due to the dissipation, this means that sustaining an irrotational viscous vortex requires continuous input of work at the core (for example, by steadily turning a cylinder at the core). In free space there is no energy input at the core, and thus the compact vorticity held in the core will naturally diffuse outwards, converting the core to a gradually-slowing and gradually-growing rigid-body flow, surrounded by the original irrotational flow. Such a decaying irrotational vortex has an exact solution of the viscous Navier–Stokes equations, known as a Lamb–Oseen vortex.

====Rotational vortices====

A rotational vortex – a vortex that rotates in the same way as a rigid body – cannot exist indefinitely in that state except through the application of some extra force, that is not generated by the fluid motion itself. It has non-zero vorticity everywhere outside the core. Rotational vortices are also called rigid-body vortices or forced vortices.

For example, if a water bucket is spun at constant angular speed about its vertical axis, the water will eventually rotate in rigid-body fashion. The particles will then move along circles, with velocity equal to . In that case, the free surface of the water will assume a parabolic shape.

In this situation, the rigid rotating enclosure provides an extra force, namely an extra pressure gradient in the water, directed inwards, that prevents transition of the rigid-body flow to the irrotational state.

=== Vortex formation on boundaries ===
Vortex structures are defined by their vorticity&quot;,&quot; the local rotation rate of fluid particles. They can be formed via the phenomenon known as boundary layer separation which can occur when a fluid moves over a surface and experiences a rapid acceleration from the fluid velocity to zero due to the no-slip condition. This rapid negative acceleration creates a boundary layer which causes a local rotation of fluid at the wall (i.e. vorticity) which is referred to as the wall shear rate. The thickness of this boundary layer is proportional to formula_13 (where v is the free stream fluid velocity and t is time).

If the diameter or thickness of the vessel or fluid is less than the boundary layer thickness then the boundary layer will not separate and vortices will not form. However, when the boundary layer does grow beyond this critical boundary layer thickness then separation will occur which will generate vortices. 

This boundary layer separation can also occur in the presence of combatting pressure gradients (i.e. a pressure that develops downstream). This is present in curved surfaces and general geometry changes like a convex surface. A unique example of severe geometric changes is at the trailing edge of a bluff body where the fluid flow deceleration, and therefore boundary layer and vortex formation, is located.

Another form of vortex formation on a boundary is when fluid flows perpendicularly into a wall and creates a &quot;splash effect.&quot; The velocity streamlines are immediately deflected and decelerated so that the boundary layer separates and forms a toroidal vortex ring.

===Vortex geometry===
In a stationary vortex, the typical streamline (a line that is everywhere tangent to the flow velocity vector) is a closed loop surrounding the axis; and each vortex line (a line that is everywhere tangent to the vorticity vector) is roughly parallel to the axis. A surface that is everywhere tangent to both flow velocity and vorticity is called a vortex tube. In general, vortex tubes are nested around the axis of rotation. The axis itself is one of the vortex lines, a limiting case of a vortex tube with zero diameter.

According to Helmholtz&#x27;s theorems, a vortex line cannot start or end in the fluid – except momentarily, in non-steady flow, while the vortex is forming or dissipating. In general, vortex lines (in particular, the axis line) are either closed loops or end at the boundary of the fluid. A whirlpool is an example of the latter, namely a vortex in a body of water whose axis ends at the free surface. A vortex tube whose vortex lines are all closed will be a closed torus-like surface.

A newly created vortex will promptly extend and bend so as to eliminate any open-ended vortex lines. For example, when an airplane engine is started, a vortex usually forms ahead of each propeller, or the turbofan of each jet engine. One end of the vortex line is attached to the engine, while the other end usually stretches out and bends until it reaches the ground.

When vortices are made visible by smoke or ink trails, they may seem to have spiral pathlines or streamlines. However, this appearance is often an illusion and the fluid particles are moving in closed paths. The spiral streaks that are taken to be streamlines are in fact clouds of the marker fluid that originally spanned several vortex tubes and were stretched into spiral shapes by the non-uniform flow velocity distribution.

===Pressure in a vortex===

The fluid motion in a vortex creates a dynamic pressure (in addition to any hydrostatic pressure) that is lowest in the core region, closest to the axis, and increases as one moves away from it, in accordance with Bernoulli&#x27;s principle. One can say that it is the gradient of this pressure that forces the fluid to follow a curved path around the axis.

In a rigid-body vortex flow of a fluid with constant density, the dynamic pressure is proportional to the square of the distance from the axis. In a constant gravity field, the free surface of the liquid, if present, is a concave paraboloid.

In an irrotational vortex flow with constant fluid density and cylindrical symmetry, the dynamic pressure varies as , where is the limiting pressure infinitely far from the axis. This formula provides another constraint for the extent of the core, since the pressure cannot be negative. The free surface (if present) dips sharply near the axis line, with depth inversely proportional to . The shape formed by the free surface is called a hyperboloid, or &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s Horn&quot; (by Evangelista Torricelli).

The core of a vortex in air is sometimes visible because water vapor condenses as the low pressure of the core causes adiabatic cooling; the funnel of a tornado is an example. When a vortex line ends at a boundary surface, the reduced pressure may also draw matter from that surface into the core. For example, a dust devil is a column of dust picked up by the core of an air vortex attached to the ground. A vortex that ends at the free surface of a body of water (like the whirlpool that often forms over a bathtub drain) may draw a column of air down the core. The forward vortex extending from a jet engine of a parked airplane can suck water and small stones into the core and then into the engine.

===Evolution===

Vortices need not be steady-state features; they can move and change shape. In a moving vortex, the particle paths are not closed, but are open, loopy curves like helices and cycloids. A vortex flow might also be combined with a radial or axial flow pattern. In that case the streamlines and pathlines are not closed curves but spirals or helices, respectively. This is the case in tornadoes and in drain whirlpools. A vortex with helical streamlines is said to be solenoidal.

As long as the effects of viscosity and diffusion are negligible, the fluid in a moving vortex is carried along with it. In particular, the fluid in the core (and matter trapped by it) tends to remain in the core as the vortex moves about. This is a consequence of Helmholtz&#x27;s second theorem. Thus vortices (unlike surface waves and pressure waves) can transport mass, energy and momentum over considerable distances compared to their size, with surprisingly little dispersion. This effect is demonstrated by smoke rings and exploited in vortex ring toys and guns.

Two or more vortices that are approximately parallel and circulating in the same direction will attract and eventually merge to form a single vortex, whose circulation will equal the sum of the circulations of the constituent vortices. For example, an airplane wing that is developing lift will create a sheet of small vortices at its trailing edge. These small vortices merge to form a single wingtip vortex, less than one wing chord downstream of that edge. This phenomenon also occurs with other active airfoils, such as propeller blades. On the other hand, two parallel vortices with opposite circulations (such as the two wingtip vortices of an airplane) tend to remain separate.

Vortices contain substantial energy in the circular motion of the fluid. In an ideal fluid this energy can never be dissipated and the vortex would persist forever. However, real fluids exhibit viscosity and this dissipates energy very slowly from the core of the vortex. It is only through dissipation of a vortex due to viscosity that a vortex line can end in the fluid, rather than at the boundary of the fluid.

==Further examples==
*In the hydrodynamic interpretation of the behaviour of electromagnetic fields, the acceleration of electric fluid in a particular direction creates a positive vortex of magnetic fluid. This in turn creates around itself a corresponding negative vortex of electric fluid. Exact solutions to classical nonlinear magnetic equations include the Landau–Lifshitz equation, the continuum Heisenberg model, the Ishimori equation, and the nonlinear Schrödinger equation.
*Vortex rings are torus-shaped vortices where the axis of rotation is a continuous closed curve. Smoke rings and bubble rings are two well-known examples.
*The lifting force of aircraft wings, propeller blades, sails, and other airfoils can be explained by the creation of a vortex superimposed on the flow of air past the wing.
*Aerodynamic drag can be explained in large part by the formation of vortices in the surrounding fluid that carry away energy from the moving body.
*Large whirlpools can be produced by ocean tides in certain straits or bays. Examples are Charybdis of classical mythology in the Straits of Messina, Italy; the Naruto whirlpools of Nankaido, Japan; and the Maelstrom at Lofoten, Norway.
*Vortices in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere are important phenomena for meteorology. They include mesocyclones on the scale of a few miles, tornadoes, waterspouts, and hurricanes. These vortices are often driven by temperature and humidity variations with altitude. The sense of rotation of hurricanes is influenced by the Earth&#x27;s rotation. Another example is the Polar vortex, a persistent, large-scale cyclone centered near the Earth&#x27;s poles, in the middle and upper troposphere and the stratosphere.
*Vortices are prominent features of the atmospheres of other planets. They include the permanent Great Red Spot on Jupiter, the intermittent Great Dark Spot on Neptune, the polar vortices of Venus, the Martian dust devils and the North Polar Hexagon of Saturn.
*Sunspots are dark regions on the Sun&#x27;s visible surface (photosphere) marked by a lower temperature than its surroundings, and intense magnetic activity.
*The accretion disks of black holes and other massive gravitational sources.
*Taylor–Couette flow occurs in a fluid between two nested cylinders, one rotating, the other fixed.

<text>is a rocky and wooded hillock near Beddgelert in Gwynedd, north-west Wales. Rising some above the floor of the Glaslyn river valley, it overlooks the southern end of Llyn Dinas in Snowdonia.

Little remains of the Iron Age hillfort or castle structures that once stood here, save its stone ramparts and the base of a keep [Grid reference ]. Some believe the castle was erected by Llewelyn the Last to guard the road to the mountain pass of Snowdon.

==Description==

Little remains of the structures that once stood on the hill. Such remains as are visible today, including three series of ramparts and other walls and some foundations, mostly date to the Middle Ages. Archaeologist H. N. Savory described the fortifications as consisting of stone walls between thick, which exploited every irregularity in the rocky hill-top, enclosing an irregular area of about a in size. The original means of access was by a steep path on the western side of the hillfort. The present entrance from the north-east is a later addition.

Excavations in 1910 and 1954–56 revealed several periods of habitation at the site. The earliest elements date to the Iron Age, perhaps to the 1st or 2nd century. A pool within the enclosure, thought to be an artificial construction, may date to this phase. It is perhaps connected to the pool found in the popular tale of Vortigern and the dragons. Other traces suggest habitation into the 5th century, which would put it in the time frame for Vortigern and Ambrosius Aurelianus.

It has long been known that there is a pool inside the fort, but when the archaeologist Dr H. N. Savory excavated the hillfort between 1954 and 1956, he was surprised to find that not only were the fortifications of about the right time frame for either Vortigern or Ambrosius, but that there was a platform above the pool as described in the &quot;Historia Britonum&quot;. However, he found the platform to date much later than the accepted floruit of either personage.

==Literary tradition==
While it is of interest to archaeologists because it is an example of a hillfort whose fortifications entirely postdate the Roman period, this hill is also of interest to enthusiasts about the legends of King Arthur. This is the setting of the famous exchange of the warlord Vortigern and the youthful Ambrosius as told the Historia Britonum.

According to legend, when Vortigern fled into Wales to escape the Anglo-Saxon invaders, he chose this lofty hillfort as the site for his royal retreat. Every day his men would work hard erecting the first of several proposed towers; but the next morning they would return to find the masonry collapsed in a heap. This continued for many weeks until Vortigern was advised to seek the help of a young boy not conceived by a mortal man. The King sent his soldiers out across the land to find such a lad. The boy they found was called Myrddin Emrys (Merlin Ambrosius). Vortigern, following the advice of his councillors, was planning to kill the boy in order to appease supernatural powers that prevented him from building a fortress here. Merlin scorned this advice, and instead explained that the hillfort could not stand due to a hidden pool containing two &quot;vermes&quot; (dragons). He explained how the White Dragon of the Saxons though winning the battle at present, would soon be defeated by the Welsh Red Dragon. After Vortigern&#x27;s downfall, the fort was given to High-King Ambrosius Aurelianus, known in Welsh as Emrys Wledig, hence its name.

===Origin and confinement of the dragons===

The earliest sources regard the two dragons as distinctly different, and in a metaphor of the &quot;Adventus Saxonum&quot; describes one as being native to the island of Britain (it had arrived first) which was then joined by another new and alien dragon that fought it for supremacy.

As to how the dragons became confined there, the story of &quot;Lludd and Llefelys&quot; in the Mabinogion gives details. According to the legend, when Lludd ruled Britain (100 BC), a hideous scream, whose origin could not be determined, was heard each May Eve. This scream so perplexed the Britons that it caused infertility, panic and mayhem throughout the realm. In need of help Lludd sought counsel on this and other matters from his brother Llefelys, a King of Gaul. Llefelys furnished the information that the scream was caused by battling dragons. The scream would be uttered by the &quot;dragon of the Britons&quot; when it was fighting another alien dragon and was being defeated. Lludd heeded the advice given to him by Llefelys and captured both dragons in a cauldron filled with mead when they had transformed themselves, as apparently dragons did, into pigs. The captured dragons were buried at the place later called Dinas Emrys, as it was regarded as the safest place to put them.

The main entrance to the fort is on the northern side of the hill and traces of a ruined medieval tower 36 feet by 24 feet have been found on the summit. Nearby is a circle of tumbled stones about 30 feet in diameter which is said to be where the dragons were hidden. Before Dinas Emrys was so-named the fort was known as &quot;Dinas Ffaraon Dandde&quot;.

===Other local legends===

According to local legend Myrddin hid treasure in a cave at Dinas Emrys. The discoverer of the treasure will be &#x27;golden-haired and blue-eyed&#x27;. When that lucky person is near to Dinas Emrys a bell will ring to invite him or her into the cave, which will open of its own accord as soon as that person&#x27;s foot touches it. A young man who lived near Beddgelert once searched for the treasure, hoping to give himself a good start in life. He took a pickaxe and climbed to the top of the hill. When he began to dig in earnest on the site of the tower, some terrible unearthly noises began to rumble under his feet. The Dinas began to rock like a cradle and the sun clouded over so it became pitch dark. Lightning flashed in the sky and thunder clapped over his head. He dropped the pickaxe and ran home. When he arrived, everything was calm again, but he never returned to collect his pickaxe. Not far from Dinas Emrys is &quot;Cell y Dewiniaid&quot; – &quot;The Grove of the Magicians&quot;. There is a field here that once had a thick grove of oak trees at its north end. Local tradition holds that Vortigern&#x27;s wise men used to meet here to discuss the great events of their times. An adjacent field is where they were buried and at one time a stone marked the site of each grave. A white thorn tree annually decorated each resting place with falling white blossoms.

==Actual archaeological findings==
It has long been known that there is a pool inside the fort, but when the archaeologist Dr H. N. Savory excavated the hillfort between 1954 and 1956, he was surprised to find that not only were the fortifications of about the right time frame for either Vortigern or Ambrosius, but that there was a platform above the pool as described in the Historia Britonum. However, he found the platform to date much later than the accepted floruit of either personage.

Savory described the fortifications as consisting of stone walls between thick, which exploited every irregularity in the rocky hill-top, enclosing an irregular area of about a in size. The original means of access was by a steep path on the western side of the hillfort. The present entrance from the north-east is a later addition. The walls had been &quot;poorly built of stone two or three times &quot;, possibly inspiring the legend&#x27;s reference to the building collapsing several times during construction.

The most conspicuous object currently on the hill is the base of a rectangular tower. It is generally accepted that this is part of an undocumented castle built by the princes of Gwynedd in the eleventh century.

==Dinas Affaraon/Ffaraon==

&quot;Dinas Affaraon&quot; or &quot;Dinas Ffaraon&quot; is a placename mentioned in some medieval Welsh literature, where it is said to be the original name of Dinas Emrys.

&quot;Dinas Ffaraon&quot; (Fortress of Pharaoh) or &quot;Dinas Ffaraon Dande&quot; (Fortress of Fiery Pharaoh) is mentioned in the tale &quot;Lludd and Llefelys&quot; as the place where King Lludd of Britain traps and buries two dragons who are ravaging the land. The text explains that the site was later named &quot;Dinas Emreis&quot;. This tale is a prequel to the older story involving the hero Emrys (Ambrosius Aurelianus) or Myrddin Emrys (Merlin). In sources such as the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; and Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, a tower built on the spot continually collapses until Emrys reveals the buried dragons as the cause; once they are released the tower is successfully constructed and named after him. The name &quot;Dinas Emrys&quot; has been associated with a Roman ruin in Snowdonia, a localization that possibly dates as early as the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;.

<doc id="154671" wikidata="Q2736547" url="?curid=154671" title="Monarchy of Ireland">
<text>Monarchical systems of government have existed in Ireland from ancient times. This continued in all of Ireland until 1949, when the Republic of Ireland Act removed most of Ireland&#x27;s residual ties to the British monarch. Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, remains under a monarchical system of government.

The office of High King of Ireland effectively ended with the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland (1169–1171) in which the island was declared a fief of the Holy See under the Lordship of the King of England. In practice, conquered territory was divided amongst various Anglo-Norman noble families who assumed title over both the land and the people with the prior Irish inhabitants being either displaced or subjugated under the previously alien system of serfdom. Though the revolutionary change in the status quo was undeniable, the Anglo-Norman invaders would fail to conquer many of the Gaelic kingdoms of Ireland, which continued to exist, often expanding for centuries after, however none could make any viable claims of High Kingship. This lasted until the Parliament of Ireland conferred the crown of Ireland upon King Henry VIII of England during the English Reformation. Henry initiated the Tudor conquest of Ireland which ended Gaelic political independence from the English monarch who now held the crowns of England and Ireland in a personal union.

The Union of the Crowns in 1603 expanded the personal union to include Scotland. The personal union between England and Scotland became a political union with the enactments of the Acts of Union 1707, which created the Kingdom of Great Britain. The crowns of Great Britain and Ireland remained in personal union until it was also ended by the Acts of Union 1800, which united Ireland and Great Britain into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in January 1801.

In December 1922, most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom, becoming the Irish Free State; at the same time, the newly created Northern Ireland, which covered most of Ulster, remained part of the United Kingdom. As a dominion within the British Empire, the Free State legally retained the same person as monarch as the United Kingdom—which in 1927 changed its name to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In 1937, the Free State adopted a new constitution that removed all mention of the monarchy. In April 1949, the former Free State, which covered most of Ireland, declared itself a republic, and withdrew from the Commonwealth of Nations; this left Northern Ireland as the only part of the island that retained a monarchical system.

==Gaelic kingdoms==
Gaelic Ireland consisted of as few as five and as many as nine Primary kingdoms (Cúicide/Cóicide &#x27;fifths&#x27;) which were often subdivided into many minor smaller kingdoms (Tuatha, &#x27;folkdoms&#x27;). The primary kingdoms were Ailech, Airgíalla, Connacht, Leinster, Mide, Osraige, Munster, Thomond and Ulster. Until the end of Gaelic Ireland they continued to fluctuate, expand and contract in size, as well as dissolving entirely or being amalgamated into new entities. The role of High King of Ireland was primarily titular and rarely (if ever) absolute. Gaelic Ireland was not ruled as a unitary state.

The names of Connacht, Ulster, Leinster and Munster are still in use, now applied to the four modern provinces of Ireland. The following is a list of the main Irish kingdoms and their kings: 
*Kings of Ailech (5th century to 1185)
*Kings of Airgíalla (?-1590)
*Kings of Connacht (406–1474)
*Kings of Leinster (634 to 1603 or 1632 (de facto))
*Kings of Mide (8th–12th centuries)
*Kings of Osraige (to 12th century)
*Kings of Munster (4th century to 1138 or 1194 (claimant))
*Kings of Thomond (1118–1543)
*Kings of Ulster (5th–12th centuries)

===&quot;Ard Rí co Fresabra&quot;: High Kings with opposition===

Máire Herbert has noted that &quot;Annal evidence from the late eighth century in Ireland suggests that the larger provincial kingships were already accruing power at the expense of smaller political units. Leading kings appear in public roles at church-state proclamations ... and at royal conferences with their peers.&quot; (2000, p. 62). Responding to the assumption of the title &quot;ri hErenn uile&quot; (&quot;king of all Ireland&quot;) by Mael Sechlainn I in 862, she furthermore states that

Nevertheless, the achievements of Máel Sechlainn I and his successors were purely personal, and open to destruction upon their deaths. Between 846 and 1022, and again from 1042 to 1166, kings from the leading Irish kingdoms made greater attempts to compel the rest of the island&#x27;s populace to their rule, with varying degrees of success, until the inauguration of Ruaidri Ua Conchobair (Rory O&#x27;Connor) in 1166,

====Ruaidrí, King of Ireland====

Upon the death of Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn in early 1166, Ruaidrí, King of Connacht, proceeded to Dublin where he was inaugurated &quot;King of Ireland&quot; without opposition. He was arguably the first undisputed full king of Ireland. He was also the last Gaelic one, as the events of the Norman invasion of 1169–1171 brought about the destruction of the high-kingship, and the direct involvement of the Kings of England in Irish politics.

One of Ruaidrí&#x27;s first acts as king was the subduing of Leinster, which resulted in the exile of its king, Diarmait Mac Murchada. Ruaidrí then obtained terms and hostages from all the notable kings and lords. He then celebrated the &quot;Oenach Tailteann&quot;, a recognised prerogative of the High Kings, and made a number of notable charitable gifts and donations. However, his &quot;caput&quot; remained in his home territory in central Connacht (County Galway). Ireland&#x27;s recognised capital, Dublin, was ruled by Ascall mac Ragnaill, who had submitted to Ruaidri.

Only with the arrival of MacMurrough&#x27;s Anglo-Norman benefactors in May 1169 did Ruaidrí&#x27;s position begin to weaken. A series of disastrous defeats and ill-judged treaties lost him much of Leinster, and encouraged uprisings by rebel lords. By the time of the arrival of Henry II in 1171, Ruaidrí&#x27;s position as king of Ireland was increasingly untenable.

Ruaidrí at first remained aloof from engagement with King Henry, though many of the lesser kings and lords welcomed his arrival as they wished to see him curb the territorial gains made by his vassals. Through the intercession of Lorcán Ua Tuathail (Laurence O&#x27;Toole), the Archbishop of Dublin, Ruaidrí and Henry came to terms with the Treaty of Windsor in 1175. Ruaidrí agreed to recognise Henry as his lord; in return, Ruaidrí was allowed to keep all Ireland as his personal kingdom outside the petty kingdoms of Laigin (Leinster) and Mide as well as the city of Waterford.

Henry was unwilling or unable to enforce the terms of the treaty on his barons in Ireland, who continued to gain territory in Ireland. A low point came in 1177 with a successful raid into the heart of Connacht by a party of Anglo-Normans, led by one of Ruaidrí&#x27;s sons, Prince Muirchertach. They were expelled, Ruaidhrí ordering the blinding of Muirchertach, but over the next six years his rule was increasingly diminished by internal dynastic conflict and external attacks. Finally, in 1183, he abdicated.

He was twice briefly returned to power in 1185 and 1189, but even within his home kingdom of Connacht he had become politically marginalized. He lived quietly on his estates, died at the monastery of Cong in 1198 and was buried at Clonmacnoise. With the possible exception of the short reign of Brian Ua Néill (Brian O&#x27;Neill) in 1258–1260, no other Gaelic king was ever again recognised as king or high king of Ireland.

==Lordship of Ireland: 1171–1542==
By the time of Ruaidrí&#x27;s reign in 1171, King Henry II of England had invaded Ireland and given the part of it he controlled to his son John as a Lordship when John was just ten years old in 1177. When John succeeded to the English throne in 1199, he remained Lord of Ireland thereby bringing the kingdom of England and the lordship of Ireland into personal union. By the mid-13th century, while the island was nominally ruled by the king of England, from c.1260 the effective area of control began to recede. As various Cambro-Norman noble families died out in the male line, the Gaelic nobility began to reclaim lost territory. Successive English kings did little to stem the tide, instead using Ireland to draw upon men and supplies in the wars in Scotland and France.

By the 1390s the Lordship had effectively shrunk to the Pale (a fortified area around the city of Dublin) with the rest of the island under the control of independent Gaelic-Irish or rebel Cambro-Norman noble families. King Richard II of England made two journeys to Ireland during his reign to rectify the situation; as a direct result of his second visit in 1399 he lost his throne to Henry Bolingbroke. This was the last time that a medieval king of England visited Ireland.

For the duration of the 15th century, royal power in Ireland was weak, the country being dominated by the various clans and dynasties of Gaelic (O&#x27;Neill, O&#x27;Brien, MacCarthy) or Cambro-Norman (Burke, FitzGerald, Butler) origin.

===Lords of Ireland, 1177–1542===

** First man to be made Lord of Ireland and established the precedent that that Lord would also be King of England.
* Henry III (1216–1272)
** Henry III granted Ireland to his son, Edward I, in 1254 on condition that it would never be separated from the Crown.
** Brian Ua Néill claimed the title of High King of Ireland from 1258 to 1260, until his defeat and death in the Battle of Druim Dearg (also known as the Battle of Down).

** Perkin Warbeck claimed to be Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York (&quot;Richard IV&quot;) and gained some Irish support before a failed invasion of England in 1495.
* Henry VIII (1509–1542)
The title of Lord of Ireland was abolished by Henry VIII, who was made King of Ireland by the Parliament of Ireland by the Crown of Ireland Act 1542.

==Kingdom of Ireland, 1542–1800==
===Re-creation of title===

The title &quot;King of Ireland&quot; was created by an act of the Irish Parliament in 1541, replacing the Lordship of Ireland, which had existed since 1171, with the Kingdom of Ireland.

The 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset, Henry VIII&#x27;s illegitimate son and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, had been considered for elevation as the newly created King of Ireland. However, Henry VIII&#x27;s counsellors feared that creating a separate Kingdom of Ireland, with a ruler other than that of England, would create another threat like the King of Scotland, and Richmond died in 1536.

The Crown of Ireland Act 1542 established a personal union between the English and Irish crowns, providing that whoever was King of England was to be King of Ireland as well, and so its first holder was King Henry VIII of England. Henry&#x27;s sixth and last wife, Katherine Parr, was the first Queen consort of Ireland following her marriage to King Henry in 1543.

The title of King of Ireland was created after Henry VIII had been excommunicated in 1538, so it was not recognised by European Catholic monarchs. Following the accession of the Catholic Mary I in 1553 and her marriage to Philip II of Spain, in 1554, Pope Paul IV issued the papal bull &quot;Ilius&quot; in 1555, recognising them as Queen and King of Ireland together with her heirs and successors.

For a brief period in the 17th century, during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms from the impeachment and execution of Charles I in 1649 to the Irish Restoration in May 1660, there was no &#x27;King of Ireland&#x27;. After the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Irish Catholics, organised in Confederate Ireland, still recognised Charles I, and later Charles II, as legitimate monarchs, in opposition to the claims of the English Parliament, and signed a formal treaty with Charles I in 1648. However, in 1649, the Rump Parliament, victorious in the English Civil War, executed Charles I, and made England a republic, or &quot;Commonwealth&quot;. The Parliamentarian general Oliver Cromwell came across the Irish Sea to crush the Irish royalists, temporarily uniting England, Scotland, and Ireland under one government, and styling himself &quot;Lord Protector&quot; of the three kingdoms (&quot;see also Cromwellian conquest of Ireland&quot;). After Cromwell&#x27;s death in 1658, his son Richard emerged as the leader of this pan-British Isles republic, but he was not competent to maintain it. The Parliament of England at Westminster voted to restore the monarchy, and in 1660 King Charles II returned from exile in France to become King of England, King of Scotland and King of Ireland.

===Union with Great Britain, 1707–1922===

The Acts of Union 1707 merged the kingdoms of England and Scotland into the Kingdom of Great Britain, under the sovereignty of the British Crown. The effect was to create a personal union between the Crown of Ireland and the British Crown, instead of the English Crown. Later, from 1 January 1801, an additional merger took place between the two Kingdoms. By the terms of the Acts of Union 1800, the Kingdom of Ireland merged with the Kingdom of Great Britain, thus creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Following the separation of most of Ireland from that kingdom in 1922, the remaining constituent parts were renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927, five years after the establishment of the Irish Free State.

During the early 18th century, a significant number of Irishmen who had fled Ireland in the aftermath of the Treaty of Limerick continued to remain loyal to the Jacobite Stuart pretenders as Kings of Ireland (particularly the Wild Geese military diaspora in France&#x27;s Irish Brigade), contrary to the House of Hanover. However, Ireland was host to a large military establishment and thus, unlike Scotland, was not the ground for legitimist-royalist risings in the 18th century, turning instead, mostly to republicanism as dissention with the ascent of the United Irishmen. However, despite their general anti-clericalism and republicanism, the French Directory did suggest to the United Irishmen in 1798 restoring the Jacobite Pretender, Henry Benedict Stuart, as Henry IX, King of the Irish. This was on account of General Jean Joseph Amable Humbert landing a force in County Mayo for the Irish Rebellion of 1798 and realising the local population were devoutly Catholic (a significant number of Irish priests supported the Rising and had met with Humbert, although Humbert&#x27;s Army had been veterans of the anti-clerical campaign in Italy). The French Directory hoped this option would allow the creation of a stable French client state in Ireland, however, Wolfe Tone, the Protestant republican leader, scoffed at the suggestion and it was quashed.

===Partition: Irish Free State and Northern Ireland, 1922–1936===
In early December 1922, most of Ireland (twenty-six of the country&#x27;s thirty-two counties) left the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. These &#x27;Twenty-Six Counties&#x27; now became the Irish Free State, a self-governing dominion within the British Empire. Six of Ireland&#x27;s north-eastern counties, all within the nine-county Province of Ulster, remained within the United Kingdom as Northern Ireland. As a Dominion, the Free State was a constitutional monarchy with the British monarch as its head of state. The monarch was officially represented in the new Free State by the Governor-General of the Irish Free State.

The King&#x27;s title in the Irish Free State was exactly the same as it was elsewhere in the British Empire, being from 1922 to 1927: &quot;By the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India&quot; and, from 1927 to 1937: &quot;By the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India&quot;. The change in the King&#x27;s title was effected under an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom called the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act, 1927, intended to update the name of the United Kingdom as well as the King&#x27;s title to reflect the fact that most of the island of Ireland had left the United Kingdom. The Act therefore provided that &quot;Parliament shall hereafter be known as and styled the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland [instead of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]&quot; and &quot;In every Act passed and public document issued after the passing of this Act the expression &#x27;United Kingdom&#x27; shall, unless the context otherwise requires, mean Great Britain and Northern Ireland.&quot;

According to &quot;The Times&quot;, the &quot;Imperial Conference proposed that, as a result of the establishment of the Irish Free State, the title of the king should be changed to &#x27;George V, by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland, and the British Dominions beyond the seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India.&#x27;&quot; The change did not mean that the king had now assumed different styles in the different parts of his Empire. That development did not formally occur until 1953, four years after the new Republic of Ireland had left the Commonwealth.

Despite a lack of change in his title, George V&#x27;s position as king of that country became separated from his place as King of the United Kingdom (as occurred with all the other British Dominions at the time). The Government of the Irish Free State (also known as His Majesty&#x27;s Government in the Irish Free State) was confident that the relationship of these independent countries under the Crown would function as a personal union.

===Abdication crisis, President of Ireland and Republic of Ireland Act, 1936–1949===

The constitutional crisis resulting from the abdication of King Edward VIII in December 1936 was used by Éamon de Valera&#x27;s government as a catalyst to amend the Constitution of the Irish Free State by eliminating all but one of the King&#x27;s official duties. This was achieved with the enactment on 11 December of the Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act, which removed the monarch from the constitution and, on 12 December, the External Relations Act, which provided that the monarch recognised by Britain and the rest of the Commonwealth could represent the Irish Free State &quot;for the purposes of the appointment of diplomatic and consular representatives and the conclusion of international agreements&quot; when authorised to do so by the Irish government. The following year, a new constitution was ratified, changing the name of the Free State to Éire, or &quot;Ireland&quot; in the English language, and establishing the office of President of Ireland. The King&#x27;s role in Ireland was ambiguous. Whether the Irish head of state was George VI, or the President, was left unclear. This ambiguity was eliminated with the enactment of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, which came into force in April 1949 and declared the state to be a republic. The External Relations Act was repealed, removing the remaining duties of the monarch, and Ireland formally withdrew from the British Commonwealth. The position of the king in the Irish state was finally and formally ended by the Oireachtas with the repeal of the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 by the Statute Law Revision (Pre-Union Irish Statutes) Act 1962.

According to Desmond Oulton (owner of Clontarf Castle), his father John George Oulton had suggested to Éamon de Valera towards the end of the Irish Free State, that Ireland should have its own king again, as it was in the times of Gaelic Ireland. He suggested to him, a member of the O&#x27;Brien Clan, descended in the paternal line from Brian Boru, a previous High King of Ireland: the most senior representative at the time was Donough O&#x27;Brien, 16th Baron Inchiquin. Oulton said that Donough&#x27;s nephew Conor O&#x27;Brien, 18th Baron Inchiquin, confirmed that De Valera did offer Donough O&#x27;Brien the title of Prince-President of the Irish Republic, but this was turned down and so a President of Ireland was instituted instead.

The British monarchy, specifically, continued and continues in Northern Ireland, which remains a part of the sovereign state that is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. From 1921 until 1973, the British monarch was officially represented in Northern Ireland by the Governor of Northern Ireland.

===List of monarchs of Ireland===
====Monarchs of Ireland====
British monarchs: 

* Henry VIII (1542–1547); Lord of Ireland, 1509–1542; made king by the Crown of Ireland Act 1542
* Edward VI (1547–1553)
* Lady Jane Grey (1553; disputed)
* Mary I (1553–1558)
** Philip (of Spain) (1554–1558) &quot;jure uxoris&quot;; the Spanish king (Mary&#x27;s husband)&#x27;s title as King of Ireland was reinforced by the Treason Act 1554
* Elizabeth I (1558–1603)
* James I (1603–1625)
* Charles I (1625–1649)

The Wars of the Three Kingdoms (incorporating the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Confederate Ireland, the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland and the Irish Confederate Wars) took place between 1639 and 1653. Charles I was executed in 1649 and his son Charles II was recognised by some Irish lords as King of Ireland. The Interregnum began with England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales ruled by the Council of State, then the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell (1649–1658) and his son Richard Cromwell (1658–1659). The Restoration in Ireland was effected in 1660 without major opposition, Charles II being declared king on 14 May 1660 by the Irish Convention.

* Charles II (1660–1685)
* James II (1685–1689)
* William III (1689–1702) and Mary II (1689–1694)

The position of King of Ireland was contested by William III and James II between 1689 and 1691, after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. The Crown and Parliament Recognition Act 1689 made William King of Ireland, and this was reinforced by his victory at the Battle of the Boyne (part of the Williamite War in Ireland).

* Anne (1702–1714)
** The Acts of Union 1707 united the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. However, the Kingdom of Ireland remained a separate state.
* George I (1714–1727)
* George II (1727–1760)
* George III (1760–1801)

The Acts of Union 1800, which came into force on 1 January 1801, was instituted in response to the Irish Rebellion of 1798 and created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.
* George III (1801–1820)
* George IV (1820–1830)
* William IV (1830–1837)
* Victoria (1837–1901) 
* Edward VII (1901–1910)
* George V (1910–1922)

====Monarchs of the Irish Free State and Ireland====

* George V (1922–1936) (The Irish Free State became a self-governing Dominion of the British Empire and subsequently, in 1931, a legislatively independent country.)
* Edward VIII (1936)
* Arguably George VI (1936–1949), whose status was diminished &quot;(see Irish head of state from 1922 to 1949)&quot;.

Following the Ireland Act 1949, only the part of Ireland known as Northern Ireland remained part of a monarchy.

====King&#x27;s title, George V – George VI====
The king&#x27;s title in the Irish Free State, when it became a self-governing Dominion of the British Empire, and its constitutional successor from December 1936 to April 1949, was the same as elsewhere in the British Commonwealth, but it was unclear whether the President of Ireland or the king was head of state.

The changes in the royal style in the 20th century took into account the emergence of independence for the dominions from the Imperial Parliament of the United Kingdom. The kings successively and their advisers and governments in the United Kingdom were fully aware that the republican intent of the representatives of the Irish Free State was in marked contrast to the intent of the governments of certain other dominions, such as Canada. and such differences were manifested in this period in the design and use of flags and other national symbols for the Irish Free State and other dominions.

==Proposed Irish monarchy==
In 1906, Patrick Pearse, writing in the newspaper &quot;An Claidheamh Soluis&quot;, envisioned the Ireland of 2006 as an independent Irish-speaking kingdom with an &quot;Ard Rí&quot; or &quot;High King&quot; as head of state.

During the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916, some Republican leaders, including Pearse and Joseph Plunkett, contemplated giving the throne of an independent Ireland to Prince Joachim of Prussia. While they were not in favour of a monarchy in itself, Pearse and Plunkett thought that if the uprising were successful and Germany won the First World War, they would insist on an independent Ireland being a monarchy with a German prince as king, in the same way as Romania and Bulgaria. The fact that Joachim did not speak English was also considered an advantage, as he might be more disposed to learning and promoting the use of the Irish language. In his memoirs, Desmond FitzGerald wrote: 
Ernest Blythe recalls that in January 1915 he heard Plunkett and Thomas MacDonagh express support for the idea at an Irish Volunteers meeting. No objections were made by anyone and Bulmer Hobson was among the attendees. Blythe himself said he found the idea &quot;immensely attractive&quot;.

Sinn Féin was established in 1905 by Arthur Griffith as a monarchist party inspired by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise which sought to create an Anglo-Irish dual monarchy. During the party&#x27;s 1917 Ard Fheis, disputes between monarchists and republicans resulted in an agreement that the question of a republic versus a monarchy would be settled by public referendum after independence was achieved provided that no member of the House of Windsor could become king. As a result, the Irish Republic had no head of state during the Irish War of Independence until the Anglo-Irish Treaty negotiations when Éamon de Valera raised his status to President of the Irish Republic in order to grant himself equal status to George V.

In the 1930s, an organisation known as the Irish Monarchist Society, whose members included Francis Stuart and Osmonde Esmonde, plotted to overthrow the Irish Free State and establish an independent Irish Catholic monarchy under a member of the O&#x27;Neill dynasty.

According to Hugo O&#x27;Donnell, 7th Duke of Tetuan, de Valera raised the idea of an Irish monarchy with his great-grandfather Juan O&#x27;Donnell.

Raymond Moulton O&#x27;Brien, the self-styled &quot;Prince of Thomond&quot;, and the United Christian Nationalist Party, of which O&#x27;Brien was the leader, wanted to reestablish the monarchy with O&#x27;Brien as king.

<text>(&quot;Fantastic Symphony: Episode in the Life of an Artist … in Five Sections&quot;) Op. 14, is a programmatic symphony written by Hector Berlioz in 1830. The first performance was at the Paris Conservatoire on 5 December 1830. 

Berlioz wrote semi-autobiographical programme notes for the piece that allude to the romantic sufferings of a gifted artist who has poisoned himself with opium because of his unrequited love for a beautiful and fascinating woman (in real life, the Shakespearean actress Harriet Smithson, who in 1833 became the composer&#x27;s wife). The composer, who revered Beethoven, followed the latter&#x27;s unusual addition in the &quot;Pastoral&quot; Symphony of a fifth movement to the normal four of a classical symphony. The artist&#x27;s reveries take him to a ball and to a pastoral scene in a field, which is interrupted by a hallucinatory march to the scaffold, leading to a grotesque satanic dance (Witches&#x27; Sabbath). Within each episode, the artist&#x27;s passion is represented by a recurring theme called the .

The symphony has long been a favourite with audiences and conductors. In 1831 Berlioz wrote a sequel, &quot;Lélio&quot;, for actor, soloists, chorus, piano and orchestra. Idil Biret is the first pianist recorded the piano transcription of Liszt in 1979.

== Overview ==

The &quot;&quot; is a piece of programme music that tells the story of a gifted artist who, in the depths of hopelessness and despair because of his unrequited love for a woman, has poisoned himself with opium. The piece tells the story of the artist&#x27;s drug-fuelled hallucinations, beginning with a ball and a scene in a field and ending with a march to the scaffold and a satanic dream. The artist&#x27;s passion is represented by an elusive theme which Berlioz called the &quot;idée fixe&quot;, a contemporary medical term also found in literary works of the period. It is defined by the &quot;Dictionnaire de l&#x27;Académie française&quot; as &quot;an idea that keeps coming back to mind, an obsessive preoccupation&quot;.

Berlioz provided his own preface and programme notes for each movement of the work. They exist in two principal versions: one from 1845 in the first edition of the work and the second from 1855. These changes show how Berlioz downplayed the programmatic aspect of the piece later in life.

The first printing of the score, dedicated to Nicholas I of Russia, was published in 1845. In it, Berlioz writes:


In 1855 Berlioz writes:
Berlioz wanted people to understand his compositional intention, as the story he attached to each movement drove his musical choices. He said, &quot;For this reason I generally find it extremely painful to hear my works conducted by someone other than myself.&quot;

=== Inspiration ===
Attending a performance of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; on 11 September 1827, Berlioz fell in love with the Irish actress Harriet Smithson, who played the role of Ophelia. His biographer Hugh Macdonald writes of Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;emotional derangement&quot; in obsessively pursuing her, without success, for several years. She refused even to meet him. He sent her numerous love letters, all of which were unanswered. 

The &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; reflects his obsession with Smithson. She did not attend the premiere, given at the Paris Conservatoire on 5 December 1830, but she heard Berlioz&#x27;s revised version of the work in 1832 at a concert that also included its sequel, &quot;Lélio&quot;, which incorporates the same &quot;idée fixe&quot; and some spoken commentary. She finally appreciated the strength of his feelings for her. The two met shortly afterwards and began a romance that led to their marriage the following year.

== Instrumentation ==
The score calls for an orchestra of about 90 players:

;Woodwinds
:
:4 bassoons

;Brass
:4 horns
:2 cornets
:2 trumpets
:3 trombones
:2 ophicleides

;Percussion

:cymbals
:snare drum (used in movement IV)
:bass drum

;Strings
:4 harps (used in movement II)

:15 1st violins
:15 2nd violins
:10 violas
:11 celli
:9 double basses
== Movements ==

Following the precedent of the &quot;Pastoral&quot; Symphony of Beethoven, whom Berlioz revered, the symphony has five movements, instead of four as was conventional for symphonies of the time. 

Each movement depicts an episode in the protagonist&#x27;s life that is described by Berlioz in the notes to the 1845 score. These notes are quoted (in italics) in each section below.

===I. &quot;Rêveries – Passions&quot; (Daydreams – passions)===
Structurally the movement derives from the traditional sonata form found in all classical symphonies. A long, slow introduction leads to an Allegro in which Berlioz introduces the &quot;idée fixe&quot; as the main theme of a sonata form comprising a short exposition followed by alternating sections of development and recapitulation. The &quot;idée fixe&quot; begins:

The theme was taken from Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;scène lyrique&quot; &quot;Herminie&quot;, composed in 1828.

===II. &quot;Un bal&quot; (A ball)===

The second movement is a waltz in . It begins with a mysterious introduction that creates an atmosphere of impending excitement, followed by a passage dominated by two harps; then the flowing waltz theme appears, derived from the &quot;idée fixe&quot; at first, then transforming it. More formal statements of the &quot;idée fixe&quot; twice interrupt the waltz.

The movement is the only one to feature the two harps. Another feature of the movement is that Berlioz added a part for solo cornet to his autograph score, although it was not included in the score published in his lifetime. It is believed to have been written for the virtuoso cornet player Jean-Baptiste Arban. The work has most often been played and recorded without the solo cornet part.

===III. &quot;Scène aux champs&quot; (Scene in the country)===

The third movement is a slow movement, marked &quot;Adagio&quot;, in . The two shepherds mentioned in the programme notes are depicted by a cor anglais and an offstage oboe tossing an evocative melody back and forth. After the cor anglais–oboe conversation, the principal theme of the movement appears on solo flute and violins. It begins with:

Berlioz salvaged this theme from his abandoned &quot;Messe solennelle&quot;. The &quot;idée fixe&quot; returns in the middle of the movement, played by oboe and flute. The sound of distant thunder at the end of the movement is a striking passage for four timpani.

===IV. &quot;Marche au supplice&quot; (March to the scaffold)===

Berlioz claimed to have written the fourth movement in a single night, reconstructing music from an unfinished project, the opera &quot;Les francs-juges&quot;. The movement begins with timpani sextuplets in thirds, for which he directs: &quot;The first quaver of each half-bar is to be played with two drumsticks, and the other five with the right hand drumsticks&quot;. The movement proceeds as a march filled with blaring horns and rushing passages, and scurrying figures that later show up in the last movement.

Before the musical depiction of his execution, there is a brief, nostalgic recollection of the &quot;idée fixe&quot; in a solo clarinet part, as though representing the last conscious thought of the soon-to-be-executed man.

===V. &quot;Songe d&#x27;une nuit du sabbat&quot; (Dream of a night of the sabbath)===

This movement can be divided into sections according to tempo changes:

* The introduction is Largo, in common time, creating an ominous quality through the copious use of diminished seventh chords dynamic variations and instrumental effects, particularly in the strings (tremolos, pizzicato, sforzando).
* At bar 21, the tempo changes to Allegro and the metre to . The return of the &quot;idée fixe&quot; as a &quot;vulgar dance tune&quot; is depicted by the C clarinet. This is interrupted by an Allegro Assai section in cut time at bar 29.
* The &quot;idée fixe&quot; then returns as a prominent E clarinet solo at bar 40, in and Allegro. The E clarinet contributes a brighter timbre than the C clarinet.
* At bar 80, there is one bar of &quot;alla breve&quot;, with descending crotchets in unison through the entire orchestra. Again in , this section sees the introduction of the bells (or Piano playing in Triple Octaves) and fragments of the &quot;witches&#x27; round dance&quot;.
*The &quot;Dies irae&quot; begins at bar 127, the motif derived from the 13th-century Latin sequence. It is initially stated in unison between the unusual combination of four bassoons and two ophicleides. The key, C minor, allows the bassoons to render the theme at the bottom of their range.

* At bar 222, the &quot;witches&#x27; round dance&quot; motif is repeatedly stated in the strings, to be interrupted by three syncopated notes in the brass. This leads into the &quot;Ronde du Sabbat&quot; (Sabbath Round) at bar 241, where the motif is finally expressed in full.
* The Dies irae et Ronde du Sabbat Ensemble section is at bar 414.

There are a host of effects, including trilling in the woodwinds and &quot;col legno&quot; in the strings. The climactic finale combines the somber Dies Irae melody, now in A minor, with the fugue of the &quot;Ronde du Sabbat&quot;, building to a modulation into E major, then chromatically into C major, ending on a C chord.

==Reception==
At the premiere of the , there was protracted applause at the end, and the press reviews expressed both the shock and the pleasure the work had given. There were dissenting voices, such as that of Wilhelm Heinrich Riehl, the conservative author of the , who regarded the work as an abomination for which Berlioz would suffer in Purgatory, but despite the striking unconventionality of the work, it was generally well received. François-Joseph Fétis, founder of the influential wrote of it approvingly, and Robert Schumann published an extensive, and broadly supportive analysis of the piece in the in 1835. He had reservations about &quot;wild and bizarre&quot; elements and some of the harmonies, but concluded: &quot;in spite of an apparent formlessness, there is an inherent correct symmetrical order corresponding to the great dimensions of the work – and this besides the inner connection of thought&quot;. When the work was played in New York in 1865 critical opinion was divided: &quot;We think the Philharmonic Society wasted much valuable time in the vain endeavor to make Berlioz&#x27;s fantastic ravings intelligible to a sane audience&quot; (&quot;New York Tribune&quot;); a rare treat, &quot;a wonderful creation&quot; (&quot;New York Daily Herald&quot;).

By the middle of the 20th century the authors of &quot;The Record Guide&quot;, calling the work &quot;one of the most remarkable outbursts of genius in the history of music&quot;, commented that it was a favourite with the public and with great conductors. Opinions differed about how much the symphony fitted the classical symphonic model. Sir Thomas Beecham, a lifelong proponent of Berlioz&#x27;s music, remarked on the originality of the work, which &quot;broke upon the world like some unaccountable effort of spontaneous generation which had dispensed with the machinery of normal parentage&quot;. A later conductor, Leonard Bernstein, said of the hallucinatory aspects of the work: &quot;Berlioz tells it like it is ... You take a trip, you wind up screaming at your own funeral. Take a tip from Berlioz: that music is all you need for the wildest trip you can take, to hell and back.&quot; Others regard the work as more recognisably classical: Constant Lambert wrote of the symphony, &quot;formally speaking it is among the finest of nineteenth century symphonies&quot;. The composer and musical scholar Wilfrid Mellers called the symphony &quot;ostensibly autobiographical, yet fundamentally classical ... Far from being romantic rhapsodizing held together only by an outmoded literary commentary, the &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; is one of the most tautly disciplined works in early nineteenth-century music.&quot;

<text>The Allied military phonetic spelling alphabets prescribed the words that are used to represent each letter of the alphabet, when spelling other words out loud, letter-by-letter, and how the spelling words should be pronounced for use by the Allies of World War II. They are not a &quot;phonetic alphabet&quot; in the sense in which that term is used in phonetics, i.e. they are not a system for transcribing speech sounds.

The Allied militaries – primarily the US and the UK – had their own radiotelephone spelling alphabets which had origins back to World War I and had evolved separately in the different services in the two countries. For communication between the different countries and different services specific alphabets were mandated.

The last WWII spelling alphabet continued to be used through the Korean War, being replaced in 1956 as a result of both countries adopting the ICAO/ITU Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet, with the NATO members calling their usage the &quot;NATO Phonetic Alphabet&quot;.

During WWII, the Allies had defined terminology to describe the scope of communications procedures among different services and nations. A summary of the terms used was published in a post-WWII NATO memo:

* combined—between services of one nation and those of another nation, but not necessarily within or between the services of the individual nations
* joint—between (but not necessarily within) two or more services of one nation
* intra—within a service (but not between services) of one nation
Thus, the Combined Communications Board (CCB), created in 1941, derived a spelling alphabet that was mandated for use when any US military branch was communicating with any British military branch; when operating without any British forces, the Joint Army/Navy spelling alphabet was mandated for use whenever the US Army and US Navy were communicating in joint operations; if the US Army was operating on its own, it would use its own spelling alphabet, in which some of the letters were identical to the other spelling alphabets and some completely different.

==WWII CCB (ICAO) and NATO alphabets==
The US and UK began to coordinate calling alphabets by the military during World War II and by 1943 they had settled on a streamline communications that became known as the CCB. Both nations had previous independently developed alphabet naming system dating back to World War I. Subsequently, this second world war era letter naming became accepted as standard by the ICAO in 1947.

After the creation of NATO in 1949, modifications began to take place. An alternative name for the ICAO spelling alphabet, &quot;NATO phonetic alphabet&quot;, exists because it appears in Allied Tactical Publication ATP-1, Volume II: &quot;Allied Maritime Signal and Maneuvering Book&quot; used by all navies of NATO, which adopted a modified form of the &quot;International Code of Signals&quot;. Because the latter allows messages to be spelled via flags or Morse code, it naturally named the code words used to spell out messages by &quot;voice&quot; its &quot;phonetic alphabet&quot;. The name &quot;NATO phonetic alphabet&quot; became widespread because the signals used to facilitate the naval communications and tactics of NATO have become global. However, ATP-1 is marked &quot;NATO Confidential&quot; (or the lower &quot;NATO Restricted&quot;) so it is not available publicly. Nevertheless, a NATO unclassified version of the document is provided to foreign, even hostile, militaries, even though they are not allowed to make it available publicly. The spelling alphabet is now also defined in other unclassified international military documents. The NATO alphabet appeared in some United States Air Force Europe publications during the Cold War. A particular example was the Ramstein Air Base Telephone Directory, published between 1969 and 1973 (currently out of print). The US and NATO versions had differences, and the translation was provided as a convenience. Differences included Alfa, Bravo and Able, Baker for the first two letters.

The NATO phonetic spelling alphabet was first adopted on January 1, 1956, while the ICAO radiotelephony spelling alphabet was still undergoing final changes.

== United Kingdom military spelling alphabets ==

=== British Army radiotelephony spelling alphabet ===
=== Royal Navy radiotelephony spelling alphabet ===

=== RAF radiotelephony spelling alphabet ===
The RAF radiotelephony spelling alphabet, sometimes referred to as the &quot;RAF Phonetic Alphabet&quot;, was used by the British Royal Air Force (RAF) to aid communication after the take-up of radio, especially to spell out aircraft identification letters, e.g. &quot;H for Harry&quot;, &quot;G for George&quot;, etc. Several alphabets were used, before being superseded by the adoption of the NATO/ICAO radiotelephony alphabet.


====History====
During World War I battle lines were often static and forces were commonly linked by wired telephone networks. Signals were weak on long wire runs and field telephone systems often used a single wire with earth return, which made them subject to inadvertent and deliberate interference. Spelling alphabets were introduced for wire telephony as well as on the newer radio voice equipment.

The British Army and the Royal Navy had developed their own quite separate spelling alphabets. The Navy system was a full alphabet, starting: &quot;Apples, Butter, Charlie, Duff, Edward&quot;, but the RAF alphabet was based on that of the &quot;signalese&quot; of the army signallers. This was not a full alphabet, but differentiated only the letters most frequently misunderstood: &quot;Ack (originally &quot;Ak&quot;), Beer (or Bar), C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, eMma, N, O, Pip, Q, R, eSses, Toc, U, Vic, W, X, Y, Z&quot;.

By 1921, the RAF &quot;Telephony Spelling Alphabet&quot; had been adopted by all three armed services, and was then made mandatory for UK civil aviation, as announced in Notice to Airmen Number 107.

In 1956, the NATO phonetic alphabet was adopted due to the RAF&#x27;s wide commitments with NATO and worldwide sharing of civil aviation facilities.
 The choice of Nuts following Monkey is probably from &quot;monkey nuts&quot; (peanuts); likewise Orange and Pip can be similarly paired, as in &quot;orange pip&quot;.
 &quot;Vic&quot; subsequently entered the English language as the standard &quot;Vee&quot;-shaped flight pattern of three aircraft.

== United States military spelling alphabets ==
=== US Army radiotelephony spelling alphabet ===

 &#x27;Interrogatory&#x27; was used in place of &#x27;Inter&#x27; in joint Army/Navy Operations.

=== US Navy radiotelephony spelling alphabet ===
The US Navy&#x27;s first phonetic spelling alphabet was not used for radio, but was instead used on the deck of ships &quot;in calling out flags to be hoisted in a signal&quot;. There were two alternative alphabets used, which were almost completely different from each other, with only the code word &quot;Xray&quot; in common.

The US Navy&#x27;s first &quot;radiotelephony&quot; phonetic spelling alphabet was published in 1913, in the Naval Radio Service&#x27;s Handbook of Regulations developed by Captain William H. G. Bullard. The Handbook&#x27;s procedures were described in the November 1917 edition of &quot;Popular Science Monthly&quot;.

=== Joint Army/Navy radiotelephony spelling alphabet ===
The Joint Army/Navy (JAN) spelling alphabet was developed by the Joint Board on November 13, 1940, and it took effect on March 1, 1941. It was reformulated by the CCB following the entrance of the US into World War II by the CCB &quot;Methods and Procedures&quot; committee, and was used by all branches of the United States Armed Forces until the promulgation of its replacement, the ICAO spelling alphabet (Alfa, Bravo, etc.), in 1956. Before the JAN phonetic alphabet, each branch of the armed forces had used its own radio alphabet, leading to difficulties in interbranch communication.

The US Army used this alphabet in modified form, along with the British Army and Canadian Army from 1943 onward, with &quot;Sugar&quot; replacing &quot;Sail&quot;.

The JAN spelling alphabet was used to name Atlantic basin storms during hurricane season from 1947 to 1952, before being replaced with a new system of using female names.

Vestiges of the JAN spelling system remain in use in the US Navy, in the form of Material Conditions of Readiness, used in damage control. Dog, William, X-Ray, Yoke, and Zebra all reference designations of fittings, hatches, or doors. The response &quot;Roger&quot; for &quot;· – ·&quot; or &quot;R&quot;, to mean &quot;received&quot;, also derives from this alphabet.

The names &quot;Able&quot; to &quot;Fox&quot; were also widely used in the early days of hexadecimal digital encoding of text, for speaking the hexadecimal digits A to F (equivalent to decimal 10 to 15), although the written form was simply the capital letters A to F.

<doc id="154676" wikidata="Q122998" url="?curid=154676" title="Pauline Viardot">
<text>Pauline Viardot (; 18 July 1821 – 18 May 1910) was a French dramatic mezzo-soprano, composer and pedagogue of Spanish descent. Born Michelle Ferdinande Pauline García, she came from a musical family and took up music at a young age. She began performing as a teenager and had a long and illustrious career as a star performer.

==Name==
Her name appears in various forms. When it is not simply &quot;Pauline Viardot&quot;, it most commonly appears in association with her maiden name García or the unaccented form, Garcia. This name sometimes precedes Viardot and sometimes follows it. Sometimes the words are hyphenated; sometimes they are not. She achieved initial fame as &quot;Pauline García&quot;; the accent was dropped at some point, but exactly when is not clear. After her marriage, she referred to herself simply as &quot;Mme Viardot&quot;.

==Early life==
Michelle Ferdinande Pauline García Sitches was born in Paris. Her father, Manuel, a tenor, was a Spanish singing teacher, composer and impresario. Her mother was Joaquina Sitches, a Spanish actress and operatic singer. Her godparents were Ferdinando Paer and Princess Pauline Galitsin, who provided her with her middle names. She was 13 years younger than her sister, Maria Malibran, a highly acclaimed and famous diva. Her father trained her on the piano and also gave her singing lessons.

As a little girl, she travelled with her family to London, New York City (where her father, mother, brother and sister gave the first full performance of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; in the United States, in the presence of the librettist, Lorenzo Da Ponte) and Mexico City, where she started her musical career.

By the age of six she was fluent in Spanish, French, English, and Italian. Later in her career, she sang Russian arias so well that she was taken for a native speaker. After her father&#x27;s death in 1832, her mother, soprano Joaquina Sitches, took over her singing lessons, and forced her to focus her attention on her voice and away from the piano. She had wanted to become a professional concert pianist. She had taken piano lessons with the young Franz Liszt and counterpoint and harmony classes with Anton Reicha, the teacher of Liszt and Hector Berlioz and friend of Ludwig van Beethoven. It was with the greatest regret that she abandoned her strong vocation for the piano, which she did only because she did not dare to disobey her mother&#x27;s wishes.

She remained an outstanding pianist all her life, and often played duets with her friend Frédéric Chopin, who approved of her arranging some of his mazurkas as songs, and even assisted her in this. Liszt, Ignaz Moscheles, Adolphe Adam, Camille Saint-Saëns and others have left accounts of her excellent piano playing.

After Malibran&#x27;s death in 1836, aged 28, Pauline became a professional singer, with a vocal range from C3 to F6. However, her professional debut as a musician was as a pianist, accompanying her brother-in-law, the violinist Charles Auguste de Bériot.

==Career==
In 1837, 16-year-old Pauline García gave her first concert performance in Brussels. She made her opera debut as Desdemona in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; in London in 1839. This proved to be the surprise of the season. Despite her flaws, she had an exquisite vocal technique combined with an astonishing degree of passion.

At the age of 17, she met and was courted by Alfred de Musset, who had earlier been taken with her sister Maria Malibran. Some sources say he asked for Pauline&#x27;s hand in marriage, but she declined. However, she remained on good terms with him for many years. Her friend George Sand (who later based the heroine of her 1843 novel &quot;Consuelo&quot; on her) had a role in discouraging her from accepting de Musset&#x27;s proposal, directing her instead to Louis Viardot (1800–1883).

Viardot, an author and the director of the Théâtre Italien and twenty-one years Pauline&#x27;s senior, was financially secure and would be able to provide Pauline with much more stability than de Musset. The marriage took place on 18 April 1840. He was 39 or 40, she 18. He was devoted to her and became the manager of her career. Her children followed in her musical footsteps. Her son Paul became a concert violinist, her daughter Louise Héritte-Viardot became a composer and writer, and two other daughters became concert singers.

Her marriage did not stop the steady stream of infatuated men. The Russian novelist Ivan Turgenev in particular fell passionately in love with her after hearing her rendition of &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; in Russia in 1843. In 1845, he left Russia to follow Pauline and eventually installed himself in the Viardot household, treated her four children as his own, and adored her until he died. She, in turn, critiqued his work and through her connections and social abilities, presented him in the best light whenever they were in public. The exact status of their relationship is a matter of debate. Other men closely linked to her included the composers Charles Gounod (she created the title role in his opera &quot;Sapho&quot;) and Hector Berlioz (who initially had her in mind for the role of Dido in &quot;Les Troyens&quot;, but changed his mind, which led to a cooling of his relations with the Viardots).

Renowned for her wide vocal range and her dramatic roles on stage, Viardot gave performances that inspired composers such as Frédéric Chopin, Berlioz, Camille Saint-Saëns (who dedicated &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; to her, and wanted her to sing the title role, but she declined on account of her age), and Giacomo Meyerbeer, for whom she created Fidès in &quot;Le prophète&quot;.

She spoke fluent Spanish, French, Italian, English, German, and Russian, and composed songs in a variety of national techniques. Her career took her to the best music halls across Europe, and from 1843 to 1846 she was permanently attached to the Opera in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

She spent many happy hours at George Sand&#x27;s home at Nohant, with Sand and her lover Frédéric Chopin. She was given expert advice by Chopin on her piano playing, her vocal compositions, and her arrangements of some of his mazurkas as songs. He in turn derived from her some firsthand knowledge about Spanish music. In July 1847, Sand&#x27;s and Chopin&#x27;s relationship came to an end. Viardot tried to heal the rift and get the two back together, but to no avail.

She arranged instrumental works by Joseph Haydn, Franz Schubert and Johannes Brahms as songs. She was the mezzo-soprano in the Tuba mirum movement of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; at Chopin&#x27;s funeral at Église de la Madeleine in Paris on 30 October 1849, which she performed together with a soprano, incognito behind a black curtain.

She sang the title role of Gluck&#x27;s opera &quot;Orphée et Eurydice&quot; at Théâtre Lyrique in Paris in November 1859, directed by Hector Berlioz who arranged the opera, and she sang this role over 150 times. She was well acquainted with Jenny Lind, the Swedish soprano and philanthropist, who had been a student of her brother.

A notable remark of hers was made to the English soprano Adelaide Kemble when they attended the late concert in London by the great Italian soprano Giuditta Pasta, who was clearly past her prime. Asked by Kemble what she thought of the voice, she replied &#x27;Ah! It is a ruin, but then so is Leonardo&#x27;s &quot;Last Supper&quot;&#x27;.

In 1863, Pauline Viardot retired from the stage. She and her family left France due to her husband&#x27;s public opposition to Emperor Napoleon III and settled in Baden-Baden, Germany. In 1870, however, Johannes Brahms persuaded her to sing in the first public performance of his &quot;Alto Rhapsody&quot;, at Jena.
After the fall of Napoleon III later in 1870, they returned to France, where she taught at the Paris Conservatory and, until her husband&#x27;s death in 1883, presided over a music salon in the Boulevard Saint-Germain. Her students included Ada Adini, Désirée Artôt, Selma Ek, Emma Engdahl-Jägerskiöld, Marie Hanfstängl, Yelizaveta Lavrovskaya, Felia Litvinne, Emilie Mechelin, Aglaja Orgeni, Anna Eugénie Schoen-René, Mafalda Salvatini, Raimund von zur-Mühlen, and Maria Wilhelmj. () Her pupil Natalia Iretskaya later became the teacher of Oda Slobodskaya and of Lydia Lipkowska, who in turn taught Virginia Zeani. She was also the godmother of Artôt&#x27;s daughter Lola Artôt de Padilla. In 1877, her daughter Marianne was briefly engaged to Gabriel Fauré, but she later married composer Alphonse Duvernoy.

On 11 April 1873 she appeared at the Théâtre de l&#x27;Odéon in Paris in the first performance of Jules Massenet&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Marie-Magdeleine&quot;.

From the mid-1840s, until her retirement, she was renowned for her appearances in Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, an opera with which her family had long been associated (see &quot;Early life&quot; above). In 1855, she had purchased Mozart&#x27;s original manuscript of the opera in London. She preserved it in a shrine in her Paris home, where it was visited by many notable people, including Rossini, who genuflected, and Tchaikovsky, who said he was &quot;in the presence of divinity&quot;. It was displayed at the Exposition Universelle of 1878, and at the centenary exhibition of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;&#x27;s premiere in 1887. In 1889 she announced she would donate it to the Conservatoire de Paris, and this occurred in 1892.

==Death==
In 1910, Pauline Viardot died, aged 88. Her body is interred in the Montmartre Cemetery, Paris, France. The Villa Viardot in Bougival, near Paris, was a gift to the Viardots by Ivan Turgenev in 1874.

==Compositions==

Viardot began composing when she was young, but it was never her intention to become a composer. Her compositions were written mainly as private pieces for her students with the intention of developing their vocal abilities. She did the bulk of her composing after her retirement at Baden-Baden. However, her works were of professional quality and Franz Liszt declared that, with Pauline Viardot, the world had finally found a woman composer of genius.

Having as a young girl studied with Liszt and with the music theorist and composer Anton Reicha, she was both an outstanding pianist and a complete all-around professional musician. Between 1864 and 1874 she wrote three salon operas – &quot;Trop de femmes&quot; (1867), &quot;L&#x27;ogre&quot; (1868), and &quot;Le dernier sorcier&quot; (1869), all to libretti by Ivan Turgenev – and over fifty &quot;Lieder&quot;. Her remaining two salon operas – &quot;Le conte de fées&quot; (1879), and &quot;Cendrillon&quot; (1904, when she was 83) – were to her own libretti. The operas may be small in scale; however, they were written for advanced singers and some of the music is difficult.

== In popular culture ==
Viardot is a character in Alexander Chee&#x27;s 2016 novel &quot;The Queen of the Night&quot;, appearing in her retirement at Baden-Baden as a teacher and mentor to the fictional narrator.

A three-act opera based on Viardot&#x27;s life, &quot;Notes on Viardot&quot;, with libretto and score by American composer Michael Ching, premiered in 2024. The story is told in flashbacks as a journalist interviews Viardot near the end of her life, and within Ching&#x27;s original compositions the music weaves in songs and melodies from Viardot&#x27;s own compositions plus arias she sang during her career.

<text>The term conjunto (, literally &#x27;group&#x27;, &#x27;ensemble&#x27;) refers to several types of small musical ensembles present in different Latin American musical traditions, mainly in Mexico and Cuba. While Mexican conjuntos play styles such as &quot;norteño&quot; and &quot;tejano&quot;, Cuban &quot;conjuntos&quot; specialize in the &quot;son&quot;, as well as its derivations such as &quot;salsa&quot;.

== Mexican ==
Mexican conjunto music, also known as conjunto tejano, was born in south Texas at the end of the 19th century, after German settlers introduced the button accordion. The &quot;bajo sexto&quot; has come to accompany the button accordion and is integral to the &quot;conjunto&quot; sound. Many &quot;conjuntos&quot; are concentrated in the Southwestern portion of the United States, primarily in Texas and California. In Mexico, the term &quot;conjunto&quot; is associated with &quot;norteño&quot; and &quot;tejano&quot; music. Since &quot;tejano&quot; was bred out of &quot;norteño&quot; music originally, this association is not entirely false. However, due to various cultural and socioeconomic developments in the 1900s, &quot;norteño&quot; musicians began trailblazing the &quot;tejano&quot; genre as a tangent to &quot;conjunto&quot;.

In the United States and Mexico, a &quot;conjunto&quot; band is composed of four main instruments: the button accordion, the &quot;bajo sexto&quot;, an electric bass, and a drum set. They are popular in northern Mexico and southern Texas. German and East European settlers brought their accordions, waltzes and polkas to the region, which were adapted by the local population. Texas accordion player Flaco Jiménez is probably the best-known conjunto musician in the United States, with a career spanning sixty years and earning him six Grammy awards. &quot;Chulas Fronteras&quot; is a documentary film from the 1970s which illustrates how the music meshed into the lives of families in south Texas and northern Mexico.

===Conjunto festivals in the United States===

The Tejano-Conjunto Festival in San Antonio began in 1982 and is presented by the Guadalupe Cultural Arts Center, a San Antonio-based nonprofit organization. It is held each May in Rosedale Park in San Antonio.

The Rancho Alegre Conjunto Music Festival in Austin began in 2012 and is presented by Austin-based Rancho Alegre, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving and promoting Conjunto music. 

The Narciso Martinez Conjunto Festival in the Rio Grande Valley began in 1993 and is presented every fall by the Narciso Martinez Cultural Arts Center, a San-Benito-based nonprofit organization.
===Other types of Mexican conjunto===
====Jarocho====
A conjunto jarocho is a type of Mexican folk ensemble. Often it consists of &quot;requinto&quot;, &quot;arpa jarocha&quot;, &quot;jarana&quot; and &quot;leona&quot;, but can also have violin, &quot;pandero octagonal&quot;, &quot;quijada&quot;, &quot;marimbol&quot; or &quot;güiro&quot;. Its repertory covers &quot;sones jarochos&quot; in , and .

====Huasteco====
A conjunto huasteco is a type of Mexican folk ensemble. Often it consists of &quot;guitarra huapanguera&quot;, &quot;jarana huasteca&quot; and violin, but can also have other violins and guitars. Its repertory covers &quot;sones huastecos&quot; in and , and &quot;rancheras&quot;.

====Arpa grande====
A conjunto de arpa grande is a type of Mexican folk ensemble. Often it consists of diatonic harp, Mexican vihuela, guitar and two violins. Its repertory covers &quot;planeco&quot; music: &quot;sones planecos&quot; in and , and &quot;rancheras&quot;.

====Calentano====
A conjunto calentano is a type of Mexican folk ensemble. Often it consists of violin, guitar and tamborita, but can also have other violin, guitarra panzona, guitarra sexta and harp. Its repertory covers calentano music: sones calentanos and gustos, and other musical forms such as Indias, malagueñas, peteneras, valses, polkas, pasos dobles, sones, chilenas, minuets, rancheras, and corridos.

== Cuban ==

Cuban conjunto music was developed in the 1940s by famous tres player Arsenio Rodríguez by adding several instruments (a piano, a tumbadora and various trumpets) to the typical &quot;son cubano&quot; ensemble, the &quot;septeto&quot;. &quot;Septetos&quot; consisted of a lead vocalist and guitar(s), double bass, bongó, maracas and trumpet. Even though the origins of the &quot;conjunto cubano&quot; can be traced to several &quot;sextetos&quot; and &quot;septetos&quot; of the 1920s, it wasn&#x27;t until the 1940s when Arsenio Rodríguez expanded the Sexteto Bellamar that the &quot;conjunto&quot; was established. However, some authors argue that the Conjunto Kubavana, conducted by Alberto Ruiz, was the first Cuban conjunto, founded around 1937. The conjunto contrasted with ballroom orchestras, the &quot;charangas&quot;, &quot;orquestas&quot; and &quot;danzoneras&quot; that were made popular by bandleaders such as Antonio Arcaño.

Conjunto music was crucial in the early development of salsa. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Puerto Rican music scene in New York City revolved around charangas such as Charlie Palmieri&#x27;s Duboney Orchestra. Their music was largely based on Cuban styles such as mambo, chachachá and, most importantly, pachanga. Key charanga flautist, bandleader and entrepreneur Johnny Pacheco switched from the charanga configuration to the conjunto in 1964. However, the first New York-based conjunto was Eddie Palmieri&#x27;s &quot;La Perfecta&quot;, which had its debut in 1962. These conjuntos would be crucial in the early development of the most successful Latin American music genre to date, salsa. Notably, the introduction of Puerto Rican music styles such as bomba and plena within the conjunto and Cuban music in general resulted in what is known today as salsa.

<text>When My Baby Smiles at Me is a popular song with music by Bill Munro and words by Andrew B. Sterling and Ted Lewis, that was published by Harry Von Tilzer Music Publishing in 1920. It was interpolated into the Broadway show &quot;The Greenwich Village Follies&quot; (1919) and was the first big hit for clarinettist, vocalist and comedian Ted Lewis (1892–1971). Ted Lewis&#x27;s jazz band recording in 1920 for Columbia Records, became his signature tune, and spent 18 weeks on the charts (seven weeks at No. 1). Ted Lewis re-recorded it several times over the years and his 1938 version for Decca also charted briefly. The tune was also covered by other artists of the time.

Benny Goodman and His Orchestra played a brief (43-second) honky-tonk version of When My Baby Smiles at Me during their 1938 Carnegie Hall concert.

<doc id="154680" wikidata="Q251251" url="?curid=154680" title="Boy Scouts of America v. Dale">
<text>Boy Scouts of America et al. v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640 (2000), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court, decided on June 28, 2000, that held that the constitutional right to freedom of association allowed the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) to exclude a homosexual person from membership in spite of a state law requiring equal treatment of homosexuals in public accommodations. More generally, the court ruled that a private organization such as the BSA may exclude a person from membership when &quot;the presence of that person affects in a significant way the group&#x27;s ability to advocate public or private viewpoints&quot;. In a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that opposition to homosexuality is part of BSA&#x27;s &quot;expressive message&quot; and that allowing homosexuals as adult leaders would interfere with that message.

The ruling reversed a decision of the New Jersey Supreme Court that had determined that New Jersey&#x27;s public accommodations law required the BSA to readmit assistant Scoutmaster James Dale, who had come out and whom the BSA had expelled from the organization for that reason. Subsequently, the BSA lifted their bans on gay scouts and gay leaders in 2013 and 2015, respectively.

==Background==

The Boy Scouts of America is a private, non-profit organization engaged in instilling its system of values in young people. At the time of the case, it asserted that homosexuality was inconsistent with those values.

When Dale was a student at Rutgers University, he became co-president of the Lesbian/Gay student alliance. In July 1990, he attended a seminar on the health needs of lesbian and gay teenagers, where he was interviewed. An account of the interview was published in a local newspaper in which Dale was quoted as saying he was gay. BSA officials read the interview and expelled Dale from his position as assistant Scoutmaster of a New Jersey troop. Dale, an Eagle Scout, filed suit in the New Jersey Superior Court, alleging, among other things, that the Boy Scouts had violated the state statute prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in places of public accommodation. The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled against the Boy Scouts, saying that they violated the State&#x27;s public accommodations law by revoking Dale&#x27;s membership based on his homosexuality. Among other rulings, the court (1) held that application of that law did not violate the Boy Scouts&#x27; First Amendment right of expressive association because Dale&#x27;s inclusion would not significantly affect members&#x27; ability to carry out their purposes; (2) determined that New Jersey has a compelling interest in eliminating the destructive consequences of discrimination from society, and that its public accommodations law abridges no more speech than is necessary to accomplish its purpose; and (3) held that Dale&#x27;s reinstatement did not compel the Boy Scouts to express any message.

The Boy Scouts appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to determine whether the application of New Jersey&#x27;s public accommodations law violated the First Amendment.

==Counsel==

Dale was represented by Evan Wolfson, an attorney and noted LGBT rights advocate. Wolfson has also worked on a number of high-profile cases seeking legal recognition of same-sex marriages. Also representing Dale on a &quot;pro bono&quot; basis was the New York-based law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton.

The Boy Scouts of America were represented by attorney George Davidson, a partner in the New York-based law firm Hughes Hubbard &amp; Reed. Davidson is a former president of the Legal Aid Society and chair of the Federal Defenders of New York.

==Decision==
The Supreme Court decided 5–4 for the BSA on June 28, 2000.

===Majority opinion===
 Chief Justice William Rehnquist&#x27;s majority opinion relied upon &quot;Roberts v. United States Jaycees&quot;, 468 U.S. 609, 622 (1984), in which the Supreme Court said: &quot;Consequently, we have long understood as implicit in the right to engage in activities protected by the First Amendment a corresponding right to associate with others in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic, educational, religious, and cultural ends.&quot; This right, the &quot;Roberts&quot; decision continues, is crucial in preventing the majority from imposing its views on groups that would rather express other, perhaps unpopular, ideas. Government actions that may unconstitutionally burden this freedom may take many forms, one of which is &quot;intrusion into the internal structure or affairs of an association&quot; like a &quot;regulation that forces the group to accept members it does not desire&quot;. Forcing a group to accept certain members may impair the ability of the group to express those views, and only those views, that it intends to express. Thus, &quot;freedom of association ... plainly presupposes a freedom not to associate.&quot;

However, to determine whether a group is protected by the First Amendment&#x27;s expressive associational right, it must first be determined whether the group engages in &quot;expressive association.&quot; After reviewing the Scout Oath and Scout Law the court decided that the general mission of the Boy Scouts is clear—it is &quot;to instill values in young people&quot;. The Boy Scouts seek to instill these values by having its adult leaders spend time with the youth members, instructing and engaging them in activities like camping, fishing, etc. During the time spent with the youth members, the Scoutmasters and assistant Scoutmasters inculcate them with the Boy Scouts&#x27; values—both expressly and by example. An association that seeks to transmit such a system of values engages in expressive activity.
* First, associations do not have to associate for the &quot;purpose&quot; of disseminating a certain message in order to be entitled to the protections of the First Amendment. An association must merely engage in expressive activity that could be impaired in order to be entitled to protection.
* Second, even if the Boy Scouts discourages Scout leaders from disseminating views on sexual issues, the First Amendment protects the Boy Scouts&#x27; method of expression. If the Boy Scouts wishes Scout leaders to avoid questions of sexuality and teach only by example, this fact does not negate the sincerity of its belief discussed above.
* Regarding whether the Boy Scouts as a whole had an expressive policy against homosexuality, the Court gave deference to the organization&#x27;s own assertions of the nature of its expressions, as well as what would impair them. The Boy Scouts asserts that it &quot;teach[es] that homosexual conduct is not morally straight&quot;, and that it does &quot;not want to promote homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior&quot;. While the policy may not represent the views of all Boy Scouts, the First Amendment &quot;does not require that every member of a group agree on every issue in order for the group&#x27;s policy to be expressive association.&quot; The Court deemed it sufficient that the Boy Scouts had taken an official position with respect to same-sex relationships. The presence of an openly gay activist in an assistant Scoutmaster&#x27;s uniform sends a distinctly different message from the presence of a heterosexual assistant Scoutmaster who is on record as disagreeing with Boy Scouts policy. The Boy Scouts has a First Amendment right to choose to send one message but not the other. The fact that the organization does not trumpet its views from the housetops, or that it tolerates dissent within its ranks, does not mean that its views receive no First Amendment protection.

The decision concluded:
===Dissenting opinion===

Justice Stevens wrote a dissent in which Justices Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer joined. He observed that &quot;every state law prohibiting discrimination is designed to replace prejudice with principle.&quot; Justice Brandeis had observed in his dissent from &quot;New State Ice Company v. Liebmann&quot; (1932) that it &quot;is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country&quot;. In Stevens&#x27; opinion, the Court&#x27;s decision interfered with New Jersey&#x27;s experiment.

Stevens&#x27; first point was that the Boy Scouts&#x27; ban on gay members did not follow from its founding principles. The Boy Scouts sought to instill &quot;values&quot; in young people, &quot;to prepare them to make ethical choices over their lifetime in achieving their full potential&quot;. The Scout Oath and the Scout Law, which set forth the Scouts&#x27; central tenets, assist in this goal. One of these tenets is that a Scout is &quot;morally straight&quot;. Another is that a Scout is &quot;clean&quot;. As these terms were defined in the Scout Handbook, Stevens said, &quot;it is plain as the light of day that neither one of these principles—&#x27;morally straight&#x27; and &#x27;clean&#x27;—says the slightest thing about homosexuality. Indeed, neither term in the Boy Scouts&#x27; Law and Oath expresses any position whatsoever on sexual matters.&quot;

What guidance the Boy Scouts gave to the adult leaders that have direct contact with the Scouts themselves urged those leaders to avoid discussing sexual matters. &quot;Scouts... are directed to receive their sex education at home or in school, but not from the organization.&quot; Scoutmasters, in turn, are told to direct &quot;curious adolescents&quot; to their family, religious leaders, doctors, or other professionals. The Boy Scouts had gone so far as to devise specific guidelines for Scoutmasters:

# Do not advise Scouts about sexual matters, because it is outside the expertise and comfort level of most Scoutmasters.
# If a Scout brings specific questions to his Scoutmaster, the Scoutmaster should answer within his comfort level, remembering that a &quot;boy who appears to be asking about sexual intercourse... may really only be worried about pimples&quot;.
# Boys with &quot;sexual problems&quot; should be referred to an appropriate professional.

Stevens ended his dissent by noting that serious and &quot;ancient&quot; prejudices facing homosexuals could be aggravated by the &quot;creation of a constitutional shield&quot;.

<text>Milton Bradley Company or simply Milton Bradley (MB) was an American board game manufacturer established by Milton Bradley (1836-1911) in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1860. In 1920, it absorbed the game production of McLoughlin Brothers, formerly the largest game manufacturer in the United States. It was acquired by Hasbro in 1984, and merged with their subsidiary Parker Brothers in 1998. The brand name continued to be used by Hasbro until 2009.

==History==
===Foundation===

Milton Bradley found success making board games. In 1860, Milton Bradley moved to Springfield, Massachusetts, and set up the state&#x27;s first color lithography shop. Its graphic design of Abraham Lincoln sold well, until Lincoln grew his beard and rendered the likeness out-of-date.

Struggling to find a new way to use his lithography machine, Bradley visited his friend George Tapley. Tapley challenged him to a game, most likely an old English game. Bradley conceived the idea of making a purely American game. He created &quot;The Checkered Game of Life&quot;, which had players move along a track from Infancy to Happy Old Age, in which the point was to avoid Ruin and reach Happy Old Age. Squares were labeled with moral positions from honor and bravery to disgrace and ruin. Players used a spinner instead of dice because of the negative association with gambling.

By spring of 1861, over 45,000 copies of &quot;The Checkered Game of Life&quot; had been sold. Bradley became convinced board games were his company&#x27;s future.

When the American Civil War broke out in early 1861, Milton Bradley temporarily gave up making board games and tried to make new weaponry. However, upon seeing bored soldiers stationed in Springfield, Bradley began producing small games which the soldiers could play during their down time. These are regarded as the first travel games in the country. These games included chess, checkers, backgammon, dominoes, and &quot;The Checkered Game of Life&quot;. They were sold for one dollar a piece to soldiers and charitable organizations, which bought them in bulk to distribute.

===Kindergarten movement===
The Milton Bradley Company took a new direction in 1869 after Milton Bradley went to hear a lecture about the kindergarten movement by early education pioneer, Elizabeth Peabody. Peabody promoted the philosophy of the German scholar Friedrich Froebel. Froebel believed and advocated that children learn and develop through creative activities. Bradley would spend much of the rest of his life promoting the kindergarten movement both personally and through the Milton Bradley Company.
In the late 1860s, Bradley became involved in the kindergarten movement. Deeply invested in the cause, his company began manufacturing educational items such as colored papers and paints. The company was hurt by Bradley&#x27;s generosity as he gave these materials away free of charge. Due to the Long Depression of the late 1870s, his investors told him either his kindergarten work must go or they would go. Bradley chose to keep his kindergarten work. His friend George Tapley bought the interest of the lost investors and took over as president of the Milton Bradley Company.

Springfield&#x27;s first kindergarten students were Milton Bradley&#x27;s two daughters, and the first teachers in Springfield were Milton, his wife, and his father. Milton Bradley&#x27;s company&#x27;s involvement with kindergartens began with the production of &quot;gifts&quot;, the term used by Froebel for the geometric wooden play things that he felt were necessary to properly structure children&#x27;s creative development. Bradley spent months devising the exact shades in which to produce these materials; his final choice of six pigments of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet would remain the standard colors for children&#x27;s art supplies through the 20th century.

By the 1870s, the company was producing dozens of games and capitalizing on fads. Milton Bradley became the first manufacturer in America to make croquet sets. The sets included wickets, mallets, balls, stakes, and an authoritative set of rules to play by that Bradley himself had created from oral tradition and his own sense of fair play. In 1880, the company began making jigsaw puzzles.

The company&#x27;s educational supplies turned out to be a large portion of their income at the turn of the century. The company produced supplies that any grade school teacher could use, such as toy money, multiplication sticks, and movable clock dials. Milton Bradley continued producing games, particularly parlor games played by adults. These included &quot;Visit to the Gypsies&quot;, &quot;Word Gardening&quot;, &quot;Happy Days in Old New England&quot;, and &quot;Fortune Telling&quot;. The company also created jigsaw puzzles of wrecked vehicles, which were popular among young boys.

===Later years===
When Milton Bradley died in 1911, the company was passed to Robert Ellis, who passed it to Bradley&#x27;s son-in-law Robert Ingersoll, who eventually passed it to George Tapley&#x27;s son, William. In 1920, Bradley bought out McLoughlin Brothers, which went out of business after John McLoughlin&#x27;s death.

Milton Bradley began to decline in the 1920s and fell dramatically in the 1930s during the Great Depression. Fewer people were spending money on board games. The company kept losing money until 1940, when they sank too low and banks demanded payment on loans.

Desperate to avoid bankruptcy, the board of directors persuaded James J. Shea, a Springfield businessman, to take over presidency of the company. Shea immediately moved to decrease the company&#x27;s debt. He began a major renovation of the Milton Bradley plant by burning old inventory that had been accumulating since the turn of the century.

With the outbreak of World War II, Milton Bradley started producing a universal joint created by Shea used on the landing gear of fighter planes. They also reproduced a revised version of their game kits for soldiers, which earned the company $2 million. Milton Bradley did not stop creating board games, although they did cut their line from 410 titles to 150. New games were introduced during this time, such as the patriotic &quot;Game of the States&quot;, &quot;Chutes &amp; Ladders&quot;, and &quot;Candyland&quot;.

The advent of the television could have threatened the industry, but Shea used it to his advantage. Various companies acquired licenses to television shows for the purpose of producing all manner of promotional items including games. In 1959, Milton Bradley released &quot;Concentration&quot;, a memory game based on an NBC television show of the same name; the game was such a success that editions were issued annually into 1982, long after the show was cancelled in 1973 (similar practices were used for box game adaptations of the game shows &quot;Password&quot; and &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;).

Milton Bradley celebrated their centennial in 1960 with the re-release of &quot;The Checkered Game of Life&quot;, which was modernized. It was now simply called &quot;The Game of Life&quot; and the goal was no longer to reach Happy Old Age, but to become a millionaire. &quot;Twister&quot; made its debut in the 1960s as well. Thanks to Johnny Carson&#x27;s suggestive comments as Eva Gabor played the game on his show, &quot;Twister&quot; became a phenomenon. In the 1960s, Milton Bradley games were licensed in Australia by John Sands Pty Ltd.

In 1967, James Shea Jr. took over as president of Milton Bradley (becoming CEO in 1968) succeeding his father. During his presidency, Milton Bradley bought Playskool Mfg. Co. and the E.S. Lowe Company, makers of &quot;Yahtzee&quot;, and &quot;Body Language&quot;.

During the 1970s and 1980s, electronic games became popular. Milton Bradley released &quot;Simon&quot; in 1978, which was fairly late in the movement. By 1980, it was their best-selling item.

In 1979, Milton Bradley also developed the first hand-held cartridge-based console, the Microvision.

In 1983, seeing the potential in the new Vectrex vector-based video game console, the company purchased General Consumer Electronics (GCE). Both the Vectrex and the Microvision were designed by Jay Smith.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Milton Bradley marketed a series of games (such as &quot;HeroQuest&quot; and &quot;Battle Masters&quot;) in North America that were developed in the United Kingdom by Games Workshop (GW) that drew heavily from GW&#x27;s Warhammer Fantasy universe, albeit without explicit reference to the Warhammer product line.

===Hasbro ownership===
In 1984, Hasbro bought out Milton Bradley, ending 124 years of family ownership. The 1990s saw the release of &quot;Gator Golf&quot;, &quot;Crack the Case&quot;, &quot;Mall Madness&quot;, and &quot;1313 Dead End Drive&quot;.

In 1991, Hasbro acquired Tonka, which included Parker Brothers. In 1998, Milton Bradley merged with Parker Brothers to form Hasbro Games. After the consolidation, Milton Bradley and Parker Brothers turned into brands of Hasbro before being dropped in 2009 in favor of the parent company&#x27;s name, since adjusted to Hasbro Gaming.

<doc id="154682" wikidata="Q560592" url="?curid=154682" title="Clifton Webb">
<text>Webb Parmelee Hollenbeck (November 19, 1889 – October 13, 1966), known professionally as Clifton Webb, was an American actor, singer, and dancer. He worked extensively and was known for his stage appearances in the plays of Noël Coward, including &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;, as well as appearances on Broadway in a number of successful musical revues. As a film actor, he was nominated for three Academy Awards - Best Supporting Actor for &quot;Laura&quot; (1944) and &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; (1946), and Best Actor in a Leading Role for &quot;Sitting Pretty&quot; (1948).

==Early life==
Webb was born Webb Parmelee Hollenbeck in Indianapolis, Indiana. He was the only child of Jacob Grant Hollenbeck (1867 – May 2, 1939), the ticket-clerk son of a grocer from an Indiana farming family, and his wife, the former Mabel A. Parmelee (Parmalee or Parmallee; March 24, 1869 – October 17, 1960), the daughter of David Parmelee, a railroad conductor. The couple married in Kankakee, Illinois, on January 18, 1888, and separated in 1891, shortly after their son&#x27;s birth. According to Marion County, Indiana, records, the marriage took place in Indianapolis.

In 1892, Webb&#x27;s mother, now styling herself &quot;Mabelle&quot;, moved to New York City with her beloved &quot;little Webb&quot;, as she called him for the remainder of her life. She dismissed questions about her husband, Jacob, who like her father, worked for the Indianapolis-St. Louis Railroad, by saying, &quot;We never speak of him. He didn&#x27;t care for the theatre.&quot; The couple apparently divorced, since, by 1900, Mabelle was married to Green B. Raum, Jr. New York City&#x27;s 1900 U.S. census indicates Mabelle and her son were using the surname Raum and living on West 77th Street with Green Berry Raum, Jr., a copper-foundry worker, who gave his position in the household as Mabel&#x27;s husband. Raum was the son of General Green Berry Raum, former U.S. Commissioner of Internal Revenue and former U.S. Commissioner of Pensions. Webb&#x27;s father, Jacob, married his second wife, Ethel Brown, and he died in 1939.

==Career==
===Broadway===
In 1909, using his new stage name, 19-year-old Clifton Webb had become a professional ballroom dancer, often partnering with &quot;exceedingly decorative&quot; star dancer Bonnie Glass (she would eventually replace him with Rudolph Valentino); they would perform in about two dozen operettas. His debut on Broadway began when &quot;The Purple Road&quot; opened at the Liberty Theatre on April 7, 1913; he played the role of Bosco for the 136 performances before closing in August. His mother (billed as Mabel Parmalee) was listed in the program as a member of the opening-night cast. His next musical was an Al Jolson vehicle, Sigmund Romberg&#x27;s &quot;Dancing Around&quot;, which opened at the Winter Garden Theatre on October 10, 1914, ran for 145 performances, and closed in the following February. Later in 1915, Webb was cast in the all-star revue &quot;Ned Wayburn&#x27;s Town Topics&quot;, which boasted 117 famous performers, including Will Rogers, as listed in the Century Theatre opening-night program for September 23, 1915. It closed 68 performances later on November 20, 1915. In 1916, he had another short run with Cole Porter&#x27;s comic opera &quot;See America First&quot;, which opened at the Maxine Elliott Theatre on March 28, 1916, and closed after 15 performances on April 8, 1916.

The year 1917 proved to be better, with a 233-performance run of Jerome Kern&#x27;s &quot;Love O&#x27; Mike&quot;, opening on January 15 at the Shubert Theatre. After moving to Maxine Elliott&#x27;s Theatre, and then the Casino Theatre, it closed on September 29, 1917. Webb also appeared that year with other Broadway stars in the &quot;National Red Cross Pageant&quot; a 50-minute film of a stage production held to benefit the American Red Cross. Webb&#x27;s final show of the 1910s, the musical &quot;Listen Lester&quot;, had the longest run, 272 performances. It opened at the Knickerbocker Theatre on December 23, 1918, and closed in August 1919.

In the 1920s, Webb played in eight Broadway shows and made numerous other stage appearances, including vaudeville, and a handful of silent films. The revue &quot;As You Were&quot;, with additional songs by Cole Porter, opened at the Central Theatre on January 29, 1920, running 143 performances until May 29, 1920. Webb was busy with films, tours, and an appearance at the London Pavilion in 1921 as Mr. St. Louis in &quot;Fun of the Fayre&quot; and in 1922 in &quot;Phi-Phi&quot; – he did not return to Broadway until 1923. He then played in the musical &quot;Jack and Jill&quot; at the Globe Theatre for 92 performances between March 22 and June 9 of 1923, followed by Lynn Starling&#x27;s comic play &quot;Meet the Wife&quot;, which opened on November 26, 1923, and ran through the summer of 1924. One of the play&#x27;s leads was 24-year-old Humphrey Bogart.

In 1925, Webb appeared on stage in a dance act with vaudeville star and silent film actress Mary Hay. Later that year, when her husband, Richard Barthelmess and she decided to produce and star the film &quot;New Toys&quot;, they chose Webb to be second lead. The film proved to be financially successful, but 19 more years would pass before Webb appeared in another feature film.

Webb&#x27;s mainstay was clearly Broadway theatre. Between 1913 and 1947, the tall, slender performer with the clear, gentle tenor appeared in 23 Broadway shows, starting with major supporting roles and quickly progressing to leads. He introduced George and Ira Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Crush on You&quot; in &quot;Treasure Girl&quot; in 1928; Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz&#x27;s &quot;I Guess I&#x27;ll Have to Change My Plan&quot; in &quot;The Little Show&quot; in 1929; &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; in &quot;Flying Colors&quot; in 1932; and Irving Berlin&#x27;s “Easter Parade&quot; in the very successful revue &quot;As Thousands Cheer&quot;. His steamy duet with Libby Holman of “Moanin&#x27; Low” stunned the crowd nightly. in 1933. One of his stage sketches, performed with co-star Fred Allen, was filmed by Vitaphone as a short subject entitled &quot;The Still Alarm&quot; in 1930. Allen&#x27;s experiences while working with Webb in the film appear in Allen&#x27;s memoirs.

Most of Webb&#x27;s Broadway shows were musicals, but he also starred in Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, and his longtime friend Noël Coward&#x27;s plays &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; and &quot;Present Laughter&quot;.

===&quot;Laura&quot; – established as character actor===

Webb was in his mid-fifties when actor/director Otto Preminger chose him over the objections of 20th Century Fox chief Darryl F. Zanuck to play the elegant but evil radio columnist Waldo Lydecker, who is obsessed with Gene Tierney&#x27;s character in the 1944 film noir &quot;Laura&quot;. Zanuck reportedly found Webb too effeminate as a person and an actor; he wanted Laird Cregar to play the role; but Cregar by then was well established as an on-screen villain and Preminger wanted someone who would surprise the audience.

Webb&#x27;s performance won him wide acclaim, and he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Despite Zanuck&#x27;s original objection, Webb was signed to a long-term contract with Fox. He worked for them solely for the rest of his career. His first film under the contract was &quot;The Dark Corner&quot; (1946), a film noir directed by Henry Hathaway; as in &quot;Laura&quot;, Webb played a suave villain. He was then reunited with Tierney in another highly praised role as the elitist Elliott Templeton in &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; (1946). He received another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.

===&quot;Sitting Pretty&quot; and stardom===
Webb was billed in a starring role in &quot;Sitting Pretty&quot;, playing Mr. Belvedere, a snide, know-it-all babysitter. It was a huge hit and Webb received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role

Fox promptly put Webb in a sequel, &quot;Mr. Belvedere Goes to College&quot; (1949) where Belvedere has to complete his college degree and acts as matchmaker. It was another box office success.

In the film &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; (1950), Webb and Myrna Loy played Frank and Lillian Gilbreth, real-life efficiency experts of the 1910s and 1920s, and the parents of 12 children. It resulted in Webb&#x27;s third hit in a row and led to exhibitors voting him the seventh biggest star in the United States.

Less successful at the box-office was &quot;For Heaven&#x27;s Sake&quot; (1950) in which Webb played an angel trying to help a couple on earth. He made &quot;Mr. Belvedere Rings the Bell&quot; (1951), with Belvedere causing trouble in an old-folks home, but the film was not as successful at the box-office as the first two, resulting in the end of the series.

Webb played a father trying to cancel his daughter Anne Francis&#x27; marriage in &quot;Elopement&quot; (1952), a minor hit. He made a brief appearance in &quot;Belles on Their Toes&quot; (1952), on a sequel to &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;, which covered the family&#x27;s life after the death of the father.

Webb then starred in &quot;Dreamboat&quot; (1952) as college professor Thornton Sayre, who in his younger days was known as silent-film idol Bruce &quot;Dreamboat&quot; Blair. Now a distinguished academic who wants no part of his past fame, he sets out to stop the showing of his old films on television. The film concludes with Webb&#x27;s alter ego Sayre watching himself star in &quot;Sitting Pretty&quot;.

Around the same time, he starred in the Technicolor film biography of bandmaster John Philip Sousa, &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; (also 1952). He was a Belvedere-like scoutmaster in &quot;Mister Scoutmaster&quot; (1953). Webb had his most dramatic role as the doomed but brave husband of unfaithful Barbara Stanwyck in &quot;Titanic&quot; (also 1953). Writer Walter Reisch says this movie was created in part as a vehicle for Webb by Fox, who wanted to push Webb into more serious roles.

Soon afterwards, he played the (fictional) novelist John Frederick Shadwell in &quot;Three Coins in the Fountain&quot; (1954), romancing Dorothy McGuire. It was a huge hit. He was top billed as a company owner in &quot;Woman&#x27;s World&quot; (1954), a corporate drama.

The British film &quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot; (1956) featured Webb playing the part of Royal Navy Lt. Cmdr. Ewen Montagu in the true story of Operation Mincemeat, the elaborate plan to deceive the Axis powers about the Allied invasion of Sicily during World War II. In &quot;Boy on a Dolphin&quot; (1957), second-billed to Alan Ladd, with third-billed Sophia Loren, he portrayed a wealthy sophisticate who enjoyed collecting illegally obtained Greek antiquities. In a nod to his own identity, the character&#x27;s name was Victor Parmalee.

He starred in &quot;The Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker&quot; (1959), a &quot;Cheaper By the Dozen&quot; comedy as a man with two families, and &quot;Holiday for Lovers&quot; (1959), a family comedy set in South America. Neither was particularly successful. Fox was developing &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; (1959) as a vehicle for Webb, but when he fell ill and was unable to work, James Mason stepped into the role.

Webb&#x27;s final film role was an initially sarcastic, but ultimately self-sacrificing Catholic priest in Leo McCarey&#x27;s &quot;Satan Never Sleeps&quot; (1962). The film showed the victory of Mao Tse-tung&#x27;s armies in the Chinese Civil War, which ended with his ascension to power in 1949, but was actually filmed in Britain during the summer of 1961, using sets left from the film &quot;The Inn of the Sixth Happiness&quot; (1958), which was also set in China.

Webb was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6850 Hollywood Boulevard for his contributions to the motion picture industry.

Webb&#x27;s portrayal of Lynn Belvedere was the model for the &quot;Mr. Peabody&quot; character in the &quot;Peabody&#x27;s Improbable History&quot; segment of the animated cartoon series &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends&quot;. And the 1980&#x27;s television sitcom Mr. Belvedere was based on Webb&#x27;s character, with Christopher Hewett in the title role.

==Personal life==
Throughout his career, Clifton Webb remained a confirmed bachelor and had no children. He lived with his mother until her death at age 91 in 1960, leading Noël Coward to remark, &quot;It must be terrible to be orphaned at 71.&quot;

Actor Robert Wagner, who co-starred with Webb in the films &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot; and considered the actor one of his mentors, stated in his memoirs, &quot;Pieces of My Heart: A Life&quot;, that &quot;Clifton Webb was gay, of course, but he never made a pass at me, not that he would have.&quot; According to a journal article published more than 40 years after Webb&#x27;s death, his sexual orientation was frequently alluded to through many veiled references in entertainment newspaper columns, though the article does not note which ones.

On the Kraft Music Hall network radio broadcast of March 25, 1948, Webb exchanged banter with singer/actor Al Jolson and pianist/comedian Oscar Levant, with Webb, then near 60 himself, charging Jolson with &quot;having aged&quot;. &quot;You&#x27;re not exactly a boy,&quot; responded Jolson, to which Levant added, &quot;He&#x27;s not exactly a girl, either.&quot;

==Later years and death==
Due to health problems, Webb spent the last five years of his life as a recluse at his home in Beverly Hills, California. On October 13, 1966, Webb suffered a fatal heart attack at his home at the age of 76. He is interred in crypt 2350, corridor G-6, Abbey of the Psalms in Hollywood Forever Cemetery, alongside his mother.

==Legacy==
UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television&#x27;s Clifton Webb Scholarship, which was established in 1969, was named in honor of Webb.

<doc id="154684" wikidata="Q1428094" url="?curid=154684" title="Sitting Pretty (1948 film)">
<text>Sitting Pretty is a 1948 American comedy film directed by Walter Lang from a screenplay by F. Hugh Herbert, adapted from the novel &quot;Belvedere&quot; by Gwen Davenport. The film stars Robert Young, Maureen O&#x27;Hara, and Clifton Webb, about a family who hires the mysterious Lynn Belvedere to babysit their rowdy children.

Upon its release by 20th Century Fox in April 1948, &quot;Sitting Pretty&quot; became a box-office success. Webb received critical praise for his performance of Belvedere, which spawned two sequels.

== Plot ==
In the suburban Hummingbird Hill, lawyer Harry King and his wife Tacey have trouble retaining a nanny for their three young, rambunctious boys: Larry and Tony, both of whom get into frequent mischief with the family dog Henry; and baby Roddy. When the latest in a string of servants (all women) quits, Tacey advertises for a replacement and hires Lynn Belvedere sight unseen. However, she discovers that Lynn Belvedere is actually a man upon his arrival, a mysterious one with many skills and achievements – and who declares himself to detest children. Nonetheless, the Kings reluctantly agree to a trial period during which Belvedere quickly wins over the boys. However, his mysterious nature intrigues both of their parents, and Harry becomes annoyed by his condescending attitude.

Before Harry goes on a business trip, Tacey agrees to take Roddy and sleep over each night at the home of their friends, fellow lawyer Bill Philby and his wife Edna, just to squelch any possibility of scandal in the town over her remaining in the house with Belvedere. When one of the boys becomes sick late that night, Belvedere calls Tacey to come over for what is a stomachache. Nosy neighbor Clarence Appleton notices the lights on and investigates, soon spreading scandalous rumors linking Belvedere and Tacey romantically. The gossip reaches Harry&#x27;s boss Horatio J. Hammond. When Harry returns triumphant from his trip, Hammond complains that Tacey is endangering the law firm&#x27;s reputation. Though Harry does not believe the stories, he still thinks it would be best if Belvedere found other employment, but he is persuaded by his wife and children to change his mind.

Later, Tacey and Edna attend a night lecture. Afterward, they go for a snack in a fancy restaurant, where they encounter Belvedere on his day off. Belvedere invites Tacey to dance. They are spotted dancing cheek to cheek by Appleton and his equally inquisitive mother, and the malicious rumors start again. This time, Harry is not so understanding. Insulted, Tacey quarrels with him, takes their youngest, and flies to her parents&#x27; home in Fort Worth, Texas.

In the meantime, we learn that Belvedere has spent the past few weeks secretly researching and writing a salacious account of the goings-on among the residents of Hummingbird Hill. In fact, the book&#x27;s blurb describes it as &quot;a screaming satire on suburban manners and morals&quot;. The published tome becomes a national bestseller, upsetting everyone in the community. Tacey rushes home and is reconciled with her husband. Hammond fires Harry and Bill, and then announces his decision to sue Belvedere, who is pleased, as he expects the publicity to increase sales of his already popular book. He hires Harry and Bill to defend him, then reveals the source of much of his information: none other than Clarence Appleton. The informant flees, with Hammond and others in hot pursuit. Despite his new fame, Belvedere agrees to keep his job as his successful book is only the first volume of what will become a trilogy.

== Production ==
The film was originally titled &quot;Belvedere&quot; just as the novel, but was changed to &quot;Sitting Pretty&quot;. John Payne was meant to play the role of the husband. Celeste Holm was also cast in the film, but exited to film &quot;The Snake Pit&quot;. Filming took place from October 23 to December 16, 1947.

Studio head Darryl F. Zanuck was immensely excited about the film in its production, while Webb – who had mostly been cast by Fox as sophisticated, superior upper-class characters – was cast in a departure from his previous genres. Webb also danced in the film, one of the rare chances he was able to showcase the dancing, singing, and comedic talents which made him popular on Broadway prior of his signing with Fox in 1944. Webb later recalled the film as &quot;the most pleasant engagement I have ever had, either in the theatre or on the screen.&quot;

Photographer Loomis Dean visited the set to photograph the filming for &quot;Life&quot; and photographed Webb together with then-unknown actresses Laurette Luez and Marilyn Monroe, who do not appear in the film.

== Reception ==
Bosley Crowther wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that while &quot;light in substance, but solid in humor, this [movie&#x27;s] material is handled dexterously by all who come anywhere near it – and especially, as we say, by Mr. Webb&quot;. He also found Maureen O&#x27;Hara and Robert Young &quot;delightfully clever&quot;.

=== Awards===
* Clifton Webb was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor at the 1948 Academy Awards.
* F. Hugh Herbert won the Writers Guild of America, Best Written American Comedy in 1949.
* The film won a gold medal at the Photoplay Awards 1948.

== Sequels and adaptions ==

While the film was successful, the particular success of Webb as Belvedere inspired Fox to produce a series of films centered around the Belvedere character. Although Fox commissioned six scripts, only &quot;Mr. Belvedere Goes to College&quot; (1949) and &quot;Mr. Belvedere Rings the Bell&quot; (1951) were made; the studio cancelled the series when the latter film was not a success.

A radio and television adaption of the film were produced. The radio adaptation was presented by &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot; on February 14, 1949. In 1956, the film was remade for &quot;The 20th Century Fox Hour&quot; under the title &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot;. The television adaption starred Reginald Gardiner in the title role. The production also served as a backdoor pilot for a series starring Gardiner which never developed.

<text>William Broderick Crawford (December 9, 1911 – April 26, 1986) was an American actor. He is best known for his portrayal of Willie Stark in the film &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; (1949), which earned him an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award. Often cast in tough-guy or slob roles, he later achieved recognition for his starring role as Dan Mathews in the crime television series &quot;Highway Patrol&quot; (1955–1959).

==Early life==
Crawford was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Lester Crawford ( Lester Crawford Pendergast) and Helen Broderick, who were both vaudeville performers, as his grandparents had been. Lester appeared in films in the 1920s and 1930s. Helen Broderick had a career in Hollywood comedies, including appearances in the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals &quot;Top Hat&quot; and &quot;Swing Time&quot;. 

Notwithstanding his family&#x27;s relative prominence, Crawford&#x27;s childhood and adolescence remain sparsely documented, with a 1977 &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; documentary segment essentially intimating that he was raised in the violent, alcohol-sodden and predominantly working class milieu of Midtown Manhattan&#x27;s Hell&#x27;s Kitchen district (long favored by actors due to its traditionally low rents and convenient proximity to various entertainment venues, most notably Broadway theatre). In the segment, he also reminisced of overnight sleepovers in Central Park with his friends.

Throughout his childhood, Crawford and his parents performed on the stage for producer Max Gordon. Despite a desultory formal education, he was accepted by Harvard College, where he ultimately enrolled. After three months of studies, he dropped out to work as a stevedore on the New York docks.

==Acting career==

Crawford returned to vaudeville and radio, which included a period with the Marx Brothers in the radio comedy show &quot;Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel&quot;.

He played his first serious character as a footballer in &quot;She Loves Me Not&quot; at the Adelphi Theatre, London in 1932. Crawford was originally stereotyped as a fast-talking tough guy early in his career and often played villainous parts. 

He gained fame in 1937 as Lenny in &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; on Broadway. He moved to Hollywood and began working in films. 

===Early films===
Crawford made his film debut for Sam Goldwyn in &quot;Woman Chases Man&quot; (1937). He was in &quot;Start Cheering&quot; (1938) at Columbia but missed out on reprising his stage performance as Lenny in the film version of &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, losing it to Lon Chaney Jr.

===Paramount===

Crawford signed a contract with Paramount. He appeared in some &quot;B&quot; films: &quot;Ambush&quot; (1939), &quot;Sudden Money&quot; (1939) and &quot;Undercover Doctor&quot; (1939). He had a good role in the prestigious &quot;Beau Geste&quot; with Gary Cooper, Ray Milland, Robert Preston, Brian Donlevy and Susan Hayward and directed by William A. Wellman.

After appearing in &quot;Island of Lost Men&quot; (1939) starring Anna May Wong, Crawford appeared in &quot;The Real Glory&quot; (1939) with Gary Cooper and David Niven. He appeared in two films for Walter Wanger and Tay Garnett, &quot;Eternally Yours&quot; (1939) with David Niven and Loretta Young and &quot;Slightly Honorable&quot; (1939) with Pat O&#x27;Brien and Edward Arnold.

===Universal===
Crawford moved over to Universal, where he was given his first starring role, in the &quot;B&quot; picture &quot;I Can&#x27;t Give You Anything But Love, Baby&quot; (1940).

He had support parts in &quot;When the Daltons Rode&quot; (1940); &quot;Seven Sinners&quot; (1940), for Garnett; and &quot;Trail of the Vigilantes&quot; (1940). He went back to Paramount for &quot;Texas Rangers Ride Again&quot; (1940) then returned to Universal for &quot;The Black Cat&quot; (1941), &quot;Tight Shoes&quot; (1941), and &quot;Badlands of Dakota&quot; (1941).

Crawford had one of the leads in &quot;South of Tahiti&quot; (1941) and &quot;North to the Klondike&quot; (1941). He supported Edward G. Robinson in &quot;Larceny, Inc.&quot; (1942) and George Raft in &quot;Broadway&quot; (1942), and co-starred with Robert Stack in &quot;Men of Texas&quot; (1942) and Constance Bennett in &quot;Sin Town&quot; (1942).

During World War II, Crawford enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps. Assigned to the Armed Forces Network, he was sent to Britain in 1944 as a sergeant, he served as an announcer for the Glenn Miller American Band. He was one of two announcers on Miller&#x27;s weekly program &quot;I Sustain the Wings&quot;, prior to Miller and the band being shipped to England. 

He returned to films with roles in the film noir &quot;Black Angel&quot; (1946) with Dan Duryea and Peter Lorre and &quot;Slave Girl&quot; (1947) with Yvonne de Carlo.

===Freelance actor===
Crawford made &quot;The Flame&quot; (1947) for Republic, and &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot; (1948) for James Cagney&#x27;s company. He went back to Paramount for &quot;Sealed Verdict&quot; (1948) and had a co-starring role in &quot;Bad Men of Tombstone&quot; (1949) for the King Brothers.

At Warner Bros Crawford was in &quot;A Kiss in the Dark&quot; (1949) with David Niven and Jane Wyman and &quot;Night Unto Night&quot; (1949) with Ronald Reagan and Viveca Lindfors. He was also in Monogram&#x27;s &quot;Anna Lucasta&quot; (1949) with Paulette Goddard.

===&quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; and stardom===

In 1949, Crawford was cast as Willie Stark, a character inspired by and closely patterned after the life of Louisiana politician Huey Long, in &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot;, a film based on the popular novel by Robert Penn Warren. The film was a huge hit, and Crawford&#x27;s performance as the bullying, blustering, yet insecure Governor Stark won him the Academy Award for Best Actor. 

The film was made by Columbia who put Crawford under contract. He co-starred with Glenn Ford in &quot;Convicted&quot; (1950), then starred in another hit &#x27;A&#x27;-list production with William Holden and Judy Holliday, &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; (1950), directed by George Cukor.

Crawford starred in &quot;The Mob&quot; (1951), a crime drama. Under the direction of Phil Karlson he starred in &quot;Scandal Sheet&quot; (1952), based on a novel by Sam Fuller.

MGM borrowed him to play the villain in &quot;Lone Star&quot; (1952), opposite Clark Gable and Ava Gardner. He went to Warner Bros. to star in a comedy, &quot;Stop, You&#x27;re Killing Me&quot; (1952).

Crawford returned to Columbia to star in some Westerns, &quot;Last of the Comanches&quot; (1953), and &quot;The Last Posse&quot; (1954). 20th Century Fox borrowed him to co-star with Gregory Peck in Nunnally Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Night People&quot; (1954).

Crawford was reunited with Glenn Ford in &quot;Human Desire&quot; (1954), directed by Fritz Lang. Edward Small used him in &quot;Down Three Dark Streets&quot; (1954) and &quot;New York Confidential&quot; (1955).

In 1955, Crawford assumed the starring role as Rollo Lamar, the most violent of convicts in &quot;Big House, U.S.A.&quot;. In the film, Crawford&#x27;s character is a hardened convict so violent he commands the obedience of even the most violent and psychotic prisoners in the prison yard, including those portrayed by such famous tough-guy actors as Charles Bronson, Ralph Meeker, William Talman, and Lon Chaney Jr.

Stanley Kramer cast him in a good supporting role in &quot;Not as a Stranger&quot; (1955) with Robert Mitchum and Frank Sinatra, which was a big hit. He received an offer in Italy to star in &quot;Il bidone&quot; (1955), directed by Federico Fellini.

===&quot;Highway Patrol&quot;===
In 1955, television producer Frederick Ziv of ZIV Television Productions offered Crawford the lead role as &quot;Dan Mathews&quot; in the police drama &quot;Highway Patrol&quot;, which dramatized law enforcement activities of the California Highway Patrol (CHP). ZIV Television Productions operated on an extremely low budget of $25,000 per episode of &quot;Highway Patrol&quot; with ten percent of gross receipts going to Crawford as per his contract. While the show&#x27;s scripts were largely fictional, the use of realistic, rapid-fire dialogue, stark film noir styled feel and Crawford&#x27;s convincing portrayal of a hard-as-nails police officer helped make the show an instant success. &quot;Highway Patrol&quot; remained popular during its four years (1955–1959) of first-run syndication, and would continue in repeat syndication on local stations across the United States for many years after. For much of the period from 1955 until 1965, most of Crawford&#x27;s television roles were for ZIV Television, among the relatively few producers willing to accept the challenges of working with the hard-living and alcoholic Crawford. Years later, Frederick Ziv admitted in an interview, &quot;To be honest, Broderick could be a handful!&quot;

&quot;Highway Patrol&quot; helped revive Crawford&#x27;s career and cement his tough-guy persona, which he used successfully in numerous movie and TV roles for the rest of his life.

During the series&#x27; run he appeared in &quot;The Fastest Gun Alive&quot; (1956) with Ford at MGM, a successful Western; &quot;Between Heaven and Hell&quot; (1956) with Robert Wagner at Fox, directed by Richard Fleischer; and &quot;The Decks Ran Red&quot; (1958) with James Mason for Andrew L. Stone.

Fed up with the show&#x27;s hectic shooting schedule, Crawford quit &quot;Highway Patrol&quot; at the end of 1959 in order to make a film in Spain, and try to get his drinking under control.

===Europe===
Crawford relocated to Europe where he starred in Vittorio Cottafavi&#x27;s &quot;La vendetta di Ercole&quot; (1960), known in the U.S. as &quot;Goliath and the Dragon&quot;.

Crawford&#x27;s successful run as Dan Mathews in &quot;Highway Patrol&quot; earned him some two million dollars under his contract with ZIV, which eventually paid him in exchange for his agreement to sign for the pilot and subsequent production of a new ZIV production, &quot;King of Diamonds&quot;. Recently back from Europe, and having temporarily stopped drinking, Crawford was signed to play the starring role as diamond industry security chief John King. &quot;King of Diamonds&quot; was picked up for syndication in 1961, but was a failure, the show lasting only one season.

In 1962, after the end of &quot;King of Diamonds&quot;, Crawford returned to acting in motion pictures: &quot;Square of Violence&quot; (1962); &quot;Convicts 4&quot; (1962); Javier Setó&#x27;s &quot;The Castilian&quot; (1963); &quot;A House Is Not a Home&quot; (1964); &quot;Up from the Beach&quot; (1965); &quot;Kid Rodelo&quot; (1966); &quot;The Oscar&quot; (1966); &quot;The Texican&quot; (1966) with Audie Murphy; &quot;The Vulture&quot; (1967); &quot;Red Tomahawk&quot; (1967).

===1970s===
After 1970, Crawford again returned to television. From 1970 to 1971, he played the role of Dr. Peter Goldstone in &quot;The Interns&quot;.

In 1977, he starred as J. Edgar Hoover in &quot;The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover&quot;. He would eventually make a series of guest appearances on several TV programs, while starring in several made-for-TV movies.

He wore the trademark fedora and black suit when he made an appearance as guest host of a 1977 episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; that included a spoof of &quot;Highway Patrol&quot;. He parodied the Dan Matthews character again that year in a commercial for Canada Dry Ginger Ale that also featured Aldo Ray and Jack Palance.

In an episode of &quot;CHiPs&quot;, Crawford appeared as himself, recognized after being stopped by Officer Poncherello, who presses a reluctant Crawford to give his trademark line from &quot;Highway Patrol&quot; (&quot;Twenty-One-Fifty to Headquarters!&quot;).

Musician Webb Wilder&#x27;s instrumental, &quot;Ruff Rider&quot; (on the album &quot;It Came From Nashville&quot;), is dedicated to Broderick Crawford in admiration of his &quot;Highway Patrol&quot; character&#x27;s ability to solve any crime committed in California by setting up a road block.

Crawford worked in 140 motion pictures and television series during his career and remained an especially durable presence in television.

Crawford is referenced in the 1977 film &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; in the scene where an Alabama State Patrol officer angrily confronts Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason) and his damaged vehicle with its horn that won&#x27;t stop blaring. When Justice starts to introduce himself, the trooper interrupts him and barks, &quot;I don&#x27;t care if your name is Broderick Crawford!&quot;

In 1979, Crawford had a cameo as himself in the film &quot;A Little Romance&quot; in which he referenced his drinking.
In 1981, Crawford played a pawnbroker named Slim, on the television series &quot;Vega$&quot;, the episode was titled &#x27;Dead Ringer&#x27; 

His last role was as a film producer who is murdered in a 1982 episode of the &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot; television series. The actor who played the part of the suspected murderer was Stuart Whitman, who had played the recurring part of Sergeant Walters on &quot;Highway Patrol&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Throughout his adult life, Crawford was prone to bouts of heavy drinking, and was known for eating large meals. These habits contributed to a serious weight gain for Crawford during the 1950s. 

Crawford&#x27;s drinking increased during the filming of &quot;Highway Patrol&quot;, eventually resulting in several arrests and stops for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), which eventually gained him a suspended driving license. Eventually the drinking strained the show&#x27;s relationship with the CHP as well as Crawford&#x27;s relationship with ZIV.

Fellow actor Stuart Whitman became a close friend of Crawford. In an interview Whitman said they both clicked upon meeting when he was first cast in an episode of &quot;Highway Patrol.&quot; Whitman indicates that when he was low on cash, he&#x27;d ask Crawford to bring his character (Sgt. Walters) back to the show, something Crawford was more than happy to do, in part because Whitman could be trusted with dialogue heavy scenes, allowing Crawford more time for drinking. Whitman said he returned the favor by helping Crawford get cast in &quot;The Decks Ran Red&quot; (1958)&quot;.&quot; Whitman promised the production that Crawford would stay sober throughout the shoot, and he did.

Crawford was married three times; he died in 1986 at the age of 74, after a series of strokes.

==Legacy==

Crawford has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for motion pictures at 6901 Hollywood Boulevard and another for television at 6734 Hollywood Boulevard.

His popularity on &quot;Highway Patrol&quot; also led to him being memorialized in the poker game of Texas Hold &#x27;em, in that a starting hand of a 10-4 (a common police radio code) is nicknamed a &quot;Broderick Crawford&quot;.

In season 14/episode 80 of &quot;Family Feud&quot;, Steve Harvey disclosed that his real name is Broderick Steven Harvey, and was named after Broderick Crawford.

<doc id="154690" wikidata="Q457165" url="?curid=154690" title="Richard Todd">
<text>Richard Andrew Palethorpe-Todd (11 June 19193 December 2009) was an Irish-British actor known for his leading man roles of the 1950s. He received a Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer – Male, and an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor nomination for his performance as Corporal Lachlan MacLachlan in the 1949 film &quot;The Hasty Heart&quot;. His other notable roles include Jonathan Cooper in &quot;Stage Fright&quot; (1950), Wing Commander Guy Gibson in &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; (1955), Sir Walter Raleigh in &quot;The Virgin Queen&quot; (1955), and Major John Howard in &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962). He was previously a Captain in the British Army during World War II, fighting in the D-Day landings as a member of the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion.

==Early life and career==
Richard Todd was born in Dublin. His father, Andrew William Palethorpe-Todd, was an Irish physician and an international Irish rugby player who gained three caps for his country. Richard spent a few of his childhood years in India, where his father, an officer in the British Army, served as a physician. Later his family moved to Devon, and Todd attended Shrewsbury School.

Upon leaving school, Todd trained for a potential military career at Sandhurst before beginning his acting training at the Italia Conti Academy in London. This change in career led to estrangement from his mother. When he learned at the age of 19 that she had committed suicide, he did not grieve long (or so he admitted in later life).

He first appeared professionally as an actor at the Open Air Theatre, Regent&#x27;s Park in 1936 in a production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. He played in regional theatres and then co-founded the Dundee Repertory Theatre in Scotland in 1939. He also appeared as an extra in British films including &quot;Good Morning, Boys&quot; (1937), &quot;A Yank at Oxford&quot; (1938) and &quot;Old Bones of the River&quot; (1939).

== Military service ==
Todd enlisted soon after the outbreak of the Second World War, entering the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in late 1939. On 29 January 1941, he was one of 26 cadets injured when &#x27;D&#x27; Block of New College was hit by a German bomb in an attack by the Luftwaffe. In his memoirs, he describes seeing the bomb pass through the ceiling in front of him before he was blown out of the building by its blast, landing on a grass bank and suffering lacerations; five cadets were killed in the incident. Todd passed out (completed the course) in the spring of 1941;. On the day he received his commission, he tried to join several friends at the Café de Paris in London, but could not get a table booked for the evening. That evening, the venue was destroyed in an air raid and 15 newly commissioned subalterns were killed.

He was commissioned into the 2nd/4th Battalion of the King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry (KOYLI). Following arctic warfare training in Iceland he returned to the UK as a lieutenant (having been promoted to that rank on 1 October 1942). For a short while he was posted, at his request, as liaison officer to the 42nd Armoured Division then applied to join the Parachute Regiment to have a better chance at seeing action. He was accepted and after training was posted to the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion, which formed part of the 5th Parachute Brigade of the 6th Airborne Division, commanded by Major General Richard Gale. On 6 June 1944, he participated in Operation Tonga during the D-Day landings. He was among the first British soldiers to land in Normandy and the first Irishman. His battalion parachuted after glider-borne forces had landed to capture the Pegasus Bridge near Caen. During the operation he met Major John Howard on the bridge and was involved in helping to repulse counter-attacks by the German forces in the area. Five days after D-Day, while still in the bridge defence area, he was promoted to captain. Todd later played Howard in the 1962 film &quot;The Longest Day&quot;, recreating these events.

After three months fighting in Normandy, the 6th Airborne Division returned to the UK to reconstitute and went back to the continent three months later as emergency reinforcements to halt the Battle of the Bulge the German offensive in the Ardennes. Short of transport as they advanced into Germany, Todd, as the motor transport officer, was responsible for gathering a rag-tag selection of commandeered vehicles to ferry troops forward. After VE day, the division returned to the UK for a few weeks, then was sent on counter-insurgency operations in Palestine. During this posting he was seriously injured when his Jeep overturned, breaking both shoulders and receiving a concussion. He returned to the UK to be demobilised in 1946.

==Career==
===Associated British Picture Corporation===
After the war, Todd was unsure what direction to take in his career. His former agent, Robert Lennard, had become a casting agent for Associated British Picture Corporation and advised him to try out for the Dundee Repertory Company. Todd did so, performing in plays such as &quot;Claudia&quot;, where he appeared with Catherine Grant-Bogle, who became his first wife. Lennard arranged for a screen test and Associated British offered him a seven year contract in 1948. He was cast in the lead in &quot;For Them That Trespass&quot; (1949), directed by Alberto Cavalcanti. The film was a minor hit and Todd&#x27;s career was launched.

Todd had appeared in the Dundee Repertory stage version of John Patrick&#x27;s play &quot;The Hasty Heart&quot;, portraying the role of Yank and was chosen to appear in the 1948 London stage version of the play, this time in the leading role of Cpl. Lachlan McLachlan. This led to his being cast in that role in the Warner Bros. film adaptation of the play, filmed in Britain, alongside Ronald Reagan and Patricia Neal. Todd was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for the role in 1949. He was also voted favourite British male film star in Britain&#x27;s National Film Awards.
 The film was the tenth most popular movie at the British box office in 1949.

Todd became much in demand. He was lent to Constellation Films to appear in the thriller &quot;The Interrupted Journey&quot; (1949). Alfred Hitchcock then used him in &quot;Stage Fright&quot; (1950), opposite Marlene Dietrich and Jane Wyman – Hitchcock&#x27;s first British film since 1939.

Associated British put him in the drama &quot;Portrait of Clare&quot; (1950), which did not perform well at the box office. Neither did &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot; (1951) for London Films, in which Todd had a dual role. Director King Vidor offered Todd a lead in &quot;Lightning Strikes Twice&quot; (1951).

===Disney===
Far more popular was &quot;The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men&quot; (1952), in which Todd played the title role for Walt Disney Productions.

Associated British put him in &quot;24 Hours of a Woman&#x27;s Life&quot; (1952), with Merle Oberon. The Rank Organisation borrowed him for &quot;Venetian Bird&quot; (1952), directed by Ralph Thomas. Todd turned down the lead in &quot;The Red Beret&quot; because he disliked the script.

Disney reunited the &quot;Robin Hood&quot; team in &quot;The Sword and the Rose&quot; (1953), with Todd as Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. It was not as popular as &quot;Robin Hood&quot; in the U.S. but performed well in Europe. The same went for Disney&#x27;s &quot;Rob Roy, the Highland Rogue&quot; (1953), in which Todd played the title role. Disney pulled back on making costume films as a result.

In 1953, he appeared in a BBC television adaptation of the novel &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; as Heathcliff. Nigel Kneale, responsible for the adaptation, said the production came about purely because Todd had turned up at the BBC and told them that he would like to play Heathcliff for them. Kneale had only a week to write the script, as the broadcast was rushed into production.

===20th Century Fox===
Todd&#x27;s career received a boost when 20th Century-Fox signed him to a non-exclusive contract and cast him as the United States Senate Chaplain Peter Marshall in the film version of Catherine Marshall&#x27;s best selling biography &quot;A Man Called Peter&quot; (1955), which was a popular success.

Even more popular was &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; (1955) in which Todd played Wing Commander Guy Gibson. This was the most successful film at the British box office in 1955 and became the defining role of Todd&#x27;s movie career.

The success of &quot;Man Called Peter&quot; led 20th Century Fox to offer Todd a four-picture contract. Associated British also signed him again for a long term contract to make one film a year, but which enabled him to make &quot;outside&quot; movies. Todd&#x27;s first film for Fox under the new deal was &quot;The Virgin Queen&quot; (1955), playing Sir Walter Raleigh opposite Bette Davis&#x27; Queen Elizabeth I. It did not do as well as &quot;Peter&quot;. He agreed to appear in &quot;Loser Takes All&quot; but had to pull out when that film was delayed.

In France, Todd played Axel Fersen opposite Michèle Morgan in &quot;Marie Antoinette Queen of France&quot; (1956), which was popular in France but not widely seen elsewhere. Fox cast him in &quot;D-Day the Sixth of June&quot; (1956), opposite Robert Taylor, which was a mild success.

&quot;Yangtse Incident: The Story of H.M.S. Amethyst&quot; (1957) was an attempt to repeat the success of &quot;The Dam Busters&quot;, with the same director (Michael Anderson) and Todd playing another real-life hero. It was popular in Britain but not on the scale of &quot;The Dam Busters&quot;. He was Dunois, Bastard of Orléans in &quot;Saint Joan&quot; (1957), directed by Otto Preminger.

===Decline as Star===
&quot;Chase a Crooked Shadow&quot; (1958) was a thriller with director Anderson for Associated British. &quot;Intent to Kill&quot; (1958) was another thriller, this time for Fox, with Betsy Drake. He returned to war films with &quot;Danger Within&quot; (1958), a POW story. Then there were more thrillers, with &quot;Never Let Go&quot; (1960), directed by John Guillermin and co-starring Peter Sellers in a rare straight acting role; Todd gave what has been called one of his best performances.

Few of these films had been overly popular but Todd was still the top-billed star of &quot;The Long and the Short and the Tall&quot; (1961), with Laurence Harvey and Richard Harris. He tried comedy with &quot;Don&#x27;t Bother to Knock&quot; (1961), then made &quot;The Hellions&quot; (1961).

Todd&#x27;s cinema career rapidly declined in the 1960s as the counter-culture movement in the arts became fashionable in Britain, with social-realist dramas commercially replacing the more middle-class orientated dramatic productions that Todd&#x27;s performance character-type had previously excelled in.

&quot;The Boys&quot; (1962) was a courtroom drama film in which Todd played the lead prosecuting barrister. He had a good part among the many stars in &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962), playing British Major John Howard whom Todd knew during the airborne action just before and on D-Day as he, Lt. Richard Todd himself had actually taken part in the 1944 landings. (In an odd twist, another actor, Patrick Jordan played the role of Lt. Todd in the movie); this was his biggest hit for some time. He appeared in &quot;The Very Edge&quot; (1963), a thriller, then he played Harry Sanders in two films for Harry Alan Towers: &quot;Death Drums Along the River&quot; (1963) and &quot;Coast of Skeletons&quot; (1965). He also had a small role in Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Operation Crossbow&quot; (1965).

In 1964. he was a member of the jury at the 14th Berlin International Film Festival.

He had a supporting part in &quot;The Battle of the Villa Fiorita&quot; (1965) and the lead in &quot;The Love-Ins&quot; (1968).

Todd claims William Wyler offered him the lead in &quot;The Collector&quot; but the actor felt he was miscast and persuaded him not to cast him. &quot;It was not the first time that I had talked myself out of a picture — there had been &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot;, &quot;League of Gentlemen&quot; and &quot;Ice Cold in Alex&quot; — but this latest stupidity of mine came when I desperately needed to make another important international film.&quot;

===Later career===
In the 1970s, he gained new fans when he appeared as the reader for Radio Four&#x27;s &quot;Morning Story&quot;. In the 1980s, his distinctive voice was heard as narrator of &quot;Wings Over the World&quot;, a 13-part documentary series about the history of aviation shown on Arts &amp; Entertainment television. He appeared before the camera in the episode about the Lancaster bomber. Todd continued to act on television, including roles in &quot;Virtual Murder&quot;; &quot;Silent Witness&quot; and in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;&quot;Kinda&quot;&quot; in 1982. In 1989, he appeared in the first episode of the sixth season of &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; in which he played Colonel Alex Schofield in the episode titled &quot;Appointment in Athens&quot;.

He formed Triumph Theatre Productions with Duncan C. Weldon and Paul Elliott in the late 1960s. This company produced more than 100 plays, musicals and pantomimes all over the country; some of them starred Todd.

His acting career extended into his 80s, and he made several appearances in British shows such as &quot;Heartbeat&quot; and &quot;The Royal&quot;. He appeared in The Royal as Hugh Hurst, a retired solicitor, in the episode &quot;Kiss and Tell&quot; (2003); his last appearance in &quot;Heartbeat&quot; was as Major Harold Beecham in the 2007 episode &quot;Seeds of Destruction&quot;.

Richard Todd was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1993.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on two occasions: in March 1960 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC&#x27;s Lime Grove Studios; and in November 1988 when Michael Aspel surprised him on stage at the Theatre Royal Windsor.

===Unmade projects===
Todd was the first choice of author Ian Fleming to play James Bond in &quot;Dr. No&quot;, but a scheduling conflict gave the role to Sean Connery. In the 1960s, Todd unsuccessfully attempted to produce a film of Ian Fleming&#x27;s &quot;The Diamond Smugglers&quot; and a television series based on true accounts of the Queen&#x27;s Messengers. He was also announced for a proposed film about William Shakespeare.

In his book &quot;British Film Character Actors&quot; (1982), Terence Pettigrew described Todd as &quot;an actor who made the most of what he had, which could be summed up as an inability to sit still while there was a horse to leap astride, a swollen river to swim or a tree to vanish into.&quot;

==Personal life==
Todd was married twice; both marriages ended in divorce. His first wife was actress Catherine Grant-Bogle, whom he met in Dundee Repertory. They were married from 1949 until 1970. They had a son, Peter (1952–2005), and a daughter, Fiona Margaret Todd born 1956. In 1960 he had a son Jeremy Todd-Nelson with model Patricia Nelson. He was married to model Virginia Mailer from 1970 until 1992; they had two sons together, Andrew then Seamus (1977–1997). In retirement, Todd lived in the village of Little Ponton and later in Little Humby, eight miles from Grantham, Lincolnshire. 

Tragically, two of Todd&#x27;s five children died through suicide using family firearms. On 7 December 1997, Todd&#x27;s youngest son Seamus Palethorpe-Todd 20, shot himself in the head with a shotgun lying on his bed at their home in Lincolnshire while home on a break from Newcastle University where he was a first year student studying politics; an inquest determined that the suicide might have been a depressive reaction to the drug he was taking for severe acne. 
Eight years later On 21 September 2005, Todd&#x27;s eldest son Peter Todd 53, also using a shotgun killed himself in his car in East Malling, Kent, following marital difficulties. Peter had been suffering depression.

Todd was a supporter of Second World War commemoration events, particularly those associated with the Normandy landings and 617 Squadron RAF. He continued to be identified in the public consciousness with Guy Gibson from his portrayal of him in the 1950s film, and attended 617 Squadron anniversaries up to 2008. He narrated a television documentary about the Squadron, and contributed forewords to several books on the subject, including &quot;The Dam Buster Story&quot; (2003); &quot;Filming the Dam Busters&quot; (2005); and &quot;Bouncing-Bomb Man: The Science of Sir Barnes Wallis&quot; (2009).

==Death==
Todd died of cancer at his home near Grantham in Lincolnshire on 3 December 2009. His body was buried between his two sons Seamus and Peter at St. Guthlac&#x27;s Church in Little Ponton in Lincolnshire. The gravestone&#x27;s epitaph reads &quot;Richard Andrew Palethorpe Todd, 1919–2009, husband of Virginia and Kitty, loving father of Peter, Fiona, Andrew, Seamus and Jeremy, Exit Dashing Young Blade&quot; (a reference to the Queen Mother&#x27;s description of him).

<doc id="154691" wikidata="Q903536" url="?curid=154691" title="Bread (band)">
<text>Bread was an American soft rock band from Los Angeles, California. They had 13 songs chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 between 1970 and 1977.

The band was fronted by David Gates (vocals, bass guitar, guitar, keyboards, violin, viola, percussion) with Jimmy Griffin (vocals, guitar, keyboards, percussion) and Robb Royer (bass guitar, guitar, flute, keyboards, percussion, recorder, backing vocals). On their first album session musicians Ron Edgar played drums and Jim Gordon played drums, percussion, and piano. Mike Botts became their permanent drummer when he joined in the summer of 1969, and Larry Knechtel replaced Royer in 1971, playing keyboards, bass guitar, guitar, and harmonica.

==Beginnings and fame==

David Gates is from Tulsa, Oklahoma. He released a song in the late 1950s entitled &quot;Jo-Baby&quot;/&quot;Lovin&#x27; at Night&quot;. Gates knew Leon Russell and both played in bar bands around the Tulsa area. Both Gates and Russell headed for California to check out the music scene there. Before forming Bread, Gates had worked with Royer&#x27;s previous band, the Pleasure Fair, who recorded one album for the UNI Records label with Gates producing and arranging. Royer then introduced Gates to his songwriting partner, Griffin, and the trio joined in 1968 and signed with Elektra Records in January 1969. Gates later explained the genesis of the band&#x27;s name:
A bread truck came along right at the time we were trying to think of a name. We had been saying, &quot;How about bush, telephone pole? Ah, bread truck, bread.&quot; It began with a B, like the Beatles and the Bee Gees. Bread also had a kind of universal appeal. It could be taken a number of ways. Of course, for the entire first year people called us the Breads.

The group&#x27;s first single, &quot;Dismal Day&quot;, was released in June 1969 but did not chart. Their debut album, &quot;Bread&quot;, was released in September 1969 and peaked at No. 127 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The songwriting on the album was split evenly between Gates and the team of Griffin-Royer. Session musicians Jim Gordon and Ron Edgar accompanied the band on drums for the album.

On July 25, 1969, Bread appeared in concert for the first time, with Gordon on drums, at the Aquarius Theater in Hollywood, opening for the Flying Burrito Brothers. When Gordon&#x27;s schedule conflicted and he proved unavailable for future outings, they brought in Mike Botts as their permanent drummer. Botts, whom Gates had previously worked with in Botts&#x27;s group The Travelers 3 as a producer, appeared on their second album, &quot;On the Waters&quot; (released in July 1970 and peaking at No. 12 on the Billboard 200). This time their efforts quickly established Bread as a major act with the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 No. 1 hit &quot;Make It with You&quot; in 1970. &quot;Make It with You&quot; would be Bread&#x27;s only No. 1 on the Hot 100.

For their next single, Bread released a re-recorded version of &quot;It Don&#x27;t Matter To Me&quot;, a Gates song from their first album. This single was a hit as well, reaching No. 10. Bread began touring and recording their third album, titled &quot;Manna&quot; (March 1971), which peaked at #21 and included &quot;Let Your Love Go&quot; (which preceded the album&#x27;s release and made No. 28) and the Top 5 hit single, &quot;If&quot;. As with the first album, songwriting credits were split evenly between Gates and Griffin-Royer.

Royer, after conflicts with other members of the band, left the group in the summer of 1971 after three albums, although he would continue to write with Griffin. He was replaced by Larry Knechtel, a leading Los Angeles session musician who played piano and harpsichord on The Beach Boys &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; album and on Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; single in 1970.

In January 1972 Bread released &quot;Baby I&#x27;m-a Want You&quot;, their most successful album, peaking at No. 3 on the Billboard 200. The title song was established as a hit in late 1971 before the album was released, also hitting No. 3. Follow-up singles &quot;Everything I Own&quot; and &quot;Diary&quot; also went Top 20.

The next album, &quot;Guitar Man&quot;, was released ten months later and went to No. 18. The album produced three Top 20 singles, &quot;The Guitar Man&quot; (#11), &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot; (#15), and &quot;Aubrey&quot; (#15), with the first two going to No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s adult contemporary chart.

==Split and reunion==
By 1973, fatigue from constant recording and touring had set in despite the band&#x27;s success, and personal relationships began to show strain, especially between Gates and Griffin. All eleven of Bread&#x27;s charting singles between 1970 and 1973 had been written and sung by Gates. Elektra Records had invariably selected Gates&#x27; songs for the A-sides of the singles, while Griffin felt that the singles should have been split between the two of them. There was also some dissatisfaction with the songs planned for a sixth album. After their equipment and instruments were destroyed in a truck accident prior to a scheduled concert at the Salt Palace in Salt Lake City in June 1973, Bread decided to disband.

Gates and Griffin returned to their solo careers with mixed results. &quot;The Best of Bread&quot; compilation album from March 1973 was a huge success, peaking at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and staying on the chart for over two years. The follow-up, &quot;The Best of Bread, Volume 2&quot;, was released in May 1974 and went to No. 32.

The reunion of the group in 1976 came about after Elektra Records expressed interest in another Bread album. Gates, Griffin, Botts and Knechtel returned to the studio that year and recorded &quot;Lost Without Your Love&quot;, released in January 1977. The title track, again written and sung by Gates, was the band&#x27;s last Top 10 hit, peaking at No. 9 on the singles chart. This comeback record reached No. 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was Bread&#x27;s seventh consecutive album (including the two best ofs) to be RIAA-certified gold. In March 1977, Elektra released a second single, &quot;Hooked On You&quot;. It was less successful on the pop chart (peaking at No. 60) but it reached No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart.

The four members of Bread (along with session guitarist Dean Parks) toured throughout the spring of 1977 to support their comeback album. After a short break, they commenced the tour&#x27;s third leg that summer without Griffin, whom Gates failed to invite after further rising tensions and Griffin&#x27;s worsening problems with substance abuse. They ended the year with no further plans to record as a group.

==Following the break-up==
In 1978, Gates enjoyed success as a solo artist with the hit singles &quot;Goodbye Girl&quot; (#15; from the movie &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot;) and &quot;Took the Last Train&quot; (#30). He then continued to tour with Botts and Knechtel as &quot;David Gates &amp; Bread&quot;, making TV appearances, including a guest shot on &quot;The Hardy Boys Mysteries&quot; which aired in November 1978. The group&#x27;s 1978 touring line-up once again included Dean Parks for their June tour of the UK and Europe. By their fall dates back in the US, Parks had left and the stage lineup had expanded to include Warren Ham (ex-Bloodrock; woodwinds, keyboards, backing vocals), Bill Ham (guitars) and David Miner (bass). This led to a legal dispute with Griffin over the use of the band&#x27;s name, of which Griffin was co-owner. In the dispute, Griffin again complained that Gates&#x27; songs were given preference as singles over his. The resulting litigation, which resulted in the Bread name being retired altogether by late 1978, was not settled until 1984.

After leaving Bread in 1971, Royer stuck mostly to songwriting (still teaming up with Griffin on occasion). As with Griffin, he eventually kicked his drug problems and his success was mostly in writing for artists in the country music field in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1994, Royer, Griffin and Knechtel re-united under the name &quot;Toast&quot;. Knechtel had continued to be an in-demand session player, backing up such artists as Elvis Costello. In September 1994, after being out of the spotlight for thirteen years, Gates released a new solo album, &quot;Love Is Always Seventeen&quot;.

In 1990, Griffin founded the country music supergroup Black Tie with Billy Swan and former Eagles member Randy Meisner. After this entity broke up, he recorded two albums as a member of another country music group, The Remingtons.

==Final reunion==
In 1996, having settled their differences, the original members Gates, Griffin, Botts and Knechtel reunited Bread for a final and successful &quot;25th Anniversary&quot; tour of the United States, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, the UK, Ireland, and Asia. This time out, the group was accompanied by Randy Flowers (guitars), Scott Chambers (bass) and a string section to help them capture the sound of the records. This tour was extended into 1997, which would be the last year the members of Bread would ever perform together. Gates and the others then resumed their individual careers. Bread was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2006.

==Life after Bread==
In 2005, both Griffin and Botts died from cancer at the age of 61. In August 2009, Knechtel died of a heart attack at the age of 69, leaving Gates and Royer as the only surviving members of Bread. Royer continues to be involved in music, initially working out of his Nashfilms studio in Tennessee before relocating to the Virgin Islands in 2013. Gates contents himself with retirement at his home in Washington with his wife Jo Rita. In 2010, Royer released a Jimmy Griffin tribute album consisting of songs written by both himself and Griffin.

During March 2014, the first biography of the band appeared, written by UK author Malcolm C. Searles, titled &quot;Bread: A Sweet Surrender&quot; (originally called &quot;Manna from Heaven: The Musical Rise &amp; Fall of Bread&quot;). It was written with the assistance of many surviving family members and musical colleagues of the band, along with exclusive interviews with founding member Robb Royer. A paperback/soft-cover edition appeared during 2017. The following year Royer published his own memoirs, &quot;The View from Contessa&quot;.

<text>The Hasty Heart is a 1949 war drama film, an Anglo-American co-production starring Ronald Reagan, Patricia Neal, and Richard Todd and directed by Vincent Sherman. The film is based on the 1945 play of the same name by John Patrick.

&quot;The Hasty Heart&quot; tells the story of a group of wounded Allied soldiers in a Pacific theatre mobile surgery unit immediately after the end of World War II, who, after initial resentment and ostracism, rally around a loner, an unappreciative Scottish soldier they know is dying.

The title is taken from the proverb &quot;sorrow is born in the hasty heart&quot;, which is quoted at several points in the film.

In Burma during the Pacific Theatre of World War II in 1945, a group of wounded Allied soldiers is at a makeshift British military hospital in the jungle. As they have all been there for some time, they have formed a strong bond. They include &quot;Yank&quot; (Ronald Reagan), the lone American, recovering from malaria; &quot;Tommy&quot; (Howard Marion-Crawford), an Englishman; &quot;Kiwi&quot; (Ralph Michael), a New Zealander; &quot;Digger&quot; (John Sherman), an Australian; and &quot;Blossom&quot; (Orlando Martins), an African. They are all under the care of Sister Margaret Parker (Patricia Neal).

Lt. Col. Dunn (Anthony Nicholls), the senior doctor of the hospital, tells the men that they will be receiving a new patient soon, and that they should be extra kind to him. He is a Scot, and while he seems to have recovered from his operation, his abnormal kidney means that he will die within a few weeks. Dunn tells the men that the Scot will be outwardly healthy until one day he will suddenly die when his kidney fails. When the Scot arrives, Cpl. Lachlan &quot;Lachie&quot; MacLachlan (Richard Todd) is very gruff and mean. He is constantly suspicious of his fellow patients attempting to make friends with him.

Margaret tries to convince Lachie to buy a regimental kilt, something he feels is too expensive to purchase, because he recently bought a house in Scotland to which he intends to return. However, during Lachie&#x27;s 24th birthday party, Margaret gives him a kilt, and the rest of his friends contribute something for his uniform. Lachie is proud, and they all pose for photos, with the others trying to answer the question of whether he wears anything under his kilt.

Lachie warms to the soldiers and opens up about his past, telling them, &quot;They say sorrow is born in the hasty heart.&quot; He reveals to Margaret that his aloof and suspicious behaviour results from cruelty inflicted on him in his youth as an illegitimate child. Later, he confesses to Yank that he is in love with Margaret and will propose to her. Yank tries to convince him otherwise, but when Lachie does propose, she accepts because that is what will make him really happy.

Dunn comes to the ward and tells Lachie that he can return to Scotland immediately if he wishes. When Lachie asks why he is receiving special treatment, the doctor tells him the truth about his condition and that his death is imminent. Lachie explodes at his friends, thinking they befriended him only because he was sick and dying. He decides to return to Scotland. Blossom offers him a necklace, but when Lachie rejects it, Yank explains that Blossom does not speak English and therefore could not have known that Lachie was dying. As he is leaving, he breaks down and says he does not want to die alone. With that realisation, he softens and decides to stay on and have his picture taken in his uniform with the men, happy to be with true friends at last in his last few days.

==Production==
Warner Bros. bought the film rights to the play from American dramatist John Patrick for $100,000 and a percentage of the profits in 1945. It originally announced John Dall would play the lead of Lachie. 

According to Vincent Sherman, the studio were hesitant to film the play, as they were worried the public was tired of war stories, but Sherman liked the play. When Warner Bros. asked the director to make &quot;Backfire&quot; (completed in 1948, though not released until 1950), he agreed on condition that the studio would also let him direct &quot;The Hasty Heart&quot;. Warners agreed, deciding to make the film in London with Associated British, a company it partly owned. The studio would provide Sherman and two American stars, Patricia Neal and Ronald Reagan, but was open to the part of Lachie being played by a newcomer.

Gordon Jackson tested for the part of Lachie, but the studio wanted someone who was more of a leading man to play the role. Richard Todd, who was under contract to Associated British, was cast, instead, after a successful screen test. Sherman said Reagan hoped to play the role of Lachie and was unhappy to be assigned the part of Yank; he claims the actor was professional during the film, but disliked it after Sherman tried to get Reagan to improve his acting in a scene.

&quot;I wasn&#x27;t right at all for the nurse&quot;, said Patricia Neal. &quot;But it was my first sympathetic part, at least.&quot;

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film ranked 10th among popular films at the British box office in 1949. However, it was a box-office disappointment in the US.

===Critical reaction===
Richard Todd was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. The film also won two Golden Globes (Richard Todd for Most Promising Newcomer – Male; and for Best Film Promoting International Understanding).

Todd later played the role on stage in the 1970s.

==TV remakes==
&quot;The Hasty Heart&quot; was remade for television in 1957 and 1983, the latter starring Gregory Harrison, Perry King, and Cheryl Ladd. King won a Golden Globe nomination for his performance.

<doc id="154694" wikidata="Q32484" url="?curid=154694" title="Marc Dutroux">
<text>Marc Paul Alain Dutroux (; born 6 November 1956) is a Belgian convicted serial killer, serial rapist, and child molester. Initially convicted for the abduction and rape of five young girls in 1989, Dutroux was released on parole after just three years&#x27; imprisonment. He was arrested again in 1996 on suspicion of having abducted, tortured, and sexually abused six girls aged between 8 and 19, four of whom were killed. Dutroux&#x27;s widely publicized trial ended with his conviction on all charges in 2004; he was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment.

Dutroux&#x27;s accomplices included his wife, Michelle Martin; Michel Lelièvre; Michel Nihoul; and Bernard Weinstein. Martin was convicted and sentenced to thirty years in prison, while Lelièvre was sentenced to twenty-five years. Nihoul, &quot;a Brussels businessman, pub-owner and familiar face at sex parties,&quot; was initially tried as an accomplice to the kidnappings but was acquitted owing to insufficient evidence; he was instead convicted of involvement in a gang that participated in human and drug trafficking, and was sentenced to five years in prison. Weinstein was never tried as he was murdered by Dutroux before being identified as an accomplice.

The lenient result of Dutroux&#x27;s first prosecution, as well as shortcomings on the part of the police in investigating his murders, caused widespread discontent in Belgium with the country&#x27;s criminal justice system, resulting in the complete reorganisation of Belgium&#x27;s law enforcement agencies. In the White March held on 20 October 1996, 300,000 Belgian citizens protested the mishandling of the case.

== Early life ==
Marc Dutroux was born in Ixelles, Brussels, on 6 November 1956 to Victor Dutroux and Jeanine Lauwens. He is the eldest of five children. Dutroux spent part of his early childhood in Burundi, then part of the Belgian Congo, where his father worked as a teacher. After Burundi gained independence in mid-1962, Dutroux&#x27;s family moved back to Belgium and settled in the village of Obaix in Hainaut Province. Dutroux later reported to have been abused by his mother and father.

In 1972, Dutroux&#x27;s parents separated and his father left the family home. Shortly after graduating from school, Dutroux left home himself and made his living as an electrician. Several years later, in 1976, Dutroux married Françoise Dubois, with whom he had two children. The marriage was marred by Dutroux&#x27;s abusive behaviour towards his family; the couple would divorce in 1983, with Françoise keeping custody of the children.

== Early criminal activity (1979–1989) ==
During the late 1970s, Dutroux found new employment as a scrap dealer and supplemented his income by stealing car parts. From 1979 onward he was convicted for a variety of petty offences including assault, drug dealing, and trading stolen vehicles. Meanwhile, he regularly visited ice skating rinks in Charleroi, Forest, and Montignies-sur-Sambre, where he would deliberately trip or bump into young female skaters in order to touch them. In October 1980, Dutroux visited a Charleroi skating rink and got into a physical altercation with another patron, Armand de Beyn, after repeatedly colliding with De Beyn&#x27;s girlfriend. A court case ended with De Beyn being convicted of assault and battery against Dutroux, although Dutroux was banned from the Charleroi skating rink.

One of his mistresses was Michelle Martin, whom he later married and with whom he had three more children.

=== Initial rapes (1985–1989) ===
On 14 December 1985, Dutroux abducted Axelle D. During her testimony, she told the police that Dutroux&#x27;s accomplice Peteghem had told her that &quot;he was part of a gang&quot; led by two gang leaders, &quot;an Italian and a crazy stupid one.&quot; Jean van Peteghem admitted to having taken part in the abduction. He said he had abducted Axelle D. with Marc Dutroux and Michelle Martin. He had lived with Dutroux after being discharged from the military and having his marriage fail.

Peteghem told police that his and Dutroux&#x27;s first victims were two girls from Morlanwelz. These two victims were never located by police.

On 7 June 1985, the first proven abduction by the two took place, the abduction of eleven-year-old Sylvie D. On 17 October 1985 the pair abducted Maria V., 19, from Peronnes-lez-Binche. Maria V. also identified a third man who took part in her abduction and appeared to be in his fifties. This man was never found by police. On 17 January 1986, Catherine B., aged 18, was abducted from Obaix in Hainaut Province. Dutroux had one or two accomplices in her abduction who were never found by police. Peteghem was stationed as army personnel in Germany during that time and could not have assisted Dutroux.

On 18 December 1985, Dutroux abducted Élisabeth G., 15, in Pont-à-Celles. Peteghem told police that Dutroux filmed Élisabeth naked and took pictures of her. At the beginning of February 1986, Martin, Dutroux and Peteghem were arrested. This had to a large extent been due to Peteghem giving out a lot of information about himself in conversations with the girls, which had been enough for police to identify him. The three were eventually convicted on 26 April 1989. Dutroux received 13 years. Peteghem received 6 years and Martin received 5 years. Dutroux received a harsher sentence because he had also committed several robberies with Peteghem. Dutroux was thus additionally convicted for the brutal robbery of a 58-year-old woman. The robbery was also committed with accomplices. One of the accomplices in this robbery was also never found by police.

The early release of Dutroux was granted by Melchior Wathelet, who was at that time the Belgian minister of justice; Dutroux&#x27;s release was ordered against the advice of both the public prosecutor and the psychiatrist who had examined him in prison, who stated that Dutroux remained extremely dangerous.

=== Granting Dutroux state assistance, sleeping pills and sedatives ===
While in jail, Dutroux managed to convince a health professional that he was disabled due to mental illnesses. That way, he was able to collect public assistance consisting of $1,200 a month from the Belgian government. He also convinced the professionals that he needed sedatives for sleeping problems. Dutroux later went on to use them to sedate his victims. He owned seven small houses, most of them vacant, and used three of them for the torture of the girls he kidnapped. Although he owned several houses, his state assistance stipend was not reduced. In his residence in Marcinelle, he constructed a concealed dungeon in the basement. Dutroux has been described by psychiatrists who examined him for trial as a psychopath.

== Crimes after release ==

On 24 June 1995, eight-year-old classmates Julie Lejeune and Mélissa Russo were kidnapped after going for a walk in Grâce-Hollogne, probably by Dutroux, and taken to his house in Marcinelle. Dutroux kept them imprisoned in the dungeon he had created, repeatedly sexually abused them and produced child pornography videos of the abuse. Two months later, in the early hours of 23 August in Ostend, Dutroux and accomplice Michel Lelièvre kidnapped An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks, two teenage girls from Hasselt who were on their way back to their holiday home in Westende following a night out in Blankenberge. With Lejeune and Russo already in the dungeon, Lambrecks and Marchal were kept in chains in a bedroom. In September, according to Martin, Lambrecks and Marchal were drugged and brought to Jumet, where Dutroux and accomplice Bernard Weinstein killed them by burying them alive.

Around the time of Lambrecks&#x27;s and Marchal&#x27;s deaths, Weinstein and a man named Philippe Divers stole a van and hid it in a hangar; after it was found there by the hangar&#x27;s owner, it was taken away by the police. Dutroux and Weinstein suspected that Divers and his friend Pierre Rochow had betrayed them, and on the night of 4 November, wishing to interrogate them about the van, Dutroux and Weinstein lured Divers and Rochow into Weinstein&#x27;s home in Jumet and drugged and sequestered them, before leaving to go to Rochow&#x27;s house to search for clues about the van. There they found Rochow&#x27;s girlfriend, Bénédicte Jadot, whom they took with them back to Jumet and questioned, before leaving again to pick up another person. While they were away, Jadot escaped and alerted a neighbour, who called the police. With Weinstein wanted by police, Dutroux decided to kill him to prevent his capture. He kidnapped Weinstein and held him in the dungeon at his house in Marcinelle between 13 and 20 November. During this time, he let Lejeune and Russo roam freely around the house. After feeding him food laced with Rohypnol, Dutroux placed hose clamps around Weinstein&#x27;s testicles until Weinstein told him where his money was hidden. Dutroux then buried Weinstein alive on his (Dutroux&#x27;s) property in Sars-la-Buissière. On 6 December 1995, Dutroux, having been recognised by Rochow, was arrested for vehicle theft. 

According to Dutroux and Martin, Lejeune and Russo were still alive in the house at the time of Dutroux&#x27;s arrest in December 1995, and Dutroux had ordered Martin to leave new food and water for the girls in the dungeon each time they ran out. Martin neglected to feed them, later claiming she was too afraid to go into the dungeon. Lejeune and Russo eventually starved to death. Dutroux initially stated that they were still alive when he returned home following his release from prison on 20 March 1996; according to him, Lejeune died that day, and Russo followed suit four days later despite his efforts to save her; during his trial, he said they were already dead when he returned from prison. An expert asserted that they would not have been able to survive the entire time Dutroux was in prison on the total amount of food and water they were said to have been given. Dutroux buried Lejeune and Russo&#x27;s bodies in the garden of the house he owned in Sars-la-Buissière, near to that of Weinstein.

On the morning of 28 May 1996, Dutroux and Lelièvre kidnapped 12-year-old Sabine Dardenne, who was cycling to school in Tournai. In a book originally published under the title &quot;J&#x27;avais 12 ans, j&#x27;ai pris mon vélo et je suis partie à l&#x27;école&quot; (and published in the United Kingdom under the title &quot;I Choose to Live&quot;), Dardenne described her time in captivity in Dutroux&#x27;s Marcinelle home, where she spent most of the time imprisoned in the dungeon and was starved and repeatedly raped by Dutroux. On 9 August 1996, Dutroux and Lelièvre kidnapped 14-year-old Laëtitia Delhez as she was walking home from her local swimming pool in Bertrix. An eyewitness observed Dutroux&#x27;s van, described it and was able to identify part of the license plate. On 13 August 1996, Dutroux, Martin and Lelièvre were arrested. An initial search of Dutroux&#x27;s houses proved inconclusive, but two days later, Dutroux and Lelièvre both made confessions. That same day, Dutroux led the police to the basement dungeon inside which Dardenne and Delhez were imprisoned; the girls were subsequently rescued. On 17 August 1996, Dutroux led police to his house in Sars-la-Buissière and, with his help, they were able to locate and exhume the bodies of Lejeune, Russo and Weinstein. On 3 September, the remains of Marchal and Lambrecks were located and exhumed in Jumet. Hundreds of commercial adult pornographic videos, along with a large number of home-made sex films that Dutroux had made with Martin, were recovered from his properties.

== Errors during investigation ==
Heavy criticism was levelled against the police for their handling of the case. In 1995, Dutroux&#x27;s mother wrote a letter to the authorities stating that she knew that Dutroux had kidnapped two girls and was keeping them at his house. After Lejeune and Russo were kidnapped in June 1995, it took police 14 months to arrest Dutroux, although he had been a prime suspect from the start, having committed similar crimes before. During the search for Lejeune and Russo, police visited Dutroux&#x27;s house, where Lejeune and Russo were held, twice, on 13 and 19 December 1995 without finding them. During the course of the searches, girls&#x27; voices were heard while searching the cellar, but police did not follow up to find the source of the voices. Detectives accepted Dutroux&#x27;s claim that the ongoing construction in his house was for a new drainage system, rather than for the new cells he was creating. Several videotapes found during the search were never looked at. Some of them showed Dutroux constructing the dungeon in which Lejeune and Russo were held. Michel Bourlet, who was appointed lead investigator, said that some of the videotapes had disappeared and that he wanted to have them all recovered and reviewed. The officer conducting the search was later promoted.

In October 1996, judge Jean-Marc Connerotte was removed from the investigation by the Supreme Court due to concerns about his impartiality after he attended a fund-raising dinner for the victims&#x27; families. Another judge, Jean-Claude Van Espen, resigned after his close relationship with Michel Nihoul came to light.

On 23 April 1998, Dutroux was allowed to view his case files. He was accompanied by two police officers. When one officer went on a break, Dutroux overpowered the other officer and was able to escape. He was captured a few hours later. The Minister of Justice, Stefaan De Clerck, the Minister of the Interior, Johan Vande Lanotte, and the police chief resigned as a result. In 2000, Dutroux received a five-year sentence for threatening a police officer during his escape. In 2002, he received another five-year sentence for unrelated crimes.

There were countless hairs found in the dungeon where the two girls were held. Judge Langlois refused to have them tested for DNA evidence even though the leading police investigator, Michel Bourlet, had begged him to have them analyzed in order to know whether more people besides Dutroux were involved. The general prosecutor of the case, Anne Thily told investigative journalist Olenka Frenkiel that all hairs had been tested, though Frenkiel claimed to have heard from sources saying otherwise, writing, &quot;How can such a senior figure lie so brazenly?&quot;

At least seven members of law enforcement were arrested on suspicion of having ties to Marc Dutroux. One of them was Georges Zico, a police detective believed to be an associate of Dutroux. According to prosecutor Michel Bourlet, Zico was charged with truck theft, document forgery and insurance fraud.

Eventually several families of victims boycotted the official trial, stating that it was a circus and there had been no progress in the case since the removal of judge Connerotte.

The investigation was also complicated by rivalry between different law enforcement bodies. Both the Gendarmerie and the Judicial Police carried out their own investigations, and both groups wanted to be the first to solve the case. In particular, the Gendarmerie refused to share tip-offs and information with the Judicial Police: most notably one from an informer that named Dutroux as a suspect and even described a hidden space that Dutroux had constructed in the basement of one of the houses he owned.

=== Statements by Senator Anne-Marie Lizin ===
Belgian Senator Anne-Marie Lizin commented on the case, saying: &quot;Stupidity (by the police) can&#x27;t be the only explanation. It&#x27;s a question of stupidity, incompetence and corruption. Dutroux must be a friend of somebody important. Or else he was being protected because he was known to be a police informant.&quot; Lizin said Dutroux was not a true pedophile, as he has been portrayed. He had a record of dealing in stolen cars, selling arms to hoodlums and trafficking in prostitution. &quot;&quot;When he discovered that men paid a lot more for little girls for prostitution, he started kidnapping them&quot;,&quot; she said. When Dutroux finally was arrested, police found in his house video films of him raping little girls. They said he did this so he could sell the films to pedophiles&quot;.&quot;

=== Attempts to have access to Dutroux Dossier from WikiLeaks blocked in Belgium ===
In 2009, WikiLeaks published the Dutroux Dossier. Belgian authorities tried to have the dossier taken down. The prosecutor general of Liege, Cedric Visart de Bocarme, said, &quot;There is some true, some false, some very disparate information here, involving some people who have done nothing wrong, who have simply been mentioned in an investigation and are thus exposed to public contempt, whereas all this material should have remained classified.&quot;

== Parliamentary investigation and escape from custody ==
A 17-month inquiry by a parliamentary commission into the Dutroux affair produced a report in February 1998, which concluded that while Dutroux did not have accomplices in high positions in the police and justice systems, as he continued to claim, he profited from corruption, sloppiness and incompetence. Marc Verwilghen, the chairman of the inquiry sharply criticized every aspect of the investigation.

== Public outcry ==
In October 1996, more than 300,000 Belgians marched through the streets of Brussels after judge Jean-Marc Connerotte was removed from the case. He was removed for attending a fundraising dinner for the families of the victims, which the court system claimed damaged his impartiality. They demanded an investigation and reform of the police and justice system. The protest was called the &quot;White March&quot;. Protesters were wearing signs that said &quot;Stop the cover-up&quot;.

To protest the prospect of a conditional release of Dutroux, a &quot;Black March&quot; was organised on the 23rd anniversary of the &quot;White March&quot;. The calls to take part in the march were made after it was made public that a court had approved the request for conditional release of Michel Lelièvre, who was an accomplice of Dutroux and had received a 25-year sentence.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; reported in 2004 that &quot;the entire credibility of the current reformist government of Guy Verhofstadt and Belgium&#x27;s very reputation as a normal civilised country is on the line.&quot;

The crimes of Marc Dutroux were covered in multiple nonfiction documentaries, one of the earliest being a British public-access TV documentary titled &quot;Witness: The Lost Children&quot; (Channel 4, 1999, directed by Helen Hill), which was narrated by Stephen Rashbrook and featured interviews with multiple family members of the victims, as well as with Claude Thirault, a next-door neighbour of Dutroux&#x27;s who had later become a police informant after raising personal suspicions about Dutroux&#x27;s activities, which had included watching small children from the street, and also being caught digging up under water tanks in an old basement, creating a space where Thirault claimed that Dutroux had planned to use for hiding children in. An episode of &quot;Crimes That Shook the World&quot; titled &quot;Monster of Belgium&quot; (Season 2, Episode 9, April 2009) was aired later on by Discovery Channel, bringing North American attention to the Belgium case.

== Trial ==
Dutroux&#x27;s trial began on 1 March 2004, some seven and a half years after his initial arrest. It was a trial by jury and up to 450 people were called upon to testify. The trial took place in Arlon, the capital of the Belgian province of Luxembourg, where the investigations had started. Dutroux was tried for the murders of An Marchal, Eefje Lambrecks and Bernard Weinstein. Dutroux was also charged with a host of other crimes: auto theft, abduction, attempted murder and attempted abduction, molestation, and three unrelated rapes of women from Slovakia.

Martin was tried as an accomplice, as were Lelièvre and Michel Nihoul. To protect the accused, they were made to sit in a glass cage during the trial. In the first week of the trial, photos of Dutroux&#x27;s face were not allowed to be printed in Belgian newspapers for privacy reasons; this ban remained in force until 9 March.

In a rare move, the jury at the assizes trial publicly protested the presiding judge Stéphane Goux&#x27;s handling of the debates and the victims&#x27; testimonies. On 14 June 2004, after three months of trial, the jury went into seclusion to reach their verdicts on Dutroux and the three other accused. Verdicts were returned on 17 June 2004 after three days of deliberation. Dutroux, Martin and Lelièvre were found guilty on all charges; the jury were unable to reach a verdict on Nihoul&#x27;s role.

=== Dutroux&#x27;s testimony ===
Dutroux claimed that he was a low dog in a powerful pedophile network. He further claimed that Michel Nihoul was the organizer of their abductions. While admitting some abductions, he denied being a murderer, although he had earlier confessed to killing Weinstein. He said that he did torture and abuse all of the girls but denied killing any of them until the very end. Dutroux further denied kidnapping, raping and murdering Julie Lejeune and Mélissa Russo. He, however, admitted to incarcerating them at one of his houses. In the case of Lejeune and Russo, Dutroux also claimed that he had &quot;protected them from a powerful and sinister child sex ring.&quot; His testimony that he never raped Lejeune and Russo was somewhat supported by examinations by psychiatrists in 1996, which stated that Dutroux did not fit the paedophile profile. He was not attracted to children, but he might have chosen to abduct younger victims because they were easier to manipulate and control. Dutroux admitted to the abduction and rape of the other girls. He also admitted to burying his accomplice, Bernard Weinstein, alive for &quot;&quot;&quot;letting the girls die.&quot; Dutroux further said that two unidentified policemen had taken part with him in the kidnapping of An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks. He boasted about having built the dungeon in which Marchal and Lambrecks were held for a while. He said: &quot;I wanted to create a hiding place to spare them from being sent to a prostitution ring.&quot; Dutroux admitted to raping Lambrecks. He said that Weinstein had raped Marchal. He also admitted to drugging both of them. Dutroux also admitted that he kidnapped Sabine Dardenne and raped her. He admitted to kidnapping and raping Laetitia Delhez but not handing them over to Nihoul &quot;to spare them the fate of An and Eefje.&quot; Dutroux&#x27;s lawyer, Xavier Magnee, repeatedly said that the prosecution never followed up on evidence of a network surrounding Dutroux.

=== Michelle Martin&#x27;s testimony ===
Martin testified that Dutroux and Weinstein kidnapped Lejeune and Russo. She also said that Dutroux had told her that he had murdered Weinstein. Martin further said that Dutroux and Weinstein had killed Marchal and Lambrecks. She further testified that Lejeune and Russo starved to death in their basement in 1996 while Dutroux was in jail. She claims that she was too scared to descend to the basement.

Martin said that Dutroux had already decided to abduct girls in 1985. He had said that it was easier to abduct and rape girls than to start affairs with them. This way he would also have more resources and time to spend on her. So she had to help him with the abductions.

=== Sentencing ===
The death penalty was abolished in Belgium in 1996. The last execution for common-law crimes was in 1918. However, the majority of Belgians, at the time of the trial, would have supported Dutroux receiving the death penalty. On 22 June 2004, Dutroux received the maximum sentence of life imprisonment, while Martin received 30 years and Lelièvre 25 years. The jury was asked to go back into seclusion to decide whether or not Nihoul was an accomplice.

On 23 June, Dutroux lodged an appeal against his sentence.

Although Nihoul was acquitted of kidnapping and conspiracy charges, he was convicted on drug-related charges and was sentenced to five years&#x27; imprisonment. Nihoul was released in the spring of 2006. He resided in Zeebrugge until his death on 23 October 2019.

On 19 August 2012, about 2,000 people in Brussels demonstrated against Martin&#x27;s possible early release from prison. She has since been paroled, 16 years into her sentence, and was released into the care of the Poor Clares in Malonne. She was given shelter, although she was not part of the community. The sisters have declared that they were not her guardian and shelter was given under the condition that she would not violate the conditions of her parole. As the convent has since been sold, she has had to find new shelter or go back to prison. A former judge has created an apartment in his converted farmhouse, where she now lives.

On 4 February 2013, Dutroux requested the court in Brussels for an early release from prison. He insisted that he was &quot;no longer dangerous&quot; and wanted to be released into house arrest with an electronic tag (ankle bracelet) placed upon him. On 18 February, the court denied his request. Dutroux is currently being held in solitary confinement in the prison of Nivelles.

In October 2019, Dutroux won the pre-parole right to a psychiatric assessment, which was supposed to take place in May 2020 but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Michel Nihoul ===
Michel Nihoul was a businessman known to frequently attend sex parties. He was accused of being the brains behind the child kidnapping and abuse operation around Dutroux. Nihoul&#x27;s lawyer in the case, Frederic Clement de Clety, denied all charges made against Nihoul by Dutroux and called him a &quot;liar and manipulator.&quot; When the investigative journalist Olenka Frenkiel met Nihoul in Brussels, he reportedly greeted her with the words &quot;I am the monster of Belgium.&quot; He told her that he was certain that he would never be prosecuted. During the encounter, he grabbed her, tickled her and pulled her onto him so that she called for her colleagues to help her get away from him. Frenkiel was working on a documentary on the case for the BBC. In 2004, at the end of the Dutroux case trial, he was released of all charges of child abduction. In May 2010, the Belgian prosecutor&#x27;s office dropped all charges against Nihoul relating to participation in a paedophile ring in the absence of any tangible evidence.

=== Judges ===
* Jean-Marc Connerotte (on his initiative two girls were rescued, was removed from the case for attending a fundraising dinner for families)
* Jacques Langlois (investigating magistrate). Dutroux case was his first assignment
* Stephane Goux (judge presiding over verdict)
* Jean-Claude Van Espen (was in charge of the murder investigation of Christine van Hees, resigned from the Dutroux case and the murder investigation around van Hees after his close ties to Michel Nihoul were made public in 1998)

== Effects in Belgium ==
The Dutroux case is so infamous that between 1996 and 1998 over a third of Belgians with the surname &quot;Dutroux&quot; applied for a surname change.

== Allegations of wider involvement ==
Belief in a paedophile network which included high-ranking members of the Belgian establishment and a conspiracy to keep it hidden became widespread in Belgium. Press reports claimed that, prior to his removal, Connerotte was on the verge of publicly disclosing the names of high-level government officials who had been recognized on video-tapes. Connerotte had said that the businessman Michel Nihoul was the brains behind the child kidnapping operation, and would testify in the trial that there had been high-level murder plots to stop his investigation. Investigators also believed that Dutroux and Nihoul were planning on a long-distance prostitution trafficking network involving cars and the import of girls from Slovakia, though no evidence of this was ever uncovered.

Dutroux and his fellow accused supported the conspiracy narrative. Michel Lelièvre, the accomplice of Marc Dutroux, said that the two girls, Lejeune and Russo, were kidnapped as an order by a third party. However, while under arrest, Lelièvre stopped cooperating with the authorities. He told police that he had been threatened and could not risk saying any more. Dutroux&#x27;s lawyer, Xavier Magnee, said during the trial proceedings &quot;I speak not only as a lawyer, but also as a citizen and father. He was not the only devil. Out of the 6000 hair samples that were found in the basement cellar where some of the victims were held, 25 &quot;unknown&quot; DNA profiles were discovered. There were people in that cellar that are not now accused.&quot; The prosecution never attempted to match those DNA profiles to people implicated in the case.

Focus was also placed on the material wealth of Dutroux, who owned ten houses. He was in total worth 6 million Belgian francs (US$130,000). While he had all of this wealth in property he also received public assistance of $1,200 a month. Documents released by WikiLeaks show that large sums of money in different currencies arrived in Michelle Martin&#x27;s bank account, and claimed to be linked in time to the disappearances of the abducted girls. Both the transfers and the value of the six properties that Dutroux owned suggested to investigators that he was financed by a larger paedophile and prostitution ring. The Flemish newspaper &quot;Nieuwsblad&quot; reported that he had committed health-insurance fund fraud, theft, insurance fraud and investments on the stock market and that these had contributed to his wealth.

An undated letter was found in a house belonging to Bernard Weinstein, mentioning a gift for the &quot;high priestress&quot;. The note was signed &quot;Anubis&quot;. A member of the Abraxas cult in Charleroi used the same alias, leading police to conduct a raid on the cult headquarters by 150 officers, taking away much of the cult&#x27;s paraphernalia. No connection to Dutroux was uncovered in the raid, and no evidence that Weinstein had been a satanist or connected to the cult emerged. Stories of human sacrifices and trafficking by the cult were likewise never substantiated.

Much attention was given to the so-called X-files, interviews with witnesses who had answered judge Connerotte&#x27;s appeal to come forward. Witness X1, Régina Louf, told of parties organised by Nihoul that included forced prostitution and murder. She also claimed to have been present at several unsolved murders of girls in the 1980s, and pointed to Dutroux and Nihoul as culprits. The interviews were led by officer De Baets, who came under criticism for leading the witness. In one case, Louf pointing out the wrong photo of a murder victim was noted as a correct identification, since Louf had exhibited a &quot;non-verbal&quot; reaction to the correct photo. Another identified victim was later determined to have been killed by an unrelated individual. De Baets and his team were removed from the case, and the prosecutors dismissed Louf&#x27;s statements. In 1997, De Baets was charged with falsifying the statements of Louf, but was exonerated from the charges in 1999.

Other X witnesses recounted instances where children were chased through the woods with Dobermans, or told of gatherings that involved sex orgies with minors, torture and murder with a secretary general of NATO present.

Three journalists later wrote a book called &quot;The X-Files: What Belgium Was Not Supposed to Know About the Dutroux Affair&quot;, that claimed that the X witnesses were much more believable than stated by the media. But it also stated that there had been substantial efforts by the magistrates and senior police officials to demolish the testimony of the X-witnesses.

Journalist Olenka Frenkiel claims that more than 20 potential witnesses in the case have died in mysterious circumstances. Frenkiel cites Bruno Tagliaferro as an example, who was found dead after claiming to have knowledge of the abduction vehicle used by Dutroux. Though Tagliaferro&#x27;s cause of death was ruled as a heart attack, American analysts later determined that he had been poisoned. Frenkiel&#x27;s article alleges that Tagliaferro&#x27;s wife, Fabienne Jaupart, who was determined to find her husband&#x27;s killer, was reportedly found dead as well after her mattress had been set on fire.

== Dutroux&#x27;s houses ==
Marc Dutroux owned seven houses, four of which he used for his kidnappings:
* The house on the Avenue de Philippeville 128 in Marcinelle is most often cited in the media. All victims were held captive here in the basement and bedroom. The municipality of Charleroi seized ownership of this house, because of what happened there and the bad state of the house. There are plans to create an open space with a memorial site here. In the Belgian procedure of compulsory purchase, an owner has the last right to visit a house. Therefore, Dutroux visited this house on 10 September 2009, under heavy police guard. Demolition of this house started at 6 June 2022. A commemorative garden has been built in its place.
* A house in Jumet, that has since been demolished. The remains of An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks were found buried in the garden of this house. Bernard Weinstein lived in this house for a while. A small monument is placed at this location.
* A house in Marchienne-au-Pont. Julie Lejeune and Mélissa Russo were held captive here for a short while after their kidnapping.
* A house in Sars-la-Buissière. The bodies of Lejeune, Russo and Weinstein were found buried in the garden. The house was bought by the municipality of Lobbes in the first months of 2009. It is planned to make a park with a monument commemorating Dutroux&#x27;s victims here.

* 17 June 2004 – Dutroux is found guilty of several murders.
* 22 June 2004 – Dutroux is sentenced to life imprisonment. Michelle Martin is sentenced to 30 years in prison and Michel Lelièvre to 25 years. Michel Nihoul is convicted to 5 years on drug-related charges. Dutroux appeals to cassation.
* 16 December 2004 – The Court of Cassation finds that no procedural errors were made. The penalties continue to apply.
* October 2005 – Lelièvre asks for the first time to be released conditionally. The request is denied because he has not yet reimbursed his victims.

=== Releases ===
* 31 July 2012 – The criminal court once again decides to release Michelle Martin conditionally. The monastery of the Poor Klaren in Malonne is prepared to receive her. However, the Public Prosecution Service appeals to cassation, and Martin&#x27;s release leads to protests.
* 19 August 2012 – The families of Julie Lejeune and An Marchal, together with Laetitia Delhez, organize a demonstration against Martin&#x27;s release with 5,000 participants.

* 13 September 2012 – Dutroux applies to be released with an ankle strap (which can be permitted six months prior to the first appearance before the criminal court). According to Ronny Baudewijn, Dutroux&#x27;s lawyer, he had spent hours discussing repentance and regret with him, which Dutroux appears to lack. Dutroux finds it regrettable that people have died, but does not feel guilty. As a psychopath, he cannot empathize with others and only sees what he feels he is entitled to, according to Baudewijn.

* October 2020 - Dutroux&#x27;s lawyer, Bruno Dayez, discloses that Dutroux will not be pursuing parole after an evaluation by three psychiatrists unequivocally opposes his release. The psychiatrists&#x27; 90-page report on Dutroux describes him as a &quot;sadistic psychopath who has no remorse for his victims&quot; and a &quot;maximum risk&quot; with a high chance of reoffending.
* 26 August 2022 - Michelle Martin is unconditionally released.

<doc id="154695" wikidata="Q36290" url="?curid=154695" title="Diana Ross">
<text>Diana Ross (born March 26, 1944) is an American singer and actress. Known as the &quot;Queen of Motown Records&quot;, she was the lead singer of the vocal group the Supremes, who became Motown&#x27;s most successful act during the 1960s and one of the world&#x27;s best-selling girl groups of all time. They remain the best-charting female group in history, with a total of 12 number-one pop singles on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Following her departure from the Supremes in 1970, Ross embarked on a successful solo music career with the release of her eponymous debut solo album. She went on to release 26 studio albums, including &quot;Touch Me in the Morning&quot; (1973), &quot;Diana Ross&quot; (1976), &quot;Diana&quot; (1980), &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; (1981) and &quot;Swept Away&quot; (1984). Her singles &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough&quot;, &quot;Touch Me in the Morning&quot;, &quot;Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You&#x27;re Going To)&quot;, &quot;Love Hangover&quot;, &quot;Upside Down&quot; and &quot;Endless Love&quot;, all topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, making her the female solo act with the most number-one songs in the United States at the time. Her success continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s with global hits, including &quot;I&#x27;m Coming Out&quot;, &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;, &quot;All of You&quot;, &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;, &quot;If We Hold on Together&quot;, and &quot;When You Tell Me That You Love Me&quot;.

Ross has also achieved mainstream success and recognition as an actress. Her first role was her Golden Globe Award-winning and Academy Award-nominated portrayal of Billie Holiday in the film &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot; (1972), which made her the first African-American actress to receive an Academy Award nomination for a debut film performance. The film&#x27;s soundtrack became her only solo album to reach number-one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. She also starred in two other feature films, &quot;Mahogany&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Wiz&quot; (1978), and later appeared in the television films &quot;Out of Darkness&quot; (1994), for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, and &quot;Double Platinum&quot; (1999).

Ross was named the &quot;Female Entertainer of the Century&quot; by &quot;Billboard&quot; in 1976. Since her solo career began in 1970, Ross has sold over 100 million records worldwide. She is the only female artist to have had U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one singles as a solo artist, as the other half of a duet, as a member of a trio, and as an ensemble member, a total of 18. In 2021, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked her the 30th greatest Hot 100 artist of all time. Her hits as a Supreme and a solo artist combined put Ross among the top-five artists on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart from 1955 to 2018. She has scored a top 75 U.K. hit single for a record 33 consecutive years (1964–1996). In 1988, Ross was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Supremes, and is one of the rare performers to have two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She was the recipient of a Special Tony Award in 1977, the Kennedy Center Honors in 2007, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012 and 2023 (becoming the first woman to win the award twice, the latter as a member of the Supremes), and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016.

==Early life==

Diana Ross was born in Detroit, Michigan, on March 26, 1944. She was the second of six children born to Ernestine (née Moten; January 27, 1916October 9, 1984) and Fred Ross Sr. (July 4, 1920November 21, 2007). Her mother named her Diane, but the birth certificate was mistakenly filled out with the name Diana. Her family and Detroit friends called her Diane all her life. Ross grew up with two sisters (Barbara and Rita) and three brothers: Arthur; Fred Jr.; and Wilbert, also known as Chico. Ross was raised Baptist.

Ross and her family originally resided at 635 Belmont St., in the North End section of Detroit, near Highland Park, Michigan, where her neighbor was Smokey Robinson. When Ross was seven, her mother contracted tuberculosis, causing her to become seriously ill. Ross&#x27;s parents sent their children to live with Ernestine&#x27;s parents, the Reverend (pastor of Bessemer Baptist Church) and Mrs. William Moton in Bessemer, Alabama. After her mother recovered, she and her siblings returned to Detroit.

On her 14th birthday, in 1958, her family relocated to the working-class Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects, settling at St. Antoine Street. Ross attended Cass Technical High School, a four-year college and preparatory magnet school, in downtown Detroit, and, aspiring to become a fashion designer, she took classes in clothing design, millinery, pattern making, and tailoring. In the evenings and on weekends she also took modeling and cosmetology classes (Ross has written that Robinson loaned her the funds required to attend these), and participated in several of the school&#x27;s extracurricular activities, including its swim team. In 1960, Hudson&#x27;s downtown Detroit store hired Ross as its first African American bus girl. For extra income, she also provided hairdressing services to her neighbors. Ross graduated from Cass Tech in January 1962.

==Career==
===1959–1970: The Supremes===

When she was fifteen, Ross joined the Primettes, the sister group to a male vocal group called the Primes, after she had been brought to the attention of music manager Milton Jenkins by Primes member Paul Williams. Among the other members of the Primettes were Florence Ballard (the first group member hired by Jenkins), Mary Wilson, and Betty McGlown, Williams&#x27; girlfriend. After the Primettes won a talent competition in 1960 in Windsor, Ontario, A&amp;R executive and songwriter, Robert Bateman invited them to audition for Motown Records.

Later, following the success of her live performances at sock hops and similar events, Ross approached William &quot;Smokey&quot; Robinson, her former neighbor about auditioning for Motown; he insisted that the group audition for him first. Robinson then agreed to bring the Primettes to Motown, on condition that they allow him and his group, the Miracles, to hire the Primettes&#x27; guitarist, Marv Tarplin (who had been discovered by Ross) for an upcoming tour. Tarplin ended up playing in Robinson&#x27;s band(s) for the next 30-plus years. In her autobiography, &quot;Secrets of a Sparrow&quot;, Ross wrote that she felt that this had been &quot;a fair trade&quot;.

The Primettes later auditioned for Motown, before various Motown executives. In Berry Gordy&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;To Be Loved&quot;, Gordy recalled that he had been heading to a business meeting when he happened to hear Ross singing &quot;There Goes My Baby&quot;, and that Ross&#x27;s voice &quot;stopped me in my tracks&quot;. He approached the group and asked them to perform it again, but, after learning how young they were, Gordy advised them to finish high school before trying to get signed by Motown.

Undeterred, the group began coming to Motown&#x27;s Hitsville U.S.A. headquarters every day, offering to provide extra help for Motown&#x27;s recordings, often including hand claps and background vocals. That year, the group recorded two tracks for Lu Pine Records, with Ross singing lead on one of them. During the group&#x27;s early years, Ross served as its hairstylist, make-up artist, seamstress, and costume designer. In late 1960, having replaced McGlown with Barbara Martin, the Primettes were allowed to record their own songs at Hitsville studio, many written by &quot;Smokey&quot; Robinson, who, by then, was vice president of Motown (&quot;Your Heart Belongs to Me&quot; and &quot;A Breathtaking Guy&quot;). Gordy, too, composed songs for the trio, including &quot;Buttered Popcorn&quot; (featuring Ballard on lead) and &quot;Let Me Go the Right Way&quot;. While these songs were regional hits, they were not nationwide successes.

In January 1961, Gordy agreed to sign the group on the condition they change their name. Songwriter and Motown secretary Janie Bradford approached Florence Ballard, the only group member at the studio at the time, to pick out a new name for the group. Ballard chose &quot;Supremes&quot;, reportedly, because it was the only name on the list that did not end with &quot;ette&quot;. Upon hearing the new name, the other members weren&#x27;t impressed, with Ross telling Ballard she feared the group would be mistaken for a male vocal group (a male vocal group was, indeed, named the Supremes). Gordy signed the group under their new name on January 15, 1961. A year later, Barbara Martin left the group, reducing the quartet to a trio. In late 1963, the group had their first hit with &quot;When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes&quot;, peaking at No. 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop chart. At the end of the year, Gordy made Ross the group&#x27;s lead singer.
In June 1964, while on tour with Dick Clark&#x27;s Cavalcade of Stars, the group scored their first number-one hit with &quot;Where Did Our Love Go&quot;, paving the way for unprecedented success. Between August 1964 and May 1967, Ross, Wilson, and Ballard sang on ten number-one hit singles, all of which also made the UK Top 40. The group had become a hit with audiences domestically and abroad, going on to be Motown&#x27;s most successful vocal act throughout the sixties.

Ross began to dominate interviews with the media, answering questions aimed at Ballard or Wilson. She pushed for more pay than her colleagues. In 1965, she began using the name Diana from the mistake on her birth certificate, surprising Ballard and Wilson who had only known her as Diane. Following difficulties with comportment, weight, and alcoholism, Florence Ballard was fired from the Supremes by Gordy in July 1967, hiring Cindy Birdsong from Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles as Ballard&#x27;s replacement. Gordy renamed the group &quot;Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes&quot;, making it easier to charge a larger performance fee for a solo star and a backing group, as it did for other renamed Motown groups. Gordy initially considered having Ross leave the Supremes for a solo career in 1966, eventually changing his mind because he felt the group&#x27;s success was still too significant for Ross to pursue solo obligations. Ross remained with the Supremes until early 1970.

The group appeared as a trio of singing nuns in a 1968 episode of the popular NBC TV series &quot;Tarzan&quot;. Between their early 1968 single &quot;Forever Came Today&quot; and their final single with Ross, &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Be Together&quot;, Ross would be the only Supremes member to be featured on many of their recordings, often accompanied by session singers the Andantes or, as in the case of &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Be Together&quot;, Julia and Maxine Waters and Johnny Bristol. Still, Wilson and Birdsong continued to sing on recordings. Gordy drove Ross relentlessly throughout this period and Ross, due to anxiety arising from Gordy&#x27;s demands, began suffering from anorexia nervosa, according to her autobiography, &quot;Secrets of a Sparrow&quot;. During a 1967 performance in Boston, Massachusetts, Ross collapsed onstage and had to be hospitalized for exhaustion.

In 1968, Ross began to perform as a solo artist on television specials, including the Supremes&#x27; own specials such as &quot;TCB&quot; and &quot;G.I.T. on Broadway&quot;, &quot;The Dinah Shore Show&quot;, and a Bob Hope special, among others. In mid-1969, Gordy decided that Ross would depart the group by the end of that year, and Ross began recording her initial solo work that July. One of the first plans for Ross to establish her own solo career was to publicly introduce a new Motown recording act.

Though she did not claim their discovery, Motown&#x27;s publicity department credited Ross with having discovered the Jackson 5. Ross would introduce the group during several public events, including &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;. In November, Ross confirmed a split from the Supremes in &quot;Billboard&quot;. Ross&#x27;s presumed first solo recording, &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Be Together&quot;, was eventually released as a Supremes recording and became the group&#x27;s final number-one hit on the Hot 100. It was also the final number-one &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 single of the 1960s. Ross made her final appearance with the Supremes at the Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 14, 1970.

===1970–1980: Solo career and films===

In May 1970, Ross released her eponymous debut solo album, which included her signature songs, &quot;Reach Out and Touch (Somebody&#x27;s Hand)&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough&quot;, the latter becoming Ross&#x27;s first number-one solo single. Follow-up albums, &quot;Everything Is Everything&quot; (1970) and &quot;Surrender&quot; (1971) came out shortly afterwards. In 1971, the ballad &quot;I&#x27;m Still Waiting&quot; became her first number-one single in the UK. Later in 1971, Ross starred in her first solo television special, &quot;Diana!&quot;, which included the Jackson 5.

In 1971, Diana Ross began working on her first film, &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot; (1972), which was a loosely based biography on singer Billie Holiday. Despite some criticism of her for taking the role, once the film opened in October 1972, Ross won critical acclaim for her performance in the film. Jazz critic Leonard Feather, a friend of Holiday&#x27;s, praised Ross for &quot;expertly capturing the essence of Lady Day&quot;. Ross&#x27;s role in the film won her Golden Globe Award and Academy Award nominations for Best Actress. The soundtrack to &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot; became just as successful, reaching No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, staying there for two weeks, and selling two million units. In November 1972, Ross sung the song &quot;When We Grow Up&quot; for the children&#x27;s album, &quot;Free to Be... You and Me&quot;.

In 1973, Ross had her second number-one hit in the U.S. with the ballad &quot;Touch Me in the Morning&quot;. Later in the year, Motown issued &quot;Diana &amp; Marvin&quot;, a duet album with fellow Motown artist Marvin Gaye. The album became an international hit. Touring throughout 1973, Ross became the first entertainer in Japan&#x27;s history to receive an invitation to the Imperial Palace for a private audience with the Empress Nagako, wife of Emperor Hirohito. In April 1974, Ross became the first African-American woman to co-host the Academy Awards, with John Huston, Burt Reynolds, and David Niven.
After the release of a modestly successful album, &quot;Last Time I Saw Him&quot; (1973), Ross&#x27;s second film, &quot;Mahogany&quot;, was released in 1975. The film reunited her with Billy Dee Williams, her co-star in &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot; and featured costumes designed by Ross herself. The story of an aspiring fashion designer who becomes a runway model and the toast of the industry, &quot;Mahogany&quot; was a troubled production from its inception. The film&#x27;s original director, Tony Richardson, was fired during production, and Berry Gordy assumed the director&#x27;s chair himself.

Gordy and Ross clashed during filming, with Ross leaving the production before shooting was completed, forcing Gordy to use secretary Edna Anderson as a body double for Ross. While a box-office success, the film was not well received by the critics: &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s review of the film chastised Gordy for &quot;squandering one of America&#x27;s most natural resources: Diana Ross&quot;.
Nonetheless, Ross had her third number-one hit in the U.S. with &quot;Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You&#x27;re Going To)&quot;.

A year later, in 1976, Ross released her fourth solo number-one hit, &quot;Love Hangover&quot;, a sensual, dramatic mid-tempo song that bursts into an uptempo disco tune. Later that year, Ross launched her &quot;An Evening with Diana Ross&quot; tour. The tour&#x27;s success led to a two-week stint at Broadway&#x27;s Palace Theatre and a 90-minute, Emmy-nominated television special of the same name, featuring special make-up effects by Stan Winston, for a scene in which Ross portrayed legendary cabaret artist Josephine Baker and blues singers Bessie Smith and Ethel Waters, and a Special Tony Award.

The albums &quot;Baby It&#x27;s Me&quot; (1977) and &quot;Ross&quot; (1978) sold modestly. In 1977, Motown had acquired the film rights to the Broadway play &quot;The Wiz&quot;, an African-American reinterpretation of L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. The film initially was to include the stage actors who had performed on the play, but producer Rob Cohen could not garner the interest of any major Hollywood film studios. It was not until Ross convinced Cohen to cast her (instead of Stephanie Mills, who portrayed Dorothy on Broadway) as Dorothy that Universal Pictures agreed to finance the production.

This casting decision led to a change in the film&#x27;s script, in which Dorothy went from a schoolgirl to a schoolteacher. The role of the Scarecrow, also performed by someone else onstage, was eventually given to Ross&#x27;s former Motown labelmate, Michael Jackson. Ross and Jackson had a modest dance hit with their recording for the film of &quot;Ease on Down the Road&quot;. Their second duet, actually as part of the ensemble of &quot;The Wiz&quot;, &quot;Brand New Day&quot;, found some success overseas.

The film adaptation of &quot;The Wiz&quot; had been a $24 million production, but upon its October 1978 release, it earned only $21,049,053 at the box office. Though pre-release television broadcast rights had been sold to CBS for over $10 million, the film produced a net loss of $10.4 million for Motown and Universal. At the time, it was the most expensive film musical ever made. The film&#x27;s failure ended Ross&#x27;s short career on the big screen and contributed to the Hollywood studios&#x27; reluctance to produce the all-black film projects which had become popular during the blaxploitation era of the early to mid-1970s for several years.

In 1979, Ross released &quot;The Boss&quot;, continuing her popularity with dance audiences, as the title song became a number-one dance single. On July 16, 1979, Ross guest-hosted an episode of Johnny Carson&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, featuring Lynda Carter, George Carlin, and Muhammad Ali as guests. Later that year, Ross hosted the HBO special, &quot;Standing Room Only&quot;, filmed at Caesars Palace&#x27;s Circus Maximus Theater in Las Vegas, Nevada, during her &quot;Tour &#x27;79&quot; concert tour. This concert special is noted for its opening, during which Ross literally makes her entrance through a movie screen. In November of that year, Ross performed &quot;The Boss&quot; album&#x27;s title track as a featured artist during the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, in New York City.

In 1980, Ross released her most successful album to date, &quot;Diana&quot;. Composed by Chic&#x27;s guitarist Nile Rodgers and bassist Bernard Edwards, the album included the hits &quot;I&#x27;m Coming Out&quot; and &quot;Upside Down&quot;, the latter becoming her fifth chart-topping single in the U.S. Ross scored a Top 10 hit in late 1980 with the theme song to the film &quot;It&#x27;s My Turn&quot;. Continuing her connections with Hollywood, Ross recorded the duet ballad &quot;Endless Love&quot;, with Lionel Richie. The song would become her sixth and final single to reach number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

===1981–1987: Leaving Motown and RCA years===
Ross began negotiations to leave Motown at the end of 1980. After over 20 years with the label, Ross received US$250,000 as severance. RCA Records offered Ross a $20 million, seven-year recording contract, which gave her complete production control of her albums. Before signing onto the label, Ross allegedly asked Berry Gordy if he could match RCA&#x27;s offer. Gordy stated that doing so was &quot;impossible&quot;. Ross then signed with RCA on May 20, 1981. At the time, Ross&#x27;s was music history&#x27;s most expensive recording deal.

In October 1981, Ross released her first RCA album, &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;. The album sold over a million copies and featured hit singles such as her remake of the classic hit of the same name and &quot;Mirror Mirror&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Ross established her production company, named Anaid Productions (&quot;Diana&quot; spelled backwards), and also began investing in real estate and touring extensively in the United States and abroad.

Before the release of &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;, Ross hosted her first TV special in four years, &quot;Diana&quot;. Directed by Steve Binder, the concert portions of the special were filmed at Inglewood, California&#x27;s 17,500-seat The Forum indoor stadium and featured performances by Michael Jackson, Muhammad Ali, &quot;Dallas&quot; actor Larry Hagman, music impresario Quincy Jones and members of the Joffrey Ballet. In early 1982, Ross sang &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at Super Bowl XVI and appeared on the musical variety show &quot;Soul Train&quot;. The episode, devoted completely to her, featured Ross performing several songs from &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;.

On May 6, 1982, Ross was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She followed up the success of &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; with &quot;Silk Electric&quot;, which featured the Michael Jackson-written and -produced &quot;Muscles&quot;, resulting in another Top 10 Grammy nominated success for Ross. The album eventually went gold on the strength of that song. In 1983, Ross ventured further out of her earlier soul-based sound for a more pop rock-oriented sound following the release of the &quot;Ross&quot; album. Though the album featured the Top 40 hit single, &quot;Pieces of Ice&quot;, the &quot;Ross&quot; album did not generate any more hits or achieve gold status.
On July 21, 1983, Ross performed a free concert on Central Park&#x27;s Great Lawn, aired live worldwide by Showtime. Proceeds of the concert would be donated to build a playground in the singer&#x27;s name. Midway through the beginning of the show, a torrential downpour began. Ross tried to continue performing, but the severe weather forced the show to be stopped after 45 minutes. Ross urged the large crowd to exit the venue safely, promising to perform the next day.

The next day&#x27;s concert suffered no rain, but the memorabilia that was supposed to be sold to raise money for the playground had already been destroyed by the storm. When journalists discovered the exorbitant costs of the two concerts, Ross faced criticism from Mayor Ed Koch and the Parks Department commissioner. During a subsequent mayoral press conference, Ross handed Koch a check for US$250,000 for the project. The Diana Ross Playground was built three years later.

In 1984, Ross released &quot;Swept Away&quot;. The album featured &quot;All of You&quot;, a duet with friend Julio Iglesias. The single was featured on both Ross&#x27;s album and Iglesias&#x27;s &quot;1100 Bel Air Place&quot;, his first English-language album. It became an international hit, as did the Lionel Richie-penned ballad &quot;Missing You&quot;, composed as a tribute to Marvin Gaye, who had been killed earlier that year. &quot;Swept Away&quot; garnered gold record sales status.

Her 1985 album &quot;Eaten Alive&quot;, produced by Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees, garnered a number one single overseas and a Top 20 spot on the album charts. The song &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; reached number one in the U.K., Australia, South Africa, Israel and Ireland, and the title track, a collaboration with Michael Jackson and Gibb, also performed well. Both songs had strong music videos that propelled the tracks to success. The &quot;Eaten Alive&quot; video was patterned after the 1970s horror film &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot;, while the one for &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; saluted the 1960s &quot;American Bandstand&quot;-style TV shows. The video for &quot;Experience&quot;, the third single from the album, reignited the &quot;Eaten Alive&quot; romantic storyline with Ross and actor Joseph Gian.

Earlier in 1985, Ross appeared as part of USA for Africa&#x27;s &quot;We Are the World&quot; charity single, which sold over 20 million copies worldwide. Ross&#x27;s 1987 follow-up to &quot;Eaten Alive&quot;, &quot;Red Hot Rhythm &amp; Blues&quot; found less success; it reached No. 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B Albums chart and No. 12 in Sweden. However, the album&#x27;s accompanying television special was nominated for three Emmy Awards and won two: Outstanding Costume Design for a Variety or Music Program (Ray Aghayan and Ret Turner) and Outstanding Lighting Direction (Electronic) for a Miniseries or a Special (Greg Brunton). On January 27, 1986, Ross hosted the 13th annual &quot;American Music Awards&quot;. Ross returned the next year to host the 14th annual telecast.

===1988–1999: Return to Motown===
In 1988, Ross chose to not renew her RCA contract and had been in talks with her former mentor Berry Gordy to return to Motown. When she learned of Gordy&#x27;s plans to sell Motown, Ross tried advising him against the decision, though he ended up selling it to MCA Records in June of that year. Following the sale of the company, Ross was asked to return to the Motown label with the condition that she have shares in the company as a part-owner; Ross accepted the offer.

That same year, Ross was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Supremes alongside her former singing partners Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard. She also recorded the theme song to animated adventure drama film &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; (1988). &quot;If We Hold on Together&quot; became an international hit, reaching number one in Japan.

Ross&#x27;s next album, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Workin&#x27; Overtime&quot;, was not a commercial success, despite the title track reaching the top three of the &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The album peaked at No. 34 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B Albums chart, and achieved top 25 chart placings in Japan and the UK. Subsequent releases, &quot;The Force Behind the Power&quot; (1991), &quot;Take Me Higher&quot; (1995), and &quot;Every Day Is a New Day&quot; (1999) all failed to achieve major success in America, selling around 100,000 copies each.

In 1991, Ross became one of the few American artists to have headlined the annual Royal Variety Performance, performing a selection of her UK hits before Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh at the Victoria Palace Theatre, London. This marked her second appearance at the Royal Variety Performance, the first being in 1968 with the Supremes.

&quot;The Force Behind the Power&quot; sparked a comeback when the album went platinum in the UK. led by the No. 2 UK hit single &quot;When You Tell Me That You Love Me&quot;. The album produced 9 singles across international territories, including another Top 10 UK hit &quot;One Shining Moment&quot;. In 1993, Ross returned to acting with a dramatic role in the television film, &quot;Out of Darkness&quot;. Ross won acclaim for her role in the TV movie and earned her third Golden Globe nomination.

In 1994, &quot;One Woman: The Ultimate Collection&quot;, a career retrospective compilation, became a number one hit in the UK, selling quadruple platinum. The retrospective was EMI&#x27;s alternative to Motown&#x27;s box set &quot;Forever Diana: Musical Memoirs&quot;. Ross performed during the opening ceremony of the 1994 FIFA World Cup held in Chicago, and during the pre-match entertainment of the 1995 Rugby League World Cup final at Wembley Stadium. The World Cup ceremony had her take a penalty kick that was staged for her to score, and the goalposts were intended to fall down from the power of her shot. She infamously missed the penalty instead.

On January 28, 1996, Ross performed at the Super Bowl XXX halftime show, held at the Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona. Earlier that month, Ross&#x27;s Tokyo concert, &quot;Diana Ross: Live in Japan&quot;, filmed live at the city&#x27;s Nippon Budokan Stadium, was released. In May 1996, Ross received the World Music Awards&#x27; Lifelong Contribution to the Music Industry Award. On November 29, EMI released the compilation album, &quot;Voice of Love&quot;, featuring the singles &quot;In the Ones You Love&quot;, &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; and &quot;I Hear (The Voice of Love)&quot;. On February 8, 1997, EMI released the Japanese edition of Ross&#x27;s album, &quot;A Gift of Love&quot;, featuring the single, &quot;Promise Me You&#x27;ll Try&quot;. In May, she performed with operatic tenors Plácido Domingo and José Carreras again at the Superconcert of the Century concert, held in Taipei, Taiwan. She later inducted the Jackson 5 into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on May 6.

On February 19, 1998, Ross hosted the Motown 40 telecast on ABC. In 1999, Ross was named the most successful female singer in the history of the United Kingdom charts, based upon a tally of her career hits. Madonna would soon succeed Ross as the most successful female artist in the UK. Later that year, Ross presented at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards in September of the year and shocked the audience by touching rapper Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s exposed breast and pasty-covered nipple, amazed at the young rapper&#x27;s brashness. In 1999, she and Brandy Norwood co-starred in the television movie, &quot;Double Platinum&quot;, which was aired prior to the release of Ross&#x27;s album, &quot;Every Day Is a New Day&quot;. From that album, Ross scored a Top 10 hit in the UK in November that year with &quot;Not Over You Yet&quot;.

===2000–2003: Supremes reunion===
Ross reunited with Mary Wilson first in 1976 to attend the funeral service of Florence Ballard, who had died in February of that year. In March 1983, Ross agreed to reunite with Wilson and Cindy Birdsong for the television special &quot;Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever&quot;. The Supremes did not rehearse their performance for that evening, due to time constraints. A scheduled medley of hits was cancelled.

Instead of following producer Suzanne de Passe&#x27;s instructions to recreate their choreography from their final Ed Sullivan Show appearance, Wilson (according to her autobiography) planned with Birdsong to take a step forward every time Ross did the same, then began to sing lead on the group&#x27;s final number-one hit song, &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Be Together&quot;, on which Wilson did not perform.

Later, Wilson introduced Berry Gordy from the stage (unaware that the program&#x27;s script called for Ross to introduce Gordy), at which point Ross subtly pushed down Wilson&#x27;s hand-held microphone, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s been taken care of.&quot; Ross then re-introduced Gordy. These moments were excised from the final edit of the taped special, but still made their way into the news media; &quot;People&quot; magazine reported that &quot;Ross [did] some elbowing to get Wilson out of the spotlight.&quot;

In 1999, Ross and mega-tour promoter SFX Entertainment (which later became Live Nation) began negotiations regarding a Diana Ross tour which would include a Supremes segment. During negotiations with Ross, the promoters considered the creation of a Supremes tour, instead. Ross agreed. As the tour&#x27;s co-producer, Ross invited all living former Supremes to participate. Neither Jean Terrell nor late 1970s member Susaye Greene chose to participate. 70s Supremes Lynda Laurence and Scherrie Payne were then touring as Former Ladies of the Supremes.

Ross contacted Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong, who then began negotiations with SFX. Negotiations with Wilson and Birdsong (who allowed Wilson to negotiate on her behalf) failed when Wilson refused SFX&#x27;s and Ross&#x27;s offer of $4 million for 30 performances. Following the passage of SFX&#x27;s final deadline for Wilson to accept their offer, Payne and Laurence, already negotiating with SFX, signed on to perform with Ross on the tour.

Laurence and Payne would later say that they got along well with Ross. The newly formed group performed together on &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, as well as VH1&#x27;s &quot;VH1 Divas 2000: A Tribute to Diana Ross&quot;. The Return to Love Tour launched in June 2000, to a capacity audience in Philadelphia. The tour&#x27;s final performance was at New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. The tour was cancelled by SFX shortly thereafter, due to mediocre ticket sales, despite glowing reviews from media as varied as &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;The Village Voice&quot; newspapers.

On December 5, 2000, Ross received a Heroes Award from the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences (NARAS). The Heroes Award is the highest distinction bestowed by the New York Chapter. Ross&#x27;s first public post-RTL appearance was at a fundraiser for former president Bill Clinton. In January 2001, &quot;Love &amp; Life: The Very Best of Diana Ross&quot; was released in the United Kingdom, becoming Ross&#x27;s 17th gold album in that country. In June, Ross presented costume designer Bob Mackie with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the American Fashion Awards.

Two days before the September 11 attacks, Ross performed &quot;God Bless America&quot; at the US Open before the tournament&#x27;s women&#x27;s final, between Venus and Serena Williams. Immediately following the attacks, Ross performed the song again at Shea Stadium, before the New York Mets first game, after driving cross-country to be with her children (in the wake of the attacks, flying in the U.S. was temporarily restricted.). Ross teamed with legendary singers Patti LaBelle and Eartha Kitt, among others, for a Nile Rodgers-produced recording of Sister Sledge&#x27;s classic disco hit, &quot;We Are Family&quot;, recorded to benefit the families of 9/11 victims.

In May 2002, Ross and all five of her children appeared on Barbara Walters&#x27; Mother&#x27;s Day television special. Shortly thereafter, Ross admitted herself into the 30-day substance abuse program at the Promises Institute in Malibu, California, after friends and family began to notice a burgeoning alcohol problem. Ross left the program three weeks later and began to fulfill previously scheduled concert dates, beginning with a performance before a 60,000-strong crowd at London&#x27;s Hyde Park, for Prince Charles&#x27; Prince&#x27;s Trust charity.

U.S. ticket sales for the new tour were brisk, from coast to coast. Venues, such as Long Island&#x27;s Westbury Music Fair, California&#x27;s Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts and Humphrey&#x27;s Concerts by the Bay, attempted to add extra shows, due to public demand. Sold-out performances in Boston and Ontario, Canada, followed. In August, shortly after the tour began, however, Ross re-entered the Promises Institute&#x27;s substance abuse rehabilitation program. That December, during her stay at Arizona&#x27;s Canyon Ranch Health Resort, Ross was pulled over by Tucson police for driving the wrong way on a one-way street. She failed a breathalizer test and was arrested for a DUI. Ross was later sentenced to 48 hours in jail, which she served near her home in Greenwich, Connecticut.

In January 2003, Ross was honored as Humanitarian of the Year by Nile Rodgers&#x27; We Are Family Foundation. Shortly thereafter, Ross was feted as an honored guest at the National Association of Black-Owned Broadcasters Awards. Later that year, Ross was the guest performer at that year&#x27;s Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s Costume Institute&#x27;s annual gala, in an ensemble custom-designed by fashion designer Tom Ford, followed by an appearance as the surprise celebrity model for American couturier Dennis Basso&#x27;s runway show. In February 2003, the Supremes were honored by the Rhythm and Blues Foundation with its Pioneer Award.

===2004–2019: Later career===
In May 2004, Ross and daughter Tracee Ellis Ross appeared on the cover of &quot;Essence&quot; magazine, in celebration of its 50th anniversary. On December 8, 2004, Ross was the featured performer for Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards&#x27; Century Award tribute.

On January 14, 2005, Ross performed at the &quot;Tsunami Aid: A Concert of Hope&quot; TV concert to help raise money for the tsunami victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. On January 20, 2005, Ross launched her M.A.C. Icon makeup collection, as part of the beauty corporation&#x27;s Icon Series. In 2005, Ross participated in Rod Stewart&#x27;s &quot;Thanks for the Memory: The Great American Songbook, Volume IV&quot; recording a duet version of the Gershwin standard, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Crush on You&quot;. The song was released as promotion for the album and later reached No. 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Adult Contemporary chart, marking her first &quot;Billboard&quot; chart entry since 2000. Ross was featured in another hit duet, this time with Westlife, on a cover of Ross&#x27;s 1991 hit &quot;When You Tell Me That You Love Me&quot;, repeating the original recording&#x27;s chart success, garnering a No. 2 UK Singles Chart hit (No. 1 in Ireland).

Also in 2005, Ross was featured as an honored guest at Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s Legends Ball Weekend, a three-day celebration honoring 25 African-American women in art, entertainment and civil rights. On May 22, 2006, a year after the celebration, a one-hour program about the weekend aired on ABC, including celebrity interviews and behind-the-scenes moments. On March 22, 2006, Ross&#x27;s televised Central Park concerts, entitled &quot;For One &amp; for All&quot;, were named TV Land Awards&#x27; Viewer&#x27;s Choice for Television&#x27;s Greatest Music Moment.

In June 2006, Universal released Ross&#x27;s shelved 1972 &quot;Blue&quot; album. It peaked at No. 2 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Jazz Albums chart. Later in 2006, Ross released her first studio album in seven years with &quot;I Love You&quot;. It would be released on EMI/Manhattan Records in the United States in January 2007. &quot;I Love You&quot; peaked at No. 32 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 200 albums chart and No. 16 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top R&amp;B Albums chart. Ross later ventured on a world tour to promote &quot;I Love You&quot;. In 2007, Ross was honored with the BET Awards&#x27; Lifetime Achievement Award and, later, as one of the honorees at the Kennedy Center Honors.
On August 28, 2008, Ross performed at the opening of the US Open tennis tournament, as part of a tribute to Billie Jean King. Ross headlined the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway. In October 2009, Ross was the featured performer at the annual &quot;Symphonica in Rosso&quot; concert series, held at the GelreDome Stadium in Arnhem, Netherlands. In 2010, Ross embarked on her first headlining tour in three years titled the &quot;More Today Than Yesterday: The Greatest Hits Tour&quot;. Dedicated to the memory of her late friend Michael Jackson, the concert tour garnered positive reviews, nationwide. In 2011, Ross was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.

In February 2012, Ross received her first Grammy Award, for Lifetime Achievement, and announced the nominees for the Album of the Year. In May, a DVD of her Central Park concert performances, &quot;For One &amp; For All&quot;, was released and featured commentary from Steve Binder, who directed the special. A month later, on December 9, she performed as the marquee and headlining performer at the White House-hosted &quot;Christmas in Washington&quot; concert, where she performed before former President Barack Obama. The event was later broadcast as an annual special on TNT.

In 2013, Ross completed a tour in South America and a tour in the United States. On July 3, 2014, Ross was awarded the Ella Fitzgerald Award for &quot;her extraordinary contribution to contemporary jazz vocals&quot;, at the Montreal International Jazz Festival. On November 20, 2014, Ross presented the Dick Clark Award for Excellence to Taylor Swift at the American Music Awards.

In 2015, Ross appeared in the video for the song &quot;How to Live Alone&quot; performed by her son Evan Ross. On April 1, 2015, Ross began the first of nine performances as a part of her mini-residency, &quot;The Essential Diana Ross: Some Memories Never Fade&quot; at The Venetian in Las Vegas, Nevada. On November 27, 2015, Motown/Universal released the album &quot;Diana Ross Sings Songs from The Wiz&quot;, recorded in 1978. The album features Ross&#x27;s versions of songs from the film version of the musical &quot;The Wiz&quot;, in which she starred along with Michael Jackson, Nipsey Russell, Ted Ross, Richard Pryor and Lena Horne. In February 2016, Ross resumed her In the Name of Love Tour, which began in 2013. On November 22, 2016, Ross was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama. In December 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine named her the 50th most successful dance club artist of all time.

On June 30, 2017, Ross headlined the Essence Festival in New Orleans, Louisiana, with her daughter Rhonda Ross-Kendrick performing as the opening act. On November 19, 2017, Ross received the American Music Awards Lifetime Achievement Award. Ross performed several of her hits, ending with &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough&quot;, during which she brought all of her grandchildren onstage. Her eldest grandson, eight-year-old Raif-Henok Emmanuel Kendrick, son of Rhonda Ross-Kendrick and husband, Rodney, performed an impromptu dance behind Ross, which gained attention. Ross was then joined onstage by all of her children, their spouses, first ex-husband Robert Ellis, Smokey Robinson (who brought Ross to Motown) and Motown founder, Berry Gordy.

In December 2017, Ross appeared on the Home Shopping Network to promote her first fragrance, Diamond Diana. The fragrance sold out within hours. Ross made several hour-long appearances on the network, and also released a tie-in CD retrospective collection of her music titled &quot;Diamond Diana&quot;. &quot;Diamond Diana&quot; peaked at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B Albums chart and No. 5 on its Top Album Sales chart. The CD&#x27;s first single release, &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough 2017&quot;, remixed by Eric Kupper, reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart.

On October 10, 2019, it was announced that Ross would play the Sunday legends slot on the Pyramid Stage at the Glastonbury Festival for the festival&#x27;s 50th anniversary; however, the festival was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Then on November 10, 2021, Ross confirmed that she would play the legends slot at the 2022 festival.

===2020–present: &quot;Thank You&quot; and Glastonbury===
In May 2020, Ross released &quot;&quot;, a collection of nine of her greatest hits remixed by Eric Kupper and featuring her four back-to-back No.1 hits on &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart: &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough 2017&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Coming Out/Upside Down 2018&quot;, &quot;The Boss 2019&quot;, and &quot;Love Hangover 2020&quot;. In July 2020, &quot;Supertonic: Mixes&quot; was also released on CD and crystal-clear vinyl LP. Ross released her twenty-fifth studio album &quot;Thank You&quot; in November 2021. It was written and recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and contains her first original material since 1999&#x27;s &quot;Every Day Is a New Day&quot;.
In May 2022, she released the single &quot;Turn Up the Sunshine&quot;, a collaboration with psychedelic pop band Tame Impala. The track is the lead single from the Jack Antonoff-produced of the film &quot;&quot;. With the exception of this track, the album primarily features new spins on classic 1970s hits by artists such as Brittany Howard, St. Vincent, H.E.R., and many others.

On June 4, 2022, Ross appeared as the finale act at the Platinum Party at the Palace in celebration of the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II. On June 10, Ross kicked off the UK leg of her &quot;Thank You Tour&quot; at Cardiff Castle. On June 26, Ross appeared live on the Pyramid Stage at the Glastonbury Festival.

On November 15, 2022, Ross received a 2023 Grammy Award nomination in the Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album category for &quot;Thank You&quot;. On June 9, 2023, Ross kicked off the US leg of &quot;The Music Legacy Tour&quot; which celebrated her greatest #1 hits. Later in 2023, Ross performed at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall on October 14 and 15, and again in April 2024. Ross was among the musicians to participate in an Eminem-produced concert celebrating the grand reopening of the Michigan Central Station on June 6. The event was streamed live on Peacock. Additionally, a one-hour primetime re-broadcast was shown on NBC on June 9 at 7:00 p.m.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and family===
Ross has been married twice and has five children. Ross became romantically involved with Motown CEO Berry Gordy in 1965. The relationship lasted several years, resulting in the birth of Ross&#x27;s eldest child, Rhonda Suzanne Silberstein, in August 1971. Two months into her pregnancy with Rhonda, in January 1971, Ross married music executive Robert Ellis Silberstein, who raised Rhonda as his own daughter, despite knowing her true paternity. Ross told Rhonda that Gordy was her biological father when Rhonda was 13 years old. Beforehand, Rhonda referred to Gordy as &quot;Uncle B.B.&quot;

Ross has two daughters with Silberstein, Tracee Joy Silberstein (Tracee Ellis Ross) and Chudney Lane Silberstein, born in 1972 and 1975, respectively. Ross and Silberstein divorced in 1977. In 2023, Smokey Robinson said in an interview that he and Ross had an affair lasting approximately one year while Robinson was married to his first wife, Claudette. According to Robinson, Ross ended the affair as Robinson admitted to still being in love with Claudette, a friend of Ross&#x27;s. When asked about Robinson&#x27;s story, Ross&#x27;s representative had no comment.

Ross dated Gene Simmons, bassist and co-lead singer for the band Kiss, from 1980 to 1983.

Ross met her second husband, Norwegian shipping magnate Arne Næss Jr., in 1985, and married him the following year. She became stepmother to his three elder children; Katinka, Christoffer, and folk singer Leona Naess. They have two sons together: Ross Arne (born in 1987) and Evan Olav (born in 1988). Ross and Næss divorced in 2000, after press reports revealed that Næss had fathered a child with another woman in Norway. Ross considers Næss the love of her life. Næss fell to his death in a South African mountain climbing accident in 2004. Ross remains close with her three ex-stepchildren.

Ross has seven grandchildren.

===Religious views===
Ross was raised in the Baptist church. According to her 1993 autobiography, &quot;Secrets of a Sparrow&quot;, her initial performances were in the Bessemer Baptist Church of Bessemer, Alabama, led by her maternal grandfather, Pastor William Moten, who (with his wife) raised her and her siblings there during their mother&#x27;s bouts with tuberculosis.

===2002 arrest===
Ross was arrested for DUI on December 30, 2002, in Tucson, Arizona, while undergoing substance abuse treatment at a local rehabilitation facility. She later served a two-day sentence near her Connecticut estate.

==Legacy==

Ross has influenced many artists including Michael Jackson, Beyoncé, Madonna, Jade Thirlwall, Questlove, Ledisi and the Ting Tings. Several of Ross&#x27;s songs have also been covered and sampled. &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough&quot; has been featured in the film &quot;Chicken Little&quot;. The song has also been covered live and on albums by Jennifer Lopez and Amy Winehouse. Janet Jackson sampled &quot;Love Hangover&quot; on her 1997 song &quot;My Need&quot; (featured on the album &quot;The Velvet Rope&quot;), having already sampled &quot;Love Child&quot; and &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Be Together&quot; by Ross &amp; the Supremes on her 1993 tracks &quot;You Want This&quot; and &quot;If&quot; (both released as singles from the &quot;Janet&quot; album). &quot;Love Hangover&quot; was also sampled in Monica&#x27;s 1998 hit single &quot;The First Night&quot; as well as being sampled by Will Smith, Master P (who also sampled &quot;Missing You&quot;), Heavy D and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, &quot;It&#x27;s Your Move&quot; was sampled in 2011 by Vektroid for her song &quot;Lisa Frank 420 / Modern Computing&quot;, which appeared in her ninth album &quot;Floral Shoppe&quot; under her one-time alias Macintosh Plus. &quot;It&#x27;s My House&quot; was sampled by Lady Gaga for her song &quot;Replay&quot; which appeared on the 2020 album &quot;Chromatica&quot;.

Various works have been inspired by Ross&#x27;s career and life. The character of Deena Jones in both the play and film versions of &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; was inspired by Ross. &quot;&quot; is a Broadway musical that launched on April 14, 2013. It is the story of Berry Gordy&#x27;s creation of Motown Records and his romance with Diana Ross. She was portrayed by Valisia LeKae in 2013 and Lucy St. Louis in 2016. Ross was also portrayed by Candice Marie Woods (from 2017 to 2019) and Deri&#x27;Andra Tucker (2021) in the stage play &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud&quot;. There have been many other portrayals of Ross in films, television and other media including Holly Robinson Peete in &quot;The Jacksons: An American Dream&quot; (1992) and Michelle Williams of Destiny&#x27;s Child on &quot;American Soul&quot; (2019).

As a member of the Supremes, her songs &quot;Stop! In the Name of Love&quot; and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot; are among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1994, and entered into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the group at number 96 on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;.

As lead singer of the Supremes and as a solo artist, Ross has earned 18 number-one singles (12 as lead singer of the Supremes and 6 as a solo artist). Ross is the only female artist to have number one singles as a solo artist; as the other half of a duet (Lionel Richie); as a member of a trio (the Supremes); and, as an ensemble member (&quot;We Are the World&quot; by USA for Africa). Ross was featured on the Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s 1997 number-one hit &quot;Mo Money Mo Problems&quot; since her voice from her 1980 hit &quot;I&#x27;m Coming Out&quot; was sampled for the song.

&quot;Billboard&quot; magazine named Ross the &quot;female entertainer of the century&quot; in 1976. Ross is also one of the few recording artists to have two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame—one as a solo artist and the other as a member of the Supremes. After her 1983 concert in Central Park, Diana Ross Playground was named in her honor with a groundbreaking opening ceremony in 1986.

Berry Gordy asked Ross to introduce The Jackson Five to the public. Eventually, public misunderstandings resulted in Ross erroneously being given credit for the discovery of the Jackson 5. Gordy decided that the misunderstanding was &quot;good for business&quot;, so her &quot;discovery&quot; became a part of Motown&#x27;s marketing and promotions plan for the Jackson 5. Consequently, their debut album was titled &quot;Diana Ross Presents The Jackson 5&quot;. Motown producer Bobby Taylor claims to have discovered the Jacksons, though, singer Gladys Knight also makes the claim. Even so, Ross embraced the role and became a good friend of Michael Jackson, serving as a mother figure to him.

On January 24, 1985, Kaufman Astoria Studios held a dedication ceremony in Astoria, Queens to honor Ross by naming Studio 4 at the studios after her. The &quot;Diana Ross Building&quot; served as an acknowledgement of Ross&#x27;s contribution in bringing the studio back to the forefront after being faced with possible demolition, through her involvement in &quot;The Wiz&quot;. In 2006, Ross was one of 25 African-American women saluted at Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s Legends Ball, a three-day celebration, honoring their contributions to art, entertainment, and civil rights. Ross has been described as one of the Five Mighty Pop Divas of the Sixties along with Dusty Springfield, Aretha Franklin, Martha Reeves, and Dionne Warwick. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Ross at number 87 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

==Awards and nominations==
On November 16, 2016, Ross was announced as one of the 21 recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation&#x27;s highest civilian honor. In 2023, Supremes co-founders Ross and the late Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard received the Grammys&#x27; Lifetime Achievement Award, with Ross becoming the first woman to win the award twice (she earned a solo honor in 2012).

<doc id="154698" wikidata="Q40096" url="?curid=154698" title="Will Smith">
<text>Willard Carroll Smith II (born September 25, 1968) is an American actor, rapper, and film producer. He has received multiple accolades, including an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a BAFTA Award, and four Grammy Awards. As of 2025, his films have grossed over $9.5 billion globally, making him one of Hollywood&#x27;s most bankable stars.

Smith first gained recognition as part of a hip hop duo with DJ Jazzy Jeff, with whom he released five studio albums which contained five &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-top 20 singles—&quot;Parents Just Don&#x27;t Understand&quot;, &quot;A Nightmare on My Street&quot;, &quot;Summertime&quot;, &quot;Ring My Bell&quot;, and &quot;Boom! Shake the Room&quot;—from 1985 to 1994. He released the solo albums &quot;Big Willie Style&quot; (1997), &quot;Willennium&quot; (1999), &quot;Born to Reign&quot; (2002), and &quot;Lost and Found&quot; (2005), which spawned the U.S. number-one singles &quot;Gettin&#x27; Jiggy wit It&quot; and &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; (featuring Dru Hill and Kool Moe Dee). He has won four Grammy Awards for his recording career.

Smith began his acting career starring as a fictionalized version of himself on the NBC sitcom &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; (1990–1996), for which he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy in 1993 and 1994. He then achieved wider fame as a leading man for the action film &quot;Bad Boys&quot; (1995) and the science fiction comedy &quot;Men in Black&quot; (1997), later reprising both roles in several sequels. After starring in the thrillers &quot;Independence Day&quot; (1996) and &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; (1998), he received Academy Award for Best Actor nominations for his portrayals of Muhammad Ali in &quot;Ali&quot; (2001) and Chris Gardner in &quot;The Pursuit of Happyness&quot; (2006). He also starred in commercially successful films such as &quot;I, Robot&quot; (2004), &quot;Shark Tale&quot; (2004), &quot;Hitch&quot; (2005), &quot;I Am Legend&quot; (2007), &quot;Hancock&quot; (2008), &quot;Seven Pounds&quot; (2008), &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (2016), &quot;Aladdin&quot; (2019), and &quot;Spies in Disguise&quot; (2019).

For his portrayal of Richard Williams in the biographical sports drama &quot;King Richard&quot; (2021), Smith won the Academy Award for Best Actor. At the 2022 ceremony, shortly before winning, Smith slapped and shouted at presenter Chris Rock after Rock made an unscripted derogatory joke referencing Smith&#x27;s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. The controversial event earned substantial media coverage and criticism, with Smith ultimately resigning from the Academy along with being banned from attending all their events for ten years.

==Early life==
Willard Carroll Smith II was born on September 25, 1968, in Philadelphia, to Caroline (née Bright), a school board administrator, and Willard Carroll Smith Sr., a U.S. Air Force veteran and refrigeration engineer. His mother graduated from Carnegie Mellon University.

He grew up in West Philadelphia&#x27;s Wynnefield neighborhood and was raised Baptist. He has an elder sister named Pamela and two younger siblings, twins Harry and Ellen. He attended Our Lady of Lourdes, a private Catholic elementary school in Philadelphia, and Overbrook High School. His parents separated when he was 13 and divorced around the year 2000.

Smith began rapping at age 12. When his grandmother found a notebook of his lyrics, which he described as containing &quot;all [his] little curse words&quot;, she wrote him a note on a page in the book: &quot;Dear Willard, truly intelligent people do not have to use words like this to express themselves. Please show the world that you&#x27;re as smart as we think you are&quot;. Smith said that this influenced his decision not to use profanity in his music.

==Career==
===1985–1992: DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince===
Smith started as the MC of the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince, with his childhood friend Jeffrey &quot;DJ Jazzy Jeff&quot; Townes as turntablist and producer. Townes and Smith were introduced to each other by chance in 1985, as Townes was performing at a house party only a few doors down from Smith&#x27;s residence, and he was missing his hype man. Smith decided to fill in. They both felt strong chemistry, and Townes was upset when his hype man finally made it to the party.

Soon after, the two decided to collaborate. Smith enlisted a friend to join as the beatboxer of the group, Clarence Holmes aka Ready Rock C, making them a trio. Philadelphia-based Word Records released their first single in 1986 when A&amp;R man Paul Oakenfold introduced them to Champion Records with their single &quot;Girls Ain&#x27;t Nothing but Trouble&quot;, a tale of funny misadventures that landed Smith and his former DJ and rap partner Mark Forrest (Lord Supreme) in trouble. The song sampled the theme song of &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;. Smith became known for light-hearted story-telling raps and capable, though profanity-free, &quot;battle&quot; rhymes. The single became a hit a month before Smith graduated from high school.

Based on this success, the duo were brought to the attention of Jive Records and Russell Simmons. The duo&#x27;s first album, &quot;Rock the House&quot;, which was first released on Word Up in 1986 debuted on Jive in March 1987. The group received the first Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance in 1989 for &quot;Parents Just Don&#x27;t Understand&quot; (1988), though their most successful single was &quot;Summertime&quot; (1991), which earned the group their second Grammy and peaked at number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Smith and Townes are still friends and claim that they never split up, having made songs under Smith&#x27;s solo performer credit.

Smith spent money freely around 1988 and 1989 and underpaid his income taxes. The Internal Revenue Service eventually assessed a $2.8 million tax debt against Smith, took many of his possessions, and garnished his income. Smith was struggling financially in 1990 when the NBC television network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom, &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, around him. The show was successful and began his acting career. Smith set for himself the goal of becoming &quot;the biggest movie star in the world&quot;, studying box office successes&#x27; common characteristics. In 1989, Smith was arrested in relation to an alleged assault on his record promoter, William Hendricks; the charges were later dismissed.

===1993–1997: Solo music and film breakthrough===
Smith&#x27;s first major roles were in the drama &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot; (1993) and the action film &quot;Bad Boys&quot; (1995) in which he starred opposite Martin Lawrence. The latter film was commercially successful, grossing $141.4 million worldwide. However, critical reception was generally mixed. In 1996, Smith starred as part of an ensemble cast in Roland Emmerich&#x27;s &quot;Independence Day&quot;. The film was a massive blockbuster, becoming the second highest-grossing film in history at the time and establishing Smith as a prime box office draw.

In the summer of 1997, he starred alongside Tommy Lee Jones in the hit &quot;Men in Black&quot;, playing Agent J. The film was released on July 2 by Columbia Pictures and grossed over $589.3 million worldwide against a $90 million budget, becoming the year&#x27;s third highest-grossing film, with an estimated 54,616,700 tickets sold in the U.S. It received positive reviews, with critics praising its humor, and Jones&#x27;s and Smith&#x27;s performances.

During the summer of 1997, Smith also began his solo music career with the release of &quot;Men in Black&quot;, the theme song for the film, which topped singles charts in several regions across the world, including the UK. &quot;Men in Black&quot; (and second single &quot;Just Cruisin&#x27;&quot;) was later included on Smith&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Big Willie Style&quot;, which reached the top ten of the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified nine times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The third single from the album, &quot;Gettin&#x27; Jiggy wit It&quot;, became Smith&#x27;s first &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number one when it was released in 1998.

===1998–2007: Leading man status===
In 1998, Smith starred with Gene Hackman in &quot;Enemy of the State&quot;. The following year, he turned down the role of Neo in &quot;The Matrix&quot; in favor of &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; (1999). Despite the disappointment of &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;, Smith said that he has no regrets about his decision, asserting that Keanu Reeves&#x27;s performance as Neo was superior to what Smith himself would have achieved, although in interviews subsequent to the release of &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;, he said that he &quot;made a mistake on &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;. That could have been better&quot;.

Smith&#x27;s second album was again supported by the release of a film theme song as the lead single: &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;, featuring Dru Hill and Kool Moe Dee, topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was certified gold by the RIAA. The album, &quot;Willennium&quot;, reached number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified double platinum by the RIAA. &quot;Will 2K&quot;, the second single from the album, reached number 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Before the end of 1999, a video album was released featuring Smith&#x27;s seven music videos released to date, which reached number 25 on the UK Music Video Chart. The same year, he was also featured on &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; co-star Tatyana Ali&#x27;s single &quot;Boy You Knock Me Out&quot;, which reached number three on the UK Singles Chart and topped the UK R&amp;B Singles Chart.

Smith portrayed heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali in the 2001 biopic &quot;Ali&quot;. For his performance he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. In 2002, following a four-year musical hiatus, Smith returned with his third album &quot;Born to Reign&quot;, which reached number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified gold by the RIAA. The album&#x27;s lead single was the theme song from Smith&#x27;s film &quot;Men in Black II&quot;, called &quot;Black Suits Comin&#x27; (Nod Ya Head)&quot;, which reached number three on the UK Singles Chart. Later in the year, Smith&#x27;s first compilation album &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was released, featuring songs from his three solo albums and those produced with DJ Jazzy Jeff.

2003 saw Smith return for &quot;Bad Boys II&quot;, the sequel to the 1995 film &quot;Bad Boys&quot;; the film follows detectives Burnett and Lowrey investigating the flow of ecstasy into Miami. Despite receiving generally negative reviews, the film was a box-office success, grossing $270 million worldwide. In the following year, he starred in the science fiction film &quot;I, Robot&quot; and the animated film &quot;Shark Tale&quot;; both films were box office successes despite mixed reviews. Smith&#x27;s latest album &quot;Lost and Found&quot; was released in 2005, peaking at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Lead single &quot;Switch&quot; reached the top ten of both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. In 2005, Smith was entered into the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; for attending three premieres in a 24-hour time span. Smith and his son Jaden played father and son in the 2006 biographical drama &quot;The Pursuit of Happyness&quot;. In the film, Smith portrays Chris Gardner. Smith first became interested in making a film about Gardner after seeing him on &quot;20/20&quot; and connected with him during production. The film, along with Smith&#x27;s performance, received praise.

On December 10, 2007, Smith was honored at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. Smith left an imprint of his hands and feet outside the theater in front of many fans. Later that month, Smith starred in the film &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, released on December 14, 2007. Alongside marginally positive reviews, its opening was the largest ever for a film released in the United States during December. Smith himself has said that he considers the film to be &quot;aggressively unique&quot;. A reviewer said that the film&#x27;s commercial success &quot;cemented [Smith&#x27;s] standing as the number one box office draw in Hollywood&quot;. On December 1, 2008, &quot;TV Guide&quot; reported that Smith was selected as one of America&#x27;s top ten most fascinating people of 2008 for a Barbara Walters ABC special that aired on December 4, 2008.

=== 2008–2022: Career fluctuations and &quot;King Richard&quot; ===
In 2008, Smith was reported to be developing a film entitled &quot;The Last Pharaoh&quot;, in which he would be starring as Taharqa. Smith later starred in the superhero movie &quot;Hancock&quot;, which grossed $227,946,274 in the United States and Canada and had a worldwide total of $624,386,746. On August 19, 2011, it was announced that Smith returned to the studio with producer La Mar Edwards to work on his fifth studio album.

Smith again reprised his role as Agent J with &quot;Men in Black 3&quot;, which opened on May 25, 2012, his first major starring role in four years. After the release of the film, Smith was content with ending his work with the franchise, saying, &quot;I think three is enough for me. Three of anything is enough for me. We&#x27;ll look at it and we&#x27;ll consider it, but it feels like that it might be time to let someone else do that&quot;. &quot;Men in Black 3&quot;, released ten years after &quot;Men in Black II&quot; (2002), grossed over $624 million worldwide. Unadjusted for inflation, it is the highest-grossing film in the series. In 2013, Smith starred in &quot;After Earth&quot; with his son Jaden. The film was a disappointment at the domestic box office and was panned critically. Calling the film &quot;the most painful failure in my career&quot;, Smith ended up taking a year and a half break as a result.

Smith starred opposite Margot Robbie in the romance drama &quot;Focus&quot;, released on February 27, 2015. He played Nicky Spurgeon, a veteran con artist who takes a young, attractive woman under his wing. Smith was set to star in the sci-fi thriller &quot;Brilliance&quot;, an adaptation of Marcus Sakey&#x27;s novel of the same name scripted by &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; writer David Koepp, but he left the project to work on the Ridley Scott-produced sports drama &quot;Concussion&quot;.

In &quot;Concussion&quot;, Smith played Dr. Bennet Omalu of the Brain Injury Research Institute, the first to discover chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Smith reported he had doubts about the film early in the production, saying, &quot;some of my happiest memories are of watching my son catch and throw a football. I didn&#x27;t want to be the guy who did a movie saying football could be dangerous&quot;. These views subsided when he met Omalu, whose words about American ideals resonated with Smith. Smith&#x27;s performance was praised for being &quot;sensitive [and] understated&quot;.

In 2016, Smith played Deadshot in the supervillain team-up action film &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;. Smith&#x27;s participation in the film meant choosing it over a role in &quot;Independence Day: Resurgence&quot;, which he said would be like &quot;clinging and clawing backwards&quot;. While &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; was a massive financial success, earning over $700 million at the box office, the film received negative reviews from critics. Christopher Orr, film critic from &quot;The Atlantic&quot; wrote that &quot;the latest offering from the DC Comics superhero universe may be the most disastrous yet&quot;. Later that year, Smith starred in director David Frankel&#x27;s drama &quot;Collateral Beauty&quot;, playing a New York advertising executive who succumbs to a deep depression after a personal tragedy. Weeks after signing Smith onto the film, his father was diagnosed with cancer, from which he died in 2016. As part of his role required him to read about religion and the afterlife, he was brought closer to the elder Smith, calling the experience &quot;a beautiful way to prepare for a movie and an even more majestic way to say goodbye to my father&quot;. The film marked the lowest box office opening of Will Smith&#x27;s career. The film also received near universal negative reviews from film critics. &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; critic David Rooney criticized Smith&#x27;s performance writing as &quot;the least interesting component in a madly overqualified cast&quot;.

His film &quot;Bright&quot; was distributed via Netflix on December 22, 2017. An urban fantasy, it was the most expensive film for Netflix to date. Smith collaborated with his director from &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;, David Ayer. This would also be another critical disappointment for Smith, with critics panning the movie. Richard Roeper of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; criticized the film and Smith&#x27;s performance writing, &quot;By the time Will Smith barks [the line, &quot;Dude, you can&#x27;t go through elf town!&quot;] with 100 percent urgency and sincerity in the mindboggling mess that is &quot;Bright,&quot; it&#x27;s clear we are watching a truly terrible, mountainous pile of genre-blending garbage&quot;.

Also in 2017, Smith released the song &quot;Get Lit&quot; a collaboration between him and his former group mate Jazzy Jeff, and launched his own YouTube channel, which has over 6 million subscribers and 294 million total views. Smith performed the official song &quot;Live It Up&quot; alongside American singer Nicky Jam and Kosovar singer Era Istrefi at the closing ceremony of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Moscow, Russia. That September, Smith appeared, alongside Bad Bunny, on the Marc Anthony song &quot;Está Rico&quot;.

Smith portrayed The Genie (originally voiced by Robin Williams) in the live-action adaptation of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Aladdin&quot;, directed by Guy Ritchie. He also participated in the soundtracks by recording singles: &quot;Arabian Nights (2019)&quot;, &quot;Friend Like Me&quot; and &quot;Prince Ali&quot;. The film was released on May 24, 2019. &quot;Aladdin&quot; grossed over $1 billion worldwide to become Smith&#x27;s highest-grossing film, surpassing &quot;Independence Day&quot;. Smith was also featured on rapper Logic&#x27;s song &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid To Be Different&quot; (2019), from his fifth studio album &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot;.

Smith appeared as an assassin who faces off against a younger clone of himself in Ang Lee&#x27;s &quot;Gemini Man&quot;, released on October 11, 2019. The film was a box office bomb and received negative reviews from critics. &quot;Variety&quot;″s Peter DeBruge called the film &quot;a high-concept misfire&quot; and wrote: &quot;In practice, it&#x27;s been a nearly impossible project to get made, passing through the hands of countless actors and falling through multiple times because the technology wasn&#x27;t there yet. At least, that&#x27;s been the excuse, although judging by the finished product, it was the script that never lived up to the promise of its premise&quot;.

Later that year, Smith had his second starring role in an animated film, in &quot;Spies in Disguise&quot;, opposite Tom Holland. Smith voiced Lance Sterling, a spy who teams up with the nerdy inventor who creates his gadgets (Holland). In 2020, he reteamed with Martin Lawrence for the third film in their franchise, &quot;Bad Boys for Life&quot;. In 2019, Smith and Keisuke Honda led a $46 million investment round in esports organization Gen.G. In June 2020, it was announced that Smith would star in &quot;Emancipation&quot;, directed by Antoine Fuqua, in which he portrays Peter, a runaway slave, who outsmarts hunters and the Louisiana swamp on a journey to the Union Army.

Smith&#x27;s memoir &quot;Will&quot;, which was written with Mark Manson, the author of &quot;The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck,&quot; was published on November 9, 2021, and promoted with a tour. The book is a journey of self-knowledge recalling childhood traumas, his relationship with his father, and his experiences with ayahuasca. In the same year, he and his Westbrook Studios company signed a deal with National Geographic.

Smith portrayed Richard Williams, father and coach of tennis players Venus and Serena Williams, in the 2021 film &quot;King Richard&quot;. For his performance, he won the Academy Award for Best Actor, Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role.

On February 7, 2022, National Geographic announced that Smith would star in a series titled &quot;Pole to Pole&quot;, which will stream on Disney+. The show will follow Smith and his film crew as they go on a trek from the South Pole to the North Pole, crossing all of Earth&#x27;s biomes and spending time in communities along the way. Part of the filming took place during an expedition in the Ecuadorian Amazon which helped discover the northern green anaconda.

==== 2022 Oscars incident ====

During the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022, Smith walked onstage and slapped presenter and comedian Chris Rock who had made a joke about his wife Jada Pinkett Smith&#x27;s shaved head with a reference to the main protagonist in the film &quot;G.I. Jane&quot;. Smith then returned to his seat and yelled at Rock, twice saying &quot;Keep my wife&#x27;s name out your fucking mouth!&quot; Pinkett Smith had been diagnosed with alopecia areata in 2018 and would later shave her head due to the condition. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) said that Smith was asked to leave the ceremony but he refused. Later in the night, Smith was named Best Actor for &quot;King Richard&quot; and apologized to the Academy and the other nominees, but not to Rock, in his acceptance speech. Following public backlash, Smith issued a formal apology via a public Instagram post. ABC, AMPAS, and the Screen Actors Guild condemned Smith following the incident, prompting an investigation by the Academy&#x27;s Board of Governors. Rock declined to press charges against Smith, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. On April 1, 2022, Smith tendered his resignation from the Academy, writing in part:

I deprived other nominees and winners of their opportunity to celebrate and be celebrated for their extraordinary work. I am heartbroken. I want to put the focus back on those who deserve attention for their achievements and allow the Academy to get back to the incredible work it does to support creativity and artistry in film. So, I am resigning from membership in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and will accept any further consequences the Board deems appropriate.

The AMPAS President David Rubin accepted the resignation in an official statement but said they would continue their investigation. Smith&#x27;s resignation means he is no longer able to vote on Oscar nominations as a member of the Academy. Commentators have speculated that Smith&#x27;s resignation from the Academy and other related fallout from the slap would damage his &quot;family brand&quot;.

On April 8, 2022, the Academy announced its decision to ban Smith from future Oscars galas and associated events for 10 years. Several film projects that Smith had been involved in were put on hold as a result of the controversy. In a statement to CNN, Smith stated: &quot;I accept and respect the Academy&#x27;s decision&quot;. Smith offered an on camera apology on July 29, saying he was &quot;deeply remorseful&quot; for his actions.

As a result of the incident, Netflix cancelled production on an action film that was set to star Smith titled &quot;Fast and Loose.&quot; In December 2022, &quot;Emancipation&quot; was released to mixed reviews and was a commercial failure. Producer Todd Black partially attributed the failure to Smith&#x27;s involvement following the Oscar incident.

=== 2023–present: &quot;Bad Boys: Ride or Die&quot; and return to music ===

In 2023, it was announced that Smith would co-star in &quot;Bad Boys: Ride or Die,&quot; the fourth installment in the &quot;Bad Boys&quot; film series. The film includes a comedic moment inspired by the Oscars incident. Smith is set to co-star with Michael B. Jordan in a sequel to &quot;I Am Legend.&quot; The film is in active development. Additionally, Smith is attached to star in the science fiction films &quot;Brilliance&quot; and &quot;Resistor.&quot; Smith was attached to star in crime thriller &quot;Sugar Bandits&quot;, but exited the project in September 2024 due to scheduling conflicts with another undisclosed project; he will remain involved as a producer.

In September 2023, it was reported by VIBE magazine that Joyner Lucas and Will Smith would be working together on a joint album. On May 19, Smith confirmed new music coming in 2024 in an interview with ET and that it is the most personal music he had ever done, with Teddy Swims confirming he recorded music with Will for the upcoming project.

On June 27, 2024, Smith announced on his Instagram that his first solo single in nearly 20 years was coming out the following day, &quot;You Can Make It&quot;, saying &quot;Through some of my darkest moments, music has always been there for me - to lift me and help me grow. It&#x27;s my humble wish that it can do the same for you and bring you all the joy and light you deserve&quot;. The song released at midnight that evening, featuring Fridayy and the Sunday Service Choir. On July 24, 2024, it was announced that Smith had signed a new distribution deal with SLANG, a newly formed independent label. On July 26, 2024, Smith released another single &quot;Work of Art&quot;, featuring his son Jaden and Russ. On December 12, Smith released another single, &quot;TANTRUM&quot;, with Joyner Lucas.

On January 30, 2025, Smith announced his next studio album, now titled &quot;Based on a True Story&quot; would be out in March.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and family===
During the late-1980s, Smith confirmed he briefly dated Sandra Denton, better known as Pepa of the hip-hop group Salt-N-Pepa.

Smith married Sheree Zampino in 1992. Their son Willard Carroll &quot;Trey&quot; Smith III was born on November 11, 1992. The two divorced in 1995. Trey appeared in his father&#x27;s music video for the 1998 single &quot;Just the Two of Us&quot;. He also acted in two episodes of the sitcom &quot;All of Us&quot;, and has appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; and the &quot;David Blaine: Real or Magic&quot; TV special.

Smith married actress Jada Koren Pinkett on December 31, 1997. They met when Pinkett auditioned for a role as Smith&#x27;s character&#x27;s girlfriend in &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;. The pair produce films through their joint production company Overbrook Entertainment and Westbrook Inc. Together they have two children: Jaden Christopher Syre Smith (born 1998), his co-star in &quot;The Pursuit of Happyness&quot; and &quot;After Earth&quot;; and Willow Camille Reign Smith (born 2000), who appeared as his daughter in &quot;I Am Legend&quot;.

Smith and his wife Jada have expressed unconventional practices in their marriage, jokingly calling their commitment &quot;bad marriage for life&quot;. Both he and Pinkett Smith have admitted to having extramarital relationships and believing in the freedom to pursue them. Smith has said he wanted a polyamorous relationship with actress Halle Berry and ballerina Misty Copeland but ultimately abandoned the idea after therapy. In October 2023, Pinkett Smith stated that she and Smith had been separated since 2016, though they have no intention to divorce.

In 2018, Smith celebrated his 50th birthday by performing a bungee jump from a helicopter in the Grand Canyon. Smith was insured by Lloyd&#x27;s of London for $200 million for the jump, which raised money for the charity Global Citizen.

===Religious and political views===
Smith was raised in a Baptist household and attended a Baptist church and Catholic school. In a 2013 interview, he said he did not identify as religious. In 2015, Smith said in an interview with &quot;The Christian Post&quot; that his Christian faith, which was instilled in him by his grandmother, helped him to accurately portray Bennet Omalu in &quot;Concussion&quot;, saying: &quot;She was my spiritual teacher, she was that grandmother at the church, the one having the kids doing the Easter presentations and putting on the Christmas plays and her kids and grandkids had to be first. She was the most spiritually certain person that I had ever met in my entire life. Even to the point that when she was dying she was happy, like she was really excited about going to heaven&quot;. In 2018, Smith performed the Hindu rite of abhisheka of Shiva at Haridwar, India. He also performed an arti of the holy river Ganga. He has said that he feels a deep connection to Hindu spirituality and Indian astrology. Smith and his family also met and spent time with the Indian spiritual leader Sadhguru, stating that he enjoyed the heartfelt conversations between them.

Smith donated $4,600 to the 2008 presidential campaign of Democrat Barack Obama. On December 11, 2009, Smith and his wife hosted the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway, to celebrate Obama&#x27;s winning of the prize. In 2012, Smith said he supported legalizing same-sex marriage. In 2021, Smith announced that production of his upcoming film, &quot;Emancipation&quot;, was being pulled from the U.S. state of Georgia because of the recent passage of the Election Integrity Act of 2021, which critics viewed as a restrictive voting law, negatively impacting non-white voters. Smith and director Antoine Fuqua released a joint statement: &quot;We cannot in good conscience provide economic support to a government that enacts regressive voting laws that are designed to restrict voter access&quot;.

==Public image and legacy==
Smith has often been noted for achieving groundbreaking success throughout his musical career, and with his work as an actor in television and film. He has been cited as one of the &quot;greatest actors&quot; of his generation by several publications. &quot;Forbes&quot; referred to him as the &quot;biggest movie star of the post-9/11 era&quot;. His transition from music to acting has influenced multiple rappers to also become actors, with him being cited as a pioneer for the rappers crossing over into acting by &quot;Complex&quot;. In 2006, &quot;Time&quot; named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world; in 2008, &quot;Esquire&quot; named him one of the 75 most influential people of the 21st century.

 Music 

His work as a member of DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince made them the first rap act to win a Grammy Award, and the first to win an MTV Video Music Award for Best Rap Video, when the song &quot;Parents Just Don&#x27;t Understand&quot; won in the inaugural rap categories at both award show ceremonies. &quot;XXL&quot; has referred to him as &quot;one of the most important rappers of all time&quot;. As of 2013, his debut solo album &quot;Big Willie Style&quot; (1997) is among the best-selling rap albums of all time.

 Television 

Smith launched his acting career by starring in the NBC sitcom &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;; the show&#x27;s success is considered to be a watershed moment for Hip-Hop and Black television, with many publications referring to it as one of the &quot;Greatest Sitcoms of All Time&quot;. Professor Andrew Horton said, &quot;Smith&#x27;s genre of comedy, popularized on the sitcom &quot;Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; translated well into commercial box-office appeal. &quot;The Fresh Prince&quot; watered down and capitalized upon the then growing popularity of Hip Hop and almost anticipated its dominance on the American scene&quot;.

Moreover, author Willie Tolliver noted, &quot;What &quot;The Fresh Prince&quot; did accomplish was to put Smith and his character Will into an environment of affluence and possibility, thus changing the terms of his own Black identity. This social and cultural mobility is central to Smith&#x27;s racial significance, and this will become evident again and again; he moves the image of the Black male into unaccustomed spaces just as Smith himself was in the process of conquering Hollywood&quot;.

 Film 

After starring in his debut film &quot;Where the Day Takes You&quot; (1992), Smith quickly became one of Hollywood&#x27;s most successful and bankable stars. He currently holds the record for the most consecutive $100-million-plus hits at the U.S. box office, with eight. Smith starred as Daryl in the movie &quot;Bright&quot; (2017), which broke the record at the time for the most-viewed Netflix film ever for its first week, and became the first major Hollywood film to skip theatrical release over streaming platform for simultaneous viewing by more than 100 million people worldwide.

For his role as Agent J in &quot;Men in Black 3&quot; (2012), Smith earned the highest-paid movie role of all time, when he reportedly earned $100 million for his role in the film; furthermore his roles in the movies &quot;King Richard&quot; and &quot;Bright&quot; are also among the highest-paid roles of all time. His film &quot;Emancipation&quot; (2022) was sold to Apple Studios for $120 million in June 2020, which made it the largest film festival acquisition deal in film history. In 2022, Smith became the fifth black actor to win the Academy Award for Best Actor behind Sidney Poitier, Denzel Washington, Jamie Foxx, and Forest Whitaker.

==Acting credits and accolades ==

Smith has received multiple awards throughout his career, including an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Richard Williams, the prolific father and coach to championship tennis players Venus and Serena Williams, in the biopic &quot;King Richard&quot; (2021)a role that also won him a Golden Globe Award, BAFTA Award and Screen Actors Guild Award in the same category; he also received a producer nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Prior to this award, he had been nominated several times for the Academy Award (2; for &quot;Ali&quot; and &quot;The Pursuit of Happyness&quot;), the Golden Globe Award (5; for &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, &quot;Ali&quot;, &quot;The Pursuit of Happyness&quot; and &quot;Concussion&quot;), and the Screen Actors Guild Award (once for &quot;The Pursuit of Happyness&quot;). In 2005, he received the honorary César Award; that same year, he was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Musical for &quot;Fela!&quot;; and in 2021, he was nominated as a producer of &quot;Cobra Kai&quot; for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series.

Aside from acting and behind-the-scenes work on screen and stage, Smith has made ventures into hip hop with the release of several songs, four of which won him Grammy Awardsone for Best Rap Performance (for &quot;Parents Just Don&#x27;t Understand&quot;), one for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group (for &quot;Summertime&quot;), and two for Best Rap Solo Performance (for &quot;Men in Black&quot; and &quot;Gettin&#x27; Jiggy wit It&quot;); the former two of which he won as a member of the duo DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince. His Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Award nominations make him one of few black actors to be nominated for all four major entertainment awards in the U.S.

<text>Sands of Iwo Jima is a 1949 war film starring John Wayne that follows a group of United States Marines from training to the Battle of Iwo Jima during World War II. The film, which also features John Agar, Adele Mara and Forrest Tucker, was written by Harry Brown and James Edward Grant, and directed by Allan Dwan. The picture was a Republic Pictures production.

&quot;Sands of Iwo Jima&quot; was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Leading Role (John Wayne), Best Film Editing, Best Sound Recording (Daniel J. Bloomberg) and Best Writing, Motion Picture Story.

==Plot==
Corporal Robert Dunne recounts the story of tough-as-nails career Marine Sergeant John Stryker. Initially he is greatly disliked by the men of his squad, particularly the combat replacements, for the rigorous training he puts them through. He is especially despised by PFC Peter &quot;Pete&quot; Conway, the arrogant, college-educated son of Colonel Sam Conway (whom Stryker served under until the Colonel&#x27;s death on Guadalcanal, and admired), and PFC Al Thomas who blames Stryker for his demotion.

While the unit is in New Zealand, Conway meets Allison Bromley, and marries her a day before the unit goes to Tarawa. Stryker, whose wife left him years ago and took custody of their son, drinks himself to submission and has to be saved from a naval shore patrol by his men.

When Stryker leads his squad in the invasion of Tarawa, the men begin to appreciate his methods. The platoon commander, Lieutenant Baker, is killed seconds after he lands on the beach, and PFCs &quot;Farmer&quot; Soames and &quot;Ski&quot; Choynski are wounded. The Marines are pinned down by a pillbox. Several more men, including PFC Shipley, are killed before Stryker is able to demolish the pillbox with a satchel charge.

Later on, Thomas stops for coffee when he goes to get ammunition for two comrades. As a result, he returns too late — the two Marines run out of ammunition, and Hellenopolis is killed, while Bass is badly wounded. On their first night, the squad is ordered to dig in and hold their positions. Alone and wounded in no-man&#x27;s-land, Bass begs for help. Conway considers Stryker brutal and unfeeling when he refuses to disobey orders and go to Bass&#x27;s rescue.

After the battle, Soames and Bass return, and when Stryker discovers Thomas&#x27;s dereliction from Bass, he provokes a fistfight with him. A passing officer spots this serious offense, but Thomas claims that Stryker was merely teaching him judo. Later, a guilt-ridden Thomas abjectly apologizes to Stryker for his dereliction of duty.

Back on leave, Stryker reveals a softer side while on leave in Honolulu. He picks up a bargirl and goes with her to her apartment. He becomes suspicious when he hears somebody in the next room, but upon investigation, finds only a hungry baby boy. Stryker gives the woman some money and leaves.

Later, during a training exercise, McHugh, a replacement, drops a live hand grenade. Everybody drops to the ground, except Conway, who is distracted reading a letter from his wife. Stryker knocks him down, saving his life, and then proceeds to bawl him out in front of the platoon.

Stryker and his squad are deployed to the battle of Iwo Jima where they suffer heavy casualties within the first couple of hours, with McHugh and PFC Harris being killed, and Soames and Frank Flynn being wounded. Stryker&#x27;s squad is selected to be a part of the 40-man patrol assigned to charge up Mount Suribachi. Conway, who has frequently expressed fears that he is going to die himself, saves Stryker from being killed by a surprise attack, and tells Stryker he is going to name his new baby son Sam, his father&#x27;s name; Stryker smiles and says a Navy Cross winner&#x27;s name is good enough for the boy. During the charge up the hill, Eddie Flynn, Stein, and Fowler are all killed.

While the men are resting during a lull in the fighting, and shortly after Stryker says he has never been better, he is suddenly shot dead by a Japanese soldier emerging from a spider hole; that soldier is quickly killed by Bass. The remaining squad members find a letter Stryker wrote but never sent to his son. In it, Stryker expresses emotions he wanted to say to him but never did. Moments later, the surviving squad members witness the iconic flag raising on Iwo Jima. Conway, who has promised to finish Stryker&#x27;s unfinished letter, echoes Stryker&#x27;s iconic words &quot;Saddle up&quot;, and leads the men back into the war.

==Production==
===Writing===
The film was based on a screenplay by Harry Brown and James Edward Grant from a story by Harry Brown.

The script is the first known work to use the military idiom &quot;&quot;, an expression meaning &quot;get ready to fight&quot;. Although the original use and implied meaning are disputed, it typically described the action of arming an M1 Garand rifle by first locking the bolt back by pulling the charging handle rearward and then loading an 8 round clip into its magazine.

===Casting===
The production used actual combat veterans from Iwo Jima in the film. The three survivors of the five Marines (Rene Gagnon, and Ira Hayes) and a Navy corpsman (John Bradley)who were credited with raising the second flag on Mount Suribachi during the actual battle appear briefly in the film just before the flag raising scene. Hayes was made the subject of a film biography, &quot;The Outsider&quot;, and Bradley the subject of a book by his son James, &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot;. Subsequent research has established that the figures identified in the flag raising photograph as Bradley and Gagnon were actually Marine PFC Harold Schultz and Marine Cpl Harold Keller.

Also appearing as themselves are 1st Lt. Harold Schrier, who led the flag-raising patrol up Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima and helped raise the first flag, Col. David M. Shoup, later Commandant of the Marine Corps and recipient of the Medal of Honor at Tarawa, and Lt. Col. Henry P. &quot;Jim&quot; Crowe, commander of the 2nd Battalion 8th Marines at Tarawa, where he earned the U.S. Navy Cross. Additionally, &quot;nearly 2,000 Marines were used as extras&quot; during filming.

The cast of John Wayne, John Agar, Forrest Tucker, and Richard Jaeckel would reunite in the 1970 western &quot;Chisum&quot; .

===Filming===
The movie was made on location in California. Scenes were filmed at the Marine Corps Base at Camp Pendleton, Leo Carrillo State Beach, Santa Catalina Island, Channel Islands, Janss Conejo Ranch, Thousand Oaks, Republic Studios and Universal Studios. Actual combat footage from the Pacific War was also used in the film.

==Legacy==
The film received four nominations at the 22nd Academy Awards, including John Wayne for Best Actor, his first nomination in the category. It won no awards. A sequel to the film starring Wayne, called &quot;Devil Birds&quot;, was planned but never materialized.

In the television show &quot;King of the Hill&quot; (1997–2010), this is the favorite film of Cotton Hill, father of main character Hank Hill. Hank recalls that, during his childhood, his father would travel around Texas searching for showings of this film.

The episode &quot;Call of Silence&quot; (2004) in &quot;NCIS&quot;&#x27;s season 2 references the film and a documentary as shared background to Marine history and legacy. The episode shows the NCIS character Timothy McGee watching the documentary &quot;To the Shores of Iwo Jima&quot;; the character Anthony DiNozzo approaches and, in furtherance of the character&#x27;s schtick as an avowed and knowledgeable movie buff, begins talking about the theatrical film &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima&quot;, some scenes of which were taken from the documentary.

The Southern rock band Drive-By Truckers have a song title &quot;The Sands of Iwo Jima&quot; on their 2004 album &quot;The Dirty South&quot;. It is sung from the perspective of a young boy who has been exposed to World War 2 through old John Wayne movies. He asks his great-uncle, a World War II veteran, if &quot;The Sands of Iwo Jima&quot; represents the war properly; the old man smiles, shakes his head and responds, &quot;I never saw John Wayne on the sands of Iwo Jima.&quot;

<doc id="154708" wikidata="Q131005600" url="?curid=154708" title="List of national legal systems">
<text>The contemporary national legal systems are generally based on one of four major legal traditions: civil law, common law, customary law, religious law or combinations of these. However, the legal system of each country is shaped by its unique history and so incorporates individual variations. The science that studies law at the level of legal systems is called comparative law.

Both &quot;civil&quot; (also known as &quot;Roman&quot;) and &quot;common&quot; law systems can be considered the most widespread in the world: civil law because it is the most widespread by landmass and by population overall, and common law because it is employed by the greatest number of people compared to any single civil law system.

==Civil law==

The source of law that is recognized as authoritative is codifications in a constitution or statute passed by legislature, to amend a code.
While the concept of codification dates back to the Code of Hammurabi in Babylon ca. 1790 BC, civil law systems derive from the Roman Empire and, more particularly, the &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot; issued by the Emperor Justinian ca. AD 529. This was an extensive reform of the law in the Byzantine Empire, bringing it together into codified documents. Civil law was also partly influenced by religious laws such as Canon law and Islamic law. Civil law today, in theory, is interpreted rather than developed or made by judges. Only legislative enactments (rather than legal precedents, as in common law) are considered legally binding.

Scholars of comparative law and economists promoting the legal origins theory usually subdivide civil law into distinct groups:
* French civil law: in France, the Benelux countries, Italy, Romania, Spain and former colonies of those countries, mainly in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East;
* German civil law: in Germany, Austria, Russia, Switzerland, Estonia, Latvia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo*, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Serbia, Greece, Portugal and its former colonies, Turkey, and East Asian countries including Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan (Republic of China);
* Scandinavian civil law: in Northern Europe such as Denmark, Norway, Finland, Iceland and Sweden. As historically integrated into the Scandinavian cultural sphere, Finland and Iceland also inherited the system, although especially Iceland has its own legal roots. Scandinavian or Nordic civil law exhibit least similar traits with other civil law systems and is sometimes considered a legal system in its own right, despite reception from mainly German civil law. 

However, some of these legal systems are often and more correctly said to be of hybrid nature:
*Napoleonic to Germanistic influence (Italian civil law) 
The Italian civil code of 1942 replaced the original one of 1865, introducing germanistic elements due to the geopolitical alliances of the time. The Italian approach has been imitated by other countries including Portugal (1966), the Netherlands (1992), Lithuania (2000), Brazil (2002) and Argentina (2014). Most of them have innovations introduced by the Italian legislation, including the unification of the civil and commercial codes.

*Germanistic to Napoleonic influence (Swiss civil law)
The Swiss civil code is considered mainly influenced by the German civil code and partly influenced by the French civil code. The civil code of the Republic of Turkey is a slightly modified version of the Swiss code, adopted in 1926 during Mustafa Kemal Atatürk&#x27;s presidency as part of the government&#x27;s progressive reforms and secularization.

A comprehensive list of countries that base their legal system on a codified civil law follows:
==Common law==
Common law and equity are systems of law whose sources are the decisions in cases by judges. In addition, every system will have a legislature that passes new laws and statutes. The relationships between statutes and judicial decisions can be complex. In some jurisdictions, such statutes may overrule judicial decisions or codify the topic covered by several contradictory or ambiguous decisions. In some jurisdictions, judicial decisions may decide whether the jurisdiction&#x27;s constitution allowed a particular statute or statutory provision to be made or what meaning is contained within the statutory provisions. The common law developed in England, influenced by Anglo-Saxon law and to a much lesser extent by the Norman conquest of England, which introduced legal concepts from Norman law, which, in turn, had its origins in Salic law. Common law was later inherited by the Commonwealth of Nations, and almost every former colony of the British Empire has adopted it (Malta being an exception). The doctrine of &quot;stare decisis&quot;, also known as &quot;case law&quot; or &quot;precedent by courts&quot;, is the major difference to codified civil law systems.

Common law is practiced in Canada (excluding Quebec), Australia, New Zealand, most of the United Kingdom (England, Wales, and Northern Ireland), South Africa, Ireland, India (excluding Goa and Puducherry), Pakistan, Hong Kong, the United States (on state and territorial levels excluding Louisiana and Puerto Rico), Bangladesh, and many other places. Several others have adapted the common law system into a mixed system; For example, Nigeria operates largely on a common law system in the southern states and at the federal level, but also incorporates religious law in the northern states.

In the European Union, the Court of Justice takes an approach mixing civil law (based on the treaties) with an attachment to the importance of case law. One of the most fundamental documents to shape common law is the English Magna Carta, which placed limits on the power of the English Kings. It served as a kind of medieval bill of rights for the aristocracy and the judiciary who developed the law.

==Religious law==
Religious law refers to the notion of a religious system or document being used as a legal source, though the methodology used varies. For example, the use of Judaism and &quot;halakha&quot; for public law has a static and unalterable quality, precluding amendment through legislative acts of government or development through judicial precedent; Christian canon law is more similar to civil law in its use of codes; and Islamic sharia law (and &quot;fiqh&quot; jurisprudence) is based on legal precedent and reasoning by analogy (&quot;qiyas&quot;), and is thus considered similar to common law.

The main kinds of religious law are sharia in Islam, &quot;halakha&quot; in Judaism, and canon law in some Christian groups. In some cases these are intended purely as individual moral guidance, whereas in other cases they are intended and may be used as the basis for a country&#x27;s legal system; the latter was particularly common during the Middle Ages.
&quot;Halakha&quot; is followed by Orthodox and Conservative Jews in both ecclesiastical and civil relations. No country is fully governed by &quot;halakha&quot;, but two Jewish people may decide, because of personal belief, to have a dispute heard by a Jewish court, and be bound by its rulings.

Canon law is the internal ecclesiastical law, or operational policy, governing the Catholic Church (both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches), the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches, and the individual national churches within the Anglican Communion. Canon law of the Catholic Church () is the system of laws and legal principles made and enforced by the hierarchical authorities of the Catholic Church to regulate its external organisation and government and to order and direct the activities of Catholics toward the mission of the church. The canon law of the Catholic Church has all the ordinary elements of a mature legal system: laws, courts, lawyers, judges. The canon law of the Latin Church was the first modern Western legal system, and is the oldest continuously functioning legal system in the West. while the distinctive traditions of Eastern Catholic canon law govern the 23 Eastern Catholic particular churches &quot;sui iuris.&quot; 

The Islamic legal system, consisting of sharia (Islamic law) and &quot;fiqh&quot; (Islamic jurisprudence), is the most widely used religious law system, and one of the three most common legal systems in the world alongside common law and civil law. It is based on both divine law, derived from the hadith of the Quran and Sunnah, and the rulings of &quot;ulema&quot; (jurists), who use the methods of &quot;ijma&quot; (consensus), &quot;qiyas&quot; (analogical deduction), &quot;ijtihad&quot; (research), and &quot;urf&quot; (common practice) to derive fatwā (legal opinions). An &quot;ulema&quot; was required to qualify for an &quot;ijazah&quot; (legal doctorate) at a &quot;madrasa&quot; (law school or college) before they could issue &quot;fatwā&quot;. During the Islamic Golden Age, classical Islamic law may have had an influence on the development of common law and several civil law institutions. Sharia law governs a number of Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, though most countries use Sharia law only as a supplement to national law. It can relate to all aspects of civil law, including property rights, contracts, and public law.

==Pluralistic systems==

===Civil law and canon law===

Canon law is not divine law, properly speaking, because it is not found in revelation. Instead, it is seen as human law inspired by the word of God and applying the demands of that revelation to the actual situation of the church. Canon law regulates the internal ordering of the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Anglican Communion. Canon law is amended and adopted by the legislative authority of the church, such as councils of bishops, individual bishops for their respective sees, the Pope for the entire Catholic Church, and the British Parliament for the Church of England.
===Civil law and common law===
===Civil law and sharia law===
===Common law and sharia law===
==By geography==
Despite the usefulness of different classifications, every legal system has its own individual identity. Below are groups of legal systems, categorised by their geographic location.

<text>Aerospace is a term used to collectively refer to the atmosphere and outer space. Aerospace activity is very diverse, with a multitude of commercial, industrial, and military applications. Aerospace engineering consists of aeronautics and astronautics. Aerospace organizations research, design, manufacture, operate, maintain, and repair both aircraft and spacecraft.

The beginning of space and the ending of the air are proposed as 100km (62mi) above the ground according to the physical explanation that the air density is too low for a lifting body to generate meaningful lift force without exceeding orbital velocity.

== Overview ==
In most industrial countries, the aerospace industry is a co-operation of the public and private sectors. For example, several states have a civilian space program funded by the government, such as National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the United States, European Space Agency in Europe, the Canadian Space Agency in Canada, Indian Space Research Organisation in India, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency in Japan, Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities in Russia, China National Space Administration in China, SUPARCO in Pakistan, Iranian Space Agency in Iran, and Korea Aerospace Research Institute in South Korea.

Along with these public space programs, many companies produce technical tools and components such as spacecraft and satellites. Some known companies involved in space programs include Boeing, Cobham, Airbus, SpaceX, Lockheed Martin, RTX Corporation, MDA and Northrop Grumman. These companies are also involved in other areas of aerospace, such as the construction of aircraft.

== History ==

Modern aerospace began with Engineer George Cayley in 1799. Cayley proposed an aircraft with a &quot;fixed wing and a horizontal and vertical tail,&quot; defining characteristics of the modern aeroplane.

The 19th century saw the creation of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain (1866), the American Rocketry Society, and the Institute of Aeronautical Sciences, all of which made aeronautics a more serious scientific discipline. Airmen like Otto Lilienthal, who introduced cambered airfoils in 1891, used gliders to analyze aerodynamic forces. The Wright brothers were interested in Lilienthal&#x27;s work and read several of his publications. They also found inspiration in Octave Chanute, an airman and the author of &quot;Progress in Flying Machines&quot; (1894). It was the preliminary work of Cayley, Lilienthal, Chanute, and other early aerospace engineers that brought about the first powered sustained flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina on December 17, 1903, by the Wright brothers.

War and science fiction inspired scientists and engineers like Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and Wernher von Braun to achieve flight beyond the atmosphere. World War II inspired Wernher von Braun to create the V1 and V2 rockets.

The launch of Sputnik 1 in October 1957 started the Space Age, and on July 20, 1969 Apollo 11 achieved the first crewed Moon landing. In April 1981, the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; launched, the start of regular crewed access to orbital space. A sustained human presence in orbital space started with &quot;Mir&quot; in 1986 and is continued by the &quot;International Space Station&quot;. Space commercialization and space tourism are more recent features of aerospace.

==Manufacturing==
Aerospace manufacturing is a high-technology industry that produces &quot;aircraft, guided missiles, space vehicles, aircraft engines, propulsion units, and related parts&quot;. Most of the industry is geared toward governmental work. For each original equipment manufacturer (OEM), the US government has assigned a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code. These codes help to identify each manufacturer, repair facilities, and other critical aftermarket vendors in the aerospace industry.

In the United States, the Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are the two largest consumers of aerospace technology and products. Others include the very large airline industry. The aerospace industry employed 472,000 wage and salary workers in 2006. Most of those jobs were in Washington state and in California, with Missouri, New York and Texas also being important. The leading aerospace manufacturers in the U.S. are Boeing, United Technologies Corporation, SpaceX, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin. As talented American employees age and retire, these manufacturers face an expanding labor shortfall. In order to supply the industrial sector with fresh workers, apprenticeship programs like the Aerospace Joint Apprenticeship Council (AJAC) collaborate with community colleges and aerospace firms in Washington state.

Important locations of the civilian aerospace industry worldwide include Washington state (Boeing), California (Boeing, Lockheed Martin, etc.) and Montreal, Quebec, Canada (Bombardier, Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada) in North America; Toulouse, France (Airbus SE) and Hamburg, Germany (Airbus SE) in Europe; as well as São José dos Campos, Brazil (Embraer), Querétaro, Mexico (Bombardier Aerospace, General Electric Aviation) and Mexicali, Mexico (United Technologies Corporation, Gulfstream Aerospace) in Latin America.

In the European Union, aerospace companies such as Airbus SE, Safran, Thales, Dassault Aviation, Leonardo and Saab AB account for a large share of the global aerospace industry and research effort, with the European Space Agency as one of the largest consumers of aerospace technology and products.

In India, Bangalore is a major center of the aerospace industry, where Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, the National Aerospace Laboratories and the Indian Space Research Organisation are headquartered. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) launched India&#x27;s first Moon orbiter, Chandrayaan-1, in October 2008.

In Russia, large aerospace companies like Oboronprom and the United Aircraft Building Corporation (encompassing Mikoyan, Sukhoi, Ilyushin, Tupolev, Yakovlev, and Irkut which includes Beriev) are among the major global players in this industry. The historic Soviet Union was also the home of a major aerospace industry.

The United Kingdom formerly attempted to maintain its own large aerospace industry, making its own airliners and warplanes, but it has largely turned its lot over to cooperative efforts with continental companies, and it has turned into a large import customer, too, from countries such as the United States. However, the United Kingdom has a very active aerospace sector, with major companies such as BAE Systems, supplying fully assembled aircraft, aircraft components, sub-assemblies and sub-systems to other manufacturers, both in Europe and all over the world.

Canada has formerly manufactured some of its own designs for jet warplanes, etc. (e.g. the CF-100 fighter), but for some decades, it has relied on imports from the United States and Europe to fill these needs. However Canada still manufactures some military aircraft although they are generally not combat capable. Another notable example was the late 1950s development of the Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow, a supersonic fighter-interceptor whose 1959 cancellation was considered highly controversial.

France has continued to make its own warplanes for its air force and navy, and Sweden continues to make its own warplanes for the Swedish Air Force—especially in support of its position as a neutral country. (See Saab AB.) Other European countries either team up in making fighters (such as the Panavia Tornado and the Eurofighter Typhoon), or else to import them from the United States.

Pakistan has a developing aerospace engineering industry. The National Engineering and Scientific Commission, Khan Research Laboratories and Pakistan Aeronautical Complex are among the premier organizations involved in research and development in this sector. Pakistan has the capability of designing and manufacturing guided rockets, missiles and space vehicles. The city of Kamra is home to the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex which contains several factories. This facility is responsible for manufacturing the MFI-17, MFI-395, K-8 and JF-17 Thunder aircraft. Pakistan also has the capability to design and manufacture both armed and unarmed unmanned aerial vehicles.

In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Beijing, Xi&#x27;an, Chengdu, Shanghai, Shenyang and Nanchang are major research and manufacture centers of the aerospace industry. China has developed an extensive capability to design, test and produce military aircraft, missiles and space vehicles. Despite the cancellation in 1983 of the experimental Shanghai Y-10, China is still developing its civil aerospace industry.

The aircraft parts industry was born out of the sale of second-hand or used aircraft parts from the aerospace manufacture sector. Within the United States there is a specific process that parts brokers or resellers must follow. This includes leveraging a certified repair station to overhaul and &quot;tag&quot; a part. This certification guarantees that a part was repaired or overhauled to meet OEM specifications. Once a part is overhauled its value is determined from the supply and demand of the aerospace market. When an airline has an aircraft on the ground, the part that the airline requires to get the plane back into service becomes invaluable. This can drive the market for specific parts. There are several online marketplaces that assist with the commodity selling of aircraft parts.

In the aerospace and defense industry, much consolidation occurred at the end of the 20th century and in the early 21st century. Between 1988 and 2011, more than 6,068 mergers and acquisitions with a total known value of US$678 billion were announced worldwide. The largest transactions have been:
* The acquisition of Rockwell Collins by United Technologies Corporation for US$30.0 billion in 2018
* The acquisition of Goodrich Corporation by United Technologies Corporation for US$16.2 billion in 2011
* The merger of Allied Signal with Honeywell in a stock swap valued at US$15.6 billion in 1999
* The merger of Boeing with McDonnell valued at US$13.4 billion in 1996
* The acquisition of Marconi Electronic Systems, a subsidiary of GEC, by British Aerospace for US$12.9 billion in 1999 (now called: BAE Systems)
* The acquisition of Hughes Aircraft by Raytheon for US$9.5 billion in 1997

==Technology==

Multiple technologies and innovations are used in aerospace, many of them pioneered around World War II:
* patented by Short Brothers, folding wings optimise aircraft carrier storage from a simple fold to the entire rotating wing of the V-22, and the wingtip fold of the Boeing 777X for airport compatibility.
* To improve low-speed performance, a de Havilland DH4 was modified by Handley Page to a monoplane with high-lift devices: full-span leading-edge slats and trailing-edge flaps; in 1924, Fowler flaps that extend backward and downward were invented in the US, and used on the Lockheed Model 10 Electra while in 1943 forward-hinged leading-edge Krueger flaps were invented in Germany and later used on the Boeing 707.
* The 1927 large Propeller Research Tunnel at NACA Langley confirmed that the landing gear was a major source of drag, in 1930 the Boeing Monomail featured a retractable gear.
* The flush rivet displaced the domed rivet in the 1930s and pneumatic rivet guns work in combination with a heavy reaction bucking bar; not depending on plastic deformation, specialist rivets were developed to improve fatigue life as shear fasteners like the Hi-Lok, threaded pins tightened until a collar breaks off with enough torque.
* First flown in 1935, the Queen Bee was a radio-controlled target drone derived from the Tiger Moth for Flak training; the Ryan Firebee was a jet-powered target drone developed into long-range reconnaissance UAVs: the Ryan Model 147 Fire Fly and Lightning Bug; the Israeli IAI Scout and Tadiran Mastiff launched a line of battlefield UAVs including the IAI Searcher; developed from the General Atomics Gnat long-endurance UAV for the CIA, the MQ-1 Predator led to the armed MQ-9 Reaper.
* At the end of World War I, piston engine power could be boosted by compressing intake air with a compressor, also compensating for decreasing air density with altitude, improved with 1930s turbochargers for the Boeing B-17 and the first pressurized airliners.
* The 1937 Hindenburg disaster ended the era of passenger airships but the US Navy used airships for anti-submarine warfare and airborne early warning into the 1960s, while small airships continue to be used for aerial advertising, sightseeing flights, surveillance and research, and the Airlander 10 or the Lockheed Martin LMH-1 continue to be developed.
* As US airlines were interested in high-altitude flying in the mid-1930s, the Lockheed XC-35 with a pressurized cabin was tested in 1937 and the Boeing 307 Stratoliner would be the first pressurized airliner to enter commercial service.
* In 1933, Plexiglas, a transparent Acrylic plastic, was introduced in Germany and shortly before World War II, was first used for aircraft windshields as it is lighter than glass, and the bubble canopy improved fighter pilots visibility.
* In January 1930, Royal Air Force pilot and engineer Frank Whittle filed a patent for a gas turbine aircraft engine with an inlet, compressor, combustor, turbine and nozzle, while an independent turbojet was developed by researcher Hans von Ohain in Germany; both engines ran within weeks in early 1937 and the Heinkel HeS 3-propelled Heinkel He 178 experimental aircraft made its first flight on Aug 27, 1939 while the Whittle W.1-powered Gloster E.28/39 prototype flew on May 15, 1941.
* In 1935, Britain demonstrated aircraft radio detection and ranging and in 1940 the RAF introduced the first VHF airborne radars on Bristol Blenheims, then higher-resolution microwave-frequency radar with a cavity magnetron on Bristol Beaufighters in 1941, and in 1959 the radar-homing Hughes AIM-4 Falcon became the first US guided missile on the Convair F-106.
* In the early 1940s, British Hurricane and Spitfire pilots wore g-suits to prevent G-LOC due to blood pooling in the lower body in high g situations; Mayo Clinic researchers developed air-filled bladders to replace water-filled bladders and in 1943 the US military began using pressure suits from the David Clark Company.
* The modern ejection seat was developed during World War II, a seat on rails ejected by rockets before deploying a parachute, which could have been enhanced by the USAF in the late 1960s as a turbojet-powered autogyro with 50 nm of range, the Kaman KSA-100 SAVER.
* In 1942, numerical control machining was conceived by machinist John T. Parsons to cut complex structures from solid blocks of alloy, rather than assembling them, improving quality, reducing weight, and saving time and cost to produce bulkheads or wing skins.
* In World War II, the German V-2 combined gyroscopes, an accelerometer and a primitive computer for real-time inertial navigation allowing dead reckoning without reference to landmarks or guide stars, leading to packaged IMUs for spacecraft and aircraft.
* The UK Miles M.52 supersonic aircraft was to have an afterburner, augmenting a turbojet thrust by burning additional fuel in the nozzle, but was cancelled in 1946.
* In 1935, German aerodynamicist Adolf Busemann proposed using swept wings to reduce high-speed drag and the Messerschmitt P.1101 fighter prototype was 80% complete by the end of World War II; the later US North American F-86 and Boeing B-47 flew in 1947, as the Soviet MiG-15, and the British de Havilland Comet in 1949.
* In 1951, the Avro Jetliner featured an ice protection system from Goodyear through electro-thermal resistances in the wing and tail leading edges; jet aircraft use hot engine bleed air and lighter aircraft use pneumatic deicing boots or weep anti-icing fluid on propellers, wing and tail leading edges.
* In 1954, Bell Labs developed the first transistorized airborne digital computer, Tradic for the US Boeing B-52 and in the 1960s Raytheon built the MIT-developed Apollo Guidance Computer; the MIL-STD-1553 avionics digital bus was defined in 1973 then first used in the General Dynamics F-16, while the civil ARINC 429 was first used in the Boeing 757/B767 and Airbus A310 in the early 1980s.
* After World War II, the initial promoter of Photovoltaic power for spacecraft, Hans K. Ziegler, was brought to the US under Operation Paperclip along Wernher von Braun and Vanguard 1 was its first application in 1958, later enhanced in space-deployable structures like the International Space Station solar arrays of .
* To board an airliner, jet bridges are more accessible, comfortable and efficient than climbing the stairs.
* In the 1950s, to improve thrust and fuel efficiency, the jet engine airflow was divided into a core stream and a bypass stream with a lower velocity for better propulsive efficiency: the first was the Rolls-Royce Conway with a 0.3 BPR on the Boeing 707 in 1960, followed by the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D with a 1.5 BPR and, derived from the J79, the General Electric CJ805 powered the Convair 990 with a 28% lower cruise fuel burn; bypass ratio improved to the 9.3 BPR Rolls-Royce Trent XWB, the 10:1 BPR GE9X and the Pratt &amp; Whitney GTF with high-pressure ratio cores.

==Functional safety==

Functional safety relates to a part of the general safety of a system or a piece of equipment. It implies that the system or equipment can be operated properly and without causing any danger, risk, damage or injury.

Functional safety is crucial in the aerospace industry, which allows no compromises or negligence. In this respect, supervisory bodies, such as the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), regulate the aerospace market with strict certification standards. This is meant to reach and ensure the highest possible level of safety. The standards AS 9100 in America, EN 9100 on the European market or JISQ 9100 in Asia particularly address the aerospace and aviation industry. These are standards applying to the functional safety of aerospace vehicles. Some companies are therefore specialized in the certification, inspection, verification and testing of the vehicles and spare parts to ensure and attest compliance with the appropriate regulations.

==Spinoffs==
Spinoffs refer to any technology that is a direct result of coding or products created by NASA and redesigned for an alternate purpose. These technological advancements are one of the primary results of the aerospace industry, with $5.2 billion worth of revenue generated by spinoff technology, including computers and cellular devices. These spinoffs have applications in a variety of different fields including medicine, transportation, energy, consumer goods, public safety and more. NASA publishes an annual report called &quot;Spinoffs&quot;, regarding many of the specific products and benefits to the aforementioned areas in an effort to highlight some of the ways funding is put to use. For example, in the most recent edition of this publication, &quot;Spinoffs 2015&quot;, endoscopes are featured as one of the medical derivations of aerospace achievement. This device enables more precise and subsequently cost-effective neurosurgery by reducing complications through a minimally invasive procedure that abbreviates hospitalization. &quot;These NASA technologies are not only giving companies and entrepreneurs a competitive edge in their own industries, but are also helping to shape budding industries, such as commercial lunar landers,&quot; said Daniel Lockney.

<text>Starcraft (21 October 2000 – 3 November 2022) was a New Zealand-bred Thoroughbred racehorse who came to international attention when he won the Group 1 Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Newmarket in England in September 2005. He was the winner of five Group One (G1) races in four countries, the 2004 Australian Champion Three Year Old and also the 2005 World Champion Older Turf Miler.

==Breeding==
He was a chestnut stallion, standing high, foaled at Garry and Mark Chittick&#x27;s Waikato Stud in New Zealand. Starcraft was by Soviet Star (USA), from Flying Floozie (Pompeii Court (USA) - Lucky Heiress). He was half-brother to Forum Floozie (by Danasinga (AUS), a listed race winner of $478,530). Starcraft was auctioned as a yearling and sold for only NZ$80,000 to a syndicate of Australians, headed by Australian Paul Makin.

==Racing record==
Starcraft progressed from a second placing in a two-year-old maiden race in Queensland to winning the Group 1 Australian Derby in Sydney, Australia as a three-year-old. Other victories included the Group 1 Chipping Norton Stakes, also in Sydney. As a four-year-old he won the Group 2 Stoneybridge Stakes and Group 1 Mudgway Stakes in New Zealand before being beaten into third place in the 2004 Cox Plate after starting one of the favourites. Despite this setback the owners continued with their plans on worldwide campaign for Starcraft.

Starcraft was taken to Great Britain on 4 February 2005 where he was trained by Italian Luca Cumani and was ridden by French jockey Christophe Lemaire.

In Europe, he surprised many Northern Hemisphere race fans with his dominance when he won the 1,600 metre Prix du Moulin at Longchamp, Paris. He proved this was no fluke, and that he was the dominant miler in Europe, when winning the G1 Queen Elizabeth II Stakes which was held at Newmarket because Ascot was being refurbished at the time. This was his 11th win from 22 race starts and his fifth G1 success.

The horse started in the $4 million Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic event at Belmont Park in the United States in 2005. The owners had to pay a fee of $800,000 to enter him in this race, which was considered a huge gamble because it was a dirt track and the horse had always previously raced on grass. He drew the outside barrier, got away to a slow start and finished 7th in a 13 horse field.

==Stud record==
Starcraft retired to stud in 2006. He served his first group of mares to Northern Hemisphere time at Cheveley Park Stud at Newmarket, England. He was exported from England on 7 August 2006 and stood his first Southern Hemisphere season at Arrowfield Stud in the Hunter Valley, New South Wales.

He is the sire of over 250 live foals that have now won over $1,187,752, including:
* Star Witness – (won G1 2010 Blue Diamond Stakes, G1 2010 Coolmore Stud Stakes)
* We Can Say It Now - (won G1 2010 Levin Classic, G1 2010 Captain Cook Stakes)
In 2010 66 Starcraft yearlings were sold for an average of $99,288. His advertised 2011 service fee is $44,000.

Starcraft died on 3 November 2022 after a short illness.

<text>The is the last division of classical Japanese history, running from 794 to 1185. It followed the Nara period, beginning when the 50th emperor, Emperor Kammu, moved the capital of Japan to Heian-kyō (modern Kyoto). means in Japanese. It is a period in Japanese history when the Chinese influences were in decline and the national culture matured. The Heian period is also considered the peak of the Japanese imperial court, noted for its art, especially poetry and literature. Two syllabaries unique to Japan, katakana and hiragana, emerged during this time. This gave rise to Japan&#x27;s famous vernacular literature, with many of its texts written by court ladies who were not as educated in Chinese as their male counterparts.
Although the Imperial House of Japan had power on the surface, the real power was in the hands of the Fujiwara clan, a powerful aristocratic family who had intermarried with the imperial family; most Emperors of the Heian era had mothers from the Fujiwara family. The economy mostly existed through barter and trade due to the lack of a national currency, while the &quot;shōen&quot; system encouraged the growth of aristocratic estates that began gradually asserting their independence from Imperial control. Despite a lack of serious warfare or domestic strife during the Heian era, crime and banditry were widespread as the Emperors failed to police the country effectively.

==History==
The Heian period was preceded by the Nara period and began in 794 AD after the movement of the capital of Japan to Heian-kyō (modern Kyoto), by the 50th emperor, Emperor Kammu. Kammu first tried to move the capital to Nagaoka-kyō, but a series of disasters befell the city, prompting the emperor to relocate the capital a second time, to Heian. A rebellion occurred in China toward the end of the 9th century, making the political situation unstable. The Japanese missions to Tang China were suspended and the influx of Chinese exports halted, a fact which facilitated the independent growth of Japanese culture called . Therefore, the Heian period is considered a high point in Japanese culture, one that later generations both admired and sought to emulate. The period is also noted for the emergence of the &quot;samurai&quot; class, the result of feudal lords training their own warriors to police and enforce order as they gained land and resources through Imperial benefices.

Nominally, sovereignty lay in the emperor but in fact, power was wielded by the Fujiwara nobility. To protect their interests in the provinces, nobles financed the training and arming of soldiers who in turn swore them allegiance rather than the Imperial court. These soldiers, the first &quot;samurai&quot;, later gained land and wealth of their own as an incentive to remain loyal. As early as 939 AD, the warlord Taira no Masakado threatened the authority of the central government, leading an uprising in the eastern province of Hitachi, and almost simultaneously, Fujiwara no Sumitomo rebelled in the west; &quot;samurai&quot; played a crucial role in suppressing both disturbances on behalf of the Emperor. Still, a true military takeover of the Japanese government was centuries away, when much of the strength of the government would lie within the private armies of the shogunate.

The entry of the warrior class into court influence was a result of the Hōgen Rebellion. At this time Taira no Kiyomori revived the Fujiwara practices by placing his grandson on the throne to rule Japan by regency. Their clan, the Taira, would not be overthrown until after the Genpei War, which marked the start of the Kamakura shogunate. The Kamakura period began in 1185 when the family of Minamoto no Yoritomo seized power from the emperors and established the shogunate in their ancestral home, Kamakura.

===Fujiwara regency===
When Emperor Kammu moved the capital to Heian-kyō (Kyoto), which remained the imperial capital for the next 1,000 years, he did so not only to strengthen imperial authority but also to improve his seat of government geopolitically. Nara was abandoned after only 70 years in part due to the ascendancy of Dōkyō and the encroaching secular power of the Buddhist institutions there. Kyoto had good river access to the sea and could be reached by land routes from the eastern provinces. The early Heian period (784–967) continued Nara culture; the Heian capital was patterned on the Chinese Tang capital at Chang&#x27;an, as was Nara, but on a larger scale than Nara. Kammu endeavored to improve the Tang-style administrative system which was in use. Known as the &quot;Ritsuryō Code&quot;, this system attempted to recreate the Tang legal system in Japan, despite the &quot;tremendous differences in the levels of development between the two countries&quot;. Despite the decline of the Taika–Taihō reforms, the imperial government was vigorous during the early Heian period. Kammu&#x27;s avoidance of drastic reform decreased the intensity of political struggles, and he became recognized as one of Japan&#x27;s most forceful emperors.

Although Kammu had abandoned universal conscription in 792, he still waged major military offensives to subjugate the Emishi, possible descendants of the displaced Jōmon, living in northern and eastern Japan. After making temporary gains in 794, in 797, Kammu appointed a new commander, Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, under the title &quot;Seii Taishōgun&quot; (&quot;Barbarian-subduing generalissimo&quot;). By 801, the &quot;shōgun&quot; had defeated the Emishi and had extended the imperial domains to the eastern end of Honshū. Imperial control over the provinces was tenuous at best, however. In the ninth and tenth centuries, much authority was lost to the great families, who disregarded the Chinese-style land and tax systems imposed by the government in Kyoto. Stability came to Japan, but, even though succession was ensured for the imperial family through heredity, power again concentrated in the hands of one noble family, the Fujiwara.
Following Kammu&#x27;s death in 806 and a succession struggle among his sons, two new offices were established in an effort to adjust the Taika–Taihō administrative structure. Through the new Emperor&#x27;s Private Office, the emperor could issue administrative edicts more directly and with more self-assurance than before. The new Metropolitan Police Board replaced the largely ceremonial imperial guard units. While these two offices strengthened the emperor&#x27;s position temporarily, soon they and other Chinese-style structures were bypassed in the developing state. In 838 the end of the imperial-sanctioned missions to Tang China, which had begun in 630, marked the effective end of Chinese influence. Tang China was in a state of decline, and Chinese Buddhists were severely persecuted, undermining Japanese respect for Chinese institutions. Japan began to turn inward.

As the Soga clan had taken control of the throne in the sixth century, the Fujiwara by the ninth century had intermarried with the imperial family, and one of their members was the first head of the Emperor&#x27;s Private Office. Another Fujiwara became regent, Sesshō for his grandson, then a minor emperor and yet another was appointed Kampaku. Toward the end of the 9th century, several emperors tried but failed, to check the Fujiwara. For a time, however, during the reign of Emperor Daigo (897–930), the Fujiwara regency was suspended as he ruled directly.

Nevertheless, the Fujiwara were not demoted by Daigo but actually became stronger during his reign. Central control of Japan had continued to decline, and the Fujiwara, along with other great families and religious foundations, acquired ever larger &quot;shōen&quot; and greater wealth during the early tenth century. By the early Heian period, the &quot;shōen&quot; had obtained legal status, and the large religious establishments sought clear titles in perpetuity, waiver of taxes, and immunity from government inspection of the &quot;shōen&quot; they held. Those people who worked the land found it advantageous to transfer title to &quot;shōen&quot; holders in return for a share of the harvest. People and lands were increasingly beyond central control and taxation, a &quot;de facto&quot; return to conditions before the Taika Reform.

Within decades of Daigo&#x27;s death, the Fujiwara had absolute control over the court. By the year 1000, Fujiwara no Michinaga was able to enthrone and dethrone emperors at will. Little authority was left for traditional institutions, and government affairs were handled through the Fujiwara clan&#x27;s private administration. The Fujiwara had become what historian George B. Sansom has called &quot;hereditary dictators&quot;.

Despite their usurpation of imperial authority, the Fujiwara presided over a period of cultural and artistic flowering at the imperial court and among the aristocracy. There was great interest in graceful poetry and vernacular literature. Two types of phonetic Japanese script: katakana, a simplified script that was developed by using parts of Chinese characters, was abbreviated to hiragana, a cursive syllabary with a distinct writing method that was uniquely Japanese. Hiragana gave written expression to the spoken word and, with it, to the rise in Japan&#x27;s famous vernacular literature, much of it written by court women who had not been trained in Chinese as had their male counterparts. Three late-tenth-century and early-11th-century women presented their views of life and romance at the Heian court in &quot;Kagerō Nikki&quot; by &quot;the mother of Fujiwara Michitsuna&quot;, &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; by Sei Shōnagon and &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; by Murasaki Shikibu. Indigenous art also flourished under the Fujiwara after centuries of imitating Chinese forms. Vividly colored yamato-e, Japanese style paintings of court life and stories about temples and shrines became common in the mid-to-late Heian period, setting patterns for Japanese art to this day.

As culture flourished, so did decentralization. Whereas the first phase of &quot;shōen&quot; development in the early Heian period had seen the opening of new lands and the granting of the use of lands to aristocrats and religious institutions, the second phase saw the growth of patrimonial &quot;house governments&quot;, as in the old clan system. In fact, the form of the old clan system had remained largely intact within the great old centralized government. New institutions were now needed in the face of social, economic, and political changes. The Taihō Code lapsed, its institutions relegated to ceremonial functions. Family administrations now became public institutions. As the most powerful family, the Fujiwara governed Japan and determined the general affairs of state, such as succession to the throne. Family and state affairs were thoroughly intermixed, a pattern followed among other families, monasteries, and even the imperial family. Land management became the primary occupation of the aristocracy, not so much because direct control by the imperial family or central government had declined but more from strong family solidarity and a lack of a sense of Japan as a single nation.

===Rise of the military class===
Under the early courts, when military conscription had been centrally controlled, military affairs had been taken out of the hands of the provincial aristocracy. But as the system broke down after 792, local power holders again became the primary source of military strength. The re-establishment of an efficient military system was made gradually through a process of trial-and-error. At that time the imperial court did not possess an army but rather relied on an organization of professional warriors composed mainly of oryoshi, which were appointed to an individual province and tsuibushi, which were appointed over imperial circuits or for specific tasks. This gave rise to the Japanese military class. Nonetheless, final authority rested with the imperial court.

&quot;Shōen&quot; holders had access to manpower and, as they obtained improved military technology (such as new training methods, more powerful bows, armor, horses, and superior swords) and faced worsening local conditions in the ninth century, military service became part of &quot;shōen&quot; life. Not only the &quot;shōen&quot; but also civil and religious institutions formed private guard units to protect themselves. Gradually, the provincial upper class was transformed into a new military elite of samurai.

Bushi interests were diverse, cutting across old power structures to form new associations in the tenth century. Mutual interests, family connections, and kinship were consolidated in military groups that became part of family administration. In time, large regional military families formed around members of the court aristocracy who had become prominent provincial figures. These military families gained prestige from connections to the imperial court and court-granted military titles and access to manpower. The Fujiwara family, Taira clan, and Minamoto clan were among the most prominent families supported by the new military class.

A decline in food production, the growth of the population, and competition for resources among the great families all led to the gradual decline of Fujiwara power and gave rise to military disturbances in the mid-tenth and eleventh centuries. Members of the Fujiwara, Taira, and Minamoto families—all of whom had descended from the imperial family—attacked one another, claimed control over vast tracts of conquered land, set up rival regimes, and generally upset the peace.

The Fujiwara controlled the throne until the reign of Emperor Go-Sanjō (1068–1073), the first emperor not born of a Fujiwara mother since the ninth century. Go-Sanjo, determined to restore imperial control through strong personal rule, implemented reforms to curb Fujiwara influence. He also established an office to compile and validate estate records with the aim of reasserting central control. Many &quot;shōen&quot; were not properly certified, and large landholders, like the Fujiwara, felt threatened with the loss of their lands. Go-Sanjo also established the ( &quot;Office of the Cloistered Emperor&quot;), which was held by a succession of emperors who abdicated to devote themselves to behind-the-scenes governance, or &quot;insei&quot;.

The &quot;In-no-chō&quot; filled the void left by the decline of Fujiwara power. Rather than being banished, the Fujiwara were mostly retained in their old positions of civil dictator and minister of the center while being bypassed in decision making. In time, many of the Fujiwara were replaced, mostly by members of the rising Minamoto clan. While the Fujiwara fell into disputes among themselves and formed northern and southern factions, the &quot;insei&quot; system allowed the paternal line of the imperial family to gain influence over the throne. The period from 1086 to 1156 was the age of supremacy of the &quot;In-no-chō&quot; and of the rise of the military class throughout the country. Military might rather than civil authority dominated the government.
A struggle for succession in the mid-twelfth century gave the Fujiwara an opportunity to regain their former power. Fujiwara no Yorinaga sided with the retired emperor in a violent battle in 1156 against the heir apparent, who was supported by the Taira and Minamoto (Hōgen Rebellion). In the end, the Fujiwara were destroyed, the old system of government supplanted, and the &quot;insei&quot; system left powerless as bushi took control of court affairs, marking a turning point in Japanese history. In 1159, the Taira and Minamoto clashed (Heiji Rebellion), and a twenty-year period of Taira ascendancy began.

Taira no Kiyomori emerged as the real power in Japan following the Fujiwara&#x27;s destruction, and he would remain in command for the next 20 years. He gave his daughter Tokuko in marriage to the young emperor Takakura, who died at only 19, leaving their infant son Antoku to succeed to the throne. Kiyomori filled no less than 50 government posts with his relatives, rebuilt the Inland Sea, and encouraged trade with Song China. He also took aggressive actions to safeguard his power when necessary, including the removal and exile of 45 court officials and the razing of two troublesome temples, Todai-ji and Kofuku-ji.

The Taira were seduced by court life and ignored problems in the provinces, where the Minamoto clan were rebuilding their strength. In 1183, two years after Kiyomori&#x27;s death, Yoritomo Minamoto dispatched his brothers Yoshitsune and Noriyori to attack Kyoto. The Taira were routed and forced to flee, and the Empress Dowager tried to drown herself and the 6-year old Emperor. He perished, but his mother survived. Takakura&#x27;s other son succeeded as Emperor Go-Toba.

With Yoritomo firmly established, the &quot;bakufu&quot; system that governed Japan for the next seven centuries was in place. He appointed military governors, or &quot;shugo&quot;, to rule over the provinces, and stewards, or &quot;jito&quot; to supervise public and private estates. Yoritomo then turned his attention to the elimination of the powerful Fujiwara family, which sheltered his rebellious brother Yoshitsune. Three years later, he was appointed &quot;shōgun&quot; in Kyoto. One year before his death in 1199, Yoritomo expelled the teenaged emperor Go-Toba from the throne. Two of Go-Toba&#x27;s sons succeeded him, but they would also be removed by Yoritomo&#x27;s successors to the shogunate.

==Culture==
===Developments in Buddhism===


The Heian period saw the rise of two esoteric Buddhist sects, Tendai and Shingon.

Tendai is the Japanese version of the Tiantai school from China, which is based on the Lotus Sutra, one of the most important sutras in Mahayana Buddhism. It was brought to Japan by the monk Saichō. An important element of Tendai doctrine was the suggestion that enlightenment was accessible to &quot;every creature&quot;. Saichō also sought independent ordination for Tendai monks. A close relationship developed between the Tendai monastery complex on Mount Hiei and the imperial court in its new capital at the foot of the mountain. As a result, Tendai emphasized great reverence for the emperor and the nation. Emperor Kammu himself was a notable patron of the otherworldly Tendai sect, which rose to great power over the ensuing centuries.

Shingon is the Japanese version of the Zhenyen school from China, which is based on Vajrayana Buddhism. It was brought to Japan by the monk Kūkai. Shingon Buddhism emphasizes the use of symbols, rituals, incantations and mandalas, which gave it a wide appeal. Kūkai greatly impressed the emperors who succeeded Emperor Kammu, and also generations of Japanese, not only with his holiness but also with his poetry, calligraphy, painting, and sculpture. Both Kūkai and Saichō aimed to connect state and religion and establish support from the aristocracy, leading to the notion of &quot;aristocratic Buddhism&quot;.

===Literature===
Although written Chinese (&quot;kanbun&quot;) remained the official language of the Heian period imperial court, the introduction and widespread use of kana saw a boom in Japanese literature. Despite the establishment of several new literary genres such as the novel and narrative &quot;monogatari&quot; (物語) and essays, literacy was only common among the court and Buddhist clergy.

Poetry, in particular, was a staple of court life. Nobles and ladies-in-waiting were expected to be well versed in the art of writing poetry as a mark of their status. Every occasion could call for the writing of a verse, from the birth of a child to the coronation of an emperor, or even a pretty scene of nature. A well-written poem could easily make or break one&#x27;s reputation, and often was a key part of social interaction. Almost as important was the choice of calligraphy, or handwriting, used. The Japanese of this period believed handwriting could reflect the condition of a person&#x27;s soul: therefore, poor or hasty writing could be considered a sign of poor breeding. Whether the script was Chinese or Japanese, good writing and artistic skill were paramount to social reputation when it came to poetry. Sei Shōnagon mentions in her &quot;Pillow Book&quot; that when a certain courtier tried to ask her advice about how to write a poem to the Empress Sadako, she had to politely rebuke him because his writing was so poor.

The lyrics of the modern Japanese national anthem, &quot;Kimigayo&quot;, were written in the Heian period, as was &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; by Murasaki Shikibu, which was extremely important to the Heian court, and one of the first novels ever written. Murasaki Shikibu&#x27;s contemporary and rival Sei Shōnagon&#x27;s revealing observations and musings as an attendant in the Empress&#x27; court were recorded collectively as &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; in the 990s, which revealed the quotidian capital lifestyle. The Heian period produced a flowering of poetry including works of Ariwara no Narihira, Ono no Komachi, Izumi Shikibu, Murasaki Shikibu, Saigyō and Fujiwara no Teika. The famous Japanese poem known as the Iroha (いろは), of uncertain authorship, was also written during the Heian period.

===Beauty===
During the Heian period, beauty was widely considered an important part of what made one a &quot;good&quot; person. In cosmetic terms, aristocratic men and women powdered their faces and blackened their teeth, the latter termed &quot;ohaguro&quot;. The male courtly ideal included a faint mustache and thin goatee, while women&#x27;s mouths were painted small and red, and their eyebrows were plucked or shaved and redrawn higher on the forehead (&quot;hikimayu&quot;).

Women cultivated shiny, black flowing hair and a courtly woman&#x27;s formal dress included a complex &quot;twelve-layered robe&quot; called &quot;jūnihitoe&quot;, though the actual number of layers varied. Costumes were determined by office and season, with a woman&#x27;s robes, in particular, following a system of color combinations representing flowers, plants, and animals specific to a season or month, (see the Japanese Wikipedia entries &quot;irome&quot; and &quot;kasane-no-irome&quot;).

==Economics==
While the Heian period was an unusually long period of peace, it can also be argued that the period weakened Japan economically and led to poverty for all but a tiny few of its inhabitants. The control of rice fields provided a key source of income for families such as the Fujiwara and was a fundamental base of their power. The aristocratic beneficiaries of Heian culture, the &quot;Ryōmin&quot; (良民 &quot;Good People&quot;) numbered about 5,000 in a land of perhaps five million. One reason the samurai were able to take power was that the ruling nobility proved incompetent at managing Japan and its provinces. By the year 1000, the government no longer knew how to issue currency and money was gradually disappearing. Instead of a fully realized system of money circulation, rice was the primary unit of exchange. The lack of a solid medium of economic exchange is implicitly illustrated in novels of the time. For instance, messengers were rewarded with useful objects such as an old silk kimono, rather than being paid a monetary fee.

The Fujiwara rulers failed to maintain adequate police forces, which left robbers free to prey on travelers. This is implicitly illustrated in novels by the terror that night travel inspired in the main characters. The shōen system enabled the accumulation of wealth by an aristocratic elite; the economic surplus can be linked to the cultural developments of the Heian period and the &quot;pursuit of arts&quot;. The major Buddhist temples in Heian-kyō and Nara also made use of the shōen. The establishment of branches rurally and integration of some Shinto shrines within these temple networks reflects a greater &quot;organizational dynamism&quot;.

==Modern depictions==
The iconography of the Heian period is widely known in Japan, and depicted in various media, from traditional festivals to anime. Various festivals feature Heian dress – most notably Hinamatsuri (doll festival), where the dolls wear Heian dress, but also numerous other festivals, such as Aoi Matsuri in Kyoto (May) and Saiō Matsuri in Meiwa, Mie (June), both of which feature the jūnihitoe 12-layer dress. Traditional horseback archery (yabusame) festivals, which date from the beginning of the Kamakura period (immediately following the Heian period) feature similar dress.

===Video games===
* &quot;Cosmology of Kyoto&quot; is a 1993 Japanese video game set in 10th–11th-century Japan. It is a point-and-click adventure game depicting Heian-kyō, including the religious beliefs, folklore, and ghost tales of the time.
* &quot;Kuon&quot; is a 2004 survival horror game for the PS2 set in the Heian period.
* The 2011 video game &quot;Total War: Shogun 2&quot; has the &quot;Rise of the Samurai&quot; expansion pack as a downloadable campaign. It allows the player to make their own version of the Genpei War which happened during the Heian period. The player is able to choose one of the most powerful families of Japan at the time, the Taira, Minamoto or Fujiwara.
* &quot;Nioh 2&quot;, a 2020 video game, released three DLC expansions that had its main protagonist time travel to key moments in the Heian period to aid Minamoto no Yoshitsune and Minamoto no Yorimitsu.
* &quot;Plants Vs. Zombies 2&quot;, specifically the Chinese Version of the game released in 2015, has a world based on the Heian Period called the &quot;Heian Age&quot; that was released in January 2021.

<doc id="154725" wikidata="Q869887" url="?curid=154725" title="Probability mass function">
<text>In probability and statistics, a probability mass function (sometimes called &quot;probability function&quot; or &quot;frequency function&quot;) is a function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value. Sometimes it is also known as the discrete probability density function. The probability mass function is often the primary means of defining a discrete probability distribution, and such functions exist for either scalar or multivariate random variables whose domain is discrete.

A probability mass function differs from a probability density function (PDF) in that the latter is associated with continuous rather than discrete random variables. A PDF must be integrated over an interval to yield a probability.

The value of the random variable having the largest probability mass is called the mode.

==Formal definition==
Probability mass function is the probability distribution of a discrete random variable, and provides the possible values and their associated probabilities. It is the function formula_1 defined by
for formula_2, where formula_3 is a probability measure. formula_4 can also be simplified as formula_5.

The probabilities associated with all (hypothetical) values must be non-negative and sum up to 1,

formula_6 and formula_7

Thinking of probability as mass helps to avoid mistakes since the physical mass is conserved as is the total probability for all hypothetical outcomes formula_8.

==Measure theoretic formulation==
A probability mass function of a discrete random variable formula_9 can be seen as a special case of two more general measure theoretic constructions: 
the distribution of formula_9 and the probability density function of formula_9 with respect to the counting measure. We make this more precise below.

Suppose that formula_12 is a probability space
and that formula_13 is a measurable space whose underlying σ-algebra is discrete, so in particular contains singleton sets of formula_14. In this setting, a random variable formula_15 is discrete provided its image is countable.
The pushforward measure formula_16—called the distribution of formula_9 in this context—is a probability measure on formula_14 whose restriction to singleton sets induces the probability mass function (as mentioned in the previous section) formula_19 since formula_20 for each formula_21.

Now suppose that formula_22 is a measure space equipped with the counting measure formula_23. The probability density function formula_24 of formula_9 with respect to the counting measure, if it exists, is the Radon–Nikodym derivative of the pushforward measure of formula_9 (with respect to the counting measure), so formula_27 and formula_24 is a function from formula_14 to the non-negative reals. As a consequence, for any formula_21 we have
formula_31

demonstrating that formula_24 is in fact a probability mass function.

When there is a natural order among the potential outcomes formula_8, it may be convenient to assign numerical values to them (or &quot;n&quot;-tuples in case of a discrete multivariate random variable) and to consider also values not in the image of formula_9. That is, formula_35 may be defined for all real numbers and formula_36 for all formula_37 as shown in the figure.

The image of formula_9 has a countable subset on which the probability mass function formula_39 is one. Consequently, the probability mass function is zero for all but a countable number of values of formula_8.

The discontinuity of probability mass functions is related to the fact that the cumulative distribution function of a discrete random variable is also discontinuous. If formula_9 is a discrete random variable, then formula_42 means that the casual event formula_43 is certain (it is true in 100% of the occurrences); on the contrary, formula_44 means that the casual event formula_43 is always impossible. This statement isn&#x27;t true for a continuous random variable formula_9, for which formula_44 for any possible formula_8. Discretization is the process of converting a continuous random variable into a discrete one.

==Examples==
===Finite===
There are three major distributions associated, the Bernoulli distribution, the binomial distribution and the geometric distribution.

*Bernoulli distribution: ber(p) , is used to model an experiment with only two possible outcomes. The two outcomes are often encoded as 1 and 0. formula_49 An example of the Bernoulli distribution is tossing a coin. Suppose that formula_50 is the sample space of all outcomes of a single toss of a fair coin, and formula_9 is the random variable defined on formula_50 assigning 0 to the category &quot;tails&quot; and 1 to the category &quot;heads&quot;. Since the coin is fair, the probability mass function is formula_53
* Binomial distribution, models the number of successes when someone draws n times with replacement. Each draw or experiment is independent, with two possible outcomes. The associated probability mass function is formula_54. An example of the binomial distribution is the probability of getting exactly one 6 when someone rolls a fair die three times.
* Geometric distribution describes the number of trials needed to get one success. Its probability mass function is formula_55.An example is tossing a coin until the first &quot;heads&quot; appears. formula_56 denotes the probability of the outcome &quot;heads&quot;, and formula_57 denotes the number of necessary coin tosses. Other distributions that can be modeled using a probability mass function are the categorical distribution (also known as the generalized Bernoulli distribution) and the multinomial distribution. 
* If the discrete distribution has two or more categories one of which may occur, whether or not these categories have a natural ordering, when there is only a single trial (draw) this is a categorical distribution.
* An example of a multivariate discrete distribution, and of its probability mass function, is provided by the multinomial distribution. Here the multiple random variables are the numbers of successes in each of the categories after a given number of trials, and each non-zero probability mass gives the probability of a certain combination of numbers of successes in the various categories.
===Infinite===
The following exponentially declining distribution is an example of a distribution with an infinite number of possible outcomes—all the positive integers: formula_58 Despite the infinite number of possible outcomes, the total probability mass is 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ⋯ = 1, satisfying the unit total probability requirement for a probability distribution.

==Multivariate case==
Two or more discrete random variables have a joint probability mass function, which gives the probability of each possible combination of realizations for the random variables.

<doc id="154726" wikidata="Q316183" url="?curid=154726" title="Pete Maravich">
<text>Peter Press Maravich ( ; June 22, 1947 – January 5, 1988), known by his nickname Pistol Pete, was an American professional basketball player. He starred in college at Louisiana State University&#x27;s Tigers basketball team; his father, Press Maravich, was the team&#x27;s head coach. Maravich is the all-time leading NCAA Division I men&#x27;s scorer with 3,667 points scored and an average of 44.2 points per game. All of his accomplishments were achieved before the adoption of the three-point line and shot clock, and despite being unable to play varsity as a freshman under then-NCAA rules.

Maravich was selected by the Atlanta Hawks in the 1970 NBA draft, playing four seasons for the team. He was traded to the New Orleans Jazz, then an expansion team, with whom he spent the majority of the rest of his career. His final season was split between the Jazz and the Boston Celtics. Injuries ultimately forced Maravich&#x27;s retirement in 1980 following a 10-year professional basketball career. He was named an All-Star five times and was named to four All-NBA Teams during his professional career.

One of the youngest players ever inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Maravich was considered to be one of the greatest creative offensive talents ever and one of the best ball handlers of all time. He died suddenly at age 40 during a pick-up game in 1988 as a consequence of an undetected heart defect. Maravich was named to the NBA&#x27;s 50th Anniversary team in 1996 and 75th Anniversary team in 2021.

==Early life==
Maravich was born to Petar &quot;Press&quot; Maravich (1915–1987) and Helen Gravor Maravich (1925–1974) in Aliquippa, a steel town in Beaver County in western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. Maravich amazed his family and friends with his basketball abilities from an early age. He enjoyed a close but demanding father-son relationship that motivated him toward achievement and fame in the sport. Maravich&#x27;s father was the son of Serbian immigrants and a professional player–turned-coach. He showed his son the fundamentals starting when Pete was seven years old. Obsessively, young Maravich spent hours practicing ball control tricks, passes, head fakes, and long-range shots.

Maravich played high school varsity ball at Daniel High School in Central, South Carolina, a year before being old enough to attend the school. While at Daniel from 1961 to 1963, Maravich participated in the school&#x27;s first-ever game against a team from an all-black school. In 1963, his father departed from his position as head basketball coach at Clemson University and joined the coaching staff at North Carolina State University. While living in Raleigh, North Carolina, Maravich attended Needham B. Broughton High School, where his famous moniker was born. From his habit of shooting the ball from his side, as if holding a revolver, Maravich became known as &quot;Pistol&quot; Pete Maravich. He graduated from Broughton in 1965 and then attended Edwards Military Institute, where he averaged 33 points per game. Press Maravich was known to be extremely protective of Maravich, and would guard against any issue that might come up during his adolescence; Press threatened to shoot Maravich with a .45-caliber pistol if he drank or got into trouble. Maravich was 6 feet 4 inches in high school and was getting ready to play in college when his father took a coaching position at Louisiana State University.

==College career==
At that time, NCAA rules prohibited first-year students from playing at varsity level, which required Maravich to play on the freshman team. In his first game, Maravich put up 50 points, 14 rebounds, and 11 assists against Southeastern Louisiana College.
In only three years playing on the varsity team (and under his father&#x27;s coaching) at LSU, Maravich scored 3,667 points—1,138 of those in 1967–68, 1,148 in 1968–69, and 1,381 in 1969–70—while averaging 43.8, 44.2, and 44.5 points per game, respectively. For his collegiate career, the guard averaged 44.2 points per game in 83 contests and led the NCAA in scoring for each of his three seasons.

Maravich&#x27;s long-standing collegiate scoring record is particularly notable when three factors are taken into account:

*First, because of the NCAA rules that prohibited him from taking part in varsity competition during his first year as a student, Maravich was prevented from adding to his career record for a full quarter of his time at LSU. During this first year, Maravich scored 741 points in freshman competition.
*Second, Maravich played before the advent of the three-point line. This significant difference has raised speculation regarding just how much higher his records would be, given his long-range shooting ability and how such a component might have altered his play. Writing for ESPN.com, Bob Carter stated, &quot;Though Maravich played before [...] the 3-point shot was established, he loved gunning from long range.&quot; It has been reported that former LSU coach Dale Brown charted every shot Maravich scored and concluded that, if his shots from three-point range had been counted as three points, Maravich&#x27;s average would have totaled 57 points per game and 12 three-pointers per game. 
*Third, the shot clock had also not yet been instituted in NCAA play during Maravich&#x27;s college career. (A time limit on ball possession speeds up play, mandates an additional number of field goal attempts, eliminates stalling, and increases the number of possessions throughout the game, all resulting in higher overall scoring.)

More than 50 years later, however, many of his NCAA and LSU records still stand. Maravich was a three-time All-American. Though he never appeared in the NCAA tournament, Maravich played a key role in turning around a lackluster program that had posted a 3–20 record in the season prior to his arrival. Maravich finished his college career in the 1970 National Invitation Tournament, where LSU finished fourth.

==Professional basketball career==
===Atlanta Hawks===

The Atlanta Hawks selected Maravich with the third pick in the first round of the 1970 NBA draft, where he played for coach Richie Guerin. He was not a natural fit in Atlanta. The Hawks already boasted a top-notch scorer at the guard position in combo guard Lou Hudson. In fact, Maravich&#x27;s flamboyant style stood in stark contrast to the conservative play of Hudson and star center Walt Bellamy. It also did not help that many of the veteran players resented the $1.9 million contract that Maravich received from the team—a very large salary at that time.

Maravich appeared in 81 games and averaged 23.2 points per contest—good enough to earn NBA All-Rookie Team honors. He managed to blend his style with his teammates, so much so that Hudson set a career high by scoring 26.8 points per game. But the team stumbled to a 36–46 record—12 wins fewer than in the previous season. Still, the Hawks qualified for the playoffs, where they lost to the New York Knicks during the first round, as Maravich averaged 22 points a contest in the five-game series.

Maravich struggled somewhat during his second season. His scoring average dipped to 19.3 points per game, and the Hawks finished with another disappointing 36–46 record. Once again they qualified for the playoffs, and once again they were eliminated in the first round. However, Atlanta fought hard against the Boston Celtics, with Maravich averaging 27.7 points in the series.

Maravich erupted in his third season, averaging 26.1 points (fifth in the NBA) and dishing out 6.9 assists per game (sixth in the NBA). With 2,063 points, he combined with Hudson (2,029 points) to become only the second set of teammates in league history to each score over 2,000 points in a single season. The Hawks soared to a 46–36 record, but again bowed out in the first round of the playoffs. However, the season was good enough to earn Maravich his first-ever appearance in the NBA All-Star Game, and also All-NBA Second Team honors.

The following season (1973–74) was his best yet—at least in terms of individual accomplishments. Maravich posted 27.7 points per game—second in the league behind Bob McAdoo—and earned his second appearance in the All-Star Game, where he would start for the Eastern Conference and score 15 points. However, Atlanta sank to a disappointing 35–47 record and missed the postseason entirely. By this point, he and head coach Cotton Fitzsimmons did not get along, with the latter giving him a two game suspension at one point.

===New Orleans Jazz===
In the summer of 1974, the expansion New Orleans Jazz franchise was preparing for its first season of competition in the NBA and was looking to generate excitement among its new basketball fans. With his exciting style of play, Maravich was seen as the perfect man for the job. Additionally, he was already a celebrity in the state due to his accomplishments at LSU. To acquire Maravich, the Jazz traded two players and four draft picks to Atlanta.

The expansion team struggled mightily in its first season. Maravich managed to score 21.5 points per game, but shot a career-worst 41.9% from the floor. The Jazz posted a 23–59 record, worst in the NBA.

Jazz management did its best to give Maravich a better supporting cast. The team posted a 38–44 record in its second season (1975–76), but did not qualify for postseason play despite the dramatic improvement. Maravich struggled with injuries that limited him to just 62 games that season, but he averaged 25.9 points per contest (third behind McAdoo and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) and continued his crowd-pleasing antics. He was elected to the All-NBA First Team that year.

The following season (1976–77) was his most productive in the NBA. He led the league in scoring with an average of 31.1 points per game. He scored 40 points or more in 13 games, and 50 or more in four games. His 68-point masterpiece against the Knicks was at the time the most points ever scored by a guard in a single game, and only two players at any position had ever scored more: Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor. Coincidentally, Baylor was head coach of the Jazz at that time. Despite Maravich&#x27;s performance, the team finished at 35–47 (three wins shy of the previous season) and once again failed to make the playoffs.

Maravich earned his third All-Star game appearance and was honored as All-NBA First Team for the second consecutive season.

Injuries to both knees forced him to miss 32 games during the 1977–78 season. Despite being robbed of some quickness and athleticism, he still managed to score 27.0 points per game, and he also added 6.7 assists per contest, his highest average as a member of the Jazz. Many of those assists went to new teammate Truck Robinson, who had joined the franchise as a free agent during the off season. In Robinson&#x27;s first year in New Orleans, Robinson averaged 22.7 points and a league-best 15.7 rebounds per game. Robinson&#x27;s presence prevented opponents from focusing their defensive efforts entirely on Maravich, and it lifted the Jazz to a 39–43 record—just short of making the club&#x27;s first appearance in the playoffs.

Knee problems plagued Maravich for the rest of his career. He played in just 49 games during the 1978–79 season. He scored 22.6 points per game that season and earned his fifth and final All-Star appearance, but his scoring and passing abilities were severely impaired. The team struggled on the court, and faced serious financial trouble, as well. Management became desperate to make some changes. The Jazz traded Robinson to the Phoenix Suns, receiving draft picks and some cash in return. However, in 1979, team owner Sam Battistone moved the Jazz to Salt Lake City.

===Final season===
The Utah Jazz began play in the 1979–80 season. Maravich moved with the team to Salt Lake City, but his knee problems were worse than ever. He appeared in 17 games early in the season, but his injuries prevented him from practicing much, and new coach Tom Nissalke had a strict rule that players who did not practice were not allowed to play in games. Thus, Maravich was parked on the bench for 24 straight games, much to the dismay of Utah fans and to Maravich himself. During that time, Adrian Dantley emerged as the team&#x27;s franchise player.

The Jazz placed Maravich on waivers in January 1980. He signed with the Celtics, the top team in the league that year, led by rookie superstar Larry Bird. Maravich adjusted to a new role as part-time contributor, giving Boston a &quot;hired gun&quot; on offense off the bench. He helped the team post a 61–21 record in the regular season, the best in the league, and for the first time since his early career in Atlanta, Maravich was able to participate in the NBA playoffs. He appeared in nine games during that postseason, but the Celtics were upended by Julius Erving and the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference finals, four games to one.

Realizing that his knee problems would never go away, Maravich retired at the end of that season. The NBA instituted the three-point shot just in time for Maravich&#x27;s last season in the league. He had always been famous for his long-range shooting, and though injury-dampened, his final year provided an official statistical gauge of his abilities. Between his limited playing time in Utah and Boston, he made 10 of 15 three-point shots, giving him a career 66.7% completion rate.

During his 10-year career in the NBA, Maravich played in 658 games, averaging 24.2 points and 5.4 assists per contest. In 1987, he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and his number- jersey has been retired by both the Jazz and the New Orleans Pelicans, as well as his number-44 jersey by the Atlanta Hawks. In 2021, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary, &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Maravich as the 73rd-greatest player in NBA history.

==Later life and death==

After injuries forced his retirement from the game in 1980, Maravich became a recluse for two years. Through it all, Maravich said he was searching &quot;for life&quot;. He tried the practices of yoga and Hinduism, read Trappist monk Thomas Merton&#x27;s &quot;The Seven Storey Mountain&quot; and took an interest in the field of ufology, the study of unidentified flying objects. He also explored vegetarianism and macrobiotics, adopting a vegetarian diet in 1982.

Eventually, he became a born-again Christian, embracing evangelical Christianity. A few years before his death, Maravich said, &quot;I want to be remembered as a Christian, a person that serves [Jesus] to the utmost, not as a basketball player.&quot;

On January 5, 1988, Maravich collapsed and died of heart failure at age 40, while playing in a pickup basketball game in the gym at First Church of the Nazarene in Pasadena, California, with a group that included evangelical author James Dobson. Maravich had flown out from his home in Covington, Louisiana, to tape a segment for Dobson&#x27;s radio show that aired later that day. Dobson has said that Maravich&#x27;s last words, less than a minute before he died, were &quot;I feel great.&quot;

An autopsy revealed the cause of death to be a rare congenital defect: his left coronary artery, a vessel that supplies blood to the muscle fibers of the heart, was missing. His right coronary artery was grossly enlarged and had been compensating for the defect.

Maravich was survived by his wife, Jackie, and their sons Jaeson, then 8 years old, and Josh, then 5 years old.

Maravich&#x27;s children were very young when he died, and Jackie Maravich (also known as Jackie McLachlan) initially shielded them from unwanted media attention, not even allowing Jaeson and Josh to attend their father&#x27;s funeral. His sons still developed a love for the game, though. During a 2003 interview, Jaeson told &quot;USA Today&quot; that, when he was still only a toddler, &quot;My dad passed me a (Nerf) basketball, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since ... My dad said I shot and missed, and I got mad and I kept shooting. He said his dad told him he did the same thing.&quot;

Despite some setbacks coping with their father&#x27;s death and without the benefit that his tutelage might have provided, both sons eventually were inspired to play high-school and collegiate basketball—Josh at his father&#x27;s alma mater, LSU.

On June 7, 2024, Josh Maravich died in the family home in Covington, Louisiana, at 42 years old.

==Legacy==
On June 27, 2014, Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal proposed that LSU erect a statue of Maravich outside the Pete Maravich Assembly Center. Jackie McLachlan said that she had been promised a statue after the passing of her husband. Others opposed a Maravich statue because he had fallen a few credits short of graduation, so did not meet the requirements for monuments to student-athletes. Magic Johnson admitted to taking the &quot;Showtime&quot; name from Maravich, as well as studying all his moves. Meanwhile, Bob Dylan wrote of idolizing Pete Maravich when he was playing for New Orleans.

In February 2016, the LSU Athletic Hall of Fame Committee unanimously approved a proposal that a statue honoring Maravich be installed on the campus, revising the stipulations required. On July 25, 2022, the statue was unveiled to the public outside of the Assembly Center.

===Memorabilia===
Maravich&#x27;s untimely death and mystique have made memorabilia associated with him among the most highly prized of any basketball collectibles. Game-used Maravich jerseys bring more money at auction than similar items from anybody other than George Mikan, with the most common items selling for $10,000 and up and a game-used LSU jersey selling for $94,300 in a 2001 Grey Flannel auction. The signed game ball from his career-high 68-point night on February 25, 1977, sold for $131,450 in a 2009 Heritage auction.

I hadn’t forgotten about him, though. Some people seem to fade away, but then when they are truly gone, it’s like they didn’t fade away at all.&quot; Dylan then remembers that it was in the early afternoon, when news of Maravich&#x27;s death began to wear away, that he started writing a new song called &quot;Dignity.&quot; Though it would remain unreleased for several years, many would regard it as one of Dylan&#x27;s greatest compositions from that era.

<text>Michael Whitaker Smith (born October 7, 1957) is an American musician who has charted in both contemporary Christian and mainstream charts. His biggest success in mainstream music was in 1991 when &quot;Place in This World&quot; hit No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Over the course of his career, he has sold more than 18 million albums.

Smith is a three-time Grammy Award winner, an American Music Award recipient, and has earned 45 Dove Awards. In 1999, ASCAP awarded him with the &quot;Golden Note&quot; Award for lifetime achievement in songwriting, and in 2014 they honored him as the &quot;cornerstone of Christian music&quot; for his significant influence on the genre. He also has recorded 31 No. 1 Hit songs, fourteen gold albums, and five platinum albums. He has also starred in two films and published 14 books including &quot;This Is Your Time&quot;, which he worked with Christian author Gary Thomas to write.

== Early life ==

Michael Whitaker Smith was born to Paul and Barbara Smith in Kenova, West Virginia. His father was an oil refinery worker at the Ashland Oil Refinery, in nearby Catlettsburg, Kentucky. His mother was a caterer. He inherited his love of baseball from his father, who had played in the minor leagues. As a child, he developed a love of music through his church. He learned piano at an early age and sang in his church choir. At the age of 10, he had &quot;an intense spiritual experience&quot; that led to his becoming a devout Christian. &quot;I wore this big cross around my neck,&quot; he would recall, &quot;It was very real to me.&quot; He became involved in Bible study and found a group of older friends who shared his faith.

After his older Christian friends moved away to college, Smith began to struggle with feelings of loneliness and alienation. After graduating from high school, he gravitated toward alcohol and drugs. He attended Marshall University while developing his songwriting skills but dropped out after one semester. He also played with various local bands around Huntington, West Virginia. During that time, his friend Shane Keister, who worked as a session musician in Nashville, encouraged him to move to Nashville, the Country Music capital, and pursue a career in music.

In 1978, Smith moved to Nashville, taking a job as a landscaper to support himself. He played with several local bands in the Nashville club scene. He also developed a problem with substance abuse.

After a breakdown in November 1979, Smith decided to recommit to Christianity. The next day he auditioned for a new contemporary Christian music (CCM) group, Higher Ground, as a keyboardist and got the job. His lead vocals were heard on much of CCM radio with the single, &quot;I Am&quot;. It was on his first tour with Higher Ground, playing mostly in churches, that Smith was finally able to put the drugs and alcohol behind him.

== Music career ==

=== Beginning (1981–1989) ===
In 1981, while he was playing keyboards for Higher Ground, Smith was signed as a writer to Meadowgreen Music, where he wrote numerous gospel hits penned for artists such as Sandi Patty, Kathy Troccoli, Bill Gaither and Amy Grant, to the effect that some of these popular worship songs can now be found in church hymnals. The following year, Smith began touring as a keyboardist for Grant on her &quot;Age to Age&quot; tour.

He became Grant&#x27;s opening act and recorded his first Grammy-nominated solo album &quot;The Michael W. Smith Project&quot; (which he also produced himself) in 1983 on the Reunion Records label. This album contained the first recording of his hit &quot;Friends&quot;, which he co-wrote with his wife Deborah. By the time Smith&#x27;s second album &quot;Michael W. Smith 2&quot; was released in 1984, he was headlining his own tours. In 1986, Smith released &quot;The Big Picture&quot;.

After the release of his 1988 effort, &quot;i 2 (EYE)&quot;, Smith once again collaborated with Grant for her &quot;Lead Me On&quot; world tour. The following year, Smith recorded his first Christmas album, simply titled &quot;Christmas&quot; (1989).

=== Mainstream venture and inspirational pop albums (1990–1999) ===
In 1990, Smith released &quot;Go West Young Man&quot;, his first mainstream effort, which included the mainstream crossover hit single &quot;Place in This World&quot;. The song peaked at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In 1992, he released &quot;Change Your World&quot;, which included the No. 1 adult contemporary hit &quot;I Will Be Here for You&quot;. In 1993 Smith released his first box set, &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; and his first greatest hits album, &quot;The First Decade (1983–1993)&quot;. The latter also includes two new songs, &quot;Do You Dream of Me?&quot; and &quot;Kentucky Rose&quot;.

In 1994, Smith appeared as a guest pianist on the album &quot;Swing, Swang, Swung&quot; by Christian rock band Guardian.

In 1995, Smith released his eighth album &quot;I&#x27;ll Lead You Home&quot;, which combines the pop style of his secular albums with a touch of religious feel. &quot;Live the Life&quot; (1998) and &quot;This Is Your Time&quot; (1999) follow the same style. In 1998, Smith also released his second Christmas album, &quot;Christmastime&quot;.

Smith collaborated with Jim Brickman on &quot;Love of My Life&quot;, a romantic love song for Brickman&#x27;s album &quot;Destiny&quot; in 1999. The song went to chart at No. 9 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks. Also in 1999, he became the first Christian artist to receive the ASCAP &quot;Golden Note&quot; Award for lifetime achievement in songwriting.

=== Instrumental and live worship albums (2000–2003) ===

Nearly all of Smith&#x27;s albums include at least one instrumental track, and in 2000 Smith recorded his first all instrumental album, &quot;Freedom&quot;. The following year, Smith released his first all-worship music album, &quot;Worship&quot;, on September 11. This album was followed by a sequel, &quot;Worship Again&quot; in 2002. Both albums were recorded live in concert. &quot;Worship Again&quot; also includes a song that Smith wrote called &quot;There She Stands&quot;, inspired by the September 11, 2001 attacks. He performed this song live for the 2004 Republican National Convention, saying that President George W. Bush, who he said is a fan and a family friend, had asked him to write a song about the attacks.

In 2002, Smith released a live concert DVD titled &quot;Worship&quot;, filmed live in Edmonton, Alberta at YC Alberta. The concert includes songs from both &quot;Worship&quot; (2001) and &quot;Worship Again&quot; (2002). It immediately topped the Billboard video charts and went gold in both the U.S. and Canada.

Smith won the Male Vocalist of the Year award at the GMA Music Awards in 2003. The same year he also released his second greatest hits album, &quot;The Second Decade (1993–2003)&quot;, which includes a new single called &quot;Signs&quot;.

=== Contemporary Christian albums (2004–2010) ===

Smith&#x27;s album, &quot;Healing Rain&quot;, was released in 2004 and debuted at No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 200 Chart. The title track rose to No. 1 on the Radio &amp; Records Charts and a music video for the song was released. The album combines the pop style of his previous recordings with the religious feel of his two live worship albums. It was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album. In 2006 he released &quot;Stand&quot;, which is similar to &quot;Healing Rain&quot; (2004) in style and genre but with more Christian-themed songs. Also in 2006, Smith did the score and soundtrack to the film &quot;The Second Chance&quot;, which he also starred in. He also released a single from the soundtrack album, &quot;All in the Serve&quot;.

In October 2007, he released his third Christmas album, &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Christmas&quot;. On June 20, 2008, Smith recorded his third live Worship album at the Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas, titled &quot;A New Hallelujah&quot;. It was released in October 2008. That same month he began a tour with Steven Curtis Chapman. In September 2010, he released &quot;Wonder&quot;, which follows the CCM style of &quot;Healing Rain&quot; (2004) and &quot;Stand&quot; (2006).

=== Orchestral instrumental, hymns, and studio worship albums (2011–2016) ===

Smith&#x27;s second instrumental album, &quot;Glory&quot;, was released on November 22, 2011. Unlike his first instrumental album, &quot;Freedom&quot; (2000), this album features a 65-piece orchestra recorded at AIR Studios Lyndhurst Hall in London and Wildwood Recording Studio in Nashville. The following year he released his third compilation album, &quot;Decades of Worship&quot; (2012).

Smith&#x27;s concert in Draper, Utah, on July 24, 2012 was almost canceled due to a complaint filed by a Utah resident on July 16, 2012. He claimed that a show &quot;conflated with prayer and worship&quot; should remain in church or private property, not in the &quot;public&#x27;s backyard&quot;. The following day the city council decided to cancel the concert, but a day later they decided to host the show as planned after all, following a criticism from a Utah evangelical group that equated cancelling the concert to an assault on religious liberty. The Mayor of Draper and several city council members were present at the event and were recognized for their support.
In 2014, Smith released three albums, &quot;Hymns&quot;, &quot;Sovereign&quot;, and &quot;The Spirit of Christmas&quot;. &quot;Hymns&quot; is Smith&#x27;s first effort at doing his own rendition of traditional hymns, and it was released exclusively at Cracker Barrel Old Country Store on March 24, 2014. The album sold 12,000 copies in its first week of release and debuted at No. 24 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was also the best-selling Christian music album for the week of April 19, 2014, and won a 2014 Dove Award for &quot;Inspirational Album of the Year&quot;. &quot;Sovereign&quot;, released on May 13, 2014, is his first studio worship album and his first album released through Capitol Records, after leaving his long-time label Reunion Records in 2013. The album sold almost 16,000 copies in its first week, and debuted at No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it the highest-charting album in his career as of 2014. &quot;The Spirit of Christmas&quot;, officially released as &quot;Michael W. Smith &amp; Friends: The Spirit of Christmas&quot;, is Smith&#x27;s first duet album. Released on September 30, 2014, it features duets with Carrie Underwood, Lady Antebellum, Little Big Town, Jennifer Nettles, Martina McBride, Vince Gill, Bono, Amy Grant, and Michael McDonald. The album marks Smith&#x27;s third new album in 2014 to enter the Billboard 200, peaking at No. 16 . It also won a 2015 Dove Award for &quot;Christmas Album of the Year&quot;.

Smith, along with Amy Grant, was honored as the &quot;cornerstone of Christian music&quot; by ASCAP in 2014 for his significant influence on the genre. In 2015, Smith and his son Tyler wrote the score and soundtrack for the film &quot;90 Minutes in Heaven&quot;, in which he also has a small acting role.

In November 2015, Smith and Amy Grant started their annual Christmas tour again after a roughly 15-year break.

Smith&#x27;s second hymns album, called &quot;Hymns II - Shine on Us&quot;, was released on January 29, 2016. Like his first hymns album released in 2014, the album was sold exclusively at Cracker Barrel Old Country Store.

On June 21, 2016, Smith released a new single titled &quot;He Will Never End&quot; which was originally released in March 2016 as a bonus track on the Target exclusive edition of &quot;The Passion: New Orleans&quot; soundtrack CD (2016). On June 27, 2016, he released the music video for the single which was filmed entirely in Israel in April 2016.

Later in 2016, Smith released a Christmas musical project in a collaboration with Wes King, Bradley Knight, and Luke Gambill called &quot;Almost There – A Christmas Musical&quot;. The musical is named after a song Smith wrote a few years ago for his Christmas album &quot;The Spirit of Christmas&quot; (2014).

=== &quot;A Million Lights&quot; and &quot;Surrounded&quot; (2017–present) ===

On August 11, 2017, Smith released a new single, &quot;A Million Lights&quot;, which marks a departure from his previous sound. It is the lead single and title track from his pop album released on February 16, 2018. A week after, on February 23, 2018, Smith released another album called &quot;Surrounded&quot; which is his first live worship album in ten years. The two albums became his 30th and 31st top 10 entries in &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Christian Albums chart, the most among solo artists in the span of his career.

In May 2018, Smith launched a new children&#x27;s book series, &quot;Nurturing Steps&quot;, which he created with VeggieTales co-creator Mike Nawrocki. The first book, &quot;Nighty Night and Good Night&quot;, was released May 8. He also released his first children&#x27;s album, &quot;Lullaby&quot;, to accompany the book.

On August 30, 2018, Smith hosted a free event at Nashville&#x27;s Bridgestone Arena called &quot;Surrounded: A Night to Pray, Worship and Be Awakened&quot;. The event will be broadcast on TBN later this year in 175 countries worldwide.

On February 22, 2019, Smith released &quot;Awaken: The Surrounded Experience&quot;, a live worship album.

Smith released a live album of worship music, &quot;Worship Forever&quot;, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of 9/11, which is also the date in which his original album &quot;Worship&quot; was released. It was also accompanied by a live concert on TBN.

In March 2024, Smith released his worship EP &quot;Worthy is the Lamb&quot; which was recorded at Belmont University.

== Acting career ==

In 1994, Smith made his acting debut as Billy Holden in &quot;Secret Adventures&quot;: &quot;Shrug&quot;. In 2006, Smith was the lead actor in &quot;The Second Chance&quot;, a film directed by Steve Taylor. He also did some of the score and soundtrack for this film.

In 2015, Smith starred as Cliff McArdle in the film adaptation of the best-selling book &quot;90 Minutes in Heaven&quot; by Don Piper. In addition, he collaborated with his son on the score and soundtrack for this film.

Smith also starred as James the disciple in &quot;The Passion&quot;, a live musical film that was aired on FOX on March 20, 2016.

== Other ventures ==

In 1994, Smith opened a teen club, named Rocketown, in Nashville, Tennessee (6th Avenue). Later in early 2003, the club was moved to a new location—a renovated warehouse in downtown Nashville. The venue offers a large dance floor, extensive indoor skate park, and a café hosting live acoustic music.

In 1996, Smith opened his own record label, Rocketown Records. The label was named after a song on his third album &quot;The Big Picture&quot;. The first artist signed was Chris Rice, who had written &quot;Go Light Your World&quot;, a No. 1 hit song by Kathy Troccoli, in 1995. Smith did not record under the label himself until 2018.

Smith is actively involved in volunteer service and is vice chair of the President&#x27;s Council on Service and Civic Participation, which is chaired by Jean Case of the Case Foundation. He is also an avid spokesperson for sponsoring children through Compassion International.

Smith was active in Billy Graham Crusades as well as Samaritan&#x27;s Purse. Smith sang &quot;Just As I Am&quot; in a tribute to Graham at the 44th GMA Dove Awards. He also sang it at the memorial service honoring Graham at the United States Capitol rotunda on February 28, 2018.

== Personal life ==

Smith is married to Deborah &quot;Debbie&quot; Kay Davis and has five children, including filmmaker Ryan Whitaker Smith.

He lives in the Nashville suburbs. Smith attended Belmont Church in Nashville, Tennessee, and is mentored by its long-time pastor, Don Finto. Smith is also the founding pastor of &quot;New River Fellowship Church&quot; in Franklin, Tennessee, where he was the lead pastor from 2006 to 2008.

Smith was a friend of former President George H. W. Bush and is a friend of his son, former President George W. Bush. Smith was invited to play at the 2004 Republican National Convention singing &quot;There She Stands&quot;, as well as the state funeral of George H. W. Bush at the National Cathedral in Washington, DC, on December 5, 2018, singing &quot;Friends&quot;.

Smith is also friends with U2 singer Bono and they have collaborated on a Christmas album as well as One Campaign.

Alderson-Broaddus College awarded Smith the degree Doctorate of Music &quot;honoris causa&quot; in 1992.

Smith was also named one of &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Most Beautiful People&quot; in 1992.

In 2018, he performed at Billy Graham&#x27;s memorial and funeral.

In June 2019, Smith signed a declaration by Franklin Graham calling for a special day of prayer for President Donald Trump, that God would protect, strengthen, embolden, and direct him.

In 2023, Smith asked Ohioans to vote against the Issue 1 ballot measure to enshrine contraception and abortion in the state constitution, calling it a &quot;spiritual battle&quot;.

Smith has been a worship leader at TheCall events, large prophetic prayer rallies founded by Lou Engle and Ché Ahn.

<doc id="154735" wikidata="Q410101" url="?curid=154735" title="Pentlandite">
<text>Pentlandite is an iron–nickel sulfide with the chemical formula . Pentlandite has a narrow variation range in nickel to iron ratios (Ni:Fe), but it is usually described as 1:1. In some cases, this ratio is skewed by the presence of pyrrhotite inclusions. It also contains minor cobalt, usually at low levels as a fraction of weight.

Pentlandite forms isometric crystals, but it is normally found in massive granular aggregates. It is brittle with a hardness of 3.5–4 and specific gravity of 4.6–5.0 and is non-magnetic. It has a yellowish bronze color and a metallic luster.

Pentlandite is found in abundance within ultramafic rocks, making it one of the most important sources of mined nickel. It also occasionally occurs within mantle xenoliths and &quot;black smoker&quot; hydrothermal vents.

==Etymology==
It is named after Irish scientist Joseph Barclay Pentland (1797–1873), who first noted the mineral at Sudbury, Ontario.
== Identification ==

=== Physical and optical properties ===
In the field, pentlandite is often confused with other sulfide minerals, as they are all brassy yellowish in color and have a metallic luster. For this reason, the best way to discern pentlandite is by its paler color, lack of magnetism, and light brownish bronze streak. In contrast, pyrite, pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite will all display much darker streaks: brownish black, greyish black, greenish black respectively. When looked at using reflected light ore microscopy, it possesses key diagnostic properties such as octahedral cleavage, and its alteration to bravoite, a pinkish to brownish violet sulfide mineral that occurs in euhedral to octahedral crystals. Pentlandite usually develops as granular inclusions within other sulfide minerals (mainly pyrrhotite), often taking the shape of thin veins or &quot;flames&quot;. Although pentlandite is an opaque mineral, it exhibits a strong light creamy reflectance.
=== Mineral associations ===
Pentlandite occurs alongside sulfide minerals such as bravoite, chalcopyrite, cubanite, millerite, pyrrhotite, valleriite, as well as other minerals like chromite, ilmenite, magnetite, and sperrylite. It is chemically similar to mackinawite, godlevskite and horomanite.

Pentlandite is synonymous with folgerite, horbachite, lillhammerite, and nicopyrite.

== Pentlandite group ==
The pentlandite group is a subdivision of rare minerals that share similar chemical and structural properties with pentlandite, hence the name. Their chemical formula can be written as XY8(S, Se)8 in which X is usually replaced by silver, manganese, cadmium, and lead, while copper takes the place of Y. Iron, nickel, and cobalt have the ability to occupy both X or Y positions. These minerals are:

* Argentopentlandite Ag(Fe,Ni)8S8
* Cobalt pentlandite Co9S8
* Geffroyite (Ag,Cu,Fe)9(Se,S)8
* Manganese-shadlunite (Mn,Pb)(Cu,Fe)8S8
* Shadlunite (Pb,Cd)(Fe,Cu)8S8
* Oberthürite Rh3Ni32S32
* Sugakiite Cu(Fe,Ni)8S8

== Paragenesis ==
Pentlandite is the most common terrestrial nickel sulfide. It typically forms during cooling of a sulfide melt. These sulfide melts, in turn, are typically formed during the evolution of a silicate melt. Because nickel is a chalcophile element, it has preference for (i.e. it &quot;partitions into&quot;) sulfide phases. In sulfide undersaturated melts, nickel substitutes for other transition metals within ferromagnesian minerals, the most common being olivine, as well as nickeliferous varieties of amphibole, biotite, pyroxene and spinel. Nickel substitutes most readily for Fe2+ and Co2+ because or their similarity in size and charge.

In sulfide saturated melts, nickel behaves as a chalcophile element and partitions strongly into the sulfide phase. Because most nickel behaves as a compatible element in igneous differentiation processes, the formation of nickel-bearing sulfides is essentially restricted to sulfide saturated mafic and ultramafic melts. Minor amounts of nickel sulfides are found in mantle peridotites.

The behaviour of sulfide melts is complex and is affected by copper, nickel, iron, and sulfur ratios. Typically, above 1100 °C, only one sulfide melt exists. Upon cooling to 1000 °C, a solid containing mostly Fe and minor amounts of Ni and Cu is formed. This phase is called monosulfide solid solution (MSS), and is unstable at low temperatures decomposing to mixtures of pentlandite and pyrrhotite, and (rarely) pyrite. It is only upon cooling past ~ (dependent on composition) that the MSS undergoes exsolution. A separate phase, usually a copper-rich sulfide liquid may also form, giving rise to chalcopyrite upon cooling.

These phases typically form aphanitic equigranular massive sulfides, or are present as disseminated sulfides within rocks composed mostly of silicates. Pristine magmatic massive sulfide are rarely preserved as most deposits of nickeliferous sulfide have been metamorphosed.

Metamorphism at a grade equal to, or higher than, greenschist facies will cause solid massive sulfides to deform in a ductile fashion and to travel some distance into the country rock and along structures. Upon cessation of metamorphism, the sulfides may inherit a foliated or sheared texture, and typically develop bright, equigranular to globular aggregates of porphyroblastic pentlandite crystals known colloquially as &quot;fish scales&quot;.

Metamorphism may also alter the concentration of nickel and the Ni:Fe ratio and Ni:S ratio of the sulfides. In this case, pentlandite may be replaced by millerite, and rarely heazlewoodite. Metamorphism may also be associated with metasomatism, and it is particularly common for arsenic to react with pre-existing sulfides, producing nickeline, gersdorffite and other Ni–Co arsenides.

== Occurrence ==
Pentlandite is found within the lower margins of mineralized layered intrusions, the best examples being the Bushveld igneous complex, South Africa, the Voisey&#x27;s Bay troctolite intrusive complex in Canada, the Duluth gabbro, in North America, and various other localities throughout the world. In these locations, pentlandite is considered an important nickel ore.

Pentlandite is also the dominant ore mineral occurring in Kambalda type komatiitic nickel ore deposits, the prime example of which can be found in the Yilgarn Craton of Western Australia. Similar deposits exist at Nkomati, Namibia, in the Thompson Belt, Canada, and a few examples from Brazil.

Pentlandite, but primarily chalcopyrite and PGEs, are also obtained from the supergiant Norilsk nickel deposit, in trans-Siberian Russia.

The Sudbury Basin in Ontario, Canada, is associated with a large meteorite impact crater. The pentlandite-chalcopyrite-pyrrhotite ore around the Sudbury Structure formed from sulfide melts that segregated from the melt sheet produced by the impact.

<doc id="154738" wikidata="Q170591" url="?curid=154738" title="Hydrogen sulfide">
<text>Hydrogen sulfide is a chemical compound with the formula . It is a colorless chalcogen-hydride gas, and is toxic, corrosive, and flammable, with trace amounts in ambient atmosphere having a characteristic foul odor of rotten eggs. Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele is credited with having discovered the chemical composition of purified hydrogen sulfide in 1777.

Hydrogen sulfide is toxic to humans and most other animals by inhibiting cellular respiration in a manner similar to hydrogen cyanide. When it is inhaled or its salts are ingested in high amounts, damage to organs occurs rapidly with symptoms ranging from breathing difficulties to convulsions and death. Despite this, the human body produces small amounts of this sulfide and its mineral salts, and uses it as a signalling molecule.

Hydrogen sulfide is often produced from the microbial breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen, such as in swamps and sewers; this process is commonly known as anaerobic digestion, which is done by sulfate-reducing microorganisms. It also occurs in volcanic gases, natural gas deposits, and sometimes in well-drawn water.

==Properties==
Hydrogen sulfide is slightly denser than air. A mixture of and air can be explosive.

===Oxidation===
In general, hydrogen sulfide acts as a reducing agent, as indicated by its ability to reduce sulfur dioxide in the Claus process. Hydrogen sulfide burns in oxygen with a blue flame to form sulfur dioxide () and water:

If an excess of oxygen is present, sulfur trioxide () is formed, which quickly hydrates to sulfuric acid:

===Acid-base properties===
It is slightly soluble in water and acts as a weak acid (p&quot;K&quot;a = 6.9 in 0.01–0.1 mol/litre solutions at 18 °C), giving the hydrosulfide ion . Hydrogen sulfide and its solutions are colorless. When exposed to air, it slowly oxidizes to form elemental sulfur, which is not soluble in water. The sulfide anion is not formed in aqueous solution.

 exchange protons rapidly. This behavior is the basis of technologies for the purification of deuterium oxide (&quot;heavy water&quot; or ), which exploits the easy distillation of these compounds.

===Extreme temperatures and pressures===
At pressures above 90 GPa (gigapascal), hydrogen sulfide becomes a metallic conductor of electricity. When cooled below a critical temperature this high-pressure phase exhibits superconductivity. The critical temperature increases with pressure, ranging from 23 K at 100 GPa to 150 K at 200 GPa. If hydrogen sulfide is pressurized at higher temperatures, then cooled, the critical temperature reaches , the highest accepted superconducting critical temperature as of 2015. By substituting a small part of sulfur with phosphorus and using even higher pressures, it has been predicted that it may be possible to raise the critical temperature to above and achieve room-temperature superconductivity.

Hydrogen sulfide decomposes without a presence of a catalyst under atmospheric pressure around 1200 °C into hydrogen and sulfur.

===Reactions with metals===
Hydrogen sulfide reacts with metal ions to form metal sulfides, which are insoluble, often dark colored solids. This behavior is the basis of the use of hydrogen sulfide as a reagent in the qualitative inorganic analysis of metal ions. In these analyses, heavy metal (and nonmetal) ions (e.g., Pb(II), Cu(II), Hg(II), As(III)) are precipitated from solution upon exposure to . The components of the resulting solid are then identified by their reactivity. Lead(II) acetate paper is used to detect hydrogen sulfide because it readily converts to lead(II) sulfide, which is black.

Hydrogen sulfide is also responsible for tarnishing on various metals including copper and silver; the chemical responsible for black toning found on silver coins is silver sulfide (), which is produced when the silver on the surface of the coin reacts with atmospheric hydrogen sulfide. Coins that have been subject to toning by hydrogen sulfide and other sulfur-containing compounds may have the toning add to the numismatic value of a coin based on aesthetics, as the toning may produce thin-film interference, resulting in the coin taking on an attractive coloration. Coins can also be intentionally treated with hydrogen sulfide to induce toning, though artificial toning can be distinguished from natural toning, and is generally criticised among collectors.

==Production==
Hydrogen sulfide is most commonly obtained by its separation from sour gas, which is natural gas with a high content of . It can also be produced by treating hydrogen with molten elemental sulfur at about 450 °C. Hydrocarbons can serve as a source of hydrogen in this process.
The very favorable thermodynamics for the hydrogenation of sulfur implies that the dehydrogenation (or cracking) of hydrogen sulfide would require very high temperatures.

A standard lab preparation is to treat ferrous sulfide with a strong acid in a Kipp generator:
For use in qualitative inorganic analysis, thioacetamide is used to generate :

Many metal and nonmetal sulfides, e.g. aluminium sulfide, phosphorus pentasulfide, silicon disulfide liberate hydrogen sulfide upon exposure to water:

This gas is also produced by heating sulfur with solid organic compounds and by reducing sulfurated organic compounds with hydrogen.
It can also be produced by mixing ammonium thiocyanate to concentrated sulphuric acid and adding water to it.

=== Biosynthesis ===
Hydrogen sulfide can be generated in cells via enzymatic or non-enzymatic pathways. Three enzymes catalyze formation of : cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), cystathionine β-synthetase (CBS), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST). CBS and CSE are the main proponents of biogenesis, which follows the trans-sulfuration pathway. These enzymes have been identified in a breadth of biological cells and tissues, and their activity is induced by a number of disease states. These enzymes are characterized by the transfer of a sulfur atom from methionine to serine to form a cysteine molecule. 3-MST also contributes to hydrogen sulfide production by way of the cysteine catabolic pathway. Dietary amino acids, such as methionine and cysteine serve as the primary substrates for the transulfuration pathways and in the production of hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide can also be derived from proteins such as ferredoxins and Rieske proteins.

Sulfate-reducing (resp. sulfur-reducing) bacteria generate usable energy under low-oxygen conditions by using sulfates (resp. elemental sulfur) to oxidize organic compounds or hydrogen; this produces hydrogen sulfide as a waste product.

===Signalling role===
 in the body acts as a gaseous signaling molecule with implications for health and in diseases.

Hydrogen sulfide is involved in vasodilation in animals, as well as in increasing seed germination and stress responses in plants. Hydrogen sulfide signaling is moderated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). has been shown to interact with the NO pathway resulting in several different cellular effects, including the inhibition of cGMP phosphodiesterases, as well as the formation of another signal called nitrosothiol. Hydrogen sulfide is also known to increase the levels of glutathione, which acts to reduce or disrupt ROS levels in cells.

The field of biology has advanced from environmental toxicology to investigate the roles of endogenously produced in physiological conditions and in various pathophysiological states. has been implicated in cancer, in Down syndrome and in vascular disease.

At lower concentrations, it stimulates mitochondrial function via multiple mechanisms including direct electron donation. However, at higher concentrations, it inhibits Complex IV of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which effectively reduces ATP generation and biochemical activity within cells.

==Uses==
===Production of sulfur===
Hydrogen sulfide is mainly consumed as a precursor to elemental sulfur. This conversion, called the Claus process, involves partial oxidation to sulfur dioxide. The latter reacts with hydrogen sulfide to give elemental sulfur. The conversion is catalyzed by alumina.

===Production of thioorganic compounds===
Many fundamental organosulfur compounds are produced using hydrogen sulfide. These include methanethiol, ethanethiol, and thioglycolic acid. Hydrosulfides can be used in the production of thiophenol.

===Production of metal sulfides===
Upon combining with alkali metal bases, hydrogen sulfide converts to alkali hydrosulfides such as sodium hydrosulfide and sodium sulfide:
:
Sodium sulfides are used in the paper making industry. Specifically, salts of break bonds between lignin and cellulose components of pulp in the Kraft process.

As indicated above, many metal ions react with hydrogen sulfide to give the corresponding metal sulfides. Oxidic ores are sometimes treated with hydrogen sulfide to give the corresponding metal sulfides which are more readily purified by flotation.Metal parts are sometimes passivated with hydrogen sulfide. Catalysts used in hydrodesulfurization are routinely activated with hydrogen sulfide.

=== Occurrence ===
Volcanoes and some hot springs (as well as cold springs) emit some . Hydrogen sulfide can be present naturally in well water, often as a result of the action of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Hydrogen sulfide is produced by the human body in small quantities through bacterial breakdown of proteins containing sulfur in the intestinal tract; it therefore contributes to the characteristic odor of flatulence. It is also produced in the mouth (halitosis).

A portion of global emissions are due to human activity. By far the largest industrial source of is petroleum refineries: The hydrodesulfurization process liberates sulfur from petroleum by the action of hydrogen. The resulting is converted to elemental sulfur by partial combustion via the Claus process, which is a major source of elemental sulfur. Other anthropogenic sources of hydrogen sulfide include coke ovens, paper mills (using the Kraft process), tanneries and sewerage. arises from virtually anywhere where elemental sulfur comes in contact with organic material, especially at high temperatures. Depending on environmental conditions, it is responsible for deterioration of material through the action of some sulfur oxidizing microorganisms. It is called biogenic sulfide corrosion.

In 2011 it was reported that increased concentrations of were observed in the Bakken formation crude, possibly due to oil field practices, and presented challenges such as &quot;health and environmental risks, corrosion of wellbore, added expense with regard to materials handling and pipeline equipment, and additional refinement requirements&quot;.

Besides living near gas and oil drilling operations, ordinary citizens can be exposed to hydrogen sulfide by being near waste water treatment facilities, landfills and farms with manure storage. Exposure occurs through breathing contaminated air or drinking contaminated water.

In municipal waste landfill sites, the burial of organic material rapidly leads to the production of anaerobic digestion within the waste mass and, with the humid atmosphere and relatively high temperature that accompanies biodegradation, biogas is produced as soon as the air within the waste mass has been reduced. If there is a source of sulfate bearing material, such as plasterboard or natural gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate), under anaerobic conditions sulfate reducing bacteria converts this to hydrogen sulfide. These bacteria cannot survive in air but the moist, warm, anaerobic conditions of buried waste that contains a high source of carbon – in inert landfills, paper and glue used in the fabrication of products such as plasterboard can provide a rich source of carbon – is an excellent environment for the formation of hydrogen sulfide.

In industrial anaerobic digestion processes, such as waste water treatment or the digestion of organic waste from agriculture, hydrogen sulfide can be formed from the reduction of sulfate and the degradation of amino acids and proteins within organic compounds. Sulfates are relatively non-inhibitory to methane forming bacteria but can be reduced to by sulfate reducing bacteria, of which there are several genera.

===Removal from water===
A number of processes have been designed to remove hydrogen sulfide from drinking water.

; Continuous chlorination: For levels up to 75 mg/L chlorine is used in the purification process as an oxidizing chemical to react with hydrogen sulfide. This reaction yields insoluble solid sulfur. Usually the chlorine used is in the form of sodium hypochlorite.

; Aeration: For concentrations of hydrogen sulfide less than 2 mg/L aeration is an ideal treatment process. Oxygen is added to water and a reaction between oxygen and hydrogen sulfide react to produce odorless sulfate.

===Removal from fuel gases===
Hydrogen sulfide is commonly found in raw natural gas and biogas. It is typically removed by amine gas treating technologies. In such processes, the hydrogen sulfide is first converted to an ammonium salt, whereas the natural gas is unaffected.
The bisulfide anion is subsequently regenerated by heating of the amine sulfide solution. Hydrogen sulfide generated in this process is typically converted to elemental sulfur using the Claus Process.

==Safety==
The underground mine gas term for foul-smelling hydrogen sulfide-rich gas mixtures is &quot;stinkdamp&quot;. Hydrogen sulfide is a highly toxic and flammable gas (flammable range: 4.3–46%). It can poison several systems in the body, although the nervous system is most affected. The toxicity of is comparable with that of carbon monoxide. It binds with iron in the mitochondrial cytochrome enzymes, thus preventing cellular respiration. Its toxic properties were described in detail in 1843 by Justus von Liebig.

Even before hydrogen sulfide was discovered, Italian physician Bernardino Ramazzini hypothesized in his 1713 book De Morbis Artificum Diatriba that occupational diseases of sewer-workers and blackening of coins in their clothes may be caused by an unknown invisible volatile acid (moreover, in late 18th century toxic gas emanation from Paris sewers became a problem for the citizens and authorities).

Although very pungent at first (it smells like rotten eggs), it quickly deadens the sense of smell, creating temporary anosmia, so victims may be unaware of its presence until it is too late. Safe handling procedures are provided by its safety data sheet (SDS).

===Low-level exposure===
Since hydrogen sulfide occurs naturally in the body, the environment, and the gut, enzymes exist to metabolize it. At some threshold level, believed to average around 300–350 ppm, the oxidative enzymes become overwhelmed. Many personal safety gas detectors, such as those used by utility, sewage and petrochemical workers, are set to alarm at as low as 5 to 10 ppm and to go into high alarm at 15 ppm. Metabolism causes oxidation to sulfate, which is harmless. Hence, low levels of hydrogen sulfide may be tolerated indefinitely.

Exposure to lower concentrations can result in eye irritation, a sore throat and cough, nausea, shortness of breath, and fluid in the lungs. These effects are believed to be due to hydrogen sulfide combining with alkali present in moist surface tissues to form sodium sulfide, a caustic. These symptoms usually subside in a few weeks.

Long-term, low-level exposure may result in fatigue, loss of appetite, headaches, irritability, poor memory, and dizziness. Chronic exposure to low level (around 2 ppm) has been implicated in increased miscarriage and reproductive health issues among Russian and Finnish wood pulp workers, but the reports have not (as of 1995) been replicated.

===High-level exposure===
Short-term, high-level exposure can induce immediate collapse, with loss of breathing and a high probability of death. If death does not occur, high exposure to hydrogen sulfide can lead to cortical pseudolaminar necrosis, degeneration of the basal ganglia and cerebral edema. Although respiratory paralysis may be immediate, it can also be delayed up to 72 hours.

Inhalation of resulted in about 7 workplace deaths per year in the U.S. (2011–2017 data), second only to carbon monoxide (17 deaths per year) for workplace chemical inhalation deaths.

====Exposure thresholds====
* Exposure limits stipulated by the United States government:
** 10 ppm REL-Ceiling (NIOSH): recommended permissible exposure ceiling (the recommended level that must not be exceeded, except once for 10 min. in an 8-hour shift, if no other measurable exposure occurs)
** 20 ppm PEL-Ceiling (OSHA): permissible exposure ceiling (the level that must not be exceeded, except once for 10 min. in an 8-hour shift, if no other measurable exposure occurs)
** 50 ppm PEL-Peak (OSHA): peak permissible exposure (the level that must never be exceeded)
** 100 ppm IDLH (NIOSH): immediately dangerous to life and health (the level that interferes with the ability to escape)
* 0.00047 ppm or 0.47 ppb is the odor threshold, the point at which 50% of a human panel can detect the presence of an odor without being able to identify it.
* 10–20 ppm is the borderline concentration for eye irritation.
* 50–100 ppm leads to eye damage.
* At 100–150 ppm the olfactory nerve is paralyzed after a few inhalations, and the sense of smell disappears, often together with awareness of danger.
* 320–530 ppm leads to pulmonary edema with the possibility of death.
* 530–1000 ppm causes strong stimulation of the central nervous system and rapid breathing, leading to loss of breathing.
* 800 ppm is the lethal concentration for 50% of humans for 5 minutes&#x27; exposure (LC50).
* Concentrations over 1000 ppm cause immediate collapse with loss of breathing, even after inhalation of a single breath.

====Treatment====

Treatment involves immediate inhalation of amyl nitrite, injections of sodium nitrite, or administration of 4-dimethylaminophenol in combination with inhalation of pure oxygen, administration of bronchodilators to overcome eventual bronchospasm, and in some cases hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). HBOT has clinical and anecdotal support.

===Incidents===
Hydrogen sulfide was used by the British Army as a chemical weapon during World War I. It was not considered to be an ideal war gas, partially due to its flammability and because the distinctive smell could be detected from even a small leak, alerting the enemy to the presence of the gas. It was nevertheless used on two occasions in 1916 when other gases were in short supply.

On September 2, 2005, a leak in the propeller room of a Royal Caribbean Cruise Liner docked in Los Angeles resulted in the deaths of 3 crewmen due to a sewage line leak. As a result, all such compartments are now required to have a ventilation system.

A dump of toxic waste containing hydrogen sulfide is believed to have caused 17 deaths and thousands of illnesses in Abidjan, on the West African coast, in the 2006 Côte d&#x27;Ivoire toxic waste dump.

In September 2008, three workers were killed and two suffered serious injury, including long term brain damage, at a mushroom growing company in Langley, British Columbia. A valve to a pipe that carried chicken manure, straw and gypsum to the compost fuel for the mushroom growing operation became clogged, and as workers unclogged the valve in a confined space without proper ventilation the hydrogen sulfide that had built up due to anaerobic decomposition of the material was released, poisoning the workers in the surrounding area. An investigator said there could have been more fatalities if the pipe had been fully cleared and/or if the wind had changed directions.

In 2014, levels of hydrogen sulfide as high as 83 ppm were detected at a recently built mall in Thailand called Siam Square One at the Siam Square area. Shop tenants at the mall reported health complications such as sinus inflammation, breathing difficulties and eye irritation. After investigation it was determined that the large amount of gas originated from imperfect treatment and disposal of waste water in the building.

In 2014, hydrogen sulfide gas killed workers at the Promenade shopping center in North Scottsdale, Arizona, USA after climbing into 15 ft deep chamber without wearing personal protective gear. &quot;Arriving crews recorded high levels of hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen sulfide coming out of the sewer.&quot;

In November 2014, a substantial amount of hydrogen sulfide gas shrouded the central, eastern and southeastern parts of Moscow. Residents living in the area were urged to stay indoors by the emergencies ministry. Although the exact source of the gas was not known, blame had been placed on a Moscow oil refinery.

In June 2016, a mother and her daughter were found dead in their still-running 2006 Porsche Cayenne SUV against a guardrail on Florida&#x27;s Turnpike, initially thought to be victims of carbon monoxide poisoning. Their deaths remained unexplained as the medical examiner waited for results of toxicology tests on the victims, until urine tests revealed that hydrogen sulfide was the cause of death. A report from the Orange-Osceola Medical Examiner&#x27;s Office indicated that toxic fumes came from the Porsche&#x27;s starter battery, located under the front passenger seat.

In January 2017, three utility workers in Key Largo, Florida, died one by one within seconds of descending into a narrow space beneath a manhole cover to check a section of paved street. In an attempt to save the men, a firefighter who entered the hole without his air tank (because he could not fit through the hole with it) collapsed within seconds and had to be rescued by a colleague. The firefighter was airlifted to Jackson Memorial Hospital and later recovered. A Monroe County Sheriff officer initially determined that the space contained hydrogen sulfide and methane gas produced by decomposing vegetation.

On May 24, 2018, two workers were killed, another seriously injured, and 14 others hospitalized by hydrogen sulfide inhalation at a Norske Skog paper mill in Albury, New South Wales. An investigation by SafeWork NSW found that the gas was released from a tank used to hold process water. The workers were exposed at the end of a 3-day maintenance period. Hydrogen sulfide had built up in an upstream tank, which had been left stagnant and untreated with biocide during the maintenance period. These conditions allowed sulfate-reducing bacteria to grow in the upstream tank, as the water contained small quantities of wood pulp and fiber. The high rate of pumping from this tank into the tank involved in the incident caused hydrogen sulfide gas to escape from various openings around its top when pumping was resumed at the end of the maintenance period. The area above it was sufficiently enclosed for the gas to pool there, despite not being identified as a confined space by Norske Skog. One of the workers who was killed was exposed while investigating an apparent fluid leak in the tank, while the other who was killed and the worker who was badly injured were attempting to rescue the first after he collapsed on top of it. In a resulting criminal case, Norske Skog was accused of failing to ensure the health and safety of its workforce at the plant to a reasonably practicable extent. It pleaded guilty, and was fined AU$1,012,500 and ordered to fund the production of an anonymized educational video about the incident.

In October 2019, an Odessa, Texas employee of Aghorn Operating Inc. and his wife were killed due to a water pump failure. Produced water with a high concentration of hydrogen sulfide was released by the pump. The worker died while responding to an automated phone call he had received alerting him to a mechanical failure in the pump, while his wife died after driving to the facility to check on him. A CSB investigation cited lax safety practices at the facility, such as an informal lockout-tagout procedure and a nonfunctioning hydrogen sulfide alert system.

===Suicides===
The gas, produced by mixing certain household ingredients, was used in a suicide wave in 2008 in Japan. The wave prompted staff at Tokyo&#x27;s suicide prevention center to set up a special hotline during &quot;Golden Week&quot;, as they received an increase in calls from people wanting to kill themselves during the annual May holiday.

As of 2010, this phenomenon has occurred in a number of US cities, prompting warnings to those arriving at the site of the suicide. 

In 2020, ingestion was used as a suicide method by Japanese pro wrestler Hana Kimura.

In 2024, Lucy-Bleu Knight, stepdaughter of famed musician Slash, also used ingestion to commit suicide.

==Hydrogen sulfide in the natural environment==
===Microbial: The sulfur cycle===


Hydrogen sulfide is a central participant in the sulfur cycle, the biogeochemical cycle of sulfur on Earth.

In the absence of oxygen, sulfur-reducing and sulfate-reducing bacteria derive energy from oxidizing hydrogen or organic molecules by reducing elemental sulfur or sulfate to hydrogen sulfide. Other bacteria liberate hydrogen sulfide from sulfur-containing amino acids; this gives rise to the odor of rotten eggs and contributes to the odor of flatulence.

As organic matter decays under low-oxygen (or hypoxic) conditions (such as in swamps, eutrophic lakes or dead zones of oceans), sulfate-reducing bacteria will use the sulfates present in the water to oxidize the organic matter, producing hydrogen sulfide as waste. Some of the hydrogen sulfide will react with metal ions in the water to produce metal sulfides, which are not water-soluble. These metal sulfides, such as ferrous sulfide FeS, are often black or brown, leading to the dark color of sludge.

Several groups of bacteria can use hydrogen sulfide as fuel, oxidizing it to elemental sulfur or to sulfate by using dissolved oxygen, metal oxides (e.g., iron oxyhydroxides and manganese oxides), or nitrate as electron acceptors.

The purple sulfur bacteria and the green sulfur bacteria use hydrogen sulfide as an electron donor in photosynthesis, thereby producing elemental sulfur. This mode of photosynthesis is older than the mode of cyanobacteria, algae, and plants, which uses water as electron donor and liberates oxygen.

The biochemistry of hydrogen sulfide is a key part of the chemistry of the iron-sulfur world. In this model of the origin of life on Earth, geologically produced hydrogen sulfide is postulated as an electron donor driving the reduction of carbon dioxide.

===Animals===
Hydrogen sulfide is lethal to most animals, but a few highly specialized species (extremophiles) do thrive in habitats that are rich in this compound.

In the deep sea, hydrothermal vents and cold seeps with high levels of hydrogen sulfide are home to a number of extremely specialized lifeforms, ranging from bacteria to fish. Because of the absence of sunlight at these depths, these ecosystems rely on chemosynthesis rather than photosynthesis.

Freshwater springs rich in hydrogen sulfide are mainly home to invertebrates, but also include a small number of fish: &quot;Cyprinodon bobmilleri&quot; (a pupfish from Mexico), &quot;Limia sulphurophila&quot; (a poeciliid from the Dominican Republic), &quot;Gambusia eurystoma&quot; (a poeciliid from Mexico), and a few &quot;Poecilia&quot; (poeciliids from Mexico). Invertebrates and microorganisms in some cave systems, such as Movile Cave, are adapted to high levels of hydrogen sulfide.

===Interstellar and planetary occurrence===
Hydrogen sulfide has often been detected in the interstellar medium. It also occurs in the clouds of planets in our solar system.

===Mass extinctions===
Hydrogen sulfide has been implicated in several mass extinctions that have occurred in the Earth&#x27;s past. In particular, a buildup of hydrogen sulfide in the atmosphere may have caused, or at least contributed to, the Permian-Triassic extinction event 252 million years ago.

Organic residues from these extinction boundaries indicate that the oceans were anoxic (oxygen-depleted) and had species of shallow plankton that metabolized . The formation of may have been initiated by massive volcanic eruptions, which emitted carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, which warmed the oceans, lowering their capacity to absorb oxygen that would otherwise oxidize . The increased levels of hydrogen sulfide could have killed oxygen-generating plants as well as depleted the ozone layer, causing further stress. Small blooms have been detected in modern times in the Dead Sea and in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Namibia.

<text>Electrodeposition may refer to:

*Electroplating, a process that uses electric current to reduce dissolved metal cations so that they form a coherent metal coating on an electrode
*Electrophoretic deposition, a term for a broad range of industrial processes which includes electrocoating, e-coating, cathodic electrodeposition, anodic electrodeposition and electrophoretic coating, or electrophoretic painting
*Underpotential deposition, a phenomenon of electrodeposition of a species (typically reduction of a metal cation to a solid metal) at a potential less negative than the equilibrium (Nernst) potential for the reduction of this metal</text><links>
