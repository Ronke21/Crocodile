<text>Charles Frank Mangione ( ; born November 29, 1940) is an American flugelhorn player, trumpeter and composer.

He came to prominence as a member of Art Blakey&#x27;s band in the 1960s, and later co-led the Jazz Brothers with his brother, Gap. He achieved international success in 1978 with his jazz-pop single &quot;Feels So Good&quot;. Mangione has released more than 30 albums since 1960.

==Early life and career==
Mangione was born and raised in Rochester, New York, United States, to Italian parents. His paternal uncle was writer Jerre Mangione. With his pianist brother Gap, they led the Mangione Brothers Sextet/Quintet, which recorded three albums for Riverside Records, before Mangione branched out into other work. One of Chuck&#x27;s compositions for the Mangione Brothers Sextet, &quot;Something Different,&quot; was recorded by Cannonball Adderley on his 1961 album &quot;African Waltz&quot;. He attended the Eastman School of Music from 1958 to 1963, then joined Art Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers, for which he filled the trumpet chair previously held by Clifford Brown, Freddie Hubbard, Kenny Dorham, Bill Hardman, and Lee Morgan.

In the late 1960s, Mangione was a member of the band The National Gallery, which in 1968 released the album &quot;Performing Musical Interpretations of the Paintings of Paul Klee&quot;. Mangione served as director of the Eastman jazz ensemble from 1968 to 1972. In 1970, he returned to recording with the album &quot;Friends and Love&quot;, recorded in concert with the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra and guest performers.

Mangione&#x27;s quartet with saxophonist Gerry Niewood was a popular concert and recording act throughout the 1970s. &quot;Bellavia&quot;, recorded during this collaboration, won Mangione his first Grammy Award in 1977 in the category Best Instrumental Composition. &quot;Bellavia&quot; was used by WHAS-TV in Louisville, Kentucky as background music for school closings starting with the Blizzard of 1978.

Mangione&#x27;s composition &quot;Chase the Clouds Away&quot; was used at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec. His composition &quot;Give It All You Got&quot; was the theme to the 1980 Winter Olympic Games in Lake Placid, New York. He performed it live on a global television broadcast at the closing ceremonies. In 1978, Mangione composed the soundtrack for the film &quot;The Children of Sanchez&quot; starring Anthony Quinn. This album won him his second Grammy, in the category Best Pop Instrumental performance in 1979. The title song&#x27;s full version was almost 15 minutes long and featured a wind section theme. In 1981, Mangione composed and performed the theme for the film &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot;.

In addition to his quartet with Niewood, Mangione had much success with his later-1970s ensemble, with Chris Vadala on saxophones and flutes, Grant Geissman on guitars, Charles Meeks on bass guitar, and James Bradley Jr. on drums. This version of Mangione&#x27;s band recorded and toured behind the hit studio albums &quot;Feels So Good&quot; and &quot;Fun and Games&quot; and the &quot;Children of Sanchez&quot; soundtrack. Some band members participated in the &quot;Tarantella&quot; benefit concert in 1980. The song &quot;Feels So Good&quot; became a rare instrumental Top Ten hit, reaching #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1978.

The band was also featured with a 70-piece orchestra on the live album &quot;An Evening of Magic&quot;, which was recorded at the Hollywood Bowl on July 16, 1978, at the height of Mangione&#x27;s success from &quot;Feels So Good&quot;. Performances of material new and old included versions of &quot;Main Squeeze&quot;, &quot;Hill Where the Lord Hides&quot;, and &quot;Chase the Clouds Away&quot;. Mangione opened and closed the show with &quot;Feels So Good&quot; and its &quot;Reprise&quot; version. &quot;B&#x27; Bye&quot; featured a string arrangement from Bill Reichenbach. The horns were arranged by frequent collaborator Jeff Tyzik, who also played trumpet in the horn section that night. Mangione played material from the just-released &quot;Children of Sanchez&quot; soundtrack album, which made its West Coast concert debut.

The liner notes from the album describe the frenzy in which the performance was put together. Unable to set up on stage the day before (The Los Angeles Philharmonic played the &quot;1812 Overture&quot; on July 15), Mangione and his crew had only the day of show to set up lights, sound and recording gear. He had only nine hours the day before to rehearse at A&amp;M studios with the orchestra&#x27;s musicians and was never able to run through the entire set list once in its entirety. He and the band stayed at a hotel up the street from the Bowl to make sure they would not miss the performance due to snarled traffic pouring in as showtime neared. Nevertheless, the show went off without a hitch.

In December 1980, Mangione held a benefit concert in the Americana Hotel Ballroom in Rochester, to benefit the victims of an earthquake in Italy. The nine-hour concert included jazz performers Chick Corea, Steve Gadd and Dizzy Gillespie, among a host of other session and concert musicians. Soon thereafter, A&amp;M released &quot;Tarantella,&quot; named for the Italian traditional dance, a vinyl album of some of the concert&#x27;s exceptional moments, which has not yet been released as a CD.

A 1980 issue of &quot;Current Biography&quot; called &quot;Feels So Good&quot; the most recognized tune since &quot;Michelle&quot; by The Beatles. He raised over $50,000 for St. John&#x27;s Nursing Home at his 60th Birthday Bash Concert at the Eastman Theatre and played a few bars of &quot;Feels So Good&quot;. In 1997, Mangione did a session with Les Paul. Mangione was told of how he beat out Paul for the &#x27;Album of the Year&#x27; award.

==Acting career and television appearances==
In addition to music, Mangione has made a few appearances in television shows. In the &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; episode &quot;Paradise Blues&quot;, Chuck Mangione portrays a fellow night club act along with TC&#x27;s (Roger E. Mosley&#x27;s) former girlfriend. He performed two singles and has lines near the end of the show. In 1988, Mangione appeared on the hit family TV show &quot;Sharon, Lois &amp; Bram&#x27;s Elephant Show&quot; as &quot;Little Boy Blue&quot; playing his famous song.

Mangione had a recurring voice-acting role on the animated television series &quot;King of the Hill&quot;. In it he portrays himself as a celebrity spokesman for Mega Lo Mart, almost always wearing the white and red jacket from the cover of his &quot;Feels So Good&quot; album. The first episode of &quot;King of the Hill&quot; with Mangione originally aired on February 16, 1997. The episode featured an original score specifically recorded for the occasion. He continued to appear in episodes, a total of 10 more up until 2003. In the context of the series, Mangione chafes under an oppressive spokesperson contract with Mega Lo Mart (his contract had him appearing at every Mega Lo store opening, some 400 per year, leaving him no time to tour, record or be with his family). He eventually goes into hiding inside their store in Arlen, Texas, the fictional town in which &quot;King of the Hill&quot; is set. Mangione is discovered by Dale Gribble, who keeps his secret, in the episode &quot;Mega-Lo Dale.&quot; After a long hiatus, the character of Chuck Mangione returned in May 2007 in an episode titled &quot;Lucky&#x27;s Wedding Suit&quot;. A recurring joke is that whatever tune he plays on his flugelhorn inevitably shifts into &quot;Feels So Good&quot; after a few bars. After the Mega Lo Mart blows up, Mangione states during a group therapy session that &quot;every song I play now sounds like &#x27;Feels So Good&#x27;.&quot; The series finale in 2009 included Mangione one last time, playing the National Anthem which segued into &quot;Feels So Good&quot;. In an homage to the series, Mangione&#x27;s album &quot;Everything For Love&quot; contains a track titled &quot;Peggy Hill&quot;.

==Mangione&#x27;s band deaths==
Two members of the band, Gerry Niewood and Coleman Mellett, were among those killed when Continental Airlines Flight 3407 crashed into a house in the vicinity of Buffalo, New York, on February 12, 2009. In a statement Mangione said: &quot;I&#x27;m in shock over the horrible, heartbreaking tragedy.&quot;

<text>It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown is a 1966 American animated Halloween television special based on the comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot; by Charles M. Schulz. The third &quot;Peanuts&quot; special, and the second holiday-themed special, to be created, it was written by Schulz along with director/animator Bill Melendez and producer Lee Mendelson. The cast included Peter Robbins as Charlie Brown, Christopher Shea as Linus Van Pelt, Sally Dryer as Lucy Van Pelt, and Melendez as Snoopy. The special features music composed by jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi, whose contributions include the theme song &quot;Linus and Lucy&quot;. It aired on broadcast television every year from its debut in 1966 until 2020, when it became an Apple TV+ exclusive.

&quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&quot; follows the children of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comics as they celebrate Halloween, while Linus forgoes celebrations to wait in a pumpkin patch for the mythical Great Pumpkin. The sequence following Snoopy as a World War I flying ace and its depiction of Lucy pulling a football away from Charlie Brown have both become widely recognized in pop culture. The program was highly successful, watched by 49% of American television viewers in its debut broadcast. It received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for its artistic style and music score, and it is often regarded as the best of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; television specials. The success of &quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&quot; led to the development of the Halloween special as a television genre.

==Synopsis==

Sometime before Halloween, Linus diligently crafts a letter addressed to the Great Pumpkin, much to the ridicule of his peers. However, Sally Brown becomes intrigued by the idea, captivated by her affection for Linus. Shortly thereafter, Charlie Brown arrives with exciting news—he has been invited to a Halloween party hosted by Violet. As Halloween night unfolds, the children prepare their costumes for trick-or-treating. On their way, they make a brief detour to the pumpkin patch, where they mock Linus for choosing to miss the festivities in favor of waiting for the Great Pumpkin. Linus, undeterred, persuades Sally — who is enamored with him — to stay with him in the patch. Meanwhile, the others embark on their trick-or-treating rounds, but Charlie Brown finds himself disappointed, as he consistently receives rocks instead of candy. Afterward, they head to Violet’s Halloween party.

During this time, Snoopy, dressed as a World War I flying ace, boards his doghouse, imagining it to be a Sopwith Camel fighter plane engaged in a dramatic aerial battle with the elusive Red Baron. Snoopy&#x27;s imaginary adventure takes a turn as he is &quot;shot down,&quot; forcing him to navigate the treacherous countryside behind enemy lines. His journey culminates at Violet’s party, where he stealthily enters the apple-bobbing tank while Lucy is participating. Later, Snoopy finds solace listening to Schroeder play the piano. The initially cheerful music delights him, but soon shifts to melancholy, which overwhelms Snoopy with sadness. The music alternates between joyful and sorrowful, ultimately leaving Snoopy in tears. He departs the party, disheartened by the emotional rollercoaster.

Back at the pumpkin patch, Linus, ever steadfast in his belief, spots a figure in the distance. Convinced it is the Great Pumpkin, he faints in excitement. To his embarrassment, the figure turns out to be Snoopy, prompting Sally to angrily berate Linus for leading her to waste her night. Later, at 4 a.m., a concerned Lucy retrieves her brother from the cold pumpkin patch, tenderly bringing him home and putting him to bed.

The following day, Charlie Brown and Linus reflect on the events of Halloween, with Charlie attempting to comfort Linus by acknowledging his own past mistakes. However, Linus, deeply offended, launches into a passionate tirade, insisting that the Great Pumpkin will undoubtedly appear next year. Charlie Brown can only roll his eyes, resigned to Linus&#x27; unshakable belief.

== Background ==

The &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip by Charles M. Schulz first printed in 1950, and it became popular within its first years of publication. Schulz first introduced the Great Pumpkin in 1959 by having Linus confuse the traditions of Halloween and Christmas. The Great Pumpkin was introduced through a series of strips published over eight days, which became a major event for the comic strip. A similar story appeared again in 1960, encompassing sixteen comics. Schulz continued to write Great Pumpkin stories in &quot;Peanuts&quot; each October.

The television special &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; had been written by Schulz and broadcast on CBS in December 1965. The special was highly successful, prompting the network to hire Schulz for two additional television specials. His second special, &quot;Charlie Brown&#x27;s All Stars!&quot;, broadcast in the summer of 1966. While it was successful, it was not as renowned as &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;.

==Production==
The network requested another holiday special after the success of &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas.&quot; Its plot was formulated by a team of three: Schulz, director Bill Melendez, and producer Lee Mendelson. The network executive communicating with Mendelson specified that it had to be a &quot;blockbuster&quot;, which brought considerable stress to the writers. They also gave the writers more creative freedom while they wrote the third special.

The writers began with disparate scenes from the comic strip to adapt, including Snoopy as a World War I flying ace and Lucy pulling the football away from Charlie Brown. Schulz&#x27;s co-writers immediately took to the idea when he suggested writing a Halloween special around the Great Pumpkin. The main storyline about Linus and Sally was based on a series of strips from October and November 1962. The writing process went quickly, allowing more time for other aspects of production, such as animation. The decision to adapt Snoopy&#x27;s flying ace persona from the comic strip came together with the Halloween theme after Schulz realized it resembled a Halloween costume. Schulz suggested the idea of Charlie Brown receiving a rock while trick-or-treating, but Mendelson felt that this was &quot;too cruel&quot;. Schulz and Melendez responded by suggesting Charlie Brown should receive three rocks. Mendelson later agreed that it was the right decision after seeing the scene&#x27;s popularity.

The program was given a production budget of $76,000. The children in the program were voiced by child actors, including both trained child actors and children that lived in Mendelson&#x27;s neighborhood. Melendez insisted on having child actors in all of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; specials, and he voiced Snoopy by recording himself saying nonsense words and then speeding it up. Steinberg&#x27;s lines as Sally Brown were rushed when she developed a loose tooth, fearing that it would cause a lisp. She was taken to the studio to record all of her lines the same night and developed a severe lisp after losing her tooth the following day. Steinberg struggled with the word &quot;restitution&quot; while she was recording, so Mendelson had her pronounce it one syllable at a time and spliced it together afterward.

The animations were drawn by a team of artists led by Melendez. Bill Littlejohn also worked on the program&#x27;s animation. Unlike previous &quot;Peanuts&quot; specials, &quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&quot; incorporates frequent movement of the camera. Artist Dean Spille painted the backgrounds of the French countryside during Snoopy&#x27;s flying ace sequence. He drew from memory as he had previously visited similar areas in Europe, and he was given full creative freedom by Schulz and Melendez. The backgrounds in this sequence used linear perspective rather than a simple flat design. Mendelson later told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that the sequence with Snoopy flying his doghouse was &quot;one of the most memorable animated scenes ever.&quot; He also described &quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&quot; as Bill Melendez&#x27;s &quot;animation masterpiece&quot;. The program&#x27;s final runtime was 25 minutes.

== Music score ==
The music score was performed by the Vince Guaraldi Sextet, featuring Guaraldi on piano, Monty Budwig on bass, Colin Bailey on drums, John Gray on guitar, Ronald Lang on woodwinds and Emmanuel Klein on trumpet. It was orchestrated by John Scott Trotter. Recording took place on October 4, 1966, at Desilu&#x27;s Gower Street Studio in Hollywood. Guaraldi had been in charge of music in both of the previous &quot;Peanuts&quot; specials, as well as the unaired 1963 documentary &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;.

Guaraldi&#x27;s theme for the special, &quot;Great Pumpkin Waltz&quot;, is first heard when Linus is writing the Great Pumpkin at the beginning and plays throughout. The World War I songs played by Schroeder while Snoopy dances are: &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to Tipperary&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s a Long, Long Trail&quot;, &quot;Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit-Bag&quot;, and &quot;Roses of Picardy&quot;. Guaraldi historian Derrick Bang commented that the music Guaraldi composed for the special &quot;emphatically established the &quot;Peanuts&quot; &#x27;musical personality&#x27;,&quot; adding that the version of &quot;Linus and Lucy&quot; featured during the cold open was &quot;arguably the best arrangement…that Guaraldi ever laid down, thanks in great part to Ronald Lang&#x27;s flute counterpoint.&quot; This version was again utilized in the 1969 feature film &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;.

Craft Recordings released the complete soundtrack album from the special on October 5, 2018, but faced criticism for the inclusion of sound effects. Craft Recordings reissued the soundtrack on August 26, 2022 using newly discovered original master tapes, without sound effects from the television special.

== Release ==
The initial broadcast of &quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&quot; was on CBC Television in Canada on October 26, 1966. It was then broadcast on CBS October 27, 1966, preempting &quot;My Three Sons&quot;, and tied &quot;Bonanza&quot; as the No. 1 broadcast in that week&#x27;s Nielsen TV ratings. The show aired against &quot;Star Trek&quot; on NBC and &quot;The Dating Game&quot; on ABC, earning 49% of the total market share with 17.3 million viewers. After its success, CBS rebroadcast the program each year. It moved to ABC in 2001, where it continued to broadcast annually.

&quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&quot; was made available as a home release in 1985. The program was released on DVD by Paramount Pictures on September 12, 2000.

Apple Inc. purchased the broadcast rights to all &quot;Peanuts&quot; specials in 2018, and they became Apple TV+ exclusives in 2020. This was the first year that &quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&quot; was not broadcast on television since its debut in 1966. A licensing agreement allowed the special to air on PBS in 2021. The agreement was not renewed in 2022, but Apple has made the special free to watch for one weekend each year since then.

== Themes ==
Religion and faith feature prominently in the special. Linus&#x27;s belief in the Great Pumpkin and Charlie Brown&#x27;s belief in Santa Claus, and their opposition to one another&#x27;s beliefs, are described as &quot;denominational differences&quot;. This theme is lifted directly from the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip, with the &quot;denominational differences&quot; line appearing in 1963. Though Schulz was religious, he rejected evangelicalism and revealed religion, and he had long opposed the idea of denominational differences splitting religion, believing that no one denomination could be sure of the truth. Throughout the program, Linus maintains faith in the Great Pumpkin while he is criticized by the other children, and he chooses to maintain a vigil in the pumpkin patch at the cost of missing the festivities.

The special plays off of many traditional aspects of Halloween and celebrations associated with the holiday, including pumpkin carving, trick-or-treating, and wearing costumes. Despite this, it does not incorporate elements of horror fiction outside of the title sequence.
Comparisons to Christmas are also included, particularly the letter to the Great Pumpkin as opposed to Santa Claus, alluding to the success of the franchise&#x27;s Christmas special the prior year. Schulz modeled Linus&#x27;s devotion in part on that of children whose families were too poor to purchase vast amounts of Christmas presents, and the hope that things would be better next year if they maintained faith.

== Reception ==

The special was well received by viewers. The response was so positive that the Schulz and the studio began receiving packages of candy in response to Charlie Brown&#x27;s failure to get any during the program. Critic Lawrence Laurent praised the special in his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, emphasizing the musical score. Clay Gowran of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; responded to the program by expressing support for the creation of additional &quot;Peanuts&quot; specials. Cynthia Lowry of the Associated Press commented on the special&#x27;s optimism and lauded it for its &quot;charm, adult wit and wisdom&quot;. Mary Wood of &quot;The Cincinnati Post&quot; similarly praised the program as &quot;utterly enchanting&quot;. At the 19th Primetime Emmy Awards, the special was nominated for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program and for Special Classifications of Individual Achievements. The special has been celebrated for its artistic style, particularly its use of color. The sequence of Snoopy crossing the French countryside has received extensive praise, including from other animators and artists such as Jeff Pidgeon and Paul Felix. &quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&quot; is often described as the best of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; specials.

== Legacy ==
&quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&quot; defined a new genre, as it was the first major Halloween special to broadcast on television. The special&#x27;s enduring popularity helped to define Halloween for the baby boomers generation and contributed to the spread of Halloween as a widely celebrated holiday. Its viewing has since been established as a common Halloween tradition, and its 2003 rebroadcast was the most successful holiday special of the 2000s with 13.2 million viewers.

Two scenes adapting common elements of the comic strip—Snoopy as a WWI flying ace and Charlie Brown attempting to kick the football—were popularized by this special and became commonly recognized imagery. The sequence of Snoopy as a flying ace, which featured no other characters and took up approximately one quarter of the program&#x27;s runtime, popularized Snoopy as a character independently of the others. Schulz replicated &quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&quot; when he portrayed Linus&#x27;s devotion to the Easter Beagle in the 1974 special &quot;It&#x27;s the Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown&quot;. In this case, Schulz was careful to avoid religious overtones, having Snoopy be the Easter Beagle. The Great Pumpkin has also been referenced in later &quot;Peanuts&quot; specials, including &quot;You&#x27;re Not Elected, Charlie Brown&quot;.

<text>In topology, knot theory is the study of mathematical knots. While inspired by knots which appear in daily life, such as those in shoelaces and rope, a mathematical knot differs in that the ends are joined so it cannot be undone, the simplest knot being a ring (or &quot;unknot&quot;). In mathematical language, a knot is an embedding of a circle in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, formula_1. Two mathematical knots are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of formula_2 upon itself (known as an ambient isotopy); these transformations correspond to manipulations of a knotted string that do not involve cutting it or passing it through itself.

Knots can be described in various ways. Using different description methods, there may be more than one description of the same knot. For example, a common method of describing a knot is a planar diagram called a knot diagram, in which any knot can be drawn in many different ways. Therefore, a fundamental problem in knot theory is determining when two descriptions represent the same knot.

A complete algorithmic solution to this problem exists, which has unknown complexity. In practice, knots are often distinguished using a &quot;knot invariant&quot;, a &quot;quantity&quot; which is the same when computed from different descriptions of a knot. Important invariants include knot polynomials, knot groups, and hyperbolic invariants.

The original motivation for the founders of knot theory was to create a table of knots and links, which are knots of several components entangled with each other. More than six billion knots and links have been tabulated since the beginnings of knot theory in the 19th century.

To gain further insight, mathematicians have generalized the knot concept in several ways. Knots can be considered in other three-dimensional spaces and objects other than circles can be used; see &quot;knot (mathematics)&quot;. For example, a higher-dimensional knot is an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional sphere embedded in (&quot;n&quot;+2)-dimensional Euclidean space.

==History==
Archaeologists have discovered that knot tying dates back to prehistoric times. Besides their uses such as recording information and tying objects together, knots have interested humans for their aesthetics and spiritual symbolism. Knots appear in various forms of Chinese artwork dating from several centuries BC (see Chinese knotting). The endless knot appears in Tibetan Buddhism, while the Borromean rings have made repeated appearances in different cultures, often representing strength in unity. The Celtic monks who created the Book of Kells lavished entire pages with intricate Celtic knotwork.
A mathematical theory of knots was first developed in 1771 by Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde who explicitly noted the importance of topological features when discussing the properties of knots related to the geometry of position. Mathematical studies of knots began in the 19th century with Carl Friedrich Gauss, who defined the linking integral . In the 1860s, Lord Kelvin&#x27;s theory that atoms were knots in the aether led to Peter Guthrie Tait&#x27;s creation of the first knot tables for complete classification. Tait, in 1885, published a table of knots with up to ten crossings, and what came to be known as the Tait conjectures. This record motivated the early knot theorists, but knot theory eventually became part of the emerging subject of topology.

These topologists in the early part of the 20th century—Max Dehn, J. W. Alexander, and others—studied knots from the point of view of the knot group and invariants from homology theory such as the Alexander polynomial. This would be the main approach to knot theory until a series of breakthroughs transformed the subject.

In the late 1970s, William Thurston introduced hyperbolic geometry into the study of knots with the hyperbolization theorem. Many knots were shown to be hyperbolic knots, enabling the use of geometry in defining new, powerful knot invariants. The discovery of the Jones polynomial by Vaughan Jones in 1984 , and subsequent contributions from Edward Witten, Maxim Kontsevich, and others, revealed deep connections between knot theory and mathematical methods in statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. A plethora of knot invariants have been invented since then, utilizing sophisticated tools such as quantum groups and Floer homology.

In the last several decades of the 20th century, scientists became interested in studying physical knots in order to understand knotting phenomena in DNA and other polymers. Knot theory can be used to determine if a molecule is chiral (has a &quot;handedness&quot;) or not . Tangles, strings with both ends fixed in place, have been effectively used in studying the action of topoisomerase on DNA . Knot theory may be crucial in the construction of quantum computers, through the model of topological quantum computation .

==Knot equivalence==

A knot is created by beginning with a one-dimensional line segment, wrapping it around itself arbitrarily, and then fusing its two free ends together to form a closed loop . Simply, we can say a knot formula_3 is a &quot;simple closed curve&quot; (see Curve) — that is: a &quot;nearly&quot; injective and continuous function formula_4, with the only &quot;non-injectivity&quot; being formula_5. Topologists consider knots and other entanglements such as links and braids to be equivalent if the knot can be pushed about smoothly, without intersecting itself, to coincide with another knot.

The idea of knot equivalence is to give a precise definition of when two knots should be considered the same even when positioned quite differently in space. A formal mathematical definition is that two knots formula_6 are equivalent if there is an orientation-preserving homeomorphism formula_7 with formula_8.

What this definition of knot equivalence means is that two knots are equivalent when there is a continuous family of homeomorphisms formula_9 of space onto itself, such that the last one of them carries the first knot onto the second knot. (In detail: Two knots formula_10 and formula_11 are equivalent if there exists a continuous mapping formula_12 such that a) for each formula_13 the mapping taking formula_14 to formula_15 is a homeomorphism of formula_16 onto itself; b) formula_17 for all formula_14; and c) formula_19. Such a function formula_20 is known as an ambient isotopy.)

These two notions of knot equivalence agree exactly about which knots are equivalent: Two knots that are equivalent under the orientation-preserving homeomorphism definition are also equivalent under the ambient isotopy definition, because any orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of formula_16 to itself is the final stage of an ambient isotopy starting from the identity. Conversely, two knots equivalent under the ambient isotopy definition are also equivalent under the orientation-preserving homeomorphism definition, because the formula_22 (final) stage of the ambient isotopy must be an orientation-preserving homeomorphism carrying one knot to the other.

The basic problem of knot theory, the recognition problem, is determining the equivalence of two knots. Algorithms exist to solve this problem, with the first given by Wolfgang Haken in the late 1960s . Nonetheless, these algorithms can be extremely time-consuming, and a major issue in the theory is to understand how hard this problem really is . The special case of recognizing the unknot, called the unknotting problem, is of particular interest . In February 2021 Marc Lackenby announced a new unknot recognition algorithm that runs in quasi-polynomial time.

==Knot diagrams==

A useful way to visualise and manipulate knots is to project the knot onto a plane—think of the knot casting a shadow on the wall. A small change in the direction of projection will ensure that it is one-to-one except at the double points, called &quot;crossings&quot;, where the &quot;shadow&quot; of the knot crosses itself once transversely . At each crossing, to be able to recreate the original knot, the over-strand must be distinguished from the under-strand. This is often done by creating a break in the strand going underneath. The resulting diagram is an immersed plane curve with the additional data of which strand is over and which is under at each crossing. (These diagrams are called knot diagrams when they represent a knot and link diagrams when they represent a link.) Analogously, knotted surfaces in 4-space can be related to immersed surfaces in 3-space.

A reduced diagram is a knot diagram in which there are no reducible crossings (also nugatory or removable crossings), or in which all of the reducible crossings have been removed. A petal projection is a type of projection in which, instead of forming double points, all strands of the knot meet at a single crossing point, connected to it by loops forming non-nested &quot;petals&quot;.

===Reidemeister moves===

In 1927, working with this diagrammatic form of knots, J. W. Alexander and Garland Baird Briggs, and independently Kurt Reidemeister, demonstrated that two knot diagrams belonging to the same knot can be related by a sequence of three kinds of moves on the diagram, shown below. These operations, now called the &quot;Reidemeister moves&quot;, are:

The proof that diagrams of equivalent knots are connected by Reidemeister moves relies on an analysis of what happens under the planar projection of the movement taking one knot to another. The movement can be arranged so that almost all of the time the projection will be a knot diagram, except at finitely many times when an &quot;event&quot; or &quot;catastrophe&quot; occurs, such as when more than two strands cross at a point or multiple strands become tangent at a point. A close inspection will show that complicated events can be eliminated, leaving only the simplest events: (1) a &quot;kink&quot; forming or being straightened out; (2) two strands becoming tangent at a point and passing through; and (3) three strands crossing at a point. These are precisely the Reidemeister moves .

==Knot invariants==
A knot invariant is a &quot;quantity&quot; that is the same for equivalent knots . For example, if the invariant is computed from a knot diagram, it should give the same value for two knot diagrams representing equivalent knots. An invariant may take the same value on two different knots, so by itself may be incapable of distinguishing all knots. An elementary invariant is tricolorability.

&quot;Classical&quot; knot invariants include the knot group, which is the fundamental group of the knot complement, and the Alexander polynomial, which can be computed from the Alexander invariant, a module constructed from the infinite cyclic cover of the knot complement . In the late 20th century, invariants such as &quot;quantum&quot; knot polynomials, Vassiliev invariants and hyperbolic invariants were discovered. These aforementioned invariants are only the tip of the iceberg of modern knot theory.

===Knot polynomials===

A knot polynomial is a knot invariant that is a polynomial. Well-known examples include the Jones polynomial, the Alexander polynomial, and the Kauffman polynomial. A variant of the Alexander polynomial, the Alexander–Conway polynomial, is a polynomial in the variable &quot;z&quot; with integer coefficients .

The Alexander–Conway polynomial is actually defined in terms of links, which consist of one or more knots entangled with each other. The concepts explained above for knots, e.g. diagrams and Reidemeister moves, also hold for links.

Consider an oriented link diagram, &quot;i.e.&quot; one in which every component of the link has a preferred direction indicated by an arrow. For a given crossing of the diagram, let formula_23 be the oriented link diagrams resulting from changing the diagram as indicated in the figure: 

The original diagram might be either formula_24 or formula_25, depending on the chosen crossing&#x27;s configuration. Then the Alexander–Conway polynomial, formula_26, is recursively defined according to the rules:

* formula_27 (where formula_28 is any diagram of the unknot)
* formula_29

The second rule is what is often referred to as a skein relation. To check that these rules give an invariant of an oriented link, one should determine that the polynomial does not change under the three Reidemeister moves. Many important knot polynomials can be defined in this way.

The following is an example of a typical computation using a skein relation. It computes the Alexander–Conway polynomial of the trefoil knot. The yellow patches indicate where the relation is applied.

:&quot;C&quot;() = &quot;C&quot;() + &quot;z&quot; &quot;C&quot;()

gives the unknot and the Hopf link. Applying the relation to the Hopf link where indicated,

:&quot;C&quot;() = &quot;C&quot;() + &quot;z&quot; &quot;C&quot;()

gives a link deformable to one with 0 crossings (it is actually the unlink of two components) and an unknot. The unlink takes a bit of sneakiness:

:&quot;C&quot;() = &quot;C&quot;() + &quot;z&quot; &quot;C&quot;()

which implies that &quot;C&quot;(unlink of two components) = 0, since the first two polynomials are of the unknot and thus equal.

Putting all this together will show:

:formula_30

Since the Alexander–Conway polynomial is a knot invariant, this shows that the trefoil is not equivalent to the unknot. So the trefoil really is &quot;knotted&quot;.
Actually, there are two trefoil knots, called the right and left-handed trefoils, which are mirror images of each other (take a diagram of the trefoil given above and change each crossing to the other way to get the mirror image). These are not equivalent to each other, meaning that they are not amphichiral. This was shown by Max Dehn, before the invention of knot polynomials, using group theoretical methods . But the Alexander–Conway polynomial of each kind of trefoil will be the same, as can be seen by going through the computation above with the mirror image. The &quot;Jones&quot; polynomial can in fact distinguish between the left- and right-handed trefoil knots .

===Hyperbolic invariants===
William Thurston proved many knots are hyperbolic knots, meaning that the knot complement (i.e., the set of points of 3-space not on the knot) admits a geometric structure, in particular that of hyperbolic geometry. The hyperbolic structure depends only on the knot so any quantity computed from the hyperbolic structure is then a knot invariant .

Geometry lets us visualize what the inside of a knot or link complement looks like by imagining light rays as traveling along the geodesics of the geometry. An example is provided by the picture of the complement of the Borromean rings. The inhabitant of this link complement is viewing the space from near the red component. The balls in the picture are views of horoball neighborhoods of the link. By thickening the link in a standard way, the horoball neighborhoods of the link components are obtained. Even though the boundary of a neighborhood is a torus, when viewed from inside the link complement, it looks like a sphere. Each link component shows up as infinitely many spheres (of one color) as there are infinitely many light rays from the observer to the link component. The fundamental parallelogram (which is indicated in the picture), tiles both vertically and horizontally and shows how to extend the pattern of spheres infinitely.

This pattern, the horoball pattern, is itself a useful invariant. Other hyperbolic invariants include the shape of the fundamental parallelogram, length of shortest geodesic, and volume. Modern knot and link tabulation efforts have utilized these invariants effectively. Fast computers and clever methods of obtaining these invariants make calculating these invariants, in practice, a simple task .

==Higher dimensions==

A knot in three dimensions can be untied when placed in four-dimensional space. This is done by changing crossings. Suppose one strand is behind another as seen from a chosen point. Lift it into the fourth dimension, so there is no obstacle (the front strand having no component there); then slide it forward, and drop it back, now in front. Analogies for the plane would be lifting a string up off the surface, or removing a dot from inside a circle.

In fact, in four dimensions, any non-intersecting closed loop of one-dimensional string is equivalent to an unknot. First &quot;push&quot; the loop into a three-dimensional subspace, which is always possible, though technical to explain.

Four-dimensional space occurs in classical knot theory, however, and an important topic is the study of slice knots and ribbon knots. A notorious open problem asks whether every slice knot is also ribbon.

===Knotting spheres of higher dimension===
Since a knot can be considered topologically a 1-dimensional sphere, the next generalization is to consider a two-dimensional sphere (formula_31) embedded in 4-dimensional Euclidean space (formula_32). Such an embedding is knotted if there is no homeomorphism of formula_32 onto itself taking the embedded 2-sphere to the standard &quot;round&quot; embedding of the 2-sphere. Suspended knots and spun knots are two typical families of such 2-sphere knots.

The mathematical technique called &quot;general position&quot; implies that for a given &quot;n&quot;-sphere in &quot;m&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space, if &quot;m&quot; is large enough (depending on &quot;n&quot;), the sphere should be unknotted. In general, piecewise-linear &quot;n&quot;-spheres form knots only in (&quot;n&quot; + 2)-dimensional space , although this is no longer a requirement for smoothly knotted spheres. In fact, there are smoothly knotted formula_34-spheres in 6&quot;k&quot;-dimensional space; e.g., there is a smoothly knotted 3-sphere in formula_35 . Thus the codimension of a smooth knot can be arbitrarily large when not fixing the dimension of the knotted sphere; however, any smooth &quot;k&quot;-sphere embedded in formula_36 with formula_37 is unknotted. The notion of a knot has further generalisations in mathematics, see: Knot (mathematics), isotopy classification of embeddings.

Every knot in the &quot;n&quot;-sphere formula_38 is the link of a real-algebraic set with isolated singularity in formula_39 .

An &quot;n&quot;-knot is a single formula_38 embedded in formula_41. An &quot;n&quot;-link consists of &quot;k&quot;-copies of formula_38 embedded in formula_41, where &quot;k&quot; is a natural number. Both the formula_44 and the formula_45 cases are well studied, and so is the formula_46 case.

==Adding knots==
Two knots can be added by cutting both knots and joining the pairs of ends. The operation is called the &quot;knot sum&quot;, or sometimes the &quot;connected sum&quot; or &quot;composition&quot; of two knots. This can be formally defined as follows : consider a planar projection of each knot and suppose these projections are disjoint. Find a rectangle in the plane where one pair of opposite sides are arcs along each knot while the rest of the rectangle is disjoint from the knots. Form a new knot by deleting the first pair of opposite sides and adjoining the other pair of opposite sides. The resulting knot is a sum of the original knots. Depending on how this is done, two different knots (but no more) may result. This ambiguity in the sum can be eliminated regarding the knots as &quot;oriented&quot;, i.e. having a preferred direction of travel along the knot, and requiring the arcs of the knots in the sum are oriented consistently with the oriented boundary of the rectangle.

The knot sum of oriented knots is commutative and associative. A knot is &quot;prime&quot; if it is non-trivial and cannot be written as the knot sum of two non-trivial knots. A knot that can be written as such a sum is &quot;composite&quot;. There is a prime decomposition for knots, analogous to prime and composite numbers . For oriented knots, this decomposition is also unique. Higher-dimensional knots can also be added but there are some differences. While you cannot form the unknot in three dimensions by adding two non-trivial knots, you can in higher dimensions, at least when one considers &quot;smooth&quot; knots in codimension at least 3.

Knots can also be constructed using the circuit topology approach. This is done by combining basic units called soft contacts using five operations (Parallel, Series, Cross, Concerted, and Sub). The approach is applicable to open chains as well and can also be extended to include the so-called hard contacts.

==Tabulating knots==

Traditionally, knots have been catalogued in terms of crossing number. Knot tables generally include only prime knots, and only one entry for a knot and its mirror image (even if they are different) . The number of nontrivial knots of a given crossing number increases rapidly, making tabulation computationally difficult . Tabulation efforts have succeeded in enumerating over 6 billion knots and links . The sequence of the number of prime knots of a given crossing number, up to crossing number 16, is 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 21, 49, 165, 552, 2176, 9988, , , ... . While exponential upper and lower bounds for this sequence are known, it has not been proven that this sequence is strictly increasing .

The first knot tables by Tait, Little, and Kirkman used knot diagrams, although Tait also used a precursor to the Dowker notation. Different notations have been invented for knots which allow more efficient tabulation .

The early tables attempted to list all knots of at most 10 crossings, and all alternating knots of 11 crossings . The development of knot theory due to Alexander, Reidemeister, Seifert, and others eased the task of verification and tables of knots up to and including 9 crossings were published by Alexander–Briggs and Reidemeister in the late 1920s.

The first major verification of this work was done in the 1960s by John Horton Conway, who not only developed a new notation but also the Alexander–Conway polynomial . This verified the list of knots of at most 11 crossings and a new list of links up to 10 crossings. Conway found a number of omissions but only one duplication in the Tait–Little tables; however he missed the duplicates called the Perko pair, which would only be noticed in 1974 by Kenneth Perko . This famous error would propagate when Dale Rolfsen added a knot table in his influential text, based on Conway&#x27;s work. Conway&#x27;s 1970 paper on knot theory also contains a typographical duplication on its non-alternating 11-crossing knots page and omits 4 examples — 2 previously listed in D. Lombardero&#x27;s 1968 Princeton senior thesis and 2 more subsequently discovered by Alain Caudron. [see Perko (1982), Primality of certain knots, Topology Proceedings] Less famous is the duplicate in his 10 crossing link table: 2.-2.-20.20 is the mirror of 8*-20:-20. [See Perko (2016), Historical highlights of non-cyclic knot theory, J. Knot Theory Ramifications].

In the late 1990s Hoste, Thistlethwaite, and Weeks tabulated all the knots through 16 crossings . In 2003 Rankin, Flint, and Schermann, tabulated the alternating knots through 22 crossings . In 2020 Burton tabulated all prime knots with up to 19 crossings .

===Alexander–Briggs notation===
This is the most traditional notation, due to the 1927 paper of James W. Alexander and Garland B. Briggs and later extended by Dale Rolfsen in his knot table (see image above and List of prime knots). The notation simply organizes knots by their crossing number. One writes the crossing number with a subscript to denote its order amongst all knots with that crossing number. This order is arbitrary and so has no special significance (though in each number of crossings the twist knot comes after the torus knot). Links are written by the crossing number with a superscript to denote the number of components and a subscript to denote its order within the links with the same number of components and crossings. Thus the trefoil knot is notated 31 and the Hopf link is 2. Alexander–Briggs names in the range 10162 to 10166 are ambiguous, due to the discovery of the Perko pair in Charles Newton Little&#x27;s original and subsequent knot tables, and differences in approach to correcting this error in knot tables and other publications created after this point.

===Dowker–Thistlethwaite notation===
The Dowker–Thistlethwaite notation, also called the Dowker notation or code, for a knot is a finite sequence of even integers. The numbers are generated by following the knot and marking the crossings with consecutive integers. Since each crossing is visited twice, this creates a pairing of even integers with odd integers. An appropriate sign is given to indicate over and undercrossing. For example, in this figure the knot diagram has crossings labelled with the pairs (1,6) (3,−12) (5,2) (7,8) (9,−4) and (11,−10). The Dowker–Thistlethwaite notation for this labelling is the sequence: 6, −12, 2, 8, −4, −10. A knot diagram has more than one possible Dowker notation, and there is a well-understood ambiguity when reconstructing a knot from a Dowker–Thistlethwaite notation.

===Conway notation===
The Conway notation for knots and links, named after John Horton Conway, is based on the theory of tangles . The advantage of this notation is that it reflects some properties of the knot or link.

The notation describes how to construct a particular link diagram of the link. Start with a &quot;basic polyhedron&quot;, a 4-valent connected planar graph with no digon regions. Such a polyhedron is denoted first by the number of vertices then a number of asterisks which determine the polyhedron&#x27;s position on a list of basic polyhedra. For example, 10** denotes the second 10-vertex polyhedron on Conway&#x27;s list.

Each vertex then has an algebraic tangle substituted into it (each vertex is oriented so there is no arbitrary choice in substitution). Each such tangle has a notation consisting of numbers and + or − signs.

An example is 1*2 −3 2. The 1* denotes the only 1-vertex basic polyhedron. The 2 −3 2 is a sequence describing the continued fraction associated to a rational tangle. One inserts this tangle at the vertex of the basic polyhedron 1*.

A more complicated example is 8*3.1.2 0.1.1.1.1.1 Here again 8* refers to a basic polyhedron with 8 vertices. The periods separate the notation for each tangle.

Any link admits such a description, and it is clear this is a very compact notation even for very large crossing number. There are some further shorthands usually used. The last example is usually written 8*3:2 0, where the ones are omitted and kept the number of dots excepting the dots at the end. For an algebraic knot such as in the first example, 1* is often omitted.

Conway&#x27;s pioneering paper on the subject lists up to 10-vertex basic polyhedra of which he uses to tabulate links, which have become standard for those links. For a further listing of higher vertex polyhedra, there are nonstandard choices available.

===Gauss code===

Gauss code, similar to the Dowker–Thistlethwaite notation, represents a knot with a sequence of integers. However, rather than every crossing being represented by two different numbers, crossings are labeled with only one number. When the crossing is an overcrossing, a positive number is listed. At an undercrossing, a negative number. For example, the trefoil knot in Gauss code can be given as: 1,−2,3,−1,2,−3

Gauss code is limited in its ability to identify knots. This problem is partially addressed with by the extended Gauss code.

<text>&quot;Nick of Time&quot; is episode 43 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It originally aired on November 18, 1960 on CBS.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
When newlyweds Don and Pat Carter&#x27;s automobile breaks down in Ridgeview, Ohio, en route to New York City, they have lunch at the Busy Bee Cafe while they wait for repairs to be made. The table they sit in has a fortune teller machine on the table that answers yes or no questions for a penny each. Don asks if he is going to get a promotion at work. The card says, &quot;It has been decided in your favor.&quot; Don calls the office and learns he has been promoted to office manager. Don then asks if their car will be fixed in the promised time, and receives the answer, &quot;You may never know.&quot; Questioning the seer on this point produces eerily relevant answers, leading to the prediction that it is unsafe to leave the diner until 3 p.m.

Don stalls for time, but Pat argues that the seer cannot predict the future and convinces him to leave a few minutes before 3, and the couple is almost struck by a car while crossing the street. They return to the café but find another couple at their table. Don has them wait at the counter until the couple has left. Pat remains skeptical, contending that the seer answers in generalities; she feels that Don is creating the links to his questions himself. They go back to the table, where Don asks different questions, including one about their car. The seer answers, &quot;It has already been taken care of,&quot; and the mechanic steps into the diner to say the car is fixed. Don challenges Pat to try it for herself. Although she asks the seer trick questions, the answers are still accurate.

Don wants the seer to tell him where they&#x27;re going to live, but Pat finally tells Don that whether the seer can really tell the future doesn&#x27;t matter, since he is capable of making his own future. Recognizing the truth in what she says, Don apologizes and then announces to the seer that they are leaving to do what they please. After their exit, a distraught older couple enters the diner, sitting at the seer&#x27;s table, and the man asks questions about their fate, increasingly deflated by the answers.

==Closing narration==
==Cast==
* William Shatner as Don S. Carter
* Patricia Breslin as Pat Carter
* Stafford Repp as Mechanic (Lars)
* Guy Wilkerson as Counter Man
* Walter Reed as Man
* Dee Carroll as Woman

==Production notes==

Richard Matheson, writing in &quot;The Twilight Zone Magazine&quot;, said that he wished that Pat Breslin (who played Pat Carter) had been available again to play the wife of Shatner&#x27;s character in the season five episode &quot;Nightmare at 20,000 Feet&quot;.

The street and building seen in this episode are the same as seen in the episode &quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot;. Both episodes feature scenes in which people are almost run over by vehicles on the same street.

The street and building are also visible in the opening scene of the episode &quot;Black Leather Jackets&quot;.

When selecting a record in the jukebox to celebrate his promotion, Don chooses the Glenn Miller version of &quot;American Patrol&quot;.

<text>&quot;The Lateness of the Hour&quot; is episode 44 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It originally aired on December 2, 1960, on CBS. It was one of the six episodes of the second season which was shot on videotape in a short-lived experiment aimed to cut costs.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Jana, the sensitive daughter of a creative genius, Dr. William Loren, is distraught over her parents&#x27; reliance on her father&#x27;s five seemingly perfect servants. After Jana pushes one of the maids down the stairs, the maid then gets up without injury, being a robot built by Dr. Loren, complete with programmed memories and personalities. Jana feels trapped, and wishes to go out; her father believes he is protecting her from the outside world, keeping the windows permanently shut.

She implores her father to dismantle the robots before he and her mother become completely dependent on them. Dr. Loren feels that doing so would destroy his work, which he believes is a form of life. He eventually gives in to save his relationship with his daughter, and orders the robots to his basement workshop, where they are to wait to be disassembled. The machines protest, asking how their service was substandard; Dr. Loren again orders them downstairs.

Once the robots are gone, Jana is thrilled and begins looking forward to a new life with traveling, socializing, romance, and children. Her parents react strangely to these happy tidings, and this, combined with realizing that the family photo album contains no pictures of her as a child, prompts Jana to arrive at the shocking awareness that she is a robot. Like the servants, all of her memories were created by Dr. Loren.

Dr. Loren tries to explain that he and his wife were childless and wanted someone to love, and that they see her as their daughter. Jana is convinced that she was built not to be a beloved daughter, but to be merely a prop. She exclaims &quot;I&#x27;m a machine&quot; and repeatedly bangs her arm against a railing while yelling &quot;No pain!&quot; She becomes conscious of the fact that she cannot even feel love. This discovery causes Jana such anguish that her &quot;father&quot; recognizes it is not possible for her to go on this way. At some point later, the Lorens are seen relaxing as before, but it is revealed that Dr. Loren has erased Jana&#x27;s identity and memory and now utilizes her as a replacement for the maid known as Nelda, who gave Mrs. Loren daily shoulder massages.

==Production==
&quot;The Lateness of the Hour&quot; was one of six &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episodes shot on videotape instead of film in an attempt to cut costs. By November 1960 &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;&#x27;s season two had already broadcast five episodes and finished filming sixteen. However, at a cost of about $65,000 per episode, the show was exceeding its budget. As a result, six consecutive episodes (production code #173-3662 through #173-3667) were videotaped at CBS Television City and eventually transferred to 16-millimeter film [&quot;kinescoped&quot;] for syndicated rebroadcasts. Total savings on editing and cinematography amounted to only about $30,000 for all six entries, not enough to justify the loss of depth of visual perspective, which made the shows look like stage-bound live TV dramas (such as &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, which was also produced at CBS), or even daytime soap operas, which, at the time, were quickly and cheaply produced live on one or two sets. The experiment was deemed a failure and never attempted again.

<text>&quot;The Trouble with Templeton&quot; is episode 45 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; starring Brian Aherne, Pippa Scott and Sydney Pollack. The episode originally aired on December 9, 1960 on CBS.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Aging Broadway actor Booth Templeton is at home, watching his much-younger wife, Doris, flirting with a gigolo by the pool. Booth notes that he hasn&#x27;t achieved any contentment with his wife and reminisces about the happiness he had with his first wife, Laura, who died after seven years of marriage. Booth leaves to attend the first rehearsal of his new play, where he learns the director has been replaced. The new director, Arthur Willis, shows no respect for the experienced Booth and questions his commitment to the play.

Pressured and desperately unhappy, Booth runs out the stage door and discovers he has been transported back 30 years to the early days of his career. A stagehand informs him that his wife, Laura, is waiting for him at the speakeasy around the corner. He finds her there, flirting with a much younger man, Barney. Laura is cavalier toward Booth, and in his frustration, he snatches a script Laura uses to fan herself and implores Laura to appreciate their life together. Laura rebuffs all Booth&#x27;s attempts at conversation, laughing at him with Barney, and eventually she tells Booth to leave. As he does so, everyone in the speakeasy stops and looks on with slight sadness, the music stops, and the room grows dark.

Booth runs back into the theater and the present. He fans himself with Laura&#x27;s script, and notices that it is for a play titled &quot;What to Do When Booth Comes Back&quot;. Booth sees that ghosts from his past were not mocking him but actually had staged a performance for him in order to break him free from his paralyzing nostalgia and longing for the old days. Realizing that Laura loved him and didn’t want him to be stuck in the past, Booth returns to the rehearsal, asserts himself, dismisses the producer of the play and tells director Willis that he will no longer tolerate any invalidation. Commanding the respect that is his due as a distinguished actor, Booth begins to live happily in the present time with a new future.

<text>&quot;A Most Unusual Camera&quot; is episode 46 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, and was the tenth episode of the second season. It originally aired on December 16, 1960 on CBS, and was an episode written by the show&#x27;s creator, Rod Serling. The episode starred Fred Clark and Jean Carson. The episode was produced for season one of the show, but was delayed to season two.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Two thieves, husband and wife Chester and Paula Diedrich, have just robbed an antique shop and returned to the hotel suite they are using as a hideout. Chester dismisses most of the items they have stolen as junk, but finds a strange old box camera among them. When he takes a picture of Paula, it generates a self-developing photo of her wearing a fur coat. After she finds one inside a stolen chest and puts it on, the pair realize that the camera&#x27;s pictures show the immediate future of its subjects. Its next picture accurately predicts the arrival of Paula&#x27;s brother Woodward, who had just escaped from prison.

A televised horse race gives Chester the idea to take a picture of the blank winners&#x27; board at the local track before each of the day&#x27;s races are run, then place bets based on the pictures&#x27; results. After winning thousands of dollars, they celebrate in their suite, where a waiter named Pierre takes notice of their camera and translates its French inscription &quot;dix à la propriétaire&quot; as &quot;ten to an owner&quot;. Once Chester ushers Pierre out, he determines that the trio have taken a total of eight pictures. As they struggle over the camera, arguing about how to use the final two, they accidentally take a picture that shows a terrified Paula. Chester and Woodward continue their fight, but fall out an open window to their deaths. Paula reacts as in the picture, but calms down once she realizes that she can now keep all the money for herself.

She snaps the tenth and final picture of the two bodies and prepares to leave, only to be interrupted by Pierre. Having learned of her status as a wanted criminal, he robs her and threatens to turn her in to the police if she calls them for help. Glancing at the picture, he remarks that it shows more than two bodies in the courtyard below. Paula rushes to the window to check, but trips on an electrical cord and falls out of it to her demise. Pierre counts the corpses in the picture, but notices that there are four instead of three. Shocked, he drops the camera and falls out the window as well.

<text>&quot;Back There&quot; is episode 49 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It originally aired on January 13, 1961 on CBS, and was the 13th episode of the second season. It was written by series creator Rod Serling and was directed by David Orrick McDearmon. It involves time travel, and stars Russell Johnson, who had appeared in another time-travel episode the previous season.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
On April 14, 1961, young engineer Peter Corrigan is involved in a discussion with colleagues at the elite Potomac Club on the question of time travel. After bumping into William, a familiar attendant, on the way out, Peter feels faint. Confused by the gas lamps and horse-drawn carriages on the street, he notices that he&#x27;s wearing clothes of a much older style and walks home. He finds that his home is now a boarding house. In discussion with the strangers he meets there, he discovers that he has been transported back in time to April 14, 1865, the date of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth.

Corrigan rushes to Ford&#x27;s Theatre to warn everyone but is arrested for disturbing the peace. Only one officer believes Corrigan, but is overruled by his superior. After he has been held in the police station a short time, a man who states he is a doctor with expertise in mental illness arrives. He introduces himself as Jonathan Wellington and persuades the police to release Corrigan into his custody. Wellington subsequently drugs Corrigan, before leaving and locking the door. Wellington is later identified by the landlady as Booth, which is confirmed by a handkerchief he left behind bearing the initials &quot;JWB&quot;; meanwhile outside the news is spreading that the president has just been shot.

Corrigan pounds his fist on a window sill angry that no one listened and finds he is back in 1961 at the Potomac Club. It seems the same, but there is no longer an attendant named William. Back at the table with his colleagues, he finds that the scholarly discussion has moved from time travel to money, and William is also at the table participating. William says that his money was inherited from his great-grandfather, a policeman who had made a name for himself by predicting the assassination of Lincoln, becoming Chief of Police, then a councilman, and eventually becoming a millionaire through real estate. Corrigan&#x27;s disbelief is amplified further by the &quot;JWB&quot; handkerchief he had placed in his pocket. He had in fact changed the past, but not in the way he had intended.

<text>&quot;The Whole Truth&quot; is episode 50 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It originally aired on January 20, 1961 on CBS, on the same day in which John Fitzgerald Kennedy took office as President of the United States of America. It was one of the six episodes of the second season that was shot on videotape in a short-lived experiment aimed to cut costs.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
The dealership of glib used-car salesman Harvey Hunnicut is visited by a mild-mannered elderly gentleman who offers to sell his vintage Ford Model A car for a very low price. Though curious, Harvey accepts it, and only after the paperwork is signed and the ownership transferred does the older man admit that the antique Ford is haunted. Laughing this off, Hunnicut accepts the car, intending to quickly unload it.

To his dismay, he realizes that he is no longer able to lie. He tells a young couple, prospective buyers, that all the cars on his lot are lemons and they should buy from a respectable dealership instead. When explaining to his wife why he&#x27;s going to be home late, he openly states that he intends to play poker with his friends, which is what he always does when he tells her he is &quot;doing inventory&quot;. When Irv, his employee, asks about the raise he was promised, Harvey confesses he always strings his workers along without ever giving raises. Irv punches out Harvey and quits.

Hunnicut concludes that his livelihood depends on his ability to rid himself of this supernatural burden. He&#x27;s visited by Honest Luther Grimbley, a politician running for reelection, who shows interest in the haunted car despite its flaws. He nearly buys it, but Harvey is compelled to tell him about the car&#x27;s curse, and Grimbley openly admits that he&#x27;d lose his job if he couldn&#x27;t lie. When Harvey&#x27;s brutally honest answer about the rest of the cars on the lot convinces Grimbley that the curse is real, he suggests selling the car to someone else who made a living on lies, showing him a newspaper story about the U.S. playing host to visiting Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. Surmising that, like every totalitarian state, the Soviet Union owes its existence to a tissue of lies, Hunnicut calls the Soviet embassy and convinces its representatives to visit his dealership. By being absolutely half-truthful, he sells the car as a potential anti-American propaganda tool, exemplifying shoddy, outdated U.S. automobile workmanship.

By the concluding scene, it seems that Hunnicut is about to change the course of history because the passenger watching the sale from the embassy limousine now has his name on paper as the haunted vehicle&#x27;s owner. It appears to be none other than Khrushchev. Hunnicut telephones Washington, asking if he could possibly get in touch with &quot;Jack Kennedy&quot;.

==Closing narration==
==Cast==
* Jack Carson as Harvey Hunnicut
* Loring Smith as Honest Luther Grimbley
* George Chandler as car-selling old man
* Jack Ging as young car buyer
* Nan Peterson as young car buyer&#x27;s wife
* Arte Johnson as Irv
* Patrick Westwood as the premier&#x27;s aide
* Lee Sabinson as the premier

==Production==
&quot;The Whole Truth&quot; was one of six &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episodes shot on videotape instead of film in an attempt to cut costs. By November 1960, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;″s season two had already broadcast five episodes and finished filming 16. However, at a cost of about $65,000 per episode, the show was exceeding its budget. As a result, six consecutive episodes (production code #173-3662 through #173-3667) were videotaped at CBS Television City and eventually transferred to 16-millimeter film [&quot;kinescoped&quot;] for syndicated rebroadcasts. Total savings on editing and cinematography amounted to around $30,000 for all six entries, not enough to justify the loss of depth of visual perspective, which made the shows look like stage-bound live TV dramas (e.g. &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, also produced at CBS). The experiment was deemed a failure and never attempted again.

John F. Kennedy was sworn in as the 35th president of the United States hours before this episode originally aired. Jack Carson&#x27;s final line was one of the rare times that a current president was actually mentioned during an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

In &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; radio drama adaption of this episode, the character of the Soviet premier was replaced with an emir from the Middle East.

<text>&quot;The Invaders&quot; is episode 15 of season 2 (and episode 51 overall) of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. The episode, which originally aired January 27, 1961, starred Agnes Moorehead. It was written by Richard Matheson, directed by Douglas Heyes, and scored by Jerry Goldsmith. Distinctive features of this episode include a near-solo performance by one character (interacting with miniature puppet &quot;characters&quot;), and an almost complete lack of dialogue. The only dialogue in the entire episode aside from Rod Serling&#x27;s usual narration came from Douglas Heyes, the episode&#x27;s director. In addition, this is the only episode in which Rod Serling gives his opening monologue at the start of the prologue, rather than the end. The protagonist portrayed by Agnes Moorehead often cries out in pain and terror, but never speaks.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
A shabbily-dressed old woman lives alone in a remote cabin with no modern conveniences. After hearing a strange, deafening noise above her kitchen, she is accosted by two tiny figures, which appear to be robots or beings wearing pressure suits, small intruders that come from a miniature flying saucer that has landed on her roof.

They attack the woman with small pistol-like weapons that leave radiation burns on her skin. They follow her into her cabin and slash her ankle and hand using her kitchen knife. She eventually is able to wrap one in a blanket and beat it until it is still, then throws it into the burning fireplace. She follows the other to her roof and attacks the saucer-ship with a hatchet.

All this has taken place in silence, but a voice (director Douglas Heyes) is heard speaking in English from within the craft. The intruder frantically warns that his partner, Gresham, is dead; and that the planet is inhabited by a race of giants impossible to defeat. The ship is marked &quot;U.S. Air Force Space Probe No. 1&quot;. The invaders were astronauts from Earth; the woman in the small farmhouse belongs to a race of humanoids native to another planet. She destroys the ship and then climbs back down from the roof into the house, exhausted.

==Closing narration==
==On radio==
When the episode was adapted for the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; radio dramas, starring Kathy Garver, the story was changed from an old non-speaking woman to an elderly couple.

<text>&quot;A Penny for Your Thoughts&quot; is episode 52 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, written by George Clayton Johnson. It originally aired on February 3, 1961, on CBS.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Hector B. Poole is a sensitive, insecure bank clerk. On the way to work he tosses a coin into a vendor&#x27;s open box to pay for a newspaper, and it miraculously lands on its edge. Suddenly he can hear other people&#x27;s thoughts, but does not know what&#x27;s going on. Distracted, he is nearly hit by a car, and is confused when he hears the driver expressing concern while thinking angrily about Hector&#x27;s carelessness.

At his place of business, Hector is finalizing the paperwork for a $200,000 loan to a businessman named Sykes, he hears Sykes thinking about using the money for a run at the horse track to win back money he has embezzled from his company. Hector challenges Sykes, who accuses him of lying and withdraws his business from the bank, to the boss Bagby&#x27;s annoyance.

Next Hector hears an old, trusted employee, Smithers, thinking about how he will steal cash from the bank and escape to Bermuda. He takes Helen Turner, a co-worker who thinks affectionate thoughts about him, fully into his confidence; she doesn&#x27;t believe in his powers, but urges him to tell Bagby about Smithers. Hector does, saying he overheard Smithers; incredulous at first, Bagby decides to investigate Smithers. Smithers proves to be innocent, and Bagby fires Hector. Smithers then privately admits to Hector that he has fantasized for years about theft, but never goes through with it.

Hector vents his unhappiness to Helen: he&#x27;s learned more than he wanted to know about the disconnect between people&#x27;s thoughts and actions. Bagby learns that Sykes has been arrested for gambling with company money, and offers to reinstate Hector. Using blackmail based on knowledge of an affair his boss is having, Hector gets his job back, a raise, and a Bermuda vacation for Smithers.

After work, as Hector returns home with Helen, he returns to the newsstand, where his coin is still standing. Buying an afternoon paper, he knocks it over, and then finds his mind-reading ability gone. He leaves the newsstand with Helen, hopeful about the future.

<doc id="153018" wikidata="Q3155307" url="?curid=153018" title="The Night of the Meek (The Twilight Zone, 1959)">
<text>&quot;The Night of the Meek&quot; is episode 47 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It originally aired on December 23, 1960, on CBS. It was one of the six episodes of the second season which were shot on videotape in a short-lived experiment aimed to cut costs.

==Introductory scene/opening narration==
As snow begins to fall, a drunk Henry Corwin, wearing his Santa Claus suit, stumbles and half-falls at a curbside lamppost. He is approached by two tenement children pleading for toys, a Christmas dinner, and &quot;a job for my daddy.&quot; As Corwin begins to sob, the camera turns to Rod Serling standing on the sidewalk:

==Plot==
On Christmas Eve, Corwin arrives for his seasonal job as a department-store Santa an hour late and obviously drunk. When customers complain, Dundee, the manager, fires him and orders him off the premises. Corwin says that he drinks because he lives in a rooming house with the poor, for whom he is incapable of fulfilling his role as Santa. He declares that if he had just one wish granted him on Christmas Eve, he&#x27;d &quot;like to see the meek inherit the earth.&quot;

Still in his outfit, he returns to the bar but is refused re-entry by Bruce. Stumbling into an alley, he hears sleigh bells. A cat knocks down a large burlap bag full of empty cans, but when Corwin trips over it, it is now filled with gift-wrapped packages. Overjoyed at his sudden ability to fulfill dreams, Corwin proceeds to hand out presents to passing children and then to derelict men attending Christmas Eve service at a mission house. Irritated by the disruption, the proprietress goes outside to fetch Officer Flaherty.

Flaherty takes Corwin to the police station on suspicion of theft. Dundee meets them at the station, where he and Flaherty find empty cans in Corwin&#x27;s sack. Angry at having his time wasted, Dundee accuses Flaherty of incompetence; when Dundee challenges Corwin to produce a bottle of cherry brandy, vintage 1903, Corwin does just that, and is set free. He continues to distribute gifts until midnight, when the bag is empty.

A man named Burt, whose desired pipe and smoking jacket comes from Corwin&#x27;s bag, points out that Corwin himself has not received a gift. Corwin says that if he had his choice of any gift at all, &quot;I think I&#x27;d wish I could do this every year.&quot; Returning to the alley where the gift-laden bag had presented itself, he encounters an elf sitting in a large reindeer-hauled sleigh, waiting for him. Realizing that his wish has come true and he is now the real Santa Claus, Corwin sits in the sleigh and sets off with the elf.

Emerging drunkenly from the precinct, Flaherty and Dundee look upward upon hearing bells and see Corwin ascending into the night sky. Dundee invites Flaherty to accompany him home and share some hot coffee, with brandy poured in it, adding, &quot;...and we&#x27;ll thank God for miracles, Flaherty...&quot; The episode ends with a shot of the bag sitting next to the trash can Corwin originally found it in.

==Closing narration==
The original narration, on December 23, 1960, ended with the words, &quot;and a Merry Christmas, to each and all&quot;, but that phrase was deleted in the 1980s and is now excluded from reruns, VHS releases and the five-DVD set &quot;The Twilight Zone: The Definitive Edition&quot;. The phrase is heard in the Blu-ray release of Season 2 as well as the version streamed by Netflix and Paramount Plus, but with noticeably different sound quality from the rest of Serling&#x27;s narration. As broadcast on the MeTV Network on Christmas Day 2019 and thereafter, the last line has been restored in syndication.

==Production==
&quot;The Night of the Meek&quot; was one of six &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episodes shot on videotape instead of film in an attempt to cut costs. By November 1960 &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;&#x27;s season two had already broadcast five episodes and finished filming sixteen. However, at a cost of about $65,000 per episode, the show was exceeding its budget. As a result, six consecutive episodes (production code #173-3662 through #173-3667) were videotaped at CBS Television City and eventually transferred to 16-millimeter film [&quot;kinescoped&quot;] for syndicated rebroadcasts. Total savings on editing and cinematography amounted to only about $30,000 for all six entries, not enough to justify the loss of depth of visual perspective, which made the shows look like stage-bound live TV dramas (such as &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, which was also produced at CBS), or even daytime soap operas, which, at the time, were quickly and cheaply produced live on one or two sets. The experiment was deemed a failure and never attempted again.

* Nan Peterson&#x27;s three other appearances are in &quot;Walking Distance&quot;, &quot;The Whole Truth&quot;, and &quot;From Agnes—With Love&quot;

<text>&quot;Dust&quot; is episode 48 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It originally aired on January 6, 1961, on CBS, and was the 12th episode of the second season. The episode was written by series creator Rod Serling, and was directed by Douglas Heyes. It starred Thomas Gomez in his second appearance on the show following &quot;Escape Clause&quot;, as well as Vladimir Sokoloff, in the first of his three appearances on the series. It is one of the few episodes that does not contain any fantasy or science-fiction elements.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
In the Old West, in a desolate barren town, the sadistic and unscrupulous peddler Sykes mocks Luis Gallegos, who is due to be hanged. Luis is guilty of driving drunk and accidentally killing a child. Luis&#x27; father arrives in the village and pleads with the mother and father of the dead girl to spare his son the hanging. His pleas fall on deaf ears. After selling the executioner some five-strand rope needed for the hanging, Sykes sells a bag of dust to the condemned man&#x27;s father, collecting ordinary dirt from the ground and insisting that it is magic dust that will spread good will throughout the crowd and make them feel love and sympathy for Luis.

As the crowd gathers for the hanging, Luis&#x27; father cries out and starts sprinkling the dust everywhere. He hears the trapdoor drop behind him and turns to see that the fresh and sturdy rope has snapped above the noose, and Luis is unharmed. When asked if another hanging attempt should be made, the girl&#x27;s parents decide that it should not, that Luis has suffered enough and maybe they have had a sign from God. As father and son walk home, Sykes rechecks the rope which appears to be in perfect condition. Then he throws his gold pieces from the sale of the dust to the poor children of the town, insisting that they have them. He walks away from the scene bemused, stating that the dust must have been magic after all.

<doc id="153021" wikidata="Q145665" url="?curid=153021" title="Manchu people">
<text>The Manchus (; ) are a Tungusic East Asian ethnic group native to Manchuria in Northeast Asia. They are an officially recognized ethnic minority in China and the people from whom Manchuria derives its name. The Later Jin (1616–1636) and Qing (1636–1912) dynasties of China were established and ruled by the Manchus, who are descended from the Jurchen people who earlier established the Jin dynasty (1115–1234) in northern China.

Manchus form the largest branch of the Tungusic peoples and are distributed throughout China, forming the fourth largest ethnic group in the country. They are found in 31 Chinese provincial regions. Among them, Liaoning has the largest population and Hebei, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Inner Mongolia and Beijing have over 100,000 Manchu residents. About half of the population live in Liaoning and one-fifth in Hebei. There are a number of Manchu autonomous counties in China, such as Xinbin, Xiuyan, Qinglong, Fengning, Yitong, Qingyuan, Weichang, Kuancheng, Benxi, Kuandian, Huanren, Fengcheng, Beizhen and over 300 Manchu towns and townships. Manchus are the largest minority group in China without an autonomous region.

==Name==
&quot;Manchu&quot; (, ) was adopted as the official name of the people by Emperor Hong Taiji in 1635, replacing the earlier name &quot;Jurchen&quot;. It appears that &quot;manju&quot; was an old term for the Jianzhou Jurchens, although the etymology is not well understood. The Chinese characters chosen to translate the Manchu name are 滿洲 which, like the character for &quot;Qing&quot; (清), have the water component. Some speculate that this was done because the Ming dynasty&#x27;s name (明), which means &quot;bright&quot;, represents fire, and water extinguishes fire.

The &quot;Jiu Manzhou Dang&quot;, archives of early 17th century documents, contains the earliest use of Manchu. However, the actual etymology of the ethnic name &quot;Manju&quot; is debatable. According to the Qing dynasty&#x27;s official historical record, the &quot;Researches on Manchu Origins&quot;, the ethnic name came from Mañjuśrī. The Qianlong Emperor also supported the point of view and even wrote several poems on the subject.

Meng Sen, a scholar of the Qing dynasty, agreed. On the other hand, he thought the name &quot;Manchu&quot; might stem from Li Manzhu (), the chieftain of the Jianzhou Jurchens.

Another scholar, Chang Shan, thinks Manju is a compound word. &quot;Man&quot; was from the word &quot;mangga&quot; () which means &quot;strong&quot;, and &quot;ju&quot; () means &quot;arrow&quot;. So &quot;Manju&quot; actually means &quot;intrepid arrow&quot;.

There are other hypotheses, such as Fu Sinian&#x27;s &quot;etymology of Jianzhou&quot;; Zhang Binglin&#x27;s &quot;etymology of Manshi&quot;; &quot;etymology of Wuji and Mohe&quot;; Sun Wenliang&#x27;s &quot;etymology of Manzhe&quot;; &quot;etymology of mangu(n) river&quot; and so on.

An extensive etymological study from 2022 lends additional support to the view that &quot;manju&quot; is cognate with words referring to the lower Amur river in other Tungusic languages and can be reconstructed to Proto-Tungusic *&quot;mamgo&quot; &#x27;lower Amur, large river&#x27;.

== History ==
=== Origins and early history ===


The Manchus are descended from the Jurchen people who earlier established the Jin dynasty (1115–1234) in China. The name Mohe might refer to an ancestral population of the Manchus. The Mohe practiced pig farming extensively and were mainly sedentary, and also used both pig and dog skins for coats. They were predominantly farmers and grew soybeans, wheat, millet and rice, in addition to hunting.

In the 10th century AD, the term Jurchen first appeared in documents of the late Tang dynasty in reference to the state of Balhae in present-day northeastern China. The Jurchens were sedentary, settled farmers with advanced agriculture. They farmed grain and millet as their cereal crops, grew flax, and raised oxen, pigs, sheep and horses. Their farming way of life was very different from the pastoral nomadism of the Mongols and the Khitans on the steppes. Most Jurchens raised pigs and stock animals and were farmers.

In 1019, Jurchen pirates raided Japan for slaves. Fujiwara Notada, the Japanese governor, was killed. In total, 1,280 Japanese were taken prisoner, 374 Japanese were killed, and 380 Japanese-owned livestock were killed for food. Only 259 or 270 were returned by Koreans from the 8 ships. The woman Uchikura no Ishime&#x27;s report was copied down. Traumatic memories of the Jurchen raids on Japan in the 1019 Toi invasion, the Mongol invasions of Japan in addition to Japan viewing the Jurchens as &quot;Tatar&quot; &quot;barbarians&quot; after copying China&#x27;s barbarian-civilized distinction, may have played a role in Japan&#x27;s antagonistic views against Manchus and hostility towards them in later centuries such as when Tokugawa Ieyasu viewed the unification of Manchu tribes as a threat to Japan. The Japanese mistakenly thought that Hokkaido (Ezochi) had a land bridge to Tartary (Orankai) where Manchus lived and thought the Manchus could invade Japan. The Tokugawa Shogunate bakufu sent a message to Korea via Tsushima offering help to Korea against the 1627 Manchu invasion of Korea. Korea declined the help.

Following the fall of Balhae, the Jurchens became vassals of the Khitan-led Liao dynasty. The Jurchens in the Yalu River region were tributaries of Goryeo since the reign of Wang Geon, who called upon them during the wars of the Later Three Kingdoms period, but the Jurchens switched allegiance between Liao and Goryeo multiple times, taking advantage of the tension between the two nations; posing a potential threat to Goryeo&#x27;s border security, the Jurchens offered tribute to the Goryeo court, expecting lavish gifts in return. Before the Jurchens overthrew the Khitan, married Jurchen women and Jurchen girls were raped by Liao Khitan envoys as a custom which caused resentment. The Jurchens and their Manchu descendants had Khitan linguistic and grammatical elements in their personal names like suffixes. Many Khitan names had a &quot;ju&quot; suffix. In the year 1114, Wanyan Aguda united the Jurchen tribes and established the Jin dynasty (1115–1234). His brother and successor, Wanyan Wuqimai defeated the Liao dynasty. After the fall of the Liao dynasty, the Jurchens went to war with the Northern Song dynasty, and captured most of northern China in the Jin–Song wars. During the Jin dynasty, the first Jurchen script came into use in the 1120s. It was mainly derived from the Khitan script.

In 1206, the Mongols, vassals to the Jurchens, rose in Mongolia. Their leader, Genghis Khan, led Mongol troops against the Jurchens, who were finally defeated by Ögedei Khan in 1234. The Jurchen Jin emperor Wanyan Yongji&#x27;s daughter, Jurchen Princess Qiguo was married to Mongol leader Genghis Khan in exchange for relieving the Mongol siege upon Zhongdu (Beijing) in the Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty. The Yuan grouped people into different categories based on how recently their state surrendered to the Yuan. Subjects of the southern Song were classified as southerners (nan ren) and also referred to as manzi. Subjects of the Jin dynasty, Western Xia, and the kingdom of Dali in Yunnan in southern China were categorized as northerners, using the term Han. However, the use of the word Han as the name of a class category by the Yuan dynasty was a different concept from Han ethnicity. 

The grouping of Jurchens in northern China with northern Han into the northerner class did not imply that they were considered the same as ethnic Han people. Ethnic Han people themselves were divided into two different classes in the Yuan, Han ren and Nan Ren, as noted by Stephen G. Haw. Additionally, the Yuan directive to treat Jurchens the same as Mongols referred to Jurchens and Khitans in the northwest (not the Jurchen homeland in the northeast), presumably in the lands of Qara Khitai, where many Khitans lived. However, it remains a mystery as to how Jurchens were living there. Many Jurchens adopted Mongolian customs, names, and the Mongolian language. As time went on, fewer and fewer Jurchens could recognize their own script. The Jurchen Yehe Nara clan is of paternal Mongol origin.

Many Jurchen families descended from the original Jin Jurchen migrants in Han areas like those using the surnames Wang and Nian 粘 have openly reclaimed their ethnicity and registered as Manchus. Wanyan (完顏) clan members who had changed their surnames to Wang (王) after the Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty applied successfully to the PRC government for their ethnic group to be marked as Manchu despite never having been part of the Eight Banner system at all during the Qing dynasty. The surname Nianhan (粘罕), shortened to Nian (粘) is a Jurchen origin surname, also originating from one of the members of the royal Wanyan clan. It is an extremely rare surname in China, and 1,100 members of the Nian clan live in Nan&#x27;an, Quanzhou, they live in Licheng district of Quanzhou, 900 in Jinjiang, Quanzhou, 40 in Shishi city of Quanzhou, and 500 in Quanzhou city itself in Fujian, and just over 100 people in Xiamen, Jin&#x27;an district of Fuzhou, Zhangpu and Sanming, as well as 1000 in Laiyang, Shandong, and 1,000 in Kongqiao and Wujiazhuang in Xingtai, Hebei. Some of the Nian from Quanzhou immigrated to Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia. In Taiwan they are concentrated in Lukang township and Changhua city of Changhua county as well as in Dingnien village, Xianne village Fuxing township of Changhua county. There are less than 30,000 members of the Nian clan worldwide, with 9,916 of them in Taiwan, and 3,040 of those in Fuxing township of Changhua county and its most common in Dingnian village.

During the transition between the Ming and Qing dynasties, Zhang Sunzhen, a civilian official in Nanjing, remarked that he had a portrait of his ancestors wearing Manchu clothes because his family were Tartars. Therefore, he considered it appropriate that he was going to shave his head into the Manchu hairstyle when the queue order was given.

The Mongol-led Yuan dynasty was replaced by the Ming dynasty in 1368. In 1387, Ming forces defeated the Mongol commander Naghachu&#x27;s resisting forces who settled in the Haixi area and began to summon the Jurchen tribes to pay tribute. At the time, some Jurchen clans were vassals to the Joseon dynasty of Korea such as Odoli and Huligai. Their elites served in the Korean royal bodyguard.

The Joseon Koreans tried to deal with the military threat posed by the Jurchen by using both forceful means and incentives, and by launching military attacks. At the same time they tried to appease them with titles and degrees, traded with them, and sought to acculturate them by having Jurchens integrate into Korean culture. Their relationship was eventually stopped by the Ming dynasty government who wanted the Jurchens to protect the border. In 1403, Ahacu, chieftain of Huligai, paid tribute to the Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty. Soon after that, Möngke Temür, chieftain of the Odoli clan of the Jianzhou Jurchens, defected from paying tribute to Korea, becoming a tributary state to China instead.

Yi Seong-gye, the Taejo of Joseon, asked the Ming Empire to send Möngke Temür back but was refused. The Yongle Emperor was determined to remove the Jurchens from Korean influence and assert Chinese dominance over them instead. Korea tried to persuade Möngke Temür to reject the Ming overtures, but was unsuccessful, and Möngke Temür submitted to the Ming Empire. Since then, more and more Jurchen tribes presented tribute to the Ming Empire in succession. The Ming divided them into 384 guards, and the Jurchen became vassals to the Ming Empire. During the Ming dynasty, the name for the Jurchen land was Nurgan. The Jurchens became part of the Ming dynasty&#x27;s Nurgan Regional Military Commission under the Yongle Emperor, with Ming forces erecting the Yongning Temple Stele in 1413, at the headquarters of Nurgan. The stele was inscribed in Chinese, Jurchen, Mongolian, and Tibetan.

In 1449, Mongol taishi Esen attacked the Ming Empire and captured the Zhengtong Emperor in Tumu. Some Jurchen guards in Jianzhou and Haixi cooperated with Esen&#x27;s action, but more were attacked in the Mongol invasion. Many Jurchen chieftains lost their hereditary certificates granted by the Ming government. They had to present tribute as secretariats () with less reward from the Ming court than in the time when they were heads of guards – an unpopular development. Subsequently, more and more Jurchens recognised the Ming Empire&#x27;s declining power due to Esen&#x27;s invasion. The Zhengtong Emperor&#x27;s capture directly caused Jurchen guards to go out of control. Tribal leaders, such as Cungšan and , brazenly plundered Ming territory. At about this time, the Jurchen script was officially abandoned. More Jurchens adopted Mongolian as their writing language and fewer used Chinese. The final recorded Jurchen writing dates to 1526.

The Manchus are sometimes mistakenly identified as nomadic people. The Manchu way of life (economy) was agricultural, farming crops and raising animals on farms. Manchus practiced slash-and-burn agriculture in the areas north of Shenyang. The Haixi Jurchens were &quot;semi-agricultural, the Jianzhou Jurchens and Maolian () Jurchens were sedentary, while hunting and fishing was the way of life of the &quot;Wild Jurchens&quot;. Han Chinese society resembled that of the sedentary Jianzhou and Maolian, who were farmers. Hunting, archery on horseback, horsemanship, livestock raising, and sedentary agriculture were all part of the Jianzhou Jurchens&#x27; culture. Although Manchus practiced equestrianism and archery on horseback, their immediate progenitors practiced sedentary agriculture. The Manchus also partook in hunting but were sedentary. Their primary mode of production was farming while they lived in villages, forts, and walled towns. Their Jurchen Jin predecessors also practiced farming.

Only the Mongols and the northern &quot;wild&quot; Jurchen were semi-nomadic, unlike the mainstream Jiahnzhou Jurchens descended from the Jin dynasty who were farmers that foraged, hunted, herded, and harvested crops in the Liao and Yalu river basins. They gathered ginseng root, pine nuts, hunted for game pelts in the uplands and forests, raised horses in their stables, and farmed millet and wheat in their fallow fields. They engaged in dances, wrestling, and drinking strong liquor, as noted during midwinter by the Korean Sin Chung-il when it was very cold.

These Jurchens, who lived in the northeast&#x27;s harsh cold climate, sometimes half-sunk their houses in the ground, which they constructed of brick or timber. They surrounded their fortified villages with stone foundations on which they built wattle and mud walls to defend against attacks. Village clusters were ruled by beile, hereditary leaders. They fought each other and dispensed weapons, wives, slaves, and lands to their followers. This was how the Jurchens who founded the Qing dynasty lived and how their ancestors lived before the Jin dynasty.

Alongside Mongols and Jurchen clans, there were migrants from the Liaodong provinces of Ming China and Korea living among these Jurchens in a cosmopolitan manner. Nurhaci, who was hosting Sin Chung-il, was uniting all of them into his own army, having them adopt the Jurchen hairstyle of a long queue and a shaved fore-crown, and wearing leather tunics. His armies had black, blue, red, white, and yellow flags. These became the Eight Banners, initially capped at 4, then growing to 8 with three different types of ethnic banners as Han, Mongol, and Jurchen were recruited into Nurhaci&#x27;s forces.

Jurchens like Nurhaci spoke both their native Tungusic language and Chinese, adopting the Mongol script for their own language, unlike the Jin Jurchens&#x27; Khitan-derived script. They adopted Confucian values and practiced their shamanist traditions.

The Qing stationed the &quot;New Manchu&quot; Warka foragers in Ningguta and attempted to turn them into normal agricultural farmers but then the Warka just reverted to hunter gathering and requested money to buy cattle for beef broth. The Qing wanted the Warka to become soldier-farmers and imposed this on them but the Warka simply left their garrison at Ningguta and went back to the Sungari river to their homes to herd, fish and hunt. The Qing accused them of desertion.

Although their Mohe ancestors did not respect dogs, the Jurchens began to respect dogs around the time of the Ming dynasty, and passed this tradition on to the Manchus. It was prohibited in Jurchen culture to use dog skin, and forbidden for Jurchens to harm, kill, or eat dogs. For political reasons, the Jurchen leader Nurhaci chose variously to emphasize either differences or similarities in lifestyles with other peoples like the Mongols. Nurhaci said to the Mongols that &quot;the languages of the Chinese and Koreans are different, but their clothing and way of life is the same. It is the same with us Manchus (Jušen) and Mongols. Our languages are different, but our clothing and way of life is the same.&quot; Later Nurhaci indicated that the bond with the Mongols was not based in any real shared culture. It was for pragmatic reasons of &quot;mutual opportunism,&quot; since Nurhaci said to the Mongols: &quot;You Mongols raise livestock, eat meat, and wear pelts. My people till the fields and live on grain. We two are not one country and we have different languages.&quot;

=== Manchu rule over China ===

A century after the chaos started in the Jurchen lands, Nurhaci, a chieftain of the Jianzhou Left Guard who officially considered himself a local representative of imperial power of the Ming dynasty, made efforts to unify the Jurchen tribes and established a military system called the &quot;Eight Banners&quot;, which organized Jurchen soldiers into groups of &quot;Bannermen&quot;, and ordered his scholar Erdeni and minister Gagai to create a new Jurchen script (later known as Manchu script) using the traditional Mongolian alphabet as a reference.

When the Jurchens were reorganized by Nurhaci into the Eight Banners, many Manchu clans were artificially created as a group of unrelated people founded a new Manchu clan (mukun) using a geographic origin name such as a toponym for their hala (clan name). The irregularities over Jurchen and Manchu clan origin led to the Qing trying to document and systematize the creation of histories for Manchu clans, including manufacturing an entire legend around the origin of the Aisin-Gioro clan by taking mythology from the northeast.

In 1603, Nurhaci gained recognition as the Sure Kundulen Khan (, &quot;wise and respected khan&quot;) from his Khalkha Mongol allies; then, in 1616, he publicly enthroned himself and issued a proclamation naming himself Genggiyen Khan (, &quot;bright khan&quot;) of the Later Jin dynasty (, 後金). Nurhaci then renounced the Ming overlordship with the Seven Grievances and launched his attack on the Ming dynasty and moved the capital to Mukden after his conquest of Liaodong. In 1635, his son and successor Hong Taiji changed the name of the Jurchen ethnic group () to the Manchu. A year later, Hong Taiji proclaimed himself the emperor of the Qing dynasty (). Factors for the change of name of these people from Jurchen to Manchu include the fact that the term &quot;Jurchen&quot; had negative connotations since the Jurchens had been in a servile position to the Ming dynasty for several hundred years, and it also referred to people of the &quot;dependent class&quot;. The change of the name from Jurchen to Manchu was made to hide the fact that the ancestors of the Manchus, the Jianzhou Jurchens, had been ruled by the Chinese. The Qing dynasty carefully hid the two original editions of the books of &quot;&quot;Qing Taizu Wu Huangdi Shilu&quot; and the &quot;Manzhou Shilu Tu&quot;&quot; (Taizu Shilu Tu) in the Qing palace, forbidden from public view because they showed that the Manchu Aisin-Gioro family had been ruled by the Ming dynasty. In the Ming period, the Koreans of Joseon referred to the Jurchen inhabited lands north of the Korean peninsula, above the rivers Yalu and Tumen to be part of Ming China, as the &quot;superior country&quot; (sangguk) which they called Ming China. The Qing deliberately excluded references and information that showed the Jurchens (Manchus) as subservient to the Ming dynasty, from the History of Ming to hide their former subservient relationship to the Ming. The Ming Veritable Records were not used to source content on Jurchens during Ming rule in the History of Ming because of this.

In 1644, the Ming capital, Beijing, was sacked by a peasant revolt led by Li Zicheng, a former minor Ming official who became the leader of the peasant revolt, who then proclaimed the establishment of the Shun dynasty. The last Ming ruler, the Chongzhen Emperor, died by suicide by hanging himself when the city fell. When Li Zicheng moved against the Ming general Wu Sangui, the latter made an alliance with the Manchus and opened the Shanhai Pass to the Manchu army. After the Manchus defeated Li Zicheng, they moved the capital of their new Qing Empire to Beijing () in the same year.

The Qing government differentiated between Han Bannermen and ordinary Han civilians. Han Bannermen were Han Chinese who defected to the Qing Empire up to 1644 and joined the Eight Banners, giving them social and legal privileges in addition to being acculturated to Manchu culture. So many Han defected to the Qing Empire and swelled up the ranks of the Eight Banners that ethnic Manchus became a minority within the Banners, making up only 16% in 1648, with Han Bannermen dominating at 75% and Mongol Bannermen making up the rest. It was this multi-ethnic, majority Han force in which Manchus were a minority, which conquered China for the Qing Empire.

A mass marriage of Han Chinese officers and officials to Manchu women was organized to balance the massive number of Han women who entered the Manchu court as courtesans, concubines, and wives. These couples were arranged by Prince Yoto and Hong Taiji in 1632 to promote harmony between the two ethnic groups. Also to promote ethnic harmony, a 1648 decree from the Shunzhi Emperor allowed Han Chinese civilian men to marry Manchu women from the Banners with the permission of the Board of Revenue if they were registered daughters of officials or commoners or the permission of their banner company captain if they were unregistered commoners. It was only later in the dynasty that these policies allowing intermarriage were done away with.
As a result of their conquest of Ming China, almost all the Manchus followed the prince regent Dorgon and the Shunzhi Emperor to Beijing and settled there. A few of them were sent to other places such as Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and Tibet to serve as garrison troops. There were only 1524 Bannermen left in Manchuria at the time of the initial Manchu conquest. After a series of border conflicts with the Russians, the Qing emperors started to realize the strategic importance of Manchuria and gradually sent Manchus back where they originally came from. But throughout the Qing dynasty, Beijing was the focal point of the ruling Manchus in the political, economic and cultural spheres. The Yongzheng Emperor noted: &quot;Garrisons are the places of stationed works, Beijing is their homeland.&quot;

While the Manchu ruling elite at the Qing imperial court in Beijing and posts of authority throughout China increasingly adopted Han culture, the Qing imperial government viewed the Manchu communities (as well as those of various tribal people) in Manchuria as a place where traditional Manchu virtues could be preserved, and as a vital reservoir of military manpower fully dedicated to the regime. The Qing emperors tried to protect the traditional way of life of the Manchus (as well as various other tribal peoples) in central and northern Manchuria by a variety of means. In particular, they restricted the migration of Han settlers to the region. This had to be balanced with practical needs, such as maintaining the defense of northern China against the Russians and the Mongols, supplying government farms with a skilled work force, and conducting trade in the region&#x27;s products, which resulted in a continuous trickle of Han convicts, workers, and merchants to the northeast.

Han Chinese transfrontiersmen and other non-Jurchen origin people who joined the Later Jin very early were put into the Manchu Banners and were known as &quot;Baisin&quot; in Manchu, and not put into the Han Banners to which later Han Chinese were placed in. An example was the Tokoro Manchu clan in the Manchu banners which claimed to be descended from a Han Chinese with the surname of Tao who had moved north from Zhejiang to Liaodong and joined the Jurchens before the Qing in the Ming Wanli emperor&#x27;s era. The Han Chinese Banner Tong 佟 clan of Fushun in Liaoning falsely claimed to be related to the Jurchen Manchu Tunggiya 佟佳 clan of Jilin, using this false claim to get themselves transferred to a Manchu banner in the reign of the Kangxi emperor.

Select groups of Han Chinese bannermen were mass transferred into Manchu Banners by the Qing, changing their ethnicity from Han Chinese to Manchu. Han Chinese bannermen of Tai Nikan (台尼堪, watchpost Chinese) and Fusi Nikan (撫順尼堪, Fushun Chinese) backgrounds into the Manchu banners in 1740 by order of the Qing Qianlong emperor. It was between 1618 and 1629 when the Han Chinese from Liaodong who later became the Fushun Nikan and Tai Nikan defected to the Jurchens (Manchus). These Han Chinese origin Manchu clans continue to use their original Han surnames and are marked as of Han origin on Qing lists of Manchu clans. The Fushun Nikan became Manchufied and the originally Han banner families of Wang Shixuan, Cai Yurong, Zu Dashou, Li Yongfang, Shi Tingzhu and Shang Kexi intermarried extensively with Manchu families.

A Manchu Bannerman in Guangzhou called Hequan illegally adopted a Han Chinese named Zhao Tinglu, the son of former Han bannerman Zhao Quan, and gave him a new name, Quanheng in order that he be able to benefit from his adopted son receiving a salary as a Banner soldier.

Commoner Manchu bannermen who were not nobility were called irgen which meant common, in contrast to the Manchu nobility of the &quot;Eight Great Houses&quot; who held noble titles.

Manchu bannermen of the capital garrison in Beijing were said to be the worst militarily, unable to draw bows, unable to ride horses and fight properly and losing their Manchu culture.

Manchu bannermen from the Xi&#x27;an banner garrison were praised for maintaining Manchu culture by Kangxi in 1703. Xi&#x27;an garrison Manchus were said to retain Manchu culture far better than all other Manchus at martial skills in the provincial garrisons and they were able to draw their bows properly and perform cavalry archery unlike Beijing Manchus. The Qianlong emperor received a memorial staying Xi&#x27;an Manchu bannermen still had martial skills although not up to those in the past in a 1737 memorial from Cimbu. By the 1780s, the military skills of Xi&#x27;an Manchu bannermen dropped enormously and they had been regarded as the most militarily skilled provincial Manchu banner garrison. Manchu women from the Xi&#x27;an garrison often left the walled Manchu garrison and went to hot springs outside the city and gained bad reputations for their sexual lives. A Manchu from Beijing, Sumurji, was shocked and disgusted by this after being appointed Lieutenant general of the Manchu garrison of Xi&#x27;an and informed the Yongzheng emperor what they were doing. Han civilians and Manchu bannermen in Xi&#x27;an had bad relations, with the bannermen trying to steal at the markets. Manchu Lieutenant general Cimbru reported this to Yongzheng emperor in 1729 after he was assigned there. Governor Yue Rui of Shandong was then ordered by the Yongzheng to report any bannerman misbehaving and warned him not to cover it up in 1730 after Manchu bannermen were put in a quarter in Qingzhou. Manchu bannermen from the garrisons in Xi&#x27;an and Jingzhou fought in Xinjiang in the 1770s and Manchus from Xi&#x27;an garrison fought in other campaigns against the Dzungars and Uyghurs throughout the 1690s and 18th century. In the 1720s Jingzhou, Hangzhou and Nanjing Manchu banner garrisons fought in Tibet.

For the over 200 years they lived next to each other, Han civilians and Manchu bannermen in Xi&#x27;an did not intermarry with each other at all. In a book published in 1911 American sociologist Edward Alsworth Ross wrote of his visit to Xi&#x27;an just before the Xinhai revolution:&quot;In Sianfu the Tartar quarter is a dismal picture of crumbling walls, decay, indolence and squalor. On the big drill grounds you see the runways along which the horseman gallops and shoots arrows at a target while the Tartar military mandarins look on. These lazy bannermen were tried in the new army but proved flabby and good-for-nothing; they would break down on an ordinary twenty-mile march. Battening on their hereditary pensions they have given themselves up to sloth and vice, and their poor chest development, small weak muscles, and diminishing families foreshadow the early dying out of the stock. Where is there a better illustration of the truth that parasitism leads to degeneration!&quot; Ross spoke highly of the Han and Hui population of Xi&#x27;an, Shaanxi and Gansu in general, saying: &quot;After a fortnight of mule litter we sight ancient yellow Sianfu, &quot;the Western capital,&quot; with its third of a million souls. Within the fortified triple gate the facial mold abruptly changes and the refined intellectual type appears. Here and there faces of a Hellenic purity of feature are seen and beautiful children are not uncommon. These Chinese cities make one realize how the cream of the population gathers in the urban centers. Everywhere town opportunities have been a magnet for the élite of the open country.&quot;

The Qing dynasty altered its law on intermarriage between Han civilians and Manchu bannermen several times in the dynasty. At the beginning of the Qing dynasty, the Qing allowed Han civilians to marry Manchu women. Then the Qing banned civilians from marrying women from the Eight banners later. In 1865, the Qing allowed Han civilian men to marry Manchu bannerwomen in all garrisons except the capital garrison of Beijing. There was no formal law on marriage between people in the different banners like the Manchu and Han banners but it was informally regulated by social status and custom. In northeastern China such as Heilongjiang and Liaoning it was more common for Manchu women to marry Han men since they were not subjected to the same laws and institutional oversight as Manchus and Han in Beijing and elsewhere.

The policy of artificially isolating the Manchus of the northeast from the rest of China could not last forever. In the 1850s, large numbers of Manchu bannermen were sent to central China to fight the Taiping rebels. (For example, just the Heilongjiang province – which at the time included only the northern part of today&#x27;s Heilongjiang – contributed 67,730 bannermen to the campaign, of whom only 10–20% survived).Those few who returned were demoralized and often disposed to opium addiction. In 1860, in the aftermath of the loss of Outer Manchuria, and with the imperial and provincial governments in deep financial trouble, parts of Manchuria became officially open to Chinese settlement; within a few decades, the Manchus became a minority in most of Manchuria&#x27;s districts.

=== Modern times ===

The majority of the hundreds of thousands of people living in inner Beijing during the Qing were Manchus and Mongol bannermen from the Eight Banners after they were moved there in 1644, since Han Chinese were expelled and not allowed to re-enter the inner part of the city. Only after the &quot;Hundred Days Reform&quot;, during the reign of emperor Guangxu, were Han were allowed to re-enter inner Beijing.

Many Manchu Bannermen in Beijing supported the Boxers in the Boxer Rebellion and shared their anti-foreign sentiment. The Manchu Bannermen were devastated by the fighting during the First Sino-Japanese War and the Boxer Rebellion, sustaining massive casualties during the wars and subsequently being driven into extreme suffering and hardship. Much of the fighting in the Boxer Rebellion against the foreigners in defense of Beijing and Manchuria was done by Manchu Banner armies, which were destroyed while resisting the invasion. The German Minister Clemens von Ketteler was assassinated by a Manchu. Thousands of Manchus fled south from Aigun during the fighting in the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, their cattle and horses then stolen by Russian Cossacks who razed their villages and homes. The clan system of the Manchus in Aigun was obliterated by the despoliation of the area at the hands of the Russian invaders.

By the 19th century, most Manchus in the city garrison spoke only Mandarin Chinese, not Manchu, which still distinguished them from their Han neighbors in southern China, who spoke non-Mandarin dialects. That they spoke Beijing dialect made recognizing Manchus folks relatively easy. It was northern Standard Chinese which the Manchu Bannermen spoke instead of the local dialect the Han people around the garrison spoke, so that Manchus in the garrisons at Jingzhou and Guangzhou both spoke Beijing Mandarin even though Cantonese was spoken at Guangzhou, and the Beijing dialect of Mandarin distinguished the Manchu bannermen at the Xi&#x27;an garrison from the local Han people who spoke the Xi&#x27;an dialect of Mandarin. Many Bannermen got jobs as teachers, writing textbooks for learning Mandarin and instructing people in Mandarin. In Guangdong, the Manchu Mandarin teacher Sun Yizun advised that the &quot;Yinyun Chanwei&quot; and &quot;Kangxi Zidian&quot;, dictionaries issued by the Qing government, were the correct guides to Mandarin pronunciation, rather than the pronunciation of the Beijing and Nanjing dialects.

In the late 19th century and early 1900s, intermarriage between Manchus and Han bannermen in the northeast increased as Manchu families were more willing to marry their daughters to sons from well off Han families to trade their ethnic status for higher financial status. Most intermarriage consisted of Han Bannermen marrying Manchus in areas like Aihun. Han Chinese Bannermen wedded Manchus and there was no law against this.

As the end of the Qing dynasty approached, Manchus were portrayed as outside colonizers by Chinese nationalists such as Sun Yat-sen, even though the Republican revolution he brought about was supported by many reform-minded Manchu officials and military officers. This portrayal dissipated somewhat after the 1911 revolution as the new Republic of China now sought to include Manchus within its national identity. In order to blend in, some Manchus switched to speaking the local dialect instead of Standard Chinese.

By the early years of the Republic of China, very few areas of China still had traditional Manchu populations. Among the few regions where such comparatively traditional communities could be found, and where the Manchu language was still widely spoken, were the Aigun () District and the Qiqihar () District of Heilongjiang Province.

Until 1924, the Chinese government continued to pay stipends to Manchu bannermen, but many cut their links with their banners and took on Han-style names to avoid persecution. The official total of Manchus fell by more than half during this period, as they refused to admit their ethnicity when asked by government officials or other outsiders. On the other hand, in warlord Zhang Zuolin&#x27;s reign in Manchuria, much better treatment was reported. There was no particular persecution of Manchus. Even the mausoleums of Qing emperors were still allowed to be managed by Manchu guardsmen, as in the past. Many Manchus joined the Fengtian clique, such as Xi Qia, a member of the Qing dynasty&#x27;s imperial clan.

As a follow-up to the Mukden Incident, Manchukuo, a puppet state in Manchuria, was created by the Empire of Japan which was nominally ruled by the deposed Last Emperor, Puyi, in 1932. Although the nation&#x27;s name implied a primarily Manchu affiliation, it was actually a completely new country for all the ethnicities in Manchuria, which had a majority Han population and was opposed by many Manchus as well as people of other ethnicities who fought against Japan in the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese Ueda Kyōsuke labeled all 30 million people in Manchuria &quot;Manchus&quot;, including Han Chinese, even though most of them were not ethnic Manchu, and the Japanese-written &quot;Great Manchukuo&quot; built upon Ueda&#x27;s argument to claim that all 30 million &quot;Manchus&quot; in Manchukuo had the right to independence to justify splitting Manchukuo from China. In 1942, the Japanese-written &quot;Ten Year History of the Construction of Manchukuo&quot; attempted to emphasize the right of ethnic Japanese to the land of Manchukuo while attempting to delegitimize the Manchus&#x27; claim to Manchukuo as their native land, noting that most Manchus moved out during the Qing dynasty and only returned later.

In 1952, after the failure of both Manchukuo and the Nationalist Government (KMT), the newborn People&#x27;s Republic of China officially recognized the Manchu as one of the ethnic minorities as Mao Zedong had criticized the Han chauvinism that dominated the KMT. In the 1953 census, 2.5 million people identified themselves as Manchu. The Communist government also attempted to improve the treatment of Manchu people; some Manchu people who had hidden their ancestry during the period of KMT rule became willing to reveal their ancestry, such as the writer Lao She, who began to include Manchu characters in his fictional works in the 1950s. Between 1982 and 1990, the official count of Manchu people more than doubled from 4,299,159 to 9,821,180, making them China&#x27;s fastest-growing ethnic minority, but this growth was only on paper, as this was due to people formerly registered as Han applying for official recognition as Manchu. Since the 1980s, thirteen Manchu autonomous counties have been created in Liaoning, Jilin, Hebei, and Heilongjiang.

The Eight Banners system is one of the most important ethnic identity of today&#x27;s Manchu people. So nowadays, Manchus are more like an ethnic coalition which not only contains the descendants of Manchu bannermen, also has a large number of Manchu-assimilated Chinese and Mongol bannermen. However, Solon and Sibe Bannermen who were considered as part of Eight Banner system under the Qing dynasty were registered as independent ethnic groups by the PRC government as Daur, Evenk, Nanai, Oroqen, and Sibe.

Since the 1980s, the reform after Cultural Revolution, there has been a renaissance of Manchu culture and language among the government, scholars and social activities with remarkable achievements. It was also reported that the resurgence of interest also spread among Han Chinese. In modern China, Manchu culture and language preservation is promoted by the Chinese Communist Party, and Manchus once again form one of the most socioeconomically advanced minorities within China. Manchus generally face little to no discrimination in their daily lives, there is however, a remaining anti-Manchu sentiment amongst Han nationalist conspiracy theorists. It is particularly common with participants of the Hanfu movement who subscribe to conspiracy theories about Manchu people, such as the Chinese Communist Party being occupied by Manchu elites hence the better treatment Manchus receive under the People&#x27;s Republic of China in contrast to their persecution under the KMT&#x27;s Republic of China rule.
Manchus were subjected to the same one child policy and rules as Han people. Manchus, Koreans, Russians, Hui and Mongols in Inner Mongolia were subjected to restrictions of two children.

== Population ==
=== Mainland China ===
Most Manchu people now live in Mainland China with a population of 10,410,585, which is 9.28% of ethnic minorities and 0.77% of China&#x27;s total population. However, the modern population of Manchus has been artificially inflated very much, because Han Chinese of the Eight Banner System, including booi bondservants, are allowed to register as Manchu in modern China. Among the provincial regions, there are two provinces, Liaoning and Hebei, which have over 1,000,000 Manchu residents. Liaoning has 5,336,895 Manchu residents which is 51.26% of Manchu population and 12.20% provincial population; Hebei has 2,118,711 which is 20.35% of Manchu people and 70.80% of provincial ethnic minorities. Manchus are the largest ethnic minority in Liaoning, Hebei, Heilongjiang and Beijing; 2nd largest in Jilin, Inner Mongolia, Tianjin, Ningxia, Shaanxi and Shanxi and 3rd largest in Henan, Shandong and Anhui.

==== Distribution ====

====Manchu autonomous regions====



===Other areas===

Manchu people can be found living outside mainland China. There are approximately 12,000 Manchus now in Taiwan. Most of them moved to Taiwan with the ROC government in 1949. One notable example was Puru, a famous painter, calligrapher and also the founder of the Manchu Association of Republic of China.

==Genetics==
Modern China allows Han Chinese members of the Eight Banner System to also register as Manchu, causing the modern population of Manchus to be greatly inflated by Han bannermen. Therefore, Han members who registered as Manchu could potentially be included into DNA studies of Manchus if researchers do not remove them from sample populations. During the Qing era, Manchu ethnicity was based on paternal lineage. Therefore, even if the mother was of different ethnicity, the child would be registered as Manchu as long as the father was registered as Manchu.

===Paternal Y Haplogroups===
A 2010 paper by Hua Zhong et al. reports that in a sample of 111 Liaoning Manchus and 25 Heilongjiang Manchus, 25 Liaoning Manchus (22.52%) and 11 Heilongjiang Manchus (44.00%) had Y haplogroup C. The researchers did not say whether Han bannermen were removed from the sample populations. The same paper reports that in a sample of 115 Han Chinese from Shandong and 66 Han Chinese from Henan, 13 of the Shandong Han (11.30%) and 8 of the Henan Han (12.12%) had haplogroup C, suggesting that the old Manchus might have had a higher proportion of haplogroup C than typically found in the Chinese Central Plains. The same paper also reports that Han Chinese in the three provinces of Manchuria (Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang) had higher proportions of Haplogroup C than the Shandong and Henan samples, suggesting that many Han Chinese in Manchuria could have paternal ancestry from native ethnic groups of Manchuria. In this study, 22.50% of the Liaoning Han (9/40), 16.67% of the Jilin Han (14/84), and 15.32% of the Heilongjiang Han (19/124) had haplogroup C.

The Y DNA of the royal Aisin Gioro clan is believed to be C2b1a3a2-F8951, which is a subclade of C2a-L1373, the &quot;northern&quot; branch of haplogroup C2-M217. The Aisin Gioro paternal lineage is also closely related to that of the Ao clan of the Daghur ethnic group. In the database of the Chinese DNA company 23Mofang, 1/3 of the Gūwalgiya clan have haplogroup C-F11330, which also descended from the northern C2a-L1373. In the 23Mofang database, 40% of the Yehe Nara clan have haplogroup C, and 20% have C-MF46267, which descended from C-M407, the same branch as Dayan Khan. C-M407 is also predominant among Buryats and Oirats, suggesting that they may share similar paternal origins with the Yehe Nara clan.

==Culture==
===Influence on other Tungusic peoples===
The Manchus implemented measures to &quot;Manchufy&quot; the other Tungusic peoples living around the Amur River basin. The southern Tungusic Manchus influenced the northern Tungusic peoples linguistically, culturally, and religiously.

===Language and alphabet===
====Language====
The Manchu language is a Tungusic language and has many dialects. Standard Manchu originates from the accent of Jianzhou Jurchens and was officially standardized during the Qianlong Emperor&#x27;s reign. During the Qing dynasty, Manchus at the imperial court were required to speak Standard Manchu or face the emperor&#x27;s reprimand. This applied equally to the palace presbyter for shamanic rites when performing sacrifice.

After the 19th century, most Manchus had perfected Standard Chinese and the number of Manchu speakers was dwindling. Although the Qing emperors emphasized the importance of the Manchu language again and again, the tide could not be turned. After the Qing dynasty collapsed, the Manchu language lost its status as a national language and its official use in education ended. Manchus today generally speak Standard Chinese. The remaining skilled native Manchu speakers number less than 100, most of whom are to be found in Sanjiazi (), Heilongjiang Province. Since the 1980s, there has been a resurgence of the Manchu language among the government, scholars and social activists. In recent years, with the help of the governments in Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang, many schools started to have Manchu classes. There are also Manchu volunteers in many places of China who freely teach Manchu in the desire to rescue the language. Thousands of non-Manchus have learned the language through these platforms.

Today, in an effort to save Manchu culture from extinction, the older generation of Manchus are spending their time to teach young people; as an effort to encourage learners, these classes are often free. They teach through the Internet and even mail Manchu textbooks for free, all for the purpose of protecting the national cultural traditions.

====Alphabet====
The Jurchens, ancestors of the Manchus, had created Jurchen script in the Jin dynasty. After the Jin dynasty collapsed, the Jurchen script was gradually lost. In the Ming dynasty, 60–70% of Jurchens used Mongolian script to write letters and 30–40% of Jurchens used Chinese characters. This persisted until Nurhaci revolted against the Ming Empire. Nurhaci considered it a major impediment that his people lacked a script of their own, so he commanded his scholars, Gagai and Eldeni, to create Manchu characters by reference to Mongolian scripts. They dutifully complied with the Khan&#x27;s order and created Manchu script, which is called &quot;script without dots and circles&quot; (; ) or &quot;old Manchu script&quot; (). Due to its hurried creation, the script has its defects. Some vowels and consonants were difficult to distinguish. Shortly afterwards, their successor Dahai used dots and circles to distinguish vowels, aspirated and non-aspirated consonants and thus completed the script. His achievement is called &quot;script with dots and circles&quot; or &quot;new Manchu script&quot;.

===Traditional lifestyle===
The Manchu are often mistakenly labelled a nomadic people, but they were sedentary agricultural people who lived in fixed villages, farmed crops and practiced hunting and mounted archery.

The southern Tungusic Manchu farming sedentary lifestyle was very different from the nomadic hunter gatherer forager lifestyle of their more northern Tungusic relatives like the Warka, which caused the Qing state to attempt to sedentarize them and adopt the farming lifestyle of the Manchus.

===Names and naming practices===
====Family names====
The history of Manchu family names is quite long. Fundamentally, it succeeds the Jurchen family name of the Jin dynasty. However, after the Mongols extinguished the Jin dynasty, the Manchus started to adopt Mongol culture, including their custom of using only their given name until the end of the Qing dynasty, a practice confounding non-Manchus, leading them to conclude, erroneously, that they simply do not have family names.

A Manchu family name usually has two portions: the first is &quot;Mukūn&quot; (, Abkai: Mukvn) which literally means &quot;branch name&quot;; the second, &quot;Hala&quot; (), represents the name of a person&#x27;s clan. According to the &quot;Book of the Eight Manchu Banners&#x27; Surname-Clans&quot; (), there are 1,114 Manchu family names. Gūwalgiya, Niohuru, Hešeri, Šumulu, Tatara, Gioro, Nara are considered as &quot;famous clans&quot; () among Manchus.

There were stories of Han migrating to the Jurchens and assimilating into Manchu Jurchen society and Nikan Wailan may have been an example of this. The Manchu Cuigiya () clan claimed that a Han Chinese founded their clan. The Tohoro () clan (Duanfang&#x27;s clan) claimed Han Chinese origin.

====Given names====

Manchus given names are distinctive. Generally, there are several forms, such as bearing suffixes &quot;-ngga&quot;, &quot;-ngge&quot; or &quot;-nggo&quot;, meaning &quot;having the quality of&quot;; bearing Mongol style suffixes &quot;-tai&quot; or &quot;-tu&quot;, meaning &quot;having&quot;; bearing the suffix, &quot;-ju&quot;, &quot;-boo&quot;; numerals} or animal names.}

Some ethnic names can also be a given name of the Manchus. One of the common first name for the Manchus is &quot;Nikan&quot;, which is also a Manchu exonym for the Han Chinese. For example, Nikan Wailan was a Jurchen leader who was an enemy of Nurhaci. Nikan was also the name of one of the Aisin-Gioro princes and grandsons of Nurhaci who supported Prince Dorgon. Nurhaci&#x27;s first son was Cuyen, one of whose sons was Nikan.

==== Current status ====
Nowadays, Manchus primarily use Chinese family and given names, but some still use a Manchu family name and Chinese given name, a Chinese family name and Manchu given name or both Manchu family and given names.

=== Burial customs ===
The Jurchens and their Manchu descendants originally practiced cremation as part of their culture. They adopted the practice of burial from the Han Chinese, but many Manchus continued to cremate their dead. Princes were cremated on pyres.

=== Traditional hairstyle ===

The traditional hairstyle for Manchu men is shaving the front of their heads while growing the hair on the back of their heads into a single braid called a queue (), which was known as &quot;soncoho&quot; in Manchu. During the Qing dynasty, the queue was legally mandated for male Ming Chinese subjects in the Qing Empire. The Ming were to shave their foreheads and begin growing the queue within ten days of the order, if they refused to comply they were executed for treason. Throughout the rest of the Qing dynasty, the queue was seen as a submission of loyalty, as it showed who had submitted to the dynasty and who had not. As the Qing dynasty came to an end, the hairstyle shifted from a symbol of loyalty to a symbol of feudalism and this led many men to cut off their cues as a statement of rebellion. These acts gave China a step toward modernization and moved it away from imperial rule as China began to adopt more of Western culture, including fashion and appearance.

Manchu women wore their hair in a distinctive hairstyle called &quot;liangbatou&quot; ().

===Traditional garments===


A common misconception among Han Chinese was that Manchu clothing was entirely separate from Hanfu. In fact, Manchu clothes were simply modified Ming Hanfu but the Manchus promoted the misconception that their clothing was of different origin. Manchus originally did not have their own cloth or textiles and the Manchus had to obtain Ming dragon robes and cloth when they paid tribute to the Ming dynasty or traded with the Ming. The Manchus modified the Ming robes to be narrow at the sleeves by adding a new fur cuff and by cutting slits in the skirt to make it more slender for falconry, horse riding and archery. The robe&#x27;s jacket waist had a new strip of scrap cloth put on the waist while the waist was made snug by pleating the top of the skirt on the robe. The Manchus added sable fur skirts, cuffs and collars to Ming dragon robes and trimming sable fur all over them before wearing them. 

Han Chinese court costumes were modified by Manchus by adding a ceremonial big collar (da-ling) or shawl collar (pijian-ling). It was mistakenly believed that the hunting attire of the Manchu ancestors evolved into the clothing of the Qing dynasty. This misconception arose from the stark contrast between the unshaped cloth of Ming dynasty garments, which followed a straight length, and the irregularly shaped pieces of the Qing dynasty&#x27;s long pao and chao fu. Scholars from the west wrongly thought they were purely Manchu. Chao fu robes from Ming dynasty tombs like the Wanli emperor&#x27;s tomb were excavated and it was found that Qing chao fu was similar and derived from it. They had embroidered or woven dragons on them but are different from long pao dragon robes which are a separate clothing. Flaired skirt with right side fastenings and fitted bodices dragon robes have been found in Beijing, Shanxi, Jiangxi, Jiangsu and Shandong tombs of Ming officials and Ming imperial family members.

Integral upper sleeves of Ming chao fu had two pieces of cloth attached on Qing chao fu just like earlier Ming chao fu that had sleeve extensions with another piece of cloth attached to the bodice&#x27;s integral upper sleeve. Another type of separate Qing clothing, the long pao resembles Yuan dynasty clothing like robes found in the Shandong tomb of Li Youan during the Yuan dynasty. The Qing dynasty chao fu appear in official formal portraits while Ming dynasty chao fu that they derive from do not, perhaps indicating the Ming officials and imperial family wore chao fu under their formal robes since they appear in Ming tombs but not portraits. 

Qing long pao were similar unofficial clothing worn during the Qing dynasty. The Yuan robes featured flared hems and were tight around the arms and torso. Qing unofficial clothing, known as long pao, was derived from Yuan dynasty attire, while Qing official garments, called chao fu, were inspired by unofficial Ming dynasty clothing, specifically the dragon robes. The Ming dynasty intentionally modeled their clothing after earlier Han Chinese dynasties such as the Song, Tang, and Han dynasties.

In Japan&#x27;s Nara city, the Shosoin repository at the Todaiji temple houses 30 short coats (hanpi) from the Tang dynasty in China. The construction of Ming dragon robes is influenced by these Tang dynasty hanpi. The hanpi consists of a skirt and bodice made of different fabrics with distinct patterns, which served as the basis for the Qing chao fu. Cross-over closures are present in both the hanpi and Ming garments. 

The eighth century Shosoin hanpi&#x27;s variety show it was in vogue at the time and most likely derived from much more ancient clothing. Han dynasty and Jin dynasty (266–420) era tombs in Yingban, to the Tianshan mountains south in Xinjiang have clothes resembling the Qing long pao and Tang dynasty hanpi. The evidence from excavated tombs suggests that China had a longstanding tradition of garments that influenced the development of the Qing chao fu. This style was not invented or introduced by the Manchus in the Qing dynasty or the Mongols in the Yuan dynasty. The Ming robes, from which the Qing chao fu drew inspiration, were not commonly depicted in portraits or official paintings but were considered prestigious enough to be included in burial attire.

In some instances, the Qing dynasty went beyond the Ming dynasty in emulating ancient Chinese practices to showcase legitimacy. This included reviving ancient Chinese rituals and studying Chinese classics to assert their claim to the Mandate of Heaven. The Qing sacrificial ritual vessels were intentionally designed to bear a closer resemblance to ancient Chinese vessels than those of the Ming dynasty. Tungusic people on the Amur river like Udeghe, Ulchi and Nanai adopted Chinese influences in their religion and clothing with Chinese dragons on ceremonial robes, utilizing scroll and spiral bird and monster mask designs, celebrating Chinese New Year, using silk and cotton fabrics, employing iron cooking pots, and adopting heated house technology from China.

The Spencer Museum of Art has six long pao robes that belonged to Han Chinese nobility of the Qing dynasty (Chinese nobility). Ranked officials and Han Chinese nobles had two slits in the skirts while Manchu nobles and the Imperial family had four slits in skirts. All first, second and third rank officials as well as Han Chinese and Manchu nobles were entitled to wear nine dragons by the Qing Illustrated Precedents. Qing sumptuary laws only allowed four clawed dragons for officials, Han Chinese nobles and Manchu nobles while the Qing Imperial family, emperor and princes up to the second degree and their female family members were entitled to wear five clawed dragons. However officials violated these laws all the time and wore five clawed dragons and the Spencer Museum&#x27;s six long pao worn by Han Chinese nobles have five clawed dragons on them.

The early phase of Manchu clothing succeeded from Jurchen tradition. White was the dominating color.To facilitate convenience during archery, the robe is the most common article of clothing for the Manchu people. Over the robe, a surcoat is usually worn, derived from the military uniform of Eight Banners army. During the Kangxi period, the surcoat gained popularity among commoners. The modern Chinese suits, the Cheongsam and Tangzhuang, are derived from the Manchu robe and surcoat which are commonly considered as &quot;Chinese elements&quot;.

Wearing hats is also a part of traditional Manchu culture. Hats are worn by all ages throughout all seasons, which contrasts the Han Chinese culture of &quot;Starting to wear hats at 20-year-old&quot; (). Manchu hats are either formal or casual, formal hats being made in two different styles, straw for spring and summer, and fur for fall and winter. Casual hats are more commonly known as &quot;Mandarin hats&quot; in English.

Manchus have many distinctive traditional accessories. Women traditionally wear three earrings on each ear, a tradition that is maintained by many older Manchu women. Males also traditionally wear piercings, but they tend to only have one earring in their youth and do not continue to wear it as adults. The Manchu people also have traditional jewelry which evokes their past as hunters. The fergetun (), a thumb ring traditionally made out of reindeer bone, was worn to protect the thumbs of archers. After the establishment of the Qing dynasty in 1644, the fergetun gradually became a form of jewelry, with the most valuable ones made in jade and ivory. High-heeled shoes were worn by Manchu women.

===Traditional activities===
====Riding and archery====

Riding and archery () are significant to the Manchus. They were well-trained horsemen from their teenage years. Huangtaiji said, &quot;Riding and archery are the most important martial arts of our country&quot;. Every generation of the Qing dynasty treasured riding and archery the most. Every spring and fall, from ordinary Manchus to aristocrats, all had to take riding and archery tests. Their test results could even affect their rank in the nobility. The Manchus of the early Qing dynasty had excellent shooting skills and their arrows were reputed to be capable of penetrating two persons.

From the middle period of the Qing dynasty, archery became more a form of entertainment in the form of games such as hunting swans, shooting fabric or silk target. The most difficult is shooting a candle hanging in the air at night. Gambling was banned in the Qing dynasty but there was no limitation on Manchus engaging in archery contests. It was common to see Manchus putting signs in front of their houses to invite challenges. After the Qianlong period, Manchus gradually neglected the practices of riding and archery, even though their rulers tried their best to encourage Manchus to continue their riding and archery traditions, but the traditions are still kept among some Manchus even nowadays.

==== Manchu wrestling ====
Manchu wrestling () is also an important martial art of the Manchu people. Buku, meaning &quot;wrestling&quot; or &quot;man of unusual strength&quot; in Manchu, was originally from a Mongolian word, &quot;bökh&quot;. The history of Manchu wrestling can be traced back to Jurchen wrestling in the Jin dynasty which was originally from Khitan wrestling; it was very similar to Mongolian wrestling. In the Yuan dynasty, the Jurchens who lived in northeast China adopted Mongol culture including wrestling, bökh. In the latter Jin and early Qing period, rulers encouraged the populace, including aristocrats, to practise buku as a feature of military training. At the time, Mongol wrestlers were the most famous and powerful. By the Chongde period, Manchus had developed their own well-trained wrestlers and, a century later, in the Qianlong period, they surpassed Mongol wrestlers. The Qing court established the &quot;Shan Pu Battalion&quot; and chose 200 fine wrestlers divided into three levels. Manchu wrestling moves can be found in today&#x27;s Chinese wrestling, &quot;shuai jiao&quot;, which is its most important part. Among many branches, Beijing wrestling adopted most Manchu wrestling moves.

==== Falconry ====
As a result of their hunting ancestry, Manchus are traditionally interested in falconry. Gyrfalcon () is the most highly valued discipline in the Manchu falconry social circle. In the Qing period, giving a gyrfalcon to the royal court in tribute could be met with a considerable reward. There were professional falconers in Ningguta area (today&#x27;s Heilongjiang province and the northern part of Jilin province). It was a big base of falconry. Beijing&#x27;s Manchus also like falconry. Compared to the falconry of Manchuria, it is more like an entertainment. Imperial Household Department of Beijing had professional falconers, too. They provided outstanding falcons to the emperor when he went to hunt every fall. Even today, Manchu traditional falconry is well practised in some regions.

==== Ice skating ====
Ice skating () is another Manchu pastime. The Qianlong Emperor called it a &quot;national custom&quot;. It was one of the most important winter events of the Qing royal household, performed by the &quot;Eight Banner Ice Skating Battalion&quot; () which was a special force trained to do battle on icy terrain. The battalion consisted of 1600 soldiers. In the Jiaqing period, it was reduced to 500 soldiers and transferred to the Jing Jie Battalion () originally, literally meaning &quot;chosen agile battalion&quot;.

In the 1930s–1940s, there was a famous Manchu skater in Beijing whose name was Wu Tongxuan, from the Uya clan and one of the royal household skaters in Empress Dowager Cixi&#x27;s regency. He frequently appeared in many of Beijing&#x27;s skating rinks. Nowadays, there are still Manchu figure skaters; world champions Zhao Hongbo and Tong Jian are the pre-eminent examples.

=== Literature ===
The &quot;Tale of the Nisan Shaman&quot; (; ) is the most important piece of Manchu literature. It primarily recounts how Nisan Shaman helps revive a young hunter. The story also spread to Xibe, Nanai, Daur, Oroqen, Evenk and other Tungusic peoples. It has four versions: the handwriting version from Qiqihar; two different handwriting versions from Aigun; and the one by the Manchu writer Dekdengge in Vladivostok (). The four versions are similar, but Haišenwei&#x27;s is the most complete. It has been translated into Russian, Chinese, English and other languages.

There is also literature written in Chinese by Manchu writers, such as &quot;The Tale of Heroic Sons and Daughters&quot; (), &#x27; () and &#x27; ().

===Folk art===
====Octagonal drum====
Octagonal drum is a type of Manchu folk art that was very popular among bannermen, especially in Beijing. It is said that octagonal drum originated with the snare drum of the Eight-banner military and the melody was made by the banner soldiers who were on the way back home from victory in the battle of Jinchuan. The drum is composed of wood surrounded by bells. The drumhead is made by wyrmhide with tassels at the bottom. The colors of the tassels are yellow, white, red, and blue, which represent the four colors of the Eight Banners. When artists perform, they use their fingers to hit the drumhead and shake the drum to ring the bells. Traditionally, octagonal drum is performed by three people. One is the harpist; one is the clown who is responsible for harlequinade; and the third is the singer.

&quot;Zidishu&quot; is the main libretto of octagonal drum and can be traced back to a type of traditional folk music called the &quot;Manchu Rhythm&quot;. Although Zidishu was not created by Han Chinese, it still contains many themes from Chinese stories, such as &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;, &quot;Romance of the Western Chamber&quot;, &quot;Legend of the White Snake&quot; and &quot;Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio&quot;. Additionally, there are many works that depict the lives of Bannermen. Aisin-Gioro Yigeng, who was pen named &quot;Helü&quot; and wrote &quot;the sigh of old imperial bodyguard&quot;, as the representative author. Zidishu involves two acts of singing, which are called &quot;dongcheng&quot; and &quot;xicheng&quot;.

After the fall of the Qing dynasty, the influence of the octagonal drum gradually reduced. However, the and crosstalk which incorporates octagonal drum are still popular in Chinese society and the new generations. Many famous Chinese monochord performers and crosstalkers were the artists of octagonal drum, such as De Shoushan and Zhang Sanlu.

==== Ulabun ====
Ulabun () is a form of Manchu storytelling entertainment which is performed in the Manchu language. Different from octagonal drum, ulabun is popular among the Manchu people living in Manchuria. It has two main categories; one is popular folk literature such as the &quot;Tale of the Nisan Shaman&quot;, the other is from folk music with an informative and independent plot, and complete structure.

=== Religion ===
Originally, Manchus, and their predecessors, were principally Buddhists with Shamanist influences. Every Manchu King started his royal title with Buddha. After the conquest of China in the 17th century, Manchus came into contact with Chinese culture. They adopted Confucianism along with Buddhism and discouraged shamanism.

==== Manchu shamanism ====

Shamanism has a long history in Manchu civilization and influenced them tremendously over thousands of years. John Keay states in &quot;A History of China&quot;, shaman is the single loan-word from Manchurian into the English language. After the conquest of China in the 17th century, although Manchus officially adopted Buddhism and widely adopted Chinese folk religion, Shamanic traditions can still be found in the aspects of soul worship, totem worship, belief in nightmares and apotheosis of philanthropists. Apart from the Shamanic shrines in the Qing palace, no temples erected for worship of Manchu gods could be found in Beijing. Thus, the story of competition between Shamanists and Lamaists was often heard in Manchuria but the Manchu emperors helped Lamaists or Tibetan Buddhists officially.

==== Buddhism ====
Jurchens, the predecessors of the Manchus adopted the Buddhism of Balhae, Goryeo, Liao and Song in the 10–13th centuries, so it was not something new to the rising Manchus in the 16–17th centuries. Qing emperors were always entitled &quot;Buddha&quot;. They were regarded as Mañjuśrī in Tibetan Buddhism and had high attainments.

Hong Taiji who was of Mongolian descent started leaning towards Chan Buddhism, the original Chinese form known in Japan as Zen Buddhism. Still, Huangtaiji patronized Tibetan Buddhism extensively and publicly. Huangtaiji patronized Buddhism but sometimes felt Tibetan Buddhism to be inferior to Chan Buddhism.

The Qianlong Emperor&#x27;s faith in Tibetan Buddhism has been questioned in recent times because the emperor indicated that he supported the Yellow Church (the Tibetan Buddhist Gelukpa sect)

This explanation of only supporting the &quot;Yellow Hats&quot; Tibetan Buddhists for practical reasons was used to deflect Han criticism of this policy by the Qianlong Emperor, who had the &quot;Lama Shuo&quot; stele engraved in Tibetan, Mongol, Manchu and Chinese, which said: &quot;By patronizing the Yellow Church we maintain peace among the Mongols.&quot; It seems he was wary of the rising power of the Tibetan Kingdom and its influence over the Mongolians and Manchu public, princes and generals.

==== Chinese folk religion ====
Manchus were affected by Chinese folk religions for most of the Qing dynasty. Save for ancestor worship, the gods they consecrated were virtually identical to those of the Han Chinese. Guan Yu worship is a typical example. He was considered as the God Protector of the Nation and was sincerely worshipped by Manchus. They called him &quot;Lord Guan&quot; (). Uttering his name was taboo. In addition, Manchus worshipped Cai Shen and the Kitchen God just as the Han Chinese did. The worship of Mongolian and Tibetan gods has also been reported.

==== Christianity ====
===== Roman Catholic =====
Influenced by the Jesuit missionaries in China, there were also a considerable number of Manchu Catholics during the Qing dynasty. The earliest Manchu Catholics appeared in the 1650s. In the Yongzheng eras, Depei, the Hošo Jiyan Prince, was a Catholic whose baptismal name was &quot;Joseph&quot;. His wife was also baptised and named &quot;Maria&quot;. At the same time, the sons of Doro Beile Sunu were devout Catholics, too. In the Jiaqing period, Tong Hengšan and Tong Lan were Catholic Manchu Bannermen. These Manchu Catholics who were proselytized were persecuted by Qing emperors but they steadfastly refused to renounce their faith. There were Manchu Catholics in modern times, too, such as Ying Lianzhi, the founder of Fu Jen Catholic University.

=== Traditional holidays ===
Manchus have many traditional holidays. Some are derived from Chinese culture, such as the &quot;Spring Festival&quot; and Duanwu Festival. Some are of Manchu origin. Food Exhaustion Day (), on every 26th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar, is another example which was inspired by a story that once Nurhaci and his troops were in a battle with enemies and almost running out of food. The villagers who lived near the battlefield heard the emergency and came to help. There was no tableware on the battlefield. They had to use perilla leaves to wrap the rice. Afterwards, they won the battle. So later generations could remember this hardship, Nurhaci made this day the &quot;Food Exhaustion Day&quot;. Traditionally on this day, Manchu people eat perilla or cabbage wraps with rice, scrambled eggs, beef or pork. Banjin Inenggi (), on the 13th day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar, which started to be celebrated in late 20th century, is the anniversary of the name creation of Manchu. This day in 1635, Hong Taiji changed the ethnic name from Jurchen to Manchu.

<text>Protectionism, sometimes referred to as trade protectionism, is the economic policy of restricting imports from other countries through methods such as tariffs on imported goods, import quotas, and a variety of other government regulations. Proponents argue that protectionist policies shield the producers, businesses, and workers of the import-competing sector in the country from foreign competitors and raise government revenue. Opponents argue that protectionist policies reduce trade, and adversely affect consumers in general (by raising the cost of imported goods) as well as the producers and workers in export sectors, both in the country implementing protectionist policies and in the countries against which the protections are implemented.

Protectionism has been advocated mainly by parties that hold economic nationalist positions, while economically liberal political parties generally support free trade.

There is a consensus among economists that protectionism has a negative effect on economic growth and economic welfare, while free trade and the reduction of trade barriers have a significantly positive effect on economic growth. Some scholars, such as Douglas Irwin, have implicated protectionism as the cause of some economic crises, most notably the Great Depression. On the contrary, Paul Krugman, winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics, argues that tariffs had no negative impact during the Great Depression. Although trade liberalization can sometimes result in unequally distributed losses and gains, and can, in the short run, cause significant economic dislocation of workers in import-competing sectors, free trade lowers the costs of goods and services for both producers and consumers.

==Protectionist policies==

A variety of policies have been used to achieve protectionist goals. These include:
* Tariffs and import quotas are the most common types of protectionist policies. A tariff is an excise tax levied on imported goods. Originally imposed to raise government revenue, modern tariffs are now used primarily to protect domestic producers and wage rates from lower-priced importers. An import quota is a limit on the volume of a good that may be legally imported, usually established through an import licensing regime.
* Protection of technologies, patents, technical and scientific knowledge 
* Restrictions on foreign direct investment, such as restrictions on the acquisition of domestic firms by foreign investors.
* Administrative barriers: Countries are sometimes accused of using their various administrative rules (e.g., regarding food safety, environmental standards, electrical safety, etc.) as a way to introduce barriers to imports. 
* Anti-dumping legislation: &quot;Dumping&quot; is the practice of firms selling to export markets at lower prices than are charged in domestic markets. Supporters of anti-dumping laws argue that they prevent the import of cheaper foreign goods that would cause local firms to close down. However, in practice, anti-dumping laws are usually used to impose trade tariffs on foreign exporters.
* Direct subsidies: Government subsidies (in the form of lump-sum payments or cheap loans) are sometimes given to local firms that cannot compete well against imports. These subsidies are purported to &quot;protect&quot; local jobs and to help local firms adjust to the world markets.
* Export subsidies: Export subsidies are often used by governments to increase exports. Export subsidies have the opposite effect of export tariffs because exporters get payment, which is a percentage or proportion of the value of exported. Export subsidies increase the amount of trade, and in a country with floating exchange rates, have effects similar to import subsidies.
* Exchange rate control: A government may intervene in the foreign exchange market to lower the value of its currency by selling its currency in the foreign exchange market. Doing so will raise the cost of imports and lower the cost of exports, leading to an improvement in its trade balance. However, such a policy is only effective in the short run, as it will lead to higher inflation in the country in the long run, which will, in turn, raise the real cost of exports, and reduce the relative price of imports.
* International patent systems: There is an argument for viewing national patent systems as a cloak for protectionist trade policies at a national level. Two strands of this argument exist: one when patents held by one country form part of a system of exploitable relative advantage in trade negotiations against another, and a second where adhering to a worldwide system of patents confers &quot;good citizenship&quot; status despite &#x27;de facto protectionism&#x27;. Peter Drahos explains that &quot;States realized that patent systems could be used to cloak protectionist strategies. There were also reputational advantages for states to be seen to be sticking to intellectual property systems. One could attend the various revisions of the Paris and Berne conventions, participate in the cosmopolitan moral dialogue about the need to protect the fruits of authorial labor and inventive genius...knowing all the while that one&#x27;s domestic intellectual property system was a handy protectionist weapon.&quot;
* Political campaigns advocating domestic consumption (e.g. the &quot;Buy American&quot; campaign in the United States, which could be seen as an extra-legal promotion of protectionism.)
* Preferential governmental spending, such as the Buy American Act, federal legislation which called upon the United States government to prefer US-made products in its purchases.

In the modern trade arena, many other initiatives besides tariffs have been called protectionist. For example, some commentators, such as Jagdish Bhagwati, see developed countries&#x27; efforts in imposing their own labor or environmental standards as protectionism. Also, the imposition of restrictive certification procedures on imports is seen in this light.

Further, others point out that free trade agreements often have protectionist provisions such as intellectual property, copyright, and patent restrictions that benefit large corporations. These provisions restrict trade in music, movies, pharmaceuticals, software, and other manufactured items to high-cost producers with quotas from low-cost producers set to zero.

==History==
In the 18th century, Adam Smith famously warned against the &quot;interested sophistry&quot; of industry, seeking to gain an advantage at the cost of the consumers. Friedrich List saw Adam Smith&#x27;s views on free trade as disingenuous, believing that Smith advocated for free trade so that British industry could lock out underdeveloped foreign competition.

Some have argued that no major country has ever successfully industrialized without some form of economic protection. Economic historian Paul Bairoch wrote that &quot;historically, free trade is the exception and protectionism the rule&quot;.

According to economic historians Douglas Irwin and Kevin O&#x27;Rourke, &quot;shocks that emanate from brief financial crises tend to be transitory and have a little long-run effect on trade policy, whereas those that play out over longer periods (the early 1890s, early 1930s) may give rise to protectionism that is difficult to reverse. Regional wars also produce transitory shocks that have little impact on long-run trade policy, while global wars give rise to extensive government trade restrictions that can be difficult to reverse.&quot;

One study shows that sudden shifts in comparative advantage for specific countries have led some countries to become protectionist: &quot;The shift in comparative advantage associated with the opening up of New World frontiers, and the subsequent &quot;grain invasion&quot; of Europe, led to higher agricultural tariffs from the late 1870s onwards, which as we have seen reversed the move toward freer trade that had characterized mid-nineteenth-century Europe. In the decades after World War II, Japan&#x27;s rapid rise led to trade friction with other countries. Japan&#x27;s recovery was accompanied by a sharp increase in its exports of certain product categories: cotton textiles in the 1950s, steel in the 1960s, automobiles in the 1970s, and electronics in the 1980s. In each case, the rapid expansion in Japan&#x27;s exports created difficulties for its trading partners and the use of protectionism as a shock absorber.&quot;

=== In the United States ===

According to economic historian Douglas Irwin, a common myth about US trade policy is that low tariffs harmed American manufacturers in the early 19th century and then that high tariffs made the United States into a great industrial power in the late 19th century. A review by &quot;The Economist&quot; of Irwin&#x27;s 2017 book &quot;Clashing over Commerce: A History of US Trade Policy&quot; states:
Political dynamics would lead people to see a link between tariffs and the economic cycle that was not there. A boom would generate enough revenue for tariffs to fall, and when the bust came pressure would build to raise them again. By the time that happened, the economy would be recovering, giving the impression that tariff cuts caused the crash and the reverse generated the recovery. &#x27;Mr. Irwin&#x27; also attempts to debunk the idea that protectionism made America a great industrial power, a notion believed by some to offer lessons for developing countries today. As its share of global manufacturing powered from 23% in 1870 to 36% in 1913, the admittedly high tariffs of the time came with a cost, estimated at around 0.5% of GDP in the mid-1870s. In some industries, they might have sped up development by a few years. But American growth during its protectionist period was more to do with its abundant resources and openness to people and ideas.

According to Irwin, tariffs have served three primary purposes in the United States: &quot;to raise revenue for the government, to restrict imports and protect domestic producers from foreign competition, and to reach reciprocity agreements that reduce trade barriers.&quot; From 1790 to 1860, average tariffs increased from 20 percent to 60 percent before declining again to 20 percent. From 1861 to 1933, which Irwin characterizes as the &quot;restriction period&quot;, the average tariffs increased to 50 percent and remained at that level for several decades. From 1934 onwards, which Irwin characterizes as the &quot;reciprocity period&quot;, the average tariff declined substantially until it leveled off at 5 percent.

Economist Paul Bairoch documented that the United States imposed among the highest rates in the world from around the founding of the country until the World War II period, describing the United States as &quot;the mother country and bastion of modern protectionism&quot; since the end of the 18th century and until the post-World War II period. Alexander Hamilton, the first United States Secretary of the Treasury, was of the view, as articulated most famously in his &quot;Report on Manufactures&quot;, that developing an industrialized economy was impossible without protectionism because import duties are necessary to shelter domestic &quot;infant industries&quot; until they could achieve economies of scale. The industrial takeoff of the United States occurred under protectionist policies 1816–1848 and under moderate protectionism 1846–1861, and continued under strict protectionist policies 1861–1945. In the late 19th century, higher tariffs were introduced on the grounds that they were needed to protect American wages and to protect American farmers. Between 1824 and the 1940s, the U.S. imposed much higher average tariff rates on manufactured products than did Britain or any other European country, with the exception for a period of time of Spain and Russia. Up until the end of World War II, the United States had the most protectionist economy on Earth.

The Bush administration implemented tariffs on Chinese steel in 2002; according to a 2005 review of existing research on the tariff, all studies found that the tariffs caused more harm than gains to the US economy and employment. The Obama administration implemented tariffs on Chinese tires between 2009 and 2012 as an anti-dumping measure; a 2016 study found that these tariffs had no impact on employment and wages in the US tire industry.

In 2018, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström stated that the US was &quot;playing a dangerous game&quot; in applying tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from most countries and stated that she saw the Trump administration&#x27;s decision to do so as both &quot;pure protectionist&quot; and &quot;illegal&quot;.

The tariffs imposed by the first Trump administration during the China–United States trade war led to a reduction in the United States trade deficit with China.

===Europe===
==== In the United Kingdom====

Great Britain, and England in particular, became one of the most prosperous economic regions in the world between the late 1600s and early 1800s as a result of being the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution that began in the mid-eighteenth century. The government protected its merchants—and kept others out—by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm. The Navigation Acts of the late 17th century required all trade to be carried in English ships, manned by English crews (this later encompassed all Britons after the Acts of Union 1707 united Scotland with England). Colonists were required to send their produce and raw materials first of all to Britain, where the surplus was then sold-on by British merchants to other colonies in the British empire or bullion-earning external markets. The colonies were forbidden to trade directly with other nations or rival empires. The goal was to maintain the North American and Caribbean colonies as dependent agricultural economies geared towards producing raw materials for export to Britain. The growth of native industry was discouraged, in order to keep the colonies dependent on the United Kingdom for their finished goods. From 1815 to 1870, the United Kingdom reaped the benefits of being the world&#x27;s first modern, industrialised nation. It described itself as &quot;the workshop of the world&quot;, meaning that its finished goods were produced so efficiently and cheaply that they could often undersell comparable, locally manufactured goods in almost any other market.

By the 1840s, the United Kingdom had adopted a free-trade policy, meaning open markets and no tariffs throughout the empire. The Corn Laws were tariffs and other trade restrictions on imported food and corn enforced in the United Kingdom between 1815 and 1846, and enhanced the profits and political power associated with land ownership. The laws raised food prices and the costs of living for the British public, and hampered the growth of other British economic sectors, such as manufacturing, by reducing the disposable income of the British public. The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, a Conservative, achieved repeal in 1846 with the support of the Whigs in Parliament, overcoming the opposition of most of his own party.

While the United Kingdom espoused a policy of free trade in the late nineteenth century, it was hardly the case that Britain was unaffected by the tariffs imposed by its trade partners—tariffs that generally increased during the late nineteenth century. According to one study, Britain&#x27;s exports in 1902 would have been 57% higher, if all of Britain&#x27;s trade partners also embraced free trade. The decline in overseas demand for British exports, resulting from foreign tariffs, contributed to the so-called late-Victorian climacteric in the British economy: a decline in the growth rate, i.e. a deceleration.

During the interwar era, Britain abandoned free trade. There was a limited erosion of free trade during the 1920s under a patchwork of legislation including the Safeguarding of Industries Act of 1921, the Safeguarding of Industries Act of 1925, and the Finance Act of 1925. The McKenna Duties, which were imposed during the First World War on motorcars; clocks and watches; musical instruments; and cinematographic film were retained. Under commodities that were early to receive protection included matches, chemicals, scientific equipment, silk, rayon, embroidery, lace, cutlery, gloves, incandescent mantles, paper, pottery, enamelled holloware, and buttons. The duties on motorcars and rayon have been determined to have expanded output considerably. Amid the Depression, Britain passed the Import Duties Act of 1932, which imposed a general tariff of 10% on most imports and created the Import Duties Advisory Committee (IDAC), which could recommend even higher duties. Britain&#x27;s protectionism in the early 1930s was shown by Lloyd and Solomou to have been productivity-enhancing.

The possessions of the East India Company in India, known as British India, was the centrepiece of the British Empire, and because of an efficient taxation system it paid its own administrative expenses as well as the cost of the large British Indian Army. In terms of trade, India turned only a small profit for British business. However, transfers to the British government was massive: in 1801 unrequited (unpaid, or paid from Indian-collected revenue) was about 30% of British domestic savings available for capital formation in the United Kingdom.

==== In continental Europe ====
Europe became increasingly protectionist during the eighteenth century. Economic historians Findlay and O&#x27;Rourke write that in &quot;the immediate aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, European trade policies were almost universally protectionist&quot;, with the exceptions being smaller countries such as the Netherlands and Denmark.

Europe increasingly liberalized its trade during the 19th century. Countries such as the Netherlands, Denmark, Portugal and Switzerland, and arguably Sweden and Belgium, had fully moved towards free trade prior to 1860. Economic historians see the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 as the decisive shift toward free trade in Britain. A 1990 study by the Harvard economic historian Jeffrey Williamson showed that the Corn Laws (which imposed restrictions and tariffs on imported grain) substantially increased the cost of living for British workers, and hampered the British manufacturing sector by reducing the disposable incomes that British workers could have spent on manufactured goods. The shift towards liberalization in Britain occurred in part due to &quot;the influence of economists like David Ricardo&quot;, but also due to &quot;the growing power of urban interests&quot;.

Findlay and O&#x27;Rourke characterize 1860 Cobden Chevalier treaty between France and the United Kingdom as &quot;a decisive shift toward European free trade.&quot; This treaty was followed by numerous free trade agreements: &quot;France and Belgium signed a treaty in 1861; a Franco-Prussian treaty was signed in 1862; Italy entered the &quot;network of Cobden-Chevalier treaties&quot; in 1863 (Bairoch 1989, 40); Switzerland in 1864; Sweden, Norway, Spain, the Netherlands, and the Hanseatic towns in 1865; and Austria in 1866. By 1877, less than two decades after the Cobden Chevalier treaty and three decades after British Repeal, Germany &quot;had virtually become a free trade country&quot; (Bairoch, 41). Average duties on manufactured products had declined to 9–12% on the Continent, a far cry from the 50% British tariffs, and numerous prohibitions elsewhere, of the immediate post-Waterloo era (Bairoch, table 3, p. 6, and table 5, p. 42).&quot;

Some European powers did not liberalize during the 19th century, such as the Russian Empire and Austro-Hungarian Empire which remained highly protectionist. The Ottoman Empire also became increasingly protectionist. In the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s case, however, it previously had liberal free trade policies during the 18th to early 19th centuries, which British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli cited as &quot;an instance of the injury done by unrestrained competition&quot; in the 1846 Corn Laws debate, arguing that it destroyed what had been &quot;some of the finest manufacturers of the world&quot; in 1812.

The countries of Western Europe began to steadily liberalize their economies after World War II and the protectionism of the interwar period, but John Tsang, then Hong Kong&#x27;s Secretary for Commerce, Industry and Technology and chair of the Sixth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization, MC6, commented in 2005 that the EU spent around €70 billion per year on &quot;trade-distorting support&quot;.

===In Canada===

Since 1971 Canada has protected producers of eggs, milk, cheese, chicken, and turkey with a system of supply management. Though prices for these foods in Canada exceed global prices, the farmers and processors have had the security of a stable market to finance their operations. Doubts about the safety of bovine growth hormone, sometimes used to boost dairy production, led to hearings before the Senate of Canada, resulting in a ban in Canada. Thus, supply management of milk products is consumer protection of Canadians.

=== In Latin America ===
Most Latin American countries gained independence in the early 19th century, with notable exceptions including Spanish Cuba and Spanish Puerto Rico. Following the achievement of their independence, many of the Latin American countries adopted protectionism. They both feared that any foreign competition would stomp out their newly created state and believed that lack of outside resources would drive domestic production. The protectionist behavior continued up until and during the World Wars. During World War 2, Latin America had, on average, the highest tariffs in the world.

====Argentina====
Argentina, which had been insignificant during the first half of the 19th century, showed an impressive and sustained economic performance from the 1860s up until 1930. A 2018 study describes Argentina as a &quot;super-exporter&quot; during the period 1880–1929, and credits the boom to low trade costs and trade liberalization on one hand and on the other hand to the fact that Argentina &quot;offered a diverse basket of products to the different European and American countries that consumed them&quot;. The study concludes &quot;that Argentina took advantage of a multilateral and open economic system.&quot;

Beginning in the 1940s, Juan Perón erected a system of almost complete protectionism against imports, largely cutting off Argentina from the international market. Protectionism created a domestically oriented industry with high production costs, incapable of competing in international markets. At the same time, output of beef and grain, the country&#x27;s main export goods, stagnated. The IAPI began shortchanging growers and, when world grain prices dropped in the late 1940s, it stifled agricultural production, exports and business sentiment, in general. Despite these shortcomings, protectionism and government credits did allow an exponential growth of the internal market: radio sales increased 600% and fridge sales grew 218%, among others. During this period Argentina&#x27;s economy continued to grow, on average, but more slowly than the world as a whole or than its neighbors, Brazil and Chile. By 1954, while still leading the region, Argentina&#x27;s GDP per capita had fallen to less than half of that of the United States, from being 80% equivalent before the 1930s.

===China===
In 2010, Paul Krugman write that China pursues a mercantilist and predatory policy, i.e., it keeps its currency undervalued to accumulate trade surpluses by using capital flow controls. The Chinese government sells renminbi and buys foreign currency to keep the renminbi low, giving the Chinese manufacturing sector a cost advantage over its competitors. China&#x27;s surpluses drain US demand and slow economic recovery in other countries with which China trades. Krugman writes: &quot;This is the most distorted exchange rate policy any great nation has ever followed&quot;. He notes that an undervalued renminbi is tantamount to imposing high tariffs or providing export subsidies. A cheaper currency improves employment and competitiveness because it makes imports more expensive while making domestic products more attractive. He expects Chinese surpluses to destroy 1.4 million American jobs by 2011.
==Impact==
There is a broad consensus among economists that protectionism has a negative effect on economic growth and economic welfare, while free trade and the reduction of trade barriers has a positive effect on economic growth. However, protectionism can be used to raise government revenue and enable access to intellectual property, including essential medicines.

Protectionism is frequently criticized by economists as harming the people it is intended to help. Mainstream economists instead support free trade. The principle of comparative advantage shows that the gains from free trade outweigh any losses as free trade creates more jobs than it destroys because it allows countries to specialize in the production of goods and services in which they have a comparative advantage. Protectionism results in deadweight loss; this loss to overall welfare gives no-one any benefit, unlike in a free market, where there is no such total loss. Economist Stephen P. Magee claims the benefits of free trade outweigh the losses by as much as 100 to 1.

=== Armed conflicts ===
Protectionism has been attributed as a major cause of war. Proponents of this theory point to the constant warfare in the 17th and 18th centuries among European countries whose governments were predominantly mercantilist and protectionist, the American Revolution, which came about ostensibly due to British tariffs and taxes. According to a slogan of Frédéric Bastiat (1801–1850), &quot;When goods cannot cross borders, armies will.&quot;

On the other hand, archaeologist Lawrence H. Keeley argues in his book War Before Civilization that disputes between trading partners escalate to war more frequently than disputes between nations that don&#x27;t trade much with each other. The Opium Wars were fought between the UK and China over the right of British merchants to engage in the free trade of opium. For many opium users, what started as recreation soon became a punishing addiction: many people who stopped ingesting opium suffered chills, nausea, and cramps, and sometimes died from withdrawal. Once addicted, people would often do almost anything to continue to get access to the drug.

Barbara Tuchman says both European intellectuals and leaders overestimated the power of free trade on the eve of World War I. They believed that the interconnectedness of European nations through trade would stop a continent-wide war from breaking out, as the economic consequences would be too great. However, the assumption proved incorrect. For example, Tuchman noted that Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, when warned of such consequences, refused to even consider them in his plans, arguing he was a &quot;soldier,&quot; not an &quot;economist.&quot;

===Economic impact===

====Living standards====
A 2016 study found that &quot;trade typically favors the poor&quot;, as they spend a greater share of their earnings on goods, as free trade reduces the costs of goods. Other research found that China&#x27;s entry to the WTO benefited US consumers, as the price of Chinese goods were substantially reduced. Harvard economist Dani Rodrik argues that while globalization and free trade does contribute to social problems, &quot;a serious retreat into protectionism would hurt the many groups that benefit from trade and would result in the same kind of social conflicts that globalization itself generates. We have to recognize that erecting trade barriers will help in only a limited set of circumstances and that trade policy will rarely be the best response to the problems [of globalization]&quot;.

====Growth====
According to economic historians Findlay and O&#x27;Rourke, there is a consensus in the economics literature that protectionist policies in the interwar period &quot;hurt the world economy overall, although there is a debate about whether the effect was large or small.&quot;

Economic historian Paul Bairoch argued that economic protection was positively correlated with economic and industrial growth during the 19th century. For example, GNP growth during Europe&#x27;s &quot;liberal period&quot; in the middle of the century (where tariffs were at their lowest), averaged 1.7% per year, while industrial growth averaged 1.8% per year. However, during the protectionist era of the 1870s and 1890s, GNP growth averaged 2.6% per year, while industrial output grew at 3.8% per year, roughly twice as fast as it had during the liberal era of low tariffs and free trade. One study found that tariffs imposed on manufactured goods increase economic growth in developing countries, and this growth impact remains even after the tariffs are repealed.

According to Dartmouth economist Douglas Irwin, &quot;that there is a correlation between high tariffs and growth in the late nineteenth century cannot be denied. But correlation is not causation... there is no reason for necessarily thinking that import protection was a good policy just because the economic outcome was good: the outcome could have been driven by factors completely unrelated to the tariff, or perhaps could have been even better in the absence of protection.&quot; Irwin furthermore writes that &quot;few observers have argued outright that the high tariffs caused such growth.&quot;

One study by the economic historian Brian Varian found no correlation between tariffs and growth among the Australian colonies in the late nineteenth century, a time when each of the colonies had the independence to set their own tariffs.

According to Oxford economic historian Kevin O&#x27;Rourke, &quot;It seems clear that protection was important for the growth of US manufacturing in the first half of the 19th century; but this does not necessarily imply that the tariff was beneficial for GDP growth. Protectionists have often pointed to German and American industrialization during this period as evidence in favor of their position, but economic growth is influenced by many factors other than trade policy, and it is important to control for these when assessing the links between tariffs and growth.&quot;

A prominent 1999 study by Jeffrey A. Frankel and David H. Romer found, contrary to free trade skeptics&#x27; claims, while controlling for relevant factors, that trade does indeed have a positive impact on growth and incomes.

Economist Arvind Panagariya criticizes the view that protectionism is good for growth. Such arguments, according to him, arise from &quot;revisionist interpretation&quot; of East Asian &quot;tigers&quot;&#x27; economic history. The Asian tigers achieved a rapid increase in per capita income without any &quot;redistributive social programs&quot;, through free trade, which advanced Western economies took a century to achieve.

====Developing world====
There is broad consensus among economists that free trade helps workers in developing countries, even though they are not subject to the stringent health and labor standards of developed countries. This is because &quot;the growth of manufacturing—and of the myriad other jobs that the new export sector creates—has a ripple effect throughout the economy&quot; that creates competition among producers, lifting wages and living conditions. The Nobel laureates Milton Friedman and Paul Krugman have argued for free trade as a model for economic development. Alan Greenspan, former chair of the American Federal Reserve, has criticized protectionist proposals as leading &quot;to an atrophy of our competitive ability. ... If the protectionist route is followed, newer, more efficient industries will have less scope to expand, and overall output and economic welfare will suffer.&quot;

Protectionists postulate that new industries may require protection from entrenched foreign competition in order to develop. Mainstream economists do concede that tariffs can in the short-term help domestic industries to develop but are contingent on the short-term nature of the protective tariffs and the ability of the government to pick the winners. The problems are that protective tariffs will not be reduced after the infant industry reaches a foothold, and that governments will not pick industries that are likely to succeed. Economists have identified a number of cases across different countries and industries where attempts to shelter infant industries failed.

The United States, which today has the largest economy in the world and one of the highest GDP per capita, has employed tariffs throughout much of its history. Alexander Hamilton, the first United States Secretary of the Treasury, supported tariffs at the country&#x27;s inception in his 1791 Report on Manufactures. Abraham Lincoln signed the 1861 Morrill Tariff to raise revenue during the United States Civil War. The Republican Party (United States), a fiscally conservative political party, currently supports and has historically supported protectionism.
==== Intellectual property ====

The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) is an international legal agreement between all the member nations of the World Trade Organization (WTO). It establishes minimum standards for the regulation by national governments of different forms of intellectual property (IP) as applied to nationals of other WTO member nations. TRIPS was negotiated at the end of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) between 1989 and 1990 and is administered by the WTO. Statements by the World Bank indicate that TRIPS has not led to a demonstrable acceleration of investment to low-income countries, though it may have done so for middle-income countries.

Critics argue that TRIPS limits the ability of governments to introduce competition for generic producers. The TRIPS agreement allows the grant of compulsory licenses at a nation&#x27;s discretion. TRIPS-plus conditions in the United States&#x27; FTAs with Australia, Jordan, Singapore and Vietnam have restricted the application of compulsory licenses to emergency situations, antitrust remedies, and cases of public non-commercial use.

====Access to essential medicines====
One of the most visible conflicts over TRIPS has been AIDS drugs in Africa. Despite the role that patents have played in maintaining higher drug costs for public health programs across Africa, this controversy has not led to a revision of TRIPS. Instead, an interpretive statement, the Doha Declaration, was issued in November 2001, which indicated that TRIPS should not prevent states from dealing with public health crises and allowed for compulsory licenses. After Doha, PhRMA, the United States and to a lesser extent other developed nations began working to minimize the effect of the declaration.

In 2020, conflicts re-emerged over patents, copyrights and trade secrets related to COVID-19 vaccines, diagnostics and treatments. South Africa and India proposed that WTO grant a temporary waiver to enable more widespread production of the vaccines, since suppressing the virus as quickly as possible benefits the entire world. The waivers would be in addition to the existing, but cumbersome, flexibilities in TRIPS allowing countries to impose compulsory licenses. Over 100 developing nations supported the waiver but it was blocked by the G7 members. This blocking was condemned by 400 organizations including Doctors Without Borders and 115 members of the European Parliament. In June 2022, after extensive involvement of the European Union, the WTO instead adopted a watered-down agreement that focuses only on vaccine patents, excludes high-income countries and China, and contains few provisions that are not covered by existing flexibilities.

==Current world trends==

Certain policies of First World governments have been criticized as protectionist, such as the Common Agricultural Policy in the European Union, longstanding agricultural subsidies and proposed &quot;Buy American&quot; provisions in economic recovery packages in the United States.

Heads of the G20 meeting in London on 2 April 2009 pledged &quot;We will not repeat the historic mistakes of protectionism of previous eras&quot;. Adherence to this pledge is monitored by the Global Trade Alert, providing up-to-date information and informed commentary to help ensure that the G20 pledge is met by maintaining confidence in the world trading system, deterring beggar-thy-neighbor acts and preserving the contribution that exports could play in the future recovery of the world economy.

Although they were reiterating what they had already committed to in the 2008 Washington G20 summit, 17 of these 20 countries were reported by the World Bank as having imposed trade restrictive measures since then. In its report, the World Bank says most of the world&#x27;s major economies are resorting to protectionist measures as the global economic slowdown begins to bite. Economists who have examined the impact of new trade-restrictive measures using detailed bilaterally monthly trade statistics estimated that new measures taken through late 2009 were distorting global merchandise trade by 0.25% to 0.5% (about $50 billion a year).

Since then, however, President Donald Trump announced in January 2017 the U.S. was abandoning the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) deal, saying, &quot;We&#x27;re going to stop the ridiculous trade deals that have taken everybody out of our country and taken companies out of our country, and it&#x27;s going to be reversed.&quot; President Joe Biden has largely continued Trump&#x27;s protectionist policies, and has not negotiated any new free trade agreements since assuming office in January 2021.

The 2010s and early 2020s have seen an increased use of protectionist economic policies across both developed countries and developing countries worldwide.

<text>The Chams (Cham: , چام, &quot;cam&quot;), or Champa people (Cham: , اوراڠ چمڤا, &quot;Urang Campa&quot;; or ; , ), are an Austronesian ethnic group in Southeast Asia and are the original inhabitants of central Vietnam and coastal Cambodia before the arrival of the Cambodians and Vietnamese, during the expansion of the Khmer Empire (802–1431) and the Vietnamese conquest of Champa (11th–19th century).

From the 2nd century, the Chams founded Champa, a collection of independent Hindu-Buddhist principalities in what is now central and southern Vietnam. By the 17th century, Champa became an Islamic sultanate. Today, the Cham people are largely Muslim, with a minority following Hinduism, both formed the indigenous Muslim and Hindu population in both Cambodia and Vietnam. Despite their adherence to Islam, the Cham people still retain their ancestral practice of matriarchy in family and inheritance.

The Cham people speak Cham and Tsat (the latter is spoken by the Utsuls, a Cham subgroup on China&#x27;s Hainan Island), the two Chamic languages from the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian family. The Cham people were one among several ethnic groups that were primarily targeted by the Khmer Rouge&#x27;s ethnic cleansing campaign during the Cambodian genocide (1975–1979).
==History==


For a long time, researchers believed that the Chams had arrived by sea in the first millennium BC from Sumatra, Borneo and the Malay Peninsula, eventually settling in central modern Vietnam.

The original Chams are therefore the likely heirs of Austronesian navigators from Taiwan and Borneo, whose main activities are commerce, transport and perhaps also piracy. Austronesian Chamic peoples might have migrated into present-day Central Vietnam around 3 kya to 2.5 kya (1,000 to 500 BC). With having formed a thalassocracy leaving traces in written sources, they invested the ports at the start of important trade routes linking India, China and Indonesian islands. Historians are now no longer disputing in associating the Sa Huynh culture (1000 BC–200 AD) with the ancestors of the Cham people and other Chamic-speaking groups.

Patterns and chronology of migration remain debated and it is assumed that the Cham people, the only Austronesian ethnic group originated from South Asia, arrived later in peninsular Southeast Asia via Borneo. Mainland Southeast Asia had been populated on land routes by members of the Austroasiatic language family, such as the Mon people and the Khmer people around 5,000 years ago. The Chams were accomplished Austronesian seafarers that from centuries populated and soon dominated maritime Southeast Asia. Earliest known records of Cham presence in Indochina date back to the second century CE. Population centers were located on the river outlets along the coast. As they controlled the import/export trade of continental Southeast Asia, they enjoyed a prosperous maritime economy.

Cham folklore includes a creation myth in which the founder of the Cham people was a certain Lady Po Nagar. According to Cham mythology, Lady Po Nagar was born out of sea foam and clouds in the sky. However, in Vietnamese mythology, which adopted the goddess after taking over the Champa kingdom, her name is Thiên Y A Na and she instead came from a humble peasant home somewhere in the Dai An Mountains, Khánh Hòa Province, spirits assisted her as she traveled to China on a floating log of sandalwood where she married a man of royalty and had two children. She eventually returned to Champa &quot;did many good deeds in helping the sick and the poor&quot; and &quot;a temple was erected in her honor&quot;.

===Early history===

Like countless other political entities of Southeast Asia, the Champa principalities underwent the process of Indianization since the early common era as a result of centuries of socio-economic interaction adopted and introduced cultural and institutional elements of India. From the 8th century onward, Muslims from such regions as Gujarat began to increasingly appear in trade and shipping of India. Islamic ideas became a part of the vast tide of exchange, treading the same path as Hinduism and Buddhism centuries before. Cham people picked up these ideas by the 11th century. This can be seen in the architecture of Cham temples, which shares similarities with the one of the Angkor temples. Ad-Dimashqi writes in 1325, &quot;the country of Champa... is inhabited by Muslims and idolaters. The Muslim religion came there during the time of Caliph Uthman... and Ali, many Muslims who were expelled by the Umayyads and by Hajjaj, fled there&quot;.

The &quot;Daoyi Zhilüe&quot; records that at Cham ports, Cham women were often married to Chinese merchants, who frequently came back to them after trading voyages. A Chinese merchant from Quanzhou, Wang Yuanmao, traded extensively with Champa and married a Cham princess.

In the 12th century, the Chams fought a series of wars with the Khmer Empire to the west. In 1177, the Chams and their allies launched an attack from the lake Tonlé Sap and managed to sack the Khmer capital of Angkor. In 1181, however, they were defeated by the Khmer King Jayavarman VII.

===Encounter with Islam===
Islam first arrived in Champa around the ninth century; however, it did not become significant among the Cham people until after the eleventh century.

Chams who migrated to Sulu were Orang Dampuan. Champa and Sulu engaged in commerce with each other which resulted in merchant Chams settling in Sulu where they were known as Orang Dampuan from the 10th-13th centuries. The Orang Dampuan were slaughtered by envious native Sulu Buranuns due to the wealth of the Orang Dampuan. The Buranun were then subjected to retaliatory slaughter by the Orang Dampuan. Harmonious commerce between Sulu and the Orang Dampuan was later restored. The Yakans were descendants of the Taguima-based Orang Dampuan who came to Sulu from Champa. Sulu received civilization in its Indic form from the Orang Dampuan.

A number of Chams also fled across the sea to the Malay Peninsula and as early as the 15th century, a Cham colony was established in Malacca. The Chams encountered Sunni Islam there as the Malacca Sultanate was officially Muslim since 1414. The King of Champa then became an ally of the Johor Sultanate; in 1594, Champa sent its military forces to fight alongside Johor against the Portuguese occupation of Malacca. Between 1607 and 1676, one of the Champa kings converted to Islam and it became a dominant feature of Cham society. The Chams also adopted the Jawi alphabet.
Historical records in Indonesia showed the influence of Queen Dwarawati, a Muslim princess from the kingdom of Champa, toward her husband, Kertawijaya, the Seventh King of Majapahit Empire, so that the royal family of the Majapahit Empire eventually converted to Islam, which finally led to the conversion to Islam of the entire region. Chams Princess tomb can be found in Trowulan, the site of the capital of the Majapahit Empire. In Babad Tanah Jawi, it is said that the king of Brawijaya V has a wife named Dewi Anarawati (or Dewi Dwarawati), a Muslim daughter of the King of Champa (Chams). Chams had trade and close cultural ties with the maritime kingdom of Srivijaya in the Malay Archipelago .

Another significant figure from Champa in the history of Islam in Indonesia is Raden Rakhmat (Prince Rahmat) who&#x27;s also known as Sunan Ampel, one of Wali Sanga (Nine Saints), who spread Islam in Java. He is considered as a focal point of the Wali Sanga, because several of them were actually his descendants and/or his students. His father is Maulana Malik Ibrahim also known as Ibrahim as-Samarkandy (&quot;Ibrahim Asmarakandi&quot; to Javanese ears), and his mother is Dewi Candrawulan, a princess of Champa who&#x27;s also the sister of Queen Dwarawati. Sunan Ampel was born in Champa in 1401 CE. He came to Java in 1443 CE, in order to visit his aunt Queen Dwarawati, a princess of Champa who married to Kertawijaya (Brawijaya V), the King of Majapahit Empire. Local legend says that he built the Great Mosque of Demak (Masjid Agung Demak) in 1479 CE, but other legends attribute that work to Sunan Kalijaga. Sunan Ampel died in Demak in 1481 CE, but is buried in Ampel Mosque at Surabaya, East Java.

Recent scholarship, however, has shown that widespread conversion to Islam came much later. Poorly studied artifacts such as Islamic graves (which simply could have been ships&#x27; ballast) have been reexamined to show that they were, in fact, Tunisian and not Cham. Poorly conducted linguistic research attempting to link vocabulary to Arabic has been debunked as well. Rather, there is no sound evidence for widespread conversion to Islam until the 16th century.

===Wars with the Vietnamese===
Between the rise of the Khmer Empire around 800 and the Vietnamese&#x27;s territorial expansion southwards from Jiaozhi and, later, Đại Việt, Champa began to shrink. At a disadvantage against Dai Viet&#x27;s army of 300,000 troops, the Cham army of 100,000 were overwhelmed. In the Cham–Vietnamese War (1471), Champa suffered serious defeats at the hands of the Vietnamese, in which 120,000 people were either captured or killed, and the kingdom was reduced to a small enclave near Nha Trang with many Chams fleeing to Cambodia. Champa was no longer a threat to Vietnam, and some were even enslaved by their victors.

The Chams were matrilineal and inheritance passed through the mother. Because of this, in 1499 the Vietnamese enacted a law banning marriage between Cham women and Vietnamese men, regardless of class. The Vietnamese also issued instructions in the capital to kill all Chams within the vicinity. More attacks by the Vietnamese continued and in 1693 the Champa Kingdom&#x27;s territory was integrated as part of Vietnamese territory.

The trade in Vietnamese ceramics was damaged due to the plummet in trade by Cham merchants after the Vietnamese invasion. Vietnam&#x27;s export of ceramics was also damaged by its internal civil war, the Portuguese and Spanish entry into the region and the Portuguese conquest of Malacca which caused an upset in the trading system, while the carracks ships in the Malacca to Macao trade run by the Portuguese docked at Brunei due to good relations between the Portuguese and Brunei after the Chinese permitted Macao to be leased to the Portuguese.

When the Ming dynasty in China fell, several thousand Chinese refugees fled south and extensively settled on Cham lands and in Cambodia. Most of these Chinese were young males, and they took Cham women as wives. Their children identified more with Chinese culture. This migration occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Chams participated in defeating the Spanish invasion of Cambodia. Cambodian king Cau Bana Cand Ramadhipati, also known as &#x27;Sultan Ibrahim&#x27;, launched the Cambodian–Dutch War to expel the Dutch. The Vietnamese Nguyen Lords toppled Ibrahim from power to restore Buddhist rule.

In the 18th century and the 19th century, Cambodian-based Chams settled in Bangkok.

===Fall of the Champa kingdom===
Further expansion by the Vietnamese in 1692 resulted in the total annexation of the Champa kingdom Panduranga and dissolution by the 19th century Vietnamese Emperor, Minh Mạng. In response, the last Cham Muslim king, Pô Chien, gathered his people in the hinterland and fled south to Cambodia, while those along the coast migrated to Trengganu (Malaysia). A small group fled northward to the Chinese island of Hainan where they are known today as the Utsuls. The king and his people who took refuge in Cambodia were scattered in communities across the Mekong Basin. Those who remained in the Nha Trang, Phan Rang, Phan Rí, and Phan Thiết provinces of central Vietnam were absorbed into the Vietnamese polity. Cham provinces were seized by the Nguyen Lords.

After Vietnam invaded and conquered Champa, Cambodia granted refuge to Cham Muslims escaping from Vietnamese conquest.

In 1832, the Vietnamese Emperor Minh Mang annexed the last Champa Kingdom. This resulted in the Cham Muslim leader Katip Sumat, who was educated in Kelantan, declaring a Jihad against the Vietnamese. The Vietnamese coercively fed lizard and pig meat to Cham Muslims and cow meat to Cham Hindus against their will to punish them and assimilate them to Vietnamese culture. The second revolt led by Ja Thak Wa, a Bani cleric, resulting in the establishment of a Cham resistance which lasted from 1834 to 1835 until it was bloody crushed by Minh Mang&#x27;s forces in July 1835. Only 40,000 Chams remained in the old Panduranga territory in 1885.

=== 20th century ===

At the division of Vietnam in 1954, the majority of Chams remained in South Vietnam. A handful of Chams who were members of the Viet Minh went North during the population exchange between North and South known as Operation Passage to Freedom – along with around ten thousand indigenous highland peoples – mainly Chamic and Bahnaric – from South Vietnam. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam during its early years (1954–1960) were actually more favorable toward ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples, compared to Republic of Vietnam, attacking Ngo Dinh Diem&#x27;s Kinh chauvinist attitudes. Leaders of Communist Party of Vietnam at the time promised equal rights and autonomy, and by 1955 the North&#x27;s national broadcast station Voice of Việt Nam began broadcasting propaganda radio in Rhadé, Bahnar, and Jarai, to recruit support from the South&#x27;s indigenous groups. These cultivation efforts later contributed to the foundation of the FULRO in 1964, although FULRO&#x27;s objective was to fight against both North and South Vietnam.

In Cambodia, due to discriminatory treatments of the colonial and following Sihanouk governments, the Cham communities here sought communism. The Chams began to rise in prominence in Cambodian politics when they joined the communists as early as the 1950s, with a Cham elder, Sos Man joining the Indochina Communist Party and rising through the ranks to become a major in the Party&#x27;s forces. He then returned home to the Eastern Zone in 1970 and joined the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK), and he co-established the Eastern Zone Islamic Movement with his son, Mat Ly. Together, they became the mouthpiece of the Khmer Rouge and they encouraged the Cham people to participate in the revolution. Sos Man&#x27;s Islamic Movement was also tolerated by the Khmer Rouge&#x27;s leadership between 1970 and 1975. The Chams were gradually forced to abandon their faith and their distinct practices, a campaign which was launched in the Southwest as early as 1972.

In the 1960s various movements emerged calling for the creation of a separate Cham state in Vietnam. The Front for the Liberation of Champa (FLC) and the dominated. The latter group sought greater alliance with other hill tribe minorities. Initially known as &quot; from 1946 to 1960, the group later took the designation &quot; and joined, with the FLC, the &quot; (FULRO) at some point in the 1960s. Since the late 1970s, there has been no serious Cham secessionist movement or political activity in Vietnam or Cambodia.

During the Vietnam War, a sizable number of Chams migrated to Peninsular Malaysia, where they were granted sanctuary by the Malaysian government out of sympathy for fellow Muslims; most of them have now assimilated with Malay cultures. The integrated community who self identifies as &quot;Melayu Champa&quot; (&quot;Champa Malay&quot;) has dabbled into trades of agarwood, clothing (especially in Kelantan) and fishery (in coastal Pahang) from their arrival in the late 1970s to the 80s.

The Cham community suffered a major blow during the Cambodian genocide in Democratic Kampuchea. The Khmer Rouge targeted ethnic minorities like Chinese, Thai, Lao, Vietnamese and the Cham people, though the Chams suffered the largest death toll in proportion to their population. Around 80,000 to 100,000 Chams out of a total Cham population of 250,000 people in 1975, died in the genocide.

== 21st century ==


The Chams in Vietnam are officially recognized by the Vietnamese government as one of 54 ethnic groups. There has also been wide-reaching recognition of the historical Champa Kingdom.

An attempt at Salafist expansion among the Chams in Vietnam has been halted by Vietnamese government controls; however, the loss of the Salafis among Chams has been to the benefit of Tablighi Jamaat.

There is evidence that some Acehnese people of Aceh, Sumatra, Indonesia are descendants of Cham refugees who fled after defeat by the Vietnamese polity in the 15th century.

==Geography==

Eastern Chams (also known as &quot;Panduranga Chams&quot; or &quot;Phan Rang Chams&quot;) and their related ethnic groups, Raglai and Churu, are a major minority in Panduranga region in Bình Thuận and Ninh Thuận provinces of Vietnam. The Haroi Chams mainly populate in Đồng Xuân district of Phu Yen and Vân Canh district of Bình Định province. They are the core of the Hindu and Bani population.

The Western Cham population is concentrated between the in Cambodia and in Southern Vietnam, mainly in Kampong Cham province and An Giang province. In Kampot province, communities of Chvea of Malay origin also identify themselves as Cham. Chams also made significant presence in other southern Vietnamese provinces like Đồng Nai, Tây Ninh, Kiên Giang, and even as far as in Ninh Thuận, as well as having a large minority presence in Ho Chi Minh City. This group represents the core of the Muslim communities in both Cambodia and Vietnam. Including the diaspora, their total is about 400,000. An additional 4,000 Chams live in Bangkok, Thailand, whose ancestors migrated there during Rama I&#x27;s reign. Recent immigrants to Thailand are mainly students and workers, who preferably seek work and education in the southern Islamic Pattani, Narathiwat, Yala and Songkhla provinces.

After the fall of Saigon in Vietnam and Phnom Penh in Cambodia in 1975, 9,704 Cham refugees made their way to Malaysia and were allowed to stay, unlike 250,000 other refugees that fled to Malaysia. Most of the Cham refugees came from Cambodia and were Muslims, known as &quot;Melayu Kemboja&quot; and &quot;Melayu Champa&quot; in Malay. Many of these Cham refugees chose to settle in Malaysia, as they preferred to live in an Islamic country and had family ties in the Malaysian states of Kelantan and Terengganu. Kelantan served as a center of Islamic teachings for Chams in Cambodia for three to four centuries and many Cambodian Chams had relatives living there, subsequently many Chams chose to settle in Kelantan. By 1985, around 50,000 or more Chams were living in Malaysia. As of 2013, many have been integrated into Malaysian society.

==Politics==
While historically complicated, the modern Chams of Cambodia and Vietnam have had friendly relationships with the Khmer and Vietnamese majority. Despite ethnic and religious differences, the majority people of Cambodia and Vietnam have accepted the Chams as closer to them than other minorities. Some Muslim Chams report a friendly attitude of both Cambodians and Vietnamese toward the Chams and little harassment against them from locals. However, between government and people, it is difficult to categorize. According to Cham human rights activists, the Vietnamese regime, the fears of historical influence has evolved into suppression of Islam among Muslims Chams. For example, there is an unofficial ban on distributing the Quran and other Islamic scripture. Even with Vietnam&#x27;s growing relations with Muslim states like Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey and Egypt, the regime discourages growth of Islam because the Vietnamese government distrusts the Cham Muslims.

&quot;Relations between the Hanoi government and ethnic minorities are sensitive. In 2001 and 2004 massive human rights protests by hill tribes resulted in deaths and mass imprisonments. For some time after that, the Central Highlands were sealed off to foreigners.&quot;

According to international scholars, it&#x27;s observed that both modern Cham separatism and Cham nationhood are non-existent. The only active representative organization for the Chams, the International Office of Champa (IOC), whose headquarter locates in San Jose, California, only demands civil and land rights for the Cham people in Vietnam and Cambodia. Criticism and concerns against Vietnamese, Indian, Malaysian governments and tourist corporations for misappropriating Cham heritage and ignoring living indigenous culture was made by the IOC and international scientists in recent years.

== Genetics ==
Several studies state that Chams descend from islander Southeast Asian immigrants who later intermixed with mainland Southeast Asians, such as Mon-Khmers and other Austroasiatic groups. Because of this, Chams primarily have Austroasiatic ancestry like other Vietnamese Austronesian groups such as Ede and Giarai. But compared to Ede and Giarai, they share slightly more ancestry with Taiwanese Austronesian groups and have ~10% ancestry from an ancestor of the Atayal. Low to moderate frequencies of South Asian Y-haplogroups are also found in Chams, such as R-M17 (13.6%), R-M124 (3.4%) and H-M69 (1.7%), which is corroborated by a similar proportion of South Asian admixture.

==Culture==
The Cham culture is diverse and rich because of the combination of indigenous cultural elements (plains culture, maritime culture, and mountain culture) and foreign cultural features (Indian cultures and religions such as Buddhism; early Han Chinese influences; Islam) (Phan Xuan Bien et al. 1991:376). The blend of indigenous and foreign elements in Cham culture is a result of ecological, social, and historical conditions. The influences of various Indian cultures produced similarities among many groups in Southeast Asia such as the Chams, who traded or communicated with polities on the Indian subcontinent. However, the indigenous elements also allow for cultural distinctions. As an example, Brahmanism became the Ahier religion, while other aspects of influence were changed, to adapt to local Ahier characteristics and environment. The blending of various cultures has produced its own unique form through the prolific production of sculptures and architecture only seen at the Champa temple tower sites.

The Chams shielded and always observed their girls attentively, placing great importance on their virginity. A Cham saying said &quot;As well leave a man alone with a girl, as an elephant in a field of sugarcane.&quot;

The Cham Muslims view the karoeh (also spelled karoh) ceremony for girls as very significant. This symbolic ceremony marks the passage of a girl from infancy to puberty (the marriageable age), and usually takes place when the girl is aged fifteen and has completed her development. If it has not taken place, the girl cannot marry since she is &quot;tabung&quot;. After the ceremony is done the girl can marry. Circumcision to the Chams was less significant than karoeh. It is not practiced, only symbolic and performed with a toy wooden knife.

Important festivals include Kate, celebrated mainly by the Chams of central Vietnam. The festival venerates ancient Cham royalty gods. Among Cham Muslims, Ramadan, El Fitri, and the Hajj are important celebrations. However, the Chams (regardless of faith) all have a very rich tradition of dance, arts, music, costumes, poetry, and more.

=== Language ===
The Cham language is part of the Austronesian language family. Although sparse, Cham literary tradition is ancient, dating back to the 4th century AD. The Dong Yen Chau inscription, written in old Cham, is the oldest known attestation of an Austronesian language. Cham is very rich with many loan words and terminology influenced by many other languages it came into contact with. Most Chams speak the language though many also speak the dominant language of the nation they reside in like Vietnamese, Khmer, Malay and others. Some Chams can also speak and write Arabic.

Cham is written in Eastern Cham script in Central Vietnam while the language is predominantly written in Jawi Arabic script around the Mekong Delta. Western Cham script, used in Cambodia, is different enough from Eastern Cham&#x27;s to be under review by the Unicode Consortium for inclusion as its own block — as of 2022, the character set is still being revised.

The Kan Imam San sect, accounting for about 10% of the Cambodian Cham minority and mainly centered around a few villages in the Tralach District of Kampong Chhnang Province and their historic mosque atop Phnom Oudong, have kept the use of the Western Cham script, akhar srak, alive — with grants from the US embassy for about a decade starting in 2007, the written form of Western Cham has moved from the preserve of a few elders to being taught in close to 20 classrooms with thousands of students exposed to some degree, albeit limited.

Almost all of the existing texts are housed at two Kan Imam San mosques in Kampong Tralach, primarily at the Au Russey mosque.

===Religion===
The first recorded religion of the Champa was a form of Shaiva Hinduism, brought by sea from India. Hinduism was the predominant religion among the Cham people until the sixteenth century. Numerous temples dedicated to Shiva were constructed in the central part of what is now Vietnam. The jewel of such temple is Mỹ Sơn. It is often compared with other historical temple complexes in Southeast Asia, such as Borobudur of Java in Indonesia, Angkor Wat of Cambodia, Bagan of Myanmar and Ayutthaya of Thailand. As of 1999, Mỹ Sơn has been recognised by UNESCO as a world heritage site.

Religiously and culturally, the Chams were grouped into two major religio-cultural groups; the Balamon Chams that adhere to an indigenized form of Hinduism, and Cham Bani that adhere to an indigenized form of Shi&#x27;a Islam. The term &quot;Balamon&quot; derived from &quot;Brahmana, the priests. The term &quot;Bani&quot; on the other hand is derived from Arabic term &quot;bani&quot; (بني) which means &quot;people&quot;. Balamon Chams adhere to the old religion of their ancestor, an indigenized form of Hinduism that thrived since the ancient era of Kingdom of Champa in 5th century AD, whereas Cham Bani are adherents of a localized version of Shi&#x27;a Islam, including a minor element of Sufism, endured with Hindu-Chamic customs as early as around the 11th–13th century. However, it was not until 17th century that Islam began to attract large numbers of Chams, when some members of the Cham royalty converted to Islam. These two groups mostly live in separate villages. Intermarriage was prohibited in former times, and remains rare even nowadays. Both groups are matrilineal and conform to matrilocal residence practice.
As Muslim merchants of Arab and of Persian origin stopped along the Vietnam coast en route to China, Islam began to influence Cham civilization. The exact date that Islam came to Champa is unknown; however, the religion first arrived around the ninth century. It is generally assumed that Islam came to mainland Southeast Asia much later than its arrival in China during the Tang dynasty (618–907) and that Arab traders in the region came into direct contact only with the Chams and not others. Islam began making headway among the Chams beginning in the eleventh century, however it split into two distinctive versions.

* The version of Islam practiced by the Vietnamese Chams in Central Vietnam is often called Bani which contains many pre-Islamic beliefs and rituals such as magic, spirit worship, and propitiation of the souls of former kings, something mistaken to Hinduism. Bani Islam is the syncretic form of Shi&#x27;a Islam (including minor influences from Sunni and Sufism teaching) that blends indigenous cultural beliefs that are practiced by the Cham Bani, who predominantly live in Vietnam&#x27;s Bình Thuận and Ninh Thuận Provinces, and is considered unorthodox from mainstream Islam. The Cham Bani worship in mosques which are where the main communal setting for prayers and religious rituals take place among the Bani Cham They also celebrate the month of Ramuwan (Ramadan), during which they pray to Allah for their deceased ancestors in the hereafter and pray for good fortune in the lives, and the &quot;acar&quot; (Imams) stay at the thang magik (Mosques) for one month and pray to God the practice is known as Iʿtikāf. In general, the Bani Muslims are not willing to identify themselves as Shi&#x27;a or even Muslims, but as Bani Muslims instead, although some even openly reject the terms &quot;Muslims&quot; in favour of &quot;Banis&quot; alone. It should be noted, however, that the notion of Bani being an Islamic sect is only a norm used by the official narratives, while most Muslim scholars reject Bani as an Islamic sect due to its abnormal practise unseen even in mainstream Shia Islam, where Bani originated from.
* The version of Islam practised by Cambodian and Southern Vietnamese Chams belong to mainstream Sunni Islam, mainly to the Shafi&#x27;i school, which is also found in Malaysia, Indonesia, Mindanao, Southern Thailand as well as Yemen and East Africa, and in general, they largely abide with the mainstream Sunni Islamic practise, such as observing Ramadan, Mawlid, Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha, Ashura, Islamic New Year, as well as doing Hajj and Umrah. At some aspects however, due to interaction with other religions and thoughts at the same time, mainly from influences of Confucianism, Mahayana Buddhism, Hinduism and Theravada Buddhism, it has many indigenous, magical, Hindu and Buddhist elements to it; while some practice a more centralized form of Sunni Islam and some reformist movements like Salafism can also be found. However, a small band of Chams, who called themselves Kaum Jumaat, follow a localized adaptation of Islamic theology, according to which they pray only on Fridays and celebrate Ramadan for only three days. Some members of this group have joined the larger Muslim Cham community in their practices of Islam in recent years. One of the factors for this change is the influence by members of their family who have gone abroad to study Islam.

====Numbers====
The number of Balamon Cham Hindus in Vietnam were declared at 64,547 (36%) out of a total Cham population of 178,948 according to the 2019 population census. They do not have a caste system, although previously they may have been divided between the Nagavamshi Kshatriya and the Brahmin castes, the latter of which would have represented a small minority of the population.

Hindu temples are known as &quot;Bimong&quot; in Cham language, but are commonly referred to as &quot;&quot; &quot;stupa&quot;, in Vietnamese. The priests are divided into three levels, where the highest rank are known as &quot;Po Adhia&quot; or &quot;Po Sá&quot;, followed by &quot;Po Tapáh&quot; and the junior priests &quot;Po Paséh&quot;. By the 17th century, due to pressures from king Po Rome, the Ahier (Balamon) were forced to accept Allah as the most supreme God while retaining the worships of other Balamon deities in their faiths.

The majority of Hindu Chams in Vietnam (also known as the Eastern Chams) are syncretic Ahiér Hindu and Bani Muslims and they mostly live in Central Vietnam, while Southern Vietnam&#x27;s Chams and their Cambodian counterparts are largely Sunni Muslim, as Islamic conversion happened relatively late. A number emigrated to France in the late 1960s during the Vietnam War. In the Mekong Delta, the mainly Cham Sunni community has a population of around 25,000 in 2006.

=== Cuisine ===
Popular Cham dishes are &quot;muthin ritong&quot; (rice with fish), &quot;lithei jrau&quot; (rice with meat and vegetables), &quot;abu mutham&quot; (gruel with fish and vegetables), and &quot;kari cam murong&quot; (chicken or beef curry). A specialty of Chams in An Giang province is the beef sausage &quot;tung lamaow&quot; (Cham: ꨓꨭꩂ ꨤꨟꨯꨱꨥ). Chams in this province are also known for their beef, goat or chicken curry with rice.

Chams eat three meals a day – breakfast, lunch and dinner – with rice, maize, sweet potato and beans being the staple food. Other foods eaten by the Chams depend on the region they inhabit. Chams in Central Vietnam eat meat and processed meat products and arrange food in trays and use chopsticks and bowls similar to Kinh people, while Chams in Southern Vietnam eat fish and shrimps and arrange food on plates. Cham cuisine is also diversified by the food prohibitions in religions practised by Chams: Hindu Chams not eating beef, and Muslim Chams not eating pork, while Buddhism-practicing Cham Hroi of Phú Yên and Bình Định provinces in Vietnam eating both beef and pork.

Cham cuisine is very similar to the cuisines of Cambodia, Laos and Northern Thailand. It is sweeter and spicier than the cuisine of Northern Vietnam and uses many different types of fermented fish (&quot;mắm&quot;), including &quot;mắm nêm&quot;, which along with different spices, curries and other Cham dishes entered the cuisine of Southern Vietnam following the Vietnamese conquest and annexation of Champa during Vietnam&#x27;s southward expansion. Another type of &quot;mắm&quot; that may have originally been a Cham product is &quot;&quot;, which has become a famous condiment in modern-day Central Vietnam eaten with raw vegetables, herbs and boiled pork and used as an essential ingredient for the Central Vietnamese noodle dish &quot;bún bò Huế&quot;.

In Malaysia, where the majority of Chams are from Cambodia, most of their dishes, such as &quot;leas hal&quot;, &quot;num banhchok&quot;, and &quot;num kong&quot;, are of Cambodian origin, while the Cham style of coffee (&quot;café Yuon&quot;) and green tea have been adopted from the Vietnamese. Other Malaysia&#x27;s Cham dishes, such as &quot;tung lamaow&quot; and &quot;paynong&quot; (banana-filled glutinous rice cakes wrapped in banana leaves) are known by Chams in both Cambodia and Vietnam.

<doc id="153029" wikidata="Q150782" url="?curid=153029" title="Empress Elisabeth of Austria">
<text>Elisabeth (born Duchess Elisabeth Amalie Eugenie in Bavaria; 24 December 1837 – 10 September 1898), nicknamed Sisi or Sissi, was Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary from her marriage to Franz Josef I of Austria on 24 April 1854 until her assassination in 1898.

Elisabeth was born into the Ducal royal branch of the Bavarian House of Wittelsbach but enjoyed an informal upbringing before marrying her first cousin, Emperor Franz Joseph I, at 16. The marriage thrust her into the much more formal Habsburg court life, for which she was unprepared and which she found suffocating. Early in the marriage, she was at odds with her mother-in-law, who was also her maternal aunt, Archduchess Sophie, who took over the rearing of Elisabeth&#x27;s daughters, one of whom, Sophie, died in infancy. The birth of a son, Crown Prince Rudolf, improved Elisabeth&#x27;s standing at court, but her health suffered under the strain. As a result, she would often visit Hungary for its more relaxed environment. She came to develop a deep kinship with Hungary and helped to bring about the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary in 1867.

The death of Elisabeth&#x27;s only son and his mistress Mary Vetsera in a murder–suicide at his hunting lodge at Mayerling in 1889 was a blow from which the Empress never fully recovered. She withdrew from court duties and travelled widely, unaccompanied by her family. In 1890, she had the palace Achilleion built on the Greek island of Corfu. The palace featured an elaborate mythological motif and served as a refuge, which Elisabeth visited often. She was obsessively concerned with maintaining her youthful figure and beauty, developing a restrictive diet and wearing extremely tightlaced corsets to keep her waist looking very small.

While travelling in Geneva in 1898, Elisabeth was fatally stabbed in the heart by an Italian anarchist named Luigi Lucheni. Her tenure of 44 years was the longest of any Austrian empress.

==Duchess in Bavaria==

Elisabeth Amalie Eugenie was born on 24 December 1837 in the Herzog-Max-Palais in Munich, Bavaria. She was the third child and second daughter of Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria and Princess Ludovika of Bavaria, the half-sister of King Ludwig I of Bavaria. Maximilian was considered peculiar; he loved circuses and traveled the Bavarian countryside to escape his duties. The family&#x27;s homes were the Herzog-Max-Palais in Munich during winter and Possenhofen Castle in the summer months, far from the protocols of court. Sisi and her siblings grew up in an unrestrained, unstructured environment; she often skipped her lessons to go riding in the countryside.

In 1853, Archduchess Sophie, the domineering mother of 23-year-old Emperor Franz Joseph I, preferring a niece to a stranger for her daughter-in-law, arranged a meeting between her son and her sister Princess Ludovika&#x27;s eldest daughter, Duchess Helene (&quot;Néné&quot;). Although the couple had never met, Franz Joseph&#x27;s obedience was taken for granted by the Archduchess, who was once described as &quot;the only man in the Hofburg&quot; for her authoritarian manner.

Princess Ludovika and Duchess Helene were invited to journey to the resort of Bad Ischl, Upper Austria to receive his formal proposal of marriage. Ludovika also had the then-15-year-old Sisi accompany them, as Sisi had been mourning the recent death of the young Count she had loved, and had fallen into a lengthy depression. Ludovika hoped the change of scenery would cheer her up. Additionally, Archduke Karl Ludwig, Franz Joseph&#x27;s second younger brother, would also be joining the Imperial family. Karl Ludwig and Sisi had formed a close friendship in childhood, exchanging letters and gifts. Her mother hoped them seeing each other again would end with a possible engagement for Sisi.

The Duchesses traveled from Munich in several coaches, but arrived later than planned due to headache prone Ludovika enduring an episode. The Duchess had to interrupt their journey to allow her time to recover, causing the coaches to get separated and the one with their gala dresses never arrived. On their way to Bad Ischl, they visited Leopoldskron Palace where Theresa, the Queen Dowager of Bavaria was in mourning for her brother Georg, so they were dressed in black and unable to don more suitable clothing before meeting the young Emperor. While black did not suit 18-year-old Helene&#x27;s dark coloring, it made her younger sister&#x27;s fairer looks more striking.

Helene was a pious, quiet young woman, and while she and Franz Joseph felt ill at ease in each other&#x27;s company, he was instantly infatuated with her younger sister. He did not propose to Helene, but instead, he defied his mother and informed her that if he could not have Elisabeth, he would not marry at all. Five days later, their betrothal was officially announced. The couple were married eight months later in Vienna, at the Augustinerkirche, on 24 April 1854. The marriage was finally consummated three days later, and Elisabeth received a dower equal to US$240,000 as of 2015.

==Empress of Austria==

After enjoying an informal, unstructured childhood, Elisabeth, who was shy and introverted by nature, and more so among the stifling formality of Habsburg court life, had difficulty adapting to the Hofburg and its rigid protocols and strict etiquette. Within a few weeks, Elisabeth started to display health problems. She experienced fits of coughing and became anxious and frightened whenever she had to descend a narrow or steep staircase.

Early in her marriage she was surprised to learn that she was pregnant; she gave birth to her first child, daughter Sophie Friederike Dorothea Maria Josepha (1855–1857), just 10 months after her wedding. The elder Archduchess Sophie, who often referred to Elisabeth as &quot;a silly young mother&quot;, not only named the child after herself without consulting the mother, but she took complete charge of the baby, refusing to allow Elisabeth to breastfeed or otherwise care for her own child. When a second daughter, Gisela Louise Marie (1856–1932), was born a year later, the Archduchess took this baby away from Elisabeth as well.

The fact that she had not produced a male heir made Elisabeth increasingly unwanted in the palace. One day, she found a pamphlet on her desk with the following words underlined:

Her mother-in-law is generally considered to be the source of the malicious pamphlet although there is no evidence supporting that claim. The accusation of political meddling referred to Elisabeth&#x27;s influence on her husband regarding his Italian and Hungarian subjects. When she traveled to Italy with him, he granted amnesty to a number of political prisoners at her suggestion.

===First visit to Hungary===

In 1857, Elisabeth visited Hungary for the first time with her husband and two daughters, and it left a deep and lasting impression upon her, which many historians attribute to the fact that in Hungary, she found a welcome respite from the constraints of Austrian court life. It was &quot;the first time that Elisabeth had met with men of character in Franz Joseph&#x27;s realm, and she became acquainted with an aristocratic independence that scorned to hide its sentiments behind courtly forms of speech... She felt her innermost soul reach out in sympathy to the proud, steadfast people of this land...&quot;

Unlike Archduchess Sophie, who despised the Hungarians, Elisabeth felt such an affinity for them that she began to learn Hungarian. In turn, the country reciprocated in its adoration of her. Writing about his visit to Hungary in 1934, Patrick Leigh Fermor notes that Elisabeth&#x27;s picture was &quot;framed on desks and tables and grand pianos&quot;, and that her love for Hungary and the Hungarians &quot;was returned with interest and still declared, thirty-six years after her assassination, with all the ardour of Burke for Marie Antoinette.&quot;

This same trip proved tragic when both of Elisabeth&#x27;s daughters became ill. While Gisela recovered quickly, two-year-old Sophie grew steadily weaker before finally succumbing to her illness and dying. It is generally assumed today that she died of typhus. Her death pushed Elisabeth, who was already prone to bouts of melancholy, into periods of heavy depression, which would haunt her for the rest of her life. She turned away from her living daughter and began to neglect her. In December 1857, Elisabeth became pregnant for the third time, and her mother, who had been concerned about her daughter&#x27;s physical and mental health, hoped that this new pregnancy would help her recover.

===Birth of a son===

On 21 August 1858, Elisabeth finally gave birth to an heir, Rudolf Franz Karl Josef (1858–1889). The 101-gun salute announcing the news to Vienna also signaled an increase in her influence at court. This, combined with her sympathy toward Hungary, made Elisabeth an ideal mediator between the Hungarians and the Emperor. Her interest in politics had developed as she matured; she was liberal-minded, and placed herself decisively on the Hungarian side in the increasing conflict of nationalities within the empire.

Elisabeth was a personal advocate for the Hungarian Count Gyula Andrássy, who also was rumored to be her lover. Whenever difficult negotiations broke off between the Hungarians and the court, she assisted in resuming them. During these protracted dealings, she suggested to the emperor that Andrássy be made premier of Hungary as part of a compromise, and in a forceful attempt to bring the two men together, strongly admonished her husband:

When Elisabeth was still blocked from controlling her son&#x27;s upbringing and education, she openly rebelled.

Due to her nervous attacks, fasting cures, severe exercise regime, and frequent fits of coughing, the state of her health had become so alarming that in October 1860, she was reported to suffer not only from green-sickness, but also from physical exhaustion. A serious lung complaint of &quot;Lungenschwindsucht&quot; (tuberculosis) was feared by Joseph Škoda, a lung specialist, who advised a stay on Madeira. During this time, the court was rife with malicious rumors that Franz Joseph was having a liaison with an actress named Frau Roll.

Elisabeth seized on the excuse and left her husband and children, to spend the winter in seclusion. Six months later, a mere four days after her return to Vienna, she again experienced coughing fits and fever. She ate hardly anything and slept badly, and Škoda observed a recurrence of her lung disease. A fresh rest cure was advised, this time on Corfu, where she improved almost immediately. 
If her illnesses were mostly psychosomatic, abating when she was removed from her husband and her duties, her eating habits were definitely causing physical problems as well. In 1862, she had not seen Vienna for about a year when her family physician, Fischer of Munich, examined her and observed serious anemia and signs of dropsy. Her feet were sometimes so swollen that she could walk only laboriously, and with the support of others. On medical advice, she went to Bad Kissingen for a cure. Elisabeth recovered quickly at the spa, but instead of returning home to assuage the gossip about her absence, she spent more time with her own family in Bavaria. She returned in August 1862, shortly before her husband&#x27;s birthday, but immediately suffered from a violent migraine and vomited four times en route, which might support a theory that some of her complaints were stress-related and psychosomatic.

Rudolf was now four years old, and Franz Joseph hoped for another son to safeguard the succession. Fischer claimed that the health of the Empress would not permit another pregnancy, and she would need to visit Kissingen regularly for a cure. Elisabeth fell into her old pattern of escaping boredom and dull court protocol through frequent walking and riding, using her health as an excuse to avoid both official obligations and sexual intimacy. Preserving her youthful appearance was also an important influence in her avoidance of pregnancies: &quot;Children are the curse of a woman, for when they come, they drive away Beauty, which is the best gift of the gods.&quot;

She was now more assertive in her defiance of her husband and mother-in-law than before, openly opposing them on the subject of the military education of Rudolf, who, like his mother, was extremely sensitive and not suited to life at court.

===Hungarian coronation===

After having used every excuse to avoid pregnancy, Elisabeth later decided that she wanted a fourth child. Her decision was at once a deliberate personal choice and a political negotiation: by returning to the marriage, she ensured that Hungary, with which she felt an intense emotional alliance, would gain an equal footing with Austria.

The Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 created the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. Andrássy was made the first Hungarian prime minister and in return, he saw that Franz Joseph and Elisabeth were officially crowned King and Queen of Hungary in June.

As a coronation gift, Hungary presented the royal couple with a country residence in Gödöllő, east of Budapest. In the next year, Elisabeth lived primarily there, leaving her neglected and resentful Austrian subjects to trade rumors that if the infant she was expecting were a son, she would name him Stephen, after the patron saint and first king of Hungary. The issue was avoided when she gave birth to a daughter, Marie Valerie Mathilde Amalie (1868–1924). Dubbed the &quot;Hungarian child&quot;, she was born in Buda 10 months after her parents&#x27; coronation and baptised there in April. Determined to bring up this last child by herself, Elisabeth finally had her way. She poured all her repressed maternal feelings on her youngest daughter to the point of nearly smothering her. Sophie&#x27;s influence over Elisabeth&#x27;s children and the court faded, and she died in 1872.

===Marriage===

Franz Joseph was passionately in love with his wife, but they had a very complex relationship. He was a stolid and sober man, a political conservative who was still guided by his mother and her adherence to the strict Spanish Court ceremony regarding both his public and domestic life, whereas Elisabeth inhabited a different world altogether. Restless to the point of hyperactivity, naturally introverted, and emotionally distant from her husband as she got older, she fled him as well as her duties at the Vienna court, avoiding them both as much as possible; as a means of escape from her life and her misery, Elisabeth embarked on a life of endless travel and saw little of her children. Franz Joseph indulged her wanderings, but constantly and unsuccessfully tried to tempt her into a more domestic life with him. Their correspondence increased during their last years, however, and their relationship became a warm friendship.
The Empress slept very little and spent hours reading and writing at night, and even took up smoking, a shocking habit for women, which made her the further subject of already-avid gossip. She had a special interest in history, philosophy, and literature, and developed a profound reverence for the German lyric poet and radical political thinker Heinrich Heine, whose letters she collected.

She tried to make a name for herself by writing Heine-inspired poetry. Referring to herself as Titania, William Shakespeare&#x27;s Fairy Queen, Elisabeth expressed her intimate thoughts and desires in a large number of romantic poems, which served as a type of secret diary. Most of her poetry relates to her journeys, classical Greek and romantic themes, and ironic commentary on the Habsburg dynasty. Her wanderlust is defined by her own work:

Elisabeth was an emotionally complex woman, and perhaps due to the melancholy and eccentricity that was considered a given characteristic of her Wittelsbach lineage (the best-known member of the family being her favorite cousin, the eccentric Ludwig II of Bavaria), she was interested in the treatment of the mentally ill. In 1871, when the Emperor asked her what she would like as a gift for her Saint&#x27;s Day, she listed a young tiger and a medallion, but: &quot;...a fully equipped lunatic asylum would please me most&quot;.

===Mayerling incident===


In 1889, Elisabeth&#x27;s life was shattered by the death of her only son Rudolf, who was found dead together with his young lover Baroness Mary Vetsera, in what was suspected to be a murder–suicide on Rudolf&#x27;s part. The scandal was known as the &quot;Mayerling incident&quot; after the location of Rudolf&#x27;s hunting lodge in Lower Austria, where they were found.

Elisabeth never recovered from the tragedy, sinking further into melancholy. Within ten years, she had lost her father, Maximilian Joseph, in 1888; her only son Rudolf in 1889; her older sister Helene in 1890; her mother, Ludovika, in 1892; and her younger sister, Sophie Charlotte, during an accidental fire at the Bazar de la Charité in 1897. After Rudolf&#x27;s death she was thought to have dressed only in black for the rest of her life, although a light blue and cream dress discovered by The Hofburg&#x27;s Sisi Museum dates to this time. To compound her losses, Count Gyula Andrássy died on 18 February 1890. &quot;My last and only friend is dead,&quot; she lamented. Elisabeth&#x27;s youngest daughter Marie Valerie declared, &quot;...she clung to him with true and steadfast friendship as she did perhaps, to no other person.&quot;

The Mayerling incident increased public interest in Elisabeth, and she continued to be an icon and a sensation in her own right wherever she went. She carried a white parasol made of leather in addition to a concealing fan to hide her face from the curious.

===Physical regimen===
At , Elisabeth was unusually tall for her time. Through fasting and exercise such as gymnastics and riding, she maintained her weight at approximately 50 kg (110 pounds) for most of her life.

In deep mourning after her daughter Sophie&#x27;s death, Elisabeth refused to eat for daysa behavior that would reappear in later periods of melancholy and depression. Whereas she previously had supper with the family, she now began to avoid this; and if she did eat with them, she ate quickly and very little. Whenever her weight threatened to exceed 50 kilos, a &quot;fasting cure&quot; or &quot;hunger cure&quot; would follow, which involved almost complete fasting. Meat itself often filled her with disgust, so she either had the juice of half-raw beefsteaks squeezed into a thin soup, or else adhered to a diet of milk and eggs.

Elisabeth emphasised her extreme slenderness through the practice of tightlacing. During the peak period of 1859–60, which coincided with Franz-Joseph&#x27;s political and military defeats in Italy, her sexual withdrawal from her husband after three pregnancies in rapid succession, and her losing battle with her mother-in-law for dominance in rearing her children, she reduced her waist to 40 cm (16 inches) in circumference.

Corsets of the time were split-busk types, fastening up the front with hooks and eyes, but Elisabeth had more rigid, solid-front ones made in Paris out of leather, &quot;like those of Parisian courtesans&quot;, probably to hold up under the stress of such strenuous lacing, &quot;a proceeding which sometimes took quite an hour&quot;. The fact that &quot;she only wore them for a few weeks&quot; may indicate that even leather proved inadequate for her needs. Elisabeth&#x27;s defiant flaunting of this exaggerated dimension angered her mother-in-law.
Although on her return to Vienna in August 1862, a lady-in-waiting reported that &quot;she eats properly, sleeps well, and does not tight-lace anymore&quot;, her clothing from this time until her death still measured only 47–49.5 cm (18 ½–19 ½ inches) around the waist, which prompted the Prince of Hesse to describe her as &quot;almost inhumanly slender&quot;. She developed a horror of fat women and transmitted this attitude to her youngest daughter, who was terrified when, as a little girl, she first met Queen Victoria.

In her youth, Elisabeth followed the fashions of the age, which for many years were cage-crinolined hoop skirts, but when fashion began to change, she was at the forefront of abandoning the hoop skirt for a tighter and leaner silhouette. She disliked both expensive accoutrements and the protocol that dictated constant changes of clothing, preferring simple, monochromatic riding habit-like attire. She never wore petticoats or any other &quot;underlinen&quot;, as they added bulk, and was often literally sewn into her clothes, to bypass waistbands, creases, and wrinkles and to further emphasize the wasp waist that became her hallmark.

The empress developed extremely rigorous and disciplined exercise habits. Every castle she lived in was equipped with a gymnasium; the Knights&#x27; Hall of the Hofburg was converted into one, mats and balance beams were installed in her bedchamber so that she could practise on them each morning, and the Imperial Villa at Bad Ischl was fitted with gigantic mirrors so that she could correct every movement and position. She took up fencing in her 50s with equal discipline. She rode every day for hours on end, becoming a skilled horsewoman, possibly the best-known of her time. When, due to sciatica, she could no longer endure long hours in the saddle, she substituted with walking, subjecting her attendants to interminable marches and hiking tours in all weather.

In the last years of her life, Elisabeth became even more restless and obsessive, weighing herself up to three times a day. She regularly took steam baths to prevent weight gain; by 1894, she had wasted away to near emaciation, reaching her lowest point of 43.5 kg (95.7 lbs). There were some aberrations in Elisabeth&#x27;s diet that appear to be signs of binge eating. On one occasion in 1878, the Empress astonished her travelling companions when she unexpectedly visited a restaurant incognito, where she drank champagne, ate a broiled chicken and an Italian salad, and finished with a &quot;considerable quantity of cake&quot;. She may have satisfied her urge to binge in secret on other occasions; in 1881, she purchased an English country house and had a spiral staircase built from her sitting room into the kitchen, so that she could reach it in private.

It has been suggested by historians that these habits indicate a restrictive eating disorder. Walter Vandereycken, a professor of psychology, has stated that: &quot;numerous documents repeatedly describe her considerable fear of weight gain and the psychopathological changes specific for anorexia nervosa.&quot;

===Beauty===

She is known as one of the most beautiful and famous women of 19th century Europe. In addition to her rigorous exercise regimen, Elisabeth practiced demanding beauty routines. Daily care of her abundant and extremely long hair, which in time turned from the dark blonde of her youth to chestnut brunette, took at least three hours. Her hair was so long and heavy that she often complained that the weight of the elaborate double braids and pins gave her headaches.

Her hairdresser, Franziska Feifalik, was originally a stage hairdresser at the Wiener Burgtheater. Responsible for all of Elisabeth&#x27;s ornate hairstyles, she generally accompanied her on her wanderings. Feifalik was forbidden to wear rings and required to wear white gloves; after hours of dressing, braiding, and pinning up the Empress&#x27; tresses, the hairs that fell out had to be presented in a silver bowl to the reproachful Empress for inspection. When her hair was washed with a combination of eggs and cognac once every two weeks, all activities and obligations were cancelled for that day. Before her son&#x27;s death, she tasked Feifalik with tweezing gray hairs away, but at the end of her life her hair was described as &quot;abundant, though streaked with silver threads&quot;.

Elisabeth used these captive hours during grooming to learn languages; she spoke fluent English and French, and added modern Greek to her Hungarian studies. Her Greek tutor, Constantine Christomanos, described the ritual:

Elisabeth used cosmetics and perfume sparingly, as she wished to showcase her natural beauty. On the other hand, to preserve her beauty, she tested countless beauty products prepared either in the court pharmacy or by a lady-in-waiting in her own apartments. She appeared to favor &quot;Crème Céleste&quot; (compounded from white wax, spermaceti, sweet almond oil, and rose water), but also used a wide variety of other facial tonics and waters.

Her night and bedtime rituals were just as demanding. Elisabeth slept without a pillow on a metal bedstead, which she believed was better for retaining and maintaining her upright posture; either raw veal or crushed strawberries lined her nightly leather facial mask. She was also heavily massaged, and often slept with cloths soaked in either violet- or cider-vinegar above her hips to preserve her slim waist; her neck was wrapped with cloths soaked in Kummerfeld-toned washing water. To further preserve her skin tone, she took both a cold shower every morning (which in later years aggravated her arthritis) and an olive-oil bath in the evening.

Elisabeth had an aversion to being photographed, especially later in her life, and was quick with a fan or sunshade to prevent her portrait being taken.

===Travels===

On her imperial steamer, &quot;Miramar&quot;, Empress Elisabeth travelled through the Mediterranean. Her favourite places were Cape Martin on the French Riviera, and also Sanremo on the Ligurian Riviera, where tourism had started only in the second half of the nineteenth century; Lake Geneva in Switzerland; Bad Ischl in Upper Austria, where the imperial couple would spend the summer; and Corfu. The Empress also visited countries not usually visited by European royals at the time: Morocco, Algeria, Malta, Turkey, and Egypt. About her travels, she commented: &quot;If I arrived at a place and knew that I could never leave it again, the whole stay would become hell despite being paradise&quot;.

After her son&#x27;s death, she commissioned a palace on the Island of Corfu which she named &quot;Achilleion&quot; after Homer&#x27;s hero Achilles in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. Emperor Franz Joseph was hoping that his wife would finally settle down at the Achilleion, but she soon lost interest in the fairytale property. The building was purchased by German Emperor Wilhelm II after her death. It was later acquired by the nation of Greece (now the Greek National Tourism Organization) and converted to a museum.

Newspapers published articles on her passion for riding sports, diet and exercise regimens, and fashion sense. She often shopped at the Budapest fashion house, &quot;Antal Alter&quot; (now Alter és Kiss), which had become very popular with the fashion-crazed crowd. Newspapers also reported on a series of reputed lovers. Although there is no verifiable evidence of her having an affair, one of her alleged lovers was George &quot;Bay&quot; Middleton, a dashing Anglo-Scot. He had been named as the probable lover of Lady Henrietta Blanche Hozier and father of Clementine Ogilvy Hozier (the wife of Winston Churchill). Elisabeth encouraged her husband Franz Joseph&#x27;s close relationship with actress Katharina Schratt to assuage his loneliness during her long absences.

On her journeys, Elisabeth sought to avoid all public attention and crowds of people. She was mostly travelling incognito, using pseudonyms like &quot;Countess of Hohenembs&quot;. She also refused to meet European monarchs when she did not feel like it. On her high-speed walking tours, which lasted several hours, she was mostly accompanied by her Greek language tutors or her ladies-in-waiting. Countess Irma Sztáray, her last lady-in-waiting, describes the reclusive and highly sensitive Empress as a natural, liberal and modest character, as a good listener and keen observer with great intellect.

While in Greece during her travels at the age of 51 (1888), Elisabeth got a tattoo of an anchor on her shoulder to reflect her love of the sea.

Almost all of the 10 companions who traveled with Elisabeth during her various journeys were in their mid-twenties and of Greek origin. The most famous one was Constantin Christomanos, a future playwright and theater director, whose memoirs of Elisabeth were banned by the Viennese court. The others were the lawyer Nikos Thermoyanis, Roussos Roussopoulos, who thanks to Elisabeth became an honorary consul in Budapest, Constantin Manos, who became a resistance fighter against the Turks in Crete, and Marinos Marinaky, a future sportsman and co-founder of the famous Greek football club Panathinaikos. The last tutor who accompanied the Empress was the English-Greek Frederic Barker. He also served as a middleman for negotiations to sell the Achilleion. After Elisabeth&#x27;s death, Barker continued to stay in touch with the imperial family and became a freemason. On her voyages, Empress Elisabeth was also attended by a Swedish therapist, Arvid Ludvig Kellgren, to whom she even wrote romantic poetry.

==Assassination==

In 1898, despite warnings of possible assassination attempts, the 60-year-old Elisabeth traveled incognito to Geneva, Switzerland. However, someone from the Hôtel Beau-Rivage revealed that the Empress of Austria was their guest.

At 1:35 p.m. on Saturday 10 September 1898, Elisabeth and Countess Irma Sztáray, her lady-in-waiting, left the hotel on the shore of Lake Geneva on foot to catch the steamship &quot;Genève&quot; for Montreux. Since the Empress despised processions, she insisted that they walk without the other members of her entourage.

They were walking along the promenade when the 25-year-old Italian anarchist Luigi Lucheni approached them, attempting to peer underneath the empress&#x27;s parasol. According to Sztáray, as the ship&#x27;s bell announced the departure, Lucheni seemed to stumble and made a movement with his hand, as if he wanted to maintain his balance. In reality, in an act of &quot;propaganda of the deed&quot;, he had stabbed Elisabeth with a sharpened needle file that was long (used to file the eyes of industrial needles) that he had inserted into a wooden handle.

Lucheni originally planned to kill the Duke of Orléans, but the pretender to France&#x27;s throne had left Geneva earlier for the Valais. Failing to find him, the assassin selected Elisabeth when a Geneva newspaper revealed that the elegant woman traveling under the pseudonym of &quot;Countess of Hohenembs&quot; was the Empress of Austria.

After Lucheni struck her, Elisabeth collapsed. A coach driver helped her to her feet and alerted the Austrian concierge of the Beau-Rivage, a man named Planner, who had been watching the progress the Empress made toward the &quot;Genève&quot;. The two women walked roughly to the gangway and boarded, at which point, Sztáray relaxed her hold on Elisabeth&#x27;s arm. The Empress then lost consciousness and collapsed next to her. Sztáray called for a doctor, but only a former nurse, a fellow passenger, was available. The boat&#x27;s captain, Captain Roux, was ignorant of Elisabeth&#x27;s identity, and since it was very hot on deck, he advised the Countess to disembark and take her companion back to her hotel. The boat was already sailing out of the harbor. Three men carried the Empress to the top deck and laid her on a bench. Sztáray opened her dress and cut Elisabeth&#x27;s corset laces so she could breathe. Elisabeth revived somewhat and when Sztáray asked her if she was in pain, she replied, &quot;No&quot;. She then asked, &quot;What has happened?&quot; and lost consciousness again.

Countess Sztáray noticed a small brown stain above the left breast of the Empress. Alarmed that Elisabeth had not recovered consciousness, she informed the captain of her identity, and the boat turned back to Geneva. Elisabeth was carried back to the Hôtel Beau-Rivage by six sailors on a stretcher improvised from a sail, cushions and two oars. Fanny Mayer, the wife of the hotel&#x27;s director, a visiting nurse, and the Countess undressed Elisabeth and removed her shoes, at which point Sztáray noticed a few small drops of blood and a small wound. When they then removed her from the stretcher to the bed, she was clearly dead. Frau Mayer believed the two audible breaths she heard the Empress take as she was brought into the room were her last. Two doctors, Dr. Golay and Dr. Mayer arrived, along with a priest, who was too late to grant her absolution. Mayer incised the artery of her left arm to ascertain death and found no blood. She was pronounced dead at 2:10 p.m. Everyone knelt down and prayed for the repose of her soul, and Countess Sztáray closed Elisabeth&#x27;s eyes and joined her hands.

Elisabeth had been the Empress of Austria for 44 years.
When Franz Joseph received the telegram informing him of Elisabeth&#x27;s death, his first fear was that her death was caused by suicide. It was only when a later message arrived, detailing the assassination, that he was reassured on that point. The telegram asked permission to perform an autopsy, and the response was that whatever procedures were prescribed should be adhered to.

The autopsy was performed the next day by Golay, who discovered that the weapon, which had not yet been found, had penetrated into Elisabeth&#x27;s thorax, fractured the fourth rib, pierced the lung and pericardium, and penetrated the heart from the top before coming out the base of the left ventricle. Because of the sharpness and thinness of the file, the wound was very narrow and, due to pressure from Elisabeth&#x27;s extremely tight corseting, the hemorrhage of blood into the pericardial sac around the heart was slowed to mere drops. Until this sac filled (a medical emergency known as cardiac tamponade), the beating of her heart was not impeded, which is why the Empress had been able to walk from the site of the assault and up the boat&#x27;s boarding ramp. Had the weapon not been removed, she would have lived a while longer, as it would have acted like a plug to stop the bleeding.

Golay photographed the wound but turned the photograph over to the Swiss Procurator-General, who had it destroyed, on the orders of Franz Joseph, along with the autopsy instruments.

As Geneva shuttered itself in mourning, Elisabeth&#x27;s body was placed in a triple coffin: two inner ones of lead, the third exterior one in bronze, reposing on lion claws. On Tuesday, before the coffins were sealed, Franz Joseph&#x27;s official representatives arrived to identify the body. The coffin was fitted with two glass panels, covered with doors, which could be slid back to allow her face to be seen.

On Wednesday morning, the body was carried back to Vienna aboard a funeral train. The inscription on her coffin read, &quot;Elisabeth, Empress of Austria&quot;. The Hungarians were outraged, and the words, &quot;and Queen of Hungary&quot; were hastily added. The entire empire was in deep mourning; eighty-two sovereigns and high-ranking nobles followed her funeral cortege on the morning of 17 September to the Imperial Crypt at the Capuchin Church.

===Aftermath===

After the attack, Lucheni fled down the Rue des Alpes, where he threw the file into the entrance to No. 3. He was caught by two cabdrivers and a sailor, then secured by a gendarme. The weapon was found the next day by the concierge during his morning cleaning; he thought it belonged to a laborer who had moved the day before and did not notify the police of his discovery until the following day. There was no blood on the file and the tip was broken off, which occurred when Lucheni threw it away. The file was so dull in appearance it was speculated that it had been deliberately selected because it would be less noticeable than a shiny knife, which would have given Lucheni away as he approached. Lucheni had planned to purchase a stiletto, but lacking the price of 12 francs he had simply sharpened an old file into a homemade dagger and cut down a piece of firewood into a handle.

Although Lucheni boasted that he acted alone, because many political refugees found a haven in Switzerland, the possibility that he was part of a plot and that the life of the Emperor was also in danger was considered. Once it was discovered that an Italian was responsible for Elisabeth&#x27;s murder, unrest swept Vienna and reprisals were threatened against Italians. The intensity of shock, mourning, and outrage far exceeded that which occurred at the news of Rudolf&#x27;s death.

An outcry also immediately erupted over the lack of protection for the Empress. The Swiss police had been well aware of her presence, and telegrams to the appropriate authorities advising them to take all precautions had been dispatched. Police Chief Virieux of the Canton of Vaud had organized Elisabeth&#x27;s protection, but she had detected his officers outside the hotel the day before the assassination and protested that the surveillance was disagreeable, so Virieux had no choice but to withdraw them. It is also possible that if Elisabeth had not dismissed her other attendants that day, an entourage larger than one lady-in-waiting could have discouraged Lucheni, who had been following the Empress for several days, awaiting an opportunity.

Lucheni was brought before the Geneva Court in October. Furious that the death sentence had been abolished there, he demanded that he be tried according to the laws of the Canton of Lucerne, which still had the death penalty, signing the letter: &quot;Luigi Lucheni, anarchist, and one of the most dangerous&quot;. Since Elisabeth was famous for preferring the common man to courtiers, known for her charitable works, and considered such a blameless target, Lucheni&#x27;s sanity was questioned initially. He was declared to be sane, but was tried as a common murderer, not a political criminal. Incarcerated for life, and denied the opportunity to make a political statement by his action, he attempted to kill himself with the sharpened key from a tin of sardines on 20 February 1900. Ten years later, he hanged himself with his belt in his cell on the evening of 16 October 1910, after a guard confiscated his uncompleted memoirs.

Franz Joseph remarked to Prince Liechtenstein, who was the couple&#x27;s devoted equerry, &quot;That a man could be found to attack such a woman, whose whole life was spent in doing good and who never injured any person, is to me &quot;.

Elisabeth&#x27;s will stipulated that a large part of her jewel collection should be sold and the proceeds (then estimated at over £600,000), were to be applied to various religious and charitable organizations. Everything else that the Empress had the power to bequeath, outside of the crown jewels and state property, was left to her granddaughter, Archduchess Elisabeth, Rudolf&#x27;s only child.

Internationally the assassination resulted in the International Conference of Rome for the Social Defense Against Anarchists, the first international conference against terrorism.

==Legacy==
Upon her death, Franz Joseph founded the Order of Elizabeth in memory of her.

On the promenade in Territet, Switzerland, there is a monument to the Empress created by Antonio Chiattone in 1902. This town is between Montreux and Château de Chillon; the inscription mentions her many visits to the area. In the Volksgarten of Vienna, there is an elaborate memorial monument featuring a seated statue of the Empress by Hans Bitterlich, dedicated on 4 June 1907.

There are several statues of Empress Elisabeth in Slovakia: a bronze statue by Gyula Donáth from 1903 at the Bardejov spa in Bardejov and busts in Poltár and in Prešov. Other statues in her memory were erected in Salzburg, in the garden of the former Hotel Strauch in Feldafing (where she used to stay on her later travels), in Budapest, in Funchal. Near the location of her assassination at Quai du Mont-Blanc on the shore of Lake Geneva, there is a statue &quot;in memoriam&quot;, created by Philip Jackson and dedicated in 1998 on the 100th anniversary of the assassination.
A large number of chapels were named in her honour, connecting her to Saint Elisabeth. The Elizabeth Church in Lviv, Ukraine (now the Greek Catholic Church of Sts. Olha and Elizabeth), was founded in 1903 by Emperor Franz Joseph in memory of Elisabeth. Various parks were named after her, such as the Empress Elisabeth Park in Merano, South Tyrol.

Various residences that Elisabeth frequented are preserved and open to the public, including her Hofburg apartment and the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna, the Hermesvilla in the Vienna Woods, the Imperial Villa in Bad Ischl, the Achilleion on the Island of Corfu, and the Royal Palace of Gödöllő in Hungary. Her childhood family summer residence, Possenhofen Castle, houses the Empress Elizabeth Museum.

Several sites in Hungary are named after her, such as two of Budapest&#x27;s districts, Erzsébetváros and Pesterzsébet. The Elisabeth Bridge over the Danube and connecting Buda with Pest, first constructed in 1903, was named after her. The Elisabeth Bridge connecting the towns Komárno in Slovakia and Komárom in Hungary (which used to be one town at the time when it was built in 1892), is named after the Empress. The Empress Elisabeth Bridge over the Elbe, opened in 1855, was named after her.

In the village Gastouri, on the Greek island of Corfu, a fountain is named after Elisabeth. The Empress had donated the &quot;Fountain under the Sycamores&quot; for the locals. It was festively inaugurated in 1894 by the church dignitaries and later named &quot;Elisabeth Fountain&quot;.

The Empress&#x27;s specially built railway sleeping car is on display at the Technical Museum in Vienna. Empress Elisabeth and the Empress Elisabeth Railway (Western Railway) named after her were recently selected as a main motif for a high value collector coin, the Empress Elisabeth Western Railway commemorative coin.

In 1998, Gerald Blanchard stole the Köechert Diamond Pearl known as the Sisi Star, a 10-pointed star of diamonds fanning out around one enormous pearl from an exhibit at the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna commemorating the 100th anniversary of her assassination. It was one of approximately 27 jewel-encrusted pieces designed and made by court jeweler Jakob Heinrich Köchert for her to wear in her hair, which appears in a portrait of her by Franz Xaver Winterhalter. Two versions of the stars were created: a second type without a pearl center, was designed by court jeweller Rozet &amp; Fischmeister; some stars were given to ladies of the court. One set of 27 diamond stars was kept in the Imperial family and it is seen in a photograph that shows the dowry of Rudolf&#x27;s daughter, Archduchess Elisabeth, known as &quot;Erzsi&quot;, on the occasion of her wedding to Prince Otto of Windisch-Graetz in 1902. The Star was recovered by Canadian police in 2007 and eventually returned to Austria. Although Blanchard possessed the priceless jewel, no one was ever formally charged with stealing it.

==Portrayal of Elisabeth in the arts==
===Stage===
In 1932 the comic operetta &quot;Sissi&quot; premiered in Vienna. Composed by Fritz Kreisler, the libretto was written by Ernst and Hubert Marischka, with orchestrations by Robert Russell Bennett. Although the pet name of the empress was always spelled &quot;Sisi&quot;, never &quot;Sissi&quot;, this incorrect version of her name persisted in the works about her that followed. In 1943 Jean Cocteau wrote a play about an imagined meeting between Elisabeth and her assassin, &quot;L&#x27;Aigle à deux têtes&quot; (&quot;The Double-headed Eagle&quot;). It was first staged in 1946.

In 1992, the musical &quot;Elisabeth&quot; premièred at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna. With libretto by Michael Kunze and music by Sylvester Levay, this is probably the darkest portrayal of the Empress&#x27; life. It portrayed Elisabeth bringing a physical manifestation of death with her to the imperial court, thus destroying the Habsburg dynasty. The leading role in the premiere was originated by Dutch musical singer Pia Douwes. &quot;Elisabeth&quot; went on to become the most successful German-language musical of all time and has enjoyed numerous productions around the world, but has not been adapted for an English-speaking audience as of 2024.

===Ballet===
In his 1978 ballet &quot;Mayerling&quot;, Kenneth MacMillan portrayed Elisabeth in a &quot;pas de deux&quot; with her son Prince Rudolf, the principal character in the ballet. In 1993 French ballerina Sylvie Guillem appeared in a piece entitled, &quot;Sissi, l&#x27;impératice anarchiste&quot; (Sissi, Anarchist Empress), choreographed by Maurice Béjart to Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Emperor Waltz&quot;.

===Film===
The 1921 film &quot;Kaiserin Elisabeth von Österreich&quot; was one of the first films to focus entirely on Elisabeth. It was co-written by Elisabeth&#x27;s niece, Marie Larisch (who played her younger self at the age of 62), and starred Carla Nelsen as the title character. The film later achieved notoriety when a group of con-artists started selling stills from the murder scene as actual photographs of the crime. Adolf Trotz directed the 1931 German film &quot;Elisabeth of Austria&quot;.

In 1936, Columbia Pictures released &quot;The King Steps Out&quot;, a film version of the operetta &quot;Sissi&quot;, directed by Josef von Sternberg. It starred opera diva Grace Moore and Franchot Tone. Jean Cocteau directed the 1948 film version of his play &quot;The Eagle with Two Heads&quot;. Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;The Mystery of Oberwald&quot; is another adaptation of Cocteau&#x27;s play.

In the German and Italian-speaking world, Elisabeth&#x27;s name is often associated with a trilogy of romantic films about her life directed by Ernst Marischka which starred a teenage Romy Schneider and made her famous worldwide:
* &quot;Sissi&quot; (1955)
* &quot;Sissi – Die Junge Kaiserin&quot; (1956) (&quot;Sissi – The Young Empress&quot;)
* &quot;Sissi – Schicksalsjahre Einer Kaiserin&quot; (1957) (&quot;Sissi – Fateful Years of an Empress&quot;)
* &quot;Forever My Love&quot; is a condensed version, with the three films edited down into one feature and dubbed in English. This version was released in North America in 1962.

In early dramatizations, Elisabeth appears as peripheral to her husband and son, and so is always shown as a mature character. Schneider&#x27;s characterization of Elisabeth as a young woman is the first time the &quot;young&quot; Empress is seen on screen. The trilogy was the first to explicitly depict the romantic myth of Sissi, and ends abruptly with her determination to live a private life. Any further exploration of the topic would have been at odds with the accepted image of the loving wife, devoted mother, and benevolent empress. The three films, newly restored, are shown every Christmas on Austrian, German, Dutch, and French television. In 2007, the films were released as &quot;The Sissi Collection&quot; with English subtitles. Schneider came to loathe the role, claiming, &quot;Sissi sticks to me like porridge ().&quot; Later she appeared as a much more realistic and fascinating Elisabeth in Luchino Visconti&#x27;s &quot;Ludwig,&quot; a 1972 film about Elisabeth&#x27;s cousin, Ludwig II of Bavaria. A portrait of Schneider in this film was the only one, taken from her roles, which is displayed in her home.

Ava Gardner played Empress Elisabeth in the 1968 film &quot;Mayerling&quot;, in which Omar Sharif starred as Crown Prince Rudolf. A 1991 French-German film called &quot;&quot; ( &quot;Sisi und der Kaiserkuss&quot;) starred French actress Vanessa Wagner as Elisabeth, Nils Tavernier as Franz Joseph and Sonja Kirchberger as Helene.

An indirect reference to Elisabeth is made in the 2004 film &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;. The heroine Christine (portrayed by Emmy Rossum) wears an elaborate white/silver ball gown in her first leading role, with diamond stars in her long, dark hair. The ensemble is modeled after Elisabeth&#x27;s attire and hairstyle in the iconic Winterhalter portrait. In 2007, German comedian and director Michael Herbig released an animated parody film based on Elisabeth under the title &quot;Lissi und der wilde Kaiser.&quot; It is based on his Sissi parody sketches featured in his television show &quot;Bullyparade.&quot; In &quot;Bullyparade – Der Film&quot; (2017), Elisabeth is played by Herbig himself.

A recent appearance of Sisi was in the new 2012 biopic about Ludwig II of Bavaria titled &quot;Ludwig II&quot;, where she was played by Hannah Herzsprung. In 2014, to coincide with the presentation of the Pre-Fall 2015 &quot;Metier d&#x27;arts&quot; collection by luxury fashion house Chanel, shown in Leopoldskron Palace, creative director Karl Lagerfeld directed a short film featuring Cara Delevingne as Empress Elisabeth accompanied by Pharrell Williams. During a dream sequence, the duo sing a song written by Williams entitled &quot;CC the World&quot;, playing on the iconic interlocking logo of the fashion house, the initials of its founder Coco Chanel, as well as the Empress&#x27;s nickname &quot;Sisi&quot;. Lagerfeld recreated the iconic gown worn by Elisabeth in the portrait by Winterhalter, whilst Pharrell takes on attire similar to Franz Joseph.

The 2022 film &quot;Corsage&quot; directed by Marie Kreutzer focuses on Empress Elisabeth&#x27;s life following her 40th birthday celebrations. The film premiered at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival within the Un Certain Regard section and actress Vicky Krieps, who played the Empress, was awarded &quot;ex aequo&quot; the Best Performance Prize. The 2023 Austrian-German-Swiss film &quot;Sisi &amp; I&quot; directed by Frauke Finsterwalder and starring Sandra Hüller, Susanne Wolff, Tom Rhys Harries and Angela Winkler, tells the story of Empress Elisabeth from the point of view of her lady-in-waiting, Irma Sztáray, with Wolff playing the role of Empress Elisabeth and Hüller in the role of Sztáray. The film was released in Germany on 16 March 2023.

===Television===
Elisabeth was portrayed in episode 1 of the 1974 British television series &quot;Fall of Eagles&quot;. Diane Keen played the young Elisabeth and Rachel Gurney portrayed the Empress at the time of Rudolf&#x27;s death.

The 1992 BBC adaptation of Agatha Christie&#x27;s Miss Marple mystery &quot;The Mirror Crack&#x27;d from Side to Side&quot; centers around the shooting of a fictitious film about Elisabeth. The role of the actress portraying the Empress was played by Claire Bloom. The season five finale of the Austrian detective television series &quot;Kommissar Rex&quot; (1994) revolves around a deluded woman affected by the myth of the Empress. The episode, appropriately, is entitled, &quot;Sisi.&quot; A heavily fictionalized version of Elisabeth&#x27;s younger years is portrayed in a 1997 animated children&#x27;s series, &quot;Princess Sissi.&quot;

Arielle Dombasle portrayed Elisabeth in the 2004 French television film &quot;Sissi, l&#x27;impératrice rebelle&quot;, detailing the last five days of her life. Sandra Ceccarelli portrayed an older Elisabeth in the 2006 television dramatization of the Mayerling incident, &quot;The Crown Prince&quot;. Her son and his lover were played by Max von Thun and Vittoria Puccini. In 2009, &quot;Sisi&quot;, a two-part mini-series, premiered on European television, produced by a German, Austrian and Italian partnership, starring Cristiana Capotondi as Elisabeth and David Rott as Franz Joseph. Like the 1997 animated series and the films starring Romy Schneider, this film portrays the romantic mythology surrounding the unhappy marriage of Elisabeth and Franz Joseph, but focuses more on the political problems of the empire and the personal troubles of the main characters.

In 2015 an Italian cartoon series began broadcasting on Mondo TV. In 2018 after airing two seasons totalling 56 episodes (26 minutes each, with 52 shorter 11–minute episodes slated for its 3D third season) it sold its second season to Jeem TV, after already having ported it to TV Azteca in 2017. In 2021 a German miniseries &quot;,&quot; aired on RTL+; Elisabeth was portrayed by Dominique Devenport. As of 2023, it is available in the United States on the streaming platform PBS Passport as &quot;Sisi: Austrian Empress&quot;. In the 2022 Netflix miniseries &quot;The Empress&quot;, centering on Sisi&#x27;s life, she is played by Turkish-German actress Devrim Lingnau.

===Literature===
 (1867–1911), who served as Elisabeth&#x27;s modern Greek language tutor from 1891 to 1893 and escorted her during her stay in Corfu, published his memoirs of her shortly after her death, in his 1899 &quot;Tagebuchblätter&quot; (Diary Pages). Although he portrayed Elisabeth in an idealistic favourable manner, as a fairytale princess come to life, his book greatly displeased the Imperial Court that declared him &quot;persona non grata&quot; and forced him to resign his university teaching position in Vienna and leave Austria. Mark Twain, who lived in Austria at the time of the Empress&#x27;s death, wrote about her assassination in the article &quot;The Memorable Assassination&quot;, which he did not submit for publication.

&quot;Golden Fleece&quot; is a biography of Elisabeth by Bertita Harding (Bobbs-Merrill, 1937); one of five biographies by Harding about members of the Habsburg dynasty. In 1988, historian Brigitte Hamann revived interest in Elisabeth with her book, &quot;The Reluctant Empress: A Biography of Empress Elisabeth of Austria&quot;. Unlike previous portrayals of Elisabeth as a one-dimensional fairytale princess, Hamann portrayed her as a bitter, unhappy woman full of self-loathing and suffering from various emotional and mental disorders. She was seen to have searched for happiness, but died a broken woman who never found it. Hamann&#x27;s portrayal explored new facets of the legend of Sisi, as well as contemplating the role of women in high-level politics and dynasties. 

Drawing on Christomanos&#x27;s diaries and so far unpublished sources from Greece&#x27;s national archives, Austrian anthropologist and journalist Stefan Haderer published his book &quot;Under the Spell of a Myth: Empress Sisi in Greece&quot; in 2022. His book is both an accurate historical account of Elisabeth&#x27;s travels to Greece and a very personal portrait of her character and her special relationship with the Greek people. In 2015, journalist Jennifer Bowers Bahney wrote the non-fiction narrative of the theft of the Koechert diamond and pearl jewel titled &quot;Stealing Sisi&#x27;s Star: How a Master Thief Nearly Got Away with Austria&#x27;s Most Famous Jewel&quot;.

The Empress haunts a deadly Christmas house party in the form of a chatty biography, &quot;Life of the Empress Elizabeth of Austria&quot;, in Georgette Heyer&#x27;s 1941 mystery, &quot;Envious Casca.&quot; The book and its disappearance form part of the goings-on that drive the various family members and guests to distraction. Elisabeth&#x27;s youth and early adult life are dramatized in the novel &quot;Imperial Waltz&quot; by William S. Abrahams (Dial Press, 1954). She features in Alexander Lernet-Holenia&#x27;s 1960 novel &quot;Mayerling&quot;. The empress appears in the 1976 romantic fiction novel &quot;Stars in my Heart&quot; by Barbara Cartland.

Elisabeth appears as a significant character in Gary Jennings&#x27; 1987 novel &quot;Spangle&quot;. The novel concerns a circus traveling through Europe at the close of the 19th century, and portrays Elisabeth&#x27;s interest in circuses and daredevil horseback riding. She appears in a cameo in the short story &quot;The Road to Charing Cross&quot; in the 1999 book &quot;Flashman and the Tiger&quot; by George MacDonald Fraser. She dances with the anti-hero, Harry Flashman at a ball at the end of the story, in which Flashman has helped prevent her husband the Emperor from being assassinated. Elisabeth&#x27;s story inspired the 2003 children&#x27;s book &quot;The Royal Diaries: Elisabeth, The Princess Bride&quot; set during her teenage years in 1853 and 1854.

Elisabeth and her purported lover, George &quot;Bay&quot; Middleton are included in the 2014 historical fiction novel, &quot;The Fortune Hunter&quot; by Daisy Goodwin. Author Allison Pataki wrote an historical novel about Elisabeth and her marriage to Emperor Franz Joseph entitled &quot;The Accidental Empress&quot; in 2015. Its sequel, &quot;Sisi, Empress on Her Own&quot;, was published in 2016. The story of Elisabeth is told in Susan Appleyard&#x27;s 2016 ebook, &quot;In a Gilded Cage&quot;. A companion novel to the six-episode Netflix series &quot;The Empress&quot;, also titled &quot;The Empress&quot;, and written by Gigi Griffis, was published in 2022.

===Music===
Dutch singer Petra Berger&#x27;s album &quot;Eternal Woman&quot; includes &quot;If I Had a Wish&quot;, a song about Elisabeth. The song &quot;SiSi&quot; by the Scottish band Washington Irving is inspired by Elisabeth&#x27;s life.

<doc id="153035" wikidata="Q857613" url="?curid=153035" title="Lhoba people">
<text>Lhoba (English translation: ; ; ) is any of a diverse amalgamation of Sino-Tibetan-speaking tribespeople living in and around Pemako, a region in southeastern Tibet including Mainling, Medog and Zayü counties of Nyingchi and Lhünzê County of Shannan, Tibet.

In 1965 the Chinese government officially recognised Lhoba as one of the 56 ethnic groups in China. Lhobas are one of the smallest ethnic minority groups in China. Numbering 4,237 people, they make up about 0.1% of the population of the Tibet Autonomous Region.

== Etymology ==
Lhoba is the Tibetan exonym for the inhabitants of the Lhoyü region. The name means &quot;southerners&quot;.

==History==
The area nowadays inhabited by the modern Lhoba people was known in medieval texts as &quot;Lhoyü&quot; (or &quot;Luoyu&quot;, &quot;lho-yul&quot;, ལྷོ༌ཡུལ་). Lhoyü is now the name of an area in Tibet, while Lower Lhoyü is part of the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh. Luoyu came under the control of Tibet from the 7th century onwards.

It is not currently known whether modern-day Lhoba peoples in fact inhabited Luoyu at the time of Tibetan conquest, nor whether languages spoken by modern-day Lhoba peoples are indigenous to this region or not. While most Tani tribespeople living in modern-day Arunachal Pradesh point to a traditional homeland in or around this region, there is currently no independent means of verification.

Most people designated as &quot;Lhoba&quot; within the modern-day Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) actually refer to themselves via a diverse set of endonyms, speak different languages, and do not traditionally self-identify as a single entity. The two main tribal groups which fall under the designation &quot;Lhoba&quot; in the TAR are the Mishmi people (), who speak the Idu Mishmi language, and the speakers of the Bokar dialect of Abo Tani, who are found in far greater numbers inside Arunachal Pradesh, a state of modern-day India claimed by China.

Other groups identified by Chinese authorities as &quot;Lhoba&quot; include the Tagin people, who speak the Bangni-Tagin language.

Lhobas, with respect to the Chinese perception of Southern Tibet (administered by India as Arunachal Pradesh), have been part of Chinese documentary films and articles. This has been criticised as propaganda by pro-India propagandists such as Claude Arpi.

==Customs and dress==
Many customs, habits and dress of different clan members may vary. The Lhoba men in Luoyu wear knee-length black jackets without sleeves and buttons made out of sheep&#x27;s wool. They wear helmet-like hats either made from bearskin or woven from bamboo stripes or rattan laced with bearskin. They also wear ornaments that include earrings, necklaces made of beads, and bamboo plugs inserted into the ear lobe. The Lhoba women wear narrow-sleeved blouses and skirts of sheep&#x27;s wool. The weight of the ornaments the womenfolk wear is a symbol of their wealth, which includes shells, silver coins, iron chains bells, silver and brass earrings. Both sexes usually go barefooted. Their dress are quite similar to the Tibetan costume. The Idu men wear a sword and waterproof cane helmet, and a chignon on their hair and shields made of buffalo hide. Yidu weaponry includes straight Tibetan sword, dagger, bow and poisoned arrows.

Among the Yidu Lhoba (Idu Mishmi), one of the sub-tribes is the Bebejia Mishmi. Bebejia Mishmi women are expert weavers and make excellent coats and blouses.

The Idu houses are divided into a number of rooms for use of every married person. Unmarried girls and boys sleep in separate rooms. A fireplace occupies the centre of the room, round which the inmates sleep. The Idu are polygamous and each wife has their own rooms in the house. The family is organised in patriarchal principles. The inheritance of a widow is exceptional compared to a mother&#x27;s.

The wooden pillow of the master of the house is considered taboo to the inmates of the house as it is considered improper to sit upon it. Guests are not allowed to enter the room of the master of the house. The animal skulls preserved in the house are considered to be sacred.

The slash and burn method of cultivation, known as Jhum is the mainstay of the Idus, and clearing of land is carried for every three to five years. The important crops they raise are paddy, arum, tapioca, millet and maize. Rice is the staple food supplemented by millet maize and tapioca. They also take leafy vegetables, beans, gourd, sweet potato etc. Animal flesh is considered taboo to Idu woman. The Yidu also consume &quot;Yu&quot;, a locally brewed rice beer, and rice beer prepared by a woman during her period is taboo to a priest.

The Idu calendar was based upon the menstrual period of the women and dating is done by untying one each from a number of knots put on a piece of string. Traditional village panchayat (abbala) settle all internal disputes within the tribe.

==Culture and religion==
Lhoba people speak Tibeto-Burman language of Tani and Mishmi branches. In the past, when there was no writing, the Lhobas kept track of history through telling their descendants and tying knot codes about their past. Their literature poses a significant influence on their Tibetan counterparts. They are known as &quot;Bokar&quot; in Arunachal Pradesh of northeast India and are found in the Pidi and Monigong circles of Arunachal Pradesh. They trace their origin from a common forefather, Abotani. They follow the genealogy counting from Abotani as Nijum-Jumsi-Siki-Kiyor-Yorkar-Kardung-Duram-Ramdung/Ramgu/Ramgo. All Bokar groups have originated from Ramdung, Ramgo and Ramgu. Their immediate brothers are Galo, Ramo, Libo/Pailibo and Tagin.

The majority of Lhoba(Bokar)in India have now been converted to Christianity. Most are Pentecostal, although other denominations are also present.

The Lhoba engage in barter trade with the Tibetans, trading goods like animal hides, musk, bear paws, dye (locally knowns as &quot;tamen&quot; or botanically known as &quot;Rubia cordifolia&quot;) and captured game for farm tools, salt, wool, clothing, grain and tea from Tibetan traders. As a result of this constant trading, they have been increasingly influenced by the Tibetans in their dress. Many Lhobas have converted to Tibetan Buddhism in recent years as they traded with Buddhist monasteries, frequently blending it with their indigenous animist beliefs, which traditionally have deep roots in the tiger. Others, remain animistic, especially those in Arunachal Pradesh, who follow Donyi-Poloism; the pilgrimage centre of their community lies at Atho-Popu the Dibang valley. The stories about immigration are told along the banks of twelve rivers in the Dibang valley, the clustered area known as Cheithu-Huluni. The Yidu traditionally believe in a supreme god named &quot;Inni&quot;.

Festivals such as Reh are celebrated to appease the mold deities, who are traditionally believed to control the peace and prosperity of the people. Celebration with great fanfare and the performance of priest dances marks the end of the festival.

There are four funeral variants among the Yidu Lhoba (Idu Mishmi), and people of different social status would choose to conduct any of the variants. In all variants, an Igu priest would recite mourning songs for the dead. Mithuns are sacrificed in the &quot;Yah&quot; variant of the funeral, which lasts for three to four days.

Lhoba boys are trained to hunt at an early age. Women have low status in society and have no inheritance rights from their husbands or fathers.

The Lhoba enjoy a subtropical/warm temperate climate.

==Cuisine==
Lhoba cuisine varies across regions. Staple foods are dumplings made of maize or millet flour, rice or buckwheat or sago palm starch. In places near Tibetan communities people eat tsampa, potatoes, buttered tea and spicy food. Heavy drinkers and smokers, at celebrations the Lhobas sing and drink wine to celebrate good harvests and good luck. Buttered tea is their favorite drink. However, due to lack of salt, they suffer endemic goiter. Many are either born deaf or mute. Their population declined until recently due to this disease, and due to their low population, many either intermarry with Tibetans or with the tribal groups of Arunachal Pradesh, notably the Monpa.

== Dengba people ==
The Deng people (or &quot;Dengba&quot;, Chinese transcription of Taraon-Kaman languages: 代巴玫; Chinese: 僜人; Hanyu pinyin: Dèng Rén) are not officially recognised by the government of People&#x27;s Republic of China. They are related to the Derung people of Yunnan or the Taron people of Myanmar. They live in nine villages in Tibet&#x27;s Zayu County and virgin forest areas between the Himalayas and the Hengduan Mountains at an elevation of 1000 meters. Bradley (2007) reports 800 &#x27; (Chinese: Darang Deng) and 200 &#x27; (Chinese: Geman Deng; known as the Kaman or Miju Mishmi in India) in China, one village in Burma where they are known as &quot;Taraung&quot;, and the Taraon, Tayin, or Tain (formerly Digaru Mishmi) in northeastern India. Many of them have migrated from China to India.

<text>Rinteln () is a small town in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is located on the banks of the Weser river north of the Porta Westfalica. The town of Rinteln is in the broad valley between the hills of the Weserbergland and the North Lippe Bergland. In relation to some well known places, it is 60 kilometers west of Hanover, and just 20 kilometers from Hamelin of Pied Piper fame. Its population is about 28,500.

It is accessed by the A2 autobahn (E30).

==History==
The settlement of Rinteln was founded about 1150 on the northern bank of the Weser. Later, in 1235, the village of Neu-Rinteln (&quot;New Rinteln&quot;) was founded on the southern bank. It is the origin of the modern town, since the northern village was abandoned in 1350 due to the plague. The village grew to a fortified town, that served as a southern stronghold of the Counts of Schaumburg.

From 1621 until its dissolution in 1810 during the Westphalian rule under Jérôme Bonaparte, Rinteln was the seat of Ernestina University. When the County of Schaumburg was divided in 1640, Rinteln became the capital of the eastern part which retained the name &quot;Grafschaft Schaumburg hessischen Anteils&quot;. The Eulenburg in Rinteln became the seat of the counts. Rinteln remained the capital of the county and later of the district, until it was merged with the neighboring district of Schaumburg-Lippe in 1977. There was a British Forces hospital in Rinteln during the 1960s.

In 1875, the railway station was opened.

<text>Hameln-Pyrmont is a district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Schaumburg, Hanover, Hildesheim and Holzminden, and by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (district of Lippe).

==History==
A district called Hameln was established in 1885 within the Prussian Province of Hanover. At that time the city of Pyrmont was part of the Principality of Waldeck-Pyrmont. In 1921 Pyrmont decided in a plebiscite to leave Waldeck-Pyrmont and to join Prussia. The Prussian administration assigned the city to the district of Hameln, which was renamed to Hameln-Pyrmont.

In 1923 Hameln became a district-free city and was not part of the district until 1973, when it was reincorporated. Further enlargements of the district&#x27;s territory took place in 1974 and 1977, when the cities of Bad Münder and Hessisch Oldendorf joined the district.

==Geography==
The district is located in the northern part of the Weserbergland mountains. The Weser River enters the district in the south, runs through Hameln and leaves in the northwest towards Rinteln.

==Coat of arms==

The lion is the heraldic animal of the County of Everstein, which ruled over the territory until 1429. The red cross in the lion&#x27;s hands was the symbol of Pyrmont.

<doc id="153039" wikidata="Q216786" url="?curid=153039" title="Champa">
<text>Champa (Cham: ꨌꩌꨛꨩ, چمڤا; ; 占城 or 占婆) was a collection of independent Cham polities that extended across the coast of what is present-day central and southern Vietnam from approximately the 2nd century CE until 1832. 

According to earliest historical references found in ancient sources, the first Cham polities were established around the 2nd to 3rd centuries CE, in the wake of Khu Liên&#x27;s rebellion against the rule of China&#x27;s Eastern Han dynasty, and lasted until when the final remaining principality of Champa was annexed by Emperor Minh Mạng of the Vietnamese Nguyễn dynasty as part of the expansionist Nam tiến policy. The kingdom was known variously as &quot;Nagaracampa&quot; (), &quot;Champa&quot; (ꨌꩌꨛꨩ) in modern Cham, and &quot;Châmpa&quot; () in the Khmer inscriptions, &quot;Chiêm Thành&quot; in Vietnamese, &quot;Campa&quot; in Malay, &quot;Zhànchéng&quot; (Mandarin: 占城) in Chinese records, and &quot;al-Ṣanf&quot; (Arabic: صَنْف) in Middle Eastern Muslim records.

Early Champa evolved from the seafaring Austronesian Chamic Sa Huỳnh culture off the coast of modern-day Vietnam. Its emergence in the late 2nd century CE exemplifies early Southeast Asian statecraft at a crucial stage of the making of Southeast Asia. The peoples of Champa maintained a system of lucrative trade networks across the region, connecting the Indian Ocean and Eastern Asia, until the 17th century. In Champa, historians also found the Đông Yên Châu inscription, the oldest known native Southeast Asian literature written in a native Southeast Asian language dating to around 350 CE, predating first Khmer, Mon, Malay texts by centuries.

Scholarly consensus has shifted several times as to what degree Champa functioned as a unified polity. Originally being viewed as a unified kingdom throughout most of its history, later authors suggested that Champa was better considered to be a federation of independent states. A number of modern scholars have suggested that Champa did form a unified kingdom in some periods but was disunified in others.

The Chams of modern Vietnam and Cambodia are the major remnants of this former kingdom. They speak Chamic languages, a subfamily of Malayo-Polynesian closely related to the Malayic and Bali–Sasak languages that is spoken throughout maritime Southeast Asia. Although Cham culture is usually intertwined with the broader culture of Champa, the kingdom had a multiethnic population, which consisted of Austronesian Chamic-speaking peoples that made up the majority of its demographics. The people who used to inhabit the region are the present-day Chamic-speaking Cham, Rade and Jarai peoples in South and Central Vietnam and Cambodia; the Acehnese from Northern Sumatra, Indonesia, along with elements of Austroasiatic Bahnaric and Katuic-speaking peoples in Central Vietnam.

Champa was preceded in the region by a kingdom called Lâm Ấp (Vietnamese), or Linyi (, Middle Chinese (ZS): *&quot;liɪm ʔˠiɪp̚&quot;), that was in existence since 192 AD; although the historical relationship between &quot;Linyi&quot; and &quot;Champa&quot; is not clear. &quot;Champa&quot; reached its apogee in the 9th and 10th centuries CE. Thereafter, it began a gradual decline under pressure from Đại Việt, the Vietnamese polity centered in the region of modern Hanoi. In 1832, the Vietnamese emperor Minh Mạng annexed the remaining Cham territories.

Hinduism, adopted through conflicts and conquest of territory from neighboring Funan in the 4th century CE, shaped the art and culture of the Cham Kingdom for centuries, as testified by the many Cham Hindu statues and red brick temples that dotted the landscape in Cham lands. Mỹ Sơn, a former religious center, and Hội An, one of Champa&#x27;s main port cities, are now World Heritage Sites. Today, many Cham people adhere to Islam, a conversion which began in the 10th century, with the ruling dynasty having fully adopted the faith by the 17th century; they are called the Bani (&quot;Ni tục&quot;, from Arabic: Bani). There are, however, the Bacam (&quot;Bacham&quot;, Chiêm tục) who still retain and preserve their Hindu faith, rituals, and festivals. The &quot;Bacam&quot; is one of the few surviving non-Indic indigenous Hindu peoples in the world, with a culture dating back thousands of years. The other being the Balinese Hindus of the Balinese people and Tengger Hindus of the Javanese people in Indonesia.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Champa&quot; derived from the Sanskrit word (pronounced ), which refers to &quot;Magnolia champaca&quot;, a species of flowering tree known for its fragrant flowers. Rolf Stein proposed that &quot;Champa&quot; might have been inspired when Austronesian sailors originating from Central Vietnam arrived in present-day Eastern India around the area of Champapuri, an ancient sacred city in Buddhism, for trade, then adopted the name for their people back in their homeland. While Louis Finot argued that the name Champa was brought by Indians to Central Vietnam.

Other academics however dispute the Indic origin explanation, which was conceived by Louis Finot, a colonial-era board director of the École française d&#x27;Extrême-Orient. In his 2005 &quot;Champa revised,&quot; Michael Vickery challenges Finot&#x27;s idea. He argues that the Cham people always refer themselves as &quot;Čaṃ&quot; rather than &quot;Champa&quot; (pa–abbreviation of &quot;peśvara&quot;, &quot;Campādeśa&quot;, &quot;Campānagara&quot;). Most indigenous Austronesian ethnic groups in Central Vietnam such as the Rade, Jarai, Chru, Roglai peoples call the Cham by similar lexemes which likely derived from &quot;Čaṃ.&quot; Vietnamese historical accounts also have the Cham named as &quot;Chiêm.&quot; Most importantly, the official designation of Champa in Chinese historical texts was &quot;Zhànchéng &quot; – meaning &quot;the city of the Cham,&quot; &quot;why not city of the Champa?,&quot; Vickery doubts.

==Historiography==

===Sources===

The historiography of Champa relies upon four types of sources:
* Physical remains, including ruins as well as stone sculptures;
* Inscriptions in Cham, Sanskrit, and Arabic (Kufic) on steles and other stone surfaces;
* Chinese and Vietnamese annals, diplomatic reports, and other literature such as those provided by Jia Dan;
* Historiography of modern Cham people.

Approximately four hundred Champa inscriptions have been found. Around 250 of them were deciphered and studied throughout the last century. Many Cham inscriptions were destroyed by American bombing during the Vietnam War. Currently, the Project &quot;Corpus of the Inscriptions of Campā&quot; launched by French School of Asian Studies (EFEO) partnering with the Institute for Study of the Ancient World (ISAW) of New York University is tasked for cataloging, sustaining and preserving ancient Cham inscriptions into an online index library and publications of scholarship&#x27;s epigraphical studies into English, French, and Vietnamese.

The Cham have their written records in form of paper book, known as the &quot;Sakkarai dak rai patao&quot;, was a 5227-pages collection of Cham veritable records, documenting a history range from early legendary kings of 11th–13th century to the deposition of Po Thak The, the last king of Panduranga in 1832, reckoning in total 39 rulers of Panduranga, the tales of spread of Islam to Champa in 1000 CE, to Po Thak The. The annals were written in Akhar Thrah (traditional) Cham script with collection of Cham and Vietnamese seals imprinted by Vietnamese rulers. However, it had been dismissed for a long time by scholars until Po Dharma. Cham literature also have been greatly preserved in approximately more than 3,000 Cham manuscripts and printed books dating from the 16th to 20th centuries. The Southeast Asia Digital Library (SEADL) at Northern Illinois University currently contains an extensive collection of 977 digitized Cham manuscripts, totaling more than 57,800 pages of multigenre content.

===Overarching theories===
Modern scholarship has been guided by two competing theories in the historiography of Champa. Scholars agree that historically Champa was divided into several regions or principalities spread out from south to north along the coast of modern Vietnam and united by a common language, culture, and heritage. It is acknowledged that the historical record is not equally rich for each of the regions in every historical period. For example, in the 10th century CE, the record is richest for &quot;Indrapura&quot;; in the 12th century CE, it is richest for Vijaya; following the 15th century CE, it is richest for &quot;Panduranga&quot;. Some scholars have taken these shifts in the historical record to reflect the movement of the Cham capital from one location to another. According to such scholars, if the 10th-century record is richest for Indrapura, it is so because at that time Indrapura was the capital of Champa. Other scholars have disputed this contention, holding that Champa was never a united country, and arguing that the presence of a particularly rich historical record for a given region in a given period is no basis for claiming that the region functioned as the capital of a united Champa during that period.

==History==
===Sources of foreign cultural influence===
Through the centuries, Cham culture and society were influenced by forces emanating from Cambodia, China, Java, and India amongst others. An official successfully revolted against Chinese rule in modern central Vietnam, and Lâm Ấp, a predecessor state in the region, began its existence in 192 CE. In the 4th century CE, wars with the neighbouring Kingdom of Funan in Cambodia and the acquisition of Funanese territory led to the infusion of Indian culture into Cham society. Sanskrit was adopted as a scholarly language, and Hinduism, especially Shaivism, became the state religion. Starting from the 10th century CE, the Arab maritime trade introduces Islamic cultural and religious influences to the region. Although Hinduism was the predominant religion among the Cham people until the 16th century, Islam began to attract large numbers of Chams, when some members of the Cham royalty converted to Islam in the 17th century. Champa came to serve as an important link in the spice trade, which stretched from the Persian Gulf to South China, and later in the Arab maritime routes in Mainland Southeast Asia as a supplier of aloe.

Despite the frequent wars between the Cham and the Khmer, the two nations also traded and their cultural influences moved in the same directions. Since royal families of the two countries intermarried frequently. Champa also had close trade and cultural relations with the powerful maritime empire of Srivijaya and later with the Majapahit of the Malay Archipelago, its easternmost trade relations being with the kingdoms of Ma-i, Butuan, and Sulu in the modern Philippines.

Evidence gathered from linguistic studies around Aceh confirms that a very strong Chamic cultural influence existed in Indonesia; this is indicated by the use of the Chamic language Acehnese as the main language in the coastal regions of Aceh. Linguists believe the Acehnese language, a descendant of the Proto-Chamic language, separated from the Chamic tongue sometime in the 1st millennium BCE. However, scholarly views on the precise nature of Aceh-Chamic relations vary. Tsat, a northern Chamic language spoken by the Utsul on the Hainan Island, is speculated to be separated from Cham at the time when contact between Champa and Islam had grown considerably, but precise details remain inadequate. Under Chinese language influence over Hainan, Tsat has become fully monosyllabic, while some certain shifts to monosyllabicity can be observed in Eastern Cham (in contact with Vietnamese). Eastern Cham has developed a quasi-registral, incipiently tonal system. After the fall of Vijaya Champa in 1471, another group of Cham and Chamic might have moved west, forming Haroi, which has reversal Bahnaric linguistic influences.

===Founding legend===
According to Cham folk legends, Champa was founded by Lady Po Nagar–the divine mother goddess of the kingdom. She came from the Moon, arrived in modern Central Vietnam and founded the kingdom, but a typhoon drifted her away and left her stranded on the coast of China, where she married a Chinese prince, and returned to Champa. The Po Nagar temple built in Nha Trang during the 8th century, and rebuilt in the 11th century was dedicated to her. Her portrayal image in the temple is said to date from 965 CE, it is of a commanding personage seated cross-legged upon a throne. She is also worshiped by the Vietnamese, a tradition that dates back to the 11th century during the Ly dynasty period.

===Formation and growth===
The Chams descended from seafaring settlers who reached the Southeast Asian mainland from Borneo about the time of the Sa Huỳnh culture between 1000 BCE and 200 CE, the predecessor of the Cham kingdom. The Cham language is part of the Austronesian family. According to one study, Cham is related most closely to modern Acehnese in northern Sumatra.

The Sa Huỳnh culture was an Austronesian seafaring culture that centered around present-day Central Vietnam coastal region. During its heyday, the culture distributed across the Central Vietnam coast and had commercial links across the South China Sea with the Philippine archipelago and even with Taiwan (through Maritime Jade Road, Sa Huynh-Kalanay Interaction Sphere), which now most archaeologists and scholars have consentient determined and are no longer hesitant in linking with the ancestors of the Austronesian Cham and Chamic-speaking peoples.

While Northern Vietnam Kinh people assimilated Han Chinese immigrants into their population, have a sinicized culture, Cham people carry the patrilineal R-M17 haplogroup of South Asian Indian origin from South Asian merchants spreading Hinduism to Champa and marrying Cham females since Chams have no matrilineal South Asian mtDNA, and this fits with the matrilocal structure of Cham families. And compared to other Vietnamese ethnic groups, the Cham do not share ancestry with southern Han Chinese, along with Austronesian-speaking Mang.

Champa was known to the Chinese as 林邑 &quot;Linyi&quot; in Mandarin, &quot;Lam Yap&quot; in Cantonese and to the Vietnamese, &quot;Lâm Ấp&quot; (which is the Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation of 林邑). The state of Champa was founded in 192 CE by Khu Liên (Ou Lian), an official of the Eastern Han dynasty of China in Xianglin who rebelled against Chinese rule in 192.
Around the 4th century CE, Cham polities began to absorb much of Indic influences, probably through its neighbor, Funan. Hinduism was established as Champa began to create Sanskrit stone inscriptions and erect red brick Hindu temples. The first king acknowledged in the inscriptions is Bhadravarman, who reigned from 380 to 413 CE. At Mỹ Sơn, King Bhadravarman established a linga called Bhadresvara, whose name was a combination of the king&#x27;s own name and that of the Hindu god of gods Shiva. The worship of the original god-king under the name Bhadresvara and other names continued through the centuries that followed.

Being famously known as skillful sailors and navigators, as early as the 5th century CE, the Cham might have reached India by themselves. King Gangaraja (r. 413–?) of Champa was perhaps the only known Southeast Asian ruler who traveled all the way to India shortly after his abdication. He personally went on pilgrimage in the Ganges River, Northeast India. His itinerary was confirmed by both indigenous Cham sources and Chinese chronicles. George Coedès notes that during the 2nd and 3rd century, an influx of Indian traders, priests, and scholars travelled along the early East Asia–South Asian subcontinent maritime route, could have visited and made communications with local Chamic communities along the coast of Central Vietnam. They played some roles in disseminating Indian culture and Buddhism. But that was not sustained and decisive as active &quot;Indianized native societies,&quot; he argues, or Southeast Asian kingdoms that had already been &quot;Indianized&quot; like Funan, were the key factors of the process. On the other hand, Paul Mus suggests the reason for the peaceful acceptance of Hinduism by the Cham elite was likely related to the tropical monsoon climate background shared by areas like the Bay of Bengal, coastal mainland Southeast Asia all the way from Myanmar to Vietnam. Monsoon societies tended to practice animism, most importantly, the creed of earth spirit. To the early Southeast Asian peoples, Hinduism was somewhat similar to their original beliefs. This resulted in peaceful conversions to Hinduism and Buddhism in Champa with little resistance.

Rudravarman I of Champa (r. 529–572), a descendant of Gangaraja through maternal line, became king of Champa in 529 CE. During his reign, the temple complex of Bhadresvara was destroyed by a great fire in 535/536. He was succeeded by his son Sambhuvarman (r. 572–629). He reconstructed the temple of Bhadravarman and renamed it Shambhu-bhadreshvara. In 605, the Sui Empire launched an invasion of Lam Ap, overrunning Sambhuvarman&#x27;s resistance, and sacked the Cham capital at Tra Kieu. He died in 629 and was succeeded by his son, Kandarpadharma, who died in 630–31. Kandarpadharma was succeeded by his son, Prabhasadharma, who died in 645.

===Champa at its height===
Several granite tablets and inscriptions from My Son, Tra Kieu, Hue, Khanh Hoa dated 653–687 report a Cham king named Jaya Prakāśadharma who ascended the throne of Champa as Vikrantavarman I (r. 653–686). Prakāśadharma had thorough knowledge of Sanskrit learning, Sanskrit literature, and Indian cosmology. He authorized many constructions of religious sanctuaries at My Son and several building projects throughout the kingdom, laying down the foundations for the Champa art and architectural styles. He also sent many embassies regularly to the Tang Empire and neighboring Khmer. The Chinese reckoned Champa during the 7th century as the chief tributary state of the South, on par with the Korean kingdoms of Koguryŏ in the Northeast and Baekje in the East – &quot;though the latter was rivaled by Japan.&quot;

Between the 7th to 10th centuries CE, the Cham polities rose to become a naval power; as Cham ports attracted local and foreign traders, Cham fleets also controlled the trade in spices and silk in the South China Sea, between China, the Indonesian archipelago and India. They supplemented their income from the trade routes not only by exporting ivory and aloe, but also by engaging in piracy and raiding. However, the rising influence of Champa caught the attention of a neighbouring thalassocracy that considered Champa as a rival, the Javanese (Javaka, probably refers to Srivijaya, ruler of the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Java). In 767, the Tonkin coast was raided by a Javanese fleet (Daba) and Kunlun pirates, Champa was subsequently assaulted by Javanese or Kunlun vessels in 774 and 787. In 774 an assault was launched on Po-Nagar in Nha Trang where the pirates demolished temples, while in 787 an assault was launched on Virapura, near Phan Rang. The Javanese invaders continued to occupy southern Champa coastline until being driven off by Indravarman I (r. 787–801) in 799.
In 875, a new Buddhist dynasty founded by Indravarman II (r. ? – 893) moved the capital or the major center of Champa to the north again. Indravarman II established the city of Indrapura, near My Son and ancient Simhapura. Mahayana Buddhism eclipsed Hinduism, becoming the state religion. Art historians often attribute the period between 875 and 982 as the Golden Age of Champa art and Champa culture (distinguish with modern Cham culture). Unfortunately, a Vietnamese invasion in 982 led by king Le Hoan of Dai Viet, followed by Lưu Kế Tông (r. 986–989), a fanatical Vietnamese usurper who took the throne of Champa in 983, brought mass destruction to Northern Champa. Indrapura was still one of the major centers of Champa until being surpassed by Vijaya in the 12th century.

===Relations and warfare with the Khmer and the Viet, c. 1000–1471===
The &quot;History of Song&quot; notes that to the east of Champa through a two-day journey lay the country of Ma-i at Mindoro, Philippines; which Champa had trade relations with.

Afterwards, during the 1000s, Rajah Kiling, the Hindu king of the Philippine Rajahnate of Butuan instigated a commercial rivalry with the Champa Civilization by requesting diplomatic equality in court protocol towards his Rajahnate, from the Chinese Empire, which was later denied by the Chinese Imperial court, mainly because of favoritism for the Champa civilization. However, the future Rajah of Butuan, Sri Bata Shaja later succeeded in attaining diplomatic equality with Champa by sending the flamboyant ambassador Likanhsieh. Likanhsieh shocked the Emperor Zhenzong by presenting a memorial engraved on a golden tablet, some white dragon (&quot;Bailong&quot; 白龍) camphor, Moluccan cloves, and a South Sea slave at the eve of an important ceremonial state sacrifice.

The Champa civilization and what would later be the Sultanate of Sulu which was still Hindu at that time and known as Lupah Sug, which is also in the Philippines, engaged in commerce with each other which resulted in merchant Chams settling in Sulu from the 10th-13th centuries, establishing trading centers. There they were called Orang Dampuan and, due to their wealth, many of them were killed by native Sulu Buranuns. The Buranun were then subjected to retaliatory killings by the Orang Dampuan. Harmonious commerce between Sulu and the Orang Dampuan was later restored. The Yakans were descendants of the Taguima-based Orang Dampuan who came to Sulu from Champa.
The twelfth century in Champa is defined by constant social upheavals and warfare, Khmer invasions were frequent. The Khmer Empire conquered Northern Champa in 1145, but were quickly repulsed by king Jaya Harivarman I (r. 1148–1167). Another Angkorian invasion of Champa led by Suryavarman II in summer 1150 also was quickly stalled, and Suryavarman died en route. Champa then plummeted into an eleven-year civil war between Jaya Harivarman and his oppositions, which resulted in Champa reunifying under Jaya Harivarman by 1161. After having restored the kingdom and its prosperity, in June 1177 Jaya Indravarman IV (r. 1167–1192) launched a surprise naval assault on Angkor, capital of Cambodia, plundering it, slaying the Khmer king, leading to a Cham occupation of Cambodia for the next four years. Jayavarman VII of Angkor launched several counterattack campaigns in the 1190s (1190, 1192, 1194–1195, 1198–1203), conquering Champa and making it a dependency of the Khmer Empire for 30 years.
Champa was subjected to a Mongol Yuan invasion in 1283–1285. Before the invasion, Kublai Khan ordered the establishment of a mobile secretariat (&quot;xingsheng&quot;) in Champa for the purpose of dominating the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean trade networks. It demonstrated the strategic importance of Champa as a naval juggernaut of medieval maritime Eurasia. The Yuan campaign led by General Sogetu against the Cham began in February 1283 with their initial capture of Vijaya forcing the Cham king Indravarman V (r. 1258–1287) and Prince Harijit to wage a guerrilla resistance against the Yuan for two years, together with Dai Viet, eventually repelling the Mongols back to China by June 1285. After the Yuan wars ended decisively in 1288, Dai Viet king Trần Nhân Tông spent his retirement years in Northern Champa, and arranged a marriage between his daughter, Princess Huyền Trân, and Prince Harijit – now reigning as Jaya Simhavarman III (r. 1288–1307) – in 1306 in exchange for peace and territory. From 1307 to 1401, not even a single surviving indigenous source exists in Champa, and almost all of its 14th-century history has to rely on Chinese and Vietnamese sources. Engraving Sanskrit inscription, the prestige language of religious and political elites in Champa, stopped in 1253. No other grand temple or other construction project was built after 1300. These facts marked the beginning of Champa&#x27;s decline.

From 1367 to 1390, according to Chinese and Vietnamese sources, Che Bong Nga, who ruled as king of Champa from 1360 to 1390, had restored Champa. He launched six invasions of Dai Viet during the deadly Champa–Đại Việt War (1367–1390), sacking its capital in 1371, 1377, 1378, and 1383, nearly bringing the Dai Viet to its collapse. Che Bong Nga was only stopped in 1390 on a naval battle in which the Vietnamese deployed firearms for the first time, and miraculously killed the king of Champa, ending the devastating war.

After Che Bong Nga, Champa seemingly rebounced to its status quo under a new dynasty of Jaya Simhavarman VI (r. 1390–1400). His successor Indravarman VI (r. 1400–1441) reigned for the next 41 years, expanding Champa&#x27;s territory to the Mekong Delta amidst the decline of the Angkorian Empire. One of Indravarman&#x27;s nephews, Prince Śrīndra-Viṣṇukīrti Virabhadravarman, became king of Champa in 1441. By the mid 15th century, Champa might have been suffering a steady dooming decline. No inscription survived after 1456. The Vietnamese under the strong king Le Thanh Tong launched an invasion of Champa in early 1471, decimating the capital of Vijaya and most of northern Champa. For early historians like Georges Maspero, &quot;the 1471 conquest had concluded the end of the Champa Kingdom.&quot; Maspero, like other early orientalist scholars, by his logics, arbitrated the history of Champa as becoming a &quot;worthy&quot; subject for their study when it adapted and maintained &quot;superior&quot; Indian civilization.

The relationship between Champa and the Javanese states is also recorded in various historical chronicles, mainly in the 15th and 16th centuries. Especially the marriage relationship between the princesses of Champa and the kings of Java. The Cham people were also one of the main pioneers in the spread of Islam on the north coast of Central Java. One of the famous Islamic scholars of Champa descent in Java is Sunan Ampel, one of the nine Walisanga. He had a Champa mother.

===Decline===


In the Cham–Vietnamese War (1471), Champa suffered serious defeats at the hands of the Vietnamese, in which 120,000 people were either captured or killed. 50 members of the Cham royal family and some 20–30,000 were taken prisoners and deported, including the king of Champa Tra Toan, who died along his way to the north in captivity. Contemporary reports from China record a Cham envoy telling to the Chinese court: &quot;Annam destroyed our country&quot; with additional notes of massive burning and looting, in which 40 to 60,000 people were slaughtered. The kingdom was reduced to a small enclave near Nha Trang and Phan Rang with many Chams fleeing to Cambodia.

Champa was reduced to the principalities of Panduranga and Kauthara at the beginning of the 16th century. Kauthara was annexed by the Vietnamese in 1653. From 1799 to 1832, Panduranga lost its hereditary monarchy status, with kings selected and appointed by the Vietnamese court in Huế.

The last remaining principality of Champa, Panduranga, survived until August 1832, when Minh Mang of Vietnam began his purge against rival Le Van Duyet&#x27;s faction, and accused the Cham leaders of supporting Duyet. Minh Mang ordered the last Cham king Po Phaok The and the vice-king Po Dhar Kaok to be arrested in Hue, while incorporating the last remnants of Champa into what are the Ninh Thuan and Binh Thuan provinces.

To enforce his finger grip, Minh Mang appointed Vietnamese bureaucrats from Hue to govern the Cham directly in &quot;phủ&quot; Ninh Thuan while removing the traditional Cham customary laws. Administratively, Panduranga was integrated into Vietnam proper with harsh measures. These reforms were known as &quot;cải thổ quy lưu&quot; (&quot;replacing thổ [aboriginal] chieftains by circulating bureaucratic system&quot;). Speaking Vietnamese and following Vietnamese customs became strictly mandatory for the Cham subjects. Cham culture and Cham identity were rapidly, systematically destroyed. Vietnamese settlers seized most of Cham farmlands and commodity productions, pushing the Cham to far-inland arid highlands, and the Cham were subjected to heavy taxations and mandated conscriptions. Two widespread Cham revolts against Minh Mang&#x27;s oppression arose in 1833–1835, the latter led by khatib Ja Thak Wa – a Cham Bani cleric – which was more successful and even briefly reestablished a Cham state for a short period of time, before being crushed by Minh Mang&#x27;s forces.

The unfortunate defeat of the people of Panduranga in their struggle against Vietnamese oppression also sealed their and remnant of Champa&#x27;s fate. A large chunk of the Cham in Panduranga were subjected to forced assimilation by the Vietnamese, while many Cham, including indigenous highland peoples, were indiscriminately killed by the Vietnamese in massacres, particularly from 1832 to 1836, during the Sumat and Ja Thak Wa uprisings. Bani mosques were razed to the ground. Temples were set on fire. Cham villages and their aquatic livelihoods were annihilated. By that time, the Cham totally lost their ancestors&#x27; seafaring and shipbuilding traditions.

After finalizing these heavy-handed pacifications of Cham rebels and assimilation policies, emperor Minh Mang declared the Cham of Panduranga a &quot;Tân Dân&quot; (new people), denoting the imposed mundanity that nothing to ever differentiate them with other Vietnamese. Minh Mang&#x27;s son and successor Thiệu Trị, however, reverted most of his father&#x27;s strict policies against Catholic Christians and ethnic minorities. Under Thiệu Trị and Tu Duc, the Cham were reallowed to practice their religions with little prohibition.

Only a small fraction, or about 40,000 Cham people in the old Panduranga remained in 1885 when the French completed their acquisition of Vietnam. The French colonial administration prohibited Kinh discrimination and prejudice against Cham and indigenous highland peoples, putting an end to Vietnamese cultural genocide of the Cham. But French colonialists also exploited the ethnic hatred in situ between Vietnamese and Cham to deal with remnant of the Can Vuong movement in Binh Thuan.

==Government==
===King===
The King of Champa is the title ruler of Champa. Champa rulers often use two Hinduist style titles: &quot;raja-di-raja&quot; ( &quot;raja of rajas&quot; or &quot;king of kings&quot;: written here in Devanagari since the Cham used their own Cham script) or &quot;pu po tana raya&quot; (&quot;lord of all territories&quot;). They would be addressed by style &quot;ganreh patrai&quot; (his Majesty). Officially, the king was the patron of art and construction. Majestic temples and shrines were built dedicated to the honor of the king of kings, his ancestors, and their beloved gods (usually Śiva). Some charismatic Cham kings declared themselves &quot;Protector of Champa&quot; in celebrating royal ceremony and coronation (&quot;abhiseka&quot;) which involves supernatural and spiritual rituals to demonstrate the king&#x27;s authority.

The regnal name of the Champa rulers originated from the Hindu tradition, often consisting of titles and aliases. Titles (prefix) like: Jaya ( &quot;victory&quot;), Maha ( &quot;great&quot;), Sri ( &quot;glory&quot;). Aliases (stem) like: Bhadravarman, Vikrantavarman, Rudravarman, Simhavarman, Indravarman, Paramesvaravarman, Harivarman... Among them, the suffix -varman belongs to the Kshatriya class and is only for those leaders of the Champa Alliance.

Started from the 17th century, Champa kings used title &quot;Paduka Seri Sultan&quot; in some occasions, a borrowed honorific from Muslim Malay rulers.

The 13th-century Chinese gazetteer account &quot;Zhu Fan Zhi&quot; (c. 1225) describes the Cham king &#x27;wears a headdress of gold and adorns his body with strings of jewels&#x27; and either rides on an elephant or is lifted on a &#x27;cloth hammock by four men&#x27; when he goes outside the palace. When the king attends the court audience, he is encircled by &#x27;thirty female attendants who carry swords and shields or betel nuts&#x27;. Court officials would make reports to the king, then make one prostration before leaving.

The last king of Champa, Po Phaok The, was deposed by Minh Mạng in 1832.

===Administration===
During the reign of the king Prakasadharma (r. 653–686 AD), when Champa was briefly ruled by a strong monarch, the territories of the kingdom stretch from present-day Quảng Bình to Khánh Hòa. An internal division called viṣaya (district) was first introduced. There were at least two viṣaya: Caum and Midit. Each of them has a handful number of local &quot;koṣṭhāgāras&quot; – known as &#x27;source of stable income to upkeep the worship of three gods.

During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, northern Champa was consisted by several known districts (viṣaya, zhou 洲): Amaravati (Quảng Ngãi), Ulik (Thừa Thiên–Huế), Vvyar (Quảng Trị), Jriy (southern Quảng Bình), and Traik (northern Quảng Bình). Other junctions like Panduranga remained quietly autonomous.

===Federation or absolutism?===

The classical narrative of &#x27;the Champa Kingdom&#x27; brought by earlier generations of scholarship, Georges Maspero and George Coedes, created the illusion of a unified Champa. Recent revisionist historians in the 1980s, for example Po Dharma and Trần Quốc Vượng, refuted the concept of single Champa. Chinese historical texts, Cham inscriptions, and especially the Cham annals, the &quot;Sakkarai dak rai patao&quot;, both confirm the existence of multi-Campa scenarios. Po Dharma argues that Champa was not a single kingdom or centralized in the manner of Đại Việt but likely a confederation of kingdom(s) and individual city-states for most of its history. For several periods from the 700s to 1471, there was the king of kings or the overlord based out of the most significant powerful cities like Indrapura and Vijaya, who wielded more power, influence, and sense of unity over the other Cham kings and princes, and perhaps those minor local kings and princes (Yuvarāja – not necessary mean crown prince) or regional military commander/warlords (senāpati) were from local associates that had no connection with the dominant ruling dynasty or could be a member of that royal lineage within the perimeter of the mandala. Mandala is the term coined by O. W. Wolters describing the distribution of state power among small states within large kingdoms in premodern Southeast Asia.

Two notable examples of this multi-centric nature of Champa were the principalities of Kauthara and Pāṇḍuraṅga. When Northern Champa and Vijaya fell to the Vietnamese in 1471, Kauthara and Pāṇḍuraṅga persisted existing untouched. Kauthara fell to the Vietnamese 200 years later in 1653, while Panduranga was annexed in 1832. Pāṇḍuraṅga had its full list of kings ruled from the 13th century until 1832, which both Vietnamese and European sources had verified. So Pāṇḍuraṅga remained autonomous and could conduct its foreign affairs without permission from the court of the king of kings.

According to the &quot;Huanghua Sidaji&quot; (皇華四達記, 800 AD?), which then was complied into the &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot;, a Tang prime minister named Jia Dan detailing his itineraries to Champa, began with his arrival in a northern Cham state called Huánwáng (環王國), probably located in modern-day Quảng Trị that had invaded the Tang southernmost province of Annan in 803. The center of Champa by the late 8th and early 9th centuries was in the south, in Gǔdá Guó 古笪國 (Kauthara), Bēntuólàng 奔陀浪洲 (Pāṇḍuraṅga). Chinese texts from 758 to 809 referred to the whole of Champa as Huánwáng, but it must be a convenient way for the Chinese to assume the name of a state that had deployed diplomacy and war with them to be the toponym for all territories of the Cham confederation. The Cham assaulted the Tang and seized Nghệ An in 803. The Chinese barely defeated the Cham and recovered lost regions in 809. Harivarman I (r. 803–?) left a document in Po Nagar Temple (Nha Trang) dating from 817, explaining his campaign in northern Champa to expel the Chinese (&quot;Cinas&quot; in the inscription, today &quot;lauv&quot; in modern Cham language) when they menaced to the northern Cham states.

===Military===
The Champa kingdom had a relatively small and poorly-organized military compared to its powerful neighbors, the Khmer and Dai Viet empires. They did not have a well-defined military hierarchy with ranks like modern armies. However, distinctions were likely made between ordinary soldiers, officers, and high-ranking leaders. Their ranks consists of a commander-in-chief (&quot;Tien tong&quot;), generals (&quot;Tong binh&quot;), colonels (&quot;Tien si&quot;), and captains (&quot;Si binh&quot;). The officers in the Champa military were likely appointed by the king or other high-ranking officials. Their responsibilities may have included training and leading troops, as well as managing logistics and supplies. The high-ranking leaders in the Champa military such as generals were likely members of the royal family or other nobility and the low-ranking leaders were likely commoners. The generals were responsible for leading armies, while the colonels lead regiments and battalions and captains led companies. They have had overall command of the army and were responsible for making strategic decisions and negotiating alliances with other powers. The Champa Navy was a formidable force that allowed the Chams to dominate trade and commerce in Southeast Asia. Their navy was used for warfare and exploration, marketing, and transportation of goods. The Chams were known for their seafaring skills, and they had established trade routes across the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, which allowed them to trade with other kingdoms and empires in the region.

==Geography of historical Champa==

Between the 2nd and the 15th centuries CE, Champa&#x27;s territorial extent at times included the modern provinces of Quảng Bình, Quảng Trị, Huế, Da Nang, Quảng Nam, Quảng Ngãi, Bình Định, Phú Yên, Khánh Hòa, Ninh Thuận, and Bình Thuận, and most of the Central Highlands might have been lightly governed or influenced by coastal Cham. Though Cham territory included the mountainous zones west of the coastal plain and (at times) extended into present-day Laos, for the most part, the Cham remained a seafaring people dedicated to trading and maintained few settlements of any size away from the coast. Scholarships also hold consensus that Champa, like Dai Viet, was always polyethnic and ethnic flexible, not just the Cham people alone, but also encompassed several different ethnic groups such as Jarai, Rhadé, and Bahnar/Bahnaric-speaking and Katuic-speaking peoples. It is clear that the Katuic-speaking and Bahnaric-speaking peoples of the Central Highlands in Vietnam and Central Laos had been engaged in a long, direct and complex contact with Chamic-speaking peoples, resulting in Chamic mutual lexical similarities of the two Austroasiatic ethnolinguistic groups, although it is highly likely that most of these borrowings came to Katuics and Bahnarics via the Highland Chamics. Others argue that Cham rule once might have stretched as far west as the Mekong River in the present-day Lao province of Campassak. However, boundaries between premodern Southeast Asian states in most cases were remote hinterlands, extreme mountains and limestones covered by thick jungles with few inland trade routes, and can not be accurately determined.

Historical Champa consisted of up to five principalities:
* Indrapura (&quot;City of Indra&quot;, &quot;Foshi&quot;, &quot;Phật thành/Phật thệ thành&quot;) was the capital of Champa from about 875 to about 1100 CE. It was located at the site of the modern village of Đồng Dương, near the modern city of Da Nang. Also found in the region of Da Nang is the ancient Cham city of Singhapura (&quot;City of the Lion&quot;), the location of which has been identified with an archaeological site in the modern village of Trà Kiệu, and the valley of Mỹ Sơn, where a number of ruined temples and towers can still be seen. The associated port was at modern Hội An. The territory once controlled by this principality included present-day Quảng Bình, Quảng Trị, and Huế.
* Amaravati was located in present-day Châu Sa citadel of Quảng Ngãi Province. The earliest mention of Amaravati is from an 1160 CE inscription at Po Nagar.
* Vijaya was located in present-day Bình Định Province (Tumpraukvijaya). Early mention is made of Vijaya in an 1160 inscription at Po Nagar. The capital has been identified with the archaeological site at Cha Ban. The associated port was at present-day Qui Nhơn. Important excavations have also been conducted at nearby Tháp Mắm, which may have been a religious and cultural centre. Vijaya became the political and cultural center of Champa around the 1150s. It remained the center of Champa until 1471, when it was sacked by the Việt and the center of Champa was again displaced toward the south. In its time, the principality of Vijaya controlled much of present-day Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Bình Định, and Phú Yên (Aia Ru) Provinces.
* Kauthara was located in the area of modern Nha Trang (Aia Trang) in Khánh Hòa Province (Yanpunagara). Its religious and cultural center was the temple of Po Nagar, several towers of which still stand at Nha Trang. Kauthara is first mentioned in a 784 CE inscription at Po Nagar.
* Panduranga was located in the area of present-day Phan Rang–Tháp Chàm (Pan Rang) in Ninh Thuận and Bình Thuận province. The name &quot;Phan Rang&quot; originates from this principality. Its successor, Principality of Thuận Thành, was the last of the Cham territories to be annexed by the Vietnamese. Panduranga was the most autonomous, sometimes independent, princedom/principality of Champa. It is first mentioned in an 817 CE inscription at Po Nagar.

Within the four principalities were two main clans: the &quot;Dừa&quot; (means &quot;coconut&quot; in Vietnamese) and the &quot;Cau&quot; (means &quot;areca catechu&quot; in Vietnamese). The Dừa lived in Amravati and Vijaya, while the Cau lived in Kauthara and Panduranga. The two clans differed in their customs and habits and conflicting interests led to many clashes and even war. But they usually managed to settle disagreements through intermarriage.

==Religion==
Champa was a religiously tolerant kingdom, where many different faiths coexisted peacefully or merged with indigenous Cham beliefs. Religiously and culturally, the Chams were grouped into two major religio-cultural groups; the Balamon Chams (also called Cham Ahiér) that adhere to an indigenized form of Islam and Hinduism, and Bani Chams that adhere to an indigenized form of Islam. These two groups mostly live in separate villages. Intermarriage was prohibited in former times, and remains rare even nowadays. Both groups are matrilineal and conform to matrilocal residence practice. Both Cham groups&#x27; common ancestor worship is known as &quot;kut&quot;, characterized in the form of worshiping cemetery steles of dead ancestors. The Cham view the living world matters as just as transient one for a short-term existence, and eternity is the other world where ancestors, dead relatives and deities live.

Another northern group inhabiting around Bình Định and Phú Yên provinces is the Cham Hroi (Haroi), who practice Chamic animism. Under the previous Republic of Vietnam, they were considered a distinct ethnic group. Since 1979, they have been reclassified by the Socialist Republic of Vietnam government as a subgroup of the Cham.

=== Hinduism and Buddhism ===
The term &quot;Balamon&quot; derived from &quot;Brahman&quot; or &quot;Brahmin&quot;, one of Hindu caste of religious elite. Balamon Chams adhere to the old religion of their ancestor, an indigenized form of Hinduism that thrived since the ancient era of Kingdom of Champa in the 5th century CE. While today the Bacam (Bacham) are the only surviving Hindus in Vietnam, the region once hosted some of the most exquisite and vibrant Hindu cultures in the world. The entire region of Southeast Asia, in fact, was home to numerous sophisticated Hindu kingdoms. From Angkor in neighbouring Cambodia, to Java and Bali in Indonesia. The Cham Sunni in the Mekong Delta often refer the Balamon as &quot;Kafir&quot; (Derived from Arabic &quot;Kāfir&quot; for infidels).

Before the conquest of Champa by the Đại Việt ruler Le Thanh Tong in 1471, the dominant religion of the Cham upper class (&quot;Thar patao bamao maâh&quot;) was Hinduism, and the culture was heavily influenced by that of India. The commoners generally accepted Hindu influence, but they embedded it with much as possible indigenous Cham beliefs to become parts of the Ahier religion today. The Hinduism of Champa was overwhelmingly Shaiva and it was liberally combined with elements of local religious cults such as the worship of the Earth goddess Lady Po Nagar. The main symbols of Cham Shaivism were the lingam, the mukhalinga, the &quot;jaṭāliṅgam&quot;, the segmented &quot;liṅgam&quot;, and the &quot;kośa&quot;.
* A liṅga (or liṅgam) is black stone pillar that serves as a representation of Shiva. Cham kings frequently erected and dedicated stone lingas as the central religious images in royal temples. The name a Cham king would give to such a linga would be a composite of the king&#x27;s own name and suffix &quot;-iśvara&quot;, which stands for Shiva.
* A mukhaliṅga is a linga upon which has been painted or carved an image of Shiva as a human being or a human face.
* A jaṭāliṅga is a linga upon which has been engraved a stylised representation of Shiva&#x27;s chignon hairstyle.
* A segmented liṅga is a linga post divided into three sections to represent the three aspects of the Hindu godhead or trimurti: the lowest section, square in shape, represents Brahma; the middle section, octagonal in shape, represents Vishnu, and the top section, circular in shape, represents Shiva.
* A kośa is a cylindrical basket of precious metal used to cover a linga. The donation of a kośa to the decoration of a liṅga was a distinguishing characteristic of Cham Shaivism. Cham kings gave names to special kośas in much the way that they gave names to the liṅgas themselves.

The predominance of Hinduism in Cham religion was interrupted for a time in the 9th and 10th centuries CE, when a dynasty at Indrapura (modern Đồng Dương, Quảng Nam Province, Vietnam) adopted Mahayana Buddhism as its faith. King Indravarman II (r. 854–893) built a giant Buddhist monastery, meditation halls, and temples for Champa&#x27;s monks (Sangha), and celebrated the veneration of the Buddhist deity Lokeśvara under the name Laksmindra Lokeśvara Svabhayada in 875. Mahayana in Champa was blended with observable elements of Tantric Buddhism, manifesting in many traces. For example, Indravarman&#x27;s successor Jaya Simhavarman I (r. 897–904) according to his verbatim in 902, Vajrapāṇi is the Bodhisattva capable of leading humans into the &quot;path of the Vajra.&quot; The Buddhist art of Đồng Dương has received special acclaim for its originality.

Buddhist art of Champa also shared the same unique aesthetics, paralleling with Dvāravatī (Mon) art, highlighting in the similarities of both cultures in their iconographic form of the Buddha-Stūpa-Triad, where the Buddha seats in padmāsana (lotus) flanked by on either side by a depiction of a stūpa. Other shared features are makara lintel, fishtail-shaped sampot illustrating, Gaja-Lakṣmī, pendant-legged Buddhas. The sources of Mon–Cham cultural interaction may be the inland routes between the Muang Fa Daed site on Khorat region, near a lost kingdom called Wèndān by the Chinese (probably the site of Kantarawichai in Kantharawichai, Maha Sarakham), Southern Laos, via Savannakhet, then to Central Vietnam coast through Lao Bảo and Mụ Giạ Passes.

Beginning in the 10th century CE, Hinduism again became the predominant religion of Champa. Some of the sites that have yielded important works of religious art and architecture from this period are, aside from Mỹ Sơn, Khương Mỹ, Trà Kiệu, Chanh Lo, and Tháp Mắm.

From the 13th to 15th centuries, Mahayana among the Cham was practiced in form of syncretic Saivite–Buddhism or the fusion of the worship of Śiva (seen as the protector) and Buddha (seen as the savior). Buddhism prevailed secondary. With the decline of royal power of the ruling Simhavarmanid dynasty in the 15th century and the fall of their capital Vijaya in 1471, all Mahayana or Vajrayana traces of Champa disappeared, enabling space for the rising Islamic faith.

===Islam===

Bani Chams or Bani Awal are Cham Muslims in Central Vietnam that converted to a version of localized Shi&#x27;a Islam mixed with Hindu-Chamic customs, as the faith started making headway among the population after the 10th century CE. The term &quot;Bani&quot; derived from Arabic term &quot;bani&quot; (بني) which means &quot;people&quot;. The popular account mainly from oversea Cham communities assures that the Cham had been converted by either ʿAlī and his son Muḥammad ibn al-Ḥanafīyya. Al-Dimashqi claimed a story that the Alīds after being expelled, a small group of them took refugee in Champa; these Muslim immigrants therefore spread Shi&#x27;a among the Cham, which perhaps eventually led to the synthesis of the Bani Awal religion. In their devotions, the Cham Bani refer to Adam and Eve, the archangel Gabriel, Abraham, the prophet Muhammad, ʿAlī, Fāṭima, Ḥasan and Ḥusayn. They have religious organization dominated by a class of dignitaries who always wear white tunics, the pious colour of Islam, Quranic books with Cham commentaries, and simple mosques. However their Imams bear Cham-Sanskrit titles &quot;gru&quot; and &quot;acar&quot;. By the 17th century, the royal families of Champa had converted to Bani Islam. The Ahiér is particularly more than strange as they adhere to a hypersyncretic Islam-Balamon-Cham religion. Ahier, meaning later, implies that the Cham Ahier were people who converted to Islam in the 16th to 17th centuries, after the Bani Awal. Ahier and Bani Awal communities have blended Shi&#x27;a Islam, Balamon, with their own customs to the point that sectarian distinction no longer makes sense. For example, Allah is usually written as &quot;Po Uvalvah&quot;, and prophet Muhammad, which the Cham Bani refer as &quot;Po Rasulak&quot; was morphed into one of many important Cham deities. Most Cham are now evenly split between being followers of Islam and Hinduism, with the majority of Central Vietnam Cham being Ahier and Bani, while the majority of Cambodian Chams and Mekong Delta Chams are Sunni Muslim (also called Cham Baruw, meaning &quot;new Cham&quot;), though significant minorities of Mahayana Buddhists continue to exist.

Historical documents regarded that 18th-century Cham and Malay Sunni settlements in the Mekong Delta established by the Nguyen lords earlier than Vietnamese settlements in order to establish Viet-controlled settlements for frontier defense. The embodiment of more fundamentalist Sunni faiths in the Mekong Delta and Cambodia gave the Cham communities here socio-cultural inclinations toward the wider Malay/Islamic world compared with the fairly isolated Cham Bani in Central Vietnam. Islam also instigated certain ethno-religious values to the Mekong Delta Cham, which help them preserve and retain their distinct ethnic identity in a dynamic transnational environment.

Kelantanese Muslim preachers or imams sailed to Champa shores not long after the fall of Vijaya to teach their school among the local community, academic ties there were also established leading to long-lasting exchange of teachers between both regions over the centuries; certain placenames in Kelantan like Pengkalan Chepa (lit. &#x27;Champa Landing&#x27;) reflect this fact. Indonesian 15th-century records indicate that Princess Daravati, of Cham origin, converted to Islam, and influenced her husband, Kertawijaya, Majapahit&#x27;s seventh ruler to convert the Majapahit royal family to Islam. The Islamic tomb of &quot;Putri Champa&quot; (Princess of Champa) can be found in Trowulan, East Java, the site of the Majapahit imperial capital. In the 15th to 17th century, Islamic Champa had maintained a cordial relationship with the Aceh Sultanate through dynastic marriage. This sultanate was located on the northern tip of Sumatra and was an active promoter of the Islamic faith in the Indonesian archipelago.

The lunisolar Cham Sawaki calendar is an amalgamation of the Islamic and traditional Cham calendars, which was based on the Indian Śaka era. A normal year in Sawaki consists of 354 days with 12 months; the average length of each month is either 29 or 30 days. The calendar has a 12-year cycle of zodiac called &quot;Nâthak.&quot; It sets three leap years for every eight years, compared to 11 leap years for every 30 years of the orthodox Islamic calendar.

==Economy==

Unlike many contemporaneous mainland Southeast Asian kingdoms, Champa&#x27;s economy was not a heavily agrarian one. The 14th-century Franciscan traveler Odoric of Pordenone who had visited the nation in 1324–25 describes the diet of medieval Champa commoners mainly composed of rice and fish/seafood products. As a seafaring people, the Cham were highly itinerant and established a network of trade including not only the major ports at Hội An, Thị Nại but also extending into the mountainous hinterland. Maritime trade was facilitated by a network of wells that provided fresh water to Cham and foreign ships along the coast of Champa and the islands of Cù Lao Chàm and Lý Sơn. While Kenneth R. Hall suggests that Champa was not able to rely on taxes on trade for stable revenue, but instead financed their rule by raiding neighboring countries and seabustering merchant ships, Hardy argues that the country&#x27;s prosperity was above all based on commerce.

The vast majority of Champa&#x27;s export products, mostly medieval commodities, came from the mountainous hinterland, sourced from as far as Attapeu in southern Laos. They included gold and silver, slaves, animal and animal products, and precious woods. Cham pottery, characterized by distinct olive-green and brown glazes, were primary produced by the kilns of Gò Sành, just in the suburbs of Vijaya. Cham ceramic production peaked around the 14th to 16th century, and have been reported to be discovered in present-day Egypt, the UAE, Malaysia, and the Philippines.

By far the most important export product was eaglewood. It was the only product mentioned in Marco Polo&#x27;s brief account and similarly impressed the Arab trader Sulayman several centuries earlier. Most of it was probably taken from the Aquilaria crassna tree, just as most of the eaglewood in Vietnam today. The largest amount of eaglewood products extracted from the highland of Champa occurred in 1155, when Cham envoy reportedly shipped 55,020 catties (around 33 tons) of incense &quot;of Wuli&quot; to the Song court as trade tribute.

===Cham port-cities===

During the medieval age, the Champa Kingdom benefited greatly from the luxurious maritime trade routes through the South China Sea and overland trade networks connecting Angkor and Bagan to Champa. Urbanization in Champa took place progressively from the 1st to 8th centuries CE, from the late Sahuynhian to the early Champa period. Champa concentrated its wealth in highly urbanized port-cities, some of them located in self-governing regions. The earliest of those was Simhapura, emerged as a riverine port-city and Cham political center around 400 CE. Prominent examples include Amarendrapura (the modern city of Huế); Visnupura (Nhan Bieu, Quảng Trị) and Vrddha Ratnapura (Ðại Hữu, Quảng Bình) in the north; Indrapura and Amavarati (Quang Nam); Vijaya (Qui Nhon) in the central region; and Nha Trang, Virapura (near Phan Rang), and Panduranga in the south. These cosmopolitan cities were loaded with surplus amount of trading goods and exotic products, overcrowded by merchants not just from other Cham states, but also Chinese, Khmer, Malay, Viet, Arab, and Indian traders and travelers.

The &quot;Zhu Fan Zhi&quot; describes the port cities of Champa, &#x27;on the arrival of a trading ship in this country, officials are sent on board with a book made of folded slips of black leather.&#x27; After an inventory has been taken, the cargo may be landed. 20% of the goods carried on is claimed as tax, and the rest may be traded privately. If they discovered that &#x27;any items were hidden away during the customs check, the whole cargo will be confiscated.&#x27;
When French scholars arrived in the mid-19th century, they were impressed with Cham ruins, Cham urbanism, and medieval networks throughout the former kingdom. The middle-age densely populated areas of Tra Kieu and My Son were well connected by paved stone roads, bridges, urban ruins that were 16 feet high, rampart and stone citadel in a rectangle shape of 984 feet by 1640 feet, which hosted temples, fortified palaces, and resident structures, and were supplied by canals, irrigation projects, underground aqueducts and wells.

From the 4th to 15th century, these cities were relatively wealthy. Foreign traders and travelers from across medieval Eurasia were well-aware of Champa&#x27;s richness and eyewitnessed the crowded, prosperous Cham port-cities. Abu&#x27;l-Faradj described the city of Indrapura &quot;this temple is ancient that all the Buddhas found there enter into conversation with the faithful and reply to all the requests made to them.&quot; Columbus during his fourth voyage in 1502 along the coast of Central America, in accordance with contemporary knowledge that confused Central America with eastern Asia, thought that he had reached the kingdom of &quot;Ciampa&quot; visited by Marco Polo in 1290. Peter Martyr d&#x27;Anghiera recorded in &quot;De Orbe Novo Decades&quot; that on his fourth voyage in 1502, Columbus: &quot;found a vast territory called Quiriquetana [ Quiriguá] in the language of the inhabitants, but he called it Ciamba (Champa)&quot;. Portuguese travelers in the early 16th century, such as Fernão Mendes Pinto, reported vestiges of these cities &quot;a town of above ten thousand households&quot; which &quot;encircled by a strong wall of brick, towers, and bulwarks.&quot; Because of this, Champa was the target of multiple warring powers surrounding: the Chinese in 4th century-605 CE; the Javanese in 774 and 787, the Vietnamese in 982, 1044, 1069, 1073, 1446, and 1471; the Khmer in 945–950, 1074, 1126–1128, 1139–1150, 1190–1220; and the Mongol Yuan in 1283–85, many cities were ransacked by invaders and rebuilt or repaired over time. They also had to face constant threats from hazards per annum such as flood, tropical cyclones, fire. Some Cham port-cities later ended up captured by Vietnamese in the mid-15th century, which later resulted in the rise of Nguyễn domain depending on these port-cities, whom benefited international trades, and was well-balanced enough to fend off several northern Trịnh invasions in the 17th century.

==Role of women==

Women enjoy far greater freedom and important role in Cham history and society compared to neighboring and Islamic cultures generally. Prior 1975, Cham communities in Central Vietnam, Bani Muslim and Ahier, still upheld the practice of matrilineality in family relationship. Bani priests symbolize women while Ahier priests represent for male. Yoshimoto suggests the Bani Awal-Ahier binary indicates the notion of symbolic dualism between male and female, husband and wife. Women take major roles in every aspects of Cham society. Neither a gender hierarchy and restriction exists. Religious attendance at thang magik (Bani mosque) during the Ramawan month are mostly accomplished by women from every household.

The 4th century Vo Canh inscription denotes the existence of matrilineage of early Cham rulers. Another prominent example of Cham matrilinealism in royal succession was King Rudravarman I of the Gangaraja dynasty. Rudravarman was the son of Manorathavarman&#x27;s niece.

Female gods constitute the majority of divinities in Cham historical legends. The most sacred Goddess of the Cham people is Lady Po Nagar, a mythical princess who was said to be the founder of Champa. &quot;Po Dava,&quot; the Cham God of Virginity, is the symbol of learning and literature. She is worshipped at the Po Nagar Hamu Tanran temple in Panduranga.

According to the legend of Po Klong Garai, Princess &quot;Po Sah Inö&quot; was the mother of Po Klong Garai. She was born of sea foam scrubbings. When she grew up, she drank water from a spring, and magically got pregnant. In one day, her scabby son encountered a dragon who then healed him and predicted that he should become king. The boy, Po Klong Garai, then acquired supernatural powers. The chief of royal astronomy ought to ask Po Klong Garai to marry his daughter. Po Klong Garai then became king, destroying the Cambodian invaders, bringing peace and prosperity to the Kingdom of Champa. To commemorate the legendary hero, in 1242 the future King Jaya Simhavarman III (r. 1288–1307) offered the construction of the Po Klong Garai Temple at Phan Rang.

===Museums===

The largest collection of Cham sculpture may be found in the Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture (formerly known as &quot;Musée Henri Parmentier&quot;) in the coastal city of Da Nang. The museum was established in 1915 by French scholars, and is regarded as one of the most beautiful in Southeast Asia. Many Cham sculptures and valuable artifacts were destroyed during the Vietnam War due to bombing, others were either illegally looted or smuggled by private collectors, most famously Douglas Latchford, whose collections are now under investigation by the US Justice Department.

==Cham influences on Vietnamese culture==

Throughout history, Champa and the Cham were viewed by premodern Vietnamese literati and upper-class aristocrats as barbaric, uncivilized, and often described in disgusting senses, with several Vietnamese rulers pushed assimilationist policies and attempts to eradicate the Cham culture rather than incorporating it into Vietnamese.

Despite that, according to modern Vietnamese historians, although Champa was absorbed by the Vietnamese, who in turn were influenced by it. In 1044, after raiding Champa, Vietnamese emperor Lý Thái Tông took some 5,000 prisoners, and brought back to Đại Việt a number of court dancers familiar with Indian-style dances, settling to them in a palace specifically built for them. Both Lý Thái Tông and his son Lý Thánh Tông had a great appreciation for Cham music, and in 1060 Lý Thái Tông ordered his court musicians to study the Cham drum rhythms along with Cham songs he himself had translated into Vietnamese. According to some Vietnamese scholars, the Vietnamese cult of Princess Liễu Hạnh might have been influenced by Cham deity Yang Pu Inu Nagara (Lady Po Nagar).

Even the Vietnamese &quot;Quan họ&quot; music and &quot;Lục bát&quot; (six-eight) poetry could have been influenced by Cham poetry and folk music.

Cham art also spread far across the Red River Delta, where many Vietnamese Buddhist temples hosted Cham-style statues of dragons, lions, &quot;nāgá,&quot; &quot;makara&quot;, kinnari, Brahma and Hamsa dated back to the 11th–13th century (however, since these creatures also existed in China, it was more likely Chinese influence and not Champa). Thousand of bricks inscribed with Cham script indicate that a multitude of Vietnamese temples and holy sites were built by Cham engineers. A Buddhist stone stupa of Dạm tempe in Bắc Ninh Province, built by Vietnamese emperor Lý Nhân Tông in 1086, is a representation of a lingam and its yoni (a Hindu-Cham symbol of fertility and the power of creation).

In 1693, after lord Nguyễn Phúc Chu&#x27;s take over of Panduranga, the Cham were forced to wear regulated Vietnamese attire, at least the members of the ruling Mâh Taha dynasty, Cham king Po Saktiraydapatih, and Cham court officials.

== Legacy ==
According to French researcher and ethnologist Denys Lombard, &quot;Champa is not only the name of a former kingdom but it is also of a vast network that extended all over the main Southeast Asian centers&quot;. For nearly 1,500 years, the Cham and their diaspora communities had developed and maintained a vast and complex overland and maritime system of networks, not just around modern-day Vietnam, but also extended throughout Mainland and Maritime Southeast Asia. These networks, served not only for trade, but also for connecting peoples, transporting culture, ideas, and religious identities across the region, enduring endless historical possibilities and mutual relationships, significantly helping most of Southeast Asia to transform into their present-day.

Cham culture influenced nearby communities and tamed most of present-day Vietnam and surrounding areas. Despite being formed from one of the least coherent places on Earth, Champa was a formidable seafaring kingdom that outlasted most empires. The Cham today, one of the few microcosms in Southeast Asia that still maintain strong links with neighboring countries in the region while still retaining their distinct ethnic identity.

Modern Vietnamese perceptions of Champa and its legacy are varying. Today, the Cham are seen as one minority group within the unnoticeable multi-ethnic Vietnam, and their legacy is incorporated into the Vietnamese national heritage.

<text>A Juris Doctor, Doctor of Jurisprudence, or Doctor of Law (JD) is a graduate-entry professional degree that primarily prepares individuals to practice law. In the United States, it is the only qualifying law degree. Other jurisdictions, such as Australia, Canada, and Hong Kong, offer both the postgraduate JD degree as well as the undergraduate LL.B., BCL, or other qualifying law degree depending on the requirements of the jurisdiction where the person will practice law.

Originating in the United States in the late 19th century, the JD is the most common law degree in the country. The degree generally requires three years of full-time study to complete and is conferred upon students who have successfully completed coursework and practical training in legal studies. The JD curriculum typically includes fundamental legal subjects such as constitutional law, civil procedure, criminal law, contracts, property, and torts, along with opportunities for specialization in areas like international law, corporate law, or public policy. Upon receiving a JD, graduates must pass a bar examination to be licensed to practice law. The American Bar Association does not allow an accredited JD degree to be issued in less than two years of law school studies.

In the United States, the JD has the academic standing of a professional doctorate (in contrast to a research doctorate), and is described as a &quot;doctor&#x27;s degree – professional practice&quot; by the United States Department of Education&#x27;s National Center for Education Statistics. In Australia, South Korea, and Hong Kong, it has the academic standing of a master&#x27;s degree, while in Canada, it is considered a second-entry bachelor&#x27;s degree.

To be fully authorized to practice law in the courts of a given state in the United States, the majority of individuals holding a JD degree must pass a bar examination, except from the state of Wisconsin. The United States Patent and Trademark Office also involves a specialized &quot;Patent Bar&quot; which requires applicants to hold a bachelor&#x27;s degree or the equivalent in certain scientific or engineering fields alongside their Juris Doctor degree in order to practice in patent cases —prosecuting patent applications — before it. This additional requirement does not apply to the litigation of patent-related matters in state and federal courts.

==Etymology and abbreviations==
In the United States, the professional doctorate in law may be conferred in Latin or in English as &quot;Juris Doctor&quot; (sometimes shown on Latin diplomas in the accusative form &quot;Juris Doctorem&quot;) and at some law schools Doctor of Law (JD), or Doctor of Jurisprudence (also abbreviated JD). &quot;Juris Doctor&quot; literally means &quot;teacher of law&quot;, while the Latin for &quot;Doctor of Jurisprudence&quot; – &quot;Jurisprudentiae Doctor&quot; – literally means &quot;teacher of legal knowledge&quot;.

The JD is not to be confused with Doctor of Laws or &quot;Legum Doctor&quot; (LLD). In institutions where the latter can be earned, e.g., Cambridge University (where it is titled &quot;Doctor of Law&quot;, though still retaining the abbreviation LLD) and many other British institutions, it is a higher research doctorate, representing a substantial contribution to the field over many years – a standard of professional experience beyond that required for a Doctor of Philosophy. In the United States, the LLD is invariably an honorary degree.

==Historical context==

===Origins of the law degree===
The first university in Europe, the University of Bologna, was founded as a school of law by four famous legal scholars in the 11th century who were students of the glossator school in that city. This served as the model for other law schools of the Middle Ages, and other early universities such as the University of Padua. The first academic degrees may have been doctorates in civil law (&quot;doctores legum&quot;) followed by canon law (&quot;doctores decretorum&quot;); these were not professional degrees but rather indicated that their holders had been approved to teach at the universities. While Bologna granted only doctorates, preparatory degrees (bachelor&#x27;s and licences) were introduced in Paris and then in the English universities.

===History of legal training in England===
The nature of the JD can be better understood by a review of the context of the history of legal education in England. The teaching of law at Cambridge and Oxford Universities was mainly for philosophical or scholarly purposes and not meant to prepare one to practice law. The universities only taught civil and canon law (used in a very few jurisdictions, such as the courts of admiralty and church courts) but not the common law that applied in most jurisdictions. Professional training for practicing common law in England was undertaken at the Inns of Court, but over time the training functions of the Inns lessened considerably and apprenticeships with individual practitioners arose as the prominent medium of preparation. However, because of the lack of standardization of study, and of objective standards for appraisal of these apprenticeships, the role of universities became subsequently important for the education of lawyers in the English-speaking world.

In England in 1292 when Edward I first requested that lawyers be trained, students merely sat in the courts and observed, but over time the students would hire professionals to lecture them in their residences, which led to the institution of the Inns of Court system. The original method of education at the Inns of Court was a mix of moot court-like practice and lecture, as well as court proceedings observation. By the fifteenth century, the Inns functioned like a university, akin to the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, though very specialized in purpose. With the frequent absence of parties to suits during the Crusades, the importance of the lawyer role grew tremendously, and the demand for lawyers grew.

Traditionally Oxford and Cambridge did not see common law as worthy of academic study, and included coursework in law only in the context of canon and civil law (the two &quot;laws&quot; in the original Bachelor of Laws, which thus became the Bachelor of Civil Law when the study of canon law was barred after the Reformation) and for the purpose of the study of philosophy or history only. As a consequence of the need for practical education in law, the apprenticeship program for solicitors emerged, structured and governed by the same rules as the apprenticeship programs for the trades. The training of solicitors by a five-year apprenticeship was formally established by the Attorneys and Solicitors Act 1728. William Blackstone became the first lecturer in English common law at the University of Oxford in 1753, but the university did not establish the program for the purpose of professional study, and the lectures were very philosophical and theoretical in nature. Blackstone insisted that the study of law should be university based, where concentration on foundational principles can be had, instead of concentration on detail and procedure provided by apprenticeship and the Inns of Court.

The 1728 act was amended in 1821 to reduce the period of the required apprenticeship to three years for graduates in either law or arts from Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin, as &quot;the admission of such graduates should be facilitated, in consideration of the learning and abilities requisite for taking such degree&quot;. This was extended in 1837 to cover the newly established universities of Durham and London, and again in 1851 to include the new Queen&#x27;s University of Ireland.

The Inns of Court continued but became less effective, and admission to the bar still did not require any significant educational activity or examination. In 1846, Parliament examined the education and training of prospective barristers and found the system to be inferior to that of Europe and the United States, as Britain did not regulate the admission of barristers. Therefore, formal schools of law were called for but were not finally established until later in the century, and even then the bar did not consider a university degree in admission decisions.

Until the mid nineteenth century, most law degrees in England (the BCL at Oxford and Durham, and the LLB at London) were postgraduate degrees, taken after an initial degree in arts. The Cambridge degree, variously referred to as a BCL, BL or LLB, was an exception: it took six years from matriculation to complete, but only three of these had to be in residence, and the BA was not required (although those not holding a BA had to produce a certificate to prove they had not only been in residence but had actually attended lectures for at least three terms). These degrees specialized in Roman civil law rather than in English common law, the latter being the domain of the Inns of Court, and thus they were more theoretical than practically useful. Cambridge reestablished its LLB degree in 1858 as an undergraduate course alongside the BA, and the London LLB, which had previously required a minimum of one year after the BA, become an undergraduate degree in 1866. The older nomenclature continues to be used for the BCL at Oxford today, which is a master&#x27;s level program, while Cambridge moved its LLB back to being a postgraduate degree in 1922 but only renamed it as the LLM in 1982.

Between the 1960s and the 1990s, law schools in England took on a more central role in the preparation of lawyers and consequently improved their coverage of advanced legal topics to become more professionally relevant. Over the same period, American law schools became more scholarly and less professionally oriented, so that in 1996 Langbein could write: &quot;That contrast between English law schools as temples of scholarship and American law schools as training centers for the profession no longer bears the remotest relation to reality&quot;.

===Legal training in colonial North America and 19th-century United States===

Initially there was much resistance to lawyers in colonial North America because of the role they had played in hierarchical England, but slowly the colonial governments started using the services of professionals trained in the Inns of Court in London, and by the end of the American Revolution there was a functional bar in each state. Due to an initial distrust of a profession open only to the elite in England, as institutions for training developed in what would become the United States they emerged as quite different from those in England.

Initially in the United States the legal professionals were trained and imported from England. A formal apprenticeship or clerkship program was established first in New York in 1730 — at that time a seven-year clerkship was required, and in 1756 a four-year college degree was required in addition to five years of clerking and an examination. Later the requirements were reduced to require only two years of college education. But a system like the Inns did not develop, and a college education was not required in England until the 19th century, so this system was unique.

The clerkship program required much individual study and the mentoring lawyer was expected to carefully select materials for study and guide the clerk in his study of the law and ensure that it was being absorbed. The student was supposed to compile his notes of his reading of the law into a &quot;commonplace book&quot;, which he would try to memorize. Although those were the ideals, in reality the clerks were often overworked and rarely were able to study the law individually as expected. They were often employed to tedious tasks, such as making handwritten copies of documents. Finding sufficient legal texts was also a seriously debilitating issue, and there was no standardization in the books assigned to the clerk trainees because they were assigned by their mentor, whose opinion of the law may have differed greatly from his peers.

It was said by one famous attorney in the United States, William Livingston, in 1745 in a New York newspaper that the clerkship program was severely flawed, and that most mentors
: &quot;have no manner of concern for their clerk&#x27;s future welfare ... [T]is a monstrous absurdity to suppose, that the law is to be learnt by a perpetual copying of precedents&quot;.
There were some few mentors that were dedicated to the service, and because of their rarity, they became so sought-after that the first law schools evolved from the offices of some of these attorneys, who took on many clerks and began to spend more time training than practicing law.

In time, the apprenticeship program was not considered sufficient to produce lawyers fully capable of serving their clients&#x27; needs. The apprenticeship programs often employed the trainee with menial tasks, and while they were well trained in the day-to-day operations of a law office, they were generally unprepared practitioners or legal reasoners. The establishment of formal faculties of law in United States universities did not occur until the latter part of the 18th century. With the beginning of the American Revolution, the supply of lawyers from Britain ended. The first law degree granted by a United States university was a Bachelor of Law in 1793 by the College of William and Mary, which was abbreviated L.B.; Harvard was the first university to use the LLB abbreviation in the United States.

The first university law programs in the United States, such as that of the University of Maryland established in 1812, included much theoretical and philosophical study, including works such as the Bible, Cicero, Seneca, Aristotle, Adam Smith, Montesquieu and Grotius. It has been said that the early university law schools of the early 19th century seemed to be preparing students for careers as statesmen rather than as lawyers. At the LLB programs in the early 1900s at Stanford University and Yale continued to include &quot;cultural study&quot;, which included courses in languages, mathematics and economics. An LLB, or a Bachelor of Laws, recognized that a prior bachelor&#x27;s degree was not required to earn an LLB.

In the 1850s there were many proprietary schools which originated from a practitioner taking on multiple apprentices and establishing a school and which provided a practical legal education, as opposed to the one offered in the universities which offered an education in the theory, history and philosophy of law. The universities assumed that the acquisition of skills would happen in practice, while the proprietary schools concentrated on the practical skills during education.

====Revolutionary approach: scientific study of law====

In part to compete with the small professional law schools, there began a great change in United States university legal education. For a short time beginning in 1826 Yale began to offer a complete &quot;practitioners&#x27; course&quot; which lasted two years and included practical courses, such as pleading drafting. United States Supreme Court justice Joseph Story started the spirit of change in legal education at Harvard, when he advocated a more &quot;scientific study&quot; of the law in the 19th century. At the time he was a lecturer at Harvard. Therefore, at Harvard the education was much of a trade school type of approach to legal education, contrary to the more liberal arts education advocated by Blackstone at Oxford and Jefferson at William and Mary. Nonetheless, there continued to be debate among educators over whether legal education should be more vocational, as at the private law schools, or through a rigorous scientific method, such as that developed by Story and Langdell. In the words of Dorsey Ellis, &quot;Langdell viewed law as a science and the law library as the laboratory, with the cases providing the basis for learning those &#x27;principles or doctrines&#x27; of which law, considered as a science, consists. Nonetheless, into the year 1900, most states did not require a university education (although an apprenticeship was often required) and most practitioners had not attended any law school or college.

Therefore, the modern legal education system in the United States is a combination of teaching law as a science and a practical skill, implementing elements such as clinical training, which has become an essential part of legal education in the United States and in the JD program of study.

==Creation of the JD and major common law approaches to legal education==
The JD originated in the United States during a movement to improve training of the professions. Prior to the origination of the JD, law students began law school either with only a high school diploma, or less than the amount of undergraduate study required to earn a bachelor&#x27;s degree. The LLB persisted through the middle of the 20th century, which by then turned into a postgraduate degree requiring the previous completion of a bachelor&#x27;s degree as a pre-requisite for virtually all students entering law school, it became a bachelor&#x27;s degree in name only. The didactic approaches that resulted were revolutionary for university education and have slowly been implemented outside the United States, but only recently (since about 1997) and in stages. The degrees which resulted from this new approach, such as the MD and the JD, are just as different from their European counterparts as the educational approaches differ.

===Legal education in the United States===
Professional doctorates were developed in the United States in the 19th century, the first being the Doctor of Medicine in 1807, but at the time, the legal system in the United States was still in development as the educational institutions were developing, and the status of the legal profession was at that time still ambiguous and so the professional law degree took more time to develop. Even when some universities offered training in law, they did not offer a degree. Because in the United States there were no Inns of Court, and the English academic degrees did not provide the necessary professional training, the models from England were inapplicable, and the degree program took some time to develop.

At first the degree took the form of a B.L. (such as at the College of William and Mary), but then Harvard, keen on importing legitimacy through the trappings of Oxford and Cambridge, implemented an LLB degree. The decision to award a bachelor&#x27;s degree for law could be due to the fact that admittance to most nineteenth-century American law schools required only satisfactory completion of high school. The degree was nevertheless somewhat controversial at the time because it was a professional training without any of the cultural or classical studies required of a degree in England, where it was necessary to gain a general BA prior to an LLB or BCL until the nineteenth century. Thus, even though the name of the English LLB degree was implemented at Harvard, the program in the United States was nonetheless intended as a first degree which, unlike the English B.A., gave practical or professional training in law.

====Creation of the Juris Doctor====

In the mid-19th century there was much concern about the quality of legal education in the United States. C.C. Langdell served as dean of Harvard Law School from 1870 to 1895, and dedicated his life to reforming legal education in the United States. The historian Robert Stevens wrote that &quot;it was Langdell&#x27;s goal to turn the legal profession into a university educated one — and not at the undergraduate level, but through a three-year post baccalaureate degree.&quot; This graduate level study would allow the intensive legal training that Langdell had developed, known as the case method (a method of studying landmark cases) and the Socratic method (a method of examining students on the reasoning of the court in the cases studied). Therefore, a graduate, high-level law degree was proposed: the Juris Doctor, implementing the case and Socratic methods as its didactic approach. According to professor J. H. Beale, an 1882 Harvard Law graduate, one of the main arguments for the change was uniformity. Harvard&#x27;s four professional schools – theology, law, medicine, and arts and sciences – were all graduate schools, and their degrees were therefore a second degree. Two of them conferred a doctorate and the other two a baccalaureate degree. The change from LLB to JD was intended to end &quot;this discrimination, the practice of conferring what is normally a first degree upon persons who have already their primary degree&quot;. The JD was proposed as the equivalent of the German J.U.D., to reflect the advanced study required to be an effective lawyer.

The University of Chicago Law School was the first to offer the JD in 1902, when it was just one of five law schools that demanded a college degree from its applicants. While approval was still pending at Harvard, the degree was introduced at many other law schools, including at the law schools at NYU, Berkeley, Michigan, and Stanford. Because of tradition, and concerns about less prominent universities implementing a JD program, prominent eastern law schools like those of Harvard, Yale, and Columbia refused to implement the degree. Harvard, for example, refused to adopt the JD degree, even though it restricted admission to students with college degrees in 1909. Indeed, pressure from eastern law schools led almost every law school (except at the University of Chicago and other law schools in Illinois) to abandon the JD and re‑adopt the LLB as the first law degree by the 1930s. By 1962, the JD degree was rarely seen outside the Midwest.

After the 1930s, the LLB and the JD degrees co‑existed in some American law schools. Some law schools, especially in Illinois and the Midwest, awarded both (like Marquette University, beginning in 1926), conferring JD degrees only to those with a bachelor&#x27;s degree (as opposed to two or three years of college before law school), and those who met a higher academic standard in undergraduate studies, finishing a thesis in their third year of law school. Because the JD degree was no more advantageous for bar admissions or for employment, the vast majority of Marquette students preferred to seek the LLB degree.

As more law students entered law schools with previously awarded bachelor&#x27;s degree degrees in the 1950s and 1960s, a number of law schools may have introduced the JD to encourage law students to complete their undergraduate degrees. As late as 1961, there were still 15 ABA-accredited law schools in the United States which awarded both LLB and JD degrees. Thirteen of the 15 were located in the Midwest, which may indicate regional variations in the United States.

It was only after 1962 that a new push — this time begun at less-prominent law schools — successfully led to the universal adoption of the JD as the first law degree. The turning point appears to have occurred when the ABA Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar unanimously adopted a resolution recommending to all approved law schools that they give favorable consideration to the conferring of the JD degree as the first professional degree, in 1962 and 1963. By the 1960s, most law students were college graduates having previously obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree, and by the end of that decade, almost all were required to be. Student and alumni support were key in the LLB-to-JD change, and even the most prominent schools were convinced to make the change: Columbia and Harvard in 1969, and Yale (last) in 1971. Nonetheless, the LLB at Yale retained the didactical changes of the &quot;practitioners&#x27; courses&quot; of 1826, and was very different from the LLB in common law countries, other than Canada.

Following standard modern academic practice, Harvard Law School refers to its Master of Laws and Doctor of Juridical Science degrees as its graduate level law degrees. Similarly, Columbia refers to the LLM and the JSD as its graduate program. Yale Law School lists its LLM, MSL, JSD, and Ph.D. as constituting graduate programs. A distinction thus remains between professional and graduate law degrees at some universities in the United States.

===Major common law approaches===

The English legal system is the root of the systems of other common-law countries, such as the United States. Originally, common lawyers in England were trained exclusively in the Inns of Court. Even though it took nearly 150 years since common law education began with Blackstone at Oxford for university education to be part of legal training in England and Wales, the LLB eventually became the degree usually taken before becoming a lawyer. In England and Wales the LLB is an undergraduate scholarly program and although it (assuming it is a qualifying law degree) fulfills the academic requirements for becoming a lawyer, further vocational and professional training as either a barrister (the Bar Professional Training Course followed by pupillage) or as a solicitor (the Legal Practice Course followed by a &quot;period of recognised training&quot;) is required before becoming licensed in that jurisdiction. The qualifying law degree in most English universities is the LLB although in some, including Oxford and Cambridge, it is the BA in law. Both of these can be taken with &quot;senior status&quot; in two years by those already holding an undergraduate degree in another discipline. A few universities offer &quot;exempting&quot; degrees, usually integrated master&#x27;s degrees denominated Master in Law (MLaw), that combine the qualifying law degree with the legal practice course or the bar professional training course in a four-year, undergraduate-entry program.

Legal education in Canada has unique variations from other Commonwealth countries. Even though the legal system of Canada is mostly a transplant of the English system (Quebec excepted), the Canadian system is unique in that there are no Inns of Court, the practical training occurs in the office of a barrister and solicitor with law society membership, and, since 1889, a university degree has been a prerequisite to initiating an articling clerkship. The education in law schools in Canada was similar to that in the United States at the turn of the 20th century, but with a greater concentration on statutory drafting and interpretation, and elements of a liberal education. The bar associations in Canada were influenced by the changes at Harvard, and were sometimes quicker to nationally implement the changes proposed in the United States, such as requiring previous college education before studying law.

==Modern variants and curriculum==
Legal education is rooted in the history and structure of the legal system of the jurisdiction where the education is given; therefore, law degrees are vastly different from country to country, making comparisons among degrees problematic. This has proven true in the context of the various forms of the JD which have been implemented around the world.

===Types and characteristics===

====Standard &quot;Juris Doctor&quot; curriculum====
As stated by Hall and Langdell, who were involved in the creation of the JD, the JD is a professional degree like the MD, intended to prepare practitioners through a scientific approach of analysing and teaching the law through logic and adversarial analysis (such as the casebook and Socratic methods). This system of curriculum has existed in the United States for over 100 years. The JD program generally requires a bachelor&#x27;s degree for entry, though this requirement is sometimes waived.

As a study of the substantive law and its professional applications, the JD curriculum has not changed substantially since its creation. As a professional degree, JD programs typically allow practitioners. It requires at least three academic years of full-time study. While the JD is a doctoral degree in the US, lawyers usually use the suffix &quot;Esq.&quot; as opposed to the prefix &quot;Dr.&quot;, and that only in a professional context, when needed to alert others that they are a biased party – acting as an agent for their client.

====Replacement for the LLB====
An initial attempt to rename the LLB to the JD in the US in the early 20th century started with a petition at Harvard in 1902. This was rejected, but the idea took hold at the new law school established at the University of Chicago and other universities. By 1925, 80% of US law schools awarded the JD to students who had entered the program with an undergraduate degree, while granting undergraduate entrants the LLB. The change was initially rejected by the leading law schools of the time Harvard, Yale and Columbia. By the late 1920s, schools were moving away from the JD and once again granting only the LLB, with only law schools in Illinois holding out. This changed in the 1960s, by which time almost all law school entrants were graduates. The JD was reintroduced in 1962 and by 1971 had replaced the LLB, with many schools offering a JD as a replacement to their LLB alumni.

Canadian and Australian universities have had graduate-entry law programs that are very similar to the JD programs in the United States, but typically called the LLB. Some students at these universities advocated for the renaming of the graduate-entry LLB to the JD to recognise the graduate characteristics of the program and to obtain a so-called doctoral-level qualification.

===Descriptions of the JD outside the United States===
====Australia====
The traditional law degree in Australia is the undergraduate Bachelor of Laws (LLB). Beginning in the 2010s, many Australian universities now offer JD programs, including the country&#x27;s best ranked universities (e.g. the University of New South Wales, the University of Sydney, the Australian National University, the University of Melbourne, Monash University, and Western Sydney University).

Generally, universities that offer the JD also offer the LLB, although at some universities, only the graduate-entry JD is offered. The University of Melbourne, for example, has phased out its undergraduate LLB program for a graduate JD one.

An Australian Juris Doctor consists of three years of full-time study, or the equivalent. The course varies across different universities, though all are obliged to teach the Priestley 11 subjects per the requirements of state admissions boards in Australia. JDs are considered equivalent to LLBs, and graduates must meet the same requirements to qualify, including undergoing a practical training.

On the Australian Qualifications Framework, the Juris Doctor is classified as a &quot;masters degree (extended)&quot;, with an exception having been granted to use the term &quot;doctor&quot; in the title (other such exceptions include Doctor of Medicine, Doctor of Dentistry and Doctor of Veterinary Medicine). It may not be described as a doctoral degree and holders may not use the title &quot;doctor&quot;.

====Canada====
The JD degree is the dominant common-law law degree in Canada, having replaced many of the nation&#x27;s former LLB programs. Unlike other jurisdictions, the Canadian LLB was historically typically second-entry undergraduate degree that required the prior completion of another undergraduate degree. The University of Toronto became the first law school to rename its law degree in 2001. As with the second-entry LLB, in order to be admitted to a &quot;Juris Doctor&quot; program, applicants must have completed a minimum of two or three years of study toward a bachelor&#x27;s degree and scored well on the North American Law School Admission Test. Notwithstanding the formal requirements, nearly all successful applicants have completed undergraduate degrees before admission to a JD program. The JD in Canada is considered to be a bachelor&#x27;s degree qualification.

All Canadian &quot;Juris Doctor&quot; programs consist of three years and have similar content in their mandatory first year courses, including public law, property law, tort law, contract law, criminal law and legal research and writing. Beyond first year and other courses required for graduation, course selection is elective with various concentrations such as commercial and corporate law, taxation, international law, natural resources law, real estate transactions, employment law, criminal law and Aboriginal law. After graduation from an accredited law school, each province&#x27;s or territory&#x27;s law society requires completion of a bar admission course or examination and a period of supervised articling prior to independent practice.

United States jurisdictions other than New York and Massachusetts do not recognize Canadian &quot;Juris Doctor&quot; degrees automatically. Likewise, United States JD graduates are not automatically recognized in Canadian jurisdictions such as Ontario. To prepare graduates to practise in jurisdictions on both sides of the border, some pairs of law schools have developed joint Canadian-American JD programs. As of 2018, these include a three-year program conducted concurrently at the University of Windsor and the University of Detroit Mercy, as well as a four-year program with the University of Ottawa and either Michigan State University or American University in which students spend two years studying on each side of the border. Previously, New York University (NYU) Law School and Osgoode Hall Law School offered a similar program, but this has since been terminated.

Two notable exceptions are Université de Montréal and Université de Sherbrooke, which both offer a one-year JD program aimed at Quebec civil law graduates in order to practice law either elsewhere in Canada or in the state of New York.

York University offered the degree of Doctor of Jurisprudence (D.Jur.) as a research degree until 2002, when the name of the program was changed to Ph.D. in law.

====China====
The primary law degree in the People&#x27;s Republic of China is the undergraduate Bachelor of Laws. The Juris Magister is the graduate-level professional law degree in China, which is regarded as the counterpart of a Juris Doctor. In fall 2008, the Shenzhen graduate campus of Peking University started the School of Transnational Law, which offers a United States-style education and awards a Chinese Juris Doctor degree.

===== Hong Kong =====
The JD degree is currently offered at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, The University of Hong Kong, and City University of Hong Kong. The JD in Hong Kong is almost identical to the LLB, and is reserved for graduates of non-law disciplines. However, the JD requires a thesis or dissertation. The JD in Hong Kong is a 2-year program, including study during the summer term, but can be extended to three years with summer vacations. The JD is considered a master&#x27;s degree by universities and the Hong Kong Qualification Framework.

Neither the LLB nor the JD provides the education sufficient for a license to practice. Graduates of both are also required to undertake the PCLL course and a solicitor traineeship or barrister pupillage.

====Italy====
In Italy, only one program gives access to traditional legal professions such as lawyer, magistrate or public notary, and that is the &quot;Laurea Magistrale in Giurisprudenza&quot;. Legal studies have a long history in Italy, with the University of Bologna being the main Italian center for studies of both canon law and civil law in the 12th and 13th centuries.

The &quot;laurea magistrale in giurisprudenza&quot; is a five-year academic program, deemed a master&#x27;s-level degree under the Bologna process, that can be entered into with a high school diploma. The program comprises universities classes in legal theory and legal subjects, excluding practical courses, and is concluded with a thesis () to be defended before an academic commission. In a novel approach, a few universities are trialing a 3+2 model, which initially offers a bachelor&#x27;s degree in law, followed by the option to undertake an additional two years to earn the Italian Juris Doctor.

Italian graduates in law are awarded the title of Doctor of Law (, commonly known as &quot;Dottore in legge&quot;), in keeping with standard Italian practice of awarding the title of doctor to university graduates.

Holders of the &quot;Laurea Magistrale in Giurisprudenza&quot; are eligible to register with an Italian bar association, which is a prerequisite for the mandatory eighteen-month apprenticeship under a practicing attorney-at-law before taking the bar examination. Alternatively, graduates may opt for two additional years of study at the &quot;Scuole di Specializzazione per le Professioni Legali&quot; (Specialization Schools for the Legal Profession), leading to a &quot;Diploma di Specializzazione per le Professioni Legali&quot; (Specialization Diploma for the Legal Profession), akin to a master&#x27;s degree. Possession of the &quot;Laurea Magistrale in Giurisprudenza&quot; also qualifies individuals to partake in the competitive public examination, administered by the Ministry of Justice, for entry into the ordinary magistracy.

====Japan====
In Japan the JD is known as . The program generally lasts three years. Two-year JD programs for applicants with legal knowledge (mainly undergraduate level law degree holders) are also offered. This curriculum is professionally oriented, but does not provide the education sufficient for a license to practice as an attorney in Japan. All candidates for licensing must undertake a 12-month practical training by the Legal Training and Research Institute after passing the bar examination. Similarly to the United States, the Juris Doctor is classed as a in Japan, which is separate from the academic class of postgraduate master&#x27;s degrees and doctorates.

====Philippines====
In the Philippines, the graduate JD exists alongside the more common undergraduate LLB. Like the LLB, it requires four years of study. The JD comprises courses in core bar subjects in 2.5 years, following which students may take elective courses; an apprenticeship; and the defence of a thesis.

The degree was first conferred in the Philippines by the Ateneo de Manila Law School, which developed the program later adopted by most law schools. In 2008, the University of the Philippines College of Law began conferring the JD on its graduates, renaming its LLB program into a JD to reflect the view that the &quot;nomenclature does not accurately reflect the fact that the LLB is a professional as well as a post-baccalaureate degree.&quot; In 2009, the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila and the Silliman University College of Law also renamed their respective LL.B programs to Juris Doctor. The newly established De La Salle University College of Law is likewise offering the JD.

====Singapore====
The degree of Doctor of Jurisprudence is offered at all three law schools in Singapore, which also offer LLB degrees. It is a qualifying law degree for the purposes of admission to the legal profession in Singapore. A graduate of these programmes is a &quot;qualified person&quot; under Singapore&#x27;s legislation governing entry to the legal profession, and is eligible for admission to the Singapore Bar.

====United Kingdom====
The Quality Assurance Agency consulted in 2014 on the inclusion of &quot;Juris Doctor&quot; in the U.K. Framework for Higher Education Qualifications as an exception to the rule that &quot;doctor&quot; should only be used by doctoral degrees. It was proposed that the Juris Doctor would be an award at bachelor level, and would not confer the right to use the title &quot;doctor&quot;. This was not incorporated into the final framework published in 2014.

The only JD degree currently awarded by a U.K. university is at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast. The 3–4 year degree is specified a professional doctorate at the doctoral qualifications level, sitting above the LLM. It includes a 30,000-word dissertation.

Joint LLB/JD courses for a small number of students are offered by University College London, King&#x27;s College London, and the London School of Economics in collaboration with Columbia University. King&#x27;s also offers a joint LLB/JD with Georgetown University. King&#x27;s College London and the University of Exeter offer joint LLB/JD degrees with the Chinese University of Hong Kong, with two years in the UK followed by two years in Hong Kong.

Harvard Law School and the University of Cambridge offer a JD/LLM Joint Degree Program enabling Harvard JD candidates to earn a Cambridge LLM and a Harvard JD in 3.5 years.

The University of Southampton offers a two-year graduate-entry LLB described as a &quot;JD pathway&quot; degree. The University of Surrey previously offered a course similar to Southampton&#x27;s. The University of York offers a three-year so-called &quot;LLM Law (Juris Doctor)&quot; degree.

==In academia==
In the United States, the Juris Doctor is the degree that prepares the recipient to enter the law profession (as do the M.D. or D.O. in the medical profession and the D.D.S or D.M.D. in the dental profession). While the J.D. is the sole degree necessary to become a professor of law or to obtain a license to practice law, it (like the M.D., D.O, D.D.S, or D.M.D.) is not a &quot;research degree&quot;.

Research degrees in the study of law include the Master of Laws (LL.M.), which ordinarily requires the J.D. as a prerequisite, and the Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D./J.S.D.), which ordinarily requires the LL.M. as a prerequisite.

However, the American Bar Association, which accredits US law schools, has issued a Council Statement stating: &quot;WHEREAS, the acquisition of a Doctor of Jurisprudence degree requires from 84 to 90 semester hours of post baccalaureate study and the Doctor of Philosophy degree usually requires 60 semester hours of post baccalaureate study along with the writing of a dissertation, the two degrees shall be considered as equivalent degrees for educational employment purposes.&quot;

Accordingly, while most law professors are required to conduct original writing and research in order to be awarded tenure, the majority have a J.D. as their highest degree and are qualified to teach and supervise LL.M. and J.S.D candidates. However, research in 2015 showed an increasing trend toward hiring professors with both a J.D. and Ph.D. in a field that confers Ph.D. degrees, particularly at more highly ranked schools.
Professor Kenneth K. Mwenda criticized the council&#x27;s statement, pointing out that it compares the J.D. only to the taught component of the Ph.D. degree in the United States, ignoring the research and dissertation components.

The United States Department of Education Center for Education Statistics classifies the J.D. and other professional doctorates as &quot;doctor&#x27;s degree-professional practice.&quot; It classifies the Ph.D. and other research doctorates as &quot;doctor&#x27;s degree-research/scholarship.&quot; Among legal degrees, it accords the latter status only to the Doctor of Juridical Science degree.

In Europe, the European Research Council follows a similar policy, stating that a professional degree carrying the title &quot;doctor&quot; is not considered equivalent to a research degree, such as a Ph.D. The Dutch and Portuguese National Academic Recognition Information Centres both classify the JD granted in the United States (along with other professional doctorate degrees) as equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree, while the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland states with respect to United States practice that: &quot;The &#x27;... professional degree&#x27; is a first degree, not a graduate degree, even though it incorporates the word &#x27;doctor&#x27; in the title&quot;

Commonwealth countries also often consider the JD granted in the United States equivalent to a bachelor&#x27;s degree, even though the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services has advised that &quot;while neither degree is likely equivalent to a Ph.D., a JD, or MD degree would be considered to be equivalent to, if not higher than, a masters degree&quot;.

==Use of the title &quot;doctor&quot;==
Since at least the 1920s, it has been contrary to custom in the United States to address holders of the JD as &quot;doctor&quot;.

In the late 1960s, the rising number of American law schools awarding JDs led to debate over whether lawyers could ethically use the title &quot;doctor&quot;. Initial informal ethics opinions, based on the &quot;Canons of Professional Ethics&quot; then in force, came down against this. These were then reinforced with an ABA ethics opinion that maintained the ban on using the title in legal practice (except when dealing with countries where the use of &quot;doctor&quot; by lawyers was standard practice) but allowed the use of the title in academia &quot;if the school of graduation thinks of the JD degree as a doctor&#x27;s degree&quot;. The opinion generated much debate.

The introduction of the 1969 &quot;Code of Professional Responsibility&quot; settled the question in favour of allowing the use of the title in states where the code was adopted. There was some dispute over whether only the Ph.D.-level Doctor of Juridical Science grant the title, but ethics opinions have read the &quot;Code&quot; as allowing JD-holders to be called &#x27;doctor&#x27;, while acknowledging that the older &quot;Canons&quot; did not.

As not all state bars adopted the new code, and some omitted the clause permitting the use of the title, confusion over whether lawyers could ethically use the title &quot;doctor&quot; continued. While many state bars now allow the use of the title, some prohibit its use where there is any chance of confusing the public about a lawyer&#x27;s actual qualifications (e.g. if the public might believe the lawyer is a doctor of medicine). There has been discussion on whether it is permissible in some other limited instances. For example, in June 2006, the Florida Bar Board of Governors ruled that a lawyer could refer to himself as a &quot;doctor en leyes&quot; (doctor in laws) in a Spanish-language advertisement, reversing an earlier decision. The decision was reversed again the following month, when the board voted to only allow the use of untranslated names of degrees.

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; notes specifically in its stylebook that &quot;Lawyers, despite their JD degrees, aren&#x27;t called &quot;doctor&quot;.&quot; Many other newspapers reserve the title for physicians only or do not use titles at all. In 2011, &quot;Mother Jones&quot; published an article claiming that Michele Bachmann was misrepresenting her qualifications by using the &quot;bogus&quot; title &quot;Dr.&quot; based on her JD. They later amended the article to note that the use of the title by lawyers &quot;is a (begrudgingly) accepted practice in some states and not in others&quot;, although they maintained that it was rarely used as it &quot;suggests that you&#x27;re a medical doctor or a Ph.D. – and therefore conveys a false level of expertise.&quot;

<text>Hameln ( ; ) is a town on the river Weser in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is the capital of the district of Hameln-Pyrmont and has a population of roughly 57,000. Hameln is best known for the tale of the Pied Piper of Hamelin.

==History==

Hameln started with a monastery, which was founded as early as 851 AD; its surrounding village became a town by the 12th century. The incident involving the &quot;Pied Piper&quot; (see below) is said to have occurred in 1284 and may be based on a true event, although somewhat different from the traditional tale. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Hamelin was a minor member of the Hanseatic League.

In June 1634, during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Lothar Dietrich, Freiherr of Bönninghausen, a general in the Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Emperor, lost the Battle of Oldendorf to the Swedish General Kniphausen, after Hamelin had been besieged by the Swedish army.

The era of the town&#x27;s greatest prosperity began in 1664, when Hamelin became a fortified border town of the Principality of Calenberg. In 1705, it became part of the newly created Electorate of Hanover when George Louis, Prince of Calenberg, later King George I of Great Britain, inherited the Principality of Lüneburg.

Hameln was surrounded by four fortresses, which gave it the nickname &quot;Gibraltar of the North&quot;, and was the most heavily fortified town in the Electorate of Hanover. The first fort (Fort George) was built between 1760 and 1763, the second (Fort Wilhelm) in 1774, a third in 1784, and the last, called Fort Luise, was built in 1806.

In 1806, Hamelin surrendered without a fight to the French forces, after Napoleon&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt. Napoleon&#x27;s forces subsequently pulled down the town&#x27;s historic walls, the guard towers, and the three fortresses at the other side of the river Weser. In 1843, the people of Hamelin built a sightseeing tower on the Klüt Hill out of the ruins of Fort George. The tower is called the &quot;Klütturm&quot; and is a popular sight for tourists.

In 1867 Hamelin became part of the Kingdom of Prussia, which annexed Hanover in the aftermath of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866.

Between 1933 and 1937, the Nazi regime held the Reich Harvest Thanksgiving Festival at the nearby Bückeberg hill, to celebrate the achievements of Germany&#x27;s farmers.

During World War II, Hamelin Prison was used for the detention of Social Democrats, Communists, and other political prisoners. Around 200 died there, and more died in April 1945, when the Nazis sent the prisoners on long marches, fearing the Allied advance. Just after the war, Hamelin prison was used by British Occupation Forces for the detention of Germans accused of war crimes. Following their conviction, around 200 were hanged there, including Irma Grese and Josef Kramer, along with over a dozen of the perpetrators of the Stalag Luft III murders. The prison has since been turned into a hotel. Executed war criminals were interred in the prison yard until it became full, and further burials took place at the Am Wehl Cemetery in Hameln. In March 1954, German authorities began exhuming the 91 bodies from the prison yard, which were reburied in individual graves in consecrated ground in Am Wehl Cemetery.

The coat of arms (German: &quot;Wappen&quot;) of Hamelin depicts the Minster of St. Boniface, the oldest church in the city.

<doc id="153045" wikidata="Q975232" url="?curid=153045" title="Delta Kappa Epsilon">
<text>Delta Kappa Epsilon (&#x27;), commonly known as DKE or Deke&quot;&quot;&#x27;, is one of the oldest fraternities in the United States, with fifty-six active chapters and five active colonies across North America. It was founded at Yale College in 1844 by fifteen sophomores who were discontented with the existing fraternity order on campus. The men established a fellowship where the candidate most favored was &quot;he who combined in the most equal proportions the Gentleman, the Scholar, and the Jolly Good Fellow.&quot;

== History ==
Delta Kappa Epsilon was founded on , in room number twelve in the corner of Old South Hall on the campus of Yale College in New Haven, Connecticut. Its fifteen founders were: 

At this meeting, the Fraternity&#x27;s secret and open Greek mottos were devised, as were the lapel pin design and secret grip. The open motto became – &quot;Kerothen Philoi Aei&quot; – &quot;Friends From The Heart, Forever.&quot;

Central to the values of Delta Kappa Epsilon are its objects:
The objects of Delta Kappa Epsilon are the cultivation of general literature and social culture, the advancement and encouragement of intellectual excellence, the promotion of honorable friendship and useful citizenship, the development of a spirit of tolerance and respect for the rights and views of others, the maintenance of gentlemanly dignity, self-respect, and morality in all circumstances, and the union of stout hearts and kindred interests to secure to merit its due reward.Within five years of the founding of &quot;Phi chapter&quot; at Yale, chapters were installed at Bowdoin College, Princeton University, Colby College, Amherst College, University of Nashville, and the University of Alabama.

Despite traditionally selecting and installing &#x27; chapters along the Eastern Seaboard, &#x27; holds a strong reputation as a Southern fraternity. Between 1845 and 1846, thirteen of the 38 of the active members of the &quot;Phi chapter&quot; at Yale were Southerners. While Vanderbilt University was not founded until 1873, the &quot;Gamma chapter&quot; of was founded in Nashville 25 years earlier, in 1847. Also that year, the &quot;Psi chapter&quot; at University of Alabama and then &quot;Chi chapter&quot; at Mississippi would firmly root Delta Kappa Epsilon as an institution steeped in southern heritage.

Delta Kappa Epsilon&#x27;s first West Coast chapter was founded at the University of California, Berkeley on Halloween night, 1876. The &quot;Mu chapter&quot; at Colgate University in Hamilton, New York, is one of the few with a Temple, open only to DKE member initiates of the &quot;Mu chapter&quot;. The &quot;Lambda chapter&quot; at Kenyon College built the first fraternity lodge in 1854. Delta Kappa Epsilon became an international fraternity with the addition of the &quot;Alpha Phi chapter&quot; in 1898 at the University of Toronto, Canada. Expansion to the United Kingdom had little success. Today, chapters are located only in the United States and Canada.
The fraternity&#x27;s first convention was held in New Haven, Connecticut on December 23, 1946.

== Symbols ==
The &#x27; Flag consists of three bands of color: Azure (blue, truth), Champagne (gold, fidelity), and Gules (crimson, courage) with a &quot;dexter&quot; rampant lion in the middle band. &#x27; flags have been carried to the North Pole by its discoverer, Admiral Robert Peary and to the Moon by astronaut Alan Bean. Adorning the active pin are the Greek letters etched downward, diagonally across an ivory scroll and centered atop an onyx diamond, encased in rope-textured gold trim and stars gracing each of the four corners. Active members&#x27; initials for their given name and number as initiated in the chapter complete the active pin. Delta Kappa Epsilon pledges wear a triangle-shaped lapel pin with the same heraldic colors of Azure, Champagne &amp; Crimson, with red facing upward &amp; always on collared shirts.

== Activities ==
Community service is a major focus for each chapter of , in addition to the social aspect that integrates collegiate academics with Greek system of fraternities and sororities. Chapters compete and are awarded equally on merits of leadership, chapter improvement and community service. The Lion Trophy is awarded each year to the chapter with most notable achievements in each category.

== Chapters ==
 has grown to fifty-six chapters and has initiated over 85,000 members across North America.

== Delta Kappa Epsilon Club of New York ==
 Members of Delta Kappa Epsilon who have completed their undergraduate education are eligible for membership in The Delta Kappa Epsilon Club of New York. The DKE Club was founded on May 9, 1885, occupying several clubhouses in Midtown Manhattan, including 30 West 44th Street which it purchased from The Yale Club of New York City in 1916. After renovations totaling $75,000, the clubhouse opened in January 1917. However, just nine years later the Club relocated again when it sold the building to the Army and Navy Club of New York.

Partially due to the Great Depression, in 1932, the DKE Club entered into an affiliation with the Yale Club of New York whereby members would have the same access to its clubhouse and facilities as the 11,000 members of the Yale Club itself. Designed by James Gamble Rogers, the clubhouse is located at 50 Vanderbilt Avenue across from Grand Central Terminal. Upon opening its doors in 1915, the building became the largest clubhouse in the world and continues to be the largest college clubhouse in existence today.

The club has often hosted dinners and other events for notable alumni members of the fraternity such as polar explorer Robert Peary (who took a Deke flag to the North Pole with him in 1909).

Morgan, Jr., William Randolph Hearst, Cole Porter, Brett Kavanaugh, Ron DeSantis, Bradley Palmer, Henry Cabot Lodge, Dick Clark, Tom Landry, David Milch, and George Steinbrenner. ΔΚΕ flags were carried to the North Pole by its discoverer, Admiral Robert Peary and to the moon by astronaut Alan Bean.

During the Civil War, the first Union officer killed in battle was member Theodore Winthrop of &quot;Phi chapter&quot;. The dying soldier, Edwin S. Rogers (&quot;Theta&quot;), of Maine was attended to by a Confederate &quot;Psi&quot; from Alabama, who noted Rogers&#x27; &#x27; pin and sent it to the family. During the Spanish–American War, the first American officer to be killed was a fraternity member, Surgeon John B. Gibbs (&quot;Phi Chi&quot;). &#x27; member J. Frank Aldritch (&quot;Psi Phi&quot;) died when the USS &quot;Maine&quot; was sunk.

The fraternity has fifteen Medal of Honor recipients: George N. Bliss (&quot;Delta&quot;), Deming Bronson (&quot;Kappa Epsilon&quot;), Allen Buchanan (&quot;Psi Phi&quot;), Richard E. Fleming (Phi Epsilon), George W. Ford (&quot;Zeta&quot;), Webb Hayes (&quot;Delta Chi&quot;), Ruel Milton Johnson (&quot;Omicron&quot;), Charles Mattocks (&quot;Theta&quot;), Samuel E.

Yung Wing, the first Chinese graduate from an American university in 1854, was a member of the &quot;Phi chapter&quot;.

== Controversies and member misconduct ==

*In 1846, one year after establishing the &quot;Zeta chapter&quot; at Princeton University and reportedly very unpopular with staff, the chapter was kicked off campus. The chapter was reinstated six years later and again removed from campus and the charter revoked. Only 69 members were initiated during the chapter&#x27;s brief existence.
*On June 6, 1892, a pledge was led blindfolded through the street during his fraternity initiation towards Moriarty&#x27;s Cafe, a popular student hang-out. He was told to run and did so at top speed. He ran into a sharp carriage pole, injuring himself. He was rendered unconscious, but the injury was not thought to be serious at the time. He suffered an intestinal rupture and died five days later of peritonitis.
*In 1967, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on &quot;frat-branding&quot;, the alleged use of a hot branding iron to make a Δ shaped scar on new fraternity members. The Yale chapter&#x27;s then-president George W. Bush stated that they were &quot;only cigarette burns.&quot;
*In New Orleans in 1987, dozens of fraternity members marched in blackface in a parade in broad daylight.
*In 1989, Colgate University banned all &#x27; activities after the officials found members guilty of hazing, blackballing and other violations of university regulations. In 2005 Colgate University barred the fraternity from campus for refusing to sell its house to the school and join a new student-residence initiative. &#x27; filed a lawsuit charging that the school violated its right to free association as well as antitrust laws by monopolizing the student housing market. In 2006, the Supreme Court of Madison County found that the fraternity had failed to state a cause of action and that its claim was &quot;time-barred.&quot;
*In 1989, Virginia Tech banned all &#x27; activities on campus and asked the national office to revoke its charter after reports of a racially tinged hazing incident during a pledge trip to Kenyon College in Ohio surfaced on campus. After the allegations emerged the Virginia Tech administration under President James D. McComas acted swiftly and terminated the registration of DKE and ended its affiliation with the university less than a week later. Allegedly, a white &#x27; pledge had asked a black student at a Kenyon College party in Gambier, Ohio if he could kiss her while another pledge photographed them. The pledge had been instructed to do something unusual during the trip and bring back photos to prove it. After friends of the woman learned of the incident, an argument ensued and the Virginia Tech pledges were escorted off the Kenyon College campus. Its charter was not revoked and the DKE chapter continued to operate in its off-campus house in Blacksburg despite the ban. Through the efforts of influential Virginia Tech DKE alumni and university donors, the chapter was ultimately re-instated in the mid-1990s.
*In 1997, members of ΔΚΕ at Loyola University New Orleans and Tulane University invited students to celebrate Martin Luther King&#x27;s Birthday &quot;with fried chicken from Popeye&#x27;s, watermelon and a ‘forty’.”
*In December 2008, the University of California, Berkeley suspended recognition of the local DKE chapter for alcohol, hazing, and fire safety misconduct. The chapter never closed and continued without affiliation or oversight by UC Berkeley. The national office and the alumni association maintained their association with the local chapter. Four years later, the chapter opted not to reapply for recognition by the university and continued as an independent fraternity. In May 2012, during a routine patrol of the campus, the County Vice Enforcement Team visited the chapter. Several citations were issued for underage drinking.
*In October 2010, &quot;Phi chapter&quot; at Yale came under fire after its members shouted inflammatory and misogynistic chants at an Old Campus pledge ritual, including &quot;No means yes. Yes means anal&quot;. The chapter&#x27;s president, Jordan Forney, apologized for the fraternity&#x27;s conduct, characterizing it as a &quot;lapse in judgment.&quot; but Yale&#x27;s feminist magazine &quot;Broad Recognition&quot; called for administrative action against the leadership of &#x27;. By October 24, 2010, Dean Mary Miller of Yale College had strongly recommended to the &#x27; National Executive Director, Dr. Douglas Lanpher, that the chapter at Yale be put on probation indefinitely. Instead, on May 17, 2011, the chapter was suspended for five years. The order barred from conducting any activities on the Yale campus during that time.
*In January 2011, the chapter at the University of Alberta had its student group status suspended for five years after a hazing video surfaced of pledges being confined in a plywood box, forced to eat vomit, and deprived of sleep, by other fraternity members.
*In November 2014, a colony in Edinburgh, since closed, had the minutes leaked from a meeting in March 2014 by the University of Edinburgh student newspaper, &quot;The Student&quot;. The minutes allegedly referred to comments that joked about rape, sexual harassment, transphobia and hazing. The story gained traction in both national and international media, being picked up by &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot; magazine.
*In 2018, after Christine Blasey Ford accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, an old photograph surfaced showing two members of &#x27; marching across the Yale campus, one carrying a flag made from women&#x27;s underwear. Kavanaugh, who is not in the photograph, was a member of the fraternity when the photograph was taken. One of the members told the student paper that the underwear was obtained consensually, but female classmates said their rooms were ransacked by &#x27; members while they were in class, saying they were &quot;loud, entitled, pushy and creepy&quot;.

<text>The president of the State of Israel (, or ) is the head of state of Israel. The president is mostly, though not entirely, ceremonial; actual executive power is vested in the cabinet led by the prime minister. The incumbent president is Isaac Herzog, who took office on 7 July 2021. Presidents are elected by the Knesset for a single seven-year term.

==Election==
The President of Israel is elected by an absolute majority in the Knesset, by secret ballot. If no candidate receives an absolute majority of votes in the first or second round of voting, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated in each subsequent round, if needed until only two remain. From 1949 to 2000, the president was elected for a five-year term, and was allowed to serve up to two terms in office. Since 2000, the president serves a single seven-year term.

Any Israeli resident citizen is eligible to run for president; as there is no minimum age of candidacy, this would even allow a minor to hypothetically be elected. An age limit of 40 was considered, but rejected by the Knesset as unnecessary. The office falls vacant upon completion of a term, death, resignation, or the decision of three-quarters of the Knesset to remove the president on grounds of misconduct or incapacity. Presidential tenure is not keyed to that of the Knesset, in order to assure continuity in government and the non-partisan character of the office. There is no vice president in the Israeli governmental system. If the president is temporarily incapacitated, or leaves office, the speaker of the Knesset becomes acting president.

The first presidential election took place on 16 February 1949, and the winner was Chaim Weizmann. The second took place in 1951, as at the time presidential terms were linked to the length of the Knesset term (the first Knesset lasted only two years). Another election took place the following year after Weizmann&#x27;s death.

Since then, elections have been held in 1957, 1962, 1963 (an early election following Yitzhak Ben-Zvi&#x27;s death), 1968, 1973, 1978, 1983, 1988, 1993, 1998, 2000, 2007, 2014, and 2021. Six elections (1951, 1957, 1962, 1968, 1978, and 1988) have taken place with no opposition candidate, although a vote was still held.

Isaac Herzog was elected 11th President on 2 June 2021. His term started on 9 July.

==Powers and responsibilities==
The president&#x27;s fundamental role within the machinery of Israel&#x27;s uncodified constitution is to &quot;...stand at the head of the State&quot;, representing the state of Israel abroad and fostering national unity at home. In this capacity, the president personifies the Israeli state, sanctions the decisions of legitimate constitutional authorities, and guarantees the execution of the public will. Put another way, the presidency serves as a national symbol that seeks to reinforce the core values of the state and to give a voice to the diversity of Israeli society in the performance of its official functions. In these respects, the powers of the president of Israel are generally equivalent to those held by heads of state in other parliamentary democracies and are largely dictated by Basic Law: The Presidency, which was passed in 1964. The Basic Law: The Government also makes provision for the powers of the president in relation to Government formation.

However, unlike heads of state in most other parliamentary republics, the president is not the &quot;nominal&quot; chief executive. Rather, Basic Law: The Government explicitly vests executive power in the Government (as the Cabinet is officially called), with the prime minister as its head. Likewise, most presidential powers are either exercised in accordance with the strictures of the Basic Laws or on the binding advice of the Government. Indeed, most presidential acts require the countersignature of the prime minister or another minister designated thereby to have legal effect. Correspondingly, the presidency occupies a largely ceremonial role in the conduct of state business. Nevertheless, these constitutional limitations do not extend to the exercise of those discretionary functions comprising the president&#x27;s reserve powers.

The presidency enjoys immunity from both civil suit and criminal prosecution. Thus, the president is inviolable before the courts of law for any matter concerned with the performance of his or her official functions. The purpose of this substantive immunity is to guarantee the institutional independence of the president from the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. This arrangement effectively makes the presidency – in the words of one constitutional scholar – Israel&#x27;s &quot;fourth branch of government&quot;, allowing successive presidents to exercise nonpartisan influence (as opposed to party-political policymaking power) in their dealings with politicians, to assure the continuity and stability of state institutions, and to hold dialogue with the public on various charitable causes and issues of national import.

===Routine functions===
The president signs bills passed by the Knesset into law, except those bills that pertain to the president&#x27;s powers, and ratifies international or bilateral treaties approved by the Knesset. Acting on the advice of the Government, the president is also charged with endorsing the credentials of Israeli ambassadors abroad and receiving the credentials of foreign diplomats to Israel. Likewise, the president is responsible for appointing a wide array of public officials, including judges, the governor of the Bank of Israel, the president of Magen David Adom, the president of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, and members of the Council on Higher Education, the National Academy of Science, the Broadcasting Authority, the Authority to Rehabilitate Prisoners, the Chief Rabbinical Council and the Wolf Foundation. Judges are appointed by the president pursuant to the nominations of the Judicial Selection Committee. All other presidential appointments are made on the advice of the Government.

===Reserve powers===
In addition to routine functions exercised on the advice of the Government or in accordance with the strictures of the Basic Laws, the president enjoys personal discretion in matters of Government formation, parliamentary dissolution, and granting pardons. These functions comprise the reserve powers of the presidency.

====Formation of the Government====
The president&#x27;s most important power, in practice, is to lead the process of forming a Government. Israel&#x27;s electoral system and fractured political landscape make it all but impossible for one party to govern alone, let alone win an outright majority of Knesset seats. After each election, the president consults with party leaders to determine who is most likely to command a majority in the Knesset. Following such consultations, the president assigns a Knesset member the task of forming a Government. If the nominee is successful in forming a Government that can command the confidence of the Knesset, then said Knesset member becomes the prime minister. If a nominee fails to form a Government, then the president assigns the task anew. If a government is not formed within the timeframe stipulated in Basic Law: The Government, then the president dissolves the Knesset and calls for fresh elections.

====Dissolution of the Knesset====
The prime minister may request, by virtue of section 29 (a) of Basic Law: The Government, that the president dissolve the Knesset whenever the Government has lost its majority and is incapable of functioning. The president may refuse such a request, effectively dismissing the prime minister from office and triggering the resignation of the Government. The exercise of this authority by the president serves to prevent a prime minister from abusing their power – namely, beating the Knesset into submission through multiple snap elections.

====Presidential clemency====
The president has broad power to pardon, reduce, or commute the sentences of both soldiers and civilians, including to refuse requests for such clemency. The president reaches a decision regarding the prerogative of clemency at his or her own discretion, after receiving information from the applicants, requesting the opinion of other parties, and consulting the minister of justice or the minister of defense, as the case may be. Each Israeli president adopts a different approach to how they handle clemency, which influences their decision making.

===Other activities===
The president confers the dignity of Righteous Among the Nations on the recommendation of Yad Vashem, presents the Wolf Prize on the recommendation of the Wolf Foundation, and awards the Presidential Medal of Honor, the President&#x27;s Fund for Outstanding Doctoral Students, and the Presidential Award for Volunteerism in his absolute discretion. The President also participates in the awarding of the Israel Prize, which is held annually on Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut. Moreover, the president serves as the keynote speaker at the opening ceremonies of the half-yearly Knesset conference, as well as at the annual official ceremonies for Yom Hazikaron and Yom HaShoah.

==Presidential backgrounds==
Most Israeli presidents were involved in national politics or Zionist activities before taking office. Some were also distinguished in other fields. For example, Chaim Weizmann was a leading research chemist who founded the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot; Zalman Shazar was an author, poet, and journalist; and Chaim Herzog was a military leader, attorney, and diplomat.

The first Israeli presidents were born in the former Russian Empire. The first native-born president, as well as the first with a Sephardi background, was Yitzhak Navon. The first president with a Western European background was Chaim Herzog, who originally came from Belfast, United Kingdom. The first president with a Mizrahi background was Moshe Katsav, who was born in Iran.

The first president to be born in the modern state after Israel&#x27;s declaration of independence is Isaac Herzog. He is also the first son of a former Israeli president to also become president. As of 2024, the only other presidents with close family ties were Chaim Weizmann and his nephew Ezer Weizman.

==Political affiliation==
All Israeli presidents from Yitzhak Ben-Zvi to Ezer Weizman were members of, or associated with, the Labor Party and its predecessors, and have been considered politically moderate. Moshe Katsav was the first Likud president. These tendencies were especially significant in the April 1978 election of Labor&#x27;s Yitzhak Navon, following the inability of the governing Likud coalition to elect its candidate to the presidency. Israeli observers believed that, in counterbalance to Prime Minister Menachem Begin&#x27;s polarizing leadership, Navon, the country&#x27;s first president of Sephardi origin, provided Israel with unifying symbolic leadership at a time of great political controversy and upheaval. In 1983, Navon decided to re-enter Labor politics after five years of non-partisan service as president, and Chaim Herzog (previously head of military intelligence and Ambassador of Israel to the United Nations) succeeded him as Israel&#x27;s sixth president. Likud&#x27;s Moshe Katsav&#x27;s victory over Labor&#x27;s Shimon Peres in 2000 (by secret ballot) was an upset.

Albert Einstein, a Jew, but not an Israeli citizen, was offered the presidency in 1952, but turned it down, stating: &quot;I am deeply moved by the offer from our State of Israel, and at once saddened and ashamed that I cannot accept it. All my life I have dealt with objective matters, hence I lack both the natural aptitude and the experience to deal properly with people and to exercise official functions.&quot; Ehud Olmert was reported to be considering offering the presidency to another non-Israeli, Elie Wiesel, but he was said to be &quot;very not interested&quot;.

<text>&quot;The Odyssey of Flight 33&quot; is episode 54 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, the 18th episode of the second season. An unlikely break of the time barrier finds a commercial airliner sent back into the prehistoric age and then to New York City of 1939. The tale is a modern telling of the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; myth, and was written by series creator Rod Serling. It originally aired on February 24, 1961 on CBS.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==

Global Airlines Flight 33 is en route from London to New York City. About 50 minutes from Idlewild Airport, Captain Farver and his crew notice that the ground speed of their Boeing 707 is rapidly increasing beyond all reason. Their true airspeed remains constant, so there is no risk of the plane breaking up. They can no longer contact anyone by radio.

The plane travels through a flash of light and severe turbulence; the captain wonders if they have gone through the sound barrier. There is no apparent damage to the aircraft. Still unable to contact anyone on the ground, and at the risk of potential collision with other aircraft, Farver finally decides to descend below the clouds. The crew is able to identify the coastline of Manhattan Island and other geographic landmarks, but there is no city. The crew realizes that they have traveled far back in time when they see grazing dinosaurs.

Their only hope of returning to the present day is to increase altitude and speed in an attempt to catch the same &#x27;jet stream&#x27;. After another flash of light and violent shaking, New York City is once again visible, and although they still cannot contact Idlewild, they are able to reach LaGuardia Airport. However, the air traffic controller on the radio does not understand their technological references. The controller eventually clears the aircraft to land at LaGuardia, but orders the captain to report to the CAA office afterward; the captain remarks that they haven&#x27;t called the Federal Aviation Agency by that name in years. The copilot spots the buildings and structures from the New York World&#x27;s Fair of 1939 below, making the crew realize that they did come back, but &quot;not far enough&quot;.

The captain attempts one more ascent before the fuel runs out, in an effort to return the plane to 1961. He addresses the passengers, explaining that they have traveled back in time. &quot;All I ask of you is that you remain calm,&quot; he tells the passengers over the P.A. system, &quot;...and pray.&quot;

==Closing narration==
==Production notes==
Serling originally developed the idea for the show when he learned that American Airlines had a mockup of a 707 interior, previously used for flight attendant training, that they would make available to TV or film production companies.

Serling&#x27;s brother, aviation writer Robert J. Serling, helped Serling with the cockpit dialogue for the show by discussing the show&#x27;s premise with a Trans World Airlines captain; after the show aired, several pilots later wrote to say that they thought the cockpit dialogue was among the most authentic ever in a television show.

The Brontosaurus model and miniature jungle set from the 1960 film &quot;Dinosaurus!&quot; were used for the stop motion animation.

LaGuardia Airport, although it had opened in October 1939 (and thus was open during the second half of the 1939–40 World&#x27;s Fair held in New York), was not officially named after Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia until 1947; up to that point, its official name was New York Municipal Airport. However, the nickname &quot;LaGuardia Field&quot; was in common use two weeks after the airport opened.

==Graphic novel==
This episode was one of several &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; stories adapted as a graphic novel. The adaptation expands upon the television episode, including a subplot involving several passengers and flight crew, as well as updating the story to 1973. It also adds a time jump to the future.

<doc id="153051" wikidata="Q2663208" url="?curid=153051" title="Twenty Two (The Twilight Zone)">
<text>&quot;Twenty Two&quot; is episode 53 of the American television series &quot;The Twilight Zone.&quot; The story was adapted by Rod Serling from a short anecdote in the 1944 Bennett Cerf Random House anthology &quot;Famous Ghost Stories&quot;, which itself was an adaptation of &quot;The Bus-Conductor&quot;, a short story by E. F. Benson published in &quot;The Pall Mall Magazine&quot; in 1906. It was one of the six episodes of the second season that were shot on videotape in a short-lived experiment aimed at cutting costs, and was directed by Jack Smight.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Liz Powell awakens in her hospital room by the loud ticking of a clock. She knocks a glass of water to the floor, shattering it, then follows the sound of footsteps into the hall. She sees a nurse, half-hidden in shadow, descend to the basement in the elevator. She follows the nurse down and finds the hospital morgue, room 22. The nurse emerges from the room and says, &quot;Room for one more, honey.&quot; Liz screams and flees to the elevator.

Liz awakens, the experience being a nightmare. Liz is a professional dancer, hospitalized for exhaustion, and she has been having the same recurring, vivid nightmare. She insists the dream is really happening to her, although her agent, Barney, seems doubtful. Her doctor tries to assure her this is impossible. He produces the night nurse who attends the morgue, and Liz doesn&#x27;t recognize her. The doctor suggests Liz try an experiment in lucid dreaming and alter one detail of the dream.

That night, the dream begins again. Liz visualizes a pack of cigarettes next to the glass on the nightstand. When the clock awakens her, she reaches for a cigarette instead of the glass. She drops the lighter, and while reaching to retrieve it, her other hand knocks the glass to the floor. The dream continues as before, ending in the morgue. Liz awakens hysterical, and a nurse is required to hold her down while the doctor sedates her. The doctor tells the nurse it is odd that Liz, who has never seen the real morgue, knows it is room number 22.

After several days, Liz is discharged from the hospital. She goes to the airport to fly to her next booking in Miami Beach. She buys her ticket and is told she will be on Flight 22. She begins experiencing sensory details from the dream: she is thirsty, distracted by the ticking of a clock that only she can hear, bumps into a woman carrying a vase which drops and shatters, and hears loud footsteps. She crosses the tarmac to her plane and climbs the boarding stairs. As she reaches the top, a stewardess identical to the nurse from the dream emerges from the cabin. She says, &quot;Room for one more, honey.&quot; Screaming, Liz stumbles down the stairs and races back to the terminal. Outside the terminal, Flight 22 taxis to the runway, takes off—and explodes.

==Closing narration==
==Production==
The original 1906 story by E.F. Benson features a large, middle-aged male protagonist named Hugh Grainger from the English country visiting a friend in London. He is haunted by a man dressed like a bus conductor—but driving a horse-drawn hearse. He sees the same man a month later actually driving a bus that is involved in a tremendous auto accident. The 1944 Cerf anecdote features instead a young New York woman visiting the Carolina plantation of distant relatives, with the hearse&#x27;s coachman eventually revealed to be the operator of a medical building elevator that plummets when its cables break. In the 1944 film, &quot;Dead of Night,&quot; the protagonist is again male, also with the name Hugh Grainger, haunted by a man driving a hearse, and has a premonition about a fatal bus crash.

As &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;″s second season began, the production was informed by CBS that, at about $65,000 per episode, the show was exceeding its budget. By November 1960, 16 episodes, more than half of the projected 29, were already filmed, and five of those had been broadcast. It was decided that six consecutive episodes (production code #173-3662 through #173-3667) would be videotaped at CBS Television City in the manner of a live drama and eventually transferred to 16-millimeter film for future syndicated rebroadcasts. Eventual savings amounted to only about $30,000 for all six entries, which was judged to be insufficient to offset the loss of depth of visual perspective that, at the time, only film could offer. The shows wound up looking little better than set-bound soap operas and, as a result, the experiment was deemed a failure and never tried again.

<text>&quot;Mr. Dingle, the Strong&quot; is episode 55 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, and is the 19th episode of the second season. It was one of the many episodes in the second season written by series creator and showrunner Rod Serling, and was directed by German filmmaker John Brahm. The episode originally aired on March 3, 1961 on CBS.

==Opening narration==
The narration continues when the Martians arrive.

==Plot==
In an experiment, a two-headed Martian scientist, who is invisible to Earthlings, gives vacuum-cleaner salesman and perennial loser Luther Dingle superhuman strength. After discovering his inexplicable powers, Dingle begins performing various feats of strength, from lifting statues to splitting boulders, and gains a great deal of publicity.

The two-headed Martian returns and is disappointed to see that Dingle is using his strength only for show. The Martian takes his strength away just as Dingle attempts to lift a building before a live television audience. Unable to make good on his claims or repeat any of his previous feats, Dingle becomes a laughingstock.

As the two-headed Martian scientist leaves, it meets two Venusians who are also searching for a suitable Earthling for an experiment. The two-headed Martian scientist recommends Dingle and the Venusians gives Dingle super-intelligence. Discovering his new powers, Dingle starts thinking aloud at an alarming rate and demonstrates incredible powers of prediction.

==Closing narration==
==Short story adaptation==
In the short story version of this episode, the bettor is named Hubert Kransky and the two-headed Martian is named Xurthya. Dingle also beats up Hubert at one point. Additionally, Dingle takes his brilliance to change the world at Harvard.

Ace wins every bet he makes, disregarding Jimbo&#x27;s headaches from the use of his powers and his growing moral concerns over what they are doing, and accumulates hundreds of thousands of dollars in winnings. Kitty becomes disgusted with Ace&#x27;s behavior and leaves, so Ace hires the casino&#x27;s cigarette girl as his companion for the night and has the manager call Phil Nolan, a notorious gangster from Chicago. Ace and Nolan begin a private game of craps, with Ace winning roll after roll. Ignoring Jimbo&#x27;s interruptions, Ace decides to bet all his money on the next roll but unexpectedly loses; Jimbo says afterward that his powers had suddenly failed him. The loss awakens Ace to the reality of what he has become, and he and Jimbo have a good laugh over their misfortune and return home with Kitty.

Back at the café, Ace asks Kitty to marry him just as Jimbo drops his broom. She flips a coin, and Ace calls &quot;heads&quot;. Without showing Ace the coin or telling him the result of the flip, she decides to accept his proposal. As they embrace, Jimbo picks up the broom telekinetically, revealing he faked his loss of power to snap Ace out of his greed.

<text>&quot;Long Distance Call&quot; is episode 58 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It originally aired on March 31, 1961, on CBS. In the episode, a 5-year-old boy named Billy communicates with his dead grandmother using a toy telephone that she gave him on his birthday. It was one of the six episodes of the second season which was shot on videotape in a short-lived experiment aimed to cut costs.

==Opening narration==
The narration begins a few minutes into the episode:
==Plot==
Billy&#x27;s beloved grandmother visits for his fifth birthday party, despite being deathly frail. She gives the boy a toy telephone, telling him that he can always talk to her on it. She then becomes gravely weak and delusional, failing to recognize her son Chris and imagining that Billy is her son instead, before dying.

Billy&#x27;s parents, especially his mother Sylvia, become concerned when he spends all his time on the toy telephone talking to his grandmother. He says that she tells him she is lonely and misses him. While the parents are at her funeral, Billy runs out in front of a car. The driver, who barely manages to swerve out of the way, reports that Billy said someone told him to do it. When his father asks him why he did it, Billy says he does not know. Chris tries to explain that Grandma has died, and asks that he not use the toy phone in front of his mother. He discusses with Sylvia how his mother had two children before him, both of whom died, which is why she was so attached to him and especially Billy, who reminded her of Chris and helped her forget years of loss.

That night, Sylvia is awakened by the sound of Billy talking and laughing. Going to his room, she grabs the phone out of his hands, but is shocked when she hears Grandma on it and drops it; inadvertently breaking it in the process. Upset, Billy runs out of the room. Chris and Sylvia look for him, and are horrified to find him face down in their garden pool.

An ambulance attendant informs the parents that Billy&#x27;s chances are not good. Chris goes upstairs to Billy&#x27;s room, picks up the toy phone, and begs his mother to give Billy back and allow him to experience life. He pleads that if she really loves him, she will let him live. Downstairs, the attendants&#x27; efforts to revive Billy succeed, and when Chris joins them, he and Sylvia embrace, relieved.

==Closing narration==
== Production ==
As &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;″s second season began, the production was informed by CBS that at about $65,000 per episode, the show was exceeding its budget. By November 1960, 16 episodes, more than half of the projected 29, were already filmed, and five of those had been broadcast. It was decided that six consecutive episodes (production code #173-3662 through #173-3667) would be videotaped at CBS Television City in the manner of a live drama and then transferred to 16-millimeter film for future syndicated TV transmissions. Eventual savings amounted to only about $30,000 for all six entries, which was judged to be insufficient to offset the loss of depth of visual perspective that only film could offer. The shows wound up looking little better than set-bound soap operas and as a result the experiment was deemed a failure and never tried again. &quot;Long Distance Call&quot; was the last of these six episodes to be aired.

The episode originated as a spec script by Maxwell Sanford entitled &quot;Party Line&quot; that was submitted to the producers via Sanford&#x27;s friend, Richard Matheson (who in 1953 had written an unrelated short story titled &quot;Long Distance Call,&quot; about a woman who receives mysterious telephone calls from a cemetery). Charles Beaumont offered to undertake revisions and ended up taking a joint credit on-screen with a Bill Idelson instead. Sanford, (full name Maxwell Sanford Miller) was also an entertainment attorney and he successfully contested the credit through the Writers Guild. Thereafter the writing credit was changed on some prints in strip syndication to Maxwell Sanford. According to Martin Grams Jr in his book on the series, the episode was subject to at least two separate plagiarism claims regarding the authorship.

<doc id="153055" wikidata="Q2336464" url="?curid=153055" title="A Hundred Yards Over the Rim">
<text>&quot;A Hundred Yards Over the Rim&quot; is episode 59 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, and is the 23rd episode of the second season. It originally aired on April 7, 1961, on CBS. The episode was written by series creator and showrunner Rod Serling. It was directed by filmmaker Buzz Kulik, and was shot on film, unlike later episodes. This was the first of two appearances on &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; by Cliff Robertson, the second being in the 1962 episode &quot;The Dummy&quot;.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
In the year 1847, Chris Horn is the leader of a small wagon train from Ohio attempting to reach California. Horn&#x27;s wife and young son Christian are riding in one of the group&#x27;s covered wagons. Christian is dangerously ill and the others advise Horn they wish to turn back, as they are running out of supplies and lack medicine for the sick. Determined to keep going, Horn sets off alone to a nearby hill, in a desperate search for water and sustenance.

Upon crossing over the rim, Horn suddenly finds himself in 1961 New Mexico and is perplexed to see telephone poles, a hard black road, and a large, fast-moving truck coming at him. He stumbles out of the way, accidentally firing his rifle and grazing his arm. He comes to a small café and gas station, owned by Joe and Mary Lou. Joe gives Horn water while Mary Lou tends to his injury, offering him penicillin, which she explains will ward off infection. They ask where he is from, curious about his old-fashioned clothes and antique-yet-seemingly-new rifle. However, they do not believe his story, and consider him mentally unstable.

Joe calls a local doctor to come check on Horn. The doctor finds him fit and seemingly rational, with only the implausibility of the man&#x27;s story giving him reason to think otherwise, and calls the local sheriff. Meanwhile, Horn has found an encyclopedia containing a brief biographical entry for &quot;Horn, Christian Jr., M.D.&quot;, who did great work with children&#x27;s diseases in late 19th-century California. Horn concludes that this is his son, and believes that he has been brought to this place to save him. Taking the penicillin with him, he leaves and runs back toward the rim.

The arriving sheriff and Joe pursue Horn, who stumbles and drops his rifle before scrambling back over the rim. He sees the wagon train where he had left it, then looks back over the rim to find the territory unsettled. After giving his son a dose of penicillin, Horn leads the party onward to a fresh water spring that Joe had mentioned and California. Concurrently, Joe and the sheriff have returned to the café. Joe tells Mary Lou that Horn simply vanished and all they found was Horn&#x27;s rifle on the ground where he dropped it. Looking at it, they see that it now shows the effects of more than 100 years of exposure.

==Closing narration==
==Production==
The location shooting for the scenes of the wagon train in the sand dunes and the exterior of the roadside diner was carried out at Olancha, California in the Owens Valley, located on U.S. Route 395, approximately 300 km (190 miles) north of Los Angeles, adjacent to the Sierra Nevada mountains. This is one of two &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episodes filmed at this locale, the other being &quot;Third from the Sun&quot; (1960). The distinctive geography of the Olancha area was also used for location shooting for the feature films &quot;Tremors&quot; (1990), &quot;Bug&quot; (2006), and &quot;Iron Man&quot; (2008).

Cliff Robertson, having done research, picked the outfit for himself especially as he felt that it would have been accurate to what someone from Ohio would have worn in the 1800s, despite it being highly uncomfortable. Buzz Kulik disapproved of the outfit and they had an argument that was only settled in Robertson&#x27;s favor when they called up Rod Serling. After filming, the crew agreed that Robertson made the right call.

<text>&quot;Static&quot; is episode 56 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It originally aired on March 10, 1961 on CBS. It was one of the six episodes of the second season which was shot on videotape in a short-lived experiment aimed to cut costs.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Ed Lindsay, an embittered bachelor in his late fifties, living in a boarding house, is dismayed over the mindless programs and commercials on the TV set watched by the residents. He retrieves from the basement an old radio which, in his younger and happier days, he enjoyed as a source of relaxation and entertainment. Installing it in his room, he is pleased to hear the radio receiving 1930s/1940s music and programs. He tells the others about the broadcasts, which they first assume are recordings. Unable to receive them on a modern portable radio, they come into his room—but hear only static. Ed tries to contact the radio station, but discovers it has been out of business for years.

Ed has a confrontation with Vinnie Broun, who has lived in the same boarding house with him for two decades. In an earlier era, they had intended to marry, but other things interfered until too much time had passed. She tells him that the past cannot be recovered and he should let it go, and that he is simply having a delusion. Ed is furious and he throws Vinnie out of his room. His obsession with his radio continues to grow.

Worried about Ed&#x27;s mental state, Vinnie and the other residents have the radio hauled away by a shopkeeper. Ed rushes out and buys it back for $10. He takes it back to his room and, to his great relief, finds it still operational. He loses himself in an old Tommy Dorsey love song, the one he would share with Vinnie. He calls her to his room and the door swings open and Vinnie enters. Ed is suddenly transported back in time to 1940, and he and Vinnie are young again. Ecstatic, Ed professes his love for Vinnie and embraces her, determined to do things right this time around.

By November 1960, 16 episodes, more than half of the projected 29, were already filmed, and five of those had been broadcast.

The shows wound up looking little better than set-bound soap operas and as a result the experiment was deemed a failure and never tried again.

A &quot;modern day&quot; adaptation of this story (set at the present time in England and with the 1930s radio switched out for a television of a type contemporary with the time of the original episode) was written as a short story of the same name by Robert Shearman. It was first published by Comma Press in Shearman’s 2007 anthology &quot;Tiny Deaths&quot;, and won a World Fantasy Award. The story itself was then adapted into a short film, which took the action back to the United States, but kept the present day setting. The themes of loss and longing for a simpler romanticised past are prevalent in all three versions.

A member of the Republican Party, he served in the United States Senate from 1893 to 1924 and is best known for his positions on foreign policy. His successful crusade against Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Treaty of Versailles ensured that the United States never joined the League of Nations and his penned conditions against that treaty, known collectively as the Lodge reservations, influenced the structure of the modern United Nations.

Lodge received four degrees from Harvard University and was a widely published historian. His close friendship with Theodore Roosevelt began as early as 1884 and lasted their entire lifetimes, even surviving Roosevelt&#x27;s bolt from the Republican Party in 1912.

As a representative, Lodge sponsored the unsuccessful Lodge Bill of 1890, which sought to protect the voting rights of African Americans and introduce a national secret ballot. As a senator, Lodge took a more active role in foreign policy, supporting the Spanish–American War, expansion of American territory overseas, and American entry into World War I. He also supported immigration restrictions, becoming a member of the Immigration Restriction League and influencing the Immigration Act of 1917.

After World War I, Lodge became Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the leader of the Senate Republicans. From that position, he led the opposition to Wilson&#x27;s Treaty of Versailles, proposing 14 reservations to the treaty. His strongest objection was to the requirement that all nations repel aggression, fearing that this would erode congressional powers and erode American sovereignty; those objections had a major role in producing the veto power of the United Nations Security Council. Lodge remained in the Senate until his death in 1924.

==Early life and education==
Lodge was born in Beverly, Massachusetts. His father was John Ellerton Lodge of the Lodge family. His mother was Anna Cabot, a member of the Cabot family, through whom he was a great-grandson of George Cabot. Lodge was a Boston Brahmin. He grew up on Boston&#x27;s Beacon Hill and spent part of his childhood in Nahant, Massachusetts, where he witnessed the 1860 kidnapping of a classmate and gave testimony leading to the arrest and conviction of the kidnappers. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Lodge&#x27;s father wanted to ride into battle at the head of a cavalry regiment he had personally put together, but his father missed the chance, possibly due to a bad knee from a riding injury, and in September 1862, Lodge&#x27;s father suddenly died. He was cousin to the American polymath Charles Peirce.

In 1872, he graduated from Harvard College, where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon, the Porcellian Club, and the Hasty Pudding Club. In 1874, he graduated from Harvard Law School, and was admitted to the bar in 1875, practicing at the Boston firm now known as Ropes &amp; Gray.

==Historian==
After traveling through Europe, Lodge returned to Harvard, and, in 1876, became one of the earliest recipients of a PhD in history from an American university. Lodge&#x27;s dissertation, &quot;The Anglo-Saxon Land Law&quot;, was published in a compilation &quot;Essays in Anglo-Saxon Law&quot;, alongside his PhD classmates: James Laurence Laughlin on &quot;The Anglo-Saxon Legal Procedure&quot; and Ernest Young on &quot;The Anglo-Saxon Family Law&quot;. All three were supervised by Henry Adams, who contributed &quot;The Anglo-Saxon Courts of Law&quot;. Lodge maintained a lifelong friendship with Adams.

As a popular historian of the United States, Lodge focused on the early Federalist Era. He published biographies of George Washington and the prominent Federalists Alexander Hamilton, Daniel Webster, and his great-grandfather George Cabot, as well as &quot;A Short History of the English Colonies in America&quot;. In 1898, he published &quot;The Story of the Revolution&quot; in serial form in Scribner&#x27;s Magazine.

Lodge was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1878. In 1881, he was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society. He was also a member of the Massachusetts Historical Society, and served as its president from 1915 to 1924. As such, Lodge penned a preface to &quot;The Education of Henry Adams&quot; (which had been written by Adams in 1905 and printed in a private edition for family and friends) when this classic autobiography was posthumously published by the Massachusetts Historical Society in September 1918.

==Political career==
In 1880–1882, Lodge served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. Lodge represented his home state in the United States House of Representatives from 1887 to 1893 and in the Senate from 1893 to 1924.

Along with his close friend Theodore Roosevelt, Lodge was sympathetic to the concerns of the Mugwump faction of the Republican Party. Nonetheless, both reluctantly supported James Blaine and protectionism in the 1884 election. Blaine lost narrowly.

Lodge was first elected to the US Senate in 1892 and easily reelected time and again but his greatest challenge came in his reelection bid in January 1911. The Democrats had made significant gains in Massachusetts and the Republicans were split between the progressive and conservative wings, with Lodge trying to mollify both sides. In a major speech before the legislature voted, Lodge took pride in his long selfless service to the state. He emphasized that he had never engaged in corruption or self-dealing. He rarely campaigned on his own behalf but now he made his case, explaining his important roles in civil service reform, maintaining the gold standard, expanding the Navy, developing policies for the Philippine Islands, and trying to restrict immigration by illiterate Europeans, as well as his support for some progressive reforms. Most of all he appealed to party loyalty. Lodge was reelected by five votes.

Lodge was very close to Theodore Roosevelt for both of their entire careers. However, Lodge was too conservative to accept Roosevelt&#x27;s attacks on the judiciary in 1910, and his call for the initiative, referendum, and recall. Lodge stood silent when Roosevelt broke with the party and ran as a third-party candidate in 1912. Lodge voted for Taft instead of Roosevelt; after Woodrow Wilson won the election the Lodge-Roosevelt friendship resumed.

===Civil rights===
In 1890, Lodge co-authored the Federal Elections Bill, along with Senator George Frisbie Hoar, that guaranteed federal protection for African American voting rights. Although the proposed legislation was supported by President Benjamin Harrison, the bill was blocked by filibustering Democrats in the Senate.

In 1891, he became a member of the Massachusetts Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. He was assigned national membership number 4,901.

That same year, following the lynching of eleven Italian Americans in New Orleans, Lodge published an article blaming the victims and proposing new restrictions on Italian immigration.

Lodge&#x27;s support for voting rights did not extend to women. He was a leading opponent of women&#x27;s suffrage. Lodge did not change his position even after the junior senator from Massachusetts, John Weeks, lost his seat in 1918 due to his opposition to equal suffrage.

===Spanish–American War===
Lodge was a strong backer of U.S. intervention in Cuba in 1898, arguing that it was the moral responsibility of the United States to do so:

Of the sympathies of the American people, generous, liberty-loving, I have no question. They are with the Cubans in their struggle for freedom. I believe our people would welcome any action on the part of the United States to put an end to the terrible state of things existing there. We can stop it. We can stop it peacefully. We can stop it, in my judgment, by pursuing proper diplomacy and offering our good offices. Let it once be understood that we mean to stop the horrible state of things in Cuba and it will be stopped. The great power of the United States, if it is once invoked and uplifted, is capable of greater things than that.

Following American victory in the Spanish–American War, Lodge came to represent the imperialist faction of the Senate, those who called for the annexation of the Philippines. Lodge maintained that the United States needed to have a strong navy and be more involved in foreign affairs. However, Lodge was never on good terms with John Hay, who served as Secretary of State under McKinley and Roosevelt, 1898–1905. They had a bitter fight over the principle of commercial reciprocity with Newfoundland.

In a letter to Theodore Roosevelt, Lodge wrote, &quot;Porto Rico is not forgotten and we mean to have it&quot;.

===Alaska Boundary Dispute===
Henry Cabot Lodge was a politician involved in the Alaska Boundary Dispute during 1896–1903. The border was not clearly labelled in southeast Alaska which started a conflict between Canada and the United States. Canada wanted the Alaska Panhold for its direct route from the Klodndike Gold Rush to the Pacific, and its resources while the United States wanted it for its vital trading and shipping routes. Although Canada lost, the event is still significant as it distinguished the two countries&#x27; political interests. Alaska boundary dispute

===Immigration===
Lodge was a vocal proponent of immigration restrictions, for a number of reasons. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, significant numbers of immigrants, primarily from Eastern and Southern Europe, were migrating to industrial centers in the United States. Lodge argued that unskilled foreign labor was undermining the standard of living for American workers, and that a mass influx of uneducated immigrants would result in social conflict and national decline. In a May 1891 article on Italian immigration, Lodge expressed his concern that immigration by &quot;the races who have peopled the United States&quot; was declining, while &quot;the immigration of people removed from us in race and blood&quot; was on the rise. He considered northern Italians superior candidates for immigration to southern Italians, not only because they tended to be better educated, had a higher standard of living, and had a &quot;higher capacity for skilled work&quot;, but because they were more &quot;Teutonic&quot; than their southern counterparts, whose immigration he sought to restrict.

Lodge was a supporter of &quot;100% Americanism&quot;, a common theme in the nativist movement of the era. In an address to the New England Society of Brooklyn in 1888, Lodge stated:

Let every man honor and love the land of his birth and the race from which he springs and keep their memory green. It is a pious and honorable duty. But let us have done with British-Americans and Irish-Americans and German-Americans, and so on, and all be Americans ... If a man is going to be an American at all let him be so without any qualifying adjectives; and if he is going to be something else, let him drop the word American from his personal description.

He did not believe, however, that all races were equally capable or worthy of being assimilated. In &quot;The Great Peril of Unrestricted Immigration&quot;, he wrote that &quot;you can take a Hindoo and give him the highest education the world can afford ... but you cannot make him an Englishman&quot; and cautioned against the mixing of &quot;higher&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; races:

On the moral qualities of the English-speaking race, therefore, rest our history, our victories, and all our future. There is only one way in which you can lower those qualities or weaken those characteristics, and that is by breeding them out. If a lower race mixes with a higher in sufficient numbers, history teaches us that the lower race will prevail.

As the public voice of the Immigration Restriction League, Lodge argued in support of literacy tests for incoming immigrants. The tests would be designed to exclude members of those races he deemed &quot;most alien to the body of the American people&quot;. He proposed that the United States should temporarily shut out all further entries, particularly persons of low education or skill, to more efficiently assimilate the millions who had already come. From 1907 to 1911, he served on the Dillingham Commission, a joint congressional committee established to study the era&#x27;s immigration patterns and make recommendations to Congress based on its findings. The commission&#x27;s recommendations led to the Immigration Act of 1917.

===World War I===
Lodge was a staunch advocate of entering World War I on the side of the Allied Powers, attacking President Woodrow Wilson for poor military preparedness and accusing pacifists of undermining American patriotism. On April 2, 1917, the day that President Wilson , Lodge and Alexander Bannwart, a pacifist constituent who wanted Lodge to vote against the war, got into a fistfight in the U.S. Capitol. Bannwart was arrested but Lodge opted not to press charges. Bannwart later sued Lodge to have the record corrected; initial news reports suggested that Bannwart hit Lodge first, but Lodge acknowledged in settling the lawsuit that he had hit Bannwart first. This is the only known instance of a U.S. Senator attacking a constituent.

After the United States entered the war, Lodge continued to attack Wilson as hopelessly idealistic, assailing Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points as unrealistic and weak. He contended that Germany needed to be militarily and economically crushed and saddled with harsh penalties so that it could never again be a threat to the stability of Europe. However, apart from policy differences, even before the end of Wilson&#x27;s first term and well before America&#x27;s entry into the Great War, Lodge confided to Teddy Roosevelt, &quot;I never expected to hate anyone in politics with the hatred I feel toward Wilson.&quot; In January 1921, Lodge led the deliberate obstruction of the confirmation of 10,000 presidential Wilson appointments to the War and Navy Departments in the US Senate on the grounds that confirmation of these so-called cabinet &quot;favorite&quot; appointments would embarrass the Harding Administration.

He served as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (1919–1924). He also served as chairman of the Senate Republican Conference from 1918 to 1924. His leadership of the Senate Republicans has led some to retrospectively call him the de facto Senate Majority Leader. During his term in office, he and another powerful senator, Albert J. Beveridge, pushed for the construction of a new navy.

===League of Nations===
In 1919, as the unofficial Senate majority leader, Lodge dealt with the debate over the Treaty of Versailles and the Senate&#x27;s ultimate rejection of the treaty. Lodge wanted to join the League of Nations, but with amendments that would protect American sovereignty.

Lodge appealed to the patriotism of American citizens by objecting to what he saw as the weakening of national sovereignty: &quot;I have loved but one flag and I can not share that devotion and give affection to the mongrel banner invented for a league.&quot; Lodge was reluctant to involve the United States in world affairs in anything less than a pre-eminent role:

The United States is the world&#x27;s best hope, but if you fetter her in the interests and quarrels of other nations, if you tangle her in the intrigues of Europe, you will destroy her power for good, and endanger her very existence. Leave her to march freely through the centuries to come, as in the years that have gone. Strong, generous, and confident, she has nobly served mankind. Beware how you trifle with your marvelous inheritance; this great land of ordered liberty. For if we stumble and fall, freedom and civilization everywhere will go down in ruin.

Lodge was also motivated by political concerns; he strongly disliked Wilson personally and was eager to find an issue for the Republican Party to run on in the presidential election of 1920.

Lodge&#x27;s key objection to the League of Nations was Article X, which required all signatory nations to repel aggression of any kind if ordered to do so by the League. Lodge rejected an open-ended commitment that might subordinate the national security interests of the United States to the demands of the League. He especially insisted that Congress must approve interventions individually; the Senate could not, through treaty, unilaterally agree to enter hypothetical conflicts. Despite Lodge hypocritical whining Article X did not infringe on the right of the United States to make war; Article X &quot;...&quot;required [but did not force] members to assist any other member nation in the event of an invasion or attack...&quot; In fact the intent of Article X was to maintain a Balance of power (international relations) by preventing one nation from attacking another (i.e. Germany attacking Belgium and France in 1914).

The Senate was divided into a &quot;crazy-quilt&quot; of positions on the Versailles question. One block of Democrats strongly supported the Treaty. A second group of Democrats, in line with President Wilson, supported the Treaty and opposed any amendments or reservations. The largest bloc, led by Lodge, comprised a majority of the Republicans. They supported a Treaty with reservations, especially on Article X. Finally, a bi-partisan group of 13 isolationist &quot;irreconcilables&quot; opposed a treaty in any form.

It proved possible to build a majority coalition, but impossible to build a two thirds coalition that was needed to pass a treaty. The closest the Treaty came to passage was in mid-November 1919, when Lodge and his Republicans formed a coalition with the pro-Treaty Democrats, and were close to a two-thirds majority for a Treaty with reservations, but Wilson rejected this compromise.

Cooper and Bailey suggest that Wilson&#x27;s stroke on September 25, 1919, had so altered his personality that he was unable to effectively negotiate with Lodge. Cooper says the psychological effects of a stroke were profound: &quot;Wilson&#x27;s emotions were unbalanced, and his judgment was warped. ... Worse, his denial of illness and limitations was starting to border on delusion.&quot;

The Treaty of Versailles went into effect, but the United States did not sign it and made separate peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary. The United States never joined the League of Nations. Historians agree that the League was ineffective in dealing with major issues, but they debate whether American membership would have made much difference.

Lodge won a posthumous victory in the long run; his reservations were incorporated into the United Nations charter in 1945, with Article X of the League of Nations charter absent and the U.S., as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, given an absolute veto.The US Senate only approved the United States joining the United Nations because of the absence of Article X;Yet the United Nations like the League of Nations has a fatal flaw: it cannot prevent one member nation from attacking another nation. Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., Lodge&#x27;s grandson, served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations from 1953 to 1960.

===Obstruction of Wilson&#x27;s appointments===
In January 1921, Lodge led the deliberate obstruction of the confirmation of 10,000 of President Wilson&#x27;s appointments to the War and Navy Departments in the U.S. Senate on the grounds that confirmation of these so-called cabinet &quot;favorite&quot; appointments would embarrass the Harding Administration.

=== Washington Naval Conference ===
In 1922, President Warren G. Harding appointed Lodge as a delegate to the Washington Naval Conference (International Conference on the Limitation of Armaments), led by Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes, and included Elihu Root and Oscar Underwood. This was the first disarmament conference in history and had a goal of world peace through arms reduction. Attended by nine nations, the United States, Japan, China, France, Great Britain, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Portugal, the conference resulted in three major treaties: Four-Power Treaty, Five-Power Treaty (more commonly known as the Washington Naval Treaty), and the Nine-Power Treaty, as well as a number of smaller agreements.

===Lodge–Fish Resolution===
In June 1922, he introduced the Lodge–Fish Resolution, to illustrate American support for the British policy in Palestine per the 1917 Balfour Declaration.

==Legacy==
Historian George E. Mowry argues that:

Henry Cabot Lodge was one of the best informed statesmen of his time, he was an excellent parliamentarian, and he brought to bear on foreign questions a mind that was at once razor sharp and devoid of much of the moral cant that was so typical of the age. ... [Yet] Lodge never made the contributions he should have made, largely because of Lodge the person. He was opportunistic, selfish, jealous, condescending, supercilious, and could never resist calling his opponent&#x27;s spade a dirty shovel. Small wonder that except for Roosevelt and Root, most of his colleagues of both parties disliked him, and many distrusted him.

Lodge served on the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution for many years. His first appointment was in 1890, as a Member of the House of Representatives, and he served until his election as a senator in 1893. He was reappointed to the Board in 1905 and served until he died in 1924. The other Regents considered Lodge to be a &quot;distinguished colleague, whose keen, constructive interest in the affairs of the Institution led him to place his broad knowledge and large experience at its service at all times.&quot;

Mount Lodge, also named &quot;Boundary Peak 166&quot;, located on the Canada–United States border in the Saint Elias Mountains was named in 1908 after him in recognition of his service as U.S. Boundary Commissioner in 1903.

Lodge was depicted by Sir Cedric Hardwicke in Darryl Zanuck&#x27;s 1944 film &quot;Wilson&quot;, a biography of President Wilson.

==Personal life==
In 1871, he married Anna &quot;Nannie&quot; Cabot Mills Davis, daughter of Admiral Charles Henry Davis. They had three children:

* Constance Davis Lodge (1872–1948), wife of U.S. Representative Augustus Peabody Gardner (from 1892 to 1918) and Brigadier General Clarence Charles Williams (from 1923 to 1948)
* George Cabot Lodge I (1873–1909), a noted poet and politician. George&#x27;s sons, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. (1902–1985) and John Davis Lodge (1903–1985), also became politicians.
* John Ellerton Lodge II (1876–1942), an art curator.

On November 5, 1924, Lodge suffered a severe stroke while recovering in the hospital from surgery for gallstones. He died four days later at the age of 74.
He was interred in the Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

<text>John Lee Anthony Tapia (February 13, 1967 – May 27, 2012) was an American professional boxer who competed from 1988 to 2011. He held multiple world championships in three weight classes, including the unified IBF and WBO super flyweight titles between 1994 and 1998, the unified WBA and WBO bantamweight titles between 1998 and 2000, and the IBF featherweight title in 2002. His 1999 loss by decision to Paulie Ayala was named the Fight of the Year by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine.

Tapia was posthumously inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2017.

==Early life==
Tapia was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico to Mexican American parents. His father had reportedly been murdered while his mother was pregnant with him. When he was eight years old, his mother, Virginia, was kidnapped, raped, repeatedly stabbed, and left dead by her assailant. Raised thereafter by his grandmother, Tapia turned to boxing at the age of nine.

==Amateur career==
Tapia had an outstanding amateur career, winning the 1983 New Mexico State Golden Gloves, the 1983 and 1985 National Golden Gloves tournaments at light flyweight and flyweight, respectively.

==Professional career==

===Super flyweight===

====Early years====
Tapia&#x27;s professional boxing career began on March 25, 1988, when he fought Effren Chavez in Irvine, California. After four rounds of boxing the fight was called a draw. He won eight fights that year, five by knockout, of which four were in the first round.
In 1989, he won seven more fights, including a first-round knockout of Abner Barajas and an eight-round decision against John Michael Johnson.

In 1990, he won seven bouts, including an eight-round decision over Jesus Chong, an eleventh-round technical knockout of Roland Gomez in Reno that gave him the USBA super flyweight title, and a twelve-round decision over Luigi Camputaro, to retain that title. Tapia was, by the end of the year, a known boxer, his name often appearing in magazine articles. However, his career came to a halt for the next three and a half years after being suspended from boxing for testing positive for cocaine.

When he finally returned to the ring on March 27, 1994, he beat Jaime Olvera by a knockout in four rounds in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He won three more fights by knockout, and then he faced Oscar Aguilar on the Michael Carbajal–Josué Camacho undercard in Phoenix for the NABF super flyweight title, winning in three rounds. Five days later the Albuquerque Police claimed they found cocaine after the fight in a bag carried by Tapia. Tapia claimed what the police found was only a soap bar, and the charges were eventually dropped.

====First world title====
On October 12, 1994 at The Pit, Albuquerque, New Mexico, Tapia defeated Henry Martínez in eleven rounds to win the vacant WBO super flyweight title. He then knocked out former champion Rolando Bohol in the second round. In his first title defense, Tapia defeated Jose Rafael Sosa by decision.

He retained the title with a nine-round technical draw with Ricardo Vargas and a decision in twelve against his onetime nemesis in the amateur ranks, Arthur Johnson. After two more wins, he gave Willy Salazar a title shot, knocking him out in nine rounds.
In 1996, he fought six more times, keeping his undefeated record and defending the title five additional times during that period, which included wins against Giovanni Andrade, Ivan Alvarez, future champion Hugo Rafael Soto, Sammy Stewart and Adonis Cruz. By then, a heated rivalry was cooking up between him and IBF champion Danny Romero. Their rivalry had begun many years earlier when Romero&#x27;s father trained both boxers. Tapia&#x27;s split with the Romero family had not been on good terms.

====Tapia vs Romero unification====
1997 saw Tapia fend off a challenge from Jorge Barrera in three rounds. After that, the fight with Romero was set for Las Vegas. The fight took place on July 18. Tapia won by a unanimous twelve-round decision, adding the IBF title to his WBO belt. In his next fight, he defeated Puerto Rico&#x27;s Andy Agosto via decision. Tapia began 1998 by successfully defending his championships for the 11th time against former world champion Rodolfo Blanco of Colombia via decision, and then he vacated his world titles in order to move up in weight.

===Bantamweight===
On December 5, 1998, Tapia defeated WBA bantamweight champion Nana Konadu by decision to become a two-division world champion.

====Tapia vs. Ayala====
In 1999, Tapia suffered his first loss in his 48-bout career, losing a decision and the WBA title to Paulie Ayala in what &quot;The Ring Magazine&quot; called its &quot;Fight of the Year.&quot; Later that year, Tapia tried to commit suicide with a drug overdose and required hospitalization. Back quickly after that, he was given a shot at the WBO title. He became a two time world bantamweight champion by beating Jorge Eliecer Julio by a decision at Albuquerque on January 8, 2000. After he defended his belt with a decision over Javier Torres, a rematch with Ayala to unify the belt was set up. Ayala won by unanimous decision in a fight that ring observers largely felt Tapia won; following the fight, Showtime commentators said that Tapia &quot;put on a clinic&quot; and &quot;something&#x27;s not right,&quot; nearly labeling the decision as rigged.

===Featherweight===
Tapia returned home to prepare for bouts in 2001, when he went up in weight and beat Famosito Gomez by a knockout in six, and former WBC featherweight champion Cesar Soto by knockout in three.

In 2002, Tapia traveled to London, where he knocked out Eduardo Enrique Alvarez in the first round; after the bout, he was interviewed by former rival Romero. Tapia&#x27;s next bout, for the IBF featherweight title, was versus Manuel Medina. Tapia won a dubious decision, becoming a world title holder in three different divisions. He left the title vacant so he could face Lineal &amp; &quot;The Ring&quot; champion Marco Antonio Barrera, who beat Tapia by unanimous decision.

===Comeback===
Tapia returned on the night of October 4, 2003, defeating Carlos Contreras by ten round unanimous decision at Albuquerque.

On April 15, 2005, he sustained an injury to his left eye, but was able to continue and win a repeat match-up with Frankie Archuleta. That win came by ten round split decision in Albuquerque.

At 38, Tapia faced little-known Sandro Marcos in Chicago. In the second round, Marcos connected with a left hook to the body. Tapia fell to the canvas, clutching his ribcage, as referee Genaro Rodriguez reached the count of 10.

===Later career and problems===
On January 17, 2007, Tapia held a press conference stating that he would face Ilido Julio on February 23 in his home town of Albuquerque, New Mexico, then retire. The bout was being promoted as &quot;The Final Fury&quot; and Tapia promised he would win. Tapia won the fight by majority decision, 98–92, 96–94, 95–95.

Tapia was found unconscious and not breathing in a hotel room early on the morning of March 12, 2007. Tapia was hospitalized in critical condition from an apparent cocaine overdose at Albuquerque Presbyterian Hospital.

The next day, on the morning of March 13, Tapia&#x27;s brother-in-law and nephew were killed in an automobile accident on U.S. Highway 550 near Bloomfield, New Mexico, apparently en route to the hospital to visit Tapia. That same day, Tapia was upgraded from critical to serious condition.

Tapia was scheduled to make a comeback on May 2, 2008, in El Paso, Texas, but pulled out due to contractual disputes with promoter Ron Weathers.

On February 11, 2009, Tapia was taken into custody in Albuquerque for a violation of parole related to cocaine use.

Tapia beat Jorge Alberto Reyes by a knockout in the 4th round on March 6, 2010, at the Ohkay Casino, San Juan Pueblo, New Mexico, United States, in front of a sold-out crowd.

==Personal life==
Tapia was married to Teresa Tapia in 1994 and had three boys. The family lived in Albuquerque, NM.

He had many tattoos, which were prominent when he was fighting. One of them said &quot;Mi Vida Loca&quot; (&quot;My Crazy Life&quot;), the nickname he adopted. He wrote an autobiography by that title. He was a born-again Christian.

In 2010, at age 43, Tapia learned that apparently, his father was alive. Jerry Padilla, who Tapia already knew, was supposedly intrigued by the similarities in their mannerisms, and the two decided to submit to a DNA test, which proved they were father and son. After Tapia died in 2012, his widow briefly married his alleged half-brother, Jeffrey Padilla, in 2014. However, she felt it wrong that the senior Padilla had “jokingly” mingled his DNA swabs with Tapia in 2010, getting a court order to compare a new and controlled swab with some of Tapia&#x27;s tissue, proving in 2017 that they were not father and son.

===Death===
On May 27, 2012, Tapia was found dead in his Albuquerque home. He was 45 years old. Tapia died of heart failure.

<doc id="153062" wikidata="Q450984" url="?curid=153062" title="Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.">
<text>Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. (July 5, 1902 – February 27, 1985) was an American diplomat and politician who represented Massachusetts in the United States Senate and served as United States Ambassador to the United Nations in the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1960, he was the Republican nominee for Vice President on a ticket with Richard Nixon, who had served two terms as Eisenhower&#x27;s vice president. The Republican ticket narrowly lost to Democrats John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson; Lodge later served as a diplomat in the administrations of Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Gerald Ford. Lodge was a presidential contender in the 1964 primary campaign.

Born in Nahant, Massachusetts, Lodge was the grandson of Senator Henry Cabot Lodge and the great-grandson of Secretary of State Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen. After graduating from Harvard University, Lodge won election to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He defeated Democratic governor James Michael Curley in 1936 to represent Massachusetts in the United States Senate. He resigned from the Senate in 1944 to serve in Italy and France during World War II. Lodge remained in the Army Reserve after the war and eventually rose to the rank of major general. In 1946, Lodge defeated incumbent Democratic Senator David I. Walsh to return to the Senate.

He led the Draft Eisenhower movement before the 1952 election and managed Eisenhower&#x27;s successful campaign for the Republican presidential nomination at the 1952 Republican National Convention. Eisenhower defeated Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson II in the general election, but Lodge lost his own re-election campaign to then-Congressman Kennedy. Lodge was named as ambassador to the United Nations in 1953 and became a member of Eisenhower&#x27;s Cabinet. Vice President Nixon chose Lodge as his running mate in the 1960 presidential election, but the Republican ticket lost the close election.

In 1963, the now-President Kennedy appointed Lodge to the position of Ambassador to South Vietnam, where Lodge supported the 1963 South Vietnamese coup. In 1964, Lodge won by a plurality a number of that year&#x27;s party presidential primaries and caucuses on the strength of his name, reputation, and respect among many voters, though the nomination went to Barry Goldwater. This effort was encouraged and directed by low-budget but high-impact grassroots campaign by academic and political amateurs. He continued to represent the United States in various countries under Presidents Johnson, Nixon, and Ford. Lodge led the U.S. delegation that signed the Paris Peace Accords with North Vietnam, leading to the end of the Vietnam War. He died in Beverly, Massachusetts, in 1985.

==Early life and education==
Lodge was born in Nahant, Massachusetts. His father was George Cabot Lodge, a poet, through whom he was a grandson of Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, great-great-grandson of Senator Elijah H. Mills, and great-great-great-grandson of Senator George Cabot. Through his mother, Mathilda Elizabeth Frelinghuysen (Davis), he was a great-grandson of Senator Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen, and a great-great-grandson of Senator John Davis. He had two siblings: John Davis Lodge (1903–1985), also a politician, and Helena Lodge de Streel (1905–1998).

Lodge attended St. Albans School and graduated from Middlesex School. In 1924, he graduated cum laude from Harvard College, where he was a member of the Hasty Pudding and the Fox Club.

Lodge worked in the newspaper business from 1924 to 1931. He was elected in 1932, and served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1933 to 1936.

==U.S. senator (1937–1944, 1947–1953) and World War II service (1944–1945)==
In November 1936, Lodge was elected to the United States Senate as a Republican, defeating Democrat James Michael Curley. He served from January 1937 to February 1944.

===World War II===
Lodge served with distinction during the war, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel. During the war he saw two tours of duty. The first was in 1942 while he was also serving as a U.S. senator. The second was in 1944 and 1945 after he resigned from the Senate.

The first period was a continuation of Lodge&#x27;s longtime service as an Army Reserve officer. Lodge was a major in the 1st Armored Division. That tour ended in July 1942, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered congressmen serving in the military to resign one of the two positions, and Lodge, who chose to remain in the Senate, was ordered by Secretary of War Henry Stimson to return to Washington. During this brief service, he led a squadron of American tankers at Gazala; they were the first Americans to engage German troops on land in the war.

After returning to Washington and winning re-election in November 1942, Lodge went to observe allied troops serving in Egypt and Libya, and in that position, he was on hand for the British retreat from Tobruk.

Lodge served the first year of his new Senate term but then resigned his Senate seat on February 3, 1944, in order to return to active duty, the first U.S. senator to do so since the Civil War. He saw action in Italy and France.

In the fall of 1944, Lodge single-handedly captured a four-man German patrol.

At the end of the war, in 1945, he used his knowledge of the French language and culture, gained from attending school in Paris, to aid Jacob L. Devers, the commander of the Sixth United States Army Group, to coordinate activities with the French First Army commander, Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, and then carry out surrender negotiations with German forces in western Austria.

Lodge was decorated with the French Legion of Honor and Croix de Guerre with palm. His American decorations included the Legion of Merit and the Bronze Star Medal.

After the war, Lodge returned to Massachusetts and resumed his political career. He continued his status as an Army Reserve officer and rose to the rank of major general.

===Return to Senate and the drafting of Eisenhower===
In 1946 Lodge defeated Democratic Senator David I. Walsh and returned to the Senate. He soon emerged as a spokesman for the moderate, internationalist wing of the Republican Party. After World War II, which Lodge believed was in part caused by American isolationism, he came to advocate internationalism, saying: &quot;The ideal of a provincial nation has given way to the realization that we have become the world&#x27;s greatest power ... World War II first taught us the value of collective security.&quot;

In March 1950, Lodge sat on a subcommittee of the Government Operations Committee, chaired by Democratic Senator Millard Tydings, which looked into Senator Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s list of possibly communist State Department employees. Lodge argued in hearings that Tydings demonized McCarthy and whitewashed McCarthy&#x27;s supposed discovery of security leaks at the State Department. Lodge told Tydings:

Mr. Chairman, this is the most unusual procedure I have seen in all the years I have been here. Why cannot the senator from Wisconsin get the normal treatment and be allowed to make his statement in his own way, ... and not be pulled to pieces before he has had a chance to offer one single consecutive sentence. ... I do not understand what kind of game is being played here.

In July 1950, the record of the committee hearing was printed, and Lodge was outraged to find that 35 pages were not included. Lodge noted that his objections to the conduct of the hearing and his misgivings about the inadequacy of vetting suspected traitors were missing, and that the edited version read as if all committee members agreed that McCarthy was at fault and that there was no Communist infiltration of the State Department. Lodge stated &quot;I shall not attempt to characterize these methods of leaving out of the printed text parts of the testimony and proceedings ... because I think they speak for themselves.&quot; Lodge soon fell out with McCarthy and joined the effort to reduce McCarthy&#x27;s influence.

In late 1951, Lodge helped persuade General Dwight D. Eisenhower to run for the Republican presidential nomination. When Eisenhower finally consented, Lodge served as his campaign manager and played a key role in helping Eisenhower to win the nomination over Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio, the candidate of the party&#x27;s conservative faction. Taft favored a quasi-isolationist foreign policy, being opposed to American membership in NATO and the United Nations, and Lodge wanted Eisenhower to run in order to pull the GOP away from Taft&#x27;s ideology. Gossip talk of the day said that he reportedly declined an offer to be Ike&#x27;s running mate.

===1952 Senate campaign===
In the fall of 1952, Lodge found himself fighting in a tight race for re-election with John F. Kennedy, then a U.S. Representative. His efforts in helping Eisenhower caused Lodge to neglect his own campaign. In addition, some of Taft&#x27;s supporters in Massachusetts defected from Lodge to the Kennedy campaign out of anger over Lodge&#x27;s support of Eisenhower. In November 1952 Lodge was defeated by Kennedy; Lodge received 48.5% of the vote to Kennedy&#x27;s 51.5%. This was the second of three Senate elections contested between a member of the Republican Lodge family and a member of the Democratic Fitzgerald-Kennedy clan, after the 1916 election between Lodge&#x27;s and Kennedy&#x27;s grandfathers and before the 1962 special election between Lodge&#x27;s son and Kennedy&#x27;s younger brother Ted.

Kennedy was congratulated for his victory by his dominating father, Joseph Kennedy Sr, saying at long last an Irish Catholic had humbled a scion of the WASP Boston Brahmin elite, saying that this was the most satisfying of all his son&#x27;s electoral victories. It was neither the first nor the last time a Lodge faced a Kennedy in a Massachusetts election.

==Ambassador to the United Nations (1953–1960)==
Lodge was named U.S. ambassador to the United Nations by President Eisenhower in February 1953, with his office elevated to Cabinet-level rank. In contrast to his grandfather (who had been a principal opponent of the UN&#x27;s predecessor, the League of Nations), Lodge was supportive of the UN as an institution for promoting peace. As he famously said about it, &quot;This organization is created to prevent you from going to hell. It isn&#x27;t created to take you to heaven.&quot; Since then, no one has even approached his record of seven and a half years as ambassador to the UN. During his time as UN Ambassador, Lodge supported the Cold War policies of the Eisenhower administration, and often engaged in debates with the UN representatives of the Soviet Union. Lodge often appeared on television &quot;talking tough&quot; to Soviet diplomats, and famously responded to the charge that the United States was responsible for aggression around the world by saying: &quot;Membership in the United Nations gives every member the right to make a fool of himself, and that is the right of which the Soviet Union, in this case, has taken full advantage of.&quot;

During the CIA-sponsored overthrowing of the legitimate Guatemalan government, when Britain and France became concerned about the US being involved in the aggression, Lodge (as US Ambassador to the United Nations) threatened to withdraw US support to Britain on Egypt and Cyprus, and to France on Tunisia and Morocco, unless they backed the US in their action. When the government was overthrown, the United Fruit Company, of which Lodge was a significant stockholder, re-established itself in Guatemala. The episodes tainted an otherwise distinguished career and painted Lodge as a face of US imperialism and exceptionalism.

In 1959, he escorted Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev on a highly publicized tour of the United States. In 1960 he embarked on a reciprocal tour of the Soviet Union, including stops at the Bibi-Khanym Mosque in Samarkand. 
== 1960 vice presidential campaign ==

Lodge left the UN ambassadorship, turning over his seat to Deputy Chief Jerry Wadsworth during the election of 1960 to run for Vice President on the Republican ticket headed by Richard Nixon, against Lodge&#x27;s old foe, John F. Kennedy. Before choosing Lodge, Nixon had also considered Representative Walter Judd of Minnesota and Senator Thruston B. Morton of Kentucky. Eisenhower had supported the chocie of Lodge. Nixon finally settled on Lodge in the mistaken hope that Lodge&#x27;s presence on the ticket would force Kennedy to divert time and resources to securing his Massachusetts base, but Kennedy won his home state handily. Nixon also felt that the name Lodge had made for himself in the United Nations as a foreign policy expert would prove useful against the relatively inexperienced Kennedy. Nixon and Lodge lost the election in a razor-thin vote.

The choice of Lodge proved to be questionable. He did not carry his home state for Nixon. Also, some conservative Republicans charged that Lodge had cost the ticket votes, particularly in the South, by his pledge (made without Nixon&#x27;s approval) that if elected, Nixon would name at least one African American to a Cabinet post. He suggested appointing the diplomat Ralph Bunche as a &quot;wonderful idea&quot;. Nixon was furious at Lodge for this pledge, and accused him of spending too much time campaigning with minority groups, instead of the white majority. One Republican from West Virginia said of Lodge&#x27;s speech: &quot;Whoever recommended that Harlem speech should have been thrown out of an airplane at 25,000 feet&quot;.

Between 1961 and 1962, Lodge was the first director-general of the Atlantic Institute.

==Ambassador to South Vietnam (1963–1964)==
Kennedy appointed Lodge ambassador to South Vietnam, which he held from 1963 to 1964. Lodge&#x27;s appointment came as Kennedy began to lose confidence in South Vietnam&#x27;s President Ngô Đình Diệm, particularly after Diệm denied culpability for the Huế Phật Đản shootings and instead blamed the Viet Cong. As the current ambassador, Frederick Nolting, was a partisan of Diệm, Kennedy felt it was time for a new ambassador who would be tough on Diệm in a way that Nolting never could be. Furthermore, Nolting had considered it his duty to silence unfavourable press coverage of Diệm, causing him to feud with reporters who wrote that the Diem regime was corrupt and unpopular. On June 27, 1963, Kennedy named Lodge as his ambassador to South Vietnam. Lodge had visited Vietnam as a newsman in the 1930s, and though he spoke no Vietnamese, he was fluent in French, a language widely used by the South Vietnamese elite. More importantly, Kennedy was haunted by the way that the &quot;loss of China&quot; had badly damaged the Truman administration, and feeling that South Vietnam might likewise now be lost, wanted a well-known Republican politician as his ambassador in South Vietnam to shield him from potential Republican attacks that he &quot;lost&quot; South Vietnam.

Kennedy had chosen Lodge because he knew he would accept. The Cabot Lodges were one of the most distinguished Boston Brahmin families with a long history of public service, and that given his pride in his family&#x27;s history, Lodge would never turn down an opportunity to serve the United States. Lodge for his part believed that if he was successful as an ambassador to an important American ally in the middle of a crisis, that would help his presidential ambitions. When Kennedy asked Lodge if he was willing to serve as an ambassador, Lodge replied: &quot;If you need me, of course, I want to do it&quot;. Eisenhower warned Lodge against taking the job, believing that Kennedy only offered Republicans the more difficult jobs to damage their reputations. Despite Eisenhower&#x27;s advice, Lodge told him that he felt it was his patriotic duty to accept, saying that the Cabot Lodges had always served the United States regardless if the president was a Democrat or a Republican, and he was not going to break with his family&#x27;s traditions.

Lodge arrived in Saigon on August 22, 1963, finding a city gripped by protests in response to the Xá Lợi Pagoda raids that had taken place the night before. Thrust into the crisis, Lodge received a cable from Kennedy demanding to know what was going on, and in his reply Lodge wrote that Ngô Đình Nhu had ordered the raids &quot;probably&quot; with the &quot;full support&quot; of Diem. In his first press conference, Lodge gave a roistering talk about the freedom of the press, earning cheers from the reporters who resented Nolting&#x27;s attempts to silence them. Knowing that Lodge had been sent to Saigon to be tough with Diem, some of the reporters taunted South Vietnamese officials present by saying: &quot;Our new mandarin is going to lick your old mandarin&quot;. One of Lodge&#x27;s first acts as ambassador was to visit the Agency for International Development (AID) office in Saigon, where two Buddhist monks had taken refuge, and to whom he agreed to grant asylum. When Lodge learned that the two monks were vegetarians, he ordered the AID workers to bring them only vegetables and fruits.

Ever since July 1963, a group of senior South Vietnamese generals had been in contact with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), asking for American support for a coup d&#x27;état. Lodge advised caution, saying a coup would be a &quot;shot in the dark&quot;. On August 26, Lodge arrived at the Gia Long Palace to present his credentials to President Diem. As Lodge spoke no Vietnamese and Diem no English, they talked in French. Lodge had a very poor working relationship with Diem, as both men were from wealthy and distinguished families and too used to having others defer to them. Lodge gave Diem a list of reforms to carry out such as his dismissing Nhu; silencing his abrasive and bombastic wife, Madame Nhu; trying the officials responsible for the shootings in Hue; and providing greater religious tolerance, all of which were anathema to Diem. 

=== Role in the 1963 coup d&#x27;état ===

Lodge quickly determined that Diem was both inept and corrupt, and that South Vietnam was headed for disaster unless Diem reformed his administration or was replaced. On August 29 Lodge wrote in a cable: &quot;We are launched on a course from where there is no respectable turning back: the overthrow of the Diem government. There is no turning back because U.S. prestige is already publicly committed to this end in large measure, and will become more so as the facts leak out. In a more fundamental sense, there is no turning back because there is no possibility, in my view, that the war can be won under a Diem administration&quot;.

Lodge, noting that the South Vietnamese Army was completely reliant upon American military aid, demanded that Kennedy halt all such aid as long as Diem was president, and to make an &quot;all-out effort&quot; to have the mutinous generals &quot;move promptly&quot;, as the outcome of the coup would depend &quot;at least as much on us as them&quot;. Lodge warned that to allow Diem to continue would lead to a popular revolt that would bring in a &quot;pro-Communist or at best neutralist set of politicians&quot;. At the same time, French President Charles de Gaulle had launched a major diplomatic initiative to end the war in Vietnam that called for a federation of North and South Vietnam, and for both Vietnams to be neutral in the Cold War. Lodge was opposed to the peace plan, as he saw the proposed neutralization of South Vietnam as no different from Communist control of South Vietnam.

Kennedy accepted Lodge&#x27;s recommendations and gave him &quot;carte blanche&quot; to manage the affairs in Vietnam as he best saw fit, and gave him the power to cut off American aid if necessary. Just why Kennedy delegated such to Lodge has remained a matter of debate. Historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. later wrote Lodge was &quot;a strong man with the bit between his teeth&quot; whom Kennedy could not manage. In contrast, journalist Stanley Karnow speculated that Kennedy having embraced and praised Diem preferred that the &quot;messy job&quot; of overthrowing him be contracted out to Lodge, all the more so as there was always the possibility that the coup might fail, in which case the president would blame a &quot;rogue ambassador&quot;.

On October 5, Lodge cabled back to Kennedy that he learned that the generals were finally ready to proceed. The CIA officer, Lucien Conein met with General Dương Văn Minh, who asked that the United States &quot;not thwart&quot; a coup and promise to continue to provide the aid worth about $500 million per year after Diem was overthrown. Lodge seized upon Minh&#x27;s remark to argue to Kennedy that the United States should promise that it &quot;will not attempt to thwart&quot; a coup, a formula that Kennedy embraced. Lodge himself later used this line as a defence against criticism, saying he did not promise to support a coup, only &quot;not thwart&quot; it.

Kennedy had his National Security Adviser, McGeorge Bundy, send Lodge a cable on October 25 saying that the United States should abandon the coup if there were &quot;poor prospects of success&quot;. Lodge in reply maintained &quot;it seems at least an even bet that the next government would not bungle and fumble as the present one has&quot;. Lodge also argued to stop a coup would be to take on &quot;an undue responsibility for keeping the incumbents in office&quot;, which was a &quot;judgment over the affairs of Vietnam&quot;. In the next sentence, he ignored his principle of noninterference in South Vietnamese internal affairs by suggesting that in a post-Diem cabinet should include Tran Quoc Buu, a trade union leader who had long been funded by the CIA, and the Buddhist leader Tri Quang, who had impressed Lodge with his anticommunism. On October 28, Lodge sent a dispatch to Kennedy saying a coup was &quot;imminent&quot;, and that he would have only four hours notice before the coup started, which &quot;rules out my checking with you&quot;.

On October 29, Kennedy called a meeting of the National Security Council (NSC) to discuss what to do. Persuaded by Robert Kennedy — his younger brother, Attorney General and right-hand man — President Kennedy changed his mind and decided against the coup. Writing on behalf of Kennedy, Bundy sent a message to Lodge warning the possibility of a civil war between pro-Diem and anti-Diem forces &quot;could be serious or even disastrous for U.S. interests&quot;. Lodge was ordered to have Conein tell General Trần Văn Đôn that &quot;we do not find that the presently revealed plans give a clear prospect of quick results&quot; and to put General Paul D. Harkins in charge of the embassy in Saigon when the ambassador was due to leave shortly for a meeting in Washington.

Lodge ignored this order from Bundy, stating in his reply that to have Harkins in charge of the embassy during an event &quot;so profoundly political as a change of government&quot; would violate the principle that the serving officers of the U.S. armed forces must always be non-political. He further argued that the only way of stopping the coup would be to inform Diem which officers had been plotting against him which would &quot;make traitors out of us&quot; and destroy the &quot;civilian and military leadership needed to carry the war ... to its successful conclusion&quot; as Diem would have the rebel officers all shot. Lodge told Kennedy that when the coup started, he would grant asylum to Diem and the rest of the Ngo family should they ask for it, but felt that to stop the coup would be interference in South Vietnam&#x27;s internal affairs. Lodge also argued that the money should be &quot;discreetly&quot; provided to the plotters to &quot;buy off potential opposition&quot; and for the United States to immediately recognize a post-Diem government. Finally, he argued that was needed for South Vietnam was &quot;nation-building&quot;. Lodge wrote: &quot;My general view is that the United States is trying bring this medieval country into the twentieth century ... We have made considerable progress in military and economic ways, but to gain victory we must also bring them into the twentieth century politically, and that can only be done by either a thoroughgoing change in the behaviour of the present government or another government&quot;. Faced with stark warnings from Lodge that the majority of the South Vietnamese people hated the Ngo family and there no possibility of a victory over the Viet Cong as long as Diem continued in power, Kennedy changed his mind yet again. In his final message to Lodge, Kennedy wrote: &quot;If you should conclude that there is not clearly a high prospect of success, you should communicate this doubt to the generals in a way calculated to persuade them to desist at least until chances are better ... But once a coup under responsible leadership has begun ... it is in the interest of the U.S. government that it should succeed&quot;. Kennedy had essentially abdicated responsibility by leaving the final decision about whatever to back a coup to Lodge, who had no doubts in his mind that a coup was the best course of action.

On November 1, 1963, at about 10 am, Lodge visited the Gia Long Palace to meet Diem who gave him a two-hour-long lecture about American ingratitude towards his regime. At about noon, Lodge returned to the embassy for lunch. At about 1 pm, the coup began. Later that day, the Ngo brothers secretly fled into Cholon, the Chinese district of Saigon. Lodge attempted to get into touch with Diem with the aim of arranging for him to go into exile, but it was unclear just where he was, as Diem kept claiming that he was still at the Gia Long Palace. Finally, Diem revealed in a phone call to Đôn that he and his brother were at Saint Francis Xavier, and was willing to go into exile provided he, his brother and their families were promised safe conduct. Despite the promise of safe conduct, the Ngo brothers were shot in the armored personnel carrier that was supposed to take them to the airport. Lodge invited the generals to the embassy to congratulate them for what he saw as a job well done. In a cable to Kennedy, he wrote: &quot;The prospects now are for a shorter war&quot;.

=== After the coup ===
On November 24, 1963, two days after Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, Lodge arrived in Washington to meet the new president, Lyndon Johnson. Johnson told Lodge he would not &quot;lose&quot; Vietnam, saying &quot;tell those generals in Saigon that Lyndon Johnson intends to stand by our word&quot;. After Diem&#x27;s assassination, Lodge seems to have lost interest in Vietnam as he became increasingly lethargic in performing his duties as ambassador. After his high hopes that Diem&#x27;s removal would spark improvements, he reported that the new leader, General Dương Văn Minh, was a &quot;good, well intentioned man&quot;, but asked &quot;Will he be strong enough to get on top of things?&quot; In December 1963, the Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, visited South Vietnam where he reported the American team in Saigon &quot;lacks leadership, has been poorly informed and is not working to a common plan&quot;. McNamara described a dysfunctional atmosphere at the embassy as Lodge was still feuding with Harkins and had blocked him from using the embassy&#x27;s cable room to communicate with Washington. Lodge distrusted the diplomats at the embassy, and was noted for his secretive ways.

The coup sparked a rapid succession of leaders in South Vietnam, each unable to rally and unify their people and in turn overthrown by someone new. These frequent changes in leadership caused political instability in the South, since no strong, centralized and permanent government was in place to govern the nation, while the Viet Minh stepped up their infiltration of the Southern populace and their pace of attacks in the South. Having supported the coup against President Diem, Lodge then realized it had caused the situation in the region to deteriorate, and he suggested to the State Department that South Vietnam should be made to relinquish its independence and become a protectorate of the United States (like the former status of the Philippines) so as to bring governmental stability. The alternatives, he warned, were either increased military involvement by the U.S. or total abandonment of South Vietnam by America.

In June 1964, Lodge resigned as ambassador to run to seek the Republican nomination to be the presidential candidate for the election of that year. Lodge had been unpopular with his embassy staff, and most were happy to see him go.

== 1964 presidential candidacy ==

Despite their defeat in 1960, neither Nixon&#x27;s nor Lodge&#x27;s national profiles were damaged, with both being speculated candidates for the 1964 presidential election. Lodge made the &quot;Most Admired Men&quot; list for 1962 and led major candidates such as George Romney and Nelson Rockefeller in Republican presidential polling.

In 1962 after helping campaign for his son George C. Lodge in the Senate race Paul Grindle, the nephew of Senator Leverett Saltonstall who had filled Lodge&#x27;s seat after his resignation to join World War II, along with Sally Saltonstall, Caroline Williams, and David Goldberg opened a Lodge for President office in Boston, but in 1964 was forced to shut down after failing to prove any affiliation with Lodge. However, Grindle relocated to Concord, New Hampshire. The organization acquired a mailing list of 96,000 Republican voters which successfully established a base for Lodge in New Hampshire. Footage of former President Eisenhower endorsing Lodge for vice president in 1960 was used in TV commercials and portrayed as Eisenhower endorsing Lodge for president. Three days before the March 10 New Hampshire primary Goldwater chose to stop campaigning in the state as he predicted a victory for himself with a substantial number of votes for Lodge.

In 1964, Lodge, while still Ambassador to South Vietnam, was the surprise write-in victor in the Republican New Hampshire primary, defeating declared presidential candidates Barry Goldwater and Nelson Rockefeller. His entire campaign was organized by a small band of political amateurs working independently of the ambassador, who, believing they had little hope of winning him any delegates, did nothing to aid their efforts. However, when they scored the New Hampshire upset, Lodge, along with the press and Republican party leaders, suddenly began to seriously consider his candidacy. Many observers remarked on the situation&#x27;s similarity to 1952, when Eisenhower had unexpectedly defeated Senator Robert A. Taft, then leader of the Republican Party&#x27;s conservative faction. However, Lodge (who refused to become an open candidate) did not fare as well in later primaries, and Goldwater ultimately won the presidential nomination. Like most liberal Republicans, Lodge opposed Goldwater, particularly his proposal to realign the Democratic and Republican parties into Liberal and Conservative parties, calling it &quot;abhorrent&quot;, and felt that nobody should oppose the aid of the federal government in helping Americans. At one point during the convention, Lodge was confronted by a staunch Goldwater supporter who called him terrible for opposing Goldwater. In reply, Lodge said: &quot;You&#x27;re terrible, too.&quot;

==Later diplomatic career (1965–1977)==

He was re-appointed ambassador to South Vietnam by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965, and served thereafter as Ambassador-at-large (1967–1968) and Ambassador to West Germany (1968–1969). In 1969, when his former running mate Richard M. Nixon finally became president, Nixon having decided not to reselect him as his running mate, he was appointed by President Nixon to serve as head of the American delegation at the Paris peace negotiations, and he served occasionally as personal representative of the President to the Holy See from 1970 to 1977.

==Personal life==

In 1926, Lodge married Emily Esther Sears. They had two children: George Cabot Lodge II (born 1927) and Henry Sears Lodge (1930–2017). George worked in the federal civil service and is now professor emeritus at Harvard Business School.

Henry Sears married Elenita Ziegler of New York City and was a former sales executive. Henry&#x27;s son, Henry Sears Lodge Jr., MD, (1958–2017) was a physician at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and became well known as the author of the &#x27;Younger Next Year&#x27; series of books.

In 1966 he was elected an honorary member of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati.

Lodge died in 1985 after a long illness and was interred in the Mount Auburn Cemetery in Watertown, Massachusetts. Two years after Lodge&#x27;s death, Sears married Forrester A. Clark. She died in 1992 of lung cancer and is interred near her first husband in the Cabot Lodge family columbarium.
