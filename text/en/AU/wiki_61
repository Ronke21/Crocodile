<text>Nothing Records was an American record label specializing in industrial rock and electronic music, founded by John Malm Jr. and Trent Reznor in 1992. It is considered an example of a vanity label, where an artist is able to run a label with some small degree of independence within a larger parent company, in this case the larger company being Interscope Records.

Nothing Records went largely defunct in 2004, after a lawsuit by Reznor against John Malm. The label became inactive as a whole following several further releases; 2007&#x27;s &quot;Beside You in Time&quot; music video was the label&#x27;s final release.

== Background ==
Nothing Records is most famous for its two original signings, Trent Reznor&#x27;s own band Nine Inch Nails, and Marilyn Manson.

The label gained semi-iconic status within the industrial rock scene, and even acquired its own online-fanzine in &quot;Sick Among the Pure&quot;, although this later became a more general industrial fanzine, and ceased to exist at all in 2005. The Nothing label would often reward its fanbase over the Internet — one form of this outreach was Radio Nothing: an exclusive collection of free MP3 music streams, compiled by Nothing label artists, producers and fans.

In September 2004, coinciding with Trent Reznor leaving New Orleans for the west coast, the Nine Inch Nails website announced &quot;nothing studios: 1994-2004&quot;, suggesting that Nothing Studios was closed. This later proved to be the end of the associated record label as well. Speculation among listeners that the label could continue ceased when Reznor successfully sued co-founder John Malm for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty (amongst others), ensuring that the Nothing era was over.

In a May 5, 2005 post to nin.com, Trent wrote, &quot;To be clear: my involvement with Nothing Records is over. Is Nothing Records alive or an entity? You&#x27;d have to ask John Malm (we&#x27;re not really speaking that much these days) ... Nothing studios is still in New Orleans and I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ll do with it. I&#x27;ll figure that out when I finish touring.&quot;

While &quot;With Teeth&quot; and its following singles carry the Nothing Records logo, Reznor has publicly stated that this was at the insistence of John Malm.

&quot;Beside You In Time&quot; (February 2007) was the last release to carry the Nothing Records logo on its packaging. The logo also appears in the end credits.

The &quot;Survivalism&quot; single is the first Nine Inch Nails release not to be released with the Nothing Records logo.

Since early 2004, the official website, NothingRecords.com, has been closed down.

==Artists==
In addition to Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson, the label also signed and released albums from 2wo, Pig, Pop Will Eat Itself, Prick, 12 Rounds, Einstürzende Neubauten, The The, and Meat Beat Manifesto. Additionally, Coil was under contract for a record but it was never delivered (though some of the songs from the slated Nothing album appeared in reworked form on &quot;The Ape of Naples&quot; and &quot;The New Backwards&quot;). The album &quot;Backwards&quot; was eventually released in 2015 by Cold Spring Records. John Bergin was also signed briefly under the name Trust Obey, but the album he recorded (&quot;Hands of Ash&quot;) was instead released in 1996 on Fifth Colvmn Records with a sticker that quoted Reznor&#x27;s reaction to the completed work: &quot;Not a great commercial potential.&quot;

Nothing also distributed music from Warp Records, Sheffield, England&#x27;s venerable electronic music label, under an exclusive license in the U.S., with albums by Autechre, Plaid, and Squarepusher (although Warp&#x27;s Aphex Twin appeared on the &quot;Further Down the Spiral&quot; release, he was already under a contract with Sire Records in the U.S. at the time). This distribution deal ended when Warp expanded operations into the U.S. market in 2001. Nothing also managed to secure the U.S. release of two albums from England&#x27;s Blue Planet Recordings. The two albums were slightly different than the UK releases. Plug&#x27;s &quot;Drum and Bass for Papa&quot; included an extra disc of tracks from earlier EPs, and The Bowling Green&#x27;s &quot;One Pound Note&quot; omitted one track from the UK release due to problems with sample clearance.

== 1992-94: Early years ==
Nothing Records was founded by Trent Reznor and his former manager John Malm Jr. in 1992. Amid pressure from Nine Inch Nails&#x27; then-label TVT to produce a follow-up to &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;, Reznor began to feel the label was hindering his control of the band and requested to terminate their contract, to which they ignored his plea. In response, Reznor secretly began recording under various pseudonyms to avoid record company interference. TVT ultimately put together a deal with Interscope Records (then part of Atlantic Records), in which they would still retain some financial stake, while Reznor worked creatively under a new label. However, Interscope President Jimmy Iovine looked to allow him more creative freedom. Reznor stated:

Part of the deal included allowing Reznor the run his own boutique label under the Interscope umbrella, which became Nothing Records. Reznor and Malm began a series of signings to the label, which included the likes of Marilyn Manson, Coil, Prick, Trust Obey, Pop Will Eat Itself and Mondo Vanilli. Reznor stated of the label, &quot;The whole thing I want to do right now is provide a shell to other bands where they can have the benefit of a major label without being fucked with creatively in any way. Let them do what they want to do, make them aware of the business side of things how the money is spent.&quot; The label would go on to set up offices in Cleveland, Ohio and New York City, with a recording studio, Nothing Studios, in New Orleans.

=== Nine Inch Nails (Broken era) ===
The first release bearing the label&#x27;s name was Nine Inch Nails&#x27; &quot;Broken&quot; EP. Released September 22, 1992, the EP marked their major label debut and consisted entirely of new material, departing from the electronica and synthpop style of &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; and instead presenting a considerably heavier sound, which would act as a precursor for Nine Inch Nails&#x27; acclaimed second studio album, &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;. The EP originally included a bonus 3&quot; CD or 7&quot; vinyl, depending which format was purchased, featuring two bonus songs; a cover of the Adam and the Ants song &quot;Physical&quot; and &quot;Suck,&quot; a reworked version of a song Trent originally recorded with Pigface. Later pressings of the release merged these tracks as a single release, although a 2017 vinyl repress by the band once again pressed them as a separate 7&quot;.

The Broken film accompanied the EP, directed by Coil&#x27;s Peter Christopherson. Reznor recalled, &quot;Making the &quot;Broken&quot; movie was a lot of fun. There was no label involvement or pressure from anyone, it was just he (Christopherson) and I talking. At the completion of filming, Christopherson felt the footage was so realistic, he informed Reznor, &quot;I&#x27;m going to send it to you, but it&#x27;s going to show up in a paper bag unmarked because there could be ... I&#x27;m not sure I want the authorities knowing this came from me.&quot; After reviewing the film, Reznor stated, &quot;It felt like we&#x27;d crossed over into territory that was perhaps too far. And to be honest, at that point I was living in the Sharon Tate house recording &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;. Anyway, that&#x27;s where I was living when this package turned up, and I thought, &#x27;Enough. I don&#x27;t know that I need this kind of thing.&#x27; With the house it felt too stunty, and Peter agreed.&quot;

Five of the eight total tracks were edited down into music videos, were widely censored from television airplay, due to their disturbing content. The complete, uncensored film was never officially released, however it was leaked as a bootleg, which became heavily traded on VHS in the 1990s and later became widely available via the Internet. &quot;We shelved it, but little did we know that the Internet would come into existence, and it would find its home on there,&quot; stated Reznor. Most of the film&#x27;s content was later included on the release of the band&#x27;s 1997 VHS &quot;Closure&quot;. In 2006, an unofficial version of the film was released on a DVD disc image and distributed via BitTorrent at The Pirate Bay by an anonymous user called &quot;seed0,&quot; who also uploaded a DVD version of &quot;Closure&quot;. The DVD image represented a significant upgrade in visual and audio quality from previous bootlegs and included the video for &quot;Help Me I Am in Hell.&quot; It is widely believed by fans that Reznor himself was behind the 2006 leaks, as implied by a post on his official blog: &quot;12/21/06 : Happy Holidays! This one is a guilt-free download. (shhhh - I didn&#x27;t say that out loud). If you know what I&#x27;m talking about, cool.&quot;

Contributing to the band&#x27;s growing mainstream success, the EP sold well upon release, peaking at number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts and eventually going platinum &quot;Wish&quot; won the 1993 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance, as did &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot; (live performance at Woodstock &#x27;94) in 1996. Despite their increasing commercial success, Trent opted against touring in support of the EP, choosing instead to remain at work in the studio.

A companion remix EP, &quot;Fixed&quot;, was released on December 7, 1992 and featured remixes from the band, as well as J. G. Thirlwell of Foetus, Butch Vig of Garbage and future Nothing label-mates Coil. An additional Butch Vig remix of &quot;Last&quot; was omitted from the EP, although the outro can be heard on &quot;Throw This Away.&quot; The complete Vig remix circulated on the Internet as a bootleg file, until Reznor finally released it at remix.nin.com. Vig later addressed the reason for its omission, stating &quot;I started recording a lot of new parts, and took it in a much different direction. When it was finished, Trent thought the front part of the mix didn&#x27;t fit the EP, so he just used the ending. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s on his website. Duke and Steve worked with me on the remix, in the very early days of Garbage.&quot;

=== Nine Inch Nails (The Downward Spiral era) ===
After &quot;Broken&quot;, Reznor began recording Nine Inch Nails&#x27; full-length debut for the Nothing / Interscope Records label, the seminal sophomore album, &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;. For the recording of &quot;Broken&quot;, Reznor had moved into 10050 Cielo Drive in Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles, where actress Sharon Tate was murdered by members of the Manson Family. He named the home studio &quot;Le Pig&quot;. Reznor would record &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; at Le Pig, co-producing it with Flood. The recordings were inspired by concept albums such as David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Low&quot; and Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot;. Guitarist Richard Patrick had left the band after touring completed for &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;, moving on to form his own band, Filter. Adrian Belew would take over guitar duties for much of the album, while Robin Finck would become the full-time guitarist for the band.

The first single from the album, &quot;March of the Pigs,&quot; was released on February 25, 1994. The single featured remixes by Dave Ogilvie, as well as an exclusive instrumental, entitled &quot;A Violet Fluid&quot;. A pair of music videos for the song were also shot. The first version was ultimately scrapped, while the second and final version was directed by Coil&#x27;s Peter Christopherson. Portions of the original, incomplete video eventually surfaced as part of an online, DVD disc image version of the &quot;Closure&quot; DVD in 2006, which surfaced on BitTorrent website The Pirate Bay.

&quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; was released on March 8, 1994. The album was an immediate success, debuting at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with sales of nearly 119,000 copies in its first week. It also garnered wide, critical acclaim, helping elevate Nine Inch Nails into one of the most successful rock acts of the 1990s. &quot;Closer&quot; became the second single for the album, released on May 30, 1994. The single included remixes from Nothing Records acts Coil and Meat Beat Manifesto, as well as an exclusive cover of Soft Cell&#x27;s &quot;Memorabilia.&quot; A music video for &quot;Closer&quot; was directed by Mark Romanek. Despite undergoing heavy censorship for television and radio airplay, the song received major airplay, becoming one of the biggest hits of NIN&#x27;s career. The uncensored version of the music video was eventually released in 1997 on the band&#x27;s &quot;Closure&quot; home video. &quot;Piggy&quot; and &quot;Hurt&quot; were both released as promotional singles to radio and received regular airplay. Nine Inch Nails also recorded a pair of exclusive songs for soundtracks. A cover of Joy Division&#x27;s &quot;Dead Souls was released on the soundtrack to &quot;The Crow&quot;, while an original track, &quot;Burn,&quot; was recorded for the &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; soundtrack. The latter also filmed a music video and the soundtrack was released on Nothing Records. A remix of &quot;Closer&quot; was also used in the opening credits to the David Fincher film &quot;Seven&quot;.

The album was promoted with the extensive Self Destruct Tour, which featured opening Nothing Records acts Marilyn Manson, Pop Will Eat Itself and Pig during various legs. Danny Lohner would join the band as full-time bassist for the tour. The tour included a set at Woodstock &#x27;94, which was broadcast on pay-per-view and featured the band performing while covered in mud. The performance went on to become one of the most famous of the band&#x27;s career. In 1995, Nine Inch Nails embarked on a tour with David Bowie, with Nothing Records act Prick supporting as guest openers.

A companion remix album, &quot;Further Down the Spiral&quot;, was released in on June 1, 1995, which once again included contributions from Nothing act Coil, as well as Rick Rubin, J. G. Thirlwell and some original interludes by Aphex Twin. The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on June 26, 1996, denoting sales in excess of 500,000 copies in the US.

Nine Inch Nails released the double VHS collection &quot;Closure&quot; on November 25, 1997. The first half documented the Self-Destruct Tour, while the second half compiled all of the band&#x27;s music videos to that point. A DVD release was planned at one point, but never came to fruition. Instead, in 2006, an unofficial version was released on a DVD disc image and distributed via BitTorrent at The Pirate Bay by an anonymous user called &quot;seed0.&quot; It is widely believed by fans that Reznor himself was behind the 2006 leaks, as implied by a post on his official blog: &quot;12/21/06 : Happy Holidays! This one is a guilt-free download. (shhhh - I didn&#x27;t say that out loud). If you know what I&#x27;m talking about, cool.&quot; As the title suggests, &quot;Closure&quot; marked the conclusion of &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; era for the band.

A landmark release for the band, &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; established Nine Inch Nails as a reputable force in the 1990s music scene, with its sound being widely imitated and Reznor receiving media hype and multiple honors. As of 2011, it was certified quadruple platinum and had sold 3.7 million copies in the United States. &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; has been regarded by music critics and audiences as one of the most important albums of the 1990s and was praised for its abrasive, eclectic nature and dark themes, although it was scrutinized by social conservatives for its lyrics. For its tenth anniversary, the album was remastered and re-released on November 23, 2004 in high-resolution Super Audio CD (SACD) and DualDisc formats, with a second disc collecting many b-sides and rarities. In 2017, the band reissued the album on vinyl.

=== Marilyn Manson new found distance Michael patrick bright (Portrait era) ===
In the months following the momentum of &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, the next release from the label came from Marilyn Manson. One of the earliest signings to the label, Marilyn Manson first met Reznor in 1990, while enrolled as a student at Broward Community College in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Warner was working towards a degree in journalism and gaining experience in the field by writing articles for a music magazine, &quot;25th Parallel&quot;. One of his interviews for the magazine was with Reznor. Manson also performed as a local opener for Nine Inch Nails in July 1990 with his band, then known as Marilyn Manson and The Spooky Kids, at Club Nu in Fort Lauderdale, Florida (a show which also included future Nothing Records act Meat Beat Manifesto). Manson wound up giving Reznor a tape of his material.

Upon forming the Nothing Records imprint, Reznor called Manson and offered to sign him to the label, alongside an opening slot supporting Nine Inch Nails on their upcoming &quot;Self Destruct Tour&quot;. At the time, Manson&#x27;s band had been fielding offers from numerous record companies, including Madonna&#x27;s Maverick label. Given the promise of total artistic freedom, the band opted to sign to Nothing Records.

Recording sessions for their debut studio album began in July 1993 with producer (and former Swans drummer) Roli Mosimann at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida. Recording a selection of new songs, along with material from their Spooky Kids repertoire, the first version of their debut, titled &quot;The Manson Family Album&quot;, was completed by the end of September. However, it was not well received. The band&#x27;s members, along with Reznor, felt Mosimann&#x27;s production was flat, lifeless and poorly representative of the band&#x27;s live performances. Seeking a more raw sound, Reznor agreed to rework production of &quot;The Manson Family Album&quot; in October 1993 at Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles. After seven weeks of mixing and re-recording, the album, retitled &quot;Portrait of an American Family&quot;, was presented to Nothing&#x27;s parent label Interscope. The song &quot;Filth&quot; was dropped from the revised album, while the songs &quot;Prelude (The Family Trip)&quot; and &quot;Wrapped In Plastic&quot; were added. The song &quot;Citronella&quot; was renamed &quot;Dogma&quot;. Several other minor musical and lyrical differences exist throughout the two versions, such as fewer Charles Manson samples being included in the song &quot;My Monkey&quot;.

Upon delivery of the album, Interscope was receiving a lot of negative press for the content of artists on another label they were housing at the time, Death Row Records, and expressed some reservations about releasing the album, which they anticipated could be controversial. Reznor threatened to take the album to another label if necessary, at which time Interscope agreed to release it, on the condition that the band remove some photos from the album sleeve. The album&#x27;s original cover art featured no text, simply a painting of a clown by John Wayne Gacy (the Gacy painting was later used as album art by the band Acid Bath for the album &quot;When the Kite String Pops&quot; in 1994). The sleeve photography included Polaroid pictures (faked by Manson and friends) of a mutilated female body, and a photo of what Manson described as &quot;one of those dolls from the 60s and you pull a string on the back of it and the eyes get really big and they change colors.&quot; Manson also intended to use a picture of himself as a child sitting nude on a couch in the album&#x27;s interior artwork. Though no genitalia was shown in the picture and it was taken by his own parents with no vulgar intent, the record label feared it would be misunderstood as child pornography. The ideas of using the Gacy artwork and the nude photos were ultimately dropped and, after a few months delay, the album was released on Nothing Records on July 19, 1994 and peaked at number thirty-five on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Heatseekers album chart, establishing the band as rising stars and a commercial success.

Originally, their song &quot;Snake Eyes And Sissies&quot; from Mosimann&#x27;s &quot;The Manson Family Album&quot; sessions was intended to be the band&#x27;s first single, with a single edit having been created. However, after the Reznor sessions, the album was instead led by the single &quot;Get Your Gunn&quot;, followed by &quot;Lunchbox&quot; and &quot;Dope Hat&quot;. The album was certified Gold on May 29, 2003 by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States.

=== &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; Soundtrack ===
During this time, in addition to recording with Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson for the label, Reznor also worked on the soundtrack to Oliver Stone&#x27;s controversial 1994 film, &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;. Reznor oversaw the structure of the soundtrack, which included audio collages from the film and aimed to recreate the style the film itself. Reznor worked on the soundtrack using a portable Pro Tools in his hotel room. Reznor received a producer credit, but did not select the artists chosen for it (which was done by music supervisor Budd Carr). The soundtrack originally included the songs &quot;A Warm Place&quot; and &quot;Something I Can Never Have&quot; by Nine Inch Nails. A new composition from the band, &quot;Burn&quot;, was recorded for the soundtrack, with a music video shot in the style of the film (although it was not directed by Stone). Reznor said of the experience:

The resulting soundtrack blended both previously released and unreleased material, spanning the genres of rock, punk, world music, country, hip-hop and more. It was released on August 23, 1994 to commercial and critical success. To date, the soundtrack has sold over 500,000 copies in the United States, making it a gold record. It was also named third best compilation album of 1995 by &quot;New Musical Express&quot; (December 24, 1994), and one of the &quot;90 Best Albums of the 1990s&quot; by &quot;Q&quot; magazine (December 1, 1999).

Nine Inch Nails&#x27; video for &quot;Burn&quot; was later included on the home video release of the &quot;Natural Born Killers: Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; on VHS and laserdisc, but omitted from subsequent editions, such as DVD and blu-ray. The bonus features on the home video editions of the director&#x27;s cut also included a behind-the-scenes featurette, in which Oliver Stone recollects his experiences working with Reznor on the film.

=== Pop Will Eat Itself ===
Capping off a successful year in 1994 at Nothing Records was the arrival of Pop Will Eat Itself, who were licensed by the label for Stateside release. Already established in the UK by the late 1980s, the band (sometimes referred to as PWEI or The Poppies) had a growing fanbase, with albums such as &quot;Box Frenzy&quot;, &quot;This Is the Day ... This Is the Hour ... This Is This!&quot;, &quot;Cure for Sanity&quot; and &quot;The Looks or the Lifestyle?&quot;. The latter album peaked at UK No. 15 and featured the Top 30 hit singles &quot;Karmadrome&quot; and &quot;Bulletproof!&quot; Despite healthy sales and successful touring, by January 1993, a shake-up at their longtime label RCA would lead to the band&#x27;s biggest supporters leaving the company. The remaining executives did not understand the band or their music, suggesting that EMF &#x27;write a hit&#x27; for them at one meeting. The band was dropped from the label before their &quot;Get the Girl! Kill the Baddies!&quot; single was released. It went on to peak at number 9 in the UK Singles Chart, becoming the band&#x27;s biggest hit to date, also making them, at that time, the highest charting act to ever appear on Top of The Pops without a record deal.

In the wake of the RCA shake-up, Pop Will Eat Itself moved to Infectious Records in the UK. A call between PWEI and Nine Inch Nails management would lead to Nothing Records picking up licensing rights for the band in the United States. Former frontman Clint Mansell (who shared songwriting and vocal duties with Graham Crabb) recalled:

&quot;Dos Dedos Mis Amigos&quot; was released on September 19, 1994 on Nothing Records. It marked a change in direction for the band, which had, until that time, featured a sound that blended hip-hop, electronic and alternative influences. &quot;Dos Dedos Mis Amigos&quot; took on a heavier, industrial rock sound. It was led by the singles &quot;Ich Bin Ein Auslander&quot;, &quot;Everything&#x27;s Cool&quot;, &quot;R.S.V.P.&quot; and &quot;Underbelly&quot;. &quot;Ich Bin Ein Auslander&quot; was accompanied by a music video, which received some airplay on MTV. Around this same time, the band had a high-profile collaboration with The Prodigy, on the track &quot;Their Law&quot; from the album Music for the Jilted Generation. &quot;Dos Dedos Mis Amigos&quot; peaked at No. 11 in the UK Albums Chart and their single &quot;Everything&#x27;s Cool&quot; became their ninth Top 30 UK hit. A Japanese edition of &quot;Dos Dedos Mis Amigos&quot; was released on Midi Music, which included four bonus tracks, all of which have since been released elsewhere by the band.

The band followed up &quot;Dos Dedos Mis Amigos&quot; with the &quot;Amalgamation&quot; EP, featuring remixes and additional tracks from the album sessions. The EP was picked up for US release on Nothing, which also released a promo-only single for &quot;R.S.V.P.&quot;, featuring alternate mixes. However, there were several releases tied into the album in the UK that Nothing opted not to license for release in the States. Infectious Records released singles for &quot;Ich Bin Ein Auslander&quot;, &quot;R.S.V.P. / Familus Horribilus&quot;, &quot;Everything&#x27;s Cool&quot; and &quot;Underbelly&quot;, none of which received licensing from Nothing. Most notable of all was the remix album &quot;Two Fingers My Friends!&quot;, which featured acts such as The Orb, Feotus and Die Krupps remixing tracks from &quot;Dos Dedos Mis Amigos&quot;. The remix collection was released in Infectious in 1995 in both a single disc set, as well as a limited edition two-disc edition, featuring additional remixes. &quot;Two Fingers My Friends!&quot; was not picked up for US release by Nothing.

PWEI toured to promote the album and enjoyed a raised profile in the States, but at the end of touring, the band found themselves struggling to continue as a creative force. Work did begin on an untitled follow-up to &quot;Dos Dedos Mis Amigos&quot;, with the band entering the studio in 1996. Their sixth studio album, which had been intended for Stateside release via Nothing, would not see release before the band broke up, however. Member Graham Crabb quit the band to focus on his ambient project Golden Claw Musics. Members Richard March and Robert &quot;Fuzz&quot; Townshend went on to form the big beat band Bentley Rhythm Ace. Townshend also released two solo albums, while Clint Mansell would end up signing onto Nothing Records as a solo artist. Mansell stated:

Only two songs from the sixth album&#x27;s recording sessions were released at the time, both on compilations. A cover of Gary Numan&#x27;s &quot;Friends&quot; was included on the Numan tribute album &quot;Random&quot; on the Beggars Banquet label, while the song &quot;Zero Return (Instrumental Mix)&quot; was included on Future Music Magazine&#x27;s June 1996 sampler &quot;FMCD June 1996&quot;, which also featured Nothing Records label-mates Meat Beat Manifesto.

Clint Mansell&#x27;s time as a solo artist for the label would be short-lived, as his career as a film composer blossomed. While Mansell would appear on numerous releases for the label as a remixer and collaborator, as well as an appearance in 1996 on the label&#x27;s &quot;Nights Of Nothing&quot; label showcase, performing with Nine Inch Nails (which included performances of some Pop Will Eat Itself songs), his planned solo album for Nothing was ultimately scrapped. Only two demos from Mansell&#x27;s solo album ever surfaced. The songs &quot;Atlantic Crossing&quot; and &quot;The Mechanic&quot; found their way online, by way of Clint Mansell and Nothing Records&#x27; official websites (both since defunct). Mansell also put together a streaming mix for &quot;Radio Nothing&quot; on the Nothing Records website, which included &quot;The Mechanic&quot;, alongside other tracks from the label. After Mansell&#x27;s successful work composing the film &quot;π&quot;, he went on to become a full-time film composer, on such films as &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;, &quot;Doom&quot; (the soundtrack to which featured an exclusive Mansell remix of Nine Inch Nails&#x27; track &quot;You Know What You Are&quot;), &quot;The Fountain&quot;, &quot;The Wrestler&quot;, &quot;Moon&quot;, and &quot;Black Swan&quot;.

In January 2005, Pop Will Eat Itself reunited for a brief series of shows in the UK, which produced a number of Instant Live albums, whereby ten minutes after the completion of each gig, double live albums of the performance could be purchased. The band also released a preview of newly recorded material (not to be confused with their then-unreleased 1996 material), under the working title of &quot;Sonic Noise Byte&quot; in November 2005, via their official website, pweination. However, an announcement on the official website in March 2006 confirmed that Mansell and March would no longer be involved in the reformation of the band, due to other work commitments, effectively ending that conception of the PWEI reformation. However, the remaining band members continued as Vileevils, performing live, releasing re-recorded versions of several tracks from the &quot;Sonic Noise Byte&quot; sessions and releasing two EPs; &quot;Demon / Axe Of Men 2010&quot; and &quot;Demon / Axe Of Men 2010 Remixes&quot;, both of which were credited as featuring Clint Mansell and Pop Will Eat Itself.

Vileevils performed their final live date in December 2008, before recording an unreleased album, which was cancelled prior to release in 2010. Instead, Pop Will Eat Itself finally reformed in 2011, with Graham Crabb serving as the band&#x27;s only original member, while having the blessing of all the former members. Songs from both the abandoned Vile Evils album, as well as the abandoned &quot;Sonic Noise Byte&quot; album, were reworked and re-recorded for alongside new material for Pop Will Eat Itself&#x27;s return album &quot;New Noise Designed by a Sadist&quot;, released in 2011 on Cooking Vinyl in the UK and Metropolis Records in the US.

The revived PWEI also began a series of reissues of their back-catalog, via the Cherry Red label. On October 7, 2013, the band re-issued &quot;Dos Dedos Mis Amigos&quot; on Cherry Red, featuring five rare bonus tracks, as well as a second disc; the unreleased 1996 album, now titled &quot;A Lick Of The Old Cassette Box&quot;. &quot;A Lick Of The Old Cassette Box&quot; was also released as a limited edition, stand-alone vinyl pressing that same year. Pop Will Eat Itself continues as a full-time project to this day, under the direction of Graham Crabb.

One act to depart during the early era of the label was Mondo Vanilli. Mondo Vanilli (sometimes referred to as MV Inc. or The Artists Formerly Known As Mondo Vanilli) was the brainchild of R. U. Sirius, an American writer, editor, talk show host, musician and cyberculture personality. Sirius was editor-in-chief of &quot;Mondo 2000&quot;, a glossy cyberculture magazine published in California during the 1980s and 1990s. It covered cyberpunk topics such as virtual reality and smart drugs, serving as a more anarchic and subversive predecessor to the later-founded &quot;Wired&quot; magazine. Sirius described the band as &quot;a virtual reality band that would proudly lip-synch, or maybe not, even pretend to play live music on stage - perhaps we would exist totally in virtuality - or else we would do other, more original types of performance to our music.&quot; Sirius was backed by members Scrappi DüChamp, with whom he had collaborated on previous musical projects and would compose most of the music - and Simone Third Arm, a performance artist introduced to Sirius early into the project&#x27;s inception.

Mondo Vanilli&#x27;s involvement with Nothing Records came about through a chance meeting at Reznor&#x27;s then-home at 10050 Cielo Drive, the site of the infamous Tate murders by members of the Manson Family in 1969. Sirius, a Northern California resident, had left Mondo 2000 three months prior and was visiting Los Angeles with some promotional Mondo Vanilli booklets and demo tapes, to shop them around the L.A. music scene. Sirius had been invited as a guest of Timothy Leary to a housewarming party at the grounds. It was there he met Reznor and gave him some of the Mondo Vanilli recordings, which included the songs &quot;Love Is The Product&quot;, &quot;Thanx!&quot; and &quot;Wraparound World.&quot; The day after the party, Reznor expressed interest in the band and discussed a deal singing them to Nothing Records. When the contract arrived, however, the band expressed some reservations. Sirius stated:

Recording commenced on the album at San Francisco&#x27;s Razor&#x27;s Edge Studios. The finished album, titled &quot;IOU Babe&quot; was completed in late 1993 and delivered to the label. However, the album was met with resistance from the label. Sirius recalled, &quot;We finished the album right around the end of 1993. In fact, the timing was such that we went to a NIN show in Oakland and handed in the final product in person to his management. This time, we weren&#x27;t invited into the dressing room and Reznor never came out to speak to us. I think it was maybe a few weeks after that Tony Ciula from Nothing Records told us that Interscope was making Nothing drop all their artists except NIN and Marilyn Manson but that we could have the album gratis.&quot;

The band suddenly found themselves without a label, having been dropped by Nothing. The final recording contract between the two parties had never been signed. However, upon requesting a formal notice of their release from the label, the situation became further complicated and it seemed the band would be unable to shop the album elsewhere. Sirius stated, &quot;When our lawyer asked for a formal notification of this (release from the label), the Interscope lawyer told us that they weren&#x27;t going to give us the rights to the music unless some other record company paid off their full bill ... and I think they had some other demands as well. In our position, we would have had to have gone to small indie labels, so it was pretty much impossible.&quot;

In the wake of the fallout from the label, the band took to publicly criticizing Nothing and Reznor for a time, posting an article called &quot;True Story of Brent Buzzkill and MV Inc,&quot; using pseudonyms and parody to recall their side of the story in their experiences with the label. They also recorded a new track for the &quot;IOU Babe&quot; album, &quot;The Ballad of Brent Buzzkill&quot;, aimed at Reznor and the label. Sirious reflected, &quot;Maybe he (Reznor) didn&#x27;t really get the album, as a whole. We heard he liked some of it. He also went into a well-publicized ... ahem ... downward spiral around that time. And we did make merciless fun of him for a few years after it all happened ... We were pretty mean!&quot;

The band ended up posting the album online for free, originally via member Scrappi DüChamp&#x27;s now-defunct website. It the years to follow, the album would disappear and reappear online, through numerous outlets, such as Bandcamp, SoundCloud, Internet Archive and The Pirate Bay, with slightly revised track lists. In 2011, the band stated on their Bandcamp website that a CD edition of the album was forthcoming, though to date, it has never materialized. Trent Reznor was given an unfeigned special thanks in later editions of the &quot;IOU Babe&quot; album credits.

== 1995-96: Expansion of the label ==
=== Prick ===
1995 was kicked off by the arrival of Prick, led by Reznor&#x27;s longtime friend and collaborator, Kevin McMahon. Prior to Nothing Records, the two musicians first crossed paths in the 1980s Cleveland music scene. McMahon, a Cleveland native, had spent much of the 70s and 80s fronting the rock band Lucky Pierre there, while in 1985, Reznor began performing with another local act called Exotic Birds . Exotic Birds was led by future Prick drummer Andy Kubiszewski (and even featured future Nine Inch Nails member Chris Vrenna for a short time). By 1988, Reznor had left Exotic Birds and joined Lucky Pierre. His time there would be likewise abbreviated, due to his desire to start his own project. However, he remained on long enough to appear on Lucky Pierre&#x27;s 1988 &quot;Communiqué&quot; 12&quot; EP, performing on the tracks &quot;Communiqué&quot; (an alternate version of which had been released as a 7&quot; single four years prior in 1984, which did not feature Reznor) and &quot;I Need To Get To Know&quot;. Lucky Pierre was also being managed at the time by John Malm. Reznor left the band shortly thereafter and went on to begin work on Nine Inch Nails&#x27; debut album, Pretty Hate Machine, hiring Malm as his manager in the process.

Meanwhile, McMahon also switched gears musically, moving to Los Angeles to begin what would become Prick. Rounding out the initial incarnation of the band was guitarist Chris Schleyer and former Exotic Birds member Andy Kubiszewski on drums, though the latter would intermittently drop in and out of the fold over the years to come, taking on duties with numerous other bands, including future Nothing Record act The The. By 1994, Prick&#x27;s live band consisted of Kevin McMahon on vocals and guitar, Chris Schleyer on lead guitar, Sebastien Monney on bass, Brian Kehew on keyboards and Sean Furlong on drums, performing for a short time under the name Riverhead in clubs around Los Angeles.

By this time, Reznor himself had relocated to Los Angeles, where he was soon to begin work on The Downward Spiral. McMahon and Reznor agreed to spend some time in the studio together, revisiting some of the old Lucky Pierre material and recording new versions of &quot;Communique&quot;, &quot;Tough&quot;, &quot;Other People&quot; (previously known as &quot;I Need To Get To Know&quot;) and &quot;No Fair Fights&quot;. The songs were not yet intended for any specific project or label. &quot;We were just doing it to do music,&quot; stated McMahon. Aware of the collaboration&#x27;s resemblance in sound to Nine Inch Nails, McMahon opted to embrace Trent&#x27;s contributions, rather than try to avoid common ground. McMahon stated, &quot;Trent was the other part of the band on the songs that he produced. He and I were the band, so there&#x27;s going to be some kind of similarity there. I&#x27;m certainly not going to ask him to not do what he does best, so that I won&#x27;t have any indication of any sound like that.&quot;

McMahon would go on to sign Prick to a contract with Interscope Records. He began work on a debut album, flying to London to record material with producer Warne Livesey. After completing recording, the album was shelved at Interscope for an extended period, to the degree that Andy Kubiszewski, who was back with the band at this time, performing drums on the album, opted to take an offer to tour with Stabbing Westward. McMahon began to feel he wasn&#x27;t getting what he wanted out of Interscope, at which time he reconnected with Reznor and Malm and Prick was moved under the Nothing Records umbrella.

At least two of the Livesey produced tracks were ultimately cut from the album, although they would later surface of future McMahon projects. &quot;Attitude&quot; and &quot;Johnny Goes To Paris&quot; appeared on Lucky Pierre&#x27;s 2004 &quot;ThinKing&quot; album, while drummer Andy Kubiszewski stated an early version of &quot;Actress&quot; was also recorded with Livesey during the original album sessions. It later appeared on Prick&#x27;s &quot;The Wreckard&quot; album. In lieu of the cut songs, McMahon&#x27;s recent material with Reznor was added. The album was finally on track for release, with a promo 7&quot; for &quot;Communique / Crack&quot; surfacing in 1994, while the full-length, self-titled album followed on February 7, 1995. The album was led by the single &quot;Animal&quot;, which received moderate airplay on MTV and alternative radio and was featured on the soundtrack to the film Showgirls. It went on to sell over 66,000 copies.

Prick toured the album, supporting such acts as Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin, Lords Of Acid and My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult. Garrett Hammond replaced Andy Kubiszewski on drums, while frequent Nine Inch Nails collaborator Dave Ogilvie was hired for live programming. Prick was then invited to their largest showcase yet, as openers for Nine Inch Nails&#x27; and David Bowie&#x27;s 1995 co-headlining Outside Tour. In 1996, McMahon played guitar with Nine Inch Nails for three shows on &quot;Nights of Nothing&quot; showcase, which included two Prick songs (&quot;Animal&quot; and &quot;Tough&quot;) as part of NIN&#x27;s set.

As the promotional cycle for Prick&#x27;s debut album winded down, McMahon began to feel discomfort with the increased spotlight, stating &quot;I&#x27;m not comfortable with the fame thing, even just walking out after a show and having somebody recognize me or anything like that, because I kind of just am there on stage when I&#x27;m on stage or in the studio. That&#x27;s sort of when I do whatever I do. The other times I&#x27;m just kind of looking around like everybody else. I don&#x27;t want to have to be anything that somebody expects me to be. I just think that once that starts, it&#x27;s the beginning of deterioration of the person.&quot; Differences were also mounting with Nothing/Interscope, due in part to McMahon feeling they were putting a greater emphasis on their expanding roster, while diminishing their focus on Prick. McMahon recalled:

Interscope was a young enough company where they were saying, &quot;We have only 12 artists, and it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re going to be throwing out 15 a month and see what sticks. We&#x27;re going to try to pay attention to you. As time passed, the record came out, they signed more and more people, and all of a sudden, the idea of me doing a record every year or every 18 months turned into, &quot;Well, there&#x27;s no commercial radio hit here anymore, you need to do a commercial radio kind of thing.&quot;

In spite of the growing differences, McMahon set about plans of recording a follow-up, double-album of Prick material for Nothing, under the working title of &quot;Numb&quot;. However, Nothing management pulled the plug at the last minute, requesting McMahon do additional work on the album to make it more radio friendly. McMahon stated, &quot;The day before I was supposed to begin recording the second album, the label decided they didn&#x27;t want to do it. They wanted more radio-friendly songs. And since I don&#x27;t listen to the radio, I didn&#x27;t know what they were talking about. I can&#x27;t write songs that someone wants me to write.&quot;

With the two parties at an impasse, Prick would quietly part ways with the Nothing Records. In spite of this, McMahon left in good standing with both Reznor and Malm. &quot;There was never any real blowout with Trent,&quot; McMahon stated. John Malm expressed his admiration for McMahon as well, but noted, &quot;I think that he didn&#x27;t take well to the major label situation.&quot;

In the subsequent years, McMahon quietly recorded on and off, while attempting to reacquire publishing rights to his new material. After successfully doing so in 1999, McMahon surfaced online with an MP3 of a new track, &quot;Wetcat,&quot; in late 2000. Two more tracks, &quot;I Know It&#x27;s Gonna Hurt&quot; and &quot;Cloud&quot;, followed in 2001 (the latter ultimately surfacing on Lucky Pierre&#x27;s &quot;ThinKing&quot; album). Opting not to shop his material to new labels, McMahon instead chose to self-release. In 2002, Prick finally announced their sophomore album, &quot;The Wreckard&quot;, to be released online via McMahon&#x27;s own Lucky Pierre Music. The album featured two tracks produced by Warne Livesey, &quot;Into My Arms&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, both of which were recorded in 1997, as well as &quot;Wetcat&quot; and &quot;I Know It&#x27;s Gonna Hurt.&quot; McMahon assembled a live band to support the album, consisting of Greg Zydyk on guitar, (Lucky Pierre bandmate) Tom Lash on bass and Andy Kubiszewski once again on drums. They performed a small run of regional shows around the Midwest and Eastern US, from late 2002 into 2003.

In 2004, McMahon returned to Lucky Pierre, with the album &quot;ThinKing&quot;, which included the two tracks originally cut from Prick&#x27;s 1995 debut, as well as the track &quot;Cloud&quot;, which had surfaced three years prior as an MP3. &quot;ThinKing&quot; marked Lucky Pierre&#x27;s first full-length album ever, nearly 30 years after their formation.

After another period of silence, in 2009, McMahon returned with his largest wave of material to date. In addition to reissues of &quot;The Wreckard&quot; and &quot;ThinKing&quot;, both featuring upgraded packaging, Prick&#x27;s first live album was released, &quot;Boston Live&quot;, as well as a self-titled compilation of the bulk of Lucky Pierre&#x27;s back-catalog. Two additional McMahon projects also saw release at this time. Fear Of Blue was a more electronic-based project, recorded in 1990 by Kevin McMahon and Ray DiLeo, while ( sic ), a rock-based project, featured McMahon, Andy Kebiszewski, Greg Zydyk and Mark Gamiere. Released as an EP, ( sic )&#x27;s &quot;Standard Idiom Communiqué&quot; included the track &quot;Runaway Brain,&quot; which had also previously surfaced online as an MP3.

In early 2010, the Lucky Pierre Music website closed down, with a message stating, &quot;Hello Friends / Fans, While LPM is expanding its content of new and vintage music and merch available to you at our store, and as we work to develop the best ways and means of reaching any and all those interested, we have decided to close the site for an indefinite amount of time to facilitate this effort.&quot; To date, Prick has not publicly surfaced since. However, in 2017, Interscope Records released Prick&#x27;s 1995 self-titled debut on vinyl for the first time.

=== Trust Obey ===
By 1995, Trust Obey completed their first album for Nothing Records, &quot;Hands Of Ash&quot;, though it would never see release though the label. Trust Obey is John Bergin, an illustrator, designer, writer, filmmaker and musician. Originally a Pennsylvania native, Bergin had been &quot;drawing and painting for as long as I can remember.&quot; By 1984, while attending the University of the Arts in Philadelphia (from 1984 - 1988), Bergin began experimenting in music, citing such acts as Swans and future Nothing Records act Einstürzende Neubauten as influences. Trust Obey was founded in 1988 in Kansas City, Missouri, beginning as a one-man project with a series of self-released cassettes; &quot;Fucking The Wound&quot; (1989), &quot;Rip Saw&quot; (1989), &quot;Locust&quot; (1990), &quot;The Veil&quot; (1990), &quot;Room 101&quot; (1991) and &quot;Exit Wound&quot; (1991). In 1993, Bergin added guitarist Brett Smith as a permanent member of the band, in order to accommodate live performances.

By 1994, Bergin had become heavily immersed in the graphic design and comic book worlds and Trust Obey was commissioned to compose music to accompany James O&#x27;Barr&#x27;s graphic novel, The Crow. Timed to coincide with the release of the Alex Proyas directed motion picture starring Brandon Lee, the graphic novel was released in a special hardcover edition on Kitchen Sink Press and Graphitti Design and included Trust Obey&#x27;s companion CD album, &quot;Fear And Bullets&quot;. At this time, O&#x27;Barr even claimed to have joined on as a member of Trust Obey, however, his only credited appearance on any Trust Obey release would be contributing some lyrics to the song &quot;The Crow&quot; on the &quot;Fear And Bullets&quot; album.

Trent Reznor would also have involvement with The Crow franchise, on the motion picture side of things, delivering a Nine Inch Nails cover of Joy Division&#x27;s &quot;Dead Souls&quot; for the hit soundtrack. Reznor would hear the &quot;Fear And Bullets&quot; album and offer Trust Obey a five-album contract with Nothing Records, making them one of the earliest acts signed to the label. In an interview on the bootleg Nine Inch Nails disc, &quot;Disturbed&quot;, Reznor discussed singing Trust Obey, noting that the band was &quot;not a great commercial potential.&quot;

Working on the film score to The Crow were composer Graeme Revell and Brian &quot;Lustmord&quot; Williams (as a &quot;musical sound designer&quot;), both of whom went on to become friends with John Bergin through their mutual association with the franchise (Bergin went on to design art for releases with both Revell and Lustmord). Nothing Records expressed interest in signing composer Graeme Revell to release his score to The Crow film, which would be paired with a reissue of Trust Obey&#x27;s &quot;Fear And Bullets&quot; graphic novel compositions and released together as a double album. However, Brian Lustmord expressed reservations about such a partnership. Bergin explained:

&quot;Nothing Records was interested in releasing my Trust Obey Crow soundtrack and Graeme (Revell)&#x27;s Crow film score as a double CD. At the time Graeme didn&#x27;t have a label for this work, so he was into the idea. Back then Brian (Lustmord) had first said to me &quot;oh ... Nothing records ... Nine Inch Nails ... I&#x27;ll say no more.&quot; He wasn&#x27;t too excited about the notion of associating with Trent&#x27;s label. He was right. The whole idea of the double CD fell apart.&quot;

With plans for the Graeme Revell/Trust Obey joint release scrapped, Revell&#x27;s score was ultimately released instead on the Varèse Sarabande soundtrack label, while Trust Obey entered the studio in the spring of 1995 to begin recording an album of new material for Nothing Records. The resulting album, &quot;Hands Of Ash&quot;, was delivered to the label, where it was met with apprehension. The album remained shelved for an extended period, before Bergin became frustrated with the situation and the parties agreed to part ways in February 1996, with Bergin retaining the rights to the &quot;Hands Of Ash&quot; album.

In the wake of Trust Obey&#x27;s departure from Nothing Records, Brian McNelis of Lakeshore Entertainment would put Bergin in touch with Jared Louche of the industrial rock band Chemlab. Bergin met with Louche in Chicago, while he was recording Chemlab&#x27;s &quot;East Side Militia&quot; album. Louche at the time was serving as general manager for Fifth Colvmn Records and requested Bergin send him some material for release consideration.

Fifth Colvmn Records would opt to pick up Hands Of Ash, as well as another project of Bergin&#x27;s, (the source of name being the chemical formula for morphine), for the &quot;Terra Damnata&quot; album. &quot;Hands Of Ash&quot; was released on August 2, 1996 on Fifth Colvmn Records, bearing a sticker on the CD jewel case, featuring Reznor&#x27;s &quot;Not a great commercial potential&quot; quotation on the cover. The album&#x27;s liner notes also included mention of Reznor and Nothing Records in the credits, stating, &quot;Thanks to Trent and Nothing for something.&quot;

Bergin would go on to form numerous other music projects, such as Orifice, Blackmouth, Tertium Non Data, Lolo and Camouflaged Abominations. He also performed as a member of Paved In Skin and had a short stint as a member of the industrial rock supergroup Pigface. Pigface was led by musician Martin Atkins, who also ran Invisible Records. On October 28, 1999, Invisible Records reissued Trust Obey&#x27;s &quot;Fear And Bullets&quot; album, with reworked versions of the original graphic novel tracks, as well as one song being added (&quot;A Murder Of Crows&quot;) and one song removed (&quot;Don&#x27;t Look&quot;). In 2001, Invisible also released &#x27;s &quot;Terra Null&quot; double album (the second disc of which was a reissue of the &quot;Terra Damnata&quot; album).

Bergin is currently the art director at Lakeshore Records, where he has been involved in creating the artwork for hundreds of releases. He has also created numerous comic book series, including &quot;Ashes&quot;, &quot;Golgothika&quot; and &quot;Wednesday&quot;. For his graphic novel work, Bergin was nominated for the Harvey Award for Best New Talent in 1991. Through the 1990s, Bergin created short comics and illustrated titles for Heavy Metal Magazine, Marvel, DC and Dark Horse Comics. In the mid-90s, Bergin collaborated with James O&#x27;Barr, working as creative talent for Tundra, where in addition to &quot;The Crow&quot;, they produced &quot;Bone Saw&quot;, &quot;IO&quot; and &quot;From Inside&quot;. In 2008, Bergin directed an animated feature-length film adaptation of &quot;From Inside&quot;, which won numerous awards and screened at over 50 international film festivals, including SITGES (Best Animated Feature), Fantasia Film Festival (Jury Prize), Utopiales (Grand Prix) and Future Film Festival of Italy. &quot;From Inside&quot; was released on home video in October 2014.

In 2015, Trust Obey reissued &quot;Hands Of Ash&quot; digitally, via Bergin&#x27;s own Stompbox13 label. Missing from the release was the final track, &quot;Larvatus,&quot; though it was included as a bonus track on Stompbox13&#x27;s Bandcamp edition, as well as the previously unreleased song &quot;Malice Buried,&quot; which serves as part two of the song &quot;Hands Of Malice.&quot; Bergin continues to use Stompbox13 as the primary outlet for his musical output.

=== Meat Beat Manifesto (Subliminal Sandwich era) ===
Meat Beat Manifesto would have many encounters with Trent Reznor in the years leading up to their arrival on Nothing Records. However, the partnership was born out of a dark period for the group, due to difficulties with their European label, Play It Again Sam. Meat Beat Manifesto, originally the duo of Jack Dangers and Johnny Stephens, struggled to find any labels willing to support them in the UK throughout their formative years in the late 1980s. This prompted the band to accept an unfavorable deal with Belgian label Play It Again Sam. Jack Dangers recalled, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t get a label to sign me in the UK, and that&#x27;s why I ended up in a disastrous contract with Belgian label PIAS (Play It Again Sam).&quot; In spite of this, the deal sparked interest from many labels in the US. Venerable imprints such as Wax Trax! Records and Mute Records would license the band&#x27;s early material in the United States, such as &quot;Storm the Studio&quot;, &quot;Armed Audio Warfare&quot;, &quot;99%&quot; and &quot;Satyricon&quot;, which gave MBM an increased Stateside following. Dangers reflected, &quot;I remember going to see Mute Records in 1988 and they weren&#x27;t interested in the slightest in what I was doing. Two years later they were running all over the world to sign me for the American end of the deal because PIAS only had me signed for Europe. It&#x27;s funny how two years prior they wouldn&#x27;t even listen to my records.&quot;

Their early work would capture the attention of Trent Reznor, leading to an invitation in 1990 for Meat Beat Manifesto to perform as openers during Nine Inch Nails&#x27; &quot;Hate &#x27;90&quot; tour (a tour which also included a guest appearance from one of the earliest incarnations of Marilyn Manson, who performed as local openers when the tour ran through Florida). Meat Beat Manifesto were also invited to remix Nine Inch Nails, first on the Closer To God remix disc in 1994, followed by The Perfect Drug in 1997 (the former also featured Nothing Records act Coil, while the latter also featured Nothing act Plug).

In 1993, Dangers relocated from England to San Francisco, California and began work on a follow-up to 1992&#x27;s &quot;Satyricon&quot;. By this time, Dangers had become the sole, constant member of the band and recording of the subsequent album, &quot;Subliminal Sandwich&quot;, would mark a dark time in his life, due in part to the death of his father, as well as increasing tension with his label, PIAS. Dangers stated, &quot;&quot;Subliminal Sandwich&quot; was done while I was in the middle of trying to get out of my label deal, which is always a bad thing, so I just made the best of a terrible thing and did a double album. I was just waiting to get out of that miserable, boring, heard-it-all-before stuff.&quot;

Throughout the recording of &quot;Subliminal Sandwich&quot;, the band faced uncertainty regarding their Stateside distribution. Mute Records was in the process of downsizing, while their licensing contract with Play It Again Sam was likewise nearing its conclusion. A US 12&quot; single for &quot;Nuclear Bomb&quot; from the &quot;Subliminal Sandwich&quot; sessions made it as far as the test pressing stage at Mute in late 1995, before plans for a commercial release were scrapped.

MBM&#x27;s North American licensing via Mute soon lapsed and the band found themselves without U.S. distribution, paving the way for Nothing Records to begin licensing their work in the United States in 1996. &quot;Subliminal Sandwich&quot; was released as a double album on June 4, 1996 on Nothing Records. The album was led by a cover of the World Domination Enterprises song &quot;Asbestos Lead Asbestos,&quot; which was released as commercial single in Europe on PIAS and as a promo only CD/12&quot; single on Nothing in the US. A video for the song also received minor US airplay on MTV. Additionally, a single for &quot;Transmission&quot; was released in Europe on PIAS, though it was not picked up for US release by Nothing.

Meat Beat Manifesto would support &quot;Subliminal Sandwich&quot; with extensive touring across the United States and Europe, featuring a line-up of Jack Dangers, John Wilson on guitar, Lynn Farmer on drums and Mike Powell on samples and keys. In 1996, the band took part in the &quot;Nights Of Nothing&quot; label showcase, which featured label-mates Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails, with the latter&#x27;s line-up including Clint Mansell of Pop Will Eat Itself and Kevin McMahon from Prick.

The band would go on to become one of the more prolific acts on Nothing, releasing many additional titles in the years to follow, as well as helping reshape the sound of the label. However, Dangers and Reznor maintained a mostly professional relationship throughout their tenure, with Dangers stating, &quot;I was never really hanging out with Trent. I don&#x27;t know if that was the perception.&quot; Despite the fact the band was only ever licensed via Belgian label PIAS, Meat Beat Manifesto&#x27;s relationship with Nothing Records was considered a positive one, with Dangers describing Nothing Records at the time as &quot;the best label we&#x27;ve ever been a part of.&quot;

=== Pig ===
In 1994, Nine Inch Nails invited Pig to open a series of shows in London during the European leg of their Self Destruct Tour. By this time, Raymond Watts, founder of Pig, had firmly established himself in the industrial scene as a founding member of KMFDM (though he would come and go from the band&#x27;s line-up, opting to focus on Pig), as well as a collaborator with such acts as Psychic TV, Foetus and future Nothing Records act Einstürzende Neubauten. Pig&#x27;s earliest work had seen release via the seminal Wax Trax! Records. However, much of his output, which included &quot;A Poke in the Eye ... With a Sharp Stick!&quot;, &quot;Praise the Lard&quot;, &quot;A Stroll in the Pork&quot; and &quot;The Swining&quot;, was scattered across numerous labels around the world and often proved difficult to find. Much of his output by the mid-90s had become released exclusively in Japan, where Watts had garnered a respectable fanbase.

Reznor was familiar with most of Watts&#x27; scattered body of work and during their encounters Europe, Watts gave Reznor a copy of his latest album, &quot;Sinsation&quot;, which was released in 1995 on Japanese label Victor Entertainment. When Watts came to the United States to work with KMFDM on their Nihil album and tour, the band would meet up with Reznor in New Orleans (where then-KMFDM member En Esch was living at the time). Soon after, Trent would suggest to release Pig in the US on Nothing Records. Watts explained, &quot;I met Trent very briefly in London and the next time he was back he asked me and my band (Pig) to open up for quite a few of their (Nine Inch Nails) European shows. He was aware that there had been sporadic Pig releases on different labels, because I moved about a bit. He was obviously aware of the &quot;Sinsation&quot; album, because I&#x27;d given him a copy of it somewhere along the line and then last year, when I was out with KMFDM, we met again and it was just a little bit after that that it was suggested that it might be possible to work together with regard to getting it out on Nothing.&quot;

Watts accepted a deal to license &quot;Sinsation&quot; to Nothing Records, where it was released on September 17, 1996. However, the album received only minor promotional support from Nothing/Interscope. One such instance of insufficient promotion involved a music video for the band&#x27;s single, &quot;Paniac&quot;. The video, which had already been shot and received airplay in Japan, was delivered to MTV for airplay in the States. However, the video featured heavy use of fire, which was a sensitive issue for the network at the time, due to controversy over the Beavis and Butt-Head show, which had been accused of provoking a child to light fire to his home. The network requested the video be edited in order to receive airplay, which would have cost only a minor amount for Interscope. In spite of this, they declined to finance the edit. Watts stated, &quot;We had a really good video for &quot;Painiac&quot;, the one with the flames and shit and MTV didn&#x27;t want to show it unless we edited it. It would have cost $2,000 to edit it and Interscope, in their infinite wisdom, thought that it wasn&#x27;t worth the investment. I think they wanted a couple of things taken out. And Interscope was running things for Nothing. It was really nice that Nothing wanted to put out our records, but they&#x27;re busy dealing with this shit (focusing on the larger acts), and we had everyday Interscope people dealing with our shit.&quot; A single for &quot;Painiac&quot; was also released in Japan in 1995 on Victor Entertainment, which was not licensed for release by Nothing Records.

While Pig had an open-ended agreement with Nothing, which included the possibility of more Pig material being licensed to the label, Watts began to feel that, in spite of being shepherded by a major label, Nothing was in fact a very small operation and was only able to focus most of their energy on their largest acts. Watts stated, &quot;they were too busy with other artists and I expected a little bit more feedback from a label on which I was signed.&quot; Despite having a follow-up album, entitled &quot;Wrecked&quot;, already completed by the time Nothing released &quot;Sinsation&quot; in the United States, Watts felt the label showed minimal interest in it, explaining:

Trent had known about Pig for a long time and basically thought that it might be a good idea to raise the profile. And it seemed to be something that might be a good gesture, because we didn&#x27;t get releases here and it raised the profile. But in fact, they were a small label, and they&#x27;ve got very big artists to work with, like Manson, which became a huge, huge act. They&#x27;ve got big artists to deal with. And being kind of small and obscure and stuff, we felt mutually that they had gotten the ball rolling for Pig in the States here and there was this other album (&quot;Wrecked&quot;) to release and this tour (with KMFDM) came up, and we mutually agreed that maybe other people could be more pro-active in the Pig situation. So we just went, &quot;Well we did this one, that&#x27;s great, thanks a lot, these people (at Wax Trax!) can probably put more into it.

Pig left Nothing Records in 1997 under amicable terms, returning to Wax Trax! Records to release &quot;Wrecked&quot; in the United States (which had likewise been licensed from Japanese label Victor Entertainment, who first released the album in 1996). Pig followed this with a national tour of the US, opening for KMFDM in late 1997. In the wake of the Wax Trax! label folding, Pig went on to release numerous albums via Metropolis Records in the US, such as &quot;Genuine American Monster&quot;, &quot;Pigmata&quot; and &quot;The Gospel&quot;.

=== Marilyn Manson (Antichrist Superstar era) ===
Winding down promotion on their debut album, &quot;Portrait of an American Family&quot;, Marilyn Manson initially planned a remix single for the track &quot;Dope Hat.&quot; However, various contributions by engineer and Skinny Puppy producer Dave Ogilvie and Nine Inch Nails then-live keyboardist Charlie Clouser, combined with new material by the band, resulted in an eclectic and unusual combination and it was decided to expand the release into an EP. Leading up to it in Spring of 1995, Marilyn Manson took an opening slot with the band Danzig. The tour was rife with drug binges and unusual backstage escapades, many of which were the genesis for ideas which became the &quot;Smells Like Children&quot; EP.

The band was once again produced by Trent Reznor. &quot;Smells Like Children&quot; was full of recordings from backstage on the Danzig tour, as well as samples from the films &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; and &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; (the EP derives its title in reference to the latter), as well as distorted clips of the band&#x27;s appearance on &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot;. An early version of the EP, which had not cleared the rights for its audio samples, was mistakenly pressed by Nothing/Interscope and distributed as a promo release. Upon realizing their mistaken, unauthorized film samples, as well as other sound bites considered too extreme, Interscope insisted the EP&#x27;s track listing be revised for public release. The final, commercial release removed the original opening track, &quot;Abuse, Part 1 (There is Pain Involved),&quot; featuring the voices of Manson and Danzig/Pantera tour bus driver Tony F. Wiggins, as they attempted to calm down a masochistic girl, and &quot;Abuse, Part 2 (Confessions),&quot; featuring an interview with a teenage girl who confesses to molesting her seven-year-old male cousin. These tracks were replaced by &quot;The Hands of Small Children&quot; and &quot;May Cause Discoloration of the Urine or Feces,&quot; respectively. Speaking about the promo edition, Manson stated in his autobiography:

The only solace was that through some unfortunate error someone at the record pressing plant made several thousand copies of our original version of the album, thinking it was the new one. Without even listening to them, the record company sent them out as promotional copies to radio stations and journalists before realizing their mistake. Now, they are available to anyone who wants to hear them on the Internet. Though someone at the label actually accused me of plotting it, I wish I was that resourceful. God, however irrelevant he may be to me, works in mysterious ways.

The final EP did still feature some backstage debauchery from the Danzig tour, for which Interscope demanded written affidavits from the participants in the sound bites, certifying their consent to be recorded. However, most notable on the EP was the band&#x27;s cover version of Eurythmics&#x27; 1983 hit &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot;, which was released as a single, despite Manson claiming Nothing Records was resistant to doing so. Despite this, the song became a major hit on radio and MTV, eventually being nominated at the MTV Video Music Awards for Best Rock Video and helping launch the band into mainstream success. &quot;Smells Like Children&quot; was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Marilyn Manson&#x27;s success in the wake of their hit single &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot; helped garner much anticipation for their follow-up, sophomore album, &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;. Trent Reznor once again came on board as producer, while Manson, Sean Beavan and Dave Ogilvie shared co-production duties. Members of both Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails also participated in production duties. The album was recorded at Reznor&#x27;s Nothing Studios in New Orleans. The process of making the album was long and difficult, involving experiments in sleep deprivation and near-constant drug use, in an effort to create a violent and hostile environment suited to the album&#x27;s content. During this time, antagonism between band members was high, which caused the departure of guitarist and co-founding member Daisy Berkowitz, with Twiggy Ramirez performing much of the album&#x27;s guitar work as a result.

&quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;, a rock opera concept album was released on October 8, 1996. It was led by the single The Beautiful People, which became a major hit on the alternative rock charts, being awarded gold record certification by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), reaching number twenty-six on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; and number eighteen in the UK. The music channel VH1 named it number twenty-eight of their &quot;40 Greatest Metal Songs&quot;. &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 132,000 copies. Manson also appeared on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, who awarded the band their &quot;Best New Artist&quot; accolade in 1997. The year long &quot;Dead to the World Tour&quot; followed, which was the band&#x27;s longest and largest tour yet.

Meanwhile, the band was also reaching new heights of controversy, finding themselves the target of congressional hearings, led by Senator Joseph Lieberman, to determine the effects, if any, of violent lyrics on young listeners. Lieberman would famously go on to refer to Marilyn Manson as &quot;perhaps the sickest group ever promoted by a mainstream record company.&quot; Nearly every performance of their &quot;Dead to the World&quot; tour was picketed by religious organizations.

The band, however, embraced the controversy and catapulted themselves into one of the top rock acts of the late 1990s. &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; has sold over 7 million copies worldwide, with 1.9 million of those sold in the United States alone. It spawned two commercial singles and music videos (&quot;The Beautiful People&quot; and &quot;Tourniquet&quot;) and an additional three music videos; &quot;Cryptorchid&quot;, &quot;Man That You Fear&quot; and the title track, &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;. The latter was screened at the 1997 San Francisco Film Festival, depicting Manson on a podium, bearing a lightning bolt symbol and, in one scene, tearing apart the Bible and dumping it on the public. Interscope Records refused to release the &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; music video for airplay. However, in 2010, the unedited video was leaked on YouTube.

The band followed the album with the &quot;Remix &amp; Repent&quot; EP on November 25, 1997, as well as the &quot;Dead to the World&quot; VHS video on February 10, 1998, which documented their controversial tour. Three previously unreleased songs from the band were also included on high-profile soundtracks to motion pictures. &quot;Long Hard Road Out of Hell&quot; appeared on the soundtrack to Todd McFarlane&#x27;s &quot;Spawn&quot;, &quot;Apple of Sodom&quot; on the soundtrack to David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (also released on Nothing Records) and &quot;The Suck for Your Solution&quot; featured on the soundtrack to the Howard Stern biopic &quot;Private Parts&quot;. &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; remains a milestone in the band&#x27;s career. In the years since its release, it has been heralded by numerous publications as a modern classic and essential listening.

== 1997-99 ==
The late 90s at Nothing Records featured many electronic acts arriving at the label, via licensing deals with UK labels Warp Records and Blue Planet. Nothing continued to sign rock based acts as well, such as 12 Rounds and Rob Halford&#x27;s 2wo project. They would also release new albums from their highest selling acts, Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson, as well as another high-profile film soundtrack, &quot;Lost Highway&quot;. This period of time would become the most prolific era for the label.

=== &quot;Lost Highway&quot; soundtrack ===
In late 1995, filmmaker David Lynch began production on &quot;Lost Highway&quot;. The film score was created by long-time Lynch composer Angelo Badalamenti, with additional music provided by Barry Adamson. Supplementing their compositions, Lynch also sought to use unnerving soundscapes throughout the film and, at the suggestion of a mutual friend, reached out to Trent Reznor to achieve this. Over the years, Reznor had publicly praised Lynch&#x27;s work, particularly the film &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; and the TV series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, the latter of which Reznor claimed to have even delayed Nine Inch Nails performances, in order to watch the latest episodes.

Although Reznor would accept Lynch&#x27;s offer, he initially found the experience to be a stressful one. &quot;At first it was like the most high-pressure situation ever. He (Lynch) would describe a scene and say, &#x27;Here&#x27;s what I want. Now, there&#x27;s a police car chasing Fred down the highway, and I want you to picture this: There&#x27;s a box, okay? And in this box there&#x27;s snakes coming out; snakes whizzing past your face. So, what I want is the sound of that – the snakes whizzing out of the box – but it&#x27;s got to be like impending doom.&#x27; And he hadn&#x27;t brought any footage with him. He says, &#x27;Okay, okay, go ahead. Give me that sound.&#x27; He wasn&#x27;t doing it to intimidate me. At the same time, I had to tell him, &#x27;David, I&#x27;m not a film-effects guy, I don&#x27;t have ad clients and I&#x27;m not used to being in this environment. I don&#x27;t work that way, so respect that and understand that I just need a few moments to be alone, so that I know that when I suck, no one is knowing I&#x27;m sucking and then I&#x27;ll give you the good stuff.&#x27;&quot;

Reznor composed two instrumental pieces for the film under his own name, enlisting Coil&#x27;s Peter Christopherson to assist on the songs. Reznor had lobbied for Coil to take on a greater role in composing music for Lynch&#x27;s films, but Lynch declined. Coil member John Balance recalled, &quot;You know, with &quot;Lost Highway&quot;, Trent literally forced (us) down David Lynch&#x27;s throat, saying &#x27;Look, please put this Coil stuff on.&#x27; You know, he really did help to get us on that soundtrack, but he (Lynch) wasn&#x27;t interested. He wanted David Bowie, he wanted Marilyn Manson, he wanted whomever he could get. He just said, &#x27;These people are really big. I want this film to be really big.&#x27; He didn&#x27;t give a fuck about the integrity.&quot;

After completion of the score compositions, David Lynch would ask Reznor to handle the release of the soundtrack, which would also include major rock artists personally selected by Lynch, such as David Bowie, Marilyn Manson, The Smashing Pumpkins (who recorded an exclusive song for the soundtrack) and Rammstein, as well as a new song from Nine Inch Nails, entitled &quot;The Perfect Drug.&quot; The soundtrack was subsequently slated for release on Nothing Records.

Marilyn Manson also recorded a new song for the soundtrack, &quot;Apple Of Sodom,&quot; even filming a music video for it, which went unreleased at the time, though it later found its way onto YouTube. Band members Marilyn Manson and Twiggy Ramirez also filmed cameo appearances in the &quot;Lost Highway&quot; film itself. Rammstein, who were largely then-unknown and also major fans of Lynch, had sent him their music from Germany. Lynch, in turn, played Rammstein on set throughout the filming of Lost Highway and selected two of their songs for the soundtrack. A music video for their song &quot;Rammstein&quot; heavily featured clips from the film. Nine Inch Nails also completed a music video for &quot;The Perfect Drug,&quot; directed by Mark Romanek. Unlike the Rammstein music video, &quot;The Perfect Drug&quot; did not feature any film footage from the film.

The &quot;Lost Highway&quot; soundtrack was originally planned for release in late 1996 to coincide with the release of the film. However, the film release was delayed slightly, instead premiering on February 27, 1997. The soundtrack was likewise pushed back, with its official release date set just ahead of the film on February 18, 1997 on Nothing Records. Behind the momentum of the numerous, major rock acts involved, the soundtrack went on to become a commercial success, reaching No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and receiving Gold certification in the United States.

Nine Inch Nails released a single for &quot;The Perfect Drug&quot; on May 13, 1997, featuring remixes from Nothing Records act Meat Beat Manifesto and another recent addition to the label&#x27;s roster; Luke Vibert&#x27;s Plug project. Fellow Nothing Records act Coil was also invited to do a remix. However, they declined, citing lack of time, due to the recording of their album &quot;Backwards.&quot;

In 2014, David Lynch once again collaborated with Nine Inch Nails, directing their music video for &quot;Came Back Haunted,&quot; from the album &quot;Hesitation Marks&quot;. On November 7, 2016 the &quot;Lost Highway&quot; soundtrack was re-issued as a 180 gram double vinyl by Dutch label Music On Vinyl.

=== Plug ===
In 1995, the prolific, British electronic musician Luke Vibert debuted a project called Plug on seminal UK label Rising High Records, where he had previously released material under the name Wagon Christ. The Plug material showcased a different side of Vibert&#x27;s repertoire, foraying into the genres of drum &#x27;n&#x27; bass and jungle, which were reaching their peak in the British club scene. Plug began with a series of 12&quot; EPs, each an anagram of Vibert&#x27;s name; &quot;Visible Crater Funk&quot;, &quot;Rebuilt Kev&quot; and &quot;Versatile Crib Funk&quot;, the latter of which was moved under Rising High&#x27;s sub-label, Blue Angel Records.

In 1996, Plug followed up the EPs with a debut full-length through Blue Angel, entitled &quot;Drum &#x27;n&#x27; Bass for Papa&quot;. The following year, Blue Planet Recordings, a sub-label of Silver Planet Recordings, reissued the album, along with the single &quot;Me &amp; Mr. Sutton&quot;.

In 1997, Trent Reznor invited Plug to remix the Nine Inch Nails track &quot;The Perfect Drug&quot;, which had been heavily inspired by UK electronic music. There exists confusion about how Trent had come to know Vibert&#x27;s work, with Vibert himself stating, &quot;I could never understand how I got it (&quot;The Perfect Drug&quot; remix) in the first place. Somehow, Trent heard my stuff and really liked it.&quot; He added, &quot;Someone told me that Alex Paterson from The Orb played my Plug stuff for Trent and someone else told me that Coil played it for him. All I know is that Nothing got in contact with me for the Nine Inch Nails remix and then expressed interest in releasing &quot;Drum &#x27;N&#x27; Bass For Papa&quot;, so I guess I passed the test.&quot; Nothing Records label-mate Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto (who likewise appeared with a remix on Nine Inch Nails&#x27; &quot;The Perfect Drug&quot; single) credited himself as having introduced Vibert&#x27;s work to Reznor. Dangers had been a fan of Vibert&#x27;s, inviting him to remix Meat Beat Manifesto around the same time, on MBM&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s The Music&quot; single (under the Plug moniker) and the &quot;Original Fire&quot; EP (as Luke Vibert). At the time, Vibert also had a standing offer from UK label Ninja Tune to re-issue the album. Vibert ultimately opted to accept Reznor&#x27;s offer with Nothing Records.

On September 9, 1997, Nothing/Interscope released the double-disc collection, &quot;Drum &#x27;N&#x27; Bass For Papa + Plug EP&#x27;s 1, 2 &amp; 3&quot;, licensed from Blue Planet Recordings. The album compiled the Plug full-length alongside tracks from the &quot;Visible Crater Funk&quot;, &quot;Rebuilt Kev&quot; and &quot;Versatile Crib Funk&quot; EPs. However, there were some differences between the US and UK editions. The tracks &quot;Cut&quot; and &quot;Subtle (In Your Face)&quot; were replaced on the US edition by new mixes; &quot;Cut (&#x27;97 Remix)&quot; and &quot;A Subtle Blend,&quot; while the track &quot;The Life Of The Mind&quot; was omitted altogether, due to concerns over uncleared samples, which included dialogue from the Coen Brothers film Barton Fink. For the second disc of EPs, the songs &quot;Cheesy (Pic &#x27;N&#x27; Mix)&quot; from &quot;Rebuilt Kev&quot; and &quot;Crib Funk&quot; from &quot;Versatile Crib Funk&quot; were omitted, while the track titles for &quot;Tuff Rinse&quot; and &quot;Versatile&quot; were reversed.

The following year in 1998, Vibert would again appear on major labels, returning to his Wagon Christ alias for the &quot;Tally Ho!&quot; album, which was released on Virgin Records in the UK and Astralwerks in the US. In the years to follow, Vibert continued to further establish himself as one of the most well-known producers in underground, British electronic music, with releases under a variety of aliases, including Kerrier District, The Ace Of Clubs, Amen Andrews, Spac Hand Luke, Luke Warm and more, for a host of influential electronic labels, including Warp Records, Rephlex Records, Ninja Tune, Planet Mu, Mo&#x27; Wax and many more.

Vibert would later state that he was unable to continue the Plug project, stemming from his inability to record songs in the same style, due to changes in his equipment and recording techniques. Instead, Vibert created the Amen Andrews alias for Rephlex Records, which explored similar territory as Plug, under the revised recording techniques.

However, a wealth of unreleased Plug material still existed, which would slowly find its way out in subsequent years. In 2006, Todd Osborn and Tadd Mullinix&#x27;s Detroit-based label Rewind Records released Plug&#x27;s &quot;Here It Comes EP&quot;, which collected several unreleased tracks from the 90s Plug archives. In early 2011, Luke Vibert would go back to Ninja Tune, the label which nearly released the Plug material in 1997, to inform them that he found some long-lost, never before heard DATs of Plug material, dated from 1995 - 1998. Receptive to the material, Ninja Tune released it as the second, full-length Plug album, &quot;Back On Time&quot;, on January 9, 2012. To date, it stands as the final release under the Plug moniker.

Due to his propensity to produce under a myriad of monikers and labels, combined with his limited recording window as Plug, Vibert&#x27;s involvement with Nothing Records did not extend beyond &quot;Drum &#x27;N&#x27; Bass For Papa&quot;, aside from two of the album&#x27;s tracks featuring on the 1998 Nothing Records compilation, &quot;Nothing Changes&quot;. Vibert remains a well-known producer in electronic music, regularly releasing new material across a variety of electronic sub-genres.

=== 2wo ===
2wo (alternately written as Two) was the brainchild of heavy metal idol Rob Halford and guitarist John Lowery (better known as John 5). After spending nearly 20 years garnering mainstream success as frontman for heavy metal icons Judas Priest, having recorded 12 studio albums and selling nearly 50 million albums, Halford announced to the band on July 4, 1991 that he would be leaving. However, he wouldn&#x27;t officially depart from the band until May 1992, due to contractual obligations. That same year, Halford would launch a new heavy metal band, Fight. Fight would release two albums and an EP, before disbanding in autumn of 1995, when they were dropped by their label, Epic Records, due to sales falling below expectations.

Throughout the early 1990s, John Lowery had been working as a guitarist around Los Angeles, where he met producer Bob Marlette. Marlette would produce an EP for Lowery&#x27;s short-lived band, Red Square Black, entitled &quot;Square&quot;. The duo also helped write and record much of David Lee Roth&#x27;s &quot;DLR Band&quot; album. The blueprint for 2wo began in October 1995, when Halford first met Lowery. Halford recalled, &quot;I was at the Foundation Forum a few years back and a journalist friend of mine told me about John Lowery, the guitar player. John and I got in touch. We spent a few days together in Los Angeles and we started to just sit around with some guitars and write.&quot; Lowery then introduced Halford to producer Bob Marlette and the trio commenced work on some demo songs, which would become the foundation of 2wo. &quot;I created &#x27;Two&#x27; because I wanted to re-capture that tangible rush I experienced when I first launched my career,&quot; Halford explained. After a few months, the trio had pieced together a cassette demo, which Halford was playing for friends and colleagues.

While the project was still without a name, in February 1996, a chance encounter in New Orleans would lead the band onto Nothing Records. While visiting for Mardi Gras, Halford made an impromptu visit to Nothing Studios, where he met Trent Reznor. Halford recalled, &quot;I was in New Orleans at Mardi Gras, where I go every year, and was partying with some friends and they pointed out where Trent&#x27;s studio was. One of my friends said, &#x27;Why don&#x27;t you go knock on the door and say hi?&#x27; I never do that kind of thing. For whatever reason, I got out of the car and walked across the street and banged on the door. Rave Ogilvie opened the door and welcomed me in. We&#x27;d never met before, but he was just a really nice, cool guy and he showed me around the studio. A little while later Trent showed up and we&#x27;d never met before either. We just sat there and talked about this that and the other. He knew I had some demos with me and asked to listen to the music. He listened to it and asked me if I&#x27;d leave the cassette, which I did, and that was that really. We hung out together for a couple of more days, because he was in some of the parades and so forth. But then I just went back to Phoenix and didn&#x27;t hear anything from him for the longest time.&quot;

Trent would listen to the songs from Halford&#x27;s demo and go on to conceive a deeper vision for the work, as well as offer it a home at Nothing Records. Halford explained, &quot;Suddenly he calls me up and first of all offers me a record deal, which was great because I was looking for one. And then secondly, he gave me then his vision, his ideas of where he could see this music going.&quot; After the band accepted Reznor&#x27;s offer, additional work commenced on the album, which was already in near finished form by that time, with the band and Dave Olgivie recording in Vancouver, Canada, while Trent did additional work from Nothing Studios, with parts sent back and forth. Halford stated, &quot;Trent came in pretty much when the whole first sessions of the songs had been completed. They were well past the demo stage. We had practically mixed it down to where we felt we had something we were almost ready to release. What Trent did was basically strip it all down and re-build it. Essentially the songs are all there intact, but in terms of every aspect of the sound, drums, bass, guitars, vocals. All of that was totally re-developed. All the accessories, all the electronic sounds, samples, all of those came from Reznor and Reznor&#x27;s people.&quot; Reznor received an executive producer credit for his work on the album.

By September 1997, recording was completed on the album, now titled &quot;Voyeurs&quot;. With the added collaboration of Reznor and Olgivie, the songs took on more of an electronic industrial metal sound. The band initially announced their name as Gimp. After discovering another band was already using the name, they quickly changed their name to 2wo. &quot;Voyeurs&quot; was announced for release on March 10, 1998. One month prior to the release of the album, Halford would gain headlines after confirming his homosexuality to MTV. &quot;Voyeurs&quot; was led by the single &quot;I Am A Pig,&quot; which filmed a music video, shot by gay porn director Chi Chi Larue. The music video featured various porn stars and depicted non-explicit scenes of S&amp;M. While not banned, the music video received sparse airplay, due to its mature subject matter. 2wo also signed to East West Records for European distribution of &quot;Voyeurs&quot;. A Japanese edition of the album on DML would include one bonus track, entitled &quot;In My Head.&quot; Rob Halford&#x27;s website would later publish two additional unreleased tracks from the &quot;Voyeurs&quot; sessions as MP3s; &quot;Shout&quot; and &quot;Scream.&quot;

Upon the release of &quot;Voyeurs&quot;, the band launched a tour in support of the album, though several dates were later cancelled. The live band consisted of Halford, Lowery, Sid Riggs, Ray Riendeau and former Nine Inch Nails keyboardist James Woolley. The album received a polarizing response, as many Halford fans did not enjoy 2wo&#x27;s industrial sound, favoring his more traditional heavy metal sound. However, other fans embraced his diversity. &quot;Voyeurs&quot; went on to sell 47,000 copies, which was considered a commercial disappointment. When asked about his experiences with Nothing, Halford stated:

A second single from &quot;Voyeurs&quot;, &quot;Deep In The Ground,&quot; was considered for commercial release on East West Records in Europe, but plans were later scrapped. Upon completing their tour, Halford went back into the studio with Bob Marlette, recording demos for what was intended to be a follow-up album. One demo from these sessions, &quot;Silent Screams,&quot; was published on the 2wo website. However, member John Lowery would soon depart from 2wo, in favor of taking lead guitar duties for Nothing Records label-mates Marilyn Manson. Ultimately Halford&#x27;s plans for a sophomore album were scrapped, in favor of returning to his heavy metal roots, with a new project simply titled Halford. The debut Halford album, &quot;Resurrection&quot;, features the final, studio version of &quot;Silent Screams,&quot; as well as two other tracks from the original 2wo sessions; &quot;Slow Down&quot; and &quot;Drive,&quot; both of which were co-written with Bob Marlette. The break-up of 2wo likewise marked the end of the band&#x27;s time of Nothing Records, with &quot;Voyeurs&quot; remaining their only commercial release on the label.

In 2003, Rob Halford reunited with Judas Priest, where he continues to front the band to wide acclaim. After Lowery&#x27;s tenure with Marilyn Manson ended in 2004, he continued to perform under the name John 5. In addition to releasing solo material, he has served as guitarist for Rob Zombie since 2005. In the years since, both Halford and much of his fanbase have adopted a warmer disposition in regards to the 2wo material. Halford acknowledged a demand for a reissue of &quot;Voyeurs&quot;, stating &quot;Everyone&#x27;s asking me about 2wo. The reason that we really haven&#x27;t gone there yet is because we&#x27;re trying to figure out all of the business side of that scenario. When I separated from Sanctuary in London, they gave me the opportunity to buy back all of my Halford solo material. You know, obviously the recordings and the photos and the videos and everything else. So we did a really sweet deal there and then Sony BMG have been really cool about me gaining access to all of the Fight material, because that was originally on Epic. The 2wo project was with Trent Reznor&#x27;s label, Nothing Records, through Interscope. And I wasn&#x27;t really sure there would be that much demand for it, but the fact is that everybody keeps asking me about it and I&#x27;m really pleased about that. &#x27;Cause, to some extent, I think that it was overlooked, because it wasn&#x27;t metal as people know me for, but it was a fantastic collaboration with Trent and what I would like for people to hear are the original recordings that Trent first listened to. And then when he became involved with Dave &quot;Rave&quot; Ogilvie from Skinny Puppy in Vancouver, the three of us put our heads together and created that final CD. So I think that it would be great if everybody had an opportunity to listen to the original songs, because they are a lot tougher, you know, they&#x27;re a lot edgier. They&#x27;ve got more of a rock/metal vibe going to them.&quot; Several of these original versions were in fact published on Rob Halford&#x27;s website in the early 2000s, under the name &quot;The Pre-Reznor Mixes&quot; (&quot;I Am A Pig,&quot; &quot;Water&#x27;s Leaking,&quot; &quot;Leave Me Alone,&quot; &quot;Deep In The Ground&quot; and &quot;Bed Of Rust&quot;). They continue to circulate on the Internet amongst fans, but to date, neither the pre-Reznor mixes, nor the &quot;Voyeurs&quot; album, have been reissued.

=== 12 Rounds ===
12 Rounds is a British rock band formed by Atticus Ross, Claudia Sarne and Adam Holden, after being introduced by mutual friends at a carnival. The trio first began collaborating musically on the 1995 Bomb The Bass album, &quot;Clear&quot;. Through their time in the studio together, they decided to form their own band, originally named 12 Rounds With Jesus. After appearing with a demo of their song &quot;Holed&quot; for a cassette compilation for NME Magazine, entitled &quot;Past Forward&quot;, the band was offered a deal with Polydor Records. The band then shorted their name to 12 Rounds and brought on drummer Andy Crisp.

The band&#x27;s first release came in 1995, in the form of their self-titled &quot;12 Rounds E.P.&quot; (also known as the &quot;Something&#x27;s Burning E.P.&quot;). The E.P. featured four tracks from their debut album, &quot;Jitter Juice&quot;, while the 12&quot; version also featured an additional remix of &quot;Something&#x27;s Burning,&quot; entitled &quot;Something Dub.&quot; The band followed with the album &quot;Jitter Juice&quot; in 1996. The &quot;Personally E.P.&quot; arrived later that year, which featured two album tracks and two exclusive songs; &quot;Happy Hour&quot; and &quot;Feel My Beard.&quot; 12 Rounds would also release a double single from the album; &quot;Business / Pleasant Smell&quot;. Music videos were filmed for three tracks from the album; &quot;Holed,&quot; &quot;Business&quot; and &quot;Personally,&quot; the latter of which was helmed by acclaimed director Chris Cunningham. The track &quot;Something&#x27;s Burning&quot; was also featured on the soundtrack to the film All Over Me.

12 Rounds toured the UK in support of &quot;Jitter Juice&quot;, opening for Sneaker Pimps. The band also played the UK festival circuit. Despite their touring and support from a major label, the band failed to attain much commercial success in their native country and received no international distribution, therefore remaining largely unknown outside of the UK. The band were ultimately dropped from Polydor and member Adam Holden parted ways with the band. Claudia Sarne recalled, &quot;We were the antithesis of everything Britpop represents. So we didn&#x27;t go down a treat here in England when our first record came out. Our first album was rather punk and raw and in the environment of Britpop and trip hop, it really didn&#x27;t stand a chance.&quot;

During the summer of 1997, the band recorded an album&#x27;s worth of material in their basement studio, with Atticus&#x27;s brother Leopold Ross splitting guitar duties with keyboardist / guitarist Mark De Lane Lea, as well as Stanley Adler on cello. Trent Reznor would hear this material and offer them a deal with Nothing Records. However, 12 Rounds was courted by numerous other labels as well. Claudia stated, &quot;We were shocked by the influx of offers, but Nothing was so right for us because it&#x27;s so artist-led. It&#x27;s really the difference between feeling like a handmade Bristol and being on a Ford conveyor belt.&quot; Their sophomore album, &quot;My Big Hero,&quot; featured eight new tracks, alongside two songs from &quot;Jitter Juice&quot;; &quot;Something&#x27;s Burning&quot; and &quot;Pleasant Smell&quot; (though both would have minor differences from their original versions). &quot;Pleasant Smell&quot; was released as a single on Nothing ahead of the album on June 9, 1998, featuring remixes from Trent Reznor, Charlie Clouser and Keith Hillebrandt of Nine Inch Nails, as well as Nothing Records label-mate Clint Mansell. A music video was also released for &quot;Pleasant Smell.&quot; The single was followed by the release of &quot;My Big Hero&quot; on July 14, 1998. The band then went on their first tours of the United States, with Kirk Hellie joining the band to take over guitar duties. They took opening slots for VAST and Nothing Records label-mates Marilyn Manson, as part of the first leg of their Mechanical Animals tour.

After touring &quot;My Big Hero,&quot; the band began work on a third album, produced by Ben Hiller. After completing initial recording in England, Claudia and Atticus moved to Los Angeles in 2000 and began to do further production work on the album with Trent Reznor and former Nine Inch Nails drummer Jerome Dillon. During this time, however, Nothing Records was beginning to face an uncertain future as a record label. Nothing&#x27;s parent label, Interscope, was moved under new management as part of the Vivendi / Universal merger. 12 Rounds found themselves lost in the shuffle of these corporate mergers. The band completed the album, but to date it has never been released. Meanwhile, the band remained under contract with Nothing, unable to release the music elsewhere at that time.

However, in 2002, signs of an album release did briefly arise, when artwork for a promo EP surfaced, entitled &quot;Select New Recordings 2002&quot;. The promo featured four tracks; &quot;Dead Man,&quot; &quot;Conspiracy,&quot; &quot;Ring Pull&quot; and &quot;Could U Be,&quot; while the artwork featured reused designs from &quot;My Big Hero&quot;. Claudia Sarne stated on the 12 Rounds website that the band sent fifteen tracks for mastering from the third album, twelve of which would compose the final tracklist. Though a title for the third album was never revealed, the final track list was later published on the 12 Rounds website; 1. High Times, 2. Conspiracy, 3. Could U Be, 4. Big Love, 5. Ring Pull, 6. Still Water, 7. Xocet, 8. Sioux &#x27;86, 9. Chicane, 10. Bits &amp; Pieces, 11. Dead Man, 12. Shine On.

Two additional tracks mentioned by Claudia as part of these sessions, but not included on the album, were &quot;Everything I Want (Drown)&quot; and &quot;Another Day With My Friend.&quot; The latter would be released in 2000 on the soundtrack to the Tom Tykwer film The Princess and the Warrior, under the name &quot;Just Another Day.&quot; Despite being a 12 Rounds-penned track, the song was credited to composers Pale 3 (a band which included director Tom Tykwer), &quot;featuring&quot; 12 Rounds. The song &quot;Dead Man&quot; also briefly appeared in the 2007 film . Another track from the band&#x27;s time on Nothing, &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Dead,&quot; was recorded for a proposed Nothing Records compilation, but the project never materialized. The track has never been officially released, however a live version recorded in 1998 can be found on the internet.

With 12 Rounds stuck in limbo, due to the eventual collapse of Nothing Records, the band began working on outside projects. Atticus Ross began recording on the Tapeworm project, alongside Reznor, Danny Lohner, Charlie Clouser and Maynard James Keenan, alongside a host of guest collaborators. Photos surfaced on the short-lived Tapeworm website, showing Atticus in the studio with the band. However, the Tapeworm material would likewise never see the light of day.

In 2004, Atticus joined his brother Leopold Ross in forming the noise rock band Error, though it would be short-lived, with a one-off E.P. being released on Epitaph Records. Atticus also made contributions to another of Leopold&#x27;s rock bands, Nojahoda, although that project would also be short-lived. Atticus began to deepen his musical collaboration with Trent Reznor, beginning with the Nine Inch Nails album &quot;With Teeth&quot; in 2005. Meanwhile, Claudia Sarne would collaborate with Nothing label-mate Clint Mansell, to provide vocals to the main theme to the film The Hole in 2001. She later joined former Nine Inch Nails member Jerome Dillon&#x27;s band nearLY in 2006. After the completion nearLY&#x27;s debut album &quot;Reminder,&quot; the band played a handful of select live performances. These performances were recorded as a live CD/DVD, entitled &quot;Reminder Live&quot;, which was self-released by the band. It included a performance of &quot;Chicane,&quot; one of the songs from 12 Rounds&#x27; unreleased third album. After the release of &quot;Reminder Live&quot;, Claudia announced her departure from nearLY, with the band as a whole quietly dissolving shortly after.

In 2005, Claudia and Atticus were married. Atticus continued to emerge as an in-demand producer and programmer, working with the likes of Barry Adamson, Coheed And Cambria, Pink, Bad Religion, Korn, Saul Williams and more. Claudia and Atticus also continued to collaborate musically, shifting their focus to the film world. The couple began composing music for the cable television drama &quot;Touching Evil&quot;, which was produced by the Hughes Brothers. Allen Hughes subsequently invited Atticus to compose music for his segment of the film &quot;New York, I Love You&quot; in 2008, followed by his feature film &quot;The Book of Eli&quot; in 2010.

That same year, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross composed their first collaborative film score together, for the David Fincher film &quot;The Social Network&quot;, for which the pair won the Academy Award for Best Original Score. The duo has gone on to recorded numerous additional film scores together to critical acclaim, including &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot;, for which the pair won the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media, &quot;Gone Girl&quot;, &quot;Before The Flood&quot;, &quot;Patriots Day&quot;, the Ken Burns documentary &quot;Vietnam&quot; and more. Atticus likewise garnered acclaim as a solo film composer, composing scores to Love &amp; Mercy, &quot;Blackhat&quot;, &quot;Triple 9&quot;, the TV series &quot;Outcast&quot; and more, all of which featured contributions from Claudia Sarne as well. The 2013 Allen Hughes film &quot;Broken City&quot; was a particularly noteworthy 12 Rounds reunion of sorts, featuring contributions from the entire current line-up of Atticus Ross, Claudia Sarne, Leopold Ross and Kirk Hellie.

Outside of their film compositions, Atticus continued his close musical partnership with Trent Reznor, recording on the Nine Inch Nails albums &quot;Year Zero&quot;, &quot;Ghosts I–IV&quot;, &quot;The Slip&quot; and &quot;Hesitation Marks&quot;. In 2010, Ross was announced as a member of How to Destroy Angels, a project with Trent Reznor and his wife Mariqueen Mandig-Reznor. The band derived their name from a song by fellow Nothing Records act Coil. They released a self-titled EP in 2010, followed by &quot;An Omen EP&quot; in 2012 and finally a full-length album, &quot;Welcome Oblivion&quot; in 2013. The band also did a small tour in support of the album. In 2016, after over a decade of musical partnership with Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross was announced as an official member of Nine Inch Nails, with the arrival of the &quot;Not the Actual Events&quot; EP.

After finally reacquiring the rights to their unreleased third album, in 2009, 12 Rounds released two tracks from the album, &quot;Xecot&quot; and &quot;Shine On,&quot; as digital downloads on their website, followed by a third track, &quot;Sioux 86,&quot; in 2010. Trent Reznor was credited with additional recording for the track &quot;Shine On.&quot; In 2014, the members of 12 Rounds reunited for a performance at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles, California, as part of a Q&amp;A event with Atticus Ross and Elvis Mitchell for the Los Angeles Film Festival. It marked the first ever live performance by the current line-up of the band, featuring Atticus Ross, Claudia Sarne, Leopold Ross and Kirk Hellie, as well as the first performance of any kind by the band in over a decade. While not officially billed as a 12 Rounds show, the band played a short set of assorted material from their film scores, before closing their set with a performance of the song &quot;Chicane&quot; from their unreleased third album.

12 Rounds was one of the few acts to remain with Nothing Records until the demise of the label, with their third album becoming one of the most oft-requested, unreleased works of the Nothing Records era. Atticus has stated the album will likely one day be released in digital format, but has described it a slow process, due to his full-time commitments to Nine Inch Nails and film composing. While 12 Rounds has never officially disbanded, the members continue to primarily focus their musical collaborations on film compositions, mostly refraining from crediting themselves under their band name.

=== Meat Beat Manifesto (Actual Sounds + Voices era) ===
After completing touring in support of &quot;Subliminal Sandwich&quot;, Meat Beat Manifesto would release a follow-up compilation, entitled &quot;Original Fire,&quot; on May 20, 1997. &quot;Original Fire&quot; compiled new songs, remixes and updated versions of classic tracks from the band and became a North American exclusive of Nothing Records. Play It Again Sam opted against releasing it in Europe, due in part to the fact that some of the tracks had been previously released by them on earlier, European singles from the band, such as 1996&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s the Music&quot; single, which featured a remix from Nothing Records act Plug. Amongst the remix artists on &quot;Original Fire&quot;, fellow Nothing Records labelmate Luke Vibert appeared once again, this time under his own name, as well as The Orb. The band would release a music video for the song &quot;Helter Skelter &#x27;97&quot; in support of &quot;Original Fire&quot;, which was directed by band member Ben Stokes. Stokes also directed the band&#x27;s music videos for &quot;Edge of No Control,&quot; &quot;Asbestos Lead Asbestos&quot; and &quot;Fromage,&quot; as well as directing an early video for Nothing Records label-mates Nine Inch Nails, for their song &quot;Down In It&quot; (in addition to editing their &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; music video). &quot;Helter Skelter &#x27;97&quot; would also be pressed as a promo single CD by Nothing Records for radio airplay. Nothing would also release most of the tracks from &quot;Original Fire&quot; on vinyl, under the name of the &quot;Radio Babylon&quot; promo-only, LP single. The 2xLP version featured an exclusive, bonus remix from Luke Vibert.

The band then set about recording their next studio album, &quot;Actual Sounds + Voices&quot;. The album was led by the single &quot;Acid Again,&quot; which was released on July 7, 1998 and also received European release via Play It Again Sam. &quot;Actual Sounds + Voices&quot; followed on August 28, 1998 on Nothing Records, with a European release through Play It Again Sam. Nothing even released a double LP version of the album on vinyl. &quot;Actual Sounds + Voices&quot; featured a more prominent use of jazz, while still maintaining the group&#x27;s signature sound. One remix from the &quot;Acid Again&quot; single, as well as the &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; track from &quot;Actual Sounds + Voices&quot; also appeared on the Nothing Records compilation &quot;Nothing Changes&quot;, which was included with a 1998 issue of XLR8R Magazine.

A second single from the album, &quot;Prime Audio Soup,&quot; would go on to become a hit for the band, due in part to being featured in the successful action film The Matrix, as well as appearing on the film&#x27;s soundtrack, which also included Nothing Records label-mates Marilyn Manson. &quot;Prime Audio Soup&quot; was also released as a CD single in Europe on Play It Again Sam. The single featured remixes by Boards of Canada, The Herbaliser and Biomuse. While Nothing Records did press promo copies of the single, it was never commercially released by the label in the US.

Meat Beat Manifesto is one of the few acts to have seemingly left the label on good terms. As late as 1997, Jack Dangers commented that &quot;I really appreciate Trent&#x27;s willingness to put his money where his mouth is. Not many people have had the guts to do this. Everyone should know that Nothing have been incredibly supportive and they never try to manipulate my music. What I give them, they release ... no pressure. I have artistic freedom and support from a label that truly has their shit together. However, the band&#x27;s departure from the label would amount to nothing more than their contract expiring. All of the band&#x27;s releases on Nothing Records were licensed via Play It Again Sam. In 1999, the band&#x27;s contract with PIAS expired, which in turn ended their licensing arrangement with Nothing Records.

In the wake of their departure from Play It Again Sam, Jack Dangers would found his own label, Tino Corp., alongside frequent MBM members/collaborators Ben Stokes and Mike Powell. There, Meat Beat Manifesto would release the &quot;Eccentric Objects&quot; EP on vinyl in 2000, as well as &quot;Storm The Studio RMXS&quot; in 2003, featuring remixes by DJ Spooky, Antipop Consortium, Jonah Sharp, Merzbow and more.

However, in 2002, when it came time to release their next studio album, &quot;RUOK?&quot;, the band opted to release it through Run Recordings, a division of Lakeshore Records. The label would also reissue their &quot;Storm The Studio&quot; and &quot;Armed Audio Warfare&quot; albums in 2003. That same year, the band released &quot;... In Dub&quot;, a dub remix album of tracks from &quot;RUOK?&quot;. The band also released their first DVD, &quot; ... In Dub 5.1 Surround&quot; in 2004.

For their next album, &quot;At the Center&quot;, the band would take a departure in sound, recording a full blown jazz album. A collaboration between Dangers and several jazz musicians, the album was released on Thirsty Ear in 2005, as part of their Blue Series. Thirsty Ear would also release the album&#x27;s companion EP, &quot;Off-Centre&quot;. The band would release their second DVD, &quot;Travelogue Live &#x27;05&quot;, in 2006.

In 2007, the band would self-release &quot;Archive Things 1982-88 / Purged&quot;, a collection of early recordings. This was followed by their next studio album, &quot;Autoimmune&quot;, in 2008. The album would see a U.S. release via Metropolis Records, with a UK release via Planet Mu. Each version of the album had a slightly different tracklist from one another, as well as different artwork.

In 2010, the band released their next studio album, &quot;Answers Come in Dreams&quot;. The album&#x27;s name is derived from a pair of remixes Jack Dangers did for Nothing Records label-mates Coil in 1991, for their E.P. &quot;The Snow&quot;. The album was once again released in the U.S. on Metropolis Records, while the UK release was handled by the Hydrogen Dukebox label.

Meat Beat Manifesto&#x27;s time on Nothing Records was, by all accounts, a positive experience for the band, with their departure primarily due to logistical reasons. In the years since, Dangers has spent his time bouncing from label to label, as well as self-releasing quite a bit of the band&#x27;s material.
Since the release of &quot;Answers Come in Dreams&quot;, the band has kept something of a low profile. However, they have not been entirely dormant, self-releasing a couple of EPs and playing select live dates. Rumors persist of a new album being in the works, though to date, nothing has been announced.

=== Marilyn Manson (Mechanical Animals era) ===
After the success of &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;, Marilyn Manson entered the studio with much mainstream attention to record their third full-length album, &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot;. Unlike their first two albums, &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; would not be shepherded by Trent Reznor, who had shifted his focus back to Nine Inch Nails. Instead, the band enlisted Michael Beinhorn as principal producer, co-producing the record with Marilyn Manson, with Sean Beavan providing additional production duties. During this time, the band would also relocate from Fort Lauderdate, Florida, to Los Angeles, California, where recording commenced on the album.

Inspired heavily by David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; album, &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; shifted away from the industrial rock style of the band&#x27;s earlier work, instead emulating a 1970s glam rock sound, epitomized by artists of that decade such as Bowie, Queen and T. Rex. Conceptually, the album delved into Manson&#x27;s own struggles with fame and alienation. Manson described the album as being about &quot;someone who feels like they&#x27;re in a place where they&#x27;re not accepted or don&#x27;t belong. It&#x27;s more from that perspective. It&#x27;s much more vulnerable music that I&#x27;m making on this new album. Both sonically and lyrically, it&#x27;s about the depression of alienation, rather than the aggressiveness of it. It&#x27;s about the emptiness.&quot; The album was a rock opera and concept album, continuing an overarching story concept, which began with &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;, while the events of &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; precede it.

&quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; was released on September 14, 1998 on Nothing / Interscope Records. The cover art depicted an androgynous Manson, naked with breasts, six fingers and airbrushed genitalia, which stirred up more controversy for the band. One month before the album&#x27;s release, the three largest retailers in the United States at the time—K-Mart, Wal-Mart and Target—refused to stock the album, citing the cover artwork and its Parental Advisory sticker. In spite of this, the album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with first-week sales of 223,000 units, making it the first Marilyn Manson album to top the charts. The album was led by the single &quot;The Dope Show&quot;, which received heavy video and radio airplay and would go on to become the band&#x27;s most commercially successful song. The music video was inspired by Alejandro Jodorowsky&#x27;s film &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot;, as well as the David Bowie starring film &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth.&quot;

The band launched a series of tours to promote the album, the first being the Mechanical Animals Tour. Prior to the tour, guitarist Zim Zum opted to part ways with the band, leaving under amicable terms in order to pursue outside projects. He was replaced by Nothing Records label-mate John Lowery, who was fresh off his run with Rob Halford&#x27;s 2wo project. After joining Marilyn Manson, Lowery assumed the stage name of John 5. The U.S. leg of the tour featured Nothing Records label-mates 12 Rounds performing as openers. The band then announced a co-headlining tour with Hole, called the Beautiful Monsters Tour. The tour would be ill-fated, however, due to conflicts between Manson and Hole singer Courtney Love. This led to Hole departing the tour after just nine dates. Manson subsequently enlisted Jack Off Jill and Nashville Pussy to take over select opening slots. Monster Magnet, who were already opening for Manson, assumed Hole&#x27;s place on the tour&#x27;s playbill, with the tour being renamed the Rock Is Dead Tour. The final four dates of the tour were canceled out of respect for the victims of the Columbine High School massacre, which brought Manson arguably the greatest controversy of his career, as the media mistakenly accused him of influencing the shooters.

The second single from the album, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me)&quot;, was another video and radio hit for the band. The third single, &quot;Rock Is Dead&quot;, was featured in the accompanying soundtrack of the film &quot;The Matrix&quot;, with the song being played during the film&#x27;s end credits. The final single from the album was &quot;Coma White.&quot;

While &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; did garner critical acclaim, it was initially met with disappointment by longtime fans, who disliked the more mainstream sound, as well as the band&#x27;s departure in style from their darker, more aggressive material. In time though, some fans adopted a warmer disposition to the material. In the wake of the album, tensions also mounted between Marilyn Manson and Trent Reznor, with both sides increasingly criticizing one other in the press. Reznor described Manson as willing to cross anyone in order to succeed, while Manson accused Reznor of destroying masters and mixes to many of the band&#x27;s early, Reznor-produced songs. The two sides appeared to reconcile for a short time after &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot;, when Manson appeared in Nine Inch Nails&#x27; Starfuckers, Inc. music video and made a surprise appearance at Nine Inch Nails&#x27; concert on May 9, 2000 at Madison Square Garden in New York City, performing with the band during &quot;Starfuckers, Inc.,&quot; followed by a performance of &quot;The Beautiful People.&quot; The reconciliation was short-lived, however, with both sides resuming their verbal barbs at one another through the press and their websites. In more recent years, however, tensions seem to have subsided between the two. In 2011, Reznor described Manson as &quot;a talented person,&quot; adding &quot;we&#x27;ve had our problems, but I wear suits ... I&#x27;m an adult now.&quot; The following year, Manson expressed similar feelings, adding, &quot;I don&#x27;t have any bad feelings towards him (Reznor). I really don&#x27;t. He helped put me out into the world and I went my way and whatever happened happened. I don&#x27;t think there is tension.&quot;

&quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on February 25, 1999 and had sold over 1,409,000 copies in the United States. It remains one of the highest selling albums to date for both the band and Nothing Records. The album was followed by the home video &quot;God Is in the TV&quot;, which chronicled the band&#x27;s tours in support of the album, as well as compiling all of their music videos to date. It was released on November 2, 1999 on VHS. A live album from the tour, &quot;The Last Tour on Earth&quot;, followed shortly thereafter on November 16, 1999. The live album ended with a studio outtake from &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;, entitled &quot;Astonishing Panorama of the Endtimes.&quot; A claymation music video for the song was released as a single, depicting Manson as part of the Celebrity Deathmatch television show.

=== Einstürzende Neubauten ===
Einstürzende Neubauten (sometimes written as EN, translated into English as Collapsing New Buildings) is an avant-garde, experimental group formed in West Berlin, Germany in 1980, by members Blixa Bargeld, N.U. Unruh and Alexander Hacke. The band established a following due to their innovative instrumentation, particularly at their live shows, which, in addition to traditional instruments, featured custom instruments built from scrap metal, found objects and power tools. Vocalist Blixa Bargeld also brought added attention by concurrently serving as long-time guitarist and backing vocalist for Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds from 1983 to 2003.

Over the course of the 1980s, the band would rise through the ranks of many established labels, such as Some Bizzare Records and Rough Trade Records, where they released albums such as &quot;Kollaps&quot;, &quot;Zeichnungen des Patienten O. T.&quot; (English translation: &quot;Drawings of Patient O.T.&quot;), the best of / rarities compilation &quot;Strategies Against Architecture 80-83&quot; and &quot;Halber Mensch&quot; (English translation: &quot;Half Man&quot;). Fellow, future Nothing Records label-mate Raymond Watts of Pig would also frequently serve as an engineer for the band throughout the 1980s, both in the studio and at live shows. The band capped off the 80s with the albums &quot;Fünf auf der nach oben offenen Richterskala&quot; (English translation: &quot;Five on the Open-Ended Richter Scale&quot;) and &quot;Haus der Lüge&quot; (English translation: &quot;House of the Lie&quot;), both of which proved to be commercial successes in the U.S. The band&#x27;s rise through the 1980s paved the way for a deal with Mute Records in the 1990s, beginning with &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot; in 1992. The album marked a change in sound for the band, shifting into softer, less abrasive songwriting and featuring expanded use of electronics. The band would also release a sequel compilation, &quot;Strategies Against Architecture II&quot;, during this time.

The recording of their next album, &quot;Ende Neu&quot; (English translation: &quot;Ending New&quot;), would prove to be a difficult one, due to the departure of long-time members Mark Chung, who left at the outset of recording in 1994, as well as F.M. Einheit, who contributed much to the music and sound of the band and left a short time later in 1995, amidst recording of the album. Blixa Bargeld questioned if the band would continue, stating &quot;There was suddenly only three of us left, which makes it a bit tough.&quot; The band continued on, however, bringing on Jochen Arbeit and Rudolph Moser as permanent members, alongside Ash Wednesday on keyboards for live concerts. &quot;Ende Neu&quot; was completed and released on Mute Records in 1996, with the song &quot;Stella Marris,&quot; a duet between Bargeld and Hacke&#x27;s then-wife, singer Meret Becker, garnering particular acclaim. The band supported the album with a world tour.

Trent Reznor had been a long-time fan of the band, openly citing his admiration for their music. Blixa Bargeld recalled meeting him at some Einstürzende Neubauten shows, stating, &quot;Trent Reznor used to come backstage at (our) 80s concerts.&quot; In 1997, Reznor successfully arranged to bring the band aboard Nothing Records. The band, which held the copyright to their album, liked the appeal of additional major label support, as well as Reznor&#x27;s enthusiasm for their body of work and agreed to a licensing deal with Nothing Records. Bargeld recalled, &quot;Trent Reznor is so kind to contract the band, (which) he always admired.&quot;

The road for Einstürzende Neubauten&#x27;s release on Nothing Records would prove to be a long one, however, with repeated delays pushing the Stateside release of &quot;Ende Neu&quot; back until late 1998. The album was finally released in the U.S. on October 20, 1998, featuring a bonus track, &quot;Bili Ruben.&quot; A music video for &quot;Stella Maris&quot; accompanied the album, which received minor airplay on MTV. Nothing also financed a U.S. tour for the band that autumn, which became expensive, due in part to bringing along all of the band&#x27;s custom instrumentation from Germany. The tour lost an estimated $40,000 for the label, according to Bargeld.

In Europe, the band released the companion album &quot;Ende Neu Remixes&quot; on Mute Records in 1997, which featured &quot;Ende Neu&quot; tracks remixed by artists such as Barry Adamson, Pan Sonic and Darkus (a.k.a. Mark Rutherford). Darkus&#x27; remix tracks, alongside others not included on &quot;Ende Neu Remixes&quot;, were made available separately in the same year on &quot;The NNNAAAMMM Remixes By Darkus&quot;. Neither of these releases were picked up for licensing by Nothing Records.

Einstürzende Neubauten then set about recording their next album, &quot;Silence Is Sexy&quot;. By this point, much like fellow Nothing Records act 12 Rounds, the band found themselves victim to the same corporate shake-up. Nothing Records&#x27; parent company, Interscope Records, was merged with Geffen Records and A&amp;M Records, after Interscope&#x27;s owners, Seagram, purchased the other labels. By early 1999, shortly after the release of &quot;Ende Neu&quot;, Interscope Records began operating under the umbrella of Interscope Geffen A&amp;M Records. The new ownership began actively looking to cut costs and made it clear they did not have any further interest in releasing Einstürzende Neubauten&#x27;s material, with Bargeld stating, &quot;Seagrams acquired them (Nothing / Interscope). We gave them the (&quot;Silence Is Sexy&quot;) album and (Nothing Records) said that Seagrams decided not to release the record. I asked if that was a joke. We make a record deal, then they don&#x27;t release it, so we left them.&quot; With Nothing licensing the music directly from the band, Einstürzende Neubauten were able to immediately depart from the situation. The band decided to instead allow Mute Records to handle both the European and American releases of &quot;Silence Is Sexy&quot;, with the album being released in 2000.

&quot;Strategies Against Architecture III&quot; followed soon after in 2001 and the band fulfilled their contract with Mute Records. Beginning in 2002, the band began recording a new album, without support from a major label, relying instead upon fan support in an experiment on their website, offering exclusive audio in exchange for paid membership. An exclusive &quot;Supporter Album No. 1&quot; and the &quot;Airplane Miniatures&quot; E.P. were made available to supporters in 2003. The band would follow this template for years to come, releasing a myriad of exclusive titles to their fans. The band released the album &quot;Perpetuum Mobile&quot; in 2004, once again returning to Mute, in part to help facilitate a world tour. &quot;Alles wieder offen&quot; (English translation: &quot;All Open Again&quot;) followed in 2007, which was self-released on the band&#x27;s own Potomak label. In 2014, the band returned to a major label for the release of &quot;Lament&quot; on BMG Records.

Einstürzende Neubauten&#x27;s time on Nothing Records would be brief, with &quot;Ende Neu&quot; standing as their sole release on the label. In 2009, &quot;Ende Neu&quot; was reissued as a remastered CD, with an expanded booklet, on Neubauten&#x27;s own Potomak label. The band continues strong to this day, having garnered much critical and commercial success. They are considered to be one of the pioneers of industrial music, despite their own apathy to such accreditation. The band continues their formula of releasing major albums on labels, supplemented by a wealth of self-released material direct to fans.

=== Autechre ===
Autechre arrived at Nothing via a licensing deal with their UK label, Warp Records, as part of a package which also included Warp acts Squarepusher and Plaid being picked up by the label. Autechre is the duo of Rob Brown and Sean Booth of Greater Manchester, England. Their sound was considered pioneering within the electronic music scene, with their early work rooted in techno, house, electro and hip hop, while their later efforts ventured into more experimental soundscapes. At the time, Warp was emerging as one of the premier labels for electronic music, with many of their acts being licensed to esteemed labels in the US, such as Sire (Aphex Twin, Jimi Tenor), Matador (Red Snapper, Two Lone Swordsmen) and Wax Trax! (Nightmares On Wax, Autechre). These licensing deals, in addition to Warp&#x27;s highly acclaimed Artificial Intelligence series, in which Autechre participated, would help cement both Warp Records and their rosters&#x27; global presence and influence. Nothing Records became the next in this revered line of labels to collaborate with Warp, after Nothing label-mate Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto claimed to have introduced many of the Warp acts&#x27; music to Trent Reznor.

Prior to their arrival at Nothing, much of Autechre&#x27;s back-catalog had seen release through Wax Trax! / TVT, in a similar licensing deal with Warp, which saw the US release of their EP, &quot;Basscad.EP&quot;, as well as their albums &quot;Incunabula&quot;, &quot;Amber&quot; and &quot;Tri Repetae++&quot;, the latter of which was packaged as a double-disc set to include their &quot;Anvil Vapre&quot; and &quot;Garbage&quot; EPs. After the licensing deal with Wax Trax! lapsed, Autechre released their &quot;Chiastic Slide&quot; album, which did not receive US release at the time.

By 1998, Autechre had completed their fifth album, &quot;LP5&quot;. Upon being picked up by Nothing Records, Autechre&#x27;s Sean Brown commented on the advantages of being on a major label, stating &quot;It&#x27;s really interesting working with him (Trent Reznor). It&#x27;s a learning exercise as much as anything. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going to happen with it (being on Nothing Records). It&#x27;s a long time going and it&#x27;s like after that, whatever, if someone comes along and offers you a ridiculous amount of money. It&#x27;s much more than we needed, but it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s turned out really useful, because we&#x27;ve managed to get everything going.&quot;

&quot;LP5&quot; was released on October 26, 1998 on Nothing Records in the US, with the label releasing Plaid&#x27;s &quot;Not For Threes&quot; and Squarepusher&#x27;s &quot;Big Loada&quot; the same day. Two tracks from the album, &quot;Vose In&quot; and &quot;Corc,&quot; also appeared on the Nothing Records compilation &quot;Nothing Changes&quot;, which was included with a 1998 issue of XLR8R Magazine. Autechre would continue to be licensed by Nothing Records until 2000, with Nothing working in tandem with Warp to release nearly all of the duo&#x27;s new material in the US during this period. In 1999, Nothing released Autechre&#x27;s &quot;Peel Session&quot; (a live recording from John Peel&#x27;s legendary radio show - a second session of which was released by Warp in 2000) and &quot;EP7&quot;. The Warp CD edition of &quot;EP7&quot; included a hidden track 00, which could be heard by starting track one of the CD, then rewinding backwards. Manufacturing issues prevented the hidden track 00 from inclusion on the Nothing Records edition. Also in 1999, Autechre released the &quot;SplitRmx12&quot; promo-only 12&quot;, which featured an Autechre cover of Neu!. While &quot;SplitRmx12&quot; never received any official release through Nothing Records, Warp pressed 3,000 copies, with 500 assigned to the UK. A portion were assigned to the US, for which Nothing Records assisted in North American distribution to US record stores, on behalf of Warp.

Autechre&#x27;s time at Nothing Records would conclude when Warp Records established their own US distribution, though a deal with Caroline Distribution (which has since ended), effectively ending all of Warp&#x27;s licensing to Nothing. Autechre&#x27;s licensing through Wax Trax! and Nothing Records helped establish a US following for the act and by the time they began receiving direct US release via Warp, the duo had risen in stature to being one of the premier acts in electronic music. All three of their Nothing Records releases were eventually reissued in the US under the Warp umbrella, after the Nothing deal ended. Autechre remain going strong to this day, where they continue to call Warp Records their home, having released numerous albums to critical acclaim in the years to follow, such as &quot;Confield&quot;, &quot;Draft 7.30&quot;, &quot;Untilted&quot;, &quot;Quaristice&quot;, &quot;Oversteps&quot;, &quot;Exai&quot; and &quot;elseq 1–5&quot;.

=== Squarepusher ===
Squarepusher, much like label-mates Autechre and Plaid, came aboard Nothing via a licensing deal with Warp. Squarepusher is Tom Jenkinson of Chelmsford, Essex, England. After learning bass guitar and playing in local bands in his youth, Tom began taking an interest in techno and house music in the early 1990s. Amongst his influences were Aphex Twin and future Nothing Records label-mate Luke Vibert, particularly with his work as Plug. Jenkinson said of Plug&#x27;s track &quot;Military Jazz,&quot; &quot;This track came on and, amongst the road noise and chatter, I heard what I thought was some sort of hip-hop track being played by a band. As the track progressed, I became more intrigued, as it sounded like they were trying to play as if it had been programmed. Then the Amen [break] came in, and I was floored; it sounded like a drummer playing breakbeats, and made me totally rethink my ideas of programming breaks.&quot;

Jenkinson&#x27;s first recordings came out under his own name, with the &quot;Stereotype E.P.&quot; on the Nothings Clear label in 1994, which was financed by Jenkinson himself, alongside his friend Hardy Finn, the latter of whom would go on to found the Spymania label. The EP did not receive the level of attention Jenkinson had hoped for, but it did catch the ear of Grant Wilson-Claridge of Rephlex Records, who contacted Tom to express his compliments.

Jenkinson went on to record a few more releases under his own name, including the &quot;Crot E.P.&quot; and &quot;Bubble And Squeak E.P.&quot;, as well as a split with Dunderhead, called &quot;Dragon Disc 2&quot;. In 1995, Tom began releasing music under the name Squarepusher, first appearing with the &quot;Conumber E:P&quot;, then following with &quot;Alroy Road Tracks&quot; under the name Duke Of Harringay, both on Finn&#x27;s Spymania label. By 1996, Squarepusher had line up material for release at Rephlex Records, which was operated by Grant Wilson-Claridge and Richard D. James, a.k.a. Aphex Twin. Squarepusher released the &quot;Squarepusher Plays...&quot; 12&quot; for Rephlex, followed by his debut album, &quot;Feed Me Weird Things&quot; (Jenkinson later released an album and E.P. under the name Chaos A.D. for Rephlex in 1998).

Shortly after the release of &quot;Feed Me Weird Things&quot;, Squarepusher released his first music for Warp Records in the form of the &quot;Port Rhombus EP&quot; in 1996. Jenkinson signed a multi-album deal with Warp and the label would become his long-time and primary home. The &quot;Vic Acid&quot; EP was released in 1997, followed by his sophomore full-length, &quot;Hard Normal Daddy&quot;. Later that year, Warp and Sypmania would co-release &quot;Burningn&#x27;n Tree&quot;, which compiled the &quot;Conumber E:P&quot; and &quot;Alroy Road Tracks&quot;, alongsing three previously unreleased tracks.

Also in 1997, the &quot;Big Loada&quot; EP was released on Warp. By 1998, the Nothing deal had come into place and Squarepusher would receive his first licensing into the United States, after Nothing label-mate Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto claimed to have introduced his music to Trent Reznor. Nothing decided to revisit the &quot;Big Loada&quot; EP and expand it into album length, adding on all tracks from the &quot;Port Rhombus EP&quot; and two tracks (&quot;Lone Ravers (Live In Chelmsford Mix)&quot; and &quot;The Barn (303 Kebab Mix)&quot;) from &quot;Vic Acid&quot;. The song &quot;Come On My Selector&quot; was also moved up to open the album, with a music video for the track directed by Chris Cunningham, which was included as a file on the Nothing edition, as an enhanced CD. Two tracks from &quot;Big Loada&quot;, &quot;Tequila Fish&quot; and &quot;Massif (Stay Strong),&quot; also featured on the Nothing Records compilation &quot;Nothing Changes&quot;, which was included with a 1998 issue of XLR8R Magazine.

Nothing did not pick up &quot;Hard Normal Daddy&quot; for release, but did pick up most of Squarepusher&#x27;s output through the remainder of the 1990s. &quot;Music Is Rotted One Note&quot; was released on October 13, 1998, the same day as Nothing version of &quot;Big Loada&quot;. The mini album &quot;Budakhan Mindphone&quot; followed on March 1, 1999. The &quot;Maximum Priest E.P.&quot; was released July 19, 1999, which featured remixes from Nothing Records label-mates Autechre and Luke Vibert (under the name Wagon Christ). The final Squarepusher album to see release on Nothing Records was &quot;Selection Sixteen&quot; on November 8, 1999. Aside from &quot;Big Loada&quot;, all of the Squarepusher releases on Nothing Records were essentially identical to the Warp editions.

Squarepusher&#x27;s tenure at Nothing Records concluded when Warp Records established their own US distribution, though a deal with Caroline Distribution (which later expired), effectively ending all of Warp&#x27;s licensing to Nothing. Squarepusher&#x27;s licensing through Nothing Records served Jenkinson well in helping to establish his US following. By the time he began receiving direct US release via Warp, Squarepusher had become known as one of the most innovative acts in electronic music. All five of his Nothing Records releases were eventually reissued in the US under the Warp umbrella after the Nothing deal ended, though the album-length version of &quot;Big Loada&quot; remains unique to Nothing Records, with Warp opting to keep the releases in their original, EP formats. Squarepusher continues to push new boundaries to this day, where he still calls Warp Records his home, having released numerous albums to critical acclaim in the years to follow, such as &quot;Go Plastic&quot;, &quot;Do You Know Squarepusher&quot;, &quot;Ultravisitor&quot;, &quot;Hello Everything&quot;, &quot;Just A Souvenir&quot;, &quot;Solo Electric Bass 1&quot;, &quot;Ufabulum&quot; and &quot;Damogen Furies&quot;. Also in recent years, Jenkinson has launched a live band, Shobaleader One, which releases both original material and reinterpered versions of Squarepusher classics. They have released two albums to date; &quot;d&#x27;Demonstrator&quot; and &quot;Elektrac&quot;.

=== Plaid ===
Plaid, alongside label-mates Autechre and Squarepusher, was part of a trio of Warp acts picked up for licensing in the United States after their label struck a deal with Nothing Records. Plaid is the British duo of Ed Handley and Andy Turner. Both began as founding members of the electronic group The Black Dog, alongside Ken Downie. Handley and Turner would appear on numerous albums with The Black Dog during the early 1990s, which received critical acclaim, including &quot;Bytes&quot;, &quot;Temple of Transparent Balls&quot;, &quot;Parallel&quot; and &quot;Spanners&quot;. In 1991, Handley and Turner released &quot;Mbuki Mvuki&quot;, their debut under the name of Plaid. The album was self-released on their Black Dog Productions imprint. They followed up in 1994 with a collaboration with Mind Over Rhythm, entitled &quot;Mind Over Rhythm Meets The Men From Plaid On The Planet Luv&quot; on Rumble Records.

After five years recording with The Black Dog, Handley and Turner opted to pursue recording as Plaid full-time in 1995, while Downie continued The Black Dog as a separate venture. Plaid released the &quot;Android&quot; EP that same year for the Clear label, before signing with Warp Records, which had previously worked with them, during their time with The Black Dog. Plaid released their debut album for Warp in 1997, entitled &quot;Not for Threes&quot;. The album was preceded by the single &quot;Undoneson&quot;. &quot;Not For Threes&quot; featured a notable guest appearance on the track &quot;Lilith&quot; from Björk, with whom the duo had collaborated many times over the years, providing remixing and songwriting duties for her on multiple occasions.

In 1998, Plaid was picked up for licensing on Nothing Records in the United States, after Nothing label-mate Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto claimed to have introduced the Warp acts to Trent Reznor. Nothing released the US edition of &quot;Not For Threes&quot; on October 13, 1998. The Nothing version removed the track &quot;OI&quot; off the album, while adding on &quot;Undoneson&quot; and &quot;Spudink&quot; from the &quot;Undoneson&quot; single. &quot;Undoneson&quot; and an exclusive remix, &quot;Abla Eedio (Freemix),&quot; also appeared on the Nothing Records compilation &quot;Nothing Changes&quot;, which was included with a 1998 issue of XLR8R Magazine.

In 1999, Plaid released &quot;Peel Session&quot;, a live recording from John Peel&#x27;s legendary radio show. Nothing released the &quot;Peel Session&quot; in the US on April 20, 1999, which featured no audio alterations from the Warp edition. Plaid followed up with a sophomore album, &quot;Rest Proof Clockwork&quot;, the same year. The album featured a hidden track called &quot;Face Me,&quot; featuring Alison Goldfrapp. The Nothing Records edition was released on June 21, 1999, featuring an identical track list to the Warp edition, including the hidden track. Plaid also announced the &quot;Booc&quot; EP in the late 1990s, but it suffered repeated delays, before finally surfacing on Warp in 2000. It was not picked up for US release by Nothing Records.

&quot;Rest-Proof Clockwork&quot; would be Plaid&#x27;s final release on Nothing Records, as Warp Records established their own US distribution in the early 2000s, via a deal with Caroline Distribution (which later expired), effectively ending all of Warp&#x27;s licensing to Nothing. Warp would later reissue all three of Plaid&#x27;s Nothing-released titles in the US. Plaid would go on to become known as one of Warp&#x27;s most critically acclaimed and tenured acts, earning a dedicated, worldwide fanbase within the electronic scene. Plaid went on to release several more albums, including &quot;Trainer&quot; (a compilation of early Plaid work, including the complete &quot;Mbuki Mvuki&quot; album), &quot;Double Figure&quot;, &quot;Spokes&quot;, &quot;Plaid Remixes (Parts in the Post)&quot; (a compilation of Plaid remixes), &quot;Greedy Baby&quot; (an audio-visual collaboration with Bob Jaroc), &quot;Scintilli&quot;, &quot;Reachy Prints&quot; and &quot;The Digging Remedy&quot;. Plaid also recorded soundtracks for the films &quot;Tekkonkinkreet&quot; (which included a Plaid remix album, &quot;Tekkonkinkreet Remix Tekkinkonkreet&quot;), &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot; and the interactive short film &quot;The Carp And The Seagull&quot;.

=== The Bowling Green ===
Micko Westmoreland was born in 1971 in Leeds, England and had an ear for music from a very young age, learning guitar, keyboards and bass. Throughout his youth, Westmoreland would dabble in traditional instrumentation, until 1990, when his decks and records were stolen. Using insurance money received as a result of the theft, Micko decided to purchase an Atari and synth and began his first experimentations in electronic music. While still developing his sound, during his time in college, Westmoreland collaborated with musician Brian Eno and a host of other young artists on the &quot;Self Storage&quot; exhibition at Wembley.

By the mid-1990s, Micko had honed his skills as an electronic producer and began recording as The Bowling Green; the name being derived from the venue on which the sport of bowls is played. The sound of The Bowling Green crossed many styles of electronica, incorporating a distinct sense of retro and nostalgia. Micko&#x27;s earliest music to reach public ears would be for his brother, Wash Westmoreland, who began as a gay porn director, though he would later transition into an acclaimed independent filmmaker. Micko provided the music to many of his brother&#x27;s gay porn films, often credited under the name The Bowling Green, including &quot;Naked Highway&quot;, &quot;Technical Exctasy&quot;, &quot;Animus&quot; and &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins: Gluttony&quot;.

The first track from The Bowling Green to see commercial release was on Rising High Records&#x27; &quot;Further Self Evident Truths&quot; compilation, with the track &quot;Imparticular&quot; included on &quot;Volume 3&quot; of the series (alongside future Nothing Records label-mate Plug). Around this time, Micko approached numerous labels and several responded with offers. Ultimately, he decided on Blue Planet Recordings, a sub-label of Silver Planet Recordings, on the basis that Blue Planet promised Micko some studio time. Micko recalled, &quot;So they lent me their studio and I used to go in there on Sundays and work for 23 hours and finish the mixes at about 8 in the morning, which is quite hellish really. The results of his studio time would be The Bowling Green&#x27;s debut &quot;Mingle EP&quot; 12&quot; in 1996. This was followed by the &quot;Chaise Longue EP&quot; in 1997, which featured a remix from Blue Planet and future Nothing Records label-mate Plug.

The music would catch the attention of Trent Reznor and Nothing Records, which had just licensed Luke Vibert&#x27;s Plug project from the Blue Planet label. Nothing Records offered to license The Bowling Green from Blue Planet and Micko joined the label in November 1997. The Bowling Green would release &quot;The Receptionist E.P.&quot; on Blue Planet in 1998, as well as appear on compilations for electronic labels Law &amp; Auder, Dot and Shadow Records. Micko also began working on a debut album, opting to record in a home studio, appropriately named The Spare Room, in Ladbroke Grove, West London. The resulting album, &quot;One Pound Note&quot;, was released in the UK on Blue Planet Recordings in June 1998. Shortly after the release, Micko appeared alongside Si Begg on the John Peel Sessions.

In October 1998, Micko gained further attention for an acting role in filmmaker Todd Haynes&#x27; glam rock drama &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;, starring alongside Ewan McGregor, Christian Bale, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Toni Collette and Eddie Izzard. Micko played the mysterious Jack Fairy, who was loosely inspired by musicians Brian Eno and Marc Bolan. The role came about by chance for Micko, as Todd Haynes had been taking residence in the home of Micko&#x27;s brother, Wash Westmoreland, while shooting his film &quot;Safe&quot;. Todd had met Micko though his brother and felt there would be a place for him somewhere in his new film, &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;. Initially auditioning for a minor part, Micko was instead cast in the pivotal role of Jack Fairy.

The first appearance of The Bowling Green on Nothing Records came with two tracks from &quot;One Pound Note&quot; being featured on the label sampler &quot;Nothing Changes&quot;, which was included with an issue of XLR8R Magazine in 1998. Nothing Records then released &quot;One Pound Note&quot; in the United States on January 19, 1999. The album contained numerous samples, including dialogue from the 1973 cult horror film, The Wicker Man. The album&#x27;s samples were left intact for the U.S. release, with the exception of the song &quot;Gentleman Reverse,&quot; which was cut from the U.S. edition, due to sample clearance issues.

The Bowling Green&#x27;s run on Nothing Records was limited to the release of &quot;One Pound Note&quot;, as the Blue Planet label went on hiatus shortly thereafter (before eventually going defunct altogether after a brief return from 2004 to 2005). This left The Bowling Green in need of a new UK label and subsequently ended their licensing deal to Nothing Records. In 2002, The Bowling Green signed with Spiky Records in the UK, which released his sophomore album, &quot;Fabrications&quot;. The album marked a shift in sound for Micko, with many tracks more focused on songwriting. In addition, Spiky released three 12-inch singles around the &quot;Fabrications&quot; album; &quot;Pre-Fabrications Vol. One&quot;, &quot;Pre-Fabrications Vol. Two&quot; and &quot;Tigons And Liger&quot;, featuring remixes from μ-ziq and Si Begg&#x27;s Buckfunk 3000 project.

After the release of &quot;Fabrications&quot;, Micko opted to no longer record as The Bowling Green. In 2001, he recorded music for his brother Wash Westmoreland&#x27;s film &quot;The Fluffer&quot;, as well as his 2006 film &quot;Quinceañera&quot;. The latter won both the Audience Award and the Grand Jury Prize at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival. In 2009, Micko Westmoreland released his first solo album under his own name, entitled &quot;Wax &amp; Wayne&quot;, on Terry Edwards&#x27; Sartorial Records. The album marked a significant change in sound for Westmoreland, leaving electronic music behind, in favor of a British indie rock sound. In 2010, however, Micko released an electronic project known as Wooden Spaceship in the U.S. on I, Absentee. The &quot;Wooden Spaceship&quot; material, which amounted to a one-off, self-titled EP, hearkened back to the electronic nostalgia and wonky beats of his electronic roots and represented a bridge between The Bowling Green and his later, eponymous solo material.

In 2015, Micko launched his own label, Landline Records, which released his sophomore album under his own name, entitled &quot;Yours Etc Abc&quot;. Micko also digitally reissued The Bowling Green albums &quot;One Pound Note&quot; and &quot;Fabrications&quot; on Landline Records in 2016. The same year, Micko digitally released a collection of both The Bowling Green and Micko Westmoreland remixes, simply titled &quot;Remixes&quot; and featuring tracks from the old The Bowling Green 12&quot;s, which included remixes by Luke Vibert, Mike Paradinas and Si Begg, amongst others. In 2017, Landline Records digitally reissued the &quot;Wooden Spaceship&quot; EP. Micko continues to use Landline Records as his primary musical outlet.

=== Nine Inch Nails (The Fragile era) ===
Five years after the highly successful release of &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, Nine Inch Nails delivered their third album, &quot;The Fragile&quot;, in 1999. In the time between albums, Reznor had busied himself with numerous other projects for Nothing, such as Marilyn Manson&#x27;s &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; album, the &quot;Lost Highway&quot; soundtrack and Rob Halford&#x27;s 2wo project. Prior to recording the album, longtime drummer Chris Vrenna would part ways from the band, going on to launch his own project, Tweaker. Bill Rieflin and Jerome Dillon would take over drumming duties for the album, with the latter becoming the full-time, replacement drummer for the band, until 2005. &quot;The Fragile&quot; was produced by Trent Reznor and Alan Moulder at Nothing Studios in New Orleans.

The project developed into a major undertaking, becoming a double album. Canadian rock producer Bob Ezrin was consulted on the album&#x27;s final track listing, in an effort to assemble the songs into a cohesive presentation. Unlike the gritty angst of &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, &quot;The Fragile&quot; relied more of melody, ambient noise and atmospheric soundscapes. Thematically, it is a concept album dealing with Reznor&#x27;s personal issues at that time, which included depression, anger and drug abuse.

This first single from the album, &quot;The Day the World Went Away&quot;, was released in North America on July 20, 1999. A music video was shot for the song, but went unreleased at the time (although parts eventually surfaced on 2002&#x27;s &quot;And All That Could Have Been&quot; DVD). A television commercial for the album then aired on the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards, with Nine Inch Nails also performing the album&#x27;s title song, &quot;The Fragile,&quot; live on the show. &quot;The Fragile&quot; was released on CD, vinyl and cassette on September 21, 1999 and debuted at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with sales of 228,000 units, making it the first Nine Inch Nails album to top the charts. Each edition of the album featured minor variations in the track listing. The vinyl edition, pressed on 3 LPs, featured two tracks not available on the CD version; &quot;10 Miles High&quot; and &quot;The New Flesh.&quot; The intros and outros of each sides are also different from the CD, particularly the song &quot;Ripe,&quot; which does not have the &quot;(with Decay)&quot; section. The cassette edition features an extended version of the song &quot;Please,&quot; entitled &quot;Please (+ Appendage).&quot;

&quot;We&#x27;re in This Together&quot; was released as a three part CD single in Europe on December 14, 1999. The discs featured the bonus tracks from the vinyl, a Porter Ricks remix and an extended mix of &quot;The Perfect Drug.&quot; A music video was also shot and released for the song. The third single from the album, &quot;Into the Void,&quot; was released on CD in Australia on May 9, 2000, featuring no exclusive content. Another music video was shot and released for the song.

The band embarked on a worldwide tour in support of the album, with the first leg, entitled &quot;Fragility 1.0,&quot; taking place in Europe, with Atari Teenage Riot performing as openers. Interscope Records reportedly refused to fund the promotional tour, following &quot;The Fragile&#x27;s&quot; lukewarm sales, which had dropped sharply after its first week of release. Reznor instead committed to fund the entire tour himself, which quickly sold out. He concluded that &quot;the reality is, I&#x27;m broke at the end of the tour&quot;, but also added, &quot;I will never present a show that isn&#x27;t fantastic.&quot; A television special, entitled &quot;Fragility 1.0,&quot; aired as a 30-minute special on MTV on December 21, 1999, showcasing the first leg of the tour.

The North American leg of the tour, entitled &quot;Fragility 2.0&quot; followed, with A Perfect Circle serving as guest openers. Rolling Stone magazine named Fragility the best tour of 2000. A music video was shot for &quot;Starfuckers, Inc.,&quot; with the song renamed &quot;Starsuckers, Inc.&quot; to accommodate mainstream airplay. The music video features Reznor mocking rock stars such as Courtney Love, Billy Corgan, Marilyn Manson and even Reznor himself. Reznor and Manson had been exchanging verbal barbs in the press during this time, so the video marked a brief reconciliation with the pair, with Manson appearing in and co-directing the video. Manson also made a surprise appearance at Nine Inch Nails&#x27; concert on May 9, 2000 at Madison Square Garden in New York City, performing with the band during &quot;Starfuckers, Inc.,&quot; followed by a performance of Manson&#x27;s &quot;The Beautiful People.&quot;

A remix album for &quot;The Fragile&quot;, entitled &quot;Things Falling Apart&quot;, was released on November 21, 2000. The album featured remixes from members of the band, as well as Adrian Sherwood, Dave Ogilvie and Telefon Tel Aviv. The release also includes a cover of the Gary Numan song &quot;Metal.&quot; Nine Inch Nails also released a new song, entitled &quot;Deep,&quot; on the soundtrack to the film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider in 2001. The band shot a music video to accompany the song, which did not feature any footage from the film.

Nine Inch Nails released their first live album, &quot;And All That Could Have Been&quot;, on CD, DVD and VHS on January 22, 2002. The CD included a bonus disc of softer renditions of older songs, as well as new material, entitled &quot;Still&quot;. Some tracks from &quot;Still&quot; evolved from rejected themes originally written for Mark Romanek&#x27;s 2002 film &quot;One Hour Photo&quot;. The DVD featured live footage shot on the &quot;Fragility 2.0&quot; leg of the tour. The DVD also featured a performance of &quot;The Day The World Went Away&quot; as a hidden, bonus feature, which was intercut with clips of the song&#x27;s unreleased music video. Marilyn Manson&#x27;s guest performance with Nine Inch Nails at Madison Square Garden was also included as a hidden feature.

&quot;The Fragile&quot; was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on January 4, 2000, denoting shipments of two million copies in the United States. The album received a mostly favorable critical reception and has gone on to be considered a favorite amongst fans of the band. In 2017, Nine Inch Nails released a vinyl reissue of the album, as well as &quot;The Fragile: Deviations 1&quot;; a 4-LP set assembled by Reznor and Atticus Ross, featuring instrumentals and alternate takes, alongside numerous rare and unreleased tracks from the era.

At the conclusion of &quot;The Fragile&quot; era, Trent admitted himself into rehab and began to sober up, putting Nine Inch Nails on hiatus. It was during this time of recovery that Reznor would begin looking into the finances of Nine Inch Nails, which would lead to a lawsuit against his then-manager and Nothing Records president, John Malm, Jr. Their falling out would become one of the major catalysts in the eventual demise of the label.

== 2000–03: Later years ==
Following a peak period of activity over the course of the late 1990s, the output of Nothing Records began to slow after 2000. Many of the smaller artists were experiencing trouble with the label, due to increasing corporate interference, as a result of numerous corporate mergers. Since its inception, Nothing Records operated as a division of Interscope Records. While Nothing artists had experienced some issues with Interscope, it wasn&#x27;t until Seagram&#x27;s came into the fold that the corporate interference began to cripple the label from operating under its original vision. Interscope was owned by Universal, which in turn was owned by Seagram&#x27;s. Seagrams acquired Polygram and merged it with Universal, after which Vivendi acquired Seagrams. The new corporate leadership came in looking to cut costs, giving the edict to cut many smaller artists, which affected many labels, including Nothing Records. Bands like Einstürzende Neubauten, Prick and 12 Rounds found their material being declined for release. Many acts would part ways from the label during this time. Warp Records would also establish their own US distribution through Caroline Distribution, resulting in all of their Nothing Records licensed acts departing from the label. Meanwhile during this period, Trent Reznor admitted himself into rehab and focused much of his energy into getting himself healthy. Only one new act arrived on the label during this tumultuous period; The The. Their experiences would lead to a very public departure from the label, serving as example of the greater problems plaguing not only Nothing Records, but the greater music industry as a whole. Their album, &quot;NakedSelf&quot;, served as something of a death knell for the label, after which only Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson would continue bearing the label&#x27;s name on their releases.

=== The The ===
Prior to arriving at Nothing Records, The The was an established, commercial success, with many critically acclaimed, hit albums, such as &quot;Infected&quot;, &quot;Mind Bomb&quot; and &quot;Dusk&quot; over the course of the 1980s and early 1990s. The The is an English rock band, fronted by singer/songwriter Matt Johnson, who has served as the only constant member of the band since its formation. After having spent the majority of their career on Epic Records, the band found themselves at creative odds with their label over the recording of The The&#x27;s 1997 album &quot;Gun Sluts&quot;. The songs were more experimental in nature and Epic requested that Johnson revise the album to add more radio-friendly content, to which Johnson refused. Johnson also delivered a second studio album, entitled &quot;NakedSelf&quot;, to the label. &quot;They didn&#x27;t like that either. They asked me if I could make it more commercial and I was outraged. I said &#x27;forget it,&#x27;&quot; Johnson recalled. With both sides at an impasse, Johnson decided it was time to part ways with Epic. After a year of legal wrangling, the band was finally freed from their deal with Epic / Sony. In spite of their creative differences, Johnson stated, &quot;The split from them was amicable, it wasn&#x27;t acrimonious. I had a very positive relationship with Epic at that time, but they became really, really pop oriented and I was thoroughly marginalized.&quot;

For the first time in eighteen years, The The were free agents, in search of a new label. Nothing Records president John A. Malm, Jr. was a huge fan of The The and became eager to sign them to Nothing Records. Trent Reznor too had been a big fan of the band, stating &quot;Matt Johnson&#x27;s music was one of the main reasons I began working on Nine Inch Nails. The passion, the honesty and the nakedness of his work opened doors of possibilities in my head.&quot; A contract offer from Nothing was accepted by the band in 1999, with Johnson initially very optimistic about the ideology of label and their partnership, commenting at the time, &quot;The music industry is increasing corporatization, homogenization and general awfulness. It was a simple decision for me to choose Nothing Records, I feel we share many of the same beliefs and passions and already it feels like a natural home to me. I&#x27;m feeling galvanized and extremely excited about the next few years.&quot;

Although the band already had &quot;Gun Sluts&quot; completed, they opted to leave it unreleased, which is how it remains to this day. Instead Johnson decided to focus on &quot;NakedSelf&quot; for Nothing Records. &quot;NakedSelf&quot; did, however, feature one track, &quot;DesielBreeze,&quot; from the unreleased &quot;Gun Sluts&quot; album. Overall, the album was a mature, contemplative piece, released on February 29, 2000 on Nothing Records to wide critical acclaim. A deluxe CD version was also released, featuring an expanded booklet of photography. Instead of a traditional music video to promote the album, the band filmed a trailer for the album. The &quot;NakedSelf&quot; trailer featured several excerpts from album set to video footage, as well as interview clips with Matt Johnson. The trailer appeared on The The&#x27;s website and was released as a promotional piece to press and music video outlets. However, it quietly vanished from circulation in subsequent years and has become sought-after by collectors.

&quot;NakedSelf&quot; was led by the single &quot;ShrunkenMan&quot;. However, instead of featuring remixes, Johnson recruited other musicians to record cover versions of the song, including Foetus, John Parish and DAAU. The resulting single was titled &quot;Interpretations: Issue 1 - ShrunkenMan&quot;. The single was released on April 10, 2000, exclusively in the UK, with no American release. The title referenced future planned volumes for other singles from the album, which would follow the same cover song format, but their struggles with the label would ultimately result in the series ending at just a single volume. The band also embarked on their &quot;World Tour of Tiny Spaces&quot; in support of the album; a fourteen-month trek that would span the globe. While on tour, the band pressed self-released a single for &quot;Gun Sluts&quot;, which was a one-track single featuring the eponymous song from the unreleased album. The CD single was initially available exclusively on tour, then later through the band&#x27;s website.

It was during the promotional stage of the album that Matt Johnson began to feel a heightened frustration with the lack of support from Nothing Records. Johnson recalled, &quot;In Detroit, I got a call from an NPR station. They said they&#x27;d been begging the label for copies of the album and they wouldn&#x27;t give them one. NPR had to beg and phone and beg and eventually got one. Then the NPR affiliate had to send someone to drive forty minutes to pick me up and take me to the station to do the interview, because the record label wouldn&#x27;t do it. I&#x27;ve never known anything like it.&quot; With a great deal of personal, professional and emotional investment in &quot;NakedSelf&quot;, Johnson began to feel deep unhappiness toward his partnership with Nothing Records and the emerging, corporate conglomerate controlling them, which consisted of Interscope Records, Universal Music Distribution, Seagram&#x27;s and Vivendi Entertainment. While many of the other acts on the label opted to quietly depart, or fight their battles in private, Johnson elected to make his battle very public, publishing an essay on his website called &quot;The The Vs. The Corporate Monster.&quot; The essay detailed Johnson&#x27;s extreme dissatisfaction over his experiences with the label, although his targets were primarily Seagrams and the larger music corporations as a whole. Johnson wrote in the essay:

In order to get the green light for the Universal/PolyGram merger, Seagrams promised their shareholders a return on cuts, not profits. They have a huge artist stable raped from three established major labels and two thirds has got to go, bringing it down to a trim, wealthy machine made up of just the plump ripe sellers. Millions of sales are now required to cover the increasing overheads at these labels. Overheads increased through ludicrous executive bonus payouts, inflated expense accounts and the quest for the Porsche. The artist is put to work harder and faster, in order to feed the machine. VivendiUniversalSonyAOLTimeEmiWarnerBMG, all represent a basket of share dividends to holders who are quick to move on when the coming gets tough. After a 7 year lay off, I recently released &quot;NakedSelf&quot;, an album that is generally considered one of the best of my career to some of the best reviews I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ve also been on tour since November 1999 selling out shows by word of mouth across Europe and America to fantastic audience response. Yet the reaction from Interscope/Universal has been destructive and negative in the extreme. Their utter dependence on the radio means that the good ship The The is abandoned as soon as the fear of no-play takes hold. They can think of no alternative and why should they when they can swiftly move on to the next act on the plank (step forward Beck, whoops! step forward Nine Inch Nails..oh dear, No Doubt..Ouch! Chris Cornell. ... ?) One act after another has fallen into the ocean. Being signed to the Universal conglomerate has been like being trapped on a cruise on the Mary Celeste. The lights are on but nobody&#x27;s home.

Johnson also took the time to credit select individuals within these corporations, who were overpowered by the merges, stating &quot;There are many decent, hard working people in this company who wanted to work in the music business for all the right reasons, but now find their hands are tied behind their backs as they are not allowed to get behind the projects they really believe in.&quot;

Along with the essay, Johnson made a bold move at the time, by opting to give away &quot;NakedSelf&quot; for free on The The&#x27;s website, on a track by track, weekly basis. He stated:

As Universal/Interscope seem either incapable or unwilling (or both) to distribute and promote my album properly, and as they&#x27;ve refused to give it back to me, then I&#x27;ve been forced to consider alternative ways of reaching my audience. After much deliberation I have therefore decided to offer free downloads of &quot;NakedSelf&quot; on a song by song/week by week basis from my official site. www.thethe.com. By doing so I hope more people (including the bulk of my audience) will finally get the chance to hear this album and hopefully support me by purchasing this CD and future releases. For me to just walk away from &quot;NakedSelf&quot; now would be like leaving a baby on a doorstep and I just can&#x27;t do it. I believe in this album too much.

In the wake of the essay, the relationship between The The and Interscope/Universal became very publicly toxic. Plans for a second single for &quot;TheWhisperers,&quot; made it as far as a promo single pressing. Plans were in the works for a follow-up &quot;Interpertations: Issue 2 - TheWhisperers&quot;, but these plans were scrapped. The The then parted ways with Nothing Records.

In 2002, after their departure from Nothing Records, The The returned to their former label, Epic, with whom Johnson still had an amicable relationship, to revisit the band&#x27;s back catalogue. The band released a best-of collection, entitled &quot;45 RPM: The Singles of The The&quot;, which included two new songs, &quot;Pillar Box Red&quot; and &quot;Deep Down Truth.&quot; The band also released the &quot;London Town 1983 - 1993&quot; box set, which was composed of remastered reissues of their albums &quot;Soul Mining&quot;, &quot;Infected&quot;, &quot;Mind Bomb&quot; and &quot;Dusk&quot;, as well as an exclusive fifth disc, featuring a soundtrack piece called &quot;In The AM.&quot; The reissued albums were all also released individually, featuring new cover artwork.

In June 2002, The The played the Meltdown Festival in at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Music Hall as guests of David Bowie. The performance consisted of Matt Johnson and J. G. Thirlwell performing tapes and loops before video projections. Also available at the show was an exclusive double CD, entitled &quot;Film Music&quot;. The first disc, called &quot;Silent Tongue&quot;, consisted of unreleased film music, while the second disc was the &quot;45 RPM&quot; collection. It was never made available again after the show and remains one of the most sought-after releases amongst fans. The performance also remains The The&#x27;s final show to date, although Johnson has announced a series of new The The shows for 2018; their first in 16 years.

After 2002, Johnson entered a long-term, self-imposed exile from the music industry, with only sparse releases of the band, all self-released through Johnson&#x27;s Lazarus label. In 2007, the band released a single for a new song, entitled &quot;Mrs Mac&quot;, an autobiographical song about Johnson&#x27;s first day at school as a child. In 2010, they released a CD soundtrack to the film &quot;Tony&quot;, which was directed by Matt Johnson&#x27;s brother, &quot;Gerard Johnson&quot;. In 2012, they released a soundtrack to the film &quot;Moonbug&quot;, directed by Nichola Bruce. In 2015, the band released another soundtrack to the film &quot;Hyena&quot;, also directed by Johnson&#x27;s brother Gerard. In 2017, the film &quot;The Inertia Variations&quot;, directed by Johanna St. Michaels began playing the film festival circuit. The documentary chronicles the band&#x27;s career. To celebrate the release of the film, the band released a new 7-inch single, &quot;We Can&#x27;t Stop What&#x27;s Coming&quot; for Record Store Day in 2017, collaborating once again with Johnny Marr.

Johnson has become known as a reclusive artist, staying far removed from the public eye for most of the time since &quot;NakedSelf&quot;. However, he has sporadically released 15-minute broadcasts during his sabbatical, called Radio Cinéola, available for download from the band&#x27;s website. The Radio Cinéola broadcasts have featured quite a number of rare and unreleased The The songs, including several from the band&#x27;s era with Nothing Records. Episode 6 of the show, entitled &quot;Blue Moon in June,&quot; featured the song &quot;Justice 4 Jesus,&quot; which is from yet another unreleased album from the band, entitled &quot;Karmic Gravity&quot;. Originally announced under the name of &quot;Two Blocks Below Canal&quot;, the album was later re-titled &quot;Karmic Gravity&quot;. Alongside &quot;Gun Sluts&quot; and &quot;NakedSelf&quot;, it comprises The The&#x27;s &quot;New York Trilogy&quot; of albums, all of which were recorded while Johnson was living in New York. Of the three, to date, only &quot;NakedSelf&quot; has been released. The same, sixth episode of Radio Cinéola also featured a previously unreleased song from &quot;Gun Sluts&quot;, entitled &quot;Psychic Sauna,&quot; as well as an unreleased &quot;GlobalEyes (Alternate Version)&quot; from &quot;NakedSelf&quot;. Episode 11, entitled &quot;Remember, Remember,&quot; features the song &quot;Body Bonfire,&quot; an unreleased instrumental from &quot;NakedSelf&quot;, while episode 12, entitled &quot;Blow, Blow Thou Winter Wind,&quot; features &quot;Phantom Walls (Live with Eric Schermerhorn),&quot; an unreleased live version of the song from &quot;NakedSelf&quot;. Episode 14, entitled &quot;Deep Space&quot;, also features &quot;Shrunken Man (Lunar Version),&quot; an alternate version of the track from &quot;NakedSelf&quot;.

Rumors have persisted for years of a new studio album being in the works, but to date, nothing has been officially announced. However, in the wake of the success of the &quot;We Can&#x27;t Stop What&#x27;s Coming&quot; single, The The announced a series of live shows for 2018, which sold out immediately. They also announced a box set, &quot;Radio Cineola Trilogy: A Broadcast by The The&quot;, featuring three albums. The first, &quot;The End of the Day&quot;, features songs, interpretations and performances. The second album, &quot;The Inertia Variations&quot;, features poetry, soundscapes and spoken word. The third album, &quot;Midnight to Midnight&quot;, features electronic scores, political commentary and broadcasts. The flurry of activity in 2017 and 2018 marks a decided shift for the band, once again stepping forward into the public eye, after nearly two decades of self-imposed seclusion from the mainstream.

The The&#x27;s departure from Nothing, in particular, seemed to mirror the greater problems dogging Nothing Records in their later years, as their roster became increasingly depleted and their reputation shifted into being known for corporate red tape and artistic futility, rather than the artistic freedom it was founded upon, signifying the beginning of the end for the label. It was fitting then that The The would become the final band to ever sign with the label.

== 2004–07: End of the label ==
=== Coil ===

Coil holds a unique place in history of Nothing Records, being one of the first acts to sign to the label, as well as remaining one of the final acts at the end of the label, all the while having released no material during their entire tenure on the roster. John Balance and Peter &quot;Sleazy&quot; Christopherson founded Coil in 1982 in London, England, after collaborating on a few side projects and following their departure from Psychic TV. Other collaborators, such as Drew McDowall and Danny Hyde, would frequently record with the band, some becoming members for a time. By the time Coil arrived at Nothing Records, they had released three studio albums. &quot;Scatology&quot; and &quot;Horse Rotorvator&quot; were released on Force &amp; Form, which was manufactured and distributed by K.422, a sister label of Some Bizzare Records. &quot;Love&#x27;s Secret Domain&quot; was released on Torso in Europe and the seminal Wax Trax! Records in the United States. These albums has helped establish Coil as one of the premiere acts in experimental and industrial, prior to joining Nothing Records.

Following the success of &quot;Love&#x27;s Secret Domain&quot;, Coil began work on a new studio album in 1992, entitled &quot;Backwards.&quot; In 1993, a tape believed to have been a studio demo intended for the Boudisque/Torso labels was leaked as a bootleg cassette. In 1994, however, Boudisque went bankrupt and Torso shut down operations, leaving the Backwards material without a home. The cassette demo&#x27;s tracklist consisted of eight songs; &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Blade,&quot; &quot;Wir-Click-Wir,&quot; &quot;Elves,&quot; &quot;Simenon,&quot; &quot;In My Blood,&quot; &quot;Spastiche,&quot; &quot;Crumb Time&quot; and &quot;March of Time.&quot;

Trent Reznor had been a longtime admirer of Coil, stating their &quot;&#x27;Tainted Love&#x27; video remains one of the greatest music videos of all time. I was always more attracted to Coil than Throbbing Gristle; the darkness and the scatology really chimed with me. If it&#x27;s not immediately obvious: &quot;Horse Rotorvator&quot; was deeply influential on me. What they did to your senses. What they could do with sound. What Jhonn was doing lyrically. The exotic darkness of them permeated their work.&quot;

In addition to his work in Coil, Peter Christopherson was an established music video and commercial director, having worked with artists such as Rage Against the Machine, Filter, Robert Plant, future Nothing Records label-mates The The and many more. It would be through his directing work that Reznor would first reach out to Christopherson, seeking to hire him as director for Nine Inch Nails&#x27; &quot;Broken film&quot;. Reznor recalled, &quot;I figured that if I hired (Sleazy) as a director, then I could at least meet him and hang out for a bit. We established a friendship, and that friendship was very valuable to me. Making the &quot;Broken&quot; movie was a lot of fun. There was no label involvement or pressure from anyone, it was just he and I talking.

Christopherson accepted Reznor&#x27;s offer and went off to film material for the &quot;Broken&quot; movie, which he felt was so realistic, he informed Reznor, &quot;I&#x27;m going to send it to you, but it&#x27;s going to show up in a paper bag unmarked because there could be ... I&#x27;m not sure I want the authorities knowing this came from me.&quot; After reviewing the film, Reznor stated, &quot;It felt like we&#x27;d crossed over into territory that was perhaps too far. And to be honest, at that point I was living in the Sharon Tate house recording &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;. Anyway, that&#x27;s where I was living when this package turned up, and I thought, &#x27;Enough. I don&#x27;t know that I need this kind of thing.&#x27; With the house it felt too stunty, and Peter agreed.&quot;

In spite of opting to leave the &quot;Broken&quot; movie unreleased, it began to surface as a bootleg, eventually making its way onto the Internet. &quot;We shelved it, but little did we know that the Internet would come into existence, and it would find its home on there,&quot; stated Reznor. In addition to the &quot;Broken&quot; movie, Christpherson directed music videos for the Nine Inch Nails songs &quot;Wish&quot; and &quot;Gave Up.&quot;

Amidst these visual collaborations, Reznor also invited Coil to sign with Nothing Records. They are believed to be one of the earliest artists to have joined the label, signing a multi-album deal. Prior to their arrival at Nothing, Coil already had several ties to other acts on the label. Meat Beat Manifesto had remixed Coil&#x27;s song &quot;The Snow,&quot; calling their remix &quot;Answers Come In Dreams.&quot; The band would revive this title for their 2010 album of the same name. Peter Christopherson had previously directed several music video for Nothing Records act The The, for their songs &quot;Infected,&quot; &quot;Heartland&quot; and &quot;The Mercy Beat.&quot; Autechre widely praised Coil as one of their primary musical influences, and even planned musical collaborations together at one point.

In 1992, Trent Reznor also invited Coil to remix the Nine Inch Nails song &quot;Gave Up&quot; for their &quot;Fixed&quot; EP and their collaborations would continue with the release of &quot;The Downward Spiral.&quot; Christopherson would direct the music video for &quot;March of the Pigs&quot; and also received a director&#x27;s credit for the Nine Inch Nails&#x27; home video &quot;Closure&quot;. Coil would also do remixes for the Nine Inch Nails releases &quot;Closer to God&quot; (alongside fellow Nothing Records label-mates Meat Beat Manifesto) and &quot;Further Down the Spiral&quot;. An alternate version of their &quot;Closer (Precursor)&quot; remix by Danny Hyde was used in the opening credits to the 1995 David Fincher film &quot;Seven&quot;.

In 1995, Coil began work on their first release for Nothing Records, which they decided would be the &quot;Backwards&quot; album. With the Torso demo material already completed, the band decided to head into Reznor&#x27;s Nothing Studios in New Orleans to re-record the material, as well as write new music. Recording at Nothing Studios began in June 1995 and was completed by January of 1997. Trent Reznor did not perform, produce or write any material for it. John Balance recalled, &quot;We produced it ourselves, with Danny Hyde as engineer and with excellent help, complete co-operation and enormous investment of time, energy and genuine enthusiasm from all the people at Hot Snakes studio (a.k.a. Nothing Studios). In particular Chris Vrenna, who helped us iron out technical stuff, Brian the studio manager, who kept it running smoothly, and of course Trent himself, who kept out of our way while letting us loose in his secret domain.&quot;

During this time, Reznor would once again invite Coil to do a remix for the Nine Inch Nails song &quot;The Perfect Drug.&quot; This time, however, Coil declined to participate, citing lack of time, due to the recording of &quot;Backwards.&quot;. In spite of this, Peter Christpherson did assist on two Trent Reznor songs; &quot;Videodrones; Questions&quot; and &quot;Driver Down,&quot; for the soundtrack to David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Lost Highway&quot;, also released on Nothing Records. Reznor had lobbied for Coil to take on a greater role in composing music for Lynch&#x27;s films, but Lynch declined. John Balance recalled, &quot;You know, with &quot;Lost Highway&quot;, Trent literally forced (us) down David Lynch&#x27;s throat, saying &#x27;Look, please put this Coil stuff on.&#x27; You know, he really did help to get us on that soundtrack, but he (Lynch) wasn&#x27;t interested. He wanted David Bowie, he wanted Marilyn Manson, he wanted whomever he could get. He just said, &#x27;These people are really big. I want this film to be really big.&#x27; He didn&#x27;t give a fuck about the integrity.&quot;

Initially abandoning the title of &quot;Backwards,&quot; the band announced the album would be called &quot;International Dark Skies&quot;. However, after NBC announced a TV series named &quot;Dark Skies&quot;, the band abandoned the name. For a time, they began calling the album &quot;God Please Fuck My Mind for Good&quot;, then &quot;Fire of the Mind&quot; and &quot;The World Ended a Long Time Ago&quot;, before later returning to the name &quot;International Dark Skies&quot;, with Balance commenting, &quot;I&#x27;m not letting a bad TV program change my vision of the world.&quot; However, the band eventually would circle back to referring to the material simply as &quot;Backwards&quot;.

In addition to the &quot;Backwards&quot; album, a companion remix album was also once in the plans for release on Nothing Records. John Balance commented, &quot;We are planning to involve a whole bunch of people in remixing tracks from our new Nothing album, including Steven Stapleton of Nurse with Wound, Autechre, Charlie Clouser and others we haven&#x27;t asked yet, so it would be unfair to speculate on.&quot;. In addition, Nothing also planned to re-issue the first two Coil albums, &quot;Scatology&quot; and &quot;Horse Rotorvator&quot;. However, the rights to these albums became caught up in a dispute between Coil and their former label, Some Bizzare Records. John Balance recalled in 1999, &quot;We have no news over Nothing releasing &quot;Horse Rotorvator&quot; and &quot;Scatology&quot;, because we gave them it about 5 years ago and had it legally able to be released in the U.S., but Nothing&#x27;s lawyers were unhappy with a slightly less than watertight legal situation, so didn&#x27;t go ahead.&quot; Balance would go on to claim that Some Bizzare label owner Stephen &quot;Stevo&quot; Pearce initially agreed to the Nothing re-issues, before later demanding more money, stating, &quot;Since that, that fucking arsehole Stevo Pearce has reared his very unpleasant head again and asked Nothing for more money and generally thrown a spanner in the works. He originally gave Coil permission to give it to Nothing as part of a half-hearted attempt to be nice to us and make some amends, including financial, for the terrible way he has continued to treat us over the fate of these two records. Actaually he wasn&#x27;t trying to be nice, he was trying to cover his ass for some early crap he tried to pull off.&quot;

In 1997, Some Bizzare reissued both albums in the UK, against the wishes of the band. Coil released a message to fans urging them not to support these reissues, claiming they were unauthorized, due to the fact that Some Bizzare had not settled with them on unpaid royalties for the albums. John Balance even went as far as cursing the reissues. In response to the Some Bizzare reissues, Coil remastered and reissued both albums themselves, on their own Threshold House label. The covers to both albums featured a message to Some Bizzare label owner &quot;Stevo&quot; Pearce, stating &quot;Stevo, pay us what you owe us!&quot;

Coil provided intermit updates on &quot;Backwards&quot; over the course of 1997, stating that the album was held up for countless reasons. Meanwhile, the band remained prolific, recording numerous new releases, including &quot;Moons Milk (In Four Phases)&quot;, &quot;Musick To Play In The Dark Vol. 1&quot; and &quot;Musick To Play In The Dark Vol. 2&quot;. Over the following years, while &quot;Backwards&quot; never saw a release, the band would occasionally comment on the album and Nothing Records, always insisting they were still a part of the label. &quot;For the record it is us, Coil, who are delaying over this particular title. Not Trent or Nothing, who have been very, very quiet about it all and have waited patiently for it,&quot; they wrote in 1999.

In 1999, Coil began performing live for the first time. On June 18, 2001, the entire 1993 &quot;Backwards&quot; demo was broadcast on Dutch radio station Radio 4, when they hosted Coil as in-studio guests to coincide with a live performance on June 1, 2001. A four disc CD-R set of the entire broadcast was released in an unknown quantity as &quot;Dutch Radio4 Supplement&quot;. The &quot;Backwards&quot; demos became widely circulated on the Internet. Three extra tracks, &quot;Bee Has the Photos,&quot; &quot;Egyptian Basses,&quot; and a different version of &quot;Spastiche&quot; became circulated with the demos online over time.

In 2004, after a legal dispute arose between Trent Reznor and Nothing Records president John Malm Jr., Reznor officially declared the label defunct, with no Coil albums having ever seen release on the label. That same year, John Balance would tragically die in a fall inside of his own home. Peter Christopherson announced that Coil would not continue as a band. However, he would focus on the band&#x27;s back-catalogue, which including revisiting the Nothing Records material.

In 2005, Coil announced the release of &quot;The Ape of Naples&quot; on their own Threshold House label. The album was considered to be the final version of their once-intended Nothing Records material, featuring updated versions of five tracks recorded at Nothing Studios; &quot;Fire of the Mind,&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s In My Blood,&quot; &quot;I Don&#x27;t Get It,&quot; &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Blade,&quot; &quot;Cold Cell&quot; and &quot;Amber Rain.&quot; It also featured other songs that are believed to have been originally created around the time of &quot;Backwards&quot;. The band also included a thank you to Trent Reznor and Nothing Records in the liner notes. In 2007, Important Records reissued &quot;The Ape Of Naples&quot; on LP, alongside a companion album of material, called &quot;The New Backwards&quot;. &quot;The New Backwards&quot; was later made available separately as a CD in 2008. The album featured additional material from the Nothing album sessions, remixed by Peter Christopherson and Danny Hyde in 2007.

Peter Christopherson passed away in his sleep on November 25, 2010. Just prior to his death, Christopherson gave permission to Trent Reznor to use the name How To Destroy Angels for his new band he was launching. The name was derived from Coil&#x27;s first 12&quot; single. Trent Reznor even stated that prior to his death, Christopherson claimed to be working on music to contribute to How To Destroy Angels, commenting &quot;Around that time I reached out to him, iPads had just come out and I sent him one (with the music on it), because he was in Thailand and away from technology. I just wanted to make sure that he was ok with it, because clearly I wouldn&#x27;t have done it without his blessing. He mentioned, &#x27;Hey, I&#x27;ve got some stuff that I&#x27;m working on which could be interesting (for How To Destroy Angels)... it could be interesting, but it could also be way outside the realms of anything that you&#x27;d be interested in. We could work together, and maybe under the umbrella of How To Destroy Angels.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Please do. Send whatever you have.&#x27; And nothing ever showed up - he passed away not long after that. So sadly I didn&#x27;t get to hear what he had planned.&quot;

In 2012, members of the Nine Inch Nails fan-site echoingthesound.org were able to raise funds to send to Danny Hyde, who had revealed the existence of outtakes of commissioned work Coil had produced for various Nine Inch Nails singles and EPs. Once a suitable amount had been raised, Hyde torrented the tracks to fans via The Pirate Bay. Danny Hyde later licensed the songs to British label Cold Spring. On February 24, 2014, Cold Spring released the remixes under the name &quot;Recoiled&quot; on 12&quot;. The album artwork was created by a member of EchoingTheSound and closely resembles Russell Mills&#x27; frayed rope design for &quot;Further Down the Spiral&quot;. The songs were released and marketed as &quot;Coil &amp; Nine Inch Nails,&quot; despite the fact that Trent Reznor is the sole writer on all tracks and remains uncredited in all editions of the release.

On October 9, 2015, Cold Spring released Coil&#x27;s original &quot;Backwards&quot; album, which was once again arranged through Danny Hyde. This marked the first time the Nothing Records material had been released as was originally intended for the label, with no further remixing or additional songs. No mention of Nothing Records is given on the album, with the liner notes swapping out a Nothing Studios credit with &quot;Magazine Studios, New Orleans&quot; (Magazine Street being the former location of Nothing Studios). In November of that same year, Danny Hyde himself also published the album for download on his website, offering six additional bonus tracks, primarily consisting of alternate versions of the album songs; &quot;Spactiche,&quot; &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Blade - 98 Jams,&quot; &quot;Wur Click - 98 Lo Chords,&quot; &quot;Mellotron Song,&quot; &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Blade - 96 Vox Version&quot; and &quot;Wur Click - 98 Tk3 Vox Bits.&quot; Hyde also included a digital insert on his website for the download version, featuring his own liner notes, which give special thanks to Trent Reznor and former Nine Inch Nails member Chris &quot;Pod&quot; Vrenna, for their inspiration and tech.

Despite having never released anything on Nothing Records, the band remains widely associated with the label. The vast catalogue of Coil remains highly sought-after by collectors and fans, while their music has gone on to influence countless musicians, such as Alec Empire, Chris Connelly, Autechre, K.K. Null and Nine Inch Nails. Coil&#x27;s unfulfilled multi-album deal with Nothing Records can be loosely retraced through comments from the band throughout their tenure on the label. &quot;Scatology&quot;, &quot;Horse Rotorvator&quot;, &quot;Backwards&quot; and an incomplete &quot;Backwards&quot; remix album were all intended for release on Nothing at various points. To date, all of the material has seen release outside of Nothing Records, with the exception of the unfinished remix project for &quot;Backwards&quot;.

== Nothing Studios ==
Nothing Studios was a recording studio located within an early-1900s building at 4500 Magazine Street in Uptown New Orleans that had formerly housed a funeral home. Reznor established the studio in April 1995. Marilyn Manson recorded &quot;Smells Like Children&quot; (1995) and &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; (1996) at the studio, and Nine Inch Nails recorded &quot;The Fragile&quot; (1999) and portions of &quot;And All That Could Have Been&quot; (2002) there. The studio, which had a 72-input Solid State Logic SL 4000G Plus mixing console and two Studer A800 multitrack tape recorders, expanded for commercial business in early 2000.

In 2004 during an interview on KROQ-FM&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast with Kevin and Bean&quot; show, Reznor stated that the New Orleans recording studio was no longer a studio. The following year, he documented the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina on his former recording studio and the surrounding area by posting a collection of photos on nin.com, after which his band played a scheduled concert (which had become a benefit for the survivors). The property changed ownership in 2011 and was remodeled into a retail space.

The front door of Nothing Studios was the front door of the Tate mansion where the Manson family murders took place. Reznor, who had leased the house and knew the owner was planning on demolishing it, requested and received the door after moving out in December 1993, and subsequently installed the door at Nothing Studios&#x27; entrance. Reznor left the door at the New Orleans recording studio when he relocated back to Los Angeles, and after the building changed ownership in 2011 and was remodeled, The door was in the possession of Christopher Moore, a New Orleans artist who acquired it from the owner of Nothing Studios, and was sold to an undisclosed buyer for $127,000 by Julien’s Auctions in September 2023.

==2023 sex abuse lawsuit==
A lawsuit filed in January 2023 accused Nothing Records of being aware of alleged sex abuse committed by Marilyn Manson.

<doc id="153067" wikidata="Q1070654" url="?curid=153067" title="Royal assent">
<text>Royal assent is the method by which a monarch formally approves an act of the legislature, either directly or through an official acting on the monarch&#x27;s behalf. In some jurisdictions, royal assent is equivalent to promulgation, while in others that is a separate step. Under a modern constitutional monarchy, royal assent is considered little more than a formality. Even in nations such as the United Kingdom, Norway, the Netherlands, Liechtenstein and Monaco which still, in theory, permit their monarch to withhold assent to laws, the monarch almost never does so, except in a dire political emergency or on advice of government. While the power to veto by withholding royal assent was once exercised often by European monarchs, such an occurrence has been very rare since the eighteenth century.

Royal assent is typically associated with elaborate ceremony. In the United Kingdom the Sovereign may appear personally in the House of Lords or may appoint Lords Commissioners, who announce that royal assent has been granted at a ceremony held at the Palace of Westminster for this purpose. However, royal assent is usually granted less ceremonially by letters patent. In other nations, such as Australia, the governor-general (as the Monarch&#x27;s representative) has the right to dissolve the parliament and to sign a bill. In Canada, the governor general may give assent either in person at a ceremony in the Senate or by a written declaration notifying Parliament of their agreement to the bill.

==Usage==
The monarch would today not veto a bill, except on ministerial advice. Robert Blackburn suggested the monarch&#x27;s granting of royal assent is now limited to due process and is a certification that a bill has passed all established parliamentary procedures, whereas Rodney Brazier argued that a monarch can still refuse royal assent to a bill that &quot;sought to subvert the democratic basis of the constitution&quot;. However, Brazier went on to admit doing such a thing would lead to &quot;grave difficulties of definition&quot; and it would be better if the monarch sought a different method of expressing their concern. The only situation in which royal assent could be denied would be if a bill had been passed by the legislative houses or house against the wishes of the cabinet and the royal assent stage offered the latter with a last-ditch opportunity to prevent the bill from becoming law.

===United Kingdom===
Before the Royal Assent by Commission Act 1541 (33 Hen. 8. c. 21) allowed for delegation of the power to Lords Commissioners, assent was always required to be given by the sovereign in person before Parliament. The last time it was given by the sovereign in person in Parliament was during the reign of Queen Victoria at a prorogation on 12 August 1854. The act was repealed and replaced by the Royal Assent Act 1967. However section 1(2) of that act does not prevent the sovereign from declaring assent in person if he or she so desires.

Royal assent is the final step required for a parliamentary bill to become law. Once a bill is presented to the Sovereign, he or she has the following formal options:
* grant royal assent, thereby making the bill an act of Parliament.
* delay the bill&#x27;s assent through the use of reserve powers, thereby invoking a veto
* refuse royal assent on the advice of his or her ministers.

The last bill that was refused assent was the Scottish Militia Bill during Queen Anne&#x27;s reign in 1708.

Erskine May&#x27;s &quot;Parliamentary Practice&quot; advises &quot;...and from that sanction they cannot be legally withheld&quot;, meaning that bills must be sent for royal assent, not that it must be given. However, some authorities have stated that the sovereign no longer has the power to withhold assent from a bill &quot;against&quot; the advice of ministers.

Under modern constitutional conventions, the sovereign generally acts on, and in accordance with, the advice of his or her ministers. However, there is some disagreement among scholars as to whether the monarch should withhold royal assent to a bill if advised to do so by his or her ministers.

Since these ministers most often enjoy the support of Parliament and obtain the passage of bills, it is unlikely that they would advise the sovereign to withhold assent. Hence, in modern practice, the issue has never arisen, and royal assent has not been withheld. This possibility did arise during the early days of the premiership of Boris Johnson while the UK was negotiating a Brexit agreement with the EU. The Speaker of the House of Commons had allowed debate on a bill against the government&#x27;s wishes, and the government of the day was effectively in a minority on the most pressing parliamentary issue at the time. As such, there were rumours that the prime minister might advise the then-sovereign, Elizabeth II, to withhold assent on an unfavourable bill.

====Historical development====
Originally, legislative power was exercised by the sovereign acting on the advice of the &quot;Curia regis&quot;, or Royal Council, in which senior magnates and clerics participated and which evolved into Parliament. In 1265, the Earl of Leicester irregularly called a full parliament without royal authorisation. Membership of the so-called Model Parliament, established in 1295 under Edward I, eventually came to be divided into two branches: bishops, abbots, earls, and barons formed the House of Lords, while the two knights from each shire and two burgesses from each borough led the House of Commons. The King would seek the advice and consent of both houses before making any law.

During Henry VI&#x27;s reign, it became regular practice for the two houses to originate legislation in the form of bills, which would not become law unless the sovereign&#x27;s assent was obtained, as the Sovereign was, and still remains, the enactor of laws. Hence, all acts include the clause &quot;Be it enacted by the King&#x27;s (Queen&#x27;s) most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows...&quot;. The Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 provide a second potential preamble if the House of Lords were to be excluded from the process.

The power of Parliament to pass bills was often thwarted by monarchs. Charles I dissolved Parliament in 1629, after it passed motions and bills critical of—and seeking to restrict—his arbitrary exercise of power. During the eleven years of personal rule that followed, Charles performed legally dubious actions such as raising taxes without Parliament&#x27;s approval.

The form of the Coronation Oath taken by monarchs up to and including James I and Charles I included a promise (in Latin) to uphold the rightful laws and customs &quot;quas vulgus elegerit&quot;. There was a controversy over the meaning of this phrase: the verb &quot;elegerit&quot; is ambiguous, representing either the future perfect (&quot;which the common people &quot;shall&quot; have chosen&quot;), or perfect subjunctive (&quot;which the common people &quot;may&quot; have chosen&quot;). Charles I, adopting the latter interpretation, considered himself committed only to uphold those laws and customs that &quot;already existed&quot; at the time of his coronation. The Long Parliament preferred the former translation, interpreting the oath as an undertaking to assent to any law passed by Parliament, as the representative of the &quot;common people&quot;. The restoration Convention Parliament resolved the issue by removing the disputed phrase from the Oath.

After the Civil War, it was accepted that Parliament should be summoned to meet regularly, but it was still commonplace for monarchs to refuse royal assent to bills. The Sedition Act 1661 even made it a treasonable offence to suggest that Parliament had &quot;a legislative power without the king&quot;. In 1678, Charles II withheld royal assent from a bill &quot;for preserving the Peace of the Kingdom by raising the Militia, and continuing them in Duty for Two and Forty Days,&quot; suggesting that he, not Parliament, should control the militia. William III made comparatively liberal use of the royal veto, withholding assent from five public bills between 1692 and 1696. These were:

* The Judges Bill (vetoed 1692) would have regulated the fees charged by judges, and removed the right of the monarch to dismiss judges at will, stipulating that a judge should hold his commission &quot;on good behaviour&quot;. One contemporary observer reported that William&#x27;s veto was recommended by the judges themselves, concerned that the regulation of their fees would deprive them of a lucrative source of income.
* The Royal Mines Bill (vetoed 1692) would have clearly defined the monarch&#x27;s right to seize any mine containing gold or silver. A similar bill was again passed by Parliament and given royal assent in the following year.
* The Triennial Bill (vetoed 1693) would have ensured Parliament would meet annually, and that no parliament could last longer than three years. A similar law, without the requirement for annual parliamentary sessions, was approved by the king in 1694 and became law.
* The Place Bill (vetoed 1694) would have prevented members of Parliament from accepting any office or employment under the Crown without standing for re-election. A similar provision was later approved by William as part of the Act of Settlement 1701.
* The Qualifications Bill (vetoed 1696) would have established property qualifications for members of Parliament.

Carafano suggests that William III considered the royal veto &quot;his personal legislative tool&quot;. By contrast, the last Stuart monarch, Queen Anne, withheld her assent from a bill just once. On 11 March 1708, she vetoed the Scottish Militia Bill on the advice of her ministers. No monarch has since withheld royal assent from a bill passed by Parliament.

During the rule of the succeeding Hanoverian dynasty, power was gradually exercised more by Parliament and the government. The first Hanoverian monarch, George I, became heir presumptive and then king late in life. Speaking English as a second language and being at first unfamiliar with British politics and customs, he relied on his ministers to a greater extent than had previous monarchs. Later Hanoverian monarchs attempted to restore royal control over legislation: George III and George IV both openly opposed Catholic Emancipation and asserted that to grant assent to a Catholic emancipation bill would violate the Coronation Oath, which required the sovereign to preserve and protect the established Church of England from papal domination, and would grant rights to individuals who were in league with a foreign power which did not recognise their legitimacy. However, George IV reluctantly granted his assent upon the advice of his ministers. Thus, as the concept of ministerial responsibility has evolved, the power to withhold royal assent has fallen into disuse, both in the United Kingdom and in the other Commonwealth realms.

In 1914, George V took legal advice on withholding royal assent from the Government of Ireland Bill; then highly contentious legislation that the Liberal government intended to push through Parliament by means of the Parliament Act 1911. He decided not to withhold assent without &quot;convincing evidence that it would avert a national disaster, or at least have a tranquillising effect on the distracting conditions of the time&quot;.

It has been mooted that, in modern times, the government could advise the monarch to withhold royal assent, but that elected politicians should strive to avoid such a scenario.

=====Scotland=====

Royal assent is the final stage in the legislative process for Acts of the Scottish Parliament. The process is governed by sections 28, 32, 33, and 35 of the Scotland Act 1998. After a bill has been passed, the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament submits it to the monarch for royal assent after a four-week period, during which the Advocate General for Scotland, the Lord Advocate, the Attorney General or the Secretary of State for Scotland may refer the bill to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (prior to 1 October 2009, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council) for review of its legality. Royal assent is signified by letters patent under the Great Seal of Scotland as set out in the Scottish Parliament (Letters Patent and Proclamations) Order 1999 (SI 1999/737) and of which notice is published in the London, Edinburgh, and Belfast Gazettes.

The authority of the Secretary of State for Scotland to prohibit the submission of a bill passed by the Scottish Parliament for royal assent was first used in January 2023 for the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill.

=====Wales=====

Measures, which were the means by which the National Assembly for Wales passed legislation between 2006 and 2011, were assented to by Queen Elizabeth II by means of an Order in Council. Section 102 of the Government of Wales Act 2006 required the Clerk to the Assembly to present measures passed by the assembly after a four-week period during which the Counsel General for Wales or the Attorney General could refer the proposed measure to the Supreme Court for a decision as to whether the measure was within the assembly&#x27;s legislative competence. Following the referendum held in March 2011, in which the majority voted for the assembly&#x27;s law-making powers to be extended, measures were replaced by Acts of the Assembly.

=====Northern Ireland=====

Under section 14 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, a bill which has been approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly is presented to the monarch by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland for royal assent after a four-week waiting period during which the Attorney General for Northern Ireland may refer the bill to the Supreme Court. Assent is given by means of letters patent in the following form set out in the (SI 1999/664).

Between 1922 and 1972, bills passed by the Parliament of Northern Ireland were passed to the Governor of Northern Ireland for royal assent under the Government of Ireland Act 1920, replacing the office of Lord Lieutenant.

=====Jersey and Guernsey=====
The Lieutenant Governors of the Bailiwick of Jersey and of the Bailiwick and Islands of Guernsey do not have the authority to grant assent, nor, as proxies, as the British Crown&#x27;s representative, deliver assent, to legislation emanating from the respective legislatures of these islands. The States of Jersey Law 2005 abolishes the power of the 
Lieutenant Governor to directly impose a formal veto to a resolution of the States of Jersey.

The equivalent of the royal assent is formally granted or formally refused on the formal advice of the Committee of Council for the Affairs of Jersey and Guernsey in pursuance of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Order-in-Council of 22 February 1952. A recent example when the equivalent of royal assent was refused was in 2007, concerning reforms to the constitution of the Chief Pleas of Sark. (A revised version of the proposed reforms was subsequently given the equivalent of royal assent.)

=====Isle of Man=====
Special procedures apply to legislation passed by the Tynwald of the Isle of Man. Before the Lordship of the Island was purchased by the British Crown in 1765 (the Revestment), the assent of the Lord of Mann to a bill was signified by letter to the Governor. After 1765, the equivalent of royal assent was at first signified by the letter from the Secretary of State to the Governor; but, during the British Regency, the practice began of granting the equivalent of royal assent to Manx legislation by Orders in Council, which continues to this day, though limited to exceptional cases since 1981. That year the delegated to the Lieutenant Governor the power to grant royal assent to bills passed by Tynwald. The Lieutenant Governor must, however, refer any bill impacting on reserved powers (defence, foreign relations, nationality law, the relationship between the Island and the United Kingdom and any matters relating to the Monarch) to the British government for advice, on which he is required to act.

Since 1993, the Sodor and Man diocesan synod of the Church of England within the Province of York has had power to enact measures making provision &quot;with respect to any matter concerning the Church of England in the Island&quot;. If approved by Tynwald, a measure &quot;shall have the force and effect of an Act of Tynwald upon the Royal Assent thereto being announced to the Tynwald&quot;. Between the passing of the Church (Application of General Synod Measures) Act 1979 and 1993, the diocesan synod had similar powers, but limited to the extension to the Isle of Man of measures of the General Synod. Before 1994, the equivalent of royal assent was granted by Order in Council, as for a bill, but the power to grant the equivalent of royal assent to measures has now been delegated to the Lieutenant Governor by the Sodor and Man Diocesan Synod Measures Order 1994. A Measure does not require &quot;promulgation&quot;.

====Relationship to royal consent====
King&#x27;s Consent and Prince&#x27;s Consent are distinct from royal assent. They are required only for bills affecting the royal prerogative and the personal property and &quot;personal interests&quot; of the monarch, and are granted before parliament has debated or voted to pass a bill. They are internal parliamentary rules of procedure that could, in principle, be dispensed with by Parliament. Consent is always granted on the advice of the government; the monarch never takes the decision to withhold consent.

===Other Commonwealth realms===
In Commonwealth realms other than the UK, royal assent is granted or withheld either by the realm&#x27;s sovereign or, more frequently, by the representative of the sovereign, the governor-general. In Australia and Canada, which are federations, assent in each state or province is granted or withheld by the relevant governor or lieutenant governor, respectively.

In Australia, in the special case of a bill proposing to amend the constitution, the bill is submitted to the electorate in a referendum and must receive majority support before receiving royal assent. All other bills passed normally by the Parliament become acts of Parliament once they have received royal assent.

In Solomon Islands and Tuvalu, royal assent may not be refused and constitutional provisions require it to be granted in a timely manner. In Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, the governor-general may not withhold assent if a bill has fulfilled all constitutional requirements. In Papua New Guinea, no royal assent is required for the passage of bills and legislation instead becomes effective on the certification of the speaker of the national parliament.

====Canada====
For Canada, the lieutenant governors may defer assent to the governor general, who may defer assent to federal bills to the sovereign. If the governor general is unable to give assent, it can be done by a deputy, specifically a justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. Through Canadian history, royal assent has been withheld by a lieutenant governor approximately 90 times, the last occurring in Saskatchewan in 1961. 

It is not actually necessary for the governor general to sign a bill passed by a legislature, the signature being merely an attestation. In each case, the parliament must be apprised of the granting of assent before the bill is considered to have become law. Two methods are available: the sovereign&#x27;s representatives may grant assent in the presence of both houses of parliament. Alternatively, each house may be notified separately, usually by the speaker of that house. Both houses must be notified on the same day. Notice to the House of Commons while it is not in session may be given by way of publishing a special issue of the &quot;Journals of the House of Commons&quot;. The Senate must be sitting and the governor general&#x27;s letter read aloud by the speaker.

==Development==
While royal assent has not been withheld for a bill backed by the government in the United Kingdom since 1708, it has often been withheld in British colonies and former colonies by governors acting on royal instructions. In the United States Declaration of Independence, colonists complained that George III &quot;has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good [and] has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.&quot;

Since the Balfour Declaration of 1926 and the Statute of Westminster 1931, all the Commonwealth realms have been sovereign kingdoms, the monarch and governors-general acting solely on the advice of the local ministers, who generally maintain the support of the legislature and are the ones who secure the passage of bills. They, therefore, are unlikely to advise the sovereign, or his or her representative, to withhold assent. The power to withhold the royal assent was exercised by Alberta&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor, John C. Bowen, in 1937, in respect of three bills passed in the legislature dominated by William Aberhart&#x27;s Social Credit party. Two bills sought to put banks under the authority of the province, thereby interfering with the federal government&#x27;s powers. The third, the &quot;Accurate News and Information Bill&quot;, purported to force newspapers to print government rebuttals to stories to which the provincial cabinet objected. The unconstitutionality of all three bills was later confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada and by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

In Australia, technical issues arose with the royal assent in both 1976 and 2001. In 1976, a bill originating in the House of Representatives was mistakenly submitted to the governor-general and assented to. However, it was later discovered that it had not been passed by the Senate. The error arose because two bills of the same title had originated from the House. The governor-general revoked the first assent, before assenting to the bill which had actually passed the Senate and the House. The same procedure was followed to correct a similar error that arose in 2001.

==Ceremony==

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, a bill is presented for royal assent after it has passed all the required stages in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, the House of Commons may, under certain circumstances, direct that a bill be presented for assent despite lack of passage by the House of Lords.

A list of all bills that have thus passed Parliament is drawn up by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery; this list is then approved by the Clerk of the Parliaments. (The Prime Minister, other ministers, and Privy Counsellors do not normally have any involvement in drawing up the list.) The Clerk of the Crown then prepares letters patent listing all the relevant bills, which are then signed by the monarch.

Officially, assent is granted by the sovereign or by Lords Commissioners authorised to act by letters patent. Royal assent may be granted in parliament or outside parliament; in the latter case, each house must be separately notified before the bill takes effect.

The Clerk of the Parliaments, the chief official of the House of Lords, traditionally pronounces a formula in Anglo-Norman Law French, indicating the sovereign&#x27;s decision. The granting of royal assent to a supply bill is indicated with the words &quot;&quot;, translated as &quot;The King thanks his good subjects, accepts their bounty, and so wills it.&quot; For other public or private bills, the formula is simply &quot;&quot; (&quot;the King wills it&quot;). For personal bills, the phrase is &quot;&quot; (&quot;let it be done as it is desired&quot;). The appropriate formula for withholding assent is the euphemistic &quot;&quot; (&quot;the King will consider it&quot;).

When the sovereign is female, is replaced by .

Before the reign of Henry VIII, the sovereign always granted his or her assent in person. The sovereign, wearing the Crown, would be seated on the throne in the Lords chamber, surrounded by heralds and members of the royal court—a scene that nowadays is repeated only at the annual State Opening of Parliament. The Commons, led by their Speaker, would listen from the Bar of the Lords, just outside the chamber. The Clerk of the Parliaments presented the bills awaiting assent to the monarch, save that supply bills were traditionally brought up by the Speaker. The Clerk of the Crown, standing on the sovereign&#x27;s right, then read aloud the titles of the bills (in earlier times, the entire text of the bills). The Clerk of the Parliaments, standing on the sovereign&#x27;s left, responded by stating the appropriate Norman French formula.

A new device for granting assent was created during the reign of King Henry VIII. In 1542, Henry sought to execute his fifth wife, Catherine Howard, whom he accused of committing adultery; the execution was to be authorised not after a trial but by a bill of attainder, to which he would have to personally assent after listening to the entire text. Henry decided that &quot;the repetition of so grievous a Story and the recital of so infamous a crime&quot; in his presence &quot;might reopen a Wound already closing in the Royal Bosom&quot;. Therefore, Parliament inserted a clause into the Act of Attainder, providing that assent granted by Commissioners &quot;is and ever was and ever shall be, as good&quot; as assent granted by the sovereign personally. The procedure was used only five times during the 16th century, but more often during the 17th and 18th centuries, especially when George III&#x27;s health began to deteriorate. Queen Victoria became the last monarch to personally grant assent in 1854.

When granting assent by commission, the sovereign authorises three or more (normally five) lords who are privy counsellors to declare assent in his or her name. The Lords Commissioners, as the monarch&#x27;s representatives are known, wear scarlet parliamentary robes and sit on a bench between the throne and the Woolsack. The Lords Reading Clerk reads the commission aloud; the senior commissioner then states, &quot;My Lords, in obedience to His Majesty&#x27;s Commands, and by virtue of the Commission which has been now read, We do declare and notify to you, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in Parliament assembled, that His Majesty has given His Royal Assent to the several Acts in the Commission mentioned.&quot;

During the 1960s, the ceremony of assenting by commission was discontinued and is now only employed once a year, at the end of the annual parliamentary session. In 1960, the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod arrived to summon the House of Commons during a heated debate and several members protested against the disruption by refusing to attend the ceremony. The debacle was repeated in 1965; this time, when the Speaker left the chair to go to the House of Lords, some members continued to make speeches. As a result, the Royal Assent Act 1967 was passed, creating an additional form for the granting of royal assent. As the attorney-general explained, &quot;there has been a good deal of resentment not only at the loss of Parliamentary time that has been involved but at the breaking of the thread of a possibly eloquent speech and the disruption of a debate that may be caused.&quot;

Under the Royal Assent Act 1967, royal assent can be granted by the sovereign in writing, by means of letters patent, that are presented to the presiding officer of each house of Parliament. Then, the presiding officer makes a formal, but simple statement to the house, acquainting each house that royal assent has been granted to the acts mentioned. Thus, unlike the granting of royal assent by the monarch in person or by royal commissioners, the method created by the Royal Assent Act 1967 does not require both houses to meet jointly for the purpose of receiving the notice of royal assent. The standard text of the letters patent is set out in the Crown Office (Forms and Proclamations Rules) Order 1992 (SI 1992/1730), with minor amendments in 2000. In practice this remains the standard method, a fact that is belied by the wording of the letters patent for the appointment of the Royal Commissioners and by the wording of the letters patent for the granting of royal assent in writing under the 1967 Act (&quot;... And forasmuch as We cannot at this time be present in the Higher House of Our said Parliament being the accustomed place for giving Our Royal Assent...&quot;).

Independently of the method used to signify royal assent, it is the responsibility of the Clerk of the Parliaments, once the assent has been duly notified to both houses, not only to endorse the act in the name of the monarch with the formal Norman French formula, but to certify that assent has been granted. The Clerk signs one authentic copy of the bill and inserts the date (in English) on which the assent was notified to the two houses after the title of the act.

=== Australia and New Zealand ===
In Australia, the formal ceremony of granting assent in parliament has not been regularly used since the early 20th century. Today, the bill is sent to the governor&#x27;s or the governor-general&#x27;s residence by the house in which it originated. The governor-general then signs the bill, and notifies the president of the Senate and the speaker of the House of Representatives, who notify their respective houses of the governor-general&#x27;s action. A similar practice is followed in New Zealand, where the governor-general has not granted the royal assent in person in parliament since 1875.

===Canada===
In Canada, the traditional ceremony for granting assent in Parliament was regularly used until the 21st century, long after it had been discontinued in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms. One result, conceived as part of a string of acts intended to demonstrate Canada&#x27;s status as an independent realm, was that King George VI personally assented to nine bills of the Canadian Parliament during his tour of Canada in 1939—85 years after his great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, had last granted royal assent personally in the United Kingdom. Under the Royal Assent Act, 2002, the alternative practice of granting assent in writing, with each house being notified separately, was brought into force. The speaker of the Senate or a representative reads to the senators the letters from the governor general regarding the written declaration of royal assent. As the act provides, royal assent is to be signified—by the governor general or by a deputy, usually a Justice of the Supreme Court.

The royal assent ceremony takes place in the Senate, as the sovereign is traditionally barred from the House of Commons. On the day of the event, the speaker of the Senate will read to the chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive. The Senate thereafter cannot adjourn until after the ceremony. The speaker moves to sit beside the throne. The mace bearer, with mace in hand, stands adjacent to him or her, and the governor general enters to take the speaker&#x27;s chair.

The usher of the Black Rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the members of Parliament, who follow black rod back to the Senate, the sergeant-at-arms carrying the mace of the House of Commons. In the Senate, those from the Commons stand behind the bar, while black rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general, who then nods his or her head to signify royal assent to the presented bills (which do not include supply bills). Once the list of bills is complete, the clerk of the Senate states: &quot;in his [or her] majesty&#x27;s name, his [or her] excellency the governor general [or the deputy] doth assent to these bills.&quot;

If there are any supply bills to receive royal assent, the speaker of the House of Commons will read their titles and the Senate clerk repeats them to the governor general, who nods his or her head to communicate royal assent. When these bills have all been assented to, the clerk of the Senate recites &quot;in his [or her] majesty&#x27;s name, his [or her] excellency the governor general [or the deputy] thanks his [or her] loyal subjects, accepts their benevolence, and assents to these bills.&quot; The governor general or his or her deputy then depart Parliament.

==Other countries==
In some monarchies—such as Belgium, Denmark, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Thailand—promulgation is required as well as royal assent. In Sweden, however, the monarch was removed from the process in 1975; instead, the government (i.e. the cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister) officially promulgates laws. In both cases, however, the process of assent and promulgation is usually a formality, whether by constitutional convention or by an explicit provision of the constitution.

===Belgium===
In Article 109 of the constitution: &quot;The King &quot;sanctions&quot; and &quot;promulgates&quot; laws&quot;. In Belgium, the royal assent is called &quot;sanction royale&quot; / &quot;koninklijke bekrachtiging&quot; (Royal Sanction), and is granted by the King signing the proposed statute (and a minister countersigning it). The Belgian constitution requires a theoretically possible refusal of royal sanction to be countersigned—as any other act of the monarch—by a minister responsible before the House of Representatives. The monarch promulgates the law, meaning that he or she formally orders that the law be officially published and executed. In 1990, when King Baudouin advised his cabinet he could not, in conscience, sign a bill decriminalising abortion (a refusal patently not covered by a responsible minister), the Council of Ministers, at the King&#x27;s own request, declared Baudouin incapable of exercising his powers. In accordance with the Belgian constitution, upon the declaration of the Sovereign&#x27;s incapacity, the Council of Ministers assumed the powers of the head of state until parliament could rule on the King&#x27;s incapacity and appoint a regent. The bill was then assented to by all members of the Council of Ministers &quot;on behalf of the Belgian People&quot;. In a joint meeting, both houses of parliament declared the King capable of exercising his powers again the next day.

===Japan===
Articles 6 and 7 of the Constitution of Japan mention the decisions of the parliament that require the approval of the Emperor. These are some of the so-called , and according to Article 3 of the Constitution, acts of state require the advice and approval of the Cabinet, which is the responsibility of the Cabinet.

===Jordan===
The constitution of Jordan grants its monarch the right to withhold assent to laws passed by its parliament. Article 93 of that document gives the Jordanian Sovereign six months to sign or veto any legislation sent to him from the National Assembly. If he vetoes it within that timeframe, the assembly may override his veto by a two-thirds vote of both houses. Otherwise, the law does not go into effect, but it may be reconsidered in the next session of the assembly. If the monarch fails to act within six months of the bill being presented to him, it becomes law without his signature.

===Luxembourg===
While Article 34 of the constitution of Luxembourg formerly required the grand duke or duchess to &quot;sanction&quot; and &quot;promulgate&quot; a new law for it to take effect, the required sanction was removed in 2008, after Grand Duke Henri informed his prime minister that he could not in good conscience assent to a bill to permit euthanasia in the country. The subsequent constitutional amendment removed the need for assent while retaining the need for the Grand Duke to promulgate new laws. The Grand-Duke&#x27;s signature is still required, but does not imply assent, only promulgation (announcement that the law has been enacted by Parliament). The Grand-Duke did sign the Euthanasia Act under this new constitutional arrangement.

=== Malaysia ===
Article 66(3) of the Federal Constitution of Malaysia provides that after a bill was passed by both Houses of Parliament, it shall be presented to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King of Malaysia) for his assent before being gazetted in order to become law. However, since 1983, if a bill does not received royal assent within 30 days after it was presented to the King, the bill will automatically become law as per Article 66(4A) of the Constitution. Likewise, since 1994, if a Ruler of a Malaysian states does not grant his assent to a bill passed by the state Legislature within the 30 days period, the bill will automatically become law. As of 2016, the only federal law that failed to receive royal assent but still become law as per Article 66(4A) is the National Security Council Act 2016.

===Norway===
Articles 77–79 of the Norwegian constitution specifically grant the monarch of Norway the right to withhold royal assent from any bill passed by the Storting. Should the monarch ever choose to exercise this privilege, Article 79 provides a means by which his veto may be over-ridden: &quot;If a Bill has been passed unaltered by two sessions of the Storting, constituted after two separate successive elections and separated from each other by at least two intervening sessions of the Storting, without a divergent Bill having been passed by any Storting in the period between the first and last adoption, and it is then submitted to the King with a petition that His Majesty shall not refuse his assent to a Bill which, after the most mature deliberation, the Storting considers to be beneficial, it shall become law even if the Royal Assent is not accorded before the Storting goes into recess.&quot;

===Spain===
In Part II of the 1978 Spanish constitution, among provisions concerning the Crown, Article 62(a) invests the &quot;sanction&quot; (i.e. royal assent) and &quot;promulgation&quot; of laws with the monarch of Spain. Chapter 2 of Part III, concerning the Drafting of Bills, outlines the method by which bills are passed. According to Article 91, the monarch shall give his or her assent and promulgate the new law within fifteen days of passage of a bill by the Cortes Generales. Article 92 invests the monarch with the right to call for a referendum, on the advice of the president of the government (commonly referred to in English as the prime minister) and the authorisation of the cortes.

No constitutional provision allows the monarch to directly veto legislation; however, neither does the constitution prohibit the Sovereign from withholding royal assent. When the Spanish media asked King Juan Carlos I if he would endorse the bill legalising same-sex marriages, he answered: &quot;Soy el Rey de España y no el de Bélgica&quot; (&quot;I am the King of Spain and not that of Belgium&quot;)—a reference to King Baudouin of Belgium, who had refused to sign the Belgian law legalising abortion. The King gave royal assent to Law 13/2005 on 1 July 2005; the law was gazetted in the on 2 July and came into effect on 3 July 2005.

===Tonga===
Articles 41 and 68 of the constitution empower the King to withhold royal assent from bills adopted by the Legislative Assembly. In 2010, the kingdom moved towards greater democracy, with King George Tupou V saying that he would be guided by his prime minister in the exercising of his powers. Nonetheless, this does not preclude an independent royal decision to exercise a right of veto. In November 2011, the assembly adopted an Arms and Ammunitions (Amendment) Bill, which reduced the possible criminal sentences for the illicit possession of firearms. The bill was adopted by ten votes to eight. Two members of the assembly had recently been charged with the illicit possession of firearms. The Prime Minister, Lord Tuʻivakanō, voted in favour of the amendment. Members of the opposition denounced the bill and asked the King to veto it, which he did in December.

<doc id="153068" wikidata="Q15726790" url="?curid=153068" title="Ambassadors of the United States">
<text>Ambassadors of the United States are persons nominated by the president to serve as the United States&#x27; diplomatic representatives to foreign nations, international organizations, and as ambassadors-at-large. Under Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution, their appointment must be confirmed by the United States Senate; while an ambassador may be appointed during a recess, they can serve only until the end of the next session of Congress, unless subsequently confirmed.

Ambassadors are the highest-ranking diplomats of the U.S. and are usually based at the embassy in the host country. They are under the jurisdiction of the Department of State and answer directly to the secretary of state; however, ambassadors serve &quot;at the pleasure of the President&quot;, meaning they can be dismissed at any time. Appointments change regularly for various reasons, such as reassignment or retirement.

An ambassador may be a career Foreign Service officer (career diplomatCD) or a political appointee (PA). In most cases, career foreign service officers serve a tour of approximately three years per ambassadorship, whereas political appointees customarily tender their resignations upon the inauguration of a new president.

The State Department publishes a monthly list of ambassadors. A listing by country of past chiefs of mission is maintained by the Office of the Historian of the U.S. Department of State, along with the names and appointment dates of past and present ambassadors-at-large and mission to international organizations.

==Current U.S. ambassadors==
Note that the information in this list is subject to change due to regular personnel changes resulting from retirements and reassignments. The State Department posts updated lists of ambassadors approximately monthly, accessible via an interactive menu-based website.
==Ambassadors to international organizations==

===Ambassadors to the United Nations===
Current ambassadors from the United States to the United Nations:
===Other international organizations===
Current ambassadors from the United States to other international organizations:
==Ambassadors-at-large==
Current ambassadors-at-large from the United States with worldwide responsibility:

==Other officials with the rank of ambassador==
Officials who were granted the rank of ambassador in their senate confirmations:

===Office of the United States Trade Representative===
===U.S. State Department===
==Other chiefs of mission==
Senior diplomatic representatives of the United States hosted in posts other than embassies. Unlike other consulates, these persons report directly to the Secretary of State.
==Special envoys, representatives, and coordinators==
These diplomatic officials report directly to the Secretary of State. Many oversee a portfolio not restricted to one nation, often an overall goal, and are not usually subject to Senate confirmation. Unlike the State Department offices and diplomats listed in other sections of this Article, the offices and special envoys/representatives/coordinators listed in this Section are created and staffed by direction of top Federal Executive administratorsprimarily U.S. Presidents and Secretaries of Statewhose political or organizational management philosophies may not be shared by their successors. As such, many of these positions may go unfilled upon assumption of office by successor Presidential Administrations, with their offices sometimes merged with or subsumed into other offices, or abolished altogether.
==Nations without exchange of ambassadors==
*Bhutan: According to the U.S. State Department, &quot;The United States and the Kingdom of Bhutan have not established formal diplomatic relations; however, the two governments have informal and cordial relations.&quot; Informal contact with the nation of Bhutan is maintained through the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi.
*Iran: On April 7, 1980, the United States broke diplomatic relations with Iran after the 1979 Iranian revolution. On April 24, 1981, the Swiss government assumed representation of U.S. interests in Tehran, and Algeria assumed representation of Iranian interests in the United States. Currently, Iranian interests in the United States are represented by the government of Pakistan. The U.S. Department of State named Iran a &quot;State Sponsor of Terrorism&quot; on January 19, 1984.
*North Korea: The Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea is not on friendly terms with the United States, and while talks between the two countries are ongoing, there is no exchange of ambassadors. Sweden functions as Protective Power for the United States in Pyongyang and performs limited consular responsibilities for U.S. citizens in North Korea.
*Syria: On February 6, 2012, the United States suspended operations at its embassy in Damascus. On May 5, 2014, the United States recognized the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces as the foreign mission of Syria.
*Taiwan: With the normalization of relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1979, the United States has not maintained official diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Relations between Taiwan and the United States are maintained through an unofficial instrumentality, the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office, with headquarters in Taipei and field offices in Washington, D.C., and twelve other U.S. cities. The Taipei Office of the American Institute in Taiwan, a non-profit, public corporation, functions as a &quot;de facto&quot; embassy, performing most consular functions and staffed by Foreign Service officers who are formally &quot;on leave&quot;.

==Notable past ambassadors==
Many well-known individuals have served the United States as ambassadors, or in formerly analogous positions such as envoy, including several who also became President of the United States (indicated in boldface below). Some notable ambassadors have included:



==Ambassadors killed in office==

<text>Randolph Denard Ornette Coleman (March 9, 1930 – June 11, 2015) was an American jazz saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist, and composer. He is best known as a principal founder of the free jazz genre, a term derived from his 1960 album &quot;Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation&quot;. His pioneering works often abandoned the harmony-based composition, tonality, chord changes, and fixed rhythm found in earlier jazz idioms. Instead, Coleman emphasized an experimental approach to improvisation rooted in ensemble playing and blues phrasing. Thom Jurek of AllMusic called him &quot;one of the most beloved and polarizing figures in jazz history,&quot; noting that while &quot;now celebrated as a fearless innovator and a genius, he was initially regarded by peers and critics as rebellious, disruptive, and even a fraud.&quot;

Born and raised in Fort Worth, Texas, Coleman taught himself to play the saxophone when he was a teenager. He began his musical career playing in local R&amp;B and bebop groups, and eventually formed his own group in Los Angeles, featuring members such as Ed Blackwell, Don Cherry, Charlie Haden, and Billy Higgins. In November 1959, his quartet began a controversial residency at the Five Spot jazz club in New York City and he released the influential album &quot;The Shape of Jazz to Come&quot;, his debut LP on Atlantic Records. Coleman&#x27;s subsequent Atlantic releases in the early 1960s would profoundly influence the direction of jazz in that decade, and his compositions &quot;Lonely Woman&quot; and &quot;Broadway Blues&quot; became genre standards that are cited as important early works in free jazz.

In the mid 1960s, Coleman left Atlantic for labels such as Blue Note and Columbia Records, and began performing with his young son Denardo Coleman on drums. He explored symphonic compositions with his 1972 album &quot;Skies of America&quot;, featuring the London Symphony Orchestra. In the mid-1970s, he formed the group Prime Time and explored electric jazz-funk and his concept of harmolodic music. In 1995, Coleman and his son Denardo founded the Harmolodic record label. His 2006 album &quot;Sound Grammar&quot; received the Pulitzer Prize for Music, making Coleman the second jazz musician ever to receive the honor.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Coleman was born Randolph Denard Ornette Coleman on March 9, 1930, in Fort Worth, Texas, where he was raised. He attended I.M. Terrell High School in Fort Worth, where he participated in band until he was dismissed for improvising during John Philip Sousa&#x27;s march &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. He began performing R&amp;B and bebop on tenor saxophone, and formed The Jam Jivers with Prince Lasha and Charles Moffett.

Eager to leave town, he accepted a job in 1949 with a Silas Green from New Orleans traveling show and then with touring rhythm and blues shows. After a show in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, he was assaulted and his saxophone was destroyed.

Coleman subsequently switched to alto saxophone, first playing it in New Orleans after the Baton Rouge incident; the alto would remain his primary instrument for the rest of his life. He then joined the band of Pee Wee Crayton and traveled with them to Los Angeles. He worked at various jobs in Los Angeles, including as an elevator operator, while pursuing his music career.

Coleman found like-minded musicians in Los Angeles, such as Ed Blackwell, Bobby Bradford, Don Cherry, Charlie Haden, Billy Higgins, and Charles Moffett. Thanks to the intercession of friends and a successful audition, Ornette signed his first recording contract with LA-based Contemporary Records, which allowed him to sell the tracks from his debut album, &quot;Something Else!!!!&quot; (1958), with Cherry, Higgins, Walter Norris, and Don Payne. During the same year he briefly belonged to a quintet led by Paul Bley that performed at a club in New York City (that band is recorded on &quot;Live at the Hilcrest Club 1958&quot;). By the time &quot;Tomorrow Is the Question!&quot; was recorded soon after with Cherry, bassists Percy Heath and Red Mitchell, and drummer Shelly Manne, the jazz world had been shaken up by Coleman&#x27;s alien music. Some jazz musicians called him a fraud, while conductor Leonard Bernstein praised him.

=== 1959: &quot;The Shape of Jazz to Come&quot; ===
In 1959, Atlantic Records released Coleman&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;The Shape of Jazz to Come&quot;. According to music critic Steve Huey, the album &quot;was a watershed event in the genesis of avant-garde jazz, profoundly steering its future course and throwing down a gauntlet that some still haven&#x27;t come to grips with.&quot; &quot;Jazzwise&quot; listed it at number three on their list of the 100 best jazz albums of all time in 2017.

Coleman&#x27;s quartet received a long and sometimes controversial engagement at the Five Spot Café in Manhattan. Leonard Bernstein, Lionel Hampton, and the Modern Jazz Quartet were impressed and offered encouragement. Hampton asked to perform with the quartet; Bernstein helped Haden obtain a composition grant from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. A young Lou Reed followed Coleman&#x27;s quartet around New York City. Miles Davis said that Coleman was &quot;all screwed up inside&quot;, although he later became a proponent of Coleman&#x27;s innovations; Dizzy Gillespie remarked of Coleman that “I don’t know what he’s playing, but it’s not jazz.&quot;

Coleman&#x27;s early sound was due in part to his use of a plastic saxophone; he had purchased it in Los Angeles in 1954 because he was unable to afford a metal saxophone at the time.

On his Atlantic recordings, Coleman&#x27;s sidemen were Cherry on cornet or pocket trumpet; Charlie Haden, Scott LaFaro, and then Jimmy Garrison on bass; and Higgins or Ed Blackwell on drums. Coleman&#x27;s complete recordings for the label were collected on the box set &quot;Beauty Is a Rare Thing&quot; in 1993.

=== 1960s: &quot;Free Jazz&quot; and Blue Note===
In 1960, Coleman recorded &quot;Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation&quot;, which featured a double quartet, including Don Cherry and Freddie Hubbard on trumpet, Eric Dolphy on bass clarinet, Haden and LaFaro on bass, and both Higgins and Blackwell on drums. The album was recorded in stereo, with a reed/brass/bass/drums quartet isolated in each stereo channel. &quot;Free Jazz&quot; was, at 37 minutes, the longest recorded continuous jazz performance at the time and was one of Coleman&#x27;s most controversial albums. In the January 18, 1962, issue of &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine, Pete Welding gave the album five stars while John A. Tynan rated it zero stars.

While Coleman had intended &quot;free jazz&quot; as simply an album title, free jazz was soon considered a new genre; Coleman expressed discomfort with the term.

After the Atlantic period, Coleman&#x27;s music became more angular and engaged with the avant-garde jazz which had developed in part around his innovations. After his quartet disbanded, he formed a trio with David Izenzon on bass and Charles Moffett on drums, and began playing trumpet and violin in addition to the saxophone. His friendship with Albert Ayler influenced his development on trumpet and violin. Charlie Haden sometimes joined this trio to form a two-bass quartet.

In 1966, Coleman signed with Blue Note and released the two-volume live album &quot;At the &quot;Golden Circle&quot; Stockholm&quot;, featuring Izenzon and Moffett. Later that year, he recorded &quot;The Empty Foxhole&quot; with his ten year-old son Denardo Coleman and Haden; Freddie Hubbard and Shelly Manne regarded Denardo&#x27;s appearance on the album as an ill-advised piece of publicity. Denardo later became his father&#x27;s primary drummer in the late 1970s.

Coleman formed another quartet. Haden, Garrison, and Elvin Jones appeared, and Dewey Redman joined the group, usually on tenor saxophone. On February 29, 1968, Coleman&#x27;s quartet performed live with Yoko Ono at the Royal Albert Hall, and a recording from their rehearsal was subsequently included on Ono&#x27;s 1970 album &quot;Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band&quot; as the track &quot;AOS&quot;.

He explored his interest in string textures on &quot;Town Hall, 1962&quot;, culminating in the 1972 album &quot;Skies of America&quot; with the London Symphony Orchestra.

===1970s–1990s: Harmolodic funk and Prime Time===
Coleman, like Miles Davis before him, soon took to playing with electric instruments. The 1976 album &quot;Dancing in Your Head&quot;, Coleman&#x27;s first recording with the group which later became known as Prime Time, prominently featured two electric guitarists. While this marked a stylistic departure for Coleman, the music retained aspects of what he called harmolodics&quot;.&quot;

Coleman&#x27;s 1980s albums with Prime Time such as &quot;Virgin Beauty&quot; and &quot;Of Human Feelings&quot; continued to use rock and funk rhythms in a style sometimes called free funk. Jerry Garcia played guitar on three tracks on &quot;Virgin Beauty&quot;: &quot;Three Wishes&quot;, &quot;Singing in the Shower&quot;, and &quot;Desert Players&quot;. Coleman joined the Grateful Dead on stage in 1993 during &quot;Space&quot; and stayed for &quot;The Other One&quot;, &quot;Stella Blue&quot;, Bobby Bland&#x27;s &quot;Turn on Your Lovelight&quot;, and the encore &quot;Brokedown Palace&quot;.

In December 1985, Coleman and guitarist Pat Metheny recorded &quot;Song X.&quot;

In 1990, the city of Reggio Emilia, Italy, held a three-day &quot;Portrait of the Artist&quot; festival in Coleman&#x27;s honor, in which he performed with Cherry, Haden, and Higgins. The festival also presented performances of his chamber music and &quot;Skies of America&quot;. In 1991, Coleman played on the soundtrack of David Cronenberg&#x27;s film &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;; the orchestra was conducted by Howard Shore. Coleman released four records in 1995 and 1996, and for the first time in many years worked regularly with piano players (Geri Allen and Joachim Kühn).

=== 2000s ===
Two 1972 Coleman recordings, &quot;Happy House&quot; and &quot;Foreigner in a Free Land&quot;, were used in Gus Van Sant&#x27;s 2000 &quot;Finding Forrester&quot;.

In September 2006, Coleman released the album &quot;Sound Grammar&quot;. Recorded live in Ludwigshafen, Germany, in 2005, it was his first album of new material in ten years. It won the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for music, making Coleman only the second jazz musician (after Wynton Marsalis) to win the prize.

== Personal life ==
Jazz pianist Joanne Brackeen stated in an interview with Marian McPartland that Coleman mentored her and gave her music lessons.

Coleman married poet Jayne Cortez in 1954. The couple divorced in 1964. They had one son, Denardo, born in 1956.

Coleman died of cardiac arrest in Manhattan on June 11, 2015, aged 85. His funeral was a three-hour event with performances and speeches by several of his collaborators and contemporaries.

<text>Bretby Hall is a country house at Bretby, Derbyshire, England, north of Swadlincote and east of Burton upon Trent on the border with Staffordshire. It is a Grade II listed building. The name &quot;Bretby&quot; means &quot;dwelling place of Britons&quot;.

==History==
The first Bretby Hall was built in 1630 after Thomas Stanhope bought the manor of Bretby from the family of Stephen de Segrave, to whom it had been granted by Ranulph de Blondeville, 4th Earl of Chester.

In 1628, his grandson Philip was made Earl of Chesterfield by King Charles I of England. From then on, Bretby Hall was the ancestral home of the Earls of Chesterfield.

The second Earl was responsible for a complete restyling of the gardens so that some compared them favourably with the gardens at Versailles.

The fifth Earl demolished the mansion and built the present Hall (c.1812) to a design by Sir Jeffry Wyatville.

The sixth Earl, known as the &quot;racing Earl&quot;, loved cricket and shooting, so he built a cricket pitch and raised game birds.

Following the death of the seventh Earl in 1871, the Estate passed to his widowed mother, Anne Elizabeth, Dowager Countess of Chesterfield, who was a close friend of Benjamin Disraeli. On the death of the Countess, her estates devolved upon Lord Porchester, the eldest son of her daughter, Evelyn (died 1875), who had married Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon in 1861. The 5th Earl of Carnarvon, the famous egyptologist for whom Howard Carter discovered the tomb of Tutankhamun, commenced breaking up the Bretby estate during World War I. The Carnarvons never lived at Bretby Park, preferring their home at Highclere Castle, near Newbury, Berkshire. They did make regular visits, however, particularly for shooting. The main estate was sold to John Downing Wragg, a Swadlincote industrialist. The proceeds helped to fund Carter&#x27;s search for the tomb of Tutankhamen in Egypt in the early 1920s.

==Bretby Hall today==
In 1926, the Hall was sold to Derbyshire County Council and was run as Bretby Hall Hospital until 28 February 1997. It opened as a sanatorium to treat children but became an orthopaedic centre.

The hall was sold to a private developer and converted to luxury apartments and suites.

<text>Bretby is a village and civil parish in the south of Derbyshire, England, north of Swadlincote and east of Burton upon Trent, on the border between Derbyshire and Staffordshire. The population of the civil parish as of the 2011 census was 893. The name means &quot;dwelling place of Britons&quot;. On the A511 road (formerly A50), there is a secondary settlement, Stanhope Bretby, which was the site of Bretby Colliery.

==History==
This manor (&quot;Bretebi&quot;) was in the Domesday Book in 1086. Under the title of &quot;The land of the King (in Derbyshire&quot; it said: In Newton Solney and Bretby Ælfgar had seven of land to the . There is land for six ploughs. There the king has one plough and nineteen and one with five ploughs. There are of meadow, woodland pasture two leagues long and three furlongs broad. TRE as now worth one hundred shillings.
In 1209, Ranulph de Blondeville, 4th Earl of Chester granted the manor of Bretby to Stephen de Segrave who built a church and a mansion there. There was also Bretby Castle which was destroyed during the reign of King James I of England to make way for the construction of Bretby Hall.

In 1585, Thomas Stanhope bought Bretby Hall, which from then on was the home of the Earls of Chesterfield. George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon sold the property in the 1920s to pay for the Tutankhamun expedition.

==Today==
Today the village is centred by a village green. Overlooking the green is a residential house which records that it was called &#x27;Bradby School&#x27; when it was built. A stone records &quot;BRADBY SCHOOL/OPENED FOR THE ADMISSION OF SCHOLARS/OCTOBER 20th 1806.&quot; The school building is a Grade II listed building.

The Grade II listed Church of England parish church is dedicated to St Wystan; it was rebuilt in 1877 by Anne Stanhope, Countess of Chesterfield. A memorial tablet on the south wall of the aisle is in memory of Benjamin Disraeli.

There is a small industrial area within Burton upon Trent and Swadlincote Green Belt, Bretby Stoneware Industrial Estate, based at the former Bretby Brick Works. It is at Middle Place, an access road which is a continuation of the Sunnyside lane from nearby Newhall through to the A511 Ashby Road.

<text>Joyce Irene Grenfell (&quot;née&quot; Phipps; 10 February 1910 – 30 November 1979) was an English diseuse, singer, actress and writer. She was known for the songs and monologues she wrote and performed, at first in revues and later in her solo shows. She never appeared as a stage actress, but had roles, mostly comic, in many films, including Miss Gossage in &quot;The Happiest Days of Your Life&quot; (1950) and Police Sergeant Ruby Gates in the St Trinian&#x27;s series (from 1954). She was a well-known broadcaster on radio and television. As a writer, she was the first radio critic for &quot;The Observer&quot;, contributed to &quot;Punch&quot; and published two volumes of memoirs.

Born to an affluent Anglo-American family, Grenfell had abandoned early hopes of becoming an actress when she was invited to perform a comic monologue in a West End revue in 1939. Its success led to a career as an entertainer, giving her creations in theatres in five continents between 1940 and 1969.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Born in Montpelier Square, Knightsbridge, London, Grenfell was the daughter of an American socialite, Nora Langhorne, one of five daughters of Chiswell Langhorne, an American railway millionaire), and of the architect Paul Phipps, the grandson of Charles Paul Phipps and a second cousin of the diseuse Ruth Draper, in whose professional footsteps she followed. The Phipps family were wealthy clothiers, whose success allowed them to join the gentry of their native Wiltshire. Nancy Astor was one of her maternal aunts; Grenfell often visited her at the Astors’ home of Cliveden and lived in a cottage on the estate, a mile from the main house, in the early years of her marriage.

Joyce Phipps had an upper middle-class London childhood. Among her friends was Virginia Graham, with whom she kept up a lifelong correspondence, and who wrote Grenfell&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;. Grenfell attended the Francis Holland School in central London, and the Claremont Fan Court School, in Esher, Surrey. She then went to a finishing school in Paris at the age of 17. After this she enrolled at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, but found the hard work of learning the craft of acting less glamorous than she had imagined and left after a single term. She supposed at the time that this &quot;was the finish of my dreams of becoming an actress&quot;. On 23 May 1928 she was presented as a débutante at Buckingham Palace.

In 1927 she had met Reginald Pascoe Grenfell (1903–1993), a mining executive and later a lieutenant colonel in the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps. They were married two years later, on 12 December 1929 at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, and remained together until her death nearly 50 years later. They were a devoted couple: Reggie Grenfell looked after his wife&#x27;s financial and business affairs, and his encouragement gave her strong support. After she became a celebrity she unobtrusively made sure that he was never seen as a mere adjunct to her. They were unable to have children of their own.

===Early career===
In the late 1930s Grenfell contributed verses to &quot;Punch&quot; and helped to entertain her aunt&#x27;s guests at Cliveden. After one lunch, J. L. Garvin, the editor of &quot;The Observer&quot;, engaged her as the paper&#x27;s first radio critic. At an informal supper given by the BBC producer Stephen Potter in January 1939, she agreed to his request to entertain her fellow guests with a monologue of her own devising. This was &quot;Useful and Acceptable Gifts&quot;, in which she played a gauche lecturer at a meeting of the Women&#x27;s Institute. The impresario Herbert Farjeon was among the guests and he invited her to perform the piece in his forthcoming revue at the Little Theatre, London. She was an immediate success, winning glowing notices. &quot;The Stage&quot; judged her &quot;outstanding ... this clever diseuse successfully catches the naif manner of an amateur speaker lecturing on &#x27;useful and acceptable gifts&#x27;, and gives us a neat and satirical impersonation of an American mother listening to her small daughter reciting Shelley&#x27;s &#x27;Ode to a Skylark&#x27;&quot;. &quot;The Tatler&quot; found her two monologues &quot;quite the best items in the programme&quot;. &quot;The Sketch&quot; devoted a full page to photographs of her in her different characters. &quot;The Bystander&quot; thought that Grenfell challenged the celebrated Ruth Draper &quot;on her own pitch ... carry[ing] off the acting honours of this gay and intelligent entertainment.&quot;

During the Second World War Grenfell wrote for and appeared in three more West End revues: &quot;Diversion&quot; and &quot;Diversion No. 2&quot; at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in 1940 and 1941, and &quot;Light and Shade&quot; at the Ambassadors in 1942. In early 1942 she met the composer Richard Addinsell. Together they wrote many successful songs including &quot;I&#x27;m Going to See You Today&quot; and &quot;Turn Back the Clock&quot;, which, in the words of the biographer Janie Hampton, &quot;aptly caught the public mood&quot;.

In 1941 Grenfell appeared in her first film role, as the American mother in Carol Reed&#x27;s short documentary &quot;A Letter from Home&quot;. She made three more films during the war. For BBC radio, together with Potter, she wrote and starred in an occasional radio series called &quot;How to …&quot;, which ran intermittently from 1943 until 1962 offering humorous advice on how (and how not) to do things. In 1943 she made her only attempt at acting in a stage play: she resigned from the cast of a West End production of the American comedy &quot;Junior Miss&quot; after the first three days of rehearsal, finding that onstage she could only perform looking straight at an audience, and could not &quot;act sideways&quot;, although she found some film acting roles &quot;fun to do&quot;.

In the later years of the war Grenfell toured in the UK for ENSA, sometimes with Addinsell accompanying her at the piano. In late 1943 the head of ENSA, Basil Dean, invited the two to tour troop camps and hospitals in North Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere. Addinsell&#x27;s health was too fragile to permit him to accept, and Grenfell recruited Viola Tunnard, later better known as a close colleague of Benjamin Britten. In 1944 and 1945 they performed in Algeria, Malta, Sicily, Italy, Iran, Iraq, India and Egypt.

===Post-war work ===
Back in London Grenfell wrote the song &quot;Du Maurier&quot; (music by Addinsell) and the monologue &quot;Travelling Broadens the Mind&quot;, both of which she performed in Noël Coward&#x27;s first post-war revue, &quot;Sigh No More&quot; (1945). Coward had been a family friend since Grenfell was a girl. At first he had viewed her transition from amateur to professional with some doubt. Within a few years he had come to recognise her professionalism, her skill as a performer (&quot;good in all she does on the stage&quot;) and the quality of her monologues, even if &quot;she shouldn&#x27;t write lyrics.&quot; In addition to her own two numbers, she sang Coward&#x27;s comic catalogue of domestic disasters &quot;That is the End of the News&quot;, &quot;disguised as a schoolgirl with pigtails, all my make-up off, a shiny face and a terrible grin.&quot;

After the 1947 revue &quot;Tuppence Coloured&quot;, Grenfell developed new sketches including the first of her six Nursery School monologues, with the harassed teacher&#x27;s recurring cry to one of her unseen charges, &quot;George – don&#x27;t do that...&quot; In the 1951 revue &quot;Penny Plain&quot; she performed her &quot;Joyful Noise&quot; (music by Donald Swann), a parody of an amateur choir (&quot;And some of us cannot sing much, And some can&#x27;t sing at all, But how we love our outings to the Royal Albert Hall&quot;). After this, Grenfell and Tunnard made another tour entertaining British troops in North Africa.

&quot;Joyce Grenfell Requests the Pleasure&quot; (1954) was her first more or less solo West End show (there were three dancers providing interludes between Grenfell&#x27;s numbers). &quot;The Stage&quot; commented that any doubts that Grenfell could sustain a solo evening were quickly dispelled:

After two provincial tours and a year in London she took the show to Broadway, where it had a sell-out eight-week run. For this show there was a pit band of eight players directed by William Blezard. In later shows Grenfell simplified the format further, dispensing with dancers and band, and being accompanied only by Blezard at the piano.

During the 1950s and 1960s Grenfell appeared in several film roles including &quot;Lovely Ducks&quot;, the shooting gallery attendant in &quot;Stage Fright&quot; (1950), Miss Gossage in &quot;The Happiest Days of Your Life&quot; (1950), Police Sergeant Ruby Gates in the St Trinian&#x27;s series, Mrs Barham in &quot;The Americanization of Emily&quot; and Hortense Astor in &quot;The Yellow Rolls-Royce&quot;. Away from the theatre, Grenfell served as a member of the influential Pilkington Committee on Broadcasting from 1960 to 1962, and was president of the Society of Women Broadcasters and Writers.

The rest of Grenfell&#x27;s stage career was in a series of solo shows in London and on tour. Between 1957 and 1970 she gave her show &quot;Joyce Grenfell&quot; in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland and the United States, as well as around Britain and in the West End. Her last live performance was at Windsor Castle for the Queen&#x27;s Waterloo Dinner in 1973.

===Last years and legacy===
Soon after the Windsor Castle show Grenfell was taken ill with an eye condition, which was subsequently diagnosed as cancer. As a convinced Christian Scientist (like her aunt Nancy), she was averse to doctors and hospitals. Her husband did not share her beliefs and prevailed on her to undergo treatment. The eye had to be removed and replaced with an artificial one. After this Grenfell did not return to the stage, but gave talks for charitable organisations and appeared frequently on the BBC television programme &quot;Face the Music&quot;.

In October 1979 she became seriously ill and died a month later, on 30 November 1979, just before her golden wedding anniversary. She was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 4 December and her ashes scattered there. On 7 February 1980 a memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey.

Grenfell was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1946 for her war work. It was confirmed after her death that she was to have been made a Dame Commander (DBE) in the 1980 New Year Honours List. In 1998, the Royal Mail memorialised Grenfell with her image on a postage stamp as part of a series of stamps celebrating five comedians, drawn by Gerald Scarfe.

Grenfell&#x27;s widower, Reggie Grenfell, died at their home at 34 Elm Park Gardens, Chelsea, London, on 31 March 1993, aged 89. A blue plaque is on the wall stating that Joyce Grenfell lived in Flat 8 from 1957-1979.

In 2002 her friend Janie Hampton published a biography, &quot;Joyce Grenfell&quot;. Maureen Lipman toured with the one-woman show &quot;Re: Joyce!&quot;, which she co-wrote with James Roose-Evans. In it she recreates some of Grenfell&#x27;s best-known sketches. Lipman also presented the radio programme &quot;Choice Grenfell&quot;, compiled from Grenfell&#x27;s writings. Roose-Evans also edited &quot;Darling Ma&quot;, a 1997 collection of Grenfell&#x27;s letters to her mother.

<doc id="153087" wikidata="Q5673556" url="?curid=153087" title="Harry Worth (actor, born 1917)">
<text>Harry Bourlon Illingsworth (20 November 1917 – 20 July 1989), professionally known as Harry Worth, was an English comedy actor, comedian and ventriloquist. Worth portrayed a charming, gentle and genial character, totally bemused by life, creating comedic confusion wherever he went.

==Early life==
Worth was born in Hoyland Common, West Riding of Yorkshire, the youngest child of a miner. He had ten siblings. When he was only five months old, his father died from injuries resulting from an industrial accident. He left school at 14 and was a miner for eight years. He earned 2 shillings 2½ pence a day and worked near the lift in the mine; he said he hated every minute of it. He joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1941.

As a teenager, he was in the Tankersley Amateur Dramatics Society and taught himself ventriloquism from a book he borrowed from the local library, buying his first dummy in 1936. During the Second World War, he performed in an RAF variety show in India and had extra material written for him by the show&#x27;s director, Wallie Okin. Worth warned his audience beforehand that he was not very good: according to &quot;ITMA&quot; impressionist Peter Cavanagh, this was the start of his apologetic and inept style.

He was a variety act for many years before he became well known and was often at the bottom of any &#x27;bill&#x27;. Having left the RAF, and adamant he would never go down the mines again, he started in show business with his first booking at the Bradford Mechanics&#x27; Institute in 1946. In 1947 he married his wife Kay and in 1948, like many other comedians from the forces, he got an audition at London&#x27;s Windmill Theatre. Of 40 in the audition, he passed, along with Morecambe and Wise and Tony Hancock. He did six shows a day as comedian between fan dancers. In 1948 he also made his first radio appearance in a show &quot;New to You&quot;. He now had two dummies for his ventriloquist act, Fotheringay and Clarence, but meanwhile developed his performing voice.

He toured for two years with Laurel and Hardy towards the end of their careers. He said he could always go in and talk with them and they told him about Hollywood and their work there. When Oliver Hardy watched his show in Nottingham in 1952, he persuaded Worth to drop the ventriloquist routine and concentrate on becoming a comedian, which he then did. His first stage act without ventriloquism was in Newcastle. He continued to include ventriloquism in his cabaret act through his career, performing much of the material that he had used during the war. This included three appearances in the Royal Variety Show.

After appearing a number of times on &quot;Variety Bandbox&quot;, Worth gained his own radio show, &quot;Thirty Minutes Worth&quot;. He took his scripts seriously and did not &quot;ad lib&quot;. He said he built a style of dithering in his shows without even realising it.

==Television career==
Worth&#x27;s first television appearance was a five-minute standup on &quot;Henry Hall&#x27;s Guest Night&quot; in 1955. He became well known to the public and even appeared at the London Palladium, after which he took the show to Manchester, the main place for variety in those days, for eight weeks. In 1960, the television programme &quot;The Trouble With Harry&quot; was broadcast. John Ammonds and Worth wrote the pilot script in three to four weeks. A series of six programmes was commissioned, and was written by Vince Powell, Ronnie Taylor and Frank Roscoe.

He made this style his own by creating a character with whom the public could connect. He once said, &quot;If Harry (the character) ever looked directly at the camera, or the audience, it would all be over&quot;. The character was Harry and everyone saw Harry as Harry.

He is now best remembered for his 1960s series &quot;Here&#x27;s Harry&quot;, later re-titled &quot;Harry Worth&quot;, which ran for 10 years and over 100 episodes (the longest running British sitcom of the time, and still one of only a handful to run for over 100 episodes). The opening titles of &quot;Harry Worth&quot; featured Worth stopping in the street to perform an optical trick involving a shop window: raising one arm and one leg which were reflected in the window, thus giving the impression of levitation. Reproducing this effect was popularly known as &quot;doing a Harry Worth&quot;. The shop window sequence first used in &quot;Here&#x27;s Harry&quot; was filmed at St Ann&#x27;s Square, Manchester, at Hector Powes tailor&#x27;s shop. The idea for this was suggested by Vince Powell, who had done it himself as a child.

One famous comic sketch involved Worth and his family preparing for a royal visit to the area, during which the Queen was to visit his house. His fussing about the house drove his family mad. Just before the Queen was due to arrive, a beggar arrived at the door and kept coming back as an increasingly frustrated Worth tried to get him to go away. When a knock came on the door one more time Worth grabbed a bucket of filthy water and threw it out of the door at the caller, only to find that it was not the beggar but the Queen standing there, and he had just soaked her. Another sketch involved Worth complaining to a policeman outside the Houses of Parliament that Big Ben clock was slow because Jimmy Young, the BBC Radio 2 presenter known for &quot;always being right&quot; had said that it was ten minutes past ten, while the clock said it was 10am. After pestering the policeman, Worth had the clock moved forward by ten minutes. Just as the clock was changed, Young appeared on the radio to apologise that the studio clock was wrong by ten minutes. A mortified Worth was seen speeding away in his car, to furious shouts from the angry policeman.

Following the assassination of President Kennedy on 22 November 1963, the BBC screened &quot;Here&#x27;s Harry&quot; as part of its regular programming, a decision which led to the broadcaster receiving complaints through over 2,000 phone calls and 500 letters and telegrams.

Although never scripted, his catchphrase was generally known as &quot;My name is Harry Worth. I don&#x27;t know why – but, there it is!&quot; It was really invented by impressionists of the day to give a common ground tag line to work with. One running joke in the television show involved references to Harry&#x27;s never seen aunt known only as &quot;Auntie&quot;, the popular nickname for the BBC itself. In one show, Harry commissioned a portrait of Auntie, only to receive a head-and-shoulders print of a woman with no face. He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in October 1963 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at Manchester&#x27;s Gaumont cinema.

By the early to mid-1980s Worth was forced by health problems to retire early from his shows, but he continued working in radio (and made television guest appearances from time to time for either interviews or pop-up guest appearances on some shows) until a few months before he died. Among the last regular appearances of his career were leading roles in the sitcoms &quot;How&#x27;s Your Father?&quot; (Yorkshire TV 1979–1980) and &quot;Oh Happy Band!&quot; (BBC TV 1980).

Worth&#x27;s last TV appearance was on Comic Relief in 1989 where he appeared with Melvyn Hayes in the BT Tower taking donation calls.

==Personal life==
Worth married Kay (Daisy) Flynn, who was a principal boy, in 1947. They decided early on that he would continue with his act whilst Kay became a housewife. They had a long and happy marriage and she cared for him during his long illness with cancer. During this time, he referred to her as &quot;Maggie Thatcher&quot; for diligently watching his daily medication intake and exercises. After several short-lived recoveries, Worth finally succumbed to spinal cancer. He died at his home &quot;Arisden&quot; in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, on 20 July 1989, with his wife, daughter (Jobyna) and grandchildren (Dane and Emma-Jo) at his side. Kay lived on for another 10 years. 

Worth resisted attempts by publishers to write his biography; it was over 16 years after his death before a book, &quot;My Name Is Harry Worth&quot;, by Roy Baines, was published.

==Legacy==
At his memorial service, Sir Harry Secombe said &quot;Harry has left a legacy of laughter and we have all been enriched by his presence here on Earth&quot;.

In October 2015, Barnsley-born actor, playwright and director Jack Land Noble (born 1989) brought Worth&#x27;s life and career to the stage in the world premiere of &quot;My Name is Harry Worth&quot;. The show was billed as &quot;a one-man tour-de-force written by and featuring Jack Land Noble as the forgotten son of British comedy. Hilarious yet poignant, &quot;My Name Is Harry Worth&quot; celebrates a pioneering comic talent in style.&quot; The play, which had the support of the Harry Worth estate, was first staged to great acclaim in Harry&#x27;s hometown of Barnsley at the town&#x27;s Lamproom Theatre, ahead of a prospective 2017 UK tour and run at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe marking Harry&#x27;s centenary. Speaking to BBC Radio Sheffield, Jack Land Noble explained, &quot;The time is ripe to bring Harry&#x27;s distinct talent back into the public arena. The play is my humble tribute to my comedy idol: a dithering, surreal comic genius and, arguably, Yorkshire&#x27;s finest comic son.&quot;

==Memorials==

On 20 July 2010 a British Comedy Society blue plaque was unveiled by comedian Jimmy Cricket, a friend of Worth&#x27;s, on the house where he was born in Hoyland Common. The unveiling was arranged in conjunction with Worth&#x27;s biographer, Roy Baines, and the event was sponsored by Revelation Films, who released a DVD of Worth&#x27;s work the same week. He has also been commemorated by plaques elsewhere, including those at Teddington Studios, BBC Television Centre and Blackpool Comedy Carpet.

Sawalha was educated at the Theatre Arts School, a fee-paying independent school which is part of the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts, based at the time in Clapham in south London, which she left at the age of fifteen.

==Career==
Sawalha made her debut in the 1982 BBC miniseries &quot;Fame Is the Spur&quot;, and in 1988 played a small role in &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;, on the episode &quot;Last Seen Wearing&quot;. She first gained attention for her starring role in the Bafta award-winning ITV teenage comedy-drama &quot;Press Gang&quot;, which ran from 1989 to 1993.

In 1992, she appeared in episode &quot;Parade&quot; (S2 E4) of &quot;Bottom&quot; as Veronica Head, a beautiful young barmaid at the Lamb and Flag, whom Richie tries to woo by boasting falsely of his adventures in the Falklands.

From 1991 to 1994, she starred in the ITV family comedy &quot;Second Thoughts&quot; and continued with her character, Hannah (Lynda Bellingham&#x27;s daughter), in the British Comedy Award-winning &quot;Faith in the Future&quot; (1995–1998). In 1994, she played Mercy (Merry) Pecksniff in the BBC production of &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;.

She joined actor Ioan Gruffudd in the TV adaptations, of C. S. Forester&#x27;s &quot;Horatio Hornblower&quot; novels, as the captain&#x27;s wife Maria. The following year, she became Alan Davies&#x27;s co-star in &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot; after Caroline Quentin left, appearing in a Christmas Special (&quot;Satan&#x27;s Chimney&quot;). She returned for a series between 2003 and 2004.

In 2006, she participated in the third series of the genealogy documentary series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; tracing her family&#x27;s roots, which are Jordanian Bedouin on her father&#x27;s side and French Huguenot on her mother&#x27;s. She also appeared in the pilot of BBC 1&#x27;s &quot;A Taste of My Life&quot; presented by Nigel Slater.

After a two-year break, she was back on screen in May 2007, competing in the BBC dog training celebrity reality show &quot;The Underdog Show.&quot; She then returned to acting in two successive BBC costume dramas: as Jessie Brown in 2007 series &quot;Cranford&quot;, followed by &quot;Lark Rise to Candleford&quot; from 2008 to 2011. She provided the voice acting for Sister Hannah (also known as &quot;Hammer&quot;), a main character in the 2008 Xbox 360 video game &quot;Fable II&quot;. In autumn 2014, Sawalha played the part of Jan Ward in BBC One&#x27;s thriller miniseries &quot;Remember Me&quot;. On 9 May 2015, she read the account of a member of the Women&#x27;s Land Army at &quot;VE Day 70: A Party to Remember&quot; in Horse Guards Parade, London, which was broadcast live on BBC1. In 2016, she appeared in an episode of &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;, and reprised her role as Saffy Monsoon in &quot;Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie&quot;.

In July 2020, she made a statement revealing Aardman Animations intended to recast her character of Ginger in the upcoming sequel to &quot;Chicken Run,&quot; stating that she is now considered to sound too old, and commented &quot;I have officially been plucked, stuffed &amp; roasted&quot;. The decision was met with widespread criticism with some finding the decision ageist. She even released video clips online, dubbing over her original voice lines to prove her voice still sounded the same.

In January 2024, Sawalha participated in the fifth series of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as the character &quot;Bubble Tea&quot;. She was eliminated and unmasked in the fourth episode.

==Personal life==
On 1 January 2004, tabloid newspapers reported that she had married Alan Davies, with whom she co-starred in the television series &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot;. Both she and Davies, who avoided discussing their private lives in public, denied this, and took legal action against the reports.

<text>Hugh Todd Naylor Gaitskell (9 April 1906 – 18 January 1963) was a British politician who was Leader of the Labour Party and Leader of the Opposition from 1955 until his death in 1963. An economics lecturer and wartime civil servant, he was elected to Parliament in 1945 and held office in Clement Attlee&#x27;s governments, notably as Minister of Fuel and Power following the bitter winter of 1946–47, and eventually joining the Cabinet as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Facing the need to increase military spending in 1951, he imposed National Health Service charges on dentures and spectacles, prompting the leading left-winger Aneurin Bevan to resign from the Cabinet.

The perceived similarity in his outlook to that of his Conservative Party counterpart Rab Butler was dubbed &quot;Butskellism&quot;, initially a satirical term blending their names, and was one aspect of the post-war consensus through which the major parties largely agreed on the main points of domestic and foreign policy until the 1970s. With Labour in opposition from 1951, Gaitskell won bitter leadership battles with Bevan and his supporters to become the Leader of the Labour Party and Leader of the Opposition in 1955. In 1956 he opposed the Eden government&#x27;s use of military force at Suez. Against a backdrop of a booming economy he led Labour to its third successive defeat at the 1959 general election.

In the late 1950s, in the teeth of opposition from the major trade unions, he attempted in vain to remove Clause IV of the Labour Party Constitution, which committed Labour to nationalisation of all the means of production. He did not reject public ownership altogether, but also emphasised the ethical goals of liberty, social welfare and above all equality, and argued that they could be achieved by fiscal and social policies within a mixed economy. His revisionist views, on the right wing of the Labour Party, were sometimes called Gaitskellism.

Despite this setback, Gaitskell reversed an attempt to adopt unilateral nuclear disarmament as Labour Party policy, and opposed Prime Minister Harold Macmillan&#x27;s attempt to lead the UK into the European Common Market. He died suddenly in 1963, when he appeared to be on the verge of leading Labour back into power and becoming the next prime minister.

== Early life ==
Hugh Gaitskell was born in Kensington, London, the third and youngest child of Arthur Gaitskell (1869–1915), of the Indian Civil Service, and Adelaide Mary, &quot;née&quot; Jamieson (died 1956), whose father, George Jamieson, was consul-general in Shanghai and prior to that had been Judge of the British Supreme Court for China and Japan. He was known as &quot;Sam&quot; as a child. The Gaitskells had a long family connection with the Indian Army, and he spent his childhood in Burma. After his father&#x27;s death, his mother soon remarried and returned to Burma, leaving him at boarding school.

Gaitskell was educated at the Dragon School from 1912 to 1919, where he was a friend of the future poet John Betjeman. He then attended Winchester College from 1919 to 1924.

He attended New College, Oxford, from 1924 to 1927. Studying under G. D. H. Cole, Gaitskell became a socialist and wrote a long essay on Chartism, arguing that the working class needed middle class leadership. Gaitskell&#x27;s first political involvement came about as a result of the General Strike of 1926. Most students supported the government and many volunteered for civil defence duties, or helped to run essential services. Gaitskell, unusually, supported the strikers and acted as a driver for people like his Oxford contemporary Evan Durbin and Cole&#x27;s wife Margaret, who made speeches and delivered the trade union newspaper &quot;British Worker&quot;. After the collapse of the General Strike, Gaitskell spent another six months raising funds for the miners, whose dispute (technically a lockout rather than a strike) did not end until November. He graduated with a first-class degree in Philosophy, politics and economics in 1927.

== Academic and early political career ==
In 1927–28 Gaitskell lectured in economics for the Workers&#x27; Educational Association to miners in Nottinghamshire. His essay on Chartism was published as a WEA booklet in 1928. This was his first experience of interaction with the working class. Gaitskell eventually came to oppose both Cole&#x27;s Guild socialism and Syndicalism and to feel that the General Strike had been the last failed spasm of a strategy – attempting to seize power through direct trade union action – which had already been tried in the abortive Triple Alliance Strike of 1921. It is unclear whether Gaitskell was ever sympathetic to Oswald Mosley, then seen as a future leader of the Labour Party. Gaitskell&#x27;s wife later insisted that he never had been, but Margaret Cole, Evan Durbin&#x27;s wife and Noel Hall believed that he was, although as an opponent of factional splits he was not tempted to join Mosley&#x27;s New Party in 1931.

Gaitskell helped to run the New Fabian Research Bureau, set up by G. D. H. Cole in March 1931. He was selected as Labour candidate for Chatham in autumn 1932. Gaitskell moved to University College London in the early 1930s at the invitation of Noel Hall. In 1934 he joined the XYZ Club, a club for Labour financial experts (e.g. Hugh Dalton, of whom he became a protégé, Douglas Jay and Evan Durbin) and City people such as the economist Nicholas Davenport. Dalton and Gaitskell were often referred to as &quot;Big Hugh and Little Hugh&quot; over the next fifteen years.

In 1934 Gaitskell was in Vienna on a Rockefeller scholarship. He was attached to the University of Vienna for the 1933–34 academic year and witnessed first-hand the political suppression of the social democratic workers movement by the conservative Engelbert Dollfuss&#x27;s government in February 1934. This event made a lasting impression, making him profoundly hostile to conservatism but also making him reject as futile the Marxian outlook of many European social democrats. This placed him in the socialist revisionist camp.

At the 1935 general election, he stood unsuccessfully as the Labour Party candidate for Chatham. Gaitskell helped to draft &quot;Labour&#x27;s Immediate Programme&quot; in 1937. This had a strong emphasis on planning, although not as much as his mentor Dalton would have liked, with no plans for the nationalisation of banks or the steel industry. He also drafted documents which would have been used in the election due in 1939–40. Dalton helped him to be selected as candidate for South Leeds in 1937, and had it not been for the war, he would very likely have become an MP by 1940.

Gaitskell became head of the Department of Political Economy at UCL when Hall was appointed Director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in 1938, jointly with Paul Rosenstein-Rodan. He also became a University Reader. He opposed the appeasement of Nazi Germany and supported rearmament.

==Personal life==
According to Michael Bloch, Gaitskell enjoyed a number of same-sex relationships while at Oxford, including with John Betjeman, and in the 1930s in Vienna, with John Gunther.

Whilst a WEA lecturer in the late 1920s Gaitskell lived for a time with a local woman in Nottinghamshire. This is thought to have been his first adult relationship. Until the early 1930s he rejected marriage as a &quot;bourgeois convention&quot;.

By the mid-1930s Gaitskell had formed a close relationship with a married woman, Mrs. Dora Frost (née Creditor), who came out to join him in Vienna for the latter part of his stay there. Adultery still carried such stigma that she thought it best not to help him during his Parliamentary campaign in Chatham in 1935. After her divorce, hard to obtain prior to the passage of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1937, they were eventually married on 9 April 1937, Gaitskell&#x27;s thirty-first birthday, with Evan Durbin as best man. Dora had a son, Raymond Frost (b 1925), from her first marriage. The Gaitskells had two daughters: Julia, born in 1939, and Cressida, born in 1942. Dora Gaitskell became a Labour life peer a year after her husband&#x27;s death and died in 1989.

Gaitskell had a long-term affair in the 1950s with the socialite Ann Fleming, the wife of the writer Ian Fleming. She wrote to Evelyn Waugh about a dinner party in 1958 in which Gaitskell and friends from Oxford days &quot;held hands and recited verse because in early life they had loved each other in the same set&quot;, until the arrival of her husband &quot;silenced the eminent homos&quot;, who &quot;did not seem too pleased.&quot; Woodrow Wyatt wrote that &quot;there was a scintilla of platonic homosexuality in [Gaitskell&#x27;s] affection for Tony [Crosland]&quot;

In private he was humorous and fun loving, with a love of ballroom dancing. This contrasted with his stern public image. He was a member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group.

== Wartime civil servant and election to Parliament ==
During the Second World War, from the formation of Churchill&#x27;s coalition government in May 1940 Gaitskell worked with Noel Hall and Hugh Dalton as a senior civil servant for the Ministry of Economic Warfare, giving him experience of government. As Dalton&#x27;s Private Secretary Gaitskell was more of a &quot;Chef de Cabinet&quot; and trusted adviser. Observers watched Gaitskell blossom and enjoy exercising power. Dalton liked to shout at his subordinates; Gaitskell sometimes shouted back. Along with Dalton, Gaitskell was moved to the Board of Trade in February 1942, where for the first time he came into contact with the leaders of the miners&#x27; unions, who were later to support him in his struggles against Aneurin Bevan in the 1950s. For his service, he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1945.

In March 1945 Gaitskell suffered a coronary thrombosis brought on by overwork. Advised to rest, he considered withdrawing from his parliamentary candidacy in Leeds, but he was popular with his constituency workers and they offered to campaign for him even if he was unable to do so. He was also approached to return to UCL as a Professor after the war, but he disliked the constant state of flux of academic economics and the increasing emphasis on mathematics, a subject of which he had little knowledge. By now he found himself more drawn to public life.

Gaitskell was elected Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Leeds South in the Labour landslide victory of 1945. Despite his illness, as a protégé of Dalton he was seriously considered for immediate appointment as a junior minister, Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Board of Trade (under Stafford Cripps). This would have been a rare honour since 263 of the 393 Labour MPs in 1945 were newly elected, but it did not take place.

As a backbencher he spoke in debates in support of Dalton&#x27;s nationalisation of the Bank of England, which eventually received Royal Assent on 14 February 1946. Dalton was trying to score party points by claiming that he was reasserting political control over the City of London, a far-fetched claim as the Bank was already under political control. Although some Conservative MPs spoke against the measure it was not opposed by Churchill, then Leader of the Opposition, who had had an ambivalent view of the Bank since his own time as chancellor in the 1920s.

== Ministry of Fuel and Power ==
Gaitskell was given his first ministerial appointment in May 1946 as Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Fuel and Power, serving under Emmanuel &quot;Manny&quot; Shinwell. The job had initially been earmarked for Harold Wilson, with Gaitskell pencilled in to succeed Wilson as Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Works. Gaitskell believed that Shinwell, who was suspicious of middle class intellectual socialists, may have picked him in preference to Wilson because the latter was already an expert on the mining industry.

Gaitskell played an important role steering the Coal Nationalisation Bill through the House of Commons, bearing the brunt of the committee stage and winding up the final debate. In the fuel crisis of February 1947 Shinwell, who had ignored Gaitskell&#x27;s warnings, had to ask the Cabinet for permission to shut down power stations; Gaitskell was put on and ran the key committee which decided where coal should be sent. In 1947 he once again played an important role steering electricity nationalisation through the House of Commons, winding up the debate on the second reading.

On 7 October 1947 Gaitskell was promoted to Minister of Fuel and Power in Shinwell&#x27;s place. He was not made a member of the Cabinet, although he often attended Cabinet meetings when his input was required. He had committed a gaffe during the municipal election campaign in Hastings earlier that year, when he recommended that people save fuel by taking fewer baths, adding that he had never taken all that many himself; in the House of Commons in late October Churchill joked that it was no wonder that the Government were &quot;in bad odour&quot; and asked the Speaker if he might be permitted to describe Labour ministers as &quot;lousey&quot;, normally an unparliamentary expression, as it would be a simple statement of fact. Gaitskell made himself very unpopular by abolishing the basic petrol ration for private motorists, but encouraged the building of oil refineries, a move little-noticed at the time which would have important repercussions for the future.

In early July 1949 Gaitskell shared Chancellor of the Exchequer Stafford Cripps&#x27; worries that Treasury officials were too &quot;liberal&quot; and too reluctant to implement socialist measures. Like Cripps and Dalton, Gaitskell was a devotee of cheap money. Not only were higher interest rates seen as associated with the Gold standard and the deflationary policies of the 1920s, but the policy preference in the 1940s was for quantitative controls (e.g. exchange controls in finance, or rationing of physical goods) rather than the price mechanism. Interest rates, which had been cut to low levels in the 1930s, did not begin to be used as an instrument of policy again until after the Conservatives returned to power in 1952.

Cripps was seriously unwell and had to go to Switzerland to convalesce on 18 July; Attlee announced that he was taking over Cripps&#x27; responsibilities with three young, financially able, ministers to advise him. Gaitskell soon emerged as the leader of the group, the others being Harold Wilson, President of the Board of Trade, and Douglas Jay, Economic Secretary to the Treasury. All three had been wartime civil servants.

The young ministers were now in favour of devaluation of the Pound sterling, currently at $4.03. Jay lunched with Gaitskell on 20 July 1949, and they agreed that this would help to reverse the drain of capital out of the UK, that the US was unlikely to help with further loans or gifts of dollars, that Commonwealth countries needed to be encouraged to buy British goods rather than goods priced in dollars, that there was potential to increase exports to dollar areas, and that if nothing was done there was a risk of reserves running low and a collapse in sterling putting the UK at the mercy of the US. On 21 July Gaitskell, Jay and Wilson met the Prime Minister to tell him that devaluation was inevitable as reserves were still dropping. On 29 July, the Cabinet agreed in principle to devalue, having also been given the same advice in another memo from senior civil servants, Sir Edward Bridges (Permanent Secretary to the Treasury) and the two Treasury Second Secretaries (Robert Hall and Sir Edwin Plowden).

Cripps returned to London on 18 August to be greeted by two memoranda from Gaitskell. One was a short paper advising a general election that autumn after devaluation. Cripps did indeed make that recommendation to Attlee, but it was rejected. The second paper was ten pages on devaluation, which in Edmund Dell&#x27;s view it is unlikely he actually read. Gaitskell argued that with employment high, the balance of payments in decent shape and inflation a containable problem, the &quot;only&quot; problem was shortage of dollars, with US opinion very reluctant to help the UK any more. He recommended spending cuts to keep inflation under control – but did not say how much. He also recommended that sterling initially float within a band of $2.80–$2.60, a proposal discussed with Hall and Plowden. He recommended devaluation by 4 September, but rejected the idea that currencies become fully convertible – in the way that John Maynard Keynes had advocated at the Bretton Woods Conference – as this might prevent governments protecting full employment. Dell argues that Gaitskell&#x27;s memo was full of the impatience of a young man at his elders clinging to office, but that on the other hand he himself had been slow to recognise the need for devaluation. Gaitskell and Wilson met with Attlee, Ernest Bevin and Cripps at Chequers on 19 August, and Bevin and Cripps agreed with some reluctance to devaluation. The decision was finally confirmed by the Cabinet on 9 August, although Cripps rejected Gaitskell&#x27;s plan for a floating band. Devaluation (from $4.03 to $2.80) was announced on Sunday 18 September after a secret Cabinet meeting the day before. Many other countries followed suit, so it was mainly UK trade with dollar-using countries which was affected.

Gaitskell had initially been suspicious of devaluation because it was a price mechanism, but earned the admiration of Robert Hall over this crisis. He accepted the need for spending cuts to help make devaluation work and keep to keep the Americans happy, and thought former chancellor Dalton &quot;rather dishonest&quot; for arguing at the Economic Policy Committee that cuts were not necessary. Cripps, who had implied in his devaluation broadcast that devaluation was an &quot;alternative&quot; to cuts, threatened to resign unless cuts of £300m were agreed; Aneurin Bevan (Minister of Health) in turn threatened to resign as did A.V. Alexander (Minister of Defence). In the event most of the cuts were to future spending plans except for Bevan&#x27;s housing budget.

=== Minister for Economic Affairs ===
In January 1950 Gaitskell submitted a paper called &quot;Control and Liberalisation&quot; to the Economic Policy Committee, which he was sometimes invited to attend. He wrote that &quot;On &#x27;liberalisation&#x27; we have gone about far enough. But we have done it for political reasons – US and Europe&quot;. He was opposed to the convertibility of currencies and non-discrimination between trading partners, both policies which the US favoured. Britain still preferred to encourage trade in pounds sterling within the Commonwealth, and Gaitskell wanted to preserve Britain&#x27;s ability to avoid downturns like the US downturn of 1948–9, which Britain had largely escaped because of devaluation.

In the February 1950 General Election the Government were re-elected with a tiny majority. In the ensuing reshuffle Gaitskell was appointed Minister for Economic Affairs, effectively Deputy Chancellor but still outside the Cabinet. He was made a full member of the Economic Policy Committee. Soon after his promotion he recorded that he often had to stiffen up Cripps, who was not as tough as his public image would suggest, to make sure he did not make too many concessions in negotiations with colleagues.

The level of spending on the new NHS was already running far in excess of predictions. In November 1949, with the high level of public spending already a problem and under pressure from Cripps, Bevan had pushed an act through Parliament granting the government the power to impose prescription charges, although they were not brought in just yet (Cripps had wanted 1 shilling per prescription, but Bevan had not agreed to this). In the 1949–50 financial year Cripps had allowed £90m of extra health service spending (&quot;supplementaries&quot;). Early in 1950 Cripps backed off from a plan to introduce further charges, this time on false teeth and spectacles, after Bevan threatened to resign, but Gaitskell was put on a committee to monitor Bevan&#x27;s agreement to a ceiling on NHS spending. The Treasury wanted health spending capped at £350m per annum, although it was willing to accept £392m for 1950–1.

There was already friction between Gaitskell and Bevan. At one meeting, probably 28 June 1950, Bevan had been about to walk out of the room until Attlee called him back. Bevan stopped attending Cripps&#x27; Thursday night dinners for economics ministers. After one of those dinners Bevan&#x27;s old ally John Strachey, now Minister of Food, rebuked him for attacking Gaitskell, whom he thought &quot;one of the really considerable men of the Government&quot;, a suggestion to which Bevan responded with derision, calling him &quot;nothing, nothing, nothing&quot;.

=== Rearmament and European Payments Union ===
By the second half of 1950 the western powers were caught up in a major rearmament drive. The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 at first threatened US loss of South Korea (which was seen as vital for the defence of Japan), and by the autumn threatened to escalate into a general war between the US and Communist China. There were also very real worries that the Soviets might invade western Europe (which was unarmed, with strong communist influence in many countries) and that the US would not help Britain if she did not help herself. The crushing of democracy in Czechoslovakia had been as recent as 1948. In August 1950 the British defence budget was hiked from £2.3bn to £3.6bn (a total over a three-year period); at this stage it had appeared that the US would be willing to help foot the bill.

In September 1950 inflationary pressure was worsened when the TUC voted to end the existing two-year wage freeze, although there was no wage explosion just yet. It was difficult for the Treasury to take tough measures given the government&#x27;s small majority and the likelihood of another election soon.

Gaitskell thought balance of payments problems should be solved not by realignments of currencies but by asking surplus countries like the US and Belgium to inflate their economies (so they would import more). He was attacked for this by the US Secretary of the Treasury John Wesley Snyder and Camille Gutt (former Belgian finance minister and now managing director of the IMF). Dell argues that Gaitskell did not realise that other countries had their own domestic problems. In September 1950, with Britain&#x27;s balance of payments now in surplus, Gaitskell negotiated British membership of the European Payments Union, meaning that instead of bilateral clearing, European currencies were to be convertible against one another even if not against the US dollar. Previously dollars had been needed for trade within Europe. Until then Gaitskell had shared concerns that some countries might stay in permanent deficit and thus effectively use their neighbours for free borrowing, or conversely that Belgium&#x27;s surplus would enable her to suck gold and dollars from Britain. The EPU lasted until sterling was made convertible in 1958.

Although Gaitskell had until recently thought Bevan an inevitable future leader for the Labour Party, by the 1950 Party Conference (2 October) &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; political correspondent guessed correctly that he and Gaitskell were already fighting a proxy battle for the future leadership.

=== Promotion to the Chancellorship ===
Cripps, whose health was still failing, had notified Attlee of his intention to resign as Chancellor of the Exchequer on 26 April 1950. He attempted to resign in the summer but was dissuaded by Gaitskell and Plowden because of the outbreak of the Korean War. He instead went on a long holiday, leaving Gaitskell in charge.

It was now becoming clear that the US Congress was reluctant to help Britain meet the cost of rearmament. Gaitskell visited Washington in October 1950, his first visit there, just before becoming Chancellor. He warned that the terms of trade were shifting against Britain, and of the costs of rearmament.

In October 1950 Cripps finally resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Dalton proposed Gaitskell for the vacancy. Sir Edward Bridges wanted Herbert Morrison, a political heavyweight; Morrison had been an early advocate of devaluation but did not regard himself as qualified. Gaitskell was appointed at the young age of 44, especially unusual as most of Attlee&#x27;s Cabinet were in their sixties or older. He became the Chancellor with the shortest Parliamentary apprenticeship since Pitt the Younger in 1782. As Chancellor of the Exchequer he retained the same control over economic planning which Cripps had had. Both Cripps and Gaitskell insisted that Gaitskell be listed after Attlee, Bevin and Morrison in the official Cabinet pecking order.

Bevan was furious at Gaitskell being promoted over him, even though, as Gaitskell correctly guessed in his diary, he probably did not want the job himself. Gaitskell recorded that Bevan often asserted that Cripps had promised him the Exchequer.

The US Chiefs of Staff wanted an even greater increase in the British armaments budget to £6bn over three years, a plan backed by the British Chiefs of Staff and urged on Prime Minister Attlee on his visit to the US in Dec 1950. On his return from Washington Attlee told the House of Commons on 29 January 1951 that the defence budget was to be hiked to £4.7bn over the next three-year period, including a fourfold increase in munitions production. The defence budget was to increase from 8% to 14% of GNP, a proportion exceeded only by the US amongst NATO members. At the peak 2.5m people, 11% of the workforce, would be engaged in defence work.

== Chancellor of the Exchequer, 1950–51 ==

=== Economic philosophy ===
On his appointment, Gaitskell told William Armstrong, his Principal Private Secretary, that the main job over next few years would be the redistribution of wealth.

Rab Butler and Samuel Brittan, both writing in the early 1970s, commented that Gaitskell was the most technically qualified chancellor of the 20th century up until that date. However, Dell comments that he often went into excessive detail, including personally overseeing economic forecasts, and held excessively long meetings. This may have been from a love of micro-management or because, as an advocate of controls and planning, he was suspicious of treasury officials, whom he thought excessively inclined to free market mechanisms.

In December 1950, Gaitskell rejected the advice of Kim Cobbold (Governor of the Bank of England) and Hall that interest rates be raised, calling such a policy &quot;completely antiquated&quot;.

=== Cost of rearmament ===
Marshall Aid, which had totalled $3.1bn over previous three years, ended officially on 1 January 1951, although in practice it had ended six weeks earlier. It was held that the balance of payments was now strong enough for it no longer to be necessary. Harold Wilson (President of the Board of Trade) and George Strauss (Minister of Supply) warned Gaitskell that the burden of rearmament was too much for the shortage of raw materials and manufacturing capacity, but Gaitskell ignored them as they were friends of Bevan. On 27 January 1951 Bevan was reshuffled to the Ministry of Labour with Health, now under Hilary Marquand, downgraded to a non-Cabinet appointment. Gaitskell welcomed the changes as reducing an obstacle to economies in health spending.

Gaitskell still favoured discrimination in favour of sterling trade and was opposed to sterling convertibility but was now a lot more pro-American since his October 1950 visit to Washington. By February 1951 he was strongly critical of anti-Americanism in cabinet.

Bevan&#x27;s Commons speech on 15 February 1951 defended the extra £4.7bn on armaments, although most of it was a warning not to rearm too fast and that communism would be defeated through democratic socialism and not through arms. The following day Gaitskell recorded his regret that for all Bevan&#x27;s brilliance in oratory he should be &quot;a difficult team worker, and some would say even worse – a thoroughly unreliable and disloyal colleague.&quot;

=== Budget ===
Gaitskell made the controversial decision to introduce charges for prescription glasses and dentures on the National Health Service in his spring 1951 budget. The Cabinet had agreed in principle in February 1951 to charges on teeth and spectacles. For 1951-2 Bevan was demanding £422m of health spending, whereas Gaitskell was willing to allow £400m. Gaitskell wanted to pass on half the cost of false teeth and spectacles, to bring in £13m in 1951-2 and £23m in a full year. Children, the poor and the sick were to be exempt. On 9 March Ernest Bevin was moved from the Foreign Office, dying a month later. Bevan, who had hoped to succeed him, was passed over for promotion to a major job for the second time in six months. By this point other ministers felt that Bevan was looking for an issue on which to resign, and that it was pointless making too many concessions as he needed to be made to appear to be in the wrong.

In addition, Purchase Tax was increased from 33% to 66% on certain luxury items such as cars, television sets and domestic appliances, while entertainment tax was increased on cinema tickets. At the same time, however, taxation on profits was raised and pensions increased to compensate pensioners for a rise in the cost of living, while the allowances for dependent children payable to widows, the unemployed and the sick, together with marriage and child allowances, were also increased. In addition a number of small items were removed from purchase tax, and the amount of earnings allowed without affecting the state pension was increased from 20 shillings (£1) to 40 shillings (£2) a week. Besides taxing the better off and protecting pensions, Gaitskell actually increased NHS spending. The budget increased defence spending by £500m to £1.5bn for 1951–2, helped by a surplus inherited from Cripps and optimistic growth forecasts. Plans to introduce capital-gains tax were postponed until 1952.

Prime Minister Attlee&#x27;s initial reaction to the draft budget was that there were not likely to be many votes in it. Gaitskell replied that he could not expect votes in a rearmament year. Ernest Bevin did not like the idea of health charges and tried in vain to negotiate a compromise. Education Minister George Tomlinson suggested a repetition of the previous year&#x27;s formula, a spending ceiling of £400m. Gaitskell was prepared to offer a delay in the introduction of charges but rejected the Tomlinson formula despite Attlee&#x27;s urgings, since the ceiling could not be achieved without charges. Attlee went into hospital to be treated for a duodenal ulcer on 21 March. From his sickbed he wrote what Kenneth O. Morgan calls a &quot;remarkably vacuous letter&quot;, which &quot;dealt with none of the substantive points at issue&quot;. At a Cabinet meeting on 22 March Gaitskell was dissuaded from his original intention to insist on prescription charges since they might fall heavily on the genuinely sick.

=== Bevan&#x27;s resignation ===
Gaitskell and Attlee warned of risks that the rearmament programme might not be fully implemented. Gaitskell warned the Economic Policy Committee (3 April 1951) of the shortage of machine tools, and stated that some could be imported from the US but that this would weaken the balance of payments.

A very angry Bevan saw the charges as a blow to the principle of a free health service, telling a heckler while he was making a speech in Bermondsey (3 April 1951) that he would resign rather than accept health charges. Gaitskell, besides the obvious need for a new Chancellor to assert his authority, saw this as a deliberate attempt to bounce the Cabinet publicly, telling Dalton that Bevan&#x27;s &quot;influence was very much exaggerated&quot; and that he might split the Labour Party as Lloyd George had the Liberals.

In two long Cabinet meetings on 9 April Bevan found himself supported only by Harold Wilson. Herbert Morrison, who was chairing the Cabinet whilst Attlee was being treated in hospital, again proposed a compromise that there be an agreed ceiling on public spending but no NHS charges. Gaitskell was determined that there would not be an open-ended commitment to welfare spending at the expense of economic investment or rearmament, and rejected Morrison&#x27;s proposal. At the second meeting, Gaitskell threatened to resign, but quietly and without a public fuss, if he did not have the backing of the Cabinet; the resignation of the Chancellor on the eve of the budget would have caused a political crisis. Douglas Jay and others attempted in vain to persuade Gaitskell to compromise, but he refused, arguing that two members of the Cabinet should not be allowed to dictate to eighteen, although he agreed not to specify just yet the date at which the charges would come into effect. A final attempt by Attlee to negotiate a compromise from his sickbed (10 April) came to nothing. The affair brought Gaitskell close to physical and emotional collapse.

Gaitskell won the admiration of Treasury officials for his stance: on the morning of the budget Sir Edward Bridges came to tell him of the respect he had earned in the department and that it was &quot;the best day we have had in the Treasury for ten years&quot;. Gaitskell recorded that Bridges, Plowden, Leslie (Head of Information) and Armstrong were all urging him to stand firm and that he was &quot;overcome with emotion&quot; at Armstrong&#x27;s words.

Gaitskell&#x27;s budget was praised at the time. His predecessor Stafford Cripps wrote to him praising him for not giving in to &quot;political expediency&quot;, whilst he was supported in public by two younger MPs later to be staunch allies, Roy Jenkins and Anthony Crosland. After the budget Tony Benn, who was on the right of the Labour Party at that time, recorded the atmosphere at the party meeting (i.e. a meeting of Labour MPs) on 11 April as &quot;sheer relief&quot; that it had not been worse; the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) strongly supported the budget. However, Bevan soon rejected Gaitskell&#x27;s proposed compromise that it be announced that the health charges were not to be permanent as &quot;a bromide&quot;. Bevan&#x27;s ally Michael Foot wrote an editorial in &quot;Tribune&quot; comparing Gaitskell to Philip Snowden (the Chancellor whose cuts in 1931 had brought down the Second Labour Government, after which he and other leading members of the Cabinet entered into the Tory-dominated National Government). Bevan resigned on 21 April, as did Harold Wilson and John Freeman.

Gaitskell defended his budget at the party meeting on 24 April. He said it was still too early to tell if the rearmament programme was actually achievable. Benn commented after the meeting on how Gaitskell&#x27;s greatness arose from his combination of &quot;intellectual ability and political forcefulness&quot;. Bevan then made an angry speech which did not impress many of the PLP.

=== Analysis ===
Edmund Dell argues that neither Bevan nor Gaitskell emerge with much credit from the affair. &quot;Gaitskell was obsessed by Bevan and by the need to establish his authority over him&quot;. Charges on false teeth and spectacles were &quot;insignificant&quot; in the context of the greater budget and &quot;financially were neither here nor there&quot; ... but Bevan was &quot;impatient and arrogant and noisy and apparently intent on exhausting the tolerance of his cabinet colleagues&quot;. Gaitskell agreed to limit health charges to three years (subject to Parliament voting to extend them), made concessions on pensions to the Trade Union Group of MPs, and a diary entry suggests he was not happy about dividend constraints – yet he was not prepared to make significant concessions to Bevan. However, Dell argues that all chancellors have to make sticking points or they would have to give in to everybody. Gaitskell saw himself as defending the country and wanted to prove Labour a &quot;responsible party of government&quot;, but the public were not yet aware of the looming inflation problem. Gaitskell told George Brown in 1960: &quot;It was a battle between us for power – he knew it and so did I&quot;.

John Campbell agrees that Bevan may have been partly right that Gaitskell, abetted by Morrison, was deliberately trying to drive him out of the Cabinet. Gaitskell believed that Labour had to be seen to govern with fiscal responsibility, telling Dalton on 4 May 1951 that he and Bevan were engaged in a battle for the soul of the Labour Party, and that if Bevan won Labour would be out for many years (although, ironically, Gaitskell won but they were out of power for many years anyway). Had Attlee not been sick, he might have been able to patch up a compromise.

Historian Brian Brivati believes that the importance of the charges was &quot;irrelevant&quot; to the huge cost of rearmament, which damaged Britain&#x27;s recovery in the years which followed by absorbing earnings from exports.

=== Aftermath ===
A £300m surplus in the British balance of payments in 1950 turned into a £400m deficit in 1951, the most sudden reversal on record up until that time. This was caused partly by businesses switching to rearmament rather than generating exports. The other reason was a deterioration in the terms of trade: higher oil prices after the Iranian oil crisis caused an outflow of dollars, whilst prices of wool, tin and rubber fell so the rest of the sterling area was not earning so many dollars from exports. By the second half of 1951 the overseas sterling area was importing from North America at double the 1950 rate. By 1951 inflation was beginning to increase, the government budget surplus had disappeared, and in another sign of an overheating economy unemployment was down to 1945 levels. By the second half of 1951 Gaitskell was worried about the political effect of the higher cost of living, but the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and &quot;The Economist&quot; accused him of using higher prices to choke off consumption and free up resources for rearmament instead of consumer goods production.

Gaitskell again rejected Treasury advice to raise interest rates to cool the economy in June, July and August 1951. He argued that higher interest rates would be perceived as generating profits for the banks, which would not sit well with trade unions, and he was only prepared to consider demanding that the banks restrict credit. Gaitskell (diary 10 August 1951) stated that he and Morrison thought that Attlee had been too weak in dealing with Bevan. By August–September 1951 the Treasury were taken by surprise by a full-on sterling crisis, which they passed on to the incoming Conservative Government. Sterling was trading unofficially at $2.40, below the official rate of $2.80.

Gaitskell visited Washington in the autumn of 1951, where he thought US Treasury Secretary John Wesley Snyder &quot;a pretty small-minded, small town, semi-isolationist&quot;. A committee was formed, containing Plowden and Averell Harriman, to investigate the way in which US rearmament was absorbing and pushing up the prices of world raw materials. Gaitskell was horrified by Attlee&#x27;s calling an election (19 September 1951) when he and Morrison were in North America. If Attlee had held on for another six or nine months Labour might have won. Labour lost the October 1951 General Election despite getting more votes than the Conservatives. Whilst the Bevanites blamed defeat on Morrison&#x27;s policy of &quot;consolidation&quot;, the right blamed Bevan for causing a split. Nobody imagined Labour would be out of power for more than a few years, and Attlee expected to be Prime Minister again by 1953.

When the Conservatives returned to power, the new chancellor Rab Butler would get the balance of payments back into surplus in 1952 by cutting overseas spending, a measure which Dell suggests Gaitskell had not wanted to irritate the Americans by taking. In his memoirs (&quot;Art of the Possible&quot;, p. 163) Butler later called him &quot;a political mouse who, confronted with a gigantic deterioration in the balance of payments, responded by cutting a sliver off the cheese ration&quot;. After the Conservatives cut the armament plans in 1952 Crosland told people that Gaitskell had made him look like &quot;a complete idiot&quot; for supporting the budget in public. However, even by the end of 1951 there was less likelihood of the Korean War turning into a general war (the front line had stabilised, with the US administration being clear that they did not wish to escalate hostilities against China), so any government might have pared back defence spending in 1952.

== Opposition: the Bevanite split 1951–55 ==

=== 1951–52 ===
In opposition, Gaitskell&#x27;s house at Frognal Gardens, Hampstead, became a centre for political intrigue. At first Herbert Morrison still seemed likely to succeed Attlee as leader. This period was characterised by factional infighting between the &#x27;Bevanite&#x27; left of the Labour party led by Aneurin Bevan, whose strength lay mainly in the constituency Labour Parties (&quot;CLP&quot;s) and the &#x27;Gaitskellite&#x27; right who had the upper hand in the Parliamentary Party (Labour MPs – known collectively as the &quot;PLP&quot;).

In February 1952 Bevan led a rebellion of 56 other Labour MPs to vote against the Conservatives&#x27; defence spending plans (the official Labour position was to abstain). Dalton recorded (11 March) that Gaitskell was, behind the scenes, keen for a showdown with Bevan. At the party meeting Bevan refused to agree to toe the party line, but the issue was defused by a conciliatory motion by the centrist &quot;Keep Calm&quot; group, passed against the wishes of the platform. Bevan at this time thought that Gaitskell should be reduced to &quot;a junior clerk&quot; in the next Labour Government. On 1 August 1952, when Gaitskell had succeeded in putting Churchill (Prime Minister at the time) on the ropes in a House of Commons debate, Bevan intervened to attack Gaitskell, an event greeted with Tory relief and according to Crossman &quot;icy silence&quot; on the Labour benches.

Dalton (30 September 1952) thought the Morecambe Party Conference &quot;the worst ... for bad temper and general hatred, since 1926&quot; whilst Michael Foot thought it &quot;rowdy, convulsive, vulgar, splenetic&quot;. A series of left-wing motions were passed. Bevanites took over the constituency section of Labour&#x27;s National Executive Committee (the &quot;NEC&quot;): Bevan, Barbara Castle, Tom Driberg, Ian Mikardo and Harold Wilson took the top five places with Crossman seventh. Veteran right-wingers such as Herbert Morrison and Hugh Dalton were voted off, with Jim Griffiths in sixth place the only member of the Old Guard to survive; Shinwell, who as Minister of Defence was seen as responsible for the rearmament programme, had been voted off the previous year.

In a speech at Stalybridge (5 October 1952) Gaitskell alleged that &quot;about one-sixth&quot; of the constituency delegates &quot;appeared to be Communist or Communist-inspired&quot; and attacked &quot;the stream of grossly misleading propaganda with poisonous innuendos and malicious attacks on Attlee, Morrison and the rest of us&quot; published in &quot;Tribune&quot;. He claimed that Labour was threatened by &quot;mob rule&quot; got up by &quot;frustrated journalists&quot; (a number of Bevanites, including Michael Foot and Tom Driberg, were journalists). He received strong backing from the TGWU whose block vote was of immense importance at the Labour Conference and which was able to exert pressure on its sponsored MPs to toe the party line.

Attlee then gave a speech at the newly built Royal Festival Hall demanding an end to groups within the party. After the PLP voted 188–51 to ban such groups Bevan insisted, over the wishes of Foot and Crossman, that the Bevanite group be disbanded. The Shadow Cabinet elections (elected by Labour MPs when the party was in opposition) were topped by Jim Griffiths and Chuter Ede. Gaitskell was in third place with 179 votes. Bevan, who had just challenged Morrison unsuccessfully for the Deputy Leadership, scraped on in twelfth and last place with 108 votes.

=== 1953–54 ===
Tony Benn wrote of Gaitskell (24 September 1953) &quot;he is intellectually arrogant, obstinate and patronising. I respect – but cannot quite admire – him&quot;.

Relations between Bevan and Gaitskell continued to be acrimonious. On one occasion in 1953, when Gaitskell called for unity at a Shadow Cabinet meeting, Bevan was observed to give him &quot;a glare of concentrated hatred&quot; and declared: &quot;You&#x27;re too young in the movement to know what you&#x27;re talking about&quot;. Bevan resigned from the Shadow Cabinet in April 1954 over Labour&#x27;s support for the setting-up of SEATO.

Bevan stood against Gaitskell for Party Treasurer, knowing he would likely lose but hoping to discredit union bosses Arthur Deakin and Tom Williamson in the eyes of rank-and-file trade union members. In the event even Sam Watson, leader of Bevan&#x27;s own miners&#x27; union, supported Gaitskell. Gaitskell won by 4.3 million votes to 2 million. Bevan gave a speech to the &quot;Tribune&quot; party at the conference, declaring that the Labour Leader needed to be a &quot;desiccated calculating machine&quot;. He was widely and probably wrongly thought to be referring to Gaitskell, to whom the label stuck. In fact it may well have been aimed at Attlee who had the previous day warned against &quot;emotionalism&quot; whilst privately Bevan thought that Gaitskell was highly emotional and, as he had shown in 1951, &quot;couldn&#x27;t count&quot;. The Treasurership election was seen as particularly important as it was lining up a successor to Attlee, whose retirement was clearly fairly imminent.

=== 1955 ===
In March 1955 Bevan, who had given no hint of disagreement with party policy at the party meeting a few days earlier, now challenged Attlee in a House of Commons debate to demand terms for use of the new H-Bomb in return for Labour&#x27;s support for the weapon. He and 62 other abstained in the vote, leading to demands from loyalists that the party whip be withdrawn from him as a preliminary to him being formally expelled from the Labour Party by the NEC.

Writing a few days later, Gaitskell claimed to have felt that &quot;sooner or later [Bevan] would have to go, but I was not sure whether this was the right moment&quot; (19 March). However, Gaitskell told an audience at Doncaster that Bevan had made &quot;a direct challenge to the elected Leader of our Party&quot; and accused him of not being a team player. At a party meeting a few days later (16 March) Bevan accused Gaitskell of having told a direct lie against him and declared that it was &quot;those hatchet-faced men sitting on the platform&quot; who were undermining the leadership. After a lukewarm summing up by Attlee the PLP voted by 114–112 to withdraw the whip from Bevan.

Gaitskell felt he had to follow the lead of the unions and pushed for Bevan&#x27;s expulsion, telling Crossman (24 March) that Ian Mikardo was running a Bevanite organisation in the constituency parties to make Bevan leader. When Crossman interjected that Bevan &quot;was only half wanting&quot; to be leader, had not made any conspiracy against Attlee and was mainly concerned at voicing protests against Morrison and Gaitskell, the latter replied that &quot;there are extraordinary parallels between Nye and Adolf Hitler. They are demagogues of exactly the same sort ... There are minor differences but what is striking is the resemblance&quot;. Summoned to appear before an NEC sub-committee, Bevan refused to be &quot;cornered by Gaitskell&quot;. In the event Gaitskell intervened only once at the meeting, asking Bevan to give a pledge that he would not attack the leader – Bevan refused as it was &quot;a trap&quot;. Bevan&#x27;s apology for his rebellion over the H-Bomb was accepted. Gaitskell described the result (2 April) as &quot;a stalemate ... my own position is no doubt weaker&quot;. Gaitskell thought the need to move against Bevan &quot;dirty work&quot; (April 1955).

The May 1955 General Election was the first since 1931 in which Labour&#x27;s vote had not increased. In &quot;Tribune&quot; on 21 June 1955 Gaitskell poured scorn on the idea that more left-wing policies (or, as he put it, policies more similar to those of the Communist Party) would have won Labour more votes. Campbell argues that &quot;history overwhelmingly supports&quot; Gaitskell&#x27;s argument that elections are won by appealing to the centre ground rather than to a party&#x27;s core base, tempting as the latter strategy often is to parties in opposition.

At the Margate conference that autumn Gaitskell gave a stirring and well-received speech including an apparently unscripted passage stressing his own socialist credentials and arguing that nationalisation was still a &quot;vital means&quot; to achieving that end. Bevan was observed to be watching the speech &quot;red-faced and furious&quot; and complaining of Gaitskell&#x27;s &quot;sheer demagogy&quot;. In October 1955 Gaitskell was re-elected Party Treasurer by a wider margin over Bevan than the previous year.

The apparent congruence between Gaitskell&#x27;s economic policies and those of his Conservative successor as chancellor Rab Butler, who had retained and extended NHS charges, was sometimes labelled &quot;Butskellism&quot; by the press. This view was not shared by Gaitskell himself, and after Butler&#x27;s emergency &quot;Pots and Pans&quot; budget in October 1955, in which he reversed tax cuts made prior to the Conservatives&#x27; re-election at the general election earlier that year, he attacked him strongly for allegedly having misled the electorate. Gaitskell won further praise for his attacks on Butler.

==Party leader==
Following the retirement of Attlee as leader in December 1955, Gaitskell stood for party leader against Bevan and the ageing Herbert Morrison. At that time (and until 1981) the Labour Party leader was elected solely by MPs. In a final effort to stave off an inevitable Gaitskell victory, Bevan proposed that he and Gaitskell both withdraw in Morrison&#x27;s favour, but Gaitskell rejected the offer. Gaitskell comfortably defeated Bevan (Morrison came a poor third) in the party leadership contest. Chuter Ede described the leadership election as &quot;the political funeral of two of the greatest publicity mongers I&#x27;ve ever known,&quot; adding that Gaitskell had never actively sought publicity.

Gaitskell told a friend that &quot;The leadership came to me so early because Bevan threw it at me by his behaviour&quot;, a view shared by Attlee and Harold Wilson. Gaitskell was very inexperienced for a party leader by the standards of the time. He offered Bevan a public olive branch at the party meeting after the result, promising that he would &quot;not be outdone in generosity&quot; if Bevan accepted the vote. Bevan agreed to do so, wishing Gaitskell &quot;higher office&quot;.

Brivati writes that Gaitskell&#x27;s 1951–55 &quot;political performance ... has not received the credit it deserves, for energy, for strategy and for sheer nerve&quot;.

== Leader of the Opposition, 1955–1963 ==
=== Suez ===
In 1956 the Egyptian ruler Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalised the Suez Canal Company, beginning the Suez Crisis. Gaitskell initially told the Prime Minister, Sir Anthony Eden, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer Harold Macmillan at a dinner with King Faisal II of Iraq on 26 July 1956, that they would have the support of public opinion for the use of military action against Nasser, but warned Eden that he must act quickly and would have to keep the Americans closely informed. Gaitskell denounced Nasser&#x27;s action at 11am on 27 July in the House of Commons debate.

Gaitskell&#x27;s position became more cautious during the summer, and he suggested the dispute with Egypt should be referred to the United Nations. His first speech on Suez (2 August 1956) attacked Nasser and was welcomed by many Conservatives, and implied that he would support the use of force, but in Brivati&#x27;s view did not give enough emphasis to his stipulation that it be done through the United Nations. He had believed Eden&#x27;s assurances that he had no intention of using force. In two letters to Eden sent on 3 and 10 August Gaitskell condemned Nasser, but warned that he would not support any action that violated the United Nations charter. In his letter of 10 August, Gaitskell wrote: &quot;Lest there should be any doubt in your mind about my personal attitude, let me say that I could not regard an armed attack on Egypt by ourselves and the French as justified by anything which Nasser has done so far or as consistent with the Charter of the United Nations. Nor, in my opinion, would such an attack be justified in order to impose a system of international control over the canal – desirable though this is. If, of course, the whole matter were to be taken to the United Nations and if Egypt were to be condemned by them as aggressors, then, of course, the position would be different. And if further action which amounted to obvious aggression by Egypt were taken by Nasser, then again it would be different. So far what Nasser has done amounts to a threat, a grave threat to us and to others, which certainly cannot be ignored; but it is only a threat, not in my opinion justifying retaliation by war.&quot;

Gaitskell passionately condemned the eventual Anglo-French military intervention to secure the Suez Canal, supposedly launched to enforce international law and to separate the Egyptian and Israeli combatants; the Israeli attack had in fact been launched in collusion with the British and French to supply a pretext for the invasion. On 31 October he publicly called the invasion &quot;an act of disastrous folly&quot; which threatened the Atlantic Alliance, the United Nations and Commonwealth solidarity. On 4 November 1956 Gaitskell gave a powerful broadcast, attacking the Prime Minister now it was clear Eden had been lying to him in private. Gaitskell was accused by the Conservatives of trying to appeal to the Labour Left, and of betrayal.

Gaitskell&#x27;s stance on Suez attracted some Liberal support. The pollster Mark Abrams convinced him of the need to broaden Labour&#x27;s appeal by picking up anti-colonialist votes, but this would be a development of longer-term importance to the Labour Party. At the time Gaitskell was much-criticised in the press, especially for his ill-judged and unsuccessful plea for Tory dissidents to remove Eden from power. The Conservatives not only attacked Gaitskell as unpatriotic for failing to support British troops in action, but also tried to exploit perceived differences between Gaitskell and Bevan, who had rejoined the Shadow Cabinet earlier in the year and who had now been promoted to Shadow Foreign Secretary. Crossman noted that this forced Bevan to be loyal to Gaitskell (15 December 1956), making the two men allies of a kind.

=== Nationalisation and political philosophy ===
Gaitskell was a consensual leader in 1955–59, in contrast to his earlier and later image. Labour was widely expected to win the next general election and in Campbell&#x27;s view he arguably did not give a clear enough lead or attack the Conservatives aggressively enough.

Gaitskell had initially believed nationalisation to be both morally right and economically efficient, and hoped in vain that manager-worker relations would be transformed. But in 1956 he published a Fabian pamphlet &quot;Socialism and Nationalisation&quot; (actually written three years earlier), arguing that there was no need for greater public ownership, and that his goals were full employment, industrial democracy and a greater spread of economic power. Gaitskell still supported physical controls and his views were a little to the left of those expressed by Anthony Crosland in &quot;The Future of Socialism&quot; (1956).

Gaitskell&#x27;s political philosophy became known as Gaitskellism, and from the late 1950s brought him into increasing conflict with the trade unions over nationalisation. Besides repudiating the unquestioned commitment to public ownership of the means of production, now seen as merely one of numerous useful devices, he emphasised the goals of personal liberty, social welfare and above all social equality. Gaitskellism tended to downplay loyalty to the Labour movement as a central ethical goal, and argued that the new goals could be achieved if the government used appropriate fiscal and social policy measures within the context of a market-oriented mixed economy. Gaitskell&#x27;s cadre of supporters included Anthony Crosland, Roy Jenkins, Douglas Jay, Patrick Gordon Walker and James Callaghan.

Frank Cousins became General Secretary of the TGWU in 1956, beginning the process whereby the unions began to shift left. The 1957 Conference endorsed the document &quot;Industry and Society&quot;, which called for more flexibility, including state purchase of shares in small private firms. This was loudly condemned by Bevan&#x27;s wife Jennie Lee and by Michael Foot, editor of &quot;Tribune&quot; but out of Parliament at the time.

=== 1959 general election ===
In the summer of 1959 Bevan supported Gaitskell on the NEC against Frank Cousins over unilateralism, which Bevan had opposed at the 1957 Conference, and nuclear tests (24 June 1959). Crossman believed Bevan could have overthrown Gaitskell (17 July 1959) and that both Bevan and Gaitskell thought Wilson an unprincipled careerist (13 August 1959). In the summer of 1959 Hugh and Dora Gaitskell, accompanied by Bevan, went to the USSR to copy Macmillan&#x27;s recent successful trip.

At Newcastle, with a general election clearly imminent, Gaitskell pledged that Labour&#x27;s spending plans would not require him to raise income tax, for which he was attacked by the Tories for supposed irresponsibility.

During the 1959 election campaign Crossman thought Gaitskell had become &quot;a television star&quot; with Bevan &quot;a rather faded elder statesman behind him&quot; (22 September 1959). The Labour Party had been widely expected to win the 1959 general election, but did not. The Conservatives increased their majority, a fact partly attributable to the post-war prosperity that Britain was now experiencing. Gaitskell was undermined by public doubts about the credibility of proposals to raise pensions and by a highly effective Conservative campaign run by Harold Macmillan under the slogan &quot;Life is better with the Conservatives, don&#x27;t let Labour ruin it.&quot; This election defeat led to questions being asked as to whether Labour could ever win a general election again, but Gaitskell remained as leader.

=== Clause IV ===
Following the election defeat, bitter internecine disputes resumed. Gaitskell blamed the Left for the defeat and attempted unsuccessfully to amend Labour&#x27;s Clause IV—which its adherents believed committed the party to further nationalisation of industry, while Gaitskell and his followers believed it had become either superfluous or a political liability.

On the Tuesday after the election Gaitskell lunched &quot;bibulously&quot; with Bevan at Asheridge in the Chilterns to discuss his plans for party reform. At this time he had no plans to revise Clause IV. He told Crossman (19 October) that Bevan simply wanted to succeed Jim Griffiths as deputy leader and had shown no inclination to resist moderate policies. After initially expressing surprise, Gaitskell accepted Crossman&#x27;s advice that Bevan be allowed a veto over any change to nationalisation policy.

The November 1959 Conference, postponed because of the election, was already divided by rumours that Gaitskell was planning action over Clause IV. Ignoring advice from his allies, and partly motivated by detailed polling by Mark Abrams which showed that younger voters regarded Labour as old-fashioned, Gaitskell pushed for reform. Brivati writes that Clause IV was irrelevant in practice but Gaitskell had made &quot;a frontal assault on ... a Labour equivalent of the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England&quot;.

Bevan saw Gaitskell&#x27;s speech in advance and made no objection to it at the time. Gaitskell did not rule out further nationalisation, but saw it as a means to an end, pouring scorn on the idea that Labour should be committed to nationalising &quot;the whole of light industry, the whole of agriculture, all the shops, every little pub and garage&quot;. Bevan now claimed he had &quot;misunderstood or misheard&quot; what Gaitskell planned and was reported to be &quot;absolutely livid&quot; and &quot;wondering whether to blow the whole thing wide open&quot;. In the end he made a conciliatory speech, mentioning that Barbara Castle (who had attacked Gaitskell&#x27;s proposal) and Gaitskell had both quoted his own dictum that Socialism was about controlling the &quot;commanding heights&quot; of the economy. He argued that according to the principles of Euclid if two things are equal to a third thing they must both be equal to one another, and so there could not be any real difference between Castle and Gaitskell.

Benn wrote (28 November 1959): &quot;Nye&#x27;s speech this afternoon was witty, scintillating, positive, conciliatory – the model of what a Leader should do. He didn&#x27;t knock Hugh out but he gently elbowed him aside&quot;. The cartoonist &quot;Vicky&quot; showed Gaitskell pedalling to Blackpool on a tandem with Bevan behind him – then pedalling back again but this time with Bevan in the front saddle (30 November 1959).

There was much talk that Bevan might now seize the party leadership, but it seems unlikely that he had the stomach for this anymore, not least as he had never wanted to be leader solely for its own sake. Gaitskell could no longer afford to quarrel with his deputy, and he enjoyed a position of great influence as keeper of the party&#x27;s conscience, similar to, but much more powerful than, the position of John Prescott relative to Tony Blair forty years later. Moreover, by the end of 1959 Bevan was seriously unwell; he withdrew from the public eye and died in July 1960.

In March 1960 the NEC agreed a new statement of Labour&#x27;s aims as an addition to Clause IV rather than a replacement. Throughout the summer of 1960 union conferences, many of whose rule books had their own equivalent to Clause IV, were hostile to the new proposal, and in the end four of the six largest unions opposed Gaitskell&#x27;s plans. The new proposal was demoted to a &quot;valuable expression&quot;.

=== Unilateral disarmament ===
Unilateral nuclear disarmament was increasingly popular amongst union activists and was also debated in several union conferences in the spring and summer of 1960. The great majority of the PLP supported NATO and multilateral disarmament.

Gaitskell took on Frank Cousins and wanted to show that Labour were a party of government, not just of opposition. At the October 1960 Scarborough Conference two resolutions in favour of unilateral disarmament – proposed by the TGWU and the Engineers&#x27; Union – were carried, whilst the official policy document on defence was rejected. Gaitskell roused his supporters by promising to &quot;Fight and Fight and Fight Again&quot; to reverse the decision. Labour doctrine was that the Parliamentary Party had discretion over the timing of implementation of conference policy. In practice, in the 1940s and &#x27;50s, the unions, whose block votes dominated conference, had been broadly supportive of the PLP, but this was now beginning to change. Gaitskell was challenged unsuccessfully for the leadership by Harold Wilson in November 1960.

The Blackpool Conference of October 1961 saw a narrow conference vote in favour of &quot;multi&quot;lateral disarmament. Winning the unilateralism vote in 1961 restored Gaitskell&#x27;s authority in the party and his reputation in the country. Unilateral nuclear disarmament remained a divisive issue, and many on the Left continued to call for a change of leadership. Gaitskell was again challenged unsuccessfully for the Labour leadership in November 1961, this time by Anthony Greenwood.

The Campaign for Democratic Socialism was founded to promote the Gaitskellite cause – it never acquired much influence in the ranks of the trades unions, but achieved some success in promoting the selection of friendly Parliamentary candidates. Many of the younger CDS members would later be among the founding members of the breakaway Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1981.

Richard Hamilton with his wife, Terry Hamilton, both supporters of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, collaborated to produce &quot;Portrait of Hugh Gaitskell as a Famous Monster of Filmland&quot;, 1964, with Richard completing the piece in 1964 after Terry&#x27;s death in 1962. Arts Council England bought the piece for the national collection, which caused controversy. The painting was considered a tasteless attack. Hamilton stated in his posthumously published autobiography (written in the third person):

=== EEC entry ===

Gaitskell alienated some of his supporters by his opposition to British membership of the European Economic Community, which Conservative Prime Minister Macmillan had been seeking since July 1961. Although not entirely opposed in principle to British entry, he believed that the EEC was resistant to reform and that membership would hurt Britain&#x27;s relations with the Commonwealth.

In a speech to the party conference in October 1962, Gaitskell argued that if the aim was for Britain to participate in a Federal Europe, this would mean &quot;the end of Britain as an independent European state, the end of a thousand years of history!&quot; He added: &quot;You may say, all right! Let it end! But, my goodness, it&#x27;s a decision that needs a little care and thought.&quot;

In the speech Gaitskell summoned up the memory of Vimy Ridge and Gallipoli, where Canadian and ANZAC troops had fought alongside British, mixing his defence of national identity with the tradition of the Commonwealth. The speech dismayed many of Gaitskell&#x27;s natural supporters but was applauded by many on the Left, causing his wife Dora to observe &quot;all the wrong people are cheering&quot;.

== Death ==
In mid-December 1962, Gaitskell fell ill with flu, but he was declared well enough by his doctor to travel to the Soviet Union, where he met the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev for talks. Upon his return to Britain his condition deteriorated after he contracted another virus. On 4 January 1963 he was admitted to Middlesex Hospital in Marylebone, where, despite efforts by doctors to save his life, he died on 18 January, with his wife at his bedside. He had died from complications following a sudden flare-up of lupus, an autoimmune disease, which had affected his heart and kidneys. He was 56. Gaitskell&#x27;s body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 23 January 1963. His ashes are buried in the churchyard of St John-at-Hampstead Church, north London. His wife died in 1989 and was buried alongside him.

Gaitskell had inherited £14,000 (around £800,000 at 2015 prices) from an aunt in April 1938, which was invested for him by a friend in the City and multiplied several times (at a time of relatively high inflation). Gaitskell appears to have largely ignored this sum of capital, and his wife had no idea of his wealth. His estate was valued for probate at £80,013-10s-0d on 23 April 1963 (around £1.7m at 2020 prices).

The shock of Gaitskell&#x27;s death was comparable to that of the sudden death of the later Labour Party leader John Smith in May 1994, when he too seemed to be on the threshold of Number 10.

Beginning with his time as a minister under Attlee, Gaitskell kept a diary until 1956. The diary is an important primary source for the politics of the era.

===Conspiracy theories===
Gaitskell&#x27;s death left an opening for Harold Wilson in the party leadership; Wilson narrowly won the next general election for Labour 21 months later. The abrupt and unexpected nature of Gaitskell&#x27;s death led to some speculation that foul play might have been involved. The most popular conspiracy theory involved a supposed Soviet KGB plot to ensure that Wilson (alleged by the supporters of these theories to be a KGB agent himself) became prime minister. This claim was given new life by Peter Wright&#x27;s controversial 1987 book &quot;Spycatcher&quot;, but the only evidence that ever came to light was the testimony of a Soviet defector, Anatoliy Golitsyn. MI5 repeatedly investigated Wilson over the course of several years before conclusively deciding that he had no relationship with the KGB.

== Legacy ==
=== Gaitskellites and after ===
Gaitskell was adored by followers like Roy Jenkins, who thought him a beacon of hope, decency and integrity, especially as Wilson&#x27;s government came more and more to seem one of shabby compromises. Left-wingers like Barbara Castle loathed him for his intransigence. Many, including Tony Benn – a Labour centrist at the time – simply thought him a divisive figure and initially welcomed Wilson as a fresh start who could unite the party. In the event Wilson&#x27;s closest allies as Prime Minister – Crossman and Castle – were former Bevanites.

However, many of the Gaitskellites held leading positions in Harold Wilson&#x27;s Cabinet of 1964–70. Many of them – e.g. Roy Jenkins and Bill Rodgers but not Anthony Crosland or Douglas Jay – became supporters of British membership of the EEC, an issue on which Labour was split in the 1970s and which helped to precipitate the SDP split of 1981.

John Campbell writes that &quot;the echoes of the Gaitskell-Bevan rivalry continued to divide the party right up to the 1980s&quot;. Neil Kinnock (Labour Leader 1983–92) grew up in South Wales and was brought up as an admirer of Bevan, but although he disliked the comparison his battle with the hard-left Militant tendency in the mid-1980s had echoes of Gaitskellism; John Smith (Labour Leader 1992–4) had been a Gaitskellite as a young man in the early 1960s; Tony Blair&#x27;s first act as leader in 1994 was finally to abolish Clause IV – for this and other acts he was supported by the elderly Roy Jenkins, who had become a Liberal Democrat by then. Like Gaitskell before him, Blair was often seen by many of his enemies in the Labour Party as a public-school educated, middle-class interloper.

Tony Benn contrasted Gaitskell&#x27;s stand on the Suez Crisis to that of the former British Prime Minister Tony Blair on the war in Iraq. Margaret Thatcher compared Blair with Gaitskell in a different manner, warning her party when Blair came to power that he was the most formidable Labour leader since Hugh Gaitskell.

=== Assessments ===
Gaitskell&#x27;s socialism was, in Campbell&#x27;s view, that of a public servant wanting to see the world more rationally governed. Gaitskell very likely might have become Prime Minister had he lived; however, he left no lasting monument other than &quot;the fading memory of promise unfulfilled&quot;. Gaitskell, although no Marxist, was a sincere socialist but nonetheless was in some respects the first &quot;moderniser&quot; who saw how Labour would have to adapt to survive.

His longtime close friend Roy Jenkins concluded a decade afterwards, in an article which he later quoted in his memoirs:
:All his struggles illustrated some blemishes as well as exceptional strength. He would not have been a perfect prime minister. He was stubborn, rash, and could in a paradoxical way become too emotionally committed to an over-rational position which, once he had thought it rigorously through, he believed must be the final answer. He was only a moderately good judge of people. But when these faults are put in the scales and weighed against his qualities they shrivel away. He had purpose and direction, courage and humanity. He was a man for raising the sights of politics. He clashed on great issues. He avoided the petty bitterness of personal jealousy. You could raise a banner which men were proud to follow, but he never perverted his leadership ability; it was infused by sense and humour, and by a desire to change the world, not for his own satisfaction, but so that people might more enjoy living in it... He was that very rare phenomenon, a great politician who was also an unusually agreeable man.

Because he never became prime minister, and because of the great capacity many considered that he had for the post, Hugh Gaitskell is remembered largely with respect from people both within and outside of the Labour Party. Gaitskell is regarded by some as &quot;the best Prime Minister we never had&quot;.

Brivati acknowledged that he had &quot;an almost reckless honesty and courage&quot; which could turn into stubbornness. &quot;His leadership was a heroic failure&quot; and &quot;The defining moment of the post-war history of the Labour Party&quot;. Although by 1963 Gaitskell appeared to be on the verge of leading Labour back into power, it still took what Brivati describes as &quot;the greatest performance by a leader of the opposition [last] century&quot; for Harold Wilson to lead Labour back by a narrow majority.

Brivati writes that for Gaitskell &quot;socialism was not an end state ... but the reform of institutions and practices for the more effective realisation of preferred values&quot;. Evan Durbin&#x27;s &quot;Politics of Democratic Socialism&quot; (1940) was a seminal text. Gaitskell was not, in Brivati&#x27;s view, a &quot;progressive&quot; in any modern sense. He favoured equality and thought the free market wasteful. He wanted to incorporate Liberal opinion within the Labour vote. However, the modernising leaders of subsequent generations, Neil Kinnock and Tony Blair, were to a certain extent continuing Gaitskell&#x27;s tradition.

=== Memorials ===

His name appears in popular culture from time to time. For example Hugh Gaitskell House is the building Nicholas Lyndhurst&#x27;s character, Garry Sparrow, is looking for in &quot;Goodnight Sweetheart&quot; when he first stumbles into Second World War London. A tower block of that name can be found opposite Stoke Newington railway station in North London.

Hugh Gaitskell Primary School is situated in Beeston, part of his former Leeds South constituency. The area is now in the Leeds Central constituency, represented by Hilary Benn.

In 1978, some 15 years after his death, a new housing development by Sandwell council in the Tividale area of the West Midlands was named Gaitskell Terrace.

A portrait bust of Hugh Gaitskell was made by British sculptor Leslie Cubitt Bevis in 1964 and purchased by the National Portrait Gallery in 1967.

Gaitskell was buried in Hampstead, and a memorial plaque to his name is prominently placed in the cloisters of New College, Oxford.

<text>Radio navigation or radionavigation is the application of radio waves to determine a position of an object on the Earth, either the vessel or an obstruction. Like radiolocation, it is a type of radiodetermination.

The basic principles are measurements from/to electric beacons, especially
* Angular directions, e.g. by bearing, radio phases or interferometry,
* Distances, e.g. ranging by measurement of time of flight between one transmitter and multiple receivers or vice versa,
* Distance &quot;differences&quot; by measurement of times of arrival of signals from one transmitter to multiple receivers or vice versa
* Partly also velocity, e.g. by means of radio Doppler shift.

Combinations of these measurement principles also are important—e.g., many radars measure range and azimuth of a target.

==Bearing-measurement systems==
These systems used some form of directional radio antenna to determine the location of a broadcast station on the ground. Conventional navigation techniques are then used to take a radio fix. These were introduced prior to World War I, and remain in use today.

===Radio direction finding===

The first system of radio navigation was the &quot;Radio Direction Finder&quot;, or RDF. By tuning in a radio station and then using a directional antenna, one could determine the direction to the broadcasting antenna. A second measurement using another station was then taken. Using triangulation, the two directions can be plotted on a map where their intersection reveals the location of the navigator. Commercial AM radio stations can be used for this task due to their long range and high power, but strings of low-power radio beacons were also set up specifically for this task, especially near airports and harbours.

Early RDF systems normally used a loop antenna, a small loop of metal wire that is mounted so it can be rotated around a vertical axis. At most angles the loop has a fairly flat reception pattern, but when it is aligned perpendicular to the station the signal received on one side of the loop cancels the signal in the other, producing a sharp drop in reception known as the &quot;null&quot;. By rotating the loop and looking for the angle of the null, the relative bearing of the station can be determined. Loop antennas can be seen on most pre-1950s aircraft and ships.

===Reverse RDF===

The main problem with RDF is that it required a special antenna on the vehicle, which may not be easy to mount on smaller vehicles or single-crew aircraft. A smaller problem is that the accuracy of the system is based to a degree on the size of the antenna, but larger antennas would likewise make the installation more difficult.

During the era between World War I and World War II, a number of systems were introduced that placed the rotating antenna on the ground. As the antenna rotated through a fixed position, typically due north, the antenna was keyed with the morse code signal of the station&#x27;s identification letters so the receiver could ensure they were listening to the right station. Then they waited for the signal to either peak or disappear as the antenna briefly pointed in their direction. By timing the delay between the morse signal and the peak/null, then dividing by the known rotational rate of the station, the bearing of the station could be calculated.

The first such system was the German Telefunken Kompass Sender, which began operations in 1907 and was used operationally by the Zeppelin fleet until 1918. An improved version was introduced by the UK as the Orfordness Beacon in 1929 and used until the mid-1930s. A number of improved versions followed, replacing the mechanical motion of the antennas with phasing techniques that produced the same output pattern with no moving parts. One of the longest lasting examples was Sonne, which went into operation just before World War II and was used operationally under the name Consol until 1991. The modern VOR system is based on the same principles (see below).

=== ADF and NDB===

A great advance in the RDF technique was introduced in the form of phase comparisons of a signal as measured on two or more small antennas, or a single highly directional solenoid. These receivers were smaller, more accurate, and simpler to operate. Combined with the introduction of the transistor and integrated circuit, RDF systems were so reduced in size and complexity that they once again became quite common during the 1960s, and were known by the new name, automatic direction finder, or ADF.

This also led to a revival in the operation of simple radio beacons for use with these RDF systems, now referred to as &quot;non-directional beacons&quot; (NDB). As the LF/MF signals used by NDBs can follow the curvature of earth, NDB has a much greater range than VOR which travels only in &quot;line of sight&quot;. NDB can be categorized as &quot;long range&quot; or &quot;short range&quot; depending on their power. The frequency band allotted to non-directional beacons is 190–1750 kHz, but the same system can be used with any common AM-band commercial station.

===VOR===

VHF omnidirectional range, or VOR, is an implementation of the reverse-RDF system, but one that is more accurate and able to be completely automated.

The VOR station transmits two audio signals on a VHF carrier – one is Morse code at 1020 Hz to identify the station, the other is a continuous 9960 Hz audio modulated at 30 Hz, with the 0-degree referenced to magnetic north. This signal is rotated mechanically or electrically at 30 Hz, which appears as a 30 Hz AM signal added to the previous two signals, the phasing of which is dependent on the position of the aircraft relative to the VOR station.

The VOR signal is a single RF carrier that is demodulated into a composite audio signal composed of a 9960 Hz reference signal frequency modulated at 30 Hz, a 30 Hz AM reference signal, and a 1020 Hz &#x27;marker&#x27; signal for station identification. Conversion from this audio signal into a usable navigation aid is done by a navigation converter, which takes the reference signal and compares the phasing with the variable signal. The phase difference in degrees is provided to navigational displays. Station identification is by listening to the audio directly, as the 9960 Hz and 30 Hz signals are filtered out of the aircraft internal communication system, leaving only the 1020 Hz Morse-code station identification.

The system may be used with a compatible glideslope and marker beacon receiver, making the aircraft ILS-capable (Instrument Landing System)}. Once the aircraft&#x27;s approach is accurate (the aircraft is in the &quot;right place&quot;), the VOR receiver will be used on a different frequency to determine if the aircraft is pointed in the &quot;right direction.&quot; Some aircraft will usually employ two VOR receiver systems, one in VOR-only mode to determine &quot;right place&quot; and another in ILS mode in conjunction with a glideslope receiver to determine &quot;right direction.&quot; }The combination of both allows for a precision approach in foul weather.

==Beam systems==
Beam systems broadcast narrow signals in the sky, and navigation is accomplished by keeping the aircraft centred in the beam. A number of stations are used to create an airway, with the navigator tuning in different stations along the direction of travel. These systems were common in the era when electronics were large and expensive, as they placed minimum requirements on the receivers – they were simply voice radio sets tuned to the selected frequencies. However, they did not provide navigation outside of the beams, and were thus less flexible in use. The rapid miniaturization of electronics during and after World War II made systems like VOR practical, and most beam systems rapidly disappeared.

===Lorenz===

In the post-World War I era, the Lorenz company of Germany developed a means of projecting two narrow radio signals with a slight overlap in the center. By broadcasting different audio signals in the two beams, the receiver could position themselves very accurately down the centreline by listening to the signal in their headphones. The system was accurate to less than a degree in some forms.

Originally known as &quot;Ultrakurzwellen-Landefunkfeuer&quot; (LFF), or simply &quot;Leitstrahl&quot; (guiding beam), little money was available to develop a network of stations. The first widespread radio navigation network, using Low and Medium Frequencies, was instead led by the US (see LFF, below). Development was restarted in Germany in the 1930s as a short-range system deployed at airports as a blind landing aid. Although there was some interest in deploying a medium-range system like the US LFF, deployment had not yet started when the beam system was combined with the Orfordness timing concepts to produce the highly accurate Sonne system. In all of these roles, the system was generically known simply as a &quot;Lorenz beam&quot;. Lorenz was an early predecessor to the modern Instrument Landing System.

In the immediate pre-World War II era the same concept was also developed as a blind-bombing system. This used very large antennas to provide the required accuracy at long distances (over England), and very powerful transmitters. Two such beams were used, crossing over the target to triangulate it. Bombers would enter one of the beams and use it for guidance until they heard the second one in a second radio receiver, using that signal to time the dropping of their bombs. The system was highly accurate, and the &#x27;Battle of the Beams&#x27; broke out when United Kingdom intelligence services attempted, and then succeeded, in rendering the system useless through electronic warfare.

===Low-frequency radio range===
The low-frequency radio range (LFR, also &quot;Four Course Radio Range&quot; among other names) was the main navigation system used by aircraft for instrument flying in the 1930s and 1940s in the U.S. and other countries, until the advent of the VOR in the late 1940s. It was used for both en route navigation as well as instrument approaches.

The ground stations consisted of a set of four antennas that projected two overlapping directional figure-eight signal patterns at a 90-degree angle to each other. One of these patterns was &quot;keyed&quot; with the Morse code signal &quot;A&quot;, dit-dah, and the second pattern &quot;N&quot;, dah-dit. This created two opposed &quot;A&quot; quadrants and two opposed &quot;N&quot; quadrants around the station. The borders between these quadrants created four course legs or &quot;beams&quot; and if the pilot flew down these lines, the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;N&quot; signal merged into a steady &quot;on course&quot; tone and the pilot was &quot;on the beam&quot;. If the pilot deviated to either side the &quot;A&quot; or &quot;N&quot; tone would become louder and the pilot knew to make a correction. The beams were typically aligned with other stations to produce a set of airways, allowing an aircraft to travel from airport to airport by following a selected set of stations. Effective course accuracy was about three degrees, which near the station provided sufficient safety margins for instrument approaches down to low minimums. At its peak deployment, there were over 400 LFR stations in the US.

=== Glide path and the localizer of ILS ===
The remaining widely used beam systems are glide path and the localizer of the &quot;instrument landing system&quot; (ILS). ILS uses a &quot;localizer&quot; to provide horizontal position and &quot;glide path&quot; to provide vertical positioning. ILS can provide enough accuracy and redundancy to allow automated landings.

==Transponder systems==
Positions can be determined with any two measures of angle or distance. The introduction of radar in the 1930s provided a way to directly determine the distance to an object even at long distances. Navigation systems based on these concepts soon appeared, and remained in widespread use until recently. Today they are used primarily for aviation, although GPS has largely supplanted this role.

===Radar and transponders===
Early radar systems, like the UK&#x27;s Chain Home, consisted of large transmitters and separate receivers. The transmitter periodically sends out a short pulse of a powerful radio signal, which is sent into space through broadcast antennas. When the signal reflects off a target, some of that signal is reflected back in the direction of the station, where it is received. The received signal is a tiny fraction of the broadcast power, and has to be powerfully amplified in order to be used.

The same signals are also sent over local electrical wiring to the operator&#x27;s station, which is equipped with an oscilloscope. Electronics attached to the oscilloscope provides a signal that increases in voltage over a short period of time, a few microseconds. When sent to the X input of the oscilloscope, this causes a horizontal line to be displayed on the scope. This &quot;sweep&quot; is triggered by a signal tapped off the broadcaster, so the sweep begins when the pulse is sent. Amplified signals from the receiver are then sent to the Y input, where any received reflection causes the beam to move upward on the display. This causes a series of &quot;blips&quot; to appear along the horizontal axis, indicating reflected signals. By measuring the distance from the start of the sweep to the blip, which corresponds to the time between broadcast and reception, the distance to the object can be determined.

Soon after the introduction of radar, the radio transponder appeared. Transponders are a combination of receiver and transmitter whose operation is automated – upon reception of a particular signal, normally a pulse on a particular frequency, the transponder sends out a pulse in response, typically delayed by some very short time. Transponders were initially used as the basis for early IFF systems; aircraft with the proper transponder would appear on the display as part of the normal radar operation, but then the signal from the transponder would cause a second blip to appear a short time later. Single blips were enemies, double blips friendly.

Transponder-based distance-distance navigation systems have a significant advantage in terms of positional accuracy. Any radio signal spreads out over distance, forming the fan-like beams of the Lorenz signal, for instance. As the distance between the broadcaster and receiver grows, the area covered by the fan increases, decreasing the accuracy of location within it. In comparison, transponder-based systems measure the timing between two signals, and the accuracy of that measure is largely a function of the equipment and nothing else. This allows these systems to remain accurate over very long range.

The latest transponder systems (mode S) can also provide position information, possibly derived from GNSS, allowing for even more precise positioning of targets.

===Bombing systems===
The first distance-based navigation system was the German Y-Gerät blind-bombing system. This used a Lorenz beam for horizontal positioning, and a transponder for ranging. A ground-based system periodically sent out pulses which the airborne transponder returned. By measuring the total round-trip time on a radar&#x27;s oscilloscope, the aircraft&#x27;s range could be accurately determined even at very long ranges. An operator then relayed this information to the bomber crew over voice channels, and indicated when to drop the bombs.

The British introduced similar systems, notably the Oboe system. This used two stations in England that operated on different frequencies and allowed the aircraft to be triangulated in space. To ease pilot workload only one of these was used for navigation – prior to the mission a circle was drawn over the target from one of the stations, and the aircraft was directed to fly along this circle on instructions from the ground operator. The second station was used, as in Y-Gerät, to time the bomb drop. Unlike Y-Gerät, Oboe was deliberately built to offer very high accuracy, as good as 35 m, much better than even the best optical bombsights.

One problem with Oboe was that it allowed only one aircraft to be guided at a time. This was addressed in the later Gee-H system by placing the transponder on the ground and broadcaster in the aircraft. The signals were then examined on existing Gee display units in the aircraft (see below). Gee-H did not offer the accuracy of Oboe, but could be used by as many as 90 aircraft at once. This basic concept has formed the basis of most distance measuring navigation systems to this day.

===Beacons===

The key to the transponder concept is that it can be used with existing radar systems. The ASV radar introduced by RAF Coastal Command was designed to track down submarines and ships by displaying the signal from two antennas side by side and allowing the operator to compare their relative strength. Adding a ground-based transponder immediately turned the same display into a system able to guide the aircraft towards a transponder, or &quot;beacon&quot; in this role, with high accuracy.

The British put this concept to use in their Rebecca/Eureka system, where battery-powered &quot;Eureka&quot; transponders were triggered by airborne &quot;Rebecca&quot; radios and then displayed on ASV Mk. II radar sets. Eureka&#x27;s were provided to French resistance fighters, who used them to call in supply drops with high accuracy. The US quickly adopted the system for paratroop operations, dropping the Eureka with pathfinder forces or partisans, and then homing in on those signals to mark the drop zones.

The beacon system was widely used in the post-war era for blind bombing systems. Of particular note were systems used by the US Marines that allowed the signal to be delayed in such a way to offset the drop point. These systems allowed the troops at the front line to direct the aircraft to points in front of them, directing fire on the enemy. Beacons were widely used for temporary or mobile navigation as well, as the transponder systems were generally small and low-powered, able to be man portable or mounted on a Jeep.

===DME===
In the post-war era, a general navigation system using transponder-based systems was deployed as the distance measuring equipment (DME) system.

DME was identical to Gee-H in concept, but used new electronics to automatically measure the time delay and display it as a number, rather than having the operator time the signals manually on an oscilloscope. This led to the possibility that DME interrogation pulses from different aircraft might be confused, but this was solved by having each aircraft send out a different series of pulses which the ground-based transponder repeated back.

DME is almost always used in conjunction with VOR, and is normally co-located at a VOR station. This combination allows a single VOR/DME station to provide both angle and distance, and thereby provide a single-station fix. DME is also used as the distance-measuring basis for the military TACAN system, and their DME signals can be used by civilian receivers.

==Hyperbolic systems==

Hyperbolic navigation systems are a modified form of transponder systems which eliminate the need for an airborne transponder. The name refers to the fact that they do not produce a single distance or angle, but instead indicate a location along any number of hyperbolic lines in space. Two such measurements produces a fix. As these systems are almost always used with a specific navigational chart with the hyperbolic lines plotted on it, they generally reveal the receiver&#x27;s location directly, eliminating the need for manual triangulation. As these charts were digitized, they became the first true location-indication navigational systems, outputting the location of the receiver as latitude and longitude. Hyperbolic systems were introduced during World War II and remained the main long-range advanced navigation systems until GPS replaced them in the 1990s.

===Gee===

The first hyperbolic system to be developed was the British Gee system, developed during World War II. Gee used a series of transmitters sending out precisely timed signals, with the signals leaving the stations at fixed delays. An aircraft using Gee, RAF Bomber Command&#x27;s heavy bombers, examined the time of arrival on an oscilloscope at the navigator&#x27;s station. If the signal from two stations arrived at the same time, the aircraft must be an equal distance from both transmitters, allowing the navigator to determine a line of position on his chart of all the positions at that distance from both stations. More typically, the signal from one station would be received earlier than the other. The &quot;difference&quot; in timing between the two signals would reveal them to be along a curve of possible locations. By making similar measurements with other stations, additional lines of position can be produced, leading to a fix. Gee was accurate to about 165 yards (150 m) at short ranges, and up to a mile (1.6 km) at longer ranges over Germany. Gee remained in use long after World War II, and equipped RAF aircraft as late as the 1960s (approx freq was by then 68 MHz).

===LORAN===

With Gee entering operation in 1942, similar US efforts were seen to be superfluous. They turned their development efforts towards a much longer-ranged system based on the same principles, using much lower frequencies that allowed coverage across the Atlantic Ocean. The result was LORAN, for &quot;LOng-range Aid to Navigation&quot;. The downside to the long-wavelength approach was that accuracy was greatly reduced compared to the high-frequency Gee. LORAN was widely used during convoy operations in the late war period.

===Decca===

Another British system from the same era was Decca Navigator. This differed from Gee primarily in that the signals were not pulses delayed in time, but continuous signals delayed in phase. By comparing the phase of the two signals, the time difference information as Gee was returned. However, this was far easier to display; the system could output the phase angle to a pointer on a dial removing any need for visual interpretation. As the circuitry for driving this display was quite small, Decca systems normally used three such displays, allowing quick and accurate reading of multiple fixes. Decca found its greatest use post-war on ships, and remained in use into the 1990s.

===LORAN-C===

Almost immediately after the introduction of LORAN, in 1952 work started on a greatly improved version. LORAN-C (the original retroactively became LORAN-A) combined the techniques of pulse timing in Gee with the phase comparison of Decca.

The resulting system (operating in the low frequency (LF) radio spectrum from 90 to 110 kHz) that was both long-ranged (for 60 kW stations, up to 3400 miles) and accurate. To do this, LORAN-C sent a pulsed signal, but modulated the pulses with an AM signal within it. Gross positioning was determined using the same methods as Gee, locating the receiver within a wide area. Finer accuracy was then provided by measuring the phase difference of the signals, overlaying that second measure on the first. By 1962, high-power LORAN-C was in place in at least 15 countries.

LORAN-C was fairly complex to use, requiring a room of equipment to pull out the different signals. However, with the introduction of integrated circuits, this was quickly reduced further and further. By the late 1970s, LORAN-C units were the size of a stereo amplifier and were commonly found on almost all commercial ships as well as some larger aircraft. By the 1980s, this had been further reduced to the size of a conventional radio, and it became common even on pleasure boats and personal aircraft. It was the most popular navigation system in use through the 1980s and 90s, and its popularity led to many older systems being shut down, like Gee and Decca. However, like the beam systems before it, civilian use of LORAN-C was short-lived when GPS technology drove it from the market.

===Other hyperbolic systems===
Similar hyperbolic systems included the US global-wide VLF/Omega Navigation System, and the similar Alpha deployed by the USSR. These systems determined pulse timing not by comparison of two signals, but by comparison of a single signal with a local atomic clock. The expensive-to-maintain Omega system was shut down in 1997 as the US military migrated to using GPS. Alpha is still in use.

==Satellite navigation==
Since the 1960s, navigation has increasingly moved to satellite navigation systems. These are essentially hyperbolic systems whose transmitters are in orbits. That the satellites move with respect to the receiver requires that the calculation of the positions of the satellites must be taken into account, which can only be handled effectively with a computer.

Satellite navigation systems send several signals that are used to decode the satellite&#x27;s position, distance between the user satellite, and the user&#x27;s precise time. One signal encodes the satellite&#x27;s &quot;ephemeris&quot; data, which is used to accurately calculate the satellite&#x27;s location at any time. Space weather and other effects causes the orbit to change over time so the ephemeris has to be updated periodically. Other signals send out the time as measured by the satellite&#x27;s onboard atomic clock. By measuring signal times of arrival (TOAs) from at least four satellites, the user&#x27;s receiver can re-build an accurate clock signal of its own and allows hyperbolic navigation to be carried out.

Satellite navigation systems offer better accuracy than any land-based system, are available at almost all locations on the Earth, can be implemented (receiver-side) at modest cost and complexity, with modern electronics, and require only a few dozen satellites to provide worldwide coverage. As a result of these advantages, satellite navigation has led to almost all previous systems falling from use. LORAN, Omega, Decca, Consol and many other systems disappeared during the 1990s and 2000s. The only other systems still in use are aviation aids, which are also being turned off for long-range navigation while new differential GPS systems are being deployed to provide the local accuracy needed for blind landings.

<doc id="153098" wikidata="Q9659166" url="?curid=153098" title="Blithfield Hall">
<text>Blithfield Hall (pronounced locally as Bliffield), is a privately owned Grade I listed country house in Staffordshire, England, situated some east of Stafford, southwest of Uttoxeter and north of Rugeley.

The Hall, with its embattled towers and walls, has been the home of the Bagot family since the late 14th century. The present house is mainly Elizabethan, with a neo-Gothic façade added in the 1820s to a design probably by John Buckler. The decoration of the house was carried out by the Gothic-style plasterer, Francis Bernasconi.

In 1945 the Hall, then in a neglected and dilapidated state, was sold by Gerald Bagot, 5th Baron Bagot, together with its estate to South Staffordshire Waterworks Company, whose intention was to build a reservoir (completed in 1953). The 5th Baron died in 1946 having sold many of the contents of the house. His successor and cousin Caryl Bagot, 6th Baron Bagot, repurchased the property and of land from the water company and began an extensive programme of renovation and restoration.

In September 1959 Lord Bagot sold Blithfield Hall at an open auction held in the Shrewsbury Arms, Rugeley. The property was bought for £12,000 (&quot;2011: £&quot;) by his wife Nancy, Lady Bagot.

The 6th Baron died in 1961. In 1986, the Hall was divided into four separate houses. The main part which incorporates the Great Hall is owned by the Bagot Jewitt Trust. The Bagot Jewitt family remain in residence.

On a Monday in early September every year, villagers from nearby Abbots Bromley visit the Hall to perform the Abbots Bromley Horn Dance.

Blithfield Hall is known as the home of a breed of goat, the Bagot goat. The part of the parish known as Bagot&#x27;s Bromley took its name from ownership by the family since 1360. Bagot&#x27;s Wood, the remains of the ancient Needwood Forest, also takes its name from the Bagots.

<text>In group theory, the normal closure of a subset formula_1 of a group formula_2 is the smallest normal subgroup of formula_2 containing formula_4

== Properties and description ==

Formally, if formula_2 is a group and formula_1 is a subset of formula_7 the normal closure formula_8 of formula_1 is the intersection of all normal subgroups of formula_2 containing formula_1:
formula_12

The normal closure formula_8 is the smallest normal subgroup of formula_2 containing formula_15 in the sense that formula_8 is a subset of every normal subgroup of formula_2 that contains formula_4

The subgroup formula_8 is generated by the set formula_20 of all conjugates of elements of formula_1 in formula_22

Therefore one can also write
formula_23

Any normal subgroup is equal to its normal closure. The conjugate closure of the empty set formula_24 is the trivial subgroup.

A variety of other notations are used for the normal closure in the literature, including formula_25 formula_26 formula_27 and formula_28

Dual to the concept of normal closure is that of or , defined as the join of all normal subgroups contained in formula_4

== Group presentations ==

For a group formula_2 given by a presentation formula_31 with generators formula_1 and defining relators formula_33 the presentation notation means that formula_2 is the quotient group formula_35 where formula_36 is a free group on formula_4

<text>José Luis Alberto Muñoz Marín (February 18, 1898April 30, 1980) was a Puerto Rican journalist, politician, statesman and was the first elected governor of Puerto Rico, regarded as the &quot;Architect of the Puerto Rico Commonwealth.&quot;
In 1948 he was the first democratically elected governor of Puerto Rico, spearheading an administration that engineered profound economic, political and social reforms; accomplishments that were internationally lauded by many politicians, statesmen, political scientists and economists of the period. Muñoz Marín was instrumental in the suppression of the Nationalist Party and its efforts to gain independence.

==Early life and education==

===Childhood===
Luis Muñoz Marín was born on February 18, 1898, at 152 Calle de la Fortaleza in Old San Juan. He was the son of Luis Muñoz Rivera and Amalia Marín Castilla. His father was a poet, publisher, and a politician, responsible for founding two newspapers, &quot;El Diario&quot; and &quot;La Democracia.&quot; Days before Luis&#x27; birth, his father traveled to Spain to present a proposal of autonomy for Puerto Rico, which was accepted. His father was elected to serve as Secretary of State of Puerto Rico and Chief of the Cabinet for the Government of Puerto Rico.

On October 18, 1898, Puerto Rico was taken by the United States following Spain&#x27;s defeat in the Spanish–American War. Luis&#x27;s father assisted in establishing an insular police force, but opposed the military colonial government established by the United States. He resigned from office on February 4, 1899, but was later elected to the House of Delegates of Puerto Rico.

One of Muñoz Marín&#x27;s paternal great-grandfathers, Luis Muñoz Iglesias, was born on October 12, 1797, in Palencia, Spain. At age 14, he had joined the Spanish Army and battled Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s French Army in the Peninsular War. Afterward he decided to make his career in the army, and was awarded decorations after fighting against Simón Bolívar during the Admirable Campaign of independence in Latin America. Once the conflict was over, he traveled to Puerto Rico along with his commanding officer, Miguel de la Torre. He subsequently settled in a farm in Cidra and married María Escolástica Barrios. One of his great-grandmothers was Rosa Solá, a woman held in slavery by his great grandfather, Vicente Marín.

In 1901 when Muñoz Marín was three years old, a group of statehood supporters broke into his father&#x27;s &quot;El Diario&#x27;s&quot; building and vandalized most of the equipment. Following this incident, the family moved to Caguas. After receiving further threats from the statehood movements, the family moved to New York City. There Muñoz Marín learned English, while his father founded the bilingual newspaper, &quot;Puerto Rico Herald&quot;. During the following years, the family frequently traveled between both locations. His father founded the Unionist Party in Puerto Rico, which won the election in 1904. Following the party&#x27;s victory, his father was elected as a member of the House of Delegates.

Muñoz Marín began his elementary education at William Penn Public School in Santurce, a district of San Juan. Most classes were taught in English, a change imposed by the American colonial government. Muñoz Marín&#x27;s knowledge of English allowed him to be advanced to second grade, although he had some difficulty the next year. In 1908, Muñoz Marín was enrolled in a small private school in San Juan. Working with the teacher Pedro Moczó, in two years he covered all the material normally taught to students between third and eighth grade, passing tests with good grades.

In 1910, his father was elected as Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico. This position is a non-voting delegate to the United States Congress. 

In 1911, he began his studies at the Georgetown Preparatory School but disliked its strict discipline and failed the tenth grade. In 1915, his father enrolled him at Georgetown University Law Center, but Muñoz Marín was uninterested and wanted to become a poet.

In late 1916, Muñoz Marín and his mother were called to Puerto Rico by their friend Eduardo Georgetti, who said Luis&#x27; father was suffering from an infection spreading from his gallbladder. Muñoz Rivera died on November 15, 1916, when Luis was eighteen.

===Poetry and ideological contrasts===
A month later Muñoz Marín and his mother returned to New York; he sold his law books and refused to return to Georgetown. Within one month he published a book titled &quot;Borrones&quot;, composed of several stories and a one-act play. For several months, he served as the congressional clerk to Félix Córdova Dávila, who succeeded Muñoz Marín&#x27;s father as Resident Commissioner.

==Marriage and family==
On July 1, 1919, Muñoz Marín married Muna Lee, an American writer from Raymond, Mississippi, who had grown up in Oklahoma. Lee was a leading Southern feminist and a rising writer of Pan-American poetry. They had a daughter and a son together, but often lived apart before separating in 1938.

During the 1920s Muñoz Marín spent the majority of his time in Greenwich Village, where he lived apart from his wife and young children. During those years he often asked his wife and mother to send him money, and indulged in a &quot;Bohemian lifestyle&quot; that strained his marriage. Muñoz Marín and his wife Muna Lee underwent a legal separation in 1938.

During his first campaign for the Puerto Rico Senate in 1932, Muñoz Marín was accused of being a narcotics addict; he was alleged to be addicted to opium.

Before his campaigns of 1938 and 1939, while he was still legally married, Muñoz Marín met Inés Mendoza. A teacher, she became his mistress and was fired for complaining about the prohibition against classes in Spanish. They agreed that substituting &quot;one language for another is to diminish that country&#x27;s capacity to be happy&quot;. Muñoz Marín asked Mendoza to &quot;stay with him all his life.&quot;

In 1940, a month after his election as President of the Senate in Puerto Rico, Muñoz Marín and Mendoza had a daughter, Victoria, named to commemorate his success. He and Mendoza officially married in 1946, and they had a second daughter, Viviana.

In the 1980s, their daughter Victoria Muñoz Mendoza became active in Puerto Rican politics. In 1992, she became the first woman to run as a candidate for the governorship of Puerto Rico.

==Formation of political ideas==
In 1920, Muñoz Marín was selected to deliver a check to Santiago Iglesias, the president of the Socialist Party of Puerto Rico. Excited about the prospect of meeting him, they moved to Puerto Rico, where the couple&#x27;s first daughter, Munita, was born. Upon arriving, he noticed that some of the landowners were paying the &quot;jíbaros&quot;, the mountain-dwelling peasants of Puerto Rico, two dollars in exchange for their votes. He joined the Socialist Party, a decision regarded as a &quot;disaster&quot; by his family. In October 1920, the Socialist Party recruited members of the Republican Party in order to win upcoming elections. Disappointed, Muñoz Marín returned to the mainland, moving to New Jersey with his family. Shortly after, his first son, Luis Muñoz Lee, was born.

In 1923, he returned alone to Puerto Rico, supposedly to publish a book that collected several of his father&#x27;s previously unpublished works. After collecting $5,000 from his father&#x27;s friends for this alleged &quot;publication&quot; Muñoz Marín spent the money, did not write the book, and quickly left the island. Several years later, after things had quieted down, Antonio R. Barceló, who was the president of the newly formed Liberal Party, called Muñoz Marín to work on &quot;La Democracia&quot;. After having problems with some members of the party&#x27;s Republican faction, due to his support for island autonomy, Muñoz Marín returned to New York. Here he wrote for &quot;The American Mercury&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot;.

In 1931, after traveling throughout the United States, Muñoz Marín noticed the instability of the country&#x27;s economy — and his own personal finances — after the stock market crash. Deciding that exploiting his father&#x27;s name in Puerto Rican politics was better than starving in Greenwich Village, he borrowed money from a group of friends and returned to the island. Upon arriving, he discovered that Hurricane San Felipe Segundo had destroyed most of the sugar crops where the &quot;jíbaros&quot; worked, leaving the majority unemployed.

==Political career==

===Senator===
By the 1930s, Puerto Rico&#x27;s political scenario had changed; the only party actively asking for independence was the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. That organization&#x27;s president, Pedro Albizu Campos, occasionally met with Muñoz Marín. He was impressed by the substance of Albizu&#x27;s arguments, but their styles to achieve autonomy and social reforms were different.

In 1932, Antonio R. Barceló abandoned the Coalition, which by this time had weakened, and he worked to establish a new independence movement. Barceló adopted several of Muñoz Marín&#x27;s ideas of social and economic reforms and autonomy, using them to form the ideology of the Liberal Party of Puerto Rico. Muñoz Marín joined the Liberal Party and led &quot;La Democracia&quot;, which had become the party&#x27;s official newspaper. He had decided to become a politician to achieve reform. In speeches, he discussed ways to provide more land, hospitals, food and schools to the general public.

On March 13, 1932, Muñoz Marín was nominated by the party for the post of senator. Although the party did not win a majority in the 1932 elections, Muñoz Marín received enough votes to gain a position in the Puerto Rican Senate. Shortly after, Rudy Black, a reporter for &quot;La Democracia&quot;, arranged a meeting between him and Eleanor Roosevelt. Wanting her to see Puerto Rico&#x27;s problems personally, he persuaded her to visit the main island.

In August 1932, Muñoz Marín received Eleanor Roosevelt in Fort San Felipe del Morro and &quot;La Fortaleza&quot; before traveling to &quot;El Fanguito&quot;, a poor sector that had suffered much damage in the hurricane. When photos of her visit were published, former American governors and the incumbent were outraged to have been overlooked. Following his wife&#x27;s report, Franklin D. Roosevelt included Puerto Rico in the New Deal program. Muñoz Marín became a popular political figure due to his involvement in the program, which provided for considerable investment of federal funds in Puerto Rico to develop infrastructure and housing.

Following the government police massacre of Nationalist protesters at the University of Puerto Rico in Río Piedras in 1935 (the Río Piedras massacre) and again at Ponce in 1937, the US Senator Millard Tydings from Maryland supported a bill in 1936 to give independence to Puerto Rico. (He had co-sponsored the Tydings–McDuffie Act, which provided independence to the Philippines after a 10-year transition under a limited autonomy.) All the Puerto Rican parties supported the bill, but Muñoz Marín opposed it. Tydings did not gain passage of the bill.

Muñoz Marín criticized the bill for what he said would be adverse effects on the island&#x27;s economy. He compared it to a principle known as &quot;Ley de Fuga&quot; (Law of flight). This was the term for a police officer arresting a man, releasing him, and shooting him in the back while the policeman retreated, claiming the suspect had &quot;fled.&quot;

As a result of his opposition to the bill and disagreement with Antonio R. Barceló, Muñoz Marín was expelled from the Liberal Party. Muñoz Marín&#x27;s expulsion severely affected his public image.

He created a group named &quot;Acción Social Independentista&quot; (&quot;ASI&quot;) (&quot;Pro-Independence Social Action&quot;) which later became the &quot;Partido Liberal Neto, Auténtico y Completo&quot;. This organization served as opposition to the Liberal Party, which was led by Barceló.

Along with many liberal democratic administrators from the New Deal relief organization known as the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (PRRA), in 1938, Muñoz Marín helped create the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico (&quot;Partido Popular Democratico&quot;, or PPD). The party committed to helping the &quot;jíbaros&quot;, regardless of their political beliefs, by promoting a minimum wage, initiatives to provide food and water, cooperatives to work with agriculture, and the creation of more industrial alternatives. Muñoz Marín concentrated his political campaigning in the rural areas of Puerto Rico. He attacked the then common practice of paying off rural farm workers to influence their vote, insisting that they &quot;lend&quot; their vote for only one election. The party&#x27;s first rally attracted solid participation, which surprised the other parties.

===President of the Senate===

In 1940, the Popular Democratic Party won a majority in the Senate of Puerto Rico, which was attributed to his campaigning in the rural areas, he first gave a speech in Dorado, Puerto Rico in the balcony of a house owned by electrician Luis Pérez Álvarez, in 1947. Muñoz Marín was elected as the fourth President of the Senate.

During his term as President of the Senate, Muñoz was an advocate of the working class of Puerto Rico. Along with Governor Rexford Tugwell, the last non-Puerto Rican US-appointed Governor, and the republican-socialist coalition which headed the House of Representatives, Muñoz helped advance legislation for agricultural reform, economic recovery, and industrialization. This program became known as Operation Bootstrap. It was coupled with a program of agrarian reform (land redistribution) which limited the area to be held by large sugarcane interests. During the first four decades of the 20th century, Puerto Rico&#x27;s dominant economic commodity had been sugarcane by-products.

Operation Bootstrap encouraged investors to transfer or create manufacturing plants, offering them local and federal tax concessions, while maintaining access to American markets free of import duties. The program facilitated a shift to an industrial economy. During the 1950s, labor-intensive light industries were developed on the island, such as textiles; manufacturing later gave way to heavy industry, such as petrochemicals and oil refining, in the 1960s and 1970s. Taught in Spanish, &quot;jíbaros&quot; were trained to work in jobs being promoted by the government. Muñoz Marín backed legislation to limit the amount of land a company could own. His development programs brought some prosperity for an emergent middle class. A rural agricultural society was transformed into an industrial working class. Muñoz Marín also launched &quot;Operación Serenidad&quot; (&quot;Operation Serenity&quot;), a series of projects geared toward promoting education and appreciation of the arts.

Civil rights groups and the Catholic Church criticized Operation Bootstrap, for what they saw as government-promoted birth control, encouragement of surgical sterilization, and fostering the migration of Puerto Ricans to the United States mainland. In 1943 Puerto Rico would pass a would ended a great deal of race-related discrimination in Puerto Rico. In 1945, Eric Williams would acknowledge the progress in civil rights in Puerto Rico at the time, conceding that despite some issues related to class discrimination, &quot;The Negro enjoys equality with the white man politically as well as legally,&quot; and that even opponents of Muñoz Marín &quot;agree that he and his party have given Negroes a square deal and opened positions to them, especially in the teaching profession and the higher ranks of the police force, from which they were conventionally debarred.&quot;

===World War II===

During the early stages of World War II, many thousands of Puerto Ricans were drafted to serve in the United States Army. This eased problems of overpopulation in the main island. Muñoz Marín promoted the construction of public housing projects to resolve a housing shortage. During the war he established low-interest scholarships and loans for the residents who were not drafted. To address health issues, he established free public clinics, which opened throughout Puerto Rico. In 1943 Puerto Rico would pass a Civil Rights Act.

In 1944 the Popular Democratic Party won a majority again in the election, repeating the political victory of the previous elections. In 1947, Congress approved legislation allowing Puerto Ricans to elect their own Governor. Muñoz Marín successfully campaigned for the post and was the first democratically elected Governor of Puerto Rico and the second Puerto Rican to serve in that post.

===Passage of Law 53 (the Gag Law)===

In 1948, the Puerto Rican Senate passed Law 53, also known as the Gag Law, which would restrain the rights of the independence and Nationalist movements in the island. Marin was instrumental in the passage of this law as he was in control of the Senate at the time. The passage of the law allowed him to arrest any suspected nationalist without cause or due process and so allowed him to squash any potential question to his authority.

The &quot;Ley de la Mordaza&quot; (a gag law) passed the legislature on May 21, 1948, and was signed into law on June 10, 1948, by the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Jesús T. Piñero. It closely resembled the anti-communist Smith Act passed in the United States, and was perceived as an effort to suppress opposition to the PPD and the independence movement.

Under this law it became a crime to own or display a Puerto Rican flag anywhere, even in one&#x27;s own home. It also became a crime to speak against the U.S. government; to speak in favor of Puerto Rican independence; to print, publish, sell or exhibit any material intended to paralyze or destroy the insular government; or to organize any society, group or assembly of people with a similar destructive intent. Anyone accused and found guilty of disobeying the law could be sentenced to ten years&#x27; imprisonment, a fine of $10,000 (US), or both.

According to Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa, a member of the &quot;Partido Estadista Puertorriqueño&quot; (Puerto Rican Statehood Party) and the only non-member of PPD in the Puerto Rican House, the law was repressive and in direct violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech. Figueroa pointed out that every Puerto Rican was born with full citizenship, and full U.S. constitutional protections.

Muñoz Marín used Law 53 to arrest thousands of Puerto Ricans without due process – including members of other political parties, and people who did not vote for him.

===Governor===
Muñoz Marín officially took office on January 2, 1949. He held the post of Governor for sixteen years, being re-elected again in 1952, 1956 and 1960. In 1957, Muñoz Marín was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree (LL.D.) from Bates College.

Having made progress on illiteracy and other social problems, the party began debating how to establish an autonomous government. Muñoz Marín and his officials agreed to adopt a &quot;Free Associated State&quot; structure, which had been proposed by Barceló decades before. In Spanish the proposal&#x27;s name remained unchanged, but in English, it was commonly referred to as a &quot;Commonwealth&quot;, to avoid confusion with full statehood. The main goal of the proposal was to provide more autonomy to the island, including executive functions similar to those in states, and to pass a constitution.

During his terms as governor, a Constitutional Convention of Puerto Rico, was called. Muñoz Marín participated in that and the drafting of the Constitution of Puerto Rico. It was passed by 82% of the people of Puerto Rico, and approved by the United States Congress in 1952. Supporters of independence left the PPD and founded the Puerto Rican Independence Party soon after.
The Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico, led by Albizu Campos, also supported full independence and had abandoned the electoral process after low support. On October 30, 1950, a group of Puerto Rican nationalists attacked the governor&#x27;s mansion and attempted to assassinate Muñoz Marín, by firing shots into his office. Muñoz Marín mobilized the Puerto Rican National Guard under the command of Puerto Rico Adjutant General Luis R. Esteves and sent them to confront the Nationalists in various towns, besides San Juan, such as Jayuya and Utuado. He ordered the police to arrest many of the Nationalists, including Albizu Campos. Subsequently, the Muñoz Marín administration used law 53, known as &quot;Ley de Mordaza&quot; (lit. &quot;the gag law&quot;) to arrest thousands of Puerto Ricans without due process, including pro-independence supporters who were not involved in the uprisings.

The inauguration acts for the establishment of the &quot;Estado Libre Associado&quot; took place on July 25, 1952. Security for the event was tightened to avoid any incident, and invitations were issued. Muñoz Marín feared that the new status could affect the Puerto Rican culture or &quot;Americanize&quot; the island&#x27;s language. The government began promoting cultural activities, founding the Pablo Casals Festival, Music Conservatory, and Puerto Rico&#x27;s Institute of Culture.

During the decade of the 1950s, most &quot;jíbaros&quot; pursued work in factories instead of agriculture, to avoid the losses from frequent hurricanes. Many people migrated to New York City during this period for its good industrial jobs. Muñoz Marín said that he &quot;did not agree with&quot; the &quot;continuing situation&quot;, and that the &quot;battle for good life, should not have all its emphasis placed on industrialization. Part of it must be placed on agriculture.&quot; American critics felt that he encouraged the migration to reduce overpopulation. Despite efforts to provide more work in agriculture on the islands, the migration continued.

In 1952, three United States senators referred to Muñoz Marin as a dictator when he would not approve &quot;New Industry&quot; tax exemptions for housing construction projects. Muñoz Marin said housing was not a new industry in Puerto Rico and the senators, Olin D. Johnston, Owen Brewster, and John Marshall Butler responded in kind by calling him a dictator on the floor of the US Senate.

On December 6, 1962, Muñoz Marín was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by US President John F. Kennedy. By 1964, Muñoz Marín had been governor for sixteen years. A group of younger members of the Popular Democratic Party felt that he should retire. They suggested that he resign, and presented a proposal for term limits — two terms for elected officials. The group named themselves &quot;Los veinte y dos&quot; (&quot;The twenty-twos&quot;) and began running a campaign, calling on civilians for support.

Victoria, Muñoz Marín&#x27;s youngest daughter joined the group, which he didn&#x27;t oppose. The day before the party had an assembly to elect its candidates, Muñoz Marín announced his decision not to run for another term. He recommended Roberto Sánchez Vilella, his Secretary of State, for the party&#x27;s candidacy. When the crowd called for &quot;four more years&quot;, Muñoz Marín said, &quot;I am not your strength ... You are your own strength.&quot; Sánchez Vilella was elected as governor.

==Later years==

After leaving the post of governor, Muñoz Marín continued his public service until 1970 as a member of the Puerto Rico Senate. In 1968, he had a serious dispute with Governor Sánchez Vilella. Still an influential figure inside the Popular Democratic Party, Muñoz Marín decided not to support Sánchez&#x27;s re-election bid.

Governor Sánchez purchased the franchise of &quot;The People&#x27;s Party&quot; (&quot;Partido del Pueblo&quot;) and decided to run for governor under this new party.

The PPD was defeated for the first time, and Luis A. Ferré was elected as governor. Muñoz Marín and Sánchez Vilella&#x27;s friendship was severely strained after this.

===Retirement===
After resigning his senate seat in 1970, Muñoz Marín temporarily moved to Italy, where one of his daughters, Viviana, had established residence. During this time he traveled to various destinations in Europe, including France, Spain and Greece.

He returned to Puerto Rico two years later, when he began writing an autobiography. He promoted the gubernatorial candidacy of the senate&#x27;s president Rafael Hernández Colón, the new leader of the Popular Democratic Party.

Late in his life, Muñoz Marín&#x27;s health weakened. On January 5, 1976, he suffered a severe stroke, which temporarily affected his ability to move, read and speak. On April 30, 1980, he died at the age of 82, after suffering complications from a severe fever. His funeral became an island-wide event, dwarfing his own father&#x27;s funeral in 1916, and attended by tens of thousands of followers. He was buried at the Muñoz Rivera Family Mausoleum in Barranquitas, Puerto Rico

Kennedy honored Muñoz Marín for his accomplishments with a state dinner at the White House, and in 1963 he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, with Special Distinction.

<doc id="153102" wikidata="Q510659" url="?curid=153102" title="Choricius of Gaza">
<text>Choricius of Gaza () was a Gaza-based Greek sophist and rhetorician of Late Antiquity. With writings dating to the early sixth century, he flourished in the time of Anastasius I (AD 491–518) as a scholar and public orator. He is considered as part of the Rhetorical School of Gaza, of which he later became the chair.

Choricius was the pupil of Procopius of Gaza, who must be distinguished from the historian Procopius of Caesarea. He was a Christian and among the surviving works of Choricius are many public addresses, such as to dedication of church of St. Sergius and a basilica dedicated to St. Stephen. Nevertheless, like other members of the School of Gaza, he displayed his traditional education through his profound knowledge of classic Hellenic mythology, literature and history. As given in his second address on bishop Marcian of Gaza, given around 520, he emphasised the bond between classic erudition and ecclesiastic scriptural exegesis, the &quot;one offering eloquence, the other one benefitting the soul&quot;.

These works also give a good insight into late-Roman Gaza, such as about its traditions and festivals as well as about the numerous building projects initiated by its impactful bishops Marcianus and the governor Stephanus.

== Style and works ==
A number of Choricius&#x27; declamations and descriptive treatises have been preserved. The declamations, which are in many cases accompanied by explanatory commentaries, chiefly consist of panegyrics, funeral orations and the stock themes of the rhetorical schools. His wedding speeches, wishing prosperity to the bride and bridegroom, strike out a new line.

Choricius was also the author of descriptions of works of art after the manner of Philostratus. The moral maxims, which were a constant feature of his writings, were largely drawn upon by Macanus Chrysocephalas, metropolitan of Philadelphia (middle of the 14th century), in his &quot;Rodonia&quot; (rose-garden), a voluminous collection of ethical sayings.

The style of Choricius is praised by Photius as pure and elegant, but he is censured for lack of naturalness. A special feature of his style is the persistent avoidance of hiatus, peculiar to what is called the school of Gaza.

<text>Barbara Jane Horrocks (born 18 January 1964) is a British actress. She portrayed Bubble and Katy Grin in the BBC sitcom &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;. She was nominated for the 1993 Olivier Award for Best Actress for the title role in the stage play &quot;The Rise and Fall of Little Voice&quot;, and received Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations for the role in the film version of &quot;Little Voice&quot;.

She is also known for her appearances in films, including &quot;The Dressmaker&quot; (1988), &quot;The Witches&quot; (1990), &quot;Second Best&quot; (1993), &quot;Life is Sweet&quot; (1990), &quot;Chicken Run&quot; (2000), &quot;Corpse Bride&quot; (2005), &quot;Sunshine on Leith&quot; (2013), &quot;Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie&quot; (2016), as well as the television series &quot;Fifi and the Flowertots&quot; (2005–2010), &quot;Little Princess&quot; (2006–2020), and the Sky One sitcom &quot;Trollied&quot;, as Julie Cook (2011–2015).

== Early life ==
Horrocks was born in Rawtenstall, Lancashire, the daughter of Barbara (née Ashworth), a hospital worker, and John Horrocks, a sales representative. She was the youngest of three children.

She attended Balladen County Primary School and Fearns county secondary school. She trained at Oldham College, and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art with Imogen Stubbs and Ralph Fiennes, and began her career with the Royal Shakespeare Company.

== Career ==
===Stage===
Horrocks has appeared on stage in &quot;Ask for the Moon&quot; (Hampstead, 1986), &quot;A Collier&#x27;s Friday Night&quot; (Greenwich, 1987), &quot;Valued Friends&quot; (Hampstead, 1989), and &quot;The Debutante Ball&quot; (Hampstead, 1989). She appeared in Catherine Cookson&#x27;s &quot;The Fifteen Streets&quot;, alongside Sean Bean and Owen Teale in 1989; &quot;Our Own Kind&quot; (Bush, 1991); &quot;Deadly Advice&quot; (Fletcher, 1993); &quot;Cabaret&quot; (Donmar Warehouse 1994); &quot;Macbeth&quot; (Greenwich Theatre, 1995); and &quot;Absurd Person Singular&quot; (Garrick Theatre, 2007).

While working on &quot;Road&quot;, a play directed by Jim Cartwright, Horrocks warmed up by doing singing impressions of Judy Garland, Shirley Bassey and Ethel Merman. Cartwright was so impressed with her mimicry he wrote &quot;The Rise and Fall of Little Voice&quot; for her. She was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress at the 1993 Laurence Olivier Awards for her performance in the 1992 West End production, directed by her then-boyfriend Sam Mendes.

Her last West End appearance was in &quot;Sweet Panic&quot;, the 2003 Stephen Poliakoff drama in which she portrayed a neurotic mother locked in a battle of wills with her disturbed son&#x27;s psychologist. She starred in Richard Jones&#x27;s critically acclaimed production of &quot;The Good Soul of Szechuan&quot; at the Young Vic in 2008. She was reunited with Jones in a new musical production of &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, which opened at the Young Vic in October 2009. At London&#x27;s Young Vic, in 2016&#x27;s &quot;If You Kiss Me, Kiss Me&quot;, Horrocks revisited the songs of her youth to sing versions of tracks by the likes of Joy Division, The Smiths, Buzzcocks, and The Human League.

In October 2014, Horrocks played Ella Khan in the London revival of &quot;East Is East&quot; at Trafalgar Studios as part of Jamie Lloyd&#x27;s Trafalgar Transformed season. In 2024, Horrocks joined the cast of the British premiere production of play &quot;Nachtland&quot; at the Young Vic theatre, directed by Patrick Marber.

In August 2024, Horrocks starred as Meg in Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Birthday Party&quot; at the Ustinov Studio.

She drew critical notice for her performance in the film &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot; (1990), followed by her award-winning performance in the West End play&quot;The Rise and Fall of Little Voice&quot; in which she sang all the songs. Horrocks became well known on screen for her role as Bubble and Katy Grin in the sitcom &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; (1992–2016).

She reprised her stage role in the 1998 screen adaptation, &quot;Little Voice&quot;, which earned nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy at the 56th Golden Globe Awards, the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role at the 52nd British Academy Film Awards, the Satellite Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy at the 3rd Golden Satellite Awards, the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role - Motion Picture at the 5th Screen Actors Guild Awards, and the British Independent Film Award for Best Actress.

For 10 years, Horrocks appeared with Prunella Scales in commercials for the UK supermarket chain Tesco. She narrated BBC Two&#x27;s television series &quot;The Speaker&quot; in April 2009.

In 2009, Horrocks took the lead in the BBC TV production &quot;Gracie!&quot;, a drama portraying the life of Gracie Fields during World War II and her relationship with the Italian-born director Monty Banks (played by Tom Hollander).

Other television credits include &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;, &quot;Victoria Wood&quot; - &quot;We&#x27;d Quite Like to Apologise&quot;, &quot;Bad Girl&quot;, &quot;Boon&quot;, &quot;Heartland&quot;, &quot;Hunting Venus&quot;, &quot;La Nonna&quot;, &quot;Leaving Home&quot;, &quot;Never Mind the Horrocks&quot;, &quot;Nightlife&quot;, &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot;, &quot;Foxbusters&quot;, &quot;Jericho&quot;, &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, &quot;Some Kind of Life&quot;, &quot;Suffer the Little Children&quot;, &quot;The Storyteller&quot;, &quot;The Garden&quot;, &quot;Fifi &amp; the Flowertots&quot;, &quot;Little Princess&quot; (the voice of the princess) and &quot;Welcome to the Times&quot;.
She was the subject of an episode of the genealogy series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; in 2006. That year, she played the title role of Ros Pritchard in &quot;The Amazing Mrs Pritchard&quot;, a drama about a woman elected prime minister.

On Tuesday 14 January 2014, Horrocks appeared as a contestant on &quot;The Great Sport Relief Bake Off&quot; on BBC Two— the celebrity version of &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot;—hosted by Jo Brand and broadcast to help raise money for the charity Sport Relief. The other contestants were TV and radio presenter Kirsty Young, choreographer Jason Gardiner, and Olympic athlete Greg Rutherford.

On 9 May 2015, she gave a reading at VE Day 70: A Party to Remember in Horse Guards Parade, London that was broadcast live on BBC1.

In 2015, she supplied the voice of the Tubby Phone in the reboot of the popular British children&#x27;s television series &quot;Teletubbies&quot;. In 2021, she began starring in the Sky comedy series &quot;Bloods&quot;.

===Audio===
Horrocks&#x27; voiceovers have been used on the films &quot;Chicken Run&quot;, &quot;Christmas Carol: The Movie&quot;, &quot;Corpse Bride&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Tinker Bell&quot;. She also did the voiceover of Fenchurch on radio and in the audio adaptation of Douglas Adams&#x27; science fiction series &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; for BBC Radio 4. She has voiced Donner in all three Robbie the Reindeer films in aid of Comic Relief.

In 2000, Horrocks made the CD &quot;Further Adventures of Little Voice&quot;, again singing in the style of favourite divas. The recording includes duets with Ewan McGregor, Robbie Williams and Dean Martin. Horrocks collaborated once more with Robbie Williams the following year, for a cover of the Bobby Darin song &quot;Things&quot; on Williams&#x27; album &quot;Swing When You&#x27;re Winning&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Horrocks has two children with her former partner, playwright Nick Vivian. They were together for 21 years, separating in 2017. She currently lives in Brighton. 

She was previously in a relationship with director Sam Mendes. She was in a relationship with the singer and actor Ian Dury, about whom she devised the 2022 drama, &quot;Love Pants: Ian Dury &amp; Jane Horrocks,&quot; for BBC Radio 4, based on her own diary entries and his love letters to her during their one-year relationship in the 1980s, when she was 23. The two remained friends until his death in 2000. Horrocks&#x27; mother, Barbara, died in 2021. Her father died in 2013.

<text>Procopius of Gaza ( 465–528 AD) was a Christian sophist and rhetorician, one of the most important representatives of the famous school of his native place. Here he spent nearly the whole of his life teaching and writing and took no part in the theological movements of his time.

==Life and work==

The little that is known of him is to be found in his letters and the &quot;encomium&quot; by his pupil and successor Choricius. Like many other members of the rhetorical school of Gaza, he studied in Alexandria and then became a teacher for rhetorics in his home town of Gaza though other cities like Antioch, Tyre and Caesarea Maritima vied for his service. 

He was the author of numerous rhetorical and theological works. Of the former, his panegyric on the emperor Anastasius alone is extant; the description of the Hagia Sophia and the monody on its partial destruction by an earthquake are spurious.

His letters (163 in number), addressed to persons of rank, friends, and literary opponents, throw valuable light upon the condition of the sophistical rhetoric of the period and about the academic circles in Alexandria and Gaza.

Procopius&#x27; theological writings consist of commentaries on the &quot;Octateuch&quot;, the books of Kings and Chronicles, Isaiah, the Proverbs, the Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes. They are amongst the earliest examples of the &quot;catenic&quot; (&quot;catena&quot;, chain) form of commentary, consisting of a series of extracts from the fathers, arranged, with independent additions, to elucidate the portions of Scripture concerned. Photius (cod. 206), while blaming the diffuseness of these commentaries, praises the writer&#x27;s learning and style, which, however, he considers too ornate for the purpose. He also wrote a monody on the earthquake of Antioch in 526 AD in and an ekphrasis of a clock in Gaza.

<text>In group theory, a Dedekind group is a group &quot;G&quot; such that every subgroup of &quot;G&quot; is normal.
All abelian groups are Dedekind groups.
A non-abelian Dedekind group is called a Hamiltonian group.

The most familiar (and smallest) example of a Hamiltonian group is the quaternion group of order 8, denoted by Q8.
Dedekind and Baer have shown (in the finite and respectively infinite order case) that every Hamiltonian group is a direct product of the form , where &quot;B&quot; is an elementary abelian 2-group, and &quot;D&quot; is a torsion abelian group with all elements of odd order.

Dedekind groups are named after Richard Dedekind, who investigated them in , proving a form of the above structure theorem (for finite groups). He named the non-abelian ones after William Rowan Hamilton, the discoverer of quaternions.

In 1898 George Miller delineated the structure of a Hamiltonian group in terms of its order and that of its subgroups. For instance, he shows &quot;a Hamilton group of order 2&quot;a&quot; has quaternion groups as subgroups&quot;. In 2005 Horvat &quot;et al&quot; used this structure to count the number of Hamiltonian groups of any order where &quot;o&quot; is an odd integer. When then there are no Hamiltonian groups of order &quot;n&quot;, otherwise there are the same number as there are Abelian groups of order &quot;o&quot;.

<text>Hesychius of Miletus (), Greek chronicler and biographer, surnamed Illustrius, son of an advocate, lived in Constantinople in the 6th century AD during the reign of Justinian. His writings contain more references to pagan Greek culture than Christianity, but his actual religion remains a matter of dispute among scholars.

According to Photius (cod. 69) he was the author of three important works:

#A &quot;Compendium of Universal History&quot; in six books, from Belus, the reputed founder of the Assyrian empire, to Anastasius I (d. 518). A considerable fragment has been preserved from the sixth book, a history of Byzantium from its earliest beginnings until the time of Constantine the Great.
#A &quot;Biographical Dictionary of Learned Men&quot;, arranged according to classes (poets, philosophers), the chief sources of which were the works of Aelius Dionysius and of Herennius Philo. Much of it has been incorporated in the &quot;Suda&quot;, as we learn from that book. It is disputed, however, whether the words in the &quot;Suda&quot; (&quot;of which this book is an epitome&quot;) mean that &quot;Suda&quot;&#x27;s compiler himself epitomized the work of Hesychius, or whether they are part of the title of an already epitomized Hesychius used in the compilation of the &quot;Suda&quot;. The second view is more generally held. The epitome referred to, in which alphabetical order was substituted for arrangement in classes and some articles on Christian writers added as a concession to the times, is assigned from internal indications to the years 829-837. Both it and the original work are lost, with the exception of the excerpts in Photius and the &quot;Suda&quot;. A smaller compilation, chiefly from Diogenes Laërtius and the &quot;Suda&quot;, with a similar title, is the work of an unknown author of the 11th or 12th century.
#A &quot;History of the Reign of Justin I&quot; (518–527) and the early years of Justinian, completely lost.
In 1663, Gilles Ménage published an anonymous &quot;Vita Aristotelis&quot; that is commonly attributed to Hesychius.

Photius praised the style of Hesychius, and credited him with being a veracious historian.

<text>Hyacinthoides non-scripta (formerly &quot;Endymion non-scriptus&quot; or &quot;Scilla non-scripta&quot;) is a bulbous perennial plant found in Atlantic areas from the north-western part of the Iberian Peninsula to the British Isles, and also frequently used as a garden plant. It is known in English as the common bluebell or simply bluebell, a name which is used in Scotland to refer to the harebell, &quot;Campanula rotundifolia&quot;. In spring, &quot;H. non-scripta&quot; produces a nodding, one-sided inflorescence of 5–12 tubular, sweet-scented violet–blue flowers, with strongly recurved tepals, and 3–6 long, linear, basal leaves.

&quot;H. non-scripta&quot; is particularly associated with ancient woodland where it may dominate the understorey to produce carpets of violet–blue flowers in &quot;bluebell woods&quot;, but also occurs in more open habitats in western regions. It is protected under UK law, and in some other parts of its range. A related species, &quot;H. hispanica&quot; has also been introduced to Britain and Ireland and hybridises with &quot;H. non-scripta&quot; to produce intermediates known as &quot;H.&quot; × &quot;massartiana&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Hyacinthoides non-scripta&quot; was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 work &#x27;, as a species in the genus &quot;Hyacinthus&quot;. The specific epithet &#x27; means &quot;unlettered&quot; or &quot;unmarked&quot; and was intended to distinguish this plant from the classical hyacinth of Greek mythology. This mythical flower, which was almost certainly not the modern hyacinth, sprang up from the blood of the dying prince Hyacinthus. His lover, the god Apollo, shed tears that marked the new flower&#x27;s petals with the letters &quot;AIAI&quot; (&quot;alas&quot;) as a sign of his grief.

In 1803, Johann Centurius von Hoffmannsegg and Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link transferred the species to the genus &quot;Scilla&quot;, and in 1849 Christian August Friedrich Garcke transferred it to the genus &quot;Endymion&quot; (now a synonym of &quot;Hyacinthoides&quot;); it is still widely known as &quot;&quot;Scilla non-scripta&quot; or &quot;Endymion non-scriptus&quot;&quot;. In 1934, Pierre Chouard transferred the species to its current placement in the genus &quot;Hyacinthoides&quot;. &quot;Scilla&quot; was the original Greek name for the sea squill, &quot;Drimia maritima&quot;; Endymion is a character from Greek mythology; &quot;Hyacinthoides&quot; means &quot;like a hyacinth&quot;.

The type species of &quot;Hyacinthoides&quot; is &quot;H. hispanica&quot;, while that of &quot;Endymion&quot; is &quot;Scilla nutans&quot;, described by James Edward Smith in &quot;English Botany&quot; in 1797, but now treated as a synonym of &quot;H. non-scripta&quot;. Smith had argued that &#x27; (&quot;nodding&quot;) is a more fitting epithet than &#x27;, which makes no sense once separated from &quot;Hyacinthus&quot;, but the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants requires the oldest name to be used, regardless of meaning.

Common names for &quot;Hyacinthoides non-scripta&quot; include bluebell, common bluebell, English bluebell, British bluebell, wild hyacinth, wood bell, fairy flower and bell bottle. In Scotland, the term &quot;bluebell&quot; is used for the harebell, &quot;Campanula rotundifolia&quot;.

===Related species===
&quot;Hyacinthoides non-scripta&quot; forms a clade with three other species – &quot;H. hispanica&quot;, &quot;H. paivae&quot; and &quot;H. cedretorum&quot; – centred on the Iberian Peninsula. &quot;H. paivae&quot; is restricted to a small area of north-western Iberia (Galicia and neighbouring parts of Portugal), while &quot;H. cedretorum&quot; is found in mountainous areas of western North Africa (Morocco and Algeria). Within Iberia, &quot;H. non-scripta&quot; and &quot;H. hispanica&quot; are geographically separated by the Duero river. The genus also contains seven further species, mostly distributed further east in the Mediterranean Basin.

==Description==

&quot;Hyacinthoides non-scripta&quot; is a perennial plant that grows from a bulb. It produces 3–6 linear leaves, all growing from the base of the plant, and each wide. An inflorescence of 5–12 (exceptionally 3–32) flowers is borne on a stem up to tall, which droops towards the tip; the flowers are arranged in a 1-sided nodding raceme. Each flower is long, with two bracts at the base, and the six tepals are strongly recurved at their tips. The tepals are violet–blue. The three stamens in the outer whorl are fused to the perianth for more than 75% of their length, and bear cream-coloured pollen. The flowers are strongly and sweetly scented. The seeds are black, and germinate on the soil surface.

The bulbs produce contractile roots; when these roots contract, they draw the bulbs down into deeper layers of the soil where there is greater moisture, reaching depths of . This may explain the absence of &quot;H. non-scripta&quot; from some thin soils over chalk in South East England, since the bulbs are unable to penetrate into sufficiently deep soils.

&quot;H. non-scripta&quot; differs from &quot;H. hispanica&quot;, which occurs as an introduced species in Britain and Ireland, in a number of ways. &quot;H. hispanica&quot; has paler flowers which are borne in radially symmetrical racemes; their tepals are less recurved, and are only faintly scented. The outer stamens are fused with the tepals for less than 75% of their length, and the anthers are the same colour as the tepals. These two species are thought to have diverged 8000 years ago. The two species hybridise readily to produce fertile offspring known as &quot;Hyacinthoides&quot; × &quot;massartiana&quot;; the hybrids are intermediate between the parental species, forming a spectrum of variation which connects the two.

==Distribution and ecology==
&quot;Hyacinthoides non-scripta&quot; is native to the western parts of Atlantic Europe, from north-western Spain and north-western Portugal, to the Netherlands, Great Britain, and Ireland. It is found in Belgium, Great Britain, France, Ireland, Portugal, the Netherlands and Spain, and also occurs as a naturalized species in Germany, Italy and Romania. It has also been introduced (and can be highly invasive) into various parts of North America, in both the Pacific Northwest (British Columbia, Washington and Oregon), the Great Lakes region (Ontario, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania) and other parts of the United States (the Virginias, Kentucky and Indiana) it has been introduced as well to New Zealand.

Despite the wide distribution of &quot;H. non-scripta&quot;, it reaches its greatest densities in Britain and Ireland, where &quot;bluebell woods&quot; (woodland with the understory dominated by &quot;H. non-scripta&quot; in spring) are a familiar sight. &quot;H. non-scripta&quot; is found throughout Britain and Ireland, with the exception of the northern Outer Hebrides (Lewis and Harris), Orkney and Shetland, and it is estimated that 25%–50% of all common bluebells may be found in Britain and Ireland.

Bluebells are a species of deciduous woodland over much of their range, flowering and leafing early before the canopy closes in late spring. They may also be found growing under bracken or Japanese knotweed, perennial plants which also form stands with a dense summer canopy. They are most successful on slightly acid soils; the same niche in alkaline conditions may be occupied by other species such as &quot;Mercurialis perennis&quot;. As a species adapted to woodlands, the young shoots are able to penetrate through a thick layer of leaf litter, and bluebells are often used as an indicator species to identify ancient woodland. Bluebells are also frequently found in hedgerows, and in the west of their range they can be found growing in open habitats, including coastal meadows. Bluebell flowers are rich in pollen and nectar, and are chiefly pollinated by bumblebees, although they are also visited by various other insects. They are a host species for the parasitic fungus &quot;Uromyces muscari&quot;, which causes bluebell rust. The ability of &quot;H. non-scripta&quot; to take up phosphorus from the soil is greatly enhanced by the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizae in its roots.

==Protection==
&quot;Hyacinthoides non-scripta&quot; is not protected under international law, such as CITES or the EU Habitats Directive.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;H. non-scripta&quot; is a protected species under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Landowners are prohibited from removing common bluebells on their land for sale and it is a criminal offence to remove the bulbs of wild common bluebells. This legislation was strengthened in 1998 under Schedule 8 of the Act making any trade in wild common bluebell bulbs or seeds an offence, punishable by fines of up to £5,000 per bulb. The species is not protected in the Isle of Man or the Republic of Ireland.

In France, &quot;H. non-scripta&quot; is largely confined to the northern half of the country. It is not legally protected at the national level, but it is protected in many of the &#x27; towards the edge of its range (Corrèze, Loiret, Gironde, Lot-et-Garonne, Dordogne, Cher, Eure-et-Loir, Indre-et-Loire and Loir-et-Cher). In Wallonia, &quot;H. non-scripta&quot; is protected under &#x27; of the &quot;&quot;.

==Uses==

Bluebells have had numerous uses over the centuries. There is little evidence of widespread medicinal use, but the bulbs contain muselage and inulin, a starchy substance which was used as a glue for bookbinding. The Elizabethans also used the starch from the bluebell bulb to stiffen the fabrics of ruffs and collars.

Bluebells are widely planted as garden plants, either among trees or in herbaceous borders. They flower at the same time as hyacinths, &quot;Narcissus&quot; and some tulips. They produce seed and reproduce vegetatively using bulb offsets, so can spread rapidly, and may need to be controlled as weeds.

In common with other members of their genus, bluebells - particularly their bulbs - are normally considered to be toxic. Bluebells synthesise a wide range of chemicals with potential medicinal properties: they contain at least 15 biologically active compounds that may provide them with protection against insects and animals. Certain extracts – water-soluble pyrrolidine alkaloids – are similar to compounds tested for use in combating HIV and cancer. The bulbs of bluebells are used in folk medicine as a remedy for leucorrhoea, and as a diuretic or styptic, while the sap can be used as an adhesive.

== In culture ==
The bluebell may be regarded as the United Kingdom&#x27;s &quot;favourite flower&quot;. When the wild plant charity Plantlife organised a survey in 2004 to find a favourite flower for each county in the United Kingdom, it decided to ban voters from choosing the bluebell because it had been by far the top choice in an earlier poll for the nation&#x27;s favourite flower. A stylised bluebell is used as the logo for the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland.

In and Out the Dusting Bluebells, also known as In and Out the Dusty Bluebells, is a children&#x27;s playground song and dance.

<text>The A30 is a major road in England, running WSW from London to Land&#x27;s End.

The road has been a principal axis in Britain from the 17th century to early 19th century, as a major coaching route and post road. It used to provide the fastest route from London to the South West by land until a century before roads were numbered; nowadays much of this function is performed by the M3 (including A316) and A303 roads. The road has kept its principal status in the west from Honiton, Devon to Land&#x27;s End where it is mainly dual carriageway and retains trunk road status.

==Route==
===London to Honiton===
The A30 begins at Henlys Roundabout, where the route stems from the A4 near Hounslow. It crosses the A312 before running south of the Southern Perimeter Road, Heathrow Airport and north of Ashford and Staines-upon-Thames, before reaching the M25 motorway orbital motorway. This first section is entirely dual carriageway. Taken with the A4, its natural continuation which nearby becomes non-dualled towards the M25, the section constitutes one of five routes into the southern half of London which reach Inner London with at least a dual-carriageway, the others being the A3, the M3, the M20 and A2, however approximately one mile before reaching Inner London it is combined with the London variants of the M3 and M4 approaches.

After running astride the M25 to cross the Thames on a bridge designed by Lutyens, the Runnymede Bridge, the A30 runs parallel to but distant from the M3 until southwest of Basingstoke, bypassing Egham and passing through heathland and Sunningdale, Bagshot bypass, and Camberley where the route almost mirrors the Devil&#x27;s Highway, a stone (&quot;stane&quot;) street to Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester Roman town), believed to be older still, then passes close to Hook town centre and in the surrounding country the soil is arable.

After the 1930s Basingstoke bypass, the M3 changes direction (between North Waltham and Popham, at the Popham Interchange) the A303 takes over for the A30 losing continuity. From Sutton Scotney village the A30 runs parallel to the latter road as-the-crow-flies to north-east of Honiton, Devon passing through towns Stockbridge (where it meets its first substantive river since the Thames, the Test) and its trout fishing centres, Shaftesbury, Sherborne, Yeovil, Crewkerne and Chard. Between Stockbridge and Shaftesbury it enters the cathedral city of Salisbury.

Between the M25 and Honiton, the A30 is mostly single carriageway, carrying local traffic with short stretches of dual carriageway from Camberley to Basingstoke, which has a dualled inner ring road, two between Stockbridge and Salisbury (an alike ring road shared with the A36), and between Sherborne and Yeovil.

===Exeter to Penzance===

This section is a trunk road as far as Penzance. The route is dual carriageway from Exeter to Camborne in West Cornwall. West of Camborne is mainly single carriageway.

To pass Exeter, through traffic can join the M5 motorway for . West of Exeter, the A30 is dual carriageway through Devon and into Cornwall, bypassing Whiddon Down, Okehampton and Launceston.

At Whiddon Down the road previously had a roundabout, known as the Merrymeet junction, but was replaced in December 2006 by a split-level junction allowing the A30 dual carriageway to run unimpeded by traffic from the A382, in what had been a major cause of traffic.

The dual carriageway continues through Cornwall. A Preferred Route Announcement to dual the section from Carland Cross to Chiverton Cross was made in July 2017, a Development Consent Order was made in February 2020 by Secretary of State for Transport, and construction started in March 2020. The new section opened in 2024.

From Chiverton Cross, the dual carriageway bypasses Redruth and Camborne. The A30 returns to single carriageway west of Camborne, and a mid-1980s bypass takes the road around Hayle. Between Hayle and Penzance, the A30 returns to the original route and it passes through several villages. Approaching Penzance, the A30 briefly becomes a dual carriageway once again. Once west of Penzance, the A30 becomes a more rural road running through or past several villages, before terminating at Land&#x27;s End.

==History==
===Post road===
A customary route was long established, even prior to the appointment of Brian Tuke as Master of the King&#x27;s Posts in 1512, and in William Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Description of England&quot; in &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot; in 1577 this is described as a route from London, through Chard, Honiton, Exeter, Crockernwell, Okehampton, Launceston, Bodmin, and on through Truro.

In 1574, Elizabeth I&#x27;s Master of Posts Thomas Randolph was given an Order of Council to establish permanent posts on the route between the royal court and Exeter &quot;for the speedy conveyance of all such packets as shall be sent from the Earl of Bedford out of the West Country&quot;, with then Earl of Bedford being Francis Russell, later Lord Lieutenant of Devon, based at Tavistock. Whilst court postmaster Robert Gascoigne was tasked the following week, the permanent posts were not in operation until 28 July 1579, when twelve Royal postmasters were in place, at the rate of 20 pence per day, formalising the route as a Royal post road.

This route followed:
* the City of London post room
* Hartfordbridge
* Basingstoke
* Andover
* Salisbury
* Shaftesbury
* Sherborne
* Crewkerne
* Honiton
* Exeter
* Crediton

All of these intermediate towns from the 1579 post road are on (or bypassed by) the modern A30, with the exception of Andover, which the modern road passes to the South of through Stockbridge, Sutton Scotney, and North Waltham.

There may have been a period of abeyance for some of these posts, but by the late 1580s, the threat of Spanish Invasion reinforced the need for effective communication along the line to Plymouth, for which the post road was the natural route. By 1595, the route was fully re-established to Exeter (and thence on a branch to Plymouth) and the royal route continued to Launceston. The route into Cornwall was used for passing of messages in relation to the Nine Years&#x27; War in Southern Ireland.

===17th–18th centuries===

The road appeared on John Ogilby&#x27;s 1675 map of Britain, as &quot;The Road from London to The Land&#x27;s End in Cornwall&quot;, where which he described that &quot;The Post-Office making this one of their Principal Roads&quot;, and opined that the section through Surrey and Hampshire was &quot;in general a very good Road with suitable Entertainment&quot;.

The route described by Ogilby started at Hyde Park Corner, and closely mirrored the modern route as far as Exeter, except for three sections from Knightsbridge to Bedfont, Basingstoke to Salisbury via Andover and Exeter to Penzance via Ashburton, Plymouth, and following the Cornish south coast via St Austell.

The road was known to attract significant postal and coach traffic along its length by 1686.

The route is described as the &quot;Great Road to Land&#x27;s End&quot; in the &quot;Magna Britannia&quot;, published in the early 19th century. As the coaching road to Land&#x27;s End was a major route, it was a popular place for highwaymen. William Davies, also known as the Golden Farmer, robbed several coaches travelling across Bagshot Heath. He was hanged in 1689 at a gallows at the local gibbet hill between Bagshot and Camberley. The Jolly Farmer pub was built near the site of the gallows (gibbet), a junction.

===19th century===

At the turn of the 19th century, William Hanning created the &quot;New Direct Road&quot;, a fast coaching route between London and Exeter. The road deviated from Ogilby&#x27;s route running via Amesbury and Ilminster, rejoining the older road at Honiton. It became popular with postal services such as &quot;The Subscription&quot;. In 1831, a race was held between London and Exeter via the New Direct Road, which resulted in a dead heat. were covered in 13 hours, compared to a typical early 18th century time of four days. In response to the competition of routes, a new turnpike road was built west of Chard, avoiding the historic route to Honiton via Stockland, with several steep hills. This road met the New Direct Road near Upottery.

This &#x27;New Direct Road&#x27; is the basis of what is now the A303.

Historically, the route between London and Land&#x27;s End was also called the &quot;Great South-West Road&quot;. In the 21st century, the name only refers to a small section of the road near Heathrow.

====Redruth to Penzance====
In 1825 an Act of Parliament established the &quot;Hayle Bridge Causeway and Turnpike Trust&quot; which was required to construct a bridge, causeway and turnpike over the Hayle River from Griggs Quay () in the west to Phillack in the east. The turnpike was needed to ease the transport of copper ore to the port at Hayle for export. A second Act was passed in 1837 to establish the &quot;Griggs Quay to Penzance Turnpike&quot; and in 1839 an Act formed a third trust, the &quot;Hayle and Redruth Turnpike&quot; to complete the turnpike to Redruth. The running of the Causeway turnpike was overseen by the winner of a public auction and for the year 1880, the winning bid was £591 10s. In 1885 the management of the causeway by the turnpike came to an end, and the White house (tollhouse) on the eastern end of the Hayle causeway, along with the garden and three granite posts was put up for auction on 30 October 1885. A second tollhouse at Long Rock was also for auction as well as a number of posts and gates.

===20th century===

The A30 was one of the first roads to be classified by the Ministry of Transport for funding in 1921. It followed Ogilby&#x27;s route up to Exeter, then the basic route of the modern A30 through Okehampton, Launceston and Bodmin to the Greenmarket in Penzance, where it ended. It was extended to Land&#x27;s End in 1925.

The Great South West Road section of the A30 around Heathrow had been planned as the western end of the Great West Road project, one of the first bypasses built for motor traffic. Construction began in 1914 but was quickly halted because of World War I. It resumed construction in 1919. The full route from Chiswick to Ashford was opened by King George V on 30 May 1925.

Following the construction of a bypass around Basingstoke, the route of the A30 was changed on 1 April 1933 to run by Sutton Scotney and Stockbridge, rejoining the original route at Lopcombe Corner east of Salisbury. An alternative route, the A303 was created out of existing roads at the same time between Micheldever Station and the Blackdown Hills, that followed the basic course of Hanning&#x27;s New Direct Road. The A30 remained the principal route between London and Exeter, until the A303 became a trunk road in 1958, receiving central Government funding and relegating the parallel A30 to a local road.

By the mid-20th century, large sections of the A30 were struggling to cope with the increasing demands of road traffic. In the mid-1960s, numerous councils complained that the Secretary of State for Transport, Barbara Castle, decided that improvements to the A38 from Exeter to Plymouth were of higher priority for funding than any work on the A30. Cornwall County Council complained that the A30 through the county was narrow and twisted, and known as the &quot;stage coach trail&quot;.

Following World War II, the Ministry of Transport planned a large-scale upgrade of the A30 across south-west England, with the eventual intention that most of the route would be at least dual-carriageway. The M3 motorway was planned as a replacement for the A30 between London and Popham. Following a public enquiry in 1966, the line was fixed the following year. The work was completed as far as Bagshot in 1971, then to Sunbury-on-Thames in 1974. In 1971, the Secretary of State for the Environment, Peter Walker announced many upgrades of the A30 across Devon and Cornwall, identifying the section from Okehampton to Bodmin as a key area of improvement.

The Honiton dual-carriageway bypass opened in early December 1966 at a cost of £984,000. The Hayle bypass was first proposed in the late 1970s. It was controversial, and Dora Russell protested against its construction. It was completed in 1985.


The Okehampton bypass, which opened on 19 July 1988, goes to the south of the town, cutting through the northern edge of Dartmoor National Park in Devon. In the 1980s, the route of the bypass was the subject of a prolonged campaign from conservationists, including Sylvia Sayer, who preferred a route to the north of the town through agricultural land.

The section between Honiton and Exeter in East Devon was upgraded in 1999 to dual carriageway, giving quicker access to Exeter International Airport. This road was built under the Design Build Finance Operate (DBFO) Private Finance Initiative scheme by the private consortium Connect A30, who receive a shadow toll from the Government for each vehicle travelling along the road. Archaeological investigations during the work found a Roman cavalry garrison and later settlement at Pomeroy Wood. There were several protests by environmentalists during construction and the particular nature of the DBFO scheme, with a long-lasting occupation of sites on the planned route, focused around Fairmile. Swampy received press attention for his part in this protest. In 2016, President of The Automobile Association, Edmund King, claimed that the action had led to a slowdown in road construction throughout Britain.

===21st century===
During 2006 one of the main bottlenecks on the road was removed when the Merrymeet roundabout between Okehampton and Exeter near Whiddon Down was replaced with a grade-separated junction and dual carriageway.

Since the Bodmin to Indian Queens project was completed in late 2007, the new dual carriageway runs to the north of Goss Moor. The previous road has been converted to a cycle lane. In December 2012 it was announced that from Temple to Higher Carblake would be upgraded to a dual carriageway. Building started in early 2015, and was completed in summer 2017. This work made the A30 continuous dual carriageway between the M5 at Exeter and Carland Cross in Cornwall.

On 17 January 2008, British Airways Flight 38 crash-landed near the Great South West Road southeast of Heathrow Airport. Shortly before the crash landing, the captain of the Boeing 777 involved was able to clear the A30 by raising the flaps, saving the lives of motorists on the ground.

In 2014, the A30 was identified as one of several key routes in the Government&#x27;s Road Investment Strategy, turning it into a strategic corridor for southwest England. This includes further dual carriageway improvements east of Honiton towards the Blackdown Hills and between Chiverton Cross and Carland Cross.

In 2022, the casket of Queen Elizabeth II was driven partially on this road en route to Windsor Castle, her final resting place.

====Carland Cross to Chiverton Cross====
Dualling of the stretch between Carland Cross and Chiverton Cross established a continuous dual carriageway from Exeter right through to Camborne. Although this was shelved in 2006 as it was not considered a regional priority, it was included within the government&#x27;s Road Investment Strategy in 2014. The preferred route was announced in July 2017, and on 6 February 2020, the Secretary of State for Transport approved Highways England&#x27;s application for a Development Consent Order for the scheme to be constructed. Work began in March 2020 with an estimated cost of £330 million, a total of £20 million being provided by the European Regional Development Fund. The scheme is included as a case study in the Department for Transport&#x27;s document Road Investment Strategy 2: 2020–2025. The route of the road passes near a World Heritage Site, a Registered Park and Gardens and a number of Sites of Special Scientific Interest. The scheme included a 20-metre-wide &#x27;green bridge&#x27; over the new road to promote connectivity and biodiversity. The road opened in 2024, 49 years after the nearby Camborne-Redruth bypass section, which had opened in 1975.

==Cultural references==
John Betjeman referred to the A30 in his poem &quot;Meditation on the A30&quot;. Arthur Boyt, focus of BBC documentary &quot;The Man Who Eats Badgers&quot;, described the A30 near Bodmin Moor as a good road for finding roadkill.

In Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus, episode 34: The Cycling Tour, Mr Pither laments &quot;As I lay down to the sound of the Russian gentlemen practising their shooting, I realised I was in a bit of a pickle. My heart sank as I realised I should never see the Okehampton by-pass again...&quot;, just before his impending execution in Russia.

Rick Beato, interviewing Brian May of the band Queen in 2021, asked him (about the band), &quot;How often would you tune?&quot; to which May replied, &quot;Not often enough, some people would say. We used to say we tuned to the A30.&quot;

<text>Sir Timothy Bartel Smit KBE (born 25 September 1954) is a Dutch-born British businessman who jointly helped create the Lost Gardens of Heligan, and the Eden Project in Cornwall, United Kingdom.

==Early life==

Tim Smit was born in Scheveningen, the son of airline KLM chief executive Jan Smit and his English wife. He was educated in England at Vinehall School, East Sussex, and Cranbrook School, Kent, before going on to study archaeology and anthropology at Hatfield College, Durham.

==Career==
He worked as an archaeologist before working as both a songwriter and producer receiving seven platinum and gold discs.

In 1987 he moved with his family to Cornwall and became involved with Rob Poole, John Nelson and The Lost Gardens of Heligan. Smit wrote a book about the project.
With architect Jonathan Ball, he jointly created the Eden Project, near St Austell, an £80 million initiative to build two transparent biomes in an old china clay pit near the village of Bodelva. The biomes contain different eco-climates; rainforest and Mediterranean. The outside area is also described as a biome and has areas such as &quot;Wild Cornwall&quot;. Eden aims to educate people about environmental matters and encourages a greater understanding and empathy with these matters. Smit raised the funds and the site design was by Nicholas Grimshaw. Smit has claimed that The Eden Project has contributed over £1 billion into the Cornish economy.

Smit&#x27;s book about the creation of the Eden Project, &quot;Eden&quot;, was published in 2001 and updated on the 10th anniversary of the opening in March 2011.

Smit was appointed an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2002 New Year Honours and awarded the Kilgerran Award of the Foundation for Science and Technology in 2003. In 2006 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Design degree by the University of the West of England &quot;in recognition of his outstanding achievements in promoting the understanding and practice of the responsible management of the vital relationship between plants, people and resources, which have made a major contribution regionally, nationally and internationally to sustainable development, tourism, architecture and landscape architecture&quot;.

Smit has been outspoken in his views on issues such as social enterprise and entrepreneurship. In a 2008 interview, he said:

Britain is crap at being entrepreneurial because (a) it&#x27;s a risk averse country, and (b) the stigma of failure is so high that if you fail you&#x27;re considered to be a loser. Entrepreneurism is a word that has been stolen by people who don&#x27;t understand it. The truth is that people who are entrepreneurial take risks, and risk is something that is un-British, and if you&#x27;re successful with it they&#x27;ll hate you for it.
In the early 21st century, Smit became a Social Enterprise Ambassador.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 2001 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel at the Eden Project. 

Smit was appointed Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in January 2011 in recognition of his services to public engagement with science. In May 2012, the award was made substantive when he became a British citizen, allowing Smit to use the title &quot;Sir&quot;.

In November 2016, Smit was awarded an honorary Doctor of Education degree by Bournemouth University.

Smit is one of the backers of the Eden Westwood project, a joint project between the Eden Project and developers Westwood to build a 175 acre (71 hectares) leisure and tourism destination at Junction 27 of the M5 in Devon. The development was included in the Mid Devon Local Plan which was adopted in July 2020. In January 2021 Smit submitted plans for a development in Lostwithiel consisting of an orchard with 3,000 fruit trees, a pottage garden, a multi-use building with cookery school, microbrewery, distillery, cider press and 20 accommodation units.

==Politics==
In August 2014, Smit was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

Prior to the 2015 UK general election, he was one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party&#x27;s Caroline Lucas.

==Portraits of Smit==
The National Portrait Gallery collection has two photographs of Tim Smit from 2002. In 2008, Smit agreed to sit for sculptor Jon Edgar in Fowey as part of his Environment Series.

==Controversy==

In 2004, Eden Project co-founder Jonathan Ball won over £1.8m in damages from the law firm Druces &amp; Attlee, which the High Court found had failed to secure Ball&#x27;s just financial reward when he left the project in 1997.

In February 2022, Smit criticised what he regarded as the backward-looking tendency of some Cornish people.

<text>In group theory, the quaternion group Q8 (sometimes just denoted by Q) is a non-abelian group of order eight, isomorphic to the eight-element subset
formula_1 of the quaternions under multiplication. It is given by the group presentation

:formula_2

where &quot;e&quot; is the identity element and commutes with the other elements of the group. These relations, discovered by W. R. Hamilton, also generate the quaternions as an algebra over the real numbers.

Another presentation of Q8 is
:formula_3

Like many other finite groups, it can be realized as the Galois group of a certain field of algebraic numbers. 

== Compared to dihedral group ==

The quaternion group Q8 has the same order as the dihedral group D4, but a different structure, as shown by their Cayley and cycle graphs:

In the diagrams for D4, the group elements are marked with their action on a letter F in the defining representation R2. The same cannot be done for Q8, since it has no faithful representation in R2 or R3. D4 can be realized as a subset of the split-quaternions in the same way that Q8 can be viewed as a subset of the quaternions.

== Cayley table ==

The Cayley table (multiplication table) for Q8 is given by:

== Properties ==

The elements &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, and &quot;k&quot; all have order four in Q8 and any two of them generate the entire group. Another presentation of Q8 based in only two elements to skip this redundancy is:

:formula_4

For instance, writing the group elements in lexicographically minimal normal forms, one may identify: formula_5 The quaternion group has the unusual property of being Hamiltonian: Q8 is non-abelian, but every subgroup is normal. Every Hamiltonian group contains a copy of Q8.

The quaternion group Q8 and the dihedral group D4 are the two smallest examples of a nilpotent non-abelian group.

The center and the commutator subgroup of Q8 is the subgroup formula_6. The inner automorphism group of Q8 is given by the group modulo its center, i.e. the factor group formula_7 which is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V. The full automorphism group of Q8 is isomorphic to S4, the symmetric group on four letters (see &quot;Matrix representations&quot; below), and the outer automorphism group of Q8 is thus S4/V, which is isomorphic to S3.

The quaternion group Q8 has five conjugacy classes, formula_8 and so five irreducible representations over the complex numbers, with dimensions 1, 1, 1, 1, 2:

Trivial representation.

Sign representations with i, j, k-kernel: Q8 has three maximal normal subgroups: the cyclic subgroups generated by i, j, and k respectively. For each maximal normal subgroup &quot;N&quot;, we obtain a one-dimensional representation factoring through the 2-element quotient group &quot;G&quot;/&quot;N&quot;. The representation sends elements of &quot;N&quot; to 1, and elements outside &quot;N&quot; to −1.

2-dimensional representation: Described below in &quot;Matrix representations&quot;. It is not realizable over the real numbers, but is a complex representation: indeed, it is just the quaternions formula_9 considered as an algebra over formula_10, and the action is that of left multiplication by formula_11.

The character table of Q8 turns out to be the same as that of D4: 
Nevertheless, all the irreducible characters formula_12 in the rows above have real values, this gives the decomposition of the real group algebra of formula_13 into minimal two-sided ideals:

:formula_14

where the idempotents formula_15 correspond to the irreducibles:

:formula_16

so that

:formula_17

Each of these irreducible ideals is isomorphic to a real central simple algebra, the first four to the real field formula_18. The last ideal formula_19 is isomorphic to the skew field of quaternions formula_9 by the correspondence:

:formula_21

Furthermore, the projection homomorphism formula_22 given by formula_23 has kernel ideal generated by the idempotent:

:formula_24

so the quaternions can also be obtained as the quotient ring formula_25. Note that this is irreducible as a real representation of formula_26, but splits into two copies of the two-dimensional irreducible when extended to the complex numbers. Indeed, the complex group algebra is formula_27 where formula_28 is the algebra of biquaternions.

== Matrix representations ==

The two-dimensional irreducible complex representation described above gives the quaternion group Q8 as a subgroup of the general linear group formula_29. The quaternion group is a multiplicative subgroup of the quaternion algebra:

:formula_30

which has a regular representation formula_31 by left multiplication on itself considered as a complex vector space with basis formula_32 so that formula_33 corresponds to the formula_34-linear mapping formula_35 The resulting representation

:formula_36

is given by:

:formula_37

Since all of the above matrices have unit determinant, this is a representation of Q8 in the special linear group formula_38.

A variant gives a representation by unitary matrices (table at right). Let formula_39 correspond to the linear mapping formula_40 so that formula_41 is given by:

:formula_42

It is worth noting that physicists exclusively use a different convention for the formula_43 matrix representation to make contact with the usual Pauli matrices:

:formula_44

This particular choice is convenient and elegant when one describes spin-1/2 states in the formula_45 basis and considers angular momentum ladder operators formula_46

There is also an important action of Q8 on the 2-dimensional vector space over the finite field formula_47 (table at right). A modular representation formula_48 is given by

:formula_49

This representation can be obtained from the extension field:

:formula_50

where formula_51 and the multiplicative group formula_52 has four generators, formula_53 of order 8. For each formula_54 the two-dimensional formula_55-vector space formula_56 admits a linear mapping:

:formula_57

In addition we have the Frobenius automorphism formula_58 satisfying formula_59 and formula_60 Then the above representation matrices are:

:formula_61

This representation realizes Q8 as a normal subgroup of . Thus, for each matrix formula_62, we have a group automorphism

:formula_63

with formula_64 In fact, these give the full automorphism group as:

:formula_65

This is isomorphic to the symmetric group S4 since the linear mappings formula_66 permute the four one-dimensional subspaces of formula_67 i.e., the four points of the projective space formula_68

Also, this representation permutes the eight non-zero vectors of formula_67 giving an embedding of Q8 in the symmetric group S8, in addition to the embeddings given by the regular representations.

==Galois group==
Richard Dedekind considered the field formula_70 in attempting to relate the quaternion group to Galois theory. In 1936 Ernst Witt published his approach to the quaternion group through Galois theory.

In 1981, Richard Dean showed the quaternion group can be realized as the Galois group Gal(T/Q) where Q is the field of rational numbers and T is the splitting field of the polynomial
:formula_71.
The development uses the fundamental theorem of Galois theory in specifying four intermediate fields between Q and T and their Galois groups, as well as two theorems on cyclic extension of degree four over a field.

==Generalized quaternion group==
A generalized quaternion group Q4&quot;n&quot; of order 4&quot;n&quot; is defined by the presentation
:formula_72
for an integer , with the usual quaternion group given by &quot;n&quot; = 2. Coxeter calls Q4&quot;n&quot; the dicyclic group formula_73, a special case of the binary polyhedral group formula_74 and related to the polyhedral group formula_75 and the dihedral group formula_76. The generalized quaternion group can be realized as the subgroup of formula_77 generated by

:formula_78

where formula_79. It can also be realized as the subgroup of unit quaternions generated by formula_80 and formula_81.

The generalized quaternion groups have the property that every abelian subgroup is cyclic. It can be shown that a finite &quot;p&quot;-group with this property (every abelian subgroup is cyclic) is either cyclic or a generalized quaternion group as defined above. Another characterization is that a finite &quot;p&quot;-group in which there is a unique subgroup of order &quot;p&quot; is either cyclic or a 2-group isomorphic to generalized quaternion group. In particular, for a finite field &quot;F&quot; with odd characteristic, the 2-Sylow subgroup of SL2(&quot;F&quot;) is non-abelian and has only one subgroup of order 2, so this 2-Sylow subgroup must be a generalized quaternion group, . Letting &quot;pr&quot; be the size of &quot;F&quot;, where &quot;p&quot; is prime, the size of the 2-Sylow subgroup of SL2(&quot;F&quot;) is 2&quot;n&quot;, where .

The Brauer–Suzuki theorem shows that the groups whose Sylow 2-subgroups are generalized quaternion cannot be simple.

Another terminology reserves the name &quot;generalized quaternion group&quot; for a dicyclic group of order a power of 2, which admits the presentation

<text>Chocobo Racing is a racing game developed and published by Square for the PlayStation, A spin-off of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series and part of the &quot;Chocobo&quot; spin-off series. It was released in Japan in March 1999, followed by North America and Europe in August and October, respectively. The game&#x27;s star and namesake is the Chocobo, with other figures from the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, such as Mog the Moogle, the Black Mage, and Cid being part of the cast. Most of the game&#x27;s soundtrack is composed using songs from previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles. As a formulaic kart racer, &quot;Chocobo Racing&quot; is often compared to &quot;Mario Kart&quot; and &quot;Crash Team Racing&quot;.

&quot;Chocobo Racing&quot; received generally average reviews, with critics citing its low quality in several aspects of gameplay. The game was later released in Japan alongside &quot;Chocobo Stallion&quot; and &quot;Dice de Chocobo&quot; as part of the &quot;Chocobo Collection&quot;. The game was re-released individually as part of the PSone Books series in December 2001. It was released in Japan as a PSOne Classic on February 10, 2009.

== Gameplay ==
In &quot;Chocobo Racing&quot;, the player controls &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; characters, most of whom race in go-karts. Other characters fly, drive scooters, ride magic carpets, or even run. Players have five different racing modes to choose from: Story Mode, Versus Mode, Grand Prix, Relay Race, and Time Attack. In the Story Mode, players are guided through the story of &quot;Chocobo Racing&quot;, which is narrated by Cid, in the form of a pop-up book. Completing the Story Mode unlocks secret character racers and allows players to create a custom racer of their own. In the Versus Mode, two players can race each other on a horizontally split screen. In Grand Prix (GP) Mode, the player races computer-controlled opponents in four selected tracks of their choice. In Relay Race Mode, the player chooses three racers to compete in a relay race. In Time Attack Mode, the player can select any stage and try to beat the fastest time record set there. There are a total of ten tracks, two of which have to be unlocked by playing the story mode: Cid&#x27;s Test Track, Moogle Forest, The Ancient Gate, Mythril Mines, The Black Manor, Floating Gardens, Gingerbread Land, Vulcan-O Valley, Fantasia, and F.F.VIII Circuit.

While racing, the player can accelerate, brake, reverse, activate Magic Stones, or use a &quot;special ability&quot; using the game controller&#x27;s analog stick and buttons. An additional move is the skid, which is executed by simultaneously braking and accelerating into a turn; as the game&#x27;s cornering technique, the skid can be used to take sharp turns quickly. If the player skids too sharply, however, a spin out will occur. Before the start of any race, the player&#x27;s character can receive a speed boost by tapping the Accelerate button with precise timing during the countdown.
In the world of &quot;Chocobo Racing&quot;, Magic Stones are scattered throughout each course, and can be picked up by the player by driving through them. Magic Stones can also be stolen from opponents by bumping into them from behind. The player can then activate the Magic Stone for some special effect. Activating a Haste Stone, for example, gives the character a short speed boost. Some Magic Stones stack, increasing in power if more than one of the same kind of stone is picked up by the player. Each stone is represented by a corresponding symbol on the racetrack, while stones marked with question marks grant the player a single kind of Magic Stone at random.

Special abilities are another important aspect of &quot;Chocobo Racing&quot;. Before each race, the player is prompted to assign a special ability to the selected character. During a race, the player can only activate the chosen special ability when the meter in the upper left-hand corner of the screen is full. After using the special ability, the player must wait for the meter to recharge to use it again.

== Plot ==
=== Setting ===
&quot;Chocobo Racing&quot; borrows themes and elements from &quot;Final Fantasy I&quot; to &quot;VIII&quot;. The Story Mode is narrated by Cid and includes nine chapters in a pop-up book fashion with FMVs. To progress, the player needs to defeat the chapter&#x27;s respective challenger. Before each chapter begins, the player is given the option of viewing the story or skipping to the race except when playing the Story Mode for the first time.

=== Characters ===
The cast of &quot;Chocobo Racing&quot; is drawn from recurring creatures and characters from the &quot;Chocobo&#x27;s Dungeon&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. Eight characters -- Chocobo, Mog, Golem, Goblin, Black Magician, White Mage, Chubby Chocobo, and Behemoth—are immediately available, and additional, secret characters such as Cactuar, Bahamut, Cloud, Aya, and Squall may be unlocked after completing Story Mode.

=== Story ===
Chapter one, titled &quot;Gadgets a go-go&quot;, begins with the inventor Cid presenting Chocobo with a pair of &quot;Jet-Blades&quot; and offers Chocobo a chance to take a test-run with them on the racetrack behind his lab. After the race, Mog the Moogle drops in and asks Cid about the progress of the racing machine he&#x27;d commissioned. Cid promises to bring the machine by tomorrow, but later confides to Chocobo he&#x27;d forgotten it. The next day, after presenting the doubtful Mog with his scooter, Chocobo and Mog race. After Chocobo wins, Mog confronts Cid over his vehicle&#x27;s poor performance, but Cid replies that Chocobo won because of the differences in their abilities (i.e., Chocobo&#x27;s &quot;Dash&quot;). He explains that the secret of Chocobo&#x27;s &quot;Dash&quot; ability is the Blue Crystal on his leg-ring. Mog mulls over his inferior &quot;Flap&quot; ability and decides he wants a Blue Crystal as well, so Cid recommends that the two go on an adventure to find out the secret of the Blue Crystal.

The two head out to discover the secret behind the Blue Crystal, meeting (and racing) many along the way. When they reach Mysidia, the village of mages, a White Mage there notices that all the companions have Magicite, which the companions had previously referred to as &quot;Blue Crystals&quot;. The companions want to know the legend behind the Magicite shards; the White Mage agrees to tell them on the condition that they race her in the Floating Gardens, with the story as the winner&#x27;s prize. Upon winning, she tells them of the legend: &quot;There are Magicite Shards scattered all over the world. It used to be one large Magicite Crystal...But people kept fighting each other over it. So the founder of Mysidia, the great magician Ming-Wu, broke the Crystal into eight pieces. He then scattered the shards to the four winds. He did so to assure later restoration of the Magicite Crystal...when all eight pieces are brought together again&quot;.

After this discovery, the companions continue to search for other racers in possession of the crystal shards. Upon defeating Behemoth in a race, the monster joins their ranks, bringing the party&#x27;s number to eight. The companions then notice that their Magicite shards begin to glow, and Mog discovers that he possessed Magicite all along. The convergence of all eight shards of the Magicite crystal fulfills Ming-Wu&#x27;s prophecy, and the gate to Fantasia, the Land of the Espers, opens. When the companions arrive in Fantasia, they are greeted by Bahamut, King of the Espers. Bahamut decides to test their worth with a final trial, and welcomes their attempts to defeat him in a race. After the race, Bahamut acknowledges the powers of the group. He goes on to rhetorically ask if the companions knew why Ming-Wu broke up the Magicite, and explains the legend once more. Bahamut is pleased with the companions, noting that humans, moogles, chocobos, dragons, and monsters all came together in goodwill. In celebration, he decides to leave the portal between the world and Fantasia open, declaring that &quot;Fantasia shall exist in harmony with your world from this day on&quot;.

Upon completion of the Story Mode, players are assigned a number of points determined by their performance, with a maximum of one hundred. Using those points, the player is given the option of creating a racer with customized color and performance. The point value is distributed among five parameters: Max Speed, Acceleration, Grip, Drift, and A.G.S., which determines how fast the racer&#x27;s ability gauge charges. A maximum of twenty points can be assigned to each of the five racing parameters. Customized racers can be used in all of the game&#x27;s modes except for the Story Mode, and only the main characters and Bahamut are open to customization.

== Development ==
The first demonstration of &quot;Chocobo Racing&quot; was at the Fall Tokyo Game Show &#x27;98; it was then unclear if there would be a North American release. &quot;IGN&quot; staff noted its striking similarities to &quot;Mario Kart&quot;. In the release of &quot;Chocobo&#x27;s Dungeon 2&quot;, a bonus CD included a video clip of the game. Originally slated to be released in late September/October, the release date was moved to August 1999 because &quot;it was done early, and is now ready to go&quot;. Square worked with toy company Choro Qi to produce toy cars for the release of the game.

=== Music ===

&quot;Chocobo Racing Original Soundtrack&quot; is a soundtrack album produced by Square. It was released in Japan on March 25, 1999 by DigiCube, and sold roughly 35,000 units. Almost all of the tracks are arrangements of music Nobuo Uematsu composed for &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, arranged by Kenji Ito. The only exception is the song played during the final song, &quot;Treasure Chest In The Heart&quot;, which is a vocal track orchestrated by Shirō Hamaguchi and performed by Hiromi Ohta in Japanese and Vicki Bell in English.

== Reception ==
The game received mixed reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.

Douglass C. Perry of &quot;IGN&quot; said the game was an attempt by Square to &quot;cash in&quot; on the popular kart racer genre created by Nintendo&#x27;s successful &quot;Mario Kart&quot;. Other reviewers agreed, calling it &quot;a tired rehash&quot; due to its colorful but unpolished graphics, crude track designs, and poor controls. Daniel Erickson of &quot;NextGen&quot; called it &quot;kart-racing fare&quot; that is standard but lacks the deathmatch-type courses that made &quot;Mario Kart&quot; popular. In Japan, however, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 30 out of 40.

&quot;1Up.com&quot;″s &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; Retro Roundup stated that it was a &quot;decent game&quot; ruined by the necessity of steering with a D-pad, and was rated &quot;Not Worth It&quot;. Many similarities were noted with &quot;Mario Kart&quot; such as similar course themes and the need to &quot;power slide&quot;. It was also called too easy, with story mode lasting only two hours and there being limited replay value except for the unlocking of secret characters and courses. Other critiques included a lack of a battle mode and limited customization. The music was thought to be average, though the last song of the story mode was &quot;strikingly beautiful&quot;.

In Japan, the game sold 300,000 units.

== Sequels ==
In 2010, a new &quot;Chocobo Racing&quot; title, tentatively titled &quot;Codename: Chocobo Racing 3D&quot;, was announced for the Nintendo 3DS handheld system. However, in October 2013, Takashi Tokita, director of the original &quot;Chocobo Racing&quot;, confirmed that the project had been cancelled, noting that had he been part of its development process, he &quot;would have made sure that it came out&quot;.

A new &quot;Chocobo Racing&quot; sequel, &quot;Chocobo GP&quot;, was released for the Nintendo Switch as an exclusive title on March 10, 2022.

<doc id="153134" wikidata="Q158899" url="?curid=153134" title="Carl Loewe">
<text>Johann Carl Gottfried Loewe (; 30 November 1796 – 20 April 1869), usually called Carl Loewe (sometimes seen as Karl Loewe), was a German composer, tenor singer and conductor. In his lifetime, his songs (&quot;Balladen&quot;) were well enough known for some to call him the &quot;Schubert of North Germany&quot;, and Hugo Wolf came to admire his work. He is less known today, but his ballads and songs, which number over 400, are occasionally performed.

== Life and career ==
Loewe was born in Löbejün and received his first music lessons from his father. He was a choir-boy, first at Köthen, and later at Halle, where he went to grammar school. The beauty of Loewe&#x27;s voice brought him under the notice of Madame de Staël, who procured him a pension from Jérôme Bonaparte, then king of Westphalia, which enabled him to further his education in music, and to study theology at Halle University. In 1810, he began lessons in Halle with Daniel Gottlob Türk. This ended in 1813, on the flight of the king.

In 1820, he moved to Stettin in Prussia (now Szczecin in Poland), where he worked as organist and music director of the school. It was while there that he did most of his work as a composer, publishing a version of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Erlkönig&quot; in 1824 (written 1817/18) which some say at least equals Schubert&#x27;s better known version. He went on to set many other poets&#x27; works, including Friedrich Rückert, and translations of William Shakespeare and Lord Byron.

In 1821 he married Julie von Jacob, who died in 1823. His second wife, Auguste Lange, was an accomplished singer, and they appeared together in his oratorio performances with great success.

On 20 February 1827, he conducted the first performance of the 18-year-old Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s Overture &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, Op. 21. He and Mendelssohn were also soloists in Mendelssohn&#x27;s Concerto in A-flat major for 2 pianos and orchestra.

Later in life, Loewe became very popular both as a composer and as a singer. As a youth, he had a high soprano voice (he could sing the music of the Queen of the Night in &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; as a boy), and his voice developed into a fine tenor. He made several tours as a singer in the 1840s and 1850s, visiting England, France, Sweden and Norway amongst other countries. He eventually moved back to Germany, and, after quitting his posts in Stettin after 46 years, moved to Kiel, where he would die from a stroke on 20 April 1869.

Loewe was also active as a music teacher. His most famous student, whom he taught composition from 1841 to 1847, was Emilie Mayer, of whom he said that &quot;such a God-given talent as hers had not been bestowed upon any other person he knew&quot;. Mayer would later go on enjoying a successful career in Berlin as a freelance composer, ultimately earning her the nickname &quot;weibliche Beethoven&quot; (eng. female Beethoven).

==Works==

Loewe wrote five operas, of which only one, &quot;&quot;, was performed at Berlin in 1834, without much success; seventeen oratorios, many of them for male voices unaccompanied, or with short instrumental interludes only; choral ballads, cantatas, three string quartets (his opus 24,) and a pianoforte trio; a work for clarinet and piano, published posthumously; and some piano solos.

But the branch of his art by which he is remembered is the solo ballad with pianoforte accompaniment. His treatment of long narrative poems, in a clever mixture of the dramatic and lyrical styles, was undoubtedly modelled on the ballads of Johann Rudolf Zumsteeg, and has been copied by many composers since his day. His settings of the &quot;Erlkönig&quot; (a very early example), &quot;Archibald Douglas&quot; on a text by Theodor Fontane, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Edward&quot; on a translation by Johann Gottfried Herder of a British ballad, and &quot;&quot;, are particularly fine.

There are at least two symphonies by Loewe – one, in D minor, has been recorded on the Koch Schwann label together with the first of at least two CD recordings of Loewe&#x27;s second piano concerto (in A major), and another, in E minor, was given its first performance in 170 years in November 2004. (The cpo series of recordings of Loewe&#x27;s complete ballads includes as well a recording of two piano sonatas and a &quot;tone poem in sonata form&quot;, with one of the sonatas – the E major of 1829 – having a vocal part for soprano and baritone.)

In 1875, at Bayreuth, Richard Wagner remarked of Loewe, &quot;&quot; (Ha, that is a serious German Master, authentic and true, one who uses the beautiful German language with meaning, one who cannot be sufficiently revered!).

==Style==
Loewe&#x27;s earliest songs, such as the &#x27; and the &#x27;, follow the musical pattern of the late 18th century tradition, using a single melodic line, basic accompaniment, and mostly strophic and varied strophic forms.

Under Zumsteeg&#x27;s influence, Loewe began incorporating and cultivating the ballad form into his vocal songs. When compared to other &quot;Lieder&quot; composers, Loewe&#x27;s rhapsodic composition style is said to have &quot;a striking absence of organic musical development&quot;. His settings of poetry separated poetic ideas and treated them episodically rather than using unifying motifs (like fellow Lieder composer, Franz Schubert).

One of Loewe&#x27;s strengths as a composer were his &quot;imaginative and, at times, daring&quot; accompaniments, which were often atmospheric and exploited the piano&#x27;s sonorous and tonal potential.

==His heart==
In 2012 an urn thought to contain the heart of Carl Loewe was found inside the Szczecin Cathedral&#x27;s southern pillar during the renovation works carried out that year. A special commission appointed by the Szczecińsko-Kamieńska Metropolitan Curia has deduced, on the basis of historical records and an inscription on the pillar, that the urn indeed contains the heart of Carl Loewe.

<text>There have been 54 ethnic groups in Vietnam as officially recognized by the Vietnamese government since 2 March 1979. Each ethnicity has their own unique language, traditions, and culture. The largest ethnic groups are: Kinh 85.32%, Tày 1.92%, Thái 1.89%, Mường 1.51%, Hmong 1.45%, Khmer 1.32%, Nùng 1.13%, Dao 0.93%, Hoa 0.78%, with all others accounting for the remaining 3.7% (2019 census). The Vietnamese terms for ethnic groups are &quot;dân tộc&quot; (nation) and &quot;sắc tộc&quot; (ethnicity).

==List of ethnic groups==
The total population of Vietnam was 96,208,984 according to the 2019 census.

==Other==
# Nguồn - possibly Mường group, officially classified as a Việt (Kinh) group by the government, Nguồn themselves identify with Việt ethnicity; their language is a member of the Viet–Muong branch of the Vietic sub-family.
# Sui (Người Thủy) - officially classified as Pa Then people.
# According to news from &quot;Dantri&quot;, an online newspaper in Vietnam, the Thừa Thiên-Huế People&#x27;s Committee in September 2008 announced a plan to do more research in a new ethnic group in Vietnam. It is Pa Kô, also called Pa Cô, Pa Kô, Pa-Kô or Pa Kôh. This ethnic group settles mainly in A Lưới suburban district (Thừa Thiên-Huế) and mountainous area of Hướng Hóa (Quảng Trị). At present, however, they have been classified in Tà Ôi ethnic group.

Many of the local ethnic groups residing in mountain areas are known collectively in the West as Montagnard or Degar. One distinctive feature of highland ethnic minority groups in Vietnam is that they are colorfully attired whether at home, in the farm, traveling or in their home town.

Foreign expatriate workers are a small portion of the population, some settling permanently or through marriage. Many are migrants from neighboring Asian countries like China, though some are from the west. Today, 2,700 Americans live in Vietnam. Moreover, some descend from the French and other Europeans from the colonial period. However, most European descendants left after Vietnam gained independence.

<text>The Si La (also Sila or Syla) are an ethnic group of about 3,151 people living in northern Laos and another 600 living in two villages: Nậm Sin and Seo Hay of Lai Châu Province, Northwest region, Vietnam.

== Culture ==
The Si La people speak a Tibeto-Burman language closely related to Hani (Edmondson 2002). Their primary occupation is the cultivation of cereals, augmented by hunting and foraging. One of the most distinctive Si La customs is tooth painting: men traditionally painted their teeth red, while women painted theirs black. The custom is increasingly uncommon among the younger generation.

<text>The following is a list of ethnic groups in Laos.

==Classification==
Specialists are largely in agreement as to the ethnolinguistic classification of the ethnic groups of Laos. For the purposes of the 1995 census, the government of Laos recognized 149 ethnic groups within 47 main ethnicities. whereas the Lao Front for National Construction (LFNC) recently revised the list to include 49 ethnicities consisting of over 160 ethnic groups.

<text>Wesley Earl Craven (August 2, 1939 – August 30, 2015) was an American film director, screenwriter and producer. Amongst his prolific filmography, Craven worked primarily in the horror genre, particularly slasher films, where he mixed horror cliches with humor. Craven has been recognized as one of the masters of the horror genre.

Craven created the &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; franchise (1984–present), writing and directing the first film, co-writing and producing the third, &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot; (1987), and writing and directing the seventh, &quot;Wes Craven&#x27;s New Nightmare&quot; (1994). He directed the first four films in the &quot;Scream&quot; franchise (1996–2011). He directed cult classics &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot; (1977), the horror comedy &quot;The People Under the Stairs&quot; (1991), and psychological thriller &quot;Red Eye&quot; (2005). His other notable films include &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; (1982), &quot;The Serpent and the Rainbow&quot; (1988), &quot;Shocker&quot; (1989), &quot;Vampire in Brooklyn&quot; (1995), and &quot;Music of the Heart&quot; (1999).

Craven received several accolades across his career, which includes a Scream Award, a Sitges Film Festival Award, a Fangoria Chainsaw Award, and nominations for a Saturn Award. In 1995, he was honored by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films with the Life Career Award, for his accomplishments in the horror genre. In 2012, the New York City Horror Film Festival awarded Craven the Lifetime Achievement Award.

On August 30, 2015, aged 76, Craven died of a brain tumor at his home in Los Angeles.

==Early life==
Craven was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Caroline (née Miller) and Paul Eugene Craven. He was of English, Scottish, and German descent. He was raised in a strict Baptist family. From 1957 to 1963 Craven earned an undergraduate degree in English and psychology from Wheaton College in Illinois. During his senior year, he developed Guillain-Barré Syndrome which delayed his graduation by a few months. After his recovery, Craven went on to get his master&#x27;s degree in philosophy and writing from Johns Hopkins University.

In 1964–65, Craven taught English at Westminster College in New Wilmington, Pennsylvania, and was a humanities professor at Clarkson College of Technology (later named Clarkson University) in Potsdam, New York. He also taught at Madrid-Waddington High School in Madrid, New York. During this time, he purchased a used 16 mm film camera and began making short movies. His friend Steve Chapin informed him of a messenger position at a New York City film production co, where his brother, future folk-rock star Harry Chapin worked. Craven moved into the building where his friend Steve Chapin lived at 136 Hicks St. in Brooklyn Heights. His first creative job in the film industry was as a sound editor.

Recalling his early training, Craven said in 1994, &quot;Harry was a fantastic film editor and producer of industrials. He taught me the Chapin method [of editing]: &#x27;Nuts and bolts! Nuts and bolts! Get rid of the shit!&#x27;&quot; Craven afterwards became the firm&#x27;s assistant manager, and broke into film editing with &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Walk It Like You Talk It or You&#x27;ll Lose That Beat&quot; (1971).

==Career==
Craven had a letter published in the July 19, 1968, edition of &quot;Life&quot; praising the periodical&#x27;s coverage of contemporary rock music and offbeat performers such as Frank Zappa. Craven left the academic world for the more lucrative role of pornographic film director. In the documentary &quot;Inside Deep Throat&quot;, Craven says on camera he made &quot;many hardcore X-rated films&quot; under pseudonyms. While his role in &quot;Deep Throat&quot; is undisclosed, most of his early known work involved writing, film editing, or both.

Craven&#x27;s first feature film as director was &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot;, which was released in 1972. Craven expected the film to be shown at only a few theaters, which according to him &quot;gave me a freedom to be outrageous, and to go into areas that normally I wouldn&#x27;t have gone into, and not worry about my family hearing about it, or being crushed.&quot; Ultimately the movie was screened much more widely than he assumed, leaving him ostracized due to the content of the film.

After the negative experience of &quot;Last House&quot;, Craven attempted to move out of the horror genre, and began writing non-horror films with his partner Sean S. Cunningham, none of which attracted any financial backing. Finally, based on advice from a friend about the ease of filming in the Nevada deserts, Craven began to write a new horror film based on that locale. The resulting film, &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot;, cemented Craven as a &quot;horror film director&quot; with Craven noting, &quot;It soon became clear that I wasn&#x27;t going to do anything else unless it was scary&quot;.

Craven frequently collaborated with Sean S. Cunningham. In Craven&#x27;s debut feature, &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot;, Cunningham served as producer. They pooled all of their resources and came up with $90,000. Later, in Craven&#x27;s best-known film, &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; (1984), Cunningham directed one of the chase scenes, although he was not credited. Craven had a hand in launching actor Johnny Depp&#x27;s career by casting him in &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;, Depp&#x27;s first major film role.

&quot;Elm Street&quot; villain Freddy Krueger appeared with Cunningham&#x27;s Jason Voorhees in the 2003 slasher film &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;, produced by Cunningham with screenwriter Victor Miller credited as &quot;Character Creator&quot;. In the 2009 remake of &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot;, Cunningham and Craven share production credits.

Although known for directing horror/thriller films, he worked on two films which are outside this genre: &quot;Music of the Heart&quot; (1999) and &quot;Paris, je t&#x27;aime&quot; (2006) (as one of the 22 directors responsible for it). Craven designed the Halloween 2008 logo for Google and was the second celebrity personality to take over the YouTube homepage on Halloween. In the mid-1980s, Craven worked briefly in the television industry by directing seven episodes of the 1985 reboot of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, including an episode that was written by George R. R. Martin.

Craven created &quot;Coming of Rage&quot;, a five-issue comic book series, with &quot;30 Days of Night&quot; writer Steve Niles. The series was released in digital form in 2014 by Liquid Comics with a print edition scheduled for an October 2015 debut.

==Filmmaking==

=== Influences ===
Craven has cited filmmakers Ingmar Bergman, Luis Buñuel, Alfred Hitchcock, Federico Fellini, Jean Cocteau, and Francois Truffaut as among his major influences. Craven&#x27;s first film, &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot;, was conceived as a remake of Bergman&#x27;s &quot;The Virgin Spring&quot; (1960). The goat in the dream sequence at the beginning of &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; was included by Craven as a homage to Buñuel.

=== Style and themes ===

Craven&#x27;s works tend to explore the breakdown of family structures, the nature of dreams and reality, and often feature black humor and satirical elements. Ostensibly civilized families succumb to and exercise violence in &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; and &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot;. &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;, &quot;Shocker&quot;, and the &quot;Scream&quot; films address the process of addressing family trauma.

Several of Craven&#x27;s films are characterized by abusive familial relationships such as &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot;, &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;, &quot;The People Under the Stairs&quot;, and others. Families in denial are a common thread throughout his movies, an idea Craven openly discussed:

The blurring of the barrier between dreams and reality, sometimes called &quot;rubber-reality&quot;, is a staple of Craven&#x27;s style. &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;, for example, dealt with the consequences of dreams in real life. &quot;The Serpent and the Rainbow&quot; and &quot;Shocker&quot; portray protagonists who cannot distinguish between nightmarish visions and reality. Following &quot;New Nightmare&quot;, Craven increasingly explored metafictional elements in his films. &quot;New Nightmare&quot; has actress Heather Langenkamp play herself as she&#x27;s haunted by the villain of the film in which she once starred. At one point in the film, the audience sees on Craven&#x27;s word processor a script he&#x27;s written, which includes the conversation he just had with Langenkamp—as if the script were being written as the action unfolds.

In &quot;Scream&quot;, the characters frequently reference horror films similar to their situations and at one point Billy Loomis tells his girlfriend that life is just a big movie. This concept was emphasized in the sequels as copycat stalkers re-enact the events of a new film about the Woodsboro killings (Woodsboro being the fictional town where &quot;Scream&quot; is set) occurring in &quot;Scream&quot;.

=== Collaborators ===
Marianne Maddalena served as a producer on twelve of Craven&#x27;s films. After working on &quot;Wes Craven&#x27;s New Nightmare&quot;, Patrick Lussier became an editor on all of his features up to &quot;Red Eye&quot;. Craven tended to employ cinematographers Peter Deming, Mark Irwin and Jacques Haitkin on his films. With the exception of &quot;Music of the Heart&quot;, composer Marco Beltrami worked on all of Craven&#x27;s films from &quot;Scream&quot; to &quot;Scream 4&quot;. Although he usually wrote his own films, Craven worked with screenwriter Kevin Williamson regularly after &quot;Scream&quot;. Craven often used a number of the same actors on his projects including Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Robert Englund, Michael Berryman, Heather Langenkamp, and David Hess.

==Personal life==
Craven&#x27;s first marriage, to Bonnie Broecker, produced two children: Jonathan Craven (born 1965) and Jessica Craven (born 1968). Jonathan is a writer and director. Jessica was a singer-songwriter in the group the Chapin Sisters. The marriage ended in 1970.

In 1984, Craven married a woman who became known professionally as actress Mimi Craven. The two later divorced, with Wes Craven stating in interviews that the marriage dissolved after he discovered it &quot;was no longer anything but a sham.&quot; In 2004, Craven married Iya Labunka; she frequently worked as a producer on Craven&#x27;s films.

Craven was a birder. In 2010, he joined Audubon California&#x27;s board of directors. His favorite films included &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; (1968), &quot;The Virgin Spring&quot; (1960) and &quot;Red River&quot; (1948).

==Death==
Craven died of a brain tumor at his home in Los Angeles on August 30, 2015, aged 76.
Many actors and fellow directors paid tribute to him, including David Arquette, Adrienne Barbeau, Angela Bassett, Bruce Campbell, Heather Langenkamp, Neve Campbell, John Carpenter, Courteney Cox, Joe Dante, Johnny Depp, Robert Englund, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Lloyd Kaufman, Jamie Kennedy, Rose McGowan, Kristy Swanson, Edgar Wright, and Amanda Wyss. The tenth episode of the horror television series &quot;Scream&quot; and the fifth film in the franchise (2022) were dedicated in his memory.

Craven was buried at the Lambert&#x27;s Cove Cemetery in the town of West Tisbury on the island of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard in Massachusetts.
==Trivia==
The first scholarly collection of work dedicated to Craven was published by Edinburgh University Press in July 2023.

<text>Regulation is the management of complex systems according to a set of rules and trends. In systems theory, these types of rules exist in various fields of biology and society, but the term has slightly different meanings according to context. For example:
* in government, typically regulation (or its plural) refers to the delegated legislation which is adopted to enforce primary legislation; including land-use regulation
* in economy: regulatory economics
* in finance: Financial regulation
* in business, industry self-regulation occurs through self-regulatory organizations and trade associations which allow industries to set and enforce rules with less government involvement; and,
* in biology, gene regulation and metabolic regulation allow living organisms to adapt to their environment and maintain homeostasis;
* in psychology, self-regulation theory is the study of how individuals regulate their thoughts and behaviors to reach goals.

== Forms ==
Regulation in the social, political, psychological, and economic domains can take many forms: legal restrictions promulgated by a government authority, contractual obligations (for example, contracts between insurers and their insureds), self-regulation in psychology, social regulation (e.g. norms), co-regulation, third-party regulation, certification, accreditation or market regulation.

State-mandated regulation is government intervention in the private market in an attempt to implement policy and produce outcomes which might not otherwise occur, ranging from consumer protection to faster growth or technological advancement.

The regulations may prescribe or proscribe conduct (&quot;command-and-control&quot; regulation), calibrate incentives (&quot;incentive&quot; regulation), or change preferences (&quot;preferences shaping&quot; regulation). Common examples of regulation include limits on environmental pollution, laws against child labor or other employment regulations, minimum wages laws, regulations requiring truthful labelling of the ingredients in food and drugs, and food and drug safety regulations establishing minimum standards of testing and quality for what can be sold, and zoning and development approvals regulation. Much less common are controls on market entry, or price regulation.

One critical question in regulation is whether the regulator or government has sufficient information to make ex-ante regulation more efficient than ex-post liability for harm and whether industry self-regulation might be preferable. The economics of imposing or removing regulations relating to markets is analysed in empirical legal studies, law and economics, political science, environmental science, health economics, and regulatory economics.

Power to regulate should include the power to enforce regulatory decisions. Monitoring is an important tool used by national regulatory authorities in carrying out the regulated activities.

In some countries (in particular the Scandinavian countries) industrial relations are to a very high degree regulated by the labour market parties themselves (self-regulation) in contrast to state regulation of minimum wages etc.

=== Measurement ===
Regulation can be assessed for different countries through various quantitative measures. The Global Indicators of Regulatory Governance by World Bank&#x27;s Global Indicators Group scores 186 countries on transparency around proposed regulations, consultation on their content, the use of regulatory impact assessments and the access to enacted laws on a scale from 0 to 5. The V-Dem Democracy indices include the regulatory quality indicator. The QuantGov project at the Mercatus Center tracks the count of regulations by topic for United States, Canada, and Australia. The length of Code of Federal Regulations of the United States increased over time.

== History ==
Regulation of businesses existed in the ancient early Egyptian, Indian, Greek, and Roman civilizations. Standardized weights and measures existed to an extent in the ancient world, and gold may have operated to some degree as an international currency. In China, a national currency system existed and paper currency was invented. Sophisticated law existed in Ancient Rome. In the European Early Middle Ages, law and standardization declined with the Roman Empire, but regulation existed in the form of norms, customs, and privileges; this regulation was aided by the unified Christian identity and a sense of honor regarding contracts.

Modern industrial regulation can be traced to the Railway Regulation Act 1844 in the United Kingdom, and succeeding Acts. Beginning in the late 19th and 20th centuries, much of regulation in the United States was administered and enforced by regulatory agencies which produced their own administrative law and procedures under the authority of statutes. Legislators created these agencies to require experts in the industry to focus their attention on the issue. At the federal level, one of the earliest institutions was the Interstate Commerce Commission which had its roots in earlier state-based regulatory commissions and agencies. Later agencies include the Federal Trade Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, Civil Aeronautics Board, and various other institutions. These institutions vary from industry to industry and at the federal and state level. Individual agencies do not necessarily have clear life-cycles or patterns of behavior, and they are influenced heavily by their leadership and staff as well as the organic law creating the agency. In the 1930s, lawmakers believed that unregulated business often led to injustice and inefficiency; in the 1960s and 1970s, concern shifted to regulatory capture, which led to extremely detailed laws creating the United States Environmental Protection Agency and Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

<text>The Vampire Lestat (1985) is a vampire novel by American writer Anne Rice, the second in her &quot;Vampire Chronicles&quot;, following &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; (1976). The story is told from the point of view of the vampire Lestat de Lioncourt, while &quot;Interview&quot; is narrated by Louis de Pointe du Lac. 

The novel follows Lestat&#x27;s rise to fame as a 1980&#x27;s rockstar, his early experiences as a vampire, and his search for meaning and connection in his vampiric existence. It also offers some of Lestat&#x27;s perspective on the events of &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;, which has been published as an in-universe novel by the journalist, Daniel Molloy. 

==Plot summary==
The book opens in the 1980s, with Lestat coming out of the ground after a long sleep, awakened by the rock and roll band, Satan&#x27;s Night Out. He reveals his identity, but the band believes he is joking as, in this world, &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; is a published novel and they recognize his name from the book. As a response to Louis&#x27;s recollections, Lestat decides to publish his own autobiography and join the band. He hopes the attention will help him reunite with the vampires he&#x27;s loved, including Louis. He also craves the excitement of a potential human-vampire conflict as he reveals vampire secrets to the world. 

Lestat&#x27;s autobiography opens with his life as the youngest son of an impoverished noble family in the 18th century Auvergne countryside. His family is proud but poor and Lestat has few prospects. He longs to join a monastery to learn to read and improve himself, but is denied this education. As a teen, he becomes captivated by traveling actors and flees with a troupe, but his father and brothers catch and beat him. By age 20, Lestat is recognized as a talented hunter and is sent out to kill the wolves harassing their village. The wolves are numerous and his dogs and horse are killed in the fight with Lestat barely surviving. Lestat begins to spiral into an existential depression after this battle. His mother, Gabrielle, encourages him to connect with Nicolas de Lenfent, a tailor&#x27;s son who has recently returned from Paris. He does so, and he and Nicki connect over their hopes, despairs, and rebellious love for the arts. They run away to Paris, gaining jobs at a theater. Nicki is attempting to become a violinist but feels he began too late to be truly prodigious. Lestat meanwhile shines onstage, going from stage hand to ever greater roles and recognition for his charm. 

One of Lestat&#x27;s admirers in the audience turns out to be a centuries-old vampire, Magnus. Magnus has been hunting young men with Lestat&#x27;s build and coloring, looking for an heir to his powers. Magnus kidnaps Lestat from the bed he shares with Nicki and keeps him prisoner. Lestat calls to God for salvation and continually refuses the offer to be turned, but Magnus turns him into a vampire by force. Magnus then kills himself as the centuries have made him mad, but leaves Lestat with a vast fortune. Lestat is both horrified and exhilarated by his newfound abilities. He learns that he is able to mingle with humans, but he knows friends and family would recognize his changed nature. He avoids his loved ones, showering them with gifts as a means to compensate for his absence. At first, he tries to take victims whom he considers at least somewhat malicious, as he feels love for humanity even as he thrills in the intoxication of killing. Lestat struggles with loneliness as he watches Nicki and his theatre troupe from afar. Nicki maintains that Lestat was taken from their room, but the others are skeptical and suspect Lestat married rich. Lestat buys the theater and ensures they are provided for fully. Eventually, he cannot resist checking in on Nicki and the theatre, but he becomes overwhelmed by their scents and the possibility of taking them as victims. Delirious from the horror of his circumstances, Lestat reveals his powers on stage - sending the human audience into a panic. After this, he feels he is irreconcilably inhuman and that his attempts to be moral have been a sham. He begins taking innocent victims. All the while he is haunted by a mysterious supernatural presence that refuses to approach. 

Lestat&#x27;s mother, Gabrielle, dying of consumption, becomes suspicious as his letters no longer seem truly happy. She arrives in Paris to see Lestat for herself before she dies. To save her, Lestat transforms her into a vampire. Gabrielle takes to the freedom of vampirism immediately, shedding the feminine clothes and roles she never longed for to become almost a new being. The pair runs afoul of the Children of Darkness, a coven of devil-worshipping vampires led by Armand, who disapprove of their lifestyle of mingling with humanity and enjoying the pleasures of society. Armand&#x27;s coven attacks them but finds them challenging to capture. Armand then kidnaps Nicolas to force Lestat and Gabrielle to come to his rescue. Lestat learns that he and Gabrielle go against coven law in many ways, including their strength, as it is forbidden for an ancient vampire like Magnus to pass along his powers. After a heated debate, Lestat turns Armand&#x27;s coven to chaos by telling them their superstitions about serving Satan and avoiding churches are baseless and have no more evidence than his approach of living well. With the coven conflicted, Lestat escapes with Nicolas, who begs to become a vampire. Nicolas feels abandoned by Lestat and is suspicious that vampirism is a secret of the nobility that Lestat and Gabrielle hid from him. He is insistent that Lestat turn him, which Lestat reluctantly does. In drinking his blood Lestat sees that Nicki is full of emptiness and despair. 

Armand seeks Lestat out again, this time joining him at a ball and attempting to seduce him. Once he has Lestat&#x27;s attentions, he tries to drain him - but Lestat is surprisingly resilient and able to beat Armand. Armand begs to be allowed companionship with Lestat, Gabrielle, and Nicolas - telling him he has insights into the ancient vampires as he was made by a Roman vampire, Marius de Romanus. He also warns Lestat that he will never find true companionship by making other vampires - as a veil exists between the minds of makers and fledglings and fledglings inevitably resent their makers. Lestat refuses Armand, feeling that Armand&#x27;s need for purpose could not be fulfilled by him - and that Armand&#x27;s desperation for a doctrine to live by would consume them all. Lestat offers Armand the theater as a new home, as the cemetery where Armand based his coven is set to be demolished. Armand and Nicolas, along with the few vampires Armand allows to live from his prior coven, found the Theatre des Vampires. They begin to write and compose disturbing melodies and plays to perform in front of human audiences. Lestat cannot bear to see the corruption of the theatre he once saw as the embodiment of goodness and he and Nicki fight bitterly. Nicki scorns Lestat&#x27;s attempts at morality and generosity, considering Lestat ridiculous for attempting to retain morality as a deadly creature of darkness. Nicki commits to the theatre and Lestat decides to travel onwards with Gabrielle. 

Still compelled by the idea of Armand&#x27;s ancient maker, Marius, Lestat leaves messages carved into rock in numerous places while traveling, hoping Marius will see them. Lestat and Gabrielle voyage out of France for several years, though Lestat knows it cannot last as Gabrielle never craved motherhood and wishes to pursue her own ends. Lestat receives updates from the theatre, and learns that Nicki&#x27;s madness has spiraled beyond the control of the other vampires. They fear he will expose them. Severely depressed, Nicolas eventually commits suicide by throwing himself into a ceremonial bonfire. Lestat mourns Nicki, as well as his human brothers who have died in the French Revolution. Gabrielle tells Lestat she is ready to pursue her own travels, intending to go into deep jungles away from humanity and its norms. Lestat is a creature who loves cities, art, and humanity - and so they part. Lestat promises Gabrielle that he will live and not give up, but he is soon overcome by his losses and descends into the earth to sleep. He thinks about the human lives he is sparing by decaying underground. 

Lestat is awoken from his slumber by Marius, who takes him to his Mediterranean home. Marius shares his past with Lestat, and shows him the progenitors of all vampires—Those Who Must Be Kept—Akasha and Enkil. He tells of a catastrophe in which Akasha and Enkil were exposed to the sun. Because they are the root of all vampires, the sunlight hitting them burned and killed all but the oldest vampires of the world. Marius was made by one of these surviving vampires, in order to discover what had caused the calamity. Marius is able to get the story out of Akasha and Enkil&#x27;s former keeper, and he takes the King and Queen to safeguard them. Following the story, Marius warns Lestat not to disturb Akasha and Enkil but Lestat feels compelled to see them and takes Nicolas&#x27;s violin down to play. The music awakens them and Akasha feeds from Lestat as Lestat feeds from her. Enkil, furious, attacks and nearly kills Lestat. He is saved by Marius and sent away. Marius explains that he finds purpose in eternity by guarding these old ones, as well as in scholarly pursuits and a commitment to drinking the blood of evildoers. But he says Lestat is not able to stay with him and share these goals now. Marius advises him to live one &quot;human&quot; lifetime and make fledglings out of love to be his companions. Marius tells him that he was made too young, and without a strong foundation of a first human lifetime, he will not have the personal strength to endure immortality. 

The next section of the book briefly recounts the events of &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; from Lestat&#x27;s perspective. He shares his arrival in New Orleans, his love for Louis, and remorse at recklessly turning Claudia into a child vampire. He also gives conflicting accounts to Louis&#x27; statements, saying he generally kept to his goal of drinking from evildoers, but that Louis was too consumed with his own angst to pay much mind to Lestat&#x27;s motivations. Nevertheless, he feels Claudia was justified in her attempt to kill him, as Lestat&#x27;s domineering control and secrecy, combined with the selfish crime of committing Claudia to eternity in a helpless, 5 year old form, made their situation untenable. He states that he probably would&#x27;ve done the same in her position. After Claudia&#x27;s nearly successful attempt to murder him, Lestat reveals that he went to Armand in Paris to beg for powerful blood to heal his wounds. Armand refused and manipulated the weakened Lestat to give testimony against Claudia, who Armand believed should not exist as a child vampire and a burden to Louis. After the trial in which Claudia is destroyed, Armand lies by claiming that he has also destroyed Louis in the ensuing battle. Armand tells Lestat he has not forgiven his prior rejection and destruction of his coven from centuries ago and that Lestat was foolish to expect his help. He pushes Lestat out of a tower to incapacitate him. After recovering somewhat physically, Lestat returns to New Orleans, and gives another conflicting account to the end of &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;, saying he never spoke with Louis in his rotting house, only Armand. He wastes away reading novels and drinking from animals for several years, becoming a wraithlike creature, before going to sleep in the earth.

The book returns to the present, with Lestat and his band successfully launching their rock career. He receives several threats from other vampires but dismisses them and schedules a major concert to take place in San Francisco, On the eve of the concert, Louis tracks Lestat down to the remote home where he&#x27;s preparing with his band and they share a forgiving and romantic reunion. Louis has read Lestat&#x27;s autobiography during their time apart, just as Lestat read Louis&#x27;s &quot;Interview with the Vampire,&quot; so they arrive at a greater understanding of one another&#x27;s history and mindset. Lestat proceeds with the concert, with Louis accompanying him backstage and the two sharing a kiss before the show. However, the concert is attacked by vampires who oppose Lestat&#x27;s revelations about their nature and history. Louis and Lestat fight through the crowd, but are outnumbered. Mysteriously, the vampires attacking Louis and Lestat begin to burst into flames. Gabrielle drives in as she has been tracking Lestat&#x27;s recent rise to stardom and the three escape in her car. It is then revealed that Lestat&#x27;s concert has awakened Akasha, who burned the attacking vampires. The book ends on a cliffhanger, as Lestat feels Akasha arrive to kidnap him for some unknown purpose.

==Publication==
&quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; was released on October 31, 1985. Told from the point of view of Lestat, who was previously introduced in &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;, the novel explores the titular vampire&#x27;s backstory. &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; also reinforces and expands upon Rice&#x27;s vampire mythology, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Michiko Kakutani noted, &quot;We learn lots of &#x27;facts&#x27; about vampires and vampire culture. We learn that they cry tears of blood, that they&#x27;re capable of reading other people&#x27;s minds, that they can be destroyed by fire and sunlight. We learn that &#x27;no vampire may ever destroy another vampire, except that the coven master has the power of life and death over all of his flock&#x27;; and we learn that &#x27;no vampire shall ever reveal his true nature to a mortal and allow that mortal to live&#x27;.&quot;

In a 1985 interview, it was mentioned that the novel would soon be adapted into a film.

==Adaptations==

===&quot;Anne Rice&#x27;s The Vampire Lestat&quot;===
&quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; was adapted into a comic and released as a 12-part miniseries by Innovation Comics in 1990 and 1991. The comic, which was formally titled &quot;Anne Rice&#x27;s The Vampire Lestat&quot; and featured Daerick Gross and Mike Okamoto as lead artists, had a script adapted from the novel by Rice and Faye Perozich. In 1991 the entire series was published as a graphic novel by Ballantine.

===&quot;Queen of the Damned&quot;===
Parts of &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; and &quot;The Queen of the Damned&quot; were loosely adapted into the 2002 film, &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot;. The film was a critical failure, and disappointed some viewers. Rice herself dismissed the film. On her Facebook page, any time the subject was brought up, she repeatedly commented that &quot;The Queen of the Damned&quot; film is not something she could understand or embrace, that she encouraged them not to do the film and that it hurt her to see her work &quot;mutilated&quot; the way it was.

===&quot;Lestat: The Musical&quot;===
The novel formed the basis for the short-lived 2006 Broadway show &quot;Lestat.&quot; The musical, which was composed by Elton John and Bernie Taupin and written by Linda Woolverton, had a pre-Broadway tryout in California in late 2005 and ran for a total of 33 previews and 39 official performances at the Palace Theater in New York.

===Television===

In November 2016, Rice announced on Facebook that the rights to her novels were reverted to her despite earlier plans for other adaptations. Rice said that she and her son Christopher would be developing and executive producing a potential television series based on the novels. In April 2017, they teamed up with Paramount Television and Anonymous Content to develop a series. As of early 2018, Bryan Fuller was involved with the creation of a potential TV series based on the novels. On July 17, 2018, it was announced that the series was in development at streaming service Hulu and that Fuller had departed the production. As of December 2019, Hulu&#x27;s rights had expired and Rice was shopping a package including all film and TV rights to the series. In May 2020, it was announced that AMC had acquired the rights to &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Lives of the Mayfair Witches&quot; for developing film and television projects with Anne and Christopher Rice serving as executive producers on any projects developed.

&quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; premiered on October 2, 2022, and &quot;Mayfair Witches&quot; on January 8, 2023. The second season of &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; will include flashbacks to some of the events of &quot;The Vampire Lestat,&quot; including glimpses of Lestat&#x27;s life as an actor in the 18th century, his relationship with Nicolas, and his meeting and conflict with Armand. If renewed for future seasons, the show will continue to adapt material from &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; and subsequent novels in the series.

The show was renewed in June 2024 with the emphasis of adapting the novel and focusing on the character of Lestat. A teaser for the upcoming season was released in July 2024 following Comic Con, which showed Sam Reid as Lestat in his glam rockstar persona reciting the first few lines of the novel.

===Audiobooks===
There have been three audiobook adaptations of &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot;: a 1989 abridged version narrated by Michael York; a 1994 unabridged version narrated by Frank Muller; and a 2011 unabridged version narrated by Simon Vance.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; debuted at No. 9 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, spending a total of six weeks on the list. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Michiko Kakutani found Rice&#x27;s vampire mythology &quot;more compelling than the rest of the novel&quot;, and wrote, &quot;While Lestat&#x27;s not an unlikable vampire ... it&#x27;s hard to take his dilemmas all that seriously.&quot; &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; wrote that &quot;Rice dots Lestat&#x27;s tale with some marvelous chillers ... vampire bonanza in appropriate dark, humid, spider-web narrative—Rice&#x27;s specialty&quot; &quot;The Free Lance–Star&quot; wrote: &quot;“The Vampire Lestat” is tedious at times, especially when the vampires are arguing among themselves over their fundamental philosophy.&quot; &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; called the novel &quot;a masterpiece of the genre&quot;. Reviewing the audiobook adaptation, &quot;AudioFile&quot; wrote that &quot;the plot twists are difficult to follow at times&quot;.

Dave Langford reviewed &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #86, and stated that &quot;[Rice is] audacious enough to propound an acceptable &#x27;origin story&#x27; for vampirism, and to move from dark old Egyptian mysteries to the extremes of twentieth-century Dionysian ecstasy as Lestat gives his first live rock performance. Nice one.&quot;

<text>An autocatalytic set is a collection of entities, each of which can be created catalytically by other entities within the set, such that as a whole, the set is able to catalyze its own production. In this way the set &quot;as a whole&quot; is said to be autocatalytic. Autocatalytic sets were originally and most concretely defined in terms of molecular entities, but have more recently been metaphorically extended to the study of systems in sociology, ecology, and economics.

Autocatalytic sets also have the ability to replicate themselves if they are split apart into two physically separated spaces. Computer models illustrate that split autocatalytic sets will reproduce all of the reactions of the original set in each half, much like cellular mitosis. In effect, using the principles of autocatalysis, a small metabolism can replicate itself with very little high level organization. This property is why autocatalysis is a contender as the foundational mechanism for complex evolution.

Prior to Watson and Crick, biologists considered autocatalytic sets the way metabolism functions in principle, i.e. one protein helps to synthesize another protein and so on. After the discovery of the double helix, the central dogma of molecular biology was formulated, which is that DNA is transcribed to RNA which is translated to protein. The molecular structure of DNA and RNA, as well as the metabolism that maintains their reproduction, are believed to be too complex to have arisen spontaneously in one step from a soup of chemistry.

Several models of the origin of life are based on the notion that life may have arisen through the development of an initial molecular autocatalytic set which evolved over time. Most of these models which have emerged from the studies of complex systems predict that life arose not from a molecule with any particular trait (such as self-replicating RNA) but from an autocatalytic set. The first empirical support came from Lincoln and Joyce, who obtained autocatalytic sets in which &quot;two [RNA] enzymes catalyze each other’s synthesis from a total of four component substrates.&quot; Furthermore, an evolutionary process that began with a population of these self-replicators yielded a population dominated by recombinant replicators.

Modern life has the traits of an autocatalytic set, since no particular molecule, nor any class of molecules, is able to replicate itself. There are several models based on autocatalytic sets, including those of Stuart Kauffman and others.

==Formal definition==

===Definition===

Given a set M of molecules, chemical reactions can be roughly defined as pairs r = (A, B) of subsets from M:

 a1 + a2 + ... + ak → b1 + b2 + ... + bk

Let R be the set of allowable reactions. A pair (M, R) is a &quot;reaction system&quot; (RS).

Let C be the set of molecule-reaction pairs specifying which molecules can catalyze which reactions:

 C = {(m, r) | m ∈ M, r ∈ R}

Let F ⊆ M be a set of &quot;food&quot; (small numbers of molecules freely available from the environment) and R&#x27; ⊆ R be some subset of reactions. We define a closure of the food set relative to this subset of reactions ClR&#x27;(F) as the set of molecules that contains the food set plus all molecules that can be produced starting from the food set and using only reactions from this subset of reactions. Formally ClR&#x27;(F) is a minimal subset of M such that F ⊆ ClR&#x27;(F) and for each reaction r&#x27;(A, B) ⊆ R&#x27;:

 A ⊆ ClR&#x27;(F) ⇒ B ⊆ ClR&#x27;(F)

A reaction system (ClR&#x27;(F), R&#x27;) is &quot;autocatalytic&quot;, if and only if for each reaction r&#x27;(A, B) ⊆ R&#x27;:
# there exists a molecule c ⊆ ClR&#x27;(F) such that (c, r&#x27;) ⊆ C,
# A ⊆ ClR&#x27;(F).

===Example===

Let M = {a, b, c, d, f, g} and F = {a, b}. Let the set R contain the following reactions:

 a + b → c + d, catalyzed by g
 a + f → c + b, catalyzed by d
 c + b → g + a, catalyzed by d or f

From the F = {a, b} we can produce {c, d} and then from {c, b} we can produce {g, a} so the closure is equal to:

 ClR&#x27;(F) = {a, b, c, d, g}

According to the definition the maximal autocatalytic subset R&#x27; will consist of two reactions:

 a + b → c + d, catalyzed by g
 c + b → g + a, catalyzed by d

The reaction for (a + f) does not belong to R&#x27; because f does not belong to closure. Similarly the reaction for (c + b) in the autocatalytic set can only be catalyzed by d and not by f.

==Probability that a random set is autocatalytic==

Studies of the above model show that random RS can be autocatalytic with high probability under some assumptions. This comes from the fact that with a growing number of molecules, the number of possible reactions and catalysations grows even larger if the molecules grow in complexity, producing stochastically enough reactions and catalysations to make a part of the RS self-supported. An autocatalytic set then extends very quickly with growing number of molecules
for the same reason. These theoretical results make autocatalytic sets attractive for scientific explanation of the very early origin of life.

==Formal limitations==

Formally, it is difficult to treat molecules as anything but unstructured entities, since the set of possible reactions (and molecules) would become infinite. Therefore, a derivation of arbitrarily long polymers as needed to model DNA, RNA or proteins is not possible, yet. Studies of the RNA World suffer from the same problem.

==Linguistic aspects==

Contrary to the above definition, which applies to the field of Artificial chemistry,
no agreed-upon notion of autocatalytic sets exists today.

While above, the notion of catalyst is secondary insofar that only the set as
a whole has to catalyse its own production, it is primary in other definitions,
giving the term &quot;Autocatalytic Set&quot; a different emphasis. There, &quot;every&quot; reaction
(or function, transformation) has to be mediated by a catalyst. As a consequence,
while mediating its respective reaction, every catalyst &quot;denotes&quot;
its reaction, too, resulting in a self denoting system, which is interesting
for two reasons. First, real metabolism is structured in this manner.
Second, self denoting systems can be considered as an intermediate step
towards self describing systems.

From both a structural and a natural historical point of view, one can
identify the ACS as seized in the formal definition the more original
concept, while in the second, the reflection of the system in itself is
already brought to an explicit presentation, since catalysts represent
the reaction induced by them. In ACS literature, both concept are present,
but differently emphasised.

To complete the classification from the other side, generalised self
reproducing systems move beyond self-denotation. There, no
unstructured entities carry the transformations anymore, but structured,
described ones. Formally, a generalised self reproducing system consists
of two function, u and c, together with their descriptions Desc(u) and
Desc(c) along following definition:

 u : Desc(X) -&gt; X
 c : Desc(X) -&gt; Desc(X)

where the function &#x27;u&#x27; is the &quot;universal&quot; constructor, that constructs
everything in its domain from appropriate descriptions, while &#x27;c&#x27; is a copy
function for any description. Practically, &#x27;u&#x27; and &#x27;c&#x27; can fall apart into many subfunctions or catalysts.

Note that the (trivial) copy function &#x27;c&#x27; is necessary because though the universal constructor &#x27;u&#x27;
would be able to construct any description, too, the description it would base on, would in
general be longer than the result, rendering full self replication impossible.

This last concept can be attributed to von Neumann&#x27;s
work on self reproducing automata, where he holds a self description necessary for any
nontrivial (generalised) self reproducing system to avoid interferences. Von Neumann planned to design
such a system for a model chemistry, too.

==Non-autonomous autocatalytic sets==

Virtually all articles on autocatalytic sets leave open whether the sets are
to be considered autonomous or not. Often, autonomy of the sets is silently
assumed.

Likely, the above context has a strong emphasis on autonomous self replication
and early origin of life. But the concept of autocatalytic sets is really more general and
in practical use in various technical areas, e.g. where self-sustaining tool chains are
handled. Clearly, such sets are not autonomous and are objects of human agency.

Examples of practical importance of non-autonomous autocatalytic sets can be found e.g. in the field of compiler construction and in operating systems, where the self-referential nature of the respective constructions is explicitly discussed, very often as bootstrapping.

==Comparison with other theories of life==

Autocatalytic sets constitute just one of several current theories of life, including the chemoton of Tibor Gánti, the hypercycle of Manfred Eigen and Peter Schuster,
 the (&quot;M,R&quot;) systems of Robert Rosen, and the autopoiesis (or &quot;self-building&quot;) of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela. All of these (including autocatalytic sets) found their original inspiration in Erwin Schrödinger&#x27;s book &quot;What is Life?&quot; but at first they appear to have little in common with one another, largely because the authors did not communicate with one another, and none of them made any reference in their principal publications to any of the other theories. Nonetheless, there are more similarities than may be obvious at first sight, for example between Gánti and Rosen. Until recently there have been almost no attempts to compare the different theories and discuss them together.

==Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA)==

Some authors equate models of the origin of life with LUCA, the Last Universal Common Ancestor of all extant life. This is a serious error resulting from failure to recognize that L refers to the &quot;last&quot; common ancestor, not to the &quot;first&quot; ancestor, which is much older: a large amount of evolution occurred before the appearance of LUCA.

Gill and Forterre expressed the essential point as follows:
 LUCA should not be confused with the first cell, but was the product of a long period of evolution. Being the &quot;last&quot; means that LUCA was preceded by a long succession of older &quot;ancestors.&quot;

<doc id="153159" wikidata="Q567981" url="?curid=153159" title="Human Potential Movement">
<text>The Human Potential Movement (HPM) arose out of the counterculture of the 1960s and formed around the concept of an extraordinary potential that its advocates believed to lie largely untapped in all people. The movement takes as its premise the belief that the development of their &quot;human potential&quot; can contribute to a life of increased happiness, creativity, and fulfillment, and as a result such people will be more likely to direct their actions within society toward assisting others to release their potential. Adherents believe that the collective effect of individuals cultivating their own potential will be positive change in society at large.

==Roots==

The HPM has much in common with humanistic psychology in that Abraham Maslow&#x27;s theory of self-actualization strongly influenced its development. The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, founded in 1955 by Glenn Doman and Carl Delacato, was an early precursor to and influence on the Human Potential Movement, as is exemplified in Doman&#x27;s assertion that &quot;Every child born has, at the moment of birth, a greater potential intelligence than Leonardo da Vinci ever used.&quot;

In the middle of the 1960s, George Leonard did research across the United States on the subject of human potential for the magazine &quot;Look&quot;. In his research, he interviewed 37 psychiatrists, brain researchers, and philosophers on the subject of human potential. He found that &quot;Not one of them said we were using more than 10% of our capacity&quot;, a common misconception which has since been proven false.

During the course of his research, Leonard met Michael Murphy, a co-founder of the nascent Esalen Institute (established in 1962) that at the time was running educational programs for adults on the topic of &quot;human potentialities&quot;. Leonard and Murphy became close friends and together &quot;put forth the idea that there should be a human potential movement&quot;.

==Social influence==
HPM was regarded by some as being related to psychedelic culture such as hippies and the Summer of Love. According to author Andrew Grant Jackson, George Harrison&#x27;s adoption of Hindu philosophy and Indian instrumentation in his songs with the Beatles in the mid 1960s, together with the band&#x27;s highly publicised study of Transcendental Meditation, &quot;truly kick-started&quot; the Human Potential Movement.

As Elizabeth Puttick writes in the &quot;Encyclopedia of New Religions&quot;:

The human potential movement (HPM) originated in the 1960s as a counter-cultural rebellion against mainstream psychology and organised religion. It is not in itself a religion, new or otherwise, but a psychological philosophy and framework, including a set of values that have made it one of the most significant and influential forces in modern Western society.

==Authors and essayists==
Aristotle used the principles of potentiality and actuality to analyze causality, motion, biology, physiology, human psychology and ethics in his tractates on &quot;Physics&quot;, &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;, and &quot;De Anima&quot;.

Abraham Maslow published his concept of a hierarchy of needs in a paper in 1943. He argued that as people&#x27;s basic survival needs are met, so their desire to grow in mental and emotional dimensions increases. He also coined the term &quot;metamotivation&quot; to describe the motivation of people who go beyond the scope of the basic needs and strive for constant betterment.

Michael Murphy and Dick Price founded the Esalen Institute in 1962, primarily as a center for the study and development of human potential, and some people continue to regard Esalen as the geographical center of the movement .

Aldous Huxley gave lectures on the &quot;Human Potential&quot; at Esalen in the early 1960s. His writings and lectures on the mystical dimensions of psychedelics and on what he called &quot;the perennial philosophy&quot; were foundational. Moreover, his call for an institution that could teach the &quot;nonverbal humanities&quot; and the development of the &quot;human potentialities&quot; functioned as the working mission statement of early Esalen.

Christopher Lasch notes the impact of the human potential movement via the therapeutic sector: &quot;The new therapies spawned by the human potential movement, according to Peter Marin, teach that &quot;the individual will is all powerful and totally determines one&#x27;s fate&quot;; thus they intensify the &quot;isolation of the self&quot;.

George Leonard, a magazine writer and editor who conducted research for an article on human potential, became an important early influence on Esalen. Leonard claims that he coined the phrase &quot;Human Potential Movement&quot; during a brainstorming session with Michael Murphy, and popularized it in his 1972 book &quot;The Transformation: A Guide to the Inevitable Changes in Humankind&quot;. Leonard worked closely with the Esalen Institute afterwards, and in 2005 served as its president.

Martin Seligman emphasized positive psychology during his term as president of the APA beginning in 1998. Positive psychology focuses on cultivation of eudaimonia, an Ancient Greek term for &quot;the good life&quot; and the concept for reflection on the factors that contribute the most to a well-lived and fulfilling life, often using the terms subjective well-being and happiness interchangeably.

== In Europe==

Interest in Human Potential concepts is growing in Europe thanks to training courses aimed at managers, graduate students, and the unemployed, mainly funded by the European Union in public development courses in the 1980s and 90s. In these courses, modules such as communication skills, marketing, leadership and others in the &quot;soft skills&quot; area were embedded in the programs, and enabled the familiarization of most of the Human Potential concepts. A key role was played by &quot;EU Strategic objective 3, 4, and 5&quot; that explicitly included transversal key competences, such as learning to learn, a sense of initiative, entrepreneurship, and cultural awareness&quot;.

These training programs, lasting as much as 900 to 1200 hours aimed at enhancing creativity and innovation, including entrepreneurship, and contained at all levels of education and training Human Potential concepts. One of the core concepts, Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs, a theory of psychological health predicated on fulfilling innate human needs, became popular in Europe in the 80s mainly as a support to understanding consumer&#x27;s needs, and only after its use as a key marketing concept. Philip Kotler&#x27;s book &quot;Marketing Management&quot; was particularly influential in the 80s in popularizing several human potential concepts that were &quot;embedded&quot; in the book and entered in the working and management community.

Specifically targeted books on Human Potential have emerged in Europe and can be found in the works of specific authors. For the &quot;Anglo&quot; cultural area, the work of John Whitmore
contains a harsh critique of mainstream approaches to human potential as fast cures for self-improvement: &quot;Contrary to the appealing claims of The One Minute Manager, there are no quick fixes in business&quot;.

For the &quot;Latin&quot; cultural area, an early approach to Human Potential can be found in the work of Maria Montessori. Montessori&#x27;s theory and philosophy of education were influenced by the work of Jean Marc Gaspard Itard, Édouard Séguin, Friedrich Fröbel, Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. Her model emphasized autonomous learning, sensory exploration and training children in physical activities, empowering their senses and thoughts by exposure to sights, smells, and tactile experiences, and later included, problem solving.

<doc id="153161" wikidata="Q328341" url="?curid=153161" title="Robert Smithson">
<text>Robert Smithson (January 2, 1938 – July 20, 1973) was an American artist known for sculpture and land art who often used drawing and photography in relation to the spatial arts. His work has been internationally exhibited in galleries and museums and is held in public collections. He was one of the founders of the land art movement whose best known work is the &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; (1970).

==Early life and education==
Smithson was born in Passaic, New Jersey, and spent his childhood in Rutherford until he was nine. In Rutherford, the poet and physician William Carlos Williams was Smithson&#x27;s pediatrician. When Smithson was nine, his family moved to the Allwood section of Clifton. He studied painting and drawing in New York City at the Art Students League of New York from 1954 to 1956 and then briefly at the Brooklyn Museum Art School.

==Career==

===Early work===

He primarily identified as a painter during this time, and his early exhibited artworks had a wide range of influences, including science fiction, Catholic art and Pop art. He produced drawings and collage works that incorporated images from natural history, science fiction films, classical art, religious iconography, and pornography including &quot;homoerotic clippings from beefcake magazines&quot;. Paintings from 1959 to 1962 explored &quot;mythical religious archetypes&quot; and were also based on Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; such as the paintings from 1959 &quot;Wall of Dis&quot; and &quot;The Inferno, Purgatory and Paradise&quot;, that correspond to the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;&#x27;s three-part structure.

After a break from the art world, Smithson reemerged in 1964 as a proponent of the minimalist movement. His new work abandoned the preoccupation with the body that had been common in his earlier work, and he began to use glass sheet and neon lighting tubes to explore visual refraction and mirroring. His wall-mounted sculpture &quot;Enantiomorphic Chambers&quot; was made of steel and mirrors and created the optical effect of a &quot;pointless vanishing-point&quot;. Crystalline structures and the concept of entropy became of interest to him and informed a number of sculptures completed during this period, including &quot;Alogon 2&quot;, (1966) composed of ten units, the title of which refers to the Greek word for an unnamable, irrational number. Smithson&#x27;s interest in entropy led him to write about a future in which &quot;the universe will burn out into an all-encompassing sameness&quot;. His ideas on entropy also addressed culture, &quot;the urban sprawl and the infinite number of housing developments of the post war boom have contributed to the architect of entropy&quot;. He called these urban/suburban sprawls &quot;slurbs.&quot; Smithson viewed entropy as a form of transformation of society and culture, which is shown in his artwork, for example, the non-site pieces. Smithson became affiliated with artists who were identified with the minimalist or Primary Structures movement, such as Nancy Holt (whom he married), Robert Morris and Sol LeWitt.

===Later work===
====Non-sites====
In 1967 Smithson began exploring industrial areas around New Jersey and was fascinated by the sight of dump trucks excavating tons of earth and rock that he described in an essay as the equivalents of the monuments of antiquity. This resulted in the series of &#x27;non-sites&#x27; in which earth and rocks collected from a specific area are installed in the gallery as sculptures, often combined with mirrors or glass. Works from this period include &quot;Eight-Part Piece (Cayuga Salt Mine Project)&quot; (1969) and &quot;Map of Broken Clear Glass (Atlantis)&quot; (1969). In September 1968, Smithson published the essay &quot;A Sedimentation of the Mind: Earth Projects&quot; in &quot;Artforum&quot; that promoted the work of the first wave of land art artists, and in 1969 he began producing land art pieces to further explore concepts gained from his readings of William S. Burroughs, J. G. Ballard, and George Kubler. The journeys he undertook were central to his practice as an artist, and his non-site sculptures often included maps and aerial photos of a particular location, as well as the geological artifacts displaced from those sites. Of these travels, several on-site works were produced including Mirror Displacements a series of photographs that illustrated his essay &quot;Incidents of Mirror Travels in the Yucatan&quot; (1969).

====Writings====
Smithson produced theoretical and critical writing in addition to visual art. In addition to essays his writings included visual-text formats such as the 2D paper work &quot;A Heap of Language&quot;, which sought to show how writing might become an artwork. In his essay &quot;Incidents of Mirror-Travel in the Yucatan&quot; Smithson documents a series of temporary sculptures made with mirrors at particular locations around the Yucatan Peninsula. Part travelogue, part critical rumination, the article highlights Smithson&#x27;s concern with the as a cornerstone of his work.

Other theoretical writings explore the relationship of a piece of art to its environment, from which he developed his concept of &quot;sites&quot; and &quot;non-sites&quot;. A &quot;site&quot; was a work located in a specific outdoor location, while a &quot;non-site&quot; was a work which could be displayed in any suitable space, such as an art gallery. &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; is an example of a sited work, while Smithson&#x27;s non-site pieces frequently consist of photographs of a particular location, often exhibited alongside some material (such as stones or soil) removed from that location.

As a writer, Smithson was interested in applying the Dialectical method and mathematical impersonality to art that he outlined in essays and reviews for &quot;Arts Magazine&quot; and &quot;Artforum&quot; and for a period was better known as a critic than as an artist. Some of Smithson&#x27;s later writings recovered 18th- and 19th-century conceptions of landscape architecture which influenced the pivotal earthwork explorations which characterized his later work. He eventually joined the Dwan Gallery, whose owner Virginia Dwan was an enthusiastic supporter of his work. In the late 1960s Smithson&#x27;s work was published in 0 to 9 magazine, an avant-garde publication which experimented with language and meaning-making.

====Frederick Law Olmsted&#x27;s influence====
Smithson&#x27;s interest in the is explored in his writings in part through the recovery of the ideas of the picturesque. His essay &quot;Frederick Law Olmsted and the Dialectical Landscape&quot; was written in 1973 after Smithson had seen an exhibition curated by Elizabeth Barlow Rogers at the Whitney Museum entitled &quot;Frederick Law Olmsted&#x27;s New York&quot; as the cultural and temporal context for the creation of his late-19th-century design for Central Park. In examining the photographs of the land set aside to become Central Park, Smithson saw the barren landscape that had been degraded by humans before Olmsted constructed the complex &#x27;naturalistic&#x27; landscape that was viscerally apparent to New Yorkers in the 1970s. Smithson was interested in challenging the prevalent conception of Central Park as an outdated 19th-century picturesque aesthetic in landscape architecture that had a static relationship within the continuously evolving urban fabric of New York City. In studying the writings of 18th- and 19th-century picturesque treatise writers Gilpin, Price, Knight and Whately, Smithson recovers issues of site specificity and human intervention as dialectic landscape layers, experiential multiplicity, and the value of deformations manifest in the picturesque landscape. Smithson further implies in this essay that what distinguishes the picturesque is that it is based on real land. For Smithson, a park exists as &quot;a process of ongoing relationships existing in a physical region&quot;. Smithson was interested in Central Park as a landscape which by the 1970s had weathered and grown as Olmsted&#x27;s creation, and was layered with new evidence of human intervention.

In revisiting the 18th- and early 19th-century treatises of the picturesque, which Olmsted interpreted in his practice, Smithson exposes threads of an anti-aesthetic anti-formalist logic and a theoretical framework of the picturesque that addressed the dialectic between the physical landscape and its temporal context. By re-interpreting and re-valuing these treatises, Smithson was able to broaden the temporal and intellectual context for his own work, and to offer renewed meaning for Central Park as an important work of modern art and landscape architecture.

====Industrial ruins and disrupted landscapes====
While Smithson did not find &quot;beauty&quot; in the evidence of abuse and neglect, he did see the state of things as demonstrative of the continually transforming relationships between humans and landscape. He claimed, &quot;the best sites for &#x27;earth art&#x27; are sites that have been disrupted by industry, reckless urbanization, or nature&#x27;s own devastation.&quot; Smithson became particularly interested in the notion of industrial decay within the spectrum of anti-aesthetic relationships which he saw present in the picturesque landscape. In his proposal to make process art out of the dredging of The Pond in Central Park, Smithson sought to insert himself into the dynamic evolution of the park. While in earlier 18th-century formal characterizations of the pastoral and the , something like a &quot;gash in the ground&quot; or pile of rocks, if encountered by a &quot;leveling improver&quot;, as described by Price, would have been smoothed over and the area terraformed into a more aesthetically pleasing contour. For Smithson, it was not necessary that the disruption become a visual aspect of a landscape; by his anti-formalist logic, more important was the temporal scar worked over by natural or human intervention. He saw parallels to Olmsted&#x27;s Central Park as a &quot;sylvan&quot; green overlay on the depleted landscape that preceded his Central Park Defending himself against allegations that he and other earth artists &quot;cut and gouge the land like Army engineers&quot;, Smithson, in his own essay, charges that one of such opinions &quot;failed to recognize the possibility of a direct organic manipulation of the land..&quot; and would &quot;turn his back on the contradictions that inhabit our landscapes&quot;.

==Significant works==
===&quot;Spiral Jetty&quot;===

&quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; (1970) is a work of land art in the form of a 1,500-foot-long (460 m), 15-foot-wide (4.6 m) counterclockwise spiral of local basalt rocks and mud, forming a jetty that juts from the shore of the Great Salt Lake near Rozel Point in Utah. Over the years it has accumulated a patina of salt crystals when the level of the lake is low. Some art historians consider the &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; to be the most important work by Smithson. He documented the construction of the sculpture in a 32-minute color film also titled &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot;. Smithson wrote that he deliberately chose the site due to its proximity to a derelict oil jetty. In later years oil and gas extraction has threatened the area.

===&quot;Partially Buried Woodshed&quot;===

&quot;Partially Buried Woodshed&quot; (1970) is an earthwork created at Kent State University in Kent, Ohio. The work consisted of a derelict woodshed on campus that he covered with earth until the central beam broke, illustrating the concept of entropy. By 2018, only a mound of dirt and the structure&#x27;s concrete foundation remain. An informational plaque is located in a small wooded area immediately behind the Liquid Crystal Institute building on the Kent State University main campus.

===&quot;Broken Circle/Spiral Hill&quot;===
In 1971 Smithson created &quot;Broken Circle/Spiral Hill&quot; in Emmen, the Netherlands as part of the Sonsbeek art festival. The subject of the 1971 Sonsbeek exhibition was &quot;Beyond Lawn and Order&quot; (Dutch: Buiten de perken). The &quot;Broken Circle&quot; earthwork was built in a quarry lake 10-to-15 feet deep. It was 140 feet in diameter, with the canal 12 feet wide, and built of white and yellow sand. The accompanying &quot;Spiral Hill&quot; is made of earth, black topsoil, and white sand, and is 75 feet in diameter at its base. The work is still being maintained and occasionally opened for visitors.

==Unrealized projects==
During his lifetime, Smithson created several proposals for projects that were unrealized, either due to their visionary nature, lack of support or their impracticality. Between 1966 and 1967 he produced &quot;Proposals for the Dallas-Fort Worth Regional Airport&quot; as concepts for &quot;aerial art&quot;, monumental-scaled earthworks to be seen by air travelers. In 1970 Smithson created a series of drawings for &quot;Floating Island: To Travel around Manhattan Island&quot;. The proposed project consisted of a barge containing broken concrete or glass to be pulled by a tugboat around Manhattan. Other versions of the project were of a barge filled with earth and planted with trees and other vegetation. In 1971 he drew &quot;Towards the Development of a &quot;Cinema Cavern&quot;&quot;, a design for a theater to be built inside a cave with spelunkers as the intended audience. In 1973 he designed the Bingham Canyon Reclamation Project, a visionary proposal for the copper pit mine in Utah owned by the Kennecott Copper Corporation. The mining company responded negatively to the proposal and it was never built.

==Collections==
The work of Robert Smithson is held in numerous public collections around the world including the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, the Tate Modern, London, the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, among others.

==Death and legacy==
On July 20, 1973, Smithson, a photographer and the pilot died in a light aircraft crash while inspecting the site of &quot;Amarillo Ramp&quot; on the ranch of Stanley Marsh 3 near Amarillo, Texas, in a Beechcraft Baron E55; the National Transportation Safety Board attributed the accident to the pilot&#x27;s failure to maintain airspeed, with distraction being a contributing factor. The work was subsequently completed by Smithson&#x27;s widow Nancy Holt, Richard Serra and Tony Shafrazi. It was originally built to rise from a shallow artificial lake, but the lake later dried up, and the earthwork has become overgrown and eroded.

Smithson has a following among many contemporary artists. Artists Tacita Dean, Sam Durant, Renée Green, Lee Ranaldo, Vik Muniz, Mike Nelson, and the Bruce High Quality Foundation have all made homages to Smithson&#x27;s works.

In 2017 the Holt/Smithson Foundation was founded to preserve, through public service, the investigative spirit of the two artists who &quot;developed innovative methods of exploring our relationship with the planet, and expanded the limits of artistic practice.&quot; The goal of the foundation is to &quot;increase awareness of both artists&#x27; creative legacies&quot;.
