<text>In condensed matter physics, a spin glass is a magnetic state characterized by randomness, besides cooperative behavior in freezing of spins at a temperature called the &quot;freezing temperature,&quot; &quot;T&quot;f. In ferromagnetic solids, component atoms&#x27; magnetic spins all align in the same direction. Spin glass when contrasted with a ferromagnet is defined as &quot;disordered&quot; magnetic state in which spins are aligned randomly or without a regular pattern and the couplings too are random. A spin glass should not be confused with a &quot;spin-on glass&quot;. The latter is a thin film, usually based on SiO2, which is applied via spin coating.

The term &quot;glass&quot; comes from an analogy between the &quot;magnetic&quot; disorder in a spin glass and the &quot;positional&quot; disorder of a conventional, chemical glass, e.g., a window glass. In window glass or any amorphous solid the atomic bond structure is highly irregular; in contrast, a crystal has a uniform pattern of atomic bonds. In ferromagnetic solids, magnetic spins all align in the same direction; this is analogous to a crystal&#x27;s lattice-based structure.

The individual atomic bonds in a spin glass are a mixture of roughly equal numbers of ferromagnetic bonds (where neighbors have the same orientation) and antiferromagnetic bonds (where neighbors have exactly the opposite orientation: north and south poles are flipped 180 degrees). These patterns of aligned and misaligned atomic magnets create what are known as frustrated interactions distortions in the geometry of atomic bonds compared to what would be seen in a regular, fully aligned solid. They may also create situations where more than one geometric arrangement of atoms is stable.

There are two main aspects of spin glass. On the physical side, spin glasses are real materials with distinctive properties, a review of which was published in 1982. On the mathematical side, simple statistical mechanics models, inspired by real spin glasses, are widely studied and applied.

Spin glasses and the complex internal structures that arise within them are termed &quot;metastable&quot; because they are &quot;stuck&quot; in stable configurations other than the lowest-energy configuration (which would be aligned and ferromagnetic). The mathematical complexity of these structures is difficult but fruitful to study experimentally or in simulations; with applications to physics, chemistry, materials science and artificial neural networks in computer science.

==Magnetic behavior==

It is the time dependence which distinguishes spin glasses from other magnetic systems.

Above the spin glass transition temperature, &quot;T&quot;c, the spin glass exhibits typical magnetic behaviour (such as paramagnetism).

If a magnetic field is applied as the sample is cooled to the transition temperature, magnetization of the sample increases as described by the Curie law. Upon reaching &quot;T&quot;c, the sample becomes a spin glass, and further cooling results in little change in magnetization. This is referred to as the &quot;field-cooled&quot; magnetization.

When the external magnetic field is removed, the magnetization of the spin glass falls rapidly to a lower value known as the &quot;remanent&quot; magnetization.

Magnetization then decays slowly as it approaches zero (or some small fraction of the original value this remains unknown). This decay is non-exponential, and no simple function can fit the curve of magnetization versus time adequately. This slow decay is particular to spin glasses. Experimental measurements on the order of days have shown continual changes above the noise level of instrumentation.

Spin glasses differ from ferromagnetic materials by the fact that after the external magnetic field is removed from a ferromagnetic substance, the magnetization remains indefinitely at the remanent value. Paramagnetic materials differ from spin glasses by the fact that, after the external magnetic field is removed, the magnetization rapidly falls to zero, with no remanent magnetization. The decay is rapid and exponential.

If the sample is cooled below &quot;T&quot;c in the absence of an external magnetic field, and a magnetic field is applied after the transition to the spin glass phase, there is a rapid initial increase to a value called the &quot;zero-field-cooled&quot; magnetization. A slow upward drift then occurs toward the field-cooled magnetization.

Surprisingly, the sum of the two complicated functions of time (the zero-field-cooled and remanent magnetizations) is a constant, namely the field-cooled value, and thus both share identical functional forms with time, at least in the limit of very small external fields.

==Edwards–Anderson model==
This is similar to the Ising model. In this model, we have spins arranged on a formula_1-dimensional lattice with only nearest neighbor interactions. This model can be solved exactly for the critical temperatures and a glassy phase is observed to exist at low temperatures. The Hamiltonian for this spin system is given by:

: formula_2

where formula_3 refers to the Pauli spin matrix for the spin-half particle at lattice point formula_4, and the sum over formula_5 refers to summing over neighboring lattice points formula_4 and formula_7. A negative value of formula_8 denotes an antiferromagnetic type interaction between spins at points formula_4 and formula_7. The sum runs over all nearest neighbor positions on a lattice, of any dimension. The variables formula_8 representing the magnetic nature of the spin-spin interactions are called bond or link variables.

In order to determine the partition function for this system, one needs to average the free energy formula_12 where formula_13, over all possible values of formula_8. The distribution of values of formula_8 is taken to be a Gaussian with a mean formula_16 and a variance formula_17:

: formula_18

Solving for the free energy using the replica method, below a certain temperature, a new magnetic phase called the spin glass phase (or glassy phase) of the system is found to exist which is characterized by a vanishing magnetization formula_19 along with a non-vanishing value of the two point correlation function between spins at the same lattice point but at two different replicas:

: formula_20

where formula_21 are replica indices. The order parameter for the ferromagnetic to spin glass phase transition is therefore formula_22, and that for paramagnetic to spin glass is again formula_22. Hence the new set of order parameters describing the three magnetic phases consists of both formula_24 and formula_22.

Under the assumption of replica symmetry, the mean-field free energy is given by the expression:

: formula_26

==Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model==
In addition to unusual experimental properties, spin glasses are the subject of extensive theoretical and computational investigations. A substantial part of early theoretical work on spin glasses dealt with a form of mean-field theory based on a set of replicas of the partition function of the system.

An important, exactly solvable model of a spin glass was introduced by David Sherrington and Scott Kirkpatrick in 1975. It is an Ising model with long range frustrated ferro- as well as antiferromagnetic couplings. It corresponds to a mean-field approximation of spin glasses describing the slow dynamics of the magnetization and the complex non-ergodic equilibrium state.

Unlike the Edwards–Anderson (EA) model, in the system though only two-spin interactions are considered, the range of each interaction can be potentially infinite (of the order of the size of the lattice). Therefore, we see that any two spins can be linked with a ferromagnetic or an antiferromagnetic bond and the distribution of these is given exactly as in the case of Edwards–Anderson model. The Hamiltonian for SK model is very similar to the EA model:

: formula_27

where formula_28 have same meanings as in the EA model. The equilibrium solution of the model, after some initial attempts by Sherrington, Kirkpatrick and others, was found by Giorgio Parisi in 1979 with the replica method. The subsequent work of interpretation of the Parisi solution—by M. Mezard, G. Parisi, M.A. Virasoro and many others—revealed the complex nature of a glassy low temperature phase characterized by ergodicity breaking, ultrametricity and non-selfaverageness. Further developments led to the creation of the cavity method, which allowed study of the low temperature phase without replicas. A rigorous proof of the Parisi solution has been provided in the work of Francesco Guerra and Michel Talagrand.

=== Phase diagram ===

When there is a uniform external magnetic field of magnitude formula_29, the energy function becomesformula_30Let all couplings formula_31 are IID samples from the gaussian distribution of mean 0 and variance formula_32. In 1979, J.R.L. de Almeida and David Thouless found that, as in the case of the Ising model, the mean-field solution to the SK model becomes unstable when under low-temperature, low-magnetic field state.

The stability region on the phase diagram of the SK model is determined by two dimensionless parameters formula_33. Its phase diagram has two parts, divided by the &quot;de Almeida-Thouless curve&quot;, The curve is the solution set to the equationsformula_34The phase transition occurs at formula_35. Just below it, we haveformula_36At low temperature, high magnetic field limit, the line isformula_37

==Infinite-range model==
This is also called the &quot;p-spin model&quot;. The infinite-range model is a generalization of the Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model where we not only consider two-spin interactions but formula_38-spin interactions, where formula_39 and formula_40 is the total number of spins. Unlike the Edwards–Anderson model, but similar to the SK model, the interaction range is infinite. The Hamiltonian for this model is described by:

: formula_41

where formula_42 have similar meanings as in the EA model. The formula_43 limit of this model is known as the random energy model. In this limit, the probability of the spin glass existing in a particular state depends only on the energy of that state and not on the individual spin configurations in it.
A Gaussian distribution of magnetic bonds across the lattice is assumed usually to solve this model. Any other distribution is expected to give the same result, as a consequence of the central limit theorem. The Gaussian distribution function, with mean formula_44 and variance formula_45, is given as:

: formula_46

The order parameters for this system are given by the magnetization formula_24 and the two point spin correlation between spins at the same site formula_22, in two different replicas, which are the same as for the SK model. This infinite range model can be solved explicitly for the free energy in terms of formula_24 and formula_22, under the assumption of replica symmetry as well as 1-Replica Symmetry Breaking.

: formula_51

==Non-ergodic behavior and applications==
A thermodynamic system is ergodic when, given any (equilibrium) instance of the system, it eventually visits every other possible (equilibrium) state (of the same energy). One characteristic of spin glass systems is that, below the freezing temperature formula_52, instances are trapped in a &quot;non-ergodic&quot; set of states: the system may fluctuate between several states, but cannot transition to other states of equivalent energy. Intuitively, one can say that the system cannot escape from deep minima of the hierarchically disordered energy landscape; the distances between minima are given by an ultrametric, with tall energy barriers between minima. The participation ratio counts the number of states that are accessible from a given instance, that is, the number of states that participate in the ground state. The ergodic aspect of spin glass was instrumental in the awarding of half the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics to Giorgio Parisi.

For physical systems, such as dilute manganese in copper, the freezing temperature is typically as low as 30 kelvins (−240 °C), and so the spin-glass magnetism appears to be practically without applications in daily life. The non-ergodic states and rugged energy landscapes are, however, quite useful in understanding the behavior of certain neural networks, including Hopfield networks, as well as many problems in computer science optimization and genetics.

==Spin-glass without structural disorder==

Elemental crystalline neodymium is paramagnetic at room temperature and becomes an antiferromagnet with incommensurate order upon cooling below 19.9 K. Below this transition temperature it exhibits a complex set of magnetic phases that have long spin relaxation times and spin-glass behavior that does not rely on structural disorder.

==History==

A detailed account of the history of spin glasses from the early 1960s to the late 1980s can be found in a series of popular articles by Philip W. Anderson in &quot;Physics Today&quot;.

=== Discovery ===
In 1930s, material scientists discovered the Kondo effect, where the resistivity of nominally pure gold reaches a minimum at 10 K, and similarly for nominally pure Cu at 2 K. It was later understood that the Kondo effect occurs when a nonmagnetic metal contains a very small fraction of magnetic atoms (i.e., at high dilution).

Unusual behavior was observed in iron-in-gold alloy (Au&quot;Fe&quot;) and manganese-in-copper alloy (Cu&quot;Mn&quot;) at around 1 to 10 atom percent. Cannella and Mydosh observed in 1972 that Au&quot;Fe&quot; had an unexpected cusplike peak in the a.c. susceptibility at a well defined temperature, which would later be termed &quot;spin glass freezing temperature&quot;.

It was also called &quot;mictomagnet&quot; (micto- is Greek for &quot;mixed&quot;). The term arose from the observation that these materials often contain a mix of ferromagnetic (formula_53) and antiferromagnetic (formula_54) interactions, leading to their disordered magnetic structure. This term fell out of favor as the theoretical understanding of spin glasses evolved, recognizing that the magnetic frustration arises not just from a simple mixture of ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions, but from their randomness and frustration in the system.

=== Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model ===

Sherrington and Kirkpatrick proposed the SK model in 1975, and solved it by the replica method. They discovered that at low temperatures, its entropy becomes negative, which they thought was because the replica method is a heuristic method that does not apply at low temperatures.

It was then discovered that the replica method was correct, but the problem lies in that the low-temperature broken symmetry in the SK model cannot be purely characterized by the Edwards-Anderson order parameter. Instead, further order parameters are necessary, which leads to replica breaking ansatz of Giorgio Parisi. At the full replica breaking ansatz, infinitely many order parameters are required to characterize a stable solution.

== Applications ==
The formalism of replica mean-field theory has also been applied in the study of neural networks, where it has enabled calculations of properties such as the storage capacity of simple neural network architectures without requiring a training algorithm (such as backpropagation) to be designed or implemented.

More realistic spin glass models with short range frustrated interactions and disorder, like the Gaussian model where the couplings between neighboring spins follow a Gaussian distribution, have been studied extensively as well, especially using Monte Carlo simulations. These models display spin glass phases bordered by sharp phase transitions.

Besides its relevance in condensed matter physics, spin glass theory has acquired a strongly interdisciplinary character, with applications to neural network theory, computer science, theoretical biology, econophysics etc.

Spin glass models were adapted to the folding funnel model of protein folding.

<doc id="148556" wikidata="Q2117272" url="?curid=148556" title="Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers">
<text>Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers were an American rock band formed in Gainesville, Florida, in 1976. The band originally comprised lead singer and rhythm guitarist Tom Petty, lead guitarist Mike Campbell, keyboardist Benmont Tench, drummer Stan Lynch and bassist Ron Blair. In 1982, Blair, weary of the touring lifestyle, departed the band. His replacement, Howie Epstein, remained with the band for the next two decades. In 1991, Scott Thurston joined the band as a multi-instrumentalist, primarily on rhythm guitar and secondary keyboard. In 1994, Steve Ferrone replaced Lynch on drums. Blair returned to the Heartbreakers in 2002, the year before Epstein&#x27;s death. The band had a long string of hit singles, including &quot;Breakdown&quot;, &quot;American Girl&quot; (both 1976), &quot;Refugee&quot; (1979), &quot;The Waiting&quot; (1981), &quot;Learning to Fly&quot; (1991), and &quot;Mary Jane&#x27;s Last Dance&quot; (1993), among many others, that stretched over several decades of work.

Although Petty was insistent that the band&#x27;s musical style be referred to as simply rock and roll, the Heartbreakers&#x27; music was characterized as both Southern rock and heartland rock, cited alongside artists such as Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger, and John Mellencamp as progenitors of the latter genre, which arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s. While the heartland rock movement waned in the 1990s, the band remained active and popular, touring regularly until Petty&#x27;s death in 2017, after which the Heartbreakers disbanded. Their final studio album, &quot;Hypnotic Eye&quot;, was released in 2014.

The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002, their first year of eligibility. Although most of their material was produced and performed under the name &quot;Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers&quot;, Petty released three solo albums, the most successful of which was &quot;Full Moon Fever&quot; (1989). In these releases, some members of the band contributed as collaborators, producing and performing as studio musicians.

==History==
===Early years and first two albums (1974–1978)===

As a teenager, Tom Petty joined or formed several bands in his hometown of Gainesville, Florida, included the Sundowners and the Epics, with Petty playing guitar and bass and singing as needed. In 1970, he and fellow North Central Florida resident Mike Campbell (lead guitar) formed Mudcrutch, with Benmont Tench (keyboards) joining in 1972. The band was a local success, eventually playing gigs across Florida, enjoying regular residences at popular clubs, and organizing music festivals at &quot;Mudcrutch Farm&quot;, a large empty lot adjacent to the small house where most band members lived. In 1974, Mudcrutch relocated to Los Angeles, California in attempt to gain the attention of a major record label. Leon Russell signed them to Shelter Records, but their 1975 debut single &quot;Depot Street&quot; failed to chart, and after failing to record another single to their label&#x27;s satisfaction, Mudcrutch disbanded.

Though Mudcrutch had dissolved, Petty remained attached to Shelter Records as a songwriter and solo artist, and in 1976, he reunited with Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench to form &quot;Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers&quot; along with fellow Gainesville expatriates Stan Lynch on drums and Ron Blair on bass. The Heartbreakers began their recording career with a self-titled album. Initially, the Heartbreakers did not gain much traction in the U.S., although they achieved early success in the UK after playing &quot;Anything That&#x27;s Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. While subsequent singles &quot;Breakdown&quot; and &quot;American Girl&quot; failed to sell in the US, the band continued to gain attention in the UK. Recalling the band&#x27;s brief British tour in 1976, Petty stated, &quot;The audience just jumped up and charged the stage and were boogieing their brains out. It was such a rush. Wow, we had never seen anything like that, man.&quot; &quot;Breakdown&quot; was re-released in the U.S. and became a Top 40 hit in 1978, after word filtered back of the band&#x27;s massive success in Britain, and perhaps more importantly after it featured on the extremely popular soundtrack to the 1978 film, &quot;FM&quot;. &quot;American Girl&quot; was covered in 1977 by Roger McGuinn on his &quot;Thunderbyrd&quot; LP.

Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers&#x27; second album, &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Get It!&quot; (1978), was their first gold record, and featured the singles &quot;I Need to Know&quot; and &quot;Listen To Her Heart&quot;. In 1979, the band was dragged into a legal dispute when ABC Records, Shelter&#x27;s distributor, was sold to MCA Records. Petty refused to be transferred to another record label and held fast to his principles, which led to his filing for bankruptcy as a tactic against MCA.

===Mainstream success (1979–1984)===
In 1979, after their legal dispute was settled, the Heartbreakers released their third album &quot;Damn the Torpedoes&quot; through MCA&#x27;s Backstreet label. The album rapidly went platinum. It included &quot;Don&#x27;t Do Me Like That&quot; (#10 U.S., the group&#x27;s first Top Ten single) and &quot;Refugee&quot; (#15 U.S.), their U.S. breakthrough singles.

Although he was already extremely successful, Petty again ran into record company trouble when he and the Heartbreakers prepared to release &quot;Hard Promises&quot; (1981), the follow-up album to &quot;Damn the Torpedoes&quot;. MCA wanted to release the record at the list price of $9.98. This so-called &quot;superstar pricing&quot; was a dollar more than the usual list price of $8.98. Petty voiced his objections to the price hike in the press, and the issue became a popular cause among music fans. Non-delivery of the album or naming it &quot;Eight Ninety-Eight&quot; were considered, but eventually MCA decided against the price increase. The album became a Top Ten hit, going platinum and spawning the hit single &quot;The Waiting&quot; (#19 U.S.). The album also included the duet &quot;Insider&quot;, with Stevie Nicks.

On their fifth album, &quot;Long After Dark&quot; (1982), bass player Ron Blair was replaced by Howie Epstein (formerly of Del Shannon&#x27;s backing band), giving the Heartbreakers their lineup until 1991. &quot;Long After Dark&quot; features the hits &quot;You Got Lucky&quot; (U.S. #20) and &quot;Change of Heart&quot; (U.S. #21), and was to feature a track called &quot;Keeping Me Alive&quot;, but producer Jimmy Iovine vetoed it from the album. Petty had expressed that he felt the album would have been more successful if &quot;Keeping Me Alive&quot; had been included.

===&quot;Southern Accents&quot; and &quot;Let Me Up (I&#x27;ve Had Enough)&quot; (1985–1988)===
On the sixth album, &quot;Southern Accents&quot; (1985), the Heartbreakers picked up where they had left off. The recording was not without problems; Petty became frustrated during the mixing process and broke his left hand when punching a wall. The album included the psychedelic-sounding hit single &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Around Here No More&quot; (#13 U.S.), which was produced by and co-written with Dave Stewart. The video for the single, which starred Stewart, featured Petty dressed as the Mad Hatter, mocking and chasing Alice from the book &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, then cutting and eating her as if she were a cake. This caused minor controversy after it was criticized by feminist groups, but the video did win an MTV Video Music Award.

A successful concert tour led to the live album &quot;Pack Up the Plantation: Live!&quot; (1985). The band&#x27;s live capabilities were also showcased when Bob Dylan invited the Heartbreakers to join him on his True Confessions Tour through Australia, Japan and the U.S. (1986) and Europe (1987). Petty praised Dylan, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t think there is anyone we admire more.&quot;

Also in 1987, the group released &quot;Let Me Up (I&#x27;ve Had Enough)&quot;, a studio album made to sound like a live recording, using a technique they borrowed from Dylan. It includes &quot;Jammin&#x27; Me&quot; (#18 U.S.), which Petty wrote with Dylan and Campbell. Dylan recorded a version of the Petty composition &quot;Got My Mind Made Up&quot; on his album &quot;Knocked Out Loaded&quot;, which was credited as being written by Dylan and Petty.

===Comeback and return to popularity (1989–2005)===
In 1989, Petty released his debut solo album &quot;Full Moon Fever&quot;, which included five singles (&quot;I Won&#x27;t Back Down&quot;, &quot;Runnin&#x27; Down a Dream&quot;, &quot;Free Fallin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; and &quot;Yer So Bad&quot;), and was accompanied by a tour with the Replacements. Two years later, the Heartbreakers released &quot;Into the Great Wide Open&quot;, produced by Jeff Lynne, who had worked with Petty in the Traveling Wilburys. Songs included the title track itself and &quot;Learning to Fly&quot;. Multi-instrumentalist Scott Thurston joined the band as of the tour for the album.
In 1993, Petty released &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, which included the hit single &quot;Mary Jane&#x27;s Last Dance&quot;. Stan Lynch had moved to Florida, but was persuaded to return for his last session with the band.

In 1994, Lynch left the band. Drummer Dave Grohl, formerly of the band Nirvana, sat in on a number of performances, but declined to join the band, instead choosing to pursue his own solo work which eventually grew into the band Foo Fighters. The band was now and for the next several years officially a quartet with no permanent drummer, but beginning in 1995 for live shows Steve Ferrone, formerly a session and touring musician who had played with numerous other acts, served as drummer. He had worked with Petty, Campbell, Tench, and Epstein on Petty&#x27;s solo album &quot;Wildflowers&quot;.

In 1995, a six-CD box-set titled &quot;Playback&quot; was released. Approximately half of the tracks were previously available on albums, and the rest were B-sides, demos and live tracks. Two notable tracks are a &quot;solo&quot; version of Petty&#x27;s 1981 duet with Stevie Nicks, &quot;Stop Draggin&#x27; My Heart Around&quot;, and the song &quot;Waiting for Tonight&quot;, which features vocals by the Bangles. The latter song also appeared on the two-CD anthology released in 2000, &quot;&quot;.

In 1996, Petty reunited with the Heartbreakers and released a soundtrack to the film &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot; starring Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Aniston, titled &quot;Songs and Music from &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot;&quot;. Three songs charted from the album: &quot;Walls (Circus)&quot; (featuring Lindsey Buckingham), &quot;Climb that Hill&quot;, and a song written by Lucinda Williams, &quot;Changed the Locks&quot;. The album also included a cover version of Beck&#x27;s song &quot;Asshole&quot;. Curt Bisquera, not an official member of the group, was the drummer on most of the album, with Ringo Starr substituting on one track and Ferrone playing on two others.

In 1999, Petty and the Heartbreakers released the album &quot;Echo&quot;, produced by Rick Rubin. The album reached number 10 in the U.S. album charts and featured, among other singles, &quot;Room at the Top&quot;. The band was still officially a four-piece (Petty, Campbell, Tench and Epstein), augmented by Ferrone on drums and Scott Thurston on various guitars, lap steel and ukulele. Both Ferrone and Thurston were promoted to full band membership after the album was released, and would remain Heartbreakers for the rest of the band&#x27;s existence.

On April 28, 1999, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located at 7018 Hollywood Boulevard, for their contributions to the recording industry.

In 2002, the group released &quot;The Last DJ&quot;. Many of the tracks&#x27; lyrics contain stinging attacks on the music industry and major record companies. The album reached number 9 in the U.S. charts. Bassist Ron Blair played on two of the tracks. He replaced Epstein, who had previously been Blair&#x27;s replacement, on the band&#x27;s 2002 tour as a result of Epstein&#x27;s deepening personal problems and drug abuse. Epstein died in 2003 at the age of 47.

===Final years (2006–2017)===

In the band&#x27;s thirtieth anniversary year, 2006, they headlined the fifth annual Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival. In addition to Bonnaroo, Petty was on tour throughout the summer of 2006. The tour started in Charlotte, North Carolina, on June 9 and ended in Randall&#x27;s Island, New York on August 19. Stops included major cities such as New York, St. Louis, Indianapolis, and Denver. Supporting acts during the tour included Pearl Jam, the Allman Brothers Band, and Trey Anastasio. Additionally, Stevie Nicks joined the band onstage during the first eight concerts as well as subsequent second-leg dates to perform various songs from the Heartbreakers&#x27; catalog. For the Highway Companion Tour, they offered a Highway Companion&#x27;s Club which allowed fans to receive priority seating, discounts at the Tom Petty Store, a complimentary CD of &quot;Highway Companion&quot; and a personalized email address.

In 2006, the ABC U.S. television network hired Petty to do the music for its NBA Playoffs coverage.

On September 21, 2006, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers received the keys to the city of Gainesville, Florida, where he and his bandmates either lived or grew up. Petty quipped, when questioned about the key he received from Gainesville&#x27;s mayor, &quot;It&#x27;s a lot nicer than the one we got in Chicago.&quot;

From July 2006 until 2007, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio featured an exhibit of Tom Petty items. Much of the content was donated by Petty himself from a visit to his home by some of the Rock Hall curatorial staff.

In 2007, the band accepted an invitation to participate in a tribute album to Fats Domino, contributing their version of &quot;I&#x27;m Walkin&#x27;&quot; to &quot;Goin&#x27; Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino&quot; (Vanguard).

In 2008, the Heartbreakers were also featured as the Super Bowl XLII halftime show. In April that year, the members of Petty&#x27;s previous band, Mudcrutch—Petty, Tench, and Campbell, along with Randall Marsh and Tom Leadon—released a Mudcrutch album. In late 2008, they released a live EP.

The band issued &quot;The Live Anthology&quot;, a collection of live recordings, on November 23, 2009, and announced a new studio album, &quot;Mojo&quot;, for release in the spring of 2010. The band released &quot;Hypnotic Eye&quot; on July 29, 2014, and archive recordings from their Playlist box set &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Children&quot; and &quot;Through the Cracks&quot; digitally in 2015.

In 2017, the band embarked on a 40th Anniversary Tour of the United States. The tour began on April 20 in Oklahoma City and ended on September 25 with a performance at the Hollywood Bowl in Hollywood, California. The Hollywood Bowl concert, which became the Heartbreakers&#x27; final show, ended with a performance of &quot;American Girl&quot;.

===Petty&#x27;s death and aftermath (2017–present)===
Early in the morning on October 2, 2017, Petty was found unconscious in his home, not breathing, and in full cardiac arrest. Following premature media reports of his death, Petty died at the UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica, California. He was 66.

Though the group did not formally disband, Petty stated in his final interview, with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; a few days before his death, that the Heartbreakers would probably disband if one of its members died or became too ill to perform.

In April 2018, Campbell, Tench and Ferrone acted as the house band for the Light Up the Blues benefit concert in Los Angeles, backing Beck, Neil Young, Patti Smith, and Stephen Stills, with whom they performed Petty&#x27;s &quot;I Won&#x27;t Back Down&quot;. That same month, it was announced that Campbell (along with Neil Finn) had joined Fleetwood Mac to replace lead guitarist Lindsey Buckingham.

In September 2023, Campbell, Tench and Ferrone backed Bob Dylan for a surprise performance at Farm Aid.

==Session work (1970s–2017)==

During the course of the band, the various members did session work for other notable artists. In 1981, Petty and Campbell wrote the lyrics to &quot;Stop Draggin&#x27; My Heart Around&quot;, which was intended as a Heartbreakers song. However, their producer Jimmy Iovine, who was also producing Stevie Nicks, suggested it be turned into a duet with her, and the band agreed, so the song ended up on her album &quot;Bella Donna&quot;. All the Heartbreakers except Ron Blair had performed on the track.

In the mid-1980s, former Eagle Don Henley teamed up with Campbell, Tench and Lynch for his 1984 album &quot;Building the Perfect Beast&quot;. Campbell wrote a demo version of the track &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot; and showed it to Petty, who both felt it did not fit &quot;Southern Accents&quot;, the album they were working on at the time. Iovine suggested recording it with Henley, with whom they re-recorded it after Henley changed the key. Henley collaborated with Campbell and Lynch for his 1989 album &quot;The End of the Innocence&quot;, with the two Heartbreakers producing it alongside the likes of Danny Kortchmar and Bruce Hornsby. Campbell again wrote one of the hits from the album, &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot;.

In 1986, Bob Dylan wrote and recorded the track &quot;Band of the Hand&quot; as the theme song for the Paul Michael Glaser film of the same title. On the recording, Dylan is backed by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, with a group of backing singers including Stevie Nicks, and the track is credited to &quot;Bob Dylan and the Heartbreakers&quot;.

Stan Lynch went on to produce Henley&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;Inside Job&quot; and 2015 album &quot;Cass County&quot;. He also contributed to the Eagles&#x27; 1994 reunion album, &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot;, playing percussion and having a hand in its production.

Lynch and Campbell played alongside Henley on Warren Zevon&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Sentimental Hygiene&quot;.

Mike Campbell played slide guitar on &quot;6th Avenue Heartache&quot;, released in 1996 by the Wallflowers. He recorded his guitar part without even meeting the band.

In the mid-1990s, members of the Heartbreakers teamed up to perform on Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;American Recordings&quot; series of albums. The entire band played on &quot;Unchained&quot;, save for Lynch, who had left in 1994. For &quot;Volume III&quot;, only Campbell and Petty contributed, the latter performing a duet with Cash on a cover of &quot;I Won&#x27;t Back Down&quot;. Tench and Campbell then contributed to &quot;Volume IV&quot;, &quot;Volume V&quot;, and &quot;Volume VI&quot;. In March 2014, Cash&#x27;s son had hinted that four or five more American albums may be released.

== Petty&#x27;s solo albums ==
Petty released three solo albums. The first was 1989&#x27;s &quot;Full Moon Fever&quot;, which included his signature tune, &quot;Free Fallin&#x27;&quot;, as well as &quot;I Won&#x27;t Back Down&quot;, later covered by Johnny Cash, &quot;Runnin&#x27; Down a Dream&quot; and Gene Clark&#x27;s Byrds classic &quot;I&#x27;ll Feel a Whole Lot Better&quot;.

The Heartbreakers were dismayed by Petty&#x27;s decision to go solo. Nevertheless, Campbell played guitar solos on every track, Tench contributed piano to one track, and Epstein provided backing vocals to two tracks.

Petty&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Wildflowers&quot;, included all Heartbreakers members except for Stan Lynch. The album, which featured Steve Ferrone on drums, produced the single &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know How It Feels&quot;.

Petty&#x27;s final solo album was &quot;Highway Companion&quot;. As with &quot;Full Moon Fever&quot;, it was produced by Jeff Lynne. Campbell was the lead guitarist for the album, but no other Heartbreaker participated in the recording, as all instruments and vocals were performed by Petty, Campbell, and Lynne.

==Relationship with music industry==
Petty fought against his record company on more than one occasion: first in 1979 over transference to another label, and then again in 1981 over the price of his record, which was (at that time) considered expensive. He was also outspoken on the current state of the music industry and modern radio stations, a topic that was a center concept of the lyrics of his 2002 album &quot;The Last DJ&quot; and its respective limited edition DVD.

In an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, Petty described himself as &quot;not really [being] involved in the business side of music&quot;.

<text>San José Mineta International Airport —officially Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport—is a city-owned public airport in San Jose, California. Located northwest of Downtown San Jose, the airport serves both the city and the Santa Clara Valley region of the greater Bay Area. It is named after San Jose native Norman Mineta, former United States Secretary of Transportation and United States Secretary of Commerce, who also served as Mayor of San Jose and as a San Jose City Councilman.

While San Jose is the largest city in the Bay Area, SJC is the Bay Area&#x27;s second-busiest airport by passenger boarding, behind San Francisco International Airport (SFO). In addition, the airport is also an official U.S. Customs and Border Protection international port of entry. It is situated three miles northwest of Downtown San Jose near the intersections of U.S. Route 101, Interstate 880, and State Route 87. In 2021, 54% of departing or arriving passengers at SJC flew on Southwest Airlines; Alaska Airlines was the second most popular airline, with about 19% of passengers.

== Overview ==
While San Jose is the largest city in the Bay Area by both population and area, SJC is the second-busiest of the three Bay Area airports by passenger count after SFO. SJC served 14.3 million passengers in 2018, surpassing its previous record of 14.2 million passengers set in 2001. Since 2012, SJC has experienced one of the fastest rates of seat capacity growth among major airports in the United States, reaching a peak of 15.7 million passengers in 2019.

SJC is near downtown San Jose (less than from the city center and easily within city limits), unlike SFO and OAK, which are around and from their downtowns. The location near downtown San Jose is convenient, but SJC is surrounded by the city and has little room for expansion. The proximity to downtown limits the height of buildings in downtown San Jose, to comply with FAA rules.

== History ==
=== Beginnings and expansion ===
In 1939, Ernie Renzel, a wholesale grocer and future mayor of San Jose, led a group that negotiated an option to buy of the Stockton Ranch from the Crocker family, to be the site of San Jose&#x27;s airport. Renzel led the effort to pass a bond measure to pay for the land in 1940. In 1945, test pilot James M. Nissen and two partners leased about of this land to build a runway, hangar and office building for a flight school. When the city of San Jose decided to develop a municipal airport, Nissen sold his share of the aviation business and became San Jose&#x27;s first airport manager. Renzel and Nissen were instrumental in the development of San Jose Municipal Airport over the next few decades, culminating with the 1965 opening of what later became Terminal C.

San Jose&#x27;s first airline flights were Southwest Airways Douglas DC-3s on the multistop run between San Francisco and Los Angeles, starting in 1948. Southwest changed its name to Pacific Air Lines and was the only airline at the airport until 1966, when Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) started flying Lockheed L-188 Electras nonstop from LAX and Boeing 727-100s later that year. SJC&#x27;s first airline jets were Pacific Air Lines Boeing 727-100 nonstops to LAX earlier in 1966; Pacific 727s flew nonstop to Las Vegas in 1967. Pacific also flew Fairchild F-27s to SJC, and merged with Bonanza Air Lines and West Coast Airlines to form Air West which was renamed Hughes Airwest, continuing at SJC with McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s before it merged into Republic Airlines (1979–1986). In 1968 United Airlines arrived, with Boeing 727 nonstops from Denver, Chicago and LAX, and Douglas DC-8 nonstops from New York and Baltimore.

The runway which became 12R/30L was until about 1962— Brokaw Rd was the northwest boundary of the airport. In 1964 it was , in 1965 it was , and a few years later it reached , where it stayed until around 1991. The two runways are now both in length.

In the early 1980s, the airport was one of the first in the country to participate in the noise regulation program enacted by the U.S. Congress for delineation of airport noise contours and developing a pilot study of residential sound insulation. This program showed that homes near the airport could be retrofitted cost-effectively to reduce indoor aircraft noise substantially.

=== 1988–2010: boom and bust ===
American Airlines opened a hub at San Jose in 1988, using slots it obtained in the buyout of AirCal (formerly Air California) in 1986. In 1990, Terminal A was opened to help accommodate the American operation. The company launched a flight to Tokyo using McDonnell Douglas DC-10s in March 1991. This was San Jose&#x27;s first direct link to Asia. The aircraft proved ill-suited for the route; the San Jose airport&#x27;s short runway prevented the planes from taking off with a full cabin and fuel tanks. Consequently, American replaced the DC-10s with McDonnell Douglas MD-11s.

In April 2001, American commenced a route to Paris, the airport&#x27;s first transatlantic flight. The airline operated the service with a Boeing 767. By the summer of that year, the airline served Paris, Taipei, and Tokyo nonstop from San Jose and had domestic flights to Austin, Boston, Denver, Honolulu, Las Vegas, Maui, Orange County, Portland, Phoenix, San Diego and Seattle.

After the September 11 attacks and the dot-com bubble burst in 2001, the city lost much of its service. Air Canada dropped its flights to Toronto and Ottawa, Canada, and American Airlines ended its nonstops to Taipei, Vancouver, and Paris. American also canceled service to Miami, St. Louis, Seattle/Tacoma, Portland (OR), Denver, Orange County (CA) and Phoenix; the airline&#x27;s flights to Los Angeles were downgraded to American Eagle regional flights.

In November 2001, the airport was renamed after Norman Y. Mineta, a native of San Jose, its former mayor and congressman, as well as both a former United States Secretary of Commerce and a United States Secretary of Transportation. That same month, the San Jose City Council approved an amended master plan for the airport that called for a three-phase, nine-year expansion plan. The plan, designed by Gensler and The Steinberg Group, called for a single, consolidated &quot;Central Terminal&quot; with 40 gates (four more than present), an international concourse and expanded security areas. The sail-shaped facade would greet up to 17.6 million passengers a year. A people mover system would link the new terminal with VTA light rail and the planned BART station next to the Santa Clara Caltrain station. Cargo facilities would be moved to the east side of the airport. A long term parking garage would be built where the rental car operations are now. A short term parking lot would be built on the site of Terminal C. On December 16, 2003, the San Jose Airport Commission named the airfield after former mayor Ernie Renzel and named the future Central Terminal after James Nissen. In August 2004, the city broke ground on the North Concourse, the first phase of the master plan.

The originally-approved master plan was scaled-back in 2005. The new two-phase plan called for a simplified Terminal B, rather than the initially proposed James Nissen Central Terminal, with a North Concourse to replace the aging Terminal C. In addition, Terminal A would be expanded for additional check-in counters, security checkpoints, and drop-off/pick-up curbside space. The new plan cost $1.3 billion, less than half of the original plan&#x27;s $3 billion. The first phase was completed on June 30, 2010, when Terminal B and the North Concourse officially opened for service. Planning for Phase II began in early 2018, with 6 additional gates to be added along with a new concourse extension at the south end of Terminal B.

Service reductions continued throughout the early 2000s. Alaska Airlines halted its Puerto Vallarta and Cabo San Lucas seasonal routes, Horizon Air ended its Tucson service and American Airlines ended its San Luis Obispo and Boston Logan links. Some additions still occurred. In October 2005, Hawaiian Airlines began daily nonstops to Honolulu. In October 2006, American Airlines ended the San Jose–Tokyo Narita route.

SJC suffered with many mid-tier airports during the 2008 rise in oil prices as airlines reduced marginal services. The airport lost much of its transcontinental U.S. service in the fall with Continental ending Newark flights, JetBlue ending Boston nonstops, and United ending flights to its Chicago–O&#x27;Hare and Washington Dulles hubs. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that between 2007 and 2009, SJC lost 22% of its seat capacity. Frontier Airlines pulled out of SJC in May 2010, citing lack of profitability on its single flight from the airport to Denver, Colorado. In August 2010, Mexicana Airlines also suspended all flights permanently due to bankruptcy.

=== 2010–2019: rebound in service ===
Beginning in 2010, service expanded at SJC for the first time in several years. Domestic carriers JetBlue Airways and Alaska Airlines added or adjusted service while international carrier Volaris began service in May 2010 with flights to Guadalajara, Mexico. Alaska subsequently expanded offerings to include those in Hawaii and Mexico. The decade saw rapid expansion for the airport. In 2012, Hawaiian Airlines added service to Maui. All Nippon Airways announced it would begin service between San Jose and Tokyo in 2012, restoring the link between the two cities that was lost when American Airlines ended service on the route in 2006. The airline used the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, making San Jose one of the first cities in the United States to see scheduled 787 flights. Due to delivery delays of its 787 aircraft, the airline postponed the launch of the route to early 2013.

In 2015 and 2016, several new international flights were launched. Hainan Airlines began nonstop flights from Beijing. British Airways commenced daily Boeing 787 Dreamliner service from London–Heathrow; Air Canada returned, providing flights from Vancouver operated by Air Canada Express. Later in 2017 and 2018, Volaris expanded its offerings to Mexico with service to Morelia, Leon, and Zacatecas. Not all international routes proved successful. Lufthansa connected SJC and Frankfurt on flights operated by Lufthansa CityLine Airbus A340-300 aircraft, Aeromexico started a daily flight to Guadalajara, and later added seasonal service to Mexico City, and Air China introduced Shanghai–Pudong flights with an Airbus A330-200, but Lufthansa and Air China ended service in 2018 while Aeromexico ceased both flights in January 2019, later resuming Guadalajara for the 2019–2020 winter holiday season.

In the wake of its acquisition of Virgin America, Alaska Airlines grew quickly at Mineta Airport as well as San Francisco International Airport between 2015 and 2018, adding intrastate cities like Orange County, Los Angeles, and San Diego, along with East Coast destinations Newark and New York–Kennedy. Alaska has designated SJC a focus city in several articles when announcing new destinations. Not all routes were successful, however, as service to Eugene, Burbank, and Dallas–Love ended in 2019, with Santa Ana, New York–Kennedy, and Tucson ending in 2020.

Other domestic carriers increased service or returned to the airport. Frontier Airlines resumed service to Denver and began flights to Las Vegas. Additional service to Austin, Atlanta, Cincinnati and San Antonio began in the spring of 2018 but did not return the next year. Delta Air Lines added service to its New York–Kennedy and Detroit hubs.

Southwest Airlines greatly expanded service from 2016 to 2020, connecting almost a dozen new cities across the country to SJC and added flights to Honolulu and Maui in May 2019.

=== 2020–present: COVID-19 pandemic and recovery ===
Beginning in March 2020, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on tourism severely curtailed the amount of passenger traffic and flights at the airport. From a high of 15.6 million passengers in 2019, only 4.7 million used the airport in 2020. Frontier Airlines and Hainan Airlines both ended service to SJC, while other airlines suspended or pared back many of their destinations, including all intercontinental service to Asia and Europe. Despite this large downturn in travel and drop in passenger demand, Alaska Airlines added flights to Palm Springs in 2021. Volaris also began a new route to Mexico City in November 2020. By June 2022, travel had recovered sufficiently that British Airways resumed its London–Heathrow service, and Japan Airlines–owned Zipair Tokyo announced new Tokyo–Narita service to begin that December. However, British Airways also announced that it would suspend flights to San Jose starting in October 2023; the airport ended the year with just over 12 million passengers, a number that failed to surpass 2017 levels. In 2024, JetBlue cancelled the airport&#x27;s last remaining route to the New York City area and later announced it would be closing SJC as a station entirely. American also ended its regional flights to Los Angeles on April 3, 2024.

== Facilities and aircraft ==
Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport covers at an elevation of . It has two active runways: 12L/30R and 12R/30L, each asphalt/concrete. The runway separation is less than ideal: 700 feet between centerlines.

In the year ending February 28, 2018, the airport had 181,686 aircraft operations, average 498 per day: 66% airline, 13% air taxi, 20% general aviation and &lt;1% military. 133 aircraft were then based at the airport: 46% single-engine, 12% multi-engine, 39% jet and 3% helicopter.

From 1960 to 2010, San Jose State University operated a flight-simulator facility for its aviation program in buildings at the southeast corner of the airport. The university has since moved to the Reid–Hillview Airport about 5 miles southeast.

== Terminals ==

There are two terminals at the airport, Terminal A, opened in 1990 and Terminal B opened in 2010. The terminals are connected airside. In 2009, the gates at the airport were renumbered in preparation for the addition of Terminal B. Gate A16B at the north end became Gate 1 and Gate A1A at the south end became Gate 16. The airport&#x27;s first modern terminal building, Terminal C, was opened in 1965 and was closed and demolished in 2010. Its location is now a short term parking lot but will be used for the second phase of Terminal B when that facility is constructed.

=== Terminal A ===
Terminal A has 17 gates: 1–7, 7A, and 8–16, serving American, Delta, Frontier, Hawaiian, Spirit, United, and Volaris. (Gate 7A is a ground-level gate for remote parking positions.)

Designed by a team of architects and engineers led by HTB, Inc., Terminal A, and its adjoining parking garage was originally designed and built in 1990 for American Airlines. The overall program was led by a joint team of San Jose Airport and Public Works staff known as the &quot;Airport Development Team&quot;. The project was awarded the Public Works Project of the Year by the California Council of Civil Engineers. It underwent extensive renovation and expansion in 2009, with larger ground-level ticketing counters, more curbside parking space, larger security checkpoints, and more concessions. The renovations and expansion were designed by Curtis W. Fentress, FAIA, RIBA of Fentress Architects.

The terminal includes an international arrivals building, which contains Gates 15 and 16. All arrivals from international flights at the airport must clear customs and immigration from this building (except for flights from airports with US border preclearance). Gates 17 and 18 in Terminal B were converted to handle international arrivals in early 2015.

The airport&#x27;s single lounge was an Admirals Club across from Gate 8 for American Airlines passengers operated as part of its hub operation. Along with the drawdown of the airline&#x27;s hub, it was closed in September 2010, with the airline citing rising costs and the cutbacks in its flight schedule. Terminal A now has two paid-entry lounges called &quot;The Club at SJC&quot; where passengers can wait for their flights and have access to snacks and beverages. Access to &quot;The Club at SJC&quot; is complimentary for passengers who have a Priority Pass card membership. One lounge is near the international gates and the other, opened at the end of 2019, has taken over and renovated part of the former Admirals Club.

=== Terminal B ===
Terminal B has 20 gates: 17–36, serving Southwest, Alaska, and Zipair Tokyo.

The concourse was designed by Gensler and built by Clark Construction, while the Terminal headhouse was designed by Fentress Architects with construction management by Hensel Phelps Construction Co. The terminal officially opened on June 30, 2010. Its design features dramatic daylit spaces, modern art, shared use ticket counters/gates, and chairs with power cords and USB ports on the armrests to charge laptops or handheld devices. The terminal earned a LEED Silver certification from the U.S. Green Building Council in 2010 in recognition of the airport&#x27;s significant commitment to environmentally sustainable design and construction.

The terminal has two international arrival gates: Gates 17 and 18. All arrivals from international flights at the airport must clear customs and immigration from the International Arrivals building (except for flights from airports with US border preclearance). Gates 17–23 of the new concourse were opened to the public on July 15, 2009. During this time, check-in, security, and baggage claim were all in Terminal A. Gates 24–28 were opened on June 30, 2010, along with Terminal B&#x27;s pre-security facilities.

In 2017, the airport added two gates, Gates 29 and 30, at the south end of the terminal. Due to the airport&#x27;s growth in recent years, a new temporary facility was added at the south end of the terminal that includes six additional gates as part of the $58 million project. Gates 31-35 opened June 13, 2019, and Gate 36 opened on November 1, 2019.

=== Former Terminal C ===

This terminal was built in 1965, before jet bridges (elevated corridors that connect planes to the terminal) became common at airports. Instead of using jet bridges, Terminal C mostly used airstairs. Some airlines, including Alaska Airlines and SkyWest Airlines, used turbo way ramps. In preparation for the construction of Terminal B, the north end of Terminal C was closed for demolition in December 2007. This part of the terminal was home to gates C14–C16, which housed Alaska Airlines, Horizon Air, and Frontier Airlines. The remaining portion of the terminal was reconfigured, including the addition of a new, larger, consolidated security checkpoint. The demolition of the north end occurred in February 2008, clearing the way for construction of Terminal B.

In December 2009, United Airlines, Continental Airlines and JetBlue moved to new or reconstructed gates in Terminal A, as the area within Terminal C containing the three airlines&#x27; gates was demolished. Other airlines operating at that time within Terminal C remained there until the North Concourse of Terminal B opened in June 2010. The Terminal C baggage claim was closed for demolition on February 2, 2010. This allowed for the completion of the airport&#x27;s new roadways. The terminal was officially closed on June 30, 2010. The remaining portions of the terminal were torn down in July 2010 and space the terminal occupied now serves as a surface parking lot.

== Accidents and incidents ==

* September 14–15, 1975 (1130 P – 130 A) – Continental Airlines – Boeing 727 (jet parked overnight). Fred Salomon, a 24-year-old resident of San Jose, had raped a woman, attempted to rob a store, stolen two vehicles, kidnapped a doctor and four others, then attempted to hijack a Continental Airlines Boeing 727 at what was then called San Jose Municipal Airport. The gunman had taken two airline mechanics hostage, demanding that they start the engines on the aircraft. As it started to roll towards the runway, the tires were shot out by police. Standing in the doorway of the jet with a hostage in front of him, while negotiating with police, the gunman pointed his gun at them and was shot and killed by a police sharpshooter, who was positioned on top of the Main Terminal (Terminal C).
* October 25, 1999 – San Jose Police Department McDonnell Douglas 500N helicopter N904PD lost control while entering the traffic pattern at SJC during a maintenance ferry flight. The helicopter crashed into a city street, killing both of the occupants. There were no reported damage or injuries on the ground. The NTSB determined that temporary repairs made in order to ferry the helicopter back to SJC actually made the controllability problem that was intended to be solved worse. Pilot manuals and training for the NOTAR (no tail rotor) helicopter did not provide adequate preparation for the pilot experienced in conventional helicopters to recover from a stuck thruster condition which occurred.
* April 21, 2014 – A teenage boy scaled a security fence and stowed away in the wheel well of a Hawaiian Airlines Boeing 767, surviving the five-hour flight to Maui. Congressman Eric Swalwell reiterated his call to scrutinize San Jose Airport&#x27;s security measures. An airport spokeswoman stated that the airport&#x27;s security &quot;meets and exceeds all federal requirements&quot; and &quot;our thoughts and prayers are with [the stowaway] and his family&quot;. She also noted that &quot;no system is 100 percent and it is possible to scale an airport perimeter fence line, especially under cover of darkness and remain undetected and it appears that&#x27;s what this teenager did.&quot;

== General aviation ==
Private and corporate aircraft are based on the west side of the airfield off Coleman Avenue.
*Atlantic Aviation
*AvBase, Inc.
*Signature Flight Support

The former General Aviation services were located on the south end of what is now runway 30R. Plane spotters and photographers now utilize the space where the San Jose State University Aviation Department was formerly located at the corner of Coleman Avenue and Airport Blvd.

<text>Samlesbury Hall is a historic house in Samlesbury, Lancashire, England, east of Preston. It was built in 1325 by Gilbert de Southworth (b. 1270), and was the primary home of the Southworth family until the early 17th century.

Samlesbury Hall may have been built to replace an earlier building destroyed during a raid by the Scots, during The Great Raid of 1322. The hall has been many things in its past including a public house and a girls&#x27; boarding school, but since 1925, when it was saved from being demolished for its timber, it has been administered by a registered charitable trust, the Samlesbury Hall Trust. This Grade I listed medieval manor house attracts more than 50,000 visitors each year.

Samlesbury Hall is open to the public daily except on Saturdays.

==History==
Before being owned by the Southworths, Samlesbury manor belonged to the d&#x27;Ewyas family.

Gilbert de Southworth of Warrington acquired half of the manor by marriage to Alice d&#x27;Ewyas and is credited with building the Great Hall around 1325. His great-grandson Thomas built the south-west wing. Southworth descendants held their part of the manor until 1677–78, when it was sold by Edward Southworth to Thomas Bradyll. Bradyll never lived at the hall but stripped much of its interior features to use at his main house of Conishead Priory at Ulverston. He then rented the hall out to handloom weavers before it was converted into the Bradyll Arms inn in 1830. The next owner was John Cooper, who bought the building in 1850 and leased it to Mrs Mary Ann Harrison as a co-educational boarding school. She established a Pestolozzian Institution at the hall, based on the ideas of the 18th-century Swiss educational reformer Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. The school was well ahead of its time and in some ways anticipated the better-known Montessori system by about fifty years.

Joseph Harrison, of Galligreaves Hall, a prominent Blackburn industrialist, substantially renovated the hall after he bought it in November 1862. William Harrison, Joseph&#x27;s eldest son, lived at the hall until 1879, when he committed suicide. A fall on the ice in January of that year caused traumatic injuries to William&#x27;s brain and a leg, resulting in extreme depression. His father, Joseph Harrison, died the next year at Galligreaves Hall, 18 February 1880, &quot;after a prolonged illness&quot;. Ownership of the hall then passed to Joseph&#x27;s youngest son, Henry, who resided in Blackburn. He was mayor of Blackburn in 1880–81 and became an Honorary Freeman of the Borough.

Although still owned by the Harrisons, the hall was tenanted for a number of years by Frederick Baynes and his family. Baynes was also a mayor of Blackburn, serving from 1896 to 1897. When Henry Harrison died in 1914, the estate of Samlesbury Hall was entailed to his nephew Mr. M. J. C. Johnston, son of Henry&#x27;s sister Agnes.

However, the hall had been left empty since 1909 until it was bought in 1924 by a building firm who intended to demolish it and build a housing estate. After money was raised by public subscription, the hall was purchased in 1925 and put in the hands of the Samlesbury Hall Trust, who have managed it since then.

==Architecture==
The hall was built with its solar end windows facing east, as was the practice. When the chapel was constructed 140 years later, it too was built to face east. However, when the chapel was connected to the main hall 60 years later, the angle of connection was less than 90° because of the solstice change in the Sun&#x27;s position over the years. The chapel was originally built by the Southworth family to upgrade the house to a manor house, which had to have a large household, a chapel and priest, a store of fish for Fridays, usually a pond and a water mill and a grain store. Therefore, Samlesbury Hall reflects the building styles and religious beliefs from the 14th century to the present day.

<text>A charitable trust is an irrevocable trust established for charitable purposes. In some jurisdictions, it is a more specific term than &quot;charitable organization&quot;. A charitable trust enjoys varying degrees of tax benefits in most countries and also generates goodwill. Some important terminology in charitable trusts includes the term &quot;corpus&quot; (Latin for &quot;body&quot;), referring to the assets with which the trust is funded, and the term &quot;donor,&quot; which is the person donating assets to a charity.

==India==
In India, trusts set up for social causes and approved by the Income Tax Department not only receive exemption from tax payment, but donors to such trusts can also deduct the donated amount from their taxable income. The legal framework in India recognizes activities such as &quot;relief of the poor, education, medical relief, preservation of monuments and the environment, and the advancement of any other object of general public utility&quot; as charitable purposes. Companies formed under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013, for promoting charity, also receive benefits under the law, including exemption from various procedural provisions of the Companies Act—either fully or partially—and are entitled to other exemptions that the Central Government may grant through its orders.

==Iran==
In the Islamic Republic of Iran, religious charitable trusts, or bonyads, constitute a substantial part of the country&#x27;s economy, controlling an estimated 20% of Iran&#x27;s GDP. Unlike some other Muslim-majority countries, the bonyads receive large

==United Kingdom==

In England and Wales, charitable trusts represent a form of express trust dedicated to charitable goals. There are several advantages to charitable trust status, including exemption from most forms of taxation and freedom for the trustees that is not found in other types of English trusts. For a charitable trust to be considered valid, the organization must demonstrate both a charitable purpose and a public benefit. Applicable charitable purposes are typically divided into four categories: trusts for relieving poverty, trusts for promoting education, trusts for advancing religion, and all other types of trusts recognized by the law. This also includes trusts for the benefit of animals and trusts for the benefit of a locality. Additionally, there is a requirement that the trust&#x27;s purposes benefit the public or a specific section of the public, rather than merely a group of private individuals.

Several circumstances render such trusts invalid. Charitable trusts are prohibited from operating for profit, and their purposes cannot be non-charitable unless these purposes are ancillary to the charitable goal. Furthermore, it is deemed unacceptable for charitable trusts to engage in campaigns for political or legal change. However, discussing political issues in a neutral manner is permissible. Charitable trusts, like other trusts, are administered by trustees, but there is no direct relationship between the trustees and the beneficiaries. This results in two key points: first, the trustees of a charitable trust have greater freedom to act than other trustees, and secondly, beneficiaries cannot take legal action against the trustees. Instead, the beneficiaries are represented by the Attorney General for England and Wales in their capacity as &quot;parens patriae&quot;, appearing on behalf of The Crown.

The jurisdiction over charitable disputes is equally shared between the High Court of Justice and the Charity Commission. The Commission, being the primary authority, is responsible for regulating and promoting charitable trusts. It also provides advice and opinions to trustees on administrative matters. In cases where the Commission detects mismanagement or maladministration, it has the authority to take actions against the trustees. This includes their removal, the appointment of new trustees, or even temporarily assuming control of the trust property to prevent harm. In instances where there are issues with a charity, the High Court can implement schemes that dictate the functioning of the charity.

==United States==
In the United States, many individuals use charitable trusts to leave all or a portion of their estate to charity when they die, both for philanthropic purposes and for certain tax benefits. Charitable trusts can be set up &quot;inter vivos&quot; (during a donor&#x27;s life) or as a part of a trust or will at death (testamentary). There are two basic types of US charitable trusts: charitable remainder trusts (CRT) and charitable lead trusts (CLT). Additionally, there is an Optimized Charitable Lead Annuity Trust (OCLAT) designed to maximize the tax and economic benefits for the contributor.

Charitable remainder trusts are irrevocable structures established by a donor to provide an income stream to the income beneficiary, while the public charity or private foundation receives the remainder value when the trust terminates. These &quot;split interest&quot; trusts are defined in §664 of the Internal Revenue Code and are normally tax-exempt. A Section 664 trust makes payments either of a fixed amount (charitable remainder annuity trust) or a percentage of trust principal (charitable remainder unitrust), to either the donor or another named beneficiary. If the trust qualifies under the IRS code, the donor may claim a charitable income tax deduction for their donation to the trust. Moreover, the donor might not need to pay an immediate capital gains tax when the trust disposes of the appreciated asset and purchases other income-generating assets to fund the trust. At the end of the trust term, which may be based on either lives or a term of years, the charity receives whatever amount is left in the trust. Charitable remainder unitrusts provide flexibility in the distribution of income and may be helpful in retirement planning, while charitable remainder annuity trusts paying a fixed dollar amount are more rigid and typically appeal to much older donors unconcerned about inflation&#x27;s impact on income distributions, and who are using cash or marketable securities to fund the trust. In some situations, the less complicated pooled income fund may be more suitable than the charitable remainder trusts.

Charitable lead trusts are the opposite of charitable remainder trusts and make payments to charity for the term of the trust. Similar to a charitable remainder trust, payments may be either a fixed amount (charitable lead annuity trust) or a percentage of trust principal (charitable lead unitrust). At the end of the trust term, the remainder can either go back to the donor or to heirs named by the donor. The donor may sometimes claim a charitable income tax deduction or a gift/estate tax deduction for making a lead trust gift, depending on the type of charitable lead trust. Generally, a non-grantor lead trust does not generate a current income tax deduction, but it eliminates the asset (or part of the asset&#x27;s value) from the donor&#x27;s estate.

<text>&quot;&quot; (; &#x27;Risen from the Ruins&#x27;) was the national anthem of East Germany during its existence from 1949 to 1990.

==Background==
In 1949, the Soviet occupation zone of Allied-occupied Germany became a socialist state under the name of the &quot;German Democratic Republic&quot; (GDR). For the nascent state&#x27;s national anthem, the poet Johannes Becher, who later became the East German Minister of Culture, wrote the lyrics. Two musicians, Ottmar Gerster and Hanns Eisler, proposed music to Becher&#x27;s lyrics, and Eisler&#x27;s version was selected.

==History==
Written in 1949, the East German national anthem reflects the early stages of German separation and the nation literally rising from the ruins after World War II, in which continuing progress towards reunification of the occupation zones was seen by most Germans as appropriate and natural. Consequently, Becher&#x27;s lyrics develop several connotations of &quot;unity&quot; and combine them with &quot;fatherland&quot; (&quot;&quot;), meaning Germany as a whole. However, this concept soon would not conform to an Cold War context, associated with the Berlin Wall and after 
the Berlin Wall had been erected in 1961 by the East German government.

In September 1973, East and West Germany were admitted to the United Nations simultaneously, following talks between the two governments that conferred a degree of mutual recognition. The term &quot;Germany&quot; was later removed from the East German constitution, and only the national anthem&#x27;s tune was played on official occasions. No new lyrics were ever written to replace Becher&#x27;s, which continued to be used unofficially, especially after &quot; in late 1989: once it became clear that the countries were actually moving towards reunification, East German television Deutscher Fernsehfunk reinstated the work and signed off every night with a joyous symphonic rendition of the vocal arrangement, with accompanying picturesque footage of East Germany&#x27;s main tourist attractions.

&quot; ceased to be a national anthem when the German Democratic Republic dissolved and its states joined the Federal Republic of Germany as a result of German reunification in 1990. &quot;Deutschlandlied&quot;, composed in 1841, became the national anthem of a united Germany again. East German Premier Lothar de Maizière had proposed that Becher&#x27;s lyrics be added to the united German national anthem, but this was rejected by his West German counterpart, chancellor Helmut Kohl.

At the end of its last broadcast on 2 October 1990, the East German international radio broadcaster Radio Berlin International signed off with a vocal version of the East German national anthem.

In November 1995, &quot;&quot; was played by mistake when German President Roman Herzog visited Brazil. This was the first event at which the anthem had been played since the German reunification.

<doc id="148576" wikidata="Q1139955" url="?curid=148576" title="Devolution">
<text>Devolution is the statutory delegation of powers from the central government of a sovereign state to govern at a subnational level, such as a regional or local level. It is a form of administrative decentralization. Devolved territories have the power to make legislation relevant to the area, thus granting them a higher level of autonomy.

Devolution differs from federalism in that the devolved powers of the subnational authority may be temporary and are reversible, ultimately residing with the central government. Thus, the state remains &quot;de jure&quot; unitary. Legislation creating devolved parliaments or assemblies can be repealed or amended by central government in the same way as any statute. In federal systems, by contrast, sub-unit government is guaranteed in the constitution, so the powers of the sub-units cannot be withdrawn unilaterally by the central government (i.e. not without the process of constitutional amendment). The sub-units therefore have a lower degree of protection under devolution than under federalism.

==Australia==
Australia is a federation. It has six states and two territories with less power than states.

The Australian Capital Territory refused self-government in a 1978 referendum, but was given limited self-government by a House of Assembly from 1979, and a Legislative Assembly with wider powers in 1988.

The Northern Territory refused statehood in a 1998 referendum. The rejection was a surprise to both the Australian and Northern Territory governments.

Territory legislation can be disallowed by the Commonwealth Parliament in Canberra, with one notable example being the NT&#x27;s short-lived voluntary euthanasia legislation.

==Canada==

Although Canada is a federal state, a large portion of its land mass in the north is under the legislative jurisdiction of the federal government (called territories, as opposed to provinces). This has been the case since 1870. In 1870 the Deed of Surrender or &#x27;Rupert&#x27;s Land and North-Western Territory Order&#x27; effected the admission of Rupert&#x27;s Land and the North-Western Territory to Canada, pursuant to section 146 of the Constitution Act, 1867 and the Rupert&#x27;s Land Act 1868. The Manitoba Act, 1870, which created Manitoba out of part of Rupert&#x27;s Land, also designated the remainder of both the Northwest Territories (NWT), over which Parliament was to exercise full legislative authority under the Constitution Act, 1871.

Yukon was carved from the Northwest Territories in 1898 but remained a territory. In 1905, the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were carved from the Northwest Territories. Portions of Rupert&#x27;s Land were added to the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, extending those provinces northward from their previous narrow band around the St. Lawrence and lower Great Lakes. The District of Ungava was a regional administrative district of Canada&#x27;s Northwest Territories from 1895 to 1912. The continental areas of said district were transferred by the Parliament of Canada with the adoption of the Quebec Boundary Extension Act, 1898 and the Quebec Boundaries Extension Act, 1912. The status of the interior of Labrador that was believed part of Ungava was settled in 1927 by the British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which ruled in favour of the Dominion of Newfoundland. The offshore islands to the west and north of Quebec remained part of the Northwest Territories until the creation of Nunavut in 1999.

Since the 1970s, the federal government has been transferring its decision-making powers to territorial governments. This means greater local control and accountability by northerners for decisions central to the future of the territories. In 1999, the federal government created Nunavut pursuant to a land claim agreement reached with Inuit, the indigenous people of Canada&#x27;s Arctic. Since that time, the federal government has slowly devolved legislative jurisdiction to the territories. Enabling the territories to become more self-sufficient and prosperous and to play a stronger role in the Canadian federation is considered a key component to development in Canada&#x27;s North. Among the three territories, devolution is most advanced in Yukon.

On June 18, 2021, Nunatsiavut, the Inuit self-government in Labrador, stated that it had begun the process of seeking devolution of child protection services from the Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Children, Seniors and Social Development with the goal for negotiations to conclude within three years.

===Northwest Territories===
The Northwest Territories (NWT) was governed from Ottawa from 1870 until the 1970s, except for the brief period between 1898 and 1905 when it was governed by an elected assembly. The Carrothers Commission was established in April 1963 by the government of Lester B. Pearson to examine the development of government in the NWT. It conducted surveys of opinion in the NWT in 1965 and 1966 and reported in 1966. Major recommendations included that the seat of government should be located in the territory. Yellowknife was selected as the territorial capital as a result. Transfer of many responsibilities from the federal government was recommended and carried out. This included responsibility for education, small business, public works, social services and local government. Since the report, the government of the Northwest Territories has taken over responsibilities for several other programs and services including the delivery of health care, social services, education, administration of airports, and forestry management. The legislative jurisdiction of the territorial legislature is set out in section 16 of the &quot;Northwest Territories Act&quot;.

Now, the government of Canada is negotiating the transfer of the Crown–Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada&#x27;s remaining provincial-type responsibilities in the NWT. These include the legislative powers, programs and responsibilities for land and resources associated with the department&#x27;s Northern Affairs Program (NAP) with respect to:

* Powers to develop, conserve, manage, and regulate of surface and subsurface natural resources in the NWT for mining and minerals (including oil and gas) administration, water management, land management and environmental management;
* Powers to control and administer public land with the right to use, sell or otherwise dispose of such land; and
* Powers to levy and collect resource royalties and other revenues from natural resources.

The Government of the Northwest Territories, the Aboriginal Summit and the Government of Canada have each appointed a Chief Negotiator to work on devolution. A Framework Agreement was concluded in 2004. The target date for the completion of devolution talks for the NWT was March 2007. However, stumbling blocks associated with the transfer of current federal employees to the territorial government, and the unresolved issue of how much money the Northwest Territories will receive for its resources has delayed the conclusion of a devolution agreement for the NWT.

===Nunavut===
In 1966, the federal government established the Carrothers Commission to look at the issue of government in the north. After extensive study and consultation, the Commission concluded that division of the NWT was probably both advisable and inevitable. There was a recognition that Northerners wanted to run their own affairs and must be given the opportunity to do so. At the same time, however, it noted that governmental reform was required before this could happen. It recommended the establishment of a new system of representative government. As a result, in the late 1960s and 1970s, the federal government gradually created electoral constituencies and transferred many federally run programs to the territorial government. Northerners took on more and more responsibility for the day-to-day running of their own affairs. In 1982 a plebiscite was held in the NWT asking the question, &quot;Do you think the NWT should be divided?&quot; Of the eligible voters 53 percent participated in the plebiscite, with 56.4 percent of them voting &quot;yes&quot;. Voter turnout and support for division was particularly strong in the Eastern Arctic. The Inuit population of the eastern section of the territory had become increasingly receptive of the idea of self-government. It was viewed as the best way to promote and protect their culture and traditions and address their unique regional concerns.

Both the NWT Legislative Assembly and the federal government accepted the idea of dividing the territory. The idea was viewed as an important step towards enabling the Inuit, and other residents of the Central and Eastern Arctic, to take charge of their own destiny. There were some reservations, however. Before action could be taken, certain practical considerations had to be addressed. First of all, outstanding land claims had to be settled. Second, all parties had to agree on a new boundary. Finally, all parties had to agree on the division of powers between territorial, regional and local levels of government. The various governments and native groups worked closely together to realize these goals. The &quot;Nunavut Land Claims Agreement&quot; was ratified by the Inuit in November 1992, signed by the Prime Minister of Canada on May 25, 1993, and passed by the Canadian Parliament in June of the same year. It was the largest native land claim settlement in Canadian history. It gave the Inuit title over . It also gave the Inuit capital transfers from the federal government of over $1.1 billion over the next 14 years. This money will be held in trust with the interest to be used in a variety of different projects, including financing for regional businesses and scholarships for students. The Inuit also gained a share of resource royalties, hunting rights and a greater role in managing the land and protecting the environment. The land claims agreement also committed the Government of Canada to recommend to Parliament legislation to create a new territory in the eastern part of the Northwest Territories.

While negotiations on a land claims settlement progressed, work was also taking place to determine potential jurisdictional boundaries for a new Eastern Territory. A proposal was presented to all NWT voters in a May 1992 plebiscite. Of those voting, 54 percent supported the proposed boundary. The Government of the Northwest Territories, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated (the Inuit claims organization) and the federal government formally adopted the boundary for division in the Nunavut Political Accord. The final piece of the equation fit into place on June 10, 1993, when the &quot;Nunavut Act&quot; received Royal Assent. It officially established the territory of Nunavut and provided a legal framework for its government. It fixed April 1, 1999, as the day on which the new territory would come into existence.

The government of Nunavut is currently negotiating with the government of Canada on a devolution agreement. Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, the organization of Inuit of Nunavut, is also a participant to negotiations to ensure that Inuit interests are represented.

Devolution over natural resources to the government of Nunavut moved forward with the appointment of a Ministerial Representative for Nunavut Devolution. The representative has held meetings with interested parties including the boards established under the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (NLCA), territorial and federal government departments in order to determine if devolution will occur and if so the future mandate of devolution. The government of Nunavut and Nunavut Tunngavik have appointed negotiators.

===Yukon===
In 1896, prospectors discovered gold in Yukon, which prompted a massive gold rush that saw the population of Yukon grow very rapidly. By 1898, Dawson grew into the largest Canadian city west of Winnipeg, with a population of 40,000. In response, the Canadian government officially established the Yukon Territory in 1898. The North-West Mounted Police were sent in to ensure Canadian jurisdiction and the &quot;Yukon Act&quot; provided for a commissioner to administer the territory. The 1898 statute granted the Commissioner in Council &quot;the same powers to make ordinances... as are possessed by the Lieutenant Governor of the North-west Territories, acting by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly thereof&quot;. In 1908 amendments to the &quot;Yukon Act&quot; transformed the Council into an elected body.

Over time the territorial government exercised expanded functions. Relevant developments include the following:

* By the mid-1960s, schools, public works, welfare, and various other matters of a local nature had come under territorial administration.
* Increased authority of elected Council members over the ensuing period contributed to significant changes in the Yukon Commissioner&#x27;s role. In 1979, instructions from the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (Minister) directed the Commissioner to allow elected members and the Executive Council to make important policy decisions, specifying that his/her actions should normally be based on the advice and taken with the consent of the elected Executive Council.
* As in the Northwest Territories, federal responsibilities were transferred to the Yukon government in the 1980s. In 1988 the Minister and the Yukon Government Leader signed a Memorandum of Understanding committing the parties to smooth the progress of devolution of remaining province-like responsibilities to the Yukon Government. Responsibilities transferred since then include fisheries, mine safety, intra-territorial roads, hospitals and community-health care, oil-and-gas and, most recently, natural resources.
* Discussion to transfer land- and resource-management responsibilities to the Yukon Government began in 1996, followed by a formal federal devolution proposal to the Yukon Government in January 1997. In September 1998 a Devolution Protocol Accord to guide devolution negotiations was signed. On August 28, 2001, a final draft of the Devolution Transfer Agreement was completed for consideration. The Yukon Devolution transfer Agreement was concluded on October 29, 2001, with the Government of Canada enabling the transfer of remaining province-like responsibilities for land, water and resource management to the Government of Yukon on April 1, 2003.

==Mexico==

===The Federal District===
All constituent states of Mexico are fully autonomous and comprise a federation. The Federal District, originally integrated by Mexico City and other municipalities, was created in 1824 to be the capital of the federation. As such, it was governed directly by the central or federal government and the president of Mexico appointed its governor or executive regent. Even though the municipalities within the Federal District were autonomous, their powers were limited. In 1928, these municipalities were abolished and transformed into non-autonomous or boroughs and a &quot;Central Department&quot;, later renamed as Mexico City. In 1970 this department was split into four new &quot;delegaciones&quot;, and Mexico City was constitutionally defined to be synonymous and coterminous with the entire Federal District. (As such, the boroughs of the Federal District are boroughs of Mexico City).

In the 1980s, the citizens of the Federal District, being the most populated federal entity in Mexico, began to demand home rule: a devolution of autonomy in order to directly elect their head of government and to set up a Legislative Assembly. In 1987, an Assembly of Representatives was created, by constitutional decree, whose members were elected by popular vote. The devolution of the executive power was not granted until 1997 when the first head of government was elected by popular vote. Finally, in 2000, power was devolved to the &quot;delegaciones&quot;, though limited: residents can now elect their own &quot;heads of borough government&quot; (&quot;jefes delegacionales&quot;, in Spanish), but the &quot;delegaciones&quot; do not have regulatory powers and are not constituted by a board of trustees, like the municipalities of the constituent states.

The autonomy, or home rule, of the Federal District, was granted by the federal government, which in principle has the right to remove it. The president of Mexico still holds the final word in some decisions (e.g. he must approve some posts), and the Congress of the Union reviews the budget of the Federal District and sets the limit to its debt.

Some left-wing groups and political parties have advocated, since the 1980s, for a full devolution of powers by transforming the Federal District into the thirty-second constituent state of the Federation (with the proposed name of &quot;State of the Valley of Mexico&quot;, to be distinguished from the state of México; another proposed name is &quot;State of the Anahuac&quot;).

===Indigenous peoples===
In a recent amendment to the Constitution of Mexico, the country was defined as a &quot;pluricultural nation&quot; founded upon the &quot;indigenous peoples&quot;. They are granted &quot;free-determination&quot; to choose the social, economic, cultural and political organization for which they are to elect representatives democratically in whatever manner they see fit, traditionally or otherwise, as long as women have the same opportunities to participate in their social and political life. There are, however, no prescribed limits to their territories, and they are still under the jurisdiction of the municipalities and states in which they are located; the indigenous peoples can elect representatives before the municipal councils. In practice, they are allowed to have an autonomous form of self-government, but they are still subject to the rights and responsibilities set forth by the federal constitution and the constitution of the states in which they are located.

==France==
In the late 1980s a process of decentralisation was undertaken by the French government. Initially regions were created and elected regional assemblies set up. Together with the departmental councils these bodies have responsibility for infrastructure spending and maintenance (schools and highways) and certain social spending. They collect revenues through property taxes and various other taxes. In addition a large part of spending is provided by direct grants to such authorities.

There also are groups calling for devolution or full independence for Occitania, the Basque Country, Corsica, Alsace, and Brittany.

==Spain==
The Spanish Constitution of 1978 granted autonomy to the &quot;nationalities&quot; and regions of which the Kingdom of Spain is composed. (See also &quot;autonomous communities and cities of Spain&quot;)

Under the &quot;system of autonomies&quot; (), Spain has been quoted to be &quot;remarkable for the extent of the powers peacefully devolved over the past 30 years&quot; and &quot;an extraordinarily decentralised country&quot;, with the central government accounting for just 18% of public spending; the regional governments 38%, the local councils 13% and the social-security system the rest.

In 2010 the Constitutional Court ruled that referendums of any kind, defined as measuring the public opinion of all voting citizens (&quot;apellatio ad populum&quot;) can&#x27;t be held without government approval.

On December 12, 2013, the Catalan Government announced that a referendum would be held on self-determination. The central government of Spain considers that a binding referendum is unconstitutional and cannot be held. On October 1, 2017, the regional government held a referendum despite having been declared illegal by the Spanish courts. Subsequently, several leaders were arrested and imprisoned on charges of &quot;sedition&quot; and &quot;rebellion&quot;. The regional president fled to Brussels, but has so far escaped extradition as those offenses are not part of Belgian law or the European Arrest Warrant. On December 21, 2017, fresh elections were held in which pro-independence parties held a slim majority and a broad coalition of constitutionalist parties expressed disappointment and concern for the future.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, devolved government was created for Northern Ireland in 1921 by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, for Wales and Scotland in September 1997 following simple majority referendums, and in London in May 1998. Between 1998 and 1999, the Scottish Parliament, Senedd (Welsh Parliament), Northern Ireland Assembly and London Assembly were established by law. The Campaign for an English Parliament, which supports English devolution (i.e. the establishment of a separate English parliament or assembly) was formed in 1998.

A referendum was held in Scotland on 18 September 2014 which asked citizens whether Scotland should be an independent country. By a margin of approximately 55 percent to 45 percent, people living in Scotland rejected the proposal. The leaders of the three largest British political parties pledged on 16 September 2014 a new devolution settlement for Scotland in the event of a No vote, promising to deliver &quot;faster, safer and better change&quot;, and as a result of this vote and promises made during the referendum campaign, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced plans to devolve additional powers to the Scottish government, the nature of which would be determined by the Smith Commission. These powers were subsequently transferred in the Scotland Act 2016. Following the outcome of the Brexit vote on 23 June 2016, calls for further devolution have been raised, including differential membership of the European single market for the devolved areas of the United Kingdom.

The Yorkshire Party is a regionalist political party in Yorkshire, a historic county of England. Founded in 2014, it campaigns for the establishment of a devolved Yorkshire Assembly within the UK, with powers over education, environment, transport and housing. In the 2021 West Yorkshire mayoral election, the Yorkshire Party came 3rd.

==United States==


In the United States the federal government and state governments are sovereign. As Native American tribes and the governments they formed pre-date the formation of the United States, their legal position as sovereigns co-exists alongside the individual states and the Federal government. The legal relationships with Native American tribes and their government structures are the jurisdiction of Congress. This relationship is unique to each of the more than 500 tribes and also involves International Treaties between various tribes and Spain, Great Britain, and the eventual United States.
Territories are under the direct jurisdiction of Congress. Territorial governments are thus devolved by acts of Congress. Political subdivisions of a state, such as a county or municipality, are a type of devolved government and are defined by individual state constitutions and laws.

===District of Columbia===

In the United States, the District of Columbia offers an illustration of devolved government. The District is separate from any state, and has its own elected government. In many ways, on a day-to-day basis, it operates much like another state, with its own laws, court system, Department of Motor Vehicles, public university, and so on. However, the governments of the 50 states are reserved a broad range of powers in the U.S. Constitution, and most of their laws cannot be voided by any act of U.S. federal government. The District of Columbia, by contrast, is constitutionally under the sole control of the United States Congress, which created the current District government by statute. Any law passed by the District legislature can be nullified by congressional action, and indeed the District government could be significantly altered or eliminated by a simple majority vote in Congress.

<text>Artificial radiation belts are radiation belts that have been created by high-altitude nuclear explosions.

The table above only lists those high-altitude nuclear explosions for which a reference exists in the open (unclassified) English-language scientific literature to persistent artificial radiation belts resulting from the explosion.

The Starfish Prime radiation belt had, by far, the greatest intensity and duration of any of the artificial radiation belts.

The Starfish Prime radiation belt damaged the United Kingdom Satellite Ariel 1 and the United States satellites, Traac, Transit 4B, Injun I and Telstar I.  It also damaged the Soviet satellite Cosmos V.  All of these satellites failed completely within several months of the Starfish detonation.

Telstar I lasted the longest of the satellites damaged by the Starfish Prime radiation, with its complete failure occurring on February 21, 1963.

In Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory report LA-6405, Herman Hoerlin gave the following explanation of the history of the original Argus experiment and of how the nuclear detonations led to the development of artificial radiation belts.



In 2010, the United States Defense Threat Reduction Agency issued a report that had been written in support of the United States Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse Attack. The report, entitled &quot;Collateral Damage to Satellites from an EMP Attack,&quot; discusses in great detail the historical events that caused artificial radiation belts and their effects on many satellites that were then in orbit. The same report also projects the effects of one or more present-day high-altitude nuclear explosions upon the formation of artificial radiation belts and the probable resulting effects on satellites that are currently in orbit.

<doc id="148584" wikidata="Q6486289" url="?curid=148584" title="Langley Park School for Girls">
<text>Langley Park School for Girls (also known as Langley Park Girls&#x27; School, LPGS, or just Langley Girls) is a girls&#x27; secondary academy school in Beckenham in the London Borough of Bromley, England, with a mixed-sex sixth form.

The school motto is &quot;Ad Rem Mox Nox&quot;, which roughly translates as &quot;Time is short, get to work&quot; or more specifically &quot;Get it done before nightfall&quot;. In the 1960s, the official translation of the motto was &quot;Work, for the night cometh&quot;.

==History==
The building at the school&#x27;s first location (on Lennard Road, Beckenham) was completed in 1914. It was, however, used as a military hospital during World War I.

The school itself opened on 28 September 1919 as Beckenham County School for Girls, with 153 pupils aged from 8 years, and 10 teachers. The first headmistress was Miss E.M. Fox. A few years later, an association for ex-pupils was formed, called the Adremian Association.

In 1945, the name of the school was changed to The County Grammar School for Girls, and in 1955 to Beckenham Grammar School for Girls. In 1959, the school moved to new buildings in a parkland setting, in Langley Park. The current name &quot;Langley Park School for Girls&quot; was adopted in 1968.

In 1976 the school became comprehensive. In 1996 it became a technology college, and in 2000 it became part of the South East England Virtual Education Action Zone.

In July 2009, the school celebrated its 50th anniversary during the last week of school in the summer. This included music, dancing and a commemorative event - bringing the Olympic torch into the school.

On 1 August 2011, the school gained academy status.

( or ) was the manager of the household of the Frankish king. He was the head of the Merovingian administrative ladder and orchestrated the operation of the entire court. He was appointed by the king from among the magnates, the most powerful families. Austrasia, Neustria and Burgundy had their own mayor of the palace. After Chlothar II, who ruled over the entire Frankish Kingdom, had ordered the execution of Warnachar, the mayor of Burgundy, the magnates of Burgundy declared in 626 not to want their own mayor anymore; see Fredegar IV.54. This declaration marks the effective end of the Burgundian court and the beginning of the Neustrian-Burgundian political alliance against Austrasian influence. The Austrasian magnates revolted and the Battle of Tertry of 687 became the Austrasian victory with Pepin of Herstal as their leader and the new mayor of the palace.

During the second half of the seventh century, the office evolved into the &quot;power behind the throne&quot;. At that time the mayor of the palace held and wielded the real and effective power to make decisions affecting the kingdom, while the kings were increasingly reduced to performing merely ceremonial functions, which made them little more than figureheads (, &#x27;do-nothing kings&#x27;). The office may be compared to that of the peshwa, , or prime minister, all of which have similarly been the real powers behind some ceremonial monarchs.

In 687, after victory over the western kingdom of Neustria, the Austrasian mayor, Pippin of Herstal, took the title Duke of the Franks to signify his augmented rule. His son and successor, Charles Martel, ruled without elevating a new king during the last four years of his reign (737–741). His sons Carloman and Pepin the Short elevated another Merovingian king, Childeric III, but he was eventually deposed in 751 by Pepin, who was crowned king in his place.

<text>The Battle of Borodino ( ) or Battle of Moscow (), in popular literature also known as the Battle of the Generals, took place near the village of Borodino on during Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia. The &#x27; fought against the [[Imperial Russian Army]], but failed to gain a [[decisive victory]] and suffered tremendous losses. [[Napoleon]] fought against General [[Mikhail Kutuzov]], whom the Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]] had appointed to replace [[Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly|Barclay de Tolly]] on after the [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|Battle of Smolensk]]. After the Battle of Borodino, Napoleon remained on the battlefield with his army; the Imperial Russian forces retreated in an orderly fashion southwards. Because the Imperial Russian army had weakened the&#x27;, they allowed the French occupation of Moscow, using scorched earth tactics on their own population to trap Napoleon and his men with their own largest city. The failure of the &quot;&quot; to completely destroy the Imperial Russian army, and in particular Napoleon&#x27;s reluctance to deploy his Imperial Guard due to Napoleon&#x27;s wishes to negotiate with Alexander to make him join against the British, has been widely criticised by historians as a large blunder, as it allowed the Imperial Russian army to continue its retreat into territory increasingly hostile to the French.

Approximately a quarter of a million soldiers were involved in the battle, and it was the bloodiest single day of the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon himself summed up the battle and its ambiguous outcome, writing, &quot;The French showed themselves worthy of victory and the Russians of being invincible.&quot;

==Background==
===Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia===

Napoleon with the French &quot;Grande Armée&quot; began his invasion of Russia on 24 June 1812 by crossing the Niemen.
As his Russian army was outnumbered by far, Mikhail Bogdanovich Barclay de Tolly successfully used a &quot;delaying operation&quot;, defined as an operation in which a force under pressure trades space for time by slowing down the enemy&#x27;s momentum and inflicting maximum damage on the enemy without, in principle, becoming decisively engaged, using a Fabian strategy as a defence in depth by retreating further eastwards into Russia without giving battle. 

After the Battle of Smolensk, the Tsar replaced the unpopular Barclay de Tolly with Kutuzov, who on 18 August took over the army at Tsaryovo-Zaymishche and ordered his men to prepare for battle. Kutuzov understood that Barclay&#x27;s decision to retreat had been correct, but the Tsar, the Russian troops and Russia could not accept further retreat. A battle had to occur in order to preserve the morale of the soldiers and the nation. He then ordered not another retreat eastwards but a search for a battleground eastwards to Gzhatsk on 30 August, thus using Barclay&#x27;s delaying operation again, by which time the ratio of French to Russian forces had shrunk from 3:1 to 5:4. The main part of Napoleon&#x27;s army had entered Russia with 286,000 men, but by the time of the battle was reduced mostly through starvation and disease.
Kutuzov&#x27;s army established a defensive line near the village of Borodino. Although the Borodino field was too open and had too few natural obstacles to protect the Russian center and the left flank, it was chosen because it blocked both Smolensk–Moscow roads and because there were simply no better locations. Starting on 3 September, Kutuzov strengthened the line with earthworks, including the Raevski redoubt (named after Nikolay Raevsky) in the center-right of the line and three open, arrow-shaped &quot;Bagration flèches&quot; (named after Pyotr Bagration) on the left.

===Battle of Shevardino===

The initial Russian position, which stretched south of the new Smolensk Highway (Napoleon&#x27;s expected route of advance), was anchored on its left by a pentagonal earthwork redoubt erected on a mound near the village of Shevardino. The Russian generals soon realized that their left wing was too exposed and vulnerable, so the Russian line was moved back from this position, but the Redoubt remained manned, Kutuzov stating that the fortification was manned simply to delay the advance of the French forces. Historian Dmitry Buturlin reports that it was used as an observation point to determine the course of the French advance. Historians Witner and Ratch, and many others, reported it was used as a fortification to threaten the French right flank, despite being beyond the effective reach of guns of the period.

The Chief of Staff of the Russian 1st Army, Aleksey Yermolov, related in his memoirs that the Russian left was shifting position when the French Army arrived sooner than expected; thus, the Battle of Shevardino became a delaying effort to shield the redeployment of the Russian left. The construction of the redoubt and its purpose is disputed by historians to this day.

The conflict began on September 5 when Marshal Joachim Murat&#x27;s French forces met Pyotr Konovnitsyn&#x27;s Russians in a massive cavalry clash, the Russians eventually retreating to the Kolorzkoi Cloister when their flank was threatened. Fighting resumed the next day but Konovnitsyn again retreated when Viceroy Eugène de Beauharnais&#x27; Fourth Corps arrived, threatening his flank. The Russians withdrew to the Shevardino Redoubt, where a pitched battle ensued. Murat led Nansouty&#x27;s First Cavalry Corps and Montbrun&#x27;s Second Cavalry Corps, supported by Compans&#x27;s Division of Louis-Nicolas Davout&#x27;s First Infantry Corps against the redoubt. Simultaneously, Prince Józef Poniatowski&#x27;s Polish infantry attacked the position from the south. Fighting was heavy and very fierce, as the Russians refused to retreat until Kutuzov personally ordered them to do so. The French captured the redoubt, at a cost of 4,000–5,000 French and 6,000 Russian casualties. The small redoubt was destroyed and covered by the dead and dying of both sides.

The unexpected French advance from the west and the fall of the Shevardino redoubt threw the Russian formation into disarray. Since the left flank of their defensive position had collapsed, Russian forces withdrew to the east, constructing a makeshift position centered around the village of Utitsa. The left flank of the Russian position was thus ripe for a flanking attack.

==Opposing forces==
A series of reforms to the Russian army had begun in 1802, creating regiments of three battalions, each battalion having four companies. The defeats of Austerlitz, Eylau and Friedland led to important additional reforms, though continuous fighting in the course of three wars with France, two with Sweden and two with the Ottoman Empire had not allowed time for these to be fully implemented and absorbed. A divisional system was introduced in 1806, and corps were established in 1812. Prussian influence may be seen in the organizational setup. By the time of Borodino the Russian army had changed greatly from the force which met the French in 1805–1807.

Russian forces present at the battle included 180 infantry battalions, 164 cavalry squadrons, 20 Cossack regiments and 55 artillery batteries (637 artillery pieces). In total, the Russians fielded 155,200 troops. There were 10,000 Cossacks as well as 33,000 Russian militiamen in the area who did not participate in the battle. After the battle the militia units were broken up to provide reinforcements to depleted regular infantry battalions. Of the 637 Russian artillery pieces, 300 were held in reserve and many of these were never committed to the battle.

According to historian Alexander Mikaberidze, the French army remained the finest army of its day by a good margin. The vast French military resources in manpower, horsepower, and firepower along with fusion of the legacy of the Ancien Régime with the formations of the French revolution and Napoleon&#x27;s reforms had transformed it into a military machine that had dominated Europe by 1799. Each corps of the French army was in fact its own mini-army capable of independent action. Despite being the finest army of its day in 1812, the French military was in decline since the Battle of Austerlitz due to spending military resources in the Peninsular War, and losing the many French veterans in battles such as the Battle of Eylau, the Battle of Aspern, and the Battle of Wagram

French forces included 214 battalions of infantry, 317 squadrons of cavalry and 587 artillery pieces totaling 128,000 troops. However, the French Imperial Guard, which consisted of 30 infantry battalions, 27 cavalry squadrons and 109 artillery piecesa total of 18,500 troopsnever committed to action.

==Battle==
===Position===
According to Carl von Clausewitz, although the Russian left was on marginally higher ground, this was but a superficial matter and did not provide much of a defensive advantage. The positioning of the Russian right was such that for the French the left seemed an obvious choice. The Russian position at Borodino consisted of a series of disconnected earthworks running in an arc from the Moskva River on the right, along its tributary, the Kolocha (whose steep banks added to the defense), and towards the village of Utitsa on the left. Thick woods interspersed along the Russian left and center (on the French side of the Kolocha) made the deployment and control of French forces difficult, aiding the defenders. The Russian center was defended by the Raevsky Redoubt, a massive open-backed earthwork mounting nineteen 12-pounder cannons which had a clear field of fire all the way to the banks of the Kolocha stream.

Kutuzov was very concerned that the French might take the New Smolensk Road around his positions and on to Moscow so placed the more powerful 1st Army under Barclay on the right, in positions which were already strong and virtually unassailable by the French. The 2nd Army under Bagration was expected to hold the left. The fall of Shevardino unanchored the Russian left flank but Kutuzov did nothing to change these initial dispositions despite the repeated pleas of his generals to redeploy their forces.

Thus, when the action began and became a defensive rather than an offensive battle for the Russians, their heavy preponderance in artillery was wasted on a right wing that would never be attacked, while the French artillery did much to help win the battle. Colonel Karl Wilhelm von Toll and others would make attempts to cover up their mistakes in this deployment and later attempts by historians would compound the issue. Indeed, Clausewitz also complained about Toll&#x27;s dispositions being so narrow and deep that needless losses were incurred from artillery fire. The Russian position therefore was just about long with about 80,000 of the 1st Army on the right and 34,000 of the 2nd Army on the left.

===Bagration&#x27;s ===
The first area of operations was on the Bagration, as had been predicted by both Barclay de Tolly and Bagration. Napoleon, in command of the French forces, made errors similar to those of his Russian adversary, deploying his forces inefficiently and failing to exploit the weaknesses in the Russian line. Despite Marshal Davout&#x27;s suggestion of a maneuver to outflank the weak Russian left, the Emperor instead ordered Davout&#x27;s First Corps to move directly forward into the teeth of the defense, while the flanking maneuver was left to the weak Fifth Corps of Prince Poniatowski.

The initial French attack was aimed at seizing the three Russian positions collectively known as the Bagration , three arrowhead-shaped, open-backed earthworks which arced out to the left in front of the Kolocha stream. These positions helped support the Russian left, which had no terrain advantages. There was much to be desired in the construction of the flèches, one officer noting that the ditches were much too shallow, the embrasures open to the ground, making them easy to enter, and that they were much too wide, exposing infantry inside them. The were supported by artillery from the village of Semyanovskaya, whose elevation dominated the other side of the Kolocha.

The battle began at 06:00 with the opening of the 102-gun French grand battery against the Russian center. Davout sent Compans&#x27;s Division against the southernmost of the , with Dessaix&#x27;s Division echeloned out to the left. They were opposed by Vorontsov&#x27;s and Neverovsky&#x27;s divisions. When Compans exited the woods on the far bank of the Kolocha, he was hit by massed Russian cannon fire; both Compans and Dessaix were wounded, but the French continued their assault.
Davout, seeing the confusion, personally led the 57th Line Regiment () forward until he had his horse shot from under him; he fell so hard that General Sorbier reported him as dead. General Rapp arrived to replace him, only to find Davout alive and leading the 57th forward again. Rapp then led the 61st Line Regiment forward when he was wounded (for the 22nd time in his career).

By 07:30, Davout had gained control of the three . Prince Bagration quickly led a counterattack that threw the French out of the positions, only to have Marshal Michel Ney lead a charge by the 24th Regiment that retook them. Although not enamoured of Barclay, Bagration turned to him for aid, ignoring Kutuzov altogether; Barclay, to his credit, responded quickly, sending three guard regiments, eight grenadier battalions and twenty-four 12-pounder cannon at their best pace to bolster Semyаnovskaya. Colonel Toll and Kutuzov moved the Guard Reserve units forward as early as 09:00 hours.
During the confused fighting, French and Russian units moved forward into impenetrable smoke and were smashed by artillery and musketry fire that was horrendous even by Napoleonic standards. Infantry and cavalrymen had difficulty maneuvering over the heaps of corpses and masses of wounded. Murat advanced with his cavalry around the to attack Bagration&#x27;s infantry, but was confronted by General Duka&#x27;s 2nd Cuirassier Division supported by Neverovsky&#x27;s infantry.

The French carried out seven assaults against the and each time were beaten back in fierce close combat. Bagration in some instances was personally leading counterattacks, and in a final attempt to push the French completely back he got hit in the leg by cannonball splinters somewhere around 11:00 hours. He insisted on staying on the field to observe Duka&#x27;s decisive cavalry attack.

This counter-punch drove Murat to seek the cover of allied Württemberger infantry. Barclay&#x27;s reinforcements, however, were sent into the fray only to be torn to pieces by French artillery, leaving Friant&#x27;s Division in control of the Russian forward position at 11:30. Dust, smoke, confusion and exhaustion all combined to keep the French commanders on the field (Davout, Ney and Murat) from comprehending that all the Russians before them had fallen back, were in confusion, and ripe for the taking.

The 2nd Army&#x27;s command structure fell apart as Bagration was removed from the battlefield and the report of his being hit quickly spread and caused morale to collapse. Napoleon, who had been sick with a cold and was too far from the action to really observe what was going on, refused to send his subordinates reinforcements. He was hesitant to release his last reserve, the Imperial Guard, so far from France.

=== First attacks on the Raevsky redoubt ===

Prince Eugène de Beauharnais advanced his corps against Borodino, rushing the village and capturing it from the Russian Guard Jägers. However, the advancing columns rapidly lost their cohesion; shortly after clearing Borodino, they faced fresh Russian assault columns and retreated back to the village. General Delzons was posted to Borodino to prevent the Russians retaking it.

Morand&#x27;s division then crossed to the north side of the Semyenovka stream, while the remainder of Eugène&#x27;s forces traversed three bridges across the Kolocha to the south, placing them on the same side of the stream as the Russians. He then deployed most of his artillery and began to push the Russians back toward the Raevsky redoubt. Broussier and Morand&#x27;s divisions then advanced together with furious artillery support. The redoubt changed hands as Barclay was forced to personally rally Paskevitch&#x27;s routed regiment.

Kutuzov ordered Yermolov to take action; the general brought forward three horse artillery batteries that began to blast the open-ended redoubt, while the 3rd Battalion of the Ufa Regiment and two regiments brought up by Barclay rushed in with the bayonet to eliminate Bonnamy&#x27;s brigade. The Russian reinforcements&#x27; assault returned the redoubt to Russian control.
Eugène&#x27;s artillery continued to pound Russian support columns, while Marshals Ney and Davout set up a crossfire with artillery positioned on the Semyonovskaya heights. Barclay countered by moving the Prussian General Eugen over to the right to support Miloradovich in his defense of the redoubt. The French responded to this move by sending forward General Sorbier, commander of the Imperial Guard artillery. Sorbier brought forth 36 artillery pieces from the Imperial Guard Artillery Park and also took command of 49 horse artillery pieces from Nansouty&#x27;s Ist Cavalry Corps and La Tour Maubourg&#x27;s IV Cavalry Corps, as well as of Viceroy Eugène&#x27;s own artillery, opening up a massive artillery barrage.

When Barclay brought up troops against an attacking French brigade, he described it as &quot;a walk into Hell&quot;. During the height of the battle, Kutuzov&#x27;s subordinates were making all of the tactical decisions for him; according to Colonel Carl von Clausewitz, famous for his work &quot;On War&quot;, the Russian commander &quot;seemed to be in a trance&quot;. With the death of General Kutaisov, Chief of Artillery, most of the Russian cannon sat useless on the heights to the rear and were never ordered into battle, while the French artillery wreaked havoc on the Russians.

===Cossack raid on the northern flank===

On the morning of the battle at around 07:30, Don Cossack patrols from Matvei Platov&#x27;s &quot;pulk&quot; had discovered a ford across the Kolocha river, on the extreme Russian right (northern) flank. Seeing that the ground in front of them was clear of enemy forces, Platov saw an opportunity to go around the French left flank and into the enemy&#x27;s rear. He at once sent one of his aides to ask for permission from Kutuzov for such an operation. Platov&#x27;s aide was lucky enough to encounter Colonel von Toll, an enterprising member of Kutuzov&#x27;s staff, who suggested that General Uvarov&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Corps be added to the operation and at once volunteered to present the plan to the commander-in-chief.

Together, they went to see Kutuzov, who nonchalantly gave his permission. There was no clear plan and no objectives had been drawn up, the whole manoeuvre being interpreted by both Kutuzov and Uvarov as a feint. Uvarov and Platov thus set off, having just around 8,000 cavalrymen and 12 guns in total, and no infantry support. As Uvarov moved southwest and south and Platov moved west, they eventually arrived in the undefended rear of Viceroy Eugène&#x27;s IV Corps. This was towards midday, just as the Viceroy was getting his orders to conduct another assault on the Raevski redoubt.

The sudden appearance of masses of enemy cavalry so close to the supply train and the Emperor&#x27;s headquarters caused panic and consternation, prompting Eugène to immediately cancel his attack and pull back his entire Corps westwards to deal with the alarming situation. Meanwhile, the two Russian cavalry commanders tried to break what French infantry they could find in the vicinity. Having no infantry of their own, the poorly coordinated Russian attacks came to nothing.

Unable to achieve much else, Platov and Uvarov moved back to their own lines and the action was perceived as a failure by both Kutuzov and the Russian General Staff (chief –9 Bennigsen). As it turned out, the action had the utmost importance in the outcome of the battle, as it delayed the attack of the IV Corps on the Raevski redoubt for a critical two hours. During these two hours, the Russians were able to reassess the situation, realize the terrible state of Bagration&#x27;s 2nd Army and send reinforcements to the front line. Meanwhile, the retreat of Viceroy Eugène&#x27;s Corps had left Montbrun&#x27;s II French Cavalry Corps to fill the gap under the most murderous fire, which used up and demoralized these cavalrymen, greatly reducing their combat effectiveness. The delay contradicted a military principle the Emperor had stated many times: &quot;Ground I may recover, time never&quot;. The Cossack raid contributed to Napoleon&#x27;s later decision not to commit his Imperial Guard to battle.

===Final attack on Raevsky redoubt===

At 14:00, Napoleon renewed the assault against the redoubt, as Broussier&#x27;s, Morand&#x27;s and Gérard&#x27;s divisions launched a massive frontal attack, with Chastel&#x27;s light cavalry division on their left and the II Reserve Cavalry Corps on their right.

The Russians sent Likhachov&#x27;s 24th Division into the battle, who fought bravely under Likhachov&#x27;s motto: &quot;Brothers, behind us is Moscow!&quot; But the French troops approached too close for the cannons to fire, and the cannoneers fought a pitched close-order defence against the attackers. General Caulaincourt ordered Watier&#x27;s cuirassier division to lead the assault. Barclay saw Eugène&#x27;s preparations for the assault and attempted to counter it, moving his forces against it. The French artillery, however, began bombarding the assembling force even as it gathered. Caulaincourt led Watier&#x27;s cuirassiers in an assault on the opening at the back of the redoubt; he was killed as the charge was beaten off by fierce Russian musketry.

General Thielmann then led eight Saxon and two Polish cavalry squadrons against the back of the redoubt, while officers and sergeants of his command actually forced their horses through the redoubt&#x27;s embrasures, sowing confusion amongst the defenders and allowing the French cavalry and infantry to take the position. The battle had all but ended, with both sides so exhausted that only the artillery was still at work. At 15:30, the Raevsky redoubt fell with most of the 24th Division&#x27;s troops. General Likhachov was captured by the French. However, the French attempts to break through further were thwarted by the Russian Guard Cavalry, which charged and repelled the French assault.

=== Utitsa ===
The third area of operations was around the village of Utitsa. The village was at the southern end of the Russian positions and lay along the old Smolensk road. It was rightly perceived as a potential weak point in the defense as a march along the road could turn the entire position at Borodino. Despite such concerns the area was a tangle of rough country thickly covered in heavy brush well suited for deploying light infantry. The forest was dense, the ground marshy, and Russian Jaegers were deployed there in some numbers. Russian General Nikolay Tuchkov had some 23,000 troops but half were untrained Opolchenye (militia) armed only with pikes and axes and not ready for deployment.

Poniatowski had about 10,000 men, all trained and eager to fight, but his first attempt did not go well. It was at once realized the massed troops and artillery could not move through the forest against Jaeger opposition so had to reverse to Yelnya and then move eastward. Tuchkov had deployed his 1st Grenadier Division in line backing it with the 3rd division in battalion columns. Some four regiments were called away to help defend the redoubts that were under attack and another two regiments were deployed in the Utitsa woods, weakening the position.

The Polish contingent contested control of Utitsa village and Utitsa mound, capturing them with their first attempt. Tuchkov later ejected the French forces from mound and village by 08:00, and was mortally wounded while leading this counter-attack. General Jean-Andoche Junot led the Westphalians to join the attack and again captured Utitsa village, which was set on fire by the departing Russians. After the village&#x27;s capture, Russians and Poles continued to skirmish and cannonade for the rest of the day without much progress. The heavy undergrowth greatly hindered Poniatowski&#x27;s efforts but eventually he came near to cutting off the Russian left from the rest of the Russian forces.
General Barclay sent help in the form of Karl Gustav von Baggovut with Pyotr Konovnitsyn in support. Baggovut took command of the Russian left flank in place of the wounded Tuchkov. Any hope of real progress by the Poles was lost.

===Napoleon&#x27;s refusal to commit the Guard===
Towards 15:00, after hours of resistance, the Russian army was in dire straits, but the French forces were exhausted and had neither the necessary stamina nor will to carry out another assault. Both armies were exhausted after the battle and the Russians withdrew from the field the following day. Borodino represented the last Russian effort at stopping the French advance on Moscow, which fell a week later. At this crucial juncture, Murat&#x27;s chief of staff, General Augustin Daniel Belliard rode straight to the Emperor&#x27;s Headquarters and, according to General Ségur who wrote an account of the campaign, told him that the Russian line had been breached, that the road to Mozhaysk, behind the Russian line, was visible through the gaping hole the French attack had pierced, that an enormous crowd of runaways and vehicles were hastily retreating, and that a final push would be enough to decide the fate of the Russian army and of the war. Generals Daru, Dumas and Marshal Louis Alexandre Berthier also joined in and told the Emperor that everyone thought the time had come for the Guard to be committed to battle.

Given the ferocity of the Russian defense, everyone was aware that such a move would cost the lives of thousands of Guardsmen, but it was thought that the presence of this prestigious unit would bolster the morale of the entire army for a final decisive push. A notable exception was Marshal Bessières, commander of the Guard cavalry, who was one of the very few senior generals to strongly advise against the intervention of the Guard. As the general staff were discussing the matter, General Rapp, a senior to the Emperor, was being brought from the field of battle, having been wounded in action.

Rapp immediately recommended to the Emperor that the Guard be deployed for action at which the Emperor is said to have retorted: &quot;I will most definitely not; I do not want to have it blown up. I am certain of winning the battle without its intervention.&quot; Determined not to commit this valuable final reserve so far away from France, Napoleon rejected another such request, this time from Marshal Ney. Instead, he called the commander of the &quot;Young Guard&quot;, Marshal Mortier and instructed him to guard the field of battle without moving forward or backward, while at the same time unleashing a massive cannonade with his 400 guns.

==End of the battle==
Napoleon went forward to see the situation from the former Russian front lines shortly after the redoubts had been taken. The Russians had moved to the next ridge-line in much disarray; however, that disarray was not clear to the French, with dust and haze obscuring the Russian dispositions. Kutuzov ordered the Russian Guard to hold the line and so it did. All of the artillery that the French army had was not enough to move it. Those compact squares made good artillery targets and the Russian Guard stood in place from 4 pm to 6 pm unmoving under its fire, resulting in huge casualties. All he could see were masses of troops in the distance and thus nothing more was attempted. Neither the attack, which relied on brute force, nor the refusal to use the Guard to finish the day&#x27;s work, showed any brilliance on Napoleon&#x27;s part.

Carl von Clausewitz, the Prussian historian and future author of &quot;On War&quot;, and Alexander I of Russia both noted that the poor positioning of the Russian troops had particularly hobbled the defense. Barclay communicated with Kutuzov in order to receive further instructions. According to Ludwig von Wolzogen (in an account dripping with sarcasm), the commander was found a half-hour away on the road to Moscow, encamped with an entourage of young nobles and grandly pronouncing he would drive Napoleon off the next day.

Despite his bluster, Kutuzov knew from dispatches that his army had been too badly hurt to fight a continuing action the following day. He knew exactly what he was doing: by fighting the pitched battle, he could now retreat with the Russian army still intact, lead its recovery, and force the weakened French forces to move even further from their bases of supply. The became a textbook example of what a hold logistics placed upon an army far from its center of supply. On September 8, the Russian army moved away from the battlefield in twin columns, allowing Napoleon to occupy Moscow and await for five weeks a Russian surrender that would never come.

Kutuzov would proclaim over the course of several days that the Russian Army would fight again before the walls of Moscow. In fact, a site was chosen near Poklonnaya Gora within a few miles of Moscow as a battle site. However, the Russian Army had not received enough reinforcements, and it was too risky to cling to Moscow at all costs. Kutuzov understood that the Russian people never wanted to abandon Moscow, the city which was regarded as Russia&#x27;s &quot;second capital&quot; (after Saint Petersburg, where Tsar and the Russian government resided); however he also believed that the Russian Army did not have enough forces to protect that city. Kutuzov called for a council of war in the afternoon of 13 September at Fili village. In a heated debate that split the council five to four in favour of giving battle, Kutuzov, after listening to each General, endorsed retreat. Thus passed the last chance of battle before Moscow was taken.

===Historiography===
It is not unusual for a pivotal battle of this era to be difficult to document. Similar difficulties exist with the Battle of Waterloo or battles of the War of 1812 in North America, while the Battle of Borodino offers its own particular challenges to accuracy. It has been repeatedly subjected to overtly political uses.

Personal accounts of the battle frequently magnified an individual&#x27;s own role or minimised those of rivals. The politics of the time were complex and complicated by ethnic divisions between native Russian nobility and those having second and third-generation German descent, leading to rivalry for positions in command of the army. Not only does a historian have to deal with the normal problem of a veteran looking back and recalling events as he or she would have liked them to have been, but in some cases outright malice was involved. Nor was this strictly a Russian event, as bickering and sabotage were known amongst the French marshals and their reporting generals. To &quot;lie like a bulletin&quot; was a recognised phrase amongst his troops. It was not just a French affair either, with Kutuzov in particular promoting misinformation that has continued to this day. Further distortions occurred during the Soviet years, when an adherence to a &quot;formula&quot; was the expectation during the Stalin years and for some time after that. The over-reliance of western histories on the battle and of the campaign on French sources has been noted by later historians.

The views of historians of the outcome of the battle changed with the passage of time and the changing political situations surrounding them. Kutuzov proclaimed a victory both to the army and to Emperor Alexander. While many a general throughout history claimed victory out of defeat (Ramses II of Egypt did so), in this case Kutuzov was commander-in-chief of the entire Russian army: an army that, despite the huge losses, considered itself undefeated. Announcing a defeat would have removed Kutuzov from command, and damaged the morale of the soldiers. While Alexander was not deceived by the announcement, it gave him the justification needed to allow Kutuzov to march his army off to rebuild the Russian forces and later complete the near utter destruction of the French army. As such, what was said by Kutuzov and those supporting his views was allowed to pass into the histories of the time unchecked.

Histories during the Soviet era raised the battle to a mythic contest with serious political overtones. They depicted Kutuzov as a master tactician, directing every move on the battlefield with the precision of a ballet master directing his troupe. Kutuzov&#x27;s abilities on the battlefield were, in the eyes of his contemporaries and fellow Russian generals, far more complex; they were often described in less than flattering terms. Noted author and historian David G. Chandler writing in 1966, echoes the Soviet-era Russian histories in several ways, asserting that General Kutuzov remained in control of the battle throughout, e.g. by ordering counter-moves to Napoleon&#x27;s tactics personally rather than Bagration and Barclay doing so, and putting aside personal differences to overcome any dispositional mistakes. Neither is the tent scene played out; instead Kutuzov remains with the army. Chandler also has the Russian army in much better shape moving to secondary prepared positions and seriously considering attacking the next day. Later historians Riehn and Mikaberidze have Kutuzov leaving most of the battle to Bagration and Barclay de Tolly, leaving early in the afternoon and relaying orders from his camp 30 minutes from the front.

Kutuzov&#x27;s dispositions for the battle are described as clearly mistaken, by leaving the right far too strong and the left much too weak. Only the fact that Bagration and Barclay cooperated fully saved the Russian army, doing much to mitigate the bad positioning overall. Nothing would be more damning than 300 artillery pieces standing silent on the Russian right.

==Casualties==

The fighting involved around 250,000 troops and left at least 68,000 killed and wounded, making Borodino the deadliest single-day battle of the Napoleonic Wars and one of the bloodiest single-day battles in military history until the First Battle of the Marne in 1914.

The casualties of the battle were staggering: according to French General Staff Inspector P. Denniee, the lost approximately 28,000 soldiers: 6,562 (including 269 officers) were reported as dead, 21,450 as wounded. But according to French historian Aristid Martinien, at least 460 French officers (known by name) were killed in battle. In total, the lost 1,928 officers dead and wounded, including 49 generals. The list of slain included French Generals of Division Auguste-Jean-Gabriel de Caulaincourt, Louis-Pierre Montbrun, Jean Victor Tharreau and Generals of Brigade Claude Antoine Compère, François Auguste Damas, Léonard Jean Aubry Huard de Saint-Aubin, Jean Pierre Lanabère, Charles Stanislas Marion, Louis Auguste Marchand Plauzonne and Jean Louis Romeuf.

Suffering a wound on the Borodino battlefield was effectively a death sentence, as French forces did not possess enough food for the healthy, much less the sick; consequently, equal numbers of wounded soldiers starved to death, died of their injuries, or perished through neglect. The casualties were for a single day of battle, while the Russian figures are for the 5th and the 7th, combined. Using the same accounting method for both armies brings the actual French Army casualty count to 34,000–35,000.

Both the French and Russians suffered terrible casualties during the fighting, losing over a third of their armies. Some 52,000 Russian troops were reported as dead, wounded or missing, including 1,000 prisoners; some 8,000 men were separated from their units and returned over the next few days, bringing the total Russian losses to 44,000. Twenty-two Russian generals were killed or wounded, including Prince Bagration, who died of his wounds on 24 September. Historian Gwynne Dyer compared the carnage at Borodino to &quot;a loaded 747 crashing, with no survivors, every 5 minutes for eight hours&quot;. Taken as a one-day battle in the scope of the Napoleonic conflict, this was the bloodiest battle of this series of conflicts with combined casualties between 72,000 and 73,000. The next nearest battle would be Waterloo, at about 55,000 for the day. The French lost about roughly the same number of soldiers. However, the Russian Empire, being a massive country with a huge population, could relieve these losses quickly whilst Napoleon could not. Therefore, both sides had their victories and defeats, with none reaching a decisive goal.

In the historiography of this battle, the figures would be deliberately inflated or underplayed by the generals of both sides attempting to lessen the impact the figures would have on public opinion both during aftermath of the battle or, for political reasons, later during the Soviet period.

==Aftermath==
===Attrition warfare=== 
Estimates of the Battle of Borodino appear in different ways in historiography. From the victory of the French, to the victory of the Russians and a draw. The battle was undoubtedly a moral success for the Russians, per imperial Russian sources. More modern authors note that in the camp of the French army there was a feeling of victory, incredibly difficult, but still a victory. However, some French testimony from the battlefield confirms the opposite. Pelpor, General of the 18th Line Regiment, wrote: &quot;This victory was so painfully and so bought, it was incomplete. She made us sad!&quot;.
The aforementioned Segur also wrote: &quot;The French soldiers were amazed by the number of dead and wounded, such a small number of prisoners, there are more than 800 of them! The dead testified more to the bravery of the vanquished than to our victory. If the surviving enemy retreated in such complete, brilliant order, proud and undaunted, what did it mean for us to capture a battlefield?&quot;. Kutuzov retreated from the battlefield on 8 September, and Napoleon and his men managed to capture Moscow; the fierce defense of the Imperial Russian Army devastated the to such an extent that it caused the French army&#x27;s force to become &quot;impuissant&quot;. Also, the city was actually used as bait to lure and trap the French forces. When Napoleon and his men visited the city, he found that it was burnt and abandoned upon his arrival. While Napoleon was in Moscow, he sent a letter to the tsar who was residing in Saint Petersburg demanding that he surrender and accept defeat. Napoleon received no response. Whilst patiently waiting for an answer from the tsar, as soon as the cold winter and snowfall started to form, Napoleon, realizing what was happening, attempted to escape the country with his men. Seeing that they were fleeing, the Imperial Russian army launched a massive attack on the French. Attrition warfare was used by Kutuzov by burning Moscow&#x27;s resources, guerrilla warfare by the Cossacks against any kind of transport and total war by the peasants against foraging. This kind of warfare weakened the French army at its most vulnerable point: logistics, as it was unable to pillage Russian land, which was insufficiently populated nor cultivated, meaning that starvation became the most dangerous enemy long before the cold joined in.
The feeding of horses by supply trains was extremely difficult, as a ration for a horse weighs about ten times as much as one for a man. It was tried in vain to feed and water all the horses by foraging expeditions. Of the more than 600,000 soldiers who invaded the Russian Empire, 112,000 returned.

===Pyrrhic victory===
Most scholars and contemporaries describe Borodino as a Pyrrhic victory. Historian Oleg Sokolov (1999) posited that Borodino constituted a Pyrrhic victory for the French, which would ultimately cost Napoleon the war and his crown, although at the time none of this was apparent to either side. Sokolov added that the decision to not commit the Guard saved the Russians from an Austerlitz-style defeat. He quoted Marshal Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr, one of Napoleon&#x27;s finest strategists, who analyzed the battle and concluded that an intervention of the Guard would have torn the Russian army to pieces, allowed Napoleon to safely follow his plans to take winter quarters in Moscow, and resume his successful campaign in spring or offer the Tsar acceptable peace terms. He also claim that the victory &quot;did not bring anything to the French.&quot; Digby Smith (2003) called Borodino &#x27;a draw&#x27;, but believes that posterity proved Napoleon right in his decision to not commit the Guard so far away from his homeland. According to Christopher Duffy (1972), the battle of Borodino could be seen as a new Battle of Torgau, in which both of the sides sustained terrible losses but neither could achieve their tactical goals, and the battle itself did not have a clear result, although both sides claimed the battle as their own victory. Frederick Kagan (2002) called the battle a &quot;victory for the Russians, which they got at a great price&quot;.
 estimate battle like indecisive for both sides, But in light of long-term events, the French are in a worse position. In 1992, In the Russian magazine &quot;Rodina&quot;, there was a debate between historian Abalkhin and Vasiliev, the first claiming that the battle ended in a draw, the second that the French won.

However, in what had become a war of attrition, the battle was just one more source of losses to the French when they were losing two men to one. Both the French and the Russians suffered terribly but the Russians had reserve troops, and a clear logistical advantage. The French Army supplies came over a long road lined with hostile forces. According to Riehn, so long as the Russian Army existed the French continued to lose.

This battle was not decisive, but it allowed the French emperor to occupy Moscow to await a surrender that would never come. The capture of Moscow proved a Pyrrhic victory, since the Russians had no intention of negotiating with Napoleon for peace. Historian Riehn notes that the Borodino victory allowed Napoleon to move on to Moscow, whereeven allowing for the arrival of reinforcementsthe French Army only possessed a maximum of 95,000 men, who would be ill-equipped to win a battle due to a lack of supplies and ammunition. The main part of the suffered more than 90,000 casualties by the time of the Moscow retreat (see Minard&#x27;s map); typhus, dysentery, starvation and hypothermia ensured that only about 10,000 men of the main force returned across the Russian border alive. Furthermore, although the Russian army suffered heavy casualties in the battle, it regrouped by the time of Napoleon&#x27;s retreat from Moscow; it soon began to interfere with the French withdrawal and made it a catastrophe.

==Legacy==

Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky composed his &quot;1812 Overture&quot; to commemorate the battle.

Karol Kurpiński composed his &quot;Grand Symphony Imagining a Battle&quot;, also known as &quot;The Battle of Mozhaysk Symphony&quot; to commemorate the Battle.

The battle was famously described by Leo Tolstoy in his novel &quot;War and Peace&quot;: &quot;After the shock that had been received, the French army was still able to crawl to Moscow; but there, without any new efforts on the part of the Russian troops, it was doomed to perish, bleeding to death from the mortal wound received at Borodino&quot;. The battle is depicted in Sergei Bondarchuk&#x27;s film adaptation of Tolstoy&#x27;s novel, which in Part III devotes 35 minutes to a monumental depiction of the battle, using 12,000 Soviet troops. The narrator in the film makes the claim that the moral victory of the Russian side led directly to the end of Napoleon&#x27;s empire.

Poet Mikhail Lermontov romanticized the battle in his poem &quot;Borodino&quot;.

A huge panorama representing the battle was painted by Franz Roubaud for the centenary of Borodino in 1912 and installed on the Poklonnaya Hill in Moscow to mark the 150th anniversary of the event in 1962 by Soviet authorities.

In Russia, the Battle of Borodino is reenacted yearly on the first Sunday of September and commemorated as a Day of Military Honour.

On the battlefield itself, the Bagration are preserved; a modest monument has been constructed in honour of the French soldiers who fell in the battle.

A commemorative one-ruble coin was released in the Soviet Union in 1987 to commemorate the 175th anniversary of the Battle of Borodino, and four million were minted.

A minor planet 3544 Borodino, discovered by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh in 1977, was named after the village of Borodino.

Since May 1813, at least 29 ships have been named &quot;Borodino&quot; after the battle (see List of ships named &quot;Borodino&quot;), and many others after participants in the battle: 24 ships in honor of Mikhail Kutuzov, 18 ships in honor of Matvei Platov, 15 ships in honor of Pyotr Bagration, 33 ships in honor of the Cossacks, four ships in honor of Denis Davydov, two ships each in honor of Louis-Alexandre Berthier, Jean-Baptiste Bessières and Michel Ney; and one ship each in honor of the officers of the Marine Guards crew I. P. Kartsov, N. P. Rimsky-Korsakov and M. N. Lermontov; Prince Vorontsov, generals Yermolov and Raevsky, Marshal of the Empire Louis-Nicolas Davout.

<text>Contact manipulation is a form of object manipulation that focuses on the movement of objects such as balls in contact with the body. Although often used in conjunction with &quot;toss juggling&quot;, it differs in that it involves the rolling of one or more objects without releasing them into the air.

==History==
Many of the techniques found in contact manipulation, such as balancing or rolling a single ball or palm spinning (see &quot;Baoding Balls&quot;), have been performed for centuries. More variations were introduced by vaudevillians such as Paul Cinquevalli. In 1986, American juggler Tony Duncan was reported to be holding audiences spellbound with an act that involved rolling a single ball all over his body.

Michael Moschen brought the form to a new level with his performance, &quot;Light&quot;, developed in the 1980s. In this performance he used 75mm clear crystal balls, palm spinning up to eight balls simultaneously. He finished the act by rolling a single clear ball so that it appeared to float over his hands and arms. Moschen received praise from the international circus community for his range of innovative techniques, and he was made a MacArthur Fellow (received a &quot;Genius Award&quot;) in 1990. In the 1986 film &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, David Bowie&#x27;s character performs contact manipulation throughout the film. These manipulations were performed by Moschen, who stood behind Bowie during filming, reaching around and performing the tricks &quot;blind&quot;. In the film&#x27;s credits, Moschen is credited for &quot;crystal ball manipulation.&quot;

In the summer of 1990, John P. Miller (now better known by his pen-name, James Ernest), wrote and published the first edition of the book &quot;Contact Juggling&quot;, which covers all of the basic contact manipulation techniques and methods for learning them. The first edition had a run of only 100 copies, photocopied and stapled. The second edition was published in 1991, in a comb-bound format, by Ernest Graphics Press, with the author listed as James Ernest. Ernest is credited with coining the term &quot;contact juggling&quot;.

In 1991, the video &quot;Michael Moschen: In Motion&quot; (created as the television special &quot;In Motion with Michael Moschen&quot; for PBS&#x27;s &quot;Great Performances&quot; series) was released. Since then, this form of manipulation has received further popularization through instructional materials and performances developed by artist other than Moschen. Throughout the 1990s, there was continuing contention within the juggling community regarding whether Moschen&#x27;s ideas were being stolen by performers and juggling instructors (see &quot;Controversy&quot;, below). Many resources have since become available for contact jugglers, such as clubs, books, festivals, videos/DVDs, and balls specifically manufactured for contact manipulation.

In 2010, Zoom TV, a direct-marketing company, began mass-marketing &quot;the Fushigi Magic Gravity Ball&quot;, an acrylic contact manipulation ball with a steel core (used to prevent the focusing of sunlight through a clear acrylic sphere, a fire hazard). Zoom TV claimed that the ball possesses special properties that make it &quot;appear to float&quot; and improve balance and control (see &quot;Controversy&quot;, below), and saw significant commercial success.

In 2010, an updated and revised third edition of the book &quot;Contact Juggling&quot; was released by Ernest Graphics Press.

Michael Moschen, in interviews, has contested that so-called &quot;Contact Juggling&quot; does not exist, and that the term &quot;Contact Juggling&quot; is both self contradictory and erroneous, and created purely for commercial reasons.

==Types==

===Body rolling===

Body rolling means manipulating one or more props (usually balls) around the hands, arms, and other parts of the body. Balance is required to hold the ball in various positions of control. This includes tricks such as headrolling and the butterfly, the trick of rolling the ball from the palm to the back of the hand via the fingertips.

===Head rolling===

The headroll is a trick involving rolling an object or prop, typically a ball, around on the juggler&#x27;s head. The most commonly performed version is rolling a ball from temple to temple, across the forehead. At some points during the trick, the object may be balanced in place at a certain location on the head. Points where the prop may be balanced (also known as placement, or trap) include: the temple, the center of the forehead, the back of the neck, the eye socket, the mouth, and the most difficult; the top of the head.

===Palm spinning===

Palm spinning means manipulating one or more balls in the open hand so that at least one ball is in motion. Balls may be in both hands or transferred between hands to form graceful and fluid patterns, including rotating a pyramid made of four or five balls in one hand.

===Isolation moves===

Isolation refers to the manipulation of a ball so that it appears to be suspended in place. Similar to sleight-of-hand techniques in magic or fixed-point mime techniques; the performers exploit the clear surface of the ball to hide any noticeable rotation, creating the effect that the ball is still while the performer moves around the ball.

== Equipment ==
There are various forms of contact balls such as:

* Clear acrylic balls
* Coloured acrylic balls
* LED contact balls
* Fire contact balls
* Silicone contact balls

==Controversy==
Some jugglers have claimed that portions of the book &quot;Contact Juggling&quot; and any juggling performances that contain elements similar to Michael Moschen&#x27;s original &quot;Light&quot; performance are breaches of Moschen&#x27;s intellectual property or copyright. In 1992, Michael Moschen threatened not to attend the International Jugglers&#x27; Association annual conference in Quebec, Canada, where he was to be a guest of honor, due to Ted Alspach&#x27;s favorable review of the book &quot;Contact Juggling&quot; in the Fall 1991 issue of the IJA&#x27;s periodical, &quot;Juggler&#x27;s World&quot;. In the end, Moschen did attend the festival.

The wide commercial success of the &quot;Fushigi Magic Gravity Ball&quot; in 2010 reignited the controversy within the contact juggling community. The television advertisement consisted of a montage of contact juggling performance, the amazed reactions of audience members, suggestions that the ball appeared to float by itself, and an announcer suggesting that the ball can be quickly mastered &quot;in just minutes.&quot; Concerned about the public depiction of contact juggling being accomplished not by skill but by means of a special prop, contact jugglers quickly filled a Fushigi thread to 100 pages on contactjuggling.org. The Winter 2010 edition of the IJA&#x27;s periodical &quot;Juggle&quot; features a 4-page article about &quot;the Dynamic/Contact/Sphereplay/Fushigi Controversy&quot; by Brad Weston, including an interview with the president of Zoom TV Products, the marketing firm that produced the Fushigi ball. The following issue featured a rebuttal by a professional contact juggler accusing Zoom TV Products of exploiting contact juggling to sell a deceptively marketed product. The Fushigi ball quickly fell out of production.

<text>Euler&#x27;s constant (sometimes called the Euler–Mascheroni constant) is a mathematical constant, usually denoted by the lowercase Greek letter gamma (), defined as the limiting difference between the harmonic series and the natural logarithm, denoted here by :

formula_1

Here, represents the floor function.

The numerical value of Euler&#x27;s constant, to 50 decimal places, is:

== History ==
The constant first appeared in a 1734 paper by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, titled &quot;De Progressionibus harmonicis observationes&quot; (Eneström Index 43), where he described it as &quot;worthy of serious consideration&quot;. Euler initially calculated the constant&#x27;s value to 6 decimal places. In 1781, he calculated it to 16 decimal places. Euler used the notations and for the constant. The Italian mathematician Lorenzo Mascheroni attempted to calculate the constant to 32 decimal places, but made errors in the 20th–22nd and 31st–32nd decimal places; starting from the 20th digit, he calculated ...1811209008239 when the correct value is ...0651209008240. In 1790, he used the notations and for the constant. Other computations were done by Johann von Soldner in 1809, who used the notation . The notation appears nowhere in the writings of either Euler or Mascheroni, and was chosen at a later time, perhaps because of the constant&#x27;s connection to the gamma function. For example, the German mathematician Carl Anton Bretschneider used the notation in 1835, and Augustus De Morgan used it in a textbook published in parts from 1836 to 1842. Euler&#x27;s constant was also studied by the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan who published one paper on it in 1917. David Hilbert mentioned the irrationality of as an unsolved problem that seems &quot;unapproachable&quot; and, allegedly, the English mathematician Godfrey Hardy offered to give up his Savilian Chair at Oxford to anyone who could prove this.

== Appearances ==

== Properties ==
===Irrationality and transcendence===
The number has not been proved algebraic or transcendental. In fact, it is not even known whether is irrational. The ubiquity of revealed by the large number of equations below and the fact that has been called the third most important mathematical constant after  and  makes the irrationality of a major open question in mathematics.

However, some progress has been made. In 1959 Andrei Shidlovsky proved that at least one of Euler&#x27;s constant and the Gompertz constant is irrational; Tanguy Rivoal proved in 2012 that at least one of them is transcendental. Kurt Mahler showed in 1968 that the number formula_3 is transcendental, where formula_4 and formula_5 are the usual Bessel functions. It is known that the transcendence degree of the field formula_6 is at least two. 

In 2010, M. Ram Murty and N. Saradha showed that at most one of the Euler-Lehmer constants, i. e. the numbers of the form
formula_7
is algebraic, if and ; this family includes the special case . 

Using the same approach, in 2013, M. Ram Murty and A. Zaytseva showed that the generalized Euler constants have the same property,

 where the generalized Euler constant are defined as
formula_8
where is a fixed list of prime numbers, formula_9 if at least one of the primes in is a prime factor of , and formula_10 otherwise. In particular, .

Using a continued fraction analysis, Papanikolaou showed in 1997 that if is rational, its denominator must be greater than 10244663. If is a rational number, then its denominator must be greater than 1015000.

Euler&#x27;s constant is conjectured not to be an algebraic period, but the values of its first 109 decimal digits seem to indicate that it could be a normal number.

=== Continued fraction ===
The simple continued fraction expansion of Euler&#x27;s constant is given by:

:formula_11

which has no &quot;apparent&quot; pattern. It is known to have at least 16,695,000,000 terms, and it has infinitely many terms if and only if is irrational.

Numerical evidence suggests that both Euler&#x27;s constant as well as the constant are among the numbers for which the geometric mean of their simple continued fraction terms converges to Khinchin&#x27;s constant. Similarly, when formula_12 are the convergents of their respective continued fractions, the limit formula_13 appears to converge to Lévy&#x27;s constant in both cases. However neither of these limits has been proven.

There also exists a generalized continued fraction for Euler&#x27;s constant.

A good simple approximation of is given by the reciprocal of the square root of 3 or about 0.57735:

:formula_14

with the difference being about 1 in 7,429.

== Formulas and identities ==

=== Relation to gamma function ===
 is related to the digamma function , and hence the derivative of the gamma function , when both functions are evaluated at 1. Thus:

formula_15

This is equal to the limits:

formula_16

Further limit results are:

formula_17

A limit related to the beta function (expressed in terms of gamma functions) is

formula_18

=== Relation to the zeta function ===
 can also be expressed as an infinite sum whose terms involve the Riemann zeta function evaluated at positive integers:

formula_19
The constant formula_20 can also be expressed in terms of the sum of the reciprocals of non-trivial zeros formula_21 of the zeta function:
:formula_22
Other series related to the zeta function include:

formula_23

The error term in the last equation is a rapidly decreasing function of . As a result, the formula is well-suited for efficient computation of the constant to high precision.

Other interesting limits equaling Euler&#x27;s constant are the antisymmetric limit:

formula_24

and the following formula, established in 1898 by de la Vallée-Poussin:

formula_25

where are ceiling brackets.
This formula indicates that when taking any positive integer and dividing it by each positive integer less than , the average fraction by which the quotient falls short of the next integer tends to (rather than 0.5) as tends to infinity.

Closely related to this is the rational zeta series expression. By taking separately the first few terms of the series above, one obtains an estimate for the classical series limit:

formula_26

where is the Hurwitz zeta function. The sum in this equation involves the harmonic numbers, . Expanding some of the terms in the Hurwitz zeta function gives:

formula_27
where 

 can also be expressed as follows where is the Glaisher–Kinkelin constant:

formula_28

 can also be expressed as follows, which can be proven by expressing the zeta function as a Laurent series:

formula_29
=== Relation to triangular numbers ===
Numerous formulations have been derived that express formula_20 in terms of sums and logarithms of triangular numbers. One of the earliest of these is a formula for the harmonic number attributed to Srinivasa Ramanujan where formula_20 is related to formula_32 in a series that considers the powers of formula_33 (an earlier, less-generalizable proof by Ernesto Cesàro gives the first two terms of the series, with an error term):

:formula_34

From Stirling&#x27;s approximation follows a similar series:

:formula_35

The series of inverse triangular numbers also features in the study of the Basel problem posed by Pietro Mengoli. Mengoli proved that formula_36, a result Jacob Bernoulli later used to estimate the value of formula_37, placing it between formula_38 and formula_39. This identity appears in a formula used by Bernhard Riemann to compute roots of the zeta function, where formula_20 is expressed in terms of the sum of roots formula_21 plus the difference between Boya&#x27;s expansion and the series of exact unit fractions formula_42:

:formula_43

=== Integrals ===
 equals the value of a number of definite integrals:

formula_44
where is the fractional harmonic number, and formula_45 is the fractional part of formula_46.

The third formula in the integral list can be proved in the following way:

formula_47

The integral on the second line of the equation stands for the Debye function value of , which is .

Definite integrals in which appears include:

formula_48

We also have Catalan&#x27;s 1875 integral

formula_49

One can express using a special case of Hadjicostas&#x27;s formula as a double integral with equivalent series:

formula_50

An interesting comparison by Sondow is the double integral and alternating series

formula_51

It shows that may be thought of as an &quot;alternating Euler constant&quot;.

The two constants are also related by the pair of series

formula_52

where and are the number of 1s and 0s, respectively, in the base 2 expansion of .

=== Series expansions ===
In general,

formula_53

for any . However, the rate of convergence of this expansion depends significantly on . In particular, exhibits much more rapid convergence than the conventional expansion . This is because

formula_54

while

formula_55

Even so, there exist other series expansions which converge more rapidly than this; some of these are discussed below.

Euler showed that the following infinite series approaches :
formula_56

The series for is equivalent to a series Nielsen found in 1897:

formula_57

In 1910, Vacca found the closely related series

formula_58

where is the logarithm to base 2 and is the floor function.

This can be generalized to:

formula_59where:formula_60

In 1926 Vacca found a second series:

formula_61

From the Malmsten–Kummer expansion for the logarithm of the gamma function we get:

formula_62

Ramanujan, in his lost notebook gave a series that approaches :

formula_63

An important expansion for Euler&#x27;s constant is due to Fontana and Mascheroni

formula_64
where are Gregory coefficients. This series is the special case of the expansions

formula_65

convergent for 

A similar series with the Cauchy numbers of the second kind is 

formula_66

Blagouchine (2018) found an interesting generalisation of the Fontana–Mascheroni series

formula_67

where are the Bernoulli polynomials of the second kind, which are defined by the generating function

formula_68

For any rational this series contains rational terms only. For example, at , it becomes

formula_69
Other series with the same polynomials include these examples:

formula_70

and

formula_71

where is the gamma function.

A series related to the Akiyama–Tanigawa algorithm is

formula_72

where are the Gregory coefficients of the second order.
As a series of prime numbers:

formula_73

=== Asymptotic expansions ===
 equals the following asymptotic formulas (where is the th harmonic number):

*formula_74 (&quot;Euler&quot;)
*formula_75 (&quot;Negoi&quot;)
*formula_76 (&quot;Cesàro&quot;)

The third formula is also called the Ramanujan expansion.

Alabdulmohsin derived closed-form expressions for the sums of errors of these approximations. He showed that (Theorem A.1):

formula_77

=== Exponential ===
The constant is important in number theory. Its numerical value is:
 equals the following limit, where is the th prime number:

formula_78

This restates the third of Mertens&#x27; theorems.

We further have the following product involving the three constants , and :

formula_79

Other infinite products relating to include:

formula_80

These products result from the Barnes -function.

In addition,

formula_81

where the th factor is the th root of

formula_82

This infinite product, first discovered by Ser in 1926, was rediscovered by Sondow using hypergeometric functions.

It also holds that

&quot;Euler&#x27;s generalized constants&quot; are given by

formula_84

formula_85

with again the limit:

This can be further generalized to

formula_87

for some arbitrary decreasing function . Setting

=== Euler-Lehmer constants ===

&quot;Euler–Lehmer constants&quot; are given by summation of inverses of numbers in a common
modulo class:

and if the greatest common divisor then

formula_94

===Masser-Gramain constant===

A two-dimensional generalization of Euler&#x27;s constant is the Masser-Gramain constant. It is defined as the following limiting difference:

:formula_95

where formula_96 is the smallest radius of a disk in the complex plane containing at least formula_97 Gaussian integers.

The following bounds have been established: formula_98.

<text>Great Expectations is the thirteenth novel by English author Charles Dickens and his penultimate completed novel. The novel is a bildungsroman and depicts the education of an orphan nicknamed Pip. It is Dickens&#x27; second novel, after &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, to be fully narrated in the first person. The novel was first published as a serial in Dickens&#x27;s weekly periodical &quot;All the Year Round&quot;, from 1 December 1860 to August 1861. In October 1861, Chapman &amp; Hall published the novel in three volumes.

The novel is set in Kent and London in the early to mid-19th century and contains some of Dickens&#x27;s most celebrated scenes, starting in a graveyard, where the young Pip is accosted by the escaped convict Abel Magwitch. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is full of extreme imagery—poverty, prison ships and chains, and fights to the death—and has a colourful cast of characters who have entered popular culture. These include the eccentric Miss Havisham, the beautiful but cold Estella, and Joe Gargery, the unsophisticated and kind blacksmith. Dickens&#x27;s themes include wealth and poverty, love and rejection, and the eventual triumph of good over evil. &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, which is popular with both readers and literary critics, has been translated into many languages and adapted numerous times into various media.

The novel was very widely praised. Although Dickens&#x27;s contemporary Thomas Carlyle referred to it disparagingly as &quot;that Pip nonsense&quot;, he nevertheless reacted to each fresh instalment with &quot;roars of laughter&quot;. Later, George Bernard Shaw praised the novel, describing it as &quot;all of one piece and consistently truthful&quot;. During the serial publication, Dickens was pleased with public response to &quot;Great Expectations&quot; and its sales; when the plot first formed in his mind, he called it &quot;a very fine, new and grotesque idea&quot;.

In the 21st century, the novel retains good standing among literary critics and in 2003 it was ranked 17th on the BBC&#x27;s The Big Read poll.

==Plot summary==
The book includes three &quot;stages&quot; of Pip&#x27;s expectations.

===First stage===
Philip &quot;Pip&quot; Pirrip is a seven-year-old orphan who lives with his hot-tempered older sister and her kindly blacksmith husband Joe Gargery on the coastal marshes of Kent. On Christmas Eve 1812, Pip visits the graves of his parents and siblings. There, he unexpectedly encounters an escaped convict who threatens to kill him if he does not bring back food and tools. Pip steals a file from among Joe&#x27;s tools and a pie and brandy that were meant for Christmas dinner, which he delivers to the convict.

That evening, Pip&#x27;s sister is about to look for the missing pie when soldiers arrive and ask Joe to mend some shackles. Joe and Pip accompany them into the marshes to recapture the convict, who is fighting with another escaped convict. The first convict confesses to stealing food, clearing Pip.
A few years later, Miss Havisham, a wealthy and reclusive spinster who lives in dilapidated Satis House wearing her old wedding dress after having been jilted at the altar, asks Mr Pumblechook, a relative of the Gargerys, to find a boy to visit her. Pip visits Miss Havisham and falls in love with Estella, her adopted daughter. Estella is aloof and hostile to Pip, which Miss Havisham encourages. During one visit, another boy picks a fistfight with Pip, where Pip easily gains the upper hand. Estella watches, and allows Pip to kiss her afterwards. Pip visits Miss Havisham regularly, until he is old enough to learn a trade.

Joe accompanies Pip for the last visit to Miss Havisham, at which she gives Pip money to become an apprentice blacksmith. Joe&#x27;s surly assistant, Dolge Orlick, is envious of Pip and dislikes Mrs. Joe. Orlick also complains when Joe says he needs to take Pip somewhere midday, thinking this is another sign of favoritism, of which Joe assures him he can quit work for the day. When Pip and Joe are away from the house, Joe&#x27;s wife is brutally attacked, leaving her unable to speak or do her work. When Pip sees a leg iron was the weapon used in the attack, he becomes worried believing that it was the same leg iron he helped liberate the convict from. Now bedridden, Mrs. Joe is unable to be as &quot;rampaging&quot; towards Pip as before the attack. Pip&#x27;s former schoolmate Biddy joins the household to help with her care.
Four years into Pip&#x27;s apprenticeship, Mr Jaggers, a lawyer, informs him that he has been provided with money from an anonymous patron, allowing him to become a gentleman. Presuming that Miss Havisham is his benefactress, Pip visits her before leaving for London.

===Second stage===
Pip&#x27;s first experience with urban England is a shock, for London is not the &quot;soft white city&quot; Pip imagined, but a place of heavy litter and filth. Pip moves into Barnard&#x27;s Inn with Herbert Pocket, the son of his tutor, Matthew Pocket, who is Miss Havisham&#x27;s cousin. Pip realizes Herbert is the boy he fought with years ago. Herbert tells Pip how Miss Havisham was defrauded and deserted by her fiancé. Pip meets fellow pupils, Bentley Drummle, a brute of a man from a wealthy noble family, and Startop, who is a more agreeable colleague. Jaggers disburses the money Pip needs. During a visit, Pip meets Jaggers&#x27;s housekeeper Molly, a former convict.

When Joe visits Pip at Barnard&#x27;s Inn, Pip is ashamed to be seen with him. Joe relays a message from Miss Havisham that Estella will be visiting her. Pip returns there to meet Estella and is encouraged by Miss Havisham, but he avoids visiting Joe. He is disquieted to see Orlick now in service to Miss Havisham. He mentions his misgivings to Jaggers, who promises Orlick&#x27;s dismissal. Back in London, Pip and Herbert exchange their romantic secrets: Pip adores Estella and Herbert is engaged to Clara. Pip meets Estella when she is sent to Richmond to be introduced into society.

Pip and Herbert build up debts. Mrs Joe dies and Pip returns to his village for her funeral. Pip&#x27;s income is fixed at £500 () per annum when he comes of age at 21. With the help of Jaggers&#x27; clerk, John Wemmick, Pip plans to help advance Herbert&#x27;s future prospects by anonymously securing him a position with the shipbroker, Clarriker&#x27;s. Pip takes Estella to Satis House, where she and Miss Havisham quarrel over Estella&#x27;s coldness. In London, Drummle outrages Pip by proposing a toast to Estella. Later, at an Assembly Ball in Richmond, Pip witnesses Estella meeting Drummle and warns her about him; she replies that she has no qualms about entrapping him.

A week after his 23rd birthday, Pip learns that his benefactor is the convict he encountered in the churchyard, Abel Magwitch, who had been transported to New South Wales after being captured. He has become wealthy after gaining his freedom there, but cannot return to England on pain of death. However, he returns to see Pip, who was the motivation for all his success.

===Third stage===
A shocked Pip stops taking Magwitch&#x27;s money, but devises a plan with Herbert to help him escape from England. Magwitch shares his past with Pip, and reveals that the escaped convict whom he fought in the churchyard was Compeyson, the fraudster who had deserted Miss Havisham.
Pip returns to Satis House to visit Estella and meets Drummle, who has also come to see her and now has Orlick as his servant. Pip confronts Miss Havisham for misleading him about his benefactor, but she says she did it to annoy her relatives. Pip declares his love to Estella, who coldly tells him that she plans on marrying Drummle. A heartbroken Pip returns to London, where Wemmick warns him that Compeyson is looking for him.

At Jaggers&#x27;s house at dinner, Wemmick tells Pip how Jaggers acquired his maidservant, Molly, rescuing her from the gallows when she was accused of murder. A remorseful Miss Havisham tells Pip how she raised Estella to be unfeeling and heartless ever since Jaggers brought her in as an infant with no information on her parentage. She also tells Pip that Estella is now married. She gives Pip money to pay for Herbert&#x27;s position at Clarriker&#x27;s, and asks for his forgiveness. As Pip is about to leave, Miss Havisham&#x27;s dress catches fire, and Pip injures himself in an unsuccessful attempt to save her. Realising that Estella is the daughter of Molly and Magwitch, Pip is discouraged by Jaggers from acting on his suspicions.
A few days before Magwitch&#x27;s planned escape, Pip is tricked by an anonymous letter into going to a sluice-house near his old home, where he is seized by Orlick, who intends to murder him and freely admits to injuring Pip&#x27;s sister. As Pip is about to be struck with a hammer, Herbert and Startop arrive and save him. The three of them pick up Magwitch to row him to the steamboat for Hamburg, but they are met by a police boat carrying Compeyson, who has offered to identify Magwitch. Magwitch seizes Compeyson, and they fight in the river. Seriously injured, Magwitch is taken by the police. Compeyson&#x27;s body is found later.

Aware that Magwitch&#x27;s fortune will go to the Crown after his trial, Pip visits a dying Magwitch in the prison hospital, and eventually tells him that his daughter Estella is alive. Herbert, who is preparing to move to Cairo, Egypt to manage Clarriker&#x27;s office, offers Pip a position there. After Herbert&#x27;s departure, Pip falls ill in his room, and faces arrest for debt. However, Joe nurses Pip back to health and pays off the debt. After recovering, Pip then returns to propose to Biddy, only to find that she has married Joe. Pip apologises to Joe, vows to repay him and leaves for Cairo. There he moves in with Herbert and Clara, and eventually advances to become third in the company. Only then does Herbert learn that Pip paid for his position in the firm.

After working for eleven years in Egypt, Pip returns to England and visits Joe, Biddy, and their son, Pip Jr. Then, in the ruins of Satis House, he meets the widowed Estella, who asks Pip to forgive her, assuring him that her misfortune, and her abusive marriage to Drummle until his death, has opened her heart. As Pip takes Estella&#x27;s hand, and they leave the moonlit ruins, he sees &quot;no shadow of another parting from her&quot;.

==Characters==

===Pip and his family===
* Philip Pirrip, nicknamed Pip, an orphan and the protagonist and narrator of &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. In his childhood, Pip dreamed of becoming a blacksmith like his kind brother-in-law, Joe Gargery. At Satis House, aged about 8, he meets and falls in love with Estella, and tells Biddy that he wants to become a gentleman. As a result of Magwitch&#x27;s anonymous patronage, Pip lives in London after learning the blacksmith trade, and becomes a gentleman. Pip assumes his benefactor is Miss Havisham; the discovery that his true benefactor is a convict shocks him. Pip, at the end of the story, is united with Estella. 
* Joe Gargery, Pip&#x27;s brother-in-law, and his first father figure. He is a blacksmith who is always kind to Pip and the only person with whom Pip is always honest. Joe is disappointed when Pip decides to leave his home to live in London to become a gentleman rather than be a blacksmith in business with Joe. He is a strong man who bears the shortcomings of those closest to him.
* Mrs Joe Gargery, Pip&#x27;s hot-tempered adult sister, Georgiana Maria, called Mrs Joe, is more than 20 years older than Pip. She brings him up after their parents&#x27; death. She does the work of the household but too often loses her temper and beats her family. Orlick, her husband&#x27;s journeyman, attacks her during a botched burglary, and she is left disabled until her death.
* Mr Pumblechook, Joe Gargery&#x27;s uncle, an bachelor and corn merchant. While not knowing how to deal with a growing boy, he tells Mrs Joe, as she is known, how noble she is to bring up Pip. As the person who first connected Pip to Miss Havisham, he claims to have been the original architect of Pip&#x27;s expectations. Pip dislikes Mr Pumblechook for his pompous, unfounded claims. When Pip stands up to him in a public place, after those expectations are dashed, Mr Pumblechook turns those listening to the conversation against Pip.

===Miss Havisham and her family===
* Miss Havisham, a wealthy spinster who takes Pip on as a companion for herself and her adopted daughter, Estella. Havisham is a wealthy, eccentric woman who has worn her wedding dress and one shoe since the day that she was jilted at the altar by her fiancé. Her house is unchanged as well. She hates all men, and plots to wreak a twisted revenge by teaching Estella to torment and spurn men, including Pip, who loves her. Miss Havisham is later overcome with remorse for ruining both Estella&#x27;s and Pip&#x27;s chances for happiness. Shortly after confessing her plotting to Pip and begging for his forgiveness, she is badly burned when her dress accidentally catches fire. In a later chapter Pip learns from Joe that she is dead.
* Estella, Miss Havisham&#x27;s adopted daughter, whom Pip pursues. She is a beautiful girl and grows more beautiful after her schooling in France. Estella represents the life of wealth and culture for which Pip strives. Since Miss Havisham has sabotaged Estella&#x27;s ability to love, Estella cannot return Pip&#x27;s passion. She warns Pip of this repeatedly, but he will not or cannot believe her. Estella does not know that she is the daughter of Molly, Jaggers&#x27;s housekeeper, and the convict Abel Magwitch, given up for adoption to Miss Havisham after her mother was arrested for murder. In marrying Bentley Drummle, she rebels against Miss Havisham&#x27;s plan to have her break a husband&#x27;s heart, as Drummle is not interested in Estella but simply in the Havisham fortune.
* Matthew Pocket, Miss Havisham&#x27;s cousin. He is the patriarch of the Pocket family, but unlike her other relatives, he is not greedy for Havisham&#x27;s wealth. Matthew Pocket tutors young gentlemen, such as Bentley Drummle, Startop, Pip and his own son Herbert.
* Herbert Pocket, the son of Matthew Pocket, who was invited like Pip to visit Miss Havisham, but she did not take to him. Pip first meets Herbert as a &quot;pale young gentleman&quot; who challenges Pip to a fistfight at Miss Havisham&#x27;s house when both are children. He later becomes Pip&#x27;s friend, tutoring him in the &quot;gentlemanly&quot; arts and sharing his rooms with Pip in London.
* Camilla, one of the sisters of Matthew Pocket, and therefore a cousin of Miss Havisham, she is an obsequious, detestable woman who is intent on pleasing Miss Havisham to get her money.
*Cousin Raymond, a relative of Miss Havisham who is only interested in her money. He is married to Camilla.
* Georgiana, a relative of Miss Havisham who is only interested in her money. She is one of the many relatives who hang around Miss Havisham &quot;like flies&quot; for her wealth.
* Sarah Pocket, the sister of Matthew Pocket, relative of Miss Havisham. She is often at Satis House. She is described as &quot;a dry, brown corrugated old woman, with a small face that might have been made out of walnut shells, and a large mouth like a cat&#x27;s without the whiskers&quot;.

===From Pip&#x27;s youth===
* Abel Magwitch, the convict, who escapes from a prison ship, whom Pip treats kindly, and who becomes Pip&#x27;s benefactor. Magwitch uses the aliases &quot;Provis&quot; and &quot;Mr. Campbell&quot; when he returns to England from exile in Australia. He is a lesser actor in crime with Compeyson, but gains a longer sentence in an apparent application of justice by social class.
* Mr and Mrs Hubble, simple folk who think they are more important than they really are. They live in Pip&#x27;s village.
* Mr Wopsle, clerk of the church in Pip&#x27;s village. He later gives up the church work and moves to London to pursue his ambition to be an actor, adopting the stage name &quot;Mr Waldengarver&quot;. He sees the other convict in the audience of one of his performances, attended also by Pip.
* Biddy, Wopsle&#x27;s second cousin and near Pip&#x27;s age; she teaches in the evening school at her grandmother&#x27;s home in Pip&#x27;s village. Pip wants to learn more, so he asks her to teach him all she can. After helping Mrs Joe after the attack, Biddy opens her own school. A kind and intelligent but poor young woman, she is, like Pip and Estella, an orphan. She acts as Estella&#x27;s foil. Orlick was attracted to her, but she did not want his attentions. Pip ignores her affections for him as he pursues Estella. Recovering from his own illness after the failed attempt to get Magwitch out of England, Pip returns to claim Biddy as his bride, arriving in the village just after she marries Joe Gargery. Biddy and Joe later have two children, one named after Pip. In the ending to the novel discarded by Dickens but revived by students of the novel&#x27;s development, Estella mistakes the boy as Pip&#x27;s child.

===Mr Jaggers and his circle===

* Mr Jaggers, prominent London lawyer who represents the interests of diverse clients, both criminal and civil. He represents Pip&#x27;s benefactor and Miss Havisham as well. By the end of the story, his law practice links many of the characters.
* John Wemmick, Jaggers&#x27;s clerk, who is Pip&#x27;s chief go-between with Jaggers and looks after Pip in London. Wemmick lives with his father, &quot;The Aged Parent&quot;, in a small replica of a castle, complete with a drawbridge and moat, in Walworth.
* Molly, Mr Jaggers&#x27;s maidservant whom Jaggers saved from the gallows for murder. She is revealed to be Magwitch&#x27;s estranged wife and Estella&#x27;s mother.

===Antagonists===
* Compeyson, a convict who escapes the prison ship after Magwitch, who beats him up ashore. He is Magwitch&#x27;s enemy. A professional swindler, he was engaged to marry Miss Havisham, but he was in league with her half-brother, Arthur Havisham, to defraud Miss Havisham of part of her fortune. Later he sets up Magwitch to take the fall for another swindle. He works with the police when he learns Abel Magwitch is in London, fearing Magwitch after their first escapes years earlier. When the police boat encounters the one carrying Magwitch, the two grapple, and Compeyson drowns in the Thames.
* Arthur Havisham, younger half brother of Miss Havisham, who plots with Compeyson to swindle her.
* Dolge Orlick, journeyman blacksmith at Joe Gargery&#x27;s forge. Strong, rude and sullen, he is as churlish as Joe is gentle and kind. He ends up in a fistfight with Joe over Mrs Gargery&#x27;s taunting, and Joe easily defeats him. This sets in motion an escalating chain of events that leads him secretly to assault Mrs Gargery and to try to kill her brother Pip. The police ultimately arrest him for housebreaking into Uncle Pumblechook&#x27;s, where he is later jailed.
* Bentley Drummle, a coarse, unintelligent young man from a wealthy noble family being &quot;the next heir but one to a baronetcy&quot;. Pip meets him at Mr Pocket&#x27;s house, as Drummle is also to be trained in gentlemanly skills. Drummle is hostile to Pip and everyone else. He is a rival for Estella&#x27;s attentions and eventually marries her and is said to abuse her. He dies from an accident following his mistreatment of a horse.

===Other characters===
* Clara Barley, a very poor girl living with her gout-ridden father. She marries Herbert Pocket near the novel&#x27;s end. She dislikes Pip at first because of his spendthrift ways. After she marries Herbert, they invite Pip to live with them.
* Miss Skiffins occasionally visits Wemmick&#x27;s house and wears green gloves. She changes those green gloves for white ones when she marries Wemmick.
* Startop, like Bentley Drummle, is Pip&#x27;s fellow student, but unlike Drummle, he is kind. He assists Pip and Herbert in their efforts to help Magwitch escape.

==The creative process==

As Dickens began writing &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, he undertook a series of hugely popular and remunerative reading tours. His domestic life had, however, disintegrated in the late 1850s and he had separated from his wife, Catherine Dickens, and was having a secret affair with the much younger Ellen Ternan. It has been suggested that the icy teasing of the character Estella is based on Ellen Ternan&#x27;s reluctance to become Dickens&#x27;s mistress.

===Beginning===
In his &quot;Book of Memoranda&quot;, begun in 1855, Dickens wrote names for possible characters: Magwitch, Provis, Clarriker, Compey, Pumblechook, Orlick, Gargery, Wopsle, Skiffins, some of which became familiar in &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. There is also a reference to a &quot;knowing man&quot;, a possible sketch of Bentley Drummle. Another evokes a house full of &quot;Toadies and Humbugs&quot;, foreshadowing the visitors to Satis House in chapter 11. Margaret Cardwell discovered the &quot;premonition&quot; of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; from a 25 September 1855 letter from Dickens to W. H. Wills, in which Dickens speaks of recycling an &quot;odd idea&quot; from the Christmas special &quot;A House to Let&quot; and &quot;the pivot round which my next book shall revolve&quot;. The &quot;odd idea&quot; concerns an individual who &quot;retires to an old lonely house…resolved to shut out the world and hold no communion with it&quot;.

In an 8 August 1860 letter to Thomas Carlyle, Dickens reported his agitation whenever he prepared a new book. A month later, in a letter to John Forster, Dickens announced that he just had a new idea.

===Publication in &quot;All the Year Round&quot;===

Dickens was pleased with the idea, calling it &quot;such a very fine, new and grotesque idea&quot; in a letter to Forster. He planned to write &quot;a little piece&quot;, a &quot;grotesque tragi-comic conception&quot;, about a young hero who befriends an escaped convict, who then makes a fortune in Australia and anonymously bequeaths his property to the hero. In the end, the hero loses the money because it is forfeited to the Crown. In his biography of Dickens, Forster wrote that in the early idea &quot;was the germ of Pip and Magwitch, which at first he intended to make the groundwork of a tale in the old twenty-number form&quot;. Dickens presented the relationship between Pip and Magwitch pivotal to &quot;Great Expectations&quot; but without Miss Havisham, Estella, or other characters he later created.

As the idea and Dickens&#x27;s ambition grew, he began writing. However, in September, the weekly &quot;All the Year Round&quot; saw its sales fall, and its flagship publication, &quot;A Day&#x27;s Ride&quot; by Charles Lever, lost favour with the public. Dickens &quot;called a council of war&quot;, and believed that to save the situation, &quot;the one thing to be done was for [him] to strike in&quot;. The &quot;very fine, new and grotesque idea&quot; became the magazine&#x27;s new support: weeklies, five hundred pages, just over one year (1860–1861), thirty-six episodes, starting 1 December. The magazine continued to publish Lever&#x27;s novel until its completion on 23 March 1861, but it became secondary to &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. Immediately, sales resumed, and critics responded positively, as exemplified by &quot;The Times&quot;″s praise: &quot;&quot;Great Expectations&quot; is not, indeed, [Dickens&#x27;s] best work, but it is to be ranked among his happiest&quot;.

Dickens, whose health was not the best, felt &quot;The planning from week to week was unimaginably difficult&quot; but persevered. He thought he had found &quot;a good name&quot;, decided to use the first person &quot;throughout&quot;, and thought the beginning was &quot;excessively droll&quot;: &quot;I have put a child and a good-natured foolish man, in relations that seem to me very funny&quot;. Four weekly episodes were &quot;ground off the wheel&quot; in October 1860, and apart from one reference to the &quot;bondage&quot; of his heavy task, the months passed without the anguished cries that usually accompanied the writing of his novels. He did not even use the &quot;Number Plans&quot; or &quot;Mems&quot;; he had only a few notes on the characters&#x27; ages, the tide ranges for chapter 54, and the draft of an ending. In late December, Dickens wrote to Mary Boyle that &quot;&quot;Great Expectations&quot; [is] a very great success and universally liked&quot;.
Dickens gave six readings from 14 March to 18 April 1861, and in May, Dickens took a few days&#x27; holiday in Dover. On the eve of his departure, he took some friends and family members for a trip by boat from Blackwall to Southend-on-Sea. Ostensibly for pleasure, the mini-cruise was actually a working session for Dickens to examine banks of the river in preparation for the chapter devoted to Magwitch&#x27;s attempt to escape. Dickens then revised Herbert Pocket&#x27;s appearance, no doubt, asserts Margaret Cardwell, to look more like his son Charley. On 11 June 1861, Dickens wrote to Macready that &quot;Great Expectations&quot; had been completed and on 15 June, asked the editor to prepare the novel for publication.

===Revised ending===
Following comments by Edward Bulwer-Lytton that the ending was too sad, Dickens rewrote it prior to publication. The ending set aside by Dickens has Pip, who is still single, briefly see Estella in London; after becoming Bentley Drummle&#x27;s widow, she has remarried. It appealed to Dickens due to its originality: &quot;[the] winding up will be away from all such things as they conventionally go&quot;. Dickens revised the ending for publication so that Pip meets Estella in the ruins of Satis House, she is a widow and he is single. His changes at the conclusion of the novel did not quite end either with the final weekly part or the first bound edition, because Dickens further changed the last sentence in the amended 1868 version from &quot;I could see the shadow of no parting from her&quot; to &quot;I saw no shadow of another parting from her&quot;. As Pip uses litotes, &quot;no shadow of another parting&quot;, it is ambiguous whether Pip and Estella marry or Pip remains single. Angus Calder, writing for an edition in the Penguin English Library, believed the less definite phrasing of the amended 1868 version perhaps hinted at a buried meaning: &#x27;at this happy moment, I did not see the shadow of our subsequent parting looming over us.&#x27;

In a letter to Forster, Dickens explained his decision to alter the draft ending: &quot;You will be surprised to hear that I have changed the end of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; from and after Pip&#x27;s return to Joe&#x27;s ... Bulwer, who has been, as I think you know, extraordinarily taken with the book, strongly urged it upon me, after reading the proofs, and supported his views with such good reasons that I have resolved to make the change. I have put in as pretty a little piece of writing as I could, and I have no doubt the story will be more acceptable through the alteration&quot;.

This discussion between Dickens, Bulwer-Lytton and Forster has provided the basis for much discussion on Dickens&#x27;s underlying views for this famous novel. Earle Davis, in his 1963 study of Dickens, wrote that &quot;it would be an inadequate moral point to deny Pip any reward after he had shown a growth of character,&quot; and that &quot;Eleven years might change Estella too&quot;. John Forster felt that the original ending was &quot;more consistent&quot; and &quot;more natural&quot; but noted the new ending&#x27;s popularity. George Gissing called that revision &quot;a strange thing, indeed, to befall Dickens&quot; and felt that &quot;Great Expectations&quot; would have been perfect had Dickens not altered the ending in deference to Bulwer-Lytton.

In contrast, John Hillis-Miller stated that Dickens&#x27;s personality was so assertive that Bulwer-Lytton had little influence, and welcomed the revision: &quot;The mists of infatuation have cleared away, [Estella and Pip] can be joined&quot;. Earl Davis notes that G. B. Shaw published the novel in 1937 for &quot;The Limited Editions Club&quot; with the first ending and that &quot;The Rinehart Edition&quot; of 1979 presents both endings.

George Orwell wrote, &quot;Psychologically the latter part of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is about the best thing Dickens ever did,&quot; but, like John Forster and several early 20th century writers, including George Bernard Shaw, felt that the original ending was more consistent with the draft, as well as the natural working out of the tale. Modern literary criticism is split over the matter.

==Publication history==

===In periodicals===
Dickens and Wills co-owned &quot;All the Year Round&quot;, one 75%, the other 25%. Since Dickens was his own publisher, he did not require a contract for his own works. Although intended for weekly publication, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; was divided into nine monthly sections, with new pagination for each. &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; published the novel from 24 November 1860 to 5 August 1861 in the US and &quot;All the Year Round&quot; published it from 1 December 1860 to 3 August 1861 in the UK. &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; paid £1,000 () for publication rights. Dickens welcomed a contract with &quot;Tauchnitz&quot; 4 January 1861 for publication in English for the European continent.

Publications in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; were accompanied by forty illustrations by John McLenan; however, this is the only Dickens work published in &quot;All the Year Round&quot; without illustrations.

===Editions===
Robert L Patten identifies four American editions in 1861 and sees the proliferation of publications in Europe and across the Atlantic as &quot;extraordinary testimony&quot; to &quot;Great Expectations&quot;″s popularity. Chapman and Hall published the first edition in three volumes in 1861, five subsequent reprints between 6 July and 30 October, and a one-volume edition in 1862. The &quot;bargain&quot; edition was published in 1862, the Library Edition in 1864, and the Charles Dickens edition in 1868. To this list, Paul Schlicke adds &quot;two meticulous scholarly editions&quot;, one Clarendon Press published in 1993 with an introduction by Margaret Cardwell and another with an introduction by Edgar Rosenberg, published by Norton in 1999. The novel was published with one ending (visible in the four online editions listed in the External links at the end of this article). In some 20th century editions, the novel ends as originally published in 1867, and in an afterword, the ending Dickens did not publish, along with a brief story of how a friend persuaded him to a happier ending for Pip, is presented to the reader (for example, 1987 audio edition by Recorded Books).

In 1862, Marcus Stone, son of Dickens&#x27;s old friend, the painter Frank Stone, was invited to create eight woodcuts for the Library Edition. According to Paul Schlicke, these illustrations are mediocre yet were included in the Charles Dickens edition, and Stone created illustrations for Dickens&#x27;s subsequent novel, &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;. Later, Henry Mathew Brock also illustrated &quot;Great Expectations&quot; and a 1935 edition of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, along with other artists, such as John McLenan, F. A. Fraser, and Harry Furniss.

===First edition publication schedule===
==Reception==
Robert L. Patten estimates that &quot;All the Year Round&quot; sold 100,000 copies of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; each week, and Mudie, the largest circulating library, which purchased about 1,400 copies, stated that at least 30 people read each copy. Aside from the dramatic plot, the Dickensian humour also appealed to readers. Dickens wrote to Forster in October 1860 that &quot;You will not have to complain of the want of humour as in the &quot;Tale of Two Cities&quot;,&quot; an opinion Forster supports, finding that &quot;Dickens&#x27;s humour, not less than his creative power, was at its best in this book&quot;. Moreover, according to Paul Schlicke, readers found the best of Dickens&#x27;s older and newer writing styles.

Overall, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; was widely praised, although not all reviews were favourable, however; Margaret Oliphant&#x27;s review, published May 1862 in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, vilified the novel. Critics in the 19th and 20th centuries hailed it as one of Dickens&#x27;s greatest successes although often for conflicting reasons: G. K. Chesterton admired the novel&#x27;s optimism; Edmund Wilson its pessimism; Humphry House in 1941 emphasized its social context. In 1974, Jerome H. Buckley saw it as a &quot;Bildungsroman&quot;, writing a chapter on Dickens and two of his major protagonists (David Copperfield and Pip) in his 1974 book on the Bildungsroman in Victorian writing. John Hillis Miller wrote in 1958 that Pip is the archetype of all Dickensian heroes. In 1970, Q. D. Leavis suggested &quot;How We Must Read &quot;Great Expectations&quot;&quot;. In 1984, Peter Brooks, in the wake of Jacques Derrida, offered a deconstructionist reading. The most profound analyst, according to Paul Schlicke, is probably Julian Moynahan, who, in a 1964 essay surveying the hero&#x27;s guilt, made Orlick &quot;Pip&#x27;s double, alter ego and dark mirror image&quot;. Schlicke also names Anny Sadrin&#x27;s extensive 1988 study as the &quot;most distinguished&quot;.

In 2015, the BBC polled book critics outside the UK about novels by British authors; they ranked &quot;Great Expectations&quot; fourth on the list of the 100 Greatest British Novels. Earlier, in its 2003 poll The Big Read concerning the reading taste of the British public, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; was voted 17th out of the top 100 novels chosen by survey participants.

==Background==
&quot;Great Expectations&quot;″s single most obvious literary predecessor is Dickens&#x27;s earlier first-person protagonist-narrated &quot;David Copperfield&quot;. The two novels trace the psychological and moral development of a young boy to maturity, his transition from a rural environment to the London metropolis, the vicissitudes of his emotional development, and the exhibition of his hopes and youthful dreams and their metamorphosis, through a rich and complex first person narrative. Dickens was conscious of this similarity and, before undertaking his new manuscript, reread &quot;David Copperfield&quot; to avoid repetition.

The two books both detail homecoming. Although &quot;David Copperfield&quot; is based on some of Dickens&#x27;s personal experiences, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; provides, according to Paul Schlicke, &quot;the more spiritual and intimate autobiography&quot;. Details of where the novel is set are not given, but according to John Forster, Dickens based Satis House on Restoration House, which was near to where he lived in Rochester, Kent. &quot;Satis House&quot; was the house where Rochester MP, Sir Richard Watts, entertained Queen Elizabeth I. Furthermore, no a specific time period is given, but it is indicated in general terms by reference older coaches, the title &quot;His Majesty&quot; in reference to George III (1738 – 1820), and to the old London Bridge that existed prior to the 1824–1831 reconstruction.


The theme of homecoming reflects events in Dickens&#x27;s life, several years prior to the publication of &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. In 1856, he bought Gad&#x27;s Hill Place in Higham, Kent, which he had dreamed of living in as a child, and moved there from faraway London two years later. In 1858, in a painful marriage breakdown, he separated from Catherine Dickens, his wife of twenty-three years. The separation alienated him from some of his closest friends, such as Mark Lemon. He quarrelled with Bradbury and Evans, who had published his novels for fifteen years. In early September 1860, in a field behind Gad&#x27;s Hill, Dickens burned almost all of his correspondence, sparing only letters on business matters. He stopped publishing the weekly &quot;Household Words&quot; at the summit of its popularity and replaced it with &quot;All the Year Round&quot;.

&quot;The Uncommercial Traveller&quot;, short stories, and other texts Dickens began publishing in his new weekly in 1859 reflect his nostalgia, as seen in &quot;Dullborough Town&quot; and &quot;Nurses&#x27; Stories&quot;. According to Paul Schlicke, &quot;it is hardly surprising that the novel Dickens wrote at this time was a return to roots, set in the part of England in which he grew up, and in which he had recently resettled&quot;.

Margaret Cardwell draws attention to Chops the Dwarf from Dickens&#x27;s 1858 Christmas story &quot;Going into Society&quot;, who, as the future Pip does, entertains the illusion of inheriting a fortune and becomes disappointed upon achieving his social ambitions. In another vein, Harry Stone thinks that Gothic and magical aspects of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; were partly inspired by Charles Mathews&#x27;s &quot;At Home&quot;, which was presented in detail in &quot;Household Words&quot; and its monthly supplement &quot;Household Narrative&quot;. Stone also asserts that &quot;The Lazy Tour of Two Idle Apprentices&quot;, written in collaboration with Wilkie Collins after their walking tour of Cumberland during September 1857 and published in &quot;Household Words&quot; from 3 to 31 October of the same year, presents certain strange locations and a passionate love, foreshadowing &quot;Great Expectations&quot;.

Beyond its biographical and literary aspects, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; appears, according to Robin Gilmour, as &quot;a representative fable of the age&quot;. Dickens was aware that the novel &quot;speaks&quot; to a generation applying, at most, the principle of &quot;self help&quot; which was believed to have increased the order of daily life. That the hero Pip aspires to improve, not through snobbery, but through the Victorian conviction of education, social refinement, and materialism, was seen as a noble and worthy goal. However, by tracing the origins of Pip&#x27;s &quot;great expectations&quot; to crime, deceit and even banishment to the colonies, Dickens unfavourably compares the new generation to the previous one of Joe Gargery, which Dickens portrays as less sophisticated but especially rooted in sound values, presenting an oblique criticism of his time.

==Structure==
The narrative structure of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is influenced by the fact that it was first published as weekly episodes in a periodical. This required short chapters, centred on a single subject, and an almost mathematical structure.

===Chronology===
Pip&#x27;s story is told in three stages: his childhood and early youth in Kent, where he dreams of rising above his humble station; his time in London after receiving &quot;great expectations&quot;; and then finally his disillusionment on discovering the source of his fortune, followed by his slow realisation of the vanity of his false values. These three stages are further divided into twelve parts of equal length. This symmetry contributes to the impression of completion, which has often been commented on. George Gissing, for example, when comparing Joe Gargery and Dan&#x27;l Peggotty (from &quot;David Copperfield&quot;), preferred the former, because he is a stronger character, who lives &quot;in a world, not of melodrama, but of everyday cause and effect&quot;. G. B. Shaw also commented on the novel&#x27;s structure, describing it as &quot;compactly perfect&quot;, and Algernon Swinburne stated, &quot;The defects in it are as nearly imperceptible as spots on the sun or shadow on a sunlit sea&quot;. A contributing factor is &quot;the briskness of the narrative tone&quot;.

===Narrative flow===
Further, beyond the chronological sequences and the weaving of several storylines into a tight plot, the sentimental setting and morality of the characters also create a pattern. The narrative structure of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; has two main elements: firstly that of &quot;foster parents&quot;, Miss Havisham, Magwitch, and Joe, and secondly that of &quot;young people&quot;, Estella, Pip and Biddy. There is a further organizing element that can be labelled &quot;Dangerous Lovers&quot;, which includes Compeyson, Bentley Drummle and Orlick. Pip is the centre of this web of love, rejection and hatred. Dickens contrasts this &quot;dangerous love&quot; with the relationship of Biddy and Joe, which grows from friendship to marriage.

This is &quot;the general frame of the novel&quot;. The term &quot;love&quot; is generic, applying it to both Pip&#x27;s true love for Estella and the feelings Estella has for Drummle, which are based on a desire for social advancement. Similarly, Estella rejects Magwitch because of her contempt for everything that appears below what she believes to be her social status.

&quot;Great Expectations&quot; has an unhappy ending, since most characters suffer physically, psychologically or both, or die—often violently—while suffering. Happy resolutions remain elusive, while hate thrives. The only happy ending is Biddy and Joe&#x27;s marriage and the birth of their two children, since the final reconciliations, except that between Pip and Magwitch, do not alter the general order. Though Pip extirpates the web of hatred, the first unpublished ending denies him happiness while Dickens&#x27;s revised second ending, in the published novel, leaves his future uncertain.

=== Orlick as Pip&#x27;s double ===
Julian Moynahan argues that the reader can better understand Pip&#x27;s personality through analysing his relationship with Orlick, the criminal laborer who works at Joe Gargery&#x27;s forge, than by looking at his relationship with Magwitch.
Following Moynahan, David Trotter notes that Orlick is Pip&#x27;s shadow. Co-workers in the forge, both find themselves at Miss Havisham&#x27;s, where Pip enters and joins the company, while Orlick, attending the door, stays out. Pip considers Biddy a sister; Orlick has other plans for her; Pip is connected to Magwitch, Orlick to Magwitch&#x27;s nemesis, Compeyson. Orlick also aspires to &quot;great expectations&quot; and resents Pip&#x27;s ascension from the forge and the swamp to the glamour of Satis House, from which Orlick is excluded, along with London&#x27;s dazzling society. Orlick is the cumbersome shadow Pip cannot remove.

Then comes Pip&#x27;s punishment, with Orlick&#x27;s savage attack on Mrs Gargery. Thereafter Orlick vanishes, only to reappear in chapter 53 in a symbolic act, when he lures Pip into a locked, abandoned building in the marshes. Orlick has a score to settle before going on to the ultimate act, murder. However, Pip hampers Orlick, because of his privileged status, while Orlick remains a slave of his condition, solely responsible for Mrs Gargery&#x27;s fate.

Dickens also uses Pip&#x27;s upper class counterpart, Bentley Drummle, &quot;the double of a double&quot;, according to Trotter, in a similar way. Like Orlick, Drummle is powerful, swarthy, unintelligible, hot-blooded, and lounges and lurks, biding his time. Estella rejects Pip for this rude, uncouth but well-born man, and ends Pip&#x27;s hope. Finally the lives of both Orlick and Drummle end violently.

==Point of view==

Although the novel is written in first person, the reader knows—as an essential prerequisite—that &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is not an autobiography but a novel, a work of fiction with plot and characters, featuring a narrator-protagonist. In addition, Sylvère Monod notes that the treatment of the autobiography differs from &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, as &quot;Great Expectations&quot; does not draw from events in Dickens&#x27;s life; &quot;at most some traces of a broad psychological and moral introspection can be found&quot;.

However, according to Paul Pickerel&#x27;s analysis, Pip—as both narrator and protagonist—recounts with hindsight the story of the young boy he was, who did not know the world beyond a narrow geographic and familial environment. The novel&#x27;s direction emerges from the confrontation between the two periods of time. At first, the novel presents a mistreated orphan, repeating situations from &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; and &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, but the trope is quickly overtaken. The theme manifests itself when Pip discovers the existence of a world beyond the marsh, the forge and the future Joe envisioned for him, the decisive moment when Miss Havisham and Estella enter his life. This is a red herring, as the decay of Satis House and the strange lady within signals the fragility of an impasse. At this point, the reader knows more than the protagonist, creating dramatic irony that confers a superiority that the narrator shares.

It is not until Magwitch&#x27;s return, a plot twist that unites loosely connected plot elements and sets them into motion, that the protagonist&#x27;s point of view joins those of the narrator and the reader. In this context of progressive revelation, the sensational events at the novel&#x27;s end serve to test the protagonist&#x27;s point of view. Thus proceeds, in the words of A. E. Dyson, &quot;The Immolations of Pip&quot;.

== Style ==
Some of the narrative devices that Dickens uses are caricature, comic speech mannerisms, intrigue, Gothic atmosphere, and a central character who gradually changes. Earl Davis notes the close network of the structure and balance of contrasts, and praises the first-person narration for providing a simplicity that is appropriate for the story while avoiding melodrama. Davis sees the symbolism attached to &quot;great expectations&quot; as reinforcing the novel&#x27;s impact.

=== Characterisation ===

==== Character &quot;leitmotiv&quot; ====

Characters then become themes in themselves, almost a Wagnerian &quot;leitmotiv&quot;, whose attitudes are repeated at each of their appearances as a musical phrase signaling their entry. For example, Jaggers constantly chews the same fingernail and washes his hands with scented soap, Orlick lurches his huge body, and Matthew Pocket always pulls at his hair. Seen by the narrator, their attitude is mechanical, like that of an automaton: in the general scheme, the gesture betrays the uneasiness of the unaccomplished or exasperated man, his betrayed hope, his unsatisfied life. In this set, every character is orbited by &quot;satellite&quot; characters. Wemmick is Jaggers&#x27;s copy at work, but has placed in Walworth a secret garden, a castle with a family of an elderly father and a middle-aged fiancée, where he happily devours buttered bread. Wopsle plays the role of a poor Pip, kind of unsuccessful, but with his distraction, finally plays &quot;Hamlet&quot; in London, and Pumblechook does not hesitate to be the instrument of Pip&#x27;s fortunes, then the mentor of his resurrection.

==== Narrative technique ====
For Pip&#x27;s redemption to be credible, Trotter writes, the words of the main character must sound right. Christopher Ricks adds that Pip&#x27;s frankness induces empathy, dramatics are avoided, and his good actions are more eloquent than words. Dickens&#x27;s subtle narrative technique is also shown when he has Pip confess that he arranged Herbert&#x27;s partnership with Clarriker, has Miss Havisham finally see the true character of her cousin Matthew Pocket, and has Pocket refuse the money she offers him. To this end, the narrative method subtly changes until, during the perilous journey down the Thames to remove Magwitch in chapter 54, the narrative point-of-view shifts from first person to the omniscient point of view. For the first time, Ricks writes, the &quot;I&quot; ceases to be Pip&#x27;s thoughts and switches to the other characters, the focus, at once, turns outward, and this is mirrored in the imagery of the black waters tormented waves and eddies, which heaves with an anguish that encompasses the entire universe, the passengers, the docks, the river, the night.

=== Romantic and symbolic realism ===
According to Paul Davis, while more realistic than its autobiographical predecessor written when novels like George Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Adam Bede&quot; were in vogue, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is in many ways a poetic work built around recurring symbolic images: the desolation of the marshes; the twilight; the chains of the house, the past, the painful memory; the fire; the hands that manipulate and control; the distant stars of desire; the river connecting past, present and future.

==Genre==
&quot;Great Expectations&quot; contains a variety of literary genres, including the bildungsroman, gothic novel, crime novel, as well as comedy, melodrama and satire; and it belongs—like &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and the novels of Walter Scott—to the romance rather than realist tradition of the novel.

===&quot;Bildungsroman&quot;===
Complex and multifaceted, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a Victorian &quot;bildungsroman&quot;, or initiatory tale, which focuses on a protagonist who matures over the course of the novel. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; describes Pip&#x27;s initial frustration upon leaving home, followed by a long and difficult period that is punctuated with conflicts between his desires and the values of established order. During this time he re-evaluates his life and re-enters society on new foundations.

However, the novel differs from the two preceding pseudo-autobiographies, &quot;David Copperfield&quot; and &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1852), (though the latter is only partially narrated in first-person), in that it also partakes of several sub-genres popular in Dickens&#x27;s time.

===Comic novel===
&quot;Great Expectations&quot; contains many comic scenes and eccentric personalities, integral parts to both the plot and the theme. Among the notable comic episodes are Pip&#x27;s Christmas dinner in chapter 4, Wopsle&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; performance in chapter 31, and Wemmick&#x27;s marriage in chapter 55. Many of the characters have eccentricities: Jaggers with his punctilious lawyerly ways; the contrariness of his clerk, Wemmick, at work advising Pip to invest in &quot;portable property&quot;, while in private living in a cottage converted into a castle; and the reclusive Miss Havisham in her decaying mansion, wearing her tattered bridal robes.

===Crime fiction===

&quot;Great Expectations&quot; incorporates elements of the new genre of crime fiction, which Dickens had already used in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1837), and which was being developed by his friends Wilkie Collins and William Harrison Ainsworth. With its scenes of convicts, prison ships, and episodes of bloody violence, Dickens creates characters worthy of the Newgate school of fiction.

===Gothic novel===
&quot;Great Expectations&quot; contains elements of the Gothic genre, especially Miss Havisham, the bride frozen in time, and the ruined Satis House filled with weeds and spiders. Other characters linked to this genre include the aristocratic Bentley Drummle, because of his extreme cruelty; Pip himself, who spends his youth chasing a frozen beauty; the monstrous Orlick, who systematically attempts to murder his employers. Then there is the fight to the death between Compeyson and Magwitch, and the fire that ends up killing Miss Havisham, scenes dominated by horror, suspense, and the sensational.

=== Silver-fork novel ===
Elements of the silver-fork novel are found in the character of Miss Havisham and her world, as well as Pip&#x27;s illusions. This genre, which flourished in the 1820s and 1830s, presents the flashy elegance and aesthetic frivolities found in high society. In some respects, Dickens conceived &quot;Great Expectations&quot; as an anti silver fork novel, attacking Charles Lever&#x27;s novel &quot;A Day&#x27;s Ride&quot;, publication of which began January 1860, in &quot;Household Words&quot;. This can be seen in the way that Dickens satirises the pretensions and morals of Miss Havisham and her sycophants, including the Pockets (except Matthew), and Uncle Pumblechook.

=== Historical novel ===

Though &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is not obviously a historical novel, Dickens does emphasise differences between the time that the novel is set (–46) and when it was written (1860–1).

&quot;Great Expectations&quot; begins around 1812 (the year of Dickens&#x27;s birth), continues until around 1830–1835, and then jumps to around 1840–1845, during which the Great Western Railway was built. Though readers today will not notice this, Dickens uses various things to emphasise the differences between 1861 and this earlier period. Among these details—that contemporary readers would have recognised—are the one pound note (in chapter 10) that the Bank Notes Act 1826 had removed from circulation; likewise, the death penalty for deported felons who returned to Britain was abolished in 1835. The gallows erected in the swamps, designed to display a rotting corpse, had disappeared by 1832, and George III, the monarch mentioned at the beginning, died in 1820, when Pip would have been seven or eight.

Miss Havisham paid Joe 25 guineas, gold coins, when Pip was to begin his apprenticeship (in chapter 13); guinea coins were slowly going out of circulation after the last new ones were struck with the face of George III in 1799. This also marks the historical period, as the one pound note was the official currency at the time of the novel&#x27;s publication. Dickens placed the epilogue 11 years after Magwitch&#x27;s death, which seems to be the time limit of the reported facts. Collectively, the details suggest that Dickens identified with the main character. If Pip is around 23 toward the middle of the novel and 34 at its end, he is roughly modeled after his creator who turned 34 in 1846.

==Themes==
The title&#x27;s &quot;Expectations&quot; refers to &quot;a legacy to come&quot;, and thus immediately announces that money, or more specifically wealth plays an important part in the novel. Some other major themes are crime, social class, including both gentility, and social alienation, imperialism and ambition. The novel is also concerned with questions relating to conscience and moral regeneration, as well as redemption through love.

=== Pip&#x27;s name ===
Dickens famously created comic and telling names for his characters, but in &quot;Great Expectations&quot; he goes further. The first sentence of the novel establishes that Pip&#x27;s proper name is Philip Pirrip—the wording of his father&#x27;s gravestone—which &quot;my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip&quot;. The name Philip Pirrip (or Pirrip) is never again used in the novel. In Chapter 18, when he receives his expectation from an anonymous benefactor, the first condition attached to it is &quot;that you always bear the name of Pip&quot;.

In Chapter 22, when Pip establishes his friendship with Herbert Pocket, he attempts to introduce himself as Philip. Herbert immediately rejects the name: I don&#x27;t take to Philip,&#x27; said he, smiling, &#x27;for it sounds like a moral boy out of the spelling-book and decides to refer to Pip exclusively as Handel: Would you mind Handel for a familiar name? There&#x27;s a charming piece of music by Handel, called the &quot;Harmonious Blacksmith&quot;&#x27;&quot;. The only other place he is referred to as Philip is in Chapter 44, when he receives a letter addressed to &quot;Philip Pip&quot; from his friend Wemmick, which says &quot;DON&#x27;T GO HOME&quot;.

=== Pip as social outcast ===

A central theme here is of people living as social outcasts. The novel&#x27;s opening setting emphasises this: the orphaned Pip lives in an isolated foggy environment next to a graveyard, dangerous swamps, and prison ships. Furthermore, &quot;I was always treated as if I had insisted on being born in opposition to the dictates of reason, religion and morality&quot;.

Pip feels excluded by society and this leads to his aggressive attitude towards it, as he tries to win his place within it through any means. Various other characters behave similarly—that is, the oppressed become the oppressors. Jaggers dominates Wemmick, who in turn dominates Jaggers&#x27;s clients. Likewise, Magwitch uses Pip as an instrument of vengeance, as Miss Havisham uses Estella.

However, Pip has hope despite his sense of exclusion because he is convinced that divine providence owes him a place in society and that marriage to Estella is his destiny. Therefore, when fortune comes his way, Pip shows no surprise, because he believes that his value as a human being and his inherent nobility have been recognized. Thus, Pip accepts Pumblechook&#x27;s flattery without blinking: &quot;That boy is no common boy&quot; and the &quot;May I? &quot;May&quot; I?&quot; associated with handshakes.

From Pip&#x27;s hope comes his &quot;uncontrollable, impossible love for Estella&quot;, despite the humiliations to which she has subjected him. For Pip, winning a place in society also means winning Estella&#x27;s heart.

=== Wealth ===
When the money secretly provided by Magwitch enables Pip to enter London society, two new related themes, wealth and gentility, are introduced.

As the novel&#x27;s title implies, money is a theme of &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. Central to this is the idea that wealth is only acceptable to the ruling class if it comes from the labour of others. Miss Havisham&#x27;s wealth comes not from the sweat of her brow but from rent collected on properties she inherited from her father, a brewer. Her wealth is &quot;pure&quot;, and her father&#x27;s profession as a brewer does not contaminate it. Herbert states in chapter 22 that &quot;while you cannot possibly be genteel and bake, you may be as genteel as never was and brew&quot;. Because of her wealth, the old lady, despite her eccentricity, enjoys public esteem. She remains in a constant business relationship with her lawyer Jaggers and keeps a tight grip over her &quot;court&quot; of sycophants, so that, far from representing social exclusion, she is the very image of a powerful landed aristocracy that is frozen in the past and &quot;embalmed in its own pride&quot;.

On the other hand, Magwitch&#x27;s wealth is socially unacceptable, firstly because he earned it, not through the efforts of others, but through his own hard work, and secondly because he was a convict, and he earned it in a penal colony. It is argued that the contrast with Miss Havisham&#x27;s wealth is suggested symbolically. Thus Magwitch&#x27;s money smells of sweat, and his money is greasy and crumpled: &quot;two fat sweltering one-pound notes that seemed to have been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle market in the country&quot;, while the coins Miss Havisham gives for Pip&#x27;s &quot;indentures&quot; shine as if new. Further, it is argued Pip demonstrates his &quot;good breeding&quot;, because when he discovers that he owes his transformation into a &quot;gentleman&quot; to such a contaminated windfall, he is repulsed. A. O. J. Cockshut, however, has suggested that there is no difference between Magwitch&#x27;s wealth and that of Miss Havisham.

Trotter emphasizes the importance of Magwitch&#x27;s greasy banknotes. Beyond Pip&#x27;s emotional reaction the notes reveal that Dickens&#x27;s views on social and economic progress have changed in the years prior to the publication of &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. His novels and &quot;Household Words&quot; extensively reflect Dickens&#x27;s views, and his efforts to contribute to social progress expanded in the 1840s. To illustrate his point, he cites Humphry House who, succinctly, writes that in &quot;Pickwick Papers&quot;, &quot;a bad smell was a bad smell&quot;, whereas in &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; and &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, &quot;it is a problem&quot;.
At the time of The Great Exhibition of 1851, Dickens and Richard Henry Horne, an editor of &quot;Household Words&quot;, wrote an article comparing the British technology that created the Crystal Palace to the few artifacts exhibited by China: England represented an openness to worldwide trade and China isolationism. &quot;To compare China and England is to compare Stoppage to Progress&quot;, they concluded. According to Trotter, this was a way to target the Tory government&#x27;s return to protectionism, which they felt would make England the China of Europe. In fact, &quot;Household Words&quot;&#x27; 17 May 1856 issue championed international free trade, comparing the constant flow of money to the circulation of the blood. In the 1850s, Dickens believed in &quot;genuine&quot; wealth, which critic Trotter compares to fresh banknotes, crisp to the touch, pure and odorless.

With &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, Dickens&#x27;s views about wealth have changed. However, though some sharp satire exists, no character in the novel has the role of the moralist that condemn Pip and his society. In fact, even Joe and Biddy themselves, paragons of good sense, are complicit, through their exaggerated innate humility, in Pip&#x27;s social deviancy. Dickens&#x27;s moral judgement is first made through the way that he contrasts characters: only a few characters keep to the straight and narrow path; Joe, whose values remain unchanged; Matthew Pocket whose pride renders him, to his family&#x27;s astonishment, unable to flatter his rich relatives; Jaggers, who keeps a cool head and has no illusions about his clients; Biddy, who overcomes her shyness to, from time to time, bring order. The narrator-hero is left to draw the necessary conclusions: in the end, Pip finds the light and embarks on a path of moral regeneration.

===London as prison===

In London, neither wealth nor gentility brings happiness. Pip, the apprentice gentleman constantly bemoans his anxiety, his feelings of insecurity, and multiple allusions to overwhelming chronic unease, to weariness, drown his enthusiasm (chapter 34). Wealth, in effect, eludes his control: the more he spends, the deeper he goes into debt to satisfy new needs, which were just as futile as his old ones.

His unusual path to gentility has the opposite effect to what he expected: infinite opportunities become available, certainly, but will power, in proportion, fades and paralyses the soul. In the crowded metropolis, Pip grows disenchanted, disillusioned, and lonely. Alienated from his native Kent, he has lost the support provided by the village blacksmith. In London, he is powerless to join a community, not the Pocket family, much less Jaggers&#x27;s circle. London has become Pip&#x27;s prison and, like the convicts of his youth, he is bound in chains: &quot;no Satis House can be built merely with money&quot;.

=== Gentility ===

The idea of &quot;good breeding&quot; and what makes for a &quot;gentleman&quot; other than money, in other words, &quot;gentility&quot;, is a central theme of &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. The convict Magwitch covets it by proxy through Pip; Mrs Pocket dreams of acquiring it; it is also found in Pumblechook&#x27;s sycophancy; it is even seen in Joe, when he stammers between &quot;Pip&quot; and &quot;Sir&quot; during his visit to London, and when Biddy&#x27;s letters to Pip suddenly become reverent.

There are other characters who are associated with the idea of gentility like, for example, Miss Havisham&#x27;s seducer, Compeyson, the scarred-face convict. While Compeyson is corrupt, even Magwitch does not forget he is a gentleman. This also includes Estella, who ignores the fact that she is the daughter of Magwitch and another criminal.

There are a couple of ways by which someone can acquire gentility, one being a title, another being family ties to the upper middle class. Mrs Pocket bases every aspiration on the fact that her grandfather failed to be knighted, while Pip hopes that Miss Havisham will eventually adopt him, as adoption, as evidenced by Estella, who behaves like a born and bred little lady, is acceptable. But even more important, though not sufficient, are wealth and education. Pip knows that and endorses it, as he hears from Jaggers through Matthew Pocket: &quot;I was not designed for any profession, and I should be well enough educated for my destiny if I could hold my own with the average of young men in prosperous circumstances.&quot; But neither the educated Matthew Pocket, nor Jaggers, who has earned his status solely through his intellect, can aspire to gentility. Bentley Drummle, however, embodies the social ideal, so that Estella marries him without hesitation.

=== Moral regeneration ===
Another theme of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is that Pip can undergo &quot;moral regeneration&quot;.

In chapter 39, the novel&#x27;s turning point, Magwitch visits Pip to see the gentleman he has made, and once the convict has hidden in Herbert Pocket&#x27;s room, Pip realises his situation:

To cope with his situation and his learning that he now needs Magwitch, a hunted, injured man who traded his life for Pip&#x27;s. Pip can only rely on the power of love for Estella. Pip now goes through a number of different stages each of which, is accompanied by successive realisations about the vanity of the prior certainties.
Pip&#x27;s problem is more psychological and moral than social. Pip&#x27;s climbing of the social ladder upon gaining wealth is followed by a corresponding degradation of his integrity. Thus after his first visit in Miss Havisham, the innocent young boy from the marshes, suddenly turns into a liar to dazzle his sister, Mrs Joe, and his Uncle Pumblechook with the tales of a carriage and veal chops. More disturbing is his fascination with Satis House—where he is despised and even slapped, beset by ghostly visions, rejected by the Pockets—and the gradual growth of the mirage of London. The allure of wealth overpowers loyalty and gratitude, even conscience itself. This is evidenced by the urge to buy Joe&#x27;s return, in chapter 27, Pip&#x27;s haughty glance as Joe deciphers the alphabet, not to mention the condescending contempt he confesses to Biddy, copying Estella&#x27;s behaviour toward him.
Pip represents, as do those he mimics, the bankruptcy of the &quot;idea of the gentleman&quot;, and becomes the sole beneficiary of vulgarity, inversely proportional to his mounting gentility. In chapter 30, Dickens parodies the new disease that is corroding Pip&#x27;s moral values through the character &quot;Trabb&#x27;s boy&quot;, who is the only one not to be fooled. The boy parades through the main street of the village with boyish antics and contortions meant to satirically imitate Pip. The gross, comic caricature openly exposes the hypocrisy of this &quot;new&quot; gentleman in a frock coat and top hat. Trabb&#x27;s boy reveals that appearance has taken precedence over being, protocol on feelings, decorum on authenticity; labels reign to the point of absurdity, and human solidarity is no longer the order of the day.
Estella and Miss Havisham represent rich people who enjoy a materially easier life but cannot cope with a tougher reality. Miss Havisham, like a melodramatic heroine, withdrew from life at the first sign of hardship. Estella, excessively spoiled and pampered, sorely lacks judgement and falls prey to the first gentleman who approaches her, though he is the worst. Estella&#x27;s marriage to such a brute demonstrates the failure of her education. Estella is used to dominating but becomes a victim to her own vice, brought to her level by a man born, in her image.

Dickens uses imagery to reinforce his ideas and London, the paradise of the rich and of the &quot;ideal&quot; of the gentleman, has mounds of filth, it is crooked, decrepit, and greasy, a dark desert of bricks, soot, rain, and fog. The surviving vegetation is stunted, and confined to fenced-off paths, without air or light. Barnard&#x27;s Inn, where Pip lodges, offers mediocre food and service while the rooms, despite the furnishing provided, as Suhamy states, &quot;for the money&quot;, is most uncomfortable, a far cry from Joe&#x27;s large kitchen, radiating hearth, and his well-stocked pantry.

Likewise, such a world, dominated by the lure of money and social prejudice, also leads to the warping of people and morals, to family discord and war between man and woman. In contrast to London&#x27;s corruption stands Joe, despite his intellectual and social limitations, in whom the values of the heart prevail and who has natural wisdom.

===Pip&#x27;s conscience===

Another important theme is Pip&#x27;s sense of guilt, which he has felt from an early age. After the encounter with the convict Magwitch, Pip is afraid that someone will find out about his crime and arrest him. The theme of guilt comes into even greater effect when Pip discovers that his benefactor is a convict. Pip has an internal struggle with his conscience throughout &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, hence the long and painful process of redemption that he undergoes.

Pip&#x27;s moral regeneration is a true pilgrimage punctuated by suffering. Like Christian in Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, Pip makes his way up to light through a maze of horrors that afflict his body as well as his mind. This includes the burns he suffers from saving Miss Havisham from the fire; the illness that requires months of recovery; the threat of a violent death at Orlick&#x27;s hands; debt, and worse, the obligation of having to repay them; hard work, which he recognises as the only worthy source of income, hence his return to Joe&#x27;s forge. Even more important, is his accepting of Magwitch, a coarse outcast of society.

Dickens makes use of symbolism, in chapter 53, to emphasise Pip&#x27;s moral regeneration. As he prepares to go down the Thames to rescue the convict, a veil lifted from the river and Pip&#x27;s spirit. Symbolically the fog which enveloped the marshes as Pip left for London has finally lifted, and he feels ready to become a man.


Pip is redeemed by love, that, for Dickens as for generations of Christian moralists, is only acquired through sacrifice. Pip&#x27;s reluctance completely disappears and he embraces Magwitch. After this, Pip&#x27;s loyalty remains constant, during the imprisonment, trial, and death of the convict. He grows selfless and his &quot;expectations&quot; are confiscated by the Crown. Moments before Magwitch&#x27;s death, Pip reveals that Estella, Magwitch&#x27;s daughter, is alive, &quot;a lady and very beautiful. And I love her&quot;. Here the greatest sacrifice: the recognition that he owes everything, even Estella, to Magwitch; his new debt becomes his greatest freedom.

Pip returns to the forge, his previous state and to meaningful work. The philosophy expressed here by Dickens, that of a person happy with their contribution to the welfare of society, is in line with Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s theories and his condemnation, in &quot;Latter-Day Pamphlets&quot; (1850), of the system of social classes flourishing in idleness, much like that of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Dickens&#x27;s hero is neither an aristocrat nor a capitalist but a working-class boy.

In &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, the true values are childhood, youth and heart. The heroes of the story are the young Pip, a true visionary, and still developing person, open, sensible, who is persecuted by soulless adults. Then the adolescent Pip and Herbert, imperfect but free, intact, playful, endowed with fantasy in a boring and frivolous world. Magwitch is also a positive figure, a man of heart, victim of false appearances and of social images, formidable and humble, bestial but pure, a vagabond of God, despised by men. There is also Pip&#x27;s affectionate friend Joe, the enemy of the lie. Finally, there are women like Biddy.

===Imperialism===
Edward W. Said, in his 1993 work &quot;Culture and Imperialism&quot;, interprets &quot;Great Expectations&quot; in terms of postcolonial theory about late-eighteenth- and nineteenth-century British imperialism. Pip&#x27;s disillusionment when he learns his benefactor is an escaped convict from Australia, along with his acceptance of Magwitch as surrogate father, is described by Said as part of &quot;the imperial process&quot;, that is the way colonialism exploits the weaker members of a society. Thus the British trading post in Cairo legitimatises Pip&#x27;s work as a clerk, but the money earned by Magwitch&#x27;s honest labour is illegitimate, because Australia is a penal colony, and Magwitch is forbidden to return to Britain. Said states that Dickens has Magwitch return to be redeemed by Pip&#x27;s love, paving the way for Pip&#x27;s own redemption, but despite this moral message, the book still reinforces standards that support the authority of the British Empire. Said&#x27;s interpretation suggests that Dickens&#x27;s attitude backs Britain&#x27;s exploitation of Middle East &quot;through trade and travel&quot;, and that &quot;Great Expectations&quot; affirms the idea of keeping the Empire and its peoples in their place—at the exploitable margins of British society.

However, the novel&#x27;s Gothic and Romance genre elements, challenge Said&#x27;s assumption that &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a realist novel like Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;.

==Novels influenced by &quot;Great Expectations&quot;==
Dickens&#x27;s novel has influenced a number of writers. Sue Roe&#x27;s &quot;Estella: Her Expectations&quot; (1982), for example, explores the inner life of an Estella fascinated with a Havisham figure. Miss Havisham is again important in &quot;Havisham: A Novel&quot; (2013), a book by Ronald Frame, that features an imagining of the life of Miss Catherine Havisham from childhood to adulthood. The second chapter of Rosalind Ashe&#x27;s &quot;Literary Houses&quot; (1982) paraphrases Miss Havisham&#x27;s story, with details about the nature and structure of Satis House and coloured imaginings of the house within. Miss Havisham is also central to &quot;Lost in a Good Book&quot; (2002), Jasper Fforde&#x27;s alternative history fantasy novel, which features a parody of Miss Havisham. It won the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association 2004 Dilys Award.

Magwitch is the protagonist of Peter Carey&#x27;s &quot;Jack Maggs&quot; (1997), which is a re-imagining of Magwitch&#x27;s return to England, with the addition, among other things, of a fictionalised Dickens character and plot-line. Carey&#x27;s novel won the Commonwealth Writers Prize in 1998. &quot;Mister Pip&quot; (2006), a novel by New Zealand author Lloyd Jones, won the 2007 Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize. &quot;Mister Pip&quot; is set in a village on the Papua New Guinea island of Bougainville during a brutal civil war there in the 1990s, where the young protagonist&#x27;s life is impacted in a major way by her reading of &quot;Great Expectations&quot;.

In May 2015, Udon Entertainment&#x27;s Manga Classics line published a manga adaptation of &quot;Great Expectations&quot;.

==Adaptations==

Like many other Dickens novels, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; has been filmed for the cinema or television and adapted for the stage numerous times. The film adaptation in 1946 gained the greatest acclaim. The story is often staged, and less often produced as a musical. The 1939 stage play and the 1946 film that followed from that stage production did not include the character Orlick and ends the story when the characters are still young adults. That character has been excluded in many televised adaptations made since the 1946 movie by David Lean. Following are highlights of the adaptations for film and television, and for the stage, since the early 20th century.

<doc id="148597" wikidata="Q260260" url="?curid=148597" title="History of Bavaria">
<text>The history of [[Bavaria]] stretches from its earliest settlement and its formation as a stem duchy in the 6th century through its inclusion in the Holy Roman Empire to its status as an independent kingdom and finally as a large &quot;Bundesland&quot; (state) of the Federal Republic of Germany. Originally settled by Celtic peoples such as the Boii, by the 1st century BC it was eventually conquered and incorporated into the Roman Empire as the provinces of Raetia and Noricum.

==Early settlements and Roman Raetia==

There have been numerous palaeolithic discoveries in Bavaria.

The earliest inhabitants known from surviving written sources were the Celts, participating in the widespread La Tène culture. The Roman Empire under Augustus made the Danube, which runs through Bavaria, its northern boundary. What is now southern Bavaria was in the northern half of the Roman province of Raetia, which was the land of the Vindelici. The main Roman city was Augusta Vindelicorum, modern Augsburg. Modern-day Regensburg (&quot;Radasbona&quot;, or &quot;Castra Regina&quot;) and Passau were frontier positions. North of the Danube during imperial times lived two Suebian peoples, the Hermunduri and the Varisci.

==Migrations and early medieval period==
During the 5th century, the Romans in Noricum and Raetia, south of the Danube, came under increasing pressure from people north of the Danube. This area had become inhabited by Suebian groups from further north and was considered by Romans to be part of Germania. The etymological origins of the name &quot;Bavarian&quot; (Latin &quot;Baiovarii&quot;) are from the north of the Danube, outside the empire, coming from the Celtic Boii, who lived there earlier. Their name was already used to refer to the part of this region in the time of Maroboduus who formed the Germanic Marcomannic kingdom with its capital in this forested area. &quot;Boi&quot; became &quot;Bai&quot; according to typical Germanic linguistic changes happening at that time and a Germanic word similar to English &quot;home&quot; or modern German &quot;Heim&quot; was added. Strabo therefore reports Boihaemum (Greek Βουίαιμον). Tacitus similarly reports that &quot;Boihaemum&quot; is the name given to the area where the Boii had lived. These forms led to modern Bohemia which lies to the east of modern Bavaria and completely to the north of the Danube, in the modern Czech Republic. At some later stage, the ending &quot;varii&quot; was used in order to give a new name to specific people living in this geographical area who were then living on both sides of the Danube (similar Germanic ethnic names were created based on other regions: Angrivarii and Ampsivarii in northern Germany, Anglo-Saxon Cantware, Ripuarian Franks and so on). Claudius Ptolemy named both the &quot;Baenochaemae&quot;, living on the Upper Elbe river and a &quot;large people&quot; known as the &quot;&#x27;Baimoi&quot;, living near the Danube.

In surviving records, the Bavarian name was first mentioned historically in a Frankish list of peoples, prepared in c. 520 AD. The first document that also describes their location (east of the Swabians) is the &quot;History of the Goths&quot; by the historian Jordanes dating from 551 AD. A remark by Venantius Fortunatus follows in his description of his travels from Ravenna to Tours (565–571), in which he had crossed the lands of the Bavarians, referring to the dangers of travel in the region: &#x27;If the road is clear and if the Bavarian does not stop you [...] then travel across the Alps.&#x27;

Archaeological evidence dating from the 5th and 6th centuries points to social and cultural influences from several regions and peoples, such as Alamanni, Lombards, Thuringians, Goths, Bohemian Slavs and the local Romanised population.

Recent research by Wolfram and Pohl (1990) has moved away from searching for specific geographical origins of the Bavarians. It is now thought that the tribal ethnicity was established by the process of ethnogenesis, whereby an ethnic identity is formed because political and social pressures make a coherent identity necessary.

== The stem duchy of Bavaria ==
===Bavaria and the Agilolfings under Frankish overlordship===
The Bavarians soon came under the dominion of the Franks, probably without a serious struggle. The Franks regarded this border area as a buffer zone against peoples to the east, such as the Avars and the Slavs, and as a source of manpower for the army. Sometime around 550 AD they put it under the administration of a duke – possibly Frankish or possibly chosen from amongst the local leading families – who was supposed to act as a regional governor for the Frankish king. The first duke known was Garibald I, a member of the powerful Agilolfing family. This was the beginning of a series of Agilolfing dukes that was to last until 788 AD.

For a century and a half, a succession of dukes resisted the inroads of the Slavs on their eastern frontier and by the time of Duke Theodo I, who died in 717, had achieved complete independence from the feeble Frankish kings. When Charles Martel became the virtual ruler of the Frankish realm he brought the Bavarians into strict dependence and deposed two dukes successively for contumacy. His son and successor Pepin the Short likewise maintained Frankish authority. Several marriages took place between the family to which he belonged and the Agilolfings, who were united in a similar manner with the kings of the Lombards. The ease with which the Franks suppressed various risings gives colour to the supposition that family quarrels rather than the revolt of an oppressed people motivated the rebellions.

Bavarian law was committed to writing between the years 739 AD and 748 AD. Supplementary clauses, added afterward, bear evidence of Frankish influence. Thus, while the duchy belongs to the Agilolfing family, the duke must be chosen by the people and his election confirmed by the Frankish king, to whom he owes fealty. The duke has a fivefold weregild, summons the nobles and clergy for purposes of deliberation, calls out the host, administers justice, and regulates finance. Five noble families exist, possibly representing former divisions of the people. Subordinate to the nobles we find the freeborn and then the freedmen. The law divided the country into &quot;gaits&quot; or counties, under their counts, assisted by judges responsible for declaring the law.

===Christianity===
Christianity had lingered in Bavaria from Roman times, but a new era set in when Bishop Rupert of Worms came to the county at the invitation of Duke Theodo I in 696. He founded several monasteries, as did Bishop Emmeran of Poitiers, with the result that before long, most of the people professed Christianity and relations commenced between Bavaria and Rome. The 8th century witnessed indeed a heathen reaction, but the arrival of Saint Boniface in Bavaria during c. 734 AD checked apostasy. Boniface organised the Bavarian church and founded or restored bishoprics at Salzburg, Freising, Regensburg and Passau.

Tassilo III, who became duke of the Bavarians in 749, recognized the supremacy of the Frankish king, Pepin the Short in 757 AD, but soon afterward refused to furnish a contribution to the war in Aquitaine. Moreover, during the early years of the reign of Charlemagne, Tassilo gave decisions in ecclesiastical and civil causes in his own name, refused to appear in the assemblies of the Franks, and in general acted as an independent ruler. His control of the Alpine passes, and his position as an ally of the Avars and as a son-in-law of the Lombard king Desiderius, became so troublesome to the Frankish kingdom that Charlemagne determined to crush him.

The details of this contest remain obscure. Tassilo appears to have done homage in 781 AD and again in 787 AD, probably owing to the presence of Frankish armies. But further trouble soon arose, and in 788 AD, the Franks summoned the duke to Ingelheim and sentenced him to death on a charge of treachery. The King, however, pardoned Tassilo who entered a monastery and formally renounced his duchy at Frankfurt in 794.

Gerold, a brother-in-law of Charlemagne, ruled Bavaria till his death in a battle with the Avars in 799, when Frankish counts took over the administration and assimilated the land with the rest of the Carolingian empire. Measures taken by Charlemagne for the intellectual progress and material welfare of his realm improved conditions. The Bavarians offered no resistance to the change which thus abolished their duchy. Their incorporation with the Frankish dominions, due mainly to the unifying influence of the church, appeared already so complete that Charlemagne did not find it necessary to issue more than two capitularies dealing especially with Bavarian affairs.

===The Duchy during the Carolingian period===

The history of Bavaria for the ensuing century intertwines with that of the Carolingian empire. Bavaria, given during the partition of 817 AD to the king of the East Franks, Louis the German, formed a part of the larger territories confirmed to him in 843 AD by the Treaty of Verdun. Louis made Regensburg the center of his government and actively developed Bavaria, providing for its security by numerous campaigns against the Slavs. When he divided his possessions in 865 AD, it passed to his eldest son, Carloman, who had already managed its administration, and after his death in 880 AD, it became a part of the extensive territories of the emperor, Charles the Fat. This incompetent ruler left its defense to Arnulf, an illegitimate son of Carloman. Mainly due to the support of the Bavarians, Arnulf could take the field against Charles in 887 AD and secure his own election as a German king in the following year. In 899 AD, Bavaria passed to Louis the Child, during whose reign continuous Hungarian ravages occurred. Resistance to these inroads became gradually feebler, and tradition has it that on 5 July 907 almost the whole of the Bavarian tribe perished in the Battle of Pressburg against these formidable enemies.

During the reign of Louis the Child, Luitpold, Count of Scheyern, who possessed large Bavarian domains, ruled the Mark of Carinthia, created on the southeastern frontier for the defense of Bavaria. He died in the great battle of 907 AD, but his son Arnulf, surnamed the Bad, rallied the remnants of the tribe, in alliance with the Hungarians, became duke of the Bavarians in 911 AD, uniting Bavaria and Carinthia under his rule. The German king, Conrad I, attacked Arnulf when the latter refused to acknowledge his royal supremacy but failed in the end.

=== Duchy during the Ottonian and Salian periods ===
In 920 AD, Conrad&#x27;s successor was the German king, Henry the Fowler of the Ottonian dynasty. Henry recognized Arnulf as duke, confirming his right to appoint bishops, coin money, and issue laws.

A similar conflict took place between Arnulf&#x27;s son and successor Eberhard and Henry&#x27;s son Otto I the Great. Eberhard proved less successful than his father, and in 938 AD, fled from Bavaria, which Otto granted (with reduced privileges) to the late duke&#x27;s uncle, Bertold. Otto also appointed a count palatine in the person of Eberhard&#x27;s brother, Arnulf to watch the royal interests.

When Bertold died in 947 AD, Otto conferred the duchy upon his own brother Henry, who had married Judith, a daughter of Duke Arnulf. The Bavarians disliked Henry, who spent his short reign mainly in disputes with his people.

The ravages of the Hungarians ceased after their defeat on the Lechfeld (955 AD) and the area of the duchy was augmented for a time by the addition of certain adjacent districts in Italy.

In 955 AD, Henry&#x27;s young son Henry, surnamed the Quarrelsome, succeeded him, but in 974 AD he became involved in a conspiracy against King Otto II. The rising occurred because the king had granted the Duchy of Swabia to Henry&#x27;s enemy, Otto, a grandson of Emperor Otto the Great, and had given the new Bavarian Eastern March, subsequently known as Austria, to Leopold of Babenberg. The revolt soon failed but Henry, who on his escape from prison renewed his plots, formally lost his Duchy of Bavaria in 976 AD to Otto, Duke of Swabia. At the same time, Carinthia was made a separate duchy, the office of Count Palatine was reestablished, and the Bavarian church became dependent on the king instead of on the duke.

Bavaria at this stage included the Inn basin (including Salzburg and the Salzach basin) and the Danube from Donauwörth (Lech confluence) to Linz; the March of Verona (South Tyrol) briefly fell to Bavaria (952 AD) before passing to Carinthia (976 AD). The most important Bavarian cities at the time were Freising, Passau, Salzburg and Regensburg.

Restored in 985 AD, Henry proved himself a capable ruler, establishing internal order, issuing important laws, and taking measures to reform the monasteries. In 1002 AD, his son and successor Henry II gave Bavaria to his brother-in-law Henry of Luxembourg, after whose death in 1026 AD it passed successively to Henry, afterward Emperor Henry III, and then to another member of the family of Luxembourg, ruling as Duke Henry VII. In 1061 AD, Empress Agnes, mother and regent of the German king Henry IV, entrusted the duchy to Otto of Nordheim.

===Under the Welfs===
In 1070 AD, King Henry IV deposed duke Otto, granting the duchy to Count Welf, a member of an influential Bavarian family with roots in northern Italy.

In consequence of his support of Pope Gregory VII in his quarrel with Henry, Welf lost but subsequently regained Bavaria; two of his sons followed him in succession: Welf II from 1101 AD and Henry IX from 1120 AD. Both exercised considerable influence among the German princes.

Henry IX&#x27;s son Henry X, called the Proud, succeeded in 1126 AD and also obtained the Duchy of Saxony in 1137 AD. Alarmed at his power, King Conrad III refused to allow two duchies to remain in the same hands and declared Henry deposed. He bestowed Bavaria upon Leopold IV, Margrave of Austria. When Leopold died in 1141, the king retained the duchy himself; but it continued to be the scene of considerable disorder, and in 1143 AD he entrusted it to Henry, surnamed Jasomirgott, Margrave of Austria.

The struggle for its possession continued until 1156 AD, when Emperor Frederick I, in his desire to restore peace to Germany, persuaded Henry to give up Bavaria to Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony and son of Henry the Proud. In return, Austria was elevated from a margraviate to an independent duchy in the Privilegium Minus. It was Henry the Lion who founded Munich.

===Geographic fluctuations===
During the years following the dissolution of the Carolingian empire the borders of Bavaria changed continuously and for a lengthy period after 955 AD, it finally started expanding. To the west, the Lech still divided Bavaria from Swabia but on three other sides Bavaria took advantage of opportunities for expansion and the duchy occupied a considerable area north of the Danube. During the later years of the rule of the Welfs, however, a contrary tendency operated, and the extent of Bavaria shrank.

In 1027 AD, Conrad II split off the Bishopric of Trent from the former Lombard Kingdom of Italy. He attached it to the stem duchy of Bavaria, which was then under the rule of his son Henry III. From the 12th century onwards, the counts residing in Castle Tyrol near Merano extended their territory over much of the region and came to surpass the power of the bishops of Brixen, of whom they were nominally vassals. After the deposition of Henry X the Proud as Bavarian duke in 1138 AD, the Counts of Tyrol strengthened their independence from Bavaria under his son, Henry the Lion. When the House of Welf was again given to the Bavarian duchy by Frederick Barbarossa at the 1154 AD Reichstag of Goslar, the county of Tyrol was no longer counted as part of Bavaria.

Duke Henry the Lion focused on his northern duchy of Saxony rather than on his southern duchy of Bavaria, and when the dispute over the Bavarian succession ended in 1156 AD, the district between the Enns and the Inn became part of Austria.

The increasing importance of former Bavarian territories like the March of Styria (erected into a duchy in 1180 AD) and of the county of Tyrol had diminished both the actual and the relative strength of Bavaria, which now on almost all sides lacked opportunities for expansion. The neighboring Duchy of Carinthia, the large territories of the Archbishopric of Salzburg, as well as a general tendency to claim more independence on the part of the nobles: all these causes limited Bavarian expansion.

==Under the Wittelsbach dynasty==
A new era began when, in consequence of Henry the Lion being placed under an imperial ban in 1180 AD, Emperor Frederick I awarded the duchy to Otto, a member of the old Bavarian family of Wittelsbach and a descendant of the counts of Scheyern. The Wittelsbach dynasty ruled Bavaria without interruption until 1918 AD. The Electorate of the Palatinate was also acquired by the Wittelsbachs in 1214 AD.

When Otto of Wittelsbach gained Bavaria at Altenburg in September 1180, the duchy&#x27;s borders comprised the Böhmerwald, the Inn, the Alps and the Lech; and the duke exercised practical power only over his extensive private domains around Wittelsbach, Kelheim and Straubing.

Otto only enjoyed three years of rule over Bavaria. His son Louis I succeeded him in 1183 AD, playing a leading part in German affairs during the early years of the reign of the emperor Frederick II until Louis was assassinated at Kelheim in September 1231. His son Otto II, called the Illustrious, remained loyal to the Hohenstaufen emperors despite the Church placing Bavaria under an interdict and himself under a papal ban. Like his father, Otto II increased the area of his lands by purchases and considerably strengthened his hold upon the duchy. He died in November 1253.

===Partitions===

The efforts of the dukes to increase their power and to give unity to the duchy had met with a fair measure of success; but they were soon vitiated by partitions among different members of the family, which for 250 years made the history of Bavaria little more than a repetitive chronicle of territorial divisions bringing war and weakness in their wake.

The first of these divisions occurred in 1255. Louis II and Henry XIII, the sons of Duke Otto II, who for two years after their father&#x27;s death had ruled Bavaria jointly, split their inheritance: Louis II obtained the western part of the duchy, afterward called Upper Bavaria, as well as the Electorate of the Palatinate, while Henry secured eastern or Lower Bavaria.

===Lower Bavaria===
Henry XIII of Lower Bavaria spent most of his time in quarrels with his brother, with Ottakar II of Bohemia and with various ecclesiastics. When he died in February 1290, the land fell to his three sons, Otto III, Louis III, and Stephen I. The families of these three princes governed Lower Bavaria until 1333, when Henry XV (son of Otto III) died, followed in 1334 by his cousin Otto IV; and as both died without sons the whole of Lower Bavaria then passed to Henry XIV. Dying in 1339, Henry left an only son, John I, who died childless in the following year, when the Wittelsbach emperor Louis IV, by securing Lower Bavaria for himself, united the whole of the duchy under his sway.

===Upper Bavaria===
In the course of a long reign, Louis II, called &quot;the Stern&quot;, became the most powerful prince in southern Germany. He served as the guardian of his nephew Conradin of Hohenstaufen, and after Conradin&#x27;s execution in Italy in 1268, Louis and his brother Henry inherited the domains of the Hohenstaufens in Swabia and elsewhere. He supported Count Rudolph I of Habsburg, in his efforts to secure the German throne in 1273, married the new king&#x27;s daughter Mechtild, and aided him in campaigns in Bohemia.

For some years after Louis&#x27; death in 1294, his sons Rudolph I and Louis, afterward the emperor Louis IV, ruled their duchy in common; but as their relations were never harmonious, a division of Upper Bavaria occurred in 1310, by which Rudolph received the land east of the Isar together with the town of Munich, and Louis the district between the Isar and the Lech. It was not long, however, before this arrangement led to war between the brothers, with the result that in 1317, three years after he had become German king, Louis compelled Rudolph to abdicate, and for twelve years ruled alone over the whole of Upper Bavaria. But in 1329 a series of events induced him to conclude the Treaty of Pavia with Rudolph&#x27;s sons, Rudolph and Rupert, to whom he transferred the Electorate of the Palatinate (which the Wittelsbach family had owned since 1214) and also a portion of Bavaria north of the Danube, afterward called the Upper Palatinate (&quot;Oberpfalz&quot;).

At the same time, the two lines of the Wittelsbach family decided to exercise the electoral vote alternately, and that in the event of the extinction of either branch of the family, the surviving branch should inherit its possessions.

The consolidation of Bavaria under Louis IV lasted for seven years, during which the emperor was able to improve the condition of the country. When he died in 1347 he left six sons to share his possessions, who agreed upon a division of Bavaria in 1349. Its history, however, was complicated by its connections with Brandenburg, Holland, Hainaut and Tirol, all of which the emperor had also left to his sons. All the six brothers exercised some authority in Bavaria; but three alone left issue, and of these, the eldest, Louis V, Duke of Bavariaalso margrave of Brandenburg and count of Tyroldied in 1361 and was followed to the grave two years later by his only son, the childless Meinhard. Tyrol then passed to the Habsburgs. Brandenburg was lost in 1373.

The two remaining brothers, Stephen II and Albert I, ruled over Bavaria-Landshut and Bavaria-Straubing respectively and when Stephen died in 1375 his three sons governed his portion of Bavaria jointly. In 1392, on the extinction of all the lines except those of Stephen and Albert, an important partition took place, which subdivided the greater part of the duchy amongst Stephen&#x27;s three sons, Stephen III, Frederick and John II, who founded respectively the lines of Ingolstadt, Landshut and Munich.

The main result of the threefold division of 1392 proved to be a succession of civil wars which led to the temporary eclipse of Bavaria as a force in German politics. Neighboring states encroached upon its borders, and the nobles ignored the authority of the dukes, who, deprived of the electoral vote, were mainly occupied for fifty years with internal strife.

This condition of affairs, however, had some benefits. The government of the country and the control of the finances passed mainly into the hands of an assembly called the &quot;Landtag&quot; or &quot;Landschaft&quot;, organized in 1392. The towns, assuming certain independence, became strong and wealthy as trade increased, and the citizens of Munich and Regensburg often proved formidable antagonists to the dukes. Thus, a period of disorder saw the growth of representative institutions and the establishment of a strong civic spirit.

===Bavaria-Straubing===
Albert I&#x27;s duchy of Bavaria-Straubing passed with Holland and Hainaut on his death in 1404 to his son William II, and in 1417 to his younger son John III, who resigned the Bishopric of Liège to take up his new position. When John died in 1425 this family became extinct, and after a contest between various claimants, the three remaining branches of the Wittelsbach family Ingolstadt, Landshut and Munich partitioned Bavaria-Straubing between themselves. However, Holland and Hainaut passed to Burgundy.

===Bavaria-Ingolstadt===
Stephen III, duke of Bavaria-Ingolstadt, was renowned as a soldier rather than as a statesman. His rule saw struggles with various towns and with his brother, John of Bavaria-Munich. On his death in 1413 his son Louis VII, called the Bearded, succeeded. Before his accession, this restless and quarrelsome prince had played an important part in the affairs of France, where his sister Isabella had married King Charles VI. About 1417 he became involved in a violent quarrel with his cousin, Henry XVI of Bavaria-Landshut, fell under both the papal and the imperial ban, and in 1439 came under attack from his son, Louis VIII the Lame. This prince, who had married a daughter of Frederick I of Hohenzollern, margrave of Brandenburg, resented the favor shown by his father to an illegitimate son. Aided by Albert Achilles, afterward margrave of Brandenburg, he took the elder Louis prisoner and compelled him to abdicate in 1443. When Louis the Lame died in 1445 his father came into the power of his implacable enemy, Henry of Bavaria-Landshut, and died in prison in 1447.

===Bavaria-Landshut===
The duchy of Bavaria-Ingolstadt passed to Henry, who had succeeded his father Frederick as duke of Bavaria-Landshut in 1393, and whose long reign comprised almost entirely family feuds. He died in July 1450, and his son, Louis IX (called the Rich) succeeded. About this time Bavaria began to recover some of its former importance.

Louis IX expelled the Jews from his duchy, increased the security of traders, and improved both the administration of justice and the condition of the finances. In 1472 he founded the University of Ingolstadt, attempted to reform the monasteries, and successfully defeated Albert Achilles of Brandenburg. On the death of Louis IX in January 1479 his son George, also called the Rich, succeeded; and when George, a faithful adherent of the German king Maximilian I, died without sons in December 1503, a war broke out for the possession of his duchy.

===Bavaria-Munich===

Bavaria-Munich passed on after the death of John II in 1397 to his sons Ernest and William III, but they only obtained possession of their lands after a struggle with Stephen of Bavaria-Ingolstadt. Both brothers then engaged in warfare with the other branches of the family and with the citizens of Munich. William III, a loyal servant of the emperor Sigismund, died in 1435, leaving an only son, Adolf, who died five years later; and Ernest, distinguished for his strength, died in 1438. In 1440 the whole of Bavaria-Munich came to Ernest&#x27;s son Albert III, who had become estranged from his father owing to his union with the commoner Agnes Bernauer. Albert, whose attempts to reform the monasteries earned him the surname of Pious, almost became the elected king of Bohemia in 1440. He died in 1460, leaving five sons, the two elder of whom, John IV and Sigismund, reigned together until John&#x27;s death in 1463. The third brother, Albert, who had been educated for the church, joined his brother in 1465, and when Sigismund abdicated two years later became sole ruler, in spite of the claims of his two younger brothers.

Albert IV, called the Wise, added the district of Abensberg to his possessions, and in 1504 became involved in the Landshut War of Succession which broke out for the possession of Bavaria-Landshut on the death of George the Rich. Albert&#x27;s rival was George&#x27;s son-in-law Rupert, formerly bishop of Freising and also the successor of Philip as count palatine of the Rhine. The emperor Maximilian I, interested as archduke of Austria and count of Tirol, interfered in the dispute. Rupert died in 1504, and the following year an arrangement was made at the Diet of Cologne by which the emperor and Philip&#x27;s grandson, Otto Henry, obtained certain outlying districts, while Albert by securing the bulk of George&#x27;s possessions united Bavaria under his rule. In 1506 Albert decreed that the duchy should thenceforth pass according to the rules of primogeniture, and in other ways endeavored to consolidate Bavaria. He was partially successful in improving the condition of the country, and in 1500 Bavaria formed one of the six circles into which Germany was divided for the maintenance of peace. Albert died in March 1508 and was succeeded by his son, William IV, whose mother Kunigunde was the daughter of the emperor Frederick III.

==Reunited duchy==

===Renaissance and Counter-Reformation===
In spite of the decree of 1506, William IV was compelled to grant a share in the government in 1516 to his brother Louis X, an arrangement which lasted until the death of Louis in 1545.

William followed the traditional Wittelsbach policy of opposition to the Habsburgs until in 1534 he made a treaty at Linz with Ferdinand, the king of Hungary and Bohemia. This link strengthened in 1546, when the emperor Charles V obtained the help of the duke during the war of the league of Schmalkalden by promising him in certain eventualities the succession to the Bohemian throne, and the electoral dignity enjoyed by the count palatine of the Rhine. William also did much at a critical period to secure Bavaria for Catholicism. The reformed doctrines had made considerable progress in the duchy when the duke obtained extensive rights over the bishoprics and monasteries from the pope. He then took measures to repress the reformers, many of whom were banished; while the Jesuits, whom he invited into the duchy in 1541, made the Jesuit College of Ingolstadt, their headquarters in Germany. William, whose death occurred in March 1550 and was succeeded by his son Albert V, who had married a daughter of Ferdinand of Habsburg, afterward the emperor Ferdinand I. Early in his reign Albert made some concessions to the reformers, who were still strong in Bavaria; but about 1563 he changed his attitude, favored the decrees of the Council of Trent, and pressed forward the work of the Counter-Reformation. As education passed by degrees into the hands of the Jesuits, the progress of Protestantism was effectually arrested in Bavaria.

Albert V patronized art extensively. Artists of all kinds flocked to his court in Munich, and splendid buildings arose in the city, while Italy and elsewhere contributed to the collection of artistic works. The expenses of a magnificent court led the duke to quarrel with the &quot;Landschaft&quot; (the nobles), to oppress his subjects, and to leave a great burden of debt when he died in October 1579.

The succeeding duke, Albert&#x27;s son, William V (called the Pious), had received a Jesuit education and showed keen attachment to Jesuit tenets. He secured the Archbishopric of Cologne for his brother Ernest in 1583, and this dignity remained in the possession of the family for nearly 200 years. In 1597 he abdicated in favor of his son Maximilian I, and retired to a monastery, where he died in 1626.

===Thirty Years&#x27; War===
Maximilian I found the duchy encumbered with debt and filled with disorder, but ten years of his vigorous rule effected a remarkable change. The finances and the judicial system were reorganized, a class of civil servants and a national militia founded, and several small districts were brought under the duke&#x27;s authority. The result was unity and order in the duchy which enabled Maximilian to play an important part in the Thirty Years&#x27; War; during the earlier years of which he was so successful as to acquire the Upper Palatinate and the electoral dignity which had been enjoyed since 1356 by the elder branch of the Wittelsbach family. In spite of subsequent reverses, Maximilian retained these gains at the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. During the later years of this war Bavaria, especially the northern part, suffered severely. In 1632 the Swedes invaded, and when Maximilian violated the treaty of Ulm in 1647, the French and the Swedes ravaged the land. After repairing this damage to some extent, the elector died at Ingolstadt in September 1651, leaving his duchy much stronger than he had found it. The recovery of the Upper Palatinate made Bavaria compact; the acquisition of the electoral vote made it influential, and the duchy was able to play a part in European politics which internal strife had rendered impossible for the past four hundred years.

==Electorate of Bavaria==
===Absolutism===
The international position won by Maximilian I adds to the ducal house, on Bavaria itself its effect during the next two centuries were most dubious. Maximilian&#x27;s son, Ferdinand Maria (1651–1679), who was a minor when he succeeded, tried to repair the wounds caused by the Thirty Years&#x27; War, encouraging agriculture and industries and building or restoring numerous churches and monasteries. In 1669, moreover, he again called a meeting of the diet, which had been suspended since 1612.

His good work, however, was largely undone by his son Maximilian II Emanuel (1679–1726), whose far-reaching ambition set him warring against the Ottoman Empire and, on the side of France, in the great struggle of the Spanish succession. He shared in the defeat at the Battle of Blenheim, near Höchstädt, on 13 August 1704; his dominions were temporarily partitioned between Austria and the elector palatine by the Treaty of Ilbersheim, and only restored to him, harried and exhausted, at the Treaty of Baden in 1714; the first Bavarian peasant insurrection, known as the &quot;Bloody Christmas of Sendling&quot;, having been crushed by the Austrian occupiers in 1706.

Untaught by Maximilian II Emmanuel&#x27;s experience, his son, Charles Albert (1726–1745), devoted all his energies to increasing the European prestige and power of his house. The death of the emperor Charles VI proved his opportunity: he disputed the validity of the Pragmatic Sanction which secured the Habsburg succession to Maria Theresa, allied himself with France, conquered Upper Austria, was crowned king of Bohemia at Prague and, in 1742, emperor at Frankfurt. The price he had to pay, however, was the occupation of Bavaria itself by Austrian troops; and, though the invasion of Bohemia in 1744 by Frederick II of Prussia enabled him to return to Munich, at his death on 20 January 1745 it was left to his successor to make what terms he could for the recovery of his dominions.

Maximilian III Joseph (1745–1777), called &quot;Max the much-beloved&quot;, by the peace of Füssen, signed on 22 April 1745, obtained the restitution of his dominions in return for a formal acknowledgment of the Pragmatic Sanction. He was a man of enlightenment, did much to encourage agriculture, industries and the exploitation of the mineral wealth of the country, founded the Academy of Sciences at Munich, and abolished the Jesuit censorship of the press. At the same time, the elector signed more death sentences than any of his predecessors ever had. On 30 December 1777, when he died, the Bavarian line of the Wittelsbachs became extinct, and the succession passed to Charles Theodore, the elector palatine. After a separation of four and a half centuries, the Electorate of the Palatinate, to which the duchies of Jülich and Berg had been added, was thus reunited with Bavaria.

===Palatinate-Bavaria===

===Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods===
In 1792, French revolutionary armies overran the Palatinate; in 1795 the French, under Moreau, invaded Bavaria itself and advanced to Munich where they were received with joy by the long-suppressed Liberals, and laid siege to Ingolstadt. Charles Theodore, who had done nothing to prevent wars or to resist the invasion, fled to Saxony and abandoned a regency whose members signed a convention with Moreau, by which he granted an armistice in return for a heavy contribution (7 September 1796).

Between the French and the Austrians, Bavaria was now in a bad situation. Even before the death of Charles Theodore on 16 February 1799, the Austrians had again occupied the country, in preparation for renewing the war with France. The new elector, Maximilian IV Joseph (of Zweibrücken), succeeded to a difficult inheritance. Though both he and his all-powerful minister, Maximilian von Montgelas sympathized more with France than Austria, the state of the Bavarian finances, and the fact that the Bavarian troops were scattered and disorganized, placed him helpless in the hands of Austria. On 2 December 1800, the Bavarian armies were involved in the Austrian defeat at Hohenlinden, and Moreau once more occupied Munich. By the Treaty of Lunéville (9 February 1801) Bavaria lost the Palatinate and the duchies of Zweibrücken and Jülich.

In view of the scarcely disguised ambitions and intrigues of the Austrian court, Montgelas now believed that the interests of Bavaria lay in a frank alliance with the French Republic; he succeeded in overcoming the reluctance of Maximilian Joseph and on 24 August a separate treaty of peace and alliance with France was signed in Paris. By the third article of this the First Consul undertook to see that the compensation promised under the 7th article of the treaty of Lunéville for the territory ceded on the left bank of the Rhine, should be carried out at the expense of the Empire in the manner most agreeable to Bavaria (see de Martens, &quot;Recueil&quot;, vol. vii. p. 365).

Thus in 1803, in accordance to this agreement, in the territorial rearrangements consequent on Napoleon&#x27;s suppression of the ecclesiastical states and of many free cities of the Empire, Bavaria received the bishoprics of Würzburg, Bamberg, Augsburg and Freisingen, part of that of Passau, the territories of twelve abbeys, and seventeen cities and villages. The whole form a compact territory which more than compensated for the loss of her outlying provinces on the Rhine. Montgelas now aspired to raise Bavaria to the rank of a first-rate power and he pursued this object during the Napoleonic epoch with consummate skill, allowing fully for the preponderance of France – so long as it lasted – but never permitting Bavaria to sink, like so many of the states of the Confederation of the Rhine, into mere French dependency. In the war of 1805, in accordance with a treaty of alliance signed at Würzburg on 23 September, Bavarian troops, for the first time since the days of Charles VII, fought side by side with the French, and by the Treaty of Pressburg, signed on 26 December, the Principality of Eichstädt, the Margraviate of Burgau, the Lordship of Vorarlberg, the counties of Hohenems and Königsegg-Rothenfels, the lordships of Argen and Tettnang, and the city of Lindau with its territory was to be added to Bavaria. On the other hand, Würzburg, obtained in 1803, was to be ceded by Bavaria to the elector of Salzburg in exchange for Tirol. By the 1st article of the treaty, the emperor acknowledged the assumption by the elector of the title of king, as Maximilian I. The price which Maximilian had reluctantly to pay for this accession of dignity was the marriage of his daughter Augusta with Eugène de Beauharnais. On 15 March 1806 he ceded the Duchy of Berg to Napoleon.

For the internal constitution of Bavaria also the French alliance had noteworthy consequences. Maximilian himself was an &quot;enlightened&quot; prince of the 18th-century type, whose tolerant principles had already grievously offended his clerical subjects. Montgelas was a firm believer in drastic reform &quot;from above&quot;, and, in 1803, had discussed with the rump of the old estates the question of reforms. But the revolutionary changes introduced by the constitution proclaimed on 1 May 1808 were due to the direct influence of Napoleon. A clean sweep was made of the medieval polity surviving in the somnolent local diets and corporations. In place of the old system of privileges and exemptions were set equality before the law, universal liability to taxation, the abolition of serfdom, the security of person and property, liberty of conscience and of the press. A representative assembly was created on paper, based on a narrow franchise and with very limited powers, but was never summoned.

In 1809 Bavaria was again engaged in war with Austria on the side of France. The Tyroleans rose up against the Bavarian authority and succeeded three times in defeating Bavarian and French troops trying to retake the country. Austria lost the war of the Fifth Coalition against France, and got even harsher terms in the Treaty of Schönbrunn in 1809. Often glorified as Tirol&#x27;s national hero, Andreas Hofer, the leader of the uprising, was executed in 1810 in Mantua, having lost a third and final battle against the French and Bavarian forces. By the treaty signed at Paris on 28 February 1810, Bavaria ceded southern Tirol to Italy and some small districts to Württemberg, receiving as compensation parts of Salzburg, the Innviertel and Hausruck and the principalities of Bayreuth and Regensburg. So far the policy of Montgelas had been brilliantly successful, but the star of Napoleon had now reached its zenith and already the astute opportunist had noted the signs of the coming change.

The events of 1812 followed; in 1813 Bavaria was summoned to join the alliance against Napoleon, the demand being passionately backed by the crown prince Louis and by Marshal Wrede; on 8 October the treaty of Ried was signed, by which Bavaria threw in her lot with the Allies. Montgelas announced to the French ambassador that he had been compelled temporarily to bow before the storm, adding &quot;Bavaria has need of France&quot;. (For Bavaria&#x27;s share in the war see Napoleonic Campaigns.)

==Kingdom of Bavaria==
===Constitution and Revolution===
Immediately after the first peace of Paris (1814), Bavaria ceded to Austria the northern Tyrol and Vorarlberg; during the Congress of Vienna it was decided that she was to add to these the greater part of Salzburg and the Innviertel and . She received as compensation, besides Würzburg and Aschaffenburg, the Palatinate (region) on the left bank of the Rhine and certain districts of Hesse-Darmstadt and of the former Abbacy of Fulda. But with the collapse of France, the old fears and jealousies against Austria were revived in full force, and Bavaria only agreed to these cessions (treaty of Munich, 16 April 1816) under the promise that, in the event of the powers ignoring her claim to the Baden succession in favor of that of the line of the counts of Hochberg, she should receive also the Palatinate on the right bank of the Rhine. The question was thus left open, the tension between the two powers remained high, and the war was only averted by the authority of the Grand Alliance . At the Congress of Aix (1818) the question of the Baden succession was settled in favor of the Hochberg line, without the compensation stipulated in the treaty of Munich; and by the treaty of Frankfurt, signed on behalf of the four great powers on 20 July 1819, the territorial issues between Bavaria and Austria were settled, in spite of the protests of the former, in the general sense of the arrangement made at Vienna. A small strip of territory was added, to connect Bavaria with the Palatinate, and Bavarian troops were to garrison the federal fortress of Mainz.

Meanwhile, on 1 February 1817, Montgelas had been dismissed; and Bavaria had entered on a new era of constitutional reform. This implied no breach with the European policy of the fallen minister. In the new German confederation, Bavaria had assumed the role of defender of the smaller states against the ambitions of Austria and Prussia. Montgelas had dreamed of a Bavarian hegemony in South Germany similar to that of Prussia in the north. It was to obtain popular support for this policy and for the Bavarian claims on Baden that the crown prince pressed for a liberal constitution, the reluctance of Montgelas to concede it is the cause of his dismissal.

On 26 May 1818, the constitution was proclaimed. The parliament was to consist of two houses; the first comprising the great hereditary landowners, government officials, and nominees of the crown; the second, elected on a very narrow franchise, comprising representatives of the small land-owners, the towns, and the peasants. By additional articles the equality of religions was guaranteed and the rights of Protestants safeguarded, concessions which were denounced at Rome as a breach of the Concordat, which had been signed immediately before. The result of the constitutional experiment hardly justified the royal expectations; the parliament was hardly opened (5 February 1819) before the doctrinaire radicalism of some of its members, culminating in the demand that the army should swear allegiance to the constitution, so alarmed the king that he appealed to Austria and Germany, undertaking to carry out any repressive measures they might recommend. Prussia, however, refused to approve of any coup d&#x27;état; the parliament, chastened by the consciousness that its life depended on the goodwill of the king, moderated its tone; and Maximilian ruled till his death as a model constitutional monarch. On 13 October 1825, his son Ludwig I succeeded him.

Ludwig proved an enlightened patron of the arts and sciences, who transferred the University of Landshut to Munich, which, by his magnificent taste in building, he transformed into one of the most beautiful cities of the continent. The earlier years of his reign were marked by a liberal spirit and the reform, especially, of the financial administration; but the revolutions of 1830 frightened him into reaction, which was accentuated by the opposition of the parliament to his expenditure on building and works of art. In 1837, the Ultramontanes came into power with Karl von Abel (1788–1859) as prime minister. The Jesuits now gained the upper hand; one by one the liberal provisions of the constitution were modified or annulled; the Protestants were harried and oppressed, and rigorous censorship forbade any free discussion of internal politics. The collapse of this régime was due, not to popular agitation, but to the resentment of Ludwig at the clerical opposition to the influence of his mistress, Lola Montez. On 17 February 1847, Abel was dismissed for publishing his memorandum against the proposal to naturalize Lola, who was an Irishwoman; and the Protestant Georg Ludwig von Maurer took his place. The new ministry granted the certificate of naturalization; but riots, in which Ultramontane professors of the university took part, resulted. The professors were deprived, the parliament dissolved, and, on 27 November, the ministry dismissed. Lola Montez created Countess Landsfeld, became supreme in the state; and the new minister, Prince Ludwig of Öttingen-Wallerstein (1791–1870), in spite of his efforts to enlist Liberal sympathy by appeals to pan-German patriotism, was powerless to form a stable government. His cabinet was known as the &quot;Lolaministerium&quot;; in February 1848, stimulated by the news from Paris (Revolution of 1848 in France), riots broke out against the countess; on 11 March the king dismissed Öttingen, and on 20 March, realizing the force of public opinion against him, abdicated in favor of his son, Maximilian II.

Before his abdication Ludwig had issued, on 6 March 1848, a proclamation promising the zealous co-operation of the Bavarian government in the work of German freedom and unity (see German revolutions of 1848–1849). To the spirit of this Maximilian was faithful, accepting the authority of the central government at Frankfurt and on 19 December the sanctioning of the official promulgation of the laws were passed by the German parliament. But Prussia was henceforth the enemy, not Austria. In refusing to agree to the offer of the imperial crown to Frederick William IV, Maximilian had the support of his parliament. In withholding his assent to the new German constitution, by which Austria was excluded from the Confederation, he ran indeed counter to the sentiment of his people; but by this time the back of the revolution was broken, and in the events which led to the humiliation of Prussia at Olmütz in 1851, and the restoration of the old diet of the Confederation, Bavaria was safe in casting in her lot with Austria (see History of Germany).

The guiding spirit in this anti-Prussian policy, which characterized Bavarian statesmanship up to the war of 1866, was Baron Karl Ludwig von der Pfordten (1811–1880), who became minister for foreign affairs on 19 April 1849. His idea for the ultimate solution of the question of the balance of power in Germany was the so-called &quot;Trias&quot;, i.e. a league of the Rhenish states as a counterpoise to the preponderance of Austria and Prussia. In internal affairs, his ministry was characterized by a reactionary policy less severe than elsewhere in Germany, which led none-the-less from 1854 onward to a struggle with the parliament, which ended in the dismissal of Pfordten&#x27;s ministry on 27 March 1859. He was succeeded by Karl Freiherr von Schrenk von Notzing (1806–1884), an official of Liberal tendencies who had been a Bavarian representative in the diet of the Confederation. Important reforms were now introduced, including the separation of the judicial and executive powers and the drawing up of a new criminal code. In foreign affairs Schrenk, like his predecessor, aimed at safeguarding the independence of Bavaria, and supported the idea of superseding the actual constitution of the Confederation by a supreme directory, in which Bavaria, as leader of the purely German states, would hold the balance between Prussia and Austria. Bavaria accordingly opposed the Prussian proposals for the reorganization of the Confederation, and one of the last acts of King Maximilian was to take a conspicuous part in the assembly of princes summoned to Frankfurt in 1863 by the emperor Francis Joseph.

Maximilian was succeeded on 10 March 1864 by his son Ludwig II, a youth of eighteen. The government was at first carried on by Schrenk and Pfordten in concert. Schrenk soon retired, when the Bavarian government found it necessary, in order to maintain its position in the Prussian Zollverein, to become a party to the Prussian commercial treaty with France, signed in 1862. In the complicated Schleswig-Holstein question Bavaria, under Pfordten&#x27;s guidance, consistently opposed Prussia, and headed the lesser states in their support of Frederick of Augustenburg against the policy of the two great German powers. Finally, in the war of 1866, in spite of Bismarck&#x27;s efforts to secure her neutrality, Bavaria sided actively with Austria.

===German Empire===
The rapid victory of the Prussians and the wise moderation of Bismarck paved the way for a complete revolution in Bavaria&#x27;s relation to Prussia and the German question. The South German Confederation, contemplated by the 6th article of the Treaty of Prague, never came into being; and, though Prussia, in order not to excite the alarm of France, opposed the suggestion that the southern states should join the North German Confederation, the bonds of Bavaria (as of the other southern states) with the north were strengthened by an offensive and defensive alliance with Prussia, as the result of Napoleon&#x27;s demand for &quot;compensation&quot; in the Palatinate. This was signed at Berlin on 22 August 1866, on the same day as the signature of the formal treaty of peace between the two countries. The separatist ambitions of Bavaria were thus formally given up; she had no longer &quot;need of France&quot;; and during the Franco-Prussian War, the Bavarian army marched, under the command of the Prussian crown prince, against Germany&#x27;s common enemy. It was on the proposal of King Ludwig II that the imperial crown was offered to King Wilhelm I of Prussia.

This was preceded, on 23 November 1870, by the signature of a treaty between Bavaria and the North German Confederation. By this instrument, though Bavaria became an integral part of the new German empire, she reserved a larger measure of sovereign independence than any of the other constituent states. Thus she retained a separate diplomatic service, military administration, and postal, telegraph, and railway systems. The treaty was ratified by the Bavarian chambers on 21 January 1871, though not without considerable opposition on the part of the so-called Patriot Party. Their hostility was increased by the Kulturkampf, due to the promulgation in 1870 of the dogma of papal infallibility. Munich University, where Ignaz von Döllinger was professor, became the center of the opposition to the new dogma, and the Old Catholics were protected by the king and the government. The federal law expelling the Jesuits was proclaimed in Bavaria on 6 September 1871 and was extended to the Redemptorists in 1873. On 31 March 1871, moreover, the bonds with the rest of the empire had been drawn closer by the acceptance of a number of laws of the North German Confederation, of which the most important was the new criminal code, which was finally put into force in Bavaria in 1879. The opposition of the Patriot Party, however, reinforced by the strong Catholic sentiment of the country, continued and it was only the steady support given by the king to successive Liberal ministries that prevented its finding disastrous expression in the parliament, where it remained in a majority till 1887, and subsequently, as the Centre Party, continued to form the most compact party.

Ludwig II, whose passion for building palaces and near-total neglect of his governmental duties were becoming a serious crisis, was declared insane and on 10 June 1886, his uncle, Prince Luitpold, became the regent. Three days later on 13 June, Ludwig II was found dead in Lake Starnberg. The question of whether his death was self-imposed, accidental or the result of malicious conspirators remains unanswered. However, it was reported at the time and today is widely accepted that it was a suicide. Due to the insanity of Ludwig&#x27;s brother, King Otto I, Prince Luitpold continued as regent.

After 1871, Bavaria shared to the full in the rapid development of Germany; but her particularism, founded on traditional racial and religious antagonism to the Prussians, was by no means dead, though it exhibited itself in no more dangerous form than the prohibition, reissued in 1900, to display any but the Bavarian flag on public buildings on the emperor&#x27;s birthday; a provision which was subsequently modified so as to allow the Bavarian and imperial flags to be hung side by side.

Following Prince Luitpold&#x27;s death in 1912, his son, Prince Ludwig, became the regent. A year later, Ludwig deposed his cousin, Otto, and proclaimed himself King Ludwig III of Bavaria. During the First World War, Ludwig&#x27;s eldest son, Crown Prince Rupprecht, commanded the Bavarian army and became one of the leading German commanders on the Western Front.

==Modern times==
===Bavaria during the Weimar Republic===
Republican institutions replaced royal ones in Bavaria during the upheavals of November 1918. Provisional National Council Minister-President Kurt Eisner declared Bavaria to be a free state on 8 November 1918. Eisner was assassinated on 21 February 1919 ultimately leading to a Communist revolt and the short lived Bavarian Socialist Republic (&quot;Bayerische Räterepublik&quot; or &quot;Münchner Räterepublik&quot;) being proclaimed from 6 April 1919. After violent suppression by elements of the German Army and notably the Freikorps, the Bavarian Socialist Republic fell on 3 May 1919. The Bamberg Constitution (&quot;&quot;) was enacted on 14 August 1919 creating the Free State of Bavaria within the Weimar Republic.

Munich became a hotbed of extremism: the 1919 Bavarian Soviet Republic and the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch involving Erich Ludendorff and Adolf Hitler took place in the same city. For most of the Weimar Republic, though, Bavaria was dominated by the relatively mainstream conservative Bavarian People&#x27;s Party. The BPP was a Catholic party that represented the Bavarian tradition of particularist conservatism, through which monarchists and even separatist sentiments were conveyed. An attempt supported by a wide coalition of parties, to establish Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria, as a &quot;Staatskommisar&quot; with dictatorial powers in 1932 to counter the Nazis failed due to the hesitant Bavarian government under Heinrich Held.

===Bavaria during the Nazi era===
With the rise of the Nazis to power in 1933, the Bavarian parliament was dissolved without new elections. Instead, the seats were allocated according to the results in the national election of March 1933, giving the Nazis and its coalition partner, the DNVP, a narrow two-seat majority due to the fact that the seats won by the KPD were declared void. With this controlling power, the NSDAP was declared the only legal party and all other parties in Germany and Bavaria were dissolved. In 1934, the Bavarian parliament was, like all other state parliaments, dissolved too. Shortly after, Bavaria itself was broken up during the reorganization of the &quot;Reich&quot;. Instead of the states, &quot;Reichsgaue&quot; were established as administrative sub-divisions. Bavaria was split into six regions, the &quot;Reichsgaue&quot; &quot;Schwaben&quot;, &quot;München-Oberbayern&quot;, &quot;Bayerische Ostmark&quot;, &quot;Franken&quot;, &quot;Main-Franken&quot; and&quot; Westmark&quot;.
During the 12 years of Nazi rule, Bavaria was one of Hitler&#x27;s favorite locations, and he spent much time in his residence at the Obersalzberg. The KZ (concentration camp) in Dachau, near Munich, was the first to be established. But Bavaria was also the scene of passive resistance to the regime, the most well known of this being the White Rose. Nürnberg, Bavaria&#x27;s second-largest city, became the scene of massive rallies, the &quot;Reichsparteitage&quot;. Ironically, the last of those in 1939, titled &quot;Reichsparteitag des Friedens&quot; (&quot;Reichsparteitag of peace&quot;), was canceled due to the outbreak of the second world war. After the war, the city was chosen for this reason to become the location of the war crimes trials, the Nuremberg Military Tribunals.

Bavaria had approximately 54,000 Jewish people living in its borders at the turn of the 20th century. By 1933, still 41,000 lived in the state. By 1939, this number had shrunk to 16,000. Few of those survived the Nazi rule.

===Bavaria during the Federal Republic of Germany===
Following the end of World War II, Bavaria was occupied by US forces, who reestablished the state on 19 September 1945. In 1946 Bavaria lost its district on the Rhine, the Palatinate. The destruction caused by aerial bombings during the war, alongside the arrival of refugees from the parts of Germany now under Soviet occupation, caused major problems for the authorities. By September 1950, 2,155,000 expellees had found refuge in Bavaria, nearly 27 percent of the population. Of these, 1,025,000 were Sudeten Germans from Bohemia and Moravia and 459,000 were Germans from Polish-annexed Silesia. A further large group were German-speakers from Hungary. In the following decades, Sudeten Germans were acknowledged as Bavaria&#x27;s fourth largest ethnic group, along with Bavarians, Franconians, and Swabians. 

Bavaria is home to the Bavarian Party, founded in 1946, whose goal is to establish an independent Bavarian state. For a time, the idea that Bavaria might become independent again was seriously entertained by the Allied occupation authorities, along with a possible union between Bavaria and Austria. With the onset of the Cold War, support for Bavarian independence evaporated both within Bavaria and from the Western allies, and Bavaria became one of the constituent states of the new Bundesrepublik in 1949.

Three years prior, the first post-World War II state elections had been held on 30 June 1946, when 180 delegates were chosen. The main task of those delegates was to draft a new Bavarian constitution since the day-to-day running of the state still lay with the US authorities. The new constitution was accepted by a public vote on 1 December 1946, the same day the first post-war state parliament (German: &quot;Landtag&quot;) was elected. Bavaria was politically dominated by the Christian Social Union (CSU), sister party of the Christian Democratic Union, the main center-right party in Germany, until 1954. Bavaria was then governed by a coalition under the leadership of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, returning to the CSU in 1957.

Since the 1960s Bavaria has seen a dynamic development to one of Europe&#x27;s leading economic zones, the country is no longer mainly an agricultural region but hosts a variety of high tech industries.

After the CSU lost more than 17% of the votes in the Bavarian state elections of 2008, incumbent Minister-President Günther Beckstein and Chairman of the CSU, Erwin Huber, announced their resignations. Horst Seehofer was quickly proposed as their successor. At a party convention on 25 October, he was affirmed as the new Chairman of the CSU, and on 27 October he was elected Minister-President by the Landtag with votes from the Free Democratic Party, forming the first coalition government in Bavaria since 1962.

In 2008, Bavaria became the first federal state of Germany to completely ban smoking in bars and restaurants. After this restriction was criticized as being &quot;too harsh&quot; by some members of the CSU, it was relaxed one year later. Supporters of smoking bans then brought about a public referendum on the issue, which led to even firmer restrictions than the initial ban. Thereafter, a more comprehensive ban was introduced in 2010.

<doc id="148598" wikidata="Q157485" url="?curid=148598" title="Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor">
<text>The Focke-Wulf Fw 200 &quot;Condor&quot;, also known as &quot;Kurier&quot; (German for &quot;courier&quot;) to the Allies, is an all-metal four-engined monoplane designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Focke-Wulf. It was the first heavier-than-air craft to fly nonstop between Berlin and New York City, about , making the flight from Berlin-Staaken to Floyd Bennett Field on 10/11 August 1938 in 24 hours and 56 minutes.

It was originally proposed by the aeronautical engineer Kurt Tank as a long-range land-based airliner for the flag carrier Deutsche Luft Hansa. A key feature of the Fw 200 was its ability to cruise at altitudes in excess of , which made long distance routes more viable. A specification was issued in June 1936 and the maiden flight of the first prototype took place on 27 July 1937. Civilian Fw 200 was operated by Deutsche Luft Hansa, Det Danske Luftfartselskab, Syndicato Condor (the latter being Luft Hansa&#x27;s Brazilian subsidiary), Cruzeiro do Sul, and the British Overseas Airways Corporation. The outbreak of the Second World War prevented the fulfilment of further civil orders for the type.

While intended for use as an airliner, the type was adapted for military purposes in response to a Japanese Navy request for a long-range maritime patrol aircraft. Military versions of the Fw 200 were adopted by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, which used the type as both a long-range reconnaissance and maritime patrol aircraft, anti-shipping bomber, and transport aircraft. The Fw 200 was used to support the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; in both the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. It achieved success as a commerce raider in the Battle of the Atlantic, contributing to the heavy Allied shipping losses. By mid-1941, it was being increasingly harried by long-range aircraft dispatched by RAF Coastal Command as well as Hurricane fighters being flown from CAM ships. On 14 August 1942, an Fw 200C-3 was the first German aircraft to be destroyed by USAAF pilots, after it was attacked by a Curtiss P-40C Warhawk and a Lockheed P-38F Lightning over Iceland.

By the latter half of 1943, the Luftwaffe was almost exclusively using the Fw 200 as a transport aircraft. On numerous occasions, senior Nazi officials, including Joachim von Ribbentrop, Heinrich Himmler, Albert Speer, Hermann Göring, and Karl Dönitz made use of special aircraft. Furthermore, Adolf Hitler had a single customised Fw 200 made available as his personal aircraft. Following the end of the conflict, only limited use of the type was made, largely by Spain, due to a lack of available spares. By the twenty-first century, only a single complete reconstructed Fw 200 exists; it has been displayed at Berlin Tempelhof Airport.

==Design and development==
The Fw 200 originated from a proposal made by the aeronautical engineer Kurt Tank, the chief designer of the German aircraft manufacturer Focke-Wulf to Dr. Rudolf Stüssel of the flag carrier Deutsche Luft Hansa for the development of a landplane capable of carrying passengers across the Atlantic Ocean to the United States. At the time, it was an unusual concept because airlines typically opted for seaplanes on their long over-water routes. To fly long distances economically, the Fw 200 was designed to cruise at an altitude of over - as high as possible without a pressurized cabin. Existing airliners were designed to cruise at altitudes below . The Fw 200 was briefly the world&#x27;s most modern airliner, until other high-altitude airliners entered service: the Boeing 307 Stratoliner in 1940 and the Douglas DC-4 in 1942. The designation &quot;Condor&quot; was chosen because, like the condor bird, the Fw 200 had a very long wingspan compared to other planes of its era, to facilitate high-altitude flight.

During June 1936, following discussions between Tank, Stüssel and Carl August von Gablenz, Deutsche Luft Hansa issued a specification. Focke-Wulf responded with what would become the Fw 200, a four-engined low-winged monoplane, almost entirely constructed of metal (exceptions include the fabric-covered flight control surfaces). It could accommodate up to 26 passengers in two cabins. The Fw 200 had a retractable landing gear; the legs of the main gear featured an unorthodox design which was to allow their deployment without any power other than that of the slipstream in the event of an emergency. On 16 July of that year, Focke-Wulf were awarded an initial contract.

On 27 July 1937, the first prototype, Fw 200 V1, conducted its maiden flight with Tank at the controls. It was powered by four American Pratt &amp; Whitney Hornet radial engines. Two further prototypes were built; these differed from the first only in that they were powered by German BMW 132G-1 radials instead.

The Japanese Navy placed an order for a single militarised version of the Fw 200 outfitted to conduct search and patrol duties. Accordingly, Fw 200 V10 was constructed with military apparatus; while completed, this Fw 200 remained in Germany due to the outbreak of war in Europe by that point. At the direction of Edgar Peterson, the aircraft was adapted for long range reconnaissance and anti-shipping duties with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; to meet Germany&#x27;s wartime needs. The adaptions made included the addition of hardpoints to the wings for bombs, strengthening of the fuselage (which was also extended to create more space), and the addition of fore and aft dorsal gun positions. Furthermore, an extended-length version of the &quot;Bola&quot; ventral gondola typical of Second World War-era German bomber aircraft was adopted; it incorporated a central bomb bay (which was typically used for additional long-range fuel tanks), as well as heavily glazed fore and aft ventral flexible machine gun emplacements at either end.

One unfortunate consequence of the extra weight incurred by the added military equipment, in combination with its relatively weak structure, was the loss of several early-build Fw 200s when they broke up during landing, often due to the failure of the rear spar. In response to this issue, later models were structurally strengthened. Some later-built aircraft were equipped with Lorenz FuG 200 &quot;Hohentwiel&quot; low UHF-band ASV radar in the nose; this apparatus permitted the Fw 200 to effectively perform blind bombing missions for the first time. In 1943, a version entered service that could carry the Henschel Hs 293 guided missile, mandating fitment of the associated &quot;Funkgerät&quot; FuG 203 &quot;Kehl&quot; radio guidance gear on a Condor to steer them. As the threat of interception grew as the war went on, the defensive armament on later-build Fw 200s was also bolstered.

In response to Germany&#x27;s wartime demands, production of the Fw 200 climbed from 26 aircraft in 1940 to a peak of 84 aircraft in 1942. However, amid the Allied bombing of Germany, Focke-Wulf&#x27;s factory in Cottbus was damaged, compelling the transfer of final assembly work to rival company Blohm and Voss. During 1944, only four Fw 200s were completed. Production was terminated that year, at which point 276 aircraft had been produced.

==Operational history==

The Fw 200 was operated by Deutsche Luft Hansa, Det Danske Luftfartselskab (DDL) and Luft Hansa&#x27;s Brazilian subsidiary Syndicato Condor. Dai Nippon KK of Japan also ordered Fw 200 airliners; these could not be delivered to Japan once the war began, so they were delivered to Deutsche Luft Hansa instead. On 14 April 1945, an Fw 200 flew Luft Hansa&#x27;s last scheduled service before the end of the Second World War, flying from Barcelona to Berlin. Other airlines continued to operate the Fw 200 after the end of the Second World War.

The first prototype, Fw 200 V1, upgraded with extra fuel tanks and redesignated Fw 200 S-1, made several record flights. It was the first heavier-than-air craft to fly nonstop between Berlin and New York City, about , making the flight from Berlin-Staaken to Floyd Bennett Field on 10/11 August 1938 in 24 hours and 56 minutes. The return trip on 13 August 1938 took 19 hours and 47 minutes. These flights are commemorated with a plaque in Böttcherstraße, a street in Bremen. Beginning on 28 November 1938, it flew from Berlin to Tokyo via Basra, Karachi and Hanoi.

German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop used a specially outfitted Condor &quot;Grenzmark&quot;, on his two flights to Moscow in 1939, during which he negotiated and signed the &quot;Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union&quot;, better known as the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. His aircraft bore the German civil registration of D-ACVH.

A Danish-owned Fw 200, named &quot;Dania&quot;, was seized by the British at Shoreham Airport after Denmark was invaded by German forces in 1940. It was subsequently operated by British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and was then pressed into service with the Royal Air Force. It was damaged beyond repair in 1941.

During September 1939, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; took delivery of a batch of ten pre-production Fw 200Cs. As they were unarmed, the first four aircraft were exclusively used as transports alongside the earlier Fw 200Bs. Amongst other early operations, the type was used during the German invasion of Norway. Operational sorties of the armed Fw 200Cs, however, did not take place until 8 April 1940. The Luftwaffe used its maritime-configured Fw 200c to support the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;; a typical patrol flight consisted of large circuits out across the North Sea and, following the fall of France, the Atlantic Ocean. The type was used for maritime patrols and reconnaissance, searching for Allied convoys and warships that could be reported for targeting by U-boats. Occasionally, the type was also used to lay naval mines around port entrances across the east coast of England.

A maritime-configured Fw 200 could carry a bomb load or mines to use against shipping, and it was claimed that from June 1940 to February 1941, they sank 331,122 tonnes (365,000 tons) of shipping despite being furnished with a rather crude bombsight. These attacks were typically carried out at extremely low altitude in order to &quot;bracket&quot; the target ship with three bombs; this almost guaranteed a hit. Winston Churchill called the Fw 200 the &quot;Scourge of the Atlantic&quot; during the Battle of the Atlantic due to its contribution to the heavy Allied shipping losses.

Following the debut of what would become the Luftwaffe&#x27;s primary &quot;seaborne&quot; maritime patrol aircraft, the rival trimotor BV 138C flying boat in March 1941; from mid-1941, Condor crews were instructed to stop attacking shipping and avoid all combat in order to preserve numbers. In August, the first Fw 200 was shot down by a CAM ship-launched Hawker Hurricane, and the arrival of the U.S.-built Grumman Martlet, operating from the Royal Navy&#x27;s new escort carriers, posed a serious threat. The six Martlets operated by the Royal Navy from the first escort carrier shot down a total of seven Condors while escorting three convoys during her short career in the final months of 1941. On 14 August 1942, an Fw 200C-3 was the first German aircraft to be destroyed by USAAF pilots, after it was attacked by a Curtiss P-40C Warhawk and a Lockheed P-38F Lightning over Iceland.

The Fw 200 was also used as a transport aircraft, notably flying supplies into Stalingrad in 1943. The type was occasionally used in clandestine operations in support of German spies. After late 1943, the Fw 200 came to be used solely for transport. In the reconnaissance role, it was replaced with the Junkers Ju 290, and even some examples of the Heinkel He 177 Greif bombers serving with Kampfgeschwader 40. With the Allied advance into France, maritime reconnaissance by the Luftwaffe became impossible as the Atlantic coastal bases were captured.
Several damaged Fw 200s landed in Spain during the conflict. In the beginning, they were repaired and returned to their bases in France. After Operation Torch (the Allied invasion of French North Africa), the Spanish government interned four aircraft that arrived on Spanish territory (although their crews were still allowed to return to Germany). Since the aircraft could not be used, they were sold by Germany to Spain. One of the three flyable aircraft was then operated by the Spanish Air Force and the others used for spares. Because of damage and lack of spares, and for political reasons, they were grounded and scrapped around 1950.

Some Condors also crashed in Portugal. Their crews were allowed to return to Germany while the British authorities were allowed to inspect the aircraft and accompanying documentation. Some crew members died in these crashes and were buried in the civilian cemetery of Moura in Alentejo Province, Portugal. The aircraft that crashed in Spain and Portugal had been based at Bordeaux-Merignac, France since 1940. Before then, the operational base of the Fw 200 squadrons had been in Denmark.

===Hitler&#x27;s personal transport===

At the suggestion of his personal pilot Hans Baur, Adolf Hitler specified a modified and unarmed prototype Condor, the Fw 200 V3, as his personal transport, as a replacement for his Junkers Ju 52. Originally configured as a 26-passenger &quot;Luft Hansa&quot; transport (Works No. 3099), it was reconfigured as a plush two-cabin airliner. Hitler&#x27;s armchair-style seat in the cabin was equipped with a wooden table, seat-back armour plating, and a parachute in the seat cushion, with an escape hatch in the floor. In line with Hitler&#x27;s aircraft preferences, it carried the markings &quot;D-2600&quot; and was named &quot;Immelmann III&quot; in honour of World War I flying ace Max Immelmann. As the war progressed it changed designation to &quot;WL+2600&quot; and finally &quot;26+00&quot;; it was destroyed at Berlin Tempelhof Airport in an Allied bombing raid on 18 July 1944. FW 200s of various types were configured as VIP transports, for the use of Hitler and his staff, other aircraft being assigned to Heinrich Himmler, Albert Speer, Hermann Göring, and Karl Dönitz.

=== Allied tactics used against the Condor ===
Royal Naval Fleet Air Arm pilot Captain Eric Brown&#x27;s aircraft was seriously damaged by defensive fire during an attack he made on a Condor in 1940, and he narrowly survived. After this, he studied the design of the Condor seriously for some time. He managed to work out that the forward firing machine gun positions could swivel, but could only fire in a certain arc otherwise they would hit the fuselage of their own plane. Brown worked out where the arc was, and realised this was a blind spot, if one attacked the front of the plane. He used this to successfully destroy a Condor, then informed his fellow squadron pilots who used the tactic to destroy others.

==Variants==
There were three variants of the aircraft: the Fw 200A, B, and C. The Model A was a purely civilian variant used by Deutsche Luft Hansa, DDL in Denmark, and &quot;Syndicato Condor&quot; in Brazil. The Fw 200B and Fw 200C models were used as long-range bombers, reconnaissance, troop and transport aircraft.

==Surviving aircraft==

Only one complete reconstructed Fw 200 exists today, an aircraft that ditched in February 1942 and sank to a depth of 60 m (197 ft). This aircraft was raised from Trondheim Fjord in Norway on 26 May 1999. Although the airframe disintegrated while being lowered onto a recovery platform, the remains were transported to Airbus Bremen and spent 22 years being rebuilt. A request from the Berlin museum for a set of separate wings to be recovered from the Kvitanosi mountain near Voss in Norway to complete the rebuilding was at first denied, because the local population wanted the wings to be left &quot;in situ&quot; as a war memorial. A compromise was reached in 2008, where parts not needed for the restoration would be left on the mountain. In 2009, parts were moved down by helicopter and made ready for transport to Bremen. Other wrecks were also found, but in extremely poor conditions, one at 68 m deep. The aircraft was finished in June 2021, then dismantled and transported to the former Berlin Tempelhof Airport for final assembly as an exhibit in Hangar 7.

<text>Storstrøm County () is a former county (Danish: &quot;amt&quot;) on the islands of Zealand (&quot;Sjælland&quot;), Møn, Falster, Lolland and some minor islands in southeast Denmark. The county was formed on 1 April 1970, comprising the former counties of Maribo and Præstø. The county was abolished effective January 1, 2007, when it merged into Region Sjælland (i.e. &quot;Region Zealand&quot;).

The county was a somewhat artificial construction as the islands of Lolland and Falster did not traditionally share any institutions with Zealand, but rather with Funen. Locally, the adjectives &quot;nordenstrøms&quot; and &quot;søndenstrøms&quot;, i.e. &quot;north&quot; and &quot;south of the Stream&quot; were used to designate the Zealand-Møn and Lolland-Falster parts respectively, as they were separated by the strait Storstrømmen (&quot;The Great Stream&quot;) from which the county derived its name.

==Insignia==
The official coat of arms featured in chief a goose representing the Goose Tower on Vordingborg Castle in the former Præstø County. The two sea serpents (&quot;lindorme&quot;) were taken from the arms of the former Maribo County. The stream in the centre represents the Storstrømmen Strait. This coat of arms drifted out of use during the last years of the county&#x27;s existence, and had effectively been replaced by a logo showing one of the Farø Bridges which span the Storstrømmen Strait, thus linking the northern and southern part of the county.

<text>Maribo is a town in Lolland Municipality in Region Sjælland on the island of Lolland in south Denmark. It was the municipal seat of the former Maribo Municipality, until 1 January 2007, and then it became the seat of the current Lolland Municipality.

The merchant town of Maribo is located centrally on Lolland. Its population is 5,827 (1 January 2024). It has, among other facilities, a gymnasium (Secondary school), a public international school, an open-air museum and a cultural heritage museum.
A brewery, &quot;Maribo Bryghus&quot; used to be located in the town, but it was closed down in 2008 by its owner, Unibrew. Beer labeled &quot;Maribo Øl&quot; is still available, but it is brewed elsewhere.

==Surroundings==

Maribo is surrounded by &quot;Nørresø&quot; (&quot;The Northern Lake&quot; or &quot;Northern Maribo Lake&quot;) to the north and &quot;Søndersø&quot; (&quot;The Southern Lake&quot; or &quot;Southern Maribo Lake&quot;) to the south. &quot;Søndersø&quot; is, with an area of 852 hectare, the largest lake on Lolland. There are more islands in &quot;Søndersø&quot; than in any other lake in Denmark. These include the islands of Fruerø, Hestø, Præstø, Borgø, Lindø, Askø and Worsaaes. This is part of the Maribo Lakes Nature Park, which spans the towns of Maribo, Holeby, Sakskøbing and Nysted.

==History==
Saint Birgitta (1303–1373), also known as Birgitta of Vadstena, has cast her shadow on this municipality, and is shown on the municipality&#x27;s coat-of-arms. Her order established the Bridgettine Order&#x27;s Abbey in Maribo, when 1416 monks from Vadstena Abbey were sent to Maribo, then called Skimminge, to help establish a monastery.

In 1536, however, the abbey was abolished and transformed into a convent for noble virgins in 1556. After the old town church burned down in 1596, the abbey church then in place received status as town church.

King Christian IV&#x27;s daughter, Leonora Christina Ulfeldt, was probably the abbey&#x27;s most famous resident. In 1685 after her release from 21 years imprisonment for high treason from the Blue Tower (&quot;Blåtårn&quot;) in Copenhagen&#x27;s Castle, she spent her final years in the then already dilapidated abbey, and was buried in a crypt at the church, until her body was removed shortly after the burial.

In 1803-1804 the islands of Lolland-Falster, which previously belonged to the Funen diocese, were made into an independent diocese, and the abbey church was given the status of the diocese&#x27;s cathedral (&quot;domkirke&quot;) now known as Maribo Cathedral. The bishop, however, resides in Nykøbing Falster.

Several times during the 1800s the church has been secured against decline.

==Transport and Infrastructure==

The town is served by Maribo railway station, located at Lollandsbanen, a railway line between and , which is operated by the railway company Lokaltog A/S since 2015. 

Lolland Falster Airport is located south of Maribo between the towns of Holeby and Rødby.

==Maribo Municipality==

Until 1 January 2007, Maribo was also a municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) in the former Storstrøm County. The municipality, which included the islands of Askø (&quot;Ash Island&quot;) and Lilleø (&quot;little Island&quot;) in the Rågø Sound, covered an area of 154 km2, and had a total population of 11,098 (2005). Its last mayor was Liljan Køcks, a member of the Socialist People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Socialistisk Folkeparti&quot;) political party.

Maribo Municipality ceased to exist as the result of &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007). It was merged with Holeby, Højreby, Nakskov, Ravnsborg, Rudbjerg and Rødby municipalities to form the new Lolland Municipality. This created a municipality with an area of 892 km2 and a total population of 49,469 (2005).

<text>Møn () is an island in south-eastern Denmark. Until 1 January 2007, it was a municipality in its own right but it is now part of the municipality of Vordingborg, after merging with the former municipalities of Langebæk, Præstø, and Vordingborg. This has created a municipality with an area of and a total population of 46,307 (2005). It belongs to the Region Sjælland (&quot;Zealand Region&quot;). Møn is one of Denmark&#x27;s most popular destinations for tourists with its white chalk cliffs, countryside, sandy beaches and the market town of Stege. In June 2017, UNESCO designated Møn as Denmark&#x27;s first biosphere reserve, consisting of &quot;a series of islands and islets in the southern Baltic Sea, over approximately . Its landscapes include woodlands, grasslands, meadows, wetlands, coastal areas, ponds and steep hills.&quot;

==Location==
Møn is located just off the south-eastern tip of Zealand from which it is separated by the waters of the &quot;Hølen&quot; strait between Kalvehave and the island of Nyord, at the northern end of Møn. Further south is Stege Bay. At the narrowest point between the two islands, the waters are referred to as Wolf Strait (&quot;Ulvsund&quot;), which is the primary strait separating Møn from Zealand.

To the southwest is Stubbekøbing on the island of Falster, which is separated from Møn by the Grønsund (Green Strait).
There are a number of islands in the waters off Møn, including Nyord and Bogø, the smaller island of Farø, as well as the islands of Langø, Tærø and Lilleø off the coast of Zealand. The island of Lindholm in Stege Bugt is state-owned, and is the location for the State Veterinary Institute for Virus Research (&quot;Statens Veterinære Institut for Virusforskning&quot;).

==Transport links==

Møn is connected to Zealand at the town of Kalvehave by the Queen Alexandrine Bridge. The bridge opened for traffic on 30 May 1943, and is named after Queen Alexandrine, the Queen Consort of King Christian X. The bridge is long and considered to be one of Denmark&#x27;s most attractive bridges.

At the south-western corner, Møn connects by causeway to the island of Bogø. From Bogø another causeway connects to the small island of Farø, which acts as the centre point for the Farø Bridges carrying the motorway between Zealand and Falster. The north Farø bridge has a span of , the south bridge a span of with a central span for shipping. The central span is supported by cables from two pylons which raise the bridge above sea level. The bridge was completed in 1984 and forms part of Euroroute E47 from Copenhagen (and Helsingborg) to Lübeck (and thence Hamburg and the south).

At the north-western tip of Møn there is a narrow bridge to the small island of Nyord.

==The town of Stege==

Stege, the largest town on the island of Møn, is situated approximately at the centre point of the island at the mouth of Stege Nor, a lake which connects directly to the sea. The population is around 4,000. The town has a great deal of charm with historic buildings, a marina and several restaurants and cafes. Stege Church built in the Romanesque style dates from the early 13th century. The annual &quot;Stege Festival&quot; takes place every Tuesday in July, and the first Tuesday in August.

==Attractions==
Møn is known for its natural environment, sandy beaches, fresco-decorated churches, Stone Age and Bronze Age passage graves and monuments, and Møns Klint (&quot;The White Cliffs of Møn&quot;), the island&#x27;s most popular attraction.

The cliffs, c. 6 km long and up to 128 metres tall, are Denmark&#x27;s highest, and support a unique set of natural habitats. Access to the narrow beach is via a flight of 500 steps from the parking area set within the beech forest behind the cliffs. The GeoCenter Møns Klint, a geological museum tracing the origins of Denmark and the formation of the cliffs opened there in May 2007. The combination of chalk in the subsoil with a dry local climate, and its agricultural use consisting primarily of cattle grazing, has created some of Denmark&#x27;s richest meadowlands. The chalk was transported to Møn during the fourth, and most recent, major ice age.
Another attraction close to the cliffs is Liselund, the romantic summer residence erected in the 1790s by French nobleman Antoine de Bosc de la Calmette for his wife, Lise. The miniature thatched palace and grounds were designed by Andreas Kirkerup, one of the foremost landscape architects of the times. A larger house was constructed in the park in 1887 by Baron Fritz Rosenkrantz, which is now a hotel. The park is open to the public and includes the original thatched manor house, Swiss cottage, Chinese tea house and Norwegian log cabin. Calmette was also responsible for the park at Marienborg, to the west of Stege.

At the north-western corner of Møn is a narrow bridge to the island of Nyord. The small village on the island has a number of quaint cottages and farmhouses as well as a unique octagonal church and a small harbour. Nyord is an important habitat for geese, ducks and other wading birds. There is a bird-watching tower for the use of visitors.

The islands of Møn and Nyord were designated a Dark Sky Park in 2017 by The International Dark Sky Association, as the first place in Scandinavia. The Dark Sky Park Møn &amp; Nyord has become a popular attraction for European and domestic tourists looking to escape the ever increasing light pollution in urban areas. Authorised tour guides help visitors enjoy the night sky and the nocturnal environment.
At the south-western corner, Møn connects by causeway to the 5 by 7 km island of Bogø. The island has a preserved windmill, an old boarding school and a summer ferry to Stubbekøbing.
Møn has a number of interesting churches decorated with frescos. Fanefjord Church dates back to the 13th century, and has a set of recently restored frescos painted in 1450 by the Elmelunde Master. Frescos can also be seen in Elmelunde Church, the oldest church on the island, with parts dating from the start of the 12th century. Keldby Church has a unique altarpiece and is also richly decorated with frescos. Another interesting church is the one at Damsholte. It is one of the finest Rococo buildings in Denmark and the only village church built in the Rococo style.

The oldest and perhaps most impressive burial mound on Møn is Grønsalen near Fanefjord Church. The 100 m by 10 m barrow is from around 3500 BC. According to legend, it is the resting place of Chief Grønjæger (Greenranger) and his wife Queen Fane, after whom Grønsund and Fanefjord were named. There are also barrows at Raaby and Busemarke. There is also a 5,000-year-old round burial barrow at Sømarke, and others at Jættestue and Jordehøj. Kong Asgers Høj at Sprove is the largest gallery grave in Denmark, more than 4,000 years old. It has been fully excavated and can be visited inside. There is another round barrow at nearby Rundysse, and a further recently restored 9 metre long double passage gallery grave at Klekkende Høj from the Neolithic age c. 4,500 years old.

Thorsvang, Danmarks Samlermuseum is a museum of collectables arranged in a number of old shops typical of the early 20th century. It is located in the Lendemarke district of Stege.

There is a jewellery museum in the little village of Damme and near Keldbylille, there is a museum (Museumsgaarden) depicting life on a Møn farm as it was 100 years ago. There are also several art galleries and arts and crafts centres on the island.

Møn also has a number of popular beach resorts, particularly in East Møn with Ulvshale to the north and Råbylille Strand, Klintholm Havn and Hårbølle on the south side of the island.

==History==
===Early settlements===
There is evidence that people lived in Denmark more than 100,000 years ago, but the area became covered with ice during the last ice age. People returned to Møn about 10,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic era. At that time the island was part of mainland Europe.

During the Mesolithic era (6800-3900 BC) there is evidence from findings of small flint and bone tools that inhabitants of the island lived by hunting and fishing. The landscape was largely wooded, with hazel and increasingly oak and alder trees. From around 5400 BC reforestation was complete, forming an inaccessible forest and forcing out the last of the big animals such as aurochs and elk. Human habitations have been found along the eastern coast.

The Neolithic era, (3900-1700 BC) saw the start of cattle farming spreading inland from the coastal settlements. Flint axes were used, and trading occurred in flint, gold, copper and bronze. This era saw the start of barrow building for the dead, and settlements have been found at Rødkilde. Barrows became larger, longer and contained multiple burials. More than 100 large graves have been found on Møn. The period from 2400–1700 is known as Doltktiden, after the flint daggers which became common at that time. Bronze was also in use, imported from the south.

Around 2000 BC, a new wave of people arrived on Møn, the Stridsøksekulturen (the battleaxe people). They brought with them goats, sheep and horses, and their trademark stone battleaxes. They used simpler graves with small round mounds.

Bronze became more common, hence the period 1700-500 BC became the Bronze Age and flint ceased to be used for tools. Large round mounds were used for burial, and more than 200 of these have been found on Møn. Each mound covered a single grave, containing a coffin made from a single split and hollowed oak tree. From 1000 to 500 BC, graves became smaller and cremation began to be practiced. Graves were encircled by a ring of stones. Fewer items were buried with the dead, as a result of changes in society which made grave robbing more likely.

From 500 BC, iron began to be used in the Pre-Roman Iron Age. The climate became cooler and wetter, causing difficulties for agriculture. Few remains have been found from the period 500-0 BC, but Celtic culture became an influence.

The Roman Empire stopped short of Denmark, but from 0-400 AD in the Roman Iron Age there is evidence of imported Roman goods in silver, bronze and gold. Little has been found from the post-Roman Germanic Iron Age until about 800 AD. Two treasure hoards have been found on Møn from the Viking Age 800–1050.

===Unification of Denmark===

The last recorded independent ruler of the island of Møn was Hemming, son of Sigvard Snogøje (Sigvard Snake-eye) in the early 10th century, who carried out raids on other territories. Møn itself was subject to raids, particularly Wends from Rügen and Fehmarn.

From 900 to 1000 AD forests were steadily cleared and there was a profitable trade in grain with the Baltic countries. The relative wealth and large population of the island is indicated by the large number of churches built at that time. However, this wealth increased the likelihood of Vendian raids. This in turn led to the deliberate retention of some coastal forest areas as protection against raiders.

The construction of the castle of Stegeborg was around 1220 in timber, then rebuilt in brick by 1245, despite this being a relatively peaceful period. On the death of King Valdemar II in 1241, a dispute arose over the succession, which led to the island being raided by Lubeckers who took the part of one of the claimants, Knud Duke of Blekinge who was imprisoned by his brother Erik Plovpenning (king 1241–1250) in Stegeborg. The Lubeckers conquered Copenhagen, then Stege to release the Duke. These raids continued intermittently into the 16th century. The succession wars also led to further raids in 1260 when the island was seized by Prince Järmer of Rügen. The Germans gained rights to establish a trading outpost at Brøndhøj. A Norwegian, Alf Ellingsen, was also attracted by the island, defeating a defending fleet of 30 vessels to raid Møn and other islands during the reign of Erik Glipping (1259–1286). Glipping granted Stege a town charter, granting it sole rights to trade and tax certain commodities, which existed until 1857.

From the middle of the 12th to the mid-17th century, Møn became a Danish crown property and was managed by a feudal lord. Its relative importance meant that appointments were made from the ranks of highest Danish nobility. The lord had responsibility for maintaining order and collecting taxes, hosting visits from royalty and important guests, and judging legal disputes. As a royal possession, the island was used as surety against loans made to the crown, and passed into various hands while debts remained unpaid. This gave the pledge holders the right to extract whatever revenue they could from the island while it remained pledged as security. Prince Witslav of Rügen held the island for 20 years from 1286, resulting in rebellions against him and further Norwegian raids.

===Herring fisheries, prosperity and decline===
The island, and Stege in particular, prospered in the 14th century from the results of herring fishing, reaching the height of its wealth around 1500. It adopted a coat of arms including three herrings, and the town defences were strengthened. Around 1430 a rampart, wall and moat were created around the town by Eric VII. Three towers were created at each of the main approach roads, of which only Møllerporten still survives. However, the fortifications were no defence against fire, which at one point destroyed the greater part of the town, or against the plague.

In 1447, King Christopher III granted the town rights to trade outside Møn, within the remainder of Denmark. In 1450, Christian I forbade farmers to trade goods outside of Denmark, with the result that they sailed directly to Germany to sell their goods, bypassing the town of Stege, which was starved of goods and revenue. In 1476, the town received confirmation of its historic rights and, in 1481, a further law forbade foreigners trading with farmers on Møn. This was reaffirmed by King Hans in 1507.

In 1510, the Lubeckers attacked Møn in retaliation for the trade sanctions, failing to take Stege but destroying the island&#x27;s second largest town, Borre. The trade war continued, and in 1524 Frederick I again felt the need to repeat the ban on trade on Møn anywhere except in the town of Stege. In 1533, Frederick died leading again to a dispute over the crown. The townspeople sided with the previously deposed Christian II, but the castle was in the hands of Christian III. As a result, the castle was taken by deceit by townspeople and blown up. The four leaders were hanged, but the castle was not rebuilt. In 1538, Christian III once again repeated the trade ban, as the citizens of Stege still could not obtain sufficient food for the town.

At the start of the 16th century, around 2000 people lived in Stege. However, the herring fisheries were in decline and the town was taxed heavily to pay for continuing wars. Farmers began to sell goods to the harbour at Grønsund, and the island was again pledged against a debt. By 1582 Frederick II was obliged to cut taxes on the town and waive unpaid back taxes, as the town was effectively bankrupt. In 1583, trade with Germany was again banned. Christian IV granted land outside Stege to the town so that the inhabitants might grow food for themselves. In 1627, more land was granted.

The death of Christian IV in 1648 meant the end of the 30-year war, but his successor Frederick III commenced war against Sweden. Copenhagen was occupied and Swedes sought to invade Møn by walking across the ice from Zealand. This was prevented by the islanders, who maintained a three-mile long opening in the ice to stop the invasion force. However, in May 1659, 3,000 Swedes invaded from the island of Bogø against a force of 500 defenders. Stege was occupied, the town hall and 300 farms destroyed, the island looted and the harvest lost. At the end of the war, in 1660, the island&#x27;s population was reduced to 670.

Frederick III introduced direct rule, replacing feudal regions with counties and attempted to restore the economy. However, in 1664 Møn was again pledged against loans, this time to a Dutchman Gabriel Marselis. In 1684, the pledge was redeemed, at which time Stege was half in ruins, almost all the forests had been cut down and many farms had been abandoned. In 1685, four battalions of cavalry were sent to the island and stationed at Marienborg. To build barracks at Marienborg, their commander Colonel Von Plessen demolished damaged buildings in Stege to re-use their stone, including the town wall and two of the gate towers. The third was converted into a prison. In 1696, the further depredation of the island was discovered by the authorities, and Plessen was himself imprisoned. All taxes on the island were cancelled for two years.

===Restored fortunes===

In 1703, an attempt was made to found a navigation school in Stege. This failed, but generally the Danish economy was beginning to recover from the long period of wars. In 1769, Crown property on Møn was sold which allowed farmers to buy their own land and wealthy individuals to create estates and begin to settle on the island. In 1774, a major fire destroyed 112 properties in the northern part of Stege, but by 1782 there were four distilleries in the town, and by 1807, 18.

In 1733, Christian VI introduced a law compelling peasants to remain on the estate where they were born until the age of 36. This was to provide a fixed work force, but also aid military conscription. The law was abolished in 1788 by the then regent, later to become Frederick VI.

By 1789, the population of Stege had climbed to 791 with 7,000 people on the island. In 1797, Antoine de Calmette was placed in charge of the county, and was, for once, a respected leader.

In 1857, the town trade monopoly was finally abolished.

At the start of the 20th century about 14,000 people lived on the island. This figure then fell, but stabilised in the 1970s.

==Economy==
Tourism plays an important role in the local economy. One of the largest employers is Bisca, a manufacturer of cakes and biscuits headquartered in Stege. Møns Bank traces its history back to 1877. About one third of its customers live on the island. The old town hall in Stege was converted into a centre for entrepreneurship in 2008 and is now home to some 10 start-ups.

==2010 veteran bicycle rally==
In June 2010, Møn hosted the 30th world vintage bicycle rally for the International Veteran Cycle Association. Some 150 enthusiasts from 17 countries visited the island with their historic pedal bicycles from 2 to 6 June. One of the challenges for the participants was to clock up between sunrise and sunset on velocipedes built between 1818 and 1960. Apart from countries across Europe, some participants came from as far as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States.

<text>Nørre Alslev () is a town with a population of 2,352 (1 January 2024) on the northern end of the island of Falster in south Denmark. It belongs to Guldborgsund municipality in Region Sjælland.

Until 1 January 2007 Nørre Alslev was the seat of the former Nørre Alslev municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) in the former Storstrøm County. The municipality covered an area of 181 km2, and had a total population of 9,595 (2005). Its last mayor was Niels Larsen, a member of the Venstre (Liberal Party) political party. Nørre Alslev municipality ceased to exist as the result of &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007). It was merged with Nykøbing Falster, Nysted, Sakskøbing, Stubbekøbing, and Sydfalster municipalities to form the new Guldborgsund municipality.

Two bridges connect the former municipality, and the rest of Falster, to Zealand. The 3,199 metre long Storstrøm Bridge connects the former municipality from near the town of Orehoved to Masnedø, an island in &quot;Storstrømmen&quot;, and the 201 metre long Masnedsund Bridge (&quot;Masnedsundbroen&quot;) continues from there to the town of Vordingborg. The Storstrøm Bridge supports two lanes of traffic, plus a single track of the South Line Railway. Both of these bridges were inaugurated in 1937.

Further to the east are the two Farø Bridges (the 1,726 metre long Farø High Bridge and the 1,596 metre long Farø Low Bridge) which opened in 1985.

<text>Nykøbing Falster (; originally named Nykøbing) is a city on the island of Falster in southern Denmark. It has a population of 16,636 (1 January 2024). Including the satellite town Sundby on the Lolland side, with a population of 3,233, the total population is 19,869.

Nykøbing Falster is the seat of the Guldborgsund &quot;kommune&quot; in Region Sjælland. The city lies on Falster, and is connected by the Frederick IX Bridge over the Guldborgsund (&quot;Guldborg Strait&quot;) waterway to the island of Lolland.

==Overview==
Nykøbing Falster is the largest city on the islands of Lolland and Falster, and is often called &quot;Nykøbing F.&quot; to distinguish it from at least two other cities in Denmark with the name of Nykøbing. Nykøbing Falster is the seat of state and regional authorities. Additionally, a city in Sweden is called Nyköping, which means exactly the same thing (&quot;new market&quot;) in the closely related language.

There is a long commercial district, walking street (&quot;gågade&quot;) on the Falster side of the city with a wide selection of shops. At the end of the street is a large plaza where special events are arranged. These include popular late-night events, which are held several times a year. It has a large central library in the center of town.

The town receives many visitors during the summer, especially from Germany.

==History==
=== Early history ===

Nykøbing Falster was founded around a 12th-century medieval castle. At the end of the 12th century, fortifications were set up on a peninsula on Guldborgsund for protection against the Wends, and these were later converted into Nykøbing Castle. The town of Nykøbing Falster grew up around these fortifications. After the Reformation, the castle was the residence of widowed Danish queens. As several queens of German descent resided here, many Germans came to the town.
Situated on a headland, the castle was protected from all sides. In its early days, the castle belonged to the royal house. Medieval documents issued in this region reveal that the royal court regularly visited the castle. This is the castle where Christopher II died (1332) and where Christian V was married (1667). Christian, Prince Elect of Denmark resided here. The castle was chartered in 1539. REF

The castle and the entire crown land on Falster were put up for sale in 1763 to help improve the poor state of government finances. The castle was sold for demolition, and only the modest ruin of one of the towers, Fars Hat (&quot;Father’s Hat&quot; in Danish) is in existence today.

===Recent history===
From 1970 to 2006, Nykøbing was the administrative seat of the former county of Storstrøm as well as the Nykøbing Falster municipality.

On 1 January 2007, the former Nykøbing Falster municipality merged with Nysted, Nørre Alslev, Sakskøbing, Stubbekøbing, and Sydfalster municipalities to form Guldborgsund municipality. This municipal reform, &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot;, created a municipality with an area of and a total population of 63,533 (2005) and will belong to the new Region Sjælland (&quot;Zealand Region&quot;). The former Nykøbing Falster municipality covered an area of with a total population of 25,483 (2005).

==Geography==

Nykøbing Falster is a harbor town which is located roughly in the middle of the western coast of the island of Falster. It is located where the Tingsted Stream (Danish: Tingsted Å) empties into the Guldborgsund strait which divides the islands of Falster and Lolland.

==Main sights==

The city has a few noteworthy buildings, including a wooden house from 1580 and &quot;Czarens Hus (&quot;The Tsar&#x27;s House&quot;)&quot;, named in memory of Tsar Peter the Great of Russia, who stayed there in 1716. The most noteworthy attraction is the city&#x27;s old water tower, Nykøbing Vandtårn, which was built in 1909 and remains an icon of the city and the surrounding areas. Today, the water tower houses a small cultural center holding art exhibitions and cultural events.

<text>Nakskov is a market town on the island of Lolland in south Denmark. The town has a population of 12,445 (1 January 2024) and is the largest town on the island of Lolland. It is located in Lolland municipality in Region Sjælland.

Nakskov is situated on the western coast of the island of Lolland, one of the agriculturally richest of the Danish islands. It lies adjacent to the inner part of the Nakskov Fjord, an inlet from the Langeland Belt (&quot;Langelandsbælt&quot;) that runs between the islands of Lolland and Langeland. Nakskov Fjord is a wildlife reserve, known for its bird life. Nakskov is one of the most environmentally conscious and cleanest towns of Denmark. Technological and environmental enterprises have replaced the earlier heavy industries, and in recent years, local government has restored the town.

==History==

The area of the current town of Nakskov was settled during the neolithic period and has been continuously inhabited since. The town received trade privileges in 1266, during the reign of king Erik V Glipping. Once the export center of western Lolland, Nakskov thrived on trade, commerce and industry. This changed gradually as overland traffic was enabled by a railway to the neighboring island of Falster in 1875. The connection to Sjælland and Copenhagen over the Storstrømsbroen bridge in 1937 shifted goods from the port of Nakskov. Over time, several industries and factories opened in the town, amongst them the sugar factory in 1882, and the shipyard in 1916.

Although traditionally a center of manufacturing and industry, when Denmark joined the EEC in 1973 and the subsidies were dismantled, it caused the industrial boom in shipbuilding to end. Subsequently, Nakskov turned to commerce and trade, and technological and environmental enterprises replaced the earlier heavy industries.

==Economy==

Denmark&#x27;s largest sugar factory is located in Nakskov. It processes about 12,000 tons of sugar beet per day and belongs to the German group Nordzucker.

==Nakskov municipality==
Until 1 January 2007, &quot;Nakskov&quot; was also the name of a municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) covering an area of 33 km², and with a total population of 14,745 (2006). Nowadays Nakskov is integrated into, and encompassed by, Lolland municipality. The last mayor of Nakskov was Flemming Bonne Hansen, a member of the Socialist People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Socialistisk Folkeparti&quot;) political party. Nakskov municipality ceased to exist as the result of &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007). It was merged with Holeby, Højreby, Maribo, Ravnsborg, Rudbjerg and Rødby municipalities to form the new Lolland municipality. This new municipality consists of an area of 892 km² and a total population of 48,634 (2007).

==Transport==

Nakskov is served by Nakskov railway station which is connected to and the rest of the Danish rail network by the Lollandsbanen railway line. Busses run within the town and to neighbouring towns, villages and areas. Bike routes follow the levees encompassing the island of Lolland.

Boats run from Nakskov to the islands of the Nakskov Fjord (Slotø, Vejlø, Enehøje, and Albuen). At Tårs, a short distance to the northwest of Nakskov, a car ferry across the Langeland Belt connects Nakskov to Spodsbjerg on the island of Langeland. Danish national road 9 between Odense on Funen and Nykøbing Falster on Falster passes by Nakskov.

==Attractions==

Nakskov Church, dating to the early 13th century, has carved works from the Baroque period including the pulpit (1630) by Jørgen Ringnis and the altarpiece (1656) by Anders Mortensen. 

Large parts of the wetlands around Nakskov were drained in the 19th century. The levee along the southern shore of the fjord allows to travel by foot or on a bicycle to Langø. Another attraction of Nakskov is the Danish sugar museum (sukkermuseum). The town also used to display an ex-Soviet submarine designated S-359 or U-359.

<text>Nysted is a town in Guldborgsund Municipality in Region Zealand on the southeastern coast of the island of Lolland in south Denmark. Nysted is located on the southern coast of Lolland, and has a population of 1,265 (1 January 2024).

==History==
The town and harbour originated during the Middle Ages near Aalholm Castle and a Franciscan cloister. The town was a natural crossroads for commerce and traffic on account of its having the only natural harbour on the south coast of Lolland.

During this time Lolland, and especially its southern coast, was vulnerable to attack by Wends, its neighbors on the opposite side of the Baltic Sea. Proximity to the castle was a great advantage to the people who lived there, but protection also meant that they belonged to the castle. On 7 December 1409 they were liberated when Eric of Pomerania gave Nysted merchant town status. This was re-established by King Christian II in 1513.

Like other merchant towns the citizens of Nysted joined in on Christian II&#x27;s side in the Count&#x27;s Feud, which resulted in the capture of Aalholm Castle in 1534 when Jørgen von der Wisch was absent. The castle then was overtaken by Count Christoffer, who held it for two years.

The town&#x27;s coastal advantage as a natural harbour disappeared with the advent of the railroad.

==Attractions==
The massive Aalholm Castle (&quot;Aalholm Slot &quot;), built ca. 1200, dominates the view from the harbour at Nysted. For over 1,000 years this stronghold has tried to protected the town&#x27;s citizens. It is one of the oldest, preserved Middle Ages fortresses in Denmark.

The castle has been enlarged several times, most recently in 1889. The castle was sold to the Raben-Levetzau family in 1725, who owned the property until 1995 when it was sold privately. It is owned today by the estate of the late Stig Husted Andersen. There is no entrance to the castle itself, but access is available to the park and forest via a path from the town. The Aalholm Automobile Museum (&quot;Automobilmuseet&quot;) is now closed, and all the cars are sold.
==Former municipality==
Until 1 January 2007 Nysted was the seat of the former Nysted municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) in the former Storstrøm County. The municipality covered an area of 142 km2, and had a total population of 5,417 (2005). Its last mayor was Lennart Andersen, a member of the Social Democrats (&quot;Socialdemokraterne&quot;) political party. Nysted municipality ceased to exist as the result of &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007). It was merged with Nykøbing Falster, Nørre Alslev, Sakskøbing, Stubbekøbing, and Sydfalster municipalities to form the new Guldborgsund municipality. This created a municipality with an area of 907 km2 and a total population of 63,533 (2005).

<doc id="148618" wikidata="Q13218306" url="?curid=148618" title="Sakskøbing">
<text>Sakskøbing (), previously spelled Sakskjøbing, is a town on the island of Lolland in south Denmark. It has a population of 4,556 (1 January 2024). Until 1 January 2007 it was the seat of the former Sakskøbing Municipality (Danish: &quot;kommune&quot;), and is now situated in Guldborgsund Municipality in Region Sjælland.

The town is located on the northeast coast of Lolland where the Sakskøbing River flows into the Sakskøbing Fjord, a narrow but navigable sea inlet, the innermost part of which constitutes the port of Sakskøbing. Mentioned for the first time in 1240, it arose as a ford over the river, and is referred to as a market town as early as 1270.

==History==

The town is mentioned for the first time as &quot;Saxakopingh&quot; in the &quot;Danish Census Book&quot; from 1240. Already in 1270 it was referred to as a market town together with the town of Nakskov in Western Lolland. In the Middle Ages, Sakskøbing was a mint, where the coins were minted with the two sheep shears known from the town&#x27;s coat of arms. Before he was king, King Christopher II of Denmark (1276–1332) resided in Sakskøbing from 1289 to 1315 when he was Duke of Lolland, and again in his last years. The town suffered from several fires, including in 1728, 1784 and 1800. In 1874, Sakskøbing was connected to the Danish rail network as the Lollandsbanen railway line between Nykøbing Falster and Nakskov was opened.

==Geography==

Sakskøbing is located on the north-eastern part of the island of Lolland in a flat and fertile moraine landscape. The town is located by a tunnel valley, a glacial terrain formation which runs from Sakskøbing in the northwest to the Guldborgsund strait in the southeast. It is located where the Sakskøbing River () empties into the Sakskøbing Fjord, an approximately long narrow and navigable inlet of Smålandsfarvandet, the body of water between the islands of Zealand, Lolland, Falster and Møn, and which on the last stretch to Sakskøbing narrows completely so that it looks more like a river than a inlet.

==Landmarks==
===Sakskøbing Church===

Sakskøbing Church is a late Romanesque brick building with a late Gothic tower. It was built around the year 1200; in the following centuries, the original church was extended with a nave and tower. The altarpiece, which dates back to the 16th century, is a late Gothic wood carving work from Lübeck. The present spire, which is 48 metres high, was built in 1852.

===Water tower===

The water tower in Sakskøbing, nicknamed &quot;Saxine&quot; or &quot;the smiling water tower&quot;, is a 33 meter tall water tower and a landmark for the town. The tower was built in 1908 by Christiani &amp; Nielsen, but did not receive its smile until 1982, when the architect Flemming Skude decorated it.

==Sakskøbing Municipality==

The former Sakskøbing Municipality, including the small island of Vigsø, covered an area of 176 km², and had a total population of 9,299 (2005). Its last mayor was Kaj Petersen a member of the Social Democrats (&quot;Socialdemokraterne&quot;) political party. To the north is Tår&#x27;s Cove (&quot;Tårs Vig&quot;) and beyond that Rågø Strait (&quot;Rågø Sund&quot;), the waterway which separates Lolland from Zealand. A finger of Rågø Strait cuts into the former municipality forming Sakskøbing Fjord and then Sakskøbing River (&quot;Sakskøbing å&quot;) which meanders through the former municipality, as well as through Nykøbing Falster and Nysted until it terminates near the town of Bregninge.

On 1 January 2007 Sakskøbing Municipality ceased to exist as the result of &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007). It was merged with existing Nykøbing Falster, Nysted, Nørre Alslev, Stubbekøbing, and Sydfalster municipalities to form the new Guldborgsund Municipality. This created a municipality with an area of 907 km² and a total population of 63,533 (2005). The new municipality belongs to Region Sjælland (Region Zealand).

==Transport and Infrastructure==

The town is served by Sakskøbing railway station, located on Lollandsbanen, a railway line between and , which is operated by the railway company Lokaltog A/S since 2015.

Sakskøbing is located on European route E47 connecting Lübeck in Germany to Helsingborg in Sweden via Copenhagen, as well as the Danish national road 9 connecting Odense on Funen to Nykøbing Falster on Falster by way of Funen, Langeland and Lolland.

Lolland Falster Airport is located south of Sakskøbing between the towns of Holeby and Rødby.

<doc id="148621" wikidata="Q503153" url="?curid=148621" title="Stevns Municipality">
<text>Stevns Municipality () is a &quot;kommune&quot; in the Region Sjælland on the southeast coast of the island of Zealand in south Denmark. The municipality covers an area of , and has a population of 23,649 (1 January 2024). The municipality covers most of Stevns Peninsula.

The third largest town and the site of its municipal council is the town of Hårlev.

On 1 January 2007 Stevns municipality, as the result of &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipal Reform&quot; of 2007), merged with Vallø municipality to form an enlarged Stevns municipality.

== Locations ==
The ten largest locations in the municipality are:

===The town of Store Heddinge ===

The town of Store Heddinge came into existence during the 13th century, and Saint Katharina Church (&quot;Sct. Katharina kirke&quot;) is also from that time. The town received privileged status as a merchant town in 1441. A Latin preparatory school was founded in the town in 1620, but was closed down in 1739.

==Politics==

===Municipal council===
Stevns&#x27; municipal council consists of 19 members, elected every four years.

Below are the municipal councils elected since the Municipal Reform of 2007.

==Attractions==

The area is known for its white chalk cliffs, which are quite rare in Denmark. Stevns Klint (Stevns&#x27; Cliffs), a popular tourist attraction, is one of these. The old town church by the small village of Højerup collapsed partially over the cliffs in 1928 due to erosion.

The cliffs at Højerup are also the place where the father-and-son team of scientists Luis and Walter Alvarez measured the highest level of iridium in the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary layer, which led them to propose their hypothesis that the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event was caused by an impact of a large asteroid 66 million years ago.

By 2014 Stevns Klint was listed on UNESCO List of World Heritage Sites in Northern Europe.

In 2008 the Cold War Museum Stevns Fortress opened to the public. It features a large exhibition of military equipment and a 1.5-hour guided tour in the large underground system of the fortress. The underground system of the fortress features of tunnels, living quarters, command centers, hospital and even a chapel. And in addition two ammunition depots for its two cannons. The tunnels are below surface excavated in the chalk of Stevns. This top secret fortress was built in 1953 and remained operational until 2000.

Stevns is also home to Elverhøj (Elves&#x27; Hill), while not much of an attraction, it is famous for the fairy tale The Elf Mound by H.C. Andersen and the Danish national play Elves&#x27; Hill, both of which in Danish share the name &quot;Elverhøj&quot;.

<text>Donald Henry Pleasence (; 5 October 1919 – 2 February 1995) was an English actor. He began his career on stage in the West End before having a screen career, which included starring in a 1954 BBC adaptation of George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, before playing numerous supporting and character roles in films including RAF Flight Lieutenant Colin Blythe in &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1963), the villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld in the James Bond film &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1967), SEN 5241 in &quot;THX 1138&quot; (1971), and the deranged Clarence &quot;Doc&quot; Tydon in &quot;Wake in Fright&quot; (1971).

Pleasence starred as psychiatrist Dr. Samuel Loomis in &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978) and four of its sequels, a role for which he was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Actor. The series&#x27; popularity and critical success led to a resurgent career for Pleasence, who appeared in numerous American and European-produced horror and thriller films. He collaborated with &quot;Halloween&quot; director John Carpenter twice more, as the President of the United States in &quot;Escape from New York&quot; (1981) and as the Priest in &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; (1987).

==Early life==
Pleasence was born in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, the son of Alice (née Armitage) and Thomas Stanley Pleasence, a railway station master. His grandfather was a railwayman, who lived at Portland Place in Worksop, where Donald developed an interest in cricket.

He received his formal education at Crosby Junior School, known as Doncaster Road School, in Scunthorpe. He lived at 111 Frodingham Road for nine years. Aged seven he took part in his first play, in Scunthorpe called &quot;Passers By&quot;.

He was brought up as a strict Methodist in the small village of Grimoldby, Lincolnshire, from the age of nine. With his older brother Ralph, both went to Eastfield Road school in Louth. He was in the local Scouts, the 4th United Methodist in Louth.
He produced the school Christmas concert, in Louth, in his early teens.

His father was the stationmaster at Grimoldby railway station for five years, on the Mablethorpe loop railway. His parents were in the temperance society, as they were Methodists, and his mother was in the Grimoldby and Manby WI.

By early 1934 he had moved from Lincolnshire, where his father had been the LNER stationmaster from around early 1929. His father was the stationmaster at Ecclesfield. His father would die aged 77 in around 1965, after moving to Teddington in the late 1950s.

He found his way into grammar school, at Ecclesfield Grammar School in Sheffield, which he said changed his life. Mr Clay was head of English, and with the headmaster, encouraged him, saying &#x27;I owe virtually everything to them&#x27;. He developed his acting in Mr Clay&#x27;s &#x27;Wednesday Club&#x27; drama society. He has said that he was good at English but &#x27;not much else&#x27;. Donald&#x27;s father asked the headmaster to persuade his son to not choose to be an actor. A class friend Sam Hemingfield, would become a teacher, and later head of the sixth form at Ecclesfield School. Another friend was John Bertram, who would become a teacher, and head of English at Bradfield School.

For eighteen months he worked as a booking clerk at Swinton railway station, with LNER and decided that he wanted to be a professional actor, taking up a placement with the Jersey Repertory Company in 1939. His first professional play at the Playhouse, in Jersey in July 1939 was as assistant stage manager with the Kent-Naismith Rep Company, where he played Hareton Earnshaw in Wuthering Heights.

Until 1941, he worked in rep. Until leaving rep, he had a rebellious nature, and often upset theater directors and managers, leading to him being dismissed.

==Second World War==
In December 1939, Pleasence initially refused conscription into the British Armed Forces, registering as a conscientious objector, but changed his stance in autumn 1940, after the attacks upon London by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, and volunteered with the Royal Air Force. He served as aircraft wireless-operator with No. 166 Squadron in Bomber Command, with which he flew almost sixty raids against the Axis Powers over occupied Europe.

On 31 August 1944, his Lancaster NE112 was shot down during an attack on Agenville, France, and he was captured and imprisoned in the German prisoner-of-war camp Stalag Luft I. Pleasence produced and acted in many plays for the entertainment of his fellow captives.

After the war and his release, he was discharged from the RAF in 1946.

==Acting career==
Returning to acting after the war, Pleasence resumed working in repertory theatre companies in Birmingham and Bristol. 

His first production was &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, where he played the interrogator Mavriky, when one of the actors was ill at the Lyric Theatre (Hammersmith). It was his first &#x27;unpleasant&#x27; acting role. He joined Birmingham Rep, where stayed for two years, then the Bristol Old Vic. He toured the US in 1950.

In the 1950s, Pleasence&#x27;s stage work included performing as Willie Mossop in a 1952 production of &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot; at the Arts Theatre, London and as Dauphin in Jean Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;The Lark&quot; (1956). In 1960, Pleasence gained excellent notices as the tramp in Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Caretaker&quot; at the Arts Theatre, a role he would again play in a 1990 revival. Other stage work in the 1960s included Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;Poor Bitos&quot; (1963–64) and Robert Shaw&#x27;s &quot;The Man in the Glass Booth&quot; (1967), for which he won the London Variety Award for Stage Actor of the Year in 1968. Pleasence&#x27;s later stage work included performing in a double bill of Pinter plays, &quot;The Basement&quot; and &quot;Tea Party&quot;, at the Duchess Theatre in 1970.

===Television===
Pleasence made his television debut in &quot;I Want to Be a Doctor&quot; (1946). He received positive critical attention for his role as Syme in the BBC version of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1954) from the novel by George Orwell. The adaptation was by Nigel Kneale and featured Peter Cushing in the lead role of Winston Smith.

Pleasence played Prince John in several episodes of the ITV series &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1956–1958). He appeared twice with Patrick McGoohan in the British spy series, &quot;Danger Man&quot;, in episodes &quot;Position of Trust&quot; (1960) and &quot;Find and Return&quot; (1961). Pleasence&#x27;s first appearance in America was in an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, playing an aging teacher at a boys&#x27; school in the episode &quot;The Changing of the Guard&quot; (1962). In 1963, he appeared in an episode of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; titled &quot;The Man with the Power&quot;. In 1966, he also guest starred in an episode of &quot;The Fugitive&quot; entitled &quot;With Strings Attached&quot;.

In 1973, Pleasence played a sympathetic murderer in an episode of &quot;Columbo&quot; entitled &quot;Any Old Port in a Storm&quot;. Also that year, he played a supporting role in David Winters&#x27; musical television adaptation of &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;.

He also portrayed a murderer captured by &quot;Mrs. Columbo&quot; in &quot;Murder Is a Parlor Game&quot; (1979). In 1978, he played a scout, Sam Purchas in an adaptation of James A. Michener&#x27;s &quot;Centennial&quot;. Pleasence starred as the Reverend Septimus Harding in the BBC&#x27;s TV series &quot;The Barchester Chronicles&quot; (1982). In this series, his daughter Angela Pleasence played his onscreen daughter Susan.

He hosted the 1981 Halloween episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; with music guest Fear.

In 1986, Pleasence joined Ronald Lacey and Polly Jo Pleasence for the television thriller &quot;Into the Darkness&quot;.

Pleasence and Michael Nader portrayed the villains in 1988&#x27;s &quot;The Great Escape II: The Untold Story&quot;, which costar Christopher Reeve explained as not being a remake of the 1963 original film and being based on Paul Brickhill&#x27;s non-fiction account &quot;The Great Escape&quot;. Noting his involvement in the original film, Joan Hanauer wrote that Pleasence had &quot;graduated to an S.S. villain, and he is a marvel of soft-spoken, almost finicky evil.&quot;

===Film===

Pleasence made his big-screen debut with &quot;The Beachcomber&quot; (1954). Some notable early roles include Parsons in &quot;1984&quot; (1956), and minor roles opposite Alec Guinness in &quot;Barnacle Bill&quot; (1957) and Dirk Bogarde in &quot;The Wind Cannot Read&quot; (1958). In Tony Richardson&#x27;s film of &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; (1959), he plays a vindictive market inspector opposite Richard Burton. In the same year, Pleasence starred in the horror films &quot;Circus of Horrors&quot; directed by Sidney Hayers, playing the role of Vanet, the owner of a circus, and &quot;The Flesh and the Fiends&quot; as the real-life murderer William Hare, alongside Peter Cushing, George Rose and Billie Whitelaw.

Endowed with a bald head, a penetrating stare, and an intense voice, usually quiet but capable of a piercing scream, he specialised in portraying insane, fanatical, or evil characters, including the title role in &quot;Dr Crippen&quot; (1962), the frontier prophet Oracle Jones in &quot;Hallelujah Trail&quot;, the double agent Dr Michaels in the science-fiction film &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; (1966), the white trader who sells guns to the Cheyenne Indians in the revisionist western &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; (1970), the mad German psychoanalyst with Bud Spencer–Terence Hill in &quot;Watch Out, We&#x27;re Mad!&quot; (1974), Nazi leader Heinrich Himmler in &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot; (1976), and the Bond arch-villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1967), the first film in which Blofeld&#x27;s face is clearly seen. His interpretation of the character has become predominant in popular culture considering the popularity of the comic villain, Dr. Evil in the successful &quot;Austin Powers&quot; film series, which primarily parodies it. In the crime drama &quot;Hell is a City&quot; (1960), shot in Manchester, he starred opposite Stanley Baker, while he was memorably cast in the horror comedy &quot;What a Carve Up!&quot; (1961) as the &quot;horrible-looking zombie&quot; solicitor opposite Shirley Eaton, Sid James, Kenneth Connor and Dennis Price.

He appeared as the mild-mannered and good-natured POW forger Colin Blythe in the film &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1963), who discovers that he is slowly going blind, but nonetheless participates in the mass break-out, only to be shot down by German soldiers because he is unable to see them. &quot;Variety&quot; highlighted Pleasence and Richard Attenborough as giving some of the better performances in the film, Pleasence specifically being praised for having the most moving portrayal and depicting &quot;the film&#x27;s most touching character.&quot; In &quot;The Night of the Generals&quot; (1967), he played another uncharacteristically sympathetic role, this time as an old-school German general involved in a plot to kill Adolf Hitler. In 1971, he returned to the realm of the deranged, delivering a &quot;tour de force&quot; performance in the role of an alcoholic Australian doctor in Ted Kotcheff&#x27;s nightmarish outback drama &quot;Wake in Fright&quot;.

Pleasence played Lucifer in the religious epic &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965). He was one of many stars who were given cameos throughout the film.

He also acted in Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Cul-de-sac&quot; (1966), in which he portrayed the love-sodden husband of a much younger French wife (Françoise Dorléac). He ventured successfully into American cowboy territory, playing a sadistic self-styled preacher who goes after stoic Charlton Heston in the Western &quot;Will Penny&quot; (1968).

He portrayed SEN 5241 in &quot;THX 1138&quot; (1971), opposite Robert Duvall which was the directorial debut of George Lucas. The next year he appeared as an eccentric, tea-obsessed police inspector in the cult horror film &quot;Death Line&quot; alongside Norman Rossington and Christopher Lee. A few years later, he portrayed antagonist Lucas Deranian, in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Escape to Witch Mountain&quot; (1975) and, in &quot;Telefon&quot; (1977), Nicolai Dalchimsky, the Russian seeking to start a war between the United States and the Soviet Union.

Pleasence appeared as Dr. Samuel Loomis in John Carpenter&#x27;s horror film &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978). The film was a major success and was considered the highest grossing independent film of its time, earning accolades as a classic of the horror genre. He also played the teacher, Kantorek in &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1979), Dr. Kobras in &quot;The Pumaman&quot; (1980) and the held-hostage President of the United States in &quot;Escape from New York&quot; (1981). The rather sinister accent which Pleasence employed in this and other films may be credited to the elocution lessons he had as a child. He reprised his Dr. Sam Loomis role in &quot;Halloween II&quot; (1981), &quot;Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers&quot; (1988), &quot;Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers&quot; (1989) and &quot;&quot; (1995).

Pleasence, Daria Nicolodi, and Jennifer Connelly starred in Dario Argento&#x27;s &quot;Phenomena&quot; (1985), where Pleasence portrayed a wheelchair-using forensic entomologist. Although Austin Trunick of &quot;Under the Radar&quot; criticized Connelly for not being an active heroine, he cited &quot;a lot of nice interaction between Connelly and Pleasence&#x27;s eccentric character&quot; as a positive tradeoff. Later that year, Pleasence played a retiring inspector who investigates the disappearance of the sister of Tom Schanley&#x27;s character in &quot;Nothing Underneath&quot;.
JA Kerswell called Pleasence&#x27;s role &quot;clichéd&quot; for the actor while also praising his presence as &quot;a welcome bonus.&quot; The reviewer from Horror Society wrote of liking Schanley and Pleasence &quot;but the story is the main focus here and not the cast which is a bit of a shame because both did fantastic jobs.&quot; &quot;Operation Nam&quot; was Pleasence&#x27;s sole film appearance in 1986, playing &quot;a minor part as a priest&quot; who services Vietnam soldiers.

Pleasence collaborated with Carpenter again when he starred in &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; (1987), where he played a priest who seeks the aid of a professor and a few of the latter&#x27;s quantum physics students to uncover the mystery of a glowing liquid in a canister. Though mixed about the film, &quot;Starburst&quot; praised Pleasence&#x27;s performance, admitting that to them, &quot;there are very few sights in genre cinema as marvelous as seeing Pleasence delivering an intense, slightly erratic monologue, and he gets plenty to sink his teeth into here.&quot; Megan Summers asserted that Pleasence brought &quot;his standard emotional prowess and psychological stability to his role&quot; in the film, and Michael Wilmington declared Pleasence and Victor Wong as &quot;both fine; these two know how to make the most of shallow excess.&quot;

Pleasence admired Sir Laurence Olivier, with whom he worked on-stage in the 1950s, and later on the film version of &quot;Dracula&quot; (1979). Two years earlier, Pleasence did an amusingly broad impersonation of Olivier in the guise of a horror-film actor called &quot;Valentine De&#x27;ath&quot; in the film &quot;The Uncanny&quot; (1977). According to the film critic Kim Newman on a DVD commentary for &quot;Halloween II&quot;, the reason for Pleasence&#x27;s lengthy filmography was that he never turned down any role that was offered.

===Spoken records and voice-overs===
During the early 1960s, Pleasence recorded several children&#x27;s-story records on the Atlas Record label. These were marketed as the Talespinners series in the United Kingdom. They were also released in the United States as Tale Spinners for Children by United Artists. The stories included &quot;Don Quixote&quot; and the &quot;Brave Little Tailor&quot;. He also wrote, directed and narrated &quot;Scouse the Mouse&quot; in 1977.

Pleasence provided the voice-over for the British public information film, &quot;The Spirit of Dark and Lonely Water&quot; (1973). The film, intended to warn children of the dangers of playing near water, attained notoriety for allegedly giving children nightmares.

===Books===
Pleasence was the author of the children&#x27;s book &quot;Scouse the Mouse&quot; (1977) (London: New English Library), which was animated by Canadian animator/film director Gerald Potterton (a friend of the actor, who directed him in the Canadian film &quot;The Rainbow Boys&quot; (1973), retitled &quot;The Rainbow Gang&quot; for VHS release in the United States) and also adapted into a children&#x27;s recording (Polydor Records, 1977) with Ringo Starr voicing the book&#x27;s title character, Scouse the Mouse.

In his book &quot;British Film Character Actors&quot; (1982), Terence Pettigrew describes Pleasence as &quot;a potent combination of eyes and voice. The eyes are mournful but they can also be sinister or seedy or just plain nutty. He has the kind of piercing stare which lifts enamel off saucepans.&quot;

==Awards==
Pleasence was nominated four times for the Tony Award for best performance by a leading actor in a Broadway play: in 1962 for Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Caretaker&quot;, in 1965 for Jean Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;Poor Bitos&quot;, in 1969 for Robert Shaw&#x27;s &quot;The Man in the Glass Booth&quot;, and in 1972 for Simon Gray&#x27;s &quot;Wise Child&quot;.

Pleasence was appointed an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for his services to the acting profession by Queen Elizabeth II in 1994.

==Personal life==
Pleasence married four times and had five daughters from his first three marriages. He had Angela and Jean with Miriam Raymond (m. 1941–1958); Lucy and Polly with Josephine Martin Crombie (m. 1959–1970); and Miranda with Meira Shore (m. 1970–1988). His last marriage was to Linda Kentwood (m. 1988–1995; his death).

In the late 1970s, he lived near the eastern side of Kew Bridge. In the early 1960s his brother Ralph was stationmaster at Smeeth Road railway station. Ralph had retired to Lincoln in the 1970s.

He lived in the south of France for a number of years, up until his death.

==Death==
On 2 February 1995, Pleasence died at age 75 at his home in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France, from complications of heart failure following heart valve replacement surgery. His body was cremated.

==Legacy==
The 1995 film &quot;&quot; was dedicated to Donald Pleasence. The 1998 film &quot;Halloween H20: 20 Years Later&quot; also features a dedication to Pleasence in the end credits, with voice actor Tom Kane providing a voice-over for Loomis in the film. In the 2018 film, &quot;Halloween&quot;, comedian Colin Mahan voiced Loomis. In the 2021 film &quot;Halloween Kills&quot; Tom Jones, Jr. played Loomis, wearing prosthetic make-up to resemble Pleasence. Loomis&#x27; voice was again provided by Mahan.

Dr. Evil, the character played by Mike Myers in the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; comedy films (1997–2002), and Doctor Claw from &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; are parodies of Pleasence&#x27;s performance as Blofeld in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;.

<text>Value at risk (VaR) is a measure of the risk of loss of investment/capital. It estimates how much a set of investments might lose (with a given probability), given normal market conditions, in a set time period such as a day. VaR is typically used by firms and regulators in the financial industry to gauge the amount of assets needed to cover possible losses.

For a given portfolio, time horizon, and probability &quot;p&quot;, the &quot;p&quot; VaR can be defined informally as the maximum possible loss during that time after excluding all worse outcomes whose combined probability is at most &quot;p&quot;. This assumes mark-to-market pricing, and no trading in the portfolio.

For example, if a portfolio of stocks has a one-day 5% VaR of $1 million, that means that there is a 0.05 probability that the portfolio will fall in value by more than $1 million over a one-day period if there is no trading. Informally, a loss of $1 million or more on this portfolio is expected on 1 day out of 20 days (because of 5% probability).

More formally, &quot;p&quot; VaR is defined such that the probability of a loss greater than VaR is (at most) &quot;(1-p)&quot; while the probability of a loss less than VaR is (at least) &quot;p&quot;. A loss which exceeds the VaR threshold is termed a &quot;VaR breach&quot;.

For a fixed &quot;p&quot;, the &quot;p&quot; VaR does not assess the magnitude of loss when a VaR breach occurs and therefore is considered by some to be a questionable metric for risk management. For instance, assume someone makes a bet that flipping a coin seven times will not give seven heads. The terms are that they win $100 if this does not happen (with probability 127/128) and lose $12,700 if it does (with probability 1/128). That is, the possible loss amounts are $0 or $12,700. The 1% VaR is then $0, because the probability of any loss at all is 1/128 which is less than 1%. They are, however, exposed to a possible loss of $12,700 which can be expressed as the &quot;p&quot; VaR for any &quot;p ≤ 0.78125% (1/128)&quot;.

VaR has four main uses in finance: risk management, financial control, financial reporting and computing regulatory capital. VaR is sometimes used in non-financial applications as well. However, it is a controversial risk management tool.

Important related ideas are economic capital, backtesting, stress testing, expected shortfall, and tail conditional expectation.

== Details ==

Common parameters for VaR are 1% and 5% probabilities and one day and two week horizons, although other combinations are in use.

The reason for assuming normal markets and no trading, and to restricting loss to things measured in daily accounts, is to make the loss observable. In some extreme financial events it can be impossible to determine losses, either because market prices are unavailable or because the loss-bearing institution breaks up. Some longer-term consequences of disasters, such as lawsuits, loss of market confidence and employee morale and impairment of brand names can take a long time to play out, and may be hard to allocate among specific prior decisions. VaR marks the boundary between normal days and extreme events. Institutions can lose far more than the VaR amount; all that can be said is that they will not do so very often.

The probability level is about equally often specified as one minus the probability of a VaR break, so that the VaR in the example above would be called a one-day 95% VaR instead of one-day 5% VaR. This generally does not lead to confusion because the probability of VaR breaks is almost always small, certainly less than 50%.

Although it virtually always represents a loss, VaR is conventionally reported as a positive number. A negative VaR would imply the portfolio has a high probability of making a profit, for example a one-day 5% VaR of negative implies the portfolio has a 95% chance of making more than over the next day.

Another inconsistency is that VaR is sometimes taken to refer to profit-and-loss at the end of the period, and sometimes as the maximum loss at any point during the period. The original definition was the latter, but in the early 1990s when VaR was aggregated across trading desks and time zones, end-of-day valuation was the only reliable number so the former became the &quot;de facto&quot; definition. As people began using multiday VaRs in the second half of the 1990s, they almost always estimated the distribution at the end of the period only. It is also easier theoretically to deal with a point-in-time estimate versus a maximum over an interval. Therefore, the end-of-period definition is the most common both in theory and practice today.

== Varieties ==

The definition of VaR is nonconstructive; it specifies a property VaR must have, but not how to compute VaR. Moreover, there is wide scope for interpretation in the definition. This has led to two broad types of VaR, one used primarily in risk management and the other primarily for risk measurement. The distinction is not sharp, however, and hybrid versions are typically used in financial control, financial reporting and computing regulatory capital.

To a risk manager, VaR is a system, not a number. The system is run periodically (usually daily) and the published number is compared to the computed price movement in opening positions over the time horizon. There is never any subsequent adjustment to the published VaR, and there is no distinction between VaR breaks caused by input errors (including IT breakdowns, fraud and rogue trading), computation errors (including failure to produce a VaR on time) and market movements.

A frequentist claim is made that the long-term frequency of VaR breaks will equal the specified probability, within the limits of sampling error, and that the VaR breaks will be independent in time and independent of the level of VaR. This claim is validated by a backtest, a comparison of published VaRs to actual price movements. In this interpretation, many different systems could produce VaRs with equally good backtests, but wide disagreements on daily VaR values.

For risk measurement a number is needed, not a system. A Bayesian probability claim is made that given the information and beliefs at the time, the subjective probability of a VaR break was the specified level. VaR is adjusted after the fact to correct errors in inputs and computation, but not to incorporate information unavailable at the time of computation. In this context, &quot;backtest&quot; has a different meaning. Rather than comparing published VaRs to actual market movements over the period of time the system has been in operation, VaR is retroactively computed on scrubbed data over as long a period as data are available and deemed relevant. The same position data and pricing models are used for computing the VaR as determining the price movements.

Although some of the sources listed here treat only one kind of VaR as legitimate, most of the recent ones seem to agree that risk management VaR is superior for making short-term and tactical decisions in the present, while risk measurement VaR should be used for understanding the past, and making medium term and strategic decisions for the future. When VaR is used for financial control or financial reporting it should incorporate elements of both. For example, if a trading desk is held to a VaR limit, that is both a risk-management rule for deciding what risks to allow today, and an input into the risk measurement computation of the desk&#x27;s risk-adjusted return at the end of the reporting period.

=== In governance ===
VaR can also be applied to governance of endowments, trusts, and pension plans. Essentially, trustees adopt portfolio Values-at-Risk metrics for the entire pooled account and the diversified parts individually managed. Instead of probability estimates they simply define maximum levels of acceptable loss for each. Doing so provides an easy metric for oversight and adds accountability as managers are then directed to manage, but with the additional constraint to avoid losses within a defined risk parameter. VaR utilized in this manner adds relevance as well as an easy way to monitor risk measurement control far more intuitive than Standard Deviation of Return. Use of VaR in this context, as well as a worthwhile critique on board governance practices as it relates to investment management oversight in general can be found in &quot;Best Practices in Governance.&quot;

== Mathematical definition ==

Let formula_1 be a profit and loss distribution (loss negative and profit positive). The VaR at level formula_2 is the smallest number formula_3 such that the probability that formula_4 does not exceed formula_3 is at least formula_6. Mathematically, formula_7 is the formula_8-quantile of formula_9, i.e.,

:formula_10

This is the most general definition of VaR and the two identities are equivalent (indeed, for any real random variable formula_1 its cumulative distribution function formula_12 is well defined). 
However this formula cannot be used directly for calculations unless we assume that formula_1 has some parametric distribution.

Risk managers typically assume that some fraction of the bad events will have undefined losses, either because markets are closed or illiquid, or because the entity bearing the loss breaks apart or loses the ability to compute accounts. Therefore, they do not accept results based on the assumption of a well-defined probability distribution. Nassim Taleb has labeled this assumption, &quot;charlatanism&quot;. On the other hand, many academics prefer to assume a well-defined distribution, albeit usually one with fat tails. This point has probably caused more contention among VaR theorists than any other.

Value at risk can also be written as a distortion risk measure given by the distortion function formula_14

== Risk measure and risk metric ==

The term &quot;VaR&quot; is used both for a risk measure and a risk metric. This sometimes leads to confusion. Sources earlier than 1995 usually emphasize the risk measure, later sources are more likely to emphasize the metric.

The VaR risk measure defines risk as mark-to-market loss on a fixed portfolio over a fixed time horizon. There are many alternative risk measures in finance. Given the inability to use mark-to-market (which uses market prices to define loss) for future performance, loss is often defined (as a substitute) as change in fundamental value. For example, if an institution holds a loan that declines in market price because interest rates go up, but has no change in cash flows or credit quality, some systems do not recognize a loss. Also some try to incorporate the economic cost of harm not measured in daily financial statements, such as loss of market confidence or employee morale, impairment of brand names or lawsuits.

Rather than assuming a static portfolio over a fixed time horizon, some risk measures incorporate the dynamic effect of expected trading (such as a stop loss order) and consider the expected holding period of positions.

The VaR risk metric summarizes the distribution of possible losses by a quantile, a point with a specified probability of greater losses. A common alternative metric is expected shortfall.

== VaR risk management ==

Supporters of VaR-based risk management claim the first and possibly greatest benefit of VaR is the improvement in systems and modeling it forces on an institution. In 1997, Philippe Jorion wrote:[T]he greatest benefit of VAR lies in the imposition of a structured methodology for critically thinking about risk. Institutions that go through the process of computing their VAR are forced to confront their exposure to financial risks and to set up a proper risk management function. Thus the process of getting to VAR may be as important as the number itself.

Publishing a daily number, on-time and with specified statistical properties holds every part of a trading organization to a high objective standard. Robust backup systems and default assumptions must be implemented. Positions that are reported, modeled or priced incorrectly stand out, as do data feeds that are inaccurate or late and systems that are too-frequently down. Anything that affects profit and loss that is left out of other reports will show up either in inflated VaR or excessive VaR breaks. &quot;A risk-taking institution that &quot;does not&quot; compute VaR might escape disaster, but an institution that &quot;cannot&quot; compute VaR will not.&quot;

The second claimed benefit of VaR is that it separates risk into two regimes. Inside the VaR limit, conventional statistical methods are reliable. Relatively short-term and specific data can be used for analysis. Probability estimates are meaningful because there are enough data to test them. In a sense, there is no true risk because these are a sum of many independent observations with a left bound on the outcome. For example, a casino does not worry about whether red or black will come up on the next roulette spin. Risk managers encourage productive risk-taking in this regime, because there is little true cost. People tend to worry too much about these risks because they happen frequently, and not enough about what might happen on the worst days.

Outside the VaR limit, all bets are off. Risk should be analyzed with stress testing based on long-term and broad market data. Probability statements are no longer meaningful. Knowing the distribution of losses beyond the VaR point is both impossible and useless. The risk manager should concentrate instead on making sure good plans are in place to limit the loss if possible, and to survive the loss if not.

One specific system uses three regimes.

# One to three times VaR are normal occurrences. Periodic VaR breaks are expected. The loss distribution typically has fat tails, and there might be more than one break in a short period of time. Moreover, markets may be abnormal and trading may exacerbate losses, and losses taken may not be measured in daily marks, such as lawsuits, loss of employee morale and market confidence and impairment of brand names. An institution that cannot deal with three times VaR losses as routine events probably will not survive long enough to put a VaR system in place.
# Three to ten times VaR is the range for stress testing. Institutions should be confident they have examined all the foreseeable events that will cause losses in this range, and are prepared to survive them. These events are too rare to estimate probabilities reliably, so risk/return calculations are useless.
# Foreseeable events should not cause losses beyond ten times VaR. If they do they should be hedged or insured, or the business plan should be changed to avoid them, or VaR should be increased. It is hard to run a business if foreseeable losses are orders of magnitude larger than very large everyday losses. It is hard to plan for these events because they are out of scale with daily experience.

Another reason VaR is useful as a metric is due to its ability to compress the riskiness of a portfolio to a single number, making it comparable across different portfolios (of different assets). Within any portfolio it is also possible to isolate specific positions that might better hedge the portfolio to reduce, and minimise, the VaR.

== Computation methods ==

VaR can be estimated either parametrically (for example, variance-covariance VaR or delta-gamma VaR) or nonparametrically (for examples, historical simulation VaR or resampled VaR). Nonparametric methods of VaR estimation are discussed in Markovich and Novak. A comparison of a number of strategies for VaR prediction is given in Kuester et al.

A McKinsey report published in May 2012 estimated that 85% of large banks were using historical simulation. The other 15% used Monte Carlo methods (often applying a PCA decomposition) .

== Backtesting ==
Backtesting is the process to determine the accuracy of VaR forecasts vs. actual portfolio profit and losses.
A key advantage to VaR over most other measures of risk such as expected shortfall is the availability of several backtesting procedures for validating a set of VaR forecasts. Early examples of backtests can be found in Christoffersen (1998), later generalized by Pajhede (2017), which models a &quot;hit-sequence&quot; of losses greater than the VaR and proceed to tests for these &quot;hits&quot; to be independent from one another and with a correct probability of occurring. E.g. a 5% probability of a loss greater than VaR should be observed over time when using a 95% VaR, these hits should occur independently.

A number of other backtests are available which model the time between hits in the hit-sequence, see Christoffersen and Pelletier (2004), Haas (2006), Tokpavi et al. (2014). and Pajhede (2017) As pointed out in several of the papers, the asymptotic distribution is often poor when considering high levels of coverage, e.g. a 99% VaR, therefore the parametric bootstrap method of Dufour (2006) is often used to obtain correct size properties for the tests. Backtest toolboxes are available in Matlab, or R—though only the first implements the parametric bootstrap method.

The second pillar of Basel II includes a backtesting step to validate the VaR figures.

== History ==

The problem of risk measurement is an old one in statistics, economics and finance. Financial risk management has been a concern of regulators and financial executives for a long time as well. Retrospective analysis has found some VaR-like concepts in this history. But VaR did not emerge as a distinct concept until the late 1980s. The triggering event was the stock market crash of 1987. This was the first major financial crisis in which a lot of academically-trained quants were in high enough positions to worry about firm-wide survival.

The crash was so unlikely given standard statistical models, that it called the entire basis of quant finance into question. A reconsideration of history led some quants to decide there were recurring crises, about one or two per decade, that overwhelmed the statistical assumptions embedded in models used for trading, investment management and derivative pricing. These affected many markets at once, including ones that were usually not correlated, and seldom had discernible economic cause or warning (although after-the-fact explanations were plentiful). Much later, they were named &quot;Black Swans&quot; by Nassim Taleb and the concept extended far beyond finance.

If these events were included in quantitative analysis they dominated results and led to strategies that did not work day to day. If these events were excluded, the profits made in between &quot;Black Swans&quot; could be much smaller than the losses suffered in the crisis. Institutions could fail as a result.

VaR was developed as a systematic way to segregate extreme events, which are studied qualitatively over long-term history and broad market events, from everyday price movements, which are studied quantitatively using short-term data in specific markets. It was hoped that &quot;Black Swans&quot; would be preceded by increases in estimated VaR or increased frequency of VaR breaks, in at least some markets. The extent to which this has proven to be true is controversial.

Abnormal markets and trading were excluded from the VaR estimate in order to make it observable. It is not always possible to define loss if, for example, markets are closed as after 9/11, or severely illiquid, as happened several times in 2008. Losses can also be hard to define if the risk-bearing institution fails or breaks up. A measure that depends on traders taking certain actions, and avoiding other actions, can lead to self reference.

This is risk management VaR. It was well established in quantitative trading groups at several financial institutions, notably Bankers Trust, before 1990, although neither the name nor the definition had been standardized. There was no effort to aggregate VaRs across trading desks.

The financial events of the early 1990s found many firms in trouble because the same underlying bet had been made at many places in the firm, in non-obvious ways. Since many trading desks already computed risk management VaR, and it was the only common risk measure that could be both defined for all businesses and aggregated without strong assumptions, it was the natural choice for reporting firmwide risk. J. P. Morgan CEO Dennis Weatherstone famously called for a &quot;4:15 report&quot; that combined all firm risk on one page, available within 15 minutes of the market close.

Risk measurement VaR was developed for this purpose. Development was most extensive at J. P. Morgan, which published the methodology and gave free access to estimates of the necessary underlying parameters in 1994. This was the first time VaR had been exposed beyond a relatively small group of quants. Two years later, the methodology was spun off into an independent for-profit business now part of RiskMetrics Group (now part of MSCI).

In 1997, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that public corporations must disclose quantitative information about their derivatives activity. Major banks and dealers chose to implement the rule by including VaR information in the notes to their financial statements.

Worldwide adoption of the Basel II Accord, beginning in 1999 and nearing completion today, gave further impetus to the use of VaR. VaR is the preferred measure of market risk, and concepts similar to VaR are used in other parts of the accord.

== Criticism ==

VaR has been controversial since it moved from trading desks into the public eye in 1994. A famous 1997 debate between Nassim Taleb and Philippe Jorion set out some of the major points of contention. Taleb claimed VaR:

# Ignored 2,500 years of experience in favor of untested models built by non-traders
# Was charlatanism because it claimed to estimate the risks of rare events, which is impossible
# Gave false confidence
# Would be exploited by traders

In 2008 David Einhorn and Aaron Brown debated VaR in Global Association of Risk Professionals Review. Einhorn compared VaR to &quot;an airbag that works all the time, except when you have a car accident&quot;. He further charged that VaR:

# Led to excessive risk-taking and leverage at financial institutions
# Focused on the manageable risks near the center of the distribution and ignored the tails
# Created an incentive to take &quot;excessive but remote risks&quot;
# Was &quot;potentially catastrophic when its use creates a false sense of security among senior executives and watchdogs.&quot;

New York Times reporter Joe Nocera wrote an extensive piece Risk Mismanagement on January 4, 2009, discussing the role VaR played in the Financial crisis of 2007–2008. After interviewing risk managers (including several of the ones cited above) the article suggests that VaR was very useful to risk experts, but nevertheless exacerbated the crisis by giving false security to bank executives and regulators. A powerful tool for professional risk managers, VaR is portrayed as both easy to misunderstand, and dangerous when misunderstood.

Taleb in 2009 testified in Congress asking for the banning of VaR for a number of reasons. One was that tail risks are non-measurable. Another was that for anchoring reasons VaR leads to higher risk taking.

VaR is not subadditive: VaR of a combined portfolio can be larger than the sum of the VaRs of its components.

For example, the average bank branch in the United States is robbed about once every ten years. A single-branch bank has about 0.0004% chance of being robbed on a specific day, so the risk of robbery would not figure into one-day 1% VaR. It would not even be within an order of magnitude of that, so it is in the range where the institution should not worry about it, it should insure against it and take advice from insurers on precautions. The whole point of insurance is to aggregate risks that are beyond individual VaR limits, and bring them into a large enough portfolio to get statistical predictability. It does not pay for a one-branch bank to have a security expert on staff.

As institutions get more branches, the risk of a robbery on a specific day rises to within an order of magnitude of VaR. At that point it makes sense for the institution to run internal stress tests and analyze the risk itself. It will spend less on insurance and more on in-house expertise. For a very large banking institution, robberies are a routine daily occurrence. Losses are part of the daily VaR calculation, and tracked statistically rather than case-by-case. A sizable in-house security department is in charge of prevention and control, the general risk manager just tracks the loss like any other cost of doing business.
As portfolios or institutions get larger, specific risks change from low-probability/low-predictability/high-impact to statistically predictable losses of low individual impact. That means they move from the range of far outside VaR, to be insured, to near outside VaR, to be analyzed case-by-case, to inside VaR, to be treated statistically.

VaR is a static measure of risk. By definition, VaR is a particular characteristic of the probability distribution of the underlying (namely, VaR is essentially a quantile). For a dynamic measure of risk, see Novak, ch. 10.

There are common abuses of VaR:

# Assuming that plausible losses will be less than some multiple (often three) of VaR. Losses can be extremely large. 
# Reporting a VaR that has not passed a backtest. Regardless of how VaR is computed, it should have produced the correct number of breaks (within sampling error) in the past. A common violation of common sense is to estimate a VaR based on the unverified assumption that everything follows a multivariate normal distribution.

===VaR, CVaR, RVaR and EVaR===

The VaR is not a coherent risk measure since it violates the sub-additivity property, which is

:formula_15

However, it can be bounded by coherent risk measures like Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) or entropic value at risk (EVaR). 
CVaR is defined by average of VaR values for confidence levels between 0 and .

However VaR, unlike CVaR, has the property of being a robust statistic.
A related class of risk measures is the &#x27;Range Value at Risk&#x27; (RVaR), which is a robust version of CVaR.

For formula_16 (with formula_17 the set of all Borel measurable functions whose moment-generating function exists for all positive real values) we have

:formula_18

where

:formula_19

in which formula_20 is the moment-generating function of at . In the above equations the variable denotes the financial loss, rather than wealth as is typically the case.

<text>Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) is the practice of measuring the distance between the surfaces of the Earth and the Moon using laser ranging. The distance can be calculated from the round-trip time of laser light pulses travelling at the speed of light, which are reflected back to Earth by the Moon&#x27;s surface or by one of several retroreflectors installed on the Moon. Three were placed by the United States&#x27; Apollo program (11, 14, and 15), two by the Soviet Lunokhod 1 and 2 missions, and one by India&#x27;s Chandrayaan-3 mission.

Although it is possible to reflect light or radio waves directly from the Moon&#x27;s surface (a process known as EME), a much more precise range measurement can be made using retroreflectors, since because of their small size, the temporal spread in the reflected signal is much smaller and because the return will be more evenly reflected with less diffusion.

Laser ranging measurements can also be made with retroreflectors installed on Moon-orbiting satellites such as the LRO.

==History==

The first successful lunar ranging tests were carried out in 1962 when Louis Smullin and Giorgio Fiocco from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology succeeded in observing laser pulses reflected from the Moon&#x27;s surface using a laser with a 50J 0.5 millisecond pulse length. Similar measurements were obtained later the same year by a Soviet team at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory using a Q-switched ruby laser.

Shortly thereafter, Princeton University graduate student James Faller proposed placing optical reflectors on the Moon to improve the accuracy of the measurements. This was achieved following the installation of a retroreflector array on July 21, 1969 by the crew of Apollo 11. Two more retroreflector arrays were left by the Apollo 14 and Apollo 15 missions. Successful lunar laser range measurements to the retroreflectors were first reported on Aug. 1, 1969 by the 3.1 m telescope at Lick Observatory. Observations from Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories Lunar Ranging Observatory in Arizona, the Pic du Midi Observatory in France, the Tokyo Astronomical Observatory, and McDonald Observatory in Texas soon followed.

The uncrewed Soviet &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; and &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; rovers carried smaller arrays. Reflected signals were initially received from &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; by the Soviet Union up to 1974, but not by western observatories that did not have precise information about location. In 2010 NASA&#x27;s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter located the Lunokhod 1 rover on images and in April 2010 a team from University of California ranged the array. &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot; array continues to return signals to Earth. The Lunokhod arrays suffer from decreased performance in direct sunlight—a factor considered in reflector placement during the Apollo missions.

The Apollo 15 array is three times the size of the arrays left by the two earlier Apollo missions. Its size made it the target of three-quarters of the sample measurements taken in the first 25 years of the experiment. Improvements in technology since then have resulted in greater use of the smaller arrays, by sites such as the Côte d&#x27;Azur Observatory in Nice, France; and the Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation (APOLLO) at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico.

In the 2010s several new retroreflectors were planned. The MoonLIGHT reflector, which was to be placed by the private MX-1E lander, was designed to increase measurement accuracy up to 100 times over existing systems. MX-1E was set to launch in July 2020, however, as of February 2020, the launch of the MX-1E has been canceled. India&#x27;s Chandrayaan-3 lunar lander successfully placed a sixth reflector on the Moon in August 2023. MoonLIGHT will be launched in early 2024 with a Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) mission.

==Principle==
The distance to the Moon is calculated using the equation:
. Since the speed of light is a defined constant, conversion between distance and time of flight can be made without ambiguity.

To compute the lunar distance precisely, many factors must be considered in addition to the round-trip time of about 2.5 seconds. These factors include the location of the Moon in the sky, the relative motion of Earth and the Moon, Earth&#x27;s rotation, lunar libration, polar motion, weather, speed of light in various parts of air, propagation delay through Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, the location of the observing station and its motion due to crustal motion and tides, and relativistic effects. The distance continually changes for a number of reasons, but averages between the center of the Earth and the center of the Moon. The orbits of the Moon and planets are integrated numerically along with the orientation of the Moon called physical libration.

At the Moon&#x27;s surface, the beam is about wide and scientists liken the task of aiming the beam to using a rifle to hit a moving dime away. The reflected light is too weak to see with the human eye. Out of a pulse of 3×1017 photons aimed at the reflector, only about 15 are received back on Earth, even under good conditions. They can be identified as originating from the laser because the laser is highly monochromatic.

As of 2009, the distance to the Moon can be measured with millimeter precision. In a relative sense, this is one of the most precise distance measurements ever made, and is equivalent in accuracy to determining the distance between Los Angeles and New York to within the width of a human hair.

The table below presents a list of active and inactive Lunar Laser Ranging stations on Earth. 
== Data analysis ==
The Lunar Laser Ranging data is collected in order to extract numerical values for a number of parameters. Analyzing the range data involves dynamics, terrestrial geophysics, and lunar geophysics. The modeling problem involves two aspects: an accurate computation of the lunar orbit and lunar orientation, and an accurate model for the time of flight from an observing station to a retroreflector and back to the station. Modern Lunar Laser Ranging data can be fit with a 1 cm weighted rms residual.

* The center of Earth to center of Moon distance is computed by a program that numerically integrates the lunar and planetary orbits accounting for the gravitational attraction of the Sun, planets, and a selection of asteroids.
* The same program integrates the 3-axis orientation of the Moon called physical Libration.

The range model includes

* The position of the ranging station accounting for motion due to plate tectonics, Earth rotation, precession, nutation, and polar motion.
* Tides in the solid Earth and seasonal motion of the solid Earth with respect to its center of mass.
* Relativistic transformation of time and space coordinates from a frame moving with the station to a frame fixed with respect to the solar system center of mass. Lorentz contraction of the Earth is part of this transformation.
* Delay in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.
* Relativistic delay due to the gravity fields of the Sun, Earth, and Moon.
* The position of the retroreflector accounting for orientation of the Moon and solid-body tides.
* Lorentz contraction of the Moon.
* Thermal expansion and contraction of the retroreflector mounts.

For the terrestrial model, the IERS Conventions (2010) is a source of detailed information.

==Results==
Lunar laser ranging measurement data is available from the Paris Observatory Lunar Analysis Center, the International Laser Ranging Service archives, and the active stations. Some of the findings of this long-term experiment are:

=== Properties of the Moon ===
* The distance to the Moon can be measured with millimeter precision.
*The Moon is spiraling away from Earth at a rate of . This rate has been described as anomalously high.
*The fluid core of the Moon was detected from the effects of core/mantle boundary dissipation.
*The Moon has free physical librations that require one or more stimulating mechanisms. 
*Tidal dissipation in the Moon depends on tidal frequency. 
* The Moon probably has a liquid core of about 20% of the Moon&#x27;s radius. The radius of the lunar core-mantle boundary is determined as .
*The polar flattening of the lunar core-mantle boundary is determined as .
*The free core nutation of the Moon is determined as .
*Accurate locations for retroreflectors serve as reference points visible to orbiting spacecraft.

=== Gravitational physics ===
*Einstein&#x27;s theory of gravity (the general theory of relativity) predicts the Moon&#x27;s orbit to within the accuracy of the laser ranging measurements.
* Gauge freedom plays a major role in a correct physical interpretation of the relativistic effects in the Earth-Moon system observed with LLR technique.
* The likelihood of any Nordtvedt effect (a hypothetical differential acceleration of the Moon and Earth towards the Sun caused by their different degrees of compactness) has been ruled out to high precision, strongly supporting the strong equivalence principle.
* The universal force of gravity is very stable. The experiments have constrained the change in Newton&#x27;s gravitational constant &quot;G&quot; to a factor of per year.

<text>Blood diamonds (also called conflict diamonds, brown diamonds, hot diamonds, or red diamonds) are diamonds mined in a war zone and sold to finance an insurgency, an invading army&#x27;s war efforts, terrorism, or a warlord&#x27;s activity. The term is used to highlight the negative consequences of the diamond trade in certain areas, or to label an individual diamond as having come from such an area. Diamonds mined during the 20th–21st century civil wars in Angola, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and Guinea-Bissau have been given the label. The terms conflict resource or conflict minerals refers to analogous situations involving other natural resources. Blood diamonds can also be smuggled by organized crime syndicates so that they could be sold on the black market.

== Financing conflict ==
Philippe Le Billon describes the &#x27;conflict resources&#x27; argument resting on the suggestion that the most valuable resources, if available to the weaker force in a conflict, can &#x27;motivate&#x27; and serve to sustain it. Commodity prices on global markets, however, are not an adequate proxy for the economic value of a natural resource to participants in armed conflict. Critical factors include location, mode of production, and subsequent route to market. Gemstones are exceptionally light and small in relation to their value as observed by Richard Auty who presents the stark contrast – tens of thousands of times the price per kilogram – of diamonds compared to other resources and consequently how &#x27;lootable&#x27; they are.

Deep mining for gold, kimberlite diamonds or other minerals requires the operation and maintenance of a capital-intensive facility; alluvial deposits by contrast, can be exploited cheaply using artisan tools for however long the relevant land is secured. Alluvial diamonds are therefore more easily exploited by rebels. These differences between primary and secondary diamonds in resource diffusion and cost of extraction are the basis for Lujana et al.&#x27;s rejection of non-resource based claims for Botswana and Sierra Leone&#x27;s different experience of stability and conflict, since both countries have extensive diamond resources but in different formations.

Despite efforts to frustrate the sale of resources emerging from conflicts, a notable workaround is the agreement of what Michael Ross terms &#x27;booty futures&#x27;, citing examples mostly from the 1990s concerning diamonds and oil from conflicts in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, the Congo Republic, and Democratic Republic of Congo. In these agreements, worth tens of millions of dollars, both rebels and government parties to conflict negotiate deals to realize value now from the prospect of resource exploitation in the future. This enables the presence of valuable natural resources to finance fighting for either side without being in production or even in the possession and control of said fighters. Natural resources still funding fighters who don&#x27;t possess them he argues is particularly &#x27;dangerous&#x27; because this finance is available to those otherwise losing, or even yet to initiate armed conflict, so can make new conflicts possible or have the effect of lengthening those where defeat may have come sooner.

The different mode of production of kimberlite and alluvial diamonds explains why the presence of the latter in fought over areas fuels conflict in ways the former does not. The need to realise financial value from the resource, means that the availability of &#x27;futures&#x27; contracts, and suitability for looting, are key to its influence. Gemstones and rare minerals are much better suited to this activity than heavier or otherwise less portable resources, however valuable those may be in times of peace.

These findings have moved campaigners, policymakers and diplomats to devise regulatory interventions intended to prevent natural resources from funding continued fighting in the hope that this might hasten an end to those conflicts. In the twelve years that followed the end of the Cold War, resolutions imposing sanctions on resource exporters in ten different conflicts were passed by the United Nations Security Council.

==History==

===Angola===
Reports estimated that as much as 21% of the total diamond production in the 1980s was being sold for illegal and unethical purposes and 19% was specifically &quot;conflict&quot; in nature. By 1999, the illegal diamond trade was estimated by the World Diamond Council to have been reduced to 4% of the world&#x27;s diamond production. The World Diamond Council reported that by 2004 this percentage had fallen to approximately 1% and up to today the World Diamond Council refers to this illegal trade to be virtually eliminated, meaning that more than 99% of diamonds being sold have a legal background.

Despite the UN Resolution, UNITA was able to continue to sell or trade some diamonds in order to finance its war effort. The UN set out to find how this remaining illicit trade was being conducted and appointed Canadian ambassador Robert Fowler to investigate. In 2000, he produced the Fowler Report, which named those countries, organizations and individuals involved in the trade. The report is credited with establishing the link between diamonds and third world conflicts, and led directly to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1295, as well as the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. Still, after the report was published in 2013, smugglers from these African countries were selling blood diamonds through channels less sophisticated, such as social media posts. Rhinestones from Angola, produced by UNITA, were being traded to Cameroon for acquisition of a Cameroonian certificate naturalization to then be sold as legitimate.

===Ivory Coast===
Ivory Coast began to develop a fledgling diamond mining industry in the early 1990s. A coup overthrew the government in 1999, starting a civil war. The country became a route for exporting diamonds from Liberia and war-torn Sierra Leone. Foreign investment begin to withdraw from Ivory Coast. To curtail the illegal trade, the nation stopped all diamond mining and the UN Security Council banned all exports of diamonds from Ivory Coast in December 2005. This ban lasted about ten years but it was later lifted in April 2014 when members of the UN council voted to suspend the sanction. The Kimberley process officials also notified in November 2013 that Ivory Coast was right producing artisanal diamonds.

Despite UN sanctions, the illicit diamond trade still exists in Ivory Coast. Rough diamonds are exported out of the country to neighboring states and international trading centers through the northern Forces Nouvelles controlled section of the country, a group which is reported to be using these funds to re-arm.

===Democratic Republic of Congo===
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire) has suffered numerous looting wars in the 1990s, but has been a member of the Kimberley Process since 2003 and now exports about 8% of the world&#x27;s diamonds. , there is a warning concerning diamonds proceeding from this area since there have been multiple cases of fake Kimberley certificates accompanying the gems. One of De Beers most celebrated diamonds, the D-colour Millennium Star was discovered in the DRC and sold to De Beers, in open competition with other diamond buyers, between 1991 and 1992.

===Liberia===
From 1989 to 2003, Liberia was engaged in a civil war. In 2000, the UN accused Liberian president Charles G. Taylor of supporting the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) insurgency in neighboring Sierra Leone with weapons and training in exchange for diamonds. In 2001, the United Nations applied sanctions on the Liberian diamond trade. In August 2003, Taylor stepped down as president and, after being exiled to Nigeria, faced trial in The Hague. On July 21, 2006, he pleaded not guilty to crimes against humanity and war crimes, of which he was found guilty in April 2012. On May 30, 2012, he began a 50-year sentence in a high security prison in the United Kingdom.

Around the time of the 1998 United States embassy bombings, al-Qaeda allegedly bought gems from Liberia as some of its other financial assets were frozen.

Having regained peace, Liberia is attempting to construct a legitimate diamond mining industry. The UN has lifted sanctions and Liberia is now a member of the Kimberley Process.

In December 2014 however, Liberian diamonds were reported to be partly produced using child labor according to the U.S. Department of Labor&#x27;s &quot;List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor&quot;.

=== Sierra Leone ===
The Sierra Leone Civil War started in 1991 and continued until 2002, costing an estimate of 50,000 lives and causing local people to suffer killings, mutilation, rape, torture and abduction, mainly due to the brutal warfare waged by rebel group, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF). The Revolutionary United Front (RUF) claimed that they supported causes of justice and democracy in the beginning, but later on they started to control the villages and to prevent local people from voting for the new government by chopping off their limbs. Victims included children and infants. It created numerous examples of physical and psychological harm across Sierra Leone.

Moreover, they also occupied the diamond mines in order to get access to funding and continued support of their actions. For example, during that time, RUF was mining up to $125 million of diamonds yearly. Since diamonds are used as a funding source, they also created opportunities for tax evasion and financial support of crime. Therefore, United Nations Security Council imposed diamond sanctions in 2000, which were then lifted in 2003. According to National Geographic News, all of these civil wars and conflicts created by rebel groups resulted in over four million deaths in the African population and injuries to over two million civilians. Another latest conflict diamond statistic from Statistic Brain, revealed that Sierra Leone has been listed as second highest in the production of conflict diamonds, which is shown as 1% of the world&#x27;s production, after Angola, which produced 2.1% in 2016. 15% of Sierra Leone&#x27;s diamond production are conflict diamonds. It shows that the production of conflict diamonds still exists in Sierra Leone.

According to the 2005 Country Reports on Human Right Practices of Africa from the United States, serious human rights issues still exist in Sierra Leone, even though the 11-year civil conflict had officially ended by 2002. Sierra Leone remains in an unstable political situation, although the country has elected a new government. The huge consequences of blood diamonds still remains a mainstream issue in Sierra Leone. One of the biggest issues is people still being abused by the security forces, including rape and the use of excessive force on detainees, including teenagers. Child abuse and child labor are other serious issues which took place in Sierra Leone after the civil conflicts. As they need a huge number of workers, the security forces started kidnapping and forcing young adults to be their slaves; children were forced to join their army as soldiers, and women were raped. They even burned entire villages. Thousands of men, women, and children are used as slaves to collect diamonds, and they are forced to use their bare hands to dig in mud along river banks instead of digging with tools.

Based on the report, The Truth About Diamonds: Conflict and Development from Global Witness, it mentioned that Sierra Leone is listed as second from the bottom of the United Nation Human Development Index. It also shows that Sierra Leone still makes slow progress, in 2016, in such different aspects as, for example, education, health, and human rights, since 1990, which is also the year that conflicts took place in Sierra Leone. It shows that it is a huge consequence of blood diamonds that it brought into Sierra Leone. Even though the war had ended in 2002 and the government tried to improve and adjust the cooperation of the diamond industry. Sierra Leone resulted in an increase of over US$140 million in 2005 and attempted a percentage return of export tax to diamond mining communities. However, it does not improve anythingthe money is not reaching the public and it has not provided benefit to anyone in the communities. For instance, the Kono district in Sierra Leone has been mined for 70 years, but they still have no basic facilities, like electricity and repairing of roads. Houses are destroyed because of the civil wars. It also examines the ethical issues of how rebel groups treat those locals. They used brainwashing of inexperienced young children and forced them to be child soldiers as they lost their personal freedom and rights under command that included violence and intimidation.

=== Republic of Congo ===
The Republic of the Congo (Congo-Brazzaville) was expelled from the Kimberley Process in 2004 because, despite having no official diamond mining industry, the country was exporting large quantities of diamonds, the origin of which it could not detail. It was also accused of falsifying certificates of origin. The Republic of the Congo was readmitted in 2007.

===Zimbabwe===
Zimbabwe diamonds are not considered conflict diamonds by the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme.

In July 2010, the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme agreed that diamonds from the country&#x27;s disputed Marange Diamond Fields could be sold on the international market, after a report from the Scheme&#x27;s monitor a month earlier described diamonds mined from the fields as conflict-free.

===Central African Republic===
==Conflict diamond campaign==
Global Witness was one of the first organizations to pick up on the link between diamonds and conflicts in Africa in its 1998 report entitled &quot;A Rough Trade&quot;. With the passing of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1173 in 1998, the United Nations identified the conflict diamond issue as a funding for war. The Fowler Report in 2000 detailed in depth how UNITA was financing its war activities, and in May 2000, led directly to the passing of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1295 and the diamond producing countries of southern Africa meeting in Kimberley, South Africa to plan a method by which the trade in conflict diamonds could be halted, and buyers of diamonds could be assured that their diamonds have not contributed to violence. In this resolution the Security Council wrote:

Welcomes the proposal that a meeting of experts be convened for the purpose of devising a system of controls to facilitate the implementation of the measures contained in Resolution 1173 (1998), including arrangements that would allow for increased transparency and accountability in the control of diamonds from their point of origin to the bourses, emphasizes that it is important that, in devising such controls, every effort be made to avoid inflicting collateral damage on the legitimate diamond trade, and welcomes the intention of the Republic of South Africa to host a relevant conference this year.

===Kimberley Process Certification Scheme===

On July 19, 2000, the World Diamond Congress at Antwerp adopted a resolution to strengthen the diamond industry&#x27;s ability to block sales of conflict diamonds. The resolution called for an international certification system on the export and import of diamonds, legislation in all countries to accept only officially sealed packages of diamonds, for countries to impose criminal charges on anyone trafficking in conflict diamonds, and instituted a ban on any individual found trading in conflict diamonds from the diamond bourses of the World Federation of Diamond Bourses. The Kimberley Process was at the start led by South Africa and Canada as vice president and since then every year a new chair and vice chair country are elected to maintain the legitimacy of their practices. This system tracks diamonds from the mine to the market and regulates the policing surrounding the export, manufacture and sale of the products. Also in tourist countries like the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. All the Kimberley member states are not allowed to trade with non members. Before a gemstone is allowed through the airports to other countries, the Kimberley Certification must be presented by the gem&#x27;s owner or obtained from a renowned attorney. The certificate should also be requested by the customer when the gems have reached a retail store to ensure its provenance.

On January 17–18 of 2001, diamond industry figures convened and formed the new organization, the World Diamond Council. This new body set out to draft a new process, whereby all diamond rough could be certified as coming from a non-conflict source.

The KPCS was given approval by the UN on March 13, 2002, and in November, after two years of negotiation between governments, diamond producers, and Non-Government organizations, the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme was created.

The Kimberley Process attempted to curtail the flow of conflict diamonds, help stabilize fragile countries and support their development. As the Kimberley Process has made life harder for criminals, it has brought large volumes of diamonds onto the legal market that would not otherwise have made it there. This has increased the revenues of poor governments, and helped them to address their countries’ development challenges. For instance, around $125 million worth of diamonds were legally exported from Sierra Leone in 2006, compared to almost none at the end of the 1990s.

===Shortcomings and criticism===

The Kimberley Process has ultimately failed to stem the flow of blood diamonds, leading key proponents such as Global Witness to abandon the scheme. In addition, there is no guarantee that diamonds with a Kimberley Process Certification are in fact conflict-free. This is due to the nature of the corrupt government officials in the leading diamond producing countries. It is common for these officials to be bribed with $50 to $100 a day in exchange for paperwork declaring that blood diamonds are Kimberley Process Certified.

===Transparency===
The Kimberley system attempted to increase governments&#x27; transparency by forcing them to keep records of the diamonds they are exporting and importing and how much they are worth. In theory, this would show governments their finances so that they can be held accountable for how much they are spending for the benefit of the country&#x27;s population. However non-compliance by countries such as Venezuela has led to the failure of accountability.

The company Materialytics claims that it can trace the origin of virtually any diamond using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy. However, there is no way to know whether a diamond purchased online is blood free or not.

== Policy responses ==
=== American policy ===

On January 18, 2001, President Bill Clinton issued Executive Order 13194 which prohibited the importation of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone into the United States in accordance with the UN resolutions. On May 22, 2001, President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13213 which banned rough diamond importation from Liberia into the United States. Liberia had been recognized by the United Nations as acting as a pipeline for conflict diamonds from Sierra Leone.

The United States enacted the Clean Diamond Trade Act (CDTA) on April 25, 2003, implemented on July 29, 2003, by Executive Order 13312. The CDTA installed the legislation to implement the KPCS in law in the United States. The implementation of this legislation was key to the success of the KPCS, as the United States is the largest consumer of diamonds. The CDTA states: &#x27;As the consumer of a majority of the world&#x27;s supply of diamonds, the United States has an obligation to help sever the link between diamonds and conflict and press for implementation of an effective solution.

The United States Department of State also maintains an office for a Special Adviser for Conflict Diamonds. As of October 14, 2015, the position is held by Ashley Orbach.

=== Canadian policy ===
During the 1990s, diamond-rich areas were discovered in Northern Canada. Canada is one of the key players in the diamond industry. Partnership Africa Canada was created in 1986 to help with the crisis in Africa. This organization is also part of the Diamond Development Initiative. The Diamond Development Initiative helps improve and regulate the legal diamond industry.

The Kimberley Process was initiated in May 2000 by South Africa with Canada, a major supporter of instituting the scheme. Canada has now passed several laws that help stop the trade of conflict diamonds. The laws deal with the export and import of rough diamonds, and also how they are transferred. In December 2002, the Export and Import of Rough Diamonds Act was passed by the Canadian government. This law acts as a system that helps control the importing, exporting and transporting of rough diamonds through Canada. The Export and Import of Rough Diamonds Act also states that the Kimberley Process is the minimum requirement of certifying rough diamonds and a certificate is also required for all shipments of diamonds. This certificate is called the Canadian Certificate, it gives permission for an officer to seize any shipment of diamonds that does not meet the requirements of the Export and Import of Rough Diamonds Act.

The Government of the Northwest Territories of Canada (GNWT) also has a unique certification program. They offer a Government certificate on all diamonds that are mined, cut, and polished in the Northwest Territories of Canada. Canadian diamonds are tracked from the mine, through the refining process, to the retail jeweler with a unique diamond identification number (DIN) laser inscribed on the diamond&#x27;s girdle. To obtain this certificate one must cut and polish the diamond in the NWT.

== Technology response ==
Technical services have emerged that may act as a solution for tracking diamond movement across borders. A service was launched in July 2016 that allows managers to build systems using a blockchain database for tracking high-value or highly regulated items through a supply chain. Everledger is one using such a system to &quot;record the movement of diamonds from mines to jewelry stores&quot; and is one of the inaugural clients of a new blockchain-based tracking service from IBM.

In addition, the rise of lab-grown diamonds presents an alternative to mined diamonds. Lab-grown diamonds are chemically and physically identical to mined diamonds but without the ethical and environmental downsides of traditional mining. 

==In popular culture==

* &quot;Diamonds from Sierra Leone&quot; is a Grammy-winning song by American rapper Kanye West about blood diamonds in Sierra Leone.

<doc id="148642" wikidata="Q204234" url="?curid=148642" title="Milton Keynes">
<text>Milton Keynes ( ) is a city in Buckinghamshire, England, about north-west of London. At the 2021 Census, the population of its urban area was 264,349. The River Great Ouse forms the northern boundary of the urban area; a tributary, the River Ouzel, meanders through its linear parks and balancing lakes. Approximately 25% of the urban area is parkland or woodland and includes two Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). The city is made up of many different districts.

In the 1960s, the government decided that a further generation of new towns in the south east of England was needed to relieve housing congestion in London. Milton Keynes was to be the biggest yet, with a population of 250,000 and area of . At designation, its area incorporated the existing towns of Bletchley, Fenny Stratford, Wolverton and Stony Stratford, along with another fifteen villages and farmland in between. These settlements had an extensive historical record since the Norman conquest; detailed archaeological investigations before development revealed evidence of human occupation from the Neolithic period, including the Milton Keynes Hoard of Bronze Age gold jewellery. The government established Milton Keynes Development Corporation (MKDC) to design and deliver this new city. The decided on a softer, more human-scaled landscape than in the earlier English new towns but with an emphatically modernist architecture. Recognising how traditional towns and cities had become choked in traffic, they established a grid of distributor roads about between edges, leaving the spaces between to develop more organically. An extensive network of shared paths for leisure cyclists and pedestrians criss-crosses through and between them. Rejecting the residential tower block concept that had become unpopular, they set a height limit of three storeys outside Central Milton Keynes.

Facilities include a 1,400-seat theatre, a municipal art gallery, two multiplex cinemas, an ecumenical central church, a 400-seat concert hall, a teaching hospital, a 30,500-seat football stadium, an indoor ski-slope and a 65,000-capacity open-air concert venue. Seven railway stations serve the Milton Keynes urban area (one inter-city). The Open University is based here and there is a small campus of the University of Bedfordshire. Most major sports are represented at amateur level; Red Bull Racing (Formula One), MK Dons (association football), and Milton Keynes Lightning (ice hockey) are its professional teams. The Peace Pagoda overlooking Willen Lake was the first such to be built in Europe. The many works of sculpture in parks and public spaces include the iconic &quot;Concrete Cows&quot; at Milton Keynes Museum.

Milton Keynes is among the most economically productive localities in the UK, ranking highly against a number of criteria. It has the UK&#x27;s fifth-highest number of business startups per capita (but equally of business failures). It is home to several major national and international companies. Despite economic success and personal wealth for some, there are pockets of nationally significant poverty. The employment profile is composed of about 90% service industries and 9% manufacturing.
==History==
===Birth of a &#x27;new city&#x27;===
In the 1960s, the UK government decided that a further generation of new towns in the South East of England was needed to relieve housing congestion in London. Since the 1950s, overspill housing for several London boroughs had been constructed in Bletchley. Further studies in the 1960s identified north Buckinghamshire as a possible site for a large new town, a new city, encompassing the existing towns of Bletchley, Stony Stratford, and Wolverton. The New Town (informally and in planning documents, &#x27;New City&#x27;) was to be the biggest yet, with a target population of 250,000, in a &#x27;designated area&#x27; of . The name &#x27;Milton Keynes&#x27; was taken from that of an existing village on the site.

On 23 January 1967, when the formal &quot;new town designation order&quot; was made, the area to be developed was largely farmland and undeveloped villages. The site was deliberately located equidistant from London, Birmingham, Leicester, Oxford, and Cambridge, with the intention that it would be self-sustaining and eventually become a major regional centre in its own right. Planning control was taken from elected local authorities and delegated to the Milton Keynes Development Corporation (MKDC). Before construction began, every area was subject to detailed archaeological investigation: doing so has exposed a rich history of human settlement since Neolithic times and has provided a unique insight into the history of a large sample of the landscape of North Buckinghamshire.

The corporation&#x27;s strongly modernist designs were regularly featured in the magazines &quot;Architectural Design&quot; and the &quot;Architects&#x27; Journal&quot;. MKDC was determined to learn from the mistakes made in the earlier new towns, and revisit the garden city ideals. They set in place the characteristic grid roads that run between districts (&#x27;grid squares&#x27;), as well as a programme of intensive planting, balancing lakes and parkland. Central Milton Keynes (&quot;CMK&quot;) was not intended to be a traditional town centre but a central business and shopping district to supplement local centres embedded in most of the grid squares. This non-hierarchical devolved city plan was a departure from the English new towns tradition and envisaged a wide range of industry and diversity of housing styles and tenures. The largest and almost the last of the British New Towns, Milton Keynes has &#x27;stood the test of time far better than most, and has proved flexible and adaptable&#x27;. The radical grid plan was inspired by the work of Melvin M. Webber, described by the founding architect of Milton Keynes, Derek Walker, as the &#x27;father of the city&#x27;. Webber thought that telecommunications meant that the old idea of a city as a concentric cluster was out of date and that cities which enabled people to travel around them readily would be the thing of the future, achieving &quot;community without &quot; for residents.

The government wound up MKDC in 1992, 25 years after the new town was founded, transferring control to the Commission for New Towns (CNT) and then finally to English Partnerships, with the planning function returning to local council control (since 1974 and the Local Government Act 1972, Milton Keynes Borough (now City) Council). From 2004 to 2011 a government quango, the Milton Keynes Partnership, had development control powers to accelerate the growth of Milton Keynes.

===Formal award of city status===
Along with many other towns and boroughs, Milton Keynes competed (unsuccessfully) for formal city status in the 2000, 2002 and 2012 competitions. However the Borough (including rural areas, in addition to the MK urban area) was successful in 2022, in the Queen&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee Civic Honours competition. On 15 August 2022, the Crown Office announced formally that Queen Elizabeth II had ordained by letters patent that the Borough of Milton Keynes has been given city status. In law, it is the Borough rather than its eponymous settlement that has city status; nevertheless it is the latter that is more commonly known as the city.

===Name===

The name &#x27;Milton Keynes&#x27; was a reuse of the name of one of the original historic villages in the designated area, now more generally known as &#x27;Milton Keynes Village&#x27; to distinguish it from the modern settlement. After the Norman conquest, the de Cahaignes family held the manor from 1166 to the late 13th century as well as others in the country (Ashton Keynes in Wiltshire, Somerford Keynes in Gloucestershire, and Horsted Keynes in West Sussex). The village was originally known as Middeltone (11th century); then later as Middelton Kaynes or Caynes (13th century); Milton Keynes (15th century); and Milton alias Middelton Gaynes (17th century).

===Prior history===

The area that was to become Milton Keynes encompassed a landscape that has a rich historic legacy. The area to be developed was largely farmland and undeveloped villages, but with evidence of permanent settlement dating back to the Bronze Age. Before construction began, every area was subject to detailed archaeological investigation: this work has provided an insight into the history of a very large sample of the landscape of south-central England. There is evidence of Stone Age, late Bronze Age/early Iron Age, Romano-British, Anglo-Saxon, Anglo-Norman, Medieval, and late Industrial Revolution settlements such as the railway towns of Wolverton (with its railway works) and Bletchley (at the junction of the London and North Western Railway with the OxfordCambridge Varsity Line). The most notable archaeological artefact was the Milton Keynes Hoard, which the British Museum described as &#x27;one of the biggest concentrations of Bronze Age gold known from Britain and seems to flaunt wealth.&#x27;

Bletchley Park, the site of World War II Allied code-breaking and Colossus, the world&#x27;s first programmable electronic digital computer, is a major component of MK&#x27;s modern history. It is now a flourishing heritage attraction, receiving hundreds of thousands of visitors annually.

When the boundary of Milton Keynes was defined in 1967, some 40,000 people lived in four towns and fifteen villages or hamlets in the &quot;designated area&quot;.

==Urban design==
The radical plan, form and scale of Milton Keynes attracted international attention. Early phases of development include work by celebrated architects, including 
Sir Richard MacCormac, 
Norman Foster, 
Henning Larsen, 
Ralph Erskine, 
John Winter, 
and Martin Richardson. 
Led by Lord Campbell of Eskan (chairman) and Fred Roche (General Manager), the Corporation attracted talented young architects, led by the respected designer, Derek Walker. In the modernist Miesian tradition is the Shopping Building designed by Stuart Mosscrop and Christopher Woodward, a grade II listed building, which the Twentieth Century Society &quot;inter alia&quot; regards as the &#x27;most distinguished&#x27; twentieth century retail building in Britain. 

The Development Corporation also led an ambitious public art programme.

The urban design has not been universally praised. In 1980, the then president of the Royal Town Planning Institute, Francis Tibbalds, described Central Milton Keynes as &quot;bland, rigid, sterile, and totally boring.&quot; Michael Edwards, a member of the original consultancy team, believes that there were weaknesses in their proposal and that the Development Corporation implemented it badly.

===Grid roads and grid squares===
The Milton Keynes Development Corporation planned the major road layout according to street hierarchy principles, using a grid pattern of approximately intervals, rather than on the more conventional pattern found in older settlements. Major distributor roads run between communities, rather than through them: these distributor roads are known locally as &quot;grid roads&quot; and the spaces between them the neighbourhoods are known as &quot;grid squares&quot; (though few are actually square or even ). This spacing was chosen so that people would always be within six minutes&#x27; walking distance of a grid-road bus-stop. Consequently, each grid square is a semi-autonomous community, making a unique collective of 100 clearly identifiable neighbourhoods within the overall urban environment. The grid squares have a variety of development styles, ranging from conventional urban development and industrial parks to original rural and modern urban and suburban developments. Most grid squares have a local centre, intended as a retail hub, and many have community facilities as well. Each of the original villages is the heart of its own grid-square. Originally intended under the master plan to sit alongside the grid roads, these local centres were mostly in fact built embedded in the communities.

Although the 1970 master plan assumed cross-road junctions, roundabout junctions were built at intersections because this type of junction is more efficient at dealing with small to medium volumes. Some major roads are dual carriageway, the others are single carriageway. Along one side of each single carriageway grid road, there is usually a (grassed) reservation to permit dualling or additional transport infrastructure at a later date. , this has been limited to some dualling. The edges of each grid square are landscaped and densely planted some additionally have noise attenuation mounds to minimise traffic noise from the grid road impacting the adjacent grid square. Traffic movements are fast, with relatively little congestion since there are alternative routes to any particular destination other than during peak periods. The national speed limit applies on the grid roads, although lower speed limits have been introduced on some stretches to reduce accident rates. Pedestrians rarely need to cross grid roads at grade, as underpasses and bridges were specified at frequent places along each stretch of all of the grid roads. In contrast, the later districts planned by English Partnerships have departed from this model, without a road hierarchy but with conventional junctions with traffic lights and at grade pedestrian crossings.

===Redways===
There is a separate network (approximately total length) of cycle and pedestrian routes the redways that runs through the grid-squares and often runs alongside the grid-road network. This was designed to segregate slow moving cycle and pedestrian traffic from fast moving motor traffic. In practice, it is mainly used for leisure cycling rather than commuting, perhaps because the cycle routes are shared with pedestrians, cross the grid-roads via bridge or underpass rather than at grade, and because some take meandering scenic routes rather than straight lines. It is so called because it is generally surfaced with red tarmac. The national Sustrans national cycle network routes 6 and 51 take advantage of this system.

===Height===

The original design guidance declared that commercial building heights in the centre should not exceed six storeys, with a limit of three storeys for houses (elsewhere), paraphrased locally as &quot;no building taller than the tallest tree&quot;. In contrast, the Milton Keynes Partnership, in its expansion plans for Milton Keynes, believed that Central Milton Keynes (and elsewhere) needed &quot;landmark buildings&quot; and subsequently lifted the height restriction for the area. As a result, high rise buildings have been built in the central business district. 
More recent local plans have protected the existing boulevard framework and set higher standards for architectural excellence.

===Linear parks===

The flood plains of the Great Ouse and of its tributaries (the Ouzel and some brooks) have been protected as linear parks that run right through Milton Keynes; these were identified as important landscape and flood-management assets from the outset. At ten times larger than London&#x27;s Hyde Park and a third larger than Richmond Park the landscape architects realised that the Royal Parks model would not be appropriate or affordable and drew on their National Park experience. As Bendixson and Platt (1992) write: &quot;They divided the Ouzel Valley into &#x27;strings, beads and settings&#x27;. The &#x27;strings&#x27; are well-maintained routes, be they for walking, bicycling or riding; the &#x27;beads&#x27; are sports centres, lakeside cafes and other activity areas; the &#x27;settings&#x27; are self-managed land-uses such as woods, riding paddocks, a golf course and a farm&quot;.

The Grand Union Canal is another green route (and demonstrates the level geography of the area there is just one minor lock in its entire meandering route through from the southern boundary near Fenny Stratford to the &quot;Iron Trunk&quot; aqueduct over the Ouse at Wolverton at its northern boundary). The initial park system was planned by Peter Youngman (Chief Landscape Architect), who also developed landscape precepts for all development areas: groups of grid squares were to be planted with different selections of trees and shrubs to give them distinct identities. The detailed planning and landscape design of parks and of the grid roads was evolved under the leadership of Neil Higson, who from 1977 took over from Youngman. 

In a national comparison of urban areas by open space available to residents, Milton Keynes ranked highest in the UK. Milton Keynes is unusual in that most of the parks are owned and managed by a charity, the Milton Keynes Parks Trust rather than the local authority, to ensure that the management of the city&#x27;s green spaces are largely independent of the council&#x27;s expenditure priorities.

===Forest city concept===
The Development Corporation&#x27;s original design concept aimed for a &quot;forest city&quot; and its foresters planted millions of trees from its own nursery in Newlands in the following years. Parks, lakes and green spaces cover about 25% of Milton Keynes; , there are 22 million trees and shrubs in public open spaces. When the Development Corporation was being wound up, it transferred the major parks, lakes, river-banks and grid-road margins to the Parks Trust, a charity which is independent of the municipal authority. MKDC endowed the Parks Trust with a portfolio of commercial properties, the income from which pays for the upkeep of the green spaces. , approximately 25% of the urban area is parkland or woodland. It includes two Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Howe Park Wood and Oxley Mead.

===Centre===

As a key element of the planners&#x27; vision, Milton Keynes has a purpose built centre, with a very large &quot;covered high street&quot; shopping centre, 
a theatre, 
municipal art gallery,
a multiplex cinema, 
hotels, 
central business district, 
an ecumenical church, 
Milton Keynes Civic Offices and central railway station.

Campbell Park, a formal park extending east from the business area to the Grand Union Canal, is described in the Pevsner Architectural Guides as &quot; most imaginative park to have been laid out in Britain in the 20th century&quot;. The park is listed (grade 2) by Historic England,
===Original towns and villages===

Milton Keynes consists of many pre-existing towns and villages that anchored the urban design, as well as new infill developments. The modern-day urban area outside the original six towns (Bletchley, Fenny Stratford, Newport Pagnell, Stony Stratford, Wolverton, and Woburn Sands) was largely rural farmland but included many picturesque North Buckinghamshire villages and hamlets: Bradwell village and its Abbey, Broughton, Caldecotte, Great Linford, Loughton, Milton Keynes Village, New Bradwell, Shenley Brook End, Shenley Church End, Simpson, Stantonbury, Tattenhoe, Tongwell, Walton, Water Eaton, Wavendon, Willen, Great and Little Woolstone, Woughton on the Green. These historical settlements were made the focal points of their respective grid square. Every other district has an historical antecedent, if only in original farms or even field names.

Bletchley was first recorded in the 12th century as &quot;Blechelai&quot;. Its station was an important junction (the London and North Western Railway with the Oxford-Cambridge Varsity Line), leading to the substantial urban growth in the town in the Victorian period. It expanded to absorb the village of Water Eaton and town of Fenny Stratford.

Bradwell is a traditional rural village with earthworks of a Norman motte and bailey and parish church. There is a YHA hostel beside the church.

Bradwell Abbey, a former Benedictine Priory and scheduled monument, was of major economic importance in this area of North Buckinghamshire before its dissolution in 1524. Nowadays there is only a small medieval chapel and a manor house occupying the site.

New Bradwell, to the north of Bradwell and east of Wolverton, was built specifically for railway workers. The level bed of the old Wolverton to Newport Pagnell Line near here has been converted to a redway, making it a favoured route for cycling. A working windmill is sited on a hill outside the village.

Great Linford appears in the Domesday Book as &quot;Linforde&quot;, and features a church dedicated to Saint Andrew, dating from 1215. Today, the outer buildings of the 17th century manor house form an arts centre.

Milton Keynes (Village) is the original village to which the New Town owes its name. The original village is still evident, with a pleasant thatched pub, village hall, church and traditional housing. The area around the village has reverted to its 11th century name of Middleton &quot;(Middeltone&quot;). The oldest surviving domestic building in the area (c. 1300 CE), &quot;perhaps the manor house&quot;, is here.

Stony Stratford began as a settlement on Watling Street during the Roman occupation, beside the ford over the Great Ouse. There has been a market here since 1194 (by charter of King Richard I). The former Rose and Crown Inn on the High Street is reputedly the last place the Princes in the Tower were seen alive.

The manor house of Walton village, Walton Hall, is the headquarters of the Open University and the tiny parish church (deconsecrated) is in its grounds.

The small parish church (1680) at Willen was designed by the architect and physicist Robert Hooke. Nearby, there is a Buddhist Temple and a Peace Pagoda, which was built in 1980 and was the first built by the Nipponzan-Myōhōji Buddhist Order in the western world.

The original Wolverton was a medieval settlement just north and west of today&#x27;s town. The ridge and furrow pattern of agriculture can still be seen in the nearby fields. The 12th century (rebuilt in 1819) &#x27;Church of the Holy Trinity&#x27; still stands next to the Norman motte and bailey site. Modern Wolverton was a 19th-century New Town built to house the workers at the Wolverton railway works, which built engines and carriages for the London and North Western Railway.

Among the smaller villages and hamlets are three Broughton, Loughton and Woughton on the Green that are of note in that their names each use a different pronunciation of the ough letter sequence in English.

==Education==
===Schools===
In early planning, education provision was carefully integrated into the development plans with the intention that school journeys would, as far as possible, be made by walking and cycling. Each residential grid square was provided with a primary school (ages 5 to 8) for c.240 children, and for each two squares there was a middle school (ages 8 to 12) for c.480 children. For each eight squares there was a large secondary education campus, to contain between two and four schools for a total of 3,000 – 4,500 children. A central resource area served all the schools on a campus. In addition, each campus included a leisure centre with indoor and outdoor sports facilities and a swimming pool, plus a theatre. These facilities were available to the public outside school hours, thus maximising use of the investment. Changes in central government policy from the 1980s onwards subsequently led to much of this system being abandoned. Some schools have since been merged and sites sold for development, many converted to academies, and the leisure centres outsourced to commercial providers.

As in most parts of the UK, the state secondary schools in Milton Keynes are comprehensives, although schools in the rest of Buckinghamshire still use the tripartite system. Private schools are also available.

===Universities and colleges===
The Open University&#x27;s headquarters are in the Walton Hall district; though because this is a distance learning institution, the only students resident on campus are approximately 200 full-time postgraduates. Cranfield University, an all-postgraduate institution, is in nearby Cranfield, Bedfordshire. Milton Keynes College provides further education up to foundation degree level. A campus of the University of Bedfordshire provides some tertiary education facilities locally. 

, Milton Keynes is the UK&#x27;s largest population centre without its own conventional university, a shortfall that the Council aims to rectify. In January 2019, the council and its partner, Cranfield University, invited proposals to design a campus near the Central station for a new university, code-named MK:U. However this project seems unlikely to proceed, following a government decision in January 2023 to deny funding. In June 2023, the Open University announced that it would &quot;initiate work on the strategic and financial case to relocate [from] the OU&#x27;s existing campus at Walton Hall to a new site adjacent to the central railway station&quot; and possibly commence teaching full-time undergraduates. 

Through Milton Keynes University Hospital, the city also has links with the University of Buckingham&#x27;s medical school.

===City development archive and library===
Milton Keynes City Discovery Centre at Bradwell Abbey holds an extensive archive about the planning and development of Milton Keynes and has an associated research library. The centre also offers an education programme (with a focus on urban geography and local history) to schools, universities and professionals.

==Culture, media and sport==
===Music===

The open-air National Bowl is a 65,000-capacity venue for large-scale events.

In Wavendon, the Stables founded by the jazz musicians Cleo Laine and John Dankworth provides a venue for jazz, blues, folk, rock, classical, pop and world music. It presents around 400 concerts and over 200 educational events each year and also hosts the National Youth Music Camps summer camp for young musicians. In 2010, the Stables founded the biennial &quot;IF Milton Keynes International Festival&quot;, producing events in unconventional spaces and places across Milton Keynes.

Milton Keynes City Orchestra is a professional freelance orchestra based at Woughton Campus.

===Arts, cinema, theatre and museums===
The municipal public art gallery, MK Gallery, presents exhibitions of international contemporary art. The gallery was extended and remodelled in 2018/19 and includes an art-house cinema. Elsewhere in the city, there are two multiplex cinemas; one in CMK and one in Denbigh.

In 1999, the adjacent 1,400-seat Milton Keynes Theatre opened. The theatre has an unusual feature: the ceiling can be lowered closing off the third tier (gallery) to create a more intimate space for smaller-scale productions. There is a further professional performance space in Stantonbury.

There are three museums: the Bletchley Park complex, which houses the museum of wartime cryptography; the National Museum of Computing (adjacent to Bletchley Park, with a separate entrance), which includes a working replica of the Colossus computer; and the Milton Keynes Museum, which includes the Stacey Hill Collection of rural life that existed before the foundation of MK, the British Telecom collection, and the original Concrete Cows. 
Other numerous public sculptures in Milton Keynes include work by Elisabeth Frink, Philip Jackson, Nicolas Moreton and Ronald Rae.

Milton Keynes Arts Centre offers a year-round exhibition programme, family workshops and courses. The centre is based in some of Linford Manor&#x27;s historical exterior buildings, barns, almshouses and pavilions. The Westbury Arts Centre in Shenley Wood is based in a 16th-century grade II listed farmhouse building. Westbury Arts has been providing spaces and studios for professional artists since 1994.

===Communications and media===
For television, the city is allocated to BBC East and ITV Anglia. For radio, Milton Keynes is served by Heart East (a regional commercial station based locally) and two community radio stations (&quot;MKFM&quot; and &quot;1055 The Point&quot;). BBC Three Counties Radio is the local BBC Radio station. CRMK (Cable Radio Milton Keynes) is a voluntary station broadcasting on the Internet.

, Milton Keynes has one local newspaper, the &quot;Milton Keynes Citizen&quot;, which has a significant online presence.

===Sport===

Milton Keynes has professional teams in football (Milton Keynes Dons F.C. at Stadium MK), in ice hockey (Milton Keynes Lightning at Planet Ice Milton Keynes), and in Formula One (Red Bull Racing).

The Xscape indoor ski slope and the iFLY indoor sky diving facility are important attractions in CMK; the National Badminton Centre in Loughton is home to the national badminton squad and headquarters of Badminton England.

Many other sports are represented at amateur level.

Near the central station, in a space beside the former Milton Keynes central bus station, there is a purpose-built street skateboarding plaza named the Buszy.

Willen Lake hosts watersports on the south basin.

===New technologies===
In recent years, the City Council has promoted MK as a test-bed for experimental urban technologies. The most well-known of these is the Starship Technologies&#x27; (largely) autonomous delivery robots: Milton Keynes provided its world-first urban deployment of these units in 2018. By October 2020, said Starship, Milton Keynes had the &#x27;world&#x27;s largest autonomous robot fleet&#x27; Other projects include the LUTZ Pathfinder pod, an autonomous (self-driving) vehicle built by the Transport Systems Catapult.

==Government==
===Local government===
The responsible local government is Milton Keynes City Council, which administers the City of Milton Keynes, a unitary authority, and non-metropolitan county in law, since May 1996. Until then, it was controlled by Buckinghamshire County Council. Historically, most of the area that became Milton Keynes was known as the &quot;Three Hundreds of Newport&quot;.

The unitary authority area, which extends beyond the ONS-defined Milton Keynes built-up area and encompasses the town of Olney and many rural villages and hamlets, is fully parished.

===International co-operation===
Although Milton Keynes has no formalised twinning agreements, it has partnered and co-operated with various cities over the years. The most contact has been with Almere, Netherlands, especially on energy management and urban planning. For several years from 1995, the city co-operated with Tychy, Poland, after participating in the European City Cooperation System in Tychy in March 1994.

Due to the twinning of the borough and the equivalent administrative region of Bernkastel-Wittlich, the council worked with Bernkastel-Kues, Germany, for example on art projects.

In 2017 they partnered with the Chinese fellow smart city of Yinchuan.

==Infrastructure==
===Hospitals===
Milton Keynes University Hospital, in the Eaglestone district, is an NHS general hospital with an Accident and Emergency unit.
It is associated for medical teaching purposes with the University of Buckingham medical school. There are two small private hospitals: BMI Healthcare&#x27;s Saxon Clinic and Ramsay Health Care&#x27;s Blakelands Hospital.

===Prison===
There is a Category A male prison, HMP Woodhill, on the western boundary. A section of the prison is a Young Offenders Institution.

===Transport===


The Grand Union Canal, the West Coast Main Line, the A5 road and the M1 motorway provide the major axes that influenced the urban designers.

The urban area is served by seven railway stations. , and stations are on the West Coast Main Line and are served by local commuter services between London and Birmingham or Crewe. Milton Keynes Central is also served by inter-city services between London and Scotland, Wales and the North West and the West Midlands of England; express services to London take 35 minutes. Bletchley, , , and railway stations are on the Marston Vale line to .

The M1 motorway runs along the east flank of MK and serves it from junctions 13 and 14 within the environs of the city, and junctions 11a and 15 slightly further away via other connecting roads. The A5 road, designated as a trunk road, runs right through the west of the city centre, as a grade separated dual carriageway. Other main roads are the A509 to Wellingborough and Kettering, and the A421 and A422, both running west towards Buckingham (and Oxford) and east towards Bedford (and Cambridge). Additionally, the A4146 runs from (near) junction 14 of the M1 to Leighton Buzzard. Proximity to the M1 has led to construction of a number of distribution centres, including Magna Park at the south-eastern flank of Milton Keynes, near Wavendon and M1 J13.

Many long-distance coaches stop at the Milton Keynes Coachway, (beside M1 Junction 14), about from the centre and from Milton Keynes Central railway station. There is also a park and ride car park on the site. 

The city is also served by a number of local and regional bus services run by national operators such as Stagecoach and Arriva, with most regional services stopping at major centres in the city, such as CMK (including railway station), Bletchley, Wolverton and Magna Park. The City Council also operates an on demand bus service known as &quot;MK Connect&quot;, which serves the whole unitary authority area.

Milton Keynes is served by (and, via its Redway network, provides part of) routes 6 and 51 on the National Cycle Network.

The nearest international airport is London Luton and is easily reached by coach. Cranfield Airport, an airfield, is away.

==Demographics==


At the 2011 census, the population of the Milton Keynes urban area, including the adjacent Newport Pagnell and Woburn Sands, was 229,941. The population of the borough in total was 248,800, compared with a population of around 53,000 for the same area in 1961. In 2016, the Office for National Statistics estimated that the Borough population will reach 300,000 by 2025. The 2021 census records the population of the Milton Keynes Built-up Area as 264,349, and that of the Borough (now City) as 287,060.

According to the 2011 census, the average age of the population is lower than is typical for the UK&#x27;s 63 primary urban areas: 25.3% of the borough population were aged under 18 (5th place) and 13.4% were aged 65+ (57th out of 63). The mean age is 35.7 and the median age is 35. 18.5% of residents were born outside the UK (11th). At the 2011 census, the ethnic profile was 78.9% white, 3.4% mixed, 9.7% Asian/Asian British, 7.3% Black/African/Caribbean/Black British, and 0.7% other. The religious profile was that 62.0% of people were reported having a religion and 31.4% having none; the remainder declined to say: 52% are Christian, 5.1% Muslim, 3.0% Hindu; other religions each had less than 1% of the population.

==Economy, finances and business==


In 2014 and 2017, Milton Keynes ranked third in terms of contribution to the national economy, as measured by gross value added per worker, of the 63 largest conurbations in the UK. In 2020, its ranking slipped to seventh.

===Major businesses===
Milton Keynes has consistently benefited from above-average economic growth, ranked as one of the UK&#x27;s top five cities. In 2020 it was ranked sixth of 63 for business startups (per 10,000 people).

Milton Keynes is home to several national and international companies, notably 
Domino&#x27;s Pizza,
Marshall Amplification,
Mercedes-Benz, 
Suzuki, 
Volkswagen Group, 
Red Bull Racing, 
Network Rail, and Yamaha Music Europe.

Santander UK and the Open University are major employers locally.

===Small and medium enterprise===
In 2013, 99.4% of enterprises being SMEs, just 0.6% of businesses locally employ more than 250 people (but more than one third of employees), whereas 81.5% employ fewer than 10 people. The &#x27;professional, scientific and technical sector&#x27; contributes the largest number of business units, 16.7%. The retail sector is the largest contributor of employment. Milton Keynes has one of the highest number of business start-ups in England, but also of failures. Although education, health and public administration are important contributors to employment, the contribution is significantly less than the averages for England or the South East.

===Employment===
75% of the population is economically active, including 8.3% (of the population) who are self-employed. 90% work in service industries of various sorts (of which wholesale and retail is the largest sector) and 9% in manufacturing.

===Social inequality===
In 2015, the City of Milton Keynes had nine &quot;lower super output areas&quot; that are in the 10% most deprived in England, but also had twelve &#x27;lower super output areas&#x27; in the 10% least deprived in England. This contrast between areas of affluence and areas of deprivation in spite of a thriving local economy, inspired local charity The Community Foundation (in its 2016 &quot;Vital Signs&quot; report) to describe the position as a &quot;Tale of Two Cities&quot;.

In 2018, the number of homeless young people sleeping rough in tents around CMK attracted national headlines as it became the apex of a national problem of poverty, inadequate mental health care and unaffordable housing. On a visit to refurbishment and extension work on the YMCA building, Housing Minister Heather Wheeler declared that &quot;Nobody in this day and age should be sleeping on the street&quot;.

==Geography==
===Location and nearest settlements===
Milton Keynes is in south central England, at the northern end of the South East England region, about north-west of London.

The nearest larger towns are Northampton, Bedford, Luton and Aylesbury. The nearest larger cities are Coventry, Leicester, Cambridge, London and Oxford.

===Geology===
Its surface geology is primarily gently rolling Oxford clay or, more formally:

Its highest points are in the centre () and at Woodhill on the western boundary (). The lowest point of the urban area is in Newport Pagnell, where the Ouzel joins the Great Ouse ().

===Parks and environmental infrastructure===
Because of the (poorly drained) clay soils and the urban hard surfaces, the development corporation identified water runoff into the Ouzel and its tributaries as a significant risk to be managed and so put in place two large balancing lakes (Caldecotte and Willen) and a number of smaller detention ponds. These provide an important leisure amenity for most of the year. Building in the floodplains of the Ouse and Ouzel was precluded too, thus providing long-distance linear parks that are within easy reach of most residents.
The north basin of Willen Lake is a bird sanctuary.

The two Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Howe Park Wood and Oxley Mead, are the most significant of a number of important wildlife sites in and around MK.

Just outside the Milton Keynes urban area lies Little Linford Wood, a conservation site and nature reserve managed by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust. It is considered to be one of the best habitats for dormice.

===Climate===
Milton Keynes experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;) as is typical of almost all of the United Kingdom.

The nearest Met Office weather station is in Woburn, Bedfordshire, just outside the south eastern fringe of Milton Keynes. Recorded temperature extremes range from during July 2022, to as low as on 25 February 1947; this is the lowest temperature ever reported in England in February. On 20 December 2010, the temperature fell to
