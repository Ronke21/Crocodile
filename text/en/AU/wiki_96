<text>The Battle of Fontenoy took place on 11 May 1745 during the War of the Austrian Succession, near Tournai, then part of the Austrian Netherlands, now in Belgium. A French army of 50,000 under Marshal Saxe defeated a Pragmatic Army of roughly the same size, led by the Duke of Cumberland.

By 1745, five years of war had brought France close to financial bankruptcy, and the Austrian Netherlands seemed to offer the best opportunity for a decisive victory which would end it. In April 1745, Saxe besieged Tournai, a key strategic town on the upper Scheldt, compelling the main Allied army to march to its relief. Leaving 22,000 men to continue the siege, Saxe placed his main force about away in the villages of Antoing, Vezon and Fontenoy, along a naturally strong feature strengthened with defensive works.

After several unsuccessful flank assaults which incurred heavy casualties, an Allied infantry column of 15,000 attacked the French centre, before being repulsed. Covered by their cavalry, they retreated toward Brussels, abandoning Tournai which fell shortly afterwards. Many British troops were withdrawn in October to suppress the Jacobite rising of 1745, leaving France in control of the Austrian Netherlands.

However, Fontenoy failed to end the war, and in May 1746, Louis XV initiated peace talks, but negotiations dragged on for the next two years. Despite further French victories at Rocoux in 1746 and Lauffeld in 1747, their economic position continued to deteriorate. The war ended in November 1748 with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, under which France relinquished its gains in the Austrian Netherlands.

==Background: 1740 to 1745==

The immediate cause of the War of the Austrian Succession was the death in 1740 of Emperor Charles VI, the last male Habsburg in the direct line. The Habsburg monarchy was governed by Salic law, thus excluding his eldest daughter Maria Theresa from the throne, a condition waived by the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713.

The closest male heir was Charles of Bavaria, who challenged the legality of Maria Theresa&#x27;s succession. A family inheritance dispute became a European issue because the monarchy dominated the Holy Roman Empire, a federation of mostly German states, headed by the Holy Roman Emperor. Technically an elected position, in January 1742 Charles became the first non-Habsburg Emperor in 300 years, supported by France, Prussia and Saxony. Maria Theresa was backed by the so-called Pragmatic Allies; Austria, Britain, Hanover, and the Dutch Republic.

The main beneficiary from four years of conflict was Prussia, which captured the Austrian province of Silesia during the 1740–1742 First Silesian War. The richest province in the Empire, Silesian taxes provided ten per cent of total Imperial income and contained large mining, weaving and dyeing industries. Regaining it was a priority for Maria Theresa and led to the 1744–1745 Second Silesian War. Shortly after Charles died in January 1745, the Austrians over-ran Bavaria and defeated a Franco-Bavarian force at Pfaffenhofen on 15 April. Charles&#x27; son, Maximilian III Joseph, now sued for peace and supported the election of Maria Theresa&#x27;s husband, Francis Stephen, as the new Emperor. With Bavaria out of the war, Austria could focus on Silesia, while France was released from its involvement in Germany, and could concentrate on Italy and the Low Countries.

==1745 Campaign Plans==
In the first half of 1744, France made significant advances in the Austrian Netherlands, before being forced to divert resources to meet threats elsewhere. For the 1745 campaign, Maurice de Saxe persuaded Louis XV it was the best place to inflict a decisive defeat on Britain, whose financial resources were central to the Allied war effort. His plan was to bring the Allies to battle on a ground of his choosing, before British financial strength could be used to fund extra troops and negate the current French superiority in numbers. Saxe also benefitted from a unified command and strategy, unlike the Allies who were often deeply divided over objectives and priorities.

Most of the fighting in this region took place in what is often referred to as Flanders, a compact area wide, its highest point only above sea level and dominated by rivers running southwest to northeast. Until the advent of railways in the 19th century, bulk goods and supplies were transported by water, and wars in this region were fought for control of major waterways, including the rivers Lys, Sambre and Meuse.

The most important of these was the Scheldt, which began in Northern France and ran for before entering the North Sea at Antwerp. Saxe planned to attack Tournai, a town close to the French border which controlled access to the upper Scheldt basin, making it a vital link in the trading network for Northern Europe. With a garrison of over 8,000, it was also the strongest of the Dutch Barrier Treaty forts in the Austrian Netherlands, factors Saxe hoped would force the Allies to fight for it.

In March 1745, George Wade was replaced as Allied commander in Flanders by the 24-year-old Duke of Cumberland, advised by the experienced Earl Ligonier. In addition to British and Hanoverian troops, the Pragmatic Army included a large Dutch contingent, commanded by Prince Waldeck, with a small number of Austrians, led by Count Königsegg-Rothenfels. However, a coherent Allied strategy was undermined by internal disputes and different objectives. The British and Hanoverians resented and mistrusted each other, Austria did not consider Flanders a military priority and Waldeck was unpopular with his subordinates, who often disputed his orders. These divisions were exacerbated by Cumberland&#x27;s inexperience, lack of diplomatic skill and tendency to ignore advice.

On 21 April, a French cavalry detachment under D&#x27;Estrées feinted towards Mons and Cumberland prepared to march to its relief. Although it soon became clear this was a diversion, French intentions remained unclear until the siege of Tournai began on 28 April. Combined with faulty intelligence that estimated Saxe had less than 30,000 men, this meant the Allies advanced on Tournai with only their field army of 50,000, leaving large garrisons at nearby Namur and Charleroi. Having confirmed the Allies were approaching from the south-east, on 7 May Saxe left 22,000 men to continue the siege, and placed his main force of 50,000 around the villages of Fontenoy and Antoing, from Tournai.

==Battle==

As Saxe considered his infantry inferior to their opponents, he placed them behind defensive works and fortified the villages. The French line ran along the crest of a plateau, the right flank resting on the Scheldt, the left stationed behind the &quot;Bois de Barry&quot;, with the &quot;Redoubt d&#x27;Eu&quot; and &quot;Redoubt de Chambonas&quot; covering the gap between the wood and their centre in the village of Fontenoy. From there, the &quot;Chemin de Mons&quot; sloped down to the hamlets of Vezon and Bourgeon below, exposing any frontal attack to prolonged fire from three sides.

The Allies made contact with the French outposts on the evening of 9 May, but a hasty reconnaissance by Cumberland and his staff failed to spot the &quot;Redoubt d&#x27;Eu&quot;. On 10 May, British and Hanoverian cavalry under James Campbell pushed the French out of Vezon and Bourgeon. Campbell&#x27;s deputy, the Earl of Crawford, then recommended that infantry be sent to clear the &quot;Bois de Barry&quot;, while the cavalry swung around it to outflank the French left. Unfortunately, this plan was abandoned when Dutch hussars reconnoitring the route were fired on by French troops in the wood and withdrew.

The attack was postponed until the following day, both armies camping overnight on their positions. At 4:00 a.m. on 11 May, the Allies formed up, British and Hanoverians on the right and centre, Dutch on the left, with the Austrians in reserve. The Dutch were ordered to take Fontenoy and Antoing, while a brigade under Richard Ingoldsby captured the &quot;Redoubt de Chambonas&quot;, and cleared the &quot;Bois de Barry&quot;. Once both flanks were engaged, massed Allied infantry in the centre under Ligonier would advance up the slope, and dislodge the main French army.

As soon as it was light, the Allied artillery opened fire on Fontenoy, but the bombardment had little effect on the dug-in French infantry. Because Cumberland had badly under-estimated French numbers, he assumed their main force was in the centre, and failed to appreciate the strength of the flanking positions. This meant the true strength of the French left only became apparent when Ingoldsby ran into the &quot;Redoubt d&#x27;Eu&quot;. He requested artillery support, and the advance halted while his men skirmished in the woods with light troops known as &quot;Harquebusiers de Grassins&quot;. Although these probably numbered less than 900, Ingoldsby was uncertain of their strength and advanced with extreme caution. This was understandable given the earlier failure to detect the redoubt, but delayed the main attack.

Growing impatient, at 7:00 a.m., Cumberland ordered Ingoldsby to abandon his assault on the &quot;Redoubt d&#x27;Eu&quot; and join the main column, although he failed to inform Ligonier. As the Dutch advanced on Fontenoy, they were fired on by French troops in the nearby walled cemetery and fell back with heavy losses. At 9:00 a.m., Ligonier sent an aide instructing Ingoldsby to attack the &quot;Redoubt d&#x27;Eu&quot; immediately and was apparently horrified when Ingoldsby shared his change of orders. At 10:30 a.m., the Dutch assaulted Fontenoy again, supported by the 42nd Foot; after some initial success, they were forced to retreat, and at 12:30 p.m., Cumberland ordered the central column forward.

Thought to comprise some 15,000 infantry, the column advanced up the slope led by Cumberland and Ligonier, and despite heavy casualties reached the French position still in formation. After halting to dress their lines, the Guards in the first rank allegedly invited the &quot;Gardes Françaises&quot; to open fire. First reported by Voltaire in 1768, there is some doubt as to the reliability of this anecdote, but the opening volley was considered so important that commanders often preferred their opponents to go first, particularly if their own troops were well disciplined and thus able to absorb it without losing cohesion.

Thus goaded, the &quot;Gardes&quot; fired prematurely, greatly reducing the impact of their first volley. That of the British killed or wounded 700 to 800 men, and the French front line broke up in confusion. Many of their reserves had been transferred to meet the Dutch attack on Fontenoy, and the Allies now advanced into this gap. Seeing this, Noailles, who was observing the fighting from a position near &quot;Notre Dame de Bois&quot; along with Louis XV and his son, implored the king to seek safety. However, Saxe assured Louis the battle was not lost, while Löwendal ordered a series of cavalry attacks, which although poorly co-ordinated forced the Allies back. 

Isolated in the middle of the column, Cumberland had lost control of the main battle and made no attempt to relieve pressure on the Allied centre by ordering fresh attacks on Fontenoy or the &quot;Redoubt d&#x27;Eu&quot;. Under fire from both flanks and in front, the column formed itself into a hollow, three sided square, reducing their firepower advantage. Their cavalry charges gave the French infantry time to reform, and at 14:00 Saxe brought up his remaining artillery, which began firing into the Allied square at close range. This was followed by a general assault, with the &quot;d&#x27;Aubeterre, du Roi, Royal&quot; and &quot;de la Couronne&quot; attacking from the right, the Irish Brigade, &quot;des Vaisseaux, Normandie, d&#x27;Eu&quot; and two battalions of the &quot;Gardes françaises&quot; from the left. 

The assault incurred heavy casualties, the &quot;Aubeterre&quot; regiment losing 328 wounded or killed, the four battalions of the &quot;Régiment Royal&quot; a total of 675, and the Irish Brigade 656. Despite this, Saxe and Löwendal led the &quot;Gardes Françaises&quot; in a second attack, while D&#x27;Estrées and Richelieu brought up the elite &quot;Maison du roi&quot; cavalry, forcing the column back with heavy losses. The Hanoverian &quot;Böselager&quot; regiment suffered 377 casualties, the largest of any single Allied unit, the 23rd Foot lost 322, and the three Guards regiments over 700 in total. 

Despite this, discipline and training allowed the Allied infantry to make an orderly withdrawal, the rearguard halting at intervals to fire on their pursuers. On reaching Vezon, the cavalry provided cover as they moved into columns of march, before withdrawing to Ath, largely undisturbed by the French. The decision was opposed by Waldeck and other Dutch officers, who were reluctant to abandon their garrison in Tournai; one of them later wrote that &quot;We were repulsed without being [defeated but ...] our hasty retreat makes us look beaten ...[while] we have left [much] baggage and many wounded&quot;. Next day, French cavalry captured 2,000 wounded Allied soldiers at Leuze, along with forty-four guns.

==Aftermath==
Fontenoy was the bloodiest battle in Western Europe since Malplaquet in 1709. French losses were an estimated 7,000 to 8,000 killed and wounded, those of the Allies between 7,400 and 12,000, including prisoners. Since his presence technically made him senior commander, Louis became the first French king to claim a battlefield victory over the English since Saint Louis. This fact was emphasised in a propaganda campaign, which included a laudatory poem by Voltaire, titled &quot;La Bataille De Fontenoy.&quot;

Victory restored French battlefield pre-eminence in Europe, although the best of the Allied infantry remained superior to their opponents. It also cemented Saxe&#x27;s reputation as one of the leading generals of the period, although his domestic opponents attacked him for not pursuing with more vigour. In response, he pointed out his troops were exhausted while the Allied cavalry and large parts of their infantry remained intact and fresh. These critics did not include either Louis XV or Frederick the Great, who viewed Fontenoy as a tactical masterpiece and invited Saxe to Sanssouci to discuss it. 

On the other hand, Cumberland performed poorly as a commander, ignoring advice from his more experienced subordinates, failing to ensure the &quot;Bois de Barry&quot; was properly cleared and issuing Ingoldsby with conflicting orders. Although praised for his courage, the inactivity of the Allied cavalry was partly due to his participation in the infantry attack, and loss of strategic oversight. Ligonier and others viewed Fontenoy as a &quot;defeat snatched from the jaws of victory&quot; and although understandable for a 24-year-old in his first major engagement, the same faults were apparent at the Battle of Lauffeld in 1747.

In the recriminations that followed, Ingoldsby was court martialled for the delay in attacking the &quot;Redoubt d&#x27;Eu&quot;, although his claim to have received inconsistent orders was clearly supported by the evidence. He himself was wounded, while the largest casualties of any units involved were incurred by two regiments from his brigade, the 12th Foot and &quot;Böselager&#x27;s&quot;. The court concluded his actions arose &#x27;from an error of judgement, not want of courage&#x27;, but he was forced out of the army, a decision many considered unjust. Cumberland and some of his staff also blamed the Dutch for not relieving pressure on the centre by continuing their attack on Fontenoy. Dutch cavalry commander Casimir van Schlippenbach echoed this criticism, although failure was largely due to the confusion caused by Cumberland himself, while the Dutch infantry retreated in good order.

Regardless, Waldeck was critical of the lack of initiative displayed by his troops, as was Isaac Cronström, head of the Dutch infantry. Born in 1661, the latter fought at Malplaquet, where the Dutch had continued to attack French entrenchments despite incurring very heavy casualties. In a letter to Grand Pensionary Anthonie van der Heim, he noted &quot;these troops are [not] like those in the previous war&quot;, while in his official report to the States General, Waldeck claimed &quot;the famous old Dutch courage&quot; had gone. These conclusions led to an intensive programme of retraining, and the Dutch performed significantly better at Rocoux in 1746. However, the war confirmed the decline of the Dutch Republic as a Great Power; Newcastle, whose foreign policy had assumed the opposite, later berated himself for his &quot;ignorance, obstinacy, and credulity&quot;, in believing otherwise.

With no hope of relief, Tournai surrendered on 20 June, followed by the loss of Ostend and Nieuport; in October, the British were forced to divert resources to deal with the Jacobite rising of 1745, allowing Saxe to continue his advance in 1746. Despite the presence of Dutch troops in the Pragmatic Army, France did not declare war on the Dutch Republic itself until 1747. This decision made their financial situation even worse, since French merchants had evaded the British naval blockade by transporting their goods in &quot;neutral&quot; Dutch ships. By the end of 1747, France had occupied most of the Austrian Netherlands and was on the verge of advancing into Dutch territory, but their economy was being strangled by the blockade, which was also causing widespread food shortages. Peace was a matter of extreme urgency and despite the huge military and financial costs incurred, under the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle Louis XV agreed to evacuate the Austrian Netherlands for minimal return, leading to a popular French phrase &quot;as stupid as the Peace&quot;.

===Legacy===
The participation of the Irish Brigade and the casualties incurred led 19th and early 20th-century Irish nationalists to portray Fontenoy as the &quot;pinnacle of Irish military valour&quot;, with the battle giving its name to a variety of streets, buildings and athletic clubs. In 1905, nationalist author Richard Barry O&#x27;Brien founded a committee to fund an Irish Brigade memorial in the village of Fontenoy, where it still features in annual commemorations of the battle.

When surveying the battlefield, Louis XV reportedly said: &quot;See how much blood a triumph costs. The blood of our enemies is still the blood of men. The true glory is to save it.&quot; In 1968, the French army installed a memorial in the neighbouring town of Vezon which bears this quotation.

<text>The Battle of Fleurus, fought on 1 July 1690 near Fleurus, then part of the Spanish Netherlands, now in modern Belgium, was a major engagement of the Nine Years&#x27; War. A French army led by Marshall Luxembourg defeated an Allied force under Waldeck.

Luxembourg&#x27;s victory had limited strategic impact, since Louis XIV of France ordered him to end his campaign in the Spanish Netherlands, and instead reinforce the Dauphin on the Rhine. This gave the Allies time to withdraw to Brussels, and rebuild their army.

==Background==
In 1690, the main theatre of the Nine Years&#x27; War moved from the Rhineland to the Spanish Netherlands. Defeat at Walcourt in August 1689 led to Humières being replaced as commander by Luxembourg, who retained the position until his death in 1695. His army consisted of around 30,000–40,000 men, while if necessary he could call upon support from Boufflers on the Moselle. With William III campaigning in Ireland, Waldeck, the victor of Walcourt, continued as commander of Allied forces in the region.

Waldeck had hoped to delay the campaign to enable the Elector of Brandenburg to move on the Moselle and tie down Boufflers, but Luxembourg&#x27;s early manoeuvres had allowed Boufflers to move between the rivers Sambre and Meuse to support the French commander. Waldeck, meanwhile, left his assembly point at Tienen (Tirlemont) and advanced to Wavre. After dispersing his troops to live off forage, the Allied army reassembled and advanced to Genappe on 8 June.

In mid-June Luxembourg split his forces. Humières was relegated to supervise the garrison of the Lines of the Lys and the Scheldt, whilst the main French army left Deinze and marched south, crossing the Sambre at Jeumont on 23 June. Meanwhile, detachments from Boufflers force under Rubantel had augmented Luxembourg&#x27;s army, which continued its march, camping at Boussu on 27 June.

As Luxembourg manoeuvred south of Mons and Charleroi, Waldeck moved his camp between Nivelles and Pieton on 28 June. That same evening, Luxembourg personally led a detachment from Gerpinnes with pontoons to establish a bridge across the Sambre at Ham. A fortified position at Froidmont (garrisoned by about 100 men) was soon compelled to surrender after artillery was brought across the river; a simultaneous attack by French dragoons seized an enemy redoubt that had been abandoned at the approach of Luxembourg&#x27;s army. With the bridgehead secure, the rest of the French army (apart from the heavy baggage that had remained on the south bank at Ham) crossed the Sambre on 30 June. (&quot;See map&quot;).

Waldeck decamped and moved towards the French bridgehead. French and Dutch cavalry sent out to reconnoitre the area crossed swords in an inconclusive action near Fleurus, but by evening the French cavalry had withdrawn to Velaine where it was joined by the rest of their army, only from the Allies.

==Battle==
On the morning of 1 July, Luxembourg marched his forces towards Fleurus. Waldeck had set up his 30,000-38,000 troops in the two customary lines on the high ground between the village of Heppignies on their right and past the chateau of St Amant on their left; Waldeck&#x27;s front was covered by the Orme stream whose elevated banks made a frontal assault all but impossible.

Luxembourg decided to attack both flanks of the Allied army simultaneously, an audacious plan whose success required secrecy and deception. The columns of the first French line split to take position between Heppignies and Fleurus, with some troops moving up towards St Amant. The two columns of Luxembourg&#x27;s right veered off to the north across the Orme, their passage covered by the hedges and wheat fields, and by a screen of French cavalry. Forty cannons were positioned near the chateau of St Amant, and another 30 guns positioned between the chateau and Fleurus.

Unnoticed by Waldeck, Luxembourg had enveloped his flanks. Had the Allied commander realised that Luxembourg had split his army in two, he might have overwhelmed the isolated French left before the right came into position, but he did not. After the French right wing was in position (commanded by Luxembourg himself), their artillery opened fire at about 10:00, striking the Allied infantry with great effect. The French left wing, commanded by Lieutenant-General Jean Christophe, comte de Gournay, opened their attack with a cavalry charge but Gournay was killed in the assault; his death disordered his cavalry which withdrew to Fleurus to regroup.

A French cavalry charge on the right wing however, met with more success, driving the enemy cavalry back. What ensued from that point on varies depending on the sources. John A. Lynn states that, on the heels of the cavalry assault, the French infantry now advanced against both flanks of Waldeck&#x27;s line which, finding itself enveloped, finally broke. Some of the Allied troops managed to regroup on high ground near Fleurus, but were eventually overwhelmed. Despite being pressed by French cavalry, Waldeck was able to create a new line with his remaining forces further back. However, this line also collapsed, broken by French infantry flushed with confidence from their initial success. The remainder of Waldeck&#x27;s troops streamed towards Nivelles in the best order they could.

According to &quot;Olaf Van Nimwegen&quot; however, on the critical moment Waldeck and Aylva found themselves enveloped by the French, they ordered the Dutch infantry to form squares. This succeeded and the advancing French cavalry was forced to break off the assault. The French infantry, ordered to march straight onto the enemy, also failed to break the squares after suffering heavy casualties. Luxembourg, noticing the senselessness of further assaults decided to break the Dutch infantry by bombarding the thick squares from close range with captured artillery. To his surprise, despite heavy casualties the Dutch retained formation, and one of his adjutants, who could no longer stand to see the bloodshed, tried to negotiate their capitulation. After the battle, Luxembourg wrote to Louivois that &quot;he told them that they were completely enveloped, that I (Luxembourg) was there and that I would spare them. They answered him: Leave, we want nothing, and are strong enough to defend ourselves.&quot; What followed was a stubborn rearguard action. Waldeck and Aylva moved the troops in squares in the direction of Mellet and from there to Brussels, while the Dutch battalions in the rear formed an alternating front to the French. Under this covering fire the troops under Waldeck left the battlefield. The Dutch right flank under Henry Casimir II and the Prince of Nassau-Usingen sought refuge in the vicinity of the guns of Charleroi.

==Aftermath==
Fleurus was one of the bloodiest battles of the age, with enormous losses on both sides, but casualty estimates vary greatly. According to Austrian historian Gaston Bodart, the French had 3,000 men killed and another 3,000 wounded, and the allies suffered 6,000 killed, 5,000 wounded and 8,000 captured. Périni writes that 612 officers and 3,000 soldiers were killed or wounded on the French side, and that the allies had 5,000 killed and 9,000 captured, but does not mention a number of wounded. Additionally, the French took 48 guns and 150 flags or standards. Van Nimwegen and John Childs, however, reduce allied casualties to 7,000 killed and wounded and argue that French losses were at least equal, but do not provide an estimate for the number of prisoners, a number some Dutch sources bring down to 3,000. The Allies also captured 34 banners and standards, which was rare for a losing side. Dutch historians have generally emphasized the bravery and skill of their infantry and like to quote Luxembourg, who is reported to have said that the Dutch foot soldiers surpassed those of the Spanish at Rocroi and that he wanted to remember them all his life. French historian François Guizot described Fleurus as a complete French victory, but one devoid of result. Louvois, Louis’ war minister, wanted to order Luxembourg to immediately besiege Namur or Charleroi, but Louis, concerned about the dauphin&#x27;s forces on the Rhine, ordered Luxembourg to detach part of his forces and forgo a major siege. Louvois objected, but King Louis wanted to be sure that nothing ‘disagreeable’ happened to his son&#x27;s command. Nevertheless, Luxembourg was able to put much of the land east of Brussels under contribution.

The French pressed the prisoners of war captured at Fleurus and in preceding events into their service. They sent the Germans to the army in Catalonia, the Walloons to Germany and the Dutch to Savoy. Many however escaped and made it back to allied territories.

Waldeck eventually retired on Brussels, where his injured troops were replaced with men from fortress garrisons. 15,000 Spanish troops under the Marquis of Gastañaga joined the main Allied army, as did Tilly with troops from Liège and Brandenburg on 22 July. On 2 August, the Elector of Brandenburg&#x27;s forces combined with Waldeck, whose Allied army now numbered 70,000 men. With this force, the Allied army marched to Genappe, proceeding on to Nivelles on 7 August. After the battle, there was modest satisfaction in the Dutch Republic. They believed that the French had suffered more soldiers killed or wounded and the French army was indeed in no better shape than that of the Allies to continue the campaign.

The remainder of the campaign season in the Spanish Netherlands was relatively quiet. Boufflers temporarily combined his forces with Luxembourg, but in late August he returned to the area between the Sambre and Meuse rivers. After a series of minor skirmishes, both the Allies and the French returned to winter quarters in October; Luxembourg careful to station his men on enemy territory, while the Allies quartered in and around Maastricht. The Hanoverians returned home, while many from Brandenburg and Lüneburg found quarters in the fortresses of the Spanish Netherlands.

Louis XIV had become so disillusioned with his infantry that he ordered Luxembourg to avoid infantry engagements in 1691. He believed such an engagement &quot;involves heavy losses and is never decisive&quot;.

<doc id="157100" wikidata="Q178912" url="?curid=157100" title="Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)">
<text>The Battle of Cape St. Vincent () was a naval battle that took place off the southern coast of Portugal on 16 January 1780 during the American Revolutionary War. A British fleet under Admiral Sir George Rodney defeated a Spanish squadron under Don Juan de Lángara. The battle is sometimes referred to as the Moonlight Battle () because it was unusual for naval battles in the Age of Sail to take place at night. It was also the first major naval victory for the British over their European enemies in the war and proved the value of copper-sheathing the hulls of warships.

Rodney was escorting a fleet of supply ships to relieve the Spanish siege of Gibraltar with a fleet of about twenty ships of the line when he encountered Lángara&#x27;s squadron south of Cape St. Vincent. When Lángara saw the size of the British fleet, he attempted to make for the safety of Cádiz, but the copper-sheathed British ships chased his fleet down. In a running battle that lasted from mid-afternoon until after midnight, the British captured four Spanish ships, including Lángara&#x27;s flagship &quot;Real Fénix&quot; (often just called &quot;Fenix&quot;). Two other ships were also captured, but they were retaken by their Spanish crews, although Rodney&#x27;s report claimed the ships were grounded and destroyed; in fact one went aground and was destroyed, while the other safely returned to Cadiz and resumed service with the Spanish Navy.

After the battle Rodney successfully resupplied Gibraltar and Minorca before continuing on to the British West Indies. Lángara was released on parole; his career did not suffer from the defeat, and he was promoted to lieutenant general by Charles III of Spain.

==Background==

One of Spain&#x27;s principal goals upon its entry into the American War of Independence in 1779 was the recovery of Gibraltar, which had been lost to Great Britain in 1704. The Spanish planned to retake Gibraltar by blockading and starving out its garrison, which included troops from Britain and the Electorate of Hanover. The siege formally began in June 1779, with the Spanish establishing a land blockade around the Rock of Gibraltar. The matching naval blockade was comparatively weak, however, and the British discovered that small fast ships could evade the blockaders, while slower and larger supply ships generally could not. By late 1779, however, supplies in Gibraltar had become seriously depleted, and its commander, General George Eliott, appealed to London for relief. A supply convoy was organized, and in late December 1779 a large fleet sailed from England under the command of Admiral Sir George Rodney. Although Rodney&#x27;s ultimate orders were to command the West Indies fleet, he had secret instructions to first resupply Gibraltar and Minorca. On 4 January 1780 the fleet divided, with ships headed for the West Indies sailing westward. This left Rodney in command of 19 ships of the line, which were to accompany the supply ships to Gibraltar.

On 8 January 1780 ships from Rodney&#x27;s fleet spotted a group of sails. Giving chase with their faster copper-clad ships, the British determined these to be a Spanish supply convoy that was protected by a single ship of the line and several frigates. The entire convoy was captured, with the lone ship of the line, &quot;Guipuzcoana&quot;, striking her colours after a perfunctory exchange of fire. &quot;Guipuzcoana&quot; was staffed with a small prize crew and renamed , in honour of Prince William, the third son of the King, who was serving as midshipman in the fleet. Rodney then detached and the frigate to escort most of the captured ships back to England; &quot;Prince William&quot; was added to his fleet, as were some of the supply ships that carried items likely to be of use to the Gibraltar garrison.

On 12 January , which had lost part of her topmast on 3 January, suffered additional damage and raised a distress flag. Assisted by , she limped into Lisbon on 16 January. The Spanish had learnt of the British relief effort. From the blockading squadron a fleet comprising 11 ships of the line under Admiral Juan de Lángara was dispatched to intercept Rodney&#x27;s convoy, and the Atlantic fleet of Admiral Luis de Córdova y Córdova at Cadiz was also alerted to try to catch him. Córdova learnt of the strength of Rodney&#x27;s fleet, and returned to Cadiz rather than giving chase. On 16 January the fleets of Lángara and Rodney spotted each other around 1:00 pm south of Cape St. Vincent, the southwestern point of Portugal and the Iberian Peninsula. The weather was hazy, with heavy swells and occasional squalls.

==Battle==
Rodney was ill, and spent the entire action in his bunk. His flag captain, Walter Young, urged Rodney to give orders to engage when the Spanish fleet was first spotted, but Rodney only gave orders to form a line abreast. Lángara started to establish a line of battle, but when he realised the size of Rodney&#x27;s fleet, he gave orders to make all sail for Cadiz. Around 2:00 pm, when Rodney felt certain that the ships seen were not the vanguard of a larger fleet, he issued commands for a general chase. Rodney&#x27;s instructions to his fleet were to chase at their best speed, and engage the Spanish ships from the rear as they came upon them. They were also instructed to sail to the lee side to interfere with Spanish attempts to gain the safety of a harbour, a tactic that also prevented the Spanish ships from opening their lowest gun ports. Because of their copper-sheathed hulls (which reduced marine growths and drag), the ships of the Royal Navy were faster and soon gained on the Spanish.

The chase lasted for about two hours, and the battle finally began around 4:00 pm. &quot;Santo Domingo&quot;, trailing in the Spanish fleet, received broadsides from , , and before blowing up around 4:40, with the loss of all but one of her crew. &quot;Marlborough&quot; and &quot;Ajax&quot; then passed &quot;Princessa&quot; to engage other Spanish ships. &quot;Princessa&quot; was eventually engaged in an hour-long battle with before striking her colours at about 5:30. By 6:00 pm it was getting dark, and there was a discussion aboard , Rodney&#x27;s flagship, about whether to continue the pursuit. Although Captain Young is credited in some accounts with pushing Rodney to do so, Gilbert Blane, the fleet physician, reported it as a decision of the council.

The chase continued into the dark, squally night, leading to it later being known as the &quot;Moonlight Battle&quot;, since it was uncommon at the time for naval battles to continue after sunset. At 7:30 pm, came upon Lángara&#x27;s flagship , engaging her in a battle lasting over an hour. She was broadsided in passing by and , and Lángara was wounded in the battle. The &quot;Real Fénix&quot; finally surrendered to , which arrived late in the battle and shot away her mainmast. &quot;Real Fénix&quot; takeover was complicated by an outbreak of smallpox aboard &quot;Bienfaisant&quot;. Captain John MacBride, rather than sending over a possibly infected prize crew, apprised Lángara of the situation and put him and his crew on parole. At 9:15 &quot;Montagu&quot; engaged &quot;Diligente&quot;, which struck after her maintopmast was shot away. Around 11:00 pm &quot;San Eugenio&quot; surrendered after having all of her masts shot away by , but the difficult seas made it impossible to board a prize crew until morning.

That duel was passed by and &quot;Prince George&quot;, which engaged &quot;San Julián&quot; and compelled her to surrender around 1:00 am. The last ship to surrender was &quot;Monarca&quot;. She nearly escaped, shooting away &#x27;s topmast, but was engaged in a running battle with the frigate HMS &quot;Apollo&quot;. &quot;Apollo&quot; managed to keep up the unequal engagement until about the time that Rodney&#x27;s flagship &quot;Sandwich&quot; came upon the scene around 2:00 am. &quot;Sandwich&quot; fired a broadside, unaware that &quot;Monarca&quot; had already hauled down her flag. The British took six ships. Four Spanish ships of the line and the fleet&#x27;s two frigates escaped, although sources are unclear if two of the Spanish ships were even present with the fleet at the time of the battle. Lángara&#x27;s report states that &quot;San Justo&quot; and &quot;San Genaro&quot; were not in his line of battle (although they are listed in Spanish records as part of his fleet). According to one account two of Lángara&#x27;s ships (the two aforementioned) were despatched to investigate other unidentified sails sometime before the action. Rodney&#x27;s report states that &quot;San Justo&quot; escaped but was damaged in battle, and that &quot;San Genaro&quot; escaped without damage.
==Aftermath==

With the arrival of daylight, it was clear that the British fleet and their prize ships were dangerously close to a lee shore with an onshore breeze. One of the prizes, &quot;San Julián&quot;, was recorded by Rodney as too badly damaged to save, and was driven ashore. Another prize, &quot;San Eugenio&quot;, was retaken by her crew and managed to reach Cadiz; she was later restored to service within two months, and remained so until taken to pieces at Cadiz in 1804. A Spanish history claims that the prize crews of both ships appealed to their Spanish captives for help escaping the lee shore. The Spanish captains retook control of their ships, imprisoned the British crews, and sailed to Cadiz. The British reported their casualties in the battle as 32 killed and 102 wounded. The supply convoy sailed into Gibraltar on 19 January, driving the smaller blockading fleet to retreat to the safety of Algeciras. Rodney arrived several days later, after first stopping in Tangier. The wounded Spanish prisoners, who included Lángara, were offloaded there, and the British garrison was heartened by the arrival of the supplies and the presence of Prince William Henry.

After also resupplying Minorca, Rodney sailed for the West Indies in February, detaching part of the fleet for service in the Channel. This homebound fleet intercepted a French fleet destined for the East Indies, capturing one warship and three supply ships. Gibraltar was resupplied twice more before the siege was lifted at the end of the war in 1783. Lángara and other captured Spanish officers were eventually released on parole, with Charles III of Spain promoting Lángara to lieutenant general. He continued to serve in the Spanish navy, being appointed as the naval minister during the French Revolutionary Wars. Rodney was lauded for his victory, the first major victory of the war by the Royal Navy over its European opponents. He distinguished himself for the remainder of the war, notably winning the 1782 Battle of the Saintes in which he captured French Admiral François Joseph Paul de Grasse. He was, however, criticised by Captain Young, who portrayed him as weak and indecisive in the battle with Lángara. (He was also rebuked by the admiralty for leaving a ship of the line at Gibraltar, against his express orders.) Rodney&#x27;s observations on the benefits of copper sheathing in the victory were influential in British Admiralty decisions to deploy the technology more widely.

==Order of battle==

None of the listed sources give an accurate accounting of the ships in Rodney&#x27;s fleet at the time of the action. Robert Beatson lists the composition of the fleet at its departure from England, and notes which ships separated to go to the West Indies, as well as those detached to return the prizes captured on 8 January to England. He does not list two ships (&quot;Dublin&quot; and &quot;Shrewsbury&quot;, identified in despatches reprinted by Syrett) that were separated from the fleet on 13 January. Furthermore, HMS &quot;Prince William&quot; is sometimes misunderstood to have been part of the prize escort back to England, but she was present at Gibraltar after the action. Beatson also fails to list a number of frigates, including &quot;Apollo&quot;, which played a key role in the capture of &quot;Monarca&quot;.
There are some discrepancies between the English and Spanish sources listing the Spanish fleet, principally in the number of guns most of the vessels are claimed to mount. The table below lists the Spanish records describing Lángara&#x27;s fleet. However, Beatson lists all of the Spanish ships of the line at 70 guns, except &quot;Real Fénix&quot;, which he correctly lists at 80 guns), and the &quot;San Julián&quot;, which he incorrectly gives as 64 guns. Spanish archives confirm this except for &quot;San Julián&quot;. 

One frigate, &quot;Santa Rosalia&quot;, is listed by Beatson at 28 guns, although she was actually 26 guns. The identify of the second Spanish frigate is different in the two listings. Beatson records her as &quot;Santa Gertrudis&quot;, 26 guns, with captain Don Annibal Cassoni, while Duro&#x27;s listing describes her as &quot;Santa Cecilia&quot;, 34, captain Don Domingo Pérez de Grandallana; Spanish archives confirm the latter. Both frigates did not participate in the battle, and returned to Cadiz.

<text>Address terms are linguistic expressions used by a speaker to start conversation or call someone. George Yule defines address form as a word or phrase that is used for a person to whom speaker wants to talk. Address forms or address terms are social oriented and expose the social relationship of interlocutors. Maloth explains &quot;when we address a person we should use suitable term depending on the appropriate situation where we are in&quot;. Moreover social situations determine the use of a suitable address form for a person. A style of office, also called manner of reference, or form of address when someone is spoken to directly, is an official or legally recognized form of reference for a person or other entity (such as a government or company), and may often be used in conjunction with a personal title. A style, by tradition or law, precedes a reference to a person who holds a post or political office and is sometimes used to refer to the office itself. An honorific can also be awarded to an individual in a personal capacity. Such styles are particularly associated with monarchies, where they may be used by a wife of an office holder or of a prince of the blood, for the duration of their marriage. They are also almost universally used for presidents in republics and in many countries for members of legislative bodies, higher-ranking judges, and senior constitutional office holders. Leading religious figures also have styles.

The second-person (singular and plural) possessive adjective &quot;your&quot; is used as a form of address (that is, when speaking directly to the person[s] entitled to the style[s]); the third-person possessive adjectives &quot;his/her&quot;&#x27; (singular) and &quot;their&quot; (plural) are used as forms of reference (that is, when speaking about the person[s] entitled to the style[s]).

The female equivalent is doña (), donna (), and dona (), abbreviated &quot;Dª&quot; or simply &quot;D.&quot; In formal settings, it is a title reserved for royalty, select nobles, knights, dames, and church hierarchs. Informally, it is sometimes used as a mark of esteem for a person of personal, social or official distinction, such as a community leader of long standing, or a person of significant wealth.

In Saudi Arabia, it is used as the official title of the king, in place of &quot;His Majesty&quot;.
*Amīr al-Mu&#x27;minīn (), usually translated Commander of the Faithful or Leader of the Faithful, is the Arabic style of some Caliphs and other independent sovereign Muslim rulers that claim legitimacy from a community of Muslims. It has been claimed as the title of rulers in Muslim countries and empires and is still used for some Muslim leaders. The use of the title does not necessarily signify a claim to caliphate as it is usually taken to be, but described a certain form of activist leadership which may have been attached to a caliph but also could signify a level of authority beneath that. The Ottoman sultans, in particular, made scant use of it. Moreover, the term was used by men who made no claim to be caliphs. Used by the former leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Ahmadiyya Muslim leader Mirza Masroor Ahmad, the King of Morocco, the Sultan of Sokoto, and the supreme leaders of the Afghan Taliban.
*Kabiyesi (variously translated as His or Her Royal Majesty, His or Her Royal Highness or His or Her Highness, lit. &quot;The One whose words are beyond question&quot;) – Used by the Obas of Yorubaland, other aboriginal Yoruba high chiefs of royal background, and their counterparts in the tribe&#x27;s diaspora communities.

=====Styles and titles of deposed monarchs=====

General tradition indicates that monarchs who have ceased to reign but not renounced their hereditary titles, retain the use of their style and title for the duration of their lifetimes, but both die with them. Hence, prior to his death, Greece&#x27;s deposed king was still styled &quot;His Majesty King Constantine II&quot;, as a &quot;personal&quot; title, not as occupant of a constitutional office, since the abolition of the monarchy by the Hellenic Republic in 1974. Similarly, until his death, the last King of Italy, Umberto II, was widely referred to as &quot;King Umberto II&quot; and sometimes addressed as &quot;Your Majesty&quot;. In contrast, Simeon of Bulgaria who, subsequent to the loss of his throne in 1947, was elected to and held the premiership of his former realm as &quot;Simeon Sakskoburggotski&quot;, and therefore is as often referred to by the latter name as by his former royal title and style.

While this rule is generally observed, and indeed some exiled monarchs are allowed diplomatic passports by their former realm, other republics officially object to the use of such titles which are, nonetheless, generally accorded by extant monarchical regimes. In 1981, the then Greek President Konstantinos Karamanlis declined to attend the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales when it was revealed that Greece&#x27;s deposed monarch, a cousin of the Prince, had been referred to as &quot;King&quot; in his invitation. The current Hellenic Republic has challenged King Constantine&#x27;s right to use his title and his passport was revoked in 1994 because he did not use a surname, as his passport at the time stated &quot;Constantine, former King of the Hellenes&quot;. However, Constantine II later travelled in and out of Greece on a Danish diplomatic passport as a descendant of Christian IX of Denmark, by the name &quot;Constantino de Grecia&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Constantine of Greece&quot;).

====Republics====

*His/Her Excellency (abbreviation &quot;HE&quot;, oral address &quot;Your Excellency&quot;) – Presidents of republics (historically, this was first used to refer to George Washington during his tenure as Commander-in-Chief of the Army during the American War of Independence; its use for presidents of republics was established as he was the first president of the first modern republic). In some countries also the prime minister, ministers, governors, ambassadors and high commissioners also use this style.
*The President of the United States is properly directly addressed as &quot;Mr./Madam President&quot; and introduced as &quot;The President of the United States&quot;; however, His/Her/Your Excellency may properly be used in written communications and is sometimes used in official documents.
*The custom in France is to call office holders acting within their official capacity or followed by the name of their offices. Thus, the President of the Republic is called or if a male, and if a female. Styles such as &quot;excellency&quot; or similar are not used, except for talking about foreign dignitaries. Traditionally after &quot;Madame&quot;, the name of the office is not put into the feminine form, but this is becoming less common (hence, &quot;Madame le président&quot; is being replaced by &quot;Madame la présidente&quot;).
*In Italy, members of the lower house (Chamber of Deputies) of the Parliament of Italy are styled &quot;Honourable&quot; (, abbreviation ). The correct form to address a member of the upper house (Senate) is &quot;Senator&quot; (, abbreviation ; even though, for gravitas, they may also be addressed &quot;Honourable Senator&quot;).
*The incumbent president of Finland is addressed (Mr./Ms. President of the Republic), while a former president is addressed as just .
*The style used for the President of Ireland is normally His Excellency/Her Excellency (); sometimes people may orally address the President as &#x27;Your Excellency&#x27; ( [ə ˈhəʎʃə]), or simply &#x27;President&#x27; ( [ə ˈuəxt̪ˠəɾˠaːnˠ] (vocative case)).

Such graduates are addressed as &quot;doctor&quot; by courtesy and convention.
*Mr, Miss, Ms, or Mrs – Surgeons in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and other Commonwealth or former Commonwealth nations revert to the title &quot;Mr&quot;, &quot;Miss&quot;, &quot;Ms&quot; or &quot;Mrs&quot; after obtaining the postgraduate qualification MRCS. Other specialist doctors (&quot;physicians&quot; in the sense of specialists in different areas of internal medicine, as used generally outside North America), on the other hand, retain the title &quot;Dr&quot; after obtaining other postgraduate qualifications, such as MRCP. Medical practitioners who are both &quot;physicians and surgeons&quot; are called either &quot;Dr&quot; or &quot;Mr&quot;, &quot;Ms&quot;, etc. and the style used at any specific time may be varied according to the context.

===Nautical and aeronautical===
*Captain – a person who commands and is responsible for the lives of crew and passengers on a naval or civil vessel or aircraft.

Generally the vast majority of the members of these royal families use the titles Prince and Princess, while the higher ranked amongst them also use either Highness or Royal Highness to describe secondary appellations in their native languages that they hold in their realms, appellations that are intended to highlight their relative proximity to their thrones, either literally in the sense of the extant kingships of the continent or symbolically in the sense of its varied chiefships of the name, and which therefore serve a function similar to the said styles of Highness and Royal Highness.

For example, the Yoruba people of West Africa usually make use of the word Kabiyesi when speaking either to or about their sovereigns and other royals. As such, it is variously translated as Majesty, Royal Highness or Highness depending on the actual rank of the person in question, though a literal translation of the word would read more like this: &quot;He (or She) whose words are beyond questioning, Great Lawgiver of the Nation&quot;.

Within the Zulu Kingdom of Southern Africa, meanwhile, the monarch and other senior royals are often addressed as uNdabezitha meaning &quot;He (or She) Who Concerns the Enemy&quot;, but rendered in English as Majesty in address or reference to the king and his consorts, or Royal Highness in the case of other senior members of the royal family.

===Hong Kong===
The Chief Executive is styled as The Honourable.

Certain senior government officials (such as the Chief Secretary for Administration), President of the Legislative Council, members of the Executive Council, and members of the judiciary (such as the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal) are also styled as &quot;The Honourable&quot;.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, holders of offices with Irish names are usually addressed in English by its nominative form (so, &#x27;Taoiseach&#x27; and &#x27;Tánaiste&#x27;), though the Irish vocative forms differ (&quot;a Thaoisigh&quot; and &quot;a Thánaiste&quot;). The President may be styled &#x27;His/Her Excellency&#x27; (, / &quot;A Soilse&quot; ) and addressed &#x27;Your Excellency&#x27; (Irish: &quot;A Shoilse&quot;), or simply &#x27;President&#x27; (Irish: &quot;A Uachtaráin&quot; ). The titles &#x27;Minister&#x27; and &#x27;Senator&#x27; are used as forms of address; only the latter as a style. A TD (&quot;Teachta Dála&quot;) is formally addressed and styled as &#x27;Deputy&#x27;, though often simply &quot;Mr.&quot;, &quot;Mrs.&quot;, etc. Similarly, county and city councillors can be addressed as &#x27;Councillor&#x27;, abbreviated &quot;Cllr.&quot; which is used as a written style, but are just as frequently addressed as &quot;Mr.&quot;, &quot;Mrs.,&quot; etc.

===Philippines===
*His/Her Excellency – The president of the Philippines. The title in Filipino is (The Well-Esteemed President).

The title in Filipino is (The Honorable). In Senate and congressional inquiries, impeachment procedures, and electoral canvasses, senators, representatives, and officials of the Commission on Elections when they convene as provincial and national boards of canvassers, are mostly addressed as &quot;Your Honor&quot;, because it was unfortunately rendered from &quot;the Spanish term for addressing parliamentarians, and a mistake made&quot; when Congress&#x27;s predecessor, the Philippine Legislature, abruptly changed to the use of English from &quot;mainly Spanish in its deliberations.&quot;

====Styles existing through marriage in the United Kingdom====
Styles can be acquired through marriage, although traditionally this applies more to wives of office-holders than to husbands. Thus, in the United Kingdom, Anne, Princess Royal, is styled Her Royal Highness (HRH), her husband, Sir Timothy Laurence, bears no courtesy style by virtue of being her husband (although his mother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II, has since knighted him), nor do her children bear any title or style, by right or tradition, despite being in the line of succession to the Crown, until 2015 subject to the Royal Marriages Act 1772. In contrast, when Sophie Rhys-Jones married Prince Edward, she became HRH the Countess of Wessex (&amp;c.) and their children are entitled (although they do not use them) to the princely prefix and the style of HRH, and do bear courtesy titles derived from their father.

Styles and titles can change when a marriage is dissolved. The Lady Diana Frances Spencer held the style Her Royal Highness during her marriage to HRH The Prince of Wales and the title Princess of Wales. When the couple divorced she lost her style: she became instead &quot;Diana, Princess of Wales&quot;. (although she fit the criteria which customarily accords the prefix of &quot;Lady&quot; to the daughter of an earl, and she had been known as such prior to marriage, she did not revert to that title following divorce).

When applied to the current Princess of Wales, inclusion of a definite article (&quot;The Princess of Wales&quot;), is, like HRH, part of the style which accompanies the title. When King Charles III (Then; HRH the Prince of Wales) was remarried to Camilla Parker-Bowles in compliance with the Royal Marriages Act, she lawfully became HRH The Princess of Wales but, as was the announced intention prior to the couple&#x27;s wedding, she continues to use the lesser title derived from her husband&#x27;s Duchy of Cornwall and was known as HRH The Duchess of Cornwall, until the accession of her husband as King, because of the strong association to the late Diana, Princess of Wales.

From the divorce until her death in 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales ceased to hold any royal style, although the monarch declared that she remained a Princess of the United Kingdom and in occasions when members of the Royal Family appeared in public, she continued to be accorded the same royal precedence.

When Sarah Ferguson was divorced from her husband, HRH Prince Andrew, Duke of York, she too lost her HRH style, the rank as a British Princess and was re-styled as &quot;Sarah, Duchess of York&quot;.

In 1936, Wallis Simpson was denied the HRH style by George VI when she married his older brother, the former Edward VIII, who became HRH the Duke of Windsor following his abdication and receipt of a peerage.

===United States===
The names of most current and former elected federal and state officials and judges in the United States are styled &quot;The Honorable&quot; in writing, (e.g., &quot;The Honorable Mike Rawlings, Mayor of the City of Dallas&quot;). Many are addressed by their title in conversation as &quot;Mister&quot; or &quot;Madam&quot; (&quot;Mr. President&quot;, &quot;Madam Mayor&quot;) or simply by their name with their appropriate title e.g., &quot;Senator Jones&quot; or &quot;Commissioner Smith&quot;.

Continued use of a title after leaving office depends on the office: those of which there is only one at a time (e.g., president, speaker, governor, or mayor) are only officially used by the current office holder. However, titles for offices of which there are many concurrent office holders (e.g., ambassador, senator, judge, professor or military ranks, especially colonel and above) are retained for life: A retired U.S. Army general is addressed as &quot;General (Name)&quot; officially and socially for the rest of their life. Military retirees are entitled to receive pay and are still counted as members of the United States Armed Forces. Accordingly, all retired military ranks are retained for life pursuant to Title 10 of the United States Code. In the case of the President, while the title is officially dropped after leaving office – e.g., Dwight Eisenhower reverted to his prior style &quot;General Eisenhower&quot; in retirement – it is still widely used as an informal practice; e.g., Jimmy Carter was often called President Carter during his lifetime. The Vice President is typically referred to as &quot;former Vice President&quot;, such as &quot;former Vice President Mike Pence.&quot; Similarly, governors are typically addressed in later life as &quot;Governor (Name)&quot;, particularly if running for further political office. Mitt Romney, for example, was frequently referred to as &quot;Governor Romney&quot; during his 2012 presidential campaign and was addressed as such formally in the debates, having been Governor of Massachusetts until 2007.

*The names of judges are styled &quot;The Honorable&quot; in writing, and orally in court as &quot;Your Honor&quot;, or by name after &quot;Judge&quot;. Chief justices of supreme courts are addressed orally as &quot;Mr. or Madam Chief Justice&quot; or &quot;Chief Justice&quot;; associate justices by name with &quot;Justice&quot; (or, simply &quot;Justice&quot;).
*The names of mayors are styled &quot;The Honorable&quot; in writing. In municipalities (e.g., New York City and Chicago), mayors are addressed in conversation as &quot;Your Honor&quot;. This may be a vestige of the fact that the mayors (and some others) were also magistrates of the court system.
*His or Her Excellency (oral address &quot;Excellency&quot;, &quot;Your Excellency&quot;) was once customarily used of governors of states, though this has given way to &quot;The Honorable&quot;, the form used to address all elected officials in the United States. &quot;Excellency&quot; has continued in the Commonwealths of Massachusetts and Virginia and the states of South Carolina, Georgia, New Hampshire, and Connecticut.
*The names of members of the House of Representatives are similarly styled in writing as &quot;The Honorable&quot;. Orally they are traditionally addressed by name as &quot;Mr.&quot; or &quot;Ms.&quot;, but as a practice are sometimes addressed as &quot;Representative&quot; or &quot;Congressman&quot; or &quot;Congresswoman&quot; when it is necessary or desirable to specify the member&#x27;s status. It is advisable to follow the preference of the individual official. Following precedence in Westminster style of parliament, when writing their own names, especially on stationery and franks, Representatives have upon occasion followed their names with &quot;M.C.&quot; (Member of Congress). The names of senators similarly are addressed in writing as &quot;The Honorable&quot; and orally as &quot;Senator&quot;. Where Representatives may have used &quot;M.C.&quot;, Senators have used &quot;U.S.S.&quot; (United States Senator). However, neither form is currently used by members in Washington, DC. On the actual floor of the houses during debate, members commonly refer to one another as the gentleman or gentlewoman from their appropriate state (e.g., &quot;As my friend, the distinguished gentleman from Ohio, just said...&quot; or &quot;I yield three minutes to the gentleman from New York, Mr. Smith&quot;). In debate, senators sometimes refer to colleagues as the junior or senior senator from a state, (e.g., &quot;I disagree with my dear friend, the junior senator from Ohio...&quot;). Senators also commonly use this form of address.
*While the term &quot;Esquire&quot;, abbreviated &quot;Esq.&quot; after the name (John Jones, Esq.), has no legal meaning in the U.S. and may be used by anyone (or at least, customarily, by any male), it is correctly used when addressing lawyers in correspondence as an indication of their profession. At least one American jurisdiction, the District of Columbia, limits the use of &quot;Esquire&quot; (and similar terms) to licensed attorneys. Although some authorities previously urged that use of &quot;Esq.&quot; should be restricted to male lawyers, today the term is used for both male and female attorneys. The academic post-nominal &quot;J.D.&quot; (Juris Doctor) may be used by graduates of law schools who are not members of the bar of any state or who are working outside the legal profession.
*In academic fields, it is customary in the U.S. to refer to those holding any level of professorship (professor, assistant professor, associate professor, adjunct professor, etc.) as &quot;Professor&quot; – as in &quot;Professor Jones&quot; – orally or in writing. In writing, &quot;professor&quot; is often abbreviated as &quot;Prof.&quot;, as in &quot;Prof. Jones&quot;. Those holding academic doctorates are frequently referred to as &quot;Dr. Jones.&quot;
*Military personnel of any functionality (doctors, lawyers, engineers, cooks, fighter pilots, motor pool drivers, commanding officers, security guards ... officers and enlisted ... leaders and followers) are always addressed by rank + name; with the exception of chaplains, who are addressed as &quot;Chaplain&quot; and are addressed in writing with their rank in parentheses, e.g.: &quot;Chaplain (Major) Jones&quot;. An exception to this is in the Navy, where in writing the rank is either not used, or is used before the person&#x27;s name with the corps designator &quot;CHC&quot; indicating the officer is a chaplain put behind their name. e.g.: &quot;LT George Burdell, CHC, USN&quot;. In the United States Navy, there is an internal practice aboard ships that junior officers who are not in command may be addressed by their rank or as &quot;Mister/Miss X&quot; as in &quot;Lieutenant Junior Grade Smith&quot; or &quot;Miss Smith&quot;. This practice is also followed within the United States Coast Guard, both aboard ship and ashore. Junior officers in both services are understood to be those of lieutenant commander and below. Senior officers (commander and above) are addressed by their rank as in &quot;Commander Smith&quot; or &quot;Admiral Smith&quot;. While officially this manner of address is supposed to be from a senior rank to a junior rank, i.e. captain to lieutenant, in practice it is not unknown for enlisted personnel to refer to junior officers as Mister as well. While commonly referred to by their rank, i.e. Seaman/Airman/Fireman/Petty Officer X or (Senior/Master) Chief X, on formal occasions, e.g. weddings, an enlisted man&#x27;s full title is sometimes used, starting with their rating, then their rank, and their name, e.g. Electronics Technician Second Class X or Chief Gunner&#x27;s Mate Y. When written, e.g. in formal invitations, the enlisted man&#x27;s name is written as &quot;&quot;Serviceman&#x27;s name&quot;, USN/USMC/USA/USAF/USCG&quot;, without one&#x27;s rank preceding their name, unlike commissioned officers.
*Any officer in command of a ship is referred to as Captain for the period of their command or in reference to the ship, regardless of what rank they normally hold.
*Retired military personnel may continue to be addressed by their rank at the time of their retirement. Those who held &#x27;brevet&#x27; ranks higher than their permanent rank (permanent Army officers who held temporary rank in volunteer regiments during the American Civil War) also held this honor; though all such individuals have now perished, this usage is often seen in historical or fictional sources placed in the 1865–1900 period.
* &quot;Hamilton v. Alabama&quot;, 376 U.S. 650 (1964), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the court held that an African-American woman, Mary Hamilton, was entitled to the same courteous forms of address customarily reserved solely for whites in the Southern United States, and that calling a black person by their first name in a formal context was &quot;a form of racial discrimination&quot;.

==Former styles==
All former monarchies had styles, some, such as those of the Bourbon monarchy of France, extremely complicated depending on the status of the office or office-holder. Otto von Habsburg, who was Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary (1916–1918), had the style &#x27;His Imperial and Royal Highness&#x27;. He was last addressed as such by church figures during the funeral of his late mother, Empress-Queen Zita of Austria-Hungary in 1989, although the use of these styles has been prohibited in Austria since 1920.

For the styles of address to government officials in Imperial Russia, see Table of Ranks.

The names of some offices are also titles, which are retained by the office holder for life. For example, holders of titles of which there are many at the same time, such as ambassadors, senators, judges, and military officers, who retire retain use of their hierarchical honorific for life. Holders of titles of which there is only one office holder at a time such as president, chief justice or speaker revert to their previous honorific when they leave office out of deference to the current office holder.

==Other parallel symbols==
Styles were often among the range of symbols that surrounded figures of high office. Everything from the manner of address to the behaviour of a person on meeting that personage was surrounded by traditional symbols. Monarchs were to be bowed to by men and curtsied to by women. Senior clergy, particularly in the Roman Catholic Church, were to have their rings (the symbol of their authority) kissed by lay persons while they were on bended knee, while cardinals in an act of homage at the papal coronation were meant to kiss the feet of the Supreme Pontiff, the Pope.

Many of these traditions have lapsed or been partially abandoned. At his inauguration as pope in 1978 (itself the abandonment of the traditional millennium-old papal coronation), Pope John Paul II himself kissed cardinals on the cheeks, rather than follow the traditional method of homage of having his feet kissed.

Similarly, styles, though still used, are used less often. The former President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, was usually referred to as &quot;President Mary McAleese&quot;, not &quot;President McAleese&quot;, as had been the form used for the first six presidents, from President Hyde to President Hillery. Tony Blair asked initially to be called &quot;Tony&quot;. First names, or even nicknames, are often widely used among politicians in the US, even in formal situations (as an extreme example, President James Earl &quot;Jimmy&quot; Carter chose to take the Oath of Office using his nickname). One notable exception involves judges: a judge of any court is almost invariably addressed as &quot;Your Honor&quot; while presiding over his or her court, and often at other times as well. This style has been removed in the Republic of Ireland, where judges are addressed only as &quot;Judge&quot;.

However, styles are still widely used in formal documents and correspondence between heads of state, such as in a letter of credence accrediting an ambassador from one head of state to another.

==Self-styled==
The term &quot;self-styled&quot;, or &quot;soi-disant&quot;, roughly means awarding a &quot;style&quot; to oneself, often without adequate justification or authority, but the expression often refers to descriptions or titles (such as &quot;aunt&quot;, &quot;expert&quot;, &quot;Doctor&quot;, or &quot;King&quot;), rather than true &quot;styles&quot; in the sense of this article.

==Notes==
1 Though the Republic of Ireland does not possess a Privy Council, the style is still used. The Lord Mayor of Dublin is still styled the Right Honourable, as previous lord mayors of Dublin were &quot;ex-officio&quot; members of the former Irish Privy Council until its abolition in 1922.

<text>The Battle of Lens (20 August 1648) was a French victory under Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Condé against the Spanish army under Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648). It was the last major battle of the war and a French victory. The battle cemented the reputation of Condé as one of the greatest generals of his age.

Over the four years following the decisive French victory at Rocroi against the Spanish Army of Flanders, the French captured dozens of towns throughout northern France and the Spanish Netherlands. Archduke Leopold Wilhelm was appointed governor of the Spanish Netherlands in 1647 to strengthen Spain&#x27;s Habsburg alliance with Austria, and began a major counteroffensive the same year. The Spanish army first found success recapturing the fortresses of Armentières, Comines and Landrecies.

The Prince de Condé was recalled from a failed campaign in Catalonia against the Spanish and appointed commander of the 16,000-man French army opposite the Spanish army of the Archduke and General Jean de Beck, the governor of Luxembourg. Condé captured Ypres but then the 18,000-strong Spanish-German force laid siege to Lens. Condé advanced to meet them.

In the battle that ensued, Condé provoked the Spanish into giving up a strong hilltop position for an open plain, where he used the discipline and superior close-combat capabilities of his cavalry to charge and rout the Walloon-Lorrainer cavalry on the Spanish wings. The French infantry and cavalry in the center were attacked by the strong Spanish center, suffering heavy losses but holding their ground. The French cavalry on the wings, freed from any opposition, encircled and charged the Spanish center, who promptly capitulated. The Spanish lost half their army, some 8,000–9,000 men of which 3,000 were killed or wounded and 5,000–6,000 captured, 38 guns, 100 flags along with their pontoons and baggage. French losses were 1,500 killed and wounded. The French victory contributed to the signing of the Peace of Westphalia but the outbreak of the Fronde rebellion prevented the French from exploiting their victory to the hilt against the Spanish.

==Background==
Lens is a fortified city in the historic region of Flanders, today a major city in the Pas-de-Calais region of northern France. The city had been captured by the French in 1647.

The Prince de Condé rushed from Catalonia to Flanders, and an army was cobbled together from Champagne, Lorraine, and Paris. The French army consisted of 16,000 men, 7,000 infantry and 9,000 cavalry, as well as 18 guns. The Spanish army was larger, comprising 18,000 men of equal halves of infantry and cavalry and 38 guns.

Leopold captured Lens on 17 August.

==Prelude==
On 20 August the opposing armies drew up west of Lens; the Spanish held a strong defensive position on the high ground. Leopold Wilhelm did not intend to fight a battle, as four of his cavalry regiments were out foraging.

===French Army===
The French right wing under Condé himself had 17 cavalry squadrons in two echelons. The center under Chatillon comprised 12 infantry battalions and six squadrons of cavalry. Commanded by Marshal Antoine Gramont, the left wing was composed of 16 cavalry squadrons. Six cavalry squadrons made up the reserve under Jean Louis d&#x27;Erlach. Formation-wise, the 12 infantry battalions were drawn up in lines eight ranks-deep, with each battalion having a strength of 600–700 men. The cavalry was in 45 squadrons of 200 horsemen, their ranks four or five-deep. The French artillery, 18 guns-strong, was commanded the Comte de Cossé.
===Spanish Army===
The Spanish also had their infantry in the center and the cavalry on the wings, all three commands in two echelons as well. 27 companies of Walloon cavalry composed the right wing under Bucquoy. The center was the strongest part of the battle array, with 16 infantry battalions and 15 cavalry squadrons under the governor of Luxembourg, Major General Jean de Beck. The 13 center squadrons were deployed in 4 groups in the intervals of the infantry battalions. Ligniville on the left had 20 squadrons of Lorrainer cavalry. The course of the battle would reveal Beck&#x27;s mistake in putting too much cavalry in the center and not enough on the right. The Spanish army used deeper, Imperial-style formations of 10 ranks for its 16 smaller infantry battalions of 500–600 men. The 62 cavalry squadrons were also smaller than those of the French, with a strength of 100–200 men. Their ranks were four or five deep like those of their French counterparts. Unlike the French, the Spanish cavalry did not normally charge enemy cavalry at a gallop sword in hand,
preferring to receive enemy charges standing still with carbine salvos at point blank range instead. This would prove inferior to the French tactic of all out charges. 
==Battle==
===Preliminaries===

Condé saw the strength of the Spanish position and decided not to attack it head-on. His army had been in battle array the entire previous day and had not eaten. There was no food, fodder or water in the place, so he decided to retreat to the village of Neus some two hours march away. There he could obtain supplies from Béthune, where he had left his baggage train, and be in position to intercept the Spanish army&#x27;s movements. At least two officers from Condé&#x27;s army reported that Condé retreat was a planned feint to draw the Spanish into the open for battle.

===Beck&#x27;s attack===
At 5 a.m. six guns from Cossé&#x27;s artillery park fired a volley on the Spanish and the French began to retreat while still in battle formation, with the right-wing making up the rearguard. General Beck&#x27;s Lorrainers suddenly attacked the isolated, 10-squadron-strong French rearguard under Villequier and Noirmoutier and routed them. Condé&#x27;s page was wounded and captured and Condé himself only narrowly escaped being killed or captured. The Picardie infantry regiment came up to support the French rearguard and helped to rally them. At 6:30 a.m., Beck advised the Archduke to attack with all haste and crush the French. The cautious Archduke at first refused and reaffirmed his express order to Beck to take no risks. Beck told him there was no risk on the open plain and the Spanish officers of the army told the archduke that he was giving up an opportunity to avenge the defeat of Rocroi. The Archduke then gave permission to start the battle, armed himself, confessed to his Jesuit priest and fled the field, leaving his army to its fate.

Condé and Gramont ordered the French main body to turn around and form up for battle. By 8 a.m. the armies were ready for action. The nimble and well-handled French guns fired while moving on the advancing Spanish who were easy targets on the forward slope, while the French infantry and cavalry marched forward to the sound of trumpets and the crash of drums. Condé frequently called a halt to the advance to keep the lines in order and maintain spacing to prevent the formations from bunching up. The Spanish artillery had trouble hitting the French. The Spanish were marching down the hill and arraying for combat simultaneously, which was a difficult task.

===Cavalry struggle on the wings===
At 8:30 Bucquoy&#x27;s Walloon cavalry on the Spanish right, situated five paces behind the crest of a small hillock, were approached by Gramont&#x27;s cavalry squadrons. At 20 paces, the Walloons discharged their carbines, killing or wounding almost everyone in the French first lines. The following ranks of the French cavalry nevertheless charged through the Walloons&#x27; formation, throwing it into disorder and rapidly causing a rout. The second echelon of Walloons then charged to help their comrades but a violent French cavalry charge sufficed to rout them. Only Gramont&#x27;s Guards Squadron took heavy losses in this struggle with the second echelon.

Ligniville&#x27;s Lorrainers advanced at a trot to meet the French right-wing cavalry under Condé, who were advancing at a walk. Both sides halted at pistol-shot, and neither side made a move for a time. Prior to the battle, Condé was impressed by the fire discipline of the German cavalry who never fired first and used their enemy&#x27;s helplessness while reloading to charge and rout them. He therefore told his cavalry commanders to hold their fire as well to prevent the Germans from gaining an advantage. The Lorrainers eventually opened fire and killed, wounded or threw from their horse everyone in the French first lines. Condé gave the signal for his squadrons to open fire and then led the Gassion squadron on a charge, crushing the Lorrainer squadron opposite him. Six more French squadrons followed their General&#x27;s lead and beat the rest of the Lorrainer line. The French cavalry reserve under Erlach came up and enveloped the exposed Lorrainer left, shattering them from the flank.

===Battle in the center===
Attacking at 9 a.m., the Spanish infantry in the center enjoyed strong success with its assault and broke 4 of the 12 French infantry battalions. Condé&#x27;s order for his cavalry to hold their fire was taken as a point of honor by the musketeers who refused to fire first as well and before the enemy was at point-blank range. The French Guards fired first, while the Picardie and Erlach battalions were more patient. The French Guards and Scots Guard regiments were subsequently surrounded and the French Guards overwhelmed by the Bonifaz and Bentivoglio infantry battalions. This achievement meant little as both of the Spanish cavalry wings were fleeing from the field. The French center rallied around the Picardie regiment and the Spanish infantry was soon encircled and attacked from all sides by the French cavalry and infantry, much like at Rocroi. There was no replay of the Spanish last stand at Rocroi, the surrounded Spanish battalions choosing not to fight to the last extremity but to capitulate instead.

==Aftermath==
Condé sent two cavalry regiments and an infantry regiment under Villequier to escort the 5,000–6,000 enemy prisoners to Arras and La Bassée, which required several round trips and caused the French to remain near the battlefield for the next eight days to await the return of the escorts. Once the prisoners were secure, Condé&#x27;s army joined Josias von Rantzau&#x27;s force in the siege of Furnes.

===Casualties===
3,000 of the Archduke&#x27;s men lay dead or wounded and 5,000–6,000 were captured, along with all 38 guns, 100 flags, the pontoon bridges and the baggage train. Beck was captured and Condé lent him a carriage to take him to Arras, where he died of his wounds ten days later. The French lost 1,500 killed or wounded.

===Political consequences===
The year 1648 saw two political developments that were both directly tied to the Battle of Lens, but with opposite results. First, it caused a hardening of the Monarchy&#x27;s attitude toward the &quot;parlements&quot;, leading to an initial confrontation in Paris and a protracted struggle that followed. The French victory ended the Thirty Years&#x27; War, though not the conflict between France and Spain. The armies of Turenne, Wrangel and Königsmark were threatening Vienna and Prague; Emperor Ferdinand&#x27;s ally, Maximilian of Bavaria, fervently wanted peace; and Philip IV had lost his main army. Ferdinand had no choice other than to make peace. He approved the propositions for peace from France and Sweden in Münster and Osnabrück. (Since 1641, talks had taken place between France and the Empire in Münster, and between Sweden and the Empire in Osnabrück.) The definitive peace treaty, called the Peace of Westphalia, was signed on 24 October, ending the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The war between France and Spain, would not end until the Treaty of the Pyrenees on 7 November 1659). The latter made Lens and most of the Artois province part of France.

In the end, the French victory was made irrelevant by subsequent events elsewhere, during the failure to secure Anne of Austria&#x27;s regency of France while Louis XIV was too young to rule. A civil war in France, Fronde, broke out shortly afterwards, giving Spain the chance of recovery. The Te Deum at Notre-Dame de Paris in honour of the battle ended in a riot, which caused a serious confrontation that led to the revolt. In January 1649, Louis XIV and his ministers had to flee Paris.

<text>The Four Georgians were a group of gold prospectors who are traditionally credited for discovering the Last Chance placer gold strike of Helena, Montana. They were John Cowan, D. J. Miller, John Crab, and Reginald (Robert) Stanley. Of the four, the only actual Georgian was Cowan, who hailed from Acworth, Georgia. The other three came from Alabama (Miller), Iowa (Crab) and England (Stanley). It has been speculated that they were named &quot;Georgians&quot; not from where they came from, but because they were practicing the &quot;Georgian method&quot; of placer mining.

In 1864, they left the Alder Gulch area of Virginia City, Montana Territory, heading north toward the Kootenai River country to pursue rumored prospects there. En route, they heard that the Kootenai prospects had played out, and instead decided to prospect the Little Blackfoot River. They crossed the Continental Divide to the Prickly Pear Creek drainage, still finding only minimal signs of gold at best. Noting a small creek in the Prickly Pear Valley with the best prospects so far, they again moved north to explore the Marias River. Still finding little gold after six weeks of hard work, they returned south to the place they referred to as &quot;Last Chance Gulch&quot;, since it would be their final opportunity on a long, arduous prospecting trip. They were prepared to give up on the whole area.

On July 14, 1864, they dug two prospect pits on Last Chance Gulch upstream from their earlier efforts. Both pits revealed flat gold nuggets and gold dust. All their efforts had finally paid off. Eventually, Crab and Cowan were sent back to Virginia City for more supplies, other prospectors began appearing, and the Last Chance Gulch bonanza began.

In 1867, the Four Georgians finally sold out their claims and took $40,000 of gold dust by wagon to Fort Benton to board a steam boat down the Missouri River and eventually all the way to the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia where they cashed in three years of hard labor in the Montana gold fields.

<doc id="157105" wikidata="Q757165" url="?curid=157105" title="VxWorks">
<text>VxWorks is a real-time operating system (or RTOS) developed as proprietary software by Wind River Systems, a subsidiary of Aptiv. First released in 1987, VxWorks is designed for use in embedded systems requiring real-time, deterministic performance and in many cases, safety and security certification for industries such as aerospace, defense, medical devices, industrial equipment, robotics, energy, transportation, network infrastructure, automotive, and consumer electronics.

VxWorks supports AMD/Intel architecture, POWER architecture, ARM architectures, and RISC-V. The RTOS can be used in multicore asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP), symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), and mixed modes and multi-OS (via Type 1 hypervisor) designs on 32- and 64-bit processors.

VxWorks comes with the kernel, middleware, board support packages, Wind River Workbench development suite, complementary third-party software and hardware. In its latest release, VxWorks 7, the RTOS has been re-engineered for modularity and upgradeability so the OS kernel is separate from middleware, applications, and other packages. Scalability, security, safety, connectivity, and graphics have been improved to address Internet of Things (IOT) needs.

==History==
VxWorks started in the late 1980s as a set of enhancements to a simple RTOS called VRTX sold by Ready Systems (becoming a Mentor Graphics product in 1995). Wind River acquired rights to distribute VRTX and significantly enhanced it by adding, among other things, a file system and an integrated development environment. In 1987, anticipating the termination of its reseller contract by Ready Systems, Wind River proceeded to develop its own kernel to replace VRTX within VxWorks.

Published in 2003 with a Wind River copyright, &quot;Real-Time Concepts for Embedded Systems&quot;
describes the development environment, runtime setting, and system call families of the RTOS.
Written by Wind River employees with a foreword by Jerry Fiddler, chairman, and co-founder of Wind River, the textbook is an excellent tutorial on the RTOS. (It does not, however, replace Wind River documentation as might be needed by practicing engineers.)

Some key milestones for VxWorks include:

* 1980s: VxWorks adds support for 32-bit processors.
* 1990s: VxWorks 5 becomes the first RTOS with a networking stack.
* 2000s: VxWorks 6 supports SMP and adds derivative industry-specific platforms.
* 2010s: VxWorks adds support for 64-bit processing and introduces VxWorks 7 for IoT in 2016.
*2020s: VxWorks continues to update and add support, including the ability to power the Mars 2020 lander.

==Platform overview==
VxWorks supports Intel architecture, Power architecture, and ARM architectures. The RTOS can be used in multi-core asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP), symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), mixed modes and multi-OS (via Type 1 hypervisor) designs on 32- and 64- bit processors.

The VxWorks consists of a set of runtime components and development tools. The run time components are an operating system (UP and SMP; 32- and 64-bit), software for applications support (file system, core network stack, USB stack, and inter-process communications), and hardware support (architecture adapter, processor support library, device driver library, and board support packages). VxWorks core development tools are compilers such as Diab, GNU, and Intel C++ Compiler (ICC) and its build and configuration tools. The system also includes productivity tools such as its Workbench development suite and Intel tools and development support tools for asset tracking and host support.

The platform is a modular, vendor-neutral, open system that supports a range of third-party software and hardware. The OS kernel is separate from middleware, applications, and other packages, which enables easier bug fixes and testing of new features. An implementation of a layered source build system allows multiple versions of any stack to be installed at the same time so developers can select which version of any feature set should go into the VxWorks kernel libraries.

Optional advanced add-ons for VxWorks provide additional capabilities, including the following:
* Advanced security features to safeguard devices and data residing in and traveling across the Internet of Things (IoT)
* Advanced safety partitioning to enable reliable application consolidation
* Real-time advanced visual edge analytics allow autonomous responses on VxWorks-based devices in real-time without latency
* Optimized embedded Java runtime engine enabling the deployment of Java applications
* Virtualization capability with a real-time embedded, Type 1 hypervisor

==Features==

Core features of the OS include:

* Multitasking kernel with preemptive and round-robin scheduling and fast interrupt response
* Native 64-bit operating system (only one 64-bit architecture supported: x86-64). Data model: LP64
* User-mode applications (&quot;Real-Time Processes&quot;, or RTP) isolated from other user-mode applications as well as the kernel via memory protection mechanisms
* SMP, AMP and mixed mode multiprocessing support
* Error handling framework
* Bluetooth, USB, CAN protocols, Firewire IEEE 1394, BLE, L2CAP, Continua stack, health device profile
* Binary, counting, and mutual exclusion semaphores with priority inheritance
* Local and distributed message queues
* POSIX PSE52 certified conformity in user-mode execution environment 
* File systems: High Reliability File System (HRFS), FAT-based file system (DOSFS), Network File System (NFS), and TFFS
* Dual-mode IPv6 networking stack with IPv6 Ready Logo certification
* Memory protection including real-time processes (RTPs), error detection and reporting, and IPC
* Multi-OS messaging using TIPC and Wind River multi-OS IPC
* Symbolic debugging

In March 2014 Wind River introduced VxWorks 7, emphasizing scalability, security, safety, connectivity, graphics, and virtualization. The following lists some of the release 7 updates. More information can be found on the Wind Rivers VxWorks website.

* Modular, componentized architecture using a layered build system with the ability to update each layer of code independently
* VxWorks microkernel (a full RTOS that can be as small as 20 KB)
* Security features such as digitally-signed modules (X.509), encryption, password management, ability to add/delete users at runtime
* SHA-256 hashing algorithm as the default password hashing algorithm 
* Human machine interface with Vector Graphics, and Tilcon user interface (UI)

==Hardware support==
VxWorks has been ported to a number of platforms. This includes the Intel x86 family (including the Intel Quark SoC), MIPS, PowerPC (and BAE RAD), Freescale ColdFire, Intel i960, SPARC, Fujitsu FR-V, SH-4 and the closely related family of ARM, StrongARM and xScale CPUs. VxWorks provides a standard board support package (BSP) interface between all its supported hardware and the OS. Wind River&#x27;s BSP developer kit provides a common application programming interface (API) and a stable environment for real-time operating system development. VxWorks is supported by popular SSL/TLS libraries such as wolfSSL.

==Development environment==
As is common in embedded system development, cross-compiling is used with VxWorks. Development is done on a &quot;host&quot; system where an integrated development environment (IDE), including the editor, compiler toolchain, debugger, and emulator can be used. Software is then compiled to run on the &quot;target&quot; system. This allows the developer to work with powerful development tools while targeting more limited hardware. VxWorks uses the following host environments and target hardware architectures:

;Supported target architectures and processor families
VxWorks supports a range of target architectures including ARM, Intel, Power architecture, RISC-V architecture and more. For the latest target architecture processors and board support packages, refer to the VxWorks Marketplace or via citation.

The Eclipse-based Workbench IDE that comes with VxWorks is used to configure, analyze, optimize, and debug a VxWorks-based system under development. The &quot;Tornado&quot; IDE was used for VxWorks 5.x and was replaced by the Eclipse-based &quot;Workbench&quot; IDE for VxWorks 6.x. and later. Workbench is also the IDE for the Wind River Linux, On-Chip Debugging, and Wind River Diab Compiler product lines. VxWorks 7 uses Wind River Workbench 4 which updates to the Eclipse 4 base provides full third party plug-in support and usability improvements.

Wind River Simics is a standalone simulation tool compatible with VxWorks. It simulates the full target system (hardware and software) to create a shared platform for software development. Multiple developers can share a complete virtual system and its entire state, including execution history. Simics enables early and continuous system integration and faster prototyping by utilizing virtual prototypes instead of physical prototypes.

==Notable uses==

== TCP vulnerability and CVE patches ==
As of July 2019, a paper published by Armis exposed 11 critical vulnerabilities, including remote code execution, denial of service, information leaks, and logical flaws impacting more than two billion devices using the VxWorks RTOS. The vulnerability allows attackers to tunnel into an &quot;internal&quot; network using the vulnerability and hack into printers, laptops, and any other connected devices. The vulnerability can bypass firewalls as well.

The system is in use by quite a few mission-critical products, many of which could not be easily patched.

<doc id="157109" wikidata="Q678227" url="?curid=157109" title="Battle of Fleurus (1794)">
<text>The Battle of Fleurus was fought on 26 June 1794 during the War of the First Coalition between the French Revolutionary Army under Jean-Baptiste Jourdan and an Austro-Dutch army commanded by Prince Josias of Coburg. In what was the most significant battle of the Low Countries theatre of the War of the First Coalition, Jourdan&#x27;s army was able to concentrate its forces and defeat Coburg and his troops. The Allied defeat led to the permanent loss of the Austrian Netherlands and to the dissolution of the Dutch Republic. The battle marked a turning point for the French army, which remained ascendant for the rest of the War of the First Coalition.

==Background==
In May 1794, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was given the command of approximately 96,000 men created by combining the Army of the Ardennes with portions of the Army of the North and the Army of the Moselle. Jourdan was given the task of consolidating the capture of the north bank of the Sambre river, specifically by capturing the fortress of Charleroi, a task that the forces on the Sambre had tried three times and failed to accomplish, being defeated at the battles of Grandreng, Erquelinnes and Gosselies.

On 12 June, Jourdan&#x27;s army crossed the Sambre for the fourth time and invested the fortress of Charleroi with 70,000 men. On 16 June, an Austrian-Dutch force of about 43,000 men counterattacked in heavy mist, inflicted 3,000 casualties, and drove Jourdan away from Charleroi back across the Sambre in the battle of Lambusart. While it was a setback, the French army withdrew from the field mostly in good order, and took little real damage from the battle. As a result, they were ready to go on the attack again within two days.

== The third siege of Charleroi ==

=== The fifth crossing of the Sambre ===

The defeat at Lambusart caused little damage to the French army, with Jourdan sustaining only 3,000 casualties out of a total of 90,000 men under command, of which 70,000 were engaged. Jourdan had withdrawn the army largely intact and in good order, and French morale remained high as all ranks felt that their loss was only due to the heavy mist, the element of surprise, and shortages of ammunition, not because of any deficiency of the French soldiers themselves.

As a result of these factors, Jourdan was quickly ready to go back on the offensive, and he recrossed the Sambre for the fifth time just 2 days after the battle of Lambusart, on 18 June.

The French divisions were to occupy much the same positions as they had during the fourth crossing and second siege of Charleroi. From west to east, they deployed as follows:

* General Guillaume Philibert Duhesme’s division crossed at Aulnes Abbey and Landelies and positioned himself between the towns of Pieton and Souvret.
* General Anne Charles Basset Montaigu’s division (which replaced Muller&#x27;s division in the attack force) crossed at Rus (south of the modern Terril du Hameau) and Landelies, and deployed to the right of Duhesme with its right on the Pieton river.
* General Antoine Morlot’s division and General Jean-Joseph Ange d’Hautpoul’s brigade of cavalry crossed at Marchienne-au-Pont and deployed north of Gosselies with outposts at Thumeon (modern Thimeon)
* General Jean-Etienne Championnet&#x27;s division and General Guillaume Anselme Philibert de Soland&#x27;s brigade of cavalry crossed at Marchienne-au-Pont and deployed between Heppignies and Wagnee, with outposts in Mellet and St Fiacre (currently the company compound of Saspj De Munck Lionel &amp; Maxime)
* General François Joseph Lefebvre crossed at Chatellet and took position between Wagnee and the tavern of Campinaire (at the modern intersection of the N568 and N29), with outposts in Fleurus
* General Jacques Maurice Hatry also crossed at Chatellet, and marched for Charleroi to resume besieging the fortress
* General Francois Severin Marceau, on the extreme right, crossed at Tergnee (around modern Rue du Tergnee in Farciennes) to take position from Campinaire to the northern edge of the forest of Copiaux (still existent today, south of Velaine-sur-Sambre), with detachments occupying Velaine, Baulet and Wanfersee (the latter two now combined into the town of Baulet-Wanfercee), and his main camp at Baratre (halfway between modern Lambusart and the town of Keumiee).

From the moment of their deployments, the French divisions immediately began constructing entrenchments and redoubts to fortify their positions protecting the siege works.

=== Allied miscalculations and reactions ===
Jourdan&#x27;s recrossing of the Sambre so soon after Lambusart caught the Allies completely by surprise.

Following the previous battle at Lambusart, the Allied high command under Feldmarschall Prince Coburg had assumed that the French were morally and materially beaten, and would be unable or unwilling to undertake another offensive after four successive failures. As a result, on 17 June, William V, the Prince of Orange, in command of the forces of the Allied left wing that defended this front, had spread out his forces again, sending a division under General Paul Davidovitch to Erquelinnes while simultaneously preparing to send 4 battalions of infantry to reinforce Coburg&#x27;s centre at Tournai. Orange&#x27;s main force was at Chapelle-lez-Herlaimont.

Such was the Allied confidence that the French would not dare make another attempt on Charleroi, that even when the French recrossed the Sambre a fifth time, Orange concluded erroneously that they were aiming for Mons, the original objective of the Sambre campaigns. 

Orange ordered his outnumbered force at Chapelle-lez-Herlaimont to withdraw to the main base at Rouveroy to defend Mons and avoid being cut off by French advances. The 4 battalions intended for Coburg were withheld while Beaulieu&#x27;s corps, which had returned to guard Namur after Lambusart, was ordered to assemble near Quatre-Bras to cover the road to Brussels.

As a result, the French once again effected their crossing unopposed.

=== Siege operations ===
The third siege of Charleroi commenced formally on 19 June with the city&#x27;s investment, which the garrison, only 2,800 men strong under one Colonel Reynac, was too weak to delay, especially since no one had expected the French to attack again so soon. With only three days between the raising of the second siege and the commencement of the third one, the garrison had neither had time to prepare for a new siege, nor destroy the works from the previous one.

During the third siege, the French benefitted from the reuse of the works from the second siege, giving them a headstart in speed and progress.

As the siege progressed, the various divisions of the army undertook several small divisional operations to clear enemy forces from their perimeter and keep Allied observation forces at a distance. 

On 20 June, Kleber took his two divisions, under Duhesme and Montaigu, to Chapelle-lez-Herlaimont, attacking in four columns and driving the enemy forces in the town out, before returning to their defensive positions with Montaigu positioned from Trazegnies back to the town of Pieton, and Duhesme on his right, stretching from Trazegnies to the Pieton river.

On 21 June, Championnet and Morlot attacked Quatre-Bras and drove away the Allied force at the crossroads, before returning to their entrenchments. 

On 22 June, Kleber attacked Chapelle-lez-Herlaimont again with his two divisions to drive out the Allies, who had returned.

=== The surrender of Charleroi ===
At 7 am on 25 June, seeing that no relief appeared to be forthcoming after a week and that the French were about to begin their third parallel (a trench line close enough to launch infantry assaults from), Reynac asked for terms of surrender. 

When presented with Reynac&#x27;s request for terms by a major from his staff, it was refused by the Representative of the People Louis-Antoine Saint-Just, who was in charge of negotiations. Saint-Just demanded an immediate surrender instead. Armand de Marescot, the chief engineer of the forces on the Sambre at this time, was present at the negotiations and recorded the following exchange in his campaign report:

SAINT-JUST: I don&#x27;t want this piece of paper (i.e. Reynac&#x27;s note with proposed terms of surrender), I want the place itself.

MAJOR: But if we surrender at discretion (i.e.unconditionally), we will be dishonoured.

SAINT-JUST: We can neither honour or dishonour you, just as it is not in your power to honour or dishonour the French nation. There is no connection between you and us.

MAJOR: But can we not obtain some form of capitulation (i.e. terms)? 

SAINT-JUST: Yesterday we could have listened to you; today you must surrender at discretion. I have spoken; I have used the powers entrusted to me; I will take back nothing. I count on the courage of the army, and mine. Saint-Just&#x27;s threat was just a bluff; the French were not actually ready to assault Charleroi. It would have taken at least another eight days for the French to have taken the fortress by assault if resistance had continued under a resolute commander. However, Saint-Just needed to intimidate Reynac into surrendering as soon as possible because the French had been aware for some days that the Allied main army was already nearby and their attack to relieve Charleroi was imminent.

In fact, the Allies were already getting dangerously close; on 25 June itself, as Reynac was negotiating his surrender, a detachment from Coburg&#x27;s army was already trying to get to the ridge of Heppignies to fire rockets, an agreed-upon signal that the relief army had arrived. However, they were driven away by Championnet, whose division occupied the ridge, before they could get close. They were only able to launch their rockets from Frasne (modern Frasnes-lez-Gosselies), too far away to the north to be seen. Around midnight on the day of the battle, an Austrian cavalry officer, Count Radetzky, did manage to infiltrate the French lines and actually reach the walls of Charleroi to discover it was already captured, but was then injured and chased by a French patrol on the way back later in the morning, and did not make it back to headquarters with his news until the afternoon, when the battle was already in full swing. 

Despite the fact that the French were clearly not ready to assault the fortress yet, Reynac had been discouraged by the apparent lack of any relief, and was intimidated by Saint-Just&#x27;s posturing and threats. Seeing no point in further resistance, he agreed to surrender unconditionally that very afternoon. Forces from Hatry&#x27;s division, which had been besieging Charleroi, then marched in to take possession of the city. 

Reynac&#x27;s surrender had come in the nick of time for the French. The very next morning, the Allies would commence the battle of Fleurus to relieve Charleroi–just half a day too late. Hatry&#x27;s division, freed up from siege duties, would make an important contribution as a reserve force during the battle.

== Prelude to battle ==

=== Coburg seeks decisive battle at Charleroi ===
The campaigns on the Sambre were only half of the strategy of General Charles Pichegru, who was the commander in chief of the entire front in the Low Countries, which at the time included the Army of the North, and also the Army of the Ardennes. As the Sambre forces attacked from Pichegru&#x27;s right wing, his left had defeated the Allies in several battles around Courtrai, and had laid siege to Ypres since 1 June.

With the French defeat at the battle of Lambusart on 16 June, Coburg had assumed the danger from that wing was now over, and he felt free to relieve the siege of Ypres on the other wing by reinforcing Count Clerfayt, who was commanding the Austrian forces trying to relieve Ypres.

Marching with 23 battalions of infantry and 30 squadrons of cavalry on 18 June, however, Coburg had only just arrived at Coeyghem (modern Kooigem) later that day when he received the news that Ypres had surrendered and Jourdan had recrossed the Sambre, both on that same day. 

With no siege to relieve, but also freed of the immediate need to fight on two fronts, Coburg returned to Tournai, where he opted to seek a decisive battle on the Sambre by uniting the Allied main army, now freed up, with Orange&#x27;s forces for an all-out attack on the French on the Sambre wing.

=== Securing the Duke of York&#x27;s cooperation ===
Coburg planned to bring the 12,000 Austrians under his command at Tournai towards Charleroi to join with Orange&#x27;s and Beaulieu&#x27;s 40,000 in the theatre for the decisive battle against Jourdan. However, the concentration of Austrian forces on the left wing for a decisive battle created two complications:

# It also meant denuding the wing that was defending the Scheldt on the Allied right wing, leaving only the forces in English pay, under the Duke of York, as well as Clerfayt’s corps, to hold the river and cover Brussels. These would be severely outnumbered by the French forces facing them.
# Under their standing orders, the departure of these Austrians to the east could be construed by the British and British-paid troops as a ruse to cover the abandonment of the Low Countries, and would lead to them immediately withdrawing to protect their allies in Holland and the Netherlands, as they were unwilling and unable to fight alone to defend Austrian interests if the Austrians themselves had withdrawn their forces.

Coburg needed to convince the Duke of York to take command of the forces around Tournai for a few weeks, guard the line of the Scheldt against Pichegru, and delay his withdrawal to the Netherlands.

However, this at first met with refusal, as the English suspected that the Austrians were trying to use them to cover a retreat from the Low Countries. This was exacerbated by a letter which Orange had sent to the high command at Tournai, in which he assessed that Kleber’s attack on his forces at Chapelle-lez-Herlaimont on 20 June was probably intended to cover a retreat, proven by the fact that he was able to reoccupy the town on the 21st with no resistance.

The impression given by Orange that the Sambre front was no cause for concern initially confirmed York’s suspicions that Coburg’s was using the Sambre as an excuse to begin an Austrian withdrawal towards the Meuse and out of the Low Countries. However, after a further exchange of letters in which Coburg clarified that Orange was mistaken and clarified that the situation was truly urgent, York finally agreed to take command on the Scheldt, but only on condition that a garrison of Austrians remain to defend Tournai, the main Allied base, because York&#x27;s force was too weak to defend both the river and the town. 

York also offered to bring his corps of British-paid troops to join in the relief of Charleroi, on the basis that this concentration would give Coburg even greater numbers to secure a strong victory that would free him up to then attack the other wing. He also argued that if Coburg was defeated, York would not be able to hold the Scheldt alone anyway, so he might as well join in the attack on the Sambre. However, Coburg declined this offer, preferring to leave York on the Scheldt with the Austrian garrison he requested.

The two generals also agreed that York could commence a retreat to Holland if Coburg was defeated on the Sambre. York then positioned his troops between Tournai and Oudenaarde to guard the river while still affording them a good route of retreat to Holland if needed.

== Opposing forces ==
=== Coburg marches to Charleroi ===
After getting York&#x27;s agreement and arranging for the army&#x27;s stores to be moved rearward from Tournai to Brussels and Antwerp in case of defeat, Coburg commenced a forced march with his 12,000 men in 13 battalions and 26 squadrons. Setting out from Tournai on 21 June, he reached Ath by the end of the day, Soignies at the end of the 22nd, and Nivelles at the end of the 23rd. These marches were conducted in blazing heat, which left the troops exhausted and in need of rest.

Coburg&#x27;s arrival brought the total Allied forces available to relieve the siege of Charleroi to 52,000:

* Coburg&#x27;s 12,000 from Tournai, at Nivelles
* Orange&#x27;s 28,000 between Rouveroy and Bray, with detachments under Nesslinger towards Seneffe and Spiegel towards Quatre-Bras
* 4,000 men under Prince Frederick of Orange near Croix
* 8,000 men under Beaulieu near Gembloux

Coburg decided to give battle on 26 June after resting his men and reconnoitering the situation.

=== French preparations ===

Jourdan quickly detected Coburg&#x27;s arrival, but overestimated that the Allied forces numbered 70,000, on par with his strength. As a result, Jourdan opted to act defensively, receiving the imminent Allied attack from within his fortifications. To prevent Allied penetrations from destabilising his entire line like at the battle of Lambusart, he pulled Duhesme&#x27;s division of Kleber&#x27;s corps back from the Pieton river to Jumet to act as a reserve on the left, while positioning Hatry to the east of Ransart as a reserve for the right.

During this period, Jourdan also sought to call in Muller&#x27;s and Scherer&#x27;s divisions, guarding the right bank of the Sambre further west, to reinforce his army, but he was not given authority over them by the Committee of Public Safety. Jourdan then contacted General Ferrand, the garrison commander of Maubeuge further to the west, and requested any troops he could spare from the division-sized garrison. Ferrand sent the 6,000 men of Daurier&#x27;s brigade to Jourdan, who took position at Leernes, beyond the heights of l’Espinette, with a vanguard at Fontaine l’Eveque.

While reserves were now available, Jourdan&#x27;s left wing was now considerably weakened, consisting solely of Montaigu&#x27;s now-overstretched division, pushed far forward to Trazegnies-Miaucourt (within modern Courcelles), and Daurier&#x27;s brigade.

Despite this weakness, Jourdan opted to keep Montaigu far forward in this vulnerable position as he wanted maximum time and space to protect both the pontoon bridges on the Sambre near Marchienne-au-Pont which the army depended on for retreat, as well as the reserve artillery at Montigny-sur-Tilleul, which he had not yet had time to bring into Charleroi. 

To minimise Montaigu&#x27;s losses, he instructed the division commander to slowly give ground if enemy pressure grew too great, withdrawing on Marchienne-au-Pont. Daurier&#x27;s brigade meanwhile would conduct a fighting withdrawal if needed to defend heights of l’Espinette, within artillery range of the crossings at Marchienne-au-Pont, to prevent the enemy from occupying it and interdicting the army&#x27;s route of retreat.

=== French strength ===

The French army&#x27;s paper strength on the eve of battle consisted of:

* The divisions of Hatry, Morlot, Lefebvre and Championnet of the Army of the Moselle (42,000 men)
* The divisions of Duhesme and Montaigu under Kleber, of the Army of the North (18,000 men)
* The Army of the Ardennes, made up of the divisions of Marceau and Mayer, minus detachments to Dinant, under overall command of Marceau (11,500 men)
* Daurier’s brigade (6,000 men)
* Dubois’ cavalry division (2,300 men)

Subtracting 3,000 men as casualties from the battle of Lambusart, and 2,000 men assigned to garrison Charleroi, this left Jourdan some 75,000 men available for battle.

=== Allied attack plans ===

Coburg, with his headquarters at Nivelles, planned two major attacks. Like at Lambusart, his main blow was to be at the French right flank, which he hoped to break to get behind the French centre and envelop them. This would be accompanied by an attack on the French left, divided from the rest of the army by the river Pieton, intended to capture the river crossings the French needed to retreat, making doubly sure they would be trapped on the left bank of the Sambre. They would be supported with attacks in the centre delivered by smaller columns.

Coburg divided his attack force into five columns, positioned from east to west as follows:

==== Archduke Charles&#x27; and Beaulieu&#x27;s columns ====

Consisting of 20 battalions of infantry, 36 squadrons of cavalry, and 36 guns, these were to be the main attack force, and were placed under the overall command of Archduke Charles, the brother of the Austrian emperor. Their mission was to crumple the French right. The combined force was to march at 2 am on the 26th from the tavern of Point-du-Jour (at the modern intersection of the N29 and N93) to near Gros-Buisson (the plain north of Fleurus), where they would split into two columns:

* General Johann Peter Beaulieu’s column, with 13 battalions, 20 squadrons and 18 guns, would turn south just before reaching Fleurus, and attack Lambusart, Baulet and Wanfersee, before turning parallel to the Sambre, outflanking the entire line, and getting into the rear of Jourdan&#x27;s army
* Charles’ own column, with 7 battalions, 16 squadrons and 18 guns, would march through Fleurus and attack the tavern of Campinaire.

==== Prince Kaunitz&#x27;s column ====
Consisting of 8 battalions of infantry, 18 squadrons of cavalry and 17 guns, the column under Franz Wenzel, Graf von Kaunitz-Rietberg, was to march from the tree of Bruyere (which still stands today at the southern tip of the La Bruyere golf course), where he was encamped, to the village of Chassart to spend the night of the 25th, then march towards Fleurus and attack Heppignies and Wagnee once Charles’ column had engaged at Campinaire.

==== Quosdanovich&#x27;s column ====
Consisting of 7 battalions, 16 squadrons and 16 guns, Peter Vitus von Quosdanovich’s column was to move from Nivelles, where it was located, to Grand-Champ, the plain north of the village of Mellet, on the night of the 25th. It was then to wait for Kaunitz&#x27;s column to reach the forest of Lombue (modern Domaine du Bois-Lombut) at daybreak on the 26th before moving on Gosselies, via Pont-a-Migneloup (modern Pont-a-Mignetoux), Mellet and the forest of Lombue, attacking together with Kaunitz.

==== The Prince of Orange&#x27;s column ====
Based at Chapelle-lez-Herlaimont at 2 am on 26 June with 24 battalions, 32 squadrons and 22 guns, Orange&#x27;s column was generally to capture Courcelles and Forchies-la-Marche, then capture the forest of Moncaux (the modern Charleroi suburb of Monceau-sur-Sambre), the heights of l’Espinette, and the Sambre crossing at Landelies. 

Orange intended to split his column into three:

* One sub-column under Christian August, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont, would attack from Trazegnies and Forchies towards Marchienne-au-Pont
* Another sub-column, under his son Prince Frederic of Orange, was to capture Anderlues and Fontaine l’Eveque, the heights of l’Espinette, then cross the Sambre at Rus and converge on Marchienne-au-Pont
* The third sub-column under General Riese was to march between Waldeck and Frederic to keep them in communication and reinforce either column as needed

== Battle ==


The battle of Fleurus was tactically indecisive, with the French successfully holding the line despite intense fighting, and counterattacking against the Allies in the afternoon despite initial defeats on both their flanks in the morning. 

At some point in the afternoon, Count Radetzky, who had discovered that Charleroi had been captured, finally made it back to report to Coburg. With no siege to relieve, and with the inconclusive fighting and the strength of the French defences and numbers, Coburg decided further attack was not worth the potential gain, and ordered a withdrawal around 3 pm. 

=== Archduke Charles&#x27; attack===
On the French right, Lefebvre&#x27;s division had moved forward from its fortifications at Campinaire and occupied an advance position at Fleurus before the 26th. Charles’ advance towards Fleurus brought his column into contact with Lefebvre, and fighting commenced beyond and in the town between 5.30 and 6 am.

Meanwhile, at around the same time, Beaulieu&#x27;s column attacked Marceau&#x27;s division at Baulet and Velaine, pushing them back into the forest of Gopiaux between 9 and 9.30 am. These held until 10.30 am, when the capture of an important strongpoint broke this line, causing this part of Marceau&#x27;s forces to flee towards the Sambre crossings at Tamines and Tergnee.

Beaulieu immediately marched towards Marceau&#x27;s entrenched camp at Baratre, 800m east of Lambusart. Although Marceau&#x27;s main force was located here, panic from the defeat of his vanguard had spread and many of the soldiers fled without offering much resistance, and despite Marceau&#x27;s best efforts to rally them. Beaulieu subsequently captured Baratre with ease, and continued his advance on Lambusart.

Marceau&#x27;s withdrawal into Gopiaux and Baratre had uncovered Lefebvre&#x27;s right flank, and Lefebvre ordered a retreat around 9.30 am from Fleurus to his main line of French fortifications at Campinaire and Lambusart. Once there, Lefebvre sent Colonel Jean-de-Dieu Soult, his chief of staff, to check on Marceau and report on the situation on his right. After Soult reported on the capture of Baratre, Lefebvre sent forces east to Lambusart to plug the gap there. Marceau, who managed to rally some of his forces around 12 pm, later returned and joined these units in the defence of the town.

Seizing Fleurus at 10 am, Charles arrived in front of Campinaire just as Beaulieu captured Baratre and reached Lambusart. They launched relentless combined assaults against the French line throughout the afternoon, but the terrain greatly favoured the defenders, and the Allies made no progress apart from capturing a toehold in Lambusart itself. Between 4 and 5 pm, Charles and Beaulieu received Coburg&#x27;s orders calling off the attack.

The columns began to disengage at around 5 pm, but for Beaulieu, who was attempting to retreat to Gembloux, this coincided with a counterattack on his left flank, launched by Lefebvre, Marceau and reinforcements from Hatry sent by Jourdan. Beaulieu&#x27;s cavalry rearguard was routed by Lefebvre, although Beaulieu&#x27;s main force got away. By 6 pm, the Allies on this part of the front had vacated the field.

=== Orange&#x27;s attack ===
On the French left, the prince of Orange commenced his advance at 1.30 am on the morning of the 26th.

Waldeck&#x27;s column crossed the Pieton near Mont-A-Gouy (modern Gouy-lez-Pieton), and advanced on Trazegnies, where he clashed with Montaigu, who retreated back across the Sambre by 9 am to defend Marchienne-au-Pont, harried by Waldeck&#x27;s forces, who occupied the forest of Moncaux behind them.

Meanwhile, Frederic&#x27;s column had encountered almost no resistance on its advance from Chapelle-lez-Herlaimont, capturing Anderlues and Fontaine l’Eveque and the castle of Wespes before finally being stopped at the heights of l’Espinette by Daurier&#x27;s brigade, also between 9 and 10 am. 

When Orange&#x27;s forces attacked Montaigu, Kleber had immediately despatched 3 battalions and 3 guns from Duhesme&#x27;s division in reserve to support Montaigu, but these arrived too late to help. With Montaigu in full retreat, these forces withdrew back to Kleber at the Pieton.

At around 8 am, Kleber decided to secure the bridges across the Pieton with General of Brigade Jean Bernadotte’s brigade of Duhesme&#x27;s division to create a new refused French left flank after Montaigu&#x27;s retreat. Later in the morning, with Montaigu holding the Sambre against Waldeck and Daurier holding l&#x27;Espinette against Frederic, Kleber decided to counterattack with Duhesme&#x27;s reserve division in 3 columns.

On the left, Kleber personally took command of one column against the forest of Moncaux. In the centre, Bernadotte would advance west from the bridge at Roux, and Duhesme would advance on the right against Courcelles and Trazegnies.

Beginning their advance between 11 am and noon, the columns of Duhesme&#x27;s division pinned down Waldeck&#x27;s forces throughout the afternoon, finally forcing him back to Forchies-la-Marche at 5 pm.

Meanwhile, Prince Frederic&#x27;s column had been pushing hard against Daurier, and by noon, was threatening to capture the bridges further west at d’Aulnes and Lobbes, from which he could cross and cut off Daurier&#x27;s retreat at Landelies. It was at this moment that Poncet&#x27;s brigade of Montaigu&#x27;s division, having retreated back across the Sambre at Rus and Marchienne-au-Pont, was ordered to recross and counterattack Frederic at Aulnes to support Daurier&#x27;s defence.

Poncet&#x27;s brigade counterattacked in the early afternoon, and, combined with Daurier, drove Frederic back to the heights of Anderlues by 3 pm.

At this point, Orange, seeing that the French still stood strong and were even reinforcing their left, and concerned that he was too far forward to be supported by the next column on his left under Quosdanovich, decided to withdraw at around 5 pm to Haine-Saint-Paul. Coburg&#x27;s orders for a general withdrawal arrived soon after Orange had commenced his own withdrawal.

=== Kaunitz&#x27;s attack ===
Opposite the French centre, Kaunitz&#x27;s column had been ordered to attack once he heard Archduke Charles’ column commence fighting. At 5.30 am, hearing Charles’ and Lefebvre&#x27;s guns, Kaunitz ordered his column forward to capture Heppignies.

Championnet&#x27;s division was defending this section of the front, and had been standing to since 2 am in preparation for Kaunitz&#x27;s attack, after Championnet spotted Kaunitz moving into his attack position near the tree of Bruyere the previous evening. Thus, when Kaunitz ran into one of Championnet&#x27;s advanced brigades under General Grenier near Chassart to the north, they were ready, and conducted a fighting withdrawal into Saint-Fiacre, which had been fortified beforehand.

The brigade at Saint-Fiacre held until 9.30 am, when Lefebvre&#x27;s division evacuated Fleurus and fell back on Campinaire. Championnet then ordered Saint-Fiacre&#x27;s evacuation to the main line of fortifications on the heights of Heppignies. This evacuation opened a gap in the French lines as Wagnee, between Championnet and Lefebvre, was only held one battalion of Championnet&#x27;s division. Jourdan then sent a half-brigade from Hatry&#x27;s division to reinforce the defenders of Wagnee.

Kaunitz attempted to advance on Championnet&#x27;s entrenchments, but the terrain in front of Championnet&#x27;s division strongly favoured the defensive. Kaunitz himself had also not committed to a full attack as he did not want to advance too quickly, because the cordon system of war, then prevalent, dictated that columns had to advance in line with each other to exert equal pressure on the enemy front, and Archduke Charles’ column, whom he was to take his cue from, had at the time been checked by Lefebvre&#x27;s defence.

However, although he was holding well against Kaunitz&#x27;s attacks, at 11 am things changed. Championnet heard that Kleber&#x27;s left wing (actually only Montaigu&#x27;s division) had retreated all the way to Marchienne-au-Pont, and that Lefebvre now had to cover Marceau&#x27;s front as well as his own after Marceau&#x27;s corps broke. With Archduke Charles and Beaulieu resuming their advance on Lambusart, Kaunitz now also resolutely took the offensive and pushed Championnet hard, while an Allied detachment worked its way into the northwest sector of Heppignies, on Championnet&#x27;s flank, via a sheltered defile.

The combination of these factors with the failure of a counterattack at 2 pm by one of Championnet&#x27;s brigades and d&#x27;Hautpoul&#x27;s brigade of cavalry, and the inability of Championnet&#x27;s messengers to find, reach, and report on the true situation of Lefebvre&#x27;s division, led Championnet to believe the worst. He requested permission from Jourdan to withdraw from what he thought was an exposed position, and, with the permission granted, began retreating from Heppignies at 3.30 pm.

However, just as the division was descending the rear slopes of Heppignies ridge, news arrived from Jourdan that Lefebvre had stopped Charles and Beaulieu and reinforcements from Hatry&#x27;s division were coming up. With his division/s right flank safe, Championnet was ordered to counterattack Kaunitz with his division, Dubois’ cavalry from the 2 pm attack, and Hatry&#x27;s reinforcements.

Launching a bayonet charge at 4 pm, Championnet&#x27;s infantry and Dubois’ cavalry surprised Kaunitz&#x27;s forces, who were forming up for pursuit. Dismayed at the revival of an enemy they had thought was beaten, and caught in disorder just as they were redeploying into columns of pursuit, Kaunitz&#x27;s column broke and fled the battlefield within the hour. Having also received Coburg&#x27;s order to withdraw at about this time, Kaunitz made no effort to renew the fight, and withdrew his remaining forces.

=== Quosdanovich&#x27;s attack ===
Opposite the French left centre, Quosdanovich&#x27;s column marched from Nivelles on the evening of 25 June, passed through Quatre-Bras in the night, and seized Frasne at daybreak on the 26th from a detachment of Morlot&#x27;s division. 

Advancing through Frasne, Quosdanovich deployed his column at 4 am on the Grandchamp, a plain that lay between Frasne and Mellet. However, units of Dubois’ cavalry division, in their element on the open plain, managed to delay Quosdanovich for 3 hours while Morlot deployed his division behind them, around the village of Mellet. 

Morlot then attacked on Quosdanovich&#x27;s front as well as on his right flank via Thumeon. The fighting continued until Morlot&#x27;s right was uncovered by Grenier&#x27;s withdrawal from Chassart to Saint-Fiacre. This, coupled with a successful counterattack by Quosdanovich against Morlot&#x27;s flanking force at Thumeon, forced the French general to withdraw to the south bank of the stream running through Pont-a-Migneloup.

Quosdanovich&#x27;s artillery then pinned Morlot&#x27;s division down under heavy fire until about 3 pm, with neither side able to advance. At 3 in the afternoon, Morlot received orders from Jourdan to withdraw to Gosselies, in conjunction with Championnet&#x27;s withdrawal. Quosdanovich was unable to pursue, as the French had broken the bridge at Pont-a-Migneloup and he had to call up his pontoon train to bridge the stream before he could resume his advance. 

The artillery engagement at Pont-a-Migneloup was the last engagement on this sector of the front. Just after 4 pm, before he was able to cross and engage Morlot again, Quosdanovich received Coburg&#x27;s order to withdraw, and immediately complied.

=== French observation balloon ===
The battle of Fleurus was the first battle in history that incorporated aerial reconnaissance and observation of an enemy force. This was provided by a French reconnaissance balloon, &quot;l&#x27;Entreprenant&quot;, operated by a crew under Captain Coutelle of the Aerostatic Corps, which continuously informed Jourdan of Austrian movements. 

During the battle, &quot;l’Entreprenant&quot; was deployed on the tall hill where the Jumet windmill was located (modern Bellevue, a Charleroi suburb), as it was the highest location in the area. For much of the morning, Jourdan based himself on the hill to receive and better understand the reports from the aeronauts in real time. Representative of the People Guyton, one of the three attached to Jourdan&#x27;s army, also mentioned in his reports to the Committee of Public Safety that Morlot, whose headquarters was located in Gosselies, spent two hours airborne in the balloon in the morning observing the enemy.

Despite the presence of the balloon, its intelligence value was questionable due to its altitude limitations and instability as a platform, and it apparently had no appreciable influence over the course of the battle. Soult, in his memoirs written after the fall of Napoleon, declared that the balloon was useless:“I will not say anything about the balloon that we put up during the battle over the heads of the combatants, and this ridiculous innovation would not even deserve to be mentioned, if it hadn’t been made out to be something important. The truth is, this balloon was just plain embarrassing...At the beginning of the action, a general and an engineer entered the gondola to observe, it was said, the enemy movements…but at the height where we let them go up, the details escaped their view and everything was confused. We were no better informed, and no one paid any attention to it, neither the enemy nor ourselves.”Championnet likewise said in his memoirs about the balloon that &quot;nothing of importance came from this post.&quot;

Most tellingly, on 3 Pluviose Year VII (22 January 1799), Jourdan recommended in a letter to Barthelemy Scherer, who was Minister of War at the time, that &quot;aerostats (balloons) are not necessary for the army, unless some other way of using them is found.&quot; Despite being with the balloon for most of the morning of the battle, Jourdan also made no mention of it, or its usefulness, at all in his memoirs.

==Aftermath==
The battle of Fleurus had been intense and unrelenting, and both French and Allied armies were exhausted by the fighting. Indeed, Soult wrote that it was &quot;fifteen hours of the most desperate fighting I ever saw in my life.&quot; The French did not pursue the retreating Allied army in any way, and made no movements for two days to rest. The Allies, meanwhile, retreated to Braine l’Alleud and Waterloo.

It is generally agreed that the battle was a costly one for the French, with casualties estimated between five and six thousand. The Allied losses have always been in dispute: the French claimed significantly higher losses than their own, while the Allies claimed far less. Traditional estimates attribute &quot;considerable casualties&quot; to Coburg&#x27;s army, and hover near five thousand Allied killed and wounded. However, according to historian Digby Smith (1998), Austrian-Dutch losses numbered 208 killed, 1,017 wounded, and 361 captured. In addition, the French captured one mortar, three caissons, and one standard, while the Austrians captured one cannon and one standard.

While tactically indecisive, Fleurus was the strategically the decisive battle of the French campaign of 1794 in the Low Countries, after which the Austrians gave up on contesting the Low Countries, and left it to the French. Smith (1998) wrote:

By this stage of the war the court in Vienna was convinced that it was no longer worth the effort to try to hold on to the Austrian Netherlands and it is suspected that Coburg gave up the chance of a victory here so as to be able to pull out eastwards.

After Fleurus, Jourdan&#x27;s force was formally consolidated as the Army of Sambre and Meuse, and given the mission of capturing the eastern Low Countries and going after Coburg&#x27;s army. Just a month after Fleurus, Jourdan had occupied Mechelen and Louvain (15 July), Namur (17 July) and Liege (27 July), while Pichegru had entered Brussels (11 July) and captured Antwerp (27 July). 

Unable and unwilling to contest the French advance further, and threatened with destruction by the combined pressure from Pichegru&#x27;s and Jourdan&#x27;s armies acting in concert (which did not happen only because the Committee of Public Safety diverted Pichegru&#x27;s forces elsewhere at the crucial time), Coburg began a retreat eastward to the Meuse on 15 July, and crossed the river at Maastricht, the eastern border of the Low Countries, into Germany on the 24th. The main battlefields of the war against Austria would now shift from Belgium to Germany and the Rhine.

The Austrian defeat at Fleurus also led to the breakup of the Allied army in the north as the Austrian abandonment of the Low Countries also led to the withdrawal of English and Dutch forces northwards, away from the Austrians, to defend the Netherlands. The Duke of York&#x27;s forces crossed into the Netherlands at Roosendaal on 24 July, the same day Coburg crossed the Meuse at Maastricht, leaving the Low Countries completely vacated. Divided and outnumbered, the English and Dutch were incapable of holding back the French on their own, and, overturned by the Batavian revolution in Amsterdam on 18 January 1795, the Dutch Republic was extinguished and replaced by the pro-French Batavian Republic instead. 

Politically, the battle invalidated the argument that continuation of the revolutionary Reign of Terror was necessary because of the military threat to France&#x27;s very existence. Thus, some would argue, victory at Fleurus was a leading cause of the Thermidorian Reaction a month later. Saint-Just arrived in Paris after such a great victory only to die with Maximilien Robespierre and the other leading Jacobins.

<text>The Battle of Eylau, or Battle of Preussisch-Eylau, was a bloody and strategically inconclusive battle on 7 and 8 February 1807 between Napoleon&#x27;s and the Imperial Russian Army under the command of General Levin August von Bennigsen near the town of Preussisch Eylau in East Prussia. Late in the battle, the Russians received timely reinforcements from a Prussian division of von L&#x27;Estocq. After 1945, the town was renamed Bagrationovsk as part of Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia. The engagement was fought during the War of the Fourth Coalition, part of the Napoleonic Wars.

Napoleon&#x27;s armies had smashed the army of the Austrian Empire in the Ulm Campaign and the combined Austrian and Russian armies at the Battle of Austerlitz on 2 December 1805. On 14 October 1806, Napoleon crushed the armies of the Kingdom of Prussia at the Battle of Jena–Auerstedt and hunted down the scattered Prussians at Prenzlau, Lübeck, Erfurt, Pasewalk, Stettin, Magdeburg and Hamelin.

In late January, Bennigsen&#x27;s Russian army went on the offensive in East Prussia, pushing far to the west. Napoleon reacted by mounting a counteroffensive to the north, hoping to prevent their retreat to the east. After his Cossacks had captured a copy of Napoleon&#x27;s orders, Bennigsen rapidly withdrew to the northeast to avoid being cut off. The French pursued for several days and found the Russians drawn up for battle at Eylau.

In a vicious evening clash, the French captured the village, with heavy losses on both sides. The following day brought even more serious fighting. Early in the battle, a frontal attack by Napoleon failed, with catastrophic losses. To reverse the situation, he launched a massed cavalry charge against the Russians. That bought enough time for the French right wing to throw its weight into the contest. The Russian left wing was soon bent back at an acute angle, and Bennigsen&#x27;s army was in danger of collapse. A Prussian corps belatedly arrived and saved the day by pushing back the French right. As darkness fell, a French corps tardily appeared on the French left. That night, Bennigsen decided to retreat, leaving Napoleon in possession of a snowy battlefield covered with thousands of dead and wounded. 

Eylau was the first serious check to the , and the myth of Napoleon&#x27;s invincibility was badly shaken. The French went on to decisively defeat Bennigsen&#x27;s army at the Battle of Friedland, four months later.

==Background==
With the Prussian army routed at Jena-Auerstedt, Napoleon occupied the major cities of Germany and marched east in pursuit of the remaining forces opposed to him. These were largely Russians under the command of the frail 68-year-old Field Marshal Count Mikhail Kamensky. The old marshal was unwilling to risk battle and continued to retreat, leaving the free to enter Poland almost unopposed. Nevertheless, as the French pressed aggressively eastward across the Vistula, they found the Russians defending the line of the Wkra River. The French seized a crossing over the Wkra on 23 December at the Battle of Czarnowo. Russian resistance soon stiffened, and on 26 December, the two armies clashed at the Battles of Pułtusk and of Gołymin. After the fierce engagements, Napoleon&#x27;s troops took up winter quarters in Poland to recuperate after a victorious but exhausting campaign.

In January 1807, the new Russian army commander, Levin August von Bennigsen, attempted to surprise the French left wing by shifting the bulk of his army north from Nowogród to East Prussia. Incorporating a Prussian corps on his right, he first bumped into elements of the VI Corps of Marshal Michel Ney, who had disobeyed his emperor&#x27;s orders and advanced far north of his assigned winter cantonments. Having cleared Ney&#x27;s troops out of the way, the Russians rolled down on the isolated French I Corps under Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte. Tough fighting at the Battle of Mohrungen allowed Bernadotte&#x27;s corps to escape serious damage and pull back to the southwest. With his customary inventiveness, Napoleon saw an opportunity to turn the situation to his own advantage. He instructed Bernadotte to withdraw before Bennigsen&#x27;s forces and ordered the balance of the to strike northward. That maneuver might envelop the Russian army&#x27;s left flank and cut off its retreat to the east. By a stroke of luck, a band of Cossacks captured a messenger carrying Napoleon&#x27;s plans to Bernadotte and quickly forwarded the information to General Pyotr Bagration. Bernadotte was left unaware, and a forewarned Bennigsen immediately ordered a retreat east to Jonkowo to avoid the trap.

As Bennigsen hurriedly assembled his army at Jonkowo, elements of Marshal Nicolas Soult&#x27;s IV Corps reached a position on his left rear on 3 February. That day, General of Division Jean François Leval clashed with Lieutenant-General Nikolay Kamensky&#x27;s 14th Division at Bergfried (Berkweda) on the Alle (Łyna) River, which flows roughly northward in the area. The French reported 306 casualties but claimed to have inflicted 1,100 on their adversaries. After seizing Allenstein (Olsztyn), Soult moved north on the east bank of the Alle. Meanwhile, Napoleon threatened Bennigsen from the south with Marshal Pierre Augereau&#x27;s VII Corps and Ney&#x27;s forces. Kamensky held the west bank with four Russian battalions and three Prussian artillery batteries. After an initial attack on Bergfried had been driven back, the French captured the village and bridge. A Russian counterattack briefly recaptured the bridge. That night, the French remained in possession of the field, and Soult claimed that he had found 800 Russian dead there. Marching at night, Bennigsen retreated directly north to Wolfsdorf (Wilczowo) on the 4th. The next day, he fell back to the northeast, reaching Burgerswalde on the road to Landsberg (Górowo Iławeckie).

By early February, the Russian army was in full retreat and was relentlessly pursued by the French. After several aborted attempts to stand and fight, Bennigsen resolved to retreat to the town of Preussisch-Eylau and there make a stand. During the pursuit, perhaps influenced by the dreadful state of the Polish roads, the savage winter weather and the relative ease with which his forces had dealt with Prussia, Napoleon had allowed the to become more spread out than was his custom. In contrast, Bennigsen&#x27;s forces were already concentrated.

==Battle==

===First day===

Marshal Soult&#x27;s IV Corps and Marshal Murat&#x27;s cavalry were the first French formations to reach the plateau before Eylau at about 14:00 on the 7th. The Russian rearguard under Bagration occupied positions on the plateau about a mile in front of Eylau. The French promptly assaulted the positions and were repulsed. Bagration&#x27;s orders were to offer stiff resistance to gain time for Bennigsen&#x27;s heavy artillery to pass through Eylau and to join the Russian army in its position beyond Eylau. During the afternoon, the French were reinforced by Marshal Augereau&#x27;s corps and the Imperial Guard, giving him a force of about 45,000 soldiers in all. Under pressure of greatly superior forces, Bagration conducted an orderly retreat to join the main army. It was covered by another rearguard detachment in Eylau that was led by Barclay de Tolly.

The rearguard action continued when French forces advanced to assault Barclay&#x27;s forces in the town of Eylau. Historians differ on the reasons. Napoleon later claimed that was on his orders and that the advance had the dual aims of pinning the Russian force to prevent it from retreating yet again and of providing his soldiers with at least some shelter against the terrible cold. Other surviving evidence, however, strongly suggests that the advance was unplanned and occurred as the result of an undisciplined skirmish, which Marshals Soult and Murat should have acted to quell but failed to do so. Whether or not Napoleon and his generals had considered securing the town to provide the soldiers with shelter for the freezing night, the soldiers may have taken action on their own initiative to secure such a shelter. According to Captain Marbot, the Emperor had told Marshal Augereau that he disliked night fighting, that he wanted to wait until the morning so that he could count on Davout&#x27;s Corps to come up on the right wing and Ney&#x27;s on the left and that the high ground before Eylau was a good easily defensible position on which to wait for reinforcements.

Whatever the cause of the fight for the town, it rapidly escalated into a large and bitterly fought engagement, continuing well after night had fallen and resulting in about 4,000 casualties to each side, including Barclay, who was shot in the arm and forced to leave the battlefield. Among other officers, French Brig. Gen. Pierre-Charles Lochet was shot and killed. At 22:00 Bennigsen ordered the Russians to retreat a short distance, leaving the town to the French. He later claimed he abandoned the town to lure the French into attacking his center the next day. Despite their possession of the town, most of the French spent the night in the open, as did all of the Russians. Both sides did without food—the Russians because of their habitual disorganization, the French because of problems with the roads, the weather and the crush of troops hurrying towards the battle.

During the night, Bennigsen withdrew some of his troops from the front line to strengthen his reserve. That resulted in the shortening of his right wing.

===Second day===


Bennigsen had 67,000 Russian troops and 400 guns already assembled, but the French had only 49,000 troops and 300 guns. The Russians could expect to be reinforced by Von L&#x27;Estocq&#x27;s detachment of 9,000 Prussians, the French by Marshal Davout&#x27;s depleted III Corps (proud victors of Auerstedt but now only 15,000 strong) and Marshal Ney&#x27;s 14,000-strong VI Corps (for a total of 74,000 men), which was shadowing the Prussians. Bernadotte&#x27;s I Corps was too far distant to take part.

Dawn brought light but little warmth and no great improvement in visibility since the heavy snowstorms continued throughout the day. The opposing forces occupied two parallel ridges. The French were active early on probing the Russian position, particularly on the Russian right. Bennigsen, fearing that the French would discover that he had shortened his right, opened the battle by ordering his artillery to fire on the French. They replied and the ensuing artillery duel lasted for some time, with the French having the best of it because of their more dispersed locations.

The start of the artillery duel galvanised Napoleon. Until then, he had expected the Russians to continue their retreat, but he now knew that he had a fight on his hands. Messengers hurriedly were dispatched to Ney to order him to march on Eylau and to join the French left wing.

Meanwhile, the French had occupied in force some fulling mill buildings within musket range of the Russian right wing. Russian jagers ejected them. Both sides escalated the fight, with the Russians assaulting the French left on Windmill Knoll to the left of Eylau. Napoleon interpreted the Russian efforts on his left as a prelude to an attack on Eylau from that quarter. By then, Davout&#x27;s III Corps had begun to arrive on the Russian left.

To forestall the perceived Russian attack on Eylau and to pin the Russian army so that Davout&#x27;s flank attack would be more successful, Napoleon launched an attack against the Russian centre and left, with Augereau&#x27;s VII Corps on the left and Saint-Hilaire&#x27;s Division of Soult&#x27;s IV Corps on the right.

Augereau was very ill and had to be helped onto his horse. Fate intervened to turn the attack into a disaster. As soon as the French marched off a blizzard descended, causing all direction to be lost. Augereau&#x27;s corps followed the slope of the land and veered off to the left, away from Saint-Hilaire. Augereau&#x27;s advance struck the Russian line at the junction of its right and centre, coming under the fire of the blinded French artillery and then point-blank fire of the massive 70-gun Russian centre battery. Meanwhile, Saint-Hilaire&#x27;s division, advancing alone in the proper direction, was unable to have much effect against the Russian left.

Augereau&#x27;s corps was thrown into great confusion with heavy losses, gives Augereau&#x27;s official tally of 929 killed and 4,271 wounded. One regiment, the 14th Ligne, was unable to retreat and fought to the last man, refusing to surrender; its eagle was carried off by Captain Marbot. Its position would be marked by a square of corpses. Bennigsen took full advantage by falling on Saint-Hilaire&#x27;s division with more cavalry and bringing up his reserve infantry to attack the devastated French centre. Augereau and 3,000 to.4,000 survivors fell back on Eylau, where they were attacked by about 5,000 Russian infantry. At one point, Napoleon himself, using the church tower as a command post, was nearly captured, but members of his personal staff held the Russians off for just long enough to allow some battalions of the Guard to come up. Counterattacked by the Guard&#x27;s bayonet charge and Bruyère&#x27;s cavalry in its rear, the attacking Russian column was nearly destroyed. For four hours, the French centre was in great disorder, virtually defenceless and in imminent danger.

With his centre almost broken, Napoleon resorted to ordering a massive charge by Murat&#x27;s 11,000-strong cavalry reserve. Aside from the Guard, that was the last major unbloodied body of troops remaining to the French.

===Cavalry charge at Eylau===


Thus began one of the greatest cavalry charges in history. Somewhat obscured by the weather, Murat&#x27;s squadrons charged through the Russian infantry around Eylau and then divided into two groups. The group on the right, Grouchy&#x27;s dragoons, charged into the flank of the Russian cavalry attacking Saint-Hilaire&#x27;s division and scattered them completely. Now led by Murat himself, the dragoons wheeled left against the Russian cavalry in the centre, and, joined by d&#x27;Hautpoult&#x27;s cuirassier division, drove the Russian cavalry back on their infantry. Fresh Russian cavalry forced Murat and the dragoons to retire, but d&#x27;Hautpoult&#x27;s cuirassiers burst through everything, and the broken Russians were cut to pieces by fresh regiments of cuirassiers.

D&#x27;Hautpoult then rode through the Russian guns, chased off or sabered the gunners, and broke through the first line of Russian infantry. He meanwhile trampled a battalion that had attempted to stand. The cuirassiers forced their way through the second line of Russians, and it was only after 2,500 yards that the charge finally expended its force in front of the Russian reserves. A second wave of cavalry consisting of the Guards, and Grouchy&#x27;s dragoons now charged the Russians as they attempted to reform and rode through both lines of infantry. Another group charged into the Russian infantry in the area in which Augereau&#x27;s corps had made its stand. Not content with the heavy blows, the cavalry reformed, wheeled and charged back again. It finally retired under the protection of the Guard cavalry. Murat had lost 1,000–1,500 well-trained troopers but relieved the pressure on Augereau, Saint-Hilaire and Soult, paralyzing the Russians long enough to allow Davout to deploy in strength. Rarely had French cavalry played such a pivotal part in a battle. That was in part because for the first time, Murat&#x27;s men were now mounted on the best cavalry horses in Europe, which had been freshly requisitioned in the aftermath of the conquest of Prussia.

Davout&#x27;s corps, about 15,000 strong, was now in position and began to drive in the Russian left. Despite the disarray of the Russian centre, Napoleon declined to follow up Murat&#x27;s charge by advancing with the Guard. Such a move might have decisively won the battle, but Napoleon, well aware that 9,000 Prussians under L&#x27;Estocq and his chief of staff, Gerhard von Scharnhorst were still unaccounted for, judged it wise to retain the Guard in reserve. Through the afternoon Soult, Augereau and Murat managed to hold their ground while Davout, assisted by Saint-Hilaire, gradually bent the Russian left back further and further, pushing it to a right angle with the Russian centre. By 15:30, it seemed that the Russians&#x27; cohesion would soon break, as their left was in full retreat.

For several crucial hours, Bennigsen could not be found. He had personally ridden to L&#x27;Estocq to urge that general to hasten the march of his Prussian corps to the battlefield. His mission was successful since L&#x27;Estocq&#x27;s 9,000-man Prussian force, having lost a third of its strength to Ney&#x27;s pursuit, approached the battlefield via the Russian right and passed completely behind the Russian position to its left wing. It gathered strength in doing so by collecting Russian stragglers and adding them to the 6,000 remaining Prussian troops. At 16:00, L&#x27;Estocq counterattacked by falling on Davout&#x27;s exposed right flank, and the heartened Russians soon launched a fresh attack against Davout. The Russian situation was also improved by the accurate fire of 36 guns under Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov. Over the next three hours, Davout was halted and forced back to a line running from the village of Kutschitten to near the village of Anklappen towards Saint-Hilaire&#x27;s right by Eylau. Davout, alert to the danger, formed a battery of his guns on the heights of Klein Sausgarten and personally rallied his troops while his guns drove the Prussians back into the woods. With nightfall, exhaustion set in and fighting on the Russian left petered out.

By then, the roar of cannons on the Russian right had announced Ney&#x27;s arrival. Napoleon had not recalled Ney until 08:00 of the 8th, when he realised that the Russians intended to fight. Although Ney was within marching distance of the battle, the heavy snow had muffled the sound of cannon fire, and he was completely unaware of the events until a messenger reached him around 10:30. Somewhat delayed by L&#x27;Estocq&#x27;s rear guard, the leading division of Ney&#x27;s corps did not reach the battlefield until around 19:00 and immediately swept forward into the Russian right and rear. Bennigsen counterattacked, and bitter fighting continued until 22:00, when both sides drew off a little. After a contentious council of war in which several of his generals forcefully argued for continuing the fight for a third day, Bennigsen at 23:00 decided to withdraw, and covered by the Cossacks, the Russians silently began to leave. The exhausted French did not even notice until 03:00 and were in no condition to pursue.

==Aftermath==
After 14 hours of continuous battle, the only result was an enormous loss of life. Authors differ greatly in their assessments of the relative losses: estimates of Russian casualties range from about 15,000 to 20,000 killed or wounded and 3,000 men, 23 cannon and 16 colors captured. Count von Bennigsen estimated his losses at up to 9,000 dead and 7,000 wounded. The French lost somewhere between 10,000 and 15,000. Connelly suggests probably over 15,000. Franceschi gives 14,000 and Adams, Petre and Dwyer give 25,000–30,000 with five eagles lost. David G. Chandler suggested as many as 25,000 French casualties but concedes that it is impossible to be certain. According to estimates of the German historian Horst Schulz, the French lost 4,893 men killed, 23,598 wounded and 1,152 missing in action, for a total of 29,643.

The French had gained possession of the battlefield, which was nothing but a vast expanse of bloodstained snow and frozen corpses, but they had suffered enormous losses and failed to destroy the Russian army. Riding over the fields of Eylau the following morning, Marshal Ney observed, &quot;Quel massacre! Et sans résultat!&quot; (&quot;What a massacre! And without result!&quot;).

The Battle of Eylau was a major contrast to the decisive victories that characterized Napoleon&#x27;s earlier campaigns, and would be a sign of the brutal slugfest for battles that were to come. By halting the French advance and leaving the two sides exhausted but evenly matched, it served only to prolong the war. After the battle, Napoleon sent General Bertrand to the King of Prussia to offer a separate peace, which would see French forces withdraw from Prussia and her borders completely restored. Prussia, wishing to continue its alliance with Russia, quickly rejected that offer. Hostilities continued until the decisive French victory at the Battle of Friedland in June 1807 forced Tsar Alexander I to the negotiating table. After a personal meeting between the two emperors, both sides signed the peace Treaties of Tilsit. They were much harsher on Prussia than the earlier peace offer and resulted in the loss of almost half of its territory.

The surgeon-in-chief of Napoleon&#x27;s Grand Army, Baron Dominique-Jean Larrey, served the wounded with the flesh of young horses as soup and &quot;bœuf à la mode&quot;. The good results encouraged him to promote the consumption of horse meat in France. Larrey is quoted in French by Béraud.

==In literature and the arts==
Antoine-Jean Gros painted in Paris in 1808.

The battle is included in Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;.

The Battle of Eylau forms the early part of the novel &quot;The Schirmer Inheritance&quot; (1953) by Eric Ambler. The brutal battle and its immediate aftermath are depicted from the point of view of an ordinary soldier, a Prussian cavalry sergeant, who is severely wounded by a French saber in the later part of the confused fighting and whose only chance of saving his life is to desert and find shelter with Polish peasants in the neighborhood.

In the novel &quot;Le Colonel Chabert&quot; of French author Honoré de Balzac, Eylau is the battle where the colonel describes having been mistakenly reported as killed.

The Battle of Eylau was reconstructed in the home computer strategy game &quot;Napoleon at War&quot; released by C.C.S. in 1986 and written by Ken Wright.

The second day of the battle was shown in the miniseries &quot;Napoléon&quot;.

<text>Mieczysław Karłowicz (, 11 December 18768 February 1909) was a Polish composer and conductor.

==Life==
Mieczysław Karłowicz was born in Vishneva, in the Vilna Governorate of the Russian Empire (now in Belarus) into a noble family belonging to Clan Ostoja. His father Jan was a Polish linguist, lexicographer, and musician. As a child, Karłowicz studied violin, for which he later composed his only concerto.

Karłowicz studied in Warsaw with Zygmunt Noskowski, Stanisław Barcewicz, Piotr Maszyński, and Gustaw Roguski. He later studied in Berlin with Heinrich Urban, to whom he dedicated his &quot;Serenade for Strings&quot;, which he composed and performed while Urban&#x27;s student. From 1906 to 1907 he studied conducting with Arthur Nikisch.

==Career==
Karłowicz&#x27;s music is of a late Romantic character. He was a great admirer of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky whose Symphony No. 6 he praised. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s influence can be heard in Karłowicz&#x27;s earlier works, most notably the E minor symphony and the Violin Concerto. Like most of the late Romantics he also fell under the considerable influence of Richard Wagner, especially with &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;. Nevertheless, he managed to develop an original musical language expressed in harmony and orchestration, the latter of which he mastered like few other composers and wrote some of the most colourful orchestral music ever found. 

Among his works are a Symphony in E minor (&quot;Rebirth&quot;, Op. 7), a Violin Concerto in A major (Op. 8), incidental music to a play &quot;The White Dove&quot;, and six tone poems, which include &quot;The Returning Waves&quot;, &quot;Eternal Songs&quot;, &quot;Lithuanian Rhapsody&quot;, &quot;Stanisław i Anna Oświecimowie&quot;, &quot;Smutna opowieść&quot;, and &quot;Epizod na maskaradzie&quot;. The Violin Concerto was written for and dedicated to his former teacher Stanisław Barcewicz, who premiered the work under Karłowicz&#x27;s baton in Berlin on 21 March 1903 with the Berlin Philharmonic.

He also wrote a number of songs for voice and piano, setting words by Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer, Adam Asnyk, and others. Much of the rest of his small output was lost during World War II. Karłowicz spent much of his later life in Zakopane in southern Poland, often enjoying one of his favorite hobbies, photography, in the nearby mountain scenery. Karłowicz died at the age of 32 in an avalanche while skiing on an excursion in the Tatra Mountains in 1909. He was buried at Warsaw&#x27;s Powązki Cemetery.

The Szczecin Philharmonic bears the name of Mieczysław Karłowicz as a recognition of the composer&#x27;s musical legacy.

<text>Cut, copy, and paste are essential commands of modern human–computer interaction and user interface design. They offer an interprocess communication technique for transferring data through a computer&#x27;s user interface. The &quot;cut&quot; command removes the selected data from its original position, and the &quot;copy&quot; command creates a duplicate; in both cases the selected data is kept in temporary storage called the clipboard. Clipboard data is later inserted wherever a &quot;paste&quot; command is issued. The data remains available to any application supporting the feature, thus allowing easy data transfer between applications.

The command names are an interface metaphor based on the physical procedure used in manuscript print editing to create a page layout, like with paper. The commands were pioneered into computing by Xerox PARC in 1974, popularized by Apple Computer in the 1983 Lisa workstation and the 1984 Macintosh computer, and in a few home computer applications such the 1984 word processor Cut &amp; Paste.

This interaction technique has close associations with related techniques in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that use pointing devices such as a computer mouse (by drag and drop, for example). Typically, clipboard support is provided by an operating system as part of its GUI and widget toolkit.

The capability to replicate information with ease, changing it between contexts and applications, involves privacy concerns because of the risks of disclosure when handling sensitive information. Terms like &quot;cloning&quot;, &quot;copy forward&quot;, &quot;carry forward&quot;, or &quot;re-use&quot; refer to the dissemination of such information through documents, and may be subject to regulation by administrative bodies.

==History==
===Origins===
The term &quot;cut and paste&quot; comes from the traditional practice in manuscript editing, whereby people cut paragraphs from a page with scissors and paste them onto another page. This practice remained standard into the 1980s. Stationery stores sold &quot;editing scissors&quot; with blades long enough to cut an 8½&quot;-wide page. The advent of photocopiers made the practice easier and more flexible.

The act of copying or transferring text from one part of a computer-based document (&quot;buffer&quot;) to a different location within the same or different computer-based document was a part of the earliest on-line computer editors. As soon as computer data entry moved from punch-cards to online files (in the mid/late 1960s) there were &quot;commands&quot; for accomplishing this operation. This mechanism was often used to transfer frequently-used commands or text snippets from additional buffers into the document, as was the case with the QED text editor.

===Early methods===
The earliest editors (designed for teleprinter terminals) provided keyboard commands to delineate a contiguous region of text, then delete or move it. Since moving a region of text requires first removing it from its initial location and then inserting it into its new location, various schemes had to be invented to allow for this multi-step process to be specified by the user. Often this was done with a &quot;move&quot; command, but some text editors required that the text be first put into some temporary location for later retrieval/placement. In 1983, the Apple Lisa became the first text editing system to call that temporary location &quot;the clipboard&quot;.

Earlier control schemes such as NLS used a verb—object command structure, where the command name was provided first and the object to be copied or moved was second. The inversion from verb—object to object—verb on which copy and paste are based, where the user selects the object to be operated before initiating the operation, was an innovation crucial for the success of the desktop metaphor as it allowed copy and move operations based on direct manipulation.

===Popularization===
Inspired by early line and character editors, such as Pentti Kanerva&#x27;s TV-Edit, that broke a move or copy operation into two steps—between which the user could invoke a preparatory action such as navigation—Lawrence G. &quot;Larry&quot; Tesler proposed the names &quot;cut&quot; and &quot;copy&quot; for the first step and &quot;paste&quot; for the second step. Beginning in 1974, he and colleagues at Xerox PARC implemented several text editors that used cut/copy-and-paste commands to move and copy text.

Apple Computer popularized this paradigm with its Lisa (1983) and Macintosh (1984) operating systems and applications. The functions were mapped to key combinations using the key as a special modifier, which is held down while also pressing for cut, for copy, or for paste. These few keyboard shortcuts allow the user to perform all the basic editing operations, and the keys are clustered at the left end of the bottom row of the standard QWERTY keyboard.

These are the standard shortcuts:
* Control-Z (or ) to undo
* Control-X (or ) to cut
* Control-C (or ) to copy
* Control-V (or ) to paste

The IBM Common User Access (CUA) standard also uses combinations of the Insert, Del, Shift and Control keys. Early versions of Windows used the IBM standard. Microsoft later also adopted the Apple key combinations with the introduction of Windows, using the control key as modifier key. For users migrating to Windows from DOS this was a big change as DOS users used the &quot;COPY&quot; and &quot;MOVE&quot; commands.

Similar patterns of key combinations, later borrowed by others, are widely available in most GUI applications.

The original cut, copy, and paste workflow, as implemented at PARC, utilizes a unique workflow: With two windows on the same screen, the user could use the mouse to pick a point at which to make an insertion in one window (or a segment of text to replace). Then, by holding shift and selecting the copy source elsewhere on the same screen, the copy would be made as soon as the shift was released. Similarly, holding shift and control would copy and cut (delete) the source. This workflow requires many fewer keystrokes/mouse clicks than the current multi-step workflows, and did not require an explicit copy buffer. It was dropped, one presumes, because the original Apple and IBM GUIs were not high enough density to permit multiple windows, as were the PARC machines, and so multiple simultaneous windows were rarely used.

==Cut and paste==

Computer-based editing can involve very frequent use of cut-and-paste operations. Most software-suppliers provide several methods for performing such tasks, and this can involve (for example) key combinations, pulldown menus, pop-up menus, or toolbar buttons.
# The user selects or &quot;highlights&quot; the text or file for moving by some method, typically by dragging over the text or file name with the pointing-device or holding down the Shift key while using the arrow keys to move the text cursor.
# The user performs a &quot;cut&quot; operation via key combination ( for Macintosh users), menu, or other means.
# Visibly, &quot;cut&quot; text immediately disappears from its location. &quot;Cut&quot; files typically change color to indicate that they will be moved.
# Conceptually, the text has now moved to a location often called the clipboard. The clipboard typically remains invisible. On most systems only one clipboard location exists, hence another cut or copy operation overwrites the previously stored information. Many UNIX text-editors provide multiple clipboard entries, as do some Macintosh programs such as Clipboard Master, and Windows clipboard-manager programs such as the one in Microsoft Office.
# The user selects a location for insertion by some method, typically by clicking at the desired insertion point.
# A &quot;paste&quot; operation takes place which visibly inserts the clipboard text at the insertion point. (The paste operation does not typically destroy the clipboard text: it remains available in the clipboard and the user can insert additional copies at other points).
Whereas cut-and-paste often takes place with a mouse-equivalent in Windows-like GUI environments, it may also occur entirely from the keyboard, especially in UNIX text editors, such as Pico or vi. Cutting and pasting without a mouse can involve a selection (for which is pressed in most graphical systems) or the entire current line, but it may also involve text after the cursor until the end of the line and other more sophisticated operations.

The clipboard usually stays invisible, because the operations of cutting and pasting, while actually independent, usually take place in quick succession, and the user (usually) needs no assistance in understanding the operation or maintaining mental context. Some application programs provide a means of viewing, or sometimes even editing, the data on the clipboard.

==Copy and paste==
The term &quot;copy-and-paste&quot; refers to the popular, simple method of reproducing text or other data from a source to a destination. It differs from cut and paste in that the original source text or data does not get deleted or removed. The popularity of this method stems from its simplicity and the ease with which users can move data between various applications visually – without resorting to permanent storage.

Use in healthcare documentation and electronic health records are sensitive, with potential for the introduction of medical errors, information overload, and fraud.

<text>Boaz (; Hebrew: בֹּעַז &quot;Bōʿaz&quot;; ) is a biblical figure appearing in the Book of Ruth in the Hebrew Bible and in the genealogies of Jesus in the New Testament and also the name of a pillar in the portico of the historic Temple in Jerusalem. The word is found 24 times in the Scriptures, two being in Greek (in the form &quot;Βοόζ (Booz)&quot;).

The root בעז, just used in the Bible in relation to &quot;Boaz&quot; (see &quot;The Temple&quot;), perhaps expresses &#x27;quick(ness)&#x27;. The etymology of the name has been suggested by many as &quot;be&#x27;oz&quot;, &quot;in the strength of&quot;, or &quot;bo&#x27;oz&quot;, &quot;in him (is) strength&quot; from the root &#x27;zz, &quot;to be strong&quot;, hence the use of the name &quot;Boaz&quot; for one of the pillars at the portico of the temple (), although Biblical scholar Martin Noth preferred &quot;of sharp mind&quot;.

==Bible narrative==
===Hebrew Bible===
The son of Salmon, Boaz was a wealthy landowner of Bethlehem in Judea, and relative of Elimelech, Naomi&#x27;s late husband. He notices Ruth, the widowed Moabite daughter-in-law of Naomi, a relative of his (see family tree), gleaning grain in his fields. He soon learns of the difficult circumstances her family is in and Ruth&#x27;s loyalty to Naomi. In response, Boaz invites her to eat with him and his workers, as well as deliberately leaving grain for her to claim while keeping a protective eye on her. 

In the bible he functions as the power center for the entire further development. For example he brings about the acceptance of Ruth and the reacceptance of Naomi as well.

Ruth approaches Boaz and asks him to exercise his right of kinship and marry her. Boaz accepts, provided that another with a superior claim declines. Since the first son of Ruth and a kinsman of her late husband would be deemed the legal offspring of the decedent and heir to Elimelech, the other kinsman defers to Boaz.

In marrying Ruth, Boaz revives Elimelech&#x27;s lineage, and the patrimony is secured to Naomi&#x27;s family.

Their son was Obed, father of Jesse, and grandfather of David.

According to Josephus, he lived at the time of Eli.

===The Temple===
According to the First Book of Kings and the Second Book of Chronicles, &quot;Boaz&quot; was the name of the left one of the two frontal columns of Solomon&#x27;s Temple, the other being &quot;Jachin&quot; (Hebrew: ). It has variously been supposed to be an acronym a word unto itself, or part of a two-word sentence with the other pillar. Its meaning has been given variously as: the name of an architect or donor (by [[Wilhelm Gesenius), &quot;sons of Solomon&quot; (by [[Heinrich Ewald]]), &quot;in strength&quot; (by Samuel Öttli) &quot;he (God) establisheth in strength&quot; (by Otto Thenius, along with the other pillar), or &quot;Owner/Lord of the strength&quot; (by [[August Klostermann]], along with the other pillar).

===New Testament===
Boaz is mentioned in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] as the son of Salmon and [[Rahab]] (seemingly Rahab of Jericho) and as an ancestor of Jesus.

==Rabbinic Jewish tradition==
===Conduct===
In the [[Talmud]], some rabbis identify Boaz with the judge [[Ibzan]] of [[Bethlehem]]. &quot;I.e., [[Bethlehem of Galilee|Bethlehem in Zebulun]]&quot;; cf. . However, Boaz &quot;of Ruth&quot; was from [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]], whereas the two [[Biblical judges|chieftains]] immediately before Ibzan were from [[Tribe of Zebulun|Zebulun]]. A legend is given that he lost all his sixty children during his lifetime because he did not invite [[Manoah]], [[Samson]]&#x27;s father, to any of the marriage festivities at his house. Since Manoah was at that time without children, Boaz thought he did not need to consider on such occasions a childless man who could not pay him back in kind (&quot;[[Bava Batra]]&quot; 91a).

The &quot;Talmud&quot; tells that Boaz was a just, pious, and learned judge. The custom of using the [[Names of God in Judaism|Divine Name]] in greeting one&#x27;s fellow-man (Rt-2.4) formulated by him and his &quot;[[bet din]]&quot; (&quot;court [of] law&quot;) received the approval of even the heavenly &quot;bet din&quot; (&quot;[[Talmud#Talmud Bavli .28Babylonian Talmud.29|Babylonian Talmud]]&quot; &quot;[[Makkot]]&quot; 23b; &quot;[[Talmud#Talmud Yerushalmi .28Jerusalem Talmud.29|Yerushalmi Talmud]]&quot; Ber. ix. 14c; [[Midrash]] &quot;[[Ruth Rabbah]]&quot; to ii. 4).

The midrash &quot;Ruth Rabbah&quot; states that being a pious man, Boaz on his first meeting with Ruth perceived her conscientiousness in picking up the grain, as she strictly observed the rules prescribed by the [[Torah|Law]]. This, as well as her grace and her chaste conduct during work, induced Boaz to inquire about the stranger, although he was not in the habit of inquiring after women (&quot;Ruth Rabba&quot; to ii. 5; Talmudic tractate &quot;Shabbat&quot; 113b).

In the conversation that followed between Boaz and Ruth, the pious proselyte said that, being a [[Moab]]ite, she was excluded from association with the community of God (Deuteronomy 23:3). Boaz, however, replied that the prohibition in the Scripture applied only to the men of Moaband [[Women in the Hebrew Bible|not to the women]]. He furthermore told her that he had heard from the [[prophet]]s that she was destined to become the ancestress of kings and prophets; and he blessed her with the words: &quot;May God, who rewards the pious, also reward you&quot; ([[Targum]] &quot;Ruth&quot; ii. 10, 11; &quot;Pesiḳ&quot;, ed. Buber, xvi. 124a). Boaz was especially friendly toward the poor stranger during the meal, when he indicated to her by various symbolic courtesies that she would become the ancestress of the [[Davidic line|Davidic royal house]], including the [[Jewish Messiah|Messiah]] (&quot;Ruth R.&quot; to ii. 14; &quot;Shab.&quot; 113b). As toward Ruth, Boaz had also been kind toward his kinsmen, Naomi&#x27;s sons, on hearing of their death, taking care that they had an honorable burial (&quot;Ruth Rabba&quot; to 2.20).

===Boaz and Ruth===

Although Boaz was the prince of the people, he personally supervised the threshing of the grain in his barn, in order to circumvent any immorality or theft, both of which were rife in his days (Tan., Behar, ed. Buber, viii.; &quot;Ruth Rabba&quot; to iii. 7). Glad in his heart that the famine was over in Israel, he sought rest after having thanked God and [[Torah study|studied]] for a while in the &quot;Torah&quot; (Tan., l.c.; Targum &quot;Ruth&quot; iii. 7; and &quot;Ruth Rabba&quot; ib.). Aroused out of his first sleep by Ruth, he was greatly frightened, as he thought she was a devil; and he was convinced of the contrary only after touching the hair of her head, since devils were believed to be bald (Tan., l.c.). When he perceived Ruth&#x27;s pure and holy intentions he not only did not reprove her for her unusual behavior, he blessed her and gave her six measures of barley, indicating thereby that six pious men should spring from her, who would be gifted by God with six excellences (cf. ; &quot;Sanhedrin&quot; 93b; &quot;Numbers Rabba&quot; xiii. 11; &quot;Ruth Rabba&quot; and &quot;Targum to Ruth&quot; iii. 15; the names of the six men differ in these passages, but David and the Messiah are always among them). Boaz fulfilled the promises he had given to Ruth, and when his kinsman (the sources differ as to the precise relationship existing between them) would not marry her because he did not know the &quot;[[halakah]]&quot; which decreed that Moabite women were not excluded from the Israelitic community, Boaz himself married.

<text>The Battle of Sainte-Foy () sometimes called the Battle of Quebec (), was fought on April 28, 1760 near the British-held town of Quebec in the French province of Canada during the Seven Years&#x27; War (called the French and Indian War in the United States). It was a victory for the French under the Chevalier de Lévis over the British army under General Murray. The battle was notably bloodier than the Battle of the Plains of Abraham of the previous September, with 833 French casualties to 1,124 British casualties.

At first the British had some success, but the advance masked their artillery, while the infantry became bogged down in the mud and melting snowdrifts of the late spring. The battle turned into a two-hour fight at close range; eventually, as more French soldiers joined the fray, the French turned the British flanks, forcing Murray to realize his mistake and to recall the British back to Quebec without their guns, which Lévis then turned on the city.

==Background==
New France had suffered significant setbacks in the 1758 campaigns of the French and Indian War. Its fortress at Louisbourg was lost in a siege by British forces, and Fort Duquesne was abandoned to another advancing British army. The situation got worse in 1759 when Fort Carillon and Fort Niagara were taken by the British, and the key city of Quebec fell after a prolonged siege and the Battle of the Plains of Abraham of September 13, 1759. The French army regrouped in Montreal under General Chevalier de Lévis. Meanwhile, the British army, left behind in Quebec after the fleet sailed at the end of October 1759, suffered from hunger, scurvy and the difficulties of living in a city that they had largely destroyed in the siege.

In April 1760, Lévis returned to Quebec with an army of over 7,000 men, including Canadien militia and First Nations warriors. He hoped to besiege Quebec and force its surrender in the spring, when he expected a French fleet to arrive in his support

General James Murray, left in command at Quebec, believed that his army was too small to adequately defend the walls of Quebec, which had not been improved since the British capture of the town. He therefore moved some 3,800 men into the field, all he could muster, along with over twenty cannon, to the same position that Montcalm had occupied for the 1759 battle. Rather than wait for the French to advance, however, he took the gamble of going on the offensive.

==Battle==

===Forces===
Lévis commanded 6,910 soldiers, including 3,889 in eight regular battalions. Compagnies Franches de la Marine comprised two more battalions. The remainder of his army was made up of Canadien militia, plus a handful of native allies. Of this force, approximately 5,000 and only three cannons were present on the field of Sainte-Foy.

Murray&#x27;s 3,886-man force consisted of ten regular battalions, a converged light infantry battalion, and two companies of rangers. In order to cover the entire plateau, the battalions were each drawn up in two ranks with three-foot gaps between files, instead of the normal elbow-to-elbow formation. There were 40-yard intervals between battalions. The light infantry covered the right flank. In order, from right to left, were the 48th Foot, 15th Foot, 58th Foot, 2nd battalion of the 60th Foot, 43rd Foot, 47th Foot, 78th Foot, and 28th Foot. The rangers and some volunteers covered the left flank. In reserve behind the right flank stood the 35th Foot, while the 3rd battalion of the 60th formed the left flank reserve. The infantry were supported by 20 cannons and two howitzers. One sergeant recorded that the British army was &quot;a poor pitiful handful of half starved scorbutic skeletons.&quot;

===North flank===
Observing that the French army was still deploying, Murray resolved to strike his enemies before they were ready. As the British advanced, Lévis pulled his three formed right wing brigades back into the Sillery Woods. At this time, the French left wing had not yet deployed. The British light infantry drove some French grenadiers out of a windmill on the right flank. Pursuing, they soon ran into trouble. The French left wing troops aggressively attacked and scattered the light infantry. Murray committed the 35th Foot from his reserve and restored the right flank of the British line. However, a bitter struggle for possession of the windmill continued.

===Decision===
The British left flank troops captured some redoubts, but then Lévis launched a powerful counterattack with his right wing. Murray sent in his final reserve, the 3/60th to stop this attack. He also pulled out the 43rd Foot from his center, which Levis had mostly ignored, and moved it to support his left flank. However, the British left flank finally gave way after suffering heavy losses, and the line collapsed from left to right. Lévis later claimed that he tried to cut the British off from Quebec, but a mischance allowed his enemies to escape. Instead of attacking straight ahead, as ordered, one of his right wing brigades went astray, heading over to help the left wing.

At the beginning of the action the numerous British cannon kept the French attacks at bay. The French advance gained momentum when the guns began to run out of ammunition. When Murray ordered the line forward, their ammunition carts had become bogged in the snow. The British spiked and abandoned their guns in the retreat.

==Result==

===Casualties===
The British army suffered 292 killed, 837 wounded, and 53 captured, for a total of 1,182 casualties. The French lost 833 men, including 193 killed and 640 wounded. The 15th Foot lost 138 out of 386 soldiers of all ranks, or 34% casualties. Three-quarters of the officers of the Fraser Highlanders (78th) were killed or wounded. This makes the Battle of Sainte-Foy one of the bloodiest engagements ever fought on Canadian soil.

===Failed siege===

Lévis was, however, unable to retake Quebec. The British retreated behind the city&#x27;s walls, and withstood Lévis&#x27; feeble siege until the arrival of naval reinforcements in May. The French fleet never arrived, because France&#x27;s naval hopes were smashed at Quiberon Bay the previous fall and the few supply ships sent from France were lost in the Bay of Chaleur in the Battle of Restigouche. HMS &quot;Lowestoffe&quot; raised her flag as she neared Quebec followed by HMS &quot;Diana&quot;, and HMS &quot;Vanguard&quot; under Commodore Swanton which then destroyed Levis&#x27; support ships on the Saint Lawrence. He quickly raised the siege and retreated to Montreal, where he surrendered in September to overwhelming British forces that approached the city from three directions.

==Memory==

&quot;The Monument des Braves,&quot; in Quebec in 1863, commemorated the Battle of Sainte-Foy. It began a wave of commemorations that took place across Canada between 1850 and 1930. They were designed to create positive memories, leave out the harshness of the British conquest, and bring Anglophones and Francophones closer together.

The battle and its aftermath, with the fruits of the French victory snatched by the arrival of British warships, was dramatized by modernist poet F. R. Scott in, &quot;On the Terrace, Quebec&quot;:

<text>The Battle of Ligny, in which French troops of the under the command of Napoleon I defeated part of a Prussian army under Field Marshal Blücher, was fought on 16 June 1815 near Ligny in what is now Belgium. The result was a tactical victory for the French, but the bulk of the Prussian army survived the battle in good order, was reinforced by Prussian troops who had not fought at Ligny, and played a role two days later at the Battle of Waterloo. Ligny was the last victory in Napoleon&#x27;s military career.

==Prelude==
On 13 March 1815, six days before Napoleon reached Paris, the powers at the Congress of Vienna declared him an outlaw; four days later, the United Kingdom, Russia, Austria, and Prussia bound themselves to put 150,000 men each into the field to end his rule. Napoleon knew that once his attempts at dissuading one or more of the Seventh Coalition Allies from invading France had failed, his only chance of remaining in power was to attack before the Coalition could put together an overwhelming force. If he could destroy the existing Coalition forces south of Brussels before they were reinforced, he might be able to drive the British back to the sea and knock the Prussians out of the war.
The Duke of Wellington expected Napoleon to try to envelop the Coalition armies, a maneuver that he had successfully used many times before, by moving through Mons to the south-west of Brussels. The roads to Mons were paved, which would have enabled a rapid flank march. This would have cut Wellington&#x27;s communications with his base at Ostend, but would also have pushed his army closer to Blücher&#x27;s. In fact, Napoleon planned instead to divide the two Coalition armies and defeat them separately, and he encouraged Wellington&#x27;s misapprehension with false intelligence. Moving up to the frontier without alerting the Coalition, Napoleon divided his army into three elements which remained close enough to support one another: a left wing commanded by Marshal Ney, a right wing commanded by Marshal Grouchy, and a reserve, which he commanded personally. Crossing the frontier at Thuin near Charleroi before dawn on 15 June, the French rapidly overran Coalition outposts and secured Napoleon&#x27;s favored &quot;central position&quot; at the junction between the area where Wellington&#x27;s allied army was dispersed to his north-west, and Blücher&#x27;s Prussian army to the north-east.
Only very late on the night of 15 June was Wellington certain that the Charleroi attack was the main French thrust, and he duly ordered his army to deploy near Nivelles and Quatre Bras. Early on the morning of 16 June, at the Duchess of Richmond&#x27;s ball, on receiving a dispatch from the Prince of Orange, he was shocked by the speed of Napoleon&#x27;s advance, and hastily sent his army in the direction of Quatre Bras, where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, was holding a tenuous position against the French left commanded by Marshal Ney. Ney&#x27;s orders were to secure the crossroads of Quatre Bras so that if necessary he could later swing east and reinforce Napoleon.

As Napoleon considered the concentrated Prussian army the greater threat, he moved against them first. Lieutenant-General Zieten&#x27;s I Corps rearguard action on 15 June held up the French advance, allowing Blücher to concentrate his forces in the Sombreffe position, which had been selected earlier for its good defensive attributes.

Napoleon&#x27;s original plan for 16 June was based on the assumption that the Coalition forces, which had been caught napping, would not attempt a risky forward concentration, and he intended, therefore, to push an advance guard as far as Gembloux, to feel for and ward off Blücher. To assist this operation the reserve would move at first to Fleurus to reinforce Grouchy, should he need assistance in driving back Blücher&#x27;s troops; but, once in possession of Sombreffe, Napoleon would swing the reserve westwards and join Ney, who, it was supposed, would have in the meantime mastered Quatre Bras.

In pursuance of this object Ney, to whom III Cavalry Corps (Kellermann) was now attached, was to mass at Quatre Bras and push an advanced guard northward of that place, with a connecting division at Marbais to link him with Grouchy. The centre and left-wing together would then make a night-march to Brussels. The Coalition forces would thus be irremediably sundered, and all that remained would be to destroy them in detail. Napoleon now awaited further information from his wing commanders at Charleroi, where he massed the VI Corps (Lobau), to save it, if possible, from a harassing countermarch, as it appeared likely that it would only be wanted for the march to Brussels. Ney spent the morning in massing his I and II corps, and in reconnoitring the enemy at Quatre Bras, who, as he was informed, had been reinforced. But up till noon, he took no serious step to capture the crossroads, which then lay at his mercy. Grouchy meantime reported from Fleurus that Prussians were coming up from Namur, but Napoleon does not appear to have attached much importance to this report. He was still at Charleroi when, between 09:00 and 10:00, further news reached him from the left that considerable hostile forces were visible at Quatre Bras. He at once wrote to Ney saying that these could only be some of Wellington&#x27;s troops and that Ney was to concentrate his force and crush what was in front of him, adding that he was to send all reports to Fleurus. Then, keeping Lobau provisionally at Charleroi, Napoleon hastened to Fleurus, arriving about 11:00.

==Armies==

The French &quot;Armee du Nord&quot; (Army of the North) was commanded by veteran officers and headed by Napoleon himself, who had won dozens of battles. Directly under him were three Marshals, Grouchy, Ney, and Soult, all generals of renown and bravery. The corps and division generals were well known for ability and with several campaigns behind them. The troops of the Army of the North were, for the most part, experienced veterans who had seen at least one battle. While the mix of veterans was higher than in either of the other armies, many of the troops had never worked with one another before nor under their officers. Trust in one another and their officers was therefore in short supply. For all that we may count the veterans, it was noted that there were many in the French formations that had never been under fire. In the words of Henri Houssaye, &quot;Napoleon had never held in his hand an instrument so fearsome or fragile&quot;. In equipment and supply, the French were well set with both, although the Guard units had to suffer standard weapons, and the Army of the North had more cavalry than their opponents throughout the four days of battle that would follow and end at Waterloo.

By contrast, the Prussian Army was, at this point, in a state of disorganization and rebuilding. According to historian Peter Hofschröer &quot;The armed forces fielded by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815 were in terms of quality of manpower, equipment, and coherence of organization probably the worst fielded by Prussia in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.&quot; The Prussian cavalry was reorganizing and converting the Freecorps and Legions into regular cavalry formations. The artillery was lacking guns and needed equipment and guns and equipment continued to arrive from Prussia even as the battles were raging. No less than one-third of the Prussian Infantry consisted of &quot;Landwehr&quot; (militia) and, unlike the &quot;Landwehr&quot; of 1813/1814, these were untrained. Hofschröer says that &quot;they could be counted to go forward in disorder and retreat in chaos&quot;. To further compound the Prussians&#x27; problems, the Saxon and Rhinelander contingents were recent additions to the Prussian Army and, having been until recently part of the French Army, they were reluctant to participate. Some Saxons rebelled and were sent home before the French advanced, and many of the Rhinelanders would also desert and head home during the battle.

==Prussian preparations==
The Prussians were not caught napping and set up a series of artillery/cavalry outposts whereby the cavalry patrolled the front and raced back to the artillery which would fire cannon in a prearranged signal. In this way, the thinly stretched 1st and 2nd Brigades were promptly alerted and began rapid assembly. General Zieten&#x27;s I Corps began a difficult fighting withdrawal, giving time for the Prussian Army to assemble.
The post chain was a relay of towns, each set up as a fortified village. Each was commanded by a Prussian officer who made sure that the post kept enough horses, forage, and troops to move messages efficiently along. Also, these posts served as intelligence posts where surveillance would take place, stragglers would be collected, and wandering civilians would be closely questioned. A posted chain was set up back to Blücher&#x27;s command post so that the Headquarters was alerted from the time of the first French deployment. General Steinmetz&#x27; 1st brigade of the I Corps had been very active in touring his outposts on 12 May, 17 May, 21 May, and 9 June. Out posting and intelligence collection were given proper weight.

Reports sent back to General Steinmetz indicated that an attack was seen as imminent as soon as 12 June.
During the period of 12 June through to 14 June reports were sent by the I Corps brigade commanders and General Zieten himself to General Blücher and General Wellington. Also, communications were made with the Dutch cavalry adjoining I Corps position to the west. Notably, General Steinmetz ordered his brigade to assemble for defense on the night of 13 June and General Pirch II on the morning of the 14th, so thick was French deployments to their front. The first French attacks were to take place on 15 June.

==Converging towards battle==
On 15 June Napoleon had crossed the Sambre at Charleroi and had pushed a wedge between Wellington and Blücher. His army was divided into three parts: on the left-wing one corps and two cavalry divisions stood under the command of Marshal Ney, on the right-wing two cavalry corps under Marshal Grouchy and in the centre three corps (including the Imperial Guard) and Milhaud&#x27;s IV Cavalry Corps (cuirassiers) as a heavy cavalry reserve under the command of Napoleon. Napoleon&#x27;s most important goal consisted of keeping the two opposing armies separated and striking each individually. For this purpose, Ney would move against the Anglo-allies on Quatre Bras and hold Wellington&#x27;s forces there. At the same time the French III Corps under Vandamme and IV Corps under Gérard would attack the Prussians frontally on their line of defense between Wagnelée, Saint-Amand and Ligny, while Grouchy marched on Sombreffe. Vandamme&#x27;s corps was reinforced by General Girard&#x27;s 7th Infantry Division, detached from Reille&#x27;s II Corps, the bulk of which was at Quatre Bras. Napoleon wanted to advance in the centre of the Prussian position at Fleurus and decide the battle with a final advance by the Old Guard. The plan of separation of opposing armies and defeat in detail was an old and favored stratagem of Napoleon&#x27;s, dating back to his operations in Italy, and had been the deciding factor in his campaigns in Austria, and in his battles with the Fifth Coalition.

Blücher&#x27;s troops consisted of the I Prussian Corps under Zieten, the II Corps under Pirch I and the III Corps under Thielmann. The I Corps was located in the foremost row and had support from the II Corps standing behind it – the task, the defence of the villages of Ligny, Brye, and Saint-Amand, while the III Corps formed the left wing and the routes of withdrawal while defending Gembloux and Namur. Blücher and Wellington had to avoid above all being separated. Still in the morning of the battle Wellington rode to a meeting with Blücher at the windmill of Brye (or Bussy) and promised Blücher the support of at least one Anglo-allied corps. After the break for discussion with Blücher, Wellington left for Quatre Bras.

William Siborne, writing from eyewitness accounts, records it thus: 
In reaction to the troop movements of the French, II and III Corps began sending reinforcements to I Corps under General Ziethen. The Prussian front lines were too long for the troops immediately available and were dependent on the arrival of the IV Corps under Bülow advancing from Liège and the support of the promised Anglo-allied corps.

The Prussians now faced the French with 82,700 troops, with the French Army numbering around 60,800 available troops.

==Battlefield==

The battlefield of Ligny was on the watershed between the rivers Scheldt and Meuse. The Ligny stream rises to the west of Fleurus and meanders in a northeast direction through the small village of Ligny to the confluence at Sombreffe. The stream was only a few metres wide at its edges, however, it was swampy in parts so that the bridges at Saint-Amand and Ligny were strategically important. This dictated that villages of Ligny, and St Amand and Wagnelée – connected by the hamlets of Saint Amand-le-Hameau and Saint Amand-la-Haye – were the best defensive position because they were sturdily built and surrounded by trees. The remaining parts of the battlefield consisted of fields of grain as high as a man. The windmill of Brye on a hill north-west from Ligny was a suitable vantage point and Blücher made it his headquarters during the battle. Napoleon placed his headquarters in Fleurus, where he also had a good view of the battlefield from the windmill of Naveau.

==Battle==

===Saint-Amand===
Napoleon delayed his attack until about 14:30 when he heard cannon fire coming from the direction of Quatre Bras, and thus knew that his left flank was secure. This delay also gave Gérard&#x27;s IV Corps more time to deploy as it had only recently arrived in Fleurus from the south-west, and had an important role to play in Napoleon&#x27;s plan of attack on Ligny. Both delays meant that there was less time to win a decisive victory before night fell.

Napoleon began the attack with a cannonade by the Guards artillery positioned around Fleurus. Shortly afterwards Vandamme&#x27;s III French Corps (Girard&#x27;s 7th Infantry Division attached on its left) attacked the hamlet of Saint-Amand-la-Haye. Jagow&#x27;s 3rd Prussian Brigade, defending Saint-Amand-la-Haye, could not withstand the pressure of Lefol&#x27;s 8th Division and was forced to retreat. Shortly afterwards a counterattack by General Steinmetz with six battalions of the 1st Brigade recaptured the hamlet. A renewed attack by Vandamme&#x27;s troops led to a bitter fight in which the Prussians lost approximately 2,500 men and possession of Saint-Amand-la-Haye.

With the loss of Saint-Amand-la-Haye, Blücher&#x27;s right flank threatened to give way, so he ordered Pirch II&#x27;s 2nd Prussian Brigade to retake Saint-Amand-la-Haye. Although Girard was mortally wounded (dying in Paris on 25 June of his wounds) the French held the hamlet, so Blücher ordered Tippelskirch to envelop the French with an attack by units of the II Corps on the left flank of the hamlet. French reinforcements (Vandamme&#x27;s III Corps) deployed in front of Wagnelée prevented this happening, attacking Tippelskirch&#x27;s brigades as they marched out of the grain fields to get into position for their attack. They were driven into the hamlet.

Blücher left his observation post in the windmill of Brye and intervened personally in the fight. Under his guidance, the Prussian counter-attack on the French, very weak from the preceding actions, succeeded, and Saint-Amand-la-Haye was again in Prussian hands. Thus at 19:00 Saint-Amand, Saint-Amand-la-Haye and Wagnelée were still held by the Prussians.

===Ligny===
At 15:00 Gérard&#x27;s IV French Corps opened the battle around Ligny. Under heavy Prussian artillery fire Pécheux&#x27;s 12th Infantry Division succeeded in capturing the church in the village of Ligny. With this success, however, came a price as the division now found itself under a violent bombardment from three sides. In a short time, Pécheux&#x27;s division lost 20 officers and 500 men and had to withdraw. Napoleon sent a battery of 12-pounders to support another attack and with the IV Corps artillery set numerous buildings in Ligny aflame. Another attack followed with vicious house-to-house fighting, then Jagow&#x27;s 3rd Prussian Brigade counter-attacked and recaptured the town.

The Prussian second lieutenant, Gerhard Andreas von Garrelts, later gave an eye-witness account of the agonies of the Belgian civilian population, caught unexpectedly in the centre of battle:

===Missed chance===
At about 17:00 Field-Marshal Blücher employed the still-fresh II Corps under the command of General Pirch I and ordered him to deploy it into the area south of Brye. At about the same time Vandamme on the left French flank sighted a force of twenty to thirty thousand men advancing on Fleurus, which he incorrectly took to be enemy troops. Napoleon, who was preparing to launch a crucial attack at the centre of Blücher&#x27;s line, was very surprised by this news because at 15:30 he had sent Comte de la Bédoyère with a written note to Marshal Ney at Quatre Bras ordering him to send d&#x27;Erlon&#x27;s I Corps to attack the rear of the right Prussian flank. Instead, it seemed that the troops seen by Vandamme threatened the French left flank.

D&#x27;Erlon had gone on ahead of his corps (marching west towards Quatre Bras) to reconnoitre. Bédoyère, realising that time was of the essence, had on his initiative ordered the I Corps to turn east towards Ligny. Its leading elements came into view at 17:00, that is to say, earlier than Napoleon expected. Marshal Ney, unaware of Napoleon&#x27;s instructions, sent an order to d&#x27;Erlon to immediately turn around and march back towards Quatre Bras. D&#x27;Erlon, who had caught up with his troops, turned them around only a few kilometres away from Ligny. Crucially, the I Corps did not fight in either battle that day.

Blücher took advantage of the hesitation of the French by ordering an attack on the French left flank. From his observation post in the mill of Brye, Blücher could observe how his troops fared to the west of Saint Amand. Vandamme&#x27;s III Corps received unexpected support from Duhesme&#x27;s Young Guard and the Prussians were thrown back to their original positions.

===Prussian counter-attack===
At 19:00 the situation on the battlefield was as follows: Grouchy&#x27;s cavalry had captured Tongrenelle and advanced on Mont-Potiaux; in the centre, heavy fighting was taking place around Ligny; on the Prussian right flank, there was a lull in the fighting between the Young Guard and the Prussians.

It was now that Blücher received a message that Wellington was heavily engaged fighting Ney&#x27;s left wing of the French army and, therefore, could on no account send support to Ligny. So Blücher decided to counter-attack on the French left flank, to force a decision. First, he strengthened his tired forces in Ligny, and then he collected his last reserves and personally led an attack on Saint-Amand. The attack was initially successful and the Prussians managed to recapture Saint-Amand-le-Hameau, but the attack faltered and they were counter-attacked by chasseurs of the Imperial Guard west of Saint-Amand and started a disorderly retreat from Saint-Amand-le-Haye.

===Napoleon commits the Old Guard===
Taking advantage of the Prussians&#x27; retreat, Napoleon decided it was time to launch a decisive counterstrike. He could at least beat Blücher and render the Prussians unfit for any serious operation except retreat on 17 June, although he could no longer expect to destroy the Prussian army. Lobau&#x27;s VI Corps, too, was now arriving and forming up on the heights east of Fleurus. The artillery of the Guard, therefore, came into action above Ligny to prepare Blücher&#x27;s centre for assault. Some delay was occasioned by a thunderstorm; but, as this passed over, the guns opened and the Old Guard, supported by the reserve cavalry – the &quot;Grenadiers à Cheval de la Garde Impériale&quot; – led by Guyot, as well as Milhaud&#x27;s IV Cavalry Corps proceeded to form up opposite Ligny. At about 19:45 a crashing salvo of 60 guns gave the signal for a combined assault to be delivered by Gerard and the Guard, with Milhaud&#x27;s cavalry moving on their right flank. Initially, the French Guard encountered heavy resistance, and was forced back momentarily by the Prussian reserves. However Blücher&#x27;s worn-out soldiers at that section of the line could not withstand the concentrated impact of Napoleon&#x27;s choicest troops, combined with a flanking movement by a division of French infantry under cover of the darkness, and at around 20:30 the Prussian centre at Ligny was overwhelmed.

The Prussians formed a new defensive line between Brye and Sombreffe, on the heights about behind Ligny. Units of the I Corps and II Corps retreated to this new position and rallied, fending off French attacks as they did so.

In the words of William Siborne:
===Blücher is incapacitated===
As a reaction to the Old Guard&#x27;s attack, Blücher instructed Lieutenant-General Röder to counter-attack with the two brigades of the reserve cavalry of the I Prussian Corps. While leading one of the charges in person, the 72-year-old Blücher&#x27;s horse was shot and fell upon him. He was rescued and borne in a semi-conscious condition from the field. While Blücher was being taken from the field the French cavalry beat off the Prussian cavalry counter-attack. Lieutenant-General August von Gneisenau (Blücher&#x27;s Chief of staff), took over command from the absent Blücher.

===Prussian retreat===
Sources differ over Gneisenau&#x27;s leadership while Blücher was incapacitated. Chesney credits him with the decision to retreat north in support of Wellington: &quot;Gneisenau, coming into temporary command after the fall of Blucher at the end of the battle, and finding the struggle for the present hopelessly decided, chose at all risk of inconvenience to abstain from the notion of a retreat to the east, and to keep as near as might be to the English army.&quot; [Chesney 1869, pp142–143]. Glover also writes &quot;A retreat on Gembloux by the entire army would be the obvious course of action, except that this would lead to a complete break of contact with Wellington. Gneisenau therefore initially ordered a retreat directly north on Tilly, which would maintain that contact&quot;. However, Parkinson, citing Prussian records, claims Gneisenau &quot;raged&quot; over the lack of British support at Ligny and decided to retreat east after Tilly: &quot;And slowly, fatefully, Gneisenau&#x27;s choice of retreat route swung towards Liege - abandoning Wellington to face Napoleon alone, outnumbered.&quot; [pp. 228–9] Blücher later summoned his British liaison officer, Sir Harry Hardinge, to inform him: &quot;Gneisenau has given in. We are going to join the Duke.&quot; [Parkinson p. 232]. &quot;This decision by Blücher is unquestionably worthy of the highest praise. Ignoring all the false courses of action that traditional practices and misplaced prudence might have suggested in such a case, he followed his common sense and decided to turn toward Wellington on the 18th, preferring to abandon his own line of communications rather than adopt half-measures. The battle he had lost had not been a rout. It had reduced the size of his force by only about one-sixth, and with nearly 100,000 men he could undoubtedly turn the battle that the Duke of Wellington was confronting into a victory&quot;. It is noteworthy that when Blücher was found alive, he refused to consider resigning his command on account of his injuries, declaring he would rather have himself &quot;tied to a horse than resign&quot;. [Parkinson p. 229].

At about 22:00 the order to fall back was given. On the Prussian right, Lieutenant-General Zieten&#x27;s I Corps retreated slowly with most of its artillery, leaving a rear-guard close to Brye to slow any French pursuit. Pirch I&#x27;s II Corps followed the I Corps off the battlefield. They formed up again within a quarter of a league of the field of battle (about 3/4 of a mile), and retired to Wavre via Tilly, free of French pursuit. &quot;Our infantry, posted behind Ligny, though forced to retreat, did not suffer itself to be discouraged … Formed in masses, it coolly repulsed all the attacks of the cavalry, and retreated in good order upon the height, whence it continued its retrograde movement upon Tilly. … At the distance of a quarter of a league from the field of battle, the army formed again. The enemy did not venture to pursue it. The village of Brie remained in our possession during the night, as well as Sombref, where General Thielemann had fought with the 3rd Corps&quot;. &quot;At 10 o’clock the order to fall back was given, and the centre and right retrograded in perfect order. Forming again within a quarter of a league of the field of battle, they recommenced their retreat; and, unmolested by the enemy, retired upon Wavre&quot;.

On the left, Lieutenant-General Thielemann&#x27;s largely-unharmed III Corps withdrew last with the army&#x27;s various parks in tow, toward Gembloux where Bulow waited with the newly arrived IV Corps. He left a strong rear-guard at Sombreffe. &quot;[Gneisenau], having undertaken the direction of affairs, ordered the retreat of the First and II Corps upon Tilly, and despatched Colonel Thile with directions to Thielemann, that if he could not effect a direct retreat upon Tilly, he was to retire upon Gembloux, there to unite with Bulow, and then effect a junction with the rest of the army&quot;.

The village of Brye remained in Prussian possession (I Corps) during the night, as well as Sombref, where the III Corps had held Grouchy all day. The bulk of the rear-guards held their positions until about midnight. The final units of Zieten&#x27;s I Corps rear-guard only left the battlefield at daybreak on 17 June, as the exhausted French failed to press on. The last of III Corps was moved in the morning of 17 June completely ignored.

Von Bülow&#x27;s IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny, moved to a location south of Wavre and set up a strong position on which the other elements of the Prussian army could reassemble. Blücher was already in communication with Wellington. &quot;The Field Marshall promised to come with his whole army; he even proposed, in case Napoleon should not attack, that the Allies themselves, with their whole united force, should attack him the next day. This may serve to show how little the battle of the 16th had disorganised the Prussian army, or weakened its moral strength&quot;.

8,000 troops fled to Liege and Aix-la-Chapelle. These were mainly new draftees from the Rhenish and Westphalian provinces, and the Duchy of Berg. Some of the Rhine provinces had previously been a part of France, and their contingents included old French soldiers.

==Aftermath==
The retreat of the Prussians was not interrupted, and was seemingly unnoticed, by the French. Crucially, they retreated not to the east, along their lines of communication and away from Wellington, but northwards, parallel to Wellington&#x27;s line of march and still within supporting distance, and remained throughout in communication with Wellington. They regrouped south of Wavre, around march to the east of Waterloo, from whence they proceeded to Waterloo on 18 June.

Wellington anticipated that Napoleon would then come against him at Quatre Bras, so he spent 17 June retreating northwards to a defensive position he had personally reconnoitred the previous year at Mont-Saint-Jean, a low ridge south of the village of Waterloo and the Forest of Soignes. Napoleon, with the reserve and the right wing of the Army of the North, made a late start on 17 June and joined Ney at Quatre Bras at 13:00 to attack Wellington&#x27;s army, but found only the rearguard of cavalry remaining on the site. The French pursued Wellington to Waterloo but managed only to defeat a small cavalry rearguard in an action at Genappe before torrential rain set in for the night. By the end of 17 June, Wellington&#x27;s army had arrived at its position at Waterloo, with the main body of Napoleon&#x27;s army following. The decisive battle of the campaign took place at Waterloo on 18 June 1815.

Before leaving Ligny, Napoleon gave Grouchy 33,000 men and orders to follow the retreating Prussians. A late start, uncertainty about the direction the Prussians had taken, and the vagueness of the orders given to Grouchy meant that he was too late to prevent the Prussian army reaching Wavre, from where Blücher could march to support Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo and Thielmann fought the Battle of Wavre. After the French defeat at Waterloo, only Grouchy managed to retreat in good order to France with his force of nearly 30,000 organised French soldiers with their artillery. However, this army was not strong enough to resist the combined coalition forces. Napoleon announced his abdication on 24 June 1815 and finally surrendered on 15 July.

<text>The Battle of Rocroi, fought on 19 May 1643, was a major engagement of the Thirty Years&#x27; War between a French army, led by the 21-year-old Duke of Enghien (later known as the Great Condé) and Spanish forces under General Francisco de Melo only five days after the accession of Louis XIV to the throne of France after his father&#x27;s death. Rocroi shattered the myth of invincibility of the Spanish Tercios, the terrifying infantry units that had dominated European battlefields for the previous 120 years. The battle is therefore often considered to mark the end of Spanish military greatness and the beginning of French hegemony in Europe during the 17th century. After Rocroi, the Spanish progressively transformed the tercio system incorporating more of the line infantry doctrine used by the French over time.

==Context ==
Since 1618, the Thirty Years&#x27; War had raged in Germany, with the Catholic Austrian and Spanish Habsburgs fighting the Protestant states. In 1635, fearing a peace too favorable to the House of Habsburg after a string of Protestant defeats, France decided to intervene directly and declared war on the Habsburgs and Spain, despite France being a Catholic power that had suppressed its own Protestant rebellions. An initial invasion of the Spanish Netherlands ended in failure, and the French retreated to their borders.

December 1642 brought the death of Cardinal Richelieu, the chief minister to Louis XIII of France, followed by the King&#x27;s own death on 14 May 1643, when his four-year-old son Louis XIV inherited the throne. Despite receiving overtures of peace amid the precarious domestic situation, the new French chief minister, Mazarin, did not wish to end the war and exerted French military pressure on Franche-Comté, Catalonia, and the Spanish Netherlands.

The Battle of Honnecourt in May 1642 had opened the way towards Paris, and the renowned Spanish Army of Flanders advanced through the Ardennes into northern France with 27,000 men in the hope of relieving pressure on Catalonia and in Franche-Comté.

==Prelude==
En route, the Spanish troops, under Francisco de Melo, laid siege to the fortified town of Rocroi. The Duc d&#x27;Enghien, the commander of a French army in Amiens, was appointed to stop the Spanish incursion. He was 21 but had already proven himself a bold and cunning commander, and he had the support of worthy subordinates, such as Marshal Jean de Gassion. French forces in the area numbered 23,000. Enghien advanced to meet de Melo&#x27;s numerically superior army along the Meuse River. On 17 May, he learned the king had died but kept the news secret from his army.

Word reached Enghien that 6,000 Spanish reinforcements were on their way to Rocroi, and he hurried there on 18 May. He decided on an attack before de Melo&#x27;s forces could be reinforced against the advice of his older subordinate commanders. He ordered his army forward through the only available approach, a defile between woods and marshes that the Spanish had failed to block. That afternoon, the French took up position on a ridge overlooking Rocroi.

Learning of the French advance, de Melo decided to engage the oncoming forces, rather than invest in the siege, as he deemed his army stronger. Accordingly, the Spanish army formed up between the French and Rocroi, and both sides prepared for battle the next day. The Spanish expected a decisive victory, which would compel the French to negotiate peace.

The French army was arranged in two lines of infantry in the center, squadrons of cavalry on each wing, and a thin line of artillery at the front. The Spanish army was similarly positioned but with the center infantry in their traditional &quot;tercio&quot; squares, with some 8,000 highly trained Spanish in front and mercenary infantry behind them. The two armies exchanged fire in the afternoon of 18 May, but the full battle did not occur until the following day.

==Battle==
The battle began early in the morning of 19 May on open farmland in front of Rocroi with a French cavalry attack on the Spanish left. The French horsemen on the right under Jean de Gassion pushed back the Spanish cavalry opposite, and Enghien followed up by swiftly charging the exposed Spanish left flank. The Spanish horsemen were routed, and Enghien moved against the elite Spanish infantrymen, which had engaged their French counterparts and were besting them. At the same time, the French cavalry on the left, against Enghien&#x27;s orders, attacked the Spanish right and were repulsed. The Spanish mounted a counter-attack, initially very successful, but their advance was eventually halted by French reserves. At this point, the French left and center were in distress.

The battle was still inconclusive, with both armies succeeding on their right but bloodied on their left.

===Enghien&#x27;s illumination===

Enghien, aware that his left and center were bending under pressure, decided not to pull them back, but to exploit his momentum on the right flank. He ordered a cavalry encirclement, which was achieved via a sweeping strike and got behind the Spanish lines. He then smashed through the back of the Spanish infantry in the center and went on to crash into the rear of the Spanish right-flank cavalry that had engaged his reserves. The move was a complete success, and when the Spanish cavalry scattered, it left the infantry isolated, prompting the Spanish artillery crew to flee the battlefield. Regarded as the finest in Europe for over a century, the Spanish infantry, now enveloped on all sides, held its formations and repulsed two French cavalry attacks. Enghien massed his artillery alongside the captured Spanish guns, and relentlessly hammered the Spanish squares. The Germans and Walloons deserted, overwhelmed and broken, but the veteran Spanish Tercios remained on the field with their commander.

===Concluding battle===
Despite heavy artillery fire and the death of their commander de Fontaines, the Spanish absorbed additional French cavalry attacks without breaking formation. Impressed with their gallantry in combat, Enghien offered surrender terms similar to those obtained by a besieged garrison in a fortress, and the Spanish accepted. When Enghien personally rode forward to take their surrender, however, some of the Spanish apparently believed that this was the beginning of a French cavalry charge and opened fire on him. Angered by this seeming treachery, the French attacked again, this time without quarter and with devastating result. The Spanish army was virtually destroyed. Some Spanish sources state that only three of the five Spanish infantry battalions were destroyed by the French, while the remaining two were allowed to leave the field with deployed flags and weapons.

French losses were about 4,000. The Spanish commander Melo reported his losses at 6,000 casualties and 4,000 captured in his report to Madrid two days after the battle. The estimates for the Spanish army&#x27;s dead range from 4,000 to 8,000. Of the 7,000 Spanish infantry, only 390 officers and 1,386 enlisted men were able to escape back to the Spanish Netherlands. Guthrie lists 3,400 killed and 2,000 captured for the five Spanish infantry battalions alone, while 1,600 escaped. Most of the casualties were suffered by the Spanish infantry, while the cavalry and artillerymen were able to withdraw, albeit with the loss of all the cannons.

==Aftermath and significance==
The French lifted the Siege of Rocroi but were not strong enough to move the fight into Spanish Flanders. The Spanish regrouped rapidly and stabilized their positions. The year 1643 ended in a stalemate, which was enough of a success for France.

However, the battle was of great symbolic importance because of the high reputation of the Army of Flanders. Melo in his report to the King called it &quot;the most considerable defeat there has ever been in these provinces&quot;.

The proof of strength was important for France. At home, it was seen as a good omen for the new king&#x27;s reign, and it secured the power of Anne of Austria as queen regent for the four-year-old Louis XIV, and of the newly appointed Prime Minister Mazarin. Both Richelieu and Louis XIII had distrusted Anne (a sister of Philip IV of Spain), but as regent, she confirmed Mazarin, Richelieu&#x27;s protégé and political heir, and the French war policy maintained its direction.

The battle established the reputation of the 21-year-old Enghien, whose numerous victories would win him the name &quot;the Great Condé&quot;.

Abroad, it showed that France remained strong despite its four-year-old king. The following decades would see military hegemony in Continental Europe move slowly from Spain to France, as the absolute monarchy in France overpowered the Spanish imperial power. Mazarin had maneuvered to have space to cope with the Fronde and to turn the tide slowly against the Spanish in France and in the Low Countries. Turning to alliance with England, he defeated the Spanish at the Battle of the Dunes and took Dunkirk in 1658, leading to the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659. Although Spain looked to be all-powerful as late as 1652, the peace settlement reflected the demise of Spain&#x27;s mastery of Europe in the late 1650s.

==In media==
A 2006 Spanish movie, &quot;Alatriste&quot;, directed by Agustín Díaz Yanes, portrays this battle in its final scene. The soundtrack features in the scene a funeral march, &quot;La Madrugá&quot;, composed by Colonel Abel Moreno for the Holy Week of Seville, played by the band of the Infantry Regiment &quot;Soria&quot; No. 9, the successor of the &quot;bloody Tercio&quot;, which participated in the battle, the oldest unit in the Spanish Army.

==Museum==
The elderly Spanish infantry general Paul-Bernard de Fontaines, from the Spanish Netherlands and known to the Spanish as de Fuentes, suffered from gout and was carried into battle and killed. His sedan chair was taken as a trophy by the French and may be seen in the museum of Les Invalides in Paris. Enghien is reported to have said, &quot;Had I not won the day, I wish I had died like him&quot;.

<doc id="157127" wikidata="Q7864163" url="?curid=157127" title="UC Davis School of Law">
<text>The University of California, Davis School of Law is the professional graduate law school of the University of California, Davis. The school received ABA approval in 1968. It joined the Association of American Law Schools (AALS) in 1968.

UC Davis School of Law is the smallest of the five law schools in the University of California system, with a total enrollment of around 600 students. The school is located in a building named for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and commonly referred to as King Hall.

==History==

During the late 1940s, the rapid expansion of what is now known as the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco (then known as Hastings College of the Law) partially relieved some of the political pressure on UC Berkeley School of Law to compromise on its rigid standards for student admissions and faculty hiring. Berkeley was able to hold the line on its standards and thereby ascended to the top tier of American law schools by the 1990s.

To further protect Berkeley Law (then also known as Boalt Hall), the university appointed a committee in 1960 to prepare recommendations for the establishment of additional law schools in the UC system. The committee recommended that law schools should be established at Davis, San Diego, and Santa Barbara, but Davis was identified as the highest priority because of its proximity to the California State Capitol at Sacramento.

Formal planning for the law school at Davis began in 1962. The law faculty at Berkeley actively supported and worked on the development of the new law school at Davis because they knew it would relieve the pressure on themselves to ease up on admissions standards. It helped that one of their own, Edward L. Barrett, Jr., was appointed as Davis&#x27;s first dean in 1964. UC Davis School of Law opened in a temporary space in 1966 and moved to a permanent building in fall 1968. The first class of 69 students graduated in June 1969.

Apart from Barrett, no one else went from Berkeley to Davis. Barrett was exceedingly careful to not compete against Berkeley in hiring the first law professors at Davis. He knew Berkeley Law regarded Stanford Law School as its only equal within California, and was &quot;sensitive to the somewhat elitist stance of the Boalt Hall faculty and their skepticism that a first-rate law school could be built on an agricultural campus&quot;.

==Rankings and academics==

In 2016, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked UC Davis 30th among all law schools in the United States.

For diversity among the five law schools in the UC system, UC Davis was named the second-most diverse after UC Hastings by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. Princeton Review placed UC Davis Law tenth in the nation for faculty diversity in the 2009 version of its annual law ranking. It is listed as an &quot;A−&quot; in the March 2011 &quot;Diversity Honor Roll&quot; by &quot;The National Jurist: The Magazine for Law Students&quot;.

It is listed as an &quot;A&quot; (#16) in the January 2011 &quot;Best Public Interest Law Schools&quot; ratings by &quot;The National Jurist: The Magazine for Law Students&quot;.

UC Davis Law has the smallest student body of the UC law schools. It has a slightly higher student/faculty ratio than UCLA or Berkeley.

UC Davis has been ranked as the fifth most-expensive public law school in the nation by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. It is also ranked first for providing the most financial aid.
UC Davis grants the second-most in financial aid in the country. UC Davis Law&#x27;s King Hall Loan Repayment Assistance Program (LRAP), founded in 1990 to help alumni working in relatively low-income public-service law careers to repay student loans, was the first loan repayment assistance program established at any UC law school.

According to Brian Leiter&#x27;s Law School rankings, Davis ranks 23rd in the nation for scholarly impact as measured by total academic citations of tenure-stream faculty.

On November 28, 2022, UC Davis Law withdrew from U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings and will no longer provide data to contribute to those rankings.

===Bar passage rates===
Based on a 2001-2007 6 year average, 79.4% of UC Davis Law graduates passed the California State Bar exam. In 2009, 89% of first-time test takers passed the California bar.

For July 2012, 78.9% of first-time test takers passed the California bar exam. For July 2013, 85.0% of first-time test takers passed the California Bar Exam.

For July 2014, 86% of first-time test takers passed the California bar exam.

== Employment ==
According to King Hall&#x27;s official 2019 ABA-required disclosures, 85% of the Class of 2019 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation. King Hall&#x27;s Law School Transparency under-employment score is 6.5%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2019 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation.

==Costs==
The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at King Hall for the 2024-2025 academic year is $83,011 for California residents and $95,256 for non-residents.

==California International Law Center==
The California International Law Center is a research center at the Davis School of Law (Martin Luther King, Jr. Hall) that focuses on international, comparative, and transnational law. It works to promote scholarship, curricular and career development, and partnerships with organizations such as the American Society of International Law and the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights. It was founded in 2009. CILC&#x27;s co-directors are Associate Dean Beth Greenwood and Martin Luther King Jr. Professor of Law Afra Afsharipour. The acronym &quot;CILC&quot; is pronounced as &quot;silk.&quot; CILC sponsors the Asylum and Refugee Law National Moot Court Competition.

===Darfur Project===
CILC has partnered with the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights for special project focused on the crisis in Darfur. RFK&#x27;s 2007 Human Rights Laureate Dr. Mohammed Ahmed Abdallah, academic faculty from throughout California, and CILC&#x27;s fellow, students, and alumni will participate in creating a report of past reconciliation efforts.

===Global Council===
CILC&#x27;s Global Council consists of leaders in international legal and policy advocacy. Current members of the council include Prof. Clayborne Carson, Prof. Mireille Delmas-Marty, Prof. William A. Schabas, former ambassador Derek Shearer, and Judge Patricia M. Wald.

==Expansion==
The law school completed a $30 million expansion project in 2011. The project has added an additional wing to the law school&#x27;s current building, increasing assignable space by nearly 30 percent to provide for additional classrooms, offices, and a new courtroom, named the Paul and Lydia Kalmanovitz Appellate Courtroom in honor of a $1 million gift to the project from the Kalmanovitz Charitable Foundation. The courtroom is used by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, California Supreme Court, and California Court of Appeal.

<text>The Second Battle of the Marne (; 15 – 18 July 1918) was the last major German offensive on the Western Front during the First World War. The attack failed when an Allied counterattack, led by French forces and supported by several hundreds of Renault FT tanks, overwhelmed the Germans on their right flank, inflicting severe casualties. The German defeat marked the start of the relentless Allied advance which culminated in an armistice with Germany about 100 days later.

==Background==
Following the failure of the German spring offensive to end the conflict, Erich Ludendorff, Chief Quartermaster General, believed that an attack through Flanders would give Germany a decisive victory over the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). To shield his intentions and draw Allied troops away from Belgium, Ludendorff planned for a large diversionary attack along the Marne.

==German attack==

The battle began on 15 July, when 23 German divisions of the First and Third armies – led by Bruno von Mudra and Karl von Einem – assaulted the French Fourth Army under Henri Gouraud east of Reims (the Fourth Battle of Champagne (). The U.S. 42nd Division was attached to the French Fourth Army. Meanwhile, 17 divisions of the German Seventh Army, under Max von Boehn, aided by the Ninth Army under Johannes von Eben, attacked the French Sixth Army led by Jean Degoutte to the west of Reims (the Battle of the Mountain of Reims ()). Ludendorff hoped to split the French in two.

East of Reims, the French Fourth Army had prepared a defense in depth to counter an intense bombardment and infiltrating infantry. Their main line of resistance was four to five km behind the front, beyond the range of the enemy field guns, it was a continuous trench line – to prevent infiltration – dug on a reverse slope so it could not be overlooked by enemy artillery observers on the ground. Between the front and the main line of resistance were two lines of strong points, again mostly on reverse slopes. The French gun line behind the front was lightly manned, but the remaining guns fired frequently, so the Germans did not detect its weakness from rate of firing, although aerial observers did spot a concentration of field guns behind the main line of resistance. German offensive tactics stressed surprise, but French intelligence based on aerial observation gave clear warning and they learned the hour for the attack from twenty-seven prisoners taken in a trench raid.

The German bombardment was scheduled for 12:10. The French opened fire on the German assault trenches at 11:30, naturally shaking the confidence of attackers. When the Germans opened fire they pounded the almost empty French front line and their counter-battery fire struck many vacated gun pits. The attackers moved easily through the French front and then were led onward by a rolling barrage, which soon was well ahead of the infantry because they were held up by the points of resistance. When they encountered the French mainline they were ordered to rest, regroup and wait until their field guns were moved into range. They attacked the main line at 08:30 the following morning, an hour after they had originally scheduled to attack. They were stopped by accurate fire by the bulk of the French artillery. They tried again at noon, but failed. A French counter-attack gained little ground, but convinced the German commanders that they could not prevail. The Fourth Army was now able to send reinforcements to their neighbors to the west who had not fared as well.

In the west on the opening day of the offensive the defenders of the south bank of the Marne had to hold the river bank by enduring an intense three hour bombardment, including many gas shells. Under this cover stormtroopers swarmed across the river in every sort of transport – including 30-man canvas boats and rafts. They began to erect skeleton bridges at 12 points under fire from the Allied survivors. Some Allied units, particularly Colonel Ulysses G. McAlexander&#x27;s 38th Infantry Regiment of the American 3rd Infantry Division, the &quot;Rock of the Marne&quot;, held fast or even counterattacked, but by evening, the Germans had captured a bridgehead on either side of Dormans deep and wide, despite the aerial intervention of 225 French bombers, dropping of bombs on the makeshift bridges. Ludendorff regarded their advance as &quot;the very pinnacle of military victory&quot;.

The French were reinforced by the British XXII Corps and 85,000 American troops and the German advance stalled on 17 July 1918.

==Allied counter-offensive==

The German failure to break through, or to destroy the Allied armies in the field, allowed Ferdinand Foch, the Allied Supreme Commander, to proceed with the planned major counteroffensive on 18 July; 24 French divisions, including the American 92nd and 93rd Infantry Divisions under French command, joined by other Allied troops, including eight large American divisions under American command and 350 tanks attacked the recently formed German salient.

The Allied preparation was very important in countering the German offensive. It was believed that the Allies had the complete picture of the German offensive in terms of intentions and capabilities. The Allies knew the key points of the German plan down to the minute. There is a legend, possibly true, that engineer Cpt. Hunter Grant, along with the help of engagement coordinator and engineer Cpt. Page, devised a deceptive ruse. A briefcase with false plans for an American countererattack was handcuffed to a man who had died of pneumonia and placed in a vehicle which appeared to have run off the road at a German-controlled bridge. The Germans, on finding and being taken in by these plans, then adjusted their attack to thwart the false Allied plan. Consequently, the French and American forces led by Foch were able to conduct a different attack on exposed parts of the enemy lines, leaving the Germans with no choice but to retreat. This engagement marked the beginning of a German withdrawal that was never effectively reversed. In September nine American divisions (about 243,000 men) joined four French divisions to push the Germans from the St. Mihiel salient.

Earlier, in May, Foch had spotted flaws in the German offensives. The force that defeated the German offensive was mainly French, with American, British and Italian support. Co-ordinating this counter-attack would be a major problem as Foch had to work with &quot;four national commanders but without any real authority to issue order under his own name ... they would have to fight as a combined force and to overcome the major problems of different languages, cultures, doctrines and fighting styles.&quot; However, the presence of fresh American troops, unbroken by years of war, significantly bolstered Allied resistance to the German offensive. Floyd Gibbons wrote about the American troops, saying, &quot;I never saw men charge to their death with finer spirit.&quot;

On 19 July, the Italian Corps lost 9,334 officers and men out of a total fighting strength of about 24,000 during a German assault on their positions, successfully stopping the German advance. Henri Mathias Berthelot rushed two newly arrived British infantry divisions, the 51st (Highland) and 62nd (West Riding), alongside the Italians straight into attack down the Ardre Valley (the Battle of Tardenois () – named after the surrounding Tardenois plain).

The Germans ordered a retreat on 20 July and were forced back to the positions from which they had started their Spring Offensive. They strengthened their flank positions opposite the Allied pincers and on the 22nd, Ludendorff ordered to take up a line from the upper Ourcq to Marfaux.

Costly Allied assaults continued for minimal gains. By 27 July, the Germans had withdrawn their center behind Fère-en-Tardenois and had completed an alternative rail link. The Germans retained Soissons in the west.

On 1 August, French and British divisions of General Charles Mangin&#x27;s Tenth Army renewed the attack, advancing to a depth of nearly . The Allied counterattack petered out on 6 August in the face of German offensives. By this stage, the salient had been reduced and the Germans had been forced back to a line running along the Aisne and Vesle Rivers; the front had been shortened by .

== Assessment ==
The Second Battle of the Marne was an important victory. Ferdinand Foch received the baton of a Marshal of France. The Allies had taken 29,367 prisoners, 793 guns and 3,000 machine guns and inflicted 168,000 casualties on the Germans. The primary importance of the battle was its morale aspect – the strategic gains on the Marne marked the end of a string of German victories and the beginning of a series of Allied victories that would in three months end the war.

<text>Murder, Inc. (Murder, Incorporated) was an organized crime group active from 1929 to 1941 that acted as the enforcement arm of the National Crime Syndicatea closely connected criminal organization that included Italian-American Mafia, the Jewish Mob, and other criminal organizations in New York City and elsewhere. Murder, Inc. was composed of Jewish and Italian-American gangsters, and members were mainly recruited from poor and working-class Jewish and Italian neighborhoods in Manhattan and Brooklyn. It was initially headed by Louis &quot;Lepke&quot; Buchalter and later by Albert &quot;Mad Hatter&quot; Anastasia.

Murder, Inc. was believed to be responsible for between 400 and 1,000 contract killings, until the group was exposed in 1941 by former member Abe &quot;Kid Twist&quot; Reles. In the trials that followed, many members were convicted and executed, and Abe Reles himself died after suspiciously falling from a window. Thomas E. Dewey first came to prominence as a prosecutor of Murder, Inc. and other organized crime cases, before being elected to become the 47th governor of New York.

== Origins ==
The Bugs and Meyer Mob was the predecessor to Murder, Incorporated. The gang was founded by New York Jewish mobsters Meyer Lansky and Bugsy Siegel in the early 1920s. Sicilian mafioso Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano created The Commission and began to closely cooperate with his friend Lansky and the Jewish Mob in general, establishing a multi-ethnic alliance that eventually was deemed the &quot;National Crime Syndicate&quot;. Soon after, Siegel and Lansky disbanded the Bugs and Meyer gang and helped form Murder, Incorporated.

==Methods==
Members of Murder, Inc. were Italian and Jewish gangsters from the gangs of the Lower East Side and the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Brownsville, East New York, and Ocean Hill. They committed crimes in New York City, acting as enforcers for New York Jewish mobster Louis &quot;Lepke&quot; Buchalter, and they accepted murder contracts from mob bosses all around the United States.

Murder, Inc. was based in Rosie Gold&#x27;s candy store at the corner of Saratoga and Livonia Ave in Brooklyn. The group had a number of members, although Harry Strauss was the most prolific killer, committing over 100 murders—and some historians put the number as high as 500.

The killers were paid a regular salary as retainer as well as an average fee of $1,000 to $5,000 per killing. Their families also received monetary benefits.

==Founding and early activities==
Murder, Inc. was established after the formation of the commission of the National Crime Syndicate, to which it ultimately answered. It was largely headed by mob boss Louis &quot;Lepke&quot; Buchalter and Mangano Family underboss Albert Anastasia, but also had members from Buchalter&#x27;s labor-slugging gang (in partnership with Tommy &quot;Three-Fingered Brown&quot; Lucchese) as well as from another group of enforcers from Brownsville, Brooklyn, New York led by Martin &quot;Buggsy&quot; Goldstein and Abe &quot;Kid Twist&quot; Reles. Buchalter, in particular, and Joe Adonis occasionally, gave the outfit its orders from the board of directors of the syndicate. Albert &quot;The Mad Hatter&quot; Anastasia was the troupe&#x27;s operating head, or &quot;Lord High Executioner&quot;, assisted by Lepke&#x27;s longtime associate Jacob &quot;Gurrah&quot; Shapiro.

In 1932, Abe Wagner informed on the crime syndicate to the police. He fled to Saint Paul, Minnesota, and adopted a disguise to evade possible pursuit. Two killers, George Young and Joseph Schafer, found and shot him but were later apprehended. Bugsy Siegel failed to get them released.

In the 1930s, Buchalter used Murder, Inc. to murder witnesses and suspected informants when he was being investigated by crusading prosecutor Thomas Dewey. In one case on May 25, 1937, four killers garroted George Rudnick with a sash cord and stabbed him multiple times with an ice pick on the mere suspicion he was an informant. On October 1, 1937, they shot and seriously wounded Buchalter&#x27;s ex-associate Max Rubin. Rubin had disobeyed Buchalter&#x27;s orders to leave town and &quot;disappear&quot; in order to avoid being summoned as a witness against Buchalter. Three alleged victims of Murder, Inc. in 1935 were Morris Kessler and brothers Louis and Joseph Amberg.

===Murder of Dutch Schultz===
Murder, Inc’s best known victim was most likely Dutch Schultz, who had openly defied the syndicate. In October 1935, Schultz insisted on putting a contract on Thomas E. Dewey, who was leading an all-out effort to put the mob out of business, but the syndicate board overruled him. They feared that Dewey&#x27;s assassination would incite public outrage and result in an even greater campaign to shut down the rackets. Schultz vowed that he would ignore the board&#x27;s decision and kill Dewey himself.

Hitmen Mendy Weiss and Charles Workman were given the assignment to kill Schultz. On October 24, 1935, they tracked down Schultz and his associates Otto Berman, Abe Landau, and Lulu Rosenkrantz and shot them at the Palace Chop House in Newark, New Jersey. Berman, Landau, and Rosenkrantz died almost immediately, while Schultz clung to life until the following day. Workman stayed behind while Weiss escaped with their driver Seymour Schechter. In 1944, Weiss was executed by electric chair for another murder. Workman was eventually tried by the State of New Jersey for the Schultz murder and served 23 years in prison.

==Demise==

In January 1940, professional criminal and police informer Harry Rudolph was held as a material witness in the murder of 19-year-old minor gangster Alex Alpert. Alpert was shot in the back on a street corner in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn on November 25, 1933. While in custody, Rudolph talked with Brooklyn District Attorney William O&#x27;Dwyer. With Rudolph&#x27;s testimony, O&#x27;Dwyer secured first-degree murder indictments against Abe Reles, Martin Goldstein and Anthony Maffetore.

After the three were indicted, O&#x27;Dwyer learned from Special Prosecutor John Harlan Amen that Rudolph was reportedly offered a $5,000 bribe by another prisoner, on behalf of the syndicate, to &quot;put Reles and Goldstein on the street&quot;. O&#x27;Dwyer stated that when Maffetore learned of the bribe offer to help clear Reles and Goldstein and after several talks with New York City Detective John Osnato, he decided to turn state&#x27;s evidence. Detective Osnato talked with Maffetore even though he had worked with Rudolph previously and did not put much credibility in his story since Rudolph was paid for information in other cases that turned out to be false.

Eventually, Maffetore decided to cooperate, stating that he was not involved in the Alpert murder, but was the driver in six gangland murders. Maffetore then convinced Abraham Levine to talk. Reles was next to cooperate with the District Attorney&#x27;s office. After Reles agreed to cooperate, numerous first-degree murder indictments were issued in Brooklyn, the Bronx, and in upstate Sullivan County (Catskills). Additional members of the &quot;Combination&quot; then were added to the list of cooperating witnesses, including Albert Tannenbaum, Seymour Magoon, and Sholem Bernstein. Harry Rudolph&#x27;s testimony was never used in any of the trials, as he died of natural causes in the infirmary at Rikers Island in June 1940. Abe Reles fell to his death from a room at the Half Moon Hotel in Coney Island on November 12, 1941, even though he was under police guard. The official verdict was accidental death.

== Trials ==

=== Harry Maione and Frank Abbandando ===

Harry Maione and Frank Abbandando were the first members of the Brooklyn &quot;Combination&quot; to be put on trial for murder. In May 1940, the trial started for the May 25, 1937 ice-pick murder of George &quot;Whitey&quot; Rudnick in a Brooklyn parking garage. Harry Strauss was also indicted for the murder, and, after initially agreeing to cooperate with the District Attorney&#x27;s office, he was severed from the trial. On May 15, 1940, Abe Reles testified that Rudnick was marked for death after Strauss claimed he had obtained information that Rudnick was a &quot;stool pigeon for the police.&quot; Reles also testified that he waited outside the garage while Maione, Abbandando and Strauss were inside with Rudnick. After Rudnick was believed to have been murdered, Abbandando called for Reles and summoned Angelo &quot;Julie&quot; Catalano to the garage to assist with moving the body. Since Rudnick was still alive, Strauss resumed his assault with an ice pick, and Maione used a meat cleaver to complete the murder. The next day, Catalano, who drove the automobile with Rudnick&#x27;s body, corroborated Reles&#x27; account of the murder. &quot;Dukey&quot; Maffetore and Abe &quot;Pretty&quot; Levine testified that they stole the automobile that was used to dispose of the body. Maione and 14 witnesses testified that he was at his grandmother&#x27;s wake when Rudnick was murdered. The funeral home undertaker and embalmer testified that Maione was not at the wake. Also, one of Maione&#x27;s chief witnesses admitted that he committed perjury as ordered by Maione&#x27;s brother, whom he feared. 

On May 23, 1940, Maione and Abbandando were convicted of first-degree murder, which meant a mandatory sentence of death in the electric chair. New York&#x27;s highest court, the Court of Appeals, overturned the conviction on a 4–3 vote in December 1940. The second trial started on March 10, 1941. At one point during the trial, Maione lost his temper and threw a glass of water at Reles. Maione and Abbandando were convicted of first-degree murder for a second time on April 3, 1941. Maione and Abbandando were formally sentenced to death for a second time on April 14, 1941. The Court of Appeals upheld the second conviction on January 8, 1942. Maione and Abbandando were executed at Sing Sing prison on February 19, 1942.

=== Harry Strauss and Martin Goldstein ===

Harry Strauss and Martin Goldstein were put on trial for the September 4, 1939, strangulation murder of bookmaker Irving Feinstein, whose body was set on fire and left in a vacant lot after Feinstein had been strangled. The trial started in September 1940 with Strauss feigning insanity. Abe Reles, the chief prosecution witness, testified that Feinstein was murdered on orders of Albert Anastasia, since he supposedly &quot;crossed&quot; Vincent Mangano. Reles testified that he, Goldstein and Strauss murdered Feinstein in his house. Reles&#x27;s mother-in-law also testified that Reles and Strauss had asked her for an ice pick and clothesline earlier in the day and, while at the house, heard loud music masking a commotion in the living room. She also testified hearing Strauss say that he had been bitten. Goldstein&#x27;s former bodyguard/driver Seymour Magoon corroborated the story, as he testified that on the night of the murder, Goldstein told him that he along with Reles and Strauss had murdered Puggy Feinstein and that shortly after the crime was committed, Goldstein and &quot;Duke&quot; Maffetore burned the body. Goldstein&#x27;s attorney decided not to put up a defense. Strauss&#x27;s attorney claimed his client was insane. Strauss was briefly allowed on the witness stand but refused to take his oath and was &quot;babbling incoherently&quot; as he was led back to the defense table. Strauss then began chewing on a leather strap of a briefcase. On September 19, 1940, Strauss and Goldstein were convicted of first-degree murder and a week later sentenced to death in the electric chair. On April 24, 1941, Strauss and Goldstein&#x27;s convictions were affirmed by New York&#x27;s Court of Appeals on a 4–3 decision. Strauss and Goldstein were executed in the electric chair on June 12, 1941.

===Charles Workman===
Charles Workman was indicted in New Jersey on March 27, 1940, for the October 23, 1935, murder of Dutch Schultz and three members of his gang. Workman was extradited to New Jersey in April 1941. The trial, which opened in June 1941, featured testimony from Abe Reles and Albert Tannenbaum as the primary underworld witnesses against Workman. The trial opened with two state witnesses, the restaurant bartender and a woman who was outside the restaurant, failing to identify Workman. The next day, Reles and Tannenbaum provided their testimony implicating Workman. Next, a female friend of slain gangster Danny Fields, who was described as a &quot;collector for the payroll&quot; of Lepke, testified that Workman showed up at her apartment the day after Schultz&#x27;s murder and asked Fields to burn his clothes. The woman, who used a pseudonym on the witness stand, testified that Workman openly talked about the Schultz killing and how he was left behind in the restaurant. Workman&#x27;s defense opened with testimony from Marty Krompier, a close associate of Dutch Schultz who was shot in Manhattan the same night Schultz was murdered in New Jersey. Krompier testified that Tannenbaum told him that he did not shoot him as he was in New Jersey and killed Schultz. Workman, in the middle of his defense, changed his plea from &#x27;not guilty&#x27; to &#x27;no contest&#x27; after one of his chief defense witnesses, a Manhattan funeral director who testified that Workman was employed by him during the time of the Schultz murder and who was the brother-in-law of the late Lepke associate Danny Fields, recanted his testimony that had provided Workman with an alibi. The same day Workman changed his plea, he was sentenced to life in prison. Workman was paroled on March 10, 1964, after serving 23 years in prison.

=== Irving Nitzberg ===

Irving Nitzberg, who was &quot;imported&quot; by the Brooklyn &quot;Combination&quot; from the Bronx, was put on trial for the January 9, 1939, murder of Albert Shuman in Brooklyn based on the testimony of three accomplices, Abe Reles, Albert Tannenbaum and Seymour Magoon. Reles testified that Shuman was killed since he cooperated with the authorities who were conducting an inquiry of Lepke&#x27;s involvement in labor racketeering. Reles also testified that he helped plan the murder of Shuman with Lepke, who was a fugitive at the time, and Mendy Weiss and that Lepke received approval from Albert Anastasia to use a person who lived outside Brooklyn to help with completing the assignment. Seymour Magoon testified that he stole the car used in the murder on Reles&#x27;s orders. Albert Tannenbaum testified that he was the driver that picked up Nitzberg and Shuman under the pretense of performing a robbery. Nitzberg, who was in the back seat, shot Shuman twice in the back of the head when Tannenbaum gave a predetermined signal. Tannenbaum and Nitzberg then exited the murder car to join Reles and another gangster in the getaway car and departed from the crime scene. Nitzberg was convicted of first-degree murder on May 23, 1941, and sentenced to death in the electric chair. However, on December 10, 1941, the conviction was overturned on a 4–3 vote by New York&#x27;s Court of Appeals, which questioned the use of testimony of non-accomplice witnesses who were promised leniency to support the testimony of Reles, Tannenbaum and Magoon. Nitzberg was tried a second time in 1942 with the now-deceased Reles&#x27;s testimony read to the jury. Nitzberg was convicted for a second time on March 12, 1942. The conviction was overturned again by the Court of Appeals on a 4–3 vote, but, this time, the court also dismissed the indictment as faulty since the only testimony presented to the grand jury was from accomplices without corroboration.

=== Louis Buchalter, Emanuel Weiss, Louis Capone, Harry Strauss, James Feraco and Philip Cohen ===

Louis Buchalter, Emanuel Weiss, Louis Capone, Harry Strauss, James Feraco Cohen had his murder indictment dropped prior to the start of the trial after his conviction on a federal narcotics charge and received a 10-year sentence. James Feraco had vanished without a trace and was presumably killed in 1940 or 1941, and Harry Strauss had already been executed for the murder of Irving Feinstein. Jury selection for the trial began in August 1941. However, securing a jury for Lepke proved difficult. After enough jurors were finally selected, the trial actually started in October 1941. The trial featured the testimony of Rosen&#x27;s wife and son, a teacher, and underworld turncoat Sholem Bernstein, who was marked for death after refusing to carry out a murder contract on Irving Cohen, who fled to California after the murder of Walter Sage in 1937 in Swan Lake, New York. Lepke, Weiss and Capone were convicted on November 30, 1941. The Court of Appeals upheld the murder convictions of Lepke, Weiss and Capone in October 1942 on a 4–3 vote. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear Lepke&#x27;s appeal in February 1943. In March 1943, the Supreme Court reversed its earlier decision and granted a review to Lepke, Weiss and Capone. The Supreme Court upheld the conviction in June 1943. Before Lepke could be executed, New York State needed the federal government to turn Lepke over, as he was currently serving a 14-year sentence in federal prison. Lepke continued to appeal his death sentence vigorously in New York and transfer from federal custody. Lepke, Weiss and Capone were executed in Sing-Sing prison on March 4, 1944.

=== Vito Gurino ===
Vito &quot;Socko&quot; Gurino was sought for questioning in the Brooklyn murder investigation as the member assigned to eliminate witnesses against the &quot;Combination&quot;. First, Gurino attempted to silence a small-time gangster and eyewitness to the George Rudnick murder. Police picked up Angelo &quot;Julie&quot; Catalano on the streets of Brooklyn shortly after he was bailed out by the syndicate, as Gurino tried to convince him to &quot;hide out&quot; on Long Island. Several days later, Gurino used a contact, corrupt Queens County Deputy Sheriff William Cassele, to enter the county&#x27;s civil prison on the night of March 29, 1940. Cassele then forced Joseph &quot;Joe the Baker&quot; Liberto, who was being held as a material witness in the George Rudnick murder, to meet with Gurino. According to Liberto, he was pushed up against a wall in his cell and threatened with death if he cooperated with the District Attorney. Liberto was taken into custody shortly after an acquaintance drove him to a farmhouse on Long Island. Liberto quickly exited through a window, convinced he was going to be killed. Gurino, who was hiding out in New Jersey for much of 1940, was arrested on September 12, 1940, at the Church of the Guardian Angel in Manhattan, screaming hysterically in fear for his life. Shortly after being arrested, Gurino confessed to three syndicate murders and implicated himself in four others. In March 1942, Gurino pleaded guilty to three murders. In April 1942, Gurino was sentenced to 80 years to life in prison. He died of a heart ailment on April 22, 1957, at Dannemora Hospital for the Criminally Insane.

=== Jacob Drucker and Irving Cohen ===

Jacob Drucker and Irving Cohen were put on trial separately for the murder of racketeer Walter Sage in the Catskills. Sage was killed with an ice pick and had the frame of a slot machine and a 30 pound rock tied to his body. He floated to the surface and was found in Swan Lake, New York on July 31, 1937 by tourists. After the Sage murder, believing he was also going to be killed, Cohen fled to California and managed to secure small roles in films. He was identified two years later by the chief prosecution witness, Abraham Levine, who spotted Cohen in one of the ringside crowd scenes in the 1939 film &quot;Golden Boy&quot;. According to Levine, Sage was riding in a car with Cohen and Drucker when he was stabbed 32 times with an icepick as Levine and Harry Strauss were following in another car. During the assault and struggle, Drucker stabbed Cohen once in the arm as Sage had grabbed the steering wheel and wrecked the car. Levine also testified that he observed Drucker wiping the icepick clean before helping dispose of the body. Cohen testified in his own defense, stating that Levine had stabbed him with an icepick as he was walking home from a casino. Cohen stated that he was assaulted by Levine and another man on Drucker&#x27;s orders since he refused to pay 25% profit on a game of chance that he operated. Cohen was acquitted on June 21, 1940. Drucker, who was a suspect in four murders in the Catskills, was a fugitive for over three years, until the FBI located him in Delaware. Drucker was convicted of second-degree murder on May 5, 1944, and received a sentence of 25 years to life. Drucker died in Attica prison in January 1962.

=== Jack Parisi ===

Jack &quot;the Dandy&quot; Parisi was acquitted of two murders, Teamsters official Morris Diamond in Brooklyn and music-publishing executive Irving Penn in the Bronx. Penn was killed by mistaken identity, as the intended target, Philip Orlofsky, a Cutters Union official, left his home early to get a shave the day his killers waited for him. Parisi was a fugitive for 10 years, until he was captured in Pennsylvania in 1949. Albert Tannenbaum was brought in from Atlanta, where he was reportedly living, to testify for the prosecution. One accomplice in the Penn murder, Jacob &quot;Kuppy&quot; Migden, who provided the erroneous identification of Penn and who was also a fugitive for several years, pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree assault in the middle of his murder trial and was sentenced to a term of 5–10 years. Each of Parisi&#x27;s murder trials ended with an acquittal, as the judges directed a verdict of not-guilty due to the lack of corroborating evidence, since the chief witnesses for the prosecution were accomplices. He died at home of natural causes on December 27, 1982, at the age of 83.

=== Others ===

Max &quot;the Jerk&quot; Golob was indicted with Frank Abbandando for first-degree murder in the slaying of gangster John &quot;Spider&quot; Murtha on March 3, 1935. With little evidence other than the eyewitness testimony of Murtha&#x27;s female companion, Golob was permitted to plead guilty to second-degree assault and received a maximum term of five years.

Sidney &quot;Fats&quot; Brown was the subject of a sealed first-degree murder indictment in Sullivan County, New York. The indictment was dismissed after the death of Abe Reles, the sole witness. Brown was never arrested, and the identity of the murder victim was never revealed.

<text>In computing, multiple instruction, multiple data (MIMD) is a technique employed to achieve parallelism. Machines using MIMD have a number of processor cores that function asynchronously and independently. At any time, different processors may be executing different instructions on different pieces of data.

MIMD architectures may be used in a number of application areas such as computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing, simulation, modeling, and as communication switches. MIMD machines can be of either shared memory or distributed memory categories. These classifications are based on how MIMD processors access memory. Shared memory machines may be of the bus-based, extended, or hierarchical type. Distributed memory machines may have hypercube or mesh interconnection schemes.

==Examples==
An example of MIMD system is Intel Xeon Phi, descended from Larrabee microarchitecture. These processors have multiple processing cores (up to 61 as of 2015) that can execute different instructions on different data.

Most parallel computers, as of 2013, are MIMD systems.

==Shared memory model==
In shared memory model the processors are all connected to a &quot;globally available&quot; memory, via either software or hardware means. The operating system usually maintains its memory coherence.

From a programmer&#x27;s point of view, this memory model is better understood than the distributed memory model. Another advantage is that memory coherence is managed by the operating system and not the written program. Two known disadvantages are: scalability beyond thirty-two processors is difficult, and the shared memory model is less flexible than the distributed memory model.

There are many examples of shared memory (multiprocessors): UMA (uniform memory access), COMA (cache-only memory access).

===Bus-based===
MIMD machines with shared memory have processors which share a common, central memory. In the simplest form, all processors are attached to a bus which connects them to memory. This means that every machine with shared memory shares a specific CM, common bus system for all the clients.

For example, if we consider a bus with clients A, B, C connected on one side and P, Q, R connected on the opposite side,
any one of the clients will communicate with the other by means of the bus interface between them.

=== Hierarchical ===
MIMD machines with hierarchical shared memory use a hierarchy of buses (as, for example, in a &quot;fat tree&quot;) to give processors access to each other&#x27;s memory. Processors on different boards may communicate through inter-nodal buses. Buses support communication between boards. With this type of architecture, the machine may support over nine thousand processors.

== Distributed memory ==
In distributed memory MIMD (multiple instruction, multiple data) machines, each processor has its own individual memory location. Each processor has no direct knowledge about other processor&#x27;s memory. For data to be shared, it must be passed from one processor to another as a message. Since there is no shared memory, contention is not as great a problem with these machines. It is not economically feasible to connect a large number of processors directly to each other. A way to avoid this multitude of direct connections is to connect each processor to just a few others. This type of design can be inefficient because of the added time required to pass a message from one processor to another along the message path. The amount of time required for processors to perform simple message routing can be substantial. Systems were designed to reduce this time loss and hypercube and mesh are among two of the popular interconnection schemes.

Examples of distributed memory (multiple computers) include MPP (massively parallel processors), COW (clusters of workstations) and NUMA (non-uniform memory access). The former is complex and expensive: Many super-computers coupled by broad-band networks. Examples include hypercube and mesh interconnections. COW is the &quot;home-made&quot; version for a fraction of the price.

===Hypercube interconnection network===
In an MIMD distributed memory machine with a hypercube system interconnection network containing four processors, a processor and a memory module are placed at each vertex of a square. The diameter of the system is the minimum number of steps it takes for one processor to send a message to the processor that is the farthest away. So, for example, the diameter of a 2-cube is 2. In a hypercube system with eight processors and each processor and memory module being placed in the vertex of a cube, the diameter is 3. In general, a system that contains 2^N processors with each processor directly connected to N other processors, the diameter of the system is N. One disadvantage of a hypercube system is that it must be configured in powers of two, so a machine must be built that could potentially have many more processors than is really needed for the application.

===Mesh interconnection network===
In an MIMD distributed memory machine with a mesh interconnection network, processors are placed in a two-dimensional grid. Each processor is connected to its four immediate neighbors. Wrap around connections may be provided at the edges of the mesh. One advantage of the mesh interconnection network over the hypercube is that the mesh system need not be configured in powers of two. A disadvantage is that the diameter of the mesh network is greater than the hypercube for systems with more than four processors.

<text>(, ), Sanskrit, Pāli, and Tibetan for &quot;guardian of the world&quot;, has different uses depending on whether it is found in a Hindu or Buddhist context. In Hinduism, &quot;lokapāla&quot; refers to the Guardians of the Directions associated with the eight, nine and ten cardinal directions. In Buddhism, &quot;lokapāla&quot; refers to the Four Heavenly Kings, and to other protector spirits, whereas the Guardians of the Directions are referred to as &quot;dikpāla&quot;.

==In Hinduism==

In Hinduism, the guardians of the cardinal directions are called &quot;dikapāla&quot;. The four principal guardians are:

# Kubera (North)
# Yama (South)
# Indra (East)
#  (West)

==In Buddhism==
In Buddhism, &quot;lokapāla&quot; are one of two broad categories of &quot;dharmapāla&quot; (protectors of the Buddhist religion) -the other category being Wisdom Protectors. In China, &quot;each is additionally associated with a specific direction and the Four Heraldic Animals of Chinese astronomy/astrology, as well as playing a more secular role in rural communities ensuring favorable weather for crops and peace throughout the land...Easily identified by their armor and boots, each has his own magic weapon and associations.&quot; Their names are (east) Dhrtarastra, (west) Virupaksa, (north) Vaishravana, and (south) Virudhaka.

In Tibetan Buddhism, many of these worldly protector deities are indigenous Tibetan deities, mountain gods, demons, spirits or ghosts that have been subjugated by Padmasambhava or other great adepts and oath bound to protect a monastery, geographic region, particular tradition or as guardians of Buddhism in general. These worldly protectors are invoked and propitiated to aid the monastery or Buddhist practitioner materially and to remove obstacles to practice. However, since they are considered to be Samsaric beings, they are not worshiped or considered as objects of refuge.

According to Tripitaka Master Shramana Hsuan Hua of the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas, all of these beings are invoked (hooked and summoned) and exhorted to behave (subdued) and protect the Dharma and its practitioners in the Shurangama Mantra.

<text>Anagni () is an ancient town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Frosinone, Latium, in the hills east-southeast of Rome. It is a historical and artistic centre of the Latin Valley.

==Geography==
===Overview===

Anagni still maintains the appearance of a small medieval hill town (424 m above sea level), with small twisting streets and steep lanes. It is built inside Roman boundary walls.

== History ==
===Prehistory and ancient era===

The first human settlements date back to more than 700,000 years, according to the dating of some Palaeolithic hand-made fragments recently recovered. Several objects made of bone and flint stone and also two human molars and incisors belonging to fossil &quot;Homo erectus&quot; have been found in Fontana Ranuccio.

The first people known by name who lived in the area were the Hernici who migrated from the Aniene valley and descended from the Marsi (Marsians) (or from the Sabines), at least according to the ethnical term deriving from the Marsian &quot;herna&quot; (&quot;stone&quot;), that is: &quot;Those who live on the stony hills&quot;. Only two words remain of their language: &quot;Samentum&quot;, a strip of sacrificial skin, and &quot;Bututti&quot;, a sort of funeral lament.

Anagni was an important city and spiritual centre of the Hernici. The town was located on the acropolis (the north-east zone comprising the Cathedral, Tufoli gate, and Piazza Dante) and partially defended by walls in &quot;opus quasi-quadratum&quot; (almost squared work).

Recent archaeological discoveries have revealed cultural and economic relationships between the Hernici and the Etruscans around the 7th century BC.

===Roman Period===

In 307 BC, the Hernici, with the exception of Aletrium (Alatri), Verulae (Veroli), and Ferentinum (Ferentino) declared war on Rome. After suffering setbacks the Hernici offered unconditional surrender. In 306 BC the towns which had not joined the war remained independent, while “Anagnia and such others as had borne arms against the Romans were admitted to citizenship without the right to vote. They were prohibited from holding councils and from intermarrying, and were allowed no magistrates save those who had charge of religious rites.” Anagni preserved her religious autonomy and strategic importance.

Under Roman domination the town expanded and the so-called Servian walls were modified at the beginning of the 3rd century BC. 

In Imperial times, many emperors spent their summers in Anagni to escape the heat of Rome, the most notable ones being Marcus Aurelius, Septimius Severus, Commodus, and Caracalla. The large imperial villa in the vicinity at Villa Magna was owned by Marcus Aurelius.

The city was the seat of temples and sanctuaries including the temple of Ceres on which the Cathedral was built. In the 2nd century AD, many linen codices containing sacred Etruscan texts were still well-conserved, according to Emperor Marcus Aurelius. There is a sole survivor of these texts, the &quot;Liber Linteus&quot;.

By the end of the Roman Empire, a crisis caused a collapse of Anagni&#x27;s population; the lower parts of the city were abandoned.

===Middle Ages===

Anagni was a diocese, the seat of a bishop, since the 5th century. In the 9th century, the first Cathedral was built on the ruins of the temple dedicated to the Goddess Ceres. This cathedral, including a hospice, was rebuilt in the 11th century through the effort of bishop Peter of Anagni, who convinced the Byzantine Emperor Michael VII Doukas to provide funds and craftsmen. The agricultural reconquest, begun in the 10th century, was supported by the ecclesiastic power, which allowed the secular lords to exploit the land and to build fortified settlements for their peasants, favouring new economic and demographic growth. The boundary walls were subjected to rebuilding and restoration in the course of the first millennium AD; but the major re-arrangement took place in the 16th century.

During the 10th and the 11th centuries, the city strengthened its link with the papal court: In fact, the popes began to consider the old capital city of the Hernici a safer and healthier spot compared to Rome, which was the place of frequent epidemic diseases. For this reason, even if the presence of factions inside the town could not be prevented, Anagni remained faithful to the Roman Church, becoming one of the favourite residences of the popes, in the 12th and 13th centuries.

As a result, several events connected with the struggle between Papacy and Empire took place in the city, including some of the most important political events in these two centuries. In 1122, Callistus II promulgated the basic Bull of the Concordat of Worms; in 1159, Pope Adrian IV received in Anagni, during the siege of Crema, the legates of Milan, Brescia, and Piacenza (the building of the Civic Palace was assigned to the Ambassador of Brescia, Architect Jacopo da Iseo); Adrian died here later the same year. In 1160, Alexander III excommunicated the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in the Cathedral; in 1176, after the Battle of Legnano, the same pope received the imperial legates, with whom he elaborated the &quot;Pactum Anagninum &quot;(&quot;Anagni&#x27;s Agreement&quot;), premise to the peace, which was achieved in Venice in 1177.
The 13th century was the golden age of the city. In one hundred years, Anagni produced four popes, three of them members of the Conti family. The first one to ascend to the papal throne was Lotarius Conti, who, as Innocent III (1198–1216), was one of the outstanding personalities of his century, together with Frederick II of whom he favoured the coronation as Emperor of Germany and Saint Francis whose first Rule he approved. Innocent III is credited with the elaboration and the most complete expression of the theocratic doctrine, the principle according to which absolute rule over every earthly power is ascribed to the Pope. He died in 1216, leaving the Church at the historical peak of its power.

Innocent III&#x27;s efforts were taken up by Gregory IX, who belonged to the powerful Family of Conti di Anagni. On September 29, 1227 in Anagni&#x27;s Cathedral he excommunicated Emperor Frederick II, who had abandoned the Crusade that the Emperor himself had proclaimed. The suggestive ceremony took place by the lights of the torches, firstly shaken, then thrown on the ground and finally blown out by the prelates.

In September 1230, after the reconciliation, Gregory IX received Frederick II in Anagni, who in the meantime had been able to conquer, without bloodshed but by means of his great diplomatic ability, both Jerusalem and Nazareth.

During his pontificate, Alexander IV (1254–1261), Gregory IX&#x27;s relative and Anagni&#x27;s third pope, had to face the heated ecclesiological dispute raised by the University of Paris against the Mendicant Orders. The leader of this dispute, William of Saint-Amour, had published an anti-mendicant pamphlet, &quot;De periculis novissimorum temporum&quot; (&quot;On the Dangers of the Last Days&quot;) between the fall of 1255 and spring of 1256. Alexander officially condemned the work in Anagni on October 5, 1256. In 1255 Clare of Assisi was officially canonized in Anagni.

In 1265 a provincial Chapter at Anagni of the Roman province of the Dominican Order assigned Thomas Aquinas as regent master thereby transforming the existing &quot;studium conventuale&quot; at the Roman convent of Santa Sabina into the Order&#x27;s first &quot;studium provinciale&quot; featuring as an innovation the study of philosophy (&quot;studia philosophiae&quot;). This &quot;studium&quot; is the forerunner of the 16th century College of Saint Thomas at Santa Maria sopra Minerva, and the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot;

===Outrage of Anagni===
Anagni is connected to the events in the life of Boniface VIII, the fourth Pope to be born in the city, and a member of the powerful Caetani Family. He was elected after the abdication of Celestine V, but opposed by French Cardinals and by the powerful Colonna Family.

In 1300, Boniface VIII, set up the first Jubilee and founded the first Roman university, but also began a feud with the King of France, Philip the Fair, who had arrogated the right to tax the French clergy. In response, in 1302 Boniface delivered the Bull &quot;Unam Sanctam&quot;, which proclaimed absolute papal supremacy over the earthly power of kings. In anger, Philip organized an expedition to arrest and remove the pope.

In 1303, the king&#x27;s advisor Guillaume de Nogaret and Sciarra Colonna led a band of two thousand mercenaries on horse and foot. They joined locals in an attack on the palaces of the pope and his nephew at Anagni. The Pope&#x27;s attendants and his nephew Francesco all soon fled; only the Spaniard Pedro Rodríguez, Cardinal of Santa Sabina, remained at his side. The palace was plundered and Boniface was nearly killed (Nogaret prevented Sciarra Colonna from murdering the pope). Still, Boniface was held prisoner and starved of food and drink for three days. This incident is called the &quot;Outrage of Anagni&quot;. According to a legend, during the imprisonment, the Pope was slapped by Sciarra Colonna with his gauntlet, called the &quot;Schiaffo di Anagni&quot; (Slap of Anagni). The imprisonment of the Pope inspired Dante Alighieri in a famous passage of his Divine Comedy (Purgatory, XX, vv. 85-93), &quot;the new Pilate has imprisoned the Vicar of Christ&quot;.

The people of Anagni rose against the invaders and released Boniface. The pope pardoned those captured. He returned to Rome in 1303.
The old pontiff, already infirm, developed a violent fever and died in Rome on 11 October 1303.

After the death of Boniface VIII, both the splendor of Anagni and the dreams of power of the Caetani Family collapsed and the doctrine of ultimate papal suzerainty was weakened.

The transfer of the papal court to Avignon marked for Anagni the beginning of a long decline lasting through the entire 15th century. The town was sacked by the troops of Duke Werner von Urslingen in 1348, and depopulated.

===Later History===

In 1556, Anagni became a battlefield in the conflict between Pope Paul IV and King Philip II of Spain, when it was besieged by the Spanish army under the Duke of Alba. After a bombardment by the Spanish, the papal troops abandoned their positions and the Spanish put the town to the sack on 15 September.

The damage suffered by the town, in particular by the town walls, were accentuated by the fortifying works carried out in 1564 under Pope Pius IV. Around 1579 a short period of reflourishing began, thanks to Cardinal Benedetto Lomellino, bishop and governor of the city.

The great architectonic and urbanistic reconstructions began around 1633. The ancient noble mansions embellished by magnificent portals were restructured and, toward the end of the 19th century, also the cultural level of the city rose again, thanks to the growing welfare. Other institutions and congregations were born, which, together with the constitution of various schools, made Anagni an important centre of study thanks to its long cultural tradition.

In 1890, in the presence of the Queen, the Queen Margaret&#x27;s National Boarding-house for the education of the orphan-girls of grammar school teachers was opened.

In 1897, the Jesuit Collegio Leoniano, entitled to the pontiff Leo XIII, was also opened. Finally, in 1930, the Prince of Piedmont&#x27;s Boarding-house was built for the sons of local body personnel.

Since World War II, the territory of Anagni has become an important industrial settlement.

Anagni was also the summer residence of the popes until recently. It was similar to what Castel Gandolfo in the Alban Hills is to today&#x27;s popes.

==Main sights==

=== Anagni Cathedral ===

The Cathedral, dedicated to Saint Mary, was built in Romanesque style during the years 1071–1105, with Gothic-style additions in the mid-13th century. The crypt contains the tombs of St Magnus of Anagni, the patron of the city, and of St Secundina of Anagni. The frescoes covering all the walls and ceiling are among the best preserved examples of Romanesque/Byzantine art in Italy, and form a single iconographic scheme, which includes natural philosophy, saints, the Apocalypse, and the Old Testament Ark of the Covenant. The unrestored Cosmati floor is in excellent condition.

On the same level as the crypt is the Oratory of Saint Thomas (Becket), with less well preserved frescoes. The museum possesses a Becket reliquary chasse (one of around four dozen still around) and what is claimed to be a Becket miter. The western wall has a contemporary statue of Pope Boniface VIII looking out over the Piazza Innocenzo III.

*Madonna di Loreto, a medieval church
*San Giacomo, a church built in the 13th century under the papacy of Pope Innocent IV, and dedicated to St James and St Lucy
*Sant&#x27;Agostino, a 16th century church

To the south of the town is the imperial Villa of Villa Magna built by Antoninus Pius, still called Villamagna, where a consortium comprising the University of Pennsylvania, the British School at Rome and the Soprintendenza ai Beni Archeologici del Lazio initiated its first campaign of excavation in 2006. These excavations, which continued in 2007 and 2008, have begun to reveal a large and highly decorated building devoted to wine production as well as the remains of the monastery of S. Pietro in Villamagna.

==Language and dialect==

The language, or dialect, of Anagni (called Anagnino) can be categorized as a Central Italian dialect, within the Central-Northern Latian area. The definite articles (the) are &quot;Ju&quot;-masculine singular (pronounced like the English word &quot;you&quot;), &quot;La&quot;-feminine singular, &quot;Ji&quot;-masculine plural (pronounced &quot;Yee&quot;), and &quot;Le&quot;-feminine plural (pronounced like the English word &quot;Lay&quot;). The indefinite articles (a, an) are &quot;nu&quot;-for masculine words and &quot;na&quot; for feminine words. The final vowel is always pronounced in the plural form and usually in the singular form (this is in comparison with Southern Laziale and Neapolitan where the final vowel of a word is usually slurred, unaccented). For those who know Italian, the Anagnino dialect preserves the u&#x27;s found in Latin; for example instead of the Italian &quot;con&quot; (with), the people of Anagni use &quot;cu&quot; from the Latin &quot;cum&quot;. There are many other differences between the Italian and Anagnino. Some examples include the deletion of some n&#x27;s, l&#x27;s, and r&#x27;s commonly found in Italian. For linguistic historians, the dialect is especially important for studying pre-Roman Italic languages and also the formation of Italian. Like Latin, the v&#x27;s are pronounced like u&#x27;s; for example &quot;vino&quot; (wine in Italian) is &quot;uino&quot; in Anagnino. Today&#x27;s Standard Italian is influenced by German, French, Arabic, Greek, and Spanish, while the dialect of Anagni and the others of central Italy (south of Rome, west of the Apennines, and north of Campania) are relatively considered solely Latin and pre-Italic, due to the limited settlement of foreign people in the area.

==Twin towns - sister cities==
Anagni is twinned with:
* Gniezno, Poland
* L&#x27;Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, France

==Notable people==

*Andrea dei Conti (1240-1302), Order of Friars Minor Catholic priest

==In Fiction==

Part of &quot;The Shield of Time&quot; by American Science Fiction writer Poul Anderson is set in 12th Century Anagni, seen by a modern American time traveler.

<text>Marcellin &quot;Marcel&quot; Cerdan (; 22 July 1916 – 28 October 1949) was a French professional boxer and world middleweight champion who was considered by many boxing experts and fans to be France&#x27;s greatest boxer, and beyond to be one of the best to have learned his craft in Africa. His life was marked by his sporting achievements, social lifestyle and ultimately, tragedy, being killed in an airplane crash.

== Early life ==
Marcellin Cerdan was born at 9:00pm on 22 July 1916 in the &quot;Little Paris&quot; neighbourhood of Sidi Bel Abbès in Algeria. He was the fourth son of Antonio Cerdán, a day labourer, and Asunción Cascales, &quot;pied-noirs&quot; of Spanish origin.

==Boxing career==

Cerdan began boxing professionally on 4 November 1934 in Meknes, Morocco, beating Marcel Bucchianeri by a decision in six rounds. He then ran a streak of 47 wins in a row between that first bout and 4 January 1939, when he lost for the first time, to Harry Craster by a disqualification in five rounds in London. Cerdan campaigned heavily in the French territories of Algeria and Morocco during that part of his career, as well as in metropolitan France. In 1938, he beat Omar Kouidri in a 12-round decision at Casablanca to claim the French welterweight title.

After his first loss, Cerdan recorded five consecutive wins, which led him to challenge Saviello Turiello for Europe&#x27;s welterweight title in Milan, Italy. He won the European title by a decision in 15 rounds to continue his ascent towards the championship (back then, it was considered essential to own at least a Continental title belt to earn a world title shot; nowadays, it is not considered as important).

Cerdan&#x27;s winning streak eventually reached 23 bouts before he suffered a defeat to Victor Buttin by disqualification for a second time, in eight rounds in Algiers in 1942. They would later re-match in 1945, and Cerdan would avenge the defeat by knocking Buttin out in the third round.

For his next bout after the first fight with Buttin though, Cerdan put his title on the line against José Ferrer (namesake of the Hollywood star). He knocked out Ferrer in one round, and won four more bouts in a row before facing another boxer with a namesake: James Toney, who shared that name with another James Toney who would become world Middleweight champion five decades later. Cerdan knocked out Toney in two rounds to keep this new winning streak alive. The new streak would reach 37 wins. In between, he joined the American allies in World War II during 1944, and he won the Inter-Allied Championship.

He also went up in weight to the Middleweight division, and won the French title by beating Assane Douf by a knockout in three rounds. He later claimed the vacant European title by beating Léon Foquet by a knockout in one round. He retained that title a couple of times before losing it to rugged Belgian Cyrille Delannoit by a decision in 15 at Brussels, Belgium. Soon, he went back to Belgium and re-took the title by beating Delannoit, also by decision.

Finally, after the rematch with Delannoit, Cerdan was given a world title opportunity and he travelled to the United States, where he beat World Middleweight champion Tony Zale. Cerdan became a world champion by knocking Zale out in the 12th round in Roosevelt Stadium, Jersey City, New Jersey on 21 September 1948.

== Later years ==
During his short period as a world champion, Cerdan became a popular figure of the Paris scene. Although married with three children, he had an affair with the famous singer Édith Piaf. The affair lasted from summer 1948 until his death in autumn 1949. They were very devoted to each other and Piaf dedicated one of her most famous songs, &quot;Hymne à l&#x27;amour&quot;, to Cerdan.

For his first defense Cerdan returned to the United States, where he fought Jake LaMotta in Detroit. Cerdan was knocked down in round one, his shoulder was dislocated, and he had to give up after the tenth round. It would be the last fight of Cerdan&#x27;s life. A contract was signed for a rematch and Cerdan went to training camp for it, but before camp began, he boarded a flight from Paris to New York to visit Piaf, who was performing there.

The aircraft crashed into a mountain on São Miguel Island in the Azores, while on approach to Santa Maria for a scheduled stopover, killing all 48 people on board, including Cerdan and French violinist Ginette Neveu. The following day, LaMotta lauded Cerdan&#x27;s sportsmanship, saying: &quot;You had to fight him as I did to know what a fine sportsman he was.&quot; Cerdan was interred in the Cimetière du Sud, Perpignan, Pyrénées-Orientales, France.

==Legacy==
Cerdan&#x27;s record was 110 wins and 4 losses, with 65 wins by knockout.

He is a member, along with LaMotta and Zale, of the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

In 1983, Cerdan and Piaf had their lives turned into a big screen biography by Claude Lelouch. The film, &quot;Édith et Marcel&quot;, starred Marcel Cerdan Jr. in the role of his father and Évelyne Bouix as Piaf. He is portrayed by actor Jean-Pierre Martins in the 2007 Piaf biopic &quot;La Môme&quot; (entitled &quot;La Vie en Rose&quot; in English-speaking countries).

In 1991, a sports arena located in Levallois-Perret, the Palais des sports Marcel-Cerdan, was named in his honor.

<text>Camel racing is a racing sport in which jockeys riding on camels compete against each other to finish a set number of laps around a circular racetrack. It is most popular in Western Asia, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, Pakistan, Mongolia and Australia. Professional camel racing, like horse racing, is an event for betting and tourism. Camels can run at speeds up to 65 km/h (18 m/s; 40 mph) in short sprints and they can maintain a speed of 40 km/h (11 m/s; 25 mph) for an hour. Camels are often controlled by child jockeys, but allegations of human rights abuses have led to nationwide bans on underage labor in the UAE and Qatar. In modern camel racing, camels are often controlled by remote controlled robotic whips.

==History==
Camel racing is a centuries-old racing event, which has been practiced as a traditional Middle Eastern sport since Medieval times. It can be at least traced back to the 7th century CE Arabian Peninsula where it was a folk sport practiced at social gatherings and festivals. Camels have held an important position in Middle Eastern societies as modes of transportation beyond racing for thousands of years, only recently replaced by automobiles in the mid-20th Century during the oil boom in the region.

Historically, many camel races in the Persian Gulf region of the Middle East existed to serve the purpose of a social event and celebration rather than an intense competition. Bedouin communities often conducted short, 300 to 500 meter long races to commemorate special occasions such as weddings, religious festivals and feasts, and rainfall.

When competitions occurred in past eras of camel racing, the arrangements and prizes were significantly less planned ahead than they are in the races today. Participants were rarely determined more than a day in advance, and usually came as the result of a challenge between camel owners. The sport had very few rules and regulations, and foul play between riders prior to races was common. Furthermore, there were no age or weight classes for camels or riders.

== Camel racing today ==
With the immense influx of money into the Arab world as a result of the oil economy emerging in the 1960s and 70s, the societies of the region underwent massive transformation, and with it, so did camel racing. Due to increased popularity and participation in the sport, races are now split into divisions and classes of race distance as well as the age and breed of the camel to standardize competitions. Numerous tracks were also constructed primarily for camel racing in the United Arab Emirates during the 1980s, including famous tracks Al-Wathba, near Abu Dhabi, and Nad Al-Shiba near Dubai. Both tracks have a maximum spectator capacity of around 1,000 people.Both Emirati men and women participate in the traditional camel race across various categories. For Emirati jockeys which is 6km race has been divided into two categories and according to age while the 1500m race was for expat jockeys.

== Major events and prizes ==
A major camel race is the Camel Cup held at Alice Springs which is the second biggest prize purse camel race in Australia. It is held annually and includes not only the camel races themselves, but also a collection of market stalls and other entertainment.

The biggest prize money camel race in Australia is &quot;The Boulia Desert Sands&quot; with a A$500,000 prize purse in Queensland.

==Child jockeys==
Children are often favored as jockeys because of their light weight, and in order to maximize the camels&#x27; speed they often will fast for days at a time prior to each race. It has been reported that thousands of children (some reported as young as 2 years old) are trafficked usually from countries such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Pakistan, and Sudan for use as jockeys in Arab States of the Persian Gulf. In 2005, aid workers estimated a range of 5,000 – 40,000 child camel jockeys in the Persian Gulf region.

Many child camel jockeys are seriously injured by falling off the camels. The child jockeys live in camps (called &quot;ousbah&quot;) near the racetracks and many are victims of abuse. Hundreds of children have been rescued from camel farms in Oman, Qatar, and UAE and taken back to their original homes or kept in shelter homes. Many however, are unable to identify their parents or home communities in South Asia or Sudan. Some countries have issued penalties for those who trafficked child camel jockeys and ordered the owners responsibilities for returning the children back to their home countries. However, they report that in many instances the children rescued were those who had been sold away by their own parents in exchange for money or a job abroad. If they were returned, the children would again be sold for the same purposes. Other children did not speak their native languages, or did not know how to live outside the camel farms.

A prominent activist for rehabilitation and recovery of the jockeys is Pakistani lawyer Ansar Burney. He has focused a portion of his work on eliminating the use of child jockeys.

===Banning===
The United Arab Emirates was the first to ban the use of children under 15 as jockeys in camel racing when Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan announced the ban on 29 July 2002. In 2009 the UAE paid compensation to 879 former jockeys. While the UAE has said that it issues penalties for those found using children as jockeys, in 2010 volunteers from Anti-Slavery International photographed violations of the ban. Nowadays, the UAE is the birthplace of the current robot jockeys, which are designed to ride camels. The original design, a joint effort between the UAE and Switzerland. 

In Qatar, the former Emir of Qatar, Hamad Al Thani, banned child jockeys in 2005 and directed that, by 2007, all camel races would be directed by robotic jockeys.

<doc id="157164" wikidata="Q312975" url="?curid=157164" title="William Hyde Wollaston">
<text>William Hyde Wollaston (; 6 August 1766 – 22 December 1828) was an English chemist and physicist who is famous for discovering the chemical elements palladium and rhodium. He also developed a way to process platinum ore into malleable ingots.

==Life==

He was born in East Dereham in Norfolk, the son of the Francis Wollaston (1737–1815), a noted amateur astronomer, and his wife Althea Hyde. He was one of 17 children, but the family was financially well-off and he enjoyed an intellectually stimulating environment. He was educated privately (and remotely) at Charterhouse School from 1774 to 1778 then studied Sciences at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. In 1793 he obtained his doctorate (MD) in medicine from Cambridge University, and was a Fellow of his college from 1787 to 1828.

He worked as a physician in Huntingdon from 1789 then moved to Bury St Edmunds before moving to London in 1797. During his studies, Wollaston had become interested in chemistry, crystallography, metallurgy and physics. In 1800, after he had received a large sum of money from one of his older brothers, he left medicine. He concentrated on pursuing his interests in chemistry and other subjects outside his trained vocation.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1793, where he became an influential member. He served as its president in 1820. In 1822 he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Wollaston died in London 28 December 1828 and was buried in St Nicholas&#x27;s Churchyard in Chislehurst, England.

==Work==
After having established a partnership with Smithson Tennant in 1800 in order to produce and sell chemical products, Wollaston became wealthy by developing the first physico-chemical method for processing platinum ore in practical quantities. He held the details of the process secret until near his death and made huge profits for about 20 years by being the only supplier in England of the product which had many of the same qualities as gold, but was much cheaper.

Chemical analysis related to the process of purifying platinum led Wollaston to discover the elements palladium (symbol Pd) in 1802 and rhodium (symbol Rh) in 1804.

When Anders Gustav Ekeberg discovered tantalum in 1802 Wollaston declared the new element identical with niobium (then known as columbium). Niobium and tantalum bear an unusually close chemical similarity, even among vertically adjacent elements. Heinrich Rose would later prove that columbium and tantalum were indeed different elements and he would rename columbium &quot;niobium&quot; in 1846.

The mineral wollastonite was later named after Wollaston for his contributions to crystallography and mineral analysis.

Wollaston also performed important work in electricity. In 1801, he performed an experiment showing that the electricity from friction was identical to that produced by voltaic piles. During the last years of his life he performed electrical experiments, which resulted in his accidental discovery of electromagnetic induction 10 years prior to Michael Faraday, preceding the eventual design of the electric motor: Faraday constructed the first working electric motor and published his results without acknowledging Wollaston&#x27;s previous work. Wollaston&#x27;s demonstration of a motor to the Royal Society had failed, however, but nonetheless his prior work was acknowledged by Humphry Davy in the same paper which lauded Faraday&#x27;s &quot;ingenious&quot; experiments. Wollaston also invented a battery that allowed the zinc plates in the battery to be raised out of the acid, so that the zinc would not be dissolved as quickly as it would if it were in the battery all the time.

His optical work was important as well, where he is remembered for his observations of dark gaps in the solar spectrum (1802), a key event in the history of spectroscopy. He invented the camera lucida (1807) which contained the Wollaston prism (the four-sided optics of which were first described basically by Kepler) and the reflecting goniometer (1809). He also developed the first lens specifically for camera use, called the meniscus lens, in 1812. The lens was designed to improve the image projected by the camera obscura. By changing the shape of the lens, Wollaston was able to project a flatter image, eliminating much of the distortion that was a problem with many of that day&#x27;s biconvex lenses.

Wollaston also devised a cryophorus, &quot;a glass container containing liquid water and water vapor. It is used in physics courses to demonstrate rapid freezing by evaporation.&quot; He used his Bakerian lecture in 1805, &quot;On the Force of Percussion&quot;, to defend Gottfried Leibniz&#x27;s principle of &quot;vis viva&quot;, an early formulation of the conservation of energy.

Wollaston&#x27;s attempt to demonstrate the presence of glucose in the blood serum of diabetics was unsuccessful due to the limited means of detection available to him. His 1811 paper &quot;On the non-existence of sugar in the blood of persons labouring under diabetes mellitus&quot; concluded that sugar must travel via lymphatic channels from the stomach directly to the kidneys, without entering the bloodstream. Wollaston supported this theory by referring to the thesis of a young medical student at Edinburgh, named Charles Darwin, titled, &quot;Experiments establishing a criterion between mucaginous and purulent matter. And an account of the retrograde motions of the absorbent vessels of animal bodies in some diseases.&quot; The medical student was the uncle of the more famous Charles Robert Darwin.

Wollaston prophetically foretold that if once an accurate knowledge were gained of the relative weights of elementary atoms, philosophers would not rest satisfied with the determination of mere numbers, but would have to gain a geometrical conception of how the elementary particles were placed in space. Jacobus Henricus van &#x27;t Hoff&#x27;s &quot;La Chimie dans l&#x27;Espace&quot; was the first practical realisation of this prophecy.

In 1814 he was the first to estimate the atomic weight of carbon to be 12, calculating it from the relative densities of oxygen and carbon dioxide by Jean-Baptiste Biot and François Arago. However, value of 6 (with an according modification of all chemical formulas to have double the number of C atoms) was more popular well into the 19th century.

Also in 1814, Wollaston was part of a royal commission that recommended adoption of the imperial gallon, and in the same year he coined the name bicarbonate. He served on the government&#x27;s Board of Longitude between 1818 and 1828 and was part of royal commission that opposed adoption of the metric system (1819).

Wollaston was too ill to deliver his final Bakerian lecture in 1828 and dictated it to Henry Warburton who read it on 20 November.

* Wollaston wire, extremely fine platinum wire

It has been mentioned that Wollaston has not received the renown which should complement his historical standing in world of science: his contemporaries Thomas Young, Humphry Davy and John Dalton have become far better-known.

Different reasons for this have been suggested, including that Wollaston himself was not systematic or conventional in presenting his discoveries, even publishing anonymously (initially) in the case of Palladium. Also, and perhaps more importantly for his modern legacy, privately held papers of his were inaccessible, and that his notebooks went missing shortly after his death and remained so for over a century; these were finally collated in the late 1960s at Cambridge University and the first comprehensive biography was completed by Melvyn Usselman in 2015, after over 30 years&#x27; research.

<text>Charlton Comics was an American comic-book publishing company that existed from 1945 to 1986, having begun under a different name: T. W. O. Charles Company, in 1940. It was based in Derby, Connecticut. The comic-book line was a division of Charlton Publications, which published magazines (most notably song-lyric magazines), puzzle books, and briefly, books, under the imprints Monarch and Gold Star. It had its own distribution company, Capital Distribution.

Charlton Comics published a wide variety of genres, including crime, science fiction, Western, horror, war, and romance comics, as well as talking animal and superhero titles. The company was known for its low-budget practices, often using unpublished material acquired from defunct companies and paying comics creators among the lowest rates in the industry. Charlton was also the last of the American comics publishers still operating to raise its cover prices from 10 to 12 cents in 1962.

It was unique among comic-book companies in that it controlled all areas of publishing – from editorial to printing to distribution – rather than working with outside printers and distributors, as did most other publishers. It did so under one roof at its Derby headquarters.

The company was formed by John Santangelo Sr. and Ed Levy in 1940 as T. W. O. Charles Company, named after the co-founders&#x27; two sons, both named Charles, and became Charlton Publications in 1945.

==History==

===Early years===
In 1931, Italian immigrant John Santangelo Sr., a bricklayer who had started a construction business in White Plains, New York, five years earlier, began what became a highly successful business publishing song-lyric magazines out of nearby Yonkers, New York. Operating in violation of copyright laws, however, he was sentenced in 1934 to a year and a day at New Haven County Jail in New Haven, Connecticut, near Derby, where his wife and he by then lived. In jail, he met Waterbury, Connecticut attorney Ed Levy, with whom he began legitimate publishing in 1935, acquiring permissions to reproduce lyrics in such magazines as &quot;Hit Parade&quot; and &quot;Big Song Magazine&quot;. Santangelo and Levy opened a printing plant in Waterbury the following year, and in 1940, founded the T.W.O. Charles Company, eventually moving its headquarters to Derby. Charlton purchased the company Song Lyrics, Inc., which published &quot;Song Hits&quot; magazine and was owned by Lyle Engel in 1949.

Following the adoption of the Charlton Comics name in 1946, the company over the next five years acquired material from freelance editor and comics packager Al Fago (brother of former Timely Comics editor Vincent Fago). Charlton additionally published &quot;Merry Comics&quot;, &quot;Cowboy Western&quot;, the Western title &quot;Tim McCoy&quot;, and &quot;Pictorial Love Stories&quot;.

The company used a second-hand press originally used for printing cereal boxes. These large presses were very costly to both stop and start, which only happened twice a year when they had to be cleaned, and so they started publishing comics as a mean to keep the presses going. After the entry into the comic business, the company&#x27;s first comic book was &quot;Yellowjacket&quot;, an anthology of superhero and horror stories launched September 1944 under the imprint Frank Comunale Publications, with Ed Levy listed as publisher. &quot;Zoo Funnies&quot; was published under the imprint Children Comics Publishing; &quot;Jack in the Box&quot;, under Frank Comunale; and &quot;TNT Comics&quot;, under Charles Publishing Co. Another imprint was Frank Publications.

In 1951, when Al Fago began as an in-house editor, Charlton hired a staff of artists who included its future managing editor, Dick Giordano. Others (staff or freelance) who eventually worked with Charlton included Vince Alascia, Jon D&#x27;Agostino, Sam Glanzman, Rocco &quot;Rocke&quot; Mastroserio, Bill Molno, Charles Nicholas, and Sal Trapani. The primary writer was the remarkably prolific Joe Gill. The same year the company created an in-house comics department, where comics would make up 25% of Charlton.

The company began a wide expansion of its comics line, which included notoriously gory horror comics (the principal title being Steve Ditko&#x27;s &quot;The Thing!&quot;). In 1954–55, it acquired a stable of comic-book properties from the defunct Superior Comics, Mainline Publications, St. John Publications, and most significantly, Fawcett Publications, which was shutting down its Fawcett Comics division. Charlton continued publishing two of Fawcett&#x27;s horror books—&quot;This Magazine Is Haunted&quot; and &quot;Strange Suspense Stories&quot;—initially using unpublished material from Fawcett&#x27;s inventory. Artistic chores were then handed to Ditko, whose moody, individualistic touch came to dominate Charlton&#x27;s supernatural line. Beset by the circulation slump that swept the industry towards the end of the 1950s, &quot;Haunted&quot; struggled for another two years, published bimonthly until May 1958. &quot;Strange Suspense Stories&quot; ran longer, lasting well into the 1960s before &quot;giving up the ghost&quot; in 1965.

Charlton published a wide line of romance titles, particularly after it acquired the Fawcett line, which included the romance comics &quot;Sweethearts&quot;, &quot;Romantic Secrets&quot;, and &quot;Romantic Story&quot;. &quot;Sweethearts&quot; was the comic world&#x27;s first monthly romance title (debuting in 1948), and Charlton continued publishing it until 1973. Charlton had launched its first original romance title in 1951, &quot;True Life Secrets&quot;, but that series only lasted until 1956. Charlton also picked up a number of Western titles from the defunct Fawcett Comics line, including &quot;Gabby Hayes Western&quot;, &quot;Lash LaRue Western&quot;, &quot;Monte Hale Western&quot;, &quot;Rocky Lane Western&quot;.
&quot;Six-Gun Heroes&quot;, &quot;Tex Ritter Western&quot;, &quot;Tom Mix Western&quot;, and &quot;Western Hero&quot;.

Seeking to save money on second-class postage permits, Charlton, like many comic-book publishers of the era, frequently changed the titles of their comics, rather than start new ones at number 1 (a new publication required a new postal permit, while an existing publication that just changed its name could use its existing permit). Notable examples of this practice include the titles &quot;Billy the Kid&quot; (originally &quot;Masked Raider&quot;), &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; vol. 2 (originally &quot;The Thing!&quot;), &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; vol. 3 (originally &quot;Unusual Tales&quot;), &quot;Fightin&#x27; Air Force&quot; (originally &quot;Never Again&quot;), &quot;Fightin&#x27; Army&quot; (originally &quot;Soldier and Marine Comics&quot;), &quot;Fightin&#x27; Marines&quot; (originally &quot;The Texan&quot;), &quot;Fightin&#x27; Navy&quot; (originally &quot;Don Winslow of the Navy&quot;), &quot;Ghostly Haunts&quot; (originally &quot;Ghost Manor&quot;), &quot;Ghostly Tales&quot; (originally &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; vol. 3), &quot;I Love You&quot; (originally &quot;In Love&quot;), and &quot;Sweethearts&quot; (originally Fawcett&#x27;s &quot;Captain Midnight&quot;).

Al Fago left in the mid-1950s, and was succeeded by his assistant, Pat Masulli, who remained in the position for 10 years. Masulli oversaw a plethora of new romance titles, including the long-running &quot;I Love You&quot;, &quot;Sweetheart Diary&quot;, &quot;Brides in Love&quot;, &quot;My Secret Life&quot;, and &quot;Just Married&quot;; and the teen-oriented romance comics &quot;Teen-Age Love&quot;, &quot;Teen Confessions&quot;, and &quot;Teen-Age Confidential Confessions&quot;.

On August 19, 1955, the company was hit hard by a flood. The water was rising so fast that vital office records was all that could be saved. $300,000 in paper inventory, plates, mats and original comics artwork were lost, including the artwork the company had bought from Fawcett Comics, in addition to printing presses and typesetting machines. Several issues of comics were destroyed, and some titles abandoned completely. Due to the shutdown following the flood, the comics were outsourced to outside presses for some months.

Superheroes were a minor part of the company. At the beginning, Charlton&#x27;s main characters were Yellowjacket, not to be confused with the later Marvel character, and Diana the Huntress. In the mid-1950s, Charlton briefly published a &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; title with new and reprinted stories, and in 1956, several short-lived titles written by Superman co-creator Jerry Siegel, such as &quot;Mr. Muscles&quot;, &quot;Zaza the Mystic&quot;, and &quot;Nature Boy&quot; (the latter with artist Mastroserio).

===Silver Age===
The company&#x27;s most noteworthy period was during the &quot;silver age&quot; of comic books, which had begun with DC Comics&#x27; successful revival of superheroes in 1956. In March 1960, Charlton&#x27;s science-fiction anthology title &quot;Space Adventures&quot; introduced Captain Atom, by Gill and the future co-creator of Marvel Comics&#x27; Spider-Man, Steve Ditko. (After the mid-1980s demise of Charlton, Captain Atom went on to become a stalwart of the DC stable, as would Blue Beetle, the old Fox Comics superhero revived by Gill and artists Bill Fraccio and Tony Tallarico as a campy, comedic character in &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; #1 [June 1964].) 

Charlton also had moderate success with Son of Vulcan, its answer to Marvel&#x27;s Thor, in &quot;Mysteries of Unexplored Worlds&quot; #46 (May 1965).

During the Silver Age, Charlton, like Marvel and DC, published war comics. Notable titles included the &quot;Fightin&#x27;&quot; line of &quot;Fightin&#x27; Air Force&quot;, &quot;Fightin&#x27; Army&quot;, &quot;Fightin&#x27; Marines&quot;, and &quot;Fightin&#x27; Navy&quot;; the &quot;Attack&quot; line of &quot;Army Attack&quot; and &quot;Submarine Attack&quot;; &quot;Battlefield Action&quot;; &quot;D-Day&quot;, &quot;U.S. Air Force Comics&quot;, and &quot;War Heroes&quot;. Though primarily anthologies of stories about 20th-century warfare, they included a small number of recurring characters and features, including &quot;The American Eagle&quot;, &quot;Shotgun Harker and the Chicken&quot;, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Brigade&quot;, &quot;The Iron Corporal&quot;, and &quot;The Lonely War of Capt. Willy Schultz&quot;. &quot;Army War Heroes&quot; and &quot;Marine War Heroes&quot; depicted stories based on actual Medal of Honor recipients. &quot;Space War&quot;, first created in 1959 became &quot;Fightin&#x27; 5&quot; in 1964.

With the mid-1960s fad for James Bond secret agents such as &quot;Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;, Charlton turned their Vietnam veteran Mike Hammer hardboiled detective &quot;Sarge Steel&quot; into a special agent after the sixth issue, later renaming the comic &quot;Secret Agent&quot;.

Charlton threw itself into the resurgent horror comics genre during this period with such titles as &quot;Ghostly Tales&quot;, &quot;The Many Ghosts of Doctor Graves&quot;, and &quot;Ghost Manor&quot;. It also created a pair of identical horror-movie magazines: &quot;Horror Monsters&quot; (1961–1964) and &quot;Mad Monsters&quot; (1961–1965). Additionally, Charlton produced comics based on monsters featured in motion pictures such as &quot;Konga&quot;, &quot;Gorgo&quot; and &quot;Reptilicus&quot;.

Charlton continued its commitment to romance comics with such new titles as &quot;Career Girl Romances&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Romances&quot; (later to change its name to &quot;For Lovers Only&quot;), and &quot;Time for Love&quot;.

In 1965, Charlton revived the Captain Atom character in &quot;Strange Suspense Stories&quot; numbers 75, 76, and 77, reprinting the Steve Ditko-illustrated stories that had originally appeared in &quot;Space Adventures&quot; in the early 1960s. Retitling the comic, &quot;Captain Atom&quot; Volume 2 #78 (cover dated Dec. 1965), Charlton began publishing newly created stories by Ditko of the superhero. In 1967, Ditko stopped working at Marvel and returned to Charlton full-time. After his celebrated stint at Marvel, he had grown disenchanted with that company and his Spider-Man collaborator, writer-editor Stan Lee. Having the hugely popular Ditko back helped prompt Charlton editor Giordano to introduce the company&#x27;s &quot;Action Hero&quot; superhero line, with characters including Captain Atom, Ditko&#x27;s the Question, Gill and artist Pat Boyette&#x27;s The Peacemaker, Gill and company art director Frank McLaughlin&#x27;s Judomaster, Pete Morisi&#x27;s &quot;Peter Cannon... Thunderbolt&quot;, and Ditko&#x27;s new &quot;Ted Kord&quot; version of the Blue Beetle. Because Giordano had a personal dislike for superheroes and wanted to keep them in a pulplike realm of relative believability, all the characters in his Action Hero line, except for Captain Atom, were ordinary humans which used their skills and talents instead of superpowers. The company also developed a reputation as a place for new talent to break into comics; examples include Jim Aparo, Dennis O&#x27;Neil and Sam Grainger. As well, Charlton in the late 1960s published some of the first manga in America, in &quot;Ghost Manor&quot; and other titles (thanks to artist Sanho Kim), and artist Wayne Howard became the industry&#x27;s first known cover-credited series creator, with the horror-anthology &quot;Midnight Tales&quot; blurbing &quot;Created by Wayne Howard&quot; on each issue—&quot;a declaration perhaps unique in the industry at the time&quot;.

Yet by the end of 1967, Charlton&#x27;s superhero titles had been cancelled, and licensed properties had become the company&#x27;s staples, particularly cartoon characters from Hanna-Barbera (&quot;The Flintstones&quot;, &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, &quot;Top Cat&quot;, , others). Charlton took over publication of a number of King Features Syndicate characters from that company&#x27;s short-lived King Comics, including &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot;, &quot;Blondie Comics&quot;, &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, &quot;Jungle Jim&quot;, &quot;The Phantom&quot;, and &quot;Popeye&quot;. Charlton also published &quot;Bullwinkle and Rocky&quot;, and &quot;Hoppity Hooper&quot;, based on Jay Ward Productions&#x27; &quot;Hoppity Hooper&quot;, and &quot;Rocky and His Friends/The Bullwinkle Show&quot;.

Charlton dabbled occasionally in adaptations of live-action TV comedies. The most successful was &quot;My Little Margie&quot;, based on the 1952-55 network series starring Gale Storm; the Charlton version ran for a full 10 years (1954-64, 54 issues) and inspired two spinoffs, &quot;My Little Margie&#x27;s Boy Friends&quot; (1955–58, 11 issues) and &quot;My Little Margie&#x27;s Fashions&quot; (1959, five issues). &quot;Abbott and Costello&quot;, debuting in 1968, was based on the syndicated Abbott and Costello animated cartoon series of 1967-68 and ran for 22 issues. &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, a remarkably faithful rendition of the then-current CBS-TV series, bowed in 1970 but ran for only seven issues. Both the &quot;Abbott and Costello&quot; and &quot;Hee Haw&quot; comics were discontinued in the summer of 1971, although Charlton&#x27;s &quot;Hee Haw&quot; was revamped for general audiences as a 50-cent magazine, printed in black-and-white with cast photos and jokes supplemented by advertising. The last of the comedy vehicles was &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, based on the then-current ABC-TV sitcom; launched in 1971, the comic book ran for 21 issues until it was cancelled in 1973.

===Bronze Age===
Nicola Cuti made creative improvements to Charlton&#x27;s line in the early 1970s, which had been referred to as comics&#x27; Bronze Age, during which he worked as assistant editor under George Wildman, who was occupied primarily with administrative duties. Cuti brought Mike Zeck, among others, into Charlton&#x27;s roster of artists, and his writing enlivened the &quot;Ghostly&quot; titles, now including &quot;Ghostly Haunts&quot;. Other Bronze Age Charlton horror titles included &quot;Haunted&quot;, &quot;Midnight Tales&quot;, and &quot;Scary Tales&quot;.

In 1973, Charlton debuted the gothic romance title &quot;Haunted Love&quot;, but this same period saw the mass cancellation of almost all of Charlton&#x27;s vast stable of traditional romance titles, including such long-running series as; &quot;Sweethearts&quot;, &quot;Romantic Secrets&quot;, &quot;Romantic Story&quot;, &quot;I Love You&quot;, &quot;Teen-Age Love&quot;, &quot;Just Married&quot;, and &quot;Teen Confessions&quot;, all of which dated from the 1950s.
In the mid-1970s, a brief resurgence of talent occurred, energized by Cuti, artist Joe Staton, and the &quot;CPL Gang&quot; – a group of writer/artist comics fans including John Byrne, Roger Stern, Bob Layton, and Roger Slifer, who had all worked on the fanzine &quot;Contemporary Pictorial Literature&quot;. Charlton began publishing such new titles as &quot;E-Man&quot;, &quot;Midnight Tales&quot;, and &quot;Doomsday + 1&quot;. The CPL Gang also produced an in-house fanzine called &quot;Charlton Bullseye&quot;, which published, among other things, commissioned but previously unpublished material; including the company&#x27;s last &quot;Captain Atom&quot; story. Also during this period, most of Charlton&#x27;s titles began sporting painted covers.

Early in 1975, Cuti, already writing freelance for the company in addition to his staff duties, quit to write freelance exclusively for Charlton when its line expanded to include black-and-white magazines in addition to the King Features and Hanna-Barbera franchised titles. He was replaced by Bill Pearson, who became assistant editor after promoting Don Newton as the new &quot;Phantom&quot; artist and writing scripts for that title.

Charlton&#x27;s black-and-white comics magazines were based upon current television series and aimed at older readers. One of these was &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; #1–7 (July 1976 – August 1977). Retailing for $1, it featured art by Neal Adams&#x27; studio, Continuity Associates, as well as some stories by veteran illustrators Jack Sparling and Win Mortimer. Also published in magazine form were adaptations of &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; spinoff &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Emergency!&quot;, as well as a comic based on teen heartthrob David Cassidy, then starring in the musical sitcom &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;.
By 1976, however, most of these titles had been cancelled, and most of the company&#x27;s remaining titles went on hiatus during the period January to August 1977. Much of the new talent took the opportunity to move on to Marvel and DC.

===Final years===
By the 1980s, Charlton was in decline. The comic-book industry was in a sales slump, struggling to reinvent a profitable distribution and retail system. Charlton&#x27;s licensed titles lapsed, its aging presses were deteriorating towards uselessness, and the company did not have the resources to replace them. In 1981, yet another attempt was made at new material, with a comic-book version of &quot;Charlton Bullseye&quot; serving as a new-talent showcase that actively solicited submissions by comic-book fans, and an attempt at new Ditko-produced titles. A number of 1970s-era titles were also reprinted under the Modern Comics imprint and sold in bagged sets in department stores (in much the same way Gold Key Comics were published under the Whitman Comics moniker around the same time). None of these measures worked, and in 1984, Charlton Comics suspended publication.

In 1985, a final attempt at a revival was spearheaded by new editor T. C. Ford with a direct-to-market &quot;Charlton Bullseye Special&quot;. Later that same year, though, Charlton Comics went out of business; Charlton Publications followed suit in 1991, and its building and presses were demolished in 1999.

Editor Robin Snyder oversaw the sale of some properties to their creators, though most of the rights were purchased by Canadian entrepreneur Roger Broughton. He produced several reprint titles under the company name of Avalon Communications and its imprint America&#x27;s Comics Group (ACG for short, Broughton having also purchased the rights to the defunct American Comics Group properties), and announced plans to restart Charlton Comics. This did not occur beyond its publishing a number of reprints and changing his company name to &quot;Charlton Media Group&quot;.

Most of Charlton&#x27;s line of action heroes were acquired in 1983 for $5000 a character by Paul Levitz at DC Comics, as a gift to managing editor and former Charlton editor Dick Giordano. These &quot;Action Hero&quot; characters were proposed to be used in the landmark &quot;Watchmen&quot; miniseries written by Alan Moore, but DC then chose to save the characters for other uses. Moore instead developed new characters loosely based on them. The Charlton characters were incorporated into DC&#x27;s main superhero line, starting in the epic &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; miniseries of 1985.

Charlton&#x27;s original strength, doing everything in-house, like art, lettering, editorial, printing, packaging and distribution, had helped them survive when America&#x27;s largest distributor, American News Company, closed its doors. But this gradually turned into a weakness as their old equipment was stuck in the past, while other companies used more modern equipment that was faster, had higher quality and was more efficient, which contributed to their decline and fall.

===Fan revivals===
In 2000, &quot;Charlton Spotlight&quot;, a fanzine devoted to Charlton, began publication.

In 2014, comics writers Mort Todd, Paul Kupperberg, and Roger McKenzie founded a revival imprint named Charlton Neo, which relied heavily on crowdfunding, and printed stories featuring Charlton characters and titles not owned by DC. In May 2017, AC Comics announced that they had entered into an agreement to bring print versions of Charlton Neo&#x27;s comics to the direct-sales comic shop market, starting with &quot;Charlton Arrow&quot; #1 in September. &quot;The Charlton Arrow&quot;, an anthology series featuring many Charlton characters, was the company&#x27;s main product and only title sold in stores, but the company ran a number of other titles through mail-order and digital sales. In January 2018, citing poor sales and &quot;a variety of financial calamities,&quot; Todd launched a GoFundMe campaign to &quot;help save&quot; the company.

<text>Time Bandits is a 1981 British fantasy adventure film co-written, produced, and directed by Terry Gilliam. It stars David Rappaport, Sean Connery, John Cleese, Shelley Duvall, Ralph Richardson, Katherine Helmond, Ian Holm, Michael Palin, Peter Vaughan and David Warner. The film tells the story of a young boy taken on an adventure through time with a band of thieves who plunder treasure from various points in history.

In 1979, Terry Gilliam was unable to set up the film &quot;Brazil&quot;; therefore, he proposed a family film. &quot;Time Bandits&quot; was co-written with fellow Monty Python Michael Palin, financed by ex-Beatle George Harrison&#x27;s HandMade Films and filmed in England, Morocco and Wales. The film was released in cinemas on 2 July 1981 in the United Kingdom and on 6 November 1981 in the United States. On its initial release, the film received mainly positive reviews from critics; it opened at number one at the weekend box office in the US and Canada, and, by the end of its run, grossed $36 million on a budget of $5 million.

Gilliam has referred to &quot;Time Bandits&quot; as the first in his &quot;Trilogy of Imagination&quot;, followed by &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985) and ending with &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot; (1988).

==Plot==
Kevin is a young boy fascinated by history, particularly that of Ancient Greece. His parents ignore his activities, having become obsessed with buying the latest household gadgets. One night, as Kevin is sleeping, an armoured knight on a horse bursts out of his wardrobe. Kevin hides under the covers as the knight rides off into a forest where his bedroom wall was; when Kevin looks again, the room is back to normal and he finds one of his photos on the wall similar to the forest he saw. The next night he prepares a satchel with supplies and a Polaroid camera but is surprised when six dwarfs spill out of the wardrobe. Kevin quickly learns the group has stolen a map and is looking for an exit from his room before they are discovered. They find that the bedroom wall leads to a portal. Kevin is hesitant to join until the apparition of a floating, menacing head—the Supreme Being—appears behind them, demanding the return of the map. Kevin and the dwarves find an empty void at the end of the hallway.

They land in Italy during the Battle of Castiglione. As they recover, Kevin learns that Randall is the lead dwarf of the group, which also includes Fidgit, Strutter, Og, Wally, and Vermin. They were once employed by the Supreme Being to repair holes in the spacetime fabric, but realised the potential to use the map that identifies these holes to steal riches and escape via time/space travel. With Kevin&#x27;s help, they visit several locations in spacetime and meet figures such as Napoleon Bonaparte and Robin Hood. Kevin uses his camera to document their visits. However, they are unaware that their activities are being monitored by Evil, a malevolent being who is able to manipulate reality and is attempting to acquire the map.

Kevin becomes separated from the group and ends up in Mycenaean Greece, meeting King Agamemnon. After Kevin inadvertently helps Agamemnon kill a Minotaur, the king adopts him. Randall and the others soon locate Kevin and abduct him, much to his resentment, and escape through another hole, arriving on the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. After it sinks, they tread water while arguing with each other. Evil manipulates the group and transports them to his realm, the Time of Legends. After surviving encounters with ogres and a giant, Kevin and the dwarfs locate the Fortress of Ultimate Darkness and are led to believe that &quot;The Most Fabulous Object in the World&quot; awaits them, luring them into Evil&#x27;s trap. Evil takes the map and locks the group in a cage over a bottomless pit. While looking through the Polaroids he took, Kevin finds one that includes the map, and the group realises that there is a hole near them. They escape from the cage and Kevin distracts their pursuers while the others go through the hole.

Evil confronts Kevin and takes the map from him. The dwarfs return with various warriors and fighting machines from across time, but Evil effortlessly and comically defeats them all. As Kevin and the dwarfs cower, Evil prepares to unleash his ultimate power. Suddenly, he is engulfed in flames and burned into charcoal; from the smoke, a besuited elderly man emerges, revealed as the Supreme Being. He reveals that he allowed the dwarfs to borrow his map and the whole adventure had been a test. He orders the dwarfs to collect the pieces of concentrated Evil, warning that they can be deadly if not contained. After recovering the map he allows the dwarfs to rejoin him in his creation duties. The Supreme Being disappears with the dwarfs, leaving Kevin behind as a missed piece of Evil begins to smoulder.

Kevin awakes in his bedroom to find it filled with smoke. Firefighters break down the door and rescue him as they put out a fire in his house. One of the firemen finds that his parents&#x27; new toaster oven caused the fire. As Kevin recovers, he finds one of the firemen resembles Agamemnon and discovers that he still has the photos from his adventure. Kevin&#x27;s parents discover a smouldering rock in the toaster oven. Recognising it as a piece of Evil, Kevin warns them not to touch it, but they ignore him, do so and explode, leaving only their shoes. As the Agamemnon-firefighter winks at the boy before leaving, Kevin approaches the smoking shoes and is seen from above as his figure grows smaller, revealing the planet and then outer space, before being rolled up in the map by the Supreme Being.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
In November 1979, Terry Gilliam developed the concept for &quot;Time Bandits&quot; after he had started work on &quot;Brazil&quot;. Monty Python manager and producer Denis O&#x27;Brien had difficulty understanding the concept of &quot;Brazil&quot;, so Gilliam decided on the idea of a family film. O&#x27;Brien had set up HandMade Films in London for the former Beatle George Harrison to produce &quot;Life of Brian&quot; and the initiative was to produce more films with Python talent. When Gilliam&#x27;s pitch was accepted he co-wrote the script with fellow Python Michael Palin.

===Casting===
Sean Connery was cast as Agamemnon after he met producer O&#x27;Brien on a golf course. A reference in the script introduced the character with the joke description: &quot;Removing his helmet reveals himself to be none other than Sean Connery or an actor of equal but cheaper stature&quot;. Connery was a Python fan and agreed to do the role for a nominal fee in return for a share of the gross profits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilliam/Palin 1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The part of Robin Hood was originally written for Palin but John Cleese was eventually cast as his name was considered more bankable. Palin decided to appear with Shelley Duvall in the small recurring roles of Vincent and Pansy. Cleese based his performance on the Duke of Kent by watching him having meaningless conversations with footballers at the FA Cup Final during the team line-up before the match. Cleese remarked: &quot;It always struck me as the most extraordinary ritual, the complete futility of that walking up and down thing&quot;.

Ralph Richardson&#x27;s casting as the Supreme Being was because he was regarded &quot;pretty much near God in the acting profession&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilliam/Palin 2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Richardson took his role seriously, marking out his lines in red ink and occasionally saying, &quot;God wouldn&#x27;t say that&quot;.

Ruth Gordon and Gilda Radner were considered for the role of Mrs. Ogre. Palin felt Gordon was the best choice but she had to drop out after sustaining an injury shooting &quot;Any Which Way You Can&quot;. The studio wanted Radner considering her bankable, but Gilliam campaigned for Katherine Helmond due to the popularity of the TV comedy &quot;Soap&quot;.

Jonathan Pryce was offered the role of Evil but opted for another film (&quot;Loophole&quot;) for a higher fee as &quot;he was broke&quot; at the time.

===Filming===
Filming was partly on location with Raglan Castle standing in for Castiglione delle Stiviere, Epping Forest as Sherwood Forest and Aït Benhaddou as Agamemnon&#x27;s palace in Mycenae. Interior scenes were filmed at Lee International Film Studios. Gilliam said he wanted to film from a &quot;kid&#x27;s point of view&quot; and therefore shot from a low camera angle. He also said, &quot;fearing a child wouldn&#x27;t sustain the film ... let&#x27;s surround him with people of a similar height&quot;.

During post-production, Gilliam had argued about changing the story&#x27;s downbeat ending with O&#x27;Brien, who was also pressuring him to include some of Harrison&#x27;s songs. Harrison eventually wrote and performed the closing credits song &quot;Dream Away&quot;. The lyrics contained Harrison&#x27;s comments on &quot;Time Bandits&quot; and on Gilliam&#x27;s behaviour during the making of the film.

=== Japanese release ===
The theatrical release in Japan was 1983. At cinemas outside of major metropolitan areas, preview screenings were shown as a double feature alongside the domestic production &quot;Harmagedon&quot;. Therefore, for commercial reasons on the part of the distributor who wanted to sell it as a children&#x27;s programme, editing was carried out in a manner unique to Japan that &quot;neglected the true intent of the work.&quot; Part of the scene of Robin Hood and the cannibal couple, and the last scene where the parents disappear were cut, resulting in a running time of approximately 103 minutes, approximately 13 minutes shorter than the original.

The last scene was used uncut when it was aired on TV (&quot;Sunday Western Movie Theater&quot; broadcast on 10 January 1988). Each videogram version (LD, DVD, Blu-ray) released in Japan is the original full-length version.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was released in the US on 6 November 1981 and opened at number one at the box office for the weekend, grossing $6,507,356 from 821 theatres. The film remained number one for 4 weeks and grossed $36 million in the United States and Canada on a budget of $5 million (£2.2 million), and was the 13th highest-grossing film of the year in North America.

The film was re-released in the US on 12 November 1982 and grossed a further $6 million to take its gross to $42.4 million in the United States and Canada.

===Critical response===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 91% rating based on 54 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The consensus states: &quot;&quot;Time Bandits&quot; is a remarkable time-travel fantasy from Terry Gilliam, who utilises fantastic set design and homemade special effects to create a vivid, original universe&quot;. On Metacritic, it received a weighted average rating of 79 out of 100 based on 18 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

The film had mainly positive reviews. Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said it was &quot;a marvellous cinematic tonic, a sumptuous new classic in the tradition of time-travel and fairy-tale adventure&quot;. David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; considered it &quot;at once sophisticated and childlike in its magical but emotionally cool logic ... a wonderful wild card in the fall movie season&quot;. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said it was &quot;a cheerfully irreverent lark – part fairy tale, part science fiction and part comedy&quot;.

Other critics gave the film less praise. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; said: &quot;I&#x27;m usually fairly certain whether or not I&#x27;ve seen a good movie. But my reaction to &quot;Time Bandits&quot; was ambiguous. I had great admiration for what was physically placed on the screen ... But I was disappointed by the breathless way the dramatic scenes were handled and by a breakneck pace that undermined the most important element of comedy, which is timing&quot;. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; thought it was &quot;an uneven special effects extravaganza ... Unfortunately, there are just too many visits to famous people&quot;.

===Legacy===
Gilliam has referred to &quot;Time Bandits&quot; as the first in his &quot;Trilogy of Imagination&quot;, followed by &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985) and ending with &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot; (1988). All are about the &quot;craziness of our awkwardly ordered society and the desire to escape it through whatever means possible&quot;. All three films focus on these struggles and attempts to escape them through imagination: &quot;Time Bandits&quot; through the eyes of a child, &quot;Brazil&quot; through the eyes of a man in his thirties, and &quot;Munchausen&quot; through the eyes of an elderly man.

The film is ranked No. 22 on &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 50 best kids&#x27; movies&quot;. It is listed as one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Top 10 Time-Travel Movies&quot;.

Game designer Richard Garriott was inspired by &quot;Time Bandits&quot; while creating the 1982 game &quot;Ultima II: The Revenge of the Enchantress&quot;, stating that he watched the film about 20 times to create a copy of the time map, as his game would feature a similar mechanic of &quot;time doors&quot; and the game&#x27;s box even had a similar cloth map inside.

==Home media==
The film was originally released in December 1982 on Betamax, VHS, Video 2000 and CED Videodisc in the UK and on VHS in the US the same year.

In 1997, it was released on LaserDisc by The Criterion Collection and includes commentary by Gilliam and Palin, Cleese, Warner and Warnock. It also includes a &quot;Time Bandits&quot; Scrapbook.

In 1999, a DVD was released by Criterion with the original 1997 LaserDisc features and the theatrical trailer. The same year Anchor Bay Entertainment released a version with no extras or special features. In 2004, Anchor Bay released the DVD as a Divimax edition on two discs with special features but no commentary. The features include the AFI&#x27;s &#x27;The Films of Terry Gilliam&#x27; documentary; an interview with Gilliam and Palin; theatrical trailers; Gilliam&#x27;s bio; and a DVD-ROM with the original screenplay and a fold-out Map of the Universe.

In 2010, a Blu-ray version was released by Anchor Bay and included an interview with Gilliam and a theatrical trailer. In 2013, a Blu-ray version was released by Arrow Films in the UK. The original 35mm negative was scanned at 2K resolution and the restoration was approved by Gilliam. In 2014, a Blu-ray was released by Criterion as a new 2K digital restoration and includes the original commentary from the 1997 LaserDisc by Gilliam and Palin, Cleese, Warner and Warnock; a feature with production designer Milly Burns and costume designer James Acheson; a 1998 conversation between Gilliam and film scholar Peter von Bagh; a 1981 appearance by Shelley Duvall on Tom Snyder&#x27;s &quot;The Tomorrow Show&quot;; a photo gallery; the theatrical trailer; and an insert that has a reproduction of the Map of the Universe on one side and an essay by David Sterritt on the other. In 2023, a 4K UHD version was released by Arrow Films and Criterion, again with the transfer supervised by Gilliam, including the same special features as the earlier 2K version.

==Comic book adaptation==
Marvel Comics published a comic book adaptation of the film in February 1982. It was written by Steve Parkhouse and drawn by David Lloyd and John Stokes.

==Planned sequel==
Gilliam and Charles McKeown wrote a script for &quot;Time Bandits II&quot; in 1996 and planned to bring back the original cast, except for David Rappaport and Tiny Ross who had since died. When Jack Purvis died the following year, the sequel was shelved.

==Television series==
In July 2018, it was announced that Apple Inc. had gained rights and closed a deal with Anonymous Content, Paramount Television Studios, and MRC Television to develop a television series version of the Terry Gilliam film, also entitled &quot;Time Bandits&quot;, to distribute on Apple TV+, with Gilliam on board set to serve only as executive producer (thus in a non-writing production role) and Taika Waititi set to co-write and direct the pilot. Lisa Kudrow stars alongside Kal-El Tuck, Charlyne Yi, Tadhg Murphy, Roger Jean Nsengiyumva, Rune Temte, Kiera Thompson and Rachel House.

Production took place in New Zealand in late 2022 and early 2023.

<text>Last Year at Marienbad (), released in the United Kingdom as Last Year in Marienbad, is a 1961 French New Wave avant-garde psychological drama film directed by Alain Resnais and written by Alain Robbe-Grillet. 

Set in a palace in a park that has been converted into a luxury hotel, the film stars Delphine Seyrig and Giorgio Albertazzi as a woman and a man who may have met the year before and may have contemplated or begun an affair, with Sacha Pitoëff as a second man who may be the woman&#x27;s husband. The characters are unnamed.

==Plot==
In an ornate baroque hotel populated by wealthy individuals and couples who socialize with one another, a man approaches a woman and claims they met the previous year at a similar resort (possibly Frederiksbad, Karlstadt, Marienbad, or Baden-Salsa) and had an affair. He asserts that she responded to his request to run away together by asking him to wait a year. The woman, however, insists she has never met the man. He attempts to remind her of their shared past, while she rebuffs him and contradicts his accounts. Between interactions with the woman, a second man, who may be her husband, asserts his dominance over the first by repeatedly defeating him in a game of Nim.

Through ambiguous flashbacks and disorienting shifts in time and location, the film explores the relationships among the three characters. Conversations and events are repeated in different parts of the building and grounds, accompanied by numerous tracking shots of the hotel&#x27;s corridors with ambiguous and repetitive voice-overs. The film offers no definitive conclusion regarding what is real and what is imagined, but by the end, the woman relents and leaves the hotel with the first man.

==Cast==

* Giorgio Albertazzi as the man
* Delphine Seyrig as the woman
* Sacha Pitoëff as the second man, who may be the woman&#x27;s husband

Although the characters are unnamed in the film, in Robbe-Grillet&#x27;s published &quot;ciné-novel&quot; of the screenplay, the first man is referred to as &quot;X,&quot; the woman as &quot;A,&quot; and the second man as &quot;M.&quot;

==Production==
&quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot; was created out of an unusual collaboration between writer Alain Robbe-Grillet and director Alain Resnais. Robbe-Grillet described its basis:
The screenplay Robbe-Grillet wrote was very detailed, specifying not only the dialogue and gestures and décor, but also the placement and movement of the camera and the sequencing of shots in the editing. Resnais filmed the script with great fidelity, and when Robbe-Grillet, who was not present during the filming, saw the rough cut, he said he found the film just as he had intended it, while recognizing how much Resnais had added to make it work on the screen and fill out what was absent from the script. Robbe-Grillet published his screenplay, illustrated by shots from the film, calling it a &quot;ciné-roman&quot; (ciné-novel).

Despite the close correspondence between the written and filmed works, numerous differences between them have been identified. Two notable examples are the choice of music in the film (Francis Seyrig&#x27;s score introduces extensive use of a solo organ), and a scene near the end of the film in which the screenplay explicitly describes a rape, whereas the film substitutes a series of repeated overexposed tracking shots moving towards the smiling woman. In statements by the two authors of the film in the decades after its release, it was partly acknowledged that they did not entirely share the same vision of it. According to Resnais, Robbe-Grillet used to insist that it was he who wrote &quot;Marienbad&quot;, without question, and that Resnais&#x27;s filming of it was a betrayal—but that, since he found it very beautiful, he did not blame Resnais for it.

Filming took place, using black-and-white film and the Dyaliscope widescreen process, over a period of ten weeks between September and November 1960. Most of Delphine Seyrig&#x27;s dresses in the film were designed by Chanel. The locations used for most of the interiors and the gardens were the palaces of Schleissheim and Nymphenburg (including the Amalienburg hunting lodge) and the Antiquarium of the Munich Residenz, all in Munich. Additional interior scenes were filmed in the Photosonore-Marignan-Simo studios in Paris. No filming was done in Mariánské Lázně (Marienbad), nor does the film clarify which scenes, if any, are supposed to be set there.

===Style===
In determining the visual appearance of the film, Resnais said he wanted to recreate &quot;a certain style of silent cinema&quot;, which he sought to produce through his direction as well as the actors&#x27; make-up; he even asked Eastman Kodak if they could supply an old-fashioned film stock that would &quot;bloom&quot; or &quot;halo&quot; to create the look of a silent film, but they could not. Resnais showed his costume designer photographs from Marcel L&#x27;Herbier&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Inhumaine&quot; (1924) and &quot;L&#x27;Argent&quot; (1928), for which great fashion designers of the 1920s had created the costumes, and asked members of his team to look at other silent films, particularly G. W. Pabst&#x27;s &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; (1929), as he wanted Seyrig&#x27;s appearance and manner to resemble that of Louise Brooks in that film. The style of silent films is also suggested by the manner in which the characters who populate the hotel are mostly seen in artificial poses rather than behaving naturalistically.

The film creates ambiguity in the spatial and temporal aspects of what it shows and creates uncertainty in the mind of the spectator about the causal relationships between events. This is achieved through editing by giving apparently incompatible information in consecutive shots, or within a single shot that seems to show impossible juxtapositions, or by means of repetitions of events in different settings. These ambiguities are matched by contradictions in the narrator&#x27;s voice-over commentary. Among the notable images in the film is a scene in which two characters (and the camera) rush out of the château and are faced with a tableau of figures arranged in a geometric garden; although the people cast long dramatic shadows (which were painted on the ground), the trees in the garden do not (and are, in fact, not real trees, but constructions).

The manner in which the film is edited creates a highly nonlinear narrative. It allowed the themes of time and the mind and the interaction of past and present to be explored in an original way. As spatial and temporal continuity is destroyed by the methods of filming and editing that are used, the film offers instead a &quot;mental continuity&quot;, a continuity of thought.

While films that immediately preceded and followed &quot;Marienbad&quot; in Resnais&#x27;s career showed a political engagement with contemporary issues, &quot;Marienbad&quot; focused principally on style. Commenting on this departure, Resnais said: &quot;I was making this film at a time when I think, rightly, that one could not make a film, in France, without speaking about the Algerian War. Indeed I wonder whether the closed and stifling atmosphere of &quot;L&#x27;Année&quot; does not result from those contradictions.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Contemporary critical response to the film was polarized. The controversy was fueled when Robbe-Grillet and Resnais appeared to give contradictory answers when asked whether the man and woman had actually met at Marienbad last year or not, as this was used as a means of attacking the film by those who disliked it.

In 1963, filmmaker and writer Ado Kyrou declared the film a total triumph in his book &quot;Le Surréalisme au cinéma&quot;, recognizing the ambiguous environment and obscure motives within the film as representing many of the concerns of surrealism in narrative cinema. Another early supporter, actor and surrealist Jacques Brunius, declared that &quot;&quot;Marienbad&quot; is the greatest film ever made&quot;.

Less reverently, film critic Pauline Kael called &quot;Marienbad&quot; &quot;the high-fashion experimental film, the snow job at the ice palace ... back at the no-fun party for non-people&quot;. The film was included in &quot;The Fifty Worst Films of All Time&quot; (1978), in which authors Harry Medved and Randy Dreyfuss lampooned its surrealistic style and quoted numerous critics who found it to be pretentious or incomprehensible.

Although it remains disparaged by some critics, &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot; has come to be regarded by many as one of Resnais&#x27; greatest works. It received 23 votes in the British Film Institute&#x27;s decennial &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; polls. Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited it as one of his 100 favorite films. 

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot; holds an approval rating of 93% based on 57 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Elegantly enigmatic and dreamlike, this work of essential cinema features exquisite cinematography and an exploration of narrative still revisited by filmmakers today.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film was refused entry to the Cannes Film Festival, reportedly because Resnais had signed Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s Manifesto of the 121 against the Algerian War, but it won the Golden Lion at the 22nd Venice International Film Festival in 1961. In 1962, it was chosen as the best French film of the previous year by the French Syndicate of Cinema Critics. It was selected as the French entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 34th Academy Awards in 1962 and, though it was not chosen as one of the five nominees for that award, Robbe-Grillet was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay the following year for his work on the film. The film was also nominated for a Hugo Award in the Best Dramatic Presentation category.

==Interpretations==
Numerous explanations of the film&#x27;s events have been put forward, among them: that it is a version of the Orpheus and Eurydice myth, that it represents the relationship between patient and psychoanalyst, that it all takes place in the woman&#x27;s mind, that it all takes place in the man&#x27;s mind and depicts his refusal to acknowledge he has killed the woman he loved, and that the characters are ghosts or dead souls in limbo. Some have noted the film has the atmosphere and the form of a dream, and claim the structure of the film may be understood by the analogy of a recurring dream, or even that the man&#x27;s meeting with the woman is the memory (or dream) of a dream.

Others have heeded, at least as a starting point, the indications given by Robbe-Grillet in the introduction to his &quot;ciné-novel&quot; of the screenplay: &quot;Two attitudes are then possible: either the spectator will try to reconstitute some &#x27;Cartesian&#x27; scheme—the most linear, the most rational he can devise—and this spectator will certainly find the film difficult if not incomprehensible; or else the spectator will let himself be carried along by the extraordinary images in front of him ... and to this spectator, the film will seem the &#x27;easiest&#x27; he has ever seen: a film addressed exclusively to his sensibility, to his faculties of sight, hearing, feeling.&quot; As a suggestion of how one might view the work, he offered, &quot;The whole film, as a matter of fact, is the story of a persuasion: it deals with a reality which the hero creates out of his own vision, out of his own words.&quot;

Resnais, for his part, gave a more abstract explanation of the film&#x27;s purpose: &quot;For me this film is an attempt, still very crude and very primitive, to approach the complexity of thought, of its processes.&quot;

==Influence==
The impact of &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot; upon other filmmakers has been widely recognized and variously illustrated, extending from French directors such as Agnès Varda, Marguerite Duras, and Jacques Rivette to international figures such as Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini. Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980) and David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Inland Empire&quot; (2006) are often cited as showing the influence of &quot;Marienbad&quot;. Terence Young stated that he styled the pre-credits sequence of the &quot;James Bond&quot; film &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; (1963) after &quot;Marienbad&quot;. Peter Greenaway said the film had been the most important influence upon his own filmmaking (and he himself would go on to establish a close working relationship with its cinematographer, Sacha Vierny).

The film&#x27;s visual style has been imitated in many TV commercials and fashion photography. The music video for English rock group Blur&#x27;s 1994 single &quot;To the End&quot; parodies the film, with frontman Damon Albarn as X and guitarist Graham Coxon as M.

The film inspired a brief craze for the variation of Nim played by the characters.

&quot;Marienbad&quot; served as the main inspiration for Karl Lagerfeld&#x27;s Chanel spring–summer 2011 collection, as Coco Chanel designed the costumes for the film. The setting for Lagerfeld&#x27;s show consisted of a fountain and a modern replica of the film&#x27;s garden. For Chanel&#x27;s spring–summer 2023 collection, designer Virginie Viard reused Lagerfeld&#x27;s idea of basing a collection around the film.

==Home media and restoration==
On 23 June 2009, The Criterion Collection released &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot; in the United States, on both Region 1 DVD and Blu-ray. Alain Resnais participated in this release, and he insisted it include an unrestored soundtrack in addition to the restored one, saying:

The Criterion packaging of the film went out of print in March 2013.

In July 2018, a restored version of &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot; was selected to be screened in the Venice Classics section of the 75th Venice International Film Festival. The restored version was released theatrically in France on 19 September 2018 by Tamasa Distribution, followed by a DVD and Blu-ray release on 25 September by StudioCanal. In the United States, it was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 25 August 2019 by Kino Classics.

<text>Swithun (or Swithin; ; ; died 863) was an Anglo-Saxon bishop of Winchester and subsequently patron saint of Winchester Cathedral. His historical importance as bishop is overshadowed by his reputation for posthumous miracle-working. According to tradition, if it rains on Saint Swithun&#x27;s bridge (Winchester) on his feast day (15 July) it will continue for forty days.

==Biography==
St. Swithun was Bishop of Winchester from his consecration on 30 October 852 until his death on 2 July 863. However, he is scarcely mentioned in any document of his own time. His death is entered in the Canterbury manuscript of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (MS F) under the year 861. He is recorded as a witness to nine charters, the earliest of which (S 308) is dated 854.

More than a hundred years later, when Dunstan and Æthelwold of Winchester were inaugurating their church reform, Swithun was adopted as patron of the restored church at Winchester, formerly dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul. His body was transferred from its almost forgotten grave to Æthelwold&#x27;s new basilica on 15 July 971; according to contemporary writers, numerous miracles preceded and followed the move.

==In legend==

The revival of Swithun&#x27;s fame gave rise to a mass of legendary literature. The so-called &quot;Vita S. Swithuni&quot; of Lantfred and Wulfstan, written about 1000, hardly contains any biographical fact; all that has in later years passed for authentic detail of Swithun&#x27;s life is extracted from a late eleventh-century hagiography ascribed to Goscelin of St. Bertin&#x27;s, a monk who came over to England with Hermann, bishop of Salisbury from 1058 to 1078. According to this writer Saint Swithun was born in the reign of Egbert of Wessex, and was ordained priest by Helmstan, bishop of Winchester (838-c. 852). His fame reached the king&#x27;s ears, and he appointed him tutor of his son, Æthelwulf (alias Adulphus), and considered him one of his chief friends. However, Michael Lapidge describes the work as &quot;pure fiction&quot; and shows that the attribution to Goscelin is false.

Under Æthelwulf, Swithun was appointed bishop of Winchester, to which see he was consecrated by Archbishop Ceolnoth. In his new office he was known for his piety and his zeal in building new churches or restoring old ones. At his request Æthelwulf gave the tenth of his royal lands to the Church. Swithun made his diocesan journeys on foot; when he gave a banquet he invited the poor and not the rich. William of Malmesbury adds that, if Bishop Ealhstan of Sherborne was Æthelwulf&#x27;s minister for temporal matters, Swithun was the minister for spiritual matters.

Swithun&#x27;s best-known miracle was his restoration on a bridge of a basket of eggs that workmen had maliciously broken. Of stories connected with Swithun the two most famous are those of the Winchester egg-woman and Queen Emma&#x27;s ordeal. The former is to be found in the hagiography attributed to Goscelin, the latter in Thomas Rudborne&#x27;s &quot;Historia major&quot; (15th century), a work which is also responsible for the story that Swithun accompanied Alfred on his visit to Rome in the 850s. He died on 2 July 862. On his deathbed Swithun begged that he should be buried outside the north wall of his cathedral where passers-by should pass over his grave and raindrops from the eaves drop upon it.

==Veneration==

Swithun&#x27;s feast day in England is on 15 July and in Norway (and formerly in medieval Wales) on 2 July. He is also listed on 2 July in the Roman Martyrology. He was moved from his grave to an indoor shrine in the Old Minster at Winchester in 971. His body was probably later split between a number of smaller shrines. His head was certainly detached and, in the Middle Ages, taken to Canterbury Cathedral. Peterborough Abbey had an arm. His main shrine was transferred into the new Norman cathedral at Winchester in 1093. He was installed on a &#x27;feretory platform&#x27; above and behind the high altar. The retrochoir was built in the early 13th century to accommodate the huge numbers of pilgrims wishing to visit his shrine and enter the &#x27;holy hole&#x27; beneath him. His empty tomb in the ruins of the Old Minster was also popular with visitors. The shrine was only moved into the retrochoir itself in 1476. It was demolished in 1538 during the English Reformation. A modern representation of it now stands on the site.

The shrine of Swithun at Winchester was supposedly a site of numerous miracles in the Middle Ages. Æthelwold of Winchester ordered that all monks were to stop whatever they were doing and head to the church to praise God every time that a miracle happened. A story exists that the monks at some point got so fed up with this, because they sometimes had to wake up and go to the church three or four times each night, that they decided to stop going. St. Swithun then appeared in a dream to someone (possibly two people) and warned them that if they stopped going to the church, then miracles would cease. This person (or persons) then warned the monks about the dream they had, and the monks then caved in and decided to go to the church each time a miracle happened again.

Swithun is remembered in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 15 July.

==Patronage==
Swithun is regarded as one of the saints to whom one should pray in the event of drought.

==Legacy==
There are in excess of forty churches dedicated to St Swithun, which can be found throughout the south of England, especially in Hampshire – see this list. An example is St Swithun&#x27;s, Headbourne Worthy, to the north of Winchester. This church is surrounded on three sides by a brook that flows from a spring in the village; the lych gate on the south side is also a bridge over the brook, which is unusual. Other churches dedicated to St Swithun can be found at Walcot, Lincoln, Worcester, Cheswardine, Shropshire and western Norway, where Stavanger Cathedral is dedicated to him. He is also commemorated at St Swithin&#x27;s Lane in the City of London (site of the former church of St Swithin, London Stone, demolished after wartime damage in 1962), St Swithun&#x27;s School for girls in Winchester and St Swithun&#x27;s quadrangle in Magdalen College, Oxford. In Stavanger, Norway, several schools and institutions are named “St Svithun” after him.

==Proverb==

The name of Swithun is best known today for a British weather lore proverb, which says that if it rains on St. Swithun&#x27;s day, 15 July, it will rain for forty days.

A Buckinghamshire variation has:
Swithun was initially buried outdoors, rather than in his cathedral, apparently at his own request. William of Malmesbury recorded that the bishop left instructions that his body should be buried outside the church, &quot;ubi et pedibus praetereuntium et stillicidiis ex alto rorantibus esset obnoxius&quot; [where it might be subject to the feet of passers-by and to the raindrops pouring from on high], which has been taken as indicating that the legend was already well known in the 12th century.

In 971 it was decided to move his body to a new indoor shrine, and one theory traces the origin of the legend to a heavy shower by which, on the day of the move, the saint marked his displeasure towards those who were removing his remains. This story, however, cannot be traced further back than the 17th or 18th century. Also, it is at variance with the 10th century writers, who all agreed that the move took place in accordance with the saint&#x27;s desire expressed in a vision. James Raine suggested that the legend was derived from the tremendous downpour of rain that occurred, according to the Durham chroniclers, on St. Swithun&#x27;s Day, 1315.

John Earle suggests that the legend comes from a pagan or possibly prehistoric day of augury. In France, St. Medard (8 June), Urban of Langres, and St. Gervase and St. Protais (19 June) are credited with an influence on the weather almost identical with that attributed to St. Swithun in England. In Flanders, there is St. Godelieve (6 July) and in Germany the Seven Sleepers&#x27; Day (27 June). In Russia it is the day of Sampson the Hospitable (27 June old style). 

There is a scientific basis to the weather pattern behind the legend of St. Swithun&#x27;s day. Around the middle of July, the jet stream settles into a pattern which, in the majority of years, holds reasonably steady until the end of August. When the jet stream lies north of the British Isles then continental high pressure is able to move in; when it lies across or south of the British Isles, Arctic air and Atlantic weather systems predominate. The most false that the prediction has been, according to the Guinness Book of Records, was in 1924 when 13.5 hours of sunshine in London were followed by 30 of the next 40 days being wet, and in 1913 when a 15-hour rainstorm was followed by 30 dry days out of 40.

<doc id="157175" wikidata="Q1336170" url="?curid=157175" title="Ramsey theory">
<text>Ramsey theory, named after the British mathematician and philosopher Frank P. Ramsey, is a branch of the mathematical field of combinatorics that focuses on the appearance of order in a substructure given a structure of a known size. Problems in Ramsey theory typically ask a question of the form: &quot;how big must some structure be to guarantee that a particular property holds?&quot;

==Examples==
A typical result in Ramsey theory starts with some mathematical structure that
is then cut into pieces. How big must the original structure be in order to ensure that at least one of the pieces has a given interesting property? This idea can be defined as partition regularity.

For example, consider a complete graph of order &quot;n&quot;; that is, there are &quot;n&quot; vertices and each vertex is connected to every other vertex by an edge. A complete graph of order 3 is called a triangle. Now colour each edge either red or blue. How large must &quot;n&quot; be in order to ensure that there is either a blue triangle or a red triangle? It turns out that the answer is 6. See the article on Ramsey&#x27;s theorem for a rigorous proof.

Another way to express this result is as follows: at any party with at least six people, there are three people who are all either mutual acquaintances (each one knows the other two) or mutual strangers (none of them knows either of the other two). See theorem on friends and strangers.

This also is a special case of Ramsey&#x27;s theorem, which says that for any given integer &quot;c&quot;, any given integers &quot;n&quot;1...,&quot;n&quot;&quot;c&quot;, there is a number, &quot;R&quot;(&quot;n&quot;1...,&quot;n&quot;&quot;c&quot;), such that if the edges of a complete graph of order &quot;R&quot;(&quot;n&quot;1...,&quot;n&quot;&quot;c&quot;) are coloured with &quot;c&quot; different colours, then for some &quot;i&quot; between 1 and &quot;c&quot;, it must contain a complete subgraph of order &quot;ni&quot; whose edges are all colour &quot;i&quot;. The special case above has &quot;c&quot; = 2 and &quot;n&quot;1 = &quot;n&quot;2 = 3.

==Results==
Two key theorems of Ramsey theory are:

* Van der Waerden&#x27;s theorem: For any given &quot;c&quot; and &quot;n&quot;, there is a number &quot;V&quot;, such that if &quot;V&quot; consecutive numbers are coloured with &quot;c&quot; different colours, then it must contain an arithmetic progression of length &quot;n&quot; whose elements are all the same colour.
* Hales–Jewett theorem: For any given &quot;n&quot; and &quot;c&quot;, there is a number &quot;H&quot; such that if the cells of an &quot;H&quot;-dimensional &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot;×...×&quot;n&quot; cube are coloured with &quot;c&quot; colours, there must be one row, column, etc. of length &quot;n&quot; all of whose cells are the same colour. That is: a multi-player &quot;n&quot;-in-a-row tic-tac-toe cannot end in a draw, no matter how large &quot;n&quot; is, and no matter how many people are playing, if you play on a board with sufficiently many dimensions. The Hales–Jewett theorem implies Van der Waerden&#x27;s theorem.

A theorem similar to van der Waerden&#x27;s theorem is &quot;Schur&#x27;s theorem&quot;: for any given &quot;c&quot; there is a number &quot;N&quot; such that if the numbers 1, 2, ..., &quot;N&quot; are coloured with &quot;c&quot; different colours, then there must be a pair of integers &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; such that &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;x&quot;+&quot;y&quot; are all the same colour. Many generalizations of this theorem exist, including Rado&#x27;s theorem, Rado–Folkman–Sanders theorem, Hindman&#x27;s theorem, and the Milliken–Taylor theorem. A classic reference for these and many other results in Ramsey theory is Graham, Rothschild, Spencer and Solymosi, updated and expanded in 2015 to its first new edition in 25 years.

Results in Ramsey theory typically have two primary characteristics. Firstly, they are unconstructive: they may show that some structure exists, but they give no process for finding this structure (other than brute-force search). For instance, the pigeonhole principle is of this form. Secondly, while Ramsey theory results do say that sufficiently large objects must necessarily contain a given structure, often the proof of these results requires these objects to be enormously large – bounds that grow exponentially, or even as fast as the Ackermann function are not uncommon. In some small niche cases, upper and lower bounds are improved, but not in general. In many cases these bounds are artifacts of the proof, and it is not known whether they can be substantially improved. In other cases it is known that any bound must be extraordinarily large, sometimes even greater than any primitive recursive function; see the Paris–Harrington theorem for an example. Graham&#x27;s number, one of the largest numbers ever used in serious mathematical proof, is an upper bound for a problem related to Ramsey theory. Another large example is the Boolean Pythagorean triples problem.

Theorems in Ramsey theory are generally one of the following two types. Many such theorems, which are modeled after Ramsey&#x27;s theorem itself, assert that in every partition of a large structured object, one of the classes necessarily contains its own structured object, but gives no information about which class this is. In other cases, the reason behind a &quot;Ramsey-type&quot; result is that the largest partition class always contains the desired substructure. The results of this latter kind are called either &quot;density results&quot; or &quot;Turán-type result&quot;, after Turán&#x27;s theorem. Notable examples include Szemerédi&#x27;s theorem, which is such a strengthening of van der Waerden&#x27;s theorem, and the density version of the Hales-Jewett theorem.

<text>Louis Clark Brock (June 18, 1939September 6, 2020) was an American professional baseball left fielder. He began his 19-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career with the 1961 Chicago Cubs but spent most of it as a left fielder for the St. Louis Cardinals. An All-Star for six seasons, Brock was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985 in his first year of eligibility and was inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame in 2014.

Best known for stealing bases, Brock once held the major league records for most bases stolen in a single season and in a career. He led the National League (NL) in stolen bases in eight seasons. A member of the 3,000-hit club, he led the NL in doubles and triples in 1968, and in singles in 1972. In 1974, he was the runner-up for the NL Most Valuable Player Award. After retiring as a player, he served as a special instructor coach for the Cardinals.

== Early life ==
Brock was born in El Dorado, Arkansas, to a family of sharecroppers. His family moved to Collinston, Louisiana, when he was two years old. While his family did not have much money, he said that he never felt poor because, &quot;If you don&#x27;t have something, you don&#x27;t miss it.&quot; Brock grew up as a fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers, the team that included Jackie Robinson, Don Newcombe, and Roy Campanella. Although he did not play in organized baseball until he reached the 11th grade, he learned much about the sport from listening to Cardinals radio broadcaster Harry Caray describe the way major league hitters stood at the plate. After attending high school in Mer Rouge, Louisiana, he received academic assistance to attend Southern University in Baton Rouge, but when a low grade in his first semester meant the possibility of losing his scholarship, he decided to try out for the school&#x27;s baseball team in order to secure an athletic scholarship.

== Baseball career ==

===College and the minor leagues===
Brock hit for a .189 batting average in his first year of college baseball, but improved the following year to hit for a .500 average. Southern University won the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics&#x27; baseball championship during his junior year, and Brock was selected for the United States baseball team in the 1959 Pan American Games. When Brock decided to try for a professional baseball career, he traveled to St. Louis to try out for the Cardinals, but the scout who had recommended him was in Seattle to sign Ray Washburn. He then decided to try out for the Chicago Cubs, who signed him as an amateur free agent in 1960. Assigned to play for the St. Cloud Rox, Brock won the 1961 Northern League batting championship with a .361 batting average.

===Chicago Cubs===
Brock made his major league debut with the Cubs on September 10, 1961, at the age of 22. In his rookie season of 1962, Brock became one of four players to hit a home run into the center-field bleachers at the old Polo Grounds in New York City since its 1923 reconstruction. His blast came against Al Jackson in the first game of a June 17 doubleheader against the New York Mets and was one of two that cleared the wall in consecutive days, with Hank Aaron&#x27;s coming the very next day. Joe Adcock was the first to hit a ball over that wall, in 1953. Babe Ruth reached the old bleachers (a comparable distance) before the reconstruction. Brock was not known as a power hitter, though he aspired to be one.

Brock had great speed and base running instincts, but the young right fielder failed to impress the Cubs management, hitting for only a combined .260 average over his first two seasons. In 1964 after losing patience with his development, the Cubs gave up on Brock and made him part of a trade with the St. Louis Cardinals. The June 15 deadline deal for pitcher Ernie Broglio saw Brock, Jack Spring, and Paul Toth head to St. Louis for Broglio, Bobby Shantz, and Doug Clemens. Cardinals general manager Bing Devine specifically sought Brock at the insistence of Cardinals&#x27; manager Johnny Keane to increase team speed and solidify the Cardinals&#x27; lineup, which was struggling after the retirement of left fielder Stan Musial in 1963. At the time, many thought the deal was a heist for the Cubs. Broglio had led the National League in wins four years earlier, and had won 18 games the season before the trade.

===St. Louis Cardinals===
After Brock was traded to the Cardinals, his career turned around. He moved to left field and batted .348 and stole 33 bases for the remainder of the 1964 season. At the time of the trade, the Cardinals were 28–31, in eighth place in the National League, trailing even the Cubs, who were 27–27 and in sixth place. Brock helped the Cardinals storm from behind to capture the National League pennant on the last day of the season. Four months to the day after Brock&#x27;s trade, the Cardinals won the 1964 World Series in seven games over the favored New York Yankees, who were appearing in their 14th World Series in 16 years (and their last until a dozen years later). Brock&#x27;s contributions to the Cardinals&#x27; championship season were recognized when he finished in tenth place in voting for the 1964 National League Most Valuable Player Award. Meanwhile, Broglio won only seven games for the Chicago Cubs before retiring from baseball after the 1966 season. To this day, the trade of Brock for Broglio is considered one of the most lopsided deals in baseball history.
In 1966, Brock ended Maury Wills&#x27; six-year reign as the National League&#x27;s stolen base champion with 74 steals. In David Halberstam&#x27;s book, &quot;October 1964&quot;, the author stated manager Johnny Keane asked Brock to forgo hitting home runs in favor of stealing bases. Brock went on to lead the National League in stolen bases eight times within a nine-year span between 1966 and 1974 (former teammate Bobby Tolan led the league in steals in 1970).

Brock began the 1967 season by hitting five home runs in the first four games of the season, becoming the first player to do so (Barry Bonds tied this record in 2002). He was hitting for a .328 average by mid-June to earn the role as the starting left fielder for the National League in the 1967 All-Star Game. After suffering through a mid-season slump, he recovered to finish the season with a career-high 206 hits and a .299 batting average while leading the league in stolen bases and runs scored as the Cardinals won the National League pennant by ten and a half games. Brock became the first player in MLB history to steal 50 bases and hit 20 home runs in the same season. In the 1967 World Series, Brock hit for a .414 average, scored eight runs, and set a World Series record with seven stolen bases as the Cardinals defeated the Boston Red Sox in seven games.

The Cardinals won the National League pennant for a second consecutive year in 1968 as Brock once again led the league in stolen bases as well as in doubles and triples. In the 1968 World Series against the Detroit Tigers, Brock had three stolen bases in Game 3 and contributed a double, triple, home run, and four runs batted in during Game 4 to help the Cardinals build a three-games to one advantage over the Tigers. The Cardinals appeared to be on the verge of winning a second consecutive World Series, going into the fifth inning of Game 5 with a 3–2 lead. Although Brock&#x27;s base running abilities had proven to be a factor in the previous four games, his carelessness may have cost the Cardinals a run. After Brock had hit a double, he tried to score standing up on Julián Javier&#x27;s single to left, but Willie Horton threw him out with a strong throw to home plate. Detroit rallied for three runs in the seventh inning as Mickey Lolich shut out the Cardinals for the final eight innings to win the game for the Tigers. In Game 7, Brock had another crucial miscue when he was picked off base by Lolich, extinguishing a possible Cardinals rally. The Tigers rallied from being down three games to one behind the excellent pitching of Mickey Lolich to win the series. Brock once again stole seven bases and was the leading hitter in the series, posting a .464 batting average with six runs and five runs batted in.

Beginning in 1969, Brock produced six consecutive seasons with 190 hits or better. He was named NL Player of the Month for the first of three times in his career in May 1971 with a .405 batting average and 8 stolen bases. In August 1973, he broke a record set by Ty Cobb when he stole his 50th base of the season, marking the ninth time he had stolen 50 or more bases in a season. Brock won his second NL Player of the Month Award in August 1974, marking one of only four times the award was given to a player who slugged below .500.

In 1972, Brock improved on Maury Wills&#x27; method by, instead of trying to maximize lead off distance, focusing on starting with a little momentum. &quot;Brock pioneered the rolling start,&quot; states a later &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article, which also maintains that base-stealing tends to be overrated as a factor in team success.

===Stolen base records===
On September 10, 1974, Brock tied Wills&#x27; single-season stolen bases mark of 104 with a first-inning steal of second base in a game against the visiting Philadelphia Phillies, then broke the record with another swipe of second in the seventh inning. He ended the season with a new major league single-season record of 118 stolen bases. Brock finished second to Steve Garvey in the balloting for the 1974 National League Most Valuable Player Award.

In a game against the San Diego Padres on August 29, 1977, at San Diego Stadium, Brock broke Ty Cobb&#x27;s career record of 892 stolen bases and became the all-time major league stolen base leader. Cobb&#x27;s record had been one of the most durable in baseball and, like Babe Ruth&#x27;s record of 714 career home runs, had been considered unbreakable by some observers.  Brock held this record until May 31, 1991, when it was broken by Rickey Henderson of the Oakland Athletics, who would go on to steal a total of 1,406 bases.

Brock remained best known for base-stealing and starting Cardinals rallies. He was said to have disliked Wills&#x27; method of base-stealing, instead shortening his leads and going hard. He was also an early student of game films. In 1964, Brock acquired a movie camera and filmed opposing pitchers from the dugout to study their windups and pickoff moves to detect weaknesses he could exploit.

===Later years and retirement===

Brock fell into a hitting slump early in the 1978 season and lost the left fielder&#x27;s job. However, he fought back during spring training in 1979 with a .345 batting average to regain his starting job. Brock was named Player of the Month for the month of May 1979, when he produced a .433 batting average.

On August 13, 1979, in a game against the team that traded him, the Chicago Cubs, Brock became the fourteenth Major League Baseball player to garner 3,000 hits. About one month later, Carl Yastrzemski reached the same plateau and was promptly invited to the White House by Massachusetts native and Speaker of the House Tip O&#x27;Neill. Brock was reported to have felt slighted that he hadn&#x27;t received a similar invitation. Brock originally said that he wouldn&#x27;t go to the White House even if he was invited. However, after consideration, he decided that forgiveness was the best course and accepted a belated invitation to meet with the President. Brock retired at the end of the season, having posted a .304 batting average in his last season at the age of 40. At the end of the season, he was named the National League Comeback Player of the Year — the first player to be so named in his final Major League season.

== Career statistics ==
In his 19-year major league career, Brock played in 2,616 games and accumulated 3,023 hits in 10,332 at bats for a .293 career batting average along with 486 doubles, 141 triples, 149 home runs, 900 RBI, 1,610 runs, 938 stolen bases, 761 bases on balls, a .343 on-base percentage, and a .410 slugging percentage. A six-time All-Star, Brock hit over .300 eight times during his career. He ended his career with a .959 career fielding percentage.

Brock held the single-season stolen base record with 118 until it was broken by Rickey Henderson with 130 in 1982. He also held the major league record for a career stolen bases with 938 until it was also broken by Henderson in 1991. He led the National League in stolen bases for a record eight times and also had a record 12 consecutive seasons with 50 or more stolen bases. Brock is still the National League&#x27;s leader in career stolen bases.

Brock&#x27;s .391 World Series batting average is the highest for anyone who played over 20 series games. His 14 stolen bases in World Series play are also a series record. Brock&#x27;s 13 hits in the 1968 World Series tied a single-series record previously made by Bobby Richardson in 1964 against his Cardinals&#x27; team, and was in turn later tied in 1986 by Marty Barrett.

== Awards, honors and life after baseball ==

Brock received numerous awards during his playing career. In January 1968 he was named the recipient of the Babe Ruth Award as the outstanding player in the 1967 World Series. Brock was honored with The Sporting News Player of the Year Award in 1974. In the wake of his record-setting 118 stolen bases during the 1974 season, Brock was named the winner of the Roberto Clemente Award in March 1975, for best exemplifying the game of baseball both on and off the field. In 1977 he was awarded the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award as the player who best exemplified Lou Gehrig&#x27;s ability and character. In 1978, the National League announced that its annual stolen base leader would receive the Lou Brock Award, making Brock the first active player to have an award named after him.

In October 1979, Brock was named the National League&#x27;s Comeback Player of the Year. In December 1979, he was named as the recipient of the Hutch Award, given to the player who best exemplifies the fighting spirit and competitive desire of Fred Hutchinson. On September 9, 1979, the St. Louis Cardinals retired Brock&#x27;s jersey number 20, an honor that had been bestowed upon only three other players; Stan Musial, Dizzy Dean, and Bob Gibson. In 1983, he was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame.
Brock was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985, his first year of eligibility. He was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame in 1992. Brock was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame in May 1994 and, in 1995 he was inducted into the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame. In 1999, he was ranked Number 58 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2014, Brock and 21 other former players and personnel were inducted into the new St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum.

After retiring from baseball, Brock prospered as a businessman, especially as a florist in the St. Louis area. He briefly worked as a color analyst for &quot;Monday Night Baseball&quot; on ABC in 1980, and for Chicago White Sox telecasts the following year. Brock regularly appeared at Cardinals games. When he stepped onto the field he was always greeted by a loud, low-pitched cheer of &quot;Loooouuuuuuuuuuuu&quot;. He also lent his name to a unique rainhat, shaped like a miniature umbrella, meant to be worn at games during showers in lieu of retreating to the concourse. The product was called the &quot;Brockabrella&quot;.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Brock was a spring training baserunning instructor with various MLB clubs, including the 1982 Cardinals, 1987 Minnesota Twins, 1988 Los Angeles Dodgers and 1993 Montreal Expos. The first three of those four teams won the World Series.

==Personal life==
Brock and his wife, Jackie, were both ordained ministers serving at Abundant Life Fellowship Church in St. Louis, and he was a director on the board of YTB International. Brock&#x27;s speed was referred to in the song &quot;Check the Rhime&quot; by the pioneering &quot;jazz rap&quot; hip-hop ensemble A Tribe Called Quest. On December 5, 2006, he was recognized for his accomplishments on and off of the field when he received the Bobby Bragan Youth Foundation &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot;. Brock was the father of former University of Southern California Trojan and National Football League player Lou Brock Jr. He is also the granduncle of sports journalist and broadcaster Taylor Rooks.

=== Health and death ===
Brock&#x27;s left leg was amputated below the knee in October 2015, because of an infection related to a diabetic condition.

Brock announced on April 13, 2017, that he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow&#x27;s plasma cells. On July 28, 2017, Brock and his wife said they had received word from Mercy Hospital&#x27;s doctors that, according to their blood tests, the cancerous cells were gone. Brock said the cancer had been declining for some time. &quot;We got reports that it was 25% gone, then 50%, then 75% gone,&quot; he said. &quot;The doctors were absolute. [Cancer] is not there.&quot;

Brock died on September 6, 2020, at the age of 81.

<doc id="157178" wikidata="Q764287" url="?curid=157178" title="Van der Waerden's theorem">
<text>Van der Waerden&#x27;s theorem is a theorem in the branch of mathematics called Ramsey theory. Van der Waerden&#x27;s theorem states that for any given positive integers &quot;r&quot; and &quot;k&quot;, there is some number &quot;N&quot; such that if the integers {1, 2, ..., &quot;N&quot;} are colored, each with one of &quot;r&quot; different colors, then there are at least &quot;k&quot; integers in arithmetic progression whose elements are of the same color. The least such &quot;N&quot; is the Van der Waerden number &quot;W&quot;(&quot;r&quot;, &quot;k&quot;), named after the Dutch mathematician B. L. van der Waerden.

This was conjectured by Pierre Joseph Henry Baudet in 1921. Waerden heard of it in 1926 and published his proof in 1927, titled &quot;Beweis einer Baudetschen Vermutung [Proof of Baudet&#x27;s conjecture]&quot;.

==Example==
For example, when &quot;r&quot; = 2, you have two colors, say red and blue. &quot;W&quot;(2, 3) is bigger than 8, because you can color the integers from {1, ..., 8} like this:
and no three integers of the same color form an arithmetic progression. But you can&#x27;t add a ninth integer to the end without creating such a progression. If you add a red 9, then the red 3, 6, and 9 are in arithmetic progression. Alternatively, if you add a blue 9, then the blue 1, 5, and 9 are in arithmetic progression.

In fact, there is no way of coloring 1 through 9 without creating such a progression (it can be proved by considering examples). Therefore, &quot;W&quot;(2, 3) is 9.

==Open problem==
It is an open problem to determine the values of &quot;W&quot;(&quot;r&quot;, &quot;k&quot;) for most values of &quot;r&quot; and &quot;k&quot;. The proof of the theorem provides only an upper bound. For the case of &quot;r&quot; = 2 and &quot;k&quot; = 3, for example, the argument given below shows that it is sufficient to color the integers {1, ..., 325} with two colors to guarantee there will be a single-colored arithmetic progression of length 3. But in fact, the bound of 325 is very loose; the minimum required number of integers is only 9. Any coloring of the integers {1, ..., 9} will have three evenly spaced integers of one color.

For &quot;r&quot; = 3 and &quot;k&quot; = 3, the bound given by the theorem is 7(2·37 + 1)(2·37·(2·37 + 1) + 1), or approximately 4.22·1014616. But actually, you don&#x27;t need that many integers to guarantee a single-colored progression of length 3; you only need 27. (And it is possible to color {1, ..., 26} with three colors so that there is no single-colored arithmetic progression of length 3; for example:
An open problem is the attempt to reduce the general upper bound to any &#x27;reasonable&#x27; function. Ronald Graham offered a prize of US$1000 for showing &quot;W&quot;(2, &quot;k&quot;) &lt; 2&quot;k&quot;2. In addition, he offered a US$250 prize for a proof of his conjecture involving more general &quot;off-diagonal&quot; van der Waerden numbers, stating &quot;W&quot;(2; 3, &quot;k&quot;) ≤ &quot;k&quot;&quot;O(1)&quot;, while mentioning numerical evidence suggests &quot;W&quot;(2; 3, &quot;k&quot;) = &quot;k&quot;2 + &quot;o(1)&quot;. Ben Green disproved this latter conjecture and proved super-polynomial counterexamples to &quot;W&quot;(2; 3, &quot;k&quot;) &lt; &quot;k&quot;r for any &quot;r&quot;. The best upper bound currently known is due to Timothy Gowers, who establishes

: formula_1

by first establishing a similar result for Szemerédi&#x27;s theorem, which is a stronger version of Van der Waerden&#x27;s theorem. The previously best-known bound was due to Saharon Shelah and proceeded via first proving a result for the Hales–Jewett theorem, which is another strengthening of Van der Waerden&#x27;s theorem.

The best lower bound currently known for formula_2 is that for all positive formula_3 we have formula_4, for all sufficiently large formula_5.

== Proof of Van der Waerden&#x27;s theorem (in a special case) ==

The following proof is due to Ron Graham, B.L. Rothschild, and Joel Spencer. Khinchin gives a fairly simple proof of the theorem without estimating &quot;W&quot;(&quot;r&quot;, &quot;k&quot;).

=== Proof in the case of &quot;W&quot;(2, 3) ===

We will prove the special case mentioned above, that &quot;W&quot;(2, 3) ≤ 325. Let &quot;c&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) be a coloring of the integers {1, ..., 325}. We will find three elements of {1, ..., 325} in arithmetic progression that are the same color.

Divide {1, ..., 325} into the 65 blocks {1, ..., 5}, {6, ..., 10}, ... {321, ..., 325}, thus each block is of the form {5&quot;b&quot; + 1, ..., 5&quot;b&quot; + 5} for some &quot;b&quot; in {0, ..., 64}. Since each integer is colored either red or blue, each block is colored in one of 32 different ways. By the pigeonhole principle, there are two blocks among the first 33 blocks that are colored identically. That is, there are two integers &quot;b&quot;1 and &quot;b&quot;2, both in {0...,32}, such that

: &quot;c&quot;(5&quot;b&quot;1 + &quot;k&quot;) = &quot;c&quot;(5&quot;b&quot;2 + &quot;k&quot;)

for all &quot;k&quot; in {1, ..., 5}. Among the three integers 5&quot;b&quot;1 + 1, 5&quot;b&quot;1 + 2, 5&quot;b&quot;1 + 3, there must be at least two that are of the same color. (The pigeonhole principle again.) Call these 5&quot;b&quot;1 + &quot;a&quot;1 and 5&quot;b&quot;1 + &quot;a&quot;2, where the &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; are in {1,2,3} and &quot;a&quot;1 &lt; &quot;a&quot;2. Suppose (without loss of generality) that these two integers are both red. (If they are both blue, just exchange &#x27;red&#x27; and &#x27;blue&#x27; in what follows.)

Let &quot;a&quot;3 = 2&quot;a&quot;2 − &quot;a&quot;1. If 5&quot;b&quot;1 + &quot;a&quot;3 is red, then we have found our arithmetic progression: 5&quot;b&quot;1 + &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; are all red. 

Otherwise, 5&quot;b&quot;1 + &quot;a&quot;3 is blue. Since &quot;a&quot;3 ≤ 5, 5&quot;b&quot;1 + &quot;a&quot;3 is in the &quot;b&quot;1 block, and since the &quot;b&quot;2 block is colored identically, 5&quot;b&quot;2 + &quot;a&quot;3 is also blue.

Now let &quot;b&quot;3 = 2&quot;b&quot;2 − &quot;b&quot;1. Then &quot;b&quot;3 ≤ 64. Consider the integer 5&quot;b&quot;3 + &quot;a&quot;3, which must be ≤ 325. What color is it?

If it is red, then 5&quot;b&quot;1 + &quot;a&quot;1, 5&quot;b&quot;2 + &quot;a&quot;2, and 5&quot;b&quot;3 + &quot;a&quot;3 form a red arithmetic progression. But if it is blue, then 5&quot;b&quot;1 + &quot;a&quot;3, 5&quot;b&quot;2 + &quot;a&quot;3, and 5&quot;b&quot;3 + &quot;a&quot;3 form a blue arithmetic progression. Either way, we are done.

=== Proof in the case of &quot;W&quot;(3, 3) ===

A similar argument can be advanced to show that &quot;W&quot;(3, 3) ≤ 7(2·37+1)(2·37·(2·37+1)+1). One begins by dividing the integers into 2·37·(2·37 + 1) + 1 groups of 7(2·37 + 1) integers each; of the first 37·(2·37 + 1) + 1 groups, two must be colored identically.

Divide each of these two groups into 2·37+1 subgroups of 7 integers each; of the first 37 + 1 subgroups in each group, two of the subgroups must be colored identically. Within each of these identical subgroups, two of the first four integers must be the same color, say red; this implies either a red progression or an element of a different color, say blue, in the same subgroup.

Since we have two identically-colored subgroups, there is a third subgroup, still in the same group that contains an element which, if either red or blue, would complete a red or blue progression, by a construction analogous to the one for &quot;W&quot;(2, 3). Suppose that this element is green. Since there is a group that is colored identically, it must contain copies of the red, blue, and green elements we have identified; we can now find a pair of red elements, a pair of blue elements, and a pair of green elements that &#x27;focus&#x27; on the same integer, so that whatever color it is, it must complete a progression.

=== Proof in general case ===
The proof for &quot;W&quot;(2, 3) depends essentially on proving that &quot;W&quot;(32, 2) ≤ 33. We divide the integers {1...,325} into 65 &#x27;blocks&#x27;, each of which can be colored in 32 different ways, and then show that two blocks of the first 33 must be the same color, and there is a block colored the opposite way. Similarly, the proof for &quot;W&quot;(3, 3) depends on proving that

: formula_6

By a double induction on the number of colors and the length of the progression, the theorem is proved in general.

== Proof ==

A &quot;D-dimensional arithmetic progression&quot; (AP) consists of
numbers of the form:
: formula_7
where is the basepoint, the &#x27;s are positive step-sizes, and the &#x27;s range from 0 to . A -dimensional AP is &quot;homogeneous&quot; for some coloring when it is all the same color.

A &quot;-dimensional arithmetic progression with benefits&quot; is all numbers of the form above, but where you add on some of the &quot;boundary&quot; of the arithmetic progression, i.e. some of the indices &#x27;s can be equal to . The sides you tack on are ones where the first &#x27;s are equal to , and the remaining &#x27;s are less than .

The boundaries of a -dimensional AP with benefits are these additional arithmetic progressions of dimension formula_8, down to 0. The 0-dimensional arithmetic progression is the single point at index value formula_9. A -dimensional AP with benefits is &quot;homogeneous&quot; when each of the boundaries are individually homogeneous, but different boundaries do not have to necessarily have the same color.

Next define the quantity to be the least integer so that any assignment of colors to an interval of length or more necessarily contains a homogeneous -dimensional arithmetical progression with benefits.

The goal is to bound the size of . Note that is an upper bound for Van der Waerden&#x27;s number. There are two inductions steps, as follows:

Base case: , i.e. if you want a length 1 homogeneous -dimensional arithmetic sequence, with or without benefits, you have nothing to do. So this forms the base of the induction. The Van der Waerden theorem itself is the assertion that is finite, and it follows from the base case and the induction steps.

== Ergodic theory ==

Furstenberg and Weiss proved an equivalent form of the theorem in 1978, using ergodic theory.
The proof of the above theorem is delicate, and the reader is referred to. With this recurrence theorem, the van der Waerden theorem can be proved in the ergodic-theoretic style.

<text>The Oresteia () is a trilogy of Greek tragedies written by Aeschylus in the 5th century BCE, concerning the murder of Agamemnon by Clytemnestra, the murder of Clytemnestra by Orestes, the trial of Orestes, the end of the curse on the House of Atreus and the pacification of the Furies (also called Erinyes or Eumenides).

The &quot;Oresteia&quot; trilogy consists of three plays: &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, &quot;The Libation Bearers&quot;, and &quot;The Eumenides&quot;. It shows how the Greek gods interacted with the characters and influenced their decisions pertaining to events and disputes. The only extant example of an ancient Greek theatre trilogy, the &quot;Oresteia&quot; won first prize at the Dionysia festival in 458 BCE. The principal themes of the trilogy include the contrast between revenge and justice, as well as the transition from personal vendetta to organized litigation. &quot;Oresteia&quot; originally included a satyr play, &quot;Proteus&quot; (), following the tragic trilogy, but all except a single line of &quot;Proteus&quot; has been lost.

==&quot;Agamemnon&quot;==

&quot;Agamemnon&quot; (, &quot;Agamémnōn&quot;) is the first of the three plays within the &quot;Oresteia&quot; trilogy. It details the homecoming of Agamemnon, King of Mycenae, from the Trojan War. After ten years of warfare, and Troy fallen, all of Greece could lay claim to the victory. Waiting at home for Agamemnon is his wife, Queen Clytemnestra, who has been plotting his murder. She desires his death to avenge the sacrifice of her daughter Iphigenia, to exterminate the only thing hindering her from taking the crown, and to finally be able to publicly embrace her good-time lover Aegisthus.

The play opens with a watchman looking down and over the sea, reporting that he has been lying restless &quot;like a dog&quot; for a year, waiting to see some sort of signal confirming a Greek victory in Troy. He laments the fortunes of the house, but promises to keep silent: &quot;A huge ox has stepped onto my tongue.&quot; The watchman sees a light far off in the distance—a bonfire signaling Troy&#x27;s fall—and is overjoyed at the victory and hopes for the hasty return of his king, as the house has &quot;wallowed&quot; in his absence. Clytemnestra is introduced to the audience, and she declares that there will be celebrations and sacrifices throughout the city as Agamemnon and his army return.

Upon the return of Agamemnon, his wife laments in full view of Argos how horrible the wait for her husband and King has been. After her soliloquy, Clytemnestra pleads with and persuades Agamemnon to walk on the robes laid out for him. This is a very ominous moment in the play, as loyalties and motives are questioned. The King&#x27;s new concubine, Cassandra, is now introduced, and this immediately spawns hatred from the queen, Clytemnestra. Cassandra is ordered out of her chariot and to the altar, where, once she is alone, she begins predicting the death of Agamemnon and her own shared fate.

Inside the house, a cry is heard: Agamemnon has been stabbed in the bathtub. The chorus separates from one another and rambles to themselves, proving their cowardice, when another final cry is heard. When the doors are finally opened, Clytemnestra is seen standing over the dead bodies of Agamemnon and Cassandra. Clytemnestra describes the murder in detail to the chorus, showing no sign of remorse or regret. Suddenly, the exiled lover of Clytemnestra, Aegisthus, bursts into the palace to take his place next to her. Aegisthus proudly states that he devised the plan to murder Agamemnon and claim revenge for his father (the father of Aegisthus, Thyestes, was tricked into eating two of his sons by his brother Atreus, the father of Agamemnon). Clytemnestra claims that she and Aegisthus now have all the power, and they re-enter the palace with the doors closing behind them.

Like most Greek tragedies, &quot;Agamemnon&quot; is a morally complex play. Agamemnon may be an admired veteran of the Trojan War but it is made clear that many do not approve of the way he sacrificed his daughter, Iphigenia. Many citizens resent Agamemnon because they lost their sons and husbands in the war he initiated. Similarly, Clytemnestra is both her husband&#x27;s murderer and her daughter&#x27;s avenger; Aeschylus continues to explore the fundamental moral quandary of vengeance and &quot;justified&quot; bloodshed in &quot;The Libation Bearers&quot; and &quot;The Eumenides&quot;.

==&quot;The Libation Bearers&quot; ==
In &quot;The Libation Bearers&quot; (, &quot;Choēphóroi&quot;)—the second play of Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Oresteia&quot; trilogy—many years after the murder of Agamemnon, his son Orestes returns to Argos with his cousin Pylades to exact vengeance on Clytemnestra, as an order from Apollo, for killing Agamemnon. Upon arriving, Orestes reunites with his sister Electra at Agamemnon&#x27;s grave, while she was there bringing libations to Agamemnon in an attempt to stop Clytemnestra&#x27;s bad dreams. Shortly after the reunion, both Orestes and Electra, influenced by the Chorus, come up with a plan to kill both Clytemnestra and Aegisthus.

Orestes then goes to the palace door, where he is greeted by Clytemnestra. He pretends he is a stranger and tells Clytemnestra that he (Orestes) is dead, causing her to send for Aegisthus. Unrecognized, Orestes is then able to enter the palace, where he then kills Aegisthus, who was without a guard due to the intervention of the chorus in relaying Clytemnestra&#x27;s message. Clytemnestra then enters the room. Orestes hesitates to kill her, but Pylades reminds him of Apollo&#x27;s orders, and he eventually follows through. Consequently, after committing the matricide, Orestes is now the target of the Furies&#x27; merciless wrath and has no choice but to flee from the palace.

=== Chorus ===
The Chorus in &quot;The Libation Bearers&quot; is distinctly different from the one in &quot;Agamemnon.&quot; From &quot;Agamemnon&quot; to &quot;The Libation Bearers&quot;, the Chorus switches from a collection of old, Argive men, to foreign slave women.p. 46-48 Furthermore, the Chorus in &quot;Agamemnon&quot; possessed a fearful voice, characterized by their critical commentary on the events and characters of the play. Despite this, they play a passive role and do not influence the plot.p. 47-48 In contrast, &quot;The Libation Bearers&quot;″ Chorus desire vengeance, and influence both Electra&#x27;s and Orestes&#x27; actions, shepherding Orestes towards revenge.p. 48-52

==&quot;The Eumenides&quot;==

The final play of the &quot;Oresteia&quot;, called &quot;The Eumenides&quot; (, &quot;Eumenídes&quot;), illustrates how the sequence of events in the trilogy ends up in the development of social order or a proper judicial system in Athenian society. In this play, Orestes is hunted and tormented by the Furies, a trio of goddesses known to be the instruments of justice, who are also referred to as the &quot;Gracious Ones&quot; (&quot;Eumenides&quot;). They relentlessly pursue Orestes for the killing of his mother. Through the intervention of Apollo, Orestes is able to escape them for a brief moment while they are asleep and escape to Athens under the protection of Hermes. Seeing the Furies asleep, Clytemnestra&#x27;s ghost comes to wake them up to obtain justice on her son Orestes for killing her.

After waking up, the Furies hunt Orestes again and when they find him, Orestes pleads to the goddess Athena for help. She responds by setting up a trial for him in Athens on the Areopagus. This trial is made up of a group of twelve Athenian citizens and is supervised by Athena. Here Orestes is used as a trial dummy by Athena to set-up the first courtroom trial. He is also the object of the Furies, Apollo, and Athena. After the trial comes to an end, the votes are tied. Athena casts the deciding vote and determines that Orestes will not be killed. This does not sit well with the Furies but Athena eventually persuades them to accept the decision; instead of violently retaliating against wrongdoers, become a constructive force of vigilance in Athens. She then changes their names from the Furies to &quot;the Eumenides&quot; which means &quot;the Gracious Ones&quot;. Athena then ultimately rules that all trials must henceforth be settled in court rather than being carried out personally.

==&quot;Proteus&quot;==
&quot;Proteus&quot; (, &quot;Prōteus&quot;), the satyr play which originally followed the first three plays of &quot;The Oresteia&quot;, is lost except for a two-line fragment preserved by Athenaeus. It is widely believed to have been based on the story told in Book IV of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, where Menelaus, Agamemnon&#x27;s brother, tries to return home from Troy and finds himself on an island off Egypt, &quot;whither he seems to have been carried by the storm described in &quot;Agam.674&quot;&quot;.

The title character, &quot;the deathless Egyptian Proteus&quot;, the Old Man of the Sea, is described in Homer as having been visited by Menelaus, who sought to learn his future. Proteus tells Menelaus of the death of Agamemnon at the hands of Aegisthus and the fates of Ajax the Lesser and Odysseus at sea. Proteus is compelled to tell Menelaus how to reach home from the island of Pharos: 

The only extant fragment that has been definitively attributed to &quot;Proteus&quot; was translated by Herbert Weir Smyth: 

In 2002, Theatre Kingston mounted a production of &quot;The Oresteia&quot; and included a new reconstruction of &quot;Proteus&quot; based on the episode in &quot;The Odyssey&quot; and loosely arranged according to the structure of extant satyr plays.

== Themes ==
===Justice through retaliation===
Retaliation is seen in the &quot;Oresteia&quot; to cascade. In &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, it is mentioned that Agamemnon had to sacrifice his innocent daughter Iphigenia to shift the wind for his voyage to Troy. This caused Clytemnestra to plot revenge on Agamemnon. She found a new lover Aegisthus and when Agamemnon returned to Argos from the Trojan War, Clytemnestra killed him by stabbing him in the bathtub and went on to inherit his throne. The death of Agamemnon thus sparks anger in Orestes and Electra; they plot matricide (the death of their mother Clytemnestra) in the next play, &quot;Libation Bearers&quot;. Through much pressure from Electra and his cousin Pylades, Orestes kills Clytemnestra and her lover, Aegisthus. Consequently, Orestes is hunted down by the Furies in the third play &quot;The Eumenides&quot;. Even after he escapes, Clytemnestra&#x27;s spirit comes back to rally them again so that they can kill Orestes and obtain vengeance for her. However, this cycle of retaliation comes to a stop near the end of &quot;The Eumenides&quot; when Athena decides to introduce a new legal system for dealing out justice.

===Justice through the law===
Justice through the law is achieved in &quot;The Eumenides&quot;. After Orestes begged Athena for deliverance from the Furies, she granted him his request in the form of a trial. Rather than forgiving Orestes directly, Athena put him to trial to find a just answer to the question of his innocence. This is the first example of proper litigation in the trilogy and illuminates the change from emotional retaliation to civilized decisions regarding alleged crimes. Instead of allowing the Furies to torture Orestes, she decided that she would have both the Furies and Orestes plead their case before she decided on the verdict. In addition, Athena set up how the verdict would be decided. By creating this blueprint, the future of revenge-killings and the merciless hunting of the Furies would be eliminated from Greece. The trial sets the foundation for future litigation. Aeschylus, through his jury trial, was able to create and maintain a social commentary about the limitations of revenge crimes and reiterate the importance of trials. &quot;The Oresteia&quot;, as a whole, stands as a representation of the evolution of justice in Ancient Greece.

=== Revenge ===
Revenge is a principal motivator for most characters in &quot;Oresteia&quot;. The theme starts in &quot;Agamemnon&quot; with Clytemnestra, who murders her husband, Agamemnon, in order to obtain vengeance for his sacrificing of their daughter, Iphigenia. The death of Cassandra, the princess of Troy, taken captive by Agamemnon in order to fill a place as a concubine, can also be seen as an act of revenge for taking another woman as well as the life of Iphigenia. Later on, in &quot;The Libation Bearers&quot;, Orestes and Electra (siblings and remaining children of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra) succeed in killing their mother to avenge their father&#x27;s death. In &quot;The Eumenides&quot;, the Furies—goddesses of vengeance—seek to take revenge on Orestes for the murder of his mother. It is also discovered that the god Apollo played a part in the act of vengeance toward Clytemnestra through Orestes. The cycle of revenge is seen to be broken when Orestes is not killed by the Furies, but is instead given his freedom and deemed innocent by the goddess Athena.

=== Mother-right and father-right ===
To the anthropologist Johann Jakob Bachofen (&quot;Das Mutterrecht&quot;, 1861), the &quot;Oresteia&quot; shows Ancient Greece&#x27;s transition from &quot;hetaerism&quot; (polyamory) to monogamy; and from &quot;mother-right&quot; (matriarchal lineage) to &quot;father-right&quot; (patriarchal lineage). According to Bachofen, religious laws changed in this period: the Apollo and Athena of &quot;The Eumenides&quot; present the patriarchal view. The Furies contrast what they call &quot;gods of new descent&quot; with the view that matricide is more serious than the killing of men. With Athena acquitting Orestes, and the Furies working for the new gods, &quot;The Eumenides&quot; shows the newfound dominance of father-right over mother-right.

Bachofen&#x27;s interpretation was influential among Marxists and feminists. Feminist Simone de Beauvoir wrote in &quot;The Second Sex&quot; (1949) that the tribunal saw Orestes as son of Agamemnon before being son of Clytemnestra. In &quot;The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State&quot; (1884), Marxist Friedrich Engels praises Bachofen&#x27;s &quot;correct interpretation&quot;. Nonetheless, he sees it as &quot;pure mysticism&quot; by Bachofen to see the change in divine perspectives as the cause of the change in Greek society. Instead, Engels considers economic factors—the creation of private property—and the &quot;natural sexual behaviour&quot; of men and women. For the feminist Kate Millett, the latter factor is mistaken, and &quot;The Eumenides&quot; is important in documenting the state&#x27;s arguments for repression of women.

=== Matricide and femininity ===
Electra&#x27;s role in the murder of her mother has been hotly contested by scholars throughout time. Many view Electra&#x27;s by-proxy killing of her mother as a representation of daughter-inflicted matricide.

Psychoanalyst Carl Jung attributes her behavior to what he coined as the &quot;Electra complex&quot; the jealousy of the daughter towards the mother for her sexual engagement with the father. Sigmund Freud disagreed with this claim, noting that the &quot;Oedipus complex&quot; cannot be applied directly to the female sex, since sons do not undergo the same penis-envy as daughters. Many contemporary scholars have theorized what this matricide means in the context of womanhood: Dana Tor invokes Lacan to argue that Electra&#x27;s scheming represents a &quot;ravage&quot; between mother and daughter; Doris Bernstein sees the murder as a step on the path towards Electra&#x27;s individuation; and Melanie Klein views it as emblematic of the dual power of the psyche to split of the mother into a good object and a bad one. Serena Heller recalls Ronald Britton&#x27;s idea of the Athene-Antigone Complex to explain Electra&#x27;s hatred of her mother deriving from an intense idolization of her father and, thus, a compulsion to exonerate herself from the restraints of feminity and the female body. Once the girl recognizes her gendered difference in the world, she must undergo re-cognition, deciding whether to mourn the maleness that she does not possess, or engage in a choice which frees them from their gendered bind. Athene, Antigone, and Electra all have a desire for &quot;female castration&quot; that dictates their choices in their patriarchal societies. Amber Jacobs also claims that the matricide in the Oresteia ultimately embodies a societal repulsion towards the female gender, as Athena&#x27;s motherless status allows Zeus to argue that the father is more important than the mother and absolve Orestes of his crimes. Tor ultimately claims that the convergence of both Orestes&#x27; and Electra&#x27;s motivations for revenge are two-fold: both a repayment for the debt of desire and a symbol of feminine jouissance. They must repay their Freudian or Jungian debts from the guilt of want. Their jouissance in her death arises from a pre-genital dichotomy of love and hatred from the son and the daughter towards the mother.

Professor of philosophical and historical anthropology Elizabeth von Samsonow notes the intense debate over Electra&#x27;s relevance in the murder of Clymenestra—Sophocles, for example, viewed her as a key component of the killing while Aeschylus sees her as incidental—but refutes the tendency to shoehorn her motivations into Freud&#x27;s model. She asks for scholars to reconsider Electra as undergoing vagina-envy, resulting from the woman&#x27;s powerful and sexually-active position in pre-Hellenic society. By liberating Electra from the male-centric complexes and histories that restrict her motivations, study of mother-daughter relations can evolve into an &quot;outline of a future world.&quot; In another of her works, Jacobs, too, writes on the untheorized state of matricide in literature and asks for an expansion of symbolism beyond the classic Oedipean model.

== Relation to the curse of the House of Atreus ==
The House of Atreus began with Tantalus, son of Zeus, who murdered his son, Pelops, and attempted to feed him to the gods. The gods, however, were not tricked and banished Tantalus to the Underworld and brought his son back to life. Later in life Pelops and his family line were cursed by Myrtilus, a son of Hermes, catalyzing the curse of the House of Atreus. Pelops had two children, Atreus and Thyestes, who are said to have killed their half-brother Chrysippus, and were therefore banished.

Thyestes and Aerope, Atreus&#x27; wife, were found out to be having an affair, and in an act of vengeance, Atreus murdered his brother&#x27;s sons, cooked them, and then fed them to Thyestes. Thyestes had a son with his daughter and named him Aegisthus, who went on to kill Atreus.

Atreus&#x27; children were Agamemnon, Menelaus, and Anaxibia. Leading up to here, we can see that the curse of the House of Atreus was one forged from murder, incest and deceit, and continued in this way for generations through the family line. To put it simply, the curse demands blood for blood, a never ending cycle of murder within the family.

Those who join the family seem to play a part in the curse as well, as seen in Clytemnestra when she murders her husband Agamemnon, in revenge for sacrificing their daughter, Iphigenia. Orestes, goaded by his sister Electra, murders Clytemnestra in order to exact revenge for her killing his father.

Orestes is said to be the end of the curse of the House of Atreus. The curse holds a major part in the &quot;Oresteia&quot; and is mentioned in it multiple times, showing that many of the characters are very aware of the curse&#x27;s existence. Aeschylus was able to use the curse in his play as an ideal formulation of tragedy in his writing.

== Contemporary background ==
Some scholars believe that the trilogy is influenced by contemporary political developments in Athens. A few years previously, legislation sponsored by the democratic reformer Ephialtes had stripped the court of the Areopagus, hitherto one of the most powerful vehicles of upper-class political power, of all of its functions except some minor religious duties and the authority to try homicide cases; By having his story being resolved by a judgement of the Areopagus, Aeschylus may be expressing his approval of this reform. It may also be significant that Aeschylus makes Agamemnon lord of Argos, where Homer puts his house, instead of his nearby capitol, Mycenae, since about this time Athens had entered into an alliance with Argos.

==Adaptations==
===Key British productions===
In 1981, Sir Peter Hall directed Tony Harrison&#x27;s adaptation of the trilogy in masks in London&#x27;s Royal National Theatre, with music by Harrison Birtwistle and stage design by Jocelyn Herbert. In 1999, Katie Mitchell followed him at the same venue (though in the Cottesloe Theatre, where Hall had directed in the Olivier Theatre) with a production which used Ted Hughes&#x27; translation. In 2015, Robert Icke&#x27;s production of his own adaptation was a sold out hit at the Almeida Theatre and was transferred that same year to the West End&#x27;s Trafalgar Studios. Two other productions happened in the UK that year, in Manchester and at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe.
The following year, in 2016, playwright Zinnie Harris premiered her adaptation, &quot;This Restless House&quot;, at the Citizen&#x27;s Theatre to five-star critical acclaim.

<text>A magnetic stirrer or magnetic mixer is a laboratory device that employs a rotating magnetic field to cause a stir bar (or &quot;flea&quot;) immersed in a liquid to spin very quickly, thus stirring it. The rotating field may be created either by a rotating magnet or a set of stationary electromagnets, placed beneath the vessel with the liquid. It is used in chemistry and biology as a convenient way to stir small volumes and where other forms of stirring, such as overhead stirrers and stirring rods, may not be viable.

== History ==

The first patent for a magnetic mixer is US 1,242,493, issued 9 October 1917 to Richard H. Stringham of Bountiful, Utah. Stringham&#x27;s mixer used stationary electromagnets in the base, rather than a rotating permanent magnet, to rotate the stirrer.

Arthur Rosinger of Newark, New Jersey obtained US Patent 2,350,534, titled Magnetic Stirrer on 6 June 1944, having filed an application on 5 October 1942. Rosinger&#x27;s patent includes a description of a coated bar magnet placed in a vessel, which is driven by a rotating magnet in a base below the vessel. Rosinger also explains in his patent that coating the magnet in plastic or covering it with glass or porcelain makes it chemically inert.

The plastic-coated bar magnet was independently invented in the late 1940s by Edward McLaughlin, of the Torpedo Experimental Establishment (TEE), Greenock, Scotland, who named it the &#x27;flea&#x27; because of the way it jumps about if the rotating magnet is driven too rapidly.

The first multi-point magnetic stirrer was developed and patented by Salvador Bonet of SBS Company in 1977. He also introduced the practice of noting the denomination of stirring power in &quot;litres of water&quot;, which is a market standard today.

== Design ==
A magnetic stirrer consists of a magnetic bar placed within the liquid which provides the stirring action. The stir bar&#x27;s motion is driven by another rotating magnet or assembly of electromagnets in the stirrer device, beneath the vessel containing the liquid. Stir bars are typically coated in PTFE, or, less often, in glass; the coatings are intended to be chemically inert, not contaminating or reacting with the reaction mixture they are in. Glass may be viable as an alternative if PTFE is unsuitable due to high temperature or chemical attack. In dissolving metal reductions that use an alkali metal dissolved in a primary amine, PTFE may be attacked to some extent. Birch reductions (a common dissolving metal reduction) are often conducted in a glass vessel, thus indicating that a glass stir bar would likewise be compatible. Glass can be attacked by strong alkali (such as lye) depending on heat, exposure time, and concentration.

Magnetic stirrers are bar-shaped and usually octagonal or circular in cross-section. A pointed oval shape is also common for use in round-bottom flasks. A variety of special shapes exist for more stable or efficient stirring in different conditions or to conform to the shape of small vessels. Many stir bars have a &quot;pivot ring&quot; around the center on which they rotate. The smallest are only a few millimeters long and the largest several centimeters. The smaller sizes (less than about 10mm) are often referred to as &quot;fleas&quot;.

Laboratory hot plates often serve a dual purpose by incorporating both the stirring assembly and a heating element. Such heating elements may range in power from a few hundred to a few thousand watts, and allow the reaction flask to be heated and stirred at the same time. The maximum reachable fluid temperature depends on the size of the flask, the quantity of solution to be heated, the power of the heating element, and amount of insulation provided to the system.

The magnetic material within bars is most commonly alnico or samarium cobalt, which can withstand high temperatures without loss of magnetic strength, although for low temperature applications neodymium can be used, and ferrite stir bars exist.

Because of its small size, a stirring bar is more easily cleaned and sterilized than other stirring devices. They do not require lubricants which could contaminate the reaction vessel and the product.

A &quot;stir bar retriever&quot; is a separate magnet on the end of a long stick (also coated with chemically inert PTFE) which can be used to remove stir bars from a vessel.

== Uses ==

Magnetic stirrers are often used in chemistry and biology, where they can be used to stir hermetically closed vessels or systems without the need for complicated rot
seals. They are preferred over gear-driven motorized stirrers because they are quieter, more efficient, and have no moving external parts to break or wear out (other than the simple bar magnet itself). Magnetic stir bars work well in glass vessels commonly used for chemical reactions, as glass does not appreciably affect a magnetic field.

The limited size of the bar means that magnetic stirrers can only be used for relatively small experiments, of 4 litres or less. Stir bars also have difficulty in dealing with viscous liquids or thick suspensions. For larger volumes or more viscous liquids, some sort of mechanical stirring (e.g., an overhead stirrer) is typically needed.

In synthetic chemistry, a combined magnetic stirrer/heater, equipped with a built-in temperature control mechanism and temperature probe, is commonly used with a heating bath (commonly oil, sand, or low-melting metal) or cooling bath (commonly water, ice, or an organic liquid mixed with liquid nitrogen or dry ice as coolant), allowing reactions vessels placed in the bath to be maintained at temperatures between approximately .

<text>Irene Lailin Sáez Conde (born 13 December 1961 in Chacao, Miranda, Venezuela) is a Venezuelan politician and beauty queen who was crowned Miss Universe 1981. She has been a model, was the mayor of Chacao (a municipality of Caracas), Governor of the state of Nueva Esparta and a former presidential candidate.

==Early life and education==
Irene Lailin Sáez Conde, was born and spent her childhood in Chacao, Miranda, (Venezuela). Her father, Carlos Sáez and her mother, Ligia Conde, died when Irene was three years old.

==Career==
===1981–1989: Pageant wins and early political roles ===
Early in her career, Sáez was named the Queen of Club Campestre Los Cortijos for three years in a row. Sáez was crowned Miss Venezuela 1981 and later, crowned Miss Universe 1981 at the 30th annual pageant in New York City at the age of 19. After spending a year traveling the world as Miss Universe, Sáez studied political science at the Central University of Venezuela, and then served a year as Venezuela&#x27;s cultural representative to the United Nations, expanding the international contacts developed into the realm of culture and diplomacy.

===1990–1997: Mayor of Chacao===
In the early 1990s, Sáez turned to electoral politics and a week after the November 1992 coup attempt, led by Hugo Chávez, she was elected mayor of Chacao Municipality, in Caracas. Unbeknownst to Sáez at the time, her political future would continue to be tied to Chávez&#x27;s rise in the country. In office as mayor of Chacao Municipality, Sáez tackled Chacao&#x27;s high crime rate by professionalising the municipal police force, with university graduates as officers, higher pay, new police vehicles, and a variety of mobility devices (including roller skates and mountain bikes) allowing the police to move around quicker. Crime fell dramatically as a result of her innovative ideas. Without political experience or an established party machine, Sáez was content to delegate to experts, and &quot;hired top-notch administrators and listened to their advice about everything from setting the budget to running public services.&quot;

In December 1995, Sáez was reelected as mayor of Chacao with 96% of the vote, the highest share of the vote in Venezuela&#x27;s democratic history. &quot;The Times&quot; of London ranked her 83rd in its list of the 100 most powerful women in the world.

In 1997, she was awarded the Distinguished Achievement Award at the Miss Universe Pageant, a recently created prize of the Miss Universe Organization. She made her acceptance speech in both English and Spanish. Sáez was received in the International Airport Simón Bolívar by former president of Venezuela, Luis Herrera Campins, and he gave her a chain of gold for her victory in Miss Universe.

===1998: Presidential campaign===
Sáez kept her distance from mainstream parties for as long as she could, and in 1997 formed the Integrated Representation of New Hope (IRENE) Party as a launch pad for her eventual run in the December 1998 presidential elections. In the final poll of the year in December 1997 she reached almost 70% support – just one year prior to the presidential elections.

Despite spending millions of dollars on publicity, Sáez fell below 15% within six months, as the public became increasingly skeptical of her readiness for the presidency and she lost credibility as an anti-establishment candidate after accepting the endorsement of COPEI, an invitation analysts now see as a political trap for a candidate ahead of her times.

Sáez won the internal COPEI primary election with 62.7% of the vote, against Eduardo Fernandez&#x27;s 35.7%, at a convention with 1,555 COPEI delegates taking place at a Caracas hotel, an endorsement earned after COPEI realized their original male candidate was unable to win. Its leaders ascertained their best bet to remain competitive nationally was to replace him with the charismatic yet independent Irene Sáez, transforming her into the first independent and female candidate supported by a major political party for the presidency of Venezuela.

Sáez was credited with bringing to national politics the voice of Venezuelans disenchanted with politics as usual, wrapped in the familiar sophistication of a global beauty queen with ties to the elite class. Because of her physical attractiveness and ability to speak, public newspapers like &quot;El Nacional&quot; described her television appearances as &quot;Reaganesque&quot;. To make herself more politically familiar, Sáez adopted Argentina&#x27;s Eva Perón&#x27;s hair style and fiery language of social revolution. Her speech preceded Hugo Chávez&#x27;s, as she was a presidential candidate for years before him. Sáez ran on a platform of ending corruption, reducing bureaucracy and refinancing public debt. Her campaign slogan was &quot;a revolution is possible&quot;.

COPEI&#x27;s former president, Rafael Caldera, pardoned Chávez for the attempted coup against Pérez, from the opposing Democratic Action party, making possible his eventual ascendance to power.

Ultimately she finished a distant third with 2.82% of the vote.

===1999–2000: Governor of Nueva Esparta and boards===
Soon after the 1998 presidential election, Sáez was elected Governor of the state of Nueva Esparta, in an election made necessary by the January 1999 death in office of Rafael Tovar. She won with more than 70% of the votes, defeating the candidate of Democratic Action. She served as governor of the state until 2000, stepping down when she became pregnant, denying rumors that she was pushed aside by Chávez. Since 2003, Sáez lives currently in Miami where she was named to the board of directors of the Colonial BancGroup, south Florida region.

<text>Fine Air was an international cargo airline that operated from 1989 to 2002, when it was renamed Arrow Air following its bankruptcy and acquisition. It operated Douglas DC-8 and Lockheed L-1011 type jets to destinations in Central America, South America and the Caribbean from Miami International Airport.

== History ==
J. Frank Fine founded the predecessor of Fine Air in 1976 as a leasing company which owned two Boeing 707 aircraft. Fine owned farming operations in twelve countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, and sought a reliable support system for third-party operators to ship his products to the United States. His company was certified as a Douglas DC-8 repair station in 1986 and received an air carrier operating certificate in November 1992; it began scheduled cargo service in 1994 as the largest international air cargo carrier at Miami International Airport (as measured by tons carried).

J. Frank Fine&#x27;s son Barry Fine became president in 1997, by which point the airline had a fleet of fifteen Douglas DC-8 aircraft. The airline was wholly owned by the two men for most of its existence.

Fine Air raised $123.5 million in an initial public offering on August 6, 1997, and planned to use the funds to purchase new aircraft and expand its cargo route network to Europe. It was listed on NASDAQ with the ticker code &quot;BIGF.&quot;

On August 7, 1997, the day after the IPO, Fine Air Flight 101, crashed shortly after takeoff from Miami International Airport. Fine Air cancelled its IPO the day after the crash, and returned the full amount of the capital raised to investors. It voluntarily grounded its fleet on September 5 as an alternative to having its license revoked by the FAA, but received government approval to resume operations in October 1997.

=== Arrow Air acquisition and bankruptcy ===

Fine attempted to acquire Southern Air Transport in July 1998 but abandoned the deal in August. In February 1999, Fine Air announced that it would acquire Arrow Air for $115 million in cash.

By 2000, Fine Air had around $200 million in annual revenue, more than 125 scheduled flights each week and a staff of more than 900 employees, handling 240,000 tons of cargo through its Miami hub in 1999.

Fine Air filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in September 2000 after a failed attempt to restructure $137 million in bond debt that had arisen due to the Arrow Air acquisition, citing fuel price increases and other financial issues beyond its control. A private investment group purchased Fine Air in 2002 and renamed it Arrow Air, removing the Fine family from control of the company. J. Frank Fine passed away in April 2003.

== Accidents and incidents ==

On August 7, 1997, the day after the IPO, Fine Air Flight 101, a DC-8-61F registration N27UA, crashed shortly after takeoff from Miami International Airport at 12:36 p.m.

The aircraft, bound for Santo Domingo, lost control shortly after V1. Upon rotation the cargo shifted aft on the main cargo deck because none of the pallet locks were engaged upright to the cargo pallets on the main deck. However, the NTSB report finds that &quot;A significant shift of cargo rearward at or before rotation did not occur and was not the cause of the initial extreme pitch up at rotation; although, cargo compression or shifting might have exacerbated the pitch-up moment as the pitch increased.&quot; The plane was loaded with two empty pallet positions that allowed for a significant shifting of the center of gravity aft toward the empty spaces. Ground crew interviews found that the flight was routinely full of pallets and the locks were rarely engaged in some opinions, and it was further stated this was because they were thought to be irrelevant if the pallets could not move. Pallets are held by rails at the sides from moving in an upward direction, but only the retractable end locks can stop forward and aft movement. The over-pitching on rotation at V1 pitched the aircraft nose up sharply to the point that air flow into the engines was significantly reduced (similar to blowing across the opening of a soda bottle to make it whistle from the drop in pressure) and causing the engines to stall. The plane then pitched back nose-down landing on its belly on the ground. In addition the aircraft was approximately overloaded, although given the pallet weighing process this was believed to be more common than thought beforehand. The pilots, departing from former Runway 27R (now 26L) attempted to recover but the stalled aircraft lacked any forward thrust rendering the control surfaces useless. The forward pitching aircraft rapidly lost forward momentum and lift with its wings cutting the airflow perpendicular to proper lift orientation. The DC-8 crashed on its belly on a field directly west of the end of the runway (about 300 yards) traveling in a straight line.

The DC-8 missed the auto transport loading facility at the south end of the Miami City Rail Yard just north of the end of the runway, and also busy cargo operations facilities along the very busy NW 25th Street feeder to the airport&#x27;s cargo area just to the south of the end of the runway. The aircraft barely missed two factories, a commercial building, and the Budweiser Distribution Center in unincorporated Miami, Florida between the populated residential suburbs of Miami Springs and Doral, FL. It skidded across the open field and onto NW 72nd Ave, a roadway that is typically full of traffic during the lunch hour but was surprisingly quiet at 12:36p EST when it came down. The plane&#x27;s wreckage skidded quickly across the roadway and onto the parking lot of a commercial mini-mall across the street from the empty field; it took out 26 cars in the lot. At that time the mini-mall was a hub of computer parts distributors specializing in South American commerce.

The plane&#x27;s wreckage fell short of the entrances to three shops. It missed two occupied cars and a truck that were waiting for the traffic signal at the intersection of NW 31st Street and NW 72nd Avenue, less than away. Inside one of the cars in the parking lot sat a man who had just arrived back at his shop in the mini-mall after picking up lunch for his wife and himself. He was unable to make it out of the car and was caught up in the fireball that engulfed the multi-lane avenue, field and parking lot. The plane roughly ended up at 25.801826, -80.313439.

Five people died in total: the three aircrew members, a company security guard on the flight, and one man in the parking lot. In the minutes following the crash, police were alerted to a fire at NW 72nd Ave, only to discover it was a plane crash. For nearly 45 minutes, mixed reports claimed the plane was a passenger flight, but within the hour the control tower at MIA confirmed it was Fine Air Cargo Flight 101. FAA Security Special Agents working out of an office on airport property (at that time) responded to the scene and simultaneously to the Fine Air Cargo offices where they took possession of the flight documentation. Some relevant documentations were recovered from garbage receptacles causing a criminal investigation to be opened and ultimately leading to charges including destruction and covering up of evidence. Fine Air and their ground handling agent Aeromar Airlines pled guilty to several of the charges and were fined approximately $5 million.

<text>The Beat Generation was a literary subculture movement started by a group of authors whose work explored and influenced American culture and politics in the post-World War II era. The bulk of their work was published and popularized by members of the Silent Generation in the 1950s, better known as Beatniks. The central elements of Beat culture are the rejection of standard narrative values, making a spiritual quest, the exploration of American and Eastern religions, the rejection of economic materialism, explicit portrayals of the human condition, experimentation with psychedelic drugs, and sexual liberation and exploration.

Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s &quot;Howl&quot; (1956), William S. Burroughs&#x27; &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; (1959), and Jack Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;On the Road&quot; (1957) are among the best-known examples of Beat literature. Both &quot;Howl&quot; and &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; were the focus of obscenity trials that ultimately helped to liberalize publishing in the United States. The members of the Beat Generation developed a reputation as new bohemian hedonists, who celebrated non-conformity and spontaneous creativity.

The core group of Beat Generation authors—Herbert Huncke, Ginsberg, Burroughs, Lucien Carr, and Kerouac—met in 1944 in and around the Columbia University campus in New York City. Later, in the mid-1950s, the central figures, except Burroughs and Carr, ended up together in San Francisco, where they met and became friends of figures associated with the San Francisco Renaissance.

In the 1950s, a Beatnik subculture formed around the literary movement, although this was often viewed critically by major authors of the Beat movement. In the 1960s, elements of the expanding Beat movement were incorporated into the hippie and larger counterculture movements. Neal Cassady, as the driver for Ken Kesey&#x27;s bus &quot;Furthur&quot;, was the primary bridge between these two generations. Ginsberg&#x27;s work also became an integral element of early 1960s hippie culture, in which he actively participated. The hippie culture was practiced primarily by older members of the following generation.

== Etymology ==
Although Kerouac introduced the phrase &quot;Beat Generation&quot; in 1948 to characterize a perceived underground, anti-conformist youth movement in New York, fellow poet Herbert Huncke is credited with first using the word &quot;beat&quot;. The name arose in a conversation with writer John Clellon Holmes. Kerouac allows that it was Huncke, a street hustler, who originally used the phrase &quot;beat&quot;, in an earlier discussion with him. The adjective &quot;beat&quot; could colloquially mean &quot;tired&quot; or &quot;beaten down&quot; within the African-American community of the period and had developed out of the image &quot;beat to his socks&quot;, but Kerouac expanded on the meaning to include the connotations &quot;upbeat&quot;, &quot;beatific&quot;, and the musical association of being &quot;on the beat&quot;, and &quot;the Beat to keep&quot; from the &quot;Beat Generation&quot; poem.

== Significant places ==
=== Columbia University ===
The origins of the Beat Generation can be traced to Columbia University and the meeting of Kerouac, Ginsberg, Carr, Hal Chase and others. Kerouac attended Columbia on a football scholarship. Though the beats are usually regarded as anti-academic, many of their ideas were formed in response to professors like Lionel Trilling and Mark Van Doren. Classmates Carr and Ginsberg discussed the need for a &quot;New Vision&quot; (a term borrowed from W. B. Yeats), to counteract what they perceived as their teachers&#x27; conservative, formalistic literary ideals.

=== Times Square &quot;underworld&quot; ===

Ginsberg was arrested in 1949. The police attempted to stop Jack Melody (a.k.a. &quot;little Jack&quot;) while he was driving a car in Queens with Priscella Arminger (alias, Vickie Russell or &quot;Detroit Redhead&quot;) and Allen Ginsberg in the back seat. The car was filled with stolen items Little Jack planned to fence. Jack Melody crashed while trying to flee, rolled the car and the three of them escaped on foot. Allen Ginsberg lost his glasses in the accident and left incriminating notebooks behind. He was given the option to plead insanity to avoid a jail term and was committed for 90 days to Bellevue Hospital, where he met Carl Solomon.

Solomon was arguably more eccentric than psychotic. A fan of Antonin Artaud, he indulged in self-consciously &quot;crazy&quot; behavior, like throwing potato salad at a college lecturer on Dadaism. Solomon was given shock treatments at Bellevue; this became one of the main themes of Ginsberg&#x27;s &quot;Howl&quot;, which was dedicated to Solomon. Solomon later became the publishing contact who agreed to publish Burroughs&#x27; first novel, &quot;Junkie&quot;, in 1953.

=== Greenwich Village ===
Beat writers and artists flocked to Greenwich Village in New York City in the late 1950s because of low rent and the &quot;small town&quot; element of the scene. Folksongs, readings and discussions often took place in Washington Square Park. Allen Ginsberg was a big part of the scene in the Village, as was Burroughs, who lived at 69 Bedford Street.

Burroughs, Ginsberg, Kerouac, and other poets frequented many bars in the area, including the San Remo Cafe at 93 MacDougal Street on the northwest corner of Bleecker, Chumley&#x27;s, and Minetta Tavern. Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, and other abstract expressionists were also frequent visitors of and collaborators with the Beats. Cultural critics have written about the transition of Beat culture in the Village into the Bohemian hippie culture of the 1960s.

In 1960, a presidential election year, the Beats formed a political party, the &quot;Beat Party,&quot; and held a mock nominating convention to announce a presidential candidate: the African-American street poet Big Brown, won a majority of votes on the first ballot but fell short of the eventual nomination. The Associated Press reported, &quot;Big Brown&#x27;s lead startled the convention. Big, as the husky African American is called by his friends, wasn&#x27;t the favorite son of any delegation, but he had one tactic that earned him votes. In a chatterbox convention, only once did he speak at length, and that was to read his poetry.&quot;

=== San Francisco and the Six Gallery reading ===

Ginsberg had visited Neal and Carolyn Cassady in San Jose, California in 1954 and moved to San Francisco in August. He fell in love with Peter Orlovsky at the end of 1954 and began writing &quot;Howl&quot;. Lawrence Ferlinghetti, of the new City Lights Bookstore, started to publish the City Lights Pocket Poets Series in 1955.

Kenneth Rexroth&#x27;s apartment became a Friday night literary salon (Ginsberg&#x27;s mentor William Carlos Williams, an old friend of Rexroth, had given him an introductory letter). When asked by Wally Hedrick To organize the Six Gallery reading, Ginsberg wanted Rexroth to serve as master of ceremonies, in a sense to bridge generations.

Philip Lamantia, Michael McClure, Philip Whalen, Ginsberg and Gary Snyder read on October 7, 1955, before 100 people (including Kerouac, up from Mexico City). Lamantia read poems of his late friend John Hoffman. At his first public reading, Ginsberg performed the just finished first part of &quot;Howl&quot;. It was a success and the evening led to many more readings by the now locally famous Six Gallery poets.

It was also a marker of the beginning of the Beat movement since the 1956 publication of &quot;Howl&quot; (&quot;City Lights Pocket Poets&quot;, no. 4), and its obscenity trial in 1957 brought it to nationwide attention.

The Six Gallery reading informs the second chapter of Kerouac&#x27;s 1958 novel &quot;The Dharma Bums,&quot; whose chief protagonist is &quot;Japhy Ryder&quot;, a character who is based on Gary Snyder. Kerouac was impressed with Snyder and they were close for several years. In the spring of 1955, they lived together in Snyder&#x27;s cabin in Mill Valley, California. Most Beats were urbanites and they found Snyder almost exotic, with his rural background and wilderness experience, as well as his education in cultural anthropology and Oriental languages. Lawrence Ferlinghetti called him &quot;the Thoreau of the Beat Generation.&quot;

As documented in the conclusion of &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot;, Snyder moved to Japan in 1955, in large measure to intensively practice and study Zen Buddhism. He would spend most of the next 10 years there. Buddhism is one of the primary subjects of &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot;, and the book undoubtedly helped to popularize Buddhism in the West and remains one of Kerouac&#x27;s most widely read books.

=== Pacific Northwest ===
The Beats also spent time in the Northern Pacific Northwest including Washington and Oregon. Kerouac wrote about sojourns to Washington&#x27;s North Cascades in &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot; and &quot;On the Road&quot;.

Reed College in Portland, Oregon was also a locale for some of the Beat poets. Gary Snyder studied anthropology there, Philip Whalen attended Reed, and Allen Ginsberg held multiple readings on the campus around 1955 and 1956. Gary Snyder and Philip Whalen were students in Reed&#x27;s calligraphy class taught by Lloyd J. Reynolds.

== Significant figures ==

Burroughs was introduced to the group by David Kammerer. Carr had befriended Ginsberg and introduced him to Kammerer and Burroughs. Carr also knew Kerouac&#x27;s girlfriend Edie Parker, through whom Burroughs met Kerouac in 1944.

On August 13, 1944, Carr killed Kammerer with a Boy Scout knife in Riverside Park in what he claimed later was self-defense. He dumped the body in the Hudson River, later seeking advice from Burroughs, who suggested he turn himself in. He then went to Kerouac, who helped him dispose of the weapon.

Carr turned himself in the following morning and later pleaded guilty to manslaughter. Kerouac was charged as an accessory, and Burroughs as a material witness, but neither were prosecuted. Kerouac wrote about this incident twice in his works: once in his first novel, &quot;The Town and the City&quot;, and again in one of his last, &quot;Vanity of Duluoz&quot;. He wrote a collaboration novel with Burroughs, &quot;And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks&quot;, concerning the murder.

== Participants ==
=== Women ===
Beat Generation women who have been published include Edie Parker; Joyce Johnson; Carolyn Cassady; Hettie Jones; Joanne Kyger; Harriet Sohmers Zwerling; Diane DiPrima; Bonnie Bremser; Lenore Kandel; Elise Cowen; and Ruth Weiss, who also made films. Carolyn Cassady wrote her detailed account of life with her husband Neal Cassady which also included details about her affair with Jack Kerouac. She titled it &quot;Off the Road&quot;, and it was published in 1990. Poet Elise Cowen took her own life in 1963. Poet Anne Waldman was less influenced by the Beats than by Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s later turn to Buddhism. Later, female poets emerged who claimed to be strongly influenced by the Beats, including Janine Pommy Vega in the 1960s, Patti Smith in the 1970s, and Hedwig Gorski in the 1980s.

=== African Americans ===
Although African Americans were not widely represented in the Beat Generation, the presence of some black writers in this movement did contribute to the movement&#x27;s progression. While many of the Beats briefly discussed issues of race and sexuality, they spoke from their perspectives—most being white. However, black people added a counterbalance to this; their work supplied readers with alternative views of occurrences in the world. Beats like the poet Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Kaufman and the writer LeRoi Jones (Amiri Baraka) provide through their work distinctly Black perspectives on the movement. Kaufman wrote about a number of his experiences with the racist institutions of the time. Following his time in the military, he had trouble with police officers and the criminal justice system. Like many of the Beats, Kaufman was also a fan of jazz and incorporated it into his work to describe relationships with others. LeRoi Jones (Amiri Baraka) married Beat writer, Hettie Cohen, who became Hettie Jones, in 1958. Together with Diane di Prima, they worked to develop &quot;Yūgen&quot; magazine, named for the Japanese concept of yūgen. Mr. and Mrs. Jones were associated with several Beats (Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and Gregory Corso). That is, until the assassination of the Civil Rights leader, Malcolm X. During this time, LeRoi Jones branched off from the other Beat writers, including his wife, to find his identity among the African-American and Islamic communities. The change in his social setting along with awakening influenced his writing and brought about the development of many of his most notable works, like &quot;Somebody Blew Up America&quot;, in which he reflected on the attacks of 9/11 and America&#x27;s reaction to this incident about other occurrences in America.

== Culture and influences ==
=== Sexuality ===
One of the key beliefs and practices of the Beat Generation was free love and sexual liberation, which strayed from the Christian ideals of American culture at the time. Some Beat writers were openly gay or bisexual, including two of the most prominent (Ginsberg and Burroughs). However, the first novel does show Cassady as frankly promiscuous. Kerouac&#x27;s novels feature an interracial love affair (&quot;The Subterraneans&quot;), and group sex (&quot;The Dharma Bums&quot;). The relationships among men in Kerouac&#x27;s novels are predominately homosocial.

=== Drug use ===
The original members of the Beat Generation used several different drugs, including alcohol, marijuana, benzedrine, morphine, and later psychedelic drugs such as peyote, ayahuasca, and LSD. They often approached drugs experimentally, initially being unfamiliar with their effects. Their drug use was broadly inspired by intellectual interest, and many Beat writers thought that their drug experiences enhanced creativity, insight, or productivity. The use of drugs was a key influence on many of the social events of the time that were personal to the Beat generation.

=== Romanticism ===
Gregory Corso considered English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley a hero, and he was buried at the foot of Shelley&#x27;s grave in the Protestant Cemetery, Rome. Ginsberg mentions Shelley&#x27;s poem &quot;Adonais&quot; at the beginning of his poem &quot;Kaddish,&quot; and cites it as a major influence on the composition of one of his most important poems. Michael McClure compared Ginsberg&#x27;s &quot;Howl&quot; to Shelley&#x27;s breakthrough poem &quot;Queen Mab.&quot;

Ginsberg&#x27;s main Romantic influence was William Blake, and studied him throughout his life. Blake was the subject of Ginsberg&#x27;s self-defining auditory hallucination and revelation in 1948. Romantic poet John Keats was also cited as an influence.

=== Jazz ===
Writers of the Beat Generation were heavily influenced by jazz artists like Billie Holiday and the stories told through Jazz music. Writers like Jack Kerouac (&quot;On the Road&quot;), Bob Kaufman (&quot;Round About Midnight,&quot; &quot;Jazz Chick,&quot; and &quot;O-Jazz-O&quot;), and Frank O&#x27;Hara (&quot;The Day Lady Died&quot;) incorporated the emotions they felt toward jazz. They used their pieces to discuss feelings, people, and objects they associate with jazz music, as well as life experiences that reminded them of this style of music. Kaufman&#x27;s pieces listed above &quot;were intended to be freely improvisational when read with Jazz accompaniment&quot; (Charters 327). He and other writers found inspiration in this genre and allowed it to help fuel the Beat movement.

=== Early American sources ===
The Beats were inspired by early American figures such as Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Herman Melville and especially Walt Whitman, who is addressed as the subject of one of Ginsberg&#x27;s most famous poems, &quot;A Supermarket in California&quot;. Edgar Allan Poe was occasionally acknowledged, and Ginsberg saw Emily Dickinson as having an influence on Beat poetry. The 1926 novel &quot;You Can&#x27;t Win&quot; by outlaw author Jack Black was cited as having a strong influence on Burroughs.

=== French surrealism ===
In many ways, Surrealism was still considered a vital movement in the 1950s. Carl Solomon introduced the work of French author Antonin Artaud to Ginsberg, and the poetry of André Breton had direct influence on Ginsberg&#x27;s poem &quot;Kaddish.&quot; Rexroth, Ferlinghetti, John Ashbery and Ron Padgett translated French poetry. Second-generation Beat Ted Joans was named &quot;the only Afro-American Surrealist&quot; by Breton.

Philip Lamantia introduced Surrealist poetry to the original Beats. The poetry of Gregory Corso and Bob Kaufman shows the influence of Surrealist poetry with its dream-like images and its random juxtaposition of dissociated images, and this influence can also be seen in more subtle ways in Ginsberg&#x27;s poetry. As the legend goes, when meeting French Surrealist Marcel Duchamp, Ginsberg kissed his shoe and Corso cut off his tie. Other influential French poets for the Beats were Guillaume Apollinaire, Arthur Rimbaud and Charles Baudelaire.

=== Modernism ===
Gertrude Stein was the subject of a book-length study by Lew Welch. Admitted influences for Kerouac include Marcel Proust, Ernest Hemingway and Thomas Wolfe.

=== Buddhism and Daoism ===
Gary Snyder defined wild as &quot;whose order has grown from within and is maintained by the force of consensus and custom rather than explicit legislation&quot;. &quot;The wild is not brute savagery, but a healthy balance, a self-regulating system.&quot;. Snyder attributed wild to Buddhism and Daoism, the interests of some Beats. &quot;Snyder&#x27;s synthesis uses Buddhist thought to encourage American social activism, relying on both the concept of impermanence and the classically American imperative toward freedom.&quot;

== Topics ==
 While many authors claim to be directly influenced by the Beats, the Beat Generation phenomenon itself has had an influence on American culture leading more broadly to the hippie movements of the 1960s.
In 1982, Ginsberg published a summary of &quot;the essential effects&quot; of the Beat Generation:
* Spiritual liberation, sexual &quot;revolution&quot; or &quot;liberation,&quot; i.e., gay liberation, somewhat catalyzing women&#x27;s liberation, black liberation, and Gray Panthers activism.
* Liberation of the world from censorship.
* Demystification and/or decriminalization of cannabis and other drugs.
* The evolution of rhythm and blues into rock and roll as a high art form, as evidenced by the Beatles, Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin, and other popular musicians influenced in the later fifties and sixties by Beat generation poets and writers&#x27; works.
* The spread of ecological consciousness, emphasized early by Gary Snyder, Jack Loeffler, and Michael McClure, the notion of a &quot;Fresh Planet.&quot;
* Opposition to the military-industrial machine civilization, as emphasized in the writings of Burroughs, Huncke, Ginsberg, and Kerouac.
* Attention to what Kerouac called (after Spengler) a &quot;second religiousness&quot; developing within an advanced civilization.
* Return to an appreciation of idiosyncrasy vs. state regimentation.
* Respect for land and indigenous peoples and creatures, as proclaimed by Kerouac in his slogan from &quot;On the Road&quot;: &quot;The Earth is an Indian thing.&quot;
=== &quot;Beatniks&quot; ===

The term &quot;beatnik&quot; was coined by Herb Caen of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; on April 2, 1958, blending the name of the recent Russian satellite Sputnik and Beat Generation. This suggested that beatniks were (1) &quot;far out of the mainstream of society&quot; and (2) &quot;possibly pro-Communist.&quot; Caen&#x27;s term stuck and became the popular label associated with a new stereotype—the man with a goatee and beret reciting nonsensical poetry and playing bongo drums while women wearing black leotards dance.

An early example of the &quot;beatnik stereotype&quot; occurred in Vesuvio&#x27;s (a bar in North Beach, San Francisco) which employed the artist Wally Hedrick to sit in the window dressed in full beard, turtleneck, and sandals, creating improvisational drawings and paintings. By 1958 tourists who came to San Francisco could take bus tours to view the North Beach Beat scene, prophetically anticipating similar tours of the Haight-Ashbury district ten years later.

A variety of other small businesses also sprang up exploiting (and/or satirizing) the new craze. In 1959, Fred McDarrah started a &quot;Rent-a-Beatnik&quot; service in New York, taking out ads in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; and sending Ted Joans and friends out on calls to read poetry.

&quot;Beatniks&quot; appeared in many cartoons, movies, and TV shows of the time, perhaps the most famous being the character Maynard G. Krebs in &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot; (1959–1963).

While some of the original Beats embraced the beatniks, or at least found the parodies humorous (Ginsberg, for example, appreciated the parody in the comic strip &quot;Pogo&quot;) others criticized the beatniks as inauthentic poseurs. Jack Kerouac feared that the spiritual aspect of his message had been lost and that many were using the Beat Generation as an excuse to be senselessly wild.

=== &quot;Hippies&quot; ===

During the 1960s, aspects of the Beat movement metamorphosed into the counterculture of the 1960s, accompanied by a shift in terminology from &quot;beatnik&quot; to &quot;hippie&quot;. Many of the original Beats remained active participants, notably Allen Ginsberg, who became a fixture of the anti-war movement. Notably, however, Jack Kerouac broke with Ginsberg and criticized the 1960s politically radical protest movements as an excuse to be &quot;spiteful&quot;.

There were stylistic differences between beatniks and hippies—somber colors, dark sunglasses, and goatees gave way to colorful psychedelic clothing and long hair. The Beats were known for &quot;playing it cool&quot; (keeping a low profile).

Beyond style, there were changes in substance. The Beats tended to be essentially apolitical, but the hippies became actively engaged with the civil rights movement and the anti-war movement.

=== Literary legacy ===
Among the emerging novelists of the 1960s and 1970s, a few were closely connected with Beat writers, most notably Ken Kesey (&quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;). Though they had no direct connection, other writers considered the Beats to be a major influence, including Thomas Pynchon (&quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;) and Tom Robbins (&quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot;).

William S. Burroughs is considered a forefather of postmodern literature; he also inspired the cyberpunk genre.

One-time Beat writer LeRoi Jones/Amiri Baraka helped initiate the Black Arts Movement.

As there was a focus on live performance among the Beats, many slam poets have claimed to be influenced by the Beats. Saul Williams, for example, cites Allen Ginsberg, Amiri Baraka, and Bob Kaufman as major influences.

The Postbeat Poets are direct descendants of the Beat Generation. Their association with or tutelage under Ginsberg at The Naropa University&#x27;s Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics and later at Brooklyn College stressed the social-activist legacy of the Beats and created its own body of literature. Known authors are Anne Waldman, Antler, Andy Clausen, David Cope, Eileen Myles, Eliot Katz, Paul Beatty, Sapphire, Lesléa Newman, Jim Cohn, Thomas R. Peters Jr. (poet and owner of beat book shop), Sharon Mesmer, Randy Roark, Josh Smith, and David Evans.

=== Rock and pop music ===
The Beats had a pervasive influence on rock and roll and popular music, including the Beatles, Bob Dylan and Jim Morrison. The Beatles spelled their name with an &quot;a&quot; partly as a Beat Generation reference, and John Lennon was a fan of Jack Kerouac. The Beatles even put Beat writer William S. Burroughs on the cover of their album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band.&quot;

Ginsberg was a close friend of Bob Dylan and toured with him on the Rolling Thunder Revue in 1975. Dylan cites Ginsberg and other Beats as major influences.

Jim Morrison cites Kerouac as one of his biggest influences, and fellow Doors member Ray Manzarek has said &quot;We wanted to &quot;be&quot; beatniks.&quot; In his book &quot;Light My Fire: My Life with The Doors&quot;, Manzarek also writes &quot;I suppose if Jack Kerouac had never written &quot;On the Road&quot;, The Doors would never have existed.&quot; Michael McClure was also a friend of members of The Doors, at one point touring with Manzarek.

Ginsberg was a friend of Ken Kesey&#x27;s Merry Pranksters, a group of which Neal Cassady was a member, which also included members of the Grateful Dead. In the 1970s, Burroughs was a friend of Mick Jagger, Lou Reed, David Bowie, and Patti Smith.

The musical group Steely Dan is named after a steam-powered dildo in Burroughs&#x27; &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;. British progressive rock band Soft Machine is named after Burroughs&#x27; novel &quot;The Soft Machine&quot;.

Singer-songwriter Tom Waits, a Beat fan, wrote &quot;Jack and Neal&quot; about Kerouac and Cassady, and recorded &quot;On the Road&quot; (a song written by Kerouac after finishing the novel) with Primus. He later collaborated with Burroughs on the theatrical work &quot;The Black Rider&quot;.

Jazz musician/film composer Robert Kraft wrote and released a contemporary homage to Beat Generation aesthetics entitled &quot;Beat Generation&quot; on the 1988 album &quot;Quake City&quot;.

Musician Mark Sandman, who was the bass guitarist, lead vocalist, and a former member of the alternative jazz rock band Morphine, was interested in the Beat Generation and wrote a song called &quot;Kerouac&quot; as a tribute to Jack Kerouac and his philosophy and way of life.

The band Aztec Two-Step recorded &quot;The Persecution &amp; Restoration of Dean Moriarty (On the Road)&quot; in 1972.

There was a resurgence of interest in the beats among bands in the 1980s. Ginsberg worked with the Clash and Burroughs worked with Sonic Youth, R.E.M., Kurt Cobain, and Ministry, among others. Bono of U2 cites Burroughs as a major influence, and Burroughs appeared briefly in a U2 video in 1997. Post-punk band Joy Division named a song &quot;Interzone&quot; after a collection of stories by Burroughs. Laurie Anderson featured Burroughs on her 1984 album &quot;Mister Heartbreak&quot; and in her 1986 concert film, &quot;Home of the Brave.&quot; The band King Crimson produced the album &quot;Beat&quot; inspired by the Beat Generation.

More recently, American artist Lana Del Rey references the Beat movement and Beat poetry in her 2014 song &quot;Brooklyn Baby&quot;.

In 2021, rapper R.A.P. Ferreria released the album &quot;Bob&#x27;s Son: R.A.P. Ferreira in the Garden Level Cafe of the Scallops Hotel&quot;, named for Bob Kaufman and containing many references to the work of Kaufman, Jack Kerouac, Amiri Baraka, and other beat poets. 

== Criticism ==
The Beat Generation was met with scrutiny and assigned many stereotypes. Several magazines, including &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Playboy,&quot; depicted members of the Beat Generation as nihilists and as unintellectual. This criticism was largely due to the ideological differences between American culture at the time and the Beat Generation, including their Buddhist-inspired beliefs.

Norman Podhoretz, a student at Columbia with Kerouac and Ginsberg, later became a critic of the Beats. His 1958 &quot;Partisan Review&quot; article &quot;The Know-Nothing Bohemians&quot; was a vehement critique primarily of Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;On the Road&quot; and &quot;The Subterraneans,&quot; as well as Ginsberg&#x27;s &quot;Howl&quot;. His central criticism is that the Beat&#x27;s embrace of spontaneity is bound up in an anti-intellectual worship of the &quot;primitive&quot; that can easily turn toward mindlessness and violence. Podhoretz asserted that there was a link between the Beats and criminal delinquents.

Ginsberg responded in a 1958 interview with &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, specifically addressing the charge that the Beats destroyed &quot;the distinction between life and literature&quot;. In the interview, he stated that &quot;the bit about anti-intellectualism is a piece of vanity, we had the same education, went to the same school, you know there are &#x27;Intellectuals&#x27; and there are intellectuals. Podhoretz is just out of touch with twentieth-century literature, he&#x27;s writing for the eighteenth-century mind. We have a personal literature now—Proust, Wolfe, Faulkner, Joyce.&quot;

=== Internal criticism ===
In a 1974 interview, Gary Snyder comments on the subject of &quot;casualties&quot; of the Beat Generation:

Kerouac was a casualty too. And there were many other casualties that most people have never heard of, but were genuine casualties. Just as, in the 60s, when Allen and I for a period there were almost publicly recommending people to take acid. When I look back on that now I realize there were many casualties, and responsibilities to bear.

When the Beats initially set out to &quot;construct&quot; new communities that shirked conformity and traditionalism, they invoked the symbols of the most marginalized ethnic identities of their time. As the reality set in, of racial self-identity lost within the communal constructs of their own making, most of the Beat writers altered their message drastically to acknowledge the social impulse to marginalize the self in the conflict between isolationism and absorption of self by communal instincts seeking belonging. They began to deeply engage with new themes such as the place of the white man in America and declining patriarchal institutions.
