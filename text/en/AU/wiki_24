<text>Mourning Becomes Electra is a play cycle written by American playwright Eugene O&#x27;Neill. The play premiered on Broadway at the Guild Theatre on 26 October 1931 where it ran for 150 performances before closing in March 1932, starring Lee Baker (Ezra), Earle Larimore (Orin), Alice Brady (Lavinia) and Alla Nazimova (Christine). In May 1932, it was unsuccessfully revived at the Alvin Theatre (now the Neil Simon Theatre) with Thurston Hall (Ezra), Walter Abel (Orin), Judith Anderson (Lavinia) and Florence Reed (Christine), and, in 1972, at the Circle in the Square Theatre, with Donald Davis (Ezra), Stephen McHattie (Orin), Pamela Payton-Wright (Lavinia), and Colleen Dewhurst (Christine).

The story is a retelling of the &quot;Oresteia&quot; by Aeschylus. The characters parallel characters from the ancient Greek plays. For example, Agamemnon from the &quot;Oresteia&quot; becomes General Ezra Mannon. Clytemnestra becomes Christine, Orestes becomes Orin, Electra becomes Lavinia, Aegisthus becomes Adam Brant, etc. As a Greek tragedy made modern, the play features murder, adultery, incestuous love, and revenge, as well as a group of townspeople who function as a kind of Greek chorus. Although fate alone guides characters&#x27; actions in Greek tragedies, O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s characters also have motivations grounded in 1930s-era psychological theory. The play can easily be read from a Freudian perspective, paying attention to various characters&#x27; Oedipus complexes and Electra complexes.

&quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot; is divided into three plays with themes that correspond to the &quot;Oresteia&quot; trilogy. Much like the Aeschylus plays &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, &quot;The Libation Bearers&quot;, and &quot;The Eumenides&quot;, these three plays by O&#x27;Neill are correspondingly titled &quot;Homecoming&quot;, &quot;The Hunted&quot;, and &quot;The Haunted&quot;, respectively. These plays are normally not produced individually, however, but only as part of the larger trilogy. Each play contains four to five acts, with only the first act of &quot;The Haunted&quot; being divided into actual scenes. Thus, &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot; is extraordinarily lengthy. In many productions, the length is cut for the sake of practicality, and the chorus of townsfolk cut from productions due to the expense, leaving only the eight main players.

==Plot==
;&quot;Homecoming&quot;
Act I
It is late spring in front of the Mannon house. The master of the house, Brigadier-General Ezra Mannon, is soon to return from the Civil War. Lavinia, Ezra&#x27;s daughter, like her mother Christine, has just returned from a trip to New York. Seth, the gardener, takes Lavinia aside. He warns her against her would-be beau, Captain Brant. Before Seth can continue, Lavinia&#x27;s friend Peter Niles and his sister, Hazel, arrive. If Peter is proposing marriage to Lavinia again, he must realize she cannot marry anyone because her father needs her. Seth asks Lavinia if she has noticed that Brant resembles members of the Mannon family. Seth believes Brant is the child of David Mannon (Ezra&#x27;s uncle, who later hanged himself) and Marie Brantôme (a French Canadian nurse), a couple expelled from the house due to fear of scandal and public disgrace.

Suddenly Brant himself enters from the drive. Calculatingly, Lavinia derides the memory of Brant&#x27;s mother, who died of starvation as Ezra never replied to a message she sent for help. Brant explodes and reveals his heritage. He tells Lavinia that her own grandfather (Ezra&#x27;s father) also craved his mother and thus cast David out of the family. Brant has sworn vengeance.

Act II
Lavinia appears inside her father&#x27;s study. Christine enters indignantly, wondering why Lavinia has summoned her. Lavinia reveals that she followed her to New York and saw her kissing Adam Brant. Christine defiantly tells Lavinia that she has long hated Ezra and that Lavinia was born of her disgust for him. She loves Lavinia&#x27;s brother Orin because he always seemed to be hers alone, and never Ezra&#x27;s. Lavinia says that she will keep her mother&#x27;s adultery a secret for Ezra&#x27;s sake but Christine must promise to never see Brant again. Christine accuses her daughter of wanting Brant for herself. Christine then appears to agree to Lavinia&#x27;s terms but proposes to Brant that they poison Ezra and attribute his death to his heart trouble.

Act III
One week later, Lavinia stands at the top of the front stairs with Christine waiting for Ezra. When he arrives, Lavinia rushes forward and embraces him. Once Ezra is alone with his wife, he impulsively kisses her hand. The war has made him realize that they must put aside their differences. Christine agrees. They kiss and, for the first time in many years, share a bed.

Act IV
Toward daybreak in Ezra&#x27;s bedroom, Christine slips out. Ezra, waking, bitterly rebukes her. He believes Christine awaits his death. Later, she deliberately taunts him that she is Brant&#x27;s mistress. Ezra rises in fury, threatening to kill her but falls back, clutching his heart and begging for his medicine. Christine gives him poison instead. After taking it, Ezra realizes her treachery and calls out to Lavinia. Lavinia rushes into the room. With his dying breath, Ezra indicts his wife: &quot;She&#x27;s guilty — not medicine!&quot;, he gasps, and then dies. Christine collapses in a faint, and Lavinia falls to her knees in anguish.

;&quot;The Hunted&quot;
Act I
Peter, Lavinia, and Orin arrive at the house. Orin complains of his mother&#x27;s absence. He jealously asks Lavinia about Christine and Brant. Lavinia warns him against believing their mother to be innocent of an affair. Suddenly, Christine appears and embraces her son jubilantly.

Act II
Orin asks his mother about Brant. Christine explains that Lavinia has gone mad. Orin sits at Christine&#x27;s feet and recounts his wonderful dreams about the two of them in the South Sea Islands. The islands represent everything the war was not: peace, warmth, and security, or Christine herself. Lavinia reappears in the room and coldly calls Orin to view their father&#x27;s body.

Act III
In the study, Orin tells Lavinia that Christine has already warned him of her madness. Lavinia insists that Orin certainly cannot let their mother&#x27;s lover escape. She proposes that they watch Christine until she goes to meet Brant as this should convince Orin of her treachery. Orin agrees.

Act IV
The night after Ezra&#x27;s funeral, Brant&#x27;s clipper ship appears at a wharf in East Boston. Christine sneaks out to meet Brant on the deck, and they retire to the cabin. Lavinia and an enraged Orin (who followed their mother from the house) listen from the deck. Brant and Christine decide to flee east and seek out their Blessed Islands. they painfully bid each other farewell. When Brant returns, Orin shoots him and ransacks the room to make it seem that Brant has been robbed.

Act V
The following night Christine paces the drive before the Mannon house. Orin and Lavinia appear, revealing that they killed Brant. Christine collapses. Orin kneels beside her promising he will make her happy, that they can leave Lavinia at home and go abroad together. Lavinia orders Orin into the house. He obeys. Lavinia tells her mother she can still live. Christine glares at her daughter then enters the house. Lavinia remains outside. A gunshot is heard from Ezra&#x27;s study. Lavinia stammers: &quot;It is justice!&quot;

;&quot;The Haunted&quot;
Act I, scene 1
A year later, Lavinia and Orin return from their trip abroad. Lavinia now resembles her mother, even wearing a green dress like the one her mother was wearing at the start of the play. Orin has grown dreadfully thin and bears the statue-like attitude of his father.

Act I, scene 2
In the sitting room, Orin grimly remarks that Lavinia has stolen Christine&#x27;s soul. Peter enters from the rear and gasps, thinking he has seen Christine&#x27;s ghost. Lavinia approaches him eagerly. Orin jealously mocks his sister&#x27;s warmth toward Peter, accusing her of becoming a true romantic during their time in the South Seas.

Act II
A month later, Orin is working intently at a manuscript in the Mannon study. Lavinia enters and asks what he is doing. Orin says they must atone for their mother&#x27;s death. As the last male Mannon, he has written a history of the family crimes. He then observes that Lavinia only became pretty like their mother on the islands they visited. Orin angrily accuses her of sleeping with one of the men on that island and Lavinia assumes Christine&#x27;s taunting voice. Reacting like Ezra, Orin grasps her throat, threatening to kill her. It becomes apparent that Orin has taken Ezra&#x27;s place as Lavinia has taken Christine&#x27;s.

Act III
A moment later, the scene switches to Hazel and Peter in the sitting room. Orin enters, insisting that he see Hazel alone. He gives her a sealed envelope, warning her to keep it away from Lavinia. She should only open it, (a) if something happens to him, or (b) if Lavinia tries to marry Peter. Lavinia enters from the hall. Hazel tries to keep Orin&#x27;s envelope hidden behind her back, but Lavinia rushes to Orin, beseeching him to let her see it. After Lavinia says she loves him, and agrees to do whatever he wants, Orin gives her the envelope. Orin then tells Hazel to leave.

Orin forbids Lavinia from ever seeing Peter again. He tells her he loves her. Lavinia stares at him in horror, saying, &quot;For God&#x27;s sake—! No! You&#x27;re insane! You can&#x27;t mean—!&quot; Lavinia wishes his death. Startled, Orin realizes that his death would be another act of justice. He thinks Christine is speaking through Lavinia.

Peter appears in the doorway in the midst of the argument. Orin remarks that he was about to go clean his pistol and exits. Lavinia throws herself into Peter&#x27;s arms. A muffled shot is heard, as Orin commits suicide in the other room.

Act IV
Three days later, Lavinia appears dressed in deep mourning. A resolute Hazel arrives and insists that Lavinia not marry Peter. Hazel admits she has told Peter of Orin&#x27;s envelope. Peter arrives, and he and Lavinia pledge their love anew. Surprised by the bitterness in his voice, Lavinia desperately flings herself into his arms crying, &quot;Take me, Adam!&quot; Then, horrified, she breaks off their engagement and sends Peter away. 

She realizes she is forever bound to the Mannon dead. As there is no one left to punish her, she must punish herself. She decides to live alone in the old house with the ghosts of her ancestors. She orders Seth to board up the windows and throw out all the flowers – then she enters the dark house alone and shuts the door.

== Adaptations ==
In 1947 the play was adapted for film by Dudley Nichols, starring Rosalind Russell, Michael Redgrave, Raymond Massey, Katina Paxinou, Leo Genn and Kirk Douglas. It was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Michael Redgrave) and Best Actress in a Leading Role (Rosalind Russell).

In 1967, the Metropolitan Opera gave the world premiere of an operatic version, composed by Marvin David Levy to the libretto of William Henry Butler. Both film and opera retain O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s title.

In 1978, a five-hour television miniseries was produced for and shown on PBS&#x27; &quot;Great Performances&quot;, which starred Bruce Davison, Roberta Maxwell and Joan Hackett. It was well received by the critics, with Hackett, in particular, being highly praised for her portrayal of Christine.

In 2010 was adapted in India in the Malayalam language as Elektra (2010 film)

== Themes ==
There are literary readings that classify &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot; in the naturalism movement. This is based on O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s focus on violent emotional states of men to emphasize the subconscious and inner spiritual forces as well as man&#x27;s inability to escape the cyclical pattern and outcomes of human action. Like the Oresteia, the play explored the theme of revenge, where the crime of the past determines the actions and the suffering of the protagonist in the present. For this theme, some observers note that O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s approach is more similar to William Shakespeare&#x27;s outlook in Hamlet than Aeschylus&#x27; in Oresteia. 

O&#x27;Neill also differed from Aeschylus on the theme of fate and the role of the gods in the lives of men. In Oresteia, as was the case in the classical Greek tragedies, the divine is part of the environmental forces that humans cannot control but determine their fate. In O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s interpretation, these forces are eliminated in favor of Freudian and Jungian psychology.

<doc id="149806" wikidata="Q14396011" url="?curid=149806" title="Life with Father">
<text>Life with Father is a 1939 play by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, adapted from a humorous autobiographical book of stories compiled in 1935 by Clarence Day. The Broadway production ran for 3,224 performances over 401 weeks to become the longest-running non-musical play on Broadway, a record that it still holds. The play was adapted into a 1947 feature film and a television series.

==Book==
Clarence Day wrote humorously about his family and life. The stories of his father Clarence &quot;Clare&quot; Day were first printed in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. They portray a rambunctious, overburdened Wall Street broker who demands that everything from his family should be just so. The more he rails against his staff, his cook, his wife, his horse, salesmen, holidays, his children and the inability of the world to live up to his impossible standards, the more comical and lovable he becomes to his own family who love him despite it all. First published in 1936, shortly after his death, Day&#x27;s book is a picture of New York upper-middle-class family life in the 1890s. The stories are filled with affectionate irony. Day&#x27;s understated, matter-of-fact style underlines the comedy in everyday situations.

==Production==

The 1939 Broadway production ran for over seven years to become the longest-running non-musical play on Broadway, a record that it still holds. It also held the title of the longest running Broadway play of any type of all time from 1947 to 1972. It opened at the Empire Theatre on November 8, 1939 and ran at that theatre until September 8, 1945. It then moved to the Bijou Theatre where it ran until June 15, 1947, and finished its run at the Alvin Theatre on July 12, 1947 for a combined total of 3,224 performances. The play was produced by Oscar Serlin, staged by Bretaigne Windust, with setting and costumes by Stewart Chaney. It starred Howard Lindsay, his wife Dorothy Stickney, and Teresa Wright.

===Cast===

*Katherine Bard as Annie 
*Dorothy Stickney as Lavinia &quot;Vinnie&quot; Day
*John Drew Devereaux as Clarence Day, Jr.
*Richard Simon as John Day
*Raymond Roe as Whitney Day
*Larry Robinson as Harlan Day
*Howard Lindsay as Father (Clarence &quot;Clare&quot; Day, Sr.)
*Dorothy Bernard as Margaret
*Ruth Hammond as Cora
*Teresa Wright as Mary Skinner
*Richard Sterling as the Reverend Dr. Lloyd
*Portia Morrow as Delia
*Nellie Burt as Nora
*A.H. Van Buren as Dr. Humphreys
*John C. King as Dr. Somers
*Timothy Kearse as Maggie
== Subsequent productions ==
Concurrent with the Broadway production, the producers sent out 11 touring companies that performed in 214 cities. The amateur rights to &quot;Life with Father&quot; were released in 1948, and the following year saw 187 productions of the play, including a production at Theatre in the Round Players that included consultation with Warner films on staging. 

In 1953, The Ford 50th Anniversary Show, broadcast live on both the CBS and NBC television networks, opened with Oscar Hammerstein II introducing a scene from the play featuring original cast members Howard Lindsay and Dorothy Stickney. The Ford show attracted an audience of 60 million viewers. Forty years after the broadcast, television critic Tom Shales recalled the broadcast as both &quot;a landmark in television&quot; and &quot;a milestone in the cultural life of the &#x27;50s&quot;.

The only major New York revival occurred in 1967 in a limited run at City Center, starring Leon Ames and Dorothy Stickney. Critic Vincent Canby called the revival &quot;a quaint, pretty picture postcard.&quot; Although professional revivals are now rare, &quot;Life with Father&quot; continues to be produced by amateur companies such as the American Century Theatre in Virginia (2009) and the Victorian Players in Ohio (2014).

==Critical reception==
The &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Brooks Atkinson wrote in his review &quot;Sooner or later every one will have to see &quot;Life with Father&quot;, which opened at the Empire last evening. For the late Clarence Day&#x27;s vastly amusing sketches of his despotic parent have now been translated into a perfect comedy by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, and must be reckoned an authentic port [sic] of our American folklore.&quot; When &quot;Life with Father&quot; surpassed &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; as the longest-running Broadway play, Elliot Norton of the &quot;Boston Post&quot; celebrated the play as &quot;warmly human and heartily comical and completely inoffensive,&quot; thus restoring his faith in the theatre-going public. Contemporary scholar Jordan Schildcrout describes &quot;Life with Father&quot; as &quot;a comedy in which characters challenge and ultimately win over a figure of authority,&quot; which allows the play to appeal to nostalgia for more conservative times, while also finding pleasure in gentle subversion and anti-authoritarianism.

==Adaptations==

&quot;Life with Father&quot; was adapted for the November 6, 1938, broadcast of CBS Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot;. The cast included Orson Welles (Father), Mildred Natwick (Mother), Mary Wickes (Employment Office Manager), Alice Frost (Margaret) and Arthur Anderson (young Clarence Day).

The theatrical adaptation of &quot;Life With Father&quot; was made into a film in 1947, directed by Michael Curtiz and starring William Powell and Irene Dunne as Clarence and his wife, supported by Elizabeth Taylor, Edmund Gwenn, ZaSu Pitts, Jimmy Lydon and Martin Milner. Six years later, the film was adapted into a television series, starring Leon Ames and Lurene Tuttle, which ran from November 1953 until July 1955 on the CBS Television network. The series was the first live color program for network TV to originate in Hollywood. The film (not the series) and its audio entered the public domain in 1975.

<text>Lewis Frederick Ayres III (December 28, 1908 – December 30, 1996) was an American actor whose film and television career spanned 65 years. He is best known for starring as German soldier Paul Bäumer in the film &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1930) and for playing Dr. Kildare in nine films. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in &quot;Johnny Belinda&quot; (1948).

==Early life and career==
Ayres was born in Minneapolis to Irma Bevernick and Louis Ayres, who divorced when he was four. Louis, an amateur musician and court reporter, remarried soon afterwards.

As a teen, he and his mother moved with his step-father, William Gilmore, and half brother and sister to San Diego, California.

Leaving high school before graduating, he started a small band which traveled to Mexico. He returned months later to pursue an acting career, but continued working full-time as a musician. He played banjo and guitar for big bands, including the Henry Halstead Orchestra. He recorded one of the earliest Vitaphone movie shorts called &quot;Carnival Night in Paris&quot; (Warner Brothers, 1927).

Ayres wrote, &quot;I was a member of Henry Halstead&#x27;s orchestra in 1927 at the Mission Beach Ballroom in San Diego, California for the summer. My instruments were tenor banjo, long-neck banjo and guitar. After a hiatus, I rejoined Mr. Halstead with a new group, including Phil Harris, on New Year&#x27;s Eve the same year for the opening night of the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, a memorable occasion.&quot;

He left a national tour to pursue a career as an actor full-time.

==Career==
Ayres was discovered at a nightclub by talent agent Ivan Kahn. He was cast to play opposite Greta Garbo in &quot;The Kiss&quot; (1929), but it was his leading role in the original version of &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1930) that made him a star, secured him a contract with Universal—and made him a conscientious objector to World War II.

He made a number of mostly forgotten B movies for Universal, with the exception of &quot;Iron Man&quot; (1931), with Jean Harlow. His most successful movies at this time were those he made on loan to other studios, including &quot;The Doorway to Hell&quot; (1930) with James Cagney in a supporting role, and as Janet Gaynor&#x27;s leading man in both &quot;State Fair&quot; (1933) and &quot;Servants&#x27; Entrance&quot; (1934), which featured a combination of live action and Walt Disney animation in a musical dream sequence, both for Fox Films.

Ayres left Universal to sign with Fox Films. In 1934, Fox listed him as one of its second tier stars.

He moved to poverty row studio Republic Pictures to pursue a second career as a director, including the film &quot;Hearts in Bondage&quot; (1936), starring James Dunn and Mae Clarke. He moved to Paramount Pictures before finally being signed to MGM in 1938. At this time, he was loaned from Paramount to play the role of Ned in &quot;Holiday&quot; (1938).

The role earned him considerable critical attention, including interest from MGM to put him under contract specifically for the role of Dr. James Kildare in an upcoming film series. Ayres played the role in nine films from 1938 to 1942 (and again in a 1950s radio series) while also appearing in light comedies for MGM, including &quot;Spring Madness&quot; and &quot;Rich Man, Poor Girl&quot; (both 1938), &quot;The Ice Follies of 1939&quot; (1939), and &quot;Fingers at the Window&quot; (1942). His final film as Dr. Kildare, &quot;Born to Be Bad&quot;, was re-edited after he was drafted and declared himself a conscientious objector in March 1942.

He returned to acting in the films &quot;The Dark Mirror&quot; (1946) with Olivia de Havilland and &quot;The Unfaithful&quot; (1947) with Ann Sheridan. For his role in &quot;Johnny Belinda&quot; (1948) he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor; co-star Jane Wyman won for Best Actress.

Ayres gradually moved to television, appearing in several anthology series in guest roles. In the summer of 1958, he hosted eleven original episodes of a CBS Western anthology television series called &quot;Frontier Justice&quot;, a production of Dick Powell&#x27;s Four Star Television. He was offered the part of Dr. Kildare in an NBC series but his prescient request that the show have no cigarette advertising led to the offer being withdrawn. (In 1961, the part went to Richard Chamberlain.) He appeared (as the vice-president) in &quot;Advise &amp; Consent&quot; (1962), and in &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; (1964), but he was, by then, primarily a television actor, with only occasional film work.

For a guest role in &quot;Kung Fu&quot; (&quot;The Vanishing Image&quot;, 1974) he was nominated for an Emmy.

His documentary film &quot;Altars of the World&quot; (1976), based on a series of documentaries he made titled &quot;Altars of the East&quot; (1956), brought his Eastern philosophical beliefs to the screen and earned him critical acclaim and a Golden Globe Award for best documentary in 1977.

Ayres guest-starred in an episode of &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; (&quot;Doomsday is Tomorrow&quot;, 1977) as Dr. Elijah Cooper, an elderly nuclear scientist who attempts to blackmail the world into peace. In 1973 he played a similar role on Hawaii Five-O as a nuclear Scientist who in a twist ending ends up dying of radiation from his own bomb.

In 1985, he was cast in his first series as a regular cast member, as the father of Robert Wagner in the short-lived series &quot;Lime Street.&quot; His last role was in the made-for-TV film &quot;Hart to Hart: Crimes of the Heart&quot; (1994), also starring Wagner.

===World War II conscientious objector and medic===
In March 1942, Ayres was identified as a 4E conscientious objector and sent to a CO camp. As expected, the announcement that a Hollywood actor objected to the war was a major source of public outcry and debate.

Within a month it was determined that he had initially requested to be A-O-1, so that he could serve as a non-combat medic. However, the military&#x27;s policy that servicemen cannot request, or be guaranteed, where they will serve, forced him to request a 4E status. The U.S. military confirmed that they would place him as a medic and in April 1942, his status was changed. He enlisted in the United States Army on May 18, 1942.

He served as a first aid instructor in the United States Army before requesting a drop in rank in order to serve as a medic and chaplain&#x27;s assistant in the Pacific. He was one of 16 medics who arrived under fire during the invasion of Leyte to set up evacuation hospitals, and there he provided care to soldiers and civilians in the Philippines and New Guinea. He donated all the money he had earned as a serviceman to the American Red Cross.

Serving for three and a half years in the Medical Corps, he was awarded three battle stars. After the war, he resumed his career and made scores of movies, but never reached the peak of his early Hollywood stardom.

==Personal life==
Ayres was married three times. First to actress Lola Lane from 1931 until 1933, although they were separated much of that period. He met actress Ginger Rogers while starring in the film &quot;Don&#x27;t Bet on Love&quot; in 1933 and they wed in 1934. They separated in 1936 and divorced in March 1940. His third marriage, to Diana Hall, lasted from 1964 until his death in 1996. Their son Justin was born in 1968.

Ayres was a strict vegetarian.

==Death and legacy==
In 1960, Lew Ayres was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with two stars. His motion pictures star is located at 6385 Hollywood Boulevard while his radio star is located at 1724 Vine Street.

Ayres died on December 30, 1996, two days after his 88th birthday. His body was buried under a simple headstone at Westwood Memorial Park in Westwood, Los Angeles.

<text>Serj Tankian ( , ; born August 21, 1967) is an Armenian-American musician and activist. He is best known as the lead vocalist of the alternative metal band System of a Down, which was formed in 1994.

Tankian has released five albums with System of a Down (&quot;System of a Down&quot;, &quot;Toxicity&quot;, &quot;Steal This Album!&quot;, &quot;Mezmerize&quot;, &quot;Hypnotize&quot;) and five solo albums (&quot;Elect the Dead&quot;, &quot;Imperfect Harmonies&quot;, &quot;Harakiri&quot;, &quot;Orca&quot;, and &quot;Elasticity&quot;), as well as collaborating with musicians such as rapper Tech N9ne and folk singer Arto Tunçboyacıyan. He also released &quot;Elect the Dead Symphony&quot;, a live orchestral version of &quot;Elect the Dead&quot; featuring the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra. He is the founder of the record label Serjical Strike Records, and is currently represented by Velvet Hammer Music and Management Group.

Tankian is regarded as one of the best vocalists in heavy metal, with praise given to his unusual delivery and his wide vocal range. In 2006, he was ranked No. 26 on the &quot;Hit Parader&quot; list of &quot;Top 100 Heavy Metal Vocalists&quot;. A study conducted by VVN Music found that Tankian possesses a high and diverse vocal range of 4.2 octaves. 

In 2002, Tankian co-founded the non-profit political activism organization Axis of Justice, alongside guitarist and fellow activist Tom Morello. In 2011, he was awarded the Armenian Prime Minister&#x27;s Medal for his contributions to the recognition of the Armenian genocide and the advancement of music.

==Early life==
Serj Tankian was born in Beirut, Lebanon, on August 21, 1967 to Armenian parents Khachadour and Alice Tankian. He traces his ancestry to the cities of Dörtyol, Kayseri, Tokat, and Urfa, all of which are in modern-day Turkey. His four grandparents were survivors of the Armenian genocide. Amid the Lebanese Civil War, at the age of 7, he moved to the U.S. with his parents, and the family settled in Los Angeles. In his youth, he attended the bilingual Rose and Alex Pilibos Armenian School, which was also attended by his future System of a Down bandmates Daron Malakian and Shavo Odadjian. Tankian was accepted into California State University, Northridge, graduating with a marketing degree in 1989. During his sophomore year, he first began to play instruments, particularly the keyboard, and write songs.

In an interview in 2021, Tankian stated; &quot;I was very lost. I was playing music at home, but I didn&#x27;t have a band, I didn&#x27;t have any connection, and my vision hadn&#x27;t interpreted that this was my future yet. I was like, probably 22, 23 when I was really, when I discovered it... I was driving home, I had a Jeep Wrangler, I remember it was raining, very dramatic, and I really, I always say I have to go to the far reaches of who I don&#x27;t wanna be to admit to myself who I really am. And I was in my car, and I literally stopped, and I just go, &quot;I want to fuckin&#x27; do music. This is bullshit. I don&#x27;t want to do all this shit.&quot; And that was the day that changed my life. From then on, anything I did was with the idea that I&#x27;m going on this path, and I gotta do whatever I gotta do to be on this path.&quot;

During his college years, Tankian began participing in political activism, attempting to draw attention to the recognition of the Armenian genocide during his time as president of the university&#x27;s Armenian Students Association. He has said that his activism started with the Armenian Youth Federation (AYF) and the Shant Student Association of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF).

==Career==
===System of a Down (1994–present)===
The beginnings of System of a Down lie in a band named Soil (not to be confused with the Chicago-based band SOiL) with Tankian on vocals &amp; keyboards, Malakian on vocals &amp; lead guitar, Dave Hakopyan on bass, and Domingo Laranio on drums. The band initially hired Odadjian as their manager before he was to transition into their rhythm guitarist.
Laranio and Hakopyan later left the band feeling that it was not going anywhere, leading to Soil splitting up.

After the split, Tankian, Odadjian and Malakian formed System of a Down, named after a poem Malakian wrote called &quot;Victims of a Down&quot;. The band recruited drummer Ontronik &quot;Andy&quot; Khachaturian, an old school friend of Malakian, and Odadjian who had played with Malakian in a band called Snowblind during their teens. In mid-1997, Khachaturian left the band because of a hand injury (he subsequently co-founded The Apex Theory, which included former Soil bassist Dave Hakopyan). Khachaturian was replaced by John Dolmayan. Dolmayan is also the drummer for the band Indicator and former drummer for Scars on Broadway.

The band began touring the Southern California rock clubs, building a strong following.

The band achieved commercial success with the release of five studio albums, three of which debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. System of a Down has been nominated for four Grammy Awards, and their song &quot;B.Y.O.B.&quot; won the Best Hard Rock Performance of 2006. In May the same year, the band announced they were going on hiatus.

On November 29, 2010, following several weeks of internet rumors, System of a Down officially announced that they would play shows in Europe during Festivals and in North America, mostly in the U.S., embarking on a tour for the following three years.

The band was in limbo of not releasing any new tracks until November 2020, when they released &quot;Protect the Land&quot; and &quot;Genocidal Humanoidz&quot;, which were songs that were made to help the cause of the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War. The song&#x27;s profits went to the Armenia Fund.

In the following years, System of a Down increasingly limited their live appearances. On May 14, 2023, the band hosted their only live performance of the year as co-headliners of the Sick New World festival in Las Vegas. In 2024, the band performed two gigs, making headline appearances at Sick New World on April 27, and at a standalone concert (together with Deftones) at the Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, the first-ever ticketed live event to take place at the venue.

===&quot;Elect the Dead&quot;, side projects, and guest appearances (2007–2009)===
Tankian&#x27;s breakthrough as a solo artist came with the release of his debut record &quot;Elect the Dead&quot;. The first singles from &quot;Elect the Dead&quot; are &quot;The Unthinking Majority&quot; and &quot;Empty Walls&quot;. The music video &quot;Feed Us&quot; was released on the Swedish and UK MTV. A music video was directed and filmed for every song on the record, each by unique directors. Tankian explained, &quot;I asked each of the directors for their visual interpretation of my work. They were asked not to write treatments and that they could make whatever they liked. The results have been overwhelmingly amazing!&quot;

Three different promo versions of the album have surfaced to the public. The instrumental promotional version, issued by Serjical Strike/Reprise Records and intended for the music and movie industry, contains instrumental versions of the twelve album tracks. Another promotional version, issued by Reprise Records and made only for individual reviewers, features the album in final master form. This promotional CD-R, which was labeled &quot;Smart Talk&quot; as a codename for &quot;Serj Tankian&quot; to prevent leaking by unauthorized persons, also indicates that the album was finalized prior to .

The official tour for &quot;Elect the Dead&quot; commenced on October 12, 2007, with a show at Chicago&#x27;s Vic Theatre. Roughly one thousand people attended the first concert. Although Tankian had stated he would not be performing any material by System of a Down, he performed &quot;Charades&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, songs co-written by Daron Malakian, the guitarist of the band. &quot;Blue&quot; had previously appeared on their Fourth Demo Tape in 1998, and Charades was attempted during the 2005 &quot;Mezmerize&quot;/&quot;Hypnotize&quot; sessions, but never released (although a short video clip of Tankian and Dolmayan playing the song in a recording studio was featured on &quot;the Making of &quot;Mezmerize&quot;/&quot;Hypnotize&quot;&quot;). Although it is originally a song restricted to piano and vocals, Tankian used his backing band, the Flying Cunts of Chaos (F.C.C.).

Tankian is also politically involved. Together with Tom Morello, he founded the organization Axis of Justice and often speaks publicly against violence and injustice in the world. Tankian released a new song &quot;Fears&quot; in November 2008 exclusively in support of Amnesty International&#x27;s Global Write-A-Thon.

In 2009, Tankian collaborated with the band Viza (previously known as Visa) for their track &quot;Viktor&quot;.

=== &quot;Imperfect Harmonies&quot; (2010) ===
Tankian&#x27;s second solo album was originally due in 2009. It is said to be more of a jazz and orchestral based sound. Tankian said of the second album: The album had the working title &quot;Music Without Borders&quot;, however, the final album title is &quot;Imperfect Harmonies&quot;. On June 23, 2010, a promo single from his upcoming album &quot;Imperfect Harmonies&quot; was released called &quot;Borders Are&quot;. The first radio single from&quot; Imperfect Harmonies&quot;, &quot;Left of Center&quot;, was released on July 13, 2010. A third single, &quot;Disowned Inc.&quot; was released on August 9, 2010. &quot;Imperfect Harmonies&quot; was released on September 21, 2010. Preceding the album&#x27;s release, two contests were announced (one consisting of brainteasers related to the album/song titles, the other an art contest) in which fans could win prizes such as Tankian&#x27;s autograph and merchandise. On August 22, 2010, a music video for &quot;Left of Center&quot; was released on Tankian&#x27;s MySpace account.
The premiere date for Tankian and Sater&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; at the American Repertory Theater was February 25, 2011. Tankian said that collaborating on the show has been a great learning experience for him. &quot;I&#x27;ve been using a lot of my archives, a lot of different types of music that I had already put together for underscoring and what not,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#x27;s quite diverse, from noise to jazz to electronic stuff to hip-hop songs to rock songs to cool, piano dark underscores, and that&#x27;s a whole different bag of tricks there because it&#x27;s always evolving. Unlike a film score that&#x27;s very linear and you get a scene to score for, this is something where you do another workshop and one song is gone, that underscore changes to 20 seconds and they need something else on the spot. Everything&#x27;s always changing until the show comes, so it&#x27;s quite interesting.&quot;

In January 2011, Tankian released a music video for his song &quot;Reconstructive Demonstrations&quot; from his album &quot;Imperfect Harmonies&quot;. Tankian also announced on his Facebook page, during the video&#x27;s release, that an EP titled &quot;Imperfect Remixes&quot; would be released sometime within 2011. On March 1, Tankian released &quot;Imperfect Remixes&quot; and the music video for &quot;Goodbye&quot;, a remix of &quot;Gate 21&quot; from &quot;Imperfect Harmonies&quot;.

Tankian co-wrote a musical with the American playwright Steven Sater. It is based on the Ancient Greek tragedy &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;. It opened at the American Repertory Theater on March 14, 2011.

===&quot;Harakiri&quot; (2012), &quot;Orca&quot; (2013), and &quot;Jazz-iz-Christ&quot; (2013)===

In early July 2011, Tankian posted a video on YouTube showing two samples of new songs. During the video he said &quot;next year&quot;. In multiple interviews he has stated that he has been working on a rock record that will be released in 2011, and some side projects including jazz, electronic, and symphonic records. It was later confirmed that his third album would be called &quot;Harakiri&quot; and will be released on July 10, 2012. In 2012, he planned for this to be the first of four new albums. The first single from &quot;Harakiri&quot;, &quot;Figure It Out&quot;, was released on May 1. A music video for the song appeared on Tankian&#x27;s official YouTube page. A second single from the album, &quot;Cornucopia&quot;, was released on June 10. A third single, title track &quot;Harakiri&quot;, was made available as a preorder bonus from Tankian&#x27;s website on June 20.

On August 12, 2011, Tankian traveled to Armenia, where he was received at Government House by then-Prime Minister Tigran Sargsyan, who awarded him with a Commemorative Medal () for his &quot;contribution to the recognition of the Armenian Genocide and the advancement of music&quot;. Tankian promised to return and put on a concert to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, which he did on April 24, 2015, playing for free for over two hours in Yerevan&#x27;s Republic Square.

He released his fourth studio album &quot;Orca Symphony No. 1&quot; on June 25, 2013. The album takes the form of a classical symphony. A professionally sampled studio version was released on November 30, 2012, while the live recorded version was released on June 25, 2013, through Serjical Strike Records.

His fifth studio album &quot;Jazz-Iz-Christ&quot; was released on July 23, 2013, by Serjical Strike Records. The release features Tankian&#x27;s vocals on only four of the 15 tracks; all others are instrumental, except for &quot;End of Time&quot;, which features a female vocalist. In 2014, he collaborated with Italian DJ Benny Benassi for the single &quot;Shooting Helicopters&quot;.

On April 9, 2013, Tankian collaborated with Device, a project led by Disturbed frontman David Draiman. He had a guest appearance on the song &quot;Out of Line&quot; on Device&#x27;s self-titled album.
Tankian also appeared on the Tech N9ne album &quot;Something Else&quot; in 2013 on the song &quot;Straight Out the Gate&quot;.

=== Film and television scores (2017–2022) ===
He was a surprise guest performer for the Game of Thrones Live Concert Experience in Los Angeles on March 25, 2017, singing &quot;The Rains of Castamere&quot;. His rendition of the song also made it onto the soundtrack for the eighth season of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; in 2019.

In June and July 2017, he was a guest on multiple shows of the Prophets of Rage during System of a Down&#x27;s European tour, singing &quot;Like a Stone&quot; in memory of his friend, Audioslave&#x27;s Chris Cornell.

In November 2017, Swedish independent label Woah Dad! acquired the albums that Tankian recorded for Reprise Records.

Tankian composed music for &quot;I Am Not Alone&quot;, a 2019 documentary film about the 2018 Armenian revolution. He was also an executive producer of the film.

Tankian composed the music for the second season of the Netflix series &quot;Down to Earth with Zac Efron&quot;.

==== &quot;Fuktronic&quot; (2020) ====
&quot;Fuktronic&quot;, an electronic music collaboration with Mindless Self Indulgence&#x27;s Jimmy Urine was released in May 2020, after the duo released a sample on SoundCloud. &quot;Fuktronic&quot; is described as &quot;the team of Serj Tankian and Jimmy Urine from Mindless Self Indulgence, making a soundtrack for the ultimate British Gangster Film. It&#x27;s an electronic album with 12 tracks (4 instrumental and 8 tracks that have original scripted dialogue that portrays the trials and tribulations of a fresh out of prison British gangster who hasn&#x27;t learned his lesson).&quot;

==== &quot;Elasticity&quot; (2021) ====
Tankian released his first ever EP titled &quot;Elasticity&quot; on March 19, 2021. He announced the release of his EP, and released the title track &quot;Elasticity&quot;, along with a music video for it, on February 5, 2021. In his announcement, Tankian stated &quot;When I conceived possibly doing another record with the guys from System of a Down a few years back, I started working on a set of songs that I arranged in rock format for that purpose, As we weren&#x27;t able to see eye to eye on the vision going forward with a SOAD album, I decided to release these songs under my moniker.&quot; The EP features songs like &quot;Electric Yerevan&quot;, which is described as a &quot;rallying cry&quot; for Armenia, &quot;Rumi&quot;, a poetic song about Tankian&#x27;s son, and &quot;Your Mom&quot;, which has been described as a &quot;political mash-up&quot;.

==== &quot;Perplex Cities&quot; (2022) ====
Tankian released his second EP titled &quot;Perplex Cities&quot; on October 21, 2022.

=== &quot;Down With The System&quot; and new solo projects (2023–present) ===
In October 2023, Tankian announced that he would release his first memoir, &quot;Down With the System&quot;, on May 14, 2024 via Hachette Books; the artist wrote on X, &quot;I had a blast working on this accidentally hatched philosophical memoir, as it&#x27;s given me the unique opportunity to deep dive into my family history, my own motivations from a young age and lessons I didn&#x27;t know I had learned&quot;.

In April 2024, during an interview with &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; in promotion of &quot;Down With the System&quot;, Tankian announced that he would release a new solo EP, titled &quot;Foundations&quot;, in September of the same year; he also revealed that he had originally written one of the songs included in the project for System of a Down, while two other tracks had been recorded during the studio sessions for his 2007 solo album &quot;Elect the Dead.&quot; The first single from the EP, &quot;A.F. Day&quot;, was released on May 17 of the same year.

==Influences==
Tankian grew up listening to traditional Armenian music in his exiled community in Lebanon and sang it with his father Khatchadour Tankian. He discovered pop music only once his family moved to Los Angeles in the 1970s via the Bee Gees&#x27; soundtrack to &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, that led him to delve into it. In his 20s, he bought every record by the Beatles, whom he has called the most &quot;universal&quot; artists he is aware of. Tankian said that the first hard rock album that left an impact on him was 1992&#x27;s &quot;Angel Dust&quot; by Faith No More. When System of a Down toured with Faith No More singer Mike Patton, who at the time fronted his other band Mr. Bungle on the 2000 SnoCore Tour, Tankian said that both vocalists &quot;had some of the most interesting conversations&quot; of his life. Besides the experimental vocals of Patton, Tankian is greatly influenced by Frank Zappa, especially by his albums &quot;Sheik Yerbouti&quot; and &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot;.

Tankian holds in high regard the soundtrack of &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; by Ennio Morricone, and the albums &quot;Decoy&quot; by Miles Davis and &quot;…And Justice for All&quot; by Metallica. He also much admires the reinvention that the British band Radiohead went through in their 2000 record &quot;Kid A&quot;, saying that it serves as an example to other artists.

==Views and activism==
Tankian is passionate about human rights, recognition of genocides, and social justice. These traits have helped to shape his lyrical style. He has organized and participated in many protests, from Armenian genocide recognition to Axis of Justice (AOJ) protests held by him and AOJ co-founder Tom Morello. He also covers current issues in his music. In his music, issues like the War on Terror, overpopulation, genocide, environmentalism, and the American prison system are addressed. He and his System of a Down bandmates were featured in the 2006 documentary film &quot;Screamers&quot;, which covers the United States&#x27; position on genocide. In the film, Tankian interviews his grandfather, Stepan Haytayan, a survivor of the Armenian genocide, who recounts his experience of it.

===Views on religion===
Tankian said in an interview that he has &quot;the same religion as that tree over there&quot;. He said, &quot;It&#x27;s a mix of Native American, Christian, Buddhist, and Transcendental ideas. I like to think of Earth as mother. I like to think of sky as grandfather. God has been used for ulterior motives&quot;. In another interview, he said, &quot;I believe very firmly that indigenous populations had a really good, intuitive understanding of why we&#x27;re here. And we&#x27;re trying to gain that same understanding through psychology and intellect in modern civilization&quot;.

===Political views===
Following the September 11 attacks, Tankian wrote an essay in which he stated, &quot;If we carry out bombings on Afghanistan or elsewhere to appease public demand, and very likely kill innocent civilians along the way, we&#x27;d be creating many more martyrs going to their deaths in retaliation against the retaliation. As shown from yesterday&#x27;s events, you cannot stop a person who&#x27;s ready to die&quot;.

In the 2008 Democratic Party primaries, Tankian originally supported Dennis Kucinich, but subsequently stated that Barack Obama &quot;presents the best possible scenario for a hopeful future, but I don&#x27;t personally put my trust in any political office&quot;. In the 2016 Democratic Party primaries, he endorsed Bernie Sanders and wrote on Facebook, &quot;When it comes to standing up to the oligarchs, leading the fight for civil rights, income-equality, and so much more, no other politician has been so consistent and incorruptible as Bernie Sanders&quot;. He further praised Sanders, &quot;He&#x27;s said what he&#x27;s done and he&#x27;d done what he says in the Senate. All his contributions are from private individuals; everyone else&#x27;s are from major donors and corporations. It does not take a genius to see who&#x27;s working for whom here&quot;.

Concerning the Syrian Civil War, Tankian advocates negotiating with Bashar al-Assad, letting Iran deal with Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), whom he accused Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey of supporting.

Tankian has stated he supported Bernie Sanders&#x27;s bid during the 2020 US Democratic Party primaries and that although it was &quot;frustrating&quot; for his brother-in-law John Dolmayan to support Donald Trump, he added that they are &quot;on the same page with Armenian issues&quot;.

Tankian is also friendly with current Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, who wrote a song called &quot;Hayastane&quot; () which Tankian performed in April 2020. Tankian was also an executive producer and composer for the documentary &quot;I Am Not Alone&quot;, which chronicled the rise of Pashinyan.

Tankian is a supporter of the Black Lives Matter protests, as he stated in his interview with h-pem.

In 2020, Tankian condemned the actions of Azerbaijan in the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War and expressed his support to Armenia and the Republic of Artsakh. Since September 27, 2020, when the war broke, Tankian has been very active on social media, posting daily messages and has spoken to a number of media outlets about the issue, including Forbes.

In May 2021, more than 600 musicians, including Tankian, added their signature to an open letter calling for a boycott of performances in Israel until Israel ends its occupation of the Palestinian territories. In November 2023, Tankian signed an open letter calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza war.

===Animal rights and environmental issues===
Tankian is an advocate of environmental and animal protection. He became a vegetarian, claiming in an interview with PETA that his change was due to &quot;touring and its variety of edible crap&quot;, and he also felt it was &quot;instinctive somewhat&quot;. Furthermore, he also feels the need for respect toward &quot;mother earth&quot;. In July 2009, he signed a PETA petition against the slaughtering methods of chickens in KFC slaughterhouses.

However, in 2024 Tankian stated in an interview on the popular YouTube channel Mythical Kitchen that he had begun eating meat again the year prior.

==Personal life==
On June 9, 2012, Tankian married his long-time girlfriend Angela Madatyan, an Armenian woman from Vanadzor, in a private ceremony in Simi Valley, California. On October 24, 2014, he announced that they had a son. The family lives intermittently between Warkworth, New Zealand and Los Angeles as of 2015. Tankian is the brother-in-law of his System of a Down bandmate John Dolmayan, as their respective wives are sisters.

In 2018, Tankian founded Kavat Coffee, a company that focuses on Armenian coffee.

<text>Shavarsh &quot;Shavo&quot; Odadjian (; born April 22, 1974) is an Armenian-American musician, best known as the bassist of heavy metal band System of a Down. He also plays bass in a trap group called North Kingsley and in the metal band Seven Hours After Violet.

During System of a Down&#x27;s hiatus from 2006 to 2010, Odadjian collaborated with Wu-Tang Clan founder RZA on a project called AcHoZeN, which contributed a number of songs to the motion picture &quot;Babylon A.D.&quot; A compilation album was released in 2015. Odadjian is also credited with the musical scoring of the film, alongside RZA and Hans Zimmer.

== Early life ==
Odadjian was born in Yerevan, Armenian SSR, Soviet Union. He moved to Los Angeles at the age of five and attended the Alex Pilibos Elementary School, an Armenian parochial school, along with future bandmates Daron Malakian and Serj Tankian.

During his youth, Odadjian has stated that he spent most of his time skateboarding and listening to punk rock and heavy metal music. Among others, he credits Dead Kennedys, Slayer, Black Sabbath and Metallica as his favorite bands, and the most substantial influence on his musical development and career.

== Recording career ==

=== System of a Down ===

While attending college (majoring in Psychology and minoring in Art) and working in a bank, Odadjian began managing Soil – the band Daron Malakian and Serj Tankian were a part of in 1993. Odadjian had met them in a recording studio, where he was rehearsing. The two members called upon him for assistance, and he became manager of the band. Odadjian says in an early interview that securing System&#x27;s first local gig was a struggle:


In 1995, Odadjian became the band&#x27;s permanent bassist. They named themselves System of a Down, after a poem written by bandmate Daron Malakian entitled &quot;Victims of a Down.&quot; Odadjian was not keen on being labeled &quot;Victims,&quot; and thought that the word &quot;System&quot; appealed to a much broader audience. The band has stated that they also wanted their CDs to be placed in stores alongside their favorite band, Slayer. It was at this time that Odadjian passed on his original managerial responsibilities to Velvet Hammer Music. Their first release was titled &quot;Sugar.&quot; Soon after, drummer Andy Khachaturian joined the band but was replaced in 1997 by current drummer John Dolmayan due to a hand injury.

Odadjian plays bass in System of a Down, and also sings live backing vocals. His usual style of playing bass is with a pick, although he also has been seen fingerpicking during certain songs. Odadjian is credited with writing noted System of a Down songs, among them &quot;Toxicity&quot;, &quot;Sugar&quot;, &quot;Jet Pilot&quot;, &quot;Bounce,&quot; &quot;Mind,&quot; &quot;Dreaming,&quot; and &quot;U-Fig.&quot; He has directed a majority of the band&#x27;s music videos, and is responsible for stage design and lighting for each of their live performances.

On October 21, 2001, during a show in Grand Rapids, Michigan where System of a Down was headlining with Slipknot, Odadjian was assaulted, racially profiled and escorted out of the Van Andel Arena by security guards when he tried to enter the backstage. He filed a lawsuit in March 2003.

Physically Odadjian catches the eye through his notoriously scaling, braided beard, and spiked arm bracelet. Particularly Odadjian&#x27;s beard quickly became a part of his signature look.

Commenting on System of a Down&#x27;s reputation for biting, socially and politically charged lyrics, Odadjian has rejected the label of System of a Down as a &quot;political band&quot; in interviews. He has stated:

The band was on hiatus between 2006 and 2010, with group members focusing on outside projects. On November 23, 2010, System released an official statement declaring that they would play a number of European festivals in 2011, and they played a number of shows in western North America as well.

=== Reuniting for recent performances ===
On October 31, 2009, Odadjian hosted the event &quot;Halloween&quot; at The Roxy, in which he and fellow System bandmates Daron Malakian and John Dolmayan reunited to jam on stage and perform various songs together, including System of a Down&#x27;s &quot;Suite-Pee.&quot; The System of a Down trio also came together on November 20, 2009, and performed System songs together for a benefit honoring coma-stricken Chi Cheng of Deftones, with Chino Moreno of Deftones singing on lead vocals.

=== AcHoZeN ===

Odadjian started a side project in May 2006 named AcHoZeN. AcHoZeN is the musical alliance between Odadjian, Wu-Tang Clan founder RZA, Kinetic 9 (aka: Beretta 9 from Killarmy), and up-and-comer, the Reverend William Burke from Chicago. Achozen&#x27;s mantra is:

The four principal members feel that their unique sound is not only spiritual in nature, but a new genre of &quot;heavy hip hop,&quot; not &quot;rap-metal.&quot; There are no heavy guitars on the album, but the sound is genre-blending. Most of the Achozen album was recorded at one of Odadjian&#x27;s two studios and were also produced by him. The bulk of the beats were created by Odadjian (only one or two samples were used on the entire record) who also played live instruments throughout, including bass and sitar. RZA, who contributed his share of beats, Kinetic 9 and the Reverend William Burke sing a majority of the vocals and lyrics, which are, according to Odadjian, &quot;some of the most innovative, poetic and righteous words and vocals that I&#x27;ve ever heard.&quot; Odadjian&#x27;s vocals can also be heard on the AcHoZeN tracks &quot;&quot;Deuces&quot;,&quot; &quot;Salute/Sacrifice,&quot; and other songs on the album.
Achozen&#x27;s debut features an eclectic array of guest performers that includes Funk-master George Clinton, Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; guitarist John Frusciante, Wu-Tang affiliate Killah Priest, Wu-Tang founding member GZA, emcee Sick Jacken from Psycho Realm, and Angolan rapper Leggezin Fin.

The music of Achozen is described by one writer as a cosmic experience in hip-hop:

Odadjian has described AcHoZeN as &quot;a musical revolution. It is not just a band, it&#x27;s a way of thinking.&quot; RZA and Odadjian anticipate upcoming tours. Achozen also appears on the major motion picture, Babylon A.D., on which AcHoZeN song &quot;Deuces&quot; is heard blaring at the introduction of the film. AcHoZeN&#x27;s first live show was at the Key Club in L.A on December 1, 2006.

On Friday, November 13, 2009, the second AcHoZeN track &quot;Salute/Sacrifice&quot; was released exclusively as a free download on Odadjian&#x27;s online art district and networking site, urSESSION.com from the upcoming AcHoZeN debut album. The AcHoZeN album was anticipated to be released in mid-2010, but has yet to be released, due in part to Odadjian&#x27;s commitments to System of a Down.

In 2015, the album was released as a compilation of 8 songs based on a boombox digital format. Potentially, more songs are to come as it has been stated that many more are mixed and recorded.

=== North Kingsley ===

Formed in 2019, Odadjian joined Ray Hawthorne and Saro Paparian&#x27;s project as executive producer. After a few months, he joined as a member of the band and subsequently renamed the group North Kingsley.

Shavo spoke with &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; about the band&#x27;s name origin revealing it came from the first street he lived on when he first moved to Los Angeles from Armenia back in 1979. Lineup: Odadjian, Ray Hawthorne, and
Saro Paparian.

In 2020, Odadjian launched his new band, North Kingsley, featuring Saro Paparian and Ray Hawthorne. They released their debut single &quot;Like That&quot; on August 6. On December 4, 2020, the band released their second EP titled &quot;Vol.2.&quot;

=== Seven Hours After Violet ===
In 2024, Odadjian debuted the new band Seven Hours After Violet. Featuring Odadjian on bass, the band includes guitarist Michael Montoya, a.k.a. Morgoth Beatz and drummer Josh Johnson from the band Winds of Plague, guitarist-vocalist Alejandro Aranda, and lead vocalist Taylor Barber. The band made their live debut October 7, 2024 for SiriusXM, then performed their first festival appearance at the 2024 Mayhem Festival in San Bernardino, California. These appearances coincided with the release of the band&#x27;s self-titled album on October 11, 2024.

=== DJing and other projects ===

In addition, Odadjian is a popular DJ in the LA area, taking part in such events as the &quot;Rock/DJ Explosion&quot; on March 2, 2001, at The Roxy in Hollywood, CA and collaborating with System of a Down bandmate Serj Tankian on &quot;Serart&quot;, the singer&#x27;s collaboration album with multitalented Armenian musician Arto Tunçboyacıyan. Odadjian goes by the name &quot;DJ Tactics&quot;, and spins a wide spectrum of music spanning hip-hop, tech-house, classic rock, and metal.

Recently, Odadjian has appeared playing as part of the backing band of George Clinton (of Parliament/Funkadelic). In September 2008 he appeared (playing guitar instead of bass) in a live performance on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; with Clinton. Odadjian also appears on Clinton&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;George Clinton and His Gangsters of Love&quot;, which features many guest musicians, including Odadjian&#x27;s Achozen bandmate RZA, Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante, and Carlos Santana.

Odadjian was executive producer for Abloom, a side project of members of Onesidezero, Snot, and Soulfly. Odadjian is currently mentoring the band Chameleon Conductor record their debut album. Odadjian&#x27;s younger brother Dave Odadjian plays bass in the band, alongside his cousin Harry Markarian, who plays the guitar.

== Other work ==

=== Directing and editing ===
Stating himself to be a &quot;very visual person&quot;, Odadjian has directed and edited extensive music videos for System of a Down, including &quot;Aerials&quot; and &quot;Toxicity&quot;. The video concept for &quot;Question!&quot; states came from one of his dreams.

Odadjian&#x27;s directing style implements surreal atmospheric themes and integrates innovative methods in filming, inspired by Rod Serling (Twilight Zone). Odadjian&#x27;s Serling-esque style is apparent in System of a Down music videos &quot;Aerials,&quot; &quot;Question,&quot; and Taproot&#x27;s video -also directed by Odadjian – &quot;Mine.&quot; On May 15, 2007, it was revealed that Odadjian would be directing the first video from Bad Brains&#x27;s album &quot;Build a Nation&quot;. Odadjian makes an appearance at the end of the concert video with frontman H.R. The two are seen charismatically walking stage side, conversing and smoking together. Odadjian also directed the TV spot and launch trailer for the 2015 video game &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, which features his band&#x27;s signature song &quot;Chop Suey!&quot;.

=== Scoring films ===
In 2007–2008, Odadjian and Rza teamed up with &quot;Hans Zimmer&quot; in scoring major motion-picture, summer blockbuster movie &quot;Babylon A.D.&quot;, starring Vin Diesel. Along with the song &quot;Deuces&quot;, Odadjian is credited with writing the songs &quot;A Single Moment&quot;, &quot;Foreshadow&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner 0.8.&quot;, &quot;Rollin DissgEyes&quot;, &quot;Build Your Enemies&quot;, &quot;Digital Slaps&quot;, and &quot;Immaculate&quot; for the scoring of the film.

=== Acting ===
Odadjian&#x27;s involvement in the arts began at an early age, as he first appeared in the 1993 &quot;Big Gun&quot; video by AC/DC, standing alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger in the crowd sporting a backwards baseball cap and a white T-shirt, while Schwarzenegger catches a stick of dynamite. In an interview with Loudwire, he noted that him being prominently featured next to Schwarzenegger was unintentional, as the shot they used had the lights hit him more than any other extras in the crowd. He also made a cameo as Hansel&#x27;s Posse member in the film Zoolander.

In 2006, Odadjian starred in the critically acclaimed film &quot;Screamers&quot;, a documentary by internationally known director Carla Garapedian. The film follows Odadjian and the rest of the rock band System of a Down as they tour Europe and the US, pointing out the horrors of modern genocide that began in Armenia in 1915 up through Darfur today.

=== Painting and artwork ===

Odadjian is an avid and passionate painter outside of music. His artwork has been featured in many System of a Down music videos and live shows – including an abstract piece highlighted in the &quot;Hypnotize&quot; video. Odadjian&#x27;s painting style is abstract with loud, bright colors that bleed into each other. During Ozzfest of 2006, Odadjian created a 27-piece, abstract mosaic of paintings that was utilized as the stage backdrop for System&#x27;s headlining at Ozzfest. (Stage design in System of a Down performances is also attributed to Odadjian). One critic wrote of the Ozzfest performance:

Each of Odadjian&#x27;s paintings for the 2006 Ozzfest performance were hand-picked by Odadjian himself. Odadjian states that, in pairing each of his pieces/backdrops to songs, he aimed to coordinate each unique emotion of a specific song to the matching vibe of his paintings.

=== Philanthropy and activism ===

Odadjian is a human rights activist known to take on an avid role in protesting against human atrocities, including, but not limited to, the recognition and prevention of worldwide genocide. He also actively participates in youth mentoring, and frequents charitable events that work to further research for cancer-stricken children. On February 27, 2009, Odadjian was presented with AGBU&#x27;s GenNEXT &quot;&quot;Community Hero Award&quot;,&quot; an award paying tribute to his outstanding work as a role model for young Armenian-Americans. Odadjian was nominated for the award by young kids in the community. During his acceptance speech, Odadjian highlighted the importance of being active in your local community:

Odadjian later discussed the personal value of his nomination by the kids of the community for the award:

Odadjian is married to Sonia Odadjian, with whom he has three children.

<text>John Dolmayan () (born July 15, 1972) is a Lebanese-born Armenian-American musician, best known as the drummer of System of a Down. He is also the former drummer for Scars on Broadway. Dolmayan ranked number 33 on &quot;Loudwire&quot;″s list of &quot;Top 200 Hard Rock + Metal Drummers of All Time&quot;.

== Early life ==
John Dolmayan was born in Beirut, Lebanon, to Armenian parents. During the Lebanese Civil War, his family moved to California.

Dolmayan first became interested in drums at the age of two. His father was a saxophone player and when his mother would take him to watch his father play, he would mimic his father&#x27;s drummer. He learned to play the drums by putting on records and practicing for hours a day, and continued said practice for years. Dolmayan describes his musical style as one influenced by whatever he could get his hands on, including the jazz albums belonging to his father and the rock albums he shared with his friends.

Dolmayan is a fan of the Who and cites Who drummer Keith Moon as his biggest influence. Other drummers that he cites as major influences include Led Zeppelin&#x27;s John Bonham, Stewart Copeland from the Police, and Rush&#x27;s Neil Peart.

== System of a Down ==
Dolmayan joined System of a Down in 1997 after their original drummer, Ontronik &quot;Andy&quot; Khachaturian, left the band due to a hand injury.

Dolmayan recorded five albums with System of a Down: &quot;System of a Down&quot; (1998), &quot;Toxicity&quot; (2001), &quot;Steal This Album!&quot; (2002), &quot;Mezmerize&quot; (2005) and &quot;Hypnotize&quot; (2005).

Dolmayan won &quot;DRUM! Magazine&quot;″s 2006 Drummer of the year and was the feature story in their March edition.
The band went on hiatus in 2006, but reunited in 2010 to occasionally tour.

==Scars on Broadway==

After System of a Down went on hiatus in 2006, Dolmayan teamed up with Daron Malakian (System of a Down&#x27;s guitarist/vocalist) to form a new band called Scars on Broadway, which recorded their eponymous debut album in 2007 and 2008. The album was released in the summer of 2008 and Dolmayan, Malakian, guitarist Franky Perez, bassist Dominic Cifarelli, and keyboardist Danny Shamoun performed concerts and prepared to embark on a tour in support of the album before Malakian suddenly cancelled the tour in October 2008.

In August 2009, Dolmayan, Perez, Shamoun, and Cifarelli as Scars on Broadway traveled to Iraq for a USO tour across the U.S. army bases. Their setlist consisted of covers as well as a few Scars on Broadway songs.

Scars on Broadway reunited with Malakian on May 2, 2010, and released a new single later that year. However, the project went dormant and Dolmayan was no longer involved when Malakian reformed the group in 2018.

==Other projects==

Dolmayan recorded drums for Killing Joke&#x27;s 2003 self-titled album, (although the band ended up going with Dave Grohl&#x27;s tracks) as well as Scum of the Earth&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Blah...Blah...Blah...Love Songs for the New Millennium&quot;. He also played drums on the Axis of Justice concert tour with various artists and on the Serj Tankian solo debut, &quot;Elect the Dead&quot;.

In June 2009, Dolmayan formed a new rock band called Indicator with three friends from Southern California, members of the recently disbanded punk rock band If All Else Fails: Tom Capossela, Ryan Huber, and Ryan Murphy. The band played their first show at The Bitter End in San Diego on July 22, 2009, with Dolmayan&#x27;s fellow Scars on Broadway member Franky Perez joining the band for a few songs. Their second and final show took place at a strip club in Las Vegas. The band wrote 10-12 songs from 2009 to 2010; live and acoustic demos exist of them all. The four remain in contact although it is uncertain whether the songs will ever be properly recorded.

Dolmayan performed with System of a Down bandmates Daron Malakian and bassist Shavo Odadjian and Scars on Broadway guitarist Franky Perez for Odadjian&#x27;s Halloween show. Dolmayan, Malakian, and Odadjian performed together again in November 2009 during a charity show for Deftones bassist Chi Cheng.

Dolmayan has devoted much of his life to the comic book retail industry, including launching Torpedo Comics out of Nevada. Torpedo Comics has two brick and mortar stores in addition to a significant online presence.

In 2009, John auditioned for the Smashing Pumpkins, in the absence of Jimmy Chamberlin.

In 2014, Dolmayan started a Kickstarter to fund cover project, These Grey Men, releasing their first single, a cover of Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Street Spirit (Fade Out)&quot;, in January 2020. Avenged Sevenfold singer M. Shadows contributed vocals to the track; Tom Morello contributed the guitar solo at the song&#x27;s close. The second single features System of a Down bandmate Serj Tankian in a cover of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Starman&quot;.

== Personal life ==
John Dolmayan is married to Diana Dolmayan (&quot;née&quot; Madatyan), who is the sister of Tankian&#x27;s wife Angela, making them brothers-in-law.

On his social media accounts, Dolmayan is very politically active like his bandmates; unlike most members of System of a Down, particularly Tankian, Dolmayan supported Donald Trump&#x27;s presidency. Tankian has stated that it is &quot;frustrating&quot; to be politically opposite with his bandmate and brother-in-law. In October 2023, Dolmayan claimed he had lost friends as well as &quot;hundreds of thousands of fans&quot; on Instagram due to his controversial opinions about Trump, his beliefs that Black Lives Matter &quot;never had legitimacy&quot; and was a &quot;propaganda tool&quot; for the Democratic Party, and his arguments that the COVID-19 pandemic &quot;has always been about money&quot;.

A long time comic book fan, Dolmayan owns a comic book shop, Torpedo Comics, in Las Vegas.

He had Arthur Adams illustrate a scene of giant women fighting robots and Godzilla; Simon Bisley illustrated the Hulk and Thing; Kevin Eastman provided illustration of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles; and Tim Vigil depicted a sexually explicit scene of demons engaged in a sex act.

<text>Edward Montgomery Clift (October 17, 1920 – July 23, 1966) was an American actor. A four-time Academy Award nominee, he was known for his portrayal of &quot;moody, sensitive young men&quot;, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

He is best remembered for his roles in Howard Hawks&#x27;s &quot;Red River&quot; (1948), George Stevens&#x27;s &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; (1951), Fred Zinnemann&#x27;s &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1953), Stanley Kramer&#x27;s &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; (1961), and John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Misfits&quot; (1961).

Along with Marlon Brando and James Dean, Clift was considered one of the original method actors in Hollywood (though Clift distanced himself from the term); he was one of the first actors to be invited to study in the Actors Studio with Lee Strasberg and Elia Kazan. He also executed a rare move by not signing a contract after arriving in Hollywood, only doing so after his first two films were a success. This was described as &quot;a power differential that would go on to structure the star–studio relationship for the next 40 years&quot;. A documentary titled &quot;Making Montgomery Clift&quot; was made by his nephew, Robert Anderson Clift, in 2018, to clarify myths that were created about the actor.

==Early life==
Edward Montgomery Clift was born on October 17, 1920, in Omaha, Nebraska. His father, William Brooks &quot;Bill&quot; Clift (1886–1964), was the vice-president of Omaha National Trust Company. His mother was Ethel Fogg &quot;Sunny&quot; Clift (&quot;née&quot; Anderson; 1888–1988). His parents were Quakers and met as students at Cornell University, marrying in 1914. Clift had a twin sister, Roberta (who later went by &quot;Ethel&quot;), who survived him by 48 years, and an older brother, William Brooks Clift, Jr. (1919–1986), known as &quot;Brooks,&quot; who had a son with actress Kim Stanley and was later married to political reporter Eleanor Clift. Clift had English and Scottish ancestry on his father&#x27;s side, wealthy relatives who hailed from Chattanooga, Tennessee. His mother, Sunny, was adopted; she maintained that Clift’s true maternal great-grandfathers were the US postmaster-general Montgomery Blair and Union commander Robert Anderson, a part of her lineage that was clarified to her (when she came of age) by Dr. Edward Montgomery, the family doctor who delivered her. She spent the rest of her life trying to gain the recognition of her alleged relations.

Part of Clift&#x27;s mother&#x27;s effort was her determination that her children should be brought up in the style of aristocrats. Thus, as long as Clift&#x27;s father was able to pay for it, he and his siblings were privately tutored, travelled extensively in America and Europe, became fluent in German and French, and led a protected life, sheltered from the destitution and communicable diseases that became legion following the First World War. At age 7, while aboard a European ship, a boy forced Clift’s head underwater in the swimming pool for so long that a gland in his neck burst from his struggle to breathe; he had a long scar from the resulting infection and operation. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression of the 1930s ruined Clift&#x27;s father financially; Bill was forced to downsize and move to Chicago to take a new job while Sunny continued traveling with the children. In a 1957 issue of &quot;McCall’s&quot; magazine, Clift quipped, &quot;My childhood was hobgoblin, my parents traveled a lot…That’s all I can remember.&quot;

===Early theater career: 1934–1946===
Clift had shown an interest in acting and theatrics as a child living in Switzerland and France but did not take the initiative to go out for a part in a local production until age 13, when his family was forced to downsize and relocate from Chicago to Sarasota, Florida. He had a small non-paying role. 

Close to a year later the family moved again, settling in New York City. Clift debuted on Broadway at age 14 as Harmer Masters in the comedy &quot;Fly Away Home,&quot; which ran from January to July 1935 at the 48th Street Theatre. The &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot; noticed Clift’s &quot;amazing poise and dexterity&quot; while producer Theo Bamberger commended him for what he called a &quot;natural histrionic instinct.&quot; 

Clift spent a short time at the Dalton School in Manhattan but struggled with traditional schooling. He continued to flourish onstage and appeared in works by Moss Hart and Cole Porter, Robert Sherwood, Lillian Hellman, Tennessee Williams, and Thornton Wilder, creating the part of Henry in the original production of &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot;. 

Clift proved to be a successful young stage actor working with, among others, Dame May Whitty, Alla Nazimova, Mary Boland, Cornelia Otis Skinner, Fredric March, Tallulah Bankhead, Alfred Lunt, and Lynn Fontanne. In 1939, as a member of the cast of the 1939 Broadway production of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Hay Fever&quot;, Clift participated in one of the first television broadcasts in the United States. The &quot;Hay Fever&quot; performance was broadcast by NBC&#x27;s New York television station W2XBS (the forerunner of WNBC) and was aired during the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. At age 20, he appeared in the Broadway production of &quot;There Shall Be No Night&quot;, a work that won the 1941 Pulitzer Prize for Drama.

Clift also participated in radio broadcasts early in his career, though, according to one critic, he hated the medium. On May 24, 1944, he was part of the cast of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Ah, Wilderness!&quot; for &quot;The Theatre Guild on the Air&quot;. 

In 1949, as part of the promotional campaign for the film &quot;The Heiress&quot;, he played Heathcliff in the one-hour version of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; for &quot;Ford Theatre&quot;. In January 1951, he participated in the episode &quot;The Metal in the Moon&quot; for the series &quot;Cavalcade of America&quot;, sponsored by the chemical company DuPont Company. Also in 1951, Clift was cast for the first time as Tom in the radio world premiere of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;, with Helen Hayes (Amanda) and Karl Malden (the Gentleman Caller), for &quot;The Theatre Guild on the Air&quot;.

Clift did not serve during World War II, having been given 4-F status after suffering dysentery in 1942. Immediately following the end of the war in September 1945 (in what would be Clift&#x27;s penultimate Broadway performance,) he starred in the stage adaptation of D.H. Lawrence&#x27;s short story &quot;You Touched Me.&quot; He and actor Kevin McCarthy later wrote a screenplay for a film adaptation that was never made. 

By this time, Clift had developed what would come to be regarded as his signature acting style and biggest impact on the future of modern film acting, as told by biographer Robert LaGuardia:

==Career==
===Rise to film stardom: 1946–1956===

At age 25, Clift&#x27;s first Hollywood film role was opposite John Wayne in the Western film &quot;Red River;&quot; director Howard Hawks was impressed by his recent stage performance and was willing to sign him with no strings attached, which greatly appealed to Clift&#x27;s sense of independence. Although filmed in 1946, the film was delayed release until August 1948. A critical and commercial success, the film was nominated for two Academy Awards.

Clift&#x27;s second film role (though it premiered first that same year) was &quot;The Search,&quot; which earned him his first nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actor. Clift&#x27;s naturalistic performance led to director Fred Zinnemann&#x27;s being asked, &quot;Where did you find a soldier who can act so well?&quot; Clift was unhappy with the quality of the script, and reworked it himself. The film was awarded a screenwriting Academy Award for the credited writers. MGM distributed the film nationwide as magazines generated massive attention for Clift.

Paramount Pictures ended up offering him the best of any incoming studio offer (which he accepted): a three-film deal (down from the typical seven-year contract) that came with the freedom to turn down any script and any director, as well as the right for either himself or the studio to terminate the agreement at any time.

Every major Hollywood studio wanted to make a deal with Clift and was collectively shocked that a young actor could command such leverage after the release of a single film: &quot;the death knell of the producers and the moguls, and the birth of Actor Power.&quot; Clift was on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine by December 1948. &quot;Look&quot; magazine gave him its Achievement Award and called him &quot;the most promising star on the Hollywood horizon.

Clift&#x27;s first film for Paramount was &quot;The Heiress&quot; (1949). While director William Wyler notably had difficulty with his poor posture, co-star Olivia de Havilland expressed difficulty with his seriousness, saying that &quot;Monty was painstaking and I liked that about him, but I had a sense that Monty was thinking almost entirely of himself and leaving me out of the scene.&quot;

He tended to funnel most of his energy into intense rehearsals with acting coach Mira Rostova who accompanied him on set. Overall he ended up unhappy with his performance and left early during the film&#x27;s premiere. The following summer in 1949, Clift shot &quot;The Big Lift&quot; in Berlin. It was intended to be more of a semi-documentary, pro-America wartime film and less an acting vehicle, but was still a welcome opportunity for Clift to portray a U.S. soldier.

Clift&#x27;s next role as the drifter George Eastman in &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; (1951) is regarded as one of his signature method acting performances. He worked extensively on his character, and was again nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor. For his character&#x27;s scenes in jail, Clift spent a night in a real state prison.

His main acting rival (and fellow Omaha native), Marlon Brando, was so moved by Clift&#x27;s performance that he voted for Clift to win the Academy Award for Best Actor, sure that he would win, while Clift voted for Brando in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire.&quot;

&quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; was critically acclaimed; Charlie Chaplin called it &quot;the greatest movie made about America&quot;. The film received added media attention due to the rumors that Clift and co-star Elizabeth Taylor were dating in real life.

After a break, Clift committed himself to three more films, all of which premiered during 1953: &quot;I Confess&quot; to be directed by Alfred Hitchcock, Vittorio De Sica&#x27;s &quot;Terminal Station,&quot; and Fred Zinnemann&#x27;s &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;, which earned Clift his third Academy Award nomination (the second of two nominations for films directed by Zinnemann). For the latter, Clift committed to building strength and endurance by jogging laps around Hollywood High School, learning boxing from Mushy Callahan and author James Jones, and how to imitate playing the bugle and reading sheet music from trumpeter Mannie Klein for the role of middleweight boxer and bugle-playing soldier Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt. During the casting of &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;, Harry Cohn opposed Clift for the part of Prewitt, opting for John Derek or Aldo Ray instead. However, Jones and Zinnemann preferred Clift and personally campaigned for him for the role. Clift visited Jones several times at his homes in Arizona and Illinois and modeled the character after Jones himself. After seeing the film, Jones commended Clift for his portrayal of Prewitt. Clift supported and mentored Frank Sinatra in his role as Private Angelo Maggio. Sinatra later said, &quot;I learned more about acting from him than I ever knew before&quot;.

===Car crash===

On the evening of May 12, 1956, while filming &quot;Raintree County&quot;, Clift was involved in a serious car crash after leaving a dinner party in Beverly Hills, California, hosted by Elizabeth Taylor and her husband, Michael Wilding. Clift had veered off one of the twisting hairpin turns and smashed into a telephone pole and the surrounding cliffside. Alerted by friend Kevin McCarthy, who witnessed the collision, Taylor found Clift under the shattered dashboard, conscious but with his face bleeding and swelling rapidly. She pulled out a hanging tooth that was cutting into his tongue before accompanying him into the ambulance.

He suffered a concussion, broken jaw, broken nose, fractured sinuses, fractured cheekbones, and several facial lacerations that required plastic surgery. In a filmed interview years later in 1963, Clift described his injuries in detail, including how his broken nose could be snapped back into place.

After a two-month recovery period, Clift returned to the set to finish the film. Despite the studio&#x27;s concerns over profits, Clift correctly predicted the film would do well, if only because moviegoers would flock to see the difference in his facial appearance before and after the crash.

Although the results of Clift&#x27;s plastic surgeries were remarkable for the time in leaving no visible scars, the differences in his facial appearance were noticeable, particularly the left side of his face, which was nearly immobile.

Continued pain from his injuries led him to rely on alcohol and pills for relief, as he had done after an earlier bout with dysentery left him with chronic intestinal problems. As a result, Clift&#x27;s health and physical appearance deteriorated.

===Later film career: 1957–1966===
For the next nine years, Clift made nearly as many films after his traumatic car accident as he had previously. Still, the last half of his 20-year career has been referred to as the &quot;longest suicide in Hollywood history&quot; by acting teacher Robert Lewis because of Clift&#x27;s subsequent abuse of painkillers and alcohol. He began to behave erratically in public, which embarrassed his friends. His next four films were &quot;The Young Lions&quot; (1958), which is the only film featuring both Clift and Marlon Brando, &quot;Lonelyhearts&quot; (1958), &quot;Suddenly, Last Summer&quot; (1959), and Elia Kazan&#x27;s &quot;Wild River&quot;, released in 1960.

With his next two films, &quot;The Misfits&quot; (1961) and &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; (1961), Clift pivoted to somewhat smaller supporting or cameo roles that required less overall screen time, while still delivering demanding performances. Playing the faded rodeo rider Perce Howland in &quot;The Misfits&quot;, his first, introductory scene, performed inside a phone booth, only took two hours of the scheduled two shooting days, which impressed cast and crew. Marilyn Monroe (in what was to be her last filmed role) was also having emotional and substance-abuse problems at the time; she described Clift in a 1961 interview as &quot;the only person I know who is in even worse shape than I am&quot;.

In his 12-minute cameo scene in &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; (1961), Clift played a developmentally disabled German baker who had been a victim of the Nazi sterilisation programme testifying at the Nuremberg trials. Clift was willing to waive his fee entirely, accepting the supporting part with minimum compensation. His anguished performance (which earned him his fourth Academy Award nomination) was often thought to be due to his own nervous breakdown. Director Stanley Kramer later wrote in his memoirs that Clift &quot;wasn&#x27;t always close to the script, but whatever he said fitted in perfectly&quot; and that he suggested Clift turn to Spencer Tracy to &quot;ad lib something&quot; when he struggled to remember his lines for his one scene. In nephew Robert Anderson Clift&#x27;s 2018 documentary, superimposed pages of Clift&#x27;s own heavily annotated original script show that the actor was actually deliberately and consciously performing with his own rewritten dialogue as opposed to confused improvisation. On a taped phone call, Clift said that he played the character in a way that &quot;holds onto himself, in spite of himself&quot; with dignity.

After completing John Huston&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1962), Universal Studios sued him for his frequent absences that caused the film to go over budget. Clift countersued with the assertion that he struggled to keep up with an overwhelming volume of last-minute script revisions and that an accidental blow to both eyes on set gave him cataracts. The case was later settled out of court with evidence in Clift&#x27;s favor, but the damage to Clift&#x27;s reputation as unreliable and troublesome endured. As a consequence, he was unable to find film work for four years. The film&#x27;s success at the box office brought numerous awards for screenwriting and directing, but none for Clift himself.

On January 13, 1963, a few weeks after the initial release of &quot;Freud&quot;, Clift appeared on the live television discussion program &quot;The Hy Gardner Show&quot;, where he spoke at length about the release of his current film, his film career, and his treatment by the press. He also talked publicly for the first time about his 1956 car accident, the injuries he received, and its after-effects on his appearance. During the interview, Gardner jokingly mentioned that it is &quot;the first and last appearance on a television interview program for Montgomery Clift&quot;.

Barred from feature films, Clift turned to voice work. In 1964, he recorded for Caedmon Records &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;, with Jessica Tandy, Julie Harris, and David Wayne. In 1965, he gave voice to William Faulkner&#x27;s writings in the television documentary &quot;William Faulkner&#x27;s Mississippi&quot;, which aired in April 1965.

During this time, Peter Bogdanovich was working at a cinema in New York City when Clift came to see a revival screening of one of his early films – &quot;I Confess&quot; (1953) – and decided to show him the guestbook where a cinema patron had written down a film request for &quot;Anything with Montgomery Clift!&quot;

Elizabeth Taylor put her salary on the line as insurance to have Clift cast as her co-star in &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot;, to be directed by John Huston. In preparation for the shooting of this film, Clift accepted the role of James Bower in the French Cold War thriller &quot;The Defector&quot;, which was filmed in West Germany from February to April 1966. He insisted on performing his stunts himself, including swimming in the River Elbe in March. The schedule for &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot; was then set for August 1966, but Clift died in July 1966. Marlon Brando was cast as his replacement.

==Personal life==
Clift is said to have valued privacy and ambiguity in his personal life, though he was known to be friendly and affectionate, blurring the emotions of platonic love and sexual attraction, particularly with close friend Elizabeth Taylor. Paramount Pictures arranged for her to attend the Los Angeles premiere of &quot;The Heiress&quot; as Clift&#x27;s date to generate publicity. Paramount executive Luigi Luraschi remembered that Taylor, like many American teenagers, seemed &quot;unmistakably in love&quot; with Clift around the time of filming &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot;, which commenced soon after that premiere outing.

Throughout the 1950s, Clift and Taylor starred together as romantic leads in three films: &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot;, &quot;Raintree County&quot;, and &quot;Suddenly, Last Summer.&quot; Their romantic scenes in &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; received considerable acclaim for their naturalness and authentic appearance. Taylor remained a loyal friend to Clift until his death.

In 2000, at the GLAAD Media Awards, where Taylor was honored for her work for the LGBT community, she made the first public declaration by anyone that Clift was gay and called him her closest friend and confidant. Clift&#x27;s brother claimed he was bisexual. When Clift began therapy in late 1950, he told his psychiatrist, &quot;he thought he was homosexual and he wanted to know how to deal with it.&quot; After his death, in a taped telephone conversation with his brother, Clift&#x27;s mother stated that she had known early on that Clift was homosexual.

Many of Clift&#x27;s biographers cite his relationships with men and a few women based on friends&#x27; accounts and interviews. He was linked to actresses Libby Holman and Phyllis Thaxter. However, Clift&#x27;s longest relationships were with men. He was involved with the &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; actor Jack Larson and theater actor William LeMassena, with whom he had a three-year relationship. LeMassena remained a close friend to Clift until his death. He described their relationship with fondness and kept taped film reels of Clift and the company of &quot;There Shall Be No Night&quot; enjoying leisure time together.

Clift was deeply and intensely involved with Broadway choreographer Jerome Robbins; &quot;few associates were aware of how intimate and emotionally charged the relationship between Clift and Robbins was.&quot; They camouflaged their relationship by dating women. In 1948, when Clift left Robbins to pursue a movie career in Hollywood, the announcement devastated Robbins. He told Clift, &quot;I could make you love me,&quot; at the end of their two-year affair.
Robbins is said to have conceived the basic plot of &quot;West Side Story&quot; after Clift shared the idea with him, according to actor Russ Tamblyn. In 2021, Tamblyn recalled that Robbins &quot;told us on the set one day that the idea really came from Montgomery Clift, who was Jerry&#x27;s boyfriend at the time... He said that he was with Monty at a party on Fire Island … [and Clift said] &#x27;I&#x27;ve got an idea for a musical. Why not have a musical about Romeo and Juliet, but make it with gangs in New York?&#x27; And Jerry said that he just couldn&#x27;t get it out of his head.&quot; Robbins called Clift a &quot;theatrical genius&quot; early on in their affair.

In the early 1950s, Barney Balaban (president of Paramount Pictures) invited Clift on one of the Balaban family vacations to Nassau, Bahamas. Judy Balaban, his daughter, claimed that she had an immediate connection with Clift and the two were &quot;joined at the hip&quot;, dating for many months following. She attended the New York premiere of &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; in August 1951 as his date.

Prior to his involvement with Balaban, Clift had received a barrage of blackmail phone calls at his residence, threatening to out him as homosexual, which resulted in Clift having to repeatedly change his number.

While the press assumed that Balaban and Clift were an item, Clift secretly dated British actor Roddy McDowall. According to Balaban, she was naïve about Clift&#x27;s homosexuality and his romantic involvement with McDowall, who would occasionally accompany them on public outings. McDowall was introduced to Clift by his &quot;Lassie Come Home&quot; co-star Elizabeth Taylor. During the two and a half years that Clift stayed away from films, McDowall&#x27;s career was nonexistent. He devoted himself entirely to Clift and moved from Los Angeles to New York City to be closer to his idol. Reportedly, McDowall attempted suicide after their breakup. Nevertheless, he showed no bitterness and also remained one of Clift&#x27;s loyal friends. McDowall starred with Clift in his final picture, &quot;The Defector&quot;. Clift later stated that he could never have finished the film without McDowall&#x27;s moral support.

While filming for Vittorio De Sica in Italy, Clift had a romance with Truman Capote. Author James Jones and Clift became very close during the filming of &quot;From Here to Eternity.&quot; Jones publicly stated, &quot;I would have had an affair with him, but he never asked me.&quot; One of Clift&#x27;s first intimate relationships was with composer Lehman Engel. He was also involved with Donald Windham and his partner Sandy Campbell. In his memoir, Arthur Laurents suggests that Clift had a fling with Farley Granger.

Clift was also friends with Marlon Brando, who dropped by his home offering to accompany him to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.

Clift supported Adlai Stevenson in the 1952 United States presidential election.

==Death==

On July 22, 1966, Clift spent most of the day in his New York City townhouse, located at 217 East 61st Street. His private nurse and companion, Lorenzo James, and he had not spoken much all day. After midnight, shortly before 1:00 am, James asked Clift, who was in his bed and reading a book, whether he would be interested in viewing a rebroadcast of &quot;The Misfits&quot; that was airing as a late-night movie. &quot;Absolutely not!&quot; exclaimed Clift, and James went to his own bedroom to sleep, without saying another word to Clift. 

At 6:30 am, James woke up and went to wake Clift, but found the bedroom door closed and locked. Concerned and unable to break the door down, James ran down to the back garden and climbed up a ladder to enter through the second-floor bedroom window. Inside, he found Clift dead; he was undressed, lying in his bed still wearing his eyeglasses and with both fists clenched by his side. James used the bedroom telephone to call some of Clift&#x27;s personal physicians and the medical examiner&#x27;s office before an ambulance arrived.

Clift&#x27;s body was taken to the city morgue and autopsied. The autopsy report cited the cause of death as a heart attack brought on by &quot;occlusive coronary artery disease&quot;. No evidence was found that suggested foul play or suicide.

Drug addiction is commonly believed to have been responsible for Clift&#x27;s many health problems and his death. In addition to lingering effects of dysentery and chronic colitis, an underactive thyroid was later revealed during the autopsy. The condition (among other things) lowers blood pressure; it could have caused Clift to appear drunk or drugged when he was sober. 

Following a 15-minute funeral at St. James&#x27; Church on Madison Avenue in Manhattan, which was attended by 150 guests, including Lauren Bacall, Frank Sinatra, and Nancy Walker, Clift was buried in the Friends Quaker Cemetery, Prospect Park, Brooklyn. Elizabeth Taylor, who was in Rome, sent flowers, as did Roddy McDowall, Judy Garland, Myrna Loy, and Lew Wasserman.

== In popular culture ==

The song &quot;The Right Profile&quot; by the English punk rock band The Clash, from their album &quot;London Calling&quot;, is about the later life of Clift. The song alludes to his car crash and drug abuse, as well as the movies &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot;, &quot;Red River&quot;, &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;, and &quot;The Misfits&quot;, before closing with what &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine describes as &quot;a grudging admiration that becomes unexpectedly and astonishingly moving.&quot; &quot;Monty Got a Raw Deal&quot; by rock band R.E.M. is also about him. The song &quot;Montgomery Clift&quot; by British band Random Hold concerns the legend that Clift enjoyed hanging from the window ledges of tall buildings.

In the 2007 novel &quot;Zeroville&quot; and its 2019 film adaptation, the main character, Vikar, is fascinated by Clift. He has a tattoo of Clift and Elizabeth Taylor on his shaved head. Clift, portrayed by Dave Franco, appears briefly in the movie.

Clift (portrayed by Gavin Adams) was a major supporting character in the 2020 feature film &quot;As Long As I’m Famous&quot;, which explored his intimate relationship with a young Sidney Lumet during the summer of 1948.

<text>The Search is a 1948 American film directed by Fred Zinnemann that tells the story of a young Auschwitz survivor and his mother who search for each other across post-World War II Europe. It stars Montgomery Clift, Ivan Jandl, Jarmila Novotná and Aline MacMahon.

Many scenes were shot amidst the actual ruins of the postwar German cities Ingolstadt, Munich, Nuremberg and Würzburg. Filming took place between June and November 1947, first on location in Germany and then at a studio in Zurich, Switzerland for interior scenes. Although released in the United States in March 1948, the film was not released in Britain until May 1950. Its European premiere was held at the Empire, Leicester Square in London on November 2, 1949 in aid of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, with Queen Mary in attendance.

Jandl&#x27;s performance was recognized with a special juvenile Academy Award. However, the communist government of Czechoslovakia would not permit Jandl to travel to the United States to collect the Oscar and a Golden Globe award that he had also won. Zinnemann accepted the Oscar on Jandl&#x27;s behalf and the awards were delivered to Jandl in Prague.

==Plot==

In Allied-occupied Germany after World War II, trains transport homeless children (Displaced Persons), under the care of Mrs. Murray and other United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) workers, to a transit camp where they are fed and protected. The next morning UNRRA officials begin the challenging process of identifying the children and reuniting them with their surviving families, if any.

A young boy named Karel responds &quot;Ich weiß nicht&quot; (&quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;) to all questions. He grew up in a well-to-do Czech family. The Nazis deported his sister and their father, a physician, while Karel and his mother were sent to a concentration camp. Karel bears a tattoo, number A24328, and it is suggested that the A stands for Auschwitz. They were separated and, after the war, Karel survived by scavenging for food alongside other homeless children.

The next day the children are loaded into trucks and ambulances for transfer to other camps. The children in Karel&#x27;s group are terrified at first because the Nazis often used ambulances to kill victims via poison gas but eventually they enter the vehicle. During the trip the children panic at the smell of exhaust fumes. Karel&#x27;s friend Raoul forces open the back door and children scatter in all directions. Karel and Raoul try to swim across a river to escape from UNRRA men. Raoul drowns but Karel hides in the reeds.

As it turns out Karel&#x27;s mother, Mrs. Malik, is alive. In a parallel story she has been searching for her son. One camp she reaches appears at first to have a Karel Malik, but it turns out to be a Jewish boy who appropriated the name after it was unclaimed during a roll call, fearing retribution if he was recognized as Jewish by his real name. Mrs. Malik continues her search, eventually reaching Mrs. Murray&#x27;s camp, where she is told that her son has drowned.

Meanwhile Karel encounters Steve, a United States Army engineer, who cares for him. Because Karel cannot recall his name Steve calls him Jim. Steve teaches the boy English and begins the very long process to take the boy back with him to America.

When Karel sees another young boy interacting with his mother, he starts remembering his own mother and the place where he last saw her, through a fence in the concentration camp. He runs away one evening thinking that the fence is nearby. Karel finds a fence at a factory but cannot find his mother among the workers going home. Steve eventually finds Karel and tells him that his mother is dead, as he has reason to believe she was gassed when she arrived at Auschwitz. He also lets Karel know that he is trying to adopt him and take him to America to start a new life there.

Mrs. Malik ends up working for Mrs. Murray at the UNRRA camp. After a while she resigns to resume her nearly hopeless search for Karel. Mrs. Murray begs her to stay because she is so good with the children.

That same day Steve takes the boy to the UNRRA camp before leaving for America. He hopes to send for the boy once the paperwork is completed. Mrs. Murray remembers the boy. Suspecting that Jim is Karel, she hurries to the train station to bring Mrs. Malik back, but her train has already left. Then she sees Karel&#x27;s mother walking toward her with the latest trainload of displaced children. She saw them being unloaded from a train, changed her mind and decided to stay.

At the UNRRA camp Steve tells Karel to join the crowd of new arrivals. Mrs. Malik tells the children to follow her. Karel walks past, neither recognizing the other at first. Then Mrs. Malik swings around and calls, &quot;Karel!&quot;. The boy and his mother are reunited as Mrs. Murray and Steve look on.

<text>Godhead (or &quot;&quot;) refers to the essence or (&quot;ousia&quot;) of God in Christianity — God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

==Appearance in English Bibles==
John Wycliffe introduced the term into English Bible versions in two places, and, though somewhat archaic, the term survives in modern English because of its use in three places of the Tyndale New Testament (1525), the Geneva Bible (1560/1599), and King James Version (1611). In that translation, the word was used to translate three different Koine Greek words:

<text>Mark Fredrick Farner (born September 29, 1948) is an American musician. He was the original singer and guitarist of the rock band Grand Funk Railroad, which he co-founded in 1969, and later as a contemporary Christian musician.

== Early life and career ==
Farner began his career in music by playing in Terry Knight and The Pack (1965–1966), The Bossmen (1966–1967), The Pack (aka The Fabulous Pack) (1967–1968), before forming Grand Funk Railroad with Don Brewer (drums) and Mel Schacher (bass guitar) in 1969. Farner attended Flint Kearsley High School. Craig Frost (keyboards) joined the band in 1972. Farner is of Cherokee descent on his maternal side.

== With Grand Funk Railroad ==
Farner was the guitarist and lead singer for Grand Funk Railroad as well as the songwriter for most of their material. His best-known composition is the 1970 epic &quot;I&#x27;m Your Captain (Closer to Home)&quot;. He also wrote the 1975 hit &quot;Bad Time&quot;, the last of the band&#x27;s four singles to make the top 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

== Post-Grand Funk Railroad ==
After Grand Funk initially disbanded in 1976, Farner released his self-titled debut solo album in 1977, and his second, &quot;No Frills&quot;, in 1978 (both Atlantic Records). In 1981, Farner and Don Brewer launched a new Grand Funk line-up with bassist Dennis Bellinger and recorded two albums, &quot;Grand Funk Lives&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s Funk?&quot; Farner went solo again with 1988&#x27;s &quot;Just Another Injustice&quot; on Frontline Records. His third Frontline release was 1991&#x27;s &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot;, which featured a revamped Jesus version of the Grand Funk classic of the same name. Farner became a born again Christian in the late 1980s and enjoyed success with the John Beland composition &quot;Isn&#x27;t it Amazing&quot;, which earned him a Dove Award nomination and reached No. 2 on the Contemporary Christian music charts.

In the 1990s, Farner formed Lismark Communications with former Freedom Reader editor Steve Lisuk. Soon after, Farner began reissuing his solo albums on his own record label, LisMark Records.

From 1994 to 1995, Farner toured with Ringo Starr&#x27;s Allstars, which also featured Randy Bachman, John Entwistle, Felix Cavaliere, Billy Preston, and Starr&#x27;s son, Zak Starkey.

In the late 1990s, Farner reunited with Grand Funk, but left after three years to resume his solo career. He currently tours with his band, Mark Farner&#x27;s American Band, which plays a mixture of Grand Funk songs and Farner&#x27;s solo offerings.

Farner had a pacemaker installed October 22, 2012, having struggled with heart troubles for the previous eight years.

Mark Farner was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame as a solo artist in 2015. He had previously been inducted as a member of both Grand Funk Railroad and Terry Knight &amp; The Pack.

== Other interests ==
Farner was honored with the Lakota Sioux Elders Honor Mark in 1999. During the concert in Hankinson, North Dakota, a special presentation was held honoring Mark&#x27;s Native ancestry and his contributions. Members of the Lakota Nation presented him with a hand-made ceremonial quilt. He has also been honored with the Cherokee Medal of Honor by the Cherokee Honor Society.

An authorized biography of Farner, entitled &quot;From Grand Funk to Grace&quot;, was published in 2001.

== In popular culture ==

Mark Farner is mentioned by Homer Simpson in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode, &quot;Homerpalooza&quot;, in season 7, episode 24 of the series. As Homer drives his children and their friends to school, Grand Funk is on the car radio. The children do not like it and ask him to change the station when he responds, &quot;you kids don&#x27;t know Grand Funk? The wild, shirtless lyrics of Mark Farner. The bong-rattling bass of Mel Schacher. The competent drum work of Don Brewer?&quot;

Mark Farner was mentioned in episode 9 of season 8 of the HBO comedy series &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; in September 2011.

<doc id="149825" wikidata="Q335855" url="?curid=149825" title="Jake LaMotta">
<text>Giacobbe &quot;Jake&quot; LaMotta (July 10, 1922 – September 19, 2017) was an Italian-American professional boxer who was world middleweight champion between 1949 and 1951. Nicknamed &quot;The Bronx Bull&quot; or &quot;Raging Bull&quot; for his technique of constant stalking, brawling and inside fighting, he developed a reputation for being a &quot;bully&quot;; he was what is often referred to today as a swarmer and a slugger.

Due to his hard style of fighting, LaMotta often took as much as he dished out in an era of great middleweights. With a thick skull and jaw muscles, LaMotta was able to absorb incredible amounts of punishment over the course of his career, and is thought to have one of the greatest chins in boxing history. LaMotta&#x27;s six-fight rivalry with Sugar Ray Robinson was one of the most notable in the sport. Although each fight was close and LaMotta dropped Robinson to the canvas multiple times, LaMotta won only one of the bouts. LaMotta, who lived a turbulent life in and out of the ring, was managed by his brother Joey. He was ranked 52nd on &quot;Ring Magazine&quot;″s list of the &quot;80 Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years&quot;, and also ranked amongst its list of the 10 greatest middleweights of all time. LaMotta was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 1990.

LaMotta&#x27;s autobiography was adapted into the 1980 Martin Scorsese film &quot;Raging Bull&quot;. It went on to be nominated for eight Academy Awards, with Robert De Niro winning Best Actor for his portrayal of LaMotta.

==Early life==
LaMotta was born on the Lower East Side of New York City on July 10, 1922, to Italian parents, Elizabeth (Merluzzo) and Giuseppe &quot;Joseph&quot; LaMotta. Many sources had reported his year of birth as 1921, but his daughter Christi claimed it was in fact 1922. His mother was born in the United States to Italian immigrants, while his father was an immigrant from Messina, Sicily, who came with family including Jake&#x27;s older brother Joseph. The family lived briefly in Philadelphia before returning to New York City and settling in the Bronx.

Jake&#x27;s father forced the boy to fight other boys in order to entertain neighborhood adults, who threw pocket change into the ring. LaMotta&#x27;s father collected the money and used it to help pay the rent. One of LaMotta&#x27;s cousins on his father&#x27;s side was Richard LaMotta, who became an entrepreneur and creator of the Chipwich ice cream treat.

LaMotta learned to box while in a reformatory in upstate New York, where he&#x27;d been sent for attempted robbery. Afterward he fought undefeated in amateur bouts, turning professional at age 19 in 1941. During World War II, he was rejected for military service due to a childhood mastoid operation on one of his ears which affected his hearing.

==Boxing career==
As a middleweight in his first fifteen bouts, LaMotta went 14–0–1 (3 KOs) before losing a highly controversial split decision to Jimmy Reeves in Reeves&#x27; hometown of Cleveland, Ohio. Chaos erupted after the decision was announced. Fights broke out around the ring and the crowd continued to boo for 20 minutes. The arena&#x27;s organist tried (but failed) to calm down the crowd by playing the &quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot;.

One month later, LaMotta and Reeves fought again in the same arena. LaMotta lost a much less controversial decision. A third match between the two took place on March 19, 1943, in Detroit, Michigan. The first five rounds were close, though Reeves was struggling in the fourth. In the sixth round, LaMotta floored Reeves, who was only down for a second. Once the fight resumed, LaMotta landed a left on Reeves&#x27; chin, sending him down face-first. Reeves was blinking his eyes and shaking his head as the referee counted him out.

===LaMotta vs. Robinson I–V===

LaMotta fought Sugar Ray Robinson in Robinson&#x27;s middleweight debut at Madison Square Garden, New York City, October 2, 1942. LaMotta knocked Robinson down in the first round of the fight. Robinson got up and took control over much of the fight, winning via a unanimous 10-round decision.

A 10-round rematch took place February 5, 1943, at Olympia Stadium in Detroit, Michigan. In the eighth round, LaMotta landed a right to Robinson&#x27;s head and a left to his body, sending him through the ropes. Robinson was saved by the bell at the count of nine. LaMotta, who was already leading on the scorecards before knocking Robinson out of the ring, pummeled and outpointed him for the rest of the fight. Robinson had trouble keeping LaMotta at bay. LaMotta won via unanimous decision, giving Robinson the first defeat of his career.

The victory was short-lived, as the two met on February 26, 1943, in what was another 10-round fight, once again at Olympia Stadium in Robinson&#x27;s former home of Detroit. Robinson was knocked down for a nine-count in Round 7. Robinson later stated, &quot;He really hurt me with a left in the seventh round. I was a little dazed and decided to stay on the deck.&quot; Robinson won the close fight by unanimous decision, using a dazzling left jab and jarring uppercuts. LaMotta said the fight was given to Robinson because he would be inducted into the army the next day.

A fourth fight, the duo&#x27;s final 10 rounder, took place nearly two years after the third, on February 23, 1945, at Madison Square Garden, New York. Robinson won again by a unanimous decision.

LaMotta and Robinson had their fifth bout at Comiskey Park, Chicago, Illinois on September 26, 1945. Robinson won by a very controversial split decision, contested over 12 rounds. The decision was severely booed by the 14,755 people in attendance. LaMotta later said in his autobiography that the decision was widely criticized by several newspapers and boxing publishers. Robinson said afterward, &quot;This was the toughest fight I&#x27;ve ever had with LaMotta.&quot;

===LaMotta vs. Fox===
On November 14, 1947, LaMotta was knocked out in the fourth round by Billy Fox. Suspecting the fight was fixed, the New York State Athletic Commission withheld purses for the fight and suspended LaMotta. The fight with Fox would come back to haunt him later in life, during a case with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

In his testimony and in his later book, LaMotta admitted to throwing the fight to gain favor with the Mafia. All involved agreed the fix was obvious and their staging inept.

As LaMotta wrote,
The first round, a couple of belts to his head, and I see a glassy look coming over his eyes. Jesus Christ, a couple of jabs and he&#x27;s going to fall down? I began to panic a little. I was supposed to be throwing a fight to this guy, and it looked like I was going to end up holding him on his feet... By [the fourth round], if there was anybody in the Garden who didn&#x27;t know what was happening, he must have been dead drunk.

The thrown fight and a payment of $20,000 to the Mafia got LaMotta his title bout against World Middleweight Champion Marcel Cerdan.

===LaMotta vs. Cerdan===
LaMotta won the World Middleweight title on June 16, 1949, in Detroit, Michigan, defeating Frenchman Marcel Cerdan. LaMotta won the first round (in which he knocked Cerdan down), Cerdan the second, and the third was even. At that point it became clear something was wrong. Cerdan dislocated his arm in the first round, apparently damaged in the knockdown, and gave up before the start of the 10th round. LaMotta damaged his left hand in the fifth round, but still landed 104 punches in the ninth round, whereas Cerdan hardly threw a punch. The official score had LaMotta as winner by a knockout in 10 rounds because the bell had already rung to begin that round when Cerdan announced he was quitting. A rematch was arranged, but while Cerdan was flying back to the United States to fight the rematch, his Air France Lockheed Constellation crashed in the Azores, killing everyone on board.

===World Middleweight Champion===
LaMotta made his first title defense against Tiberio Mitri on July 7, 1950, at Madison Square Garden, New York. LaMotta retained his title via unanimous decision. LaMotta&#x27;s next defense came on September 13, 1950, against Laurent Dauthuille. Dauthuille had previously beaten LaMotta by decision before LaMotta became world champion. By the fifteenth round, Dauthuille was ahead on all scorecards (72–68, 74–66, 71–69) and seemed to be about to repeat a victory against LaMotta. LaMotta hit Dauthuille with a barrage of punches that sent him down against the ropes toward the end of the round. Dauthuille was counted out with 13 seconds left in the fight. This fight was named Fight of the Year for 1950 by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine.

===Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre of boxing===

The sixth and final fight between LaMotta and Robinson took place at Chicago Stadium. This fight was scheduled for 15 rounds and was for the middleweight title. Held on February 14, 1951, Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day, the fight became known as boxing&#x27;s version of the Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre. In the last few rounds, LaMotta began to take a horrible beating and was soon unable to defend himself from Robinson&#x27;s powerful blows. But LaMotta refused to go down. Robinson won by a technical knockout in the 13th round, when the fight was stopped.

===Light heavyweight===
LaMotta moved up to light heavyweight after losing his world middleweight title. He had poor results at first. He lost his debut against Bob Murphy, lost a split decision to Norman Hayes, and drew with Gene Hairston in his first three bouts. In his next three fights, LaMotta had rematches with Hayes, Hairston, and Murphy, and defeated all of them by unanimous decisions.

On December 31, 1952, LaMotta had his next fight against Danny Nardico. He knocked LaMotta down for the only time in his career (not counting his thrown 1947 fight) by a right hand in the seventh round. LaMotta got up and was beaten against a corner by Nardico until the bell rang. LaMotta&#x27;s corner stopped the bout before the eighth round began.

Following that fight, LaMotta took time off; when he returned, in early 1954, he knocked out his first two opponents, Johnny Pretzie (TKO 4) and Al McCoy (KO 1), but a controversial split decision loss to Billy Kilgore on April 14, 1954, convinced him to retire.

==Post-boxing==
After retiring from the ring, LaMotta owned and managed a bar at 1120 Collins Ave in Miami Beach. He also became a stage actor and comedian. In 1958 he was arrested and charged with introducing men to an underage girl at a club he owned in Miami. He was convicted and served six months on a chain gang, although he maintained his innocence.

In 1960 LaMotta was called to testify before a U.S. Senate sub-committee that was looking into underworld influence on boxing. He testified that he had thrown his bout with Billy Fox so that the mob would arrange a title bout for him.

LaMotta appeared in more than 15 films, including &quot;The Hustler&quot; (1961) with Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason, in which he had a role as a bartender. He appeared in several episodes of the NBC police comedy &quot;Car 54 Where Are You?&quot; (1961–63). A lifelong baseball fan, he organized the Jake LaMotta All-Star Team in the Bronx. The LaMotta team played in Sterling Oval which was located between 165th and 164th Streets between Clay and Teller Avenue.

In 1965, LaMotta appeared as &quot;Big Jule&quot; in the New York City Center production of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; for 15 performances alongside Alan King and Jerry Orbach.

==Fighting style==
LaMotta is recognized as having had one of the best chins in boxing. He rolled with punches, minimizing their force and damage when they landed, but he was also able to absorb many blows. In the Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre, his sixth bout with Robinson, LaMotta suffered numerous severe blows to the head. Commentators could be heard saying &quot;No man can take this kind of punishment!&quot; But LaMotta did not go down. The fight was stopped by the referee in the 13th round, declaring it a TKO victory for Robinson.

LaMotta was one of the first boxers to adopt the &quot;bully&quot; style of fighting, in that he always stayed close and in punching range of his opponent, by stalking him around the ring, and sacrificed taking punches himself in order to land his own shots. Due to his aggressive, unrelenting style he was known as &quot;The Bronx Bull&quot;. He boasted &quot;No son-of-a-bitch ever knocked me off my feet&quot;, but that claim was ended in December 1952 at the hands of Danny Nardico when Nardico caught him with a hard right in the seventh round. LaMotta fell into the ropes and went down. After regaining his footing, he was unable to come out for the next round.

==&quot;Raging Bull: My Story&quot;==
&quot;Raging Bull: My Story&quot; is a 1970 second edition of LaMotta&#x27;s memoir. The autobiographical details include his life as a young teenage criminal; his reformation in prison; his extensive career as an amateur and professional boxer; his struggles with organized crime who kept a boxing title out of reach; and his jealous obsession with his wife, Vikki. The book details his life, from childhood until the end of his fame.

The first edition is:
*La Motta, Jake with Carter, Joseph and Savage, Peter (1970). &quot;Raging Bull: My Story&quot;. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall [1970]. .

==&quot;Raging Bull&quot;==

Hollywood executives approached LaMotta with the idea of a movie about his life, based on his 1970 memoir &quot;Raging Bull: My Story&quot;. The film, &quot;Raging Bull&quot;, released in 1980, was a box-office bomb, but eventually received overwhelming critical acclaim for both director Martin Scorsese and actor Robert De Niro, who gained about 60 pounds during the shooting of the film to play the older LaMotta in later scenes.

To accurately portray the younger LaMotta, De Niro trained with LaMotta until LaMotta felt he was ready to box professionally. De Niro lived in Paris for three months, eating at the finest restaurants in order to gain sufficient weight to portray LaMotta after retirement. De Niro won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance.

==Later life==

LaMotta had a troubled personal life, including an early spell in a reformatory, and was married seven times. He admitted to having raped a woman, having beaten his wives and coming close to beating a man to death during a robbery.

In February 1998, LaMotta&#x27;s elder son, Jake LaMotta Jr., died of liver cancer. In September 1998, his younger son, Joseph LaMotta, died in the crash of Swissair Flight 111.

His nephew, John LaMotta, fought in the heavyweight-novice class of the 2001 Golden Gloves championship tournament. John later became an actor, and one of his roles was as &quot;Duke&quot;, who ran the bar of that name featured in the television comedy series &quot;Frasier&quot;. Another nephew, William Lustig, is a well-known director and producer of horror films and the president of Blue Underground, Inc.

LaMotta had four daughters, including Christi by his second wife Vikki LaMotta and Stephanie by his fourth wife Dimitria. He married his seventh wife, his longtime fiancée Denise Baker, on January 4, 2013. LaMotta remained active on the speaking and autograph circuit, and published several books about his career, his life, and his fights with Robinson.

LaMotta appeared in a 50-minute New York City stage production, &quot;Lady and the Champ&quot;, in July 2012. The production focused on LaMotta&#x27;s boxing career, and was criticized by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as poorly executed and a &quot;bizarre debacle&quot;.

LaMotta is the subject of a documentary directed and produced by Greg Olliver. The film features an appearance by Mike Tyson among other notable athletes, actors and Jake&#x27;s family and friends. Also in production was a sequel to &quot;Raging Bull&quot;, although MGM filed suit to halt the project, saying that LaMotta did not have the right to make a sequel. The lawsuit was settled on July 31, 2012, when LaMotta agreed to change the title of the film to &quot;The Bronx Bull&quot;.

&quot;LaMotta: The Bronx Bull&quot; stars actor William Forsythe as LaMotta, while Paul Sorvino plays his father. It also features Joe Mantegna, Tom Sizemore, Penelope Ann Miller, Natasha Henstridge, Joey Diaz and Ray Wise.

==Death==
LaMotta died on September 19, 2017, from complications of pneumonia in a nursing home in Florida, at the age of 95.

<text>George Inness (May 1, 1825 – August 3, 1894) was an American landscape painter.

Now recognized as one of the most influential American artists of the nineteenth century, Inness was influenced by the Hudson River School at the start of his career. He also studied the Old Masters, and artists of the Barbizon school during later trips to Europe. There he was introduced to the theology of Emanuel Swedenborg, which was significant for him; he expressed that spiritualism in the works of his maturity (1879–1894).

Although Inness&#x27;s style evolved through distinct stages over a prolific career that spanned more than forty years and 1,000 paintings, his works consistently earned acclaim for their powerful, coordinated efforts to elicit depth of mood, atmosphere, and emotion. Neither pure realist nor impressionist, Inness was a transitional figure. He worked to combine both the earthly and the ethereal in order to capture the complete essence of a locale in his works. A master of light, color, and shadow, he became noted for creating highly ordered and complex scenes that often juxtaposed hazy or blurred elements with sharp and refined details to evoke an interweaving of both the physical and the spiritual nature of experience. In Inness&#x27;s words, he attempted through his art to demonstrate the &quot;reality of the unseen&quot; and to connect the &quot;visible upon the invisible.&quot;

Within his lifetime, art critics hailed Inness as one of America&#x27;s greatest artists. Often called &quot;the father of American landscape painting,&quot; Inness is best known for his mature works that not only exemplified the Tonalist movement but also displayed an original and uniquely American style.

==Youth==
George Inness was born in Newburgh, New York. He was the fifth of thirteen children born to John William Inness, a farmer, and his wife, Clarissa Baldwin.

His family moved to Newark, New Jersey when he was about five years of age. In 1839 he studied for several months with an itinerant painter, John Jesse Barker.

In his teens, Inness worked as a map engraver in New York City, first for Sherman &amp; Smith, and then N. Currier. During this time he attracted the attention of French landscape painter Régis François Gignoux, with whom he subsequently studied. Throughout the mid-1840s he also attended classes at the National Academy of Design, and studied the work of Hudson River School artists Thomas Cole and Asher Durand; &quot;If,&quot; Inness later recalled thinking, &quot;these two can be combined, I will try.&quot; He debuted his work at the National Academy in 1844.

Inness opened his first studio in New York in 1848. In 1849, he married Delia Miller, who died a few months later. The next year he married Elizabeth Abigail Hart, with whom he would have six children.

==Early career==

In 1851 a patron named Ogden Haggerty sponsored Inness&#x27;s first trip to Europe to paint and study. Inness spent fifteen months in Rome, where he studied landscapes by French artists Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin. He rented a studio there above that of painter William Page, who likely introduced the artist to Swedenborgianism. He returned to America with his wife on the &quot;SS Great Britain&quot; in May 1852. In 1853 he was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1868.

During trips to Paris in the early 1850s, Inness came under the influence of artists working in the Barbizon school of France. Barbizon landscapes were noted for their looser brushwork, darker palette, and emphasis on mood. Inness quickly became the leading American exponent of Barbizon-style painting, which he developed into a highly personal style. In 1854 during one of these trips, his son George Inness, Jr., who also became a landscape painter of note, was born in Paris.

In the mid-1850s, Inness was commissioned by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad to create paintings which documented the progress of DLWRR&#x27;s growth in early Industrial America. &quot;The Lackawanna Valley&quot;, painted c. 1855, represents the railroad&#x27;s first roundhouse at Scranton, Pennsylvania. It integrates technology and wilderness within an observed landscape; in time, not only would Inness shun the industrial presence in favor of bucolic or agrarian subjects, but he would produce much of his mature work in the studio, drawing on his visual memory to produce scenes that were often inspired by specific places. But the artist was increasingly concerned with formal considerations.

==Mid-career==
Inness moved from New York City to Medfield, Massachusetts in 1860, where he converted a barn into a studio. In 1862–63, he was an art teacher to Charles Dormon Robinson, who became known for works of California.

Inness moved to Perth Amboy, New Jersey in 1864. (See George Inness House.) He returned to Europe in the spring of 1870, living in Rome and touring Tivoli, Lake Albano, and Venice. In 1878, he returned to New York City, taking a studio in the New York University Building. The same year, he also participated in the Universal Exposition in Paris. In addition to painting, he published art criticism in the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s New Monthly Magazine&quot;.

His work of the 1860s and 1870s often tended toward the panoramic and picturesque, topped by cloud-laden and threatening skies. It included views of his native country (&quot;Autumn Oaks&quot;, 1878, Metropolitan Museum of Art; &quot;Catskill Mountains&quot;, 1870, Art Institute of Chicago), as well as scenes inspired by numerous travels overseas, especially to Italy and France (&quot;The Monk&quot;, 1873, Addison Gallery of American Art; &quot;Etretat&quot;, 1875, Wadsworth Atheneum). In terms of composition, precision of drawing, and the emotive use of color, these paintings placed Inness among the best and most successful landscape painters in America.

In 1877 Inness built a home and studio at Tarpon Springs, Florida. He ignored the characteristic palm and painted what some considered the drab pine woods. His painting &quot;Early Morning – Tarpon Springs&quot; depicts this environment.

Eventually Inness&#x27;s art expressed the influence of the theology of Emanuel Swedenborg. Of particular interest to Inness was the notion that everything in nature had a corresponding relationship with something spiritual and so received an &quot;influx&quot; from God in order to continually exist. Another influence upon Inness&#x27;s thinking was William James, also an adherent of Swedenborgianism. In particular, Inness was inspired by James&#x27;s idea of consciousness as a &quot;stream of thought&quot;, as well as his ideas concerning how mystical experience shapes one&#x27;s perspective toward nature.

Inness was the subject of a major retrospective in 1884, organized by the American Art Association, which brought him acclaim in the United States. He earned international fame when he received a gold medal at the 1889 Paris Exposition.

==Late career==
After Inness settled in Montclair, New Jersey in 1885, and particularly in the last decade of his life, he expressed this mystical component by a more abstracted handling of shapes, softened edges, and saturated color (&quot;October&quot;, 1886, Los Angeles County Museum of Art), a profound and dramatic juxtaposition of sky and earth (&quot;Early Autumn, Montclair&quot;, 1888, Montclair Art Museum), an emphasis on the intimate landscape view (&quot;Sunset in the Woods&quot;, 1891, Corcoran Gallery of Art), and an increasingly personal, spontaneous, and often violent handling of paint. It is this last quality in particular which distinguishes Inness from those painters of like sympathies who are characterized as Luminists.

In a published interview, Inness maintained that &quot;The true use of art is, first, to cultivate the artist&#x27;s own spiritual nature.&quot; His abiding interest in spiritual and emotional considerations did not preclude Inness from undertaking a scientific study of color, nor a mathematical, structural approach to composition: &quot;The poetic quality is not obtained by eschewing any truths of fact or of Nature...Poetry is the vision of reality.&quot;

Inness died in 1894 at Bridge of Allan in Scotland. According to his son, he was viewing the sunset, when he &quot;threw up his hands into the air and exclaimed, &quot;My God! oh, how beautiful!&quot;&quot;, fell to the ground, and died minutes later. A public funeral for Inness was held at the National Academy of Design. A memorial exhibition was conducted at the Fine Arts Building in New York City.

He is buried in Montclair, New Jersey&#x27;s Rosedale Cemetery, as is his namesake son. The Montclair Art Museum is the only museum in the world that has a gallery dedicated to Inness and as of 2023 has a renowned collection of 24 works by Inness.

<doc id="149831" wikidata="Q162335" url="?curid=149831" title="Red Sonja">
<text>Red Sonja is a sword-and-sorcery character created by writer Roy Thomas and artist Barry Windsor-Smith for Marvel Comics in 1973, partially inspired by Robert E. Howard&#x27;s character Red Sonya of Rogatino.

Marvel Comics published stories featuring Red Sonja until 1986, and returned to the character for a one-shot story in 1995. In 2005, Dynamite Entertainment began publishing stories of the heroine, during which the original Sonja was killed and replaced by a &quot;reincarnation&quot;. The series was rebooted by writer Gail Simone in 2013, telling an altered version of Red Sonja&#x27;s early life story via flashbacks. Subsequent writers of &quot;Red Sonja&quot; have included Amy Chu, Mark Russell, Luke Lieberman, Jimmy Palmiotti, and Amanda Conner, among others.

Red Sonja has appeared in numerous titles, both as a solo protagonist and together with Conan, as well as in crossovers with characters from Marvel Comics and Dynamite Comics. A total of six Red Sonja novels were published from 1981 to 1983 by David C. Smith and Richard L. Tierney, and a feature film starring Brigitte Nielsen in the title role, &quot;Red Sonja&quot;, was released in 1985.

Sonja&#x27;s signature clothing is her bikini armor, consisting typically of scale mail. In 2011, Red Sonja was ranked first in &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&#x27;s&quot; &quot;100 Sexiest Women in Comics&quot; list.

==History==
===Marvel Comics (1973–1995)===
Red Sonja was created by writer Roy Thomas and artist Barry Windsor-Smith for Marvel Comics in 1973, partially based on Red Sonya, a female swashbuckler from &quot;The Shadow of the Vulture&quot;.

Red Sonja debuted in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; #23 (1973). Thomas created a new origin story and transposed the timeline from the 16th century of Howard&#x27;s original Red Sonya to the Hyborian Age, another Howard creation, to have Sonja interact with Conan the Barbarian. In 1975, Marvel Comics published the first issue of &quot;Red Sonja&quot; after the character headlined &quot;Marvel Feature&quot; for seven issues that same year.

Red Sonja&#x27;s origin story was told in the story &quot;The Day of the Sword&quot; in the Marvel magazine &quot;Kull and the Barbarians&quot; #3 (1975), written by Roy Thomas and Doug Moench and illustrated by Howard Chaykin. The same story was later redrawn by Dick Giordano and Terry Austin and published in the magazine &quot;The Savage Sword of Conan&quot; #78 (July 1982). In this version, Red Sonja lives with her family in the Western Hyrkanian steppes. When she is 21, a group of mercenaries kills her family and burns down their house. Sonja attempts to defend herself, but cannot lift her brother&#x27;s sword. She is raped by the leader of the group. Answering her cry for revenge, the red goddess Scáthach appears to her and gives her incredible fighting skills, on the condition that she never lie with a man unless he defeats her in fair combat.

In 1983, Marvel Comics published a second Red Sonja series, a two-issue story written by Christy Marx and Roy Thomas, with art by Tony DeZuniga and Ernie Colón. The story also featured an appearance by the Robert E. Howard heroine Valeria.

That same year, Marvel launched a third series, running thirteen issues. Writers included Tom DeFalco, Bill Mantlo, and Louise Simonson, with art by Mary Wilshire, Pat Broderick, and Rudy Nebres, among others.

In 1985, Marvel published a two issue adaptation of the &quot;Red Sonja&quot; film starring Brigitte Nielsen. The adaptation was written by Louise Simonson and Mary Wilshire, with art by Mary Wilshire and Vince Colletta.

In 1995, Marvel published the one-shot issue &quot;Red Sonja: Scavenger Hunt&quot;, written by Glenn Herdling and illustrated by Ken Lashley.

In 2007, Marvel teamed with Dynamite Comics to publish &quot;Spider-Man Red Sonja&quot;, a five-issue series written by Michael Avon Oeming with art by Mel Rubi.

===Dynamite Comics (2005–present)===
In 2005, Dynamite Comics began publishing &quot;Red Sonja&quot;. The series debuted with an issue zero written by Michael Avon Oeming and Mike Carey and drawn by Mel Rubi. It depicted the original Sonja&#x27;s death in issue #34. A new character of the same name, described as a reincarnation, takes her place from issue #35 onward.

At the 2013 Emerald City Comic Con, Dynamite announced that Gail Simone would be writing a new ongoing &quot;Red Sonja&quot; series with art from Walter Geovani. Simone noted in interviews that her version was slightly &quot;rebooted&quot;, showing the character&#x27;s beginnings. Issue #1 of Simone&#x27;s run was released in July 2013 to positive reviews. The series lasted 18 issues. After Simone&#x27;s run, Dynamite launched a new &quot;Red Sonja&quot; series in January 2016. The book featured Marguerite Bennett as writer, and a redesign of the character by artist Nicola Scott. That series lasted six issues.

In December 2017, a new &quot;Red Sonja&quot; comic series debuted with a zero issue priced at 25 cents by writer Amy Chu with art by Carlos Gomez. The series ran for 25 issues, ending in 2019.

In November 2019, a new series by writer Mark Russell and art by Mirko Colak debuted to positive critical reception, leading into a spinoff series called &quot;Killing Red Sonja&quot;. Russell left the series after issue 24 and was replaced with writer Luke Lieberman, with art by Drew Moss. The series ran 28 issues.

In mid-2021, Dynamite released the anthology &quot;Red Sonja: Black, White, Red&quot;. Each issue presents stories by different teams of artists and writers, including Kurt Busiek, Benjamin Dewey, Amanda Deibert, Cat Staggs, Mark Russell, and Bob Q. Also announced was a crossover with Project superpower. A sequel to it will be released in November 2022 called Vampirella VS Red Sonja.

In February 2021, Dynamite released a series titled &quot;Sonjaversal&quot;, depicting Red Sonja meeting her multiversal counterparts. That same month, Amanda Conner and Jimmy Palmiotti co-wrote the series &quot;Invincible Red Sonja&quot; with artist Moritat.

In June 2021, the character appeared in &quot;Die!namite&quot; and &quot;Die!namite Lives&quot;. That same month, Dynamite Entertainment announced that a new series written by Mirka Andolfo and drawn by Giuseppe Cafaro would debut in September 2021. The first issue sold out its initial run of 32,000 copies, prompting a second printing.

In December 2021, it was announced that Red Sonja would appear in the sequel to &quot;Die!namite&quot; and &quot;Die!namite Lives&quot; called &quot;Die!namite Never Dies&quot;.

&quot;Hell Sonja,&quot; a spinoff from &quot;Sonjaversal,&quot; was released in January 2022. That same month, the &quot;Immortal Red Sonja&quot; series by writer Dan Abnett and artist Alessandro Miracolo was announced for April, which would depict Sonja in King Arthur&#x27;s Camelot. In February 2022, Dynamite announced that it would debut &quot;Red Sitha&quot; in May, set ten years after Andolfo&#x27;s storyline, following Red Sonja&#x27;s adopted daughter, Sitha.

In March 2022, Dynamite announced another spinoff titled from Sonjaversal, &quot;Samurai Sonja&quot;, written by Jordan Clark with art by Pasquale Qualano. In August, a one-shot fairy tale reimagining Red Sonja as Jack from Jack and the Beanstalk was released. &quot;Unbreakable Red Sonja&quot; was released in October 2022, and the crossover series &quot;Hell Sonja/Red Sonja&quot; was released in December the same year.

In April 2023, Dynamite announced that it would debut the next ongoing &quot;Red Sonja&quot; series by writer Torunn Grønbekk and artist Walter Geovani in celebration of the character&#x27;s 50th anniversary. The first issue, released in July, featured dozens of variant covers by artists including Jim Cheung, Bryan Hitch, Mike Mignola, Joseph Michael Linsner, Jenny Frison, Frank Cho, and Kevin Eastman.

&quot;Savage Red Sonja&quot; by Dan Panosian and Alessio Petillo was released in November 2023, followed by &quot;Red Sonja: Empire of the Damned&quot; by Steve Niles and Alessandro Amoruso in April 2024. The sequel to &quot;Red Sonja: Birth of the She-devil&quot; called &quot;Red Sonja: Death and the Devil&quot; was released in September 2024.

== Depiction of sexuality ==
=== Bikini armor ===
Most artists depict Red Sonja wearing a very brief &quot;chainmail bikini&quot; costume of scale armor, usually with boots and gauntlets. As originally drawn by Barry Windsor-Smith for &quot;The Shadow of the Vulture&quot; and &quot;The Song of Red Sonja&quot; in &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; issues 23 and 24 (1972), she wore a long-sleeved mail shirt and short pants of red silk.

As told by Roy Thomas in the introduction of &quot;Red Sonja Adventures&quot; Volume 1 (Dynamite Entertainment), Spanish artist Esteban Maroto submitted an uncommissioned illustration to him while Thomas was editing the magazine &quot;Savage Sword of Conan&quot;. The illustration featured a redesigned silver &quot;metal bikini&quot;, which resembled fantasy costumes that other Maroto heroines sported in the 1970s. This illustration was printed for the first time in Jim Steranko&#x27;s magazine &quot;Comixscene&quot; #5 in black and white. It was reprinted in &quot;Savage Sword of Conan&quot; #1, then in &quot;Marvel Treasury Edition&quot; #15 in color, and later restored and colored by José Villarrubia as an alternative cover for the Dynamite Entertainment edition of &quot;Red Sonja&quot; #2. Maroto drew her in this costume for a double page spread illustration in &quot;Savage Tales&quot; #3 and then for her first solo adventure in &quot;Savage Sword of Conan&quot; #1. John Buscema drew her in this costume in the same magazine and in issues 43, 44, and 48 of &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; (1974). Dick Giordano portrayed Sonja in the bikini for the first issue of &quot;Marvel Feature&quot; vol. 2 (Nov. 1975) before Frank Thorne took over from issue #2 (Jan. 1976).

=== Bisexuality ===
In 2016, author Gail Simone indicated that Sonja was bisexual during her run. In 2020, the series &quot;Red Sonja: The Price of Blood&quot; by writer Luke Lieberman and artist Walter Geovani corroborated this, depicting Sonja as having slept with a woman. In 2024, Simone&#x27;s novel &quot;Red Sonja: Consumed&quot; portrays the character as having both male and female lovers.

<doc id="149832" wikidata="Q221117" url="?curid=149832" title="Leitmotif">
<text>A leitmotif or  () is a &quot;short, recurring musical phrase&quot; associated with a particular person, place, or idea. It is closely related to the musical concepts of &quot;idée fixe&quot; or &quot;motto-theme&quot;. The spelling &quot;leitmotif&quot; is a partial anglicization of the German &quot;&quot; (), literally meaning &quot;leading motif&quot;, or &quot;guiding motif&quot;. A musical motif has been defined as a &quot;short musical idea ... melodic, harmonic, or rhythmic, or all three&quot;, a salient recurring figure, musical fragment or succession of notes that has some special importance in or is characteristic of a composition: &quot;the smallest structural unit possessing thematic identity&quot;.

In particular, such a motif should be &quot;clearly identified so as to retain its identity if modified on subsequent appearances&quot; whether such modification be in terms of rhythm, harmony, orchestration or accompaniment. It may also be &quot;combined with other leitmotifs to suggest a new dramatic condition&quot; or development. The technique is notably associated with the operas of Richard Wagner, and most especially his &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, although he was not its originator and did not employ the word in connection with his work.

Although usually a short melody, it can also be a chord progression or even a simple rhythm. Leitmotifs can help to bind a work together into a coherent whole, and also enable the composer to relate a story without the use of words, or to add an extra level to an already present story.

By association, the word has also been used to mean any sort of recurring theme (whether or not subject to developmental transformation) in literature, or (metaphorically) the life of a fictional character or a real person. It is sometimes also used in discussion of other musical genres, such as instrumental pieces, cinema, and video game music, sometimes interchangeably with the more general category of &quot;theme&quot;.

==Classical music==

===Early instances in classical music===
The use of characteristic, short, recurring motifs in orchestral music can be traced back to the early seventeenth century, such as &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; by Monteverdi. In French opera of the late eighteenth century (such as the works of Gluck, Grétry and Méhul), &quot;reminiscence motif&quot; can be identified, which may recur at a significant juncture in the plot to establish an association with earlier events. Their use, however, is not extensive or systematic. The power of the technique was exploited early in the nineteenth century by composers of Romantic opera, such as Carl Maria von Weber, where recurring themes or ideas were sometimes used in association with specific characters (e.g. Samiel in &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; is coupled with the chord of a diminished seventh). The first use of the word &quot;leitmotif&quot; in print was by the critic Friedrich Wilhelm Jähns in describing Weber&#x27;s work, although this was not until 1871.

Motifs also figured occasionally in purely instrumental music of the Romantic period. The related idea of a musical &quot;idée fixe&quot; (i.e. the object of fixation — a term borrowed from medicine and also found in literary works of the period) was employed by Hector Berlioz in his &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; (1830). This purely instrumental, programmatic work (subtitled &quot;Episode in the Life of an Artist ... in Five Sections&quot;) features a recurring melody representing the object of the artist&#x27;s obsessive affection and depicting his presence in various real and imagined situations.

Though perhaps not corresponding to the strict definition of leitmotif, several of Verdi&#x27;s operas feature similar thematic tunes, often introduced in the overtures or preludes, and recurring to mark the presence of a character or to invoke a particular sentiment. In &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, the opening theme of the overture recurs whenever Leonora feels guilt or fear. In &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, the theme of the first aria by Azucena is repeated whenever she invokes the horror of how her mother was burnt alive and the devastating revenge she attempted then. In &quot;Don Carlos&quot;, there are at least three leitmotifs that recur regularly across the five acts: the first is associated with the poverty and suffering from war, the second is associated with prayers around the tomb of Carlos V, and the third is introduced as a duet between Don Carlo and the Marquis of Posa, thereafter accentuating sentiments of sincere friendship and loyalty.

===Wagner===


Richard Wagner is the earliest composer most specifically associated with the concept of leitmotif. His cycle of four operas, &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; (the music for which was written between 1853 and 1869), uses hundreds of leitmotifs, often related to specific characters, things, or situations. While some of these leitmotifs occur in only one of the operas, many recur throughout the entire cycle. Wagner had raised the issue of how music could best unite disparate elements of the plot of a music drama in his essay &quot;Opera and Drama&quot; (1851); the leitmotif technique corresponds to this ideal.

Some controversy surrounded the use of the word in Wagner&#x27;s own circle: Wagner never authorised the use of the word , using words such as (basic idea), or simply . His preferred name for the technique was (principal motif), which he first used in 1877; the only time he used the word , he referred to &quot;so-called Leitmotivs&quot;.

The word gained currency with the overly literal interpretations of Wagner&#x27;s music by Hans von Wolzogen, who in 1876 published a &quot;Leitfaden&quot; (guide or manual) to the &quot;Ring&quot;. In it he claimed to have isolated and named all of the recurring motifs in the cycle (the motif of &quot;Servitude&quot;, the &quot;Spear&quot; or &quot;Treaty&quot; motif, etc.), often leading to absurdities or contradictions with Wagner&#x27;s actual practice. Some of the motifs he identified began to appear in the published musical scores of the operas, arousing Wagner&#x27;s annoyance; his wife Cosima Wagner quoted him as saying &quot;People will think all this nonsense is done at my request!&quot;. In fact Wagner himself never publicly named any of his leitmotifs, preferring to emphasize their flexibility of association, role in the musical form, and emotional effect. The practice of naming leitmotifs nevertheless continued, featuring in the work of prominent Wagnerian critics Ernest Newman, Deryck Cooke and Robert Donington.

The resulting lists of leitmotifs also attracted the ridicule of anti-Wagnerian critics and composers (such as Eduard Hanslick, Claude Debussy, and Igor Stravinsky). They identified the motif with Wagner&#x27;s own approach to composing, mocking the impression of a musical &quot;address book&quot; or list of &quot;cloakroom numbers&quot; it created.

However, later commentators have defended Wagner&#x27;s use of the leitmotif. According to Pierre Boulez, &quot;Wagner&#x27;s was the first music in which forms never return literally, are never repeated. As the music progresses, it carries all the thematic elements with it, linking them in new ways, placing them in different relations to each other, showing them in unfamiliar lights and giving them unexpected meanings.&quot; Boulez adds: &quot;&quot;Leitmotivs&quot; are in fact anything but the traffic signals to which they have been mistakenly compared, for they have a double virtue – both poetic and dramatic, as well as formal. They are essential to the structure of both music and drama as well as to the different characters and situations. Their evolution is a kind of &#x27;time-weave&#x27;, an integrating of past and present; and they also imply dramatic progression.&quot;

===After Wagner===
Since Wagner, the use of leitmotifs has been taken up by many other composers. Richard Strauss used the device in many of his operas and several of his symphonic poems. Despite his sometimes acerbic comments on Wagner, Claude Debussy utilized leitmotifs in his opera &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; (1902). Arnold Schoenberg used a complex set of leitmotifs in his choral work &quot;Gurre-Lieder&quot; (completed 1911). Alban Berg&#x27;s opera &quot;Wozzeck&quot; (1914–1922) also utilizes leitmotifs. The leitmotif was also a major feature of the opera &quot;The Immortal Hour&quot; by the English composer Rutland Boughton. His constantly recurrent, memorably tuneful leitmotifs contributed significantly to the widespread popularity of the opera. In Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; (1936) each character or animal has its own leitmotif played on a particular instrument.

===Critique of the leitmotif concept===
The critic Theodor W. Adorno, in his book &quot;In Search of Wagner&quot; (written in the 1930s), expresses the opinion that the entire concept of the leitmotif is flawed. The motif cannot be both the bearer of expression and a musical &quot;gesture&quot;, because that reduces emotional content to a mechanical process. He notes that &quot;even in Wagner&#x27;s own day the public made a crude link between the leitmotifs and the persons they characterised&quot; because people&#x27;s innate mental processes did not necessarily correspond with Wagner&#x27;s subtle intentions or optimistic expectations. He continues:
The degeneration of the is implicit in this ... it leads directly to cinema music where the sole function of the leitmotif is to announce heroes or situations so as to allow the audience to orient itself more easily.

==Entertainment==

*The movie &quot;M (1931)&quot; was one of the first to use a leitmotif. The main character, a child serial killer, whistles &quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot; by Edvard Grieg and he is associated with this song throughout the movie.
*In the &quot;Jaws&quot; franchise, the main &quot;shark&quot; theme, composed by John Williams in 1975, stands out as a suspenseful motif that is a simple alternating pattern of two notes, E and F.
*In the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film in 1977, John Williams used a large number of themes specifically associated with people and concepts, and he would expand upon this concept for the following films of the original trilogy (for example, a particular motif is attached to the presence of Darth Vader, another to the concept of the Death Star, and another to the concept of the Force). Williams would later revisit this material for the prequel trilogy starting in 1999, and then again for the sequel trilogy starting in 2015, each time crafting new themes while incorporating the old. Other composers would utilize some of Williams&#x27; iconic leitmotifs in spin-off material.
*In the 1989 film &quot;Batman&quot;, Danny Elfman composed the heroic theme for the titular character, which is also used in the later film.
*In &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), composer James Horner used a number of recurring leitmotifs that are associated with the film&#x27;s romance, tragedy and the disaster.
*John Williams composed the music for the first three &quot;Harry Potter&quot; movies starting in 2001, and leitmotifs are prominently utilized to represent specific characters, feelings, and locations, most notably the track entitled Hedwig&#x27;s Theme. While Williams did not score the rest of the franchise, this theme would consistently return in the scores of later composers Patrick Doyle, Nicholas Hooper, Alexandre Desplat, and James Newton Howard as they worked on the final films and spin-offs.
*In &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film series starting in 2001, composer Howard Shore prominently utilizes a vast amount of interconnecting leitmotifs to convey the ideas supporting specific characters, locations, and overall landscape of Middle-earth. His score is noteworthy because there is no singular &quot;main theme&quot; for the series, but a selection of several could hold this title, including the themes for the Fellowship, the Ring of Power, Lothlórien, the Shire, Isengard, Mordor, Rohan, and Gondor. Variations in these themes convey the changes that occur to the corresponding subjects throughout the trilogy. For the prequel &quot;Hobbit&quot; trilogy starting in 2012, Shore revisits some of these themes while introducing new leitmotifs for some of the new characters, and did so again for the show &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot; alongside Bear McCreary.
*Composed by Hans Zimmer, Klaus Badelt, and Geoff Zanelli, the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; film series consists of several motifs and themes associated with the protagonists, villains and moods starting in 2003. One prominent motif is &quot;He&#x27;s a Pirate&quot;, which is associated with pirates in general and the heroic action sequences they are involved in. Besides the general leitmotifs, specific characters such as Jack Sparrow, Davy Jones, Angelica, and Salazar each have their own unique motifs.
*&quot;The Dark Knight&quot; trilogy features several recurring themes and motifs for Batman, the villainous characters, and action scenes composed by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard starting in 2005.
*The original soundtrack of the 2009 video game &quot;Minecraft&quot; features a number of recognizable leitmotifs composed by C418, with its most prominent being the main melody featured in the soundtrack&#x27;s title track, &quot;Minecraft&quot;, which generally serves as a leitmotif for the overworld. The same melody appears throughout the soundtrack, such as in &quot;Door&quot; and &quot;Mutation&quot;. Other tracks with popular leitmotifs include &quot;Sweden&quot;, &quot;Wet Hands&quot;, &quot;Haggstrom&quot;, &quot;Subwoofer Lullaby&quot;, &quot;Mice on Venus&quot;, and &quot;Danny&quot;.
*While the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been criticized for its lack of iconic leitmotifs across its ever-expanding repertoire of films and shows, two recurring themes are prominently featured particularly towards the end of Phase Three: Alan Silvestri&#x27;s theme for the Avengers team and Ludwig Göransson&#x27;s theme for the Wakanda setting.
*Premiering in 2015, &quot;Hamilton: An American Musical&quot; uses several leitmotifs throughout to introduce characters and reinforce connections, composed and written primarily by Lin-Manuel Miranda. Almost all characters have a trademark leitmotif; for example, the way the name Alexander Hamilton is sung.
*In Toby Fox&#x27;s soundtrack for his video game &quot;Undertale&quot; (2015), which has been well received by critics as part of the success of the game, thematic and character connections are frequently portrayed using leitmotifs. In particular, &quot;Hopes and Dreams&quot; and &quot;SAVE the World&quot;, two of the game&#x27;s final boss themes, bring back many important leitmotifs heard throughout the game. Fox has continued his usage of leitmotifs in his followup game &quot;Deltarune&quot;’s soundtrack.

<text>The Association of MBAs (AMBA) is a global organisation headquartered in London, UK. It was founded in 1967 with the primary objective of accrediting Master of Business Administration (MBA) programs.

== Roles ==
Based in London, AMBA is one of the three main global accreditation bodies in business education (see triple accreditation) and styles itself as the world&#x27;s impartial authority on postgraduate management education. It differs from AACSB in the US and EQUIS in Brussels as it accredits a school&#x27;s portfolio of postgraduate management programmes but does not accredit undergraduate programmes. AMBA accredits approximately 2% of the world&#x27;s business schools, and is the most international of the three organisations having accredited schools headquartered in 54 countries, compared with the 52 for AACSB and 38 for EQUIS.

Business schools can become associated with AMBA by applying for accreditation or by applying to be part of the AMBA Development Network.

All MBA students and alumni of the 277 accredited member schools receive free life-long individual AMBA membership. AMBA also accredits generalist BBA programmes, MBA programmes and DBA programmes, and admits as members students and graduates thereof.

AMBA&#x27;s long-serving president until 2017 was the late Sir Paul Judge, the founding benefactor of Cambridge Judge Business School in Cambridge, UK. AMBA&#x27;s current Chief Executive is Andrew Main Wilson, who joined the organisation from the Institute of Directors in 2013. Bodo Schlegelmilch was elected Chairman of the AMBA Board of Trustees in 2018.

== History ==
The Association of MBAs was founded in 1967 as an MBA alumni club by eight UK graduates from Harvard Business School, Wharton, Stanford and Columbia, and two graduates from the first intake of London Business School. The founders saw a lack of awareness in Europe of the value of the MBA degree, which at that time was primarily an American qualification. They decided to form a lobby and membership group to promote the benefits of postgraduate business education, under the name of Business Graduates Association (BGA). The organisation&#x27;s development helped shape the growth of management education in Europe and the UK and coincided with the setting up and growth of London Business School and Manchester Business School in Britain.

The Association&#x27;s first Director General was Vice-Admiral David Clutterbuck who assumed this position in 1969. In 1983 BGA began to accredit the growing number of MBA programmes, while preserving its functions as a membership organization. BGA was renamed Association of MBAs in 1987. Until 2017, AMBA&#x27;s president was the late Sir Paul Judge, who helped establish Cambridge Judge Business School at Cambridge University in the early 1990s.

== Activities ==
=== Accreditation ===
The Association of MBAs accredits MBA, MBM and DBA degree programmes. When a school applies for accreditation for its MBA programmes, AMBA requires that the entire portfolio of MBA programmes be put up for consideration and will award accreditation only if all programmes meet its criteria (though the school pays the same fee regardless of the number of programmes being reviewed).

The Association&#x27;s process of accrediting a school&#x27;s MBA programmes portfolio includes reviewing compliance AMBA&#x27;s criteria, most of them qualitative rather than quantitative. The criteria fall into seven dimensions: history and development of the institution; facilities and libraries; teaching faculty, teaching standards and research track record; programme administration, career and alumni services; student admission standards, diversity and cohort size; curriculum content, programme mode and duration; and learning outcomes.

Some of the key AMBA criteria for the accreditation of an MBA programme include:
* all admitted students should have at least three years of full-time post-graduation work experience upon the start of the MBA course (&quot;a criterion which the vast majority of the top US business schools cannot meet as US MBA programmes sometimes admit applicants with only a bachelor&#x27;s degree and no work experience&quot;);
* a new school applying for accreditation should have a track record of at least three years of graduating MBA students before it can be accredited;
* an MBA programme should have a cohort size of at least 20 students;
* at least 50% of the faculty of an MBA programme (including visiting faculty as part of the total) are expected to have PhD degrees; and
* a full-time MBA curriculum should contain no less than 500 contact (scheduled faculty-mediated) hours and a distance-learning MBA programme should have no less than 120 synchronous contact hours.

=== Events ===
AMBA holds three annual conferences for business school deans and directors: a Global Conference, an Asia Pacific Conference, and a Latin America Conference. Participation is open to both accredited and non-accredited schools. AMBA also hosts an annual Gala Dinner in London, which is open only to accredited schools.

AMBA organises two annual global forums with the purpose of development and training for specific functions within AMBA-accredited business schools such as accreditation managers; programme managers; marketing, admissions, alumni and development staff.

AMBA also organises webinars, lectures and networking events on a regular basis catering to MBA alumni, current MBA students, prospective MBA students and business school admissions departments. These on-campus events are held at accredited business schools and often feature distinguished speakers and practitioners in fields such as leadership, entrepreneurship and innovation.

<text>In Mormonism, the Melchizedek priesthood (), also referred to as the high priesthood of the holy order of God or the Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God, is the greater of the two orders of priesthood, the other being the Aaronic priesthood.

According to Joseph Smith, the name of this priesthood became Melchizedek &quot;because Melchizedek was such a great high priest&quot; and &quot;to avoid the too frequent repetition&quot; of the &quot;name of the Supreme Being&quot;.

==In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints==
In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the largest Latter Day Saint denomination, priesthood holders meet at their ward or branch. Those who do not hold the priesthood are still invited and encouraged to attend with the elders quorum. However, priesthood duties can only be performed by those who are ordained.

Receiving the Melchizedek priesthood is considered to be a saving ordinance of the gospel in the LDS Church. A candidate for this ordination (worthy male member 18 years and older, regardless of how long they have been a member) is interviewed and often counseled to study the 84th, 107th, and 121st sections of the Doctrine and Covenants to begin to understand the &quot;oath and covenant of the priesthood&quot;, the covenant a person makes with God when he receives the Melchizedek priesthood. The candidate is also usually asked to stand in a gathering of the members of the church to be publicly accepted as being worthy of ordination.

Shortly after the establishment of the church, the ordination of black people to the priesthood was prohibited; following a revelation received by then-church president Spencer W. Kimball, the prohibition was lifted in 1978.

== Restoration account debate ==
Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery said they were visited by &quot;an angel of God... clothed with glory&quot;, who Cowdery and Smith identified as John the Baptist and who laid his hands on their head and gave them the Aaronic priesthood. Smith described the event in detail and gave an exact date when it happened as May 15, 1829. In contrast, he never gave a description of any vision in which he saw an angel separately confer the Melchizedek priesthood. However, by the turn of the 20th century, Latter Day Saint theologians believed that such a separate ordination by angels had occurred prior to the organization of the Church of Christ on April 6, 1830. This was largely because the early church organization contained the office of elder, which at least by 1835 was considered an office of the Melchizedek priesthood. As evidence for such a pre-organization angelic conferral, writers referred to a revelation in which Smith said he heard &quot;The voice of Peter, James, and John in the wilderness between Harmony, Susquehanna county, and Colesville, Broome county, on the Susquehanna river, declaring themselves as possessing the keys of the kingdom, and of the dispensation of the fulness of times!&quot; Smith and Cowdery were visited by the three angels in 1829 and that they conferred the Melchizedek priesthood in the same way John the Baptist had conferred the Aaronic priesthood. However, the official church history, supervised or written by Smith, states that &quot;the authority of the Melchizedek priesthood was manifested and conferred for the first time upon several of the Elders&quot; during a General Conference in early June 1831. When Smith&#x27;s official history was first published in 1902, the compiler B.H. Roberts thought that this was a mistake, because it would not be consistent with the common Mormon belief that the priesthood had been conferred prior to the church&#x27;s founding in 1830. In History of the Church, Roberts wrote, &quot;there is no definite account of the [Melchizedek Priesthood restoration] event in the history of the Prophet Joseph, or, for matter of that, in any of our annals.&quot;

On the other hand, some Mormon historians accept Smith&#x27;s history as correct and consistent with other historical records showing that other Mormons present at the conference dated the restoration of the Melchizedek priesthood to 1831. This conference had been a very significant event in the early church history, coming soon after the conversion of Sidney Rigdon, who believed that Mormon missionaries lacked the necessary power to adequately preach the gospel.

In January 1831, Smith issued a revelation where he wrote that after Mormons relocated to Kirtland, Ohio, they would &quot;be endowed with power from on high&quot; and &quot;sent forth&quot;. In a revelation given to an individual, Smith assured the man that &quot;at the conference meeting he [would] be ordained unto power from on high&quot;. One of Smith&#x27;s associates that was present at the conference expressed the view that this ordination &quot;consisted [of] the endowment--it being a new order--and bestowed authority&quot;, and later that year, an early convert who had left the church claimed that many of the Saints &quot;have been ordained to the High Priesthood, or the order of Melchizedek; and profess to be endowed with the same power as the ancient apostles were&quot;. In 1835, the historical record was muddled a bit when the first edition of the Doctrine and Covenants altered pre-1831 revelations to make a distinction between the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods, and to classify the offices of elder and apostle as part of the Melchizedek priesthood.

<text>Carn Euny (from ) is an archaeological site near Sancreed, on the Penwith peninsula in Cornwall, United Kingdom. It consists of evidence of both Iron Age and post-Iron Age settlement, with excavation on the site showning activity at Carn Euny as early as the Neolithic period. The first timber huts there were built about 500 BC, and 400-500 years later were replaced by stone huts; the remains of which are still visible.

Carn Euny is best known for the well-preserved state of the large fogou, an underground passageway, which is more than long. This fogou runs just below the surface of the ground and is roofed with massive stone slabs.

The site was abandoned late in the Roman period.

==Location==

Carn Euny lies in southwest Cornwall in the Penwith District, near the village of Sancreed. The archaeological site can be accessed at any time and the admission is free. Parking can be found in the nearby hamlet of Brane. The site is overlooked by the Iron Age hill fort of Caer Bran. Another similar Romano-British settlement is Chysauster about 10 km to the northeast. Carn Euny is managed by the Cornwall Heritage Trust.

==Construction==
Traces of human activity in Carn Euny have been detected from the early Neolithic period. Iron Age round houses of wattle and daub, mud and wood were built around 500-400 BC, and replaced by stone houses starting in the 1st century BC. Some of these stone houses were &quot;replaced with larger, stone ‘courtyard’ houses&quot; between 200-400 AD, the remains of which are the ruins still visible above ground as the older roundhouses are only left as sub-surface ruins. Seven single-room stone houses, of both a round and oval form, and three courtyard houses are in evidence; courtyard houses only being found in Cornwall.

The most important structure of the site is the fogou (&quot;Ogo&quot; being Cornish for cave), a man-made underground passage which is covered with massive stone slabs. Fogous can be found in other places in the UK and Ireland, and are known more generally as souterrains. Their purpose is unclear. The fogou at Carn Euny is in particularly good condition and consists of a 20 m long corridor, with a side passage that leads to a round stone chamber with a collapsed roof, and a small tunnel which may be a second entrance.

At this time the people of Carn Euny lived from agriculture, livestock, trade, and perhaps tin mining. Evidence of farming here includes 40 acres enclosed within a field boundary, which is most likely the area farmed by this settlement. The inhabitants likely grew oats, barley and rye, and kept sheep, goats and cattle. The courtyard houses &quot;may have been used for stabling livestock, crop processing and outdoor cooking.&quot;

==Excavations==

The site was discovered in the early 19th Century by prospectors searching for tin deposits. Between 1863 and 1868, the antiquarian William Copeland Borlase examined the archaeological site and exposed the fogou. The graphic artist John Thomas Blight made corresponding engravings for the excavation report. During the 1920s, Dr. Favell and Canon Taylor discovered the foundation walls of the houses with courtyards. Between 1964 and 1972, extensive excavations were carried out, in which nine hut foundations were discovered. The fogou and the circular chamber were investigated and restored. Four main occupation phases between the 5th century BC and the 4th century AD were found.

==Chapel Euny Well==

West of the settlement are a pair of ancient wells. One is mentioned in &quot;The Legendary Lore of the Holy Wells of England&quot; of 1893 where William Borlase states (writing in the 1750s):&quot;I happened luckily to be at this well upon the last day of the year, on which, according to vulgar opinion, it exerts its principal and most salutary powers. Two women were here, who came from a neighbouring parish, and were busily employed in bathing a child. They both assured me that people who had a mind to receive any benefit from St. Euny&#x27;s Well must come and wash upon the three first Wednesdays in May. Children suffering from mesenteric disease should be dipped three times in Chapel Uny widderschynnes, and widderschynnes dragged three times round the well.&quot; It is also referred to as St. Eurinus&#x27; or Uny&#x27;s Well (i.e. well of St Euny) and may be confused with Saint Euny&#x27;s Well at Carn Brea.

<doc id="149837" wikidata="Q360155" url="?curid=149837" title="William Lloyd Garrison">
<text>William Lloyd Garrison (December , 1805 – May 24, 1879) was an American abolitionist, journalist, and social reformer. He is best known for his widely read anti-slavery newspaper &quot;The Liberator&quot;, which Garrison founded in 1831 and published in Boston until slavery in the United States was partially abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865. He supported the rights of women and in the 1870s, Garrison became a prominent voice for the women&#x27;s suffrage movement.

Garrison promoted &quot;no-governmentism&quot; and rejected the inherent validity of the American government on the basis that its engagement in war, imperialism, and slavery made it corrupt and tyrannical. His belief in individual sovereignty, and critique of coercive authority have been recognized as a precursor to certain strands of modern libertarian thought. He initially opposed violence as a principle and advocated for Christian pacifism against evil; however, at the outbreak of the American Civil War, he recognized the necessity of armed struggle as a means to achieve the abolition of slavery and supported the Lincoln administration’s efforts to end the institution. He was one of the founders of the American Anti-Slavery Society and promoted immediate and uncompensated, as opposed to gradual and compensated, emancipation of slaves in the United States.

Garrison was a typesetter, which aided him in running &quot;The Liberator&quot;. When working on his own editorials for the paper, Garrison would compose them while setting the type for the publication, without first writing them out on paper.

==Early life==

Garrison was born on December 10, 1805, in Newburyport, Massachusetts, the son of immigrants from the British colony of New Brunswick, in present-day Canada. Under An Act for the relief of sick and disabled seamen, his father Abijah Garrison, a merchant-sailing pilot and master, had obtained American papers and moved his family to Newburyport in 1806. The U.S. Embargo Act of 1807, intended to injure Great Britain, caused a decline in American commercial shipping. His father soon became unemployed and deserted the family in 1808. Garrison&#x27;s mother was Frances Maria Lloyd, reported to have been tall, charming, and of a strong religious character. She started referring to their son William as Lloyd, his middle name, to preserve her family name; he later printed his name as &quot;Wm. Lloyd&quot;. She died in 1823, in the city of Baltimore, Maryland.

Garrison sold homemade lemonade and candy as a youth, and also delivered wood to help support the family. In 1818, at 13, Garrison began working as an apprentice compositor for the &quot;Newburyport Herald.&quot; He soon began writing articles, often under the pseudonym &quot;Aristides.&quot; (Aristides was an Athenian statesman and general, nicknamed &quot;the Just&quot;.) He could write as he typeset his writing, without the need for paper. His most significant contribution to the paper, during the final year of his apprenticeship, was a severe repudiation of &quot;American Writers&quot; by John Neal. This started a years-long feud. After his apprenticeship ended, Garrison became the sole owner, editor, and printer of the &quot;Newburyport Free Press,&quot; acquiring the rights from his friend Isaac Knapp, who had also apprenticed at the &quot;Herald&quot;. One of their regular contributors was poet and abolitionist John Greenleaf Whittier. In this early work as a small-town newspaper writer, Garrison acquired skills he would later use as a nationally known writer, speaker, and newspaper publisher. In 1828, he was appointed editor of the &quot;National Philanthropist&quot; in Boston, Massachusetts, the first American journal to promote legally-mandated temperance.

He became involved in the anti-slavery movement in the 1820s and over time, he rejected both the American Colonization Society and the gradualist views of most others involved in the movement. Garrison co-founded &quot;The Liberator&quot; to espouse his abolitionist views. Out of its those reading the publication, in 1832 he organized the New-England Anti-Slavery Society. This society expanded into the American Anti-Slavery Society, which espoused the position that slavery should be abolished immediately, rather than gradually.
== Marriage == 
On September 4, 1834, Garrison married Helen Eliza Benson (1811–1876). She was the daughter of a retired abolitionist merchant. Their relationship was very close as they both worked professionally toward the same objectives. When his wife died, Garrison mourned for a long time and even attempted to find a means for them to continue to communicate through spirtitualism. They are buried together in Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston. The couple had two daughters and five sons. Two of their children, a daughter and a son, died as children. 

==Career==
===Reformer===
At the age of 25, Garrison joined the anti-slavery movement, later crediting the 1826 book of Presbyterian Reverend John Rankin, &quot;Letters on Slavery&quot;, for attracting him to the cause. For a brief time, he became associated with the American Colonization Society, an organization that promoted the &quot;resettlement&quot; of free blacks to a territory (now known as Liberia) on the west coast of Africa. Although some members of the society encouraged granting freedom to enslaved people, others considered relocation a means to reduce the number of already free blacks in the United States. Southern members thought reducing the threat of free blacks in society would help preserve the institution of slavery. By late 1829–1830, &quot;Garrison rejected colonization, publicly apologized for his error, and then, as was typical of him, he censured all who were committed to it.&quot; He stated that anti-colonialism activist and fellow abolitionist William J. Watkins had influenced his view.

===&quot;Genius of Universal Emancipation&quot;===

In 1829, Garrison began writing for and became co-editor with Benjamin Lundy of the Quaker newspaper &quot;Genius of Universal Emancipation&quot;, published at that time in Baltimore, Maryland. With his experience as a printer and newspaper editor, Garrison changed the layout of the paper and handled other production issues. Lundy was freed to spend more time touring as an anti-slavery speaker. Garrison initially shared Lundy&#x27;s gradualist views, but while working for the &quot;Genius&quot;, he became convinced of the need to demand immediate and complete emancipation. Lundy and Garrison continued to work together on the paper despite their differing views. Each signed his editorials.

Garrison introduced &quot;The Black List,&quot; a column devoted to printing short reports of &quot;the barbarities of slaverykidnappings, whippings, murders.&quot; For instance, Garrison reported that Francis Todd, a shipper from Garrison&#x27;s home town of Newburyport, Massachusetts, was involved in the domestic slave trade, and that he had recently had slaves shipped from Baltimore to New Orleans in the coastwise trade on his ship the &quot;Francis&quot;. (This was completely legal. An expanded domestic trade, &quot;breeding&quot; slaves in Maryland and Virginia for shipment south, replaced the importation of African slaves, prohibited in 1808; see Slavery in the United States#Slave trade.)

Todd filed a suit for libel in Maryland against both Garrison and Lundy; he thought to gain support from pro-slavery courts. The state of Maryland also brought criminal charges against Garrison, quickly finding him guilty and ordering him to pay a fine of $50 and court costs. (Charges against Lundy were dropped because he had been traveling when the story was printed.) Garrison refused to pay the fine and was sentenced to a jail term of six months. He was released after seven weeks when the anti-slavery philanthropist Arthur Tappan paid his fine. Garrison decided to leave Maryland, and he and Lundy amicably parted ways.

===&quot;The Liberator&quot;===
In 1831, Garrison, fully aware of the press as a means to bring about political change, returned to New England, where he co-founded a weekly anti-slavery newspaper, &quot;The Liberator&quot;, with his friend Isaac Knapp. In the first issue, Garrison stated:

Paid subscriptions to &quot;The Liberator&quot; were always fewer than its circulation. In 1834 it had two thousand subscribers, three-fourths of whom were black people. Benefactors paid to have the newspaper distributed free of charge to state legislators, governor&#x27;s mansions, Congress, and the White House. Although Garrison rejected violence as a means for ending slavery, his critics saw him as a dangerous fanatic because he demanded immediate and total emancipation, without compensation to the slave owners. Nat Turner&#x27;s slave rebellion in Virginia just seven months after &quot;The Liberator&quot; started publication fueled the outcry against Garrison in the South. A North Carolina grand jury indicted him for distributing incendiary material, and the Georgia Legislature offered a $5,000 reward () for his capture and conveyance to the state for trial.

Knapp parted from &quot;The Liberator&quot; in 1840. Later in 1845, when Garrison published a eulogy for his former partner and friend, he revealed that Knapp &quot;was led by adversity and business mismanagement, to put the cup of intoxication to his lips,&quot; forcing the co-authors to part.

Among the anti-slavery essays and poems that Garrison published in &quot;The Liberator&quot; was an article in 1856 by a 14-year-old Anna Elizabeth Dickinson. &quot;The Liberator&quot; gradually gained a large following in the Northern states. It printed or reprinted many reports, letters, and news stories, serving as a type of community bulletin board for the abolition movement. By 1861 it had subscribers across the North, as well as in England, Scotland, and Canada. After the end of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery by the Thirteenth Amendment, Garrison published the last issue (number 1,820) on December 29, 1865, writing a &quot;Valedictory&quot; column. After reviewing his long career in journalism and the cause of abolitionism, he wrote:

===Garrison and Knapp, printers and publishers===
===Organization and reaction===
In addition to publishing &quot;The Liberator&quot;, Garrison spearheaded the organization of a new movement to demand the total abolition of slavery in the United States. By January 1832, he had attracted enough followers to organize the New-England Anti-Slavery Society which, by the following summer, had dozens of affiliates and several thousand members. In December 1833, abolitionists from ten states founded the American Anti-Slavery Society (AASS). Although the New England society reorganized in 1835 as the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, enabling state societies to form in the other New England states, it remained the hub of anti-slavery agitation throughout the antebellum period. Many affiliates were organized by women who responded to Garrison&#x27;s appeals for women to take an active part in the abolition movement. The largest of these was the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society, which raised funds to support &quot;The Liberator&quot;, publish anti-slavery pamphlets, and conduct anti-slavery petition drives.

The purpose of the American Anti-Slavery Society was the conversion of all Americans to the philosophy that &quot;Slaveholding is a heinous crime in the sight of God&quot; and that &quot;duty, safety, and best interests of all concerned, require its &quot;immediate abandonment&quot; without expatriation.&quot;

The threat posed by anti-slavery organizations and their activity drew violent reactions from slave interests in both the Southern and Northern states, with mobs breaking up anti-slavery meetings, assaulting lecturers, ransacking anti-slavery offices, burning postal sacks of anti-slavery pamphlets, and destroying anti-slavery presses. Healthy bounties were offered in Southern states for the capture of Garrison, &quot;dead or alive&quot;.

On October 21, 1835, &quot;an assemblage of fifteen hundred or two thousand highly respectable gentlemen&quot;, as they were described in the &quot;Boston Commercial Gazette&quot;, surrounded the building housing Boston&#x27;s anti-slavery offices, where Garrison had agreed to address a meeting of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society after the fiery British abolitionist George Thompson was unable to keep his engagement with them. Mayor Theodore Lyman persuaded the women to leave the building, but when the mob learned that Thompson was not within, they began yelling for Garrison. Lyman was a staunch anti-abolitionist but wanted to avoid bloodshed and suggested Garrison escape by a back window while Lyman told the crowd Garrison was gone. The mob spotted and apprehended Garrison, tied a rope around his waist, and pulled him through the streets toward Boston Common, calling for tar and feathers. The mayor intervened and Garrison was taken to the Leverett Street Jail for protection.

Gallows were erected in front of his house, and he was burned in effigy.

===The woman question and division===

Garrison&#x27;s appeal for women&#x27;s mass petitioning against slavery sparked controversy over women&#x27;s right to a political voice. In 1837, women abolitionists from seven states convened in New York to expand their petitioning efforts and repudiate the social mores that proscribed their participation in public affairs. That summer, sisters Angelina Grimké and Sarah Grimké responded to the controversy aroused by their public speaking with treatises on woman&#x27;s rightsAngelina&#x27;s &quot;Letters to Catherine E. Beecher&quot; and Sarah&#x27;s &quot;Letters on the Equality of the Sexes and Condition of Woman&quot;and Garrison published them first in &quot;The Liberator&quot; and then in book form. Instead of surrendering to appeals for him to retreat on the &quot;woman question,&quot; Garrison announced in December 1837 that &quot;The Liberator&quot; would support &quot;the rights of woman to their utmost extent.&quot; The Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society appointed women to leadership positions and hired Abby Kelley as the first of several female field agents.

In 1840, Garrison&#x27;s promotion of woman&#x27;s rights within the anti-slavery movement was one of the issues that caused some abolitionists, including New York brothers Arthur Tappan and Lewis Tappan, to leave the American Anti-Slavery Society and form the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, which did not admit women. In June of that same year, when the World Anti-Slavery Convention meeting in London refused to seat America&#x27;s women delegates, Garrison, Charles Lenox Remond, Nathaniel P. Rogers, and William Adams refused to take their seats as delegates as well and joined the women in the spectators&#x27; gallery. The controversy introduced the woman&#x27;s rights question not only to England but also to future woman&#x27;s rights leader Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who attended the convention as a spectator, accompanying her delegate-husband, Henry B. Stanton.

Although Henry Stanton had cooperated in the Tappans&#x27; failed attempt to wrest leadership of the AASS from Garrison, he was part of another group of abolitionists unhappy with Garrison&#x27;s influencethose who disagreed with Garrison&#x27;s insistence that because the U.S. Constitution was a pro-slavery document, abolitionists should not participate in politics and government. A growing number of abolitionists, including Stanton, Gerrit Smith, Charles Turner Torrey, and Amos A. Phelps, wanted to form an anti-slavery political party and seek a political solution to slavery. They withdrew from the AASS in 1840, formed the Liberty Party, and nominated James G. Birney for president. By the end of 1840, Garrison announced the formation of a third new organization, the Friends of Universal Reform, with sponsors and founding members including prominent reformers Maria Chapman, Abby Kelley Foster, Oliver Johnson, and Amos Bronson Alcott (father of Louisa May Alcott).

Although some members of the Liberty Party supported woman&#x27;s rights, including women&#x27;s suffrage, Garrison&#x27;s &quot;Liberator&quot; continued to be the leading advocate of woman&#x27;s rights throughout the 1840s, publishing editorials, speeches, legislative reports, and other developments concerning the subject. In February 1849, Garrison&#x27;s name headed the women&#x27;s suffrage petition sent to the Massachusetts legislature, the first such petition sent to any American legislature, and he supported the subsequent annual suffrage petition campaigns organized by Lucy Stone and Wendell Phillips. Garrison took a leading role in the May 30, 1850, meeting that called the first National Woman&#x27;s Rights Convention, saying in his address to that meeting that the new movement should make securing the ballot to women its primary goal. At the national convention held in Worcester the following October, Garrison was appointed to the National Woman&#x27;s Rights Central Committee, which served as the movement&#x27;s executive committee, charged with carrying out programs adopted by the conventions, raising funds, printing proceedings and tracts, and organizing annual conventions.

===Controversy===
In 1849, Garrison became involved in one of Boston&#x27;s most notable trials of the time. Washington Goode, a black seaman, had been sentenced to death for the murder of a fellow black mariner, Thomas Harding. In &quot;The Liberator&quot; Garrison argued that the verdict relied on &quot;circumstantial evidence of the most flimsy character ...&quot; and feared that the determination of the government to uphold its decision to execute Goode was based on race. As all other death sentences since 1836 in Boston had been commuted, Garrison concluded that Goode would be the last person executed in Boston for a capital offense writing, &quot;Let it not be said that the last man Massachusetts bore to hang was a colored man!&quot; Despite the efforts of Garrison and many other prominent figures of the time, Goode was hanged on May 25, 1849.

Garrison became famous as one of the most articulate, as well as most radical, opponents of slavery. His approach to emancipation stressed &quot;moral suasion,&quot; non-violence, and passive resistance. While some other abolitionists of the time favored gradual emancipation, Garrison argued for the &quot;immediate and complete emancipation of all slaves.&quot; On July 4, 1854, he publicly burned a copy of the Constitution, condemning it as &quot;a Covenant with Death, an Agreement with Hell,&quot; referring to the three-fifths compromise that had written slavery into the Constitution.

In 1855, his eight-year alliance with Frederick Douglass disintegrated when Douglass converted to classical liberal legal theorist and abolitionist Lysander Spooner&#x27;s view (dominant among political abolitionists) that the Constitution could be interpreted as being anti-slavery.
The events in John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harpers Ferry, followed by Brown&#x27;s trial and execution, were closely followed in &quot;The Liberator&quot;. Garrison had Brown&#x27;s last speech, in court, printed as a broadside, available in the &quot;Liberator&quot; office.

Garrison&#x27;s outspoken anti-slavery views repeatedly put him in danger. Besides his imprisonment in Baltimore and the price placed on his head by the state of Georgia, he was the object of vituperation and frequent death threats. On the eve of the Civil War, a sermon preached in a Universalist chapel in Brooklyn, New York, denounced &quot;the bloodthirsty sentiments of Garrison and his school; and did not wonder that the feeling of the South was exasperated, taking as they did, the insane and bloody ravings of the Garrisonian traitors for the fairly expressed opinions of the North.&quot;

===After abolition===

After the United States abolished slavery, Garrison announced in May 1865 that he would resign the presidency of the American Anti-Slavery Society and offered a resolution declaring victory in the struggle against slavery and dissolving the society. The resolution prompted a sharp debate, however, led by his long-time friend Wendell Phillips, who argued that the mission of the AASS was not fully completed until black Southerners gained full political and civil equality. Garrison maintained that while complete civil equality was vitally important, the special task of the AASS was at an end, and that the new task would best be handled by new organizations and new leadership. With his long-time allies deeply divided, however, he was unable to muster the support he needed to carry the resolution, and it was defeated 118–48. Declaring that his &quot;vocation as an Abolitionist, thank God, has ended,&quot; Garrison resigned the presidency and declined an appeal to continue. Returning home to Boston, he withdrew completely from the AASS and ended publication of &quot;The Liberator&quot; at the end of 1865. With Wendell Phillips at its head, the AASS continued to operate for five more years, until the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution granted voting rights to black men. (According to Henry Mayer, Garrison was hurt by the rejection, and remained peeved for years; &quot;as the cycle came around, always managed to tell someone that he was &quot;not&quot; going to the next set of [AASS] meetings&quot; [594].)

After his withdrawal from AASS and ending &quot;The Liberator&quot;, Garrison continued to participate in public reform movements. He supported the causes of civil rights for blacks and woman&#x27;s rights, particularly the campaign for suffrage. He contributed columns on Reconstruction and civil rights for &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;The Boston Journal&quot;.

In 1870, he became an associate editor of the women&#x27;s suffrage newspaper, the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, along with Mary Livermore, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Lucy Stone, and Henry B. Blackwell. He served as president of both the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA) and the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association. He was a major figure in New England&#x27;s woman suffrage campaigns during the 1870s.

In 1873, he healed his long estrangements from Frederick Douglass and Wendell Phillips, affectionately reuniting with them on the platform at an AWSA rally organized by Abby Kelly Foster and Lucy Stone on the one-hundredth anniversary of the Boston Tea Party. When Charles Sumner died in 1874, some Republicans suggested Garrison as a possible successor to his Senate seat; Garrison declined on grounds of his moral opposition to taking office.

===Antisemitism===
Garrison called the ancient Jews an exclusivist people &quot;whose feet ran to evil&quot; and suggested that the Jewish diaspora was the result of their own &quot;egotism and self-complacency.&quot; When the Jewish-American sheriff and writer Mordecai Manuel Noah defended slavery, Garrison attacked Noah as &quot;the miscreant Jew&quot; and &quot;the enemy of Christ and liberty.&quot; On other occasions, Garrison described Noah as a &quot;Shylock&quot; and as &quot;the lineal descendant of the monsters who nailed Jesus to the cross.&quot;

However, Garrison acknowledged prejudice against Jews in Europe, which he compared to prejudice against African-Americans, and opposed a proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States affirming the divinity of Jesus Christ on the basis of religious freedom, writing that &quot;no one can fail to see that the Jew, Unitarian, or Deist could not worship in his own way, as an American citizen, precisely because the Constitution, under which his citizenship exists, would make faith in the New Testament and the divinity of Jesus Christ a national creed.&quot;

==Later life and death==

Garrison spent more time at home with his family. He wrote weekly letters to his children and cared for his increasingly ill wife, Helen. She had suffered a small stroke on December 30, 1863, and was increasingly confined to the house. Helen died on January 25, 1876, after a severe cold worsened into pneumonia. A quiet funeral was held in the Garrison home. Garrison, overcome with grief and confined to his bedroom with a fever and severe bronchitis, was unable to join the service. Wendell Phillips gave a eulogy and many of Garrison&#x27;s old abolitionist friends joined him upstairs to offer their private condolences.

Garrison recovered slowly from the loss of his wife and began to attend Spiritualist circles in the hope of communicating with Helen. Garrison last visited England in 1877, where he met with George Thompson and other longtime friends from the British abolitionist movement.

Suffering from kidney disease, Garrison continued to weaken during April 1879. He moved to New York to live with his daughter Fanny&#x27;s family. In late May, his condition worsened, and his five surviving children rushed to join him. Fanny asked if he would enjoy singing some hymns. Although he was unable to sing, his children sang favorite hymns while he beat time with his hands and feet. On May 24, 1879, Garrison lost consciousness and died just before midnight.
Garrison was buried alongside his wife in the Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston&#x27;s Jamaica Plain neighborhood on May 28, 1879. At the public memorial service, eulogies were given by Theodore Dwight Weld and Wendell Phillips. Eight abolitionist friends, both white and black, served as his pallbearers. Flags were flown at half-staff all across Boston. Frederick Douglass, then employed as a United States Marshal, spoke in memory of Garrison at a memorial service in a church in Washington, D.C., saying, &quot;It was the glory of this man that he could stand alone with the truth, and calmly await the result.&quot;

Garrison&#x27;s namesake son, William Lloyd Garrison Jr. (1838–1909), was a prominent advocate of the single tax, free trade, women&#x27;s suffrage, and of the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act. His third son, Wendell Phillips Garrison (1840–1907), was literary editor of &quot;The Nation&quot; from 1865 to 1906. Two other sons (George Thompson Garrison and Francis Jackson Garrison, his biographer and named after abolitionist Francis Jackson) and a daughter, Helen Frances Garrison (who married Henry Villard), survived him. Fanny&#x27;s son Oswald Garrison Villard became a prominent journalist, a founding member of the NAACP, and wrote an important biography of the abolitionist John Brown.

==Legacy==
 Leo Tolstoy was greatly influenced by the works of Garrison and his contemporary Adin Ballou, as their writings on Christian anarchism aligned with Tolstoy&#x27;s burgeoning theo-political ideology. Along with Tolstoy publishing a short biography of Garrison in 1904, he frequently cited Garrison and his works in his non-fiction texts like &quot;The Kingdom of God Is Within You&quot;. In a 2018 publication, American philosopher and anarchist Crispin Sartwell wrote that the works by Garrison and his other Christian anarchist contemporaries like Ballou directly influenced Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., as well.

<text>In C is a musical piece composed by Terry Riley in 1964. It consists of series of 53 short melodic fragments that can be repeated at the discretion of the musicians. It is often cited as the first minimalist composition to make a significant impact on the public consciousness and inspire a new movement. The number of performers is unspecified. Riley suggests &quot;a group of about 35 is desired if possible but smaller or larger groups will work&quot;.

The piece was premiered on November 4 and 6, 1964, by Riley, Steve Reich, Jon Gibson, Pauline Oliveros, Stuart Dempster, Morton Subotnick and others at the San Francisco Tape Music Center. It received its first recorded release in 1968 on Columbia Records, where the full score for the piece was included on the sleeve. 

&quot;In C&quot; was inspired by Riley&#x27;s previous work with tape loops and delay, as well by his interest in group improvisation which he has been developing since 1957-58, alongside his fellow students Loren Rush and Pauline Oliveros. The piece has been recorded by a wide range of musicians, and went on to inspire many other minimalist composers like Philip Glass, Steve Reich, John Adams, Julius Eastman, etc.

In 2022, the 1968 LP recording of &quot;In C&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Technique ==
&quot;In C&quot; uses an open score and an aleatoric approach. It consists of 53 short numbered musical phrases, lasting from half a beat to 32 beats, and having from one note to twenty-five. Performers are expected to play the first phrase once in unison, after which each performer may repeat the phrase or move on to the next. Each phrase may be repeated an arbitrary number of times at the discretion of each musician in the ensemble. Each musician is expected to use the same tempo, as led by &quot;the pulse&quot; on piano or pitched percussion (such as xylophone or marimba) but otherwise the performers have control over which phrase they play and how many times it is repeated. Performers are encouraged to play the phrases starting at different times, even if they are playing the same phrase. In this way, although the melodic content of each part is predetermined, &quot;In C&quot; has elements of aleatoric music to it and each performance will be different from others. The performance directions state that the musical ensemble should try to stay within two to three phrases of each other. The phrases must be played in order, although some may be skipped. The first musician to reach the final numbered phrase repeats it indefinitely until all other musicians reach the same phrase, at which point they all crescendo and gradually stop playing until only &quot;the pulse&quot; remains and then goes silent. 
As detailed in some editions of the score, it is customary for one musician (&quot;traditionally... a beautiful girl&quot;) to play the note C in repeated eighth notes, typically on a piano or pitched-percussion instrument (e.g. marimba). This functions as a metronome and is referred to as &quot;The Pulse&quot;. Steve Reich introduced the idea of a rhythmic pulse to Riley, who accepted it, thus radically altering the original composition by Riley which had no pre-determined rhythm.

&quot;In C&quot; has no set duration; performances can last as little as fifteen minutes or as long as several hours, although Riley indicates &quot;performances normally average between 45 minutes and an hour and a half.&quot; The number of performers may also vary between any two performances. The original recording of the piece was created by 11 musicians (although, through overdubbing, several dozen instruments were utilized), while a performance in 2006 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall featured 124 musicians.

The piece begins on a C major chord (patterns one through seven) with a strong emphasis on the mediant E and the entrance of the note F which begins a series of slow progressions to other chords suggesting a few subtle and ambiguous changes of key, the last pattern being an alternation between B and G. Though the polyphonic interplay of the various patterns against each other and themselves at different rhythmic displacements is of primary interest, the piece may be considered heterophonic.

The first UK performance of &quot;In C&quot; was on 18 May 1968 at Royal Institute Galleries by the Music Now Ensemble directed by Cornelius Cardew as part of a series of four Music Now, Sounds of Discovery Concerts.

<text>Religious music (also sacred music) is a type of music that is performed or composed for religious use or through religious influence. It may overlap with ritual music, which is music, sacred or not, performed or composed for or as a ritual. Religious songs have been described as a source of strength, as well as a means of easing pain, improving one&#x27;s mood, and assisting in the discovery of meaning in one&#x27;s suffering. While style and genre vary broadly across traditions, religious groups still share a variety of musical practices and techniques.

Religious music takes on many forms and varies throughout cultures. Religions such as Islam, Judaism, and Sinism demonstrate this, splitting off into different forms and styles of music that depend on varying religious practices. Sometimes, religious music uses similar instruments across cultures. The use of drums (and drumming), for example, is seen commonly in numerous religions such as Rastafari and Sinism, while wind instruments (the horn, saxophone, trumpet and variations of such) can be commonly found in Islam and Judaism.

Throughout each religion, each form of religious music, within the specific religion, differs for a different purpose. For example, in Islamic music, some types of music are used for prayer while others are used for celebrations. Similarly, a variation like this is shared between many other religions.

Music plays a significant role in many religions. In some religions, such as Buddhism, music helps people calm their minds and focus before meditation. In Sikh music, known as Kirtan, the music helps people connect with the teachings of the religion and with God. Some other religions, such as Islam, use music to recite the word of their holy book. Some religions relate their music to non-religious musicians. For example, Rastafarian music heavily relates to reggae music. Religious music helps those of all religions connect with their faith and remember their religious values.

== Buddhist music ==

Buddhist music is music created for or inspired by Buddhism and part of Buddhist art.

===Buddhist chanting===
Buddhist chanting is a form of musical verse or incantation, which is similar to religious recitations of other faiths. Buddhist chanting is the traditional means of preparing the mind for meditation, especially as part of formal practice (in either a lay or monastic context). Some Buddhist traditions also use chanting as a form of devotional practices.

Apart from chanting, in certain Buddhist traditions, offerings of music are given in honor of the Triple Gem, consisting of traditional music performed by specialists, or of the ritual music that accompanies the chanting. One significant example lies in Sri Lankan tradition, where a traditional ceremony is performed by drummers as a musical offering, also popularly known as &quot;Sabda-Puja&quot;.

==Christian music==

According to some scholars, the earliest music in the Christian Church came from Jewish worship music, with some additional Syriac influence. It is believed that this music lay somewhere between singing and speaking, or speaking with an understood ritual cadence. However, there is another opinion that the roots of early Christian music come from the early ascetic monastic orders.

===Hymns===

Christian music has diversified over time, reflecting both its centuries-old roots as well as more contemporary musical styles. Thousands of traditionally-styled songs of praise or worship, called &quot;hymns&quot; (from the Greek word &quot;hymnos&quot; meaning, &quot;song of praise&quot;), were written over hundreds of years. Eventually, these songs were compiled into books called &quot;hymnals&quot;, from which pastors and s would read during Christian services – a practice that continues in many churches today.

Prior to the eighteenth century, Christian hymnals were published as standalone texts without accompanying musical scores. The first American hymnal with both text and song was published in 1831. In Europe, the Church of England did not officially allow hymns to be sung until 1820. Originally, hymns were sung by &quot;lining out&quot; the lyrics, meaning, the pastor would sing a line, and then the congregation would repeat it. This was done because, at that time, books were expensive, so it was economical to provide the pastor of a church with one copy from which everyone could sing.

===Christian Music in the Modern Era===

Modern methods of publication have made hymnals much more accessible to the public today than previously. The practice of &quot;lining out&quot; the lyrics of hymns has therefore largely fallen away, although it continues to be practiced in some traditional churches. In the twentieth century, Christian music has developed to reflect the emergence of a diverse array of musical genres including rock, metal, pop, jazz, contemporary, rap, spiritual, country, blues, and gospel. The use of specific genres and styles of music in church services today varies across Christian denominations and according to the personal preference of pastors and church members. As of the late twentieth century, there has been a widespread preference in less traditional churches towards using contemporary music (particularly, &quot;praise and worship&quot; songs, which attempt to preserve the religious intent of hymns but use contemporary lyrics and a more modern musical sound instead) as well as gospel and spiritual music.

== Hindu music ==
Hindu music is music created for or influenced by Hinduism. It includes Carnatic music, Indian classical music, Hindustani classical music, Kirtan, Bhajan and other musical genres. Raagas are a common form of Hindu music in classical India. Vedas are also in Hindu music.

A bhajan is a Hindu devotional song, often of ancient origin. Bhajans are often simple songs in lyrical language expressing emotions of love for the Divine, whether for a single God and Goddess, or any number of divinities. Many bhajans feature several names and aspects of the chosen deity, especially in the case of Hindu sahasranamas, which list a divinity&#x27;s 1008 names. Great importance is attributed to the singing of bhajans with Bhakti, i.e. loving devotion. &quot;Rasanam Lakshanam Bhajanam&quot; means the act by which we feel more closer to our inner self or God, is a bhajan. Acts which are done for the God is called bhajan.

A raga or raag (IAST: rāga; also raaga or ragam; literally &quot;coloring, tingeing, dyeing&quot;) is a melodic framework for improvisation akin to a melodic mode in Indian classical music.

== Islamic music ==
Islamic music comes in many forms. Each form is used for different purposes as one may be for prayers and complete focus towards Allah (God) and while the other is entertainment, however still including that religious aspect.

=== Prayer ===
Islamic prayer is a type of religious music that Muslims use when they pray and worship Allah. These prayers (in Arabic, prayer is &quot;Salah)&quot; that occur five times a day. These prayers are conducted by facing Mecca while standing, having both knees to the ground, and bowing. During prayer, recitations are usually of the Islamic holy book: the Quran. Throughout the day, in Mecca, these prayers connect the Muslim people through a series of melodic prayers that are often amplified throughout the city. In Islam, the implication of prayer, and in this case the &quot;Salah&quot;, is for ritual since it is believed to be the direct word of God that shall be performed as a collective, as well as individually.

=== Sufi Music ===
Sufism, Islam&#x27;s mystical dimension, advocates peace, tolerance, and pluralism, as well as music as a means of improving one&#x27;s relationship with God. Sufi music aims to bring listeners closer to God. The deep urge to dissolve the physical realm and transcend into the spiritual universe, which occurs through the practice of listening to music, chanting, and whirling, and culminating in spiritual ecstasy, lies at the heart of Sufi lyrics. Because music is viewed as a tool for the believer to grow closer to the holy, sound and music are important to the basic experience of Sufism. Sufi music is therefore music created by and for the soul.

=== Naat ===
The other form of Islamic music is Naat. The word Naat has Arabic origins and translates to &quot;praise&quot;. A poem that praises the Islamic Prophet Muhammad is referred to as Naat (نعت) in Urdu. First naat dates back to the era of Muhammad and was written in Arabic. It later spread throughout the world and reached various literatures including Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Pashto, Turkish, Seraiki and more. Naat-Khuwan or Sana-Khuwan are known as those who recite Naat.

=== Instruments ===

* Chordophones, or stringed instruments
* &quot;Zornā&quot; and &quot;gayta&quot; as aerophones, or wind instruments
* &quot;Būq&quot;, or horn
* &quot;Nafīr&quot;, or long trumpet
* Idiophones, membranophones, tambourines, or frame drums

=== Melodic Organization ===
Islamic music is monophonic, meaning it has only one melody line. Everything in performance is based on the refinement of the melodic line and the complexity of the beat. Although a simple arrangement of notes, octaves, fifths, and fourths, usually below the melody notes, may be used as ornamentation, the concept of harmony is absent. Microtonality and the variety of intervals used are two components that contribute to the melody&#x27;s enrichment. As a result, the three-quarter tone, which was first used in Islamic music in the ninth or tenth centuries, coexists with bigger and smaller intervals. Musicians have a keen sensitivity to pitch variations, often altering even the perfect consonances, the fourth and fifth, somewhat.

=== History of Islamic prayer ===
Riccold De Monte, a famous travel writer, stated in the year 1228, &quot;What shall I say of their prayer? For they pray with such concentration and devotion that I was astonished when I was able to see it personally and observe it with my own eyes.&quot; The origin of the art of prayer in all Abrahamic religions is to glorify God and the same goes for Islam. The &quot;Al Salat&quot; is the most widely used word to mean institutionalized prayer and is one of the oldest forms of prayer in Islam. Islamic prayer, traditions, and ideals had influence from these Abrahamic religions. The time of origination of Salah came from Muhammad in a cave as he began to worship Allah (God). It is believed that through this act of worship Mohammad interacted with the Abrahamic prophet Moses. Now these &quot;prayers&quot; come in the form of recitations of the Quran and poems written by prophets of the faith.

=== Spread of Islamic prayer ===
Besides the spread of Islam through Arabia by prophets, it spread through trade routes like the Silk Road and through conflicts of war. Through the Silk Road traders and members of the early Muslim faith were able to go to countries such as China and create mosques around 627 C. E. As men from the Middle East went to China they would marry these Asian women, which led to a spreading of the faith and traditions of Islam in multiplicities. The Crusades in the 9th and 10th centuries encouraged the spread of Islam through the invasions of Latin Christian soldiers and Muslim soldiers into each other&#x27;s lands. The whole conflict began on the premises of a Holy Land and which group of people owned these lands that led to these foes invading their respective lands. As the religion itself spread so did its implications of ritual, such as prayer.

=== Relation of Islamic Music to Other Cultures ===
Both musical theory and practice illustrate the relationship between Islamic and Western music. Many Greek treatises had been translated into Arabic by the 9th century. Greek musical texts were maintained in Arabic culture, and the majority of those that reached the West did so in their Arabic translations. Arab philosophers adopted Greek models and often improved on them. The Muslim conquest of Spain and Portugal, as well as the Crusades to the Middle East, introduced Europeans to Arabic theoretical works and thriving Islamic art music. Moreover, Arab invaders entered India as early as 711 AD, while Mongol and Turkmen forces eventually invaded the Middle East, bringing Islamic and Far Eastern music together. There are parallels between India&#x27;s and the Middle East&#x27;s modal systems, as well as some cosmological and ethical ideas of music.

== Jewish music ==

Jewish music is the shared melody of religious Jewish communities. Its influence spreads across the globe, originating in the Middle East, where music principles differ from those of the Western world, emphasizing rhythmic development over harmony. There are three sections into which Jewish music can be separated: Ashkenazic music, Sephardic music, and Mizrahi music.

=== Ashkenazic ===
The most prevalent form of Ashkenazic music is Klezmer, which is typically sung in Yiddish. Klezmer often refers to the Jewish instrumentalist, specifically focusing on Ashkenazic melodies and music; this genre was common among European Jewish traveling musicians. Klezmer music was and continues to be used primarily at Jewish social gatherings. Weddings, however, are the main venue for this genre. Klezmer fundamentally dates back to the nineteenth century; there are a multitude of Klezmer musicians whose ages range from 50 to 80, but there is evidence that dates it back to centuries prior. Klezmer music features a myriad of various instruments that can be seen in many modern forms of music today, such as violin, drums and cymbals, accordion, cello, clarinet, and saxophone.

=== Sephardic ===
Sephardic music encompasses music that is of Mediterranean origin, including Spain, Turkey, and Greece. Sephardic music is typically sung in Ladino, or a Judeo-Spanish dialect. It demonstrates music styles that are reminiscent of Mediterranean rhythms and melodies. This genre touches on romance, life, and religious traditions, and is typically associated with women and women&#x27;s singing. Women tend to sing these songs with no additional harmony or instruments. Sephardic music originates from Jews that lived in medieval Spain and Portugal, and it spread following Sephardic Jews&#x27; expulsion from Spain and Portugal in the late 15th century.

=== Mizrahi ===
Mizrahi music contains elements of Middle Eastern, European, and North African music, traditionally sung in Hebrew. Mizrahi Jews are communities of Jewish people from the Middle East and North Africa. This style of music was widely unpopular, with Ashkenazic music being prevalent in most Jewish communities. This style, however, grew in popularity in the 1970s. Mizrahi music demonstrates many Arabic elements, showcasing instruments such as the oud, kanun, and the darbuka. Other instrumental elements include guitar, vocal trills, and electronic instruments.

== Neopagan music ==

Neopagan music is music created for or influenced by modern Paganism. It has appeared in many styles and genres, including folk music, classical music, singer-songwriter, post-punk, heavy metal and ambient music.

== Rastafarian music ==
=== Origin ===
Rastafari appeared in Jamaica in the 1930s as an energetic and spirited movement. It is classed as a religion, by non-rastafarians, due to the principles the movement is built upon. Nevertheless, some Rastafarians viewed their movement as a way of life for their supporters. The Rastafarian way of life represents the identity recreation of being African. As the movement spread to South Africa and Jamaica, this caused confusion about what Rastafarians believed due to the combination of other ideologies and religions being incorporated into the religion. However, Christianity being the structure for the religion, interpreted parts of the Bible differently

Rastafarian music is persistently tied to reggae music, an earlier form of Jamaican music. As reggae continues to be spread throughout the world, creators are beginning to change the original reggae sound and Rastafarian ideology incorporated. Various reggae songs representing Rastafarian culture through lyrics, themes, and symbolism.

=== Rastafarian Drumming ===
Earlier origins of Rastafarian music connected to the high usage of drums. The play of drums represents a form of communication between Rastafarian gods and their supporters. Drumming would commonly take place during a reasoning session, the gathering of Rastafarians to chant, pray, and sing in the home of a Rasta or a community center. Count Ossie, a Rastafarian drum player revealed various rhythmic patterns after noticing the escalated sensation of drumming during prayer. Incorporation of the drums in spiritual sessions stems from the African drumming and Africans and Rastafarians seek for cultural identity. Majority of slaves not having religious belief, coincidentally Rastafarians having no music led to the integration of the groups. This increased the spread of the Rastafarian religion as slaves gained a new religion, and Rastafarians enjoyed Buru music, Afro-Jamaican rhythm music.

=== Expansion ===
The global spread of the Rastafarian movement has been significantly facilitated by reggae music, attracting a diverse following worldwide. This has been especially resonant among communities experiencing social and economic hardships, providing them with a source of identity, pride, and resistance against perceived oppressive systems.

The Rastafarian Bob Marley was a significant reason for the spread of Rastafarian music around the world. Through religious messages portrayed in his lyrics, the religion was beginning to become more popular. Marley expressing his opinions on political matters, justice, and peace, increased awareness of the unique beliefs of Rastafari. North Americans were able to identify distinctive features of Rastafarians such as dreadlocks, manner of speaking, and the consumption of marijuana. Marley remains an essential figure within Rastafarian music, and Nyabinghi drums continue to be played at his museum.

== Shamanic music ==

Shamanic music is music played either by actual shamans as part of their rituals, or by people who, whilst not themselves shamans, wish to evoke the cultural background of shamanism in some way.

== Shintō music ==

Shintō music (神楽) is ceremonial music for Shinto (神道) which is the native religion of Japan.

==Sikh music==
Sikh music or Shabad kirtan is Kirtan-style singing of hymns or Shabad from the Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, the central text of Sikhism. Its development dates back to the late 16th century as the musical expression of mystical poetry, accompanied by a musical instrument &quot;rabab&quot;. All the Sikh Gurus sang in the then-prevalent classical and folk music styles, accompanied by stringed and percussion instruments. The Gurus specified the raag for each hymn in the Sikh sacred scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib.

=== Shabad ===

=== Raag ===
The Sikh Guru, Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, consists of shabads, or passages, written by Sikh Gurus and various other saints and holy men. Before each shabad, a raag is assigned. the raag provides a guideline for how the shabad should be sang. There are 31 raags in Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji. A raag is a specific set of rules on how to construct a certain melody. Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji is composed with different raags to match the shabads and teachings of the Sikh Gurus and various holy people.

=== Instruments ===
The Gurus also created numerous musical instruments including the Dilruba, the Sarangi, the Esraj and the Jori.

==== Rabab ====
One of the earliest Sikh instruments to be used was the Rabab. When Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the first Guru of the Sikhs would travel to different areas, his companion Bhai Mardana would always bring a rebab. They would sing Sikh shabads to the residents of each village and Bhai Mardana would play his rebab. In this way, Guru Nanak Dev Ji started the singing of Sikh kirtan.

==== Jori ====
Another Sikh instrument is the Jori. The word jori means pair and the jori is a pair of two drums. The musician playing the jori will use one hand per drum whilst playing the instrument. The instrument was created during the time of the fifth Sikh Guru, Guru Arjun Dev Ji. Originally, one of the most popular drums used in South Asia in the 16th century was the Mardang. The Mardang was a singular drum with two sides played simultaneously. In the court of Guru Arjun Dev Ji there were two musicians, Sata and Balwand, who decided to create a new instrument by splitting the Mardang in half. This created two separate drums that would be played simultaneously and would be able to be tuned individually.

==== Taus ====

One distinctive Sikh instrument is the Taus. The head of the instrument is shaped like a peacock. The 10th Guru of the Sikhs, Guru Gobind Singh Ji, named the instrument &quot;Taus&quot; as the word is Persian for peacock. This instrument was originally created by Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji. It is significantly larger than other Sikh instruments. It is played with a bow and has 28–30 strings, allowing the instrument to communicate an array of emotions and properly play the raags of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji.

==== Harmonium ====
After the British invaded and colonized India in the 19th century, they introduced some of their instruments to the Sikh Community. One of these instruments was the Harmonium.

==== Tabla ====
The second instrument was the Tabla. The tabla is meant to accompany the singer and the harmonium in Sikh kirtan.

<text>Combinatory logic is a notation to eliminate the need for quantified variables in mathematical logic. It was introduced by Moses Schönfinkel and Haskell Curry, and has more recently been used in computer science as a theoretical model of computation and also as a basis for the design of functional programming languages. It is based on combinators, which were introduced by Schönfinkel in 1920 with the idea of providing an analogous way to build up functions—and to remove any mention of variables—particularly in predicate logic. A combinator is a higher-order function that uses only function application and earlier defined combinators to define a result from its arguments.

==In mathematics==
Combinatory logic was originally intended as a &#x27;pre-logic&#x27; that would clarify the role of quantified variables in logic, essentially by eliminating them. Another way of eliminating quantified variables is Quine&#x27;s predicate functor logic. While the expressive power of combinatory logic typically exceeds that of first-order logic, the expressive power of predicate functor logic is identical to that of first order logic (Quine 1960, 1966, 1976).

The original inventor of combinatory logic, Moses Schönfinkel, published nothing on combinatory logic after his original 1924 paper. Haskell Curry rediscovered the combinators while working as an instructor at Princeton University in late 1927. In the late 1930s, Alonzo Church and his students at Princeton invented a rival formalism for functional abstraction, the lambda calculus, which proved more popular than combinatory logic. The upshot of these historical contingencies was that until theoretical computer science began taking an interest in combinatory logic in the 1960s and 1970s, nearly all work on the subject was by Haskell Curry and his students, or by Robert Feys in Belgium. Curry and Feys (1958), and Curry &quot;et al.&quot; (1972) survey the early history of combinatory logic. For a more modern treatment of combinatory logic and the lambda calculus together, see the book by Barendregt, which reviews the models Dana Scott devised for combinatory logic in the 1960s and 1970s.

==In computing==
In computer science, combinatory logic is used as a simplified model of computation, used in computability theory and proof theory. Despite its simplicity, combinatory logic captures many essential features of computation.

Combinatory logic can be viewed as a variant of the lambda calculus, in which lambda expressions (representing functional abstraction) are replaced by a limited set of &quot;combinators&quot;, primitive functions without free variables. It is easy to transform lambda expressions into combinator expressions, and combinator reduction is much simpler than lambda reduction. Hence combinatory logic has been used to model some non-strict functional programming languages and hardware. The purest form of this view is the programming language Unlambda, whose sole primitives are the S and K combinators augmented with character input/output. Although not a practical programming language, Unlambda is of some theoretical interest.

Combinatory logic can be given a variety of interpretations. Many early papers by Curry showed how to translate axiom sets for conventional logic into combinatory logic equations. Dana Scott in the 1960s and 1970s showed how to marry model theory and combinatory logic.

== Summary of lambda calculus ==
Lambda calculus is concerned with objects called &quot;lambda-terms&quot;, which can be represented by the following three forms of strings:
* 

where is a variable name drawn from a predefined infinite set of variable names, and and are lambda-terms.

Terms of the form are called &quot;abstractions&quot;. The variable &quot;v&quot; is called the formal parameter of the abstraction, and is the &quot;body&quot; of the abstraction. The term represents the function which, applied to an argument, binds the formal parameter &quot;v&quot; to the argument and then computes the resulting value of — that is, it returns , with every occurrence of &quot;v&quot; replaced by the argument.

Terms of the form are called &quot;applications&quot;. Applications model function invocation or execution: the function represented by is to be invoked, with as its argument, and the result is computed. If (sometimes called the &quot;applicand&quot;) is an abstraction, the term may be &quot;reduced&quot;: , the argument, may be substituted into the body of in place of the formal parameter of , and the result is a new lambda term which is &quot;equivalent&quot; to the old one. If a lambda term contains no subterms of the form then it cannot be reduced, and is said to be in normal form.

The expression represents the result of taking the term and replacing all free occurrences of in it with . Thus we write

By convention, we take as shorthand for (i.e., application is left associative).

The motivation for this definition of reduction is that it captures the essential behavior of all mathematical functions. For example, consider the function that computes the square of a number. We might write

:The square of &quot;x&quot; is 

(Using &quot;&quot; to indicate multiplication.) &quot;x&quot; here is the formal parameter of the function. To evaluate the square for a particular argument, say 3, we insert it into the definition in place of the formal parameter:

:The square of 3 is 

To evaluate the resulting expression , we would have to resort to our knowledge of multiplication and the number 3. Since any computation is simply a composition of the evaluation of suitable functions on suitable primitive arguments, this simple substitution principle suffices to capture the essential mechanism of computation.
Moreover, in lambda calculus, notions such as &#x27;3&#x27; and &quot; can be represented without any need for externally defined primitive operators or constants. It is possible to identify terms in lambda calculus, which, when suitably interpreted, behave like the number 3 and like the multiplication operator, q.v. Church encoding.

Lambda calculus is known to be computationally equivalent in power to many other plausible models for computation (including Turing machines); that is, any calculation that can be accomplished in any of these other models can be expressed in lambda calculus, and vice versa. According to the Church–Turing thesis, both models can express any possible computation.

It is perhaps surprising that lambda-calculus can represent any conceivable computation using only the simple notions of function abstraction and application based on simple textual substitution of terms for variables. But even more remarkable is that abstraction is not even required. &quot;Combinatory logic&quot; is a model of computation equivalent to lambda calculus, but without abstraction. The advantage of this is that evaluating expressions in lambda calculus is quite complicated because the semantics of substitution must be specified with great care to avoid variable capture problems. In contrast, evaluating expressions in combinatory logic is much simpler, because there is no notion of substitution.

== Combinatory calculi ==

Since abstraction is the only way to manufacture functions in the lambda calculus, something must replace it in the combinatory calculus. Instead of abstraction, combinatory calculus provides a limited set of primitive functions out of which other functions may be built.

=== Combinatory terms ===

A combinatory term has one of the following forms:

The primitive functions are &quot;combinators&quot;, or functions that, when seen as lambda terms, contain no free variables.

To shorten the notations, a general convention is that , or even , denotes the term . This is the same general convention (left-associativity) as for multiple application in lambda calculus.

=== Reduction in combinatory logic ===

In combinatory logic, each primitive combinator comes with a reduction rule of the form

where &quot;E&quot; is a term mentioning only variables from the set . It is in this way that primitive combinators behave as functions.

=== Examples of combinators ===

The simplest example of a combinator is I, the identity combinator, defined by

:(I &quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;

for all terms &quot;x&quot;. Another simple combinator is K, which manufactures constant functions: (K &quot;x&quot;) is the function which, for any argument, returns &quot;x&quot;, so we say

:((K &quot;x&quot;) &quot;y&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;

for all terms &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. Or, following the convention for multiple application,

:(K &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;

A third combinator is S, which is a generalized version of application:

:(S &quot;x y z&quot;) = (&quot;x z&quot; (&quot;y z&quot;))

S applies &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot; after first substituting &quot;z&quot; into
each of them. Or put another way, &quot;x&quot; is applied to &quot;y&quot; inside the environment &quot;z&quot;.

Given S and K, I itself is unnecessary, since it can be built from the other two:

:((S K K) &quot;x&quot;)
:: = (S K K &quot;x&quot;)
:: = (K &quot;x&quot; (K &quot;x&quot;))
:: = &quot;x&quot;

for any term &quot;x&quot;. Note that although ((S K K)
&quot;x&quot;) = (I &quot;x&quot;) for any &quot;x&quot;, (S K K)
itself is not equal to I. We say the terms are extensionally equal. Extensional equality captures the mathematical notion of the equality of functions: that two functions are &quot;equal&quot; if they always produce the same results for the same arguments. In contrast, the terms themselves, together with the reduction of primitive combinators, capture the notion of &quot;intensional equality&quot; of functions: that two functions are &quot;equal&quot; only if they have identical implementations up to the expansion of primitive combinators. There are many ways to implement an identity function; (S K K) and I are among these ways. (S K S) is yet another. We will use the word &quot;equivalent&quot; to indicate extensional equality, reserving &quot;equal&quot; for identical combinatorial terms.

A more interesting combinator is the fixed point combinator or Y combinator, which can be used to implement recursion.

=== Completeness of the S-K basis ===

S and K can be composed to produce combinators that are extensionally equal to &quot;any&quot; lambda term, and therefore, by Church&#x27;s thesis, to any computable function whatsoever. The proof is to present a transformation, , which converts an arbitrary lambda term into an equivalent combinator.

 may be defined as follows:
# 
# (if &quot;x&quot; does not occur free in &quot;E&quot;)
# (if &quot;x&quot; occurs free in &quot;E&quot;)
# (if &quot;x&quot; occurs free in &quot;E&quot; or &quot;E&quot;)

Note that &quot;T&quot;[ ] as given is not a well-typed mathematical function, but rather a term rewriter: Although it eventually yields a combinator, the transformation may generate intermediary expressions that are neither lambda terms nor combinators, via rule (5).

This process is also known as &quot;abstraction elimination&quot;. This definition is exhaustive: any lambda expression will be subject to exactly one of these rules (see Summary of lambda calculus above).

It is related to the process of &quot;bracket abstraction&quot;, which takes an expression &quot;E&quot; built from variables and application and produces a combinator expression [x]E in which the variable x is not free, such that [&quot;x&quot;]&quot;E x&quot; = &quot;E&quot; holds. A very simple algorithm for bracket abstraction is defined by induction on the structure of expressions as follows:
# [&quot;x&quot;]&quot;y&quot; := K &quot;y&quot;
# [&quot;x&quot;]&quot;x&quot; := I
# [&quot;x&quot;](&quot;E&quot; &quot;E&quot;) := S([&quot;x&quot;]&quot;E&quot;)([&quot;x&quot;]&quot;E&quot;)
Bracket abstraction induces a translation from lambda terms to combinator expressions, by interpreting lambda-abstractions using the bracket abstraction algorithm.

==== Conversion of a lambda term to an equivalent combinatorial term ====

For example, we will convert the lambda term &quot;λx&quot;.&quot;λy&quot;.(&quot;y&quot; &quot;x&quot;) to a combinatorial term:

:&quot;T&quot;[&quot;λx&quot;.&quot;λy&quot;.(&quot;y&quot; &quot;x&quot;)]
:: = &quot;T&#x27;λx&quot;.&quot;T&#x27;λy&quot;.(&quot;y&quot; &quot;x&quot;) (by 5)
:: = &quot;T&quot;[&quot;λx&quot;.(S &quot;T&quot;[&quot;λy&quot;.&quot;y&quot;] &quot;T&quot;[&quot;λy&quot;.&quot;x&quot;])] (by 6)
:: = &quot;T&quot;[&quot;λx&quot;.(S I &quot;T&quot;[&quot;λy&quot;.&quot;x&quot;])] (by 4)
:: = &quot;T&quot;[&quot;λx&quot;.(S I (K &quot;T&quot;[&quot;x&quot;]))] (by 3)
:: = &quot;T&quot;[&quot;λx&quot;.(S I (K &quot;x&quot;))] (by 1)
:: = (S &quot;T&quot;[&quot;λx&quot;.(S I)] &quot;T&quot;[&quot;λx&quot;.(K &quot;x&quot;)]) (by 6)
:: = (S (K (S I)) &quot;T&quot;[&quot;λx&quot;.(K &quot;x&quot;)]) (by 3)
:: = (S (K (S I)) (S &quot;T&quot;[&quot;λx&quot;.K] &quot;T&quot;[&quot;λx&quot;.&quot;x&quot;])) (by 6)
:: = (S (K (S I)) (S (K K) &quot;T&quot;[&quot;λx&quot;.&quot;x&quot;])) (by 3)
:: = (S (K (S I)) (S (K K) I)) (by 4)

If we apply this combinatorial term to any two terms &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; (by feeding them in a queue-like fashion into the combinator &#x27;from the right&#x27;), it reduces as follows:

: (S (K (S I)) (S (K K) I) x y)
:: = (K (S I) x (S (K K) I x) y)
:: = (S I (S (K K) I x) y)
:: = (I y (S (K K) I x y))
:: = (y (S (K K) I x y))
:: = (y (K K x (I x) y))
:: = (y (K (I x) y))
:: = (y (I x))
:: = (y x)

The combinatory representation, (S (K (S I)) (S (K K) I)) is much longer than the representation as a lambda term, &quot;λx&quot;.&quot;λy&quot;.(y x). This is typical. In general, the &quot;T&quot;[ ] construction may expand a lambda term of length &quot;n&quot; to a combinatorial term of length Θ(&quot;n&quot;3).

==== Explanation of the &quot;T&quot;[ ] transformation ====

The &quot;T&quot;[ ] transformation is motivated by a desire to eliminate abstraction. Two special cases, rules 3 and 4, are trivial: &quot;λx&quot;.&quot;x&quot; is clearly equivalent to I, and &quot;λx&quot;.&quot;E&quot; is clearly equivalent to (K &quot;T&quot;[&quot;E&quot;]) if &quot;x&quot; does not appear free in &quot;E&quot;.

The first two rules are also simple: Variables convert to themselves, and applications, which are allowed in combinatory terms, are converted to combinators simply by converting the applicand and the argument to combinators.

It is rules 5 and 6 that are of interest. Rule 5 simply says that to convert a complex abstraction to a combinator, we must first convert its body to a combinator, and then eliminate the abstraction. Rule 6 actually eliminates the abstraction.

&quot;λx&quot;.(&quot;E&quot; &quot;E&quot;) is a function which takes an argument, say &quot;a&quot;, and substitutes it into the lambda term (&quot;E&quot; &quot;E&quot;) in place of &quot;x&quot;, yielding (&quot;E&quot; &quot;E&quot;)[&quot;x&quot; : = &quot;a&quot;]. But substituting &quot;a&quot; into (&quot;E&quot; &quot;E&quot;) in place of &quot;x&quot; is just the same as substituting it into both &quot;E&quot; and &quot;E&quot;, so

:(&quot;E&quot; &quot;E&quot;)[&quot;x&quot; := &quot;a&quot;] = (&quot;E&quot;[&quot;x&quot; := &quot;a&quot;] &quot;E&quot;[&quot;x&quot; := &quot;a&quot;])

:(&quot;λx&quot;.(&quot;E&quot; &quot;E&quot;) &quot;a&quot;) = ((&quot;λx&quot;.&quot;E&quot; &quot;a&quot;) (&quot;λx&quot;.&quot;E&quot; &quot;a&quot;))
:::::= (S &quot;λx&quot;.&quot;E&quot; &quot;λx&quot;.&quot;E&quot; &quot;a&quot;)
:::::= ((S &quot;λx&quot;.&quot;E&quot; &quot;λx&quot;.&quot;E&quot;) &quot;a&quot;)

By extensional equality,

:&quot;λx&quot;.(&quot;E&quot; &quot;E&quot;) = (S &quot;λx&quot;.&quot;E&quot; &quot;λx&quot;.&quot;E&quot;)

Therefore, to find a combinator equivalent to &quot;λx&quot;.(&quot;E&quot; &quot;E&quot;), it is sufficient to find a combinator equivalent to (S &quot;λx&quot;.&quot;E&quot; &quot;λx&quot;.&quot;E&quot;), and

:(S &quot;T&quot;[&quot;λx&quot;.&quot;E&quot;] &quot;T&quot;[&quot;λx&quot;.&quot;E&quot;])

evidently fits the bill. &quot;E&quot; and &quot;E&quot; each contain strictly fewer applications than (&quot;E&quot; &quot;E&quot;), so the recursion must terminate in a lambda term with no applications at all—either a variable, or a term of the
form &quot;λx&quot;.&quot;E&quot;.

=== Simplifications of the transformation ===

==== η-reduction ====

The combinators generated by the &quot;T&quot;[ ] transformation can be made smaller if we take into account the &quot;η-reduction&quot; rule:

:&quot;T&quot;[&quot;λx&quot;.(&quot;E&quot; &quot;x&quot;)] = &quot;T&quot;[&quot;E&quot;] (if &quot;x&quot; is not free in &quot;E&quot;)

&quot;λx&quot;.(&quot;E&quot; x) is the function which takes an argument, &quot;x&quot;, and applies the function &quot;E&quot; to it; this is extensionally equal to the function &quot;E&quot; itself. It is therefore sufficient to convert &quot;E&quot; to combinatorial form.

Taking this simplification into account, the example above becomes:

:&quot;T&quot;[&quot;λx&quot;.&quot;λy&quot;.(&quot;y&quot; &quot;x&quot;)]
:= (S (K (S I)) &quot;T&quot;[&quot;λx&quot;.(K &quot;x&quot;)])
:= (S (K (S I)) K) (by η-reduction)

This combinator is equivalent to the earlier, longer one:

:(S (K (S I)) K &quot;x y&quot;)
:= (K (S I) &quot;x&quot; (K &quot;x&quot;) &quot;y&quot;)
:= (S I (K &quot;x&quot;) &quot;y&quot;)
:= (I &quot;y&quot; (K &quot;x y&quot;))
:= (&quot;y&quot; (K &quot;x y&quot;))
:= (&quot;y x&quot;)

Similarly, the original version of the &quot;T&quot;[ ] transformation transformed the identity function &quot;λf&quot;.&quot;λx&quot;.(&quot;f&quot; &quot;x&quot;) into (S (S (K S) (S (K K) I)) (K I)). With the η-reduction rule, &quot;λf&quot;.&quot;λx&quot;.(&quot;f&quot; &quot;x&quot;) is
transformed into I.

==== One-point basis ====

There are one-point bases from which every combinator can be composed extensionally equal to &quot;any&quot; lambda term. The simplest example of such a basis is {X} where:

:X ≡ &quot;λx&quot;.((xS)K)

It is not difficult to verify that:
:X (X (X X)) =β K and
:X (X (X (X X))) =β S.

Since {K, S} is a basis, it follows that {X} is a basis too. The Iota programming language uses X as its sole combinator.

Another simple example of a one-point basis is:

:X&#x27; ≡ &quot;λx&quot;.(x K S K) with
:(X&#x27; X&#x27;) X&#x27; =β K and
:X&#x27; (X&#x27; X&#x27;) =β S

In fact, there exist infinitely many such bases.

==== Combinators B, C ====

In addition to S and K, included two combinators which are now called B and C, with the following reductions:

:(C &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;x&quot;) = ((&quot;f&quot; &quot;x&quot;) &quot;g&quot;)
:(B &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot; &quot;x&quot;) = (&quot;f&quot; (&quot;g&quot; &quot;x&quot;))

He also explains how they in turn can be expressed using only S and K:

:B = (S (K S) K) 
:C = (S (S (K (S (K S) K)) S) (K K))

These combinators are extremely useful when translating predicate logic or lambda calculus into combinator expressions. They were also used by Curry, and much later by David Turner, whose name has been associated with their computational use. Using them, we can extend the rules for the transformation as follows:
#
# (if &quot;x&quot; is not free in &quot;E&quot;)
# (if &quot;x&quot; is free in &quot;E&quot;)
# (if &quot;x&quot; is free in both &quot;E&quot; and &quot;E&quot;)
# (if &quot;x&quot; is free in &quot;E&quot; but not &quot;E&quot;)
# (if &quot;x&quot; is free in &quot;E&quot; but not &quot;E&quot;)

Using B and C combinators, the transformation of &quot;λx&quot;.&quot;λy&quot;.(&quot;y&quot; &quot;x&quot;) looks like this:
:
: (by rule 7)
: (η-reduction)
:formula_1 (traditional canonical notation: formula_2)
:formula_3 (traditional canonical notation: formula_4)

And indeed, (C I &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot;) does reduce to (&quot;y&quot; &quot;x&quot;):

:(C I &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot;)
:= (I &quot;y&quot; &quot;x&quot;)
:= (&quot;y&quot; &quot;x&quot;)

The motivation here is that B and C are limited versions of S. Whereas S takes a value and substitutes it into both the applicand and its argument before performing the application, C performs the
substitution only in the applicand, and B only in the argument.

The modern names for the combinators come from Haskell Curry&#x27;s doctoral thesis of 1930 (see B, C, K, W System). In Schönfinkel&#x27;s original paper, what we now call S, K, I, B and C were called S, C, I, Z, and T respectively.

The reduction in combinator size that results from the new transformation rules can also be achieved without introducing B and C, as demonstrated in Section 3.2 of .

===== CLK versus CLI calculus =====
A distinction must be made between the CLK as described in this article and the CLI calculus. The distinction corresponds to that between the λK and the λI calculus. Unlike the λK calculus, the λI calculus restricts abstractions to:
::&quot;λx&quot;.&quot;E&quot; where &quot;x&quot; has at least one free occurrence in &quot;E&quot;.
As a consequence, combinator K is not present in the λI calculus nor in the CLI calculus. The constants of CLI are: I, B, C and S, which form a basis from which all CLI terms can be composed (modulo equality). Every λI term can be converted into an equal CLI combinator according to rules similar to those presented above for the conversion of λK terms into CLK combinators. See chapter 9 in Barendregt (1984).

=== Reverse conversion ===

The conversion &quot;L&quot;[ ] from combinatorial terms to lambda terms is trivial:

:&quot;L&quot;[I] = &quot;λx&quot;.&quot;x&quot;
:&quot;L&quot;[K] = &quot;λx&quot;.&quot;λy&quot;.&quot;x&quot;
:&quot;L&quot;[C] = &quot;λx&quot;.&quot;λy&quot;.&quot;λz&quot;.(&quot;x&quot; &quot;z&quot; &quot;y&quot;)
:&quot;L&quot;[B] = &quot;λx&quot;.&quot;λy&quot;.&quot;λz&quot;.(&quot;x&quot; (&quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot;))
:&quot;L&quot;[S] = &quot;λx&quot;.&quot;λy&quot;.&quot;λz&quot;.(&quot;x&quot; &quot;z&quot; (&quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot;))
:&quot;L&quot;[(&quot;E&quot; &quot;E&quot;)] = (&quot;L&quot;[&quot;E&quot;] &quot;L&quot;[&quot;E&quot;])

Note, however, that this transformation is not the inverse
transformation of any of the versions of &quot;T&quot;[ ] that we have seen.

== Undecidability of combinatorial calculus ==

A normal form is any combinatory term in which the primitive combinators that occur, if any, are not applied to enough arguments to be simplified. It is undecidable whether a general combinatory term has a normal form; whether two combinatory terms are equivalent, etc. This can be shown in a similar way as for the corresponding problems for lambda terms.

=== Undefinability by predicates ===
The undecidable problems above (equivalence, existence of normal form, etc.) take as input syntactic representations of terms under a suitable encoding (e.g., Church encoding). One may also consider a toy trivial computation model where we &quot;compute&quot; properties of terms by means of combinators applied directly to the terms themselves as arguments, rather than to their syntactic representations. More precisely, let a &quot;predicate&quot; be a combinator that, when applied, returns either T or F (where T and F represent the conventional Church encodings of true and false, &quot;λx&quot;.&quot;λy&quot;.&quot;x&quot; and &quot;λx&quot;.&quot;λy&quot;.&quot;y&quot;, transformed into combinatory logic; the combinatory versions have and ). A predicate N is &quot;nontrivial&quot; if there are two arguments &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; such that N &quot;A&quot; = T and N &quot;B&quot; = F. A combinator N is &quot;complete&quot; if N&quot;M&quot; has a normal form for every argument &quot;M&quot;. An analogue of Rice&#x27;s theorem for this toy model then says that every complete predicate is trivial. The proof of this theorem is rather simple.

From this undefinability theorem it immediately follows that there is no complete predicate that can discriminate between terms that have a normal form and terms that do not have a normal form. It also follows that there is no complete predicate, say EQUAL, such that:
:(EQUAL &quot;A B&quot;) = T if &quot;A&quot; = &quot;B&quot; and
:(EQUAL &quot;A B&quot;) = F if &quot;A&quot; ≠ &quot;B&quot;.
If EQUAL would exist, then for all &quot;A&quot;, &quot;λx.&quot;(EQUAL &quot;x A&quot;) would have to be a complete non trivial predicate.

However, note that it also immediately follows from this undefinability theorem that many properties of terms that are obviously decidable are not definable by complete predicates either: e.g., there is no predicate that could tell whether the first primitive function letter occurring in a term is a K. This shows that definability by predicates is a not a reasonable model of decidability.

== Applications ==

=== Compilation of functional languages ===

David Turner used his combinators to implement the SASL programming language.

Kenneth E. Iverson used primitives based on Curry&#x27;s combinators in his J programming language, a successor to APL. This enabled what Iverson called tacit programming, that is, programming in functional expressions containing no variables, along with powerful tools for working with such programs. It turns out that tacit programming is possible in any APL-like language with user-defined operators.

=== Logic ===
The Curry–Howard isomorphism implies a connection between logic and programming: every proof of a theorem of intuitionistic logic corresponds to a reduction of a typed lambda term, and conversely. Moreover, theorems can be identified with function type signatures. Specifically, a typed combinatory logic corresponds to a Hilbert system in proof theory.

The K and S combinators correspond to the axioms
:AK: &quot;A&quot; → (&quot;B&quot; → &quot;A&quot;),
:AS: (&quot;A&quot; → (&quot;B&quot; → &quot;C&quot;)) → ((&quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot;) → (&quot;A&quot; → &quot;C&quot;)),
and function application corresponds to the detachment (modus ponens) rule
:MP: from &quot;A&quot; and &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; infer &quot;B&quot;.
The calculus consisting of AK, AS, and MP is complete for the implicational fragment of the intuitionistic logic, which can be seen as follows. Consider the set &quot;W&quot; of all deductively closed sets of formulas, ordered by inclusion. Then formula_5 is an intuitionistic Kripke frame, and we define a model formula_6 in this frame by
:formula_7
This definition obeys the conditions on satisfaction of →: on one hand, if formula_8, and formula_9 is such that formula_10 and formula_11, then formula_12 by modus ponens. On the other hand, if formula_13, then formula_14 by the deduction theorem, thus the deductive closure of formula_15 is an element formula_9 such that formula_10, formula_11, and formula_19.

Let &quot;A&quot; be any formula which is not provable in the calculus. Then &quot;A&quot; does not belong to the deductive closure &quot;X&quot; of the empty set, thus formula_20, and &quot;A&quot; is not intuitionistically valid.

<text>Brighouse (, locally also ) is a town within the metropolitan borough of Calderdale, in West Yorkshire, England. Historically within the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is situated on the River Calder, east of Halifax. It is served by Junction 25 of the M62 motorway and Brighouse railway station on the Caldervale Line and Huddersfield Line. In the town centre is a mooring basin on the Calder and Hebble Navigation. The United Kingdom Census 2001 gave the Brighouse / Rastrick subdivision of the West Yorkshire Urban Area a population of 32,360. The Brighouse ward of Calderdale Council gave a population of 11,195 at the 2011 Census. Brighouse has a HD6 postcode. 

The name Brighouse (or &quot;Bridge House&quot;) originates from a building on (or close to) the bridge over the River Calder. In its early history, it was a hamlet of the nearby village of Rastrick.

Brighouse is twinned with Lüdenscheid in Germany, the link beginning with an exchange by Brighouse Children&#x27;s Theatre in 1950 followed by a civic twinning charter in 1960.

==History==

There was a river crossing called Snake Hill Ford across the Calder – believed to have formed part of the Roman route between Wakefield and Manchester. A wooden structure called Rastrick Bridge was recorded in 1275. The bridge was replaced by another built with timber donated by John Hanson in 1514. Hanson&#x27;s son funded a stone replacement for this bridge in 1558. The river provided power for the flour milling industry and the textile mills. Brighouse&#x27;s industry received a boost through the construction of the Calder and Hebble Navigation, started in 1757 by the engineer John Smeaton. The town was incorporated in 1893.

The Halifax and Huddersfield Turnpike Act 1824 (5 Geo. 4. c. ciii) allowed for the building of Calder Bridge, or Brighouse Bridge, over the river on what was to become the A641 road; tolls were abolished on the bridge in 1875 and extensive widening work was undertaken in 1905 and 1999 (both of these latter dates being commemorated in dedication stones on the bridge).

==Governance==

Brighouse was historically part of the township of Hipperholme with Brighouse in the large ancient parish of Halifax. The township became a civil parish in 1866, but was abolished in 1894 and divided: Brighouse became a municipal borough (and civil parish), Hipperholme became an urban district and Norwood Green and Coley became a civil parish in Halifax Rural District. The Municipal Borough of Brighouse was expanded in 1915 when Rastrick was absorbed, and in 1937 when Clifton CP, Hipperholme UD, Norwood Green and Coley CP and part of Southowram UD were added. Brighouse borough and civil parish were abolished in 1974 when it became part of Calderdale Metropolitan Borough. The mayor&#x27;s mace was removed in 1974 to the Town Hall, Halifax, where it is displayed in the mayor&#x27;s parlour to denote the authority of the Halifax mayor.

=== Brighouse Town Board ===
Calderdale Council established Town Boards to assist with regenerating Calderdale&#x27;s Town Centres. The boards are made up of local councillors and community representatives. The first Brighouse Town Board meeting (28 March 2017) appointed Councillors from Brighouse, Hipperholme &amp; Lightclifee, Rastrick Wards, and community members, who represent local business and residents. Brighouse Town Board works with public, private and voluntary organisations, and takes a strategic view of the needs and opportunities of the local area.

==Buildings==
The town&#x27;s mills have undergone an extensive programme of renovation and become loft-style apartments.

Brighouse Library is a large building and in addition to its normal lending library services provides facilities for language courses, internet access and fax facilities. Like most public buildings wheelchair access is provided. There is also a small cafe and a lift for access to all floors.

The main shopping streets are Commercial Street and Bethel Street. In early 2000, a financial agreement made between Tesco and Brighouse Sports Club, allowed for a huge new Tesco superstore to be built on the site of the former club, and the old Tesco became Wilkos. The deal also enabled the sports club to build new premises almost a mile away (1.5 km) on land at Russell Way, Bailiff Bridge.

The Old Ship Inn has a painted legend along the front, saying that the exterior timbers were salvaged from an old ship. Originally called &quot;The Prince of Wales&quot;, the building was rebuilt from timbers reclaimed from HMS Donegal in 1926.

The ROKT building on Mill Royd Street is the UK&#x27;s tallest outdoor man-made climbing wall, at 36m tall it is taller than the Tower of London, although it is temporarily closed as a result of flooding and financial losses during the COVID 19 Pandemic.

==Religion==
===St James Church, Brighouse===
St James&#x27;s Church, which was a chapel of ease for the Parish Church of Saint Martin in Brighouse, opened in 1870, with a congregation of 450. An organ was installed in the same year. Two stained glass windows from the William Morris factory, designed by Edward Burne-Jones were installed in July 1871. Further windows were added at later dates by other designers. In 1900 William Camm the organist paid for the fitting of a window in memory of his mother. A further window to commemorate the curate Rev Alban Bodley Mace (1915), who was killed in action at Salonika during 1916, serving with the Allied Expeditionary Force. The chancel screen was designed by G. H. Woodhouse of Manchester. St James Church was last used on 27 December 1970; and then demolished, with the land used for residential properties. The stained glass windows were removed and taken into the care of the Cliffe Castle Museum in Keighley where they can now be viewed.

===St Joseph&#x27;s Church, Brighouse===
St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church was built in the early 1900s, on Martin Street. In 1879 a primary school was established, using the church hall from Monday to Friday. It remained in use until 4 September 1961, when a new school was built on Finkil Street. The church is aligned with St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church in Elland.

===Central Methodist Church, Brighouse===
The Central Methodist Church is situated at the west end of Brighouse backing on to the Lüdenscheid Link with a side entry at the lower part of Parsonage Lane. The frontage overlooks a small car park.

==Arts and media==
Smith Art Gallery is in the Brighouse Library and features many paintings from the Victorian era displayed in the main hall, in addition to a changing programme of exhibitions of artwork by local artists.

The &quot;Calderdale Nightingale&quot;, Susan Sunderland, was born in Brighouse in 1819 and lived here all her life. She never sought fame but was considered one of the best singers in the country and she sang concerts including those for Queen Victoria.

Brighouse was the original home of the Brighouse and Rastrick Brass Band, founded in 1881 and associated with neighbouring Rastrick. They originally formed under the name the &quot;Brighouse and Rastrick Temperance Brass Band&quot; taking their current title in the early 20th century.
They are currently based next to Brighouse High School in Hove Edge, just north of Brighouse. In 1977 the band recorded &quot;The Floral Dance&quot; which reached Number 2 in the UK Top 40 and stayed there for 6 weeks. In 1968, the band won the inaugural Brass Band World Championship, and in 1993 became the first Yorkshire team to win the All England Masters Brass Band Championship, a feat repeated in 1998. The band won the National Brass Band Championship Finals in 1946, 1968, 1969, 1973, 1980, 1997, 1998, 2010, 2011 and 2017, and the European Championships in 1981 and 1998.

The town is also home to the Yorkshire Co-op Brass band, formed in 1999 by merger of the Jayess &#x27;87 and Jayess Queensbury bands.

The area is home to rock band Embrace, who have had three UK number one albums. The town is mentioned in &quot;It&#x27;s Grim Up North&quot; by the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (The JAMS).

A local drum &amp; bugle corps, Conquest Alliance was formed, in 1985, by the merger of the Northern Skyryders and Brighouse RBL (Legion). The following year, 1986, Conquest Alliance appeared on the Drum Corp United Kingdom (DCUK) field of competition and were declared co-champions of the DCUK. In 1987 the corps was placed 1st, 5th in 1988, 2nd in 1989, and 4th in 1990.
The corps disbanded in 1990.

===Media===
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Emley Moor TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Leeds, Heart Yorkshire, Capital Yorkshire, Hits Radio West Yorkshire, Greatest Hits Radio West Yorkshire and Phoenix Radio, a community based radio station. 

The local newspapers are the &quot;Brighouse Echo&quot;, the &quot;Halifax Courier&quot;, the &quot;Mirfield Reporter&quot; and the &quot;Huddersfield Daily Examiner&quot;

==Sport==
Brighouse Rangers Rugby league Club, founded in 1878, are based at the Brighouse Sports Club Complex on Russell Way (Off A641 Bradford Road) between Brighouse town centre and Bailiff Bridge. The club competes at amateur level in the Pennine League&#x27;s premier Division and fields a reserve side in Division Six. There is a junior section for under 18&#x27;s, down to Under 8&#x27;s, and a ladies side.

Before the 1895 schism in English rugby, William Nicholl played rugby union for England, and Brighouse Rangers. After the schism, Brighouse Rangers became a founder member of the Northern Rugby Football Union (now Rugby Football League), and the first Northern Rugby Football Union chairman was Mr. H. H. Waller from the club. Brighouse Rangers played from 1895–96 to 1905–06 winning the Yorkshire League in the 1896–97 season. Although finishing last in the 14-club elite league in the 1901–02 season, the club was not relegated as the league expanded to 18 clubs. In the 1902–03 season Brighouse finished 18th and was relegated. After finishing bottom of the 31-club recombined league in the 1905–06 season, the club withdrew from the Northern Union.

As of the 2023–24 season, Brighouse Town F.C. play in the Pitching In Northern Premier League Division One East at level 8 of the National League System (also known as &#x27;The Football Pyramid&#x27;). Brighouse has its own Sunday League football competition, which in the 2007–08 season had one division of 10 teams. Junction (Rastrick) were crowned champions on 20 April 2008. There are many Junior football teams in the area too such as Brighouse Juniors, which was started by parents in 1989, who go from Under 6&#x27;s up to Under 17&#x27;s.

The town is on the route of the 50 mile Calderdale Way circular walk around the hills and valleys of Calderdale.

==Transport==
The A641 northward links Brighouse with Bradford and southward with Huddersfield. The A644 runs eastward out of Brighouse to Junction 25 of the M62 and Dewsbury. In the opposite direction, the A644 leaves Brighouse to the north-west towards Hipperholme, where it crosses the A58 Leeds-Halifax road, and continues through Queensbury to meet the A629 for Keighley. The A643 and A6025 provide less important local links, although the A643 is an alternative route through to Leeds.

A bypass, originally called Elland Road, then renamed Lüdenscheid Link in the 1980s, after Brighouse&#x27;s twin town in Germany, was constructed in the 1970s to clear heavy traffic from the narrow streets in the town centre.

Brighouse railway station reopened in 2000 and provides the town with access to the National Rail network. All services are sponsored by Metro and provided by Northern. The current service is part of both the Huddersfield Line and the Calder Valley line, with services on the Huddersfield Line between Leeds and Manchester Victoria via Dewsbury and services on the Caldervale Line between Leeds and Huddersfield via Bradford and Halifax. Direct services to London Kings Cross are also available, with four services per day provided by Grand Central.

Bus services operate frequently to Halifax like the 549 and 548 and Huddersfield like the 549 and X63. Plus Bradford by using the 686, X63 and the 688 which runs at the weekend. There is also an hourly service to Leeds, the Arriva run service 254. These are coordinated by West Yorkshire Metro. Services are operated by First Bradford, First Calderdale &amp; Huddersfield, Team Pennine and South Pennine Community Transport. Brighouse bus station has been refurbished with funding from Metro and re-opened in May 2009. The bus station is between Commercial Street and the bypass. The bus station and some bus stops in the Brighouse area are equipped with Real Time Passenger Information Screens.

The Calder and Hebble Navigation links Brighouse with Wakefield (junction with the Aire and Calder Navigation), Mirfield (junction with the Huddersfield Broad Canal) and Sowerby Bridge (junction with the Rochdale Canal).

<doc id="149857" wikidata="Q5019017" url="?curid=149857" title="Calder and Hebble Navigation">
<text>The Calder and Hebble Navigation is a broad inland waterway, with locks and bridge holes that are suitable for boats, in West Yorkshire, England. Construction to improve the River Calder and the River Hebble began in 1759, and the initial scheme, which included of new cuts, was completed in 1770 and has remained navigable since it was opened. Significant improvements were made, including the Salterhebble branch to Halifax, opened in 1828, and ever-longer cuts to bypass river sections. Trade was assisted by the opening of the Rochdale Canal in 1804, which provided a through route from Sowerby Bridge to Manchester. There were plans to abandon the river sections completely in the 1830s, but these were modified as the needs of mill owners and other riparian landowners were recognised.

With the coming of the railways, the canal was leased to the Manchester and Leeds Railway in 1843, but this was subsequently deemed to be illegal, and the Aire and Calder Navigation with which the Calder and Hebble Navigation connected at its eastern end, leased the canal from September 1847 until 1885. Some of the locks were enlarged, but many were not, and having been designed for Yorkshire Keels, they remain among the shortest on the English connected waterways network, at . The navigation became a cul-de-sac in the 20th century, but with the burgeoning interest in leisure use of the canals, the trans-Pennine Rochdale Canal was reopened in 1996 and the Huddersfield Narrow Canal followed in 2001, resulting in the navigation becoming part of three Pennine cruising rings.

==History==
By the beginning of the 18th century, the Aire and Calder Navigation had made the River Calder navigable as far upstream as Wakefield. The aim of the Calder and Hebble Navigation was to extend navigation west (upstream) from Wakefield to Sowerby Bridge near Halifax.

The first attempt to obtain an act of Parliament was made in 1740, as a result of a petition by the people of Halifax, Ripponden and Elland. John Eyes of Liverpool surveyed the route, and presented a scheme for a navigation which would use the River Calder from Wakefield to its junction with the River Hebble, follow the Hebble to Salterhebble bridge, and then follow the Halifax Brook to reach Halifax. It included the construction of 24 locks, 21 on the Calder and three on the Hebble, and nearly of cuts, including one of at Horbury. The bill was defeated, due to opposition from local landowners who feared that it would cause flooding, from millers, who thought that navigation would disrupt their water supply, and from the promoters of several Turnpike Bills, who were intending to build roads which would follow a similar route.
The second attempt followed a meeting of the Union Club in Halifax on 2 September 1756, which considered how to improve the import of wool and corn to the town. They invited the civil engineer John Smeaton to make a new survey, which he did in late 1757, and produced a scheme which involved dredging shoals, making of cuts, the building of 26 locks, to overcome the rise of between Wakefield and the Halifax Brook, and the construction of a reservoir at Salterhebble bridge. A committee raising subscriptions for the project in Rochdale insisted that the plans should be amended to include an extension to Sowerby Bridge, despite opposition from the Halifax committee. An act of Parliament, the (31 Geo. 2. c. 72), was obtained on 9 June 1758, for this extended route, and created commissioners, who had to own an estate valued at more than £100, or have a personal fortune of more than £3,000. Any nine of the commissioners could make decisions.

===Construction===
Construction started in November 1759, with Smeaton acting as engineer. By November 1764, the navigation was open as far as Brighouse, some from Wakefield. Having borrowed £56,000, factions arose within the commissioners, with some wanting to stop at Brooksmouth, where the Rivers Hebble and Calder meet, and others wanting to raise more money and complete the scheme. The second option gained most support, and a new committee was set up, who asked James Brindley to take over from Smeaton in 1765. The work was nearly completed by 1767, but serious floods in October caused some damage, with further damage caused by more floods in February 1768. Brindley appears to have left by mid-1766, and the Commissioners re-appointed Smeaton in 1768, to complete the work. Banks were repaired and floodgates built at the start of some of the cuts. The work was just complete when a further flood caused so much damage that the only option was to close the navigation again.
By this time, £64,000 had been spent on the scheme, of which £8,100 had come from tolls and the rest had been borrowed. The Commissioners felt unable to borrow more money, and so a second act of Parliament, the (9 Geo. 3. c. 71), was obtained on 21 April 1769, which formally created the Company of Proprietors of the Calder and Hebble Navigation. This consisted of all of the 81 people who had loaned money to the original scheme, and these loans were converted into £100 shares. Additional shares could be issued, and the company could borrow up to £20,000, with the future tolls used as security. Before the act, the scheme had been known as the Calder Navigation or Upper Calder Navigation, and this was the first use of the Calder and Hebble title. The act was the first navigation act to include a clause which limited dividends, insisting that tolls should be reduced if the dividend exceeded ten per cent. Construction of the initial phase was finished in 1770, at a total cost of around £75,000.

There were initial problems with the water supply to the Sowerby Bridge pound, which Smeaton was asked to address. He suggested a tunnel from Hollins Mill, similar to those used for draining collieries. Construction began in June 1772, and was completed in March 1794. Other improvements followed, with a new cut between Shepley Bridge and Mirfield started in December 1775 supervised by William Jessop, and the raising of water levels in 1776 to allow boats to carry additional cargo. A new cut at Brighouse was added in 1780, while the two staircase locks at Salterhebble and the single lock at Brooksmouth were replaced at Smeaton&#x27;s suggestion by three new locks in 1782.

===Development===
The navigation prospered, with dividends rising steadily from 5 per cent in 1771 to 13 per cent in 1792. Under the terms of the act of Parliament, tolls were reduced when the dividend exceeded 10 per cent, and the first such reduction occurred in 1791. Improvements continued, and were funded by making calls on the original shareholders. This provided a way to increase their income without exceeding the 10 per cent dividend limit. In 1798 a long cut at Thornhill was made, bypassing the town of Dewsbury. Trade with the town was maintained by the construction of a wharf and warehouse in what is now Savile Town Basin Dewsbury, however this was not until 1877. Another stimulus to trade was provided by the Rochdale Canal, which opened up a through route from Sowerby Bridge to Manchester from 1804. A new cut and a lock were constructed at Brookfoot. near Brighouse. between 1805 and 1808, while the Elland cut was extended to link up with the Sowerby cut in 1815. There were further reductions in the tolls in 1801, 1804 and 1808.
In 1806, the company agreed with the Aire and Calder Canal to replace the lock at Fall Ings with a new cut (Fall Ings Cut) and a pair of locks, the work to be jointly funded. Legal challenges from millers resulted in some delay, but the cut was opened in 1812. By 1823, as a result of pressure from carriers, boats were allowed to use the navigation at any time during the week, but the company refrained from authorising use on Sundays as they could not &quot;&quot;consent to so great a Deviation from established Custom&quot;.&quot;
A new act of Parliament, the (6 Geo. 4. c. xvii), was obtained on 31 March 1825, which authorised the raising of £50,000 for the purpose of constructing a branch along the route of the River Hebble, from Salterhebble to the centre of Halifax, terminating near the railway station at Bailey Hall. The terminus was above the level of the canal at Salterhebble, and the branch required a total of fourteen locks. In order to avoid disputes with the mill owners along the length of the River Hebble, water supply was obtained by building a tunnel from the basin at Salterhebble to a pit near the top lock. The tunnel was long, and the water was pumped from the pit to the top pound by a steam engine. The branch was opened in 1828, at a cost of £58,741, of which £20,000 was raised by loans, rather than calls to the shareholders, and was abandoned in 1942.

In later improvements, ever-longer cuts bypassed more and more sections of river. The mill owners prevented some of the more ambitious plans, but in many cases, the navigation company bought out the mills in order to remove the obstacles. With the Aire and Calder Canal rebuilding its main line, the Calder and Hebble sought an act of Parliament to effectively abandon the river, but this was modified, as the needs of mill owners and others who owned property on the river banks were recognised. Nevertheless, the , when it was passed in 1834, authorised the construction of major new cuts and the building of new locks, which would be as far at Brighouse. The Huddersfield Canal pressed for the remaining locks to be extended to a similar length. A new cut between broad cut and the Figure of Three locks, which included two large locks, and a new large lock beside the old one at Thornes were opened in 1838, but little more was done, despite the Rochdale Canal pressing for longer locks.

===Competition===
The Manchester and Leeds Railway company, which had approached the Calder and Hebble in 1836, but had been rebuffed, opened their line between 1839 and 1841. It followed the line of the canal and that of the Rochdale Canal. A year later, with canal shares having lost 66 per cent of their value, the canal company approached the railway, who agreed to lease the canal for £40,000 per year for 14 years, commencing on 25 March 1843. The Aire and Calder Navigation objected to the lease, and in April 1847, the Attorney General and the Solicitor General ruled that it was illegal, and must cease. Soon afterwards, the Aire and Calder offered to lease the canal itself, and the agreement started in September. After the Aire and Calder&#x27;s lease expired in 1885, the navigation company again took charge, rebuilt many of the bridges, and established the Calder Carrying Company. Shareholders continued to receive dividends until the canal was nationalised in 1948, and the canal was used by commercial traffic until 1981.

==Current route==
The Navigation starts in Wakefield, where there is an end-on junction with the Aire and Calder Navigation, and runs upstream through Mirfield, after which there is a junction with the Huddersfield Broad Canal, to arrive at Sowerby Bridge, where there is another end-on junction, this time with the Rochdale Canal. Other towns on the navigation are Horbury, Dewsbury, Brighouse, and Elland. The former branch to Halifax is no longer navigable, except for a stub now known as the Halifax Arm. A sign clearly signposts the Halifax Arm to the right, and onwards toward Sowerby Bridge, visible to boats emerging from the top lock.

==Current use==
Since the demise of commercial carrying in 1981, the navigation has only been used by leisure boaters, to whom it represents both an attractive cruising ground, passing through beautiful countryside and traditional Yorkshire industrial areas. For many years it was effectively a cul-de-sac, with the only access from the Aire and Calder Navigation at the eastern end. However, the growth of the restoration movement resulted in the reopening of the Rochdale Canal, to which connection was made in 1996 with the opening of Tuel Lane Lock, just beyond Sowerby Bridge, and it is now possible to reach Rochdale and Manchester. The canal always provided access to the Huddersfield Broad Canal at Cooper Bridge Junction, but this was another short cul-de-sac, until it was reconnected to the trans-Pennine Huddersfield Narrow Canal, restoration of which was completed in 2001. This links the far end of the Broad canal to Ashton-under-Lyne, and onwards to the Midlands and Wales. From the eastern end, the Aire and Calder Navigation provides links to Lancashire via Leeds and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in the west, and to Selby, York, Goole and the Humber, Keadby and the River Trent, and Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster in the east. The reopening of the Rochdale and Huddersfield Narrow Canals mean that the navigation now forms part of three cruising rings, the South Pennine Ring, the North Pennine Ring and the Outer Pennine Ring.

The canal and the connected Huddersfield Broad Canal were built to accept Yorkshire Keels coming up the Aire and Calder Navigation. The first four locks on the lower Calder and Hebble, from Fall Ings to Broad Cut Top Lock have since been extended, and can accommodate boats which are , but the remainder restrict the size of boats that can use the navigation. They are among the shortest on the connected network of English and Welsh inland waterways, but while wide beam boats are restricted to in length, it is possible for experienced boaters to fit narrowboats up to about long, but only wide, into the locks, by allowing them to sit diagonally in the restricted space. This may require expedients such as removing fenders, having shore parties pole the boat into position, and going down locks backwards. In particular, an inexperienced crew of any boat longer than about might find it impossible to negotiate the middle lock of the &quot;Salterhebble Three&quot;, which is the shortest of all.

It was the disparity in boat sizes between the Calder and Hebble and the Rochdale canal which made Sowerby Bridge, at the junction of the two canals, so important, as long boats coming over from Lancashire had to have their cargoes unloaded, stored, and transferred to shorter boats at Sowerby Bridge Wharf.

A quirk of the Calder and Hebble locks is the handspike, a length of timber shaped at one end to provide a comfortable two-handed grip. Calder and Hebble boaters have to carry these in addition to the more usual windlass, in order to lever open the simple lock gear which lifts the lock paddles to allow a full lock to empty or an empty one to fill. Because the navigation includes river sections, locks which give access to such sections are fitted with gauge boards, which show the condition of the river using a colour-coded scheme. A green band indicates that river levels are normal, and that navigation is therefore safe. An amber band indicates that levels are higher than normal, and that extra care is required when proceeding along the river section. A red band indicates that water levels are sufficiently high that the lock has been closed, and navigation on the river is unsafe.

<text>Alexander Bengt Magnus Bard (born 17 March 1961) is a Swedish musician, author, lecturer, artist, songwriter, music producer, TV personality, religious and political activist, and one of the founders of the Syntheist religious movement alongside his co-author Jan Söderqvist. Bard is a member of music band Army of Lovers.

== Background and education ==
Bard was born in Medevi, Motala Municipality, Sweden on 17 March 1961. After he completed his upper secondary education, Bard studied in the United States and in Amsterdam, Netherlands. While living in Amsterdam, he earned part of his living as a sex worker. Bard returned to Sweden to study at the Stockholm School of Economics from 1984 to 1989. In addition to his studies in economics, he took a strong interest in philosophy and social theory with the explicit aim of becoming a philosophy writer and lecturer.

== Musical career ==

Bard began his musical career in 1982 with the single &quot;Life in a Goldfish Bowl&quot; released under the name Baard, a synth-punk fusion project he had formed together with two female striptease dancers. He later had some minor success as Barbie, which saw Bard performing ironic bubblegum pop songs crossdressed.

After abandoning work on a second Barbie album, Bard formed Army of Lovers with two of Barbie&#x27;s entourage, Jean-Pierre Barda and La Camilla. Army of Lovers had
several pan-European hits, the biggest being &quot;Crucified&quot; and &quot;Obsession&quot;, while their presence in the US and the UK was limited to repeated club chart successes. They released five studio albums, made over twenty music videos, and became phenomenally successful across Eastern Europe, before Bard disbanded the group in 1996. Army of Lovers have later earned a widespread iconic status in the gay culture, often referred to as a perfect example of the postmodern take on the ideals of camp. Bard said, “I&#x27;m gay. I always fall back on camp or gay as a frame of reference. Then camp doesn&#x27;t always have to be gay and gay doesn&#x27;t always have to be camp.” Bard also worked on the production &amp; composition of Swedish girlgroup Midi, Maxi &amp; Efti.

Following the demise of Army of Lovers, Bard founded Vacuum, a symphonic synthpop project featuring Bard, Marina Schiptjenko (formerly of synthpop group Page), and newcomer Mattias Lindblom. Their debut single &quot;I Breathe&quot; was one of the fastest selling singles in Sweden in 1997 and also topped the singles chart in Italy. Further releases did not do as well, except in Russia and Ukraine, and Bard left after only two albums. He reformed Army of Lovers briefly in 2000 for a handful of new tracks and a greatest hits collection, and later co-wrote and co-produced the first two Alcazar albums.

In 2005, Bard launched a new music project called BWO (short for Bodies Without Organs), together with Marina Schiptjenko and new vocalist Martin Rolinski. Their debut album &quot;Prototype&quot; generated seven top 20 hit singles in Scandinavia and across Eastern Europe and reached platinum status. A second album &quot;Halcyon Days&quot;, was released in April 2006, which shipped gold and generated four additional hit singles. 2007 saw the release of a third album, &quot;Fabricator&quot;, followed by a 2008 compilation album and the 2009 release of a fourth studio album, &quot;Big Science&quot;.

In April 2010, Bard announced that he was working with co-producer Henrik Wikström on a new project called Gravitonas, signed to Universal Music worldwide. The project, described as electro-rock, and fronted by Bard himself and vocalist Andreas Öhrn, released a first digital EP in May 2010 and had its first charts hits in Sweden and Russia in the autumn of 2010. Since they refuse to release physical records tied to traditional promotional media campaigns and instead strictly release their music through streaming and downloads and in EP rather than album format, Gravitonas have been dubbed &quot;The World&#x27;s First Spotify Band&quot; by bloggers and the music press. Bard&#x27;s public friendship with Spotify founder Daniel Ek has played into this narrative. In addition to several No. 1 hit records across the European continent, Gravitonas have also achieved a considerable following as dance act in the U.S., with three hit records to date in the Billboard Top 50 Club Play Chart.

Aside from the groups mentioned above, Alexander Bard has also worked as a songwriter and producer for several Swedish artists, in the 1980s mainly with Ola Håkansson and Tim Norell, in the early 1990s with Anders Wollbeck and Per Adebratt—especially on the early 1990s Columbia Records—signed African cult act Midi Maxi &amp; Efti—and more recently mainly with Anders Hansson and Henrik Wikström.

Bard was a co-founder of Stockholm Records and runs several internet and music-related businesses. In August 2011, Bard joined the jury of the Swedish version of the Idol TV show, sharing the stage with Celine Dion&#x27;s record producer Anders Bagge, quickly being referred to as &quot;The Scandinavian Simon Cowell&quot; due to his famously and characteristically harsh and straightforward commenting of the contestants.

Army of Lovers reunited in 2013, releasing a new compilation album titled &quot;Big Battle of Egos&quot; featuring four brand new tracks including lead single and video &quot;Signed on My Tattoo&quot;, a duet with Gravitonas. The band cited political reasons, including their outspoken opposition to increased homophobia and antisemitism in Europe, for the reunification, after which they headlined both the Pride festivities of 2013 in Copenhagen and Belgrade and several major TV shows in Sweden, Poland, Russia and Ukraine.

== Television career ==
Bard was a judge on the television show &quot;Swedish Idol&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, between 2011 and 2015, and was a judge on &quot;Talang&quot;, the Swedish version of &quot;Got Talent&quot;, which is broadcast on TV4, from 2017. In June 2020, he was fired from that job following public backlash regarding a series of racially charged tweets from Bard.

== Literature and lecturing ==
Bard has written three books on the Internet revolution, collectively known as &quot;The Futurica Trilogy&quot;, together with media theorist Jan Söderqvist. Their first collaboration &quot;The Netocrats&quot; was originally released in Swedish in 2000, became available in English in 2003, and has since been translated to a further 16 languages with total worldwide sales exceeding 340,000 copies. The book presents a reading of history as the progression of different information technological paradigms, each with a dominant information technology and corresponding elite power triad. Where the printing press era created the power triad of academics, politicians and capitalists, the internet era will create a new power triad, known collectively as the Netocracy.

The second book &quot;The Global Empire&quot; was originally released in Swedish in 2003, while the third installment of the trilogy &quot;The Body Machines&quot; was originally published in Swedish in 2009. These latter two works were released in English in 2012, completing &quot;The Futurica Trilogy&quot;, in which the authors present their philosophical vision for a global and increasingly virtual society, as a consequence of the Internet revolution.

A fourth book from Bard &amp; Söderqvist, &quot;Syntheism – Creating God in The Internet Age&quot;, was released in October 2014. The book focuses on participatory culture as the spirituality of the digital age and advocates a radical relationalism inspired by philosopher Alfred North Whitehead and physicist Niels Bohr as the antidote to the individualism of the collapsing capitalist age. It was followed by a fifth book called &quot;Digital Libido – Sex, Power and Violence in The Network Society&quot;, a Freudian and Nietzschean critique of the infantilization and existential crisis of contemporary society, in 2018 when Bard and Söderqvist also announced a larger plan where the &quot;Syntheism&quot; and &quot;Digital Libido&quot; books merely form the first and second installments of a planned second trilogy from the authors on the metaphysics of the internet age, tentatively titled &quot;Grand Narrative Trilogy&quot;. The working title of the third and final book in the trilogy is &quot;Process and Event,&quot; which proposes to explore the metaphysics and implications of cyclical time (nomadology) and linear time (eventology).

Bard has given public lectures since 1997, including three TEDx presentations (as of 2013), with a major focus on the social implications of the Internet revolution and has become one of the leading speakers on the international management theory lecturing circuit.

== Politics ==
Alexander Bard has for long been a vocal opponent of laws against personal drug consumption and laws against prostitution in Sweden. Having earlier been a member of — or worked closely with members of — the Liberals, the Center party and the Pirate Party, he joined the newly founded Citizens&#x27; Coalition in 2018. He departed that party in December 2019, following disagreements about both party goals and how to best achieve them. He later rejoined the Liberals. Following a conversation between the Liberals and Bard regarding several racially charged tweets made by Bard in June 2020, the Liberals announced his departure from the party once again. Bard rejoined the Citizens’ Coalition. As of 2023 he considers himself to be a far-right Marxist, having earlier considered himself to be a Libertarian Marxist.

== Personal life ==
Bard converted to the Iranian original branch of Zoroastrianism in 1992 after years of intense religious studies. He explains his decision to convert in his book &quot;Syntheism – Creating God in The Internet Age&quot; with Jan Söderqvist by stating that without a solid foundation in philosophical and theological history, the idea of Syntheism as a set of new religious ideas for a globalized and digitalized world in the 21st century, would not carry its necessary weight. The conversion could also be understood when Bard and Söderqvist place Zoroastrianism next to Taoism and Buddhism in their work in what they refer to as &quot;The Silk Route Triad&quot;, as the historical peak of religious thought and practice.

Bard describes himself as a bisexual man.

<text>In science, work is the energy transferred to or from an object via the application of force along a displacement. In its simplest form, for a constant force aligned with the direction of motion, the work equals the product of the force strength and the distance traveled. A force is said to do &quot;positive work&quot; if it has a component in the direction of the displacement of the point of application. A force does &quot;negative work&quot; if it has a component opposite to the direction of the displacement at the point of application of the force.

For example, when a ball is held above the ground and then dropped, the work done by the gravitational force on the ball as it falls is positive, and is equal to the weight of the ball (a force) multiplied by the distance to the ground (a displacement). If the ball is thrown upwards, the work done by the gravitational force is negative, and is equal to the weight multiplied by the displacement in the upwards direction.

Both force and displacement are vectors. The work done is given by the dot product of the two vectors, where the result is a scalar. When the force is constant and the angle between the force and the displacement is also constant, then the work done is given by:
formula_1

If the force is variable, then work is given by the line integral:

formula_2

where formula_3 is the tiny change in displacement vector.

Work is a scalar quantity, so it has only magnitude and no direction. Work transfers energy from one place to another, or one form to another. The SI unit of work is the joule (J), the same unit as for energy.

==History==

The ancient Greek understanding of physics was limited to the statics of simple machines (the balance of forces), and did not include dynamics or the concept of work. During the Renaissance the dynamics of the &quot;Mechanical Powers&quot;, as the simple machines were called, began to be studied from the standpoint of how far they could lift a load, in addition to the force they could apply, leading eventually to the new concept of mechanical work. The complete dynamic theory of simple machines was worked out by Italian scientist Galileo Galilei in 1600 in &quot;Le Meccaniche&quot; (&quot;On Mechanics&quot;), in which he showed the underlying mathematical similarity of the machines as force amplifiers. He was the first to explain that simple machines do not create energy, only transform it.

=== Early concepts of work ===
Although &quot;work&quot; was not formally used until 1826, similar concepts existed before then. Early names for the same concept included &quot;moment of activity, quantity of action, latent live force, dynamic effect, efficiency&quot;, and even &quot;force&quot;. In 1637, the French philosopher René Descartes wrote: 

In 1686, the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz wrote: 

In 1759, John Smeaton described a quantity that he called &quot;power&quot; &quot;to signify the exertion of strength, gravitation, impulse, or pressure, as to produce motion.&quot; Smeaton continues that this quantity can be calculated if &quot;the weight raised is multiplied by the height to which it can be raised in a given time,&quot; making this definition remarkably similar to Coriolis&#x27;s.

===Etymology and modern usage===
The term &quot;work&quot; (or &quot;mechanical work&quot;), and the use of the work-energy principle in mechanics, was introduced in the late 1820s independently by French mathematician Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis and French Professor of Applied Mechanics Jean-Victor Poncelet. Both scientists were pursuing a view of mechanics suitable for studying the dynamics and power of machines, for example steam engines lifting buckets of water out of flooded ore mines. According to Rene Dugas, French engineer and historian, it is to Solomon of Caux &quot;that we owe the term &quot;work&quot; in the sense that it is used in mechanics now&quot;. The concept of virtual work, and the use of variational methods in mechanics, preceded the introduction of &quot;mechanical work&quot; but was originally called &quot;virtual moment&quot;. It was re-named once the terminology of Poncelet and Coriolis was adopted.

==Units==
The SI unit of work is the joule (J), named after English physicist James Prescott Joule (1818-1889), which is defined as the work required to exert a force of one newton through a displacement of one metre.

The dimensionally equivalent newton-metre (N⋅m) is sometimes used as the measuring unit for work, but this can be confused with the measurement unit of torque. Usage of N⋅m is discouraged by the SI authority, since it can lead to confusion as to whether the quantity expressed in newton-metres is a torque measurement, or a measurement of work.

Another unit for work is the foot-pound, which comes from the English system of measurement. As the unit name suggests, it is the product of pounds for the unit of force and feet for the unit of displacement. One joule is approximately equal to 0.7376 ft-lbs.

Non-SI units of work include the newton-metre, erg, the foot-pound, the foot-poundal, the kilowatt hour, the litre-atmosphere, and the horsepower-hour. Due to work having the same physical dimension as heat, occasionally measurement units typically reserved for heat or energy content, such as therm, BTU and calorie, are used as a measuring unit.

==Work and energy==
The work done by a constant force of magnitude on a point that moves a displacement in a straight line in the direction of the force is the product
formula_4

For example, if a force of 10 newtons () acts along a point that travels 2 metres (), then . This is approximately the work done lifting a 1 kg object from ground level to over a person&#x27;s head against the force of gravity.

The work is doubled either by lifting twice the weight the same distance or by lifting the same weight twice the distance.

Work is closely related to energy. Energy shares the same unit of measurement with work (Joules) because the energy from the object doing work is transferred to the other objects it interacts with when work is being done. The work–energy principle states that an increase in the kinetic energy of a rigid body is caused by an equal amount of positive work done on the body by the resultant force acting on that body. Conversely, a decrease in kinetic energy is caused by an equal amount of negative work done by the resultant force. Thus, if the net work is positive, then the particle&#x27;s kinetic energy increases by the amount of the work. If the net work done is negative, then the particle&#x27;s kinetic energy decreases by the amount of work.

From Newton&#x27;s second law, it can be shown that work on a free (no fields), rigid (no internal degrees of freedom) body, is equal to the change in kinetic energy corresponding to the linear velocity and angular velocity of that body,
formula_5
The work of forces generated by a potential function is known as potential energy and the forces are said to be conservative. Therefore, work on an object that is merely displaced in a conservative force field, without change in velocity or rotation, is equal to &quot;minus&quot; the change of potential energy of the object,
formula_6
These formulas show that work is the energy associated with the action of a force, so work subsequently possesses the physical dimensions, and units, of energy.
The work/energy principles discussed here are identical to electric work/energy principles.

==Constraint forces==
Constraint forces determine the object&#x27;s displacement in the system, limiting it within a range. For example, in the case of a slope plus gravity, the object is &quot;stuck to&quot; the slope and, when attached to a taut string, it cannot move in an outwards direction to make the string any &#x27;tauter&#x27;. It eliminates all displacements in that direction, that is, the velocity in the direction of the constraint is limited to 0, so that the constraint forces do not perform work on the system.

For a mechanical system, constraint forces eliminate movement in directions that characterize the constraint. Thus the virtual work done by the forces of constraint is zero, a result which is only true if friction forces are excluded.

Fixed, frictionless constraint forces do not perform work on the system, as the angle between the motion and the constraint forces is always 90°. Examples of workless constraints are: rigid interconnections between particles, sliding motion on a frictionless surface, and rolling contact without slipping.

For example, in a pulley system like the Atwood machine, the internal forces on the rope and at the supporting pulley do no work on the system. Therefore, work need only be computed for the gravitational forces acting on the bodies. Another example is the centripetal force exerted &quot;inwards&quot; by a string on a ball in uniform circular motion &quot;sideways&quot; constrains the ball to circular motion restricting its movement away from the centre of the circle. This force does zero work because it is perpendicular to the velocity of the ball.

The magnetic force on a charged particle is , where is the charge, is the velocity of the particle, and is the magnetic field. The result of a cross product is always perpendicular to both of the original vectors, so . The dot product of two perpendicular vectors is always zero, so the work , and the magnetic force does not do work. It can change the direction of motion but never change the speed.

==Mathematical calculation==
For moving objects, the quantity of work/time (power) is integrated along the trajectory of the point of application of the force. Thus, at any instant, the rate of the work done by a force (measured in joules/second, or watts) is the scalar product of the force (a vector), and the velocity vector of the point of application. This scalar product of force and velocity is known as instantaneous power. Just as velocities may be integrated over time to obtain a total distance, by the fundamental theorem of calculus, the total work along a path is similarly the time-integral of instantaneous power applied along the trajectory of the point of application.

Work is the result of a force on a point that follows a curve , with a velocity , at each instant. The small amount of work that occurs over an instant of time is calculated as
formula_7
where the is the power over the instant . The sum of these small amounts of work over the trajectory of the point yields the work,
formula_8
where &quot;C&quot; is the trajectory from x(&quot;t&quot;1) to x(&quot;t&quot;2). This integral is computed along the trajectory of the particle, and is therefore said to be &quot;path dependent&quot;.

If the force is always directed along this line, and the magnitude of the force is , then this integral simplifies to
formula_9
where is displacement along the line. If is constant, in addition to being directed along the line, then the integral simplifies further to
formula_10
where &quot;s&quot; is the displacement of the point along the line.

This calculation can be generalized for a constant force that is not directed along the line, followed by the particle. In this case the dot product , where is the angle between the force vector and the direction of movement, that is
formula_11

When a force component is perpendicular to the displacement of the object (such as when a body moves in a circular path under a central force), no work is done, since the cosine of 90° is zero. Thus, no work can be performed by gravity on a planet with a circular orbit (this is ideal, as all orbits are slightly elliptical). Also, no work is done on a body moving circularly at a constant speed while constrained by mechanical force, such as moving at constant speed in a frictionless ideal centrifuge.

=== Work done by a variable force ===

Calculating the work as &quot;force times straight path segment&quot; would only apply in the most simple of circumstances, as noted above. If force is changing, or if the body is moving along a curved path, possibly rotating and not necessarily rigid, then only the path of the application point of the force is relevant for the work done, and only the component of the force parallel to the application point velocity is doing work (positive work when in the same direction, and negative when in the opposite direction of the velocity). This component of force can be described by the scalar quantity called &quot;scalar tangential component&quot; (, where is the angle between the force and the velocity). And then the most general definition of work can be formulated as follows:

Thus, the work done for a variable force can be expressed as a definite integral of force over displacement.

If the displacement as a variable of time is given by , then work done by the variable force from to is:
:formula_12

Thus, the work done for a variable force can be expressed as a definite integral of power over time.

===Torque and rotation===
A force couple results from equal and opposite forces, acting on two different points of a rigid body. The sum (resultant) of these forces may cancel, but their effect on the body is the couple or torque T. The work of the torque is calculated as
formula_13
where the is the power over the instant . The sum of these small amounts of work over the trajectory of the rigid body yields the work,
formula_14
This integral is computed along the trajectory of the rigid body with an angular velocity that varies with time, and is therefore said to be &quot;path dependent&quot;.

If the angular velocity vector maintains a constant direction, then it takes the form,
formula_15
where formula_16 is the angle of rotation about the constant unit vector . In this case, the work of the torque becomes,
formula_17
where is the trajectory from formula_18 to formula_19. This integral depends on the rotational trajectory formula_20, and is therefore path-dependent.

If the torque formula_21 is aligned with the angular velocity vector so that,
formula_22
and both the torque and angular velocity are constant, then the work takes the form,
formula_23
This result can be understood more simply by considering the torque as arising from a force of constant magnitude , being applied perpendicularly to a lever arm at a distance formula_24, as shown in the figure. This force will act through the distance along the circular arc formula_25, so the work done is
formula_26
Introduce the torque , to obtain
formula_27
as presented above.

Notice that only the component of torque in the direction of the angular velocity vector contributes to the work.

==Work and potential energy==
The scalar product of a force and the velocity of its point of application defines the power input to a system at an instant of time. Integration of this power over the trajectory of the point of application, , defines the work input to the system by the force.

===Path dependence===
Therefore, the work done by a force on an object that travels along a curve is given by the line integral:
formula_28
where defines the trajectory and is the velocity along this trajectory.
In general this integral requires that the path along which the velocity is defined, so the evaluation of work is said to be path dependent.

The time derivative of the integral for work yields the instantaneous power,
formula_29

===Path independence===
If the work for an applied force is independent of the path, then the work done by the force, by the gradient theorem, defines a potential function which is evaluated at the start and end of the trajectory of the point of application. This means that there is a potential function , that can be evaluated at the two points and to obtain the work over any trajectory between these two points. It is tradition to define this function with a negative sign so that positive work is a reduction in the potential, that is
formula_30

The function is called the potential energy associated with the applied force. The force derived from such a potential function is said to be conservative. Examples of forces that have potential energies are gravity and spring forces.

In this case, the gradient of work yields
formula_31
and the force F is said to be &quot;derivable from a potential.&quot;

Because the potential defines a force at every point in space, the set of forces is called a force field. The power applied to a body by a force field is obtained from the gradient of the work, or potential, in the direction of the velocity of the body, that is
formula_32

===Work by gravity===

In the absence of other forces, gravity results in a constant downward acceleration of every freely moving object. Near Earth&#x27;s surface the acceleration due to gravity is and the gravitational force on an object of mass &quot;m&quot; is . It is convenient to imagine this gravitational force concentrated at the center of mass of the object.

If an object with weight is displaced upwards or downwards a vertical distance , the work done on the object is:
formula_33
where &quot;Fg&quot; is weight (pounds in imperial units, and newtons in SI units), and Δ&quot;y&quot; is the change in height &quot;y&quot;. Notice that the work done by gravity depends only on the vertical movement of the object. The presence of friction does not affect the work done on the object by its weight.

====Gravity in 3D space====
The force of gravity exerted by a mass on another mass is given by
formula_34
where is the position vector from to and is the unit vector in the direction of .

Let the mass move at the velocity ; then the work of gravity on this mass as it moves from position to is given by
formula_35
Notice that the position and velocity of the mass are given by
formula_36
where and are the radial and tangential unit vectors directed relative to the vector from to , and we use the fact that formula_37 Use this to simplify the formula for work of gravity to,
formula_38
This calculation uses the fact that
formula_39
The function
formula_40
is the gravitational potential function, also known as gravitational potential energy. The negative sign follows the convention that work is gained from a loss of potential energy.

===Work by a spring===
Consider a spring that exerts a horizontal force that is proportional to its deflection in the &quot;x&quot; direction independent of how a body moves. The work of this spring on a body moving along the space with the curve , is calculated using its velocity, , to obtain
formula_41
For convenience, consider contact with the spring occurs at , then the integral of the product of the distance and the x-velocity, , over time is . The work is the product of the distance times the spring force, which is also dependent on distance; hence the result.

===Work by a gas===
The work formula_42 done by a body of gas on its surroundings is:
formula_43
where is pressure, is volume, and and are initial and final volumes.

==Work–energy principle==
The principle of work and kinetic energy (also known as the work–energy principle) states that &quot;the work done by all forces acting on a particle (the work of the resultant force) equals the change in the kinetic energy of the particle.&quot; That is, the work &quot;W&quot; done by the resultant force on a particle equals the change in the particle&#x27;s kinetic energy formula_44,
formula_45
where formula_46 and formula_47 are the speeds of the particle before and after the work is done, and is its mass.

The derivation of the &quot;work–energy principle&quot; begins with Newton&#x27;s second law of motion and the resultant force on a particle. Computation of the scalar product of the force with the velocity of the particle evaluates the instantaneous power added to the system.
(Constraints define the direction of movement of the particle by ensuring there is no component of velocity in the direction of the constraint force. This also means the constraint forces do not add to the instantaneous power.) The time integral of this scalar equation yields work from the instantaneous power, and kinetic energy from the scalar product of acceleration with velocity. The fact that the work–energy principle eliminates the constraint forces underlies Lagrangian mechanics.

This section focuses on the work–energy principle as it applies to particle dynamics. In more general systems work can change the potential energy of a mechanical device, the thermal energy in a thermal system, or the electrical energy in an electrical device. Work transfers energy from one place to another or one form to another.

===Derivation for a particle moving along a straight line===
In the case the resultant force is constant in both magnitude and direction, and parallel to the velocity of the particle, the particle is moving with constant acceleration &quot;a&quot; along a straight line. The relation between the net force and the acceleration is given by the equation (Newton&#x27;s second law), and the particle displacement can be expressed by the equation
formula_48
which follows from formula_49 (see Equations of motion).

The work of the net force is calculated as the product of its magnitude and the particle displacement. Substituting the above equations, one obtains:
formula_50

Other derivation:
formula_51

In the general case of rectilinear motion, when the net force is not constant in magnitude, but is constant in direction, and parallel to the velocity of the particle, the work must be integrated along the path of the particle:
formula_52

===General derivation of the work–energy principle for a particle===
For any net force acting on a particle moving along any curvilinear path, it can be demonstrated that its work equals the change in the kinetic energy of the particle by a simple derivation analogous to the equation above. It is known as the work–energy principle:
formula_53

The identity formula_54 requires some algebra.
From the identity formula_55 and definition formula_56
it follows
formula_57

The remaining part of the above derivation is just simple calculus, same as in the preceding rectilinear case.

===Derivation for a particle in constrained movement===
In particle dynamics, a formula equating work applied to a system to its change in kinetic energy is obtained as a first integral of Newton&#x27;s second law of motion. It is useful to notice that the resultant force used in Newton&#x27;s laws can be separated into forces that are applied to the particle and forces imposed by constraints on the movement of the particle. Remarkably, the work of a constraint force is zero, therefore only the work of the applied forces need be considered in the work–energy principle.

To see this, consider a particle P that follows the trajectory with a force acting on it. Isolate the particle from its environment to expose constraint forces , then Newton&#x27;s Law takes the form
formula_58
where is the mass of the particle.

====Vector formulation====
Note that n dots above a vector indicates its nth time derivative.
The scalar product of each side of Newton&#x27;s law with the velocity vector yields
formula_59
because the constraint forces are perpendicular to the particle velocity. Integrate this equation along its trajectory from the point to the point to obtain
formula_60

The left side of this equation is the work of the applied force as it acts on the particle along the trajectory from time to time . This can also be written as
formula_61
This integral is computed along the trajectory of the particle and is therefore path dependent.

The right side of the first integral of Newton&#x27;s equations can be simplified using the following identity
formula_62
(see product rule for derivation). Now it is integrated explicitly to obtain the change in kinetic energy,
formula_63
where the kinetic energy of the particle is defined by the scalar quantity,
formula_64

====Tangential and normal components====
It is useful to resolve the velocity and acceleration vectors into tangential and normal components along the trajectory , such that
formula_65
where
formula_66
Then, the scalar product of velocity with acceleration in Newton&#x27;s second law takes the form
formula_67
where the kinetic energy of the particle is defined by the scalar quantity,
formula_68

The result is the work–energy principle for particle dynamics,
formula_69
This derivation can be generalized to arbitrary rigid body systems.

===Moving in a straight line (skid to a stop)===
Consider the case of a vehicle moving along a straight horizontal trajectory under the action of a driving force and gravity that sum to . The constraint forces between the vehicle and the road define , and we have
formula_70
For convenience let the trajectory be along the X-axis, so and the velocity is , then , and , where &quot;F&quot;x is the component of F along the X-axis, so
formula_71
Integration of both sides yields
formula_72
If is constant along the trajectory, then the integral of velocity is distance, so
formula_73

As an example consider a car skidding to a stop, where &quot;k&quot; is the coefficient of friction and &quot;W&quot; is the weight of the car. Then the force along the trajectory is . The velocity &quot;v&quot; of the car can be determined from the length of the skid using the work–energy principle,
formula_74
This formula uses the fact that the mass of the vehicle is .


===Coasting down an inclined surface (gravity racing)===
Consider the case of a vehicle that starts at rest and coasts down an inclined surface (such as mountain road), the work–energy principle helps compute the minimum distance that the vehicle travels to reach a velocity , of say 60 mph (88 fps). Rolling resistance and air drag will slow the vehicle down so the actual distance will be greater than if these forces are neglected.

Let the trajectory of the vehicle following the road be which is a curve in three-dimensional space. The force acting on the vehicle that pushes it down the road is the constant force of gravity , while the force of the road on the vehicle is the constraint force . Newton&#x27;s second law yields,
formula_75
The scalar product of this equation with the velocity, , yields
formula_76
where is the magnitude of . The constraint forces between the vehicle and the road cancel from this equation because , which means they do no work.
Integrate both sides to obtain
formula_77
The weight force &quot;W&quot; is constant along the trajectory and the integral of the vertical velocity is the vertical distance, therefore,
formula_78
Recall that V(&quot;t&quot;1)=0. Notice that this result does not depend on the shape of the road followed by the vehicle.

In order to determine the distance along the road assume the downgrade is 6%, which is a steep road. This means the altitude decreases 6 feet for every 100 feet traveled—for angles this small the sin and tan functions are approximately equal. Therefore, the distance in feet down a 6% grade to reach the velocity is at least
formula_79
This formula uses the fact that the weight of the vehicle is .

==Work of forces acting on a rigid body==
The work of forces acting at various points on a single rigid body can be calculated from the work of a resultant force and torque. To see this, let the forces F1, F2, ..., Fn act on the points X1, X2, ..., X&quot;n&quot; in a rigid body.

The trajectories of X&quot;i&quot;, &quot;i&quot; = 1, ..., &quot;n&quot; are defined by the movement of the rigid body. This movement is given by the set of rotations [&quot;A&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)] and the trajectory d(&quot;t&quot;) of a reference point in the body. Let the coordinates x&quot;i&quot; &quot;i&quot; = 1, ..., &quot;n&quot; define these points in the moving rigid body&#x27;s reference frame &quot;M&quot;, so that the trajectories traced in the fixed frame &quot;F&quot; are given by
formula_80

The velocity of the points along their trajectories are
formula_81
where is the angular velocity vector obtained from the skew symmetric matrix
formula_82
known as the angular velocity matrix.

The small amount of work by the forces over the small displacements can be determined by approximating the displacement by so
formula_83
or
formula_84

This formula can be rewritten to obtain
formula_85
where F and T are the resultant force and torque applied at the reference point d of the moving frame &quot;M&quot; in the rigid body.

<text>Castleford is a town within the City of Wakefield district, West Yorkshire, England. It had a population of 45,106 at a 2021 population estimate. Historically in the West Riding of Yorkshire, to the north of the town centre the River Calder joins the River Aire and the Aire and Calder Navigation. It is located north east of Wakefield, north of Pontefract and south east of Leeds. Castleford is the largest town in the Wakefield district after Wakefield itself.

The town is the site of a Roman settlement. Within the historical Municipal Borough of Castleford are the suburbs of Airedale, Cutsyke, Ferry Fryston, Fryston Village, Glasshoughton, Half Acres, Hightown, Lock Lane, Townville, Wheldale and Whitwood.

Castleford is home to the rugby league Super League team Castleford Tigers.

==History==

Castleford&#x27;s history dates back to Roman times, archaeological evidence points to modern day Castleford being built upon a Roman army settlement which was called Lagentium (thought to mean &#x27;The Place of the Swordsmen&#x27;). Roman funeral urns have been found in modern-day Castleford, giving further evidence to this theory. A Roman milestone was unearthed in Beancroft Road, now believed to be in Leeds City Museum.

Queen&#x27;s Park in Castleford provides evidence of Roundhouses used by the Anglo Saxons. This was a strategic area due to the views of the entire settlement. The history of the area includes Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s encampment in nearby Knottingley and Ferrybridge (originally thought to be in Castleford itself) whilst his forces laid siege to Pontefract Castle.

In the 19th century, Castleford became a boomtown with the population growing from 1,000 to 14,000 as collieries opened around the town; however, these collieries closed in the 20th century. Ferrybridge Power Station and Kellingley Colliery have also closed (in 2015 and 2016 respectively) and used to employ Castleford residents. The newer warehouses and distribution centres in Glasshoughton have brought in many new jobs to the area.

In 2008 &quot;Grand Designs&quot; presenter Kevin McCloud and Channel 4 led a community regeneration scheme to redevelop Castleford.

In February 2017 Castleford Swimming Pool closed. A new modern leisure facility including a swimming pool is proposed for nearby Pontefract Park.

Built in 1890 the underpass/bridge made by Deborah Saunt called the Tickle Cock Bridge was established and was refurbished in 2003 and was closed around Christmas 2005, but was completed in 2008. Also known by its original name The Tittle Cot bridge but was later changed To Tickle Cock and still has a controversial stance.

==Economy==

Burberry, the retailer and designer label, has a factory in the town, plans were proposed to close this once a new facility was built in Leeds. However these plans were put on hold in 2016 and the factory is due to remain in the town for the foreseeable future. A large Nestlé factory, which produced Toffee Crisp and After Eights for 40 years, closed in 2012 and demolition starting in 2014 to make way for housing. Castleford has previously been home to Dunsford and Wesley Textiles, which at peak business times had three factories in Castleford which have all since ceased production. TEVA also have their UK headquarters here. 

Castleford had potteries from the early 18th century until 1961, notably the Castleford Pottery (1790–1820) of David Dunderdale, which gave its name to &quot;Castleford-type&quot; stonewares.

==Governance==

Castleford was established as an urban district, in the administrative county of the West Riding of Yorkshire in 1894 under the Local Government Act 1894, with an urban district council. Whitwood and Glasshoughton were added to the district in the 1930s. The urban district was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1955. Castleford Civic Centre was completed in 1970.

Following the Local Government Act 1972, the Municipal Borough of Castleford was abolished on 1 April 1974; it then became an unparished area of the City of Wakefield, a metropolitan borough in West Yorkshire. Castleford is now controlled by Wakefield Council. Three electoral wards cover the town: Airedale and Ferry Fryston; Altofts and Whitwood; and Castleford Central and Glasshoughton.
==Amenities and entertainment==
The town contains the &quot;Junction 32&quot; multi-store outlet shopping village and the &quot;Xscape&quot; leisure complex, both in the Glasshoughton suburb at the south of the town. Within Xscape is the large &quot;Snozone&quot;, which used to have Britain&#x27;s largest indoor real snow slope; this was later edged out by &quot;Chillfactore&quot; in Manchester. It is also home to Frankie &amp; Benny&#x27;s and Nando&#x27;s restaurants. It is also home to a 14-screen &quot;Cineworld&quot;, which underwent a refit in 2018 and is now home to a 4DX screen and a Screen X. 

Castleford has an open and an indoor market, a shopping centre on Carlton Street and a retail park; in addition, Asda, Morrisons, Aldi and Co-operative supermarkets are located there.

In December 2013, the &quot;Castleford Forum Museum&quot;, a library and heritage museum, opened in a new building. The town&#x27;s library had been in temporary accommodation for two years, while the old site was redeveloped. The existing frontage was kept, while the building further back was demolished. A new three-floor building was then constructed.

The town centre has public houses, bars and social clubs, although the number of these has declined in recent years with leisure becoming focused on the &quot;Xscape&quot; complex. In 2000, three nightclubs were situated in the town centre; today, none remain.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Emley Moor TV transmitter. 

The town&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Radio Leeds on 92.4 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire on 106.8 FM, Heart Yorkshire on 106.2 FM, Capital Yorkshire on 105.1 FM and 5 Towns FM, a community online radio station serving the town and surrounding areas.

The local newspaper is a weekly called Pontefract and Castleford Express.

Stoneground Records is a local independent record label named after the Stoneground Flour Mills on the River Aire.

==Transport==
===Roads===
Castleford is only away from the M62 at Junction 32 via the A656 road. It has other A roads that criss-cross the town and provide access to Junction 31 on the same motorway.

===Waterways===
The rivers Aire and Calder have a confluence just north-west of the town and also feed the Aire and Calder Navigation. Whilst it is an industrial waterway, it also hosts tourism with moorings on the Castleford Cut of the Navigation.

===Railways===
Castleford railway station is situated on both the Hallam and Pontefract lines; these lines connect the town directly with Leeds, Barnsley, Goole, Pontefract and Sheffield. All trains arrive from the west and leave in that same direction. In January 2021, the station was completely revamped, providing a modern waiting facility, sheltered cycle parking and changes to the car park layout.

Train services used to travel eastwards to York, via Burton Salmon, but passenger workings ceased in 1970 with the section retained for freight workings only. Castleford also had a second service to Leeds that left the station eastwards and swung north onto the former Castleford–Garforth line, which saw 
services calling at Ledston and Kippax, before arriving in Garforth and continuing to Leeds. 
In December 2023, services were restored towards York, with Transpennine Express providing four round-trips daily, from Manchester Piccadilly to York via Huddersfield, Wakefield Kirkgate and Castleford.

The Glasshoughton area of the town is served by its own railway station, which is situated one stop beyond Castleford on the Pontefract line.

===Buses===
In 2016, a new £6 million bus station was opened adjacent to the railway station to allow an integrated travel site for the 12,000 people using the bus station per day.

Local services are provided primarily by Arriva Yorkshire, but also by Globe Holidays (Barnsley) and Ross Travel. Routes link Castleford with Leeds, Pontefract and Wakefield.

==Education==
The town&#x27;s primary schools for young children are Wheldon Infant School, Castleford Park Junior, Smawthorne Henry Moore, Townville Infant School, Airedale Juniors, Oyster Park Primary, Fairburn View Primary, Three Lane Ends Academy, Ackton Pastures, saint josephs castleford catholic primary and Half Acres.

Castleford&#x27;s secondary schools for children aged 11–16 are Castleford Academy and Airedale Academy. 

The town has a small further and higher education college on the Castleford Campus of Wakefield College in Glasshoughton.

==Sport==

===Rugby League===

Castleford has multiple rugby league teams. The local team, Castleford Tigers was formed in 1926, Castleford was one of the twelve founder members of Super League when the new league format was introduced in 1996. The &#x27;Tigers&#x27; nickname and logo were introduced in 1992 and the club&#x27;s honours include four Challenge Cup and one Super League Leaders Shield.

The club have been based at Wheldon Road since 1927. Castleford also has two other lower league rugby league teams, Castleford Lock Lane and Castleford Panthers. Both Lock Lane and the Panthers play in the fourth tier of British Rugby League, meanwhile Castleford Tigers have play in the top tier of British Rugby League. Castleford Tigers have played majority of their Rugby League in the top tier and have done since their promotion in 2008, to present day. 

Rugby league in the town was originally represented by Castleford, unrelated to Castleford RUFC, who did not participate in The schism in English rugby and still exist, nor were they predecessors of the current Castleford Tigers who were founded in 1926. The original Castleford rugby league club played in the Northern Union (Rugby Football League) from 1896–97 to 1905–06, and it had one player named Isaac Cole who won a cap for England in 1906 against Other Nationalities.
===Motorcycle sport===
From June 1979 to July 1980, Castleford had its own Speedway racing team, The Kings, based at the Castleford Whitwood Stadium. The circuit was 202 yards and the team never entered the league – only challenge matches were staged.

In the 1960s, motorcycle scrambling used to take place on the north side of the hill at Queens Park. This was often featured on the BBC&#x27;s Grandstand sports programme on Saturday afternoons and was commentated upon by Murray Walker.

===Football===
Glasshoughton Welfare play in the Northern Counties East League, Fryston Colliery Welfare were members of this league until they left in 1991 due to ground grading problems. In the 1920s Castleford Town played in the Midland League alongside clubs such as Doncaster Rovers, Chesterfield, Scunthorpe United, Halifax Town, Leeds United (for 1919–20 season only), Lincoln City and Mansfield Town. This league also contained the reserve sides of Sheffield Wednesday, Barnsley, Nottingham Forest, Grimsby Town and Hull City. In 1920 Castleford reached the 2nd round of the FA Cup, losing 2–3 at Bradford Park Avenue. Castleford played at Wheldon Road – when they shut down the ground was taken over by the rugby league team.


===Greyhound racing===
Castleford hosted two greyhound tracks both of which are no longer in existence. The first was in Whitwood and held racing from 1939 until 2001. The second track was the slightly larger 1,500 capacity Castleford Sports Stadium located east of Lock Lane sitting on the north bank of the River Aire.

<text>Dewsbury is a market town in the Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees in West Yorkshire, England. It lies on the River Calder and on an arm of the Calder and Hebble Navigation waterway. It is to the west of Wakefield, east of Huddersfield and south of Leeds. Historically a part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, after undergoing a period of major growth in the 19th century as a mill town, Dewsbury went through a period of decline. Dewsbury forms part of the Heavy Woollen District of which it is the largest town. The population of the built-up area was 63,722 at the 2021 Census.

==History==

===Toponymy===
The Domesday Book of 1086 records the name as &quot;Deusberie&quot;, &quot;Deusberia&quot;, &quot;Deusbereia&quot;, or &quot;Deubire&quot;, literally &quot;Dewi&#x27;s fort&quot;, Dewi being an old Welsh name (equivalent to David) and &quot;bury&quot; coming from the old English word &quot;burh&quot;, meaning fort.

Other, less supported, theories exist as to the name&#x27;s origin. For example, that it means &quot;dew hill&quot;, from Old English &quot;dēaw&quot; (genitive &quot;dēawes&quot;), &quot;dew&quot;, and &quot;beorg&quot;, &quot;hill&quot; (because Dewsbury is built on a hill). It has been suggested that &quot;dēaw&quot; refers to the town&#x27;s proximity to the water of the River Calder.

In the past other origins were proposed, such as &quot;God&#x27;s fort&quot;, from Welsh &quot;Duw&quot;, &quot;God&quot;. &quot;Antiquarians supposed the name, Dewsbury, to be derived from the original planter of the village, Dui or Dew, who … had fixed his abode and fortified his &quot;Bury&quot;. Another conjecture holds, that the original name is Dewsborough, or God&#x27;s Town&quot; (1837)

===Early history===
In Anglo-Saxon times, Dewsbury was a centre of considerable importance. The ecclesiastical parish of Dewsbury encompassed Huddersfield, Mirfield and Bradford. Ancient legend records that in 627 Paulinus, the Bishop of York, preached here on the banks of the River Calder. Numerous Anglian graves have been found in Dewsbury and Thornhill.

Dewsbury Minster lies near the River Calder, traditionally on the site where Paulinus preached. Some of the visible stonework in the nave is Saxon, and parts of the church also date to the 13th century. The tower houses &quot;Black Tom&quot;, a bell which is rung each Christmas Eve, one toll for each year since Christ&#x27;s birth, known as the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Knell&quot;, a tradition dating from the 15th century. The bell was given by Sir Thomas de Soothill, in penance for murdering a servant boy in a fit of rage. The tradition was commemorated on a Royal Mail postage stamp in 1986.

In the Domesday Book of 1086, Dewsbury was in Morley wapentake, but with a recorded population of only nine households it was a relatively small settlement at that time. The Agbrigg and Morley wapentakes were administratively combined into the Agbrigg and Morley wapentake in the 13th century. When they were separated for administrative purposes in the mid-19th century, Dewsbury parish had grown to straddle the border between both wapentakes, hence being mainly in the Lower Division of the Wapentake of Agbrigg.

Dewsbury market was established in the 14th century for local clothiers. Occurrences of the plague in 1593 and 1603 closed the market and it reopened in 1741.

Throughout the Middle Ages, Dewsbury retained a measure of importance in ecclesiastical terms, collecting tithes from as far away as Halifax in the mid-14th century. John Wesley visited the area five times in the mid-18th century, and the first Methodist Society was established in 1746. Centenary Chapel on Daisy Hill commemorates the centenary of this event, and the Methodist tradition remained strong in the town.

===Industrial Revolution===
In 1770, a short branch of the Calder and Hebble Navigation was completed, linking Dewsbury to the canal system giving access to Manchester and Hull. By the time of the Industrial Revolution, Dewsbury was a centre for the shoddy and mungo industries which recycled woollen items by mixing them with new wool and making heavy blankets and uniforms. The town benefited economically from the canal, its location at the heart of the Heavy Woollen District, and its proximity to coal mines. The railway arrived in 1848 when Dewsbury Wellington Road railway station on the London and North Western Railway opened. This is the only station which remains open. 

Other stations were Dewsbury Central on the Great Northern Railway which closed in 1964 and Dewsbury Market Place on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway which closed in 1930. A fourth goods-only railway station was built in the early 20th century at Savile Town by the Midland Railway. In 1985 a bypass road was built on the site of Central Station and its adjacent viaduct, and nothing remains of Market Place railway station. The 19th century saw a great increase in population, rising from 4,566 in 1801 to around 30,000 by 1890.

The town&#x27;s rapid expansion and commitment to industrialisation resulted in social instability. In the early 19th century, Dewsbury was a centre of Luddite opposition to mechanisation in which workers retaliated against the mill owners who installed textile machinery and smashed the machines which threatened their way of life. In the 1830s, Dewsbury was a centre of Chartist agitation. In August 1838, after a speech by Chartist leader Feargus O&#x27;Connor, a mob of between five and seven thousand people besieged the Dewsbury Poor Law Guardians in the town&#x27;s Royal Hotel. The mob was dispersed by troops. 

Trouble flared in 1840 when radical agitators seized control of the town, and troops were stationed to maintain order. This radical tradition left a legacy in the town&#x27;s political life: its first elected Member of Parliament (MP) in 1867 was John Simon, a Jewish lawyer from Jamaica and a Liberal. The tradition of firing the &quot;Ten o&#x27;Clock&quot; gun dates from 1815 and was a hangover from the Luddite problems. It was fired from Wormald and Walker&#x27;s Mill to reassure that all was well, and could be heard all over the area. Eventually the actual gun was replaced with a specially made firework, but the tradition was discontinued in 1983 with the closure of the mill. 

The mills were family businesses and continued manufacturing after the wool crisis in 1950–51, which saw Australian sheep farmers begin to charge higher prices. The recovery of the late 1960s was reversed by the 1973 oil crisis, and the textile industry in Dewsbury declined, with only bed manufacturing remaining a large scale employer.

===Recent history===
Massive immigration after the 1960s left a huge demographic impact on the town, which continues today. Asian British and Muslims now make up a third of the population, and the percentage is expected to grow in the coming years.

After 2005, following negative press reports, Dewsbury was labelled a troubled town and became &quot;the town that dare not speak its name&quot; after high-profile crimes brought it into the media spotlight. In June, a girl of 12 was charged with grievous bodily harm after attempting to hang a five-year-old boy from Chickenley. Mohammad Sidique Khan, ringleader of the group responsible for the 7 July 2005 London bombings, lived in Lees Holm, Dewsbury.

On 19 February 2008, Shannon Matthews, a nine-year-old girl from the Moorside Estate, was reported missing. After a 24-day hunt which attracted huge media and public attention nationally, she was found hidden in a flat in the Batley Carr area on 14 March 2008. Her mother Karen Matthews, along with Michael Donovan, the uncle of her stepfather Craig Meehan, were later found guilty of abduction and false imprisonment, as part of a plot to claim the reward money for her safe return by pretending to have solved her disappearance; both were jailed for eight years.

In October 2010, the Dewsbury Revival Centre opened, in the refurbished former St Mark&#x27;s Church on Halifax Road, the church attended by Wallace Hartley, bandmaster of the &quot;Titanic&quot;.

In July 2014, Kirklees Council enforced a media ban covering the visit of Princess Anne, who was due to deliver a speech on the importance of restorative justice. Kirklees Council later responded that the highly unusual media ban had been insisted upon by the Royal Household. Buckingham Palace, however, was mystified over the ban, with a Royal spokesman stating: &quot;This visit has been openly listed in the future engagements section on the Royal website for the last eight weeks. There are no restrictions on reporting on the event from the Royal Household.&quot;

==Governance==
Dewsbury was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1862. Its first mayor was Dr George Fearnley. The Reform Act of 1868 constituted Dewsbury a parliamentary borough, and Liberal candidate John Simon, serjeant-at-law, was returned as the borough&#x27;s first MP. The Victorian town hall standing in front of the old marketplace dates from 1886 to 1889. Dewsbury&#x27;s boundaries were expanded to include the urban districts of Ravensthorpe, Thornhill, and Soothill Nether, and part of Soothill Upper, in 1910, and in 1913 it was elevated to county borough status. &quot;Soothill Nether&quot; refers to the current east end of the town, although at that time Chickenley and Chidswell were hamlets, and Earlsheaton contained the bulk of the area&#x27;s population. 

In 1974, responsibility for local government passed to Kirklees Metropolitan Council, its headquarters being in Huddersfield. The population of Dewsbury has remained broadly static over the past century: the 1911 census recorded 53,351 people, and the 1971 census 51,326 people, making it the fourth-least populous county borough in England (after Canterbury, Burton upon Trent and Great Yarmouth).

The current Member of Parliament (MP) for Dewsbury and Batley is Iqbal Mohamed, who has represented the constituency since the 2024 general election. Mohamed was one of four independent candidates who won seats in heavily Muslim areas largely due to Labour&#x27;s stance on the war in Gaza.

==Geography==
Dewsbury is situated between Leeds and Bradford to the north, Huddersfield a similar distance to the south west, and Wakefield east. Its proximity to these major urban centres, the M1 and M62 motorways and its position on the Huddersfield Line, served by the TransPennine Express, have contributed to its growth.

Dewsbury is part of the West Yorkshire Urban Area, although its natural boundaries are not well-defined, with built up areas of the town running into Batley, Heckmondwike and Ossett.

Geologically, the town is situated on rocks of the Carboniferous Period, consisting of coal measures and gritstones. Quaternary Period rock, glacial deposits and gravels exist in the Calder Valley. Coal, sandstone and gravel have been exploited commercially. Average rainfall is 100 cm per annum.
The town is dominated by hills, notably Earlsheaton, Dewsbury Moor, Staincliffe and Thornhill. The town centre is between above sea level, rising to at Earlsheaton and Batley Carr, and at Grange Moor. The approach from Earlsheaton through the Wakefield Road cutting, constructed in 1830 , is dramatic with the view of the town centre in the Calder Valley opening up.

===Divisions and suburbs===
Dewsbury has a number of districts with different geographical and socio-economic patterns, they are, Chickenley, Crackenedge, Dewsbury Moor, Earlsheaton, Eastborough, Eightlands, Flatts, Ravensthorpe, Savile Town, Shaw Cross, Scout Hill, Thornhill Lees, Westborough, Westtown. Batley Carr, Hanging Heaton and Staincliffe have areas which lie in both Dewsbury and neighbouring Batley. Thornhill, Briestfield and Whitley Lower are part of Dewsbury unparished area. Thornhill was annexed in 1910.

==Demography and economy==

The Westtown area has the large and imposing Our Lady and St. Paulinus Roman Catholic Church and its school, once run by the nuns of the area. The Irish National Club also is home to Dewsbury Celtic amateur rugby league club.

The town has a large Muslim community. Savile Town and Ravensthorpe are populated mainly by Muslims of Indian and Pakistani origin. In recent years, there has also been an immigration of Iraqi Kurds and Hungarians into the town. Dewsbury has been accused of having a controversial Shariah arbitration court. Dewsbury Moor, Ravensthorpe and Chickenley are classed among the 10% most deprived areas in the UK. In contrast to some British towns and cities, the east side of the town is generally more affluent. The majority of houses in the town are in the cheapest band for council tax, for house prices are amongst the lowest in the country.

The local market once consisted of 400 stalls and was one of the busiest in Yorkshire and in years gone by drew large numbers of visitors to the town. Wednesdays and Saturdays are the normal market days with the popular flea market on Fridays. The town&#x27;s mills were located just south of the River Calder in the town centre. As the mills closed this area became a large brownfield site. However, many of the units have been reoccupied and the town&#x27;s largest employer, Carlton Cards, is based in this area.

=== Ethnic groups ===
As of 2021, Dewsbury&#x27;s population was enumerated at 63,722, and its ethnic makeup was 50.8% White, 44.4% Asian, 2.3% Mixed, 0.8% Black, and 1.4% Other.

=== Religions ===
As of the 2021 census, Dewsbury&#x27;s religious makeup was 46.4% Muslim, 28.9% Christian, 23.7% No Religion, and has small Hindu and Sikh communities.

==Transport==

Dewsbury bus station serves the town of Dewsbury. The bus station is managed and owned by West Yorkshire Metro. The bus station was rebuilt in 1994 with a main passenger concourse and 19 bus stands. The town is served on the railway network by Dewsbury railway station, with services operated by Northern Trains and TransPennine Express.

==Sport==

Dewsbury Rams, formerly Dewsbury R.L.F.C., play in rugby league&#x27;s Betfred League One. They are based at Crown Flatt, on Owl Lane, towards Ossett, on the site of the old Savile &amp; Shaw Cross Colliery. Shaw Cross Sharks is an amateur Rugby League club. The club was founded in 1947 and has produced several players into the professional game, including Mike Stephenson, Nigel Stephenson and David Ward. They operate from Shaw Cross Club for Young People and play their home fixtures at the adjacent Paul Lee Hinchcliffe Memorial Playing Fields. 

The open age first team is the National Conference League. Dewsbury Celtic play in National League 3; their ground is on the west side of the town, in Crow Nest Park. The club&#x27;s headquarters are at the Dewsbury Irish National Club on Park Parade. Dewsbury is also the home of Dewsbury Rangers Football Club. With over 300 members from the ages of six through to the old boys&#x27; teams, it is one of the largest in the area.

==Culture==

Dewsbury Museum was located within the mansion house in Crow Nest Park, before it closed to the public in November 2016. Nearby attractions include the National Coal Mining Museum for England, located in Overton, Wakefield.

Dewsbury Town Hall contains a 700-seater concert hall and regularly hosts concerts, exhibitions, live music, cabaret evenings and weddings.

The town also has an annual event called Spirit, a street theatre show every winter which takes place in the town centre.

2018 comedy film was filmed and part set in the town. The production was shot in 2016 and premiered at the 2018 Beverly Hills Film Festival.

==Local media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Emley Moor TV transmitter. 

Dewsbury&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Radio Leeds on 92.4 FM, Heart Yorkshire on 106.2 FM, Capital Yorkshire on 105.6 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire on 96.3 FM, Hits Radio West Yorkshire on 102.5 FM, and Branch Radio, a community based radio station that broadcast from the town on 101.8 FM.

The Dewsbury Reporter is the town&#x27;s local weekly newspaper.

==Education==
Dewsbury had two grammar schools – Wheelwright Grammar School for Boys and, further up the hill, Wheelwright Grammar School for Girls. The 1970s education reforms converted these two establishments to high schools and they were renamed Dewsbury College and Birkdale High School. Dewsbury College was merged with Huddersfield Technical College to become part of Kirklees College in 2008, and is now known by that name. 

Birkdale High School closed in July 2011. In the 2005 School League Tables, Dewsbury&#x27;s Eastborough Junior, Infants and Nursery schools were reported to have the most consistently improved results over the past four years. However, the headteacher of the school, Nicola Roth, has been highly critical of School League Tables in the UK, and has been reported to have said, &quot;It would be better if league tables did not exist&quot;.

Batley College of Art and Design, which is part of Kirklees College (Dewsbury Centre), has a strong reputation for print and textile-based art work, whilst St John Fisher Catholic Voluntary Academy is a specialist Sports College and is one of the few schools in the area with a Sixth Form.

==References in popular culture==
Dewsbury is referenced in the Beatles&#x27; 1967 film &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;. A line of dialogue in the film has one of the magicians (all portrayed by the Beatles themselves) – who are keeping an eye on the whereabouts of the bus that is taking its passengers on the journey of the film&#x27;s title – exclaim: &quot;The bus is north on the Dewsbury road and they&#x27;re having a lovely time!&quot; Dewsbury is also referenced in the 1991 single &quot;It&#x27;s Grim Up North&quot; by the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (also known as the KLF).

The 1960 book &quot;A Kind of Loving&quot; is set in a fictional city named &quot;Cressley&quot;, but its description was based upon Dewsbury. The author, Stan Barstow, was born in Horbury and grew up in Ossett – both of which are just to the east of Dewsbury.

More recently, the phrase &quot;Dewsbury noir&quot; has been used to describe the violent novels of David Peace, who was born in Dewsbury but lives in neighbouring Ossett.

<doc id="149872" wikidata="Q2265847" url="?curid=149872" title="Elland">
<text>Elland is a market town in Calderdale, in the county of West Yorkshire, England. It is situated south of Halifax, by the River Calder and the Calder and Hebble Navigation. Elland was recorded as &quot;Elant&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086. It had a population in 2001 of 14,554, with the ward being measured at 11,676 in the 2011 Census.

==Etymology==
The name of Elland is attested in the 1086 Domesday Book as &quot;Elant&quot;. The name comes from the Old English words &quot;ēa&quot; (&#x27;river&#x27;) and &quot;land&quot; (&#x27;land&#x27;); the name relates to the settlement&#x27;s location on the south bank of the Calder.

==History==
Elland retained continuity of tenure from before the Norman Conquest into the Middle Ages, as the Elland family were descended from Anglo-Saxon thegns. The Manor of Elland, with Greetland and Southowram, formed an exclave of the Honour of Pontefract in the surrounding Manor of Wakefield. In 1350 Sir John de Eland was murdered, as were his son and grandson in the following year, which extinguished the male line of the family and the manor passed to the Savile family. From this period, the manor house ceased to be the principal dwelling of a gentry family, as the Saviles had their seat at the moated manor of Thornhill. Elland manor house was never completely reconstructed and, when dismantled and excavated in 1975 by the West Yorkshire Archaeology Unit, it was found to incorporate a 13th-century solar wing – one of the earliest secular buildings in the county. The manor house stood on a knoll aligned with the bridge over the River Calder and was destroyed during the construction of Calderdale Way bypass. The farm buildings survive.

At the request of John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey, Edward II granted a charter, to John de Eland, for a free market on Tuesday at his Manor of Elland, and two fairs.

The town became a centre of wool production. The decline of the woollen industry had a significant effect on the town and many mills were demolished or converted to residences.

Durable flagstones, Elland flags, were quarried near the town and after the canal was constructed, they could be transported economically all over the county. Elland housed the main factory of the manufacturer of Gannex products and is the home of the Dobsons sweet factory, which produces traditional boiled sweets. Since 2001, Elland has been home to Suma Wholefoods, the largest workers&#x27; co-operative in the United Kingdom.

==Governance==
Elland was historically a township, with Greetland, in the large ancient parish of Halifax. The township became a civil parish in 1866, but in 1894 Elland was separated from Greetland and became Elland Urban District (and civil parish). In 1937 Greetland and Stainland were added to the Urban District. In 1974 the urban district and civil parish were abolished and merged into Calderdale Metropolitan Borough.

== Landmarks ==

Buildings of interest include the parish church of St Mary the Virgin, the former Rose and Crown Inn in Northgate, Elland Town Hall, Southgate Methodist Church, the reputedly haunted Fleece Inn at the top of Westgate, the Rex Cinema and Waxman ceramics on Elland Lane. The remains of the medieval stocks can be found at the junction of Southgate and Elizabeth Street. The stocks, which are grade II listed, date from the late 17th, or early 18th century.

==Elland Power Station==

Elland Power Station was a coal-fired power station by the River Calder. It was decommissioned and closed in 1991, in keeping with the trend of generating power at fewer but larger power stations away from towns, and demolished in 1996.

==Transport==
The Calder and Hebble Navigation opened in the late-18th century to serve the growing industrialisation of the Calder Valley. Elland railway station closed in 1962 but the line is still in use as a passenger service for the Caldervale Line. The station has been proposed for re-opening with direct services to , Bradford, Halifax and .

As of March 2023 planning approval for the new station has been granted, with building work due to begin in 2024 and an estimated completion date of 2025.

The A643 road begins in Leeds and ended in Elland. It passes Leeds United&#x27;s football ground, Elland Road. It now ends at junction 23 of the M62 motorway. The Elland bypass started construction on 23 February 1976 to finish by the end of August 1978, costing £8.5 million, built by A. Monk. The steel construction was by Braithwaites. It was opened at 11 am on Wednesday 13 December 1978 by Tom Batty, the chairman of West Yorkshire County Council.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Emley Moor and the local relay TV transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Leeds, Heart Yorkshire, Capital Yorkshire, Hits Radio West Yorkshire, Greatest Hits Radio West Yorkshire, and Phoenix Radio, a community based station. 

The local newspapers are the &quot;Halifax Courier&quot;, the &quot;Telegraph &amp; Argus&quot; and the &quot;Huddersfield Daily Examiner&quot;.

<doc id="149874" wikidata="Q298738" url="?curid=149874" title="ATA Airlines">
<text>ATA Airlines, Inc., formerly known as American Trans Air and commonly referred to as ATA, was an American low-cost and charter airline based in Indianapolis, Indiana. ATA operated scheduled passenger flights throughout the U.S. mainland and Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Portugal as well as military and commercial charter flights around the world.

In its early days, the airline flew charters on a worldwide basis and had bases in Chicago, Detroit, New York, Indianapolis, Oakland, and Milwaukee. Later, when it entered scheduled service, the airline maintained focus cities at Chicago Midway International Airport, Honolulu International Airport, and Oakland International Airport.

The airline&#x27;s parent company – New ATA Holdings, Inc. (the successor to ATA Holdings Inc., which was also once known as Amtran) – later changed its name to Global Aero Logistics, Inc. and purchased World Air Holdings, Inc. for $315 million in an all-cash transaction with the financial backing of the investment firm, MatlinPatterson. World Air Holdings, Inc. owned and operated North American Airlines and World Airways as two separate US-certified air carriers. ATA was North America&#x27;s largest charter airline, and until its shutdown, it transported more troops for the United States military than any other commercial airline.

On April 2, 2008, ATA filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. ATA then announced it was ceasing all services, effective 4:00am EDT on Thursday, April 3, 2008, citing the unexpected loss of a major contract for its military charter business, as a subcontractor of FedEx Express, along with recent increases in jet fuel prices. Red-eye flights in the air at the time of the announcement proceeded to their destinations. Flight 4586 from Honolulu to Phoenix was the last ATA flight, departing almost two hours late at 12:10am (HST) arriving April 3, 2008, at 8:48am (MST).

Southwest Airlines owns and retains the operating certificate and all assets previously held by ATA Airlines including trademarks, logos, etc. These were purchased for $7.5 million by Southwest while ATA was operating under bankruptcy protection.

==History==

===Early years===
ATA began as American Trans Air to provide aircraft for Ambassadair, an air travel club that had been founded by owner J. George Mikelsons in August 1973 after he had spent eight years at the Voyager 1000 air travel club, including as chief pilot. Its first aircraft was a Boeing 720 named &quot;Miss Indy&quot;, with a second Boeing 720 (&quot;Spirit of Indiana&quot;) added in 1978. ATA received its common-air carrier certificate in March 1981. Operations started as a charter carrier in 1981, with a fleet of eight Boeing 707s based in Indianapolis. In 1983, American Trans Air introduced its first McDonnell Douglas DC-10, a series -10, followed in 1984 by a long range series -40. Amtran, Inc., was founded by Mikelsons in 1984 as the holding company for Ambassadair, ATA, and any future subsidiaries. The airline replaced the 707s with Boeing 727-100 trijets in 1984, and added Rolls-Royce powered Lockheed L-1011 TriStar wide body jetliners (most of which were ex-Delta Air Lines and TWA) in 1985, and Boeing 757-200s in 1989. ATA was an all charter airline flying to destinations all over the world. American Trans Air started its first scheduled service in 1986 between Indianapolis (Indianapolis International Airport), and Fort Myers, Florida (Southwest Florida International Airport).

===Expansion===
In 1990, ATA began scheduled nonstop service using Boeing 757-200 aircraft from New York JFK Airport to Belfast, Northern Ireland, in the United Kingdom with continuing direct one stop service to Riga, Latvia. The founder of ATA is of Latvian ancestry. The Latvia service was unprofitable and was discontinued after a few years.

ATA performed services for the United States Department of Defense and US military during the 1991 Gulf War, transporting 108,000 military personnel on 494 missions for Operation Desert Storm and again during Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom with the activation of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (&quot;CRAF&quot;). During these periodic activations, ATA flight crews often and routinely spent as many as 19 hours aboard ATA aircraft in support of U.S. troops and the overall national defense missions. ATA&#x27;s L-1011 aircraft were also chartered by the Department of Defense to fly personnel and their families between Philadelphia International Airport and Lajes Field, Naval Air Station Sigonella, Aviano Air Base and Incirlik Air Base (called &quot;Freedom Flights&quot; by personnel returning to the U.S. from these overseas installations).

In February 1991, ATA won a contract for daily 727-100 shuttle operations between Nellis Air Force Base and Tonopah Test Range in Nevada. This particular contract, formerly operated by defunct Key Airlines, was awarded to ATA and ended in late 1992 when Tonopah F-117 Stealth Fighter operations ceased. The 727-100s were replaced with Boeing 727-200s in 1993. Also in 1993, according to the Official Airline Guide (OAG), ATA was operating scheduled passenger service between New York JFK Airport and Lagos, Nigeria, via a stop at Santa Maria Island in the Azores with a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar wide body jetliner.

By the mid-1990s, ATA began focusing on increasing its domestic scheduled services including Hawaii as well as international routes to Mexico and the Caribbean (based on leisure travel) and began using the slogan, &quot;On ATA, You&#x27;re on Vacation&quot;. The airline began operating a sizable hub at Chicago Midway International Airport and offered scheduled services throughout the continental United States, as well as flights to Hawaii, Mexico and the Caribbean, all while continuing extensive military and government contract air charter flights.

ATA also began a twice weekly charter service from Orlando to both London Gatwick Airport and Manchester in the UK. All these services operated via Gander in eastern Canada where the aircraft would refuel. Most seats were reserved by UK tour operator Travel City Direct, who specialized in Florida fly-drive vacations. Travel City boasted higher luggage allowances, complimentary meals and snacks plus leather seats. Remaining seats were often filled by American military staff.

Services to the UK ceased in 2002 when Travel City switched to another airline, Air Atlanta Europe.

In 2000, ATA placed a large order for 39 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft and 12 Boeing 757-300 aircraft to expand its fleet for additional flights from Midway. That year, the airline also began scheduled flights to Mexico and was designated as a major carrier by the United States Department of Transportation.

In June 2001, ATA received the delivery of their first new aircraft, Boeing 737-800 registered as &quot;N301TZ&quot;. In August of that same year, the airline received the delivery of another new type of aircraft, the Boeing 757-300, for which ATA was the North American Launch customer. ATA&#x27;s first 757-300 was registered &quot;N550TZ&quot; and the airline also introduced a new logo on these new airplanes, replacing ATA as a &quot;vacation airline&quot; and putting more emphasis on ATA as a &quot;business airline.&quot;

After 2001 the 737-800 with their ETOPS capabilities became the fleet&#x27;s mainstay of ATA&#x27;s medium haul operations from the west coast to and from Hawaii and Mexico.

====Chicago Express / ATA Connection====
In 2000, ATA and Chicago Express Airlines launched ATA Connection, a regional affiliate of ATA Airlines that would link regional mid-western cities with ATA&#x27;s Chicago hub and Indianapolis focus city. Chicago Express was purchased for $1.9 million on June 1, 1999, and operated as a separate subsidiary. After ATA entered bankruptcy in late 2004, a decision was made to end ATA&#x27;s regional airline service and terminate Chicago Express/ATA Connection, resulting in the permanent layoff of its entire staff. Chicago Express&#x27; assets were auctioned off and it ceased all operations on March 28, 2005.

====American Trans Air====
The similarity of the American Trans Air and AirTran Airways names to those of other airlines caused confusion among customers and the general public. The airline had been known informally as ATA from early in its history, and from the mid-1990s on had been advertised as such, so in 2002 the name of the holding company was changed to ATA Holdings Corp. In 2003, the name of the airline itself was changed to ATA Airlines. In 2007, ATA Holdings changed names again; this time to Global Aero Logistics, Inc., immediately after the acquisition of World Air Holdings.

===First bankruptcy===
After the economic upheaval caused by the 9/11 attacks upon the airline industry of the United States, ATA and its then parent company AMTRAN suffered substantial financial hardships. Among the small group of airlines to receive ATSB backing from the US Government, this alone proved not enough for American Trans Air to remain out of reorganization caused from the hardships and ill-timing of the refleeting to 737-800s just prior to the terrorism attacks.

On October 26, 2004, ATA Holdings and its subsidiaries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Eventually, shareholders of ATA Holdings stock lost all their money and received no shares. The stock, previously traded on the Nasdaq stock exchange as &quot;ATAH&quot;, was delisted.

In 2004, AirTran Airways agreed to pay $90 million for ATA&#x27;s 14 gates at Chicago-Midway. Southwest made a higher bid and the deal with AirTran fell apart.

In December 2004, ATA entered into an agreement with Southwest Airlines to transfer six gates at Chicago Midway International Airport and 27% of non-voting stock in exchange for a cash influx and a codeshare agreement.

In the beginning of 2005, the airline drastically reduced flights at its Indianapolis hub to only three destinations and centered scheduled flights at Chicago Midway International Airport in order to complement Southwest Airlines codeshare flights. ATA also focused on serving markets that were business oriented and did not have Southwest service, such as San Francisco, Dallas/Fort Worth, and New York–LaGuardia. Additionally, ATA began offering point-to-point service not connecting to its Midway Hub, as to benefit other Southwest Airlines focus cities, such as Las Vegas, Orlando, and Phoenix, with connections to non-Southwest destinations such as Denver and Hawaii. Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said that revenues were up nearly 20% due to the new codesharing agreement.

On March 28, 2005, ATA shut down its commuter airline service, ATA Connection operated by Chicago Express Airlines via a codeshare agreement, and later sold the assets to a private buyer. ATA Connection had initially operated British Aerospace Jetstream 31 turboprops which were then replaced with Saab 340B turboprops and was providing passenger feed for ATA at Chicago Midway Airport via a code sharing agreement. In attempt to reduce operating costs, the airline also downsized its fleet by returning twenty Boeing 737-800 and eight Boeing 757-300 aircraft, along with numerous Boeing 757-200 aircraft. The eight 757-300 airframes were subsequently refurbished by Boeing, the lessor, and then leased to Continental Airlines.

In mid-2005, ATA entered an agreement to lease three ex-United Airlines Boeing 737-300 aircraft. Three 737-300s entered service with ATA in late November 2005. Due to high lease rates, the three 737-300s were taken out of service in November 2007, and returned to their owners.

In September 2005, ATA outsourced all its Heavy Maintenance Checks to overseas and domestic contractors. Also planned was an agreement with Continental Airlines to trade ATA&#x27;s remaining four 757-300 aircraft for four 737-700 aircraft. In early October 2005, ATA terminated these negotiations due to the Boeing machinists strike, which would have delayed the delivery of the aircraft.

On October 13, 2005, ATA announced major service reductions, ending flights to Boston, Minneapolis/St. Paul, and Newark. In addition, the planned addition of flights to Miami and Sarasota, Florida was canceled. This ended Southwest codeshare service to Minneapolis and Newark. Later that year, on November 1, 2005, a second round of flight cuts were announced, including the suspension of scheduled service to Denver, San Juan, and their headquarters and former hub, Indianapolis.

On November 17, 2005, ATA Airlines received court approval to sell its Ambassadair Travel Club division to Grueninger Cruises and Tours.

In a third round of cuts announced on December 6, 2005, ATA announced that it would discontinue service to three additional cities. ATA suspended flights from Chicago Midway International Airport to San Francisco, Orlando, and Fort Myers in late April 2006. Following these cancellations, ATA had only 18 daily scheduled departures from its former Chicago hub and 52 scheduled departures company-wide. Moreover, the company was left with only one gate at Midway, down from its previous total of 14, surrendering the balance to Southwest or the airport.

On December 15, 2005, ATA announced an expansion of its codeshare agreement with Southwest Airlines between Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and cities in the Southwest system that connected via Chicago Midway International Airport.

In January 2006, MatlinPatterson and certain pre-bankruptcy creditors invested over $100 million in ATA and took the company private, also taking over ATA Holdings, Inc. Following the transaction, on February 28, 2006, ATA emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. However, the airline was still shrinking. ATA continued to return more aircraft, including the 1,500th Boeing 737 Next Generation produced, N333TZ, which had been delivered new to ATA on May 14, 2004.

===Final years===

Following its first emergence from Chapter 11 protection ATA made several efforts to return to profitability, but due to the rising cost of fuel and negative pressures on ticket price ATA was unable to recover and ended operations on April 2, 2008. These late efforts included:

====2006====
* ATA commenced service between Houston&#x27;s William P. Hobby Airport (HOU) and New York&#x27;s LaGuardia Airport (LGA).
* ATA initiated new flights out of Oakland, California, Ontario, California and Hilo, Hawaii on April 28, 2006.
* In support of its codeshare agreement with Southwest Airlines, ATA moved its operations in the greater San Francisco area from San Francisco International Airport to Oakland International Airport.
* ATA introduced several new flights from the West Coast of the United States to and from Hawaii including the only nonstop service between Hilo and the mainland United States.
* ATA announced they would purchase nine of Northwest Airlines remaining DC-10-30s. These aircraft were to be used on military troop charters, replacing ATA&#x27;s aging L1011-500 fleet. ATA planned to enter seven of the planes into service, mothballing the remainder for parts.

====2007====
* ATA Airlines announced that Subodh Karnik would become ATA&#x27;s new president and chief executive officer (CEO) replacing John G. Denison, who continued as ATA&#x27;s chairman of the board of directors.
* ATA for the first time in three years added several flights to and from its Chicago (MDW) hub.
* ATA&#x27;s parent company, ATA Holdings, announced on April 5, 2007, that it would change its name to Global Aero Logistics, Inc., in a move that, according to then-CEO Subodh Karnik, &quot;better reflects the company&#x27;s diverse, worldwide operations&quot;. That same day, Global Aero Logistics, Inc. announced an agreement to acquire World Air Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, World Airways and North American Airlines, for $315 million in cash. Each airline, as stated in the official announcement, was to keep operating independently. With the acquisition of World Airways, and the holding companies organizational name change to Global Aero Logistics, it was decided that three of the planned nine DC-10s acquired by ATA would be transferred directly to World Airways&#x27; operating certificate, resulting in employee layoffs at ATA.
* Starting in October 2007, ATA announced it would terminate service on several routes affecting Chicago Midway International Airport, Washington D.C. Reagan National Airport, LaGuardia Airport, and LA/Ontario International Airport. These service cuts left ATA operating to four destinations from its former Chicago hub.

====2008====
* In March 2008, Subodh Karnik resigned as CEO and former CEO and chairman of the board John G. Denison served as acting CEO until ATA&#x27;s demise. No public reason was given for Karnik&#x27;s departure, but the airline&#x27;s financial problems coupled with the poor execution of the purchase of several DC-10s for use as military charters was rumored to have been a factor.

====2010====
* A federal jury for the U.S. District Court in Indianapolis ruled that FedEx must pay $66 million to the now-defunct ATA Airlines, saying the package delivery company broke a contract that ultimately pushed ATA into bankruptcy, with $22 million for lost profit in 2008 and $44 million for lost profit in 2009. However, in December 2011, a Federal appellate court in Chicago reversed the $66 million judgment against FedEx.

===Second bankruptcy and demise===

On April 2, 2008, ATA declared bankruptcy and ceased all operations. This sudden end came about after FedEx abruptly canceled ATA&#x27;s longstanding military charter contract. Combined with a significant increase in the price of jet fuel, ATA did not have enough capital to stay in business. It was the third of four U.S. airlines to announce a complete shut down in the week of March 30, 2008, after Aloha Airlines did so on March 30, Minnesota-based charter Champion Air did so March 31, and Skybus Airlines terminated service on April 5. The shutdown of ATA took effect at 4:00am EDT, Thursday April 3, 2008, although some flights were airborne at the time and continued to their destinations, with the final arrival being ATA flight 4586 from Honolulu to Phoenix, which landed at 8:46am, MST, or seven hours and 46 minutes after the announced shutdown. At the time of the shutdown ATA employed around 2,300 people, all of whom were subsequently permanently laid off. According to press reports, up to 10,000 passengers were affected and many of them had to scramble for help on several airlines. Most of them, however, had to pay for new tickets.

On November 19, 2008, Southwest Airlines announced its intent to acquire the remaining assets of ATA Airlines. The $7.5 million bid included the rights to 14 slots at LaGuardia Airport that belonged to ATA, as well as various other assets such as trademarks and logos. Southwest specifically stated their bid &quot;doesn&#x27;t include any aircraft, facilities or employees of ATA&quot;.

==Destinations==
At the time of its shutdown, ATA Airlines served 13 destinations throughout Mexico and the United States. All routes were discontinued on April 2, 2008, due to ATA&#x27;s bankruptcy filing, with the exception of some en route red-eye flights, which arrived on April 3. With ATA&#x27;s additions of Kona and Lihue, Hawaii in June 2007, the airline was serving more Hawaiian destinations nonstop from the mainland United States than any other airline in the world at the time. Scheduled passenger service to a number of destinations listed below was discontinued prior to ATA&#x27;s bankruptcy. At its peak, ATA served 35 destinations worldwide. Some destination information has been taken from ATA route maps from 1994 to 2003.

Commuter air carrier Chicago Express Airlines operating as the ATA Connection served the following destinations with British Aerospace BAe Jetstream 31 and/or Saab 340B commuter turboprop aircraft from Chicago Midway Airport which was an ATA hub:

* Cedar Rapids, Iowa
* Chicago Midway Airport – hub

===USALatin Sky===
On March 15, 2008, ATA was supposed to resume service to Miami International Airport and fly scheduled flights to Central America for the first time with the addition of flights to Guatemala City and San José, Costa Rica. USALatin Sky was to market the airline&#x27;s flights to Central American destinations from Miami. As part of the deal, ATA Airlines would have based a single Boeing 737-800 aircraft in Miami to fly the routes to Guatemala City and San José. Due to a missed scheduled payment from USALatin Sky to ATA, the service was canceled prior to commencing, and no flights under USALatin Sky ever operated.

==Fleet==
At the time of its shut down, ATA had 29 aircraft (3 owned, 26 leased) in its fleet. At its largest in October 2004, the company operated a fleet of 82 short, medium, and long-haul aircraft.

As of August 2009, ATA&#x27;s average fleet age was 13.5 years old.

ATA&#x27;s Boeing customer number was 3N.

==Affinity programs==

===ATA Travel Awards===
Launched in 2003, ATA&#x27;s frequent flyer program, ATA Travel Awards, offered one of the lowest thresholds for earning travel, with the added benefit of allowing reward redemption free of blackout date restrictions. After three roundtrips booked on the company&#x27;s website, customers earned a coach companion ticket on any flight operated by ATA Airlines throughout the contiguous United States. All tickets booked online received double credit toward that particular trip versus purchasing through a telephone or travel agent. While award availability to Hawaii was very limited, travelers did earn twice the normal number of credits when they purchased airfare on Hawaii-bound flights. With the shutdown of operations, ATA&#x27;s frequent flyer programs were suspended and all earned points voided.

As a result of the recent enhancements in ATA&#x27;s codeshare agreement with Southwest Airlines, those purchasing flights directly from ATA reservations and ata.com were given the option of earning points toward either ATA Travel Awards, or Southwest&#x27;s Rapid Rewards. When ATA ceased operations, the relationship with Southwest Airlines was effectively terminated.

===ATA Airlines FlightBank===
Launched in 2006, ATA created a unique program called FlightBank, a rewards program for the frequent traveler between the U.S. mainland and the Hawaiian Islands. For a set &quot;fee&quot;, the &quot;bank&quot; provided the traveler with a flexible number of flight credits that could be used over the course of a year, at vastly reduced savings and with no blackout dates for advance bookings. (The Flightbank program was preceded by the airpass program which was run informally by Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays from 2000 to 2006.) With the shutdown of operations, ATA&#x27;s FlightBank program was also suspended.

==Service==
Although ATA Airlines was marketed and advertised as a &quot;low-cost carrier&quot;, it maintained many of the features which marked this airline as full service, at least by the standards American and European travelers have become accustomed to. Unlike many discount airline carriers in Europe, ATA offered complimentary features such as reclining airline seats on all of its airplanes, leather seats on most of its airplanes, adjustable head rest &quot;wings&quot; on many of its planes, limited AVOD audio visual on demand systems, complimentary assigned seating, complimentary checked luggage, complimentary soft drinks and non-alcoholic beverage, complimentary bookings via website reservations, complimentary inter-airline baggage connection transfers, and frequent flyer programs.

ATA sold snacks and snack packs under the label Skyway Café. Upon military and most charter flights, ATA provided fully complimentary airline meals or depending upon flight length, snacks. On some flights it provided in-flight entertainment such as documentaries, comedies, &quot;classic television,&quot; music videos, and music. ATA aircraft included up to eight audio channels. Some flights over five hours included films.

==Codeshare agreements==
At the time of its shutdown, ATA Airlines had a codeshare agreement with Southwest Airlines. As far back as 2001, ATA explored a passenger sharing agreement, with a now defunct airline called Access Air which also had midwestern United States flight operations. This agreement was short lived due to the tedious economic condition of this post deregulation &quot;start up&quot; carrier. The ATA Connection service flown by commuter air carrier Chicago Express Airlines was also operated on a codeshare basis.

ATA was not involved in an alliance.

===Southwest Airlines===

ATA Airlines, one of Southwest Airlines&#x27; main competitors in the Chicago market, historically operated out of Midway Airport alongside Southwest. After ATA declared bankruptcy in 2004, Southwest injected capital into ATA that (among other things) would have resulted in Southwest&#x27;s 27.5% ownership stake in ATA upon their exit from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.

In a departure from its traditional &quot;go it alone&quot; strategy, Southwest entered into its first domestic codesharing arrangement with ATA, which enabled Southwest Airlines to serve ATA markets in Hawaii, Washington D.C., and New York City. Some years earlier, Southwest had a short-lived traditional codeshare arrangement with Icelandair at Baltimore/Washington International Airport.

In late 2005, ATA secured $100 million in committed financing from the firm of MatlinPatterson, and Southwest&#x27;s original deal with ATA was modified such that Southwest no longer retained the 27.5% stake (or any other financial interest), in ATA. The codeshare arrangement was expanded, with some internal controversy, to include all of ATA&#x27;s domestic destinations and more than 60 of Southwest&#x27;s 63 destinations. In 2006, Southwest&#x27;s pilot union approved a codeshare sideletter to their contract with limitations on the growth of this and other codeshare agreements. While these restrictions today are minor, outsourcing remains a growing concern in the unions&#x27; current contract negotiations.

In 2006, Southwest Airlines (Flight Code WN) began marketing ATA&#x27;s two-letter TZ Coded Flights. ATA&#x27;s dependence on the Southwest network continued to grow in 2006 to where ATA offered over 70 flights a week to Hawaii from Southwest&#x27;s focus cities in PHX, LAS, LAX, and OAK. Additional connecting service was available to many other cities across the United States. Plans had been announced for ATA to offer exclusive international service for Southwest by 2010. In 2006, ATA announced its intention to purchase nine widebody DC-10 aircraft from Northwest Airlines. Southwest took over all ground operations for ATA at MDW, OAK, PHX, LAX, and LAS. These contracts provided that Southwest ramp personnel would now handle all ground operations for ATA (loading of aircraft, ground servicing, etc.). The details of these contracts were not made public, but represented Southwest&#x27;s and ATA&#x27;s growing codeshare relationship.

In February 2005, after J. George Mikelsons stepped down as CEO of ATA Airlines, John Denison, Southwest&#x27;s former Chief Financial Officer took over. Effective January 1, 2007, Denison turned things over to Subodh Karnik, who became president and chief executive officer. Denison remained Chairman of Global Aero Logistics Inc., and was renamed as interim President and CEO when Subodh Karnik stepped down in March 2008.

==Livery==
In ATA Airlines&#x27; 35-year history, the airline had three different mainline liveries and two special liveries.

===Mainline liveries and logos===

====Final (flag)====
ATA&#x27;s last livery, known as the &quot;Flag Livery&quot;, was introduced when the airline announced rapid expansion in 2001. It was primarily white with &quot;ATA&quot; painted on both sides of the aircraft. The company logo was also slanted upward on the aircraft tail resembling a flag. There was a gold stripe that spanned across the outward side of the engines and nacelles, and the winglets (on the 737-800s) were blue on the outside and unpainted on the inside. This livery was first introduced on ATA&#x27;s new 737-800 and 757-300 aircraft and while it has been integrated onto some of ATA&#x27;s 757-200s, it was never painted on any of ATA&#x27;s 727s which were retired in late 2001.

====Vacation / Holiday (palm tree)====
At the time of ATA&#x27;s demise, many 757-200s and some Lockheed L-1011s still carried the airline&#x27;s previous livery. The &quot;Palm Tree Livery&quot;, which was introduced in 1996, was also primarily white with &quot;ATA&quot; painted on both sides of the aircraft; the letters were painted in a &quot;bubble-like&quot; fashion. There was a palm tree and a sun on the tail, as well as &quot;ATA&quot; in small letters. The engine nacelles were painted blue, with the outboard side of each nacelle displaying a stylized sun. This livery, introduced to emphasize ATA as a &quot;vacation airline&quot;, was synonymous with the phrase &quot;On ATA, You&#x27;re on Vacation&quot;.

====Original (runway)====
ATA&#x27;s original livery, known as the &quot;Runway Livery&quot;, was introduced when the airline began passenger service in 1981. Because ATA&#x27;s first aircraft were ex-American Airlines aircraft, ATA&#x27;s original livery was based on American&#x27;s livery. The livery featured three stripes running the length of the aircraft in the following order: gold, white, and blue. The words &quot;American Trans Air&quot; followed by ATA&#x27;s &quot;runway logo&quot; were painted above the gold stripe on the fuselage. The aircraft tail also featured gold, white, and blue stripes along the bottom with a bigger ATA runway logo in the center. All of ATA&#x27;s Boeing 707s, and a majority of the airline&#x27;s 727s, 757-200s, and Lockheed L-1011s wore this livery at some point. This livery was painted on every ATA aircraft until 1996, making this ATA&#x27;s longest lasting livery at 15 years.

===Special liveries===
Throughout ATA Airlines&#x27; history, the company had two dedicated paint schemes. In addition to these, ATA&#x27;s first Boeing 737-800 had the words &quot;American Dream&quot; inscribed alongside the nose of the aircraft; it was the only aircraft in ATA&#x27;s fleet to have those words written on it. Other schemes were used to celebrate the company&#x27;s 25th anniversary, as well as a marketing deal with Hawaiian tour operator, Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays.

====25th Anniversary====
In 1998, ATA Airlines celebrated its 25th anniversary. The airline decided to commemorate the anniversary in a big way. In addition to a year-long celebration, two separate aircraft, N772AT (a Boeing 727-200) and N520AT (a Boeing 757-200), were given a special livery which was commonly referred to as the &quot;25th Anniversary Scheme&quot;. The design featured the entire airplane painted blue with &quot;25th Anniversary&quot; painted in large gold writing near the front of the aircraft fuselage. The aircraft tail featured &quot;ATA&quot; in gold lettering with pieces of confetti scattered around the ATA logo. Red, orange, pink, and yellow streamers adorned the sides of the fuselage, as well as the engines.

====Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays====
In 1994, ATA partnered with tour operator Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays, which was the largest tour operator flying to Hawaii. To promote the alliance, several L-1011s were adorned in a &quot;Hawaiian livery&quot;. The &quot;Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays&quot; livery has appeared only on two types of ATA&#x27;s aircraft: the Lockheed L-1011, and later, the Boeing 757-300. The livery had two different forms; the more extravagant was painted on the Lockheed L-1011s. The livery was primarily white and featured &quot;ATA&quot; in big bubble letters near the front of the aircraft, and &quot;Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays&quot; spelled out after &quot;ATA&quot; near the top of the fuselage. Like the mainline livery, the engines were painted with a sun. The livery basically resembled the &quot;Palm Tree Livery&quot; that mainline aircraft adorned at the time. There was one big difference. &quot;Hawaii&quot; was spelled out in large letters horizontally across the aircraft tail. After the L-1011s were removed from scheduled service in 2002, two Boeing 757-300s were painted in the Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays livery; the elaborate TriStar livery was replaced with a toned-down livery. The new livery was ATA&#x27;s current livery with the words &quot;Pleasant Holidays&quot; painted in small letters near the front of the fuselage. This livery and ATA&#x27;s partnership with Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays was terminated in 2005 when Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays signed a larger network deal with United Airlines.

==Incidents and accidents==
On May 12, 1996, a Boeing 727-290, N775AT, operated as American Trans Air flight 406, experienced a decompression at 33,000 feet. The flight, which was bound for St. Petersburg, Florida, made an emergency landing at the Indianapolis International Airport, Indianapolis, Indiana.

On August 10, 1986, an ATA DC-10-40 parked at the ramp at Chicago O&#x27;Hare International Airport was destroyed by fire due to a mishandled loose oxygen canister. There were no fatalities.

<text>Sir John Barbirolli ( Giovanni Battista Barbirolli; 2 December 189929 July 1970) was a British conductor and cellist. He is remembered above all as conductor of the Hallé Orchestra in Manchester, which he helped save from dissolution in 1943 and conducted for the rest of his life. Earlier in his career he was Arturo Toscanini&#x27;s successor as music director of the New York Philharmonic, serving from 1936 to 1943. He was also chief conductor of the Houston Symphony from 1961 to 1967, and was a guest conductor of many other orchestras, including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, the Philharmonia, the Berlin Philharmonic and the Vienna Philharmonic, with all of which he made recordings.

Born in London of Italian and French parentage, Barbirolli grew up in a family of professional musicians. After starting out as a cellist, he was given the chance to conduct, from 1926 with the British National Opera Company, and then with Covent Garden&#x27;s touring company. On taking up the conductorship of the Hallé he had less opportunity to work in the opera house, but in the 1950s he conducted productions of works by Verdi, Wagner, Gluck, and Puccini at Covent Garden with such success that he was invited to become the company&#x27;s permanent musical director, an invitation he declined. Late in his career he made several recordings of operas, of which his 1967 set of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; for EMI is probably the best known.

Both in the concert hall and on record, Barbirolli was particularly associated with the music of English composers such as Elgar, Delius and Vaughan Williams. His interpretations of other late Romantic composers, such as Mahler and Sibelius, as well as of earlier classical composers, including Schubert, are also still admired.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Giovanni Battista Barbirolli was born on 2 December 1899 in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, &quot;née&quot; Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of &quot;Otello&quot; in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square.

The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child&#x27;s habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from &quot;getting in everybody&#x27;s way&quot;. His education at St Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen&#x27;s Hall in 1911.
The following year he won the Ada Lewis Scholarship to study at the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy&#x27;s Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 &quot;The Musical Times&quot; singled him out as &quot;that excellent young &#x27;cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.&quot; The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as &quot;a pernicious influence&quot;. Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel&#x27;s String Quartet in the privacy of a men&#x27;s lavatory in the Academy.

From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London. He recalled, &quot;My first orchestral engagement was with the Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra – I was probably the youngest orchestral musician ever, joining them in 1916. We had an enormous repertory – six concerts a week, three hours or more rehearsal a day. In those days we were happy if we began and finished together&quot;. While playing in the Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra, Barbirolli also played in the opera pit for the Beecham and Carl Rosa opera companies, in recitals with the pianist Ethel Bartlett, with orchestras in theatres, cinemas, hotels and dance-halls, and, as he said, &quot;everywhere except the street&quot;. During the last year of the First World War, Barbirolli enlisted in the army and became a lance-corporal in the Suffolk Regiment. Here he had his first opportunity to conduct, when an orchestra of volunteers was formed. He later described the experience:

While in the army, Barbirolli adopted the anglicised form of his first name for the sake of simplicity: &quot;The sergeant-major had great difficulty in reading my name on the roll-call. &#x27;Who is this Guy Vanni?&#x27; he used to ask. So I chose John.&quot; After demobilisation he reverted to the original form of his name, using it until 1922.

On re-entering civilian life, Barbirolli resumed his career as a cellist. His association with Edward Elgar&#x27;s Cello Concerto began with its première in 1919, when he played as a rank and file member of the London Symphony Orchestra. He was the soloist at another performance of the concerto just over a year later. &quot;The Musical Times&quot; commented, &quot;Signor Giovanni Barbirolli was not entirely equal to the demands of the solo music, but his playing unquestionably gave a considerable amount of pleasure.&quot; At the Three Choirs Festival of 1920 he took part in his first &quot;Dream of Gerontius&quot;, under Elgar&#x27;s baton, in the LSO cellos. He joined two newly founded string quartets as cellist: the Kutcher Quartet, led by his former fellow student at Trinity, Samuel Kutcher, and the Music Society Quartet (later called the International Quartet) led by André Mangeot. He also made several early broadcasts with Mangeot&#x27;s quartet.

===First conducting posts===
Barbirolli&#x27;s ambition was to conduct. He was the prime mover in establishing the Guild of Singers and Players Chamber Orchestra in 1924, and in 1926 he was invited to conduct a new ensemble at the Chenil Gallery in Chelsea, initially called the &quot;Chenil Chamber Orchestra&quot; but later renamed &quot;John Barbirolli&#x27;s Chamber Orchestra&quot;. Barbirolli&#x27;s concerts impressed Frederic Austin, director of the British National Opera Company (BNOC), who in the same year invited him to conduct some performances with the company. Barbirolli had never conducted a chorus or a large orchestra, but had the confidence to accept. He made his operatic debut directing Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; at Newcastle, followed within days by performances of &quot;Aida&quot; and &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;. He conducted the BNOC frequently over the next two years, and made his debut at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, with &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; in 1928. The following year he was invited to conduct the opening work in Covent Garden&#x27;s international season, &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, with a cast that included Mariano Stabile, Elisabeth Schumann and Heddle Nash.
In 1929, after financial problems had forced the BNOC to disband, the Covent Garden management set up a touring company to fill the gap, and appointed Barbirolli as its musical director and conductor. The operas in the company&#x27;s first provincial tour included &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot;, &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, &quot;La bohème&quot;, &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, &quot;Tosca&quot;, &quot;Falstaff&quot;, &quot;Faust&quot;, &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, and the first performances in English of &quot;Turandot.&quot; In later tours with the company Barbirolli had the chance to conduct more of the German opera repertory, including &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;, &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, and &quot;Die Walküre&quot;. During his years with the touring opera companies Barbirolli did not neglect the concert hall. In 1927, deputising at short notice for Sir Thomas Beecham, he conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in a performance of Elgar&#x27;s Symphony No. 2, winning the thanks of the composer. Barbirolli also won warm praise from Pablo Casals, whom he had accompanied in Haydn&#x27;s D major cello concerto at the same concert. He conducted a Royal Philharmonic Society concert at which Ralph Vaughan Williams was presented with the society&#x27;s Gold Medal, and another RPS concert at which Gustav Mahler&#x27;s music, rarely heard at that time, was given – &quot;Kindertotenlieder&quot;, with Elena Gerhardt as soloist. Although Barbirolli later came to love Mahler&#x27;s music, in the 1930s he thought it sounded thin.

When the Hallé Orchestra announced in 1932 that its regular conductor, Hamilton Harty, was to spend some time conducting overseas, Barbirolli was one of four guest conductors named to direct the orchestra in Harty&#x27;s absence: the other three were Elgar, Beecham and Pierre Monteux. Barbirolli&#x27;s programmes included works by composers as diverse as Purcell, Delius, Mozart and Franck. In June 1932, Barbirolli married the singer Marjorie Parry, a member of the BNOC. In 1933 he was invited to become conductor of the Scottish Orchestra. It was not then, as its successor the Scottish National Orchestra was later to be, a permanent ensemble, but gave a season lasting about six months of each year. Barbirolli remained with the Scottish Orchestra for three seasons, &quot;rejuvenating the playing and programmes and winning most favourable opinions&quot;. Notwithstanding his growing reputation in Britain, Barbirolli&#x27;s name was little known internationally, and most of the musical world was taken by surprise in 1936 when he was invited to conduct the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in succession to Arturo Toscanini.

===New York Philharmonic===
By the spring of 1936, the management of the New York Philharmonic was confronted with a problem. Toscanini had left in search of higher fees with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Wilhelm Furtwängler had accepted the orchestra&#x27;s invitation to fill the post, but he was politically unacceptable to a section of the Philharmonic&#x27;s audience because he continued to live and work in Germany under the Nazi government. Following a campaign of protest in New York he felt unable to take up the appointment. For want of any available conductor of comparable fame the management of the orchestra invited five guest conductors to divide the season among them. Barbirolli was allotted the first ten weeks of the season, comprising 26 concerts. He was followed by the composer-conductors Igor Stravinsky, Georges Enescu and Carlos Chávez, each conducting for two weeks, and finally by Artur Rodziński of the Cleveland Orchestra, for eight weeks.
Barbirolli&#x27;s first concert in New York was on 5 November 1936. The programme consisted of short pieces by Berlioz and Arnold Bax, and symphonies by Mozart (the &quot;Linz&quot;) and Brahms (the Fourth). During his ten weeks, he programmed several American novelties including Charles Martin Loeffler&#x27;s tone-poem &quot;Memories of My Childhood&quot;, a symphony by Anis Fuleihan, and Philip James&#x27;s &quot;Bret Harte&quot; overture. He also conducted Serge Koussevitzky&#x27;s Double Bass Concerto. The players told the Philharmonic management that they would be happy for Barbirolli to be appointed to a permanent position. The outcome of this was an invitation to him to become music director and permanent conductor for three years starting with the 1937–38 season. At the same time as this great change in his professional life, Barbirolli&#x27;s personal life was also transformed. His marriage had not lasted; within four years he and Marjorie Barbirolli had been living apart. In 1938 she sued for divorce on the grounds of his desertion. The suit was undefended, and the divorce was granted in December 1938. In 1939, Barbirolli married the British oboist Evelyn Rothwell. The marriage lasted for the rest of Barbirolli&#x27;s life.

One of the features of Barbirolli&#x27;s time in New York was his regular programming of modern works. He gave the world premières of Walton&#x27;s second &quot;Façade Suite&quot;, and Britten&#x27;s &quot;Sinfonia da Requiem&quot; and Violin Concerto; he also introduced pieces by Jacques Ibert, Eugene Goossens, and Arthur Bliss and by many American composers including Samuel Barber, Deems Taylor and Daniel Gregory Mason. The new works he presented were not avant-garde, but they nevertheless alienated the conservative subscription audience, and after an initial increase in ticket sales in his early years sales declined. Barbirolli also had to cope with what &quot;The Gramophone&quot; described as &quot;a rough press campaign in New York from interested parties who wished to evict him from his post&quot;. The influential critic Olin Downes had opposed Barbirolli&#x27;s appointment from the outset, insisting that, though &quot;we abhor chauvinism&quot;, preference should have been given to &quot;native conductors&quot;. Downes had a grudge against the Philharmonic: shortly before Barbirolli&#x27;s appointment Downes was sacked as the commentator for the orchestra&#x27;s prestigious Sunday broadcasts. He and the composer Virgil Thomson continually wrote disparagingly about Barbirolli, comparing him unfavourably with Toscanini. The management of the orchestra nevertheless renewed Barbirolli&#x27;s appointment in 1940. In 1942, when his second contract was reaching its expiry, he was offered 18 concerts for the 1943–44 season, and the Los Angeles Philharmonic invited him to become its conductor, but he accepted neither offer as he had decided to return to England.

Barbirolli&#x27;s first reason for leaving was local musical politics. He later said, &quot;The Musicians Union there ... brought out a new regulation saying that everyone, even soloists and conductors, must become members. Horowitz, Heifetz and the rest were shocked by this but there was little they could do about it. They also said that conductors must become American citizens. I couldn&#x27;t do that during the war, or at any time for that matter.&quot; His second reason for leaving was that he felt strongly that he was needed in England. In the spring of 1942 he made a hazardous Atlantic crossing:
Barbirolli returned to New York to complete his contractual obligations to the Philharmonic. Shortly after his return he received an appeal from the Hallé Orchestra to become its conductor. The orchestra was in danger of extinction for lack of players, and Barbirolli seized the opportunity to help it.

===Hallé Orchestra===

In 1943 Barbirolli made another Atlantic crossing, avoiding death by a fluke: he changed flights from Lisbon with the actor Leslie Howard when the latter wished to postpone his own flight for a few days. Barbirolli&#x27;s plane landed safely; Howard&#x27;s was shot down. In Manchester, Barbirolli immediately set about reviving the Hallé. The number of players in the orchestra was down to about 30. Most younger players were serving in the armed forces, and to compound the shortage the management of the orchestra had ended the arrangement by which many of its players were also members of the BBC Northern Orchestra. The Hallé board resolved that its orchestra must follow the example of the Liverpool Philharmonic, which the Hallé&#x27;s former conductor Malcolm Sargent had transformed into a full-time, permanent orchestra. Only four of the players shared with the BBC chose to join the Hallé.

&quot;The Times&quot; later wrote of Barbirolli&#x27;s first actions for the orchestra: &quot;In a couple of months of endless auditions, he rebuilt the Hallé, accepting any good player, whatever his musical background – he found himself with a schoolboy first flute, a schoolmistress hornist, and various brass players recruited from brass and military bands in the Manchester area ... The reborn Hallé&#x27;s first concert somehow lived up to the Hallé&#x27;s great reputation.&quot; &quot;The Musical Times&quot; also noted, &quot;From his earliest days with the orchestra it was the string tone that commanded immediate attention and respect. There was a fiery intensity and glowing warmth that proclaimed the born string coach&quot;. Barbirolli retained his reputation for training orchestras: after his death, one of his former players commented, &quot;If you wanted orchestral experience you&#x27;d be set for life, starting in the Hallé with John Barbirolli.&quot; Further afield, critics, audiences and players in Europe and the United States commented on the improvement in the playing of their orchestras when Barbirolli was in charge. Later he extended his teaching skills to the Royal Academy of Music, where he took charge of the student orchestra from 1961.

Barbirolli refused invitations to take up more prestigious and lucrative conductorships. Shortly after he took over the Hallé he received an offer from the sponsors of an ambitious scheme that would have put him in charge of the London Symphony Orchestra, and in the early 1950s the BBC sought to recruit him for the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Also in the early 1950s the head of the Royal Opera House, David Webster, wanted him to become the musical director there. Barbirolli conducted six operas for Webster, &quot;Turandot&quot;, &quot;Aida&quot;, &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;, &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, &quot;La bohème&quot; and &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, 1951–53, but he declined to be wooed away from the Hallé. His biographer Charles Reid wrote, &quot;His Manchester kingdom is a kingdom indeed. He is not manacled or chivied in his choice of programmes. Broadly speaking he conducts only what he loves ... His kingdom approximates to a conductor&#x27;s paradise.&quot; Nevertheless, in 1958, after building the orchestra up and touring continually, conducting up to 75 concerts a year, he arranged a less onerous schedule, allowing him more time to appear as a guest conductor with other orchestras. He also appeared at the Vienna State Opera, and Rome Opera House, where he conducted &quot;Aida&quot; in 1969. In 1960 he accepted an invitation to succeed Leopold Stokowski as chief conductor of the Houston Symphony in Texas, a post he held until 1967, conducting an annual total of 12 weeks there in early spring and late autumn between Hallé engagements. In 1961 he began a regular association with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, which lasted for the rest of his life.
From 1953 onwards, Barbirolli and the Hallé appeared regularly at the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in London. As well as major works from the mainstream repertory they gave an annual concert of music by Viennese composers, including Franz Lehár and Johann Strauss, which, like Sir Malcolm Sargent&#x27;s annual Gilbert and Sullivan nights, rapidly became a firm favourite with the promenaders. At one 1958 promenade concert Barbirolli and the Hallé played a replica of Charles Hallé&#x27;s first concert with the orchestra in 1858.

Barbirolli&#x27;s interest in new music waned in post-war years, but he and the Hallé appeared regularly at the Cheltenham Festival, where he premiered new works of a mostly traditional style by William Alwyn, Richard Arnell, Arthur Benjamin, Peter Racine Fricker, Gordon Jacob, Alan Rawsthorne, Kenneth Leighton and others. For its hundredth anniversary in 1958 the Hallé commissioned several new works, and gave the British premiere of Walton&#x27;s virtuosic divertimento &quot;Partita&quot;. Increasingly, Barbirolli concentrated on his core repertory of the standard symphonic classics, the works of English composers, and late-romantic music, particularly that of Mahler. In the 1960s he made a series of international tours with the Philharmonia (Latin America, 1963), BBC Symphony Orchestra (Czechoslovakia, Poland and the USSR, 1967) and the Hallé (Latin America and West Indies, 1968). It was a lasting disappointment to him that it never proved possible to take the Hallé on a tour of the United States.

In 1968, after 25 years with the Hallé, Barbirolli retired from the principal conductorship; no successor was appointed in his lifetime. He was appointed the orchestra&#x27;s Conductor Laureate. He reduced the number of his appearances with the Hallé, but nevertheless took it on another European tour in 1968, this time to Switzerland, Austria and Germany. In his last years a propensity to concentrate on detail at the expense of the whole of a piece became marked. His loyal friend and admirer the critic Neville Cardus wrote privately in 1969, &quot;he seems so much to love a single phrase that he lingers over it, caressing it; meanwhile the general momentum is lost.&quot; His final year, 1970, was dogged by heart trouble; he suffered collapses in April, May, June and July. His last two concerts were with the Hallé at the 1970 King&#x27;s Lynn Festival. He produced &quot;inspired&quot; renderings of Elgar&#x27;s Symphony No. 1 and &quot;Sea Pictures&quot;. The last work he conducted in public was Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 7 on the Saturday before his death. On the day he died, 29 July 1970, he spent several hours rehearsing the New Philharmonia Orchestra for a forthcoming tour of Japan that he was scheduled to lead.

Barbirolli died at his London home of a heart attack, aged 70. Among planned engagements forestalled by his death were a production of &quot;Otello&quot; at the Royal Opera House, which would have been his first appearance there for nearly 20 years, and opera recordings for EMI, including Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; and Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot;.

==Honours, awards and memorials==

Among Barbirolli&#x27;s state awards were a British knighthood in 1949 and appointment as a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1969; the Finnish Grand Star and Collar of Commander 1st Class of the Order of the White Rose in 1963; from Italy the Order of Merit in 1964; and from France, Officier de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, 1966, and Officier de l&#x27;Ordre national du Mérite, 1968. Awards from musical institutions included the Freedom of the Worshipful Company of Musicians, 1966; Honorary Academician of the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, 1960; Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, 1950; Bruckner Medal, Bruckner Society of America, 1959; and the Mahler Medal, Mahler-Bruckner Society of America, 1965. He was also awarded the title of Doctor of Music &quot;honoris causa&quot; (DMus h.c.) from the National University of Ireland in 1952.

There are memorials to Barbirolli in Manchester and London. Barbirolli Square in Manchester is named in his honour and features a sculpture of him by Byron Howard (2000). The square includes the present base of the Hallé Orchestra, the Bridgewater Hall, in which the Barbirolli Room commemorates the conductor. At his old school, St Clement Danes, now relocated in Chorleywood, the main hall is named in his honour. A commemorative blue plaque was placed on the wall of the Bloomsbury Park Hotel in Southampton Row in May 1993 to mark Barbirolli&#x27;s birthplace. The Sir John Barbirolli Memorial Foundation of the Royal Philharmonic Society was instituted after his death to assist young musicians with the purchase of instruments. In 1972 the Barbirolli Society was set up with the principal aim of promoting the continued release of Barbirolli&#x27;s recorded performances. Its honorary officers have included Evelyn Barbirolli, Daniel Barenboim and Michael Kennedy. In April 2012, he was voted into the inaugural &quot;Gramophone&quot; &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;.

==Repertoire and recordings==

Barbirolli is remembered as an interpreter of Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Mahler, as well as Schubert, Beethoven, Sibelius, Verdi and Puccini, and as a staunch supporter of new works by British composers. Vaughan Williams dedicated his Eighth Symphony to Barbirolli, whose nickname, &quot;Glorious John&quot;, comes from the inscription Vaughan Williams wrote at the head of the score: &quot;For glorious John, with love and admiration from Ralph.&quot; Barbirolli did not disdain lighter repertoire. The music critic Richard Osborne wrote that, if all Barbirolli&#x27;s recordings were to be lost except that of Lehár&#x27;s &quot;Gold and Silver Waltz&quot;, &quot;there would be reason enough to say, &#x27;Now, &quot;there&quot; was a conductor!&#x27;&quot;

Barbirolli&#x27;s repertoire was not as wide as that of many of his colleagues because he insisted on exhaustive preparation for any work he conducted. His colleague Sir Adrian Boult liked and admired Barbirolli but teased him for his meticulousness: &quot;We can&#x27;t all be like you and spend months studying these things and then have days of rehearsals before we conduct them. For some of us they&#x27;re only sporting events.&quot; Barbirolli was shocked by such levity. His approach was illustrated by the care he took with Mahler&#x27;s symphonies. His biographer Michael Kennedy commented, &quot;it is ironical that the effort of composing the symphonies shortened Mahler&#x27;s life; interpreting them certainly put an enormous strain on Barbirolli in his last decade.&quot; He found that mastering a Mahler symphony took between 18 months and two years, and he would spend hours meticulously bowing all the string parts in preparation for his performances. His first performance of Mahler&#x27;s Ninth took nearly 50 hours of rehearsal.

===Pre-war===
From almost the start of his career Barbirolli was a frequent recording artist. As a young cellist he made four records for Edison Bell in 1911, with piano accompaniment by his sister Rosa, and as part of the Kutcher and the Music Society string quartets he recorded music by Mozart, Purcell, Vaughan Williams and others in 1925 and 1926. As a conductor he began recording in 1927 for the National Gramophonic Society (an offshoot of &quot;The Gramophone).&quot; Among his records from that period was the first to be made of Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Introduction and Allegro for Strings&quot;. On hearing it, the composer said, &quot;I&#x27;d never realised it was such a big work.&quot; Elgar, despite an extensive discography as a conductor, never recorded the work himself, and some have speculated that &quot;the breadth, nobility and lyrical poetry&quot; of Barbirolli&#x27;s interpretation left the composer disinclined to compete. In 1928 Barbirolli made some recordings for the Edison Bell label. The same year, he began his long association with the His Master&#x27;s Voice (HMV) label. Immediately after the LSO concert at which he had stood in for Beecham, he was approached by Fred Gaisberg, the chief recording producer for His Master&#x27;s Voice who signed him for his company shortly afterwards. An HMV colleague of Gaisberg described Barbirolli as &quot;a treasure&quot;, because he &quot;could accompany Chaliapin without provoking an uproar, win golden opinions from Jascha Heifetz, Artur Rubinstein, Fritz Kreisler and Pablo Casals, and conduct one of the finest recorded performances of the Quintet from &quot;Meistersinger&quot;&quot;.
Many of Barbirolli&#x27;s pre-war recordings for HMV were of concertos. His reputation as an accompanist tended to obscure his talents as a symphonic conductor, and later, his detractors in New York &quot;damned him with faint praise by exalting his powers as an accompanist and then implying that that was where it all stopped.&quot; Barbirolli became very sensitive on this point, and for many years after the war he was reluctant to accompany anyone in the recording studio. Among his early His Master&#x27;s Voice records are works, mainly concertos, by Brahms, Bruch, Chopin, Dvořák, Glazunov, Mendelssohn, Mozart, Schumann, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky and Vieuxtemps. From the 1990s onwards, archive recordings of Barbirolli&#x27;s early concerts in New York have been issued on CD. Kennedy wrote in 2004 that they &quot;prove that the orchestra played superbly for him and that the criticism of him was largely unjustified.&quot; Recordings from this period include symphonies by Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Mozart, Schubert, Schumann, Sibelius and Tchaikovsky, and other orchestral music by Berlioz, Debussy, Menotti, Purcell, Ravel, Respighi, and Rimsky-Korsakov.

===1943 and later===
Within six months of his return to Britain in 1943, Barbirolli resumed his contract with HMV, conducting the Hallé in the Third Symphony of Bax and the Fifth of Vaughan Williams, followed by works by a wide range of composers from Corelli to Stravinsky. In 1955 he signed a contract with Pye Records, with whom he and the Hallé recorded a wide repertoire, and made their first stereophonic recordings. These records were distributed in the US by Vanguard Records. A company was formed, named Pye-Barbirolli, of which he was a director: the arrangement was designed to ensure an equal partnership between the company and the musicians. They made many recordings, including symphonies by Beethoven, Dvořák, Elgar, Mozart, Nielsen, Sibelius, Mahler, Tchaikovsky and Vaughan Williams, as well as a few concertos, short orchestral pieces and operatic excerpts.

In 1962, HMV persuaded Barbirolli to return. With the Hallé he recorded a Sibelius symphony cycle, Elgar&#x27;s Second Symphony, &quot;Falstaff&quot; and &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;, Schubert&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;A London Symphony&quot;, and works by Grieg and Delius. With other orchestras, Barbirolli recorded a wide range of his repertoire, including many recordings still in the catalogues in 2025. Of these, his Elgar recordings include the Cello Concerto with Jacqueline du Pré, &quot;Sea Pictures&quot; with Janet Baker, and orchestral music including the First Symphony, &quot;Enigma Variations&quot; and many of the shorter works. His Mahler recordings include the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies (with the New Philharmonia) and Ninth Symphony (with the Berlin Philharmonic). With the Vienna Philharmonic, he recorded a Brahms symphony cycle, and with Daniel Barenboim, the two Brahms Piano Concertos. He made three operatic sets for HMV: Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; with Victoria de los Ángeles (1966), Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; with James McCracken, Gwyneth Jones and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau (1969), and a set of &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; with Renata Scotto, Carlo Bergonzi and Rome Opera forces that has remained in the catalogues since its first issue in 1967. The impact of the last was such that the head of the Rome Opera invited him to come and conduct &quot;any opera you care to name with as much rehearsal as you wish.&quot; HMV planned to record &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; with Barbirolli in Dresden in 1970, but following the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 he refused to conduct in the Soviet bloc, and his place was taken by Herbert von Karajan.

<text>Udinese Calcio (; &quot;Udinese Football&quot;) is a professional football club based in Udine, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy. The team currently competes in the Serie A, the first tier of Italian football. It was founded on 30 November 1896 as a sports club, and on 5 July 1911 as a football club.

The traditional team home kit is black and white striped shirt, black shorts, and white socks. The club broadcasts on channel 110 (Udinese Channel) on digital terrestrial television in the north-east of Italy. It has many fans in Friuli and the surrounding areas.

==History==

===Foundation and early years===
Udinese Calcio was established in 1896 as part of the &quot;Società Udinese di Ginnastica e Scherma&quot;, (Udinese Society of Gymnastics and Fencing). In its inaugural year, the club won the Torneo FNGI in Treviso beating Ferrara 2–0; however, this title is not recognised as official.

On 5 July 1911, some gymnasts of Udinese, headed by Luigi Dal Dan, founded the A.C. Udinese, which joined the FIGC. The new side made its debut in a friendly match against Juventus, and won 6–0.

It was only in 1912–13 that Udinese first took part in an official FIGC championship. In that year they enrolled in the &quot;Campionato Veneto di Promozione&quot;, which consisted of just three teams (the others were Petrarca and Padova). With two victories against Padova (3–1 and 5–0), Udinese finished the tournament in second place behind Petrarca and were promoted to first-level Prima Categoria. In Prima Categoria, Udinese failed to reach the national stage, always knocked out in the &quot;Eliminatoria Veneta&quot;.

===1920s: Coppa Italia final===
The 1920–21 season, which ended with the Friulani eliminated in the &quot;Eliminatoria Veneta&quot;, was memorable because it was the debut of Gino Bellotto, who is still the player who has played the most seasons with Udinese, spending 17 seasons with the &quot;Zebrette&quot;.

In 1922, Udinese, taking advantage of the absence of big clubs, entered the FIGC Italian Football Championship and reached the Coppa Italia final losing 1–0 against Vado, thanks to an overtime goal.

In the league, Udinese finished second in &quot;Girone Eliminatorio Veneto&quot;, which allowed them to remain in the top flight for the next season, despite a reform of the championships that reduced the number of teams in the competition.

The 1922–23 season was a disastrous one for Udinese, as they came last in and were relegated to the second division. The team risked failure for debts in 1923. On 24 August 1923, AS Udinese separated from AC Udinese Friuli, and the club was forced to set up a budget and an autonomous board. All debts were paid by President Alessandro Del Torso through the sale of some of his paintings and Udinese could thus join the Second Division in which they came fourth.

The 1924–25 season was memorable. The team was included in Group F II Division. The championship was very even and at the end of the tournament three teams were in contention to win: Udinese, Vicenza and Olympia River. Playoffs were needed to determine who would reach the final round.

Udinese beat Olympia in a playoff 1–0 and drew 1–1 with Vicenza. In the play-off standings, Udinese and Vicenza were still in the lead with 3 points each. Another play-off was then played to determine the winner. After a first encounter finished 0–0, Udinese lost a replay 2–1 but were awarded the win as Vicenza fielded an ineligible player, a Hungarian called Horwart. Udinese reached the finals in place of Vicenza.

In the final round, Udinese finished first and was promoted, alongside Parma, to First Division. In the following season, Udinese finished 10th and was relegated again. However, the format of the championship was again reformed and Udinese had another chance to reclaim their place in the top flight. They competed in play-offs with seven other sides for the right to play in Serie A. The winner would remain in the top flight. The club, however, lost the playoff against Legnano and lost their place in the top flight.

They remained in Second Division until the end of the 1928–29 season when Serie A and Serie B were created, with Udinese falling into the third tier (Terza Serie). The first season in Terza Serie was a triumphant one and Udinese were promoted up to Serie B.

The stay in Serie B lasted only two years, and after the 1931–32 season, the team returned to the third division. Udinese remained in the third tier (later renamed Serie C in 1935) until 1938–39, when coming second in Girone Finale Nord di Serie C, they were promoted to Serie B.

The Zebrette remained in Serie B for a dozen years, with average performances and were relegated to Serie C at the end of the 1947–48 season due to a reform of the championships. This relegation, however, was followed by two consecutive promotions, and thanks to an excellent second-place finish in the Serie B 1949-50, the Friulani won a historic promotion to Serie A.

===1950s: second place in A, and relegation back to B===
Udinese remained in Serie A for five seasons and almost claimed an historic Scudetto in the 1954–55 season, when they came second only behind Milan. It was after that season, however, that Udinese was relegated because of an offence committed on 31 May 1953, the last day of the championship, which was exposed two years later. The Friuliani returned to Serie A after one season in B and in the following season was confirmed among the best Italian teams with an excellent fourth-place finish.

===1960s and 1970s===
A decline followed those good seasons, however, with Udinese first relegated back down to Serie B in 1961–62 and then to Serie C in 1963–64. Udinese remained in C for about fifteen years, missing promotion back to B on numerous occasions. It was only after the 1977–78 season that the Friuliani, led by manager Massimo Giacomini, returned to B winning Girone A. In the same season, they won the &quot;Coppa Italia Semiprofessionisti&quot;, beating Reggina and also won the Anglo-Italian Cup.

===1980s: Mitropa Cup and the scandal of 1986===
During the next season, Udinese with Massimo Giacomini as their manager, won Serie B and returned after more than two decades to Serie A. In their first year back after so long, the team survived after a disappointing 15th-place finish. In Europe, they fared much better, winning the Mitropa Cup, a European Cup for teams that had won the previous season of Serie B.

In subsequent seasons the team managed to survive relegation without any particular difficulty also managing an impressive sixth place in 1982–83. At that time Udinese had on its books one of the club&#x27;s all-time greatest players, the Brazilian midfielder Zico.

At the end of the 1985–86 season, the team was embroiled in a betting scandal and was penalised nine points for the 1986–87 season. Despite a desperate comeback towards the end of the season, Udinese were relegated to Serie B. Had they not been deducted points, Udinese would have survived.

===1990s and early 2000s: Europe===

During the following years, Udinese were promoted to Serie A and relegated back to B on several occasions. This situation lasted until the 1995–96 season, from which point on, they established themselves in Serie A.

The 1996–97 season saw Udinese qualify for the UEFA Cup, with Alberto Zaccheroni as manager. The following season, they managed a third-place finish behind Juventus and Internazionale, largely thanks to Oliver Bierhoff&#x27;s 27 goals.

In March 2001, Luciano Spalletti was appointed manager, replacing Luigi De Canio. Spalletti managed to lead the team to survival on the penultimate matchday. Following brief periods with Roy Hodgson and Giampiero Ventura on the bench, Spalletti was again appointed manager of Udinese at the beginning of the 2002–03 season, finding an organised and ambitious club which again reached the UEFA Cup, playing attacking and entertaining football.

The surprising fourth-place finish at the end of the 2004–05 season saw Udinese achieve their first qualification for the UEFA Champions League in the history of the club. At the end of that same season, Spalletti announced his intention to leave Udinese.

The following season, Udinese played in the Champions League preliminary round, beating Sporting CP 4–2 on aggregate. Udinese were drawn in a tough group alongside Panathinaikos, Werder Bremen and Barcelona.

 Despite a 3–0 win over Panathinaikos in their first match, courtesy of a Vincenzo Iaquinta hat trick, the team failed to qualify for the knockout rounds, coming in third in their group, equal on points with second placed Werder and behind eventual champions Barcelona.

===Recent history===
After a year in the Champions League, Udinese finished tenth and returned once more to mid-table mediocrity. The turning point occurred during the summer of 2007, when the club announced the appointment of Sicilian manager Pasquale Marino and also made various quality purchases including Fabio Quagliarella and Gökhan Inler.
The 2007–08 season started well with a draw at home against champions Internazionale, but the enthusiasm was quickly erased after the first home match which finished in a 5–0 loss to newly promoted Napoli. After this match, Udinese&#x27;s fortunes changed, starting with a victory over Juventus thanks to a late Antonio Di Natale goal. Udinese remained in contention for the fourth Champions League spot with Milan, Fiorentina, and Sampdoria until the end of the season, but ultimately finished in seventh place, qualifying for the UEFA Cup.

At the start of the 2008–09 season, during the press conference to present the new season&#x27;s kit, the new official website was also presented, and an absolute novelty in the Italian championship, the first Web TV channel dedicated to a football club called Udinese Channel was launched, totally free and visible worldwide.

In the 2008–09 season, Udinese had a mixed bag of results in Serie A with a 3–1 win at Roma and a 2–1 win over Juventus, but 10 losses against teams including Reggina, Chievo, and Torino dented their hopes of Champions League qualification. In the UEFA Cup, Udinese found themselves in a group with potential favourites Tottenham Hotspur, NEC, Spartak Moscow, and Dinamo Zagreb, but eased through the group with a convincing 2–0 win against Tottenham. They beat Lech Poznań in the next round 4–3 on aggregate, and then beat holders Zenit Saint Petersburg 2–1 on aggregate. In the quarter-final against Werder Bremen, with injuries to star players Antonio Di Natale, Samir Handanovič, and Felipe, they lost 6–4 on aggregate. Fabio Quagliarella managed eight goals in the campaign. They finished the season in seventh place, missing out on any European football the following year.

The 2009–10 season was an extremely disappointing one for players and fans alike. Even though Antonio Di Natale managed to score 29 goals in the league and finished top goalscorer, the season was spent battling against relegation. In the end, they finished in 15th, nine points and three places clear of the relegation zone. The only highlight of the campaign was reaching the semi-final of the Coppa Italia, beating Lumezzane in the round of 16, Milan in the quarter-finals, and eventually losing 2–1 to Roma on aggregate.

In the summer transfer window of 2010, Udinese sold Gaetano D&#x27;Agostino, Simone Pepe, Marco Motta, and Aleksandar Luković. They also brought in players that proved to be the key to their success in the 2010–11 Serie A; Mehdi Benatia and Pablo Armero, a central defender and wingback, respectively. After a poor start to the season, losing their first four games and drawing the fifth, Udinese went on to record their highest points total in history and finished in fourth place, again earning themselves a spot in the Champions League qualifying round. Di Natale, with 28 goals, became the first back-to-back &quot;capocannoniere&quot; since Lazio&#x27;s Giuseppe Signori accomplished the feat in 1993 and 1994. A 0–0 home draw with Milan on the final matchday secured the Champions League spot for Udinese. Coach Francesco Guidolin kept his promise of &quot;dancing like Boateng&quot; if they qualified for the Champions League and did a little jig in the middle of the pitch. In the Coppa Italia, Udinese lost to Sampdoria in the round of 16 on penalties after the match ended 2–2.

The 2011–12 season continued in much the same fashion, even though Udinese lost three key players to larger clubs – Alexis Sánchez to Barcelona, Gökhan Inler to Napoli, and Cristián Zapata to Villarreal. In the Champions League qualifying round, Udinese were drawn against Arsenal and lost the away leg 1–0. At the Stadio Friuli, Udinese lost 2–1, 3–1 on aggregate, and entered the Europa League group stage, Antonio Di Natale missing a penalty that at the time would have taken Udinese through. Domestically, Udinese started strong but with their quality shown in defence, conceding the least of all teams after 15 games, only seven. For the second consecutive season, Udinese qualified for the Champions League, clinching third place on the final day of the season with a 2–0 away win against Catania. In the summer transfer window, key players Kwadwo Asamoah and Mauricio Isla were both sold to champions Juventus. The club failed to reach the group stage of the year&#x27;s Champions League, however, losing on penalties after extra time to Portuguese club SC Braga. Antonio Di Natale scored 23 goals to record his third consecutive season with 20+ goals in Serie A.

Udinese started off the 2012–13 Serie A season in mixed form, with seven draws and three losses in their first thirteen games. However, starting in December the team began to pick up wins more frequently, concurrent with Di Natale finding the net on a regular basis. After a period of balancing wins with losses, the team went on a phenomenal eight game winning streak to end the season, with Luis Muriel emerging as a key player. Like the 2011–12 season, Di Natale again finished with 23 goals, becoming the first player since Gabriel Batistuta, of Fiorentina, to score 20 or more goals in four or more consecutive seasons.

Over the coming years, Udinese would go on to finish middle to lower table in Serie A. In the 2017–18 season, Udinese manager Massimo Oddo was sacked after the club lost 11 straight games. Oddo was then replaced by Igor Tudor who guided the club to safety away from the relegation places.

== Colors and symbols ==

=== Colors ===
The official colors of Udinese are white and black, the same as the municipal coat of arms, these have been present in the team&#x27;s kit since its beginnings, although their use has often varied between different styles. At the end of the 19th century, the newly formed &quot;Società Udinese di Ginnastica e Scherma&quot; wore a completely black shirt, adorned only with a white five-pointed star pinned to the center of the chest.

In the 1910s, the shirt was split vertically in half between the two colors, later, white became the dominant color, with black relegated to decorations. Since the 1930s the typical black and white striped shirt has been almost permanently used, often accompanied by black shorts and socks, or by white shorts and black socks.

The only significant innovations came in the 1980s when the Friulian team&#x27;s clothing diverged from tradition, presenting more imaginative solutions: notably, the white shirts with a black central bar used in the first part of the decade, followed by black shirts with a massive white stripe across them. From the 1990s onwards, there was a gradual return to simplicity, although experiments like &quot;curved&quot; stripes along the upper edge were made in the mid-2000s.

As for away uniforms, these do not follow fixed patterns except for the solid color, with the club changing colors every year, using blue, yellow, orange, sky blue, pink, and even the same black and white as the home kit.

Crest

Throughout its history, Udinese has used numerous crests that share the colors and heraldry of the Friulian city. In a photo taken around 1896, likely during an FGNI Tournament, the city coat of arms appears on the chest, with a white star on a black shirt. However, there is not enough information to confirm if this was used officially or continuously over the years. Indeed, in later photos from the early 20th century, no emblem appears on the shirts.

The first official emblems date back to the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, but since they were not depicted on the shirts, it is difficult to determine the exact period. All these emblems depicted a shield filled with black and white vertical stripes, first with the inscription &quot;AC Udinese&quot; and later with the &quot;ACU&quot; (Associazione Calcistica Udinese) monogram. The first emblem visible on the shirt appeared in 1979, depicting a zebra inside a green circle. The second symbol, introduced in the early 1980s under President Lamberto Mazza, featured a white shield enclosing a black chevron — the same design that represents the city of Udine — with the &quot;Z&quot; logo of Zanussi (the company that owned the club at the time) below it and the lowercase inscription &quot;udinese calcio&quot;. Despite this being the official emblem, for the 1981-1982 season, the shirts displayed only the large &quot;Z&quot; on the chest.

The third emblem was a variation of the second one: after Zanussi&#x27;s departure, following the club&#x27;s acquisition by Giampaolo Pozzo, the &quot;Z&quot; was removed, and only the shield with the city&#x27;s emblem remained. Then, between 1992 and 1995, the club introduced a circular emblem for the first time, with the city’s coat of arms in the center, surrounded by a gray circle.

Finally, in the 1995-1996 season, the emblem currently in use made its debut: a shield surrounded by a circle, first gray, then black, and from the 2010-2011 season, gray again, with two laurel branches wrapped around it.

Fans have repeatedly requested that the Friulian eagle should be added to the black and white shirts, but the club has never accepted this request, partly due to existing regulations. In 2008, the club&#x27;s decision to include the emblem of Friuli-Venezia Giulia on the shirts was strongly contested by fans, as it was perceived as the emblem of rival Trieste rather than representing only Friuli.

Anthem

The club&#x27;s official anthem is &quot;Vinci per noi&quot; (Win for Us), performed by singer Connie Del Colle. The song is played before every home game at the Stadio Friuli.

Previously, the anthem was &quot;Alè Udin,&quot; performed by Dario Zampa. Its chorus became a distinctive chant of the Friulian fans.

<doc id="149880" wikidata="Q1503293" url="?curid=149880" title="Jerry Cornelius">
<text>Jerry Cornelius is a fictional character created by English author Michael Moorcock. The character is an urban adventurer and an incarnation of the author&#x27;s Eternal Champion concept. Cornelius is a hipster of ambiguous and occasionally polymorphous gender. Many of the same characters feature in each of several Cornelius books, though the individual books have little connection with one another, having a more metafictional than causal relationship. The first Jerry Cornelius book, &quot;The Final Programme&quot;, was made into a 1973 film starring Jon Finch and Jenny Runacre. Notting Hill in London features prominently in the stories.

==Overview==
The series draws plot elements from Moorcock&#x27;s Elric series, as well as the &quot;Commedia dell&#x27;Arte&quot;. Moorcock hints in many places that Cornelius may be an aspect of the Eternal Champion. Characters from the Cornelius novels show up in much of Moorcock&#x27;s other fiction: &quot;The Dancers at the End of Time&quot; series has a character called Jherek Carnelian who is the son of Lord Jagged of Canaria, and there are several hints in the series that Lord Jagged may be a guise of Jerry Cornelius; the Cornelius-series character Una Persson also appears in the &quot;Dancers&quot; series and the Oswald Bastable books, and may also be the character &quot;Oona&quot; in the later Elric books; Colonel Pyat has his own non-SF series of books by Moorcock, beginning with &quot;Byzantium Endures&quot;.

At least five other variants of the name occur in other Moorcock works (Jerry Cornell, Jehamiah Cohnalias, Jhary-a-Conel (Corum, Runestaff), Lord Jagged of Canaria from &quot;The Dancers at the End of Time&quot;, and the anagrammatic Corum Jhaelen Irsei). A space pirate named Captain Cornelius (who like Jerry is associated with the &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; character Pierrot) appears in Moorcock&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel, &quot;The Coming of the Terraphiles&quot;.

=== The Cornelius Quartet ===
In these four novels Jerry undergoes transformations, dies, is reborn, spends one entire novel as a shivering wreck, and eventually discovers his true natures. Moorcock strenuously objects to his character being depicted as a &#x27;secret agent&#x27;. There are almost no elements of the spy genre in the Cornelius stories.

* &quot;The Final Programme&quot;
: Jerry battles his brother Frank who has kidnapped his beloved sister Catherine. Frank dies, but Catherine is also killed. Jerry is sucked into the plans of Miss Brunner to create the perfect being by merging the bodies of Jerry and herself together. When this is done, a radiantly charismatic hermaphroditic being emerges from the machinery. All who see the new creature fall quaking to their knees. The creature itself announces that this is &quot;a very tasty world&quot;.
* &quot;A Cure for Cancer&quot;
: Jerry is solo again, existing as negative character with black skin and white hair. He moves through a landscape of destroyed English cities and occupying American armies, a metaphor for contemporary Vietnam. He runs a clandestine &quot;transmogrification&quot; service for people who want to cast off their old selves, flesh and all. There is the gluttonous Bishop Beesley, and his daughter Mitzi. Eventually Jerry drives the Americans to madness, causing them to burn everything, including themselves.
* &quot;The English Assassin&quot;
: All the supporting characters, particularly Una Persson, drive this novel while Jerry is nothing more than a whimpering heap of rags washed up on a beach and carried in the back of a lorry to safety. There are episodes in settings ranging from the cockpit of a Dornier Do X, the deck of an Edwardian sailing ship, the anarchic steppes of revolutionary Russia, and Victorian music-hall. Finally Jerry is able to revive as the character Pierrot, forever mourning his lost Columbine, who is Catherine.
* &quot;The Condition of Muzak&quot;
: Taking its title from the Walter Pater quote &quot;All art constantly aspires towards the condition of music&quot;, this is a series of vignettes that cast Jerry as a teenager in Notting Hill, a character in the &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;, a secret agent and a fool. Particularly notable are the Notting Hill scenes, which seem to reduce all the other parts of the canon to fantasies in the adolescent Jerry&#x27;s mind. Other scenes fill in detail, if any were needed, between the novels. In the final scene Jerry&#x27;s foul-mouthed mother dies, and on her deathbed she reveals the family&#x27;s history as a distorted version of the canon which Jerry and his now-pregnant sister Catherine seem doomed to continue.

== Main characters ==
* Jerry Cornelius, secret agent, superhero, adventurer, all things to all men (and women). A figure of almost complete anarchy. Typically destroys repressive authority. Later he is exposed as a false Harlequin, a tragic Pierrot at heart, or simply an adolescent fantasy.
* Miss Brunner, Jerry&#x27;s opposite, representing stifling authority, also follows a more mystical path than Jerry&#x27;s fatalistic realism.
* Bishop Beesley, endlessly corrupt gluttonous villain. He thirsts for power, money and pleasure.
* Una Persson, a female version of Jerry, even to the extent of being Catherine&#x27;s lover. In &quot;The Condition of Muzak&quot; she is revealed to be a true Harlequin.
* Catherine Cornelius, Jerry&#x27;s sister and incestuous lover. Usually dies tragically. She is often pregnant by Jerry. In some stories, she is a masochistic figure.
* Major Nye, a retired British Army officer, participant in secret missions, and Una Persson&#x27;s sometime lover.
* Colonel Pyat, a Russian emigre officer, also a sometime lover of Una Persson.
* Cornelius Brunner, proclaimed &quot;Messiah of the Age of Science&quot;, a hermaphrodite amalgam of Jerry Cornelius and Miss Brunner in &quot;The Final Programme&quot;.
* Professor Hira, occasionally another of Jerry&#x27;s lovers. Hira is counterpart to Jerry&#x27;s character, always calm and in control.
* Frank Cornelius, Jerry&#x27;s scheming brother, Cain to Jerry&#x27;s Abel. Usually killed by Jerry, but always returns.
* Mrs. Cornelius is fat, libidinous, foul-mouthed mother to Frank, Jerry and Catherine. She is the quintessential urban survivor and a modern Mother Courage.
* &#x27;Shaky&#x27; Mo Collier, a companion on many adventures, and also supplier of many and varied drugs to almost everyone. He almost acts as Jerry&#x27;s right-hand man always there when needed, although somewhat unreliable in execution of tasks. The character was created by M. John Harrison, rather than Moorcock.

== Work inspired by Jerry Cornelius ==
Moorcock encouraged other authors and artists to create works about Jerry Cornelius, in an early open source shared world attempt at open brand sharing. One example is Norman Spinrad&#x27;s &quot;The Last Hurrah of the Golden Horde&quot;. Another is Mœbius&#x27;s &quot;The Airtight Garage&quot;. &quot;The Nature of the Catastrophe&quot;, a collection of Jerry Cornelius stories and comic strips which had appeared in &quot;New Worlds&quot; (with art by Mal Dean) by various hands, was published in 1971. It includes works by Moorcock himself, James Sallis, Brian Aldiss, Langdon Jones, M. John Harrison, Richard Glyn Jones, Alex Krislov, and Maxim Jakubowski.

The story &quot;...the price is worth it&quot; by Graeme K Talboys and the subsequent novels in the &quot;Stormlight&quot; quartet (along with the short story collection &quot;Stormwrack&quot;) are centred on Charlie Cornelius, a daughter of the Cornelius clan with uncertain parentage.

In comics, various writers have used elements of the character, including Bryan Talbot&#x27;s character Luther Arkwright. Image publishes Matt Fraction&#x27;s &quot;Casanova&quot; series which also pays homage to Cornelius. Tony Lee&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Kiss&quot; features Cornelius with Michael Moorcock&#x27;s blessing. (Moorcock wrote the introduction for the collected trade paperback). Grant Morrison created an Oscar Wilde-inspired steampunk version of Jerry Cornelius in &quot;Sebastian O&quot;, the original Vertigo mini-series. Another Morrison character, Gideon Stargrave of &quot;The Invisibles&quot;, is one of the few interpretations of the character that Moorcock has issues with, as he considers the character little more than a straight lift of Cornelius.

The name of the protagonist of Mœbius&#x27;s &quot;The Airtight Garage&quot; was changed in later editions to &quot;Lewis Carnelian&quot;. In 2006, on his website, Moorcock wrote:
&quot;Bad Voltage&quot;, a 1980s cyberpunk novel by Jonathan Littell that also dealt with themes of bisexuality and violence, features guest appearances by a has-been Jerry Cornelius and a substance-abusing &#x27;Shaky&#x27; Mo Collier. The independent comic &quot;Man-Elf&quot; featured not only Cornelius but members of his supporting cast in an homage. Cornelius is also seen in Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier&quot; as a child. Cornelius appears in the second part of Alan Moore&#x27;s three-part comic &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume III: Century&quot;. The character also appears in &quot;Neurotwistin&quot;&#x27;, a French novel by Laurent Queyssi (an appearance sanctioned by Moorcock). The 1996 White Wolf anthology &quot;Pawn of CHAOS&quot; features new Cornelius stories by John Shirley, Caitlín R. Kiernan, and Nancy Collins. A version of Jerry Cornelius also appears in Michael Moorcock&#x27;s 1999 graphic novel &quot;Multiverse&quot;. An ongoing presentation of new Cornelius stories is on Moorcock&#x27;s Jeremiah Cornelius Facebook page.

Carter Kaplan plays a variation on Jerry Cornelius in his novel &quot;Tally-Ho, Cornelius!&quot;.

Author Bruce Sterling has described his recurring character Leggy Starlitz, star of a series of short stories and the novel &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;, as &quot;a nonlinear descendant of Moorcock&#x27;s Jerry Cornelius&quot;.

<text>The medical uses of silver include its use in wound dressings, creams, and as an antibiotic coating on medical devices. Wound dressings containing silver sulfadiazine or silver nanomaterials may be used to treat external infections. The limited evidence available shows that silver coatings on endotracheal breathing tubes may reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. There is tentative evidence that using silver-alloy indwelling catheters for short-term catheterizing will reduce the risk of catheter-acquired urinary tract infections.
Silver generally has low toxicity, and minimal risk is expected when silver is used in approved medical applications. Alternative medicine products such as colloidal silver are controversial.

==Mechanism of action==
Silver and most silver compounds have an oligodynamic effect and are toxic for bacteria, algae, and fungi &quot;in vitro&quot;. The antibacterial action of silver is dependent on the silver ion. The effectiveness of silver compounds as an antiseptic is based on the ability of the biologically active silver ion () to irreversibly damage key enzyme systems in the cell membranes of pathogens. The antibacterial action of silver has long been known to be enhanced by the presence of an electric field. Applying an electric current across silver electrodes enhances antibiotic action at the anode, likely due to the release of silver into the bacterial culture. The antibacterial action of electrodes coated with silver nanostructures is greatly improved in the presence of an electric field.

Silver, used as a topical antiseptic, is incorporated by bacteria it kills. Thus dead bacteria may be the source of silver that may kill additional bacteria.

==Medical uses==

===Antibacterial cream===
Silver sulfadiazine (SSD) is a topical antibiotic used in partial thickness and full thickness burns to prevent infection. It was discovered in the 1960s, and was the standard topical antimicrobial for burn wounds for decades.

However systemic reviews in 2014, 2017 and 2018 concluded that more modern treatments, both with and without silver, show better results for wound healing and infection-prevention than silver sulfadiazine, and therefore SSD is no longer generally recommended.

It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a number of topical preparations of silver sulfadiazine for treatment of second-degree and third-degree burns.

===Dressings===
Despite its widespread use, there is only mixed evidence that silver in dressings has any benefit. A 2018 Cochrane review found that silver-containing dressings may increase the probability of healing for venous leg ulcers.

A number of wound dressings containing silver as an anti-bacterial have been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, silver-containing dressings may cause staining, and in some cases tingling sensations as well.

===Endotracheal tubes===
A 2015 systematic review concluded that the limited evidence available indicates that using silver-coated endotracheal breathing tubes reduces the risk of contracting ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), especially during the initial days of utilisation. A 2014 study concluded that using silver-coated endotracheal tubes will help to prevent VAP and that this may save on hospital costs. A 2012 systematic review of randomized controlled trials concluded that the limited evidence available indicates that using silver-coated endotracheal tubes will reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, microbiologic burden, and device-related adverse events among adult patients. Another 2012 review agreed that the use of silver-coated endotracheal tubes reduces the prevalence of VAP in intubated patients, but cautioned that this on its own is not sufficient to prevent infection. They also suggested that more research is needed to establish the cost-effectiveness of the treatment. Another 2012 study agreed that there is evidence that endotracheal tubes coated with silver may reduce the incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) and delay its onset, but concluded that no benefit was seen in the duration of intubation, the duration of stay in intensive care or the mortality rate. They also raised concerns surrounding the unblinded nature of some of the studies then available.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2007 cleared an endotracheal tube with a fine coat of silver to reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

===Catheters===
A 2014 systemic review concluded that using silver alloy-coated catheters showed no significant difference in incidences of symptomatic Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections (CAUTI) versus using standard catheters, although silver-alloy catheters seemed to cause less discomfort to patients. These catheters are associated with greater cost than other catheters. A 2014 Multicenter Cohort Study found that using a silver-alloy hydrogel urinary catheter did reduce symptomatic Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI) occurrences as defined by both NHSN and clinical criteria. A 2011 critical analysis of eight studies found a consistent pattern which supported using silver-alloy urinary catheters over uncoated catheters to reduce infections in adult patients, and concluded that using silver-alloy catheters would significantly improve patient care. A 2007 systemic review concluded that using silver-alloy indwelling catheters for short-term catheterizing will reduce the risk of catheter-acquired urinary tract infection, but called for further studies to evaluate the economic benefits of using the expensive silver alloy-catheters. Two systemic reviews in 2004 found that using silver-alloy catheters reduced asymptomatic and symptomatic bacteriuria more than standard catheters, for patients who were catheterised for a short time. A 2000 randomized crossover study found that using the more expensive silver-coated catheter may result in cost savings by preventing nosocomial UTI infections, and another 2000 study found that using silver alloy catheters for short-term urinary catheterization reduces the incidence of symptomatic UTI and bacteremia compared with standard catheters, and may thus yield cost savings.

A 2017 study found that a combination of chlorhexidine and silver-sulfadiazine (CSS) used to coat central venous catheters (CVC) reduces the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections. However, they also found that the efficacy of the CSS-CVC coating was progressively eroded by blood-flow, and that the antibacterial function was lost after 48 hours.

===Conjugations with existing drugs===
Research in 2018 into the treatment of central nervous system infections caused by free-living amoebae such as &quot;Naegleria fowleri&quot; and &quot;Acanthamoeba castellanii&quot;, tested the effectiveness of existing drugs as well as the effectiveness of the same drugs when they were conjugated with silver nanoparticles. In vitro tests demonstrated more potent amoebicidal effects for the drugs when conjugated with silver nanoparticles as compared to the same drugs when used alone. They also found that conjugating the drugs with silver nanoparticles enhanced their anti-acanthamoebic activity.

===X-ray film===
Silver-halide imaging plates used with X-ray imaging were the standard before digital techniques arrived; these function essentially the same as other silver-halide photographic films, although for x-ray use the developing process is very simple and takes only a few minutes. Silver x-ray film remains popular for its accuracy, and cost effectiveness, particularly in developing countries, where digital X-ray technology is usually not available.

===Other uses===
Silver compounds have been used in external preparations as antiseptics, including both silver nitrate and silver proteinate. Before the development of antibiotics, Credé&#x27;s prophylaxis used a 2% solution of silver nitrate to prevent neonatal conjunctivitis, which used to account for half of all cases of blindness in Europe. The original procedure called for a 2% silver nitrate solution administered immediately after birth, as Credé erroneously believed that a 1% solution was ineffective due to a previous study by Hecker; however, this was eventually corrected and reduced back down to a 1% solution to reduce chemical irritation to the newborn&#x27;s eyes.
Silver nitrate is also sometimes used in dermatology in solid stick form as a caustic (&quot;lunar caustic&quot;) to treat certain skin conditions, such as corns and warts.

Silver nitrate is also used in certain laboratory procedures to stain cells. As it turns them permanently a dark-purple/black color, in doing so increasing individual cells&#x27; visibility under a microscope and allowing for differentiation between cells, or identification of irregularities. 
Silver is also used in bone prostheses and cardiac devices. In reconstructive hip and knee surgery, silver-coated titanium prostheses are indicated in cases of recalcitrant prosthetic joint infections. Silver diammine fluoride appears to be an effective intervention to reduce dental caries (tooth decay). Silver is also a component in dental amalgam.

Silver acetate has been used as a potential aid to help stop smoking; a review of the literature in 2012, however, found no effect of silver acetate on smoking cessation at a six-month endpoint and if there is an effect it would be small. Silver has also been used in cosmetics, intended to enhance antimicrobial effects and the preservation of ingredients.

==Adverse effects==

Though toxicity of silver is low, the human body has no biological use for silver and when inhaled, ingested, injected, or applied topically, silver can accumulate irreversibly in the body, particularly in the skin, and chronic use combined with exposure to sunlight can result in a disfiguring condition known as argyria in which the skin becomes blue or blue-gray. Localized argyria can occur as a result of topical use of silver-containing creams and solutions, while the ingestion, inhalation, or injection can result in generalized argyria. Preliminary reports of treatment with laser therapy have been reported. These laser treatments are painful and general anesthesia is required. A similar laser treatment has been used to clear silver particles from the eye, a condition related to argyria called argyrosis. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) describes argyria as a &quot;cosmetic problem&quot;.

One incident of argyria came to the public&#x27;s attention in 2008, when a man named Paul Karason, whose skin turned blue from using colloidal silver for over 10 years to treat dermatitis, appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show. Karason died in 2013 at the age of 62 after a heart attack. Another example is Montana politician Stan Jones whose purposeful consumption of colloidal silver was a self-prescribed measure he undertook in response to his fears that the Y2K problem would make antibiotics unavailable, an event that did not occur.

Colloidal silver may interact with some prescription medications, reducing the absorption of some antibiotics and thyroxine, among others.

Some people are allergic to silver, and the use of treatments and medical devices containing silver is contraindicated for such people. Although medical devices containing silver are widely used in hospitals, no thorough testing and standardization of these products has yet been undertaken.

==Water purification==
Electrolytically dissolved silver has been used as a water disinfecting agent, for example, the drinking water supplies of the Russian Mir orbital station and the International Space Station. Many modern hospitals filter hot water through copper-silver filters to defeat MRSA and legionella infections. The World Health Organization (WHO) includes silver in a colloidal state produced by electrolysis of silver electrodes in water, and colloidal silver in water filters as two of a number of water disinfection methods specified to provide safe drinking water in developing countries. Along these lines, a ceramic filtration system coated with silver particles has been created by Ron Rivera of Potters for Peace and used in developing countries for water disinfection (in this application the silver inhibits microbial growth on the filter substrate, to prevent clogging, and does not directly disinfect the filtered water).

== Alternative medicine ==
Colloidal silver (a colloid consisting of silver particles suspended in liquid) and formulations containing silver salts were used by physicians in the early 20th century, but their use was largely discontinued in the 1940s following the development of modern antibiotics. Since about 1990, there has been a resurgence of the promotion of colloidal silver as a dietary supplement, marketed with claims of it being an essential mineral supplement, or that it can prevent or treat numerous diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, arthritis, HIV/AIDS, herpes, and tuberculosis. No medical evidence supports the effectiveness of colloidal silver for any of these claimed indications. Silver is not an essential mineral in humans; there is no dietary requirement for silver, and hence, no such thing as a silver &quot;deficiency&quot;. There is no evidence that colloidal silver treats or prevents any medical condition, and it can cause serious and potentially irreversible side effects, such as argyria.

In August 1999, the U.S. FDA banned colloidal silver sellers from claiming any therapeutic or preventive value for the product, although silver-containing products continue to be promoted as dietary supplements in the U.S. under the looser regulatory standards applied to supplements. The FDA has issued numerous warning letters to Internet sites that have continued to promote colloidal silver as an antibiotic or for other medical purposes. Despite the efforts of the FDA, silver products remain widely available on the market today. A review of websites promoting nasal sprays containing colloidal silver suggested that information about silver-containing nasal sprays on the Internet is misleading and inaccurate. Colloidal silver is also sold in some topical cosmetics, as well as some toothpastes, which are regulated by the FDA as cosmetics (other than drug ingredients making medical claims).

In 2002, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) found there were no legitimate medical uses for colloidal silver and no evidence to support its marketing claims. The U.S. National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) warns that marketing claims about colloidal silver are scientifically unsupported, that the silver content of marketed supplements varies widely, and that colloidal silver products can have serious side effects such as argyria.
In 2009, the USFDA issued a consumer advisory warning about the potential adverse effects of colloidal silver, and said that &quot;there are no legally marketed prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) drugs containing silver that are taken by mouth&quot;. Quackwatch states that colloidal silver dietary supplements have not been found safe or effective for the treatment of any condition. &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; lists colloidal silver as a &quot;supplement to avoid&quot;, describing it as &quot;likely unsafe&quot;. &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; stated that &quot;colloidal silver as a cure-all is a fraud with a long history, with quacks claiming it could cure cancer, AIDS, tuberculosis, diabetes, and numerous other diseases&quot;.

It may be illegal to market as preventing or treating cancer, and in some jurisdictions illegal to sell colloidal silver for consumption. In 2015 an English man was prosecuted and found guilty under the Cancer Act 1939 for selling colloidal silver with claims it could treat cancer.

===Fraudulent products marketed during the COVID-19 outbreak===

The US Food and Drug Administration has issued warning letters to firms including colloidal silver marketers for selling products with false and misleading claims to prevent, treat, mitigate, diagnose or cure coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

In 2020, televangelist felon Jim Bakker was sued by the Missouri Attorney General (AG) for marketing colloidal silver products and making false claims about their effectiveness against COVID-19. The Attorney General of New York sent a cease and desist order to Bakker and others about peddling the unproven products that was compared to selling &quot;snake oil&quot;, and the Food and Drug Administration also warned Bakker about his actions.

Controversial web show host, podcaster and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was also warned by the New York Attorney General&#x27;s office to stop marketing his colloidal silver infused products (toothpaste, mouthwash, dietary supplements, etc.) because he made unproven claims of its ability to fend off COVID-19.

==History==
Hippocrates in his writings discussed the use of silver in wound care. At the beginning of the twentieth century surgeons routinely used silver sutures to reduce the risk of infection. In the early 20th century, physicians used silver-containing eyedrops to treat ophthalmic problems, for various infections, and sometimes internally for diseases such as tropical sprue, epilepsy, gonorrhea, and the common cold. During World War I, soldiers used silver leaf to treat infected wounds.

In the 1840s, founder of gynecology J. Marion Sims employed silver wire, which he had a jeweler fashion, as a suture in gynecological surgery. This produced very favorable results when compared with its predecessors, silk and catgut.

Prior to the introduction of modern antibiotics, colloidal silver was used as a germicide and disinfectant. With the development of modern antibiotics in the 1940s, the use of silver as an antimicrobial agent diminished, although it retains some use in medicinal compounds today. Silver sulfadiazine (SSD) is a compound containing silver and the antibiotic sodium sulfadiazine, which was developed in 1968.

The National Health Services in the UK spent about £25 million on silver-containing dressings in 2006. Silver-containing dressings represent about 14% of the total dressings used and about 25% of the overall wound dressing costs.

Concerns have been expressed about the potential environmental cost of manufactured silver nanomaterials in consumer applications being released into the environment, for example that they may pose a threat to benign soil organisms.

<doc id="149882" wikidata="Q186748" url="?curid=149882" title="Dante Gabriel Rossetti">
<text>Gabriel Charles Dante Rossetti (12 May 1828 – 9 April 1882), generally known as Dante Gabriel Rossetti ( ; ), was an English poet, illustrator, painter, translator, and member of the Rossetti family. He founded the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in 1848 with William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais. Rossetti inspired the next generation of artists and writers, William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones in particular. His work also influenced the European Symbolists and was a major precursor of the Aesthetic movement.

Rossetti&#x27;s art was characterised by its sensuality and its medieval revivalism. His early poetry was influenced by John Keats and William Blake. His later poetry was characterised by the complex interlinking of thought and feeling, especially in his sonnet sequence &quot;The House of Life&quot;. Poetry and image are closely entwined in Rossetti&#x27;s work. He frequently wrote sonnets to accompany his pictures, spanning from &quot;The Girlhood of Mary Virgin&quot; (1849) and &quot;Astarte Syriaca&quot; (1877), while also creating art to illustrate poems such as &quot;Goblin Market&quot; by the poet Christina Rossetti, his sister.

Rossetti&#x27;s personal life was closely linked to his work, especially his relationships with his models and muses Elizabeth Siddal (whom he married), Fanny Cornforth, and Jane Morris.

==Early life==


The son of émigré Italian scholar Gabriele Pasquale Giuseppe Rossetti and his wife Frances Mary Lavinia Polidori, Gabriel Charles Dante Rossetti was born in London, on 12 May 1828. His family and friends called him Gabriel, but in publications he put the name Dante first in honour of Dante Alighieri. He was the brother of poet Christina Rossetti, critic William Michael Rossetti, and author Maria Francesca Rossetti. His father was a Roman Catholic, at least prior to his marriage, and his mother was an Anglican; ostensibly Gabriel was baptised as and was a practising Anglican. John William Polidori, who had died seven years before his birth, was Rossetti&#x27;s maternal uncle. During his childhood, Rossetti was home educated and later attended King&#x27;s College School, and often read the Bible, along with the works of Shakespeare, Dickens, Sir Walter Scott, and Lord Byron.

The youthful Rossetti is described as &quot;self-possessed, articulate, passionate and charismatic&quot; but also &quot;ardent, poetic and feckless&quot;. Like all his siblings, he aspired to be a poet and attended King&#x27;s College School, in its original location near the Strand in London. He also wished to be a painter, having shown a great interest in Medieval Italian art. He studied at Henry Sass&#x27; Drawing Academy from 1841 to 1845, when he enrolled in the Antique School of the Royal Academy, which he left in 1848. After leaving the Royal Academy, Rossetti studied under Ford Madox Brown, with whom he retained a close relationship throughout his life.

Following the exhibition of William Holman Hunt&#x27;s painting &quot;The Eve of St. Agnes&quot;, Rossetti sought out Hunt&#x27;s friendship. The painting illustrated a poem by John Keats. Rossetti&#x27;s own poem, &quot;The Blessed Damozel&quot;, was an imitation of Keats, and he believed Hunt might share his artistic and literary ideals. Together they developed the philosophy of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood which they founded along with John Everett Millais.

The group&#x27;s intention was to reform English art by rejecting what they considered to be the mechanistic approach first adopted by the Mannerist artists who succeeded Raphael and Michelangelo and the formal training regime introduced by Sir Joshua Reynolds. Their approach was to return to the abundant detail, intense colours, and complex compositions of Quattrocento Italian and Flemish art. The eminent critic John Ruskin wrote:

For the first issue of the brotherhood&#x27;s magazine, &quot;The Germ&quot;, published early in 1850, Rossetti contributed a poem, &quot;The Blessed Damozel&quot;, and a story about a fictional early Italian artist inspired by a vision of a woman who bids him combine the human and the divine in his art. Rossetti was always more interested in the medieval than in the modern side of the movement, working on translations of Dante and other medieval Italian poets, and adopting the stylistic characteristics of the early Italians.

==Career==
===Beginnings===
Rossetti&#x27;s first major paintings in oil display the realist qualities of the early Pre-Raphaelite movement. His &quot;Girlhood of Mary Virgin&quot; (1849) and &quot;Ecce Ancilla Domini&quot; (1850) portray Mary as a teenage girl. William Bell Scott saw &quot;Girlhood&quot; in progress in Hunt&#x27;s studio and remarked on young Rossetti&#x27;s technique:

Stung by criticism of his second major painting, &quot;Ecce Ancilla Domini&quot;, exhibited in 1850, and the &quot;increasingly hysterical critical reaction that greeted Pre-Raphaelitism&quot; that year, Rossetti turned to watercolours, which could be sold privately. Although his work subsequently won support from John Ruskin, Rossetti only rarely exhibited thereafter.

===Dante and Medievalism===
In 1850, Rossetti met Elizabeth Siddal, an important model for the Pre-Raphaelite painters. Over the next decade, she became his muse, his pupil, and his passion. They were married in 1860. Rossetti&#x27;s incomplete picture &quot;Found&quot;, begun in 1853 and unfinished at his death, was his only major modern-life subject. It depicted a prostitute, lifted from the street by a country drover who recognises his old sweetheart. However, Rossetti increasingly preferred symbolic and mythological images to realistic ones.

For many years, Rossetti worked on English translations of Italian poetry including Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;La Vita Nuova&quot; (published as &quot;The Early Italian Poets&quot; in 1861). These and Sir Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; inspired his art of the 1850s. He created a method of painting in watercolours, using thick pigments mixed with gum to give rich effects similar to medieval illuminations. He also developed a novel drawing technique in pen-and-ink. His first published illustration was &quot;The Maids of Elfen-Mere&quot; (1855), for a poem by his friend William Allingham, and he contributed two illustrations to Edward Moxon&#x27;s 1857 edition of Alfred, Lord Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Poems&quot; and illustrations for works by his sister Christina Rossetti.

His visions of Arthurian romance and medieval design also inspired William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones. Neither Burne-Jones nor Morris knew Rossetti, but were much influenced by his works, and met him by recruiting him as a contributor to their &quot;Oxford and Cambridge Magazine&quot; which Morris founded in 1856 to promote his ideas about art and poetry.

In February 1857, Rossetti wrote to William Bell Scott:

That summer Morris and Rossetti visited Oxford and finding the Oxford Union debating-hall under construction, pursued a commission to paint the upper walls with scenes from &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; and to decorate the roof between the open timbers. Seven artists were recruited, among them Valentine Prinsep and Arthur Hughes, and the work was hastily begun. The frescoes, done too soon and too fast, began to fade at once and now are barely decipherable. Rossetti recruited two sisters, Bessie and Jane Burden, as models for the Oxford Union murals, and Jane became Morris&#x27;s wife in 1859.

=== Book arts ===
Literature was integrated into the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood&#x27;s artistic practice from the beginning (including that of Rossetti), with many paintings making direct literary references. For example, John Everett Millais&#x27; early work, &quot;Isabella&quot; (1849), depicts an episode from John Keats&#x27; &quot;Isabella, or, the Pot of Basil&quot; (1818). Rossetti was particularly critical of the gaudy ornamentation of Victorian gift books and sought to refine bindings and illustrations to align with the principles of the Aesthetic Movement. Rossetti&#x27;s key bindings were designed between 1861 and 1871. He collaborated as a designer/illustrator with his sister, poet Christina Rossetti, on the first edition of &quot;Goblin Market&quot; (1862) and &quot;The Prince&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1866). 
One of Rossetti&#x27;s most prominent contributions to illustration was the collaborative book, &quot;Poems&quot; by Alfred, Lord Tennyson (published by Edward Moxon in 1857 and known colloquially as the &#x27;Moxon Tennyson&#x27;). Moxon envisioned Royal Academicians as the illustrators for the ambitious project, but this vision was quickly disrupted once Millais, a founding member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, became involved in the project. Millais recruited William Holman Hunt and Rossetti for the project, and the involvement of these artists reshaped the entire production of the book. In reference to the Pre-Raphaelite illustrations, Laurence Housman wrote &quot;[...] The illustrations of the Pre-Raphaelites were personal and intellectual readings of the poems to which they belonged, not merely echoes in line of the words of the text.&quot; The Pre-Raphaelites&#x27; visualization of Tennyson&#x27;s poems indicated the range of possibilities in interpreting written works, as did their unique approach to visualizing narrative on the canvas.

Pre-Raphaelite illustrations do not simply refer to the text in which they appear; rather, they are part of a bigger program of art: the book as a whole. Rossetti&#x27;s philosophy about the role of illustration was revealed in an 1855 letter to poet William Allingham, when he wrote, in reference to his work on the Moxon Tennyson:

&quot;I have not begun even designing for them yet, but fancy I shall try the &quot;Vision of Sin&quot;, and &quot;Palace of Art&quot; etc.—those where one can allegorize on one&#x27;s own hook, without killing for oneself and everyone a distinct idea of the poet&#x27;s.&quot;

This passage makes apparent Rossetti&#x27;s desire not to just support the poet&#x27;s narrative, but to create an allegorical illustration that functions separately from the text as well. In this respect, Pre-Raphaelite illustrations go beyond depicting an episode from a poem, but rather function like subject paintings within a text. Illustration is not subservient to text and vice versa. Careful and conscientious craftsmanship is practiced in every aspect of production, and each element, though qualifiedly artistic in its own right, contributes to a unified art object (the book).

===Religious influence on works===
England began to see a revival of religious beliefs and practices starting in 1833 and moving onward to about 1845. The Oxford Movement, also known as the Tractarian Movement, had recently begun a push toward the restoration of Christian traditions that had been lost in the Church of England. Rossetti and his family had been attending Christ Church, Albany Street since 1843. His brother, William Michael Rossetti recorded that services had begun changing in the church since the start of the &quot;High Anglican movement&quot;. Rev. William Dodsworth was responsible for these changes, including the addition of the Catholic practice of placing flowers and candles by the altar. Rossetti and his family, along with two of his colleagues (one of which cofounded the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood) had also attended St. Andrew&#x27;s on Wells Street, a High Anglican church. It is noted that the Anglo-Catholic revival very much affected Rossetti in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The spiritual expressions of his painting &quot;The Girlhood of Mary Virgin&quot;, finished in 1849, are evident of this claim. The painting&#x27;s altar is decorated very similarly to that of a Catholic altar, proving his familiarity with the Anglo-Catholic revival. The subject of the painting, the Blessed Virgin, is sewing a red cloth, a significant part of the Oxford Movement that emphasized the embroidering of altar cloths by women. Oxford Reformers identified two major aspects to their movement, that &quot;the end of all religion must be communion with God,&quot; and &quot;that the Church was divinely instituted for the very purpose of bringing about this consummation.&quot;

From the beginning of the Brotherhood&#x27;s formation in 1848, their pieces of art included subjects of noble or religious disposition. Their aim was to communicate a message of &quot;moral reform&quot; through the style of their works, exhibiting a &quot;truth to nature&quot;. Specifically in Rossetti&#x27;s &quot;Hand and Soul&quot;, written in 1849, he displays his main character Chiaro as an artist with spiritual inclinations. In the text, Chiaro&#x27;s spirit appears before him in the form of a woman who instructs him to &quot;set thine hand and thy soul to serve man with God.&quot; The Rossetti Archive defines this text as &quot;Rossetti&#x27;s way of constellating his commitments to art, religious devotion, and a thoroughly secular historicism.&quot; Likewise, in &quot;The Blessed Damozel&quot;, written between 1847 and 1870, Rossetti uses biblical language such as &quot;From the gold bar of Heaven&quot; to describe the Damozel looking down to Earth from Heaven. Here we see a connection between body and soul, mortal and supernatural, a common theme in Rossetti&#x27;s works. In &quot;Ave&quot; (1847), Mary awaits the day that she will meet her son in Heaven, uniting the earthly with the heavenly. The text highlights a strong element in Anglican Marian theology that describes Mary&#x27;s body and soul having been assumed into Heaven. William Michael Rossetti, his brother, wrote in 1895: &quot;He was never confirmed, professed no religious faith, and practised no regular religious observances; but he had ... sufficient sympathy with the abstract ideas and the venerable forms of Christianity to go occasionally to an Anglican church — very occasionally, and only as the inclination ruled him.&quot;

===A new direction===

Around 1860, Rossetti returned to oil painting, abandoning the dense medieval compositions of the 1850s in favour of powerful close-up images of women in flat pictorial spaces characterised by dense colour. These paintings became a major influence on the development of the European Symbolist movement. In them, Rossetti&#x27;s depiction of women became almost obsessively stylised. He portrayed his new lover Fanny Cornforth as the epitome of physical eroticism, while Jane Burden, the wife of his business partner William Morris, was glamorised as an ethereal goddess. &quot;As in Rossetti&#x27;s previous reforms, the new kind of subject appeared in the context of a wholesale reconfiguration of the practice of painting, from the most basic level of materials and techniques up to the most abstract or conceptual level of the meanings and ideas that can be embodied in visual form.&quot; These new works were based not on medievalism, but on the Italian High Renaissance artists of Venice, Titian and Veronese.

In 1861, Rossetti became a founding partner in the decorative arts firm, Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co. with Morris, Burne-Jones, Ford Madox Brown, Philip Webb, Charles Faulkner and Peter Paul Marshall. Rossetti contributed designs for stained glass and other decorative objects.

Rossetti&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth, died of an overdose of laudanum in 1862, possibly a suicide, shortly after giving birth to a stillborn child. Rossetti became increasingly depressed, and when Elizabeth was buried at Highgate Cemetery, he interred the bulk of his unpublished poems with her, though he later had them dug up. He idealised her image as Dante&#x27;s Beatrice in a number of paintings, such as &quot;Beata Beatrix&quot;.

===Cheyne Walk years===



After the death of his wife, Rossetti leased a Tudor House at 16, Cheyne Walk, in Chelsea, where he lived for 20 years surrounded by extravagant furnishings and a parade of exotic birds and animals. Rossetti was fascinated with wombats, asking friends to meet him at the &quot;Wombat&#x27;s Lair&quot; at the London Zoo in Regent&#x27;s Park, and spending hours there. In September 1869, he acquired the first of two pet wombats, which he named &quot;Top&quot;. It was brought to the dinner table and allowed to sleep in the large centrepiece during meals. Rossetti&#x27;s fascination with exotic animals continued throughout his life, culminating in the purchase of a llama and a toucan, which he dressed in a cowboy hat and trained to ride the llama round the dining-table for his amusement.

Rossetti maintained Fanny Cornforth (described delicately by William Allington as Rossetti&#x27;s &quot;housekeeper&quot;) in her own establishment nearby in Chelsea, and painted many voluptuous images of her between 1863 and 1865.

In 1865, he discovered auburn-haired Alexa Wilding, a dressmaker and would-be actress who was engaged to model for him on a full-time basis and sat for &quot;Veronica Veronese&quot;, &quot;The Blessed Damozel&quot;, &quot;A Sea–Spell&quot;, and other paintings. She sat for more of his finished works than any other model, but comparatively little is known about her due to the lack of any romantic connection with Rossetti. He spotted her one evening in the Strand in 1865 and was immediately struck by her beauty. She agreed to sit for him the following day, but failed to arrive. He spotted her again weeks later, jumped from the cab he was in and persuaded her to go straight to his studio. He paid her a weekly fee to sit for him exclusively, afraid that other artists might employ her. They shared a lasting bond; after Rossetti&#x27;s death Wilding was said to have travelled regularly to place a wreath on his grave.

Jane Morris, whom Rossetti had used as a model for the Oxford Union murals he painted with William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones in 1857, also sat for him during these years, she &quot;consumed and obsessed him in paint, poetry, and life&quot;. Jane Morris was also photographed by John Robert Parsons, whose photographs were painted by Rossetti. In 1869, Morris and Rossetti rented a country house, Kelmscott Manor at Kelmscott, Oxfordshire, as a summer home, but it became a retreat for Rossetti and Jane Morris to have a long-lasting and complicated liaison. They spent summers there with the Morrises&#x27; children, while William Morris travelled to Iceland in 1871 and 1873.

During these years, Rossetti was prevailed upon by friends, in particular Charles Augustus Howell, to exhume his poems from his wife&#x27;s grave which he did, collating and publishing them in 1870 in the volume &quot;Poems by D. G. Rossetti&quot;. They created controversy when they were attacked as the epitome of the &quot;fleshly school of poetry&quot;. Their eroticism and sensuality caused offence. One poem, &quot;Nuptial Sleep&quot;, described a couple falling asleep after sex. It was part of Rossetti&#x27;s sonnet sequence &quot;The House of Life&quot;, a complex series of poems tracing the physical and spiritual development of an intimate relationship. Rossetti described the sonnet form as a &quot;moment&#x27;s monument&quot;, implying that it sought to contain the feelings of a fleeting moment, and reflect on their meaning. &quot;The House of Life&quot; was a series of interacting monuments to these moments – an elaborate whole made from a mosaic of intensely described fragments. It was Rossetti&#x27;s most substantial literary achievement.

The 1870 collection &quot;Poems&quot; included some translations, such as his &quot;Ballad Of Dead Ladies&quot;, an 1869 translation of François Villon&#x27;s poem &quot;Ballade des dames du temps jadis&quot;. (The word &quot;&quot; is credited to Rossetti as a neologism used for the first time in this translation.)

In 1881, Rossetti published a second volume of poems, &quot;Ballads and Sonnets&quot;, which included the remaining sonnets from &quot;The House of Life&quot; sequence.

==Decline and death==
The savage reaction of critics to Rossetti&#x27;s first collection of poetry contributed to a mental breakdown in June 1872, and although he joined Jane Morris at Kelmscott that September, he &quot;spent his days in a haze of chloral and whisky&quot;. The next summer he was much improved, and both Alexa Wilding and Jane sat for him at Kelmscott, where he created a soulful series of dream-like portraits. In 1874, Morris reorganised his decorative arts firm, cutting Rossetti out of the business, and the polite fiction that both men were in residence with Jane at Kelmscott could not be maintained. Rossetti abruptly left Kelmscott in July 1874 and never returned. Toward the end of his life, he sank into a morbid state, darkened by his drug addiction to chloral hydrate and increasing mental instability. He spent his last years as a recluse at Cheyne Walk.

On Easter Sunday, 1882, he died at the country house of a friend, where he had gone in a vain attempt to recover his health, which had been destroyed by chloral as his wife&#x27;s had been destroyed by laudanum. He died of Bright&#x27;s disease, a disease of the kidneys from which he had been suffering for some time. He had been housebound for some years on account of paralysis of the legs, though his chloral addiction is believed to have been a means of alleviating pain from a botched hydrocele removal. He had been suffering from alcohol psychosis for some time brought on by the excessive amounts of whisky he used to drown out the bitter taste of the chloral hydrate. He is buried in the churchyard of All Saints at Birchington-on-Sea, Kent, England.

==Collections and critical assessment==
Tate Britain, Birmingham, Manchester, Salford Museum and Art Galleries and Wightwick Manor National Trust, all contain large collections of Rossetti&#x27;s work; Salford was bequeathed a number of works following the death of L. S. Lowry in 1976. Lowry was president of the Newcastle-based &#x27;Rossetti Society&#x27;, which was founded in 1966. Lowry&#x27;s private collection of works was chiefly built around Rossetti&#x27;s paintings and sketches of Elizabeth Siddal and Jane Morris, and notable pieces included &quot;Pandora&quot;, &quot; Proserpine&quot; and a drawing of Annie Miller.

In an interview with Mervyn Levy, Lowry explained his fascination with the Rossetti women in relation to his own work: &quot;I don&#x27;t like his women at all, but they fascinate me, like a snake. That&#x27;s why I always buy Rossetti whenever I can. His women are really rather horrible. It&#x27;s like a friend of mine who says he hates my work, although it fascinates him.&quot; The friend Lowry referred to was businessman Monty Bloom, to whom he also explained his obsession with Rossetti&#x27;s portraits: &quot;They are not real women.[...] They are dreams.[...] He used them for something in his mind caused by the death of his wife. I may be quite wrong there, but significantly they all came after the death of his wife.&quot;

The popularity, frequent reproduction, and general availability of Rossetti&#x27;s later paintings of women have led to this association with &quot;a morbid and languorous sensuality&quot;. His small-scale early works and drawings are less well known, but it is in these that his originality, technical inventiveness, and significance in the movement away from Academic tradition can best be seen. As Roger Fry wrote in 1916, &quot;Rossetti more than any other artist since Blake may be hailed as a forerunner of the new ideas&quot; in English Art.

==Media==
Rossetti was played by Oliver Reed in Ken Russell&#x27;s television film &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot; (1967). The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood has been the subject of two BBC period dramas. The first, &quot;The Love School&quot;, (1975) features Ben Kingsley as Rossetti. The second was &quot;Desperate Romantics&quot;, in which Rossetti is played by Aidan Turner. It was broadcast on BBC Two on Tuesday, 21 July 2009.

The character of Dr. Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer) appears in an episode of &quot;Cheers&quot; as Dante Gabriel Rossetti for his Halloween costume. His wife Dr. Lilith Sternin-Crane appears as Rossetti&#x27;s sister Christina. Their son Frederick is dressed as Spiderman.

==Fiction==
Gabriel Rossetti and other members of the Rossetti family are characters in Tim Powers&#x27; 2012 novel &quot;Hide Me Among the Graves&quot;, in which both the Rossettis&#x27; uncle John Polidori and Gabriel&#x27;s wife Elizabeth act as hosts for vampiric beings, and whose influence inspires the artistic genius of the family.

==Influence==
Rossetti&#x27;s poem &quot;The Blessed Damozel&quot; was the inspiration for Claude Debussy&#x27;s cantata &quot;La Damoiselle élue&quot; (1888).

John Ireland (18791962) set to music as one of his &quot;Three Songs&quot; (1926), Rossetti&#x27;s poem &quot;The One Hope&quot; from &quot;Poems&quot; (1870).

In 1904 Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872–1958) created his song cycle &quot;The House of Life&quot; from six poems by Rossetti. One song in that cycle, &quot;Silent Noon&quot;, is one of Vaughan Williams&#x27;s best known and most frequently performed songs.

In 1904, Phoebe Anna Traquair painted &quot;The Awakening&quot;, inspired by a sonnet from Rossetti&#x27;s &quot;The House of Life&quot;.

There is evidence to suggest that a number of paintings by Paula Modersohn-Becker (1876–1907) were influenced by the Pre-Raphaelite painter Dante Rossetti.

The 1990s grunge band Hole used lines from Rossetti&#x27;s &quot;Superscription&quot;, from &quot;House of Life&quot;, in their song &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; from their album &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;: while Rossetti&#x27;s line read &quot;Look in my face; my name is Might-have-been&quot; the Hole lyric is &quot;Look at my face; my name is Might-have-been.&quot;

The British release cover for the 1970 David Bowie album &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; was described by Bowie as a parody of a Rossetti painting.

<text>Christina Georgina Rossetti (5 December 1830 – 29 December 1894) was an English writer of romantic, devotional and children&#x27;s poems, including &quot;Goblin Market&quot; and &quot;Remember&quot;. She also wrote the words of two Christmas carols well known in Britain: &quot;In the Bleak Midwinter&quot;, later set by Gustav Holst, Katherine Kennicott Davis, and Harold Darke, and &quot;Love Came Down at Christmas&quot;, also set by Darke and other composers. She was a sister of the artist and poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti and features in several of his paintings.

==Early life and education==
Christina Rossetti was born in 38 Charlotte Street (now 110 Hallam Street), London, to Gabriele Rossetti, a poet and a political exile from Vasto, Abruzzo, Italy, since 1824, and Frances Polidori, the sister of Lord Byron&#x27;s friend and physician John William Polidori. She had two brothers and a sister: Dante Gabriel became an influential artist and poet, and William Michael and Maria both became writers. Christina, the youngest, and a lively child, dictated her first story to her mother before she had learnt to write.

Rossetti was educated at home by her mother and father through religious works, classics, fairy tales and novels. Rossetti delighted in the works of Keats, Scott, Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis. The influence of the work of Dante Alighieri, Petrarch and other Italian writers filled the home and influenced Rossetti&#x27;s later writing. Their household was open to visiting Italian scholars, artists and revolutionaries. The family homes in Bloomsbury at no.38 and later no.50 Charlotte (Hallam) Street (now demolished) were within easy reach of Madame Tussauds, London Zoo and the newly opened Regent&#x27;s Park, which she visited regularly. Unlike her parents, Rossetti felt at home in London and was seemingly happy.
In the 1840s, Rossetti&#x27;s family faced financial troubles due to a deterioration in her father&#x27;s physical and mental health. In 1843, he was diagnosed with persistent bronchitis, possibly tuberculosis, and faced losing his sight. He gave up his teaching post at King&#x27;s College and though he lived another 11 years, suffered from depression and was never physically well again. Rossetti&#x27;s mother began teaching to support the family, and Maria became a live-in governess, a prospect that Christina Rossetti dreaded. At the time her brother William was working for the Excise Office and Gabriel was at art school, leaving Christina increasingly isolated at home. When she was 14, she suffered a nervous breakdown and left school. Bouts of depression and related illness followed. During this period she, her mother and her sister became absorbed in the Anglo-Catholic movement that developed in the Church of England. Religious devotion came to play a major role in her life.

In her late teens, Rossetti became engaged to the painter James Collinson, the first of three suitors. He, like her brothers Dante and William, was a founding member of the avant-garde Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, established in 1848. The engagement ended in 1850 when he reverted to Catholicism. In 1853, when the family had financial difficulties, Christina helped her mother keep a school in Fromefield, Frome, but it did not succeed. A plaque marks the house. In 1854 the pair returned to London, where Christina&#x27;s father died. She later became involved with the linguist Charles Cayley, but declined to marry him, also for religious reasons. A third offer came from the painter John Brett, whom she likewise refused.

Rossetti sat for several of Dante Gabriel Rossetti&#x27;s paintings. In 1848, she sat for the Virgin Mary in his first completed oil painting, &quot;The Girlhood of Mary Virgin&quot;, and the first work he inscribed with the initials &quot;PRB&quot;, later revealed as standing for the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. The following year she modelled for his depiction of the Annunciation, &quot;Ecce Ancilla Domini&quot;. A line from her poem &quot;Who shall deliver me?&quot; inspired a painting by Fernand Khnopff called &quot;I lock my door upon myself&quot;. In 1849 she again became seriously ill with depression, and around 1857 had a major religious crisis.

==Career== 


From 1842 onward Rossetti began writing down and dating her poems. Most of them imitated her favoured poets. In 1847 she began experimenting with verse forms such as sonnets, hymns and ballads, while drawing on narratives from the Bible, folk tales and the lives of saints. Her early pieces often meditate on death and loss in the Romantic tradition. Her first two poems published were &quot;Death&#x27;s Chill Between&quot; and &quot;Heart&#x27;s Chill Between&quot;, in the &quot;Athenaeum&quot; magazine in 1848. She used the pseudonym &quot;Ellen Alleyne&quot; in the literary periodical, &quot;The Germ&quot;, published by the Pre-Raphaelites from January to April 1850 and edited by her brother William. This marked the beginning of her public career.

Rossetti&#x27;s more critical reflections on the artistic movement her brother had begun were expressed in an 1856 poem &quot;In the Artist&#x27;s Studio&quot;. Here she reflects on seeing multiple paintings of the same model. For Rossetti, the artist&#x27;s idealised vision of the model&#x27;s character begins to overwhelm his work, until &quot;every canvas means/ the one same meaning.&quot; Dinah Roe, in her introduction to the Penguin Classics collection of Pre-Raphaelite poetry, argues that this critique of her brother and similar male artists is less about &quot;the objectification of women&quot; than about &quot;the male artist&#x27;s self-worship&quot;.

Rossetti&#x27;s first commercially printed collection, &quot;Goblin Market and Other Poems&quot;, was published under her own name by Macmillan &amp; Co. in 1862, when she was 31. Dante Gabriel Rossetti became his sister&#x27;s collaborator and created much-praised woodcut illustrations to the book which enhanced the effect of the work and emphasised its sensuality. &quot;Goblin Market&quot; was widely praised by critics, who placed her as the foremost female poet of the day; sales, however, were disappointing. She was lauded by Gerard Manley Hopkins, Algernon Swinburne and Tennyson. After its publication, Rossetti was named the natural successor to Elizabeth Barrett Browning, who had died the year before in 1861. The title poem, one of her best known, is ostensibly about two sisters&#x27; misadventures with goblins, but critics have seen it in various ways including an allegory of temptation and salvation, a comment on Victorian gender roles and female agency, and a work of erotic desire and social redemption.

Rossetti worked voluntarily in 1859–1870 at the St Mary Magdalene house of charity in Highgate, a refuge for ex-prostitutes. It is suggested that &quot;Goblin Market&quot; may have been inspired by &quot;fallen women&quot; she came to know. There are parallels with Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; in religious themes of temptation, sin and redemption by vicarious suffering. Swinburne in 1883 dedicated &quot;A Century of Roundels&quot; to Rossetti, as she adopted his roundel form in a number of poems, for instance in &quot;Wife to Husband&quot;. She was ambivalent about women&#x27;s suffrage, but many have found feminist themes in her work. She opposed slavery in the United States, cruelty to animals in prevalent vivisection, and exploitation of girls in under-age prostitution.

Rossetti kept a wide circle of friends and correspondents. She continued to write and publish for the rest of her life, mainly devotional work and children&#x27;s poetry. In the years just before her death, she wrote &quot;The Face of the Deep&quot;, (1892) a book of devotional prose, and oversaw an enlarged edition of &quot;Sing-Song&quot;, originally published in 1872, in 1893. She died late the next year.
Rossetti was one of the first female stamp collectors, beginning her collection in 1847, just seven years after the first stamp was issued.

==Later life==
In her later decades, Rossetti suffered from a type of hyperthyroidism – Graves&#x27; disease – diagnosed in 1872, suffering a near-fatal attack in the early 1870s. In 1893, she developed breast cancer. The tumour was removed, but there was a recurrence in September 1893.

Christina Rossetti died in great pain and anguish of cancer on 29 December 1893 and was buried on 2 January 1894 in the family grave on the west side of Highgate Cemetery, which, notoriously had been opened in October 1869 so that Gabriel could retrieve a volume of poems he had buried with his wife. There she joined her father, mother and Elizabeth Siddal, wife of her brother Dante Gabriel. Her brother William was also buried there in 1919, as were the ashes of four subsequent family members.

There is a stone tablet on the façade of 30 Torrington Square, Bloomsbury, marking her final home, where she died.

==Recognition==
Rossetti&#x27;s popularity in her lifetime did not approach that of her contemporary Elizabeth Barrett Browning, but her standing remained strong after her death. Her popularity faded in the early 20th century in the wake of Modernism, but scholars began to explore Freudian themes in her work, such as religious and sexual repression, reaching for personal, biographical interpretations of her poetry. 

Academics studying her work in the 1970s saw beyond the lyrical sweetness to her mastery of prosody and versification. Feminists held her as a symbol of constrained female genius and a leader among 19th-century poets. Her writings strongly influenced writers such as Ford Madox Ford, Virginia Woolf, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Elizabeth Jennings, and Philip Larkin. The critic Basil de Sélincourt called her &quot;all but our greatest woman poet... incomparably our greatest craftswoman... probably in the first twelve of the masters of English verse.&quot;

Rossetti&#x27;s Christmas poem &quot;In the Bleak Midwinter&quot; became widely known in the English-speaking world after her death, when set as a Christmas carol by Gustav Holst and later by Harold Darke. Her poem &quot;Love Came Down at Christmas&quot; (1885) has also been widely arranged as a carol.

British composers receptive to Rossetti&#x27;s verse included Alexander Mackenzie (&quot;Three Songs&quot;, Op. 17, 1878), Frederick Cowen, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor (&quot;Six Sorrow Songs&quot;, Op. 57, 1904), Hubert Parry, Hope Squire, Charles Villiers Stanford, and Jack Gibbons (sixteen song settings). In 1918, John Ireland set eight poems from her &quot;Sing-Song: A Nursery Rhyme Book&quot; to music in his song cycle &quot;Mother and Child&quot;. The first verse of Yoko Ono&#x27;s song &quot;Who Has Seen the Wind?&quot; (1970) was taken from Rossetti&#x27;s homonymous poem.

The poem &quot;Song&quot; was an inspiration for Bear McCreary&#x27;s composition &quot;When I Am Dead&quot;, published in 2015. Two of Rossetti&#x27;s poems, &quot;Where Sunless Rivers Weep&quot; and &quot;Weeping Willow&quot;, were set to music by Barbara Arens in her &quot;All Beautiful &amp; Splendid Things: 12 + 1 Piano Songs on Poems by Women&quot; (2017, Editions Musica Ferrum). Rossetti&#x27;s &quot;Love is Like a Rose&quot; was set to music by Constance Cochnower Virtue; &quot;Love Me, I Love You,&quot; was set to music by Hanna Vollenhoven; and &quot;Song of the Dawn&quot; was set to music by Elise Fellows White.

In 2000, one of many Millennium projects across the country was a poetry stone placed in what had been the grounds of North Hill House in Frome. On one side is an excerpt from her poem, &quot;What Good Shall My Life Do Me&quot;: &quot;Love lights the sun: love through the dark/Lights the moon&#x27;s evanescent arc:/Same Love lights up the glow-worms spark.&quot; She wrote about her brief stay in Frome, which had &quot;an abundance of green slopes and gentle declivities: no boldness or grandeur but plenty of peaceful beauty&quot;.

In 2011, Rossetti was a subject of a Radio 4 programme, &quot;In Our Time&quot;.

The title of J. K. Rowling&#x27;s novel &quot;The Cuckoo&#x27;s Calling&quot; (2013) follows a line in Rossetti&#x27;s poem &quot;A Dirge&quot;.

Christina Rossetti is commemorated in the Church of England calendar on 27 April.
