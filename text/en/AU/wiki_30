<text>The River Stour (, pronounced rhyming with either &quot;tour&quot; or &quot;sour&quot;) is a major river in East Anglia, England. It is long and forms most of the county boundary between Suffolk to the north, and Essex to the south. It rises in eastern Cambridgeshire, passes to the east of Haverhill, through Cavendish, Sudbury, Bures, Nayland, Stratford St Mary and Dedham. It becomes tidal just before Manningtree in Essex and joins the North Sea at Harwich.

The origins of its name are unclear, but several possibilities have been proposed by scholars. 

In 885, the river near Harwich was the site of the two Battles of the River Stour.

The entire non-tidal river above Manningtree is designated as the Dedham Vale National Landscape, formerly known as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It has been painted by a number of prominent artists, including John Constable and Thomas Gainsborough.

The river was improved for navigation following the passing of an act of Parliament, the River Stower Navigation Act 1705 (4 &amp; 5 Ann. c. 2). Locks were built to enable lighters to reach the town of Sudbury. Most of the locks were associated with mills, and the original 13 flash locks and 13 pound locks were replaced by 15 pound locks in the 19th century. The river was reasonably profitable at the beginning of the 19th century, but the advent of the railways led to a steady decline from 1852 onwards. Attempts to abandon it were thwarted by legal difficulties, but in 1914 the River Stour Navigation Company declared itself bankrupt, and the river soon became moribund.

From 1928 onwards, the river became a major source of drinking water, with South East Essex Waterworks (now Essex and Suffolk Water) extracting water at Langham and then Stratford St Mary pumping stations. As the demand for water grew, the Ely-Ouse to Essex Transfer Scheme was implemented, with water from the River Great Ouse discharged into the upper reaches of the river, and extracted again by the pumping stations. A third extraction point was added near Brantham, so that volumes of water flowing through Flatford could be maintained at a higher level for the benefit of tourists. To prevent salt water entering the river valley, sluices and a barrage were built at Cattawade, preventing boats from entering the river from the estuary.

The River Stour Trust was set up in 1968 to campaign for greater use of the river for navigation. It has worked to refurbish four locks, and to run boat trips from Flatford and Sudbury. The river can be used by unpowered craft between Sudbury and Cattawade, but powered boats are normally only allowed between Sudbury and Henny Mill, although the Trust has permission to run an electric boat at Flatford. Canoes and kayaks have to be portaged around the former locks where these have been replaced by fixed weirs and sluices.

==Etymology and usage==
The name is of ambiguous and disputed origin.

On one theory, the name &quot;Stour&quot; derives from the Celtic &quot;sturr&quot; meaning &quot;strong&quot;. However, the river-name &quot;Stour&quot;, common in England, does not occur at all in Wales; Crawford noted two tributaries of the Po River near Turin, spelled &quot;Stura&quot;. In Germany the &quot;Stoer&quot; is a tributary of the River Elbe. According to &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Britain and Ireland&quot; the &quot;Stour&quot; is pronounced differently in different cases: the Kentish and East Anglian Stours rhyme with &quot;tour&quot;; the Oxfordshire Stour is sometimes rhymed with &quot;mower&quot;, sometimes with &quot;hour&quot;, and the Worcestershire Stour always rhymes with &quot;hour&quot;. Locally, the River Stour dividing Essex from Suffolk does not have a uniform pronunciation, varying from &quot;stowr&quot; to &quot;stoor&quot;.

As against that, &quot;stour&quot; is a Middle English word with two distinct meanings and derivations, still current enough to appear in most substantial dictionaries. As an adjective, with Germanic roots, it signifies &quot;large, powerful&quot; (in present-day Scandinavian languages &quot;stor&quot; means &quot;big, great&quot;). As a noun, from medieval French roots, it signifies &quot;tumult, commotion; confusion&quot; or an &quot;armed battle or conflict&quot;. Wiktionary also adds &quot;blowing or deposit of dust&quot;, the primary definition in the &quot;Concise Oxford Dictionary&quot;, which adds that this is a northern English and Scottish usage of uncertain derivation. In 2006 it has been suggested that an Old European river-name was taken for an Old English adjective and that &quot;stour&quot; came to represent one pole of a structural opposition, with &quot;blyth&quot; at the opposite pole, allowing Anglo-Saxons to classify rivers on a continuum of fierceness.

The Victorian etymologist Isaac Taylor proposed a very simple solution: that &quot;Stour&quot; derives from &quot;dŵr&quot;, the Welsh word for water.

It is quite possible that the various Stours do not share a common origin and that they need to be considered in their own terms rather than as a single problem. Certainly there is currently no universally-accepted explanation.

==Description==

The river rises in Wratting Common, Cambridgeshire, to the south of Weston Colville, and passes near Great Bradley where it is joined by Kirtling Brook. It continues through Little Thurlow, Great Thurlow, Great Wratting, and Kedington before passing to the east of Haverhill, where the county boundary between Suffolk and Essex starts to follow its course. The villages of Wixoe, Stoke-by-Clare, Clare and Cavendish are all on the left bank of the river. The River Glem joins it on the left bank, before it passes to the west of Long Melford and then skirts the western and southern edges of Sudbury. It is crossed by the A131 road at Ballingdon Bridge, to the south-west of Sudbury, below which it is officially navigable. It continues through Bures and to the south of Nayland to reach the western edge of Stratford St Mary. Dedham is on the south bank and Flatford on the north bank. To the south of Brantham the river becomes tidal below Cattawade barrage, after which it opens out to become an estuary near Manningtree, and runs along the southern side of the Shotley Peninsula. The international port of Harwich is on the south bank, and it is joined by the River Orwell as it reaches the sea to the east of Harwich.

The whole of the river valley above Manningtree is a designated National Landscape, formerly known as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The designated area is called Dedham Vale, and is named after the village of Dedham in Essex. It is an area of rural beauty on both sides of the river, covering around in total.

The earliest known settlement on the river in Suffolk was at Great Bradley, where human occupation has been recorded for over 5,000 years. During the Anglo-Saxon era, the river became the boundary between the Kingdom of the East Saxons and the Kingdom of East Anglia. The &quot;Life of King Alfred&quot; records a naval battle taking place at the mouth of the river in 884, where Alfred the Great defeated a force of 13 Viking ships.

The Stour valley has been portrayed as a working river by artists including John Constable, Thomas Gainsborough, Alfred Munnings, John Nash and Cedric Morris. Constable&#x27;s connection with the area was especially important, evident in such works as &quot;Stour Valley and Dedham Church&quot; c. 1815. John Nash, who was an official war artist, settled in the Stour valley and is buried at St Andrew&#x27;s at Wormingford, one of its typically serene small settlements.

The River Stour Trust, a waterway restoration group, was set up in 1968 to protect and enhance the right of the public to navigate the River Stour. The trust seeks to restore through navigation from Sudbury to the sea, following on the successful restoration of the locks at Stratford St Mary, Dedham, Flatford and Great Cornard, by reinstating the remaining locks. Meanwhile, the Trust encourages use of the river by small craft and organises annual events for all age groups and abilities on different parts of it. Boat trips and private charters, skippered by volunteer crews from the Trust, are available in Flatford and Sudbury between Easter and October. RSPB Stour Estuary is a nature reserve managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). It is located on the south bank of the estuary, to the east of Wrabness. Just to the west is Wrabness Nature Reserve, a Site of Special Scientific Interest covering . It is run by the Essex Wildlife Trust and is also a designated Local Nature Reserve and a Local Wildlife Site.

In July 2019 sections of the river ran dry because of low rainfall and debris blocking flows at Bures Mill. The Environment Agency pumped water from boreholes into the river in an attempt to restore water levels.

The river from Cattawade barrage to Orwell Haven is tidal and used by large ships. The channel is dredged to , and this section should only be navigated by those experienced in tidal river navigation. Coasters travel up the river as far as the quay at Mistley.

==Navigation==

There are no known records detailing use of the river by boats prior to the 17th century, but in 1634, Daniel Biatt, the mayor of Sudbury, met with Mr Doctor Warren and Mr Spencer to plan how to make the river navigable. On 11 December 1638 Spencer obtained Letters Patent authorising him to make the river navigable from Manningtree to Sudbury. No progress was made, due to unrest around the time of the civil war, Spencer&#x27;s pre-occupation with a similar project on the River Ouse, and his own financial difficulties. A similar scheme was proposed by Mr Maynard in 1658, but again no progress was made. By the late 1600s, John Little and Benjamin Dodd had obtained the rights of the Letters Patent, and later claimed they had spent a lot of money improving the river.
What they did is unknown, for in 1703 the mayor and corporation of Sudbury presented a bill to Parliament to make the river navigable. Little and Dodd objected, as they already had rights under the Letters Patent, but their case was dismissed, and an act of Parliament, the (4 &amp; 5 Ann. c. 2), was granted to Sudbury on 16 February 1706. It was entitled &quot;An Act for making the River Stower navigable from the town of Manningtree, in the county of Essex, to the town of Sudbury, in the county of Suffolk&quot;. A long list of commissioners was established, and the work was to be carried out by the mayor and aldermen of Sudbury and ten others. It had to be started before 24 June 1708 and completed by 24 June 1713. In order to placate the millers, they were given rights to carry millstones and building materials for their mills without payment of tolls. A towpath would be provided on parts of the river, but the path was intermittent.

The act also allowed winches and other engines to be set up on the banks, so that boats could be hauled through the flash locks which were built. A total of 13 flash locks and 13 pound locks were constructed. The posts on which the lock gates hung were continued above the top of the lock, and a lintel spanned the lock to prevent the posts collapsing inwards. Timber sides to the locks later replaced the earth walls, and in the 19th century the flash locks were removed, while the pound locks were rebuilt, so that there were 15 between Sudbury and the estuary.

Unusually for a navigation, the act did not specify how money to fund the project should be raised. In practice, 48 shares with a value of £100 were issued. Cornelius Denn bought 24, while the other 24 were split between Dean Cock and some clothiers from Sudbury. Denn and Cock were both merchants from London. This provided insufficient capital to complete the work, and the subscribers were asked for more money. £9,000 was raised, of which £6,500 was spent on the navigation works, £800 on 16 barges, and £1,700 on warehousing and other amenities. It is not known if there was an official opening, but in May 1709 barges carried 2,211 tons of coal from Manningtree up the navigation to Sudbury. The company was continually short of money, and in 1722 Daniel Defoe noted that the navigation was not really adequate. The company ceased in 1736 to be solely responsible for barge traffic on the river, and allowed anyone to use it on payment of a toll.
The commissioners failed to elect new members as older ones died, and by the 1770s there were only two left. Since a quorum of 15 was required to appoint new commissioners, a second act of Parliament, the (21 Geo. 3. c. 75) was obtained. New commissioners included Golding Constable, the father of the painter John Constable, and two brothers of the painter Thomas Gainsborough, Samuel and John. The act also empowered the new commissioners to build a towpath along the entire navigable section, and to maintain bridges, stiles and gates. Golding Constable and William Strutt had surveyed the river by September 1782, and a programme of dredging was carried out. Income from tolls was £700 in 1782, but this had doubled by 1817, with a large proportion of the revenue derived from the carriage of coal.

===Operation===
As trade improved, so did the river&#x27;s profitability, with a dividend of 11 percent paid in 1817. There were proposals to build links to Hadleigh, Boxford and Lavenham, but the only work carried out was a short cut near Sudbury to serve brickworks and limekilns, which was known as the Ballingdon Cut. Despite advice from William Cubitt that railways would never offer serious competition in the carriage of heavy goods, the proprietors spent £12,000 on a modernisation programme, involving the construction of towing paths and a cut to bypass a long loop at Wormingford, which included two new locks. Tolls for using the river were restructured, and there was a proposal in 1842 to upgrade the river for a further to Clare, but the scheme was not pursued due to the cost and the number of locks required.

The Eastern Counties Railway missed Sudbury by when it opened in 1843, but the Colchester, Stour Valley, Sudbury &amp; Halstead Railway was them promoted. The promoters tried to buy out the navigation, but rejected the asking price of £1,000 per share. Income on the navigation peaked at £3,400 in 1848, but had dropped to £1,400 by 1852, when the railway was operating. The towing path was far from satisfactory, with horses having to jump over fences, of which there were 123 in 1850, and 20 locations where the horse was transferred to the opposite bank by jumping onto the moving barge and jumping off again at the other side. In 1862 the proprietors investigated steam barges, and ordered one which arrived in 1863. It was not a success, and despite various modifications, was out of use by 1867.

There was a steady decline in traffic between 1864 and 1873, with many commodities dropping by 50 percent. Dividends were reduced from ten percent to two percent over the same period, and maintenance was less frequent, although a self-acting dredging crane was obtained in 1879, and worked successfully. Trade in bricks from the brickworks at Ballingdon Cut and in flour held up for some time, despite railway competition, but in 1892 the proprietors applied for an abandonment order. This was refused, as the river had not been disused for the required three years. Instead they formed a limited company, the River Stour Navigation Company Ltd. By 1906, tolls were no longer adequate to pay for maintenance, and on 8 October 1914, the company declared itself bankrupt.

The shareholders then formed a Trust, and although the last barge to reach Sudbury did so in 1916, there was limited traffic on the lower reaches of the river. The South Essex Waterworks Company rebuilt the locks at Brantham, Flatford, Stratford and Dedham in 1928 at a cost of £20,000, replacing the wooden sides with concrete walls. There was some traffic by millers until about 1930, but the Trust was finally dissolved on 19 March 1937.

===Restoration===
There was growing enthusiasm for canal restoration projects in the 1950s, and a group of canoeists from the Chelmsford Boat Club paddled down the lower reaches of the river on 17 October 1954, as part of a campaign to revive interest in the navigation. With the creation of the British Waterways Board pending, the River Stour Action Committee published &quot;A Guide to the Suffolk River Stour&quot;, which highlighted the legal problems preventing the river from being reopened. A second cruise by canoeists from Chelmsford Boat Club was held in September 1962, covering the stretch from Langham to Brantham. The London Volunteer Working Group of the Inland Waterways Association began publishing &quot;Navies Notebook&quot; in October 1966, and the first edition carried details of a working party at Brantham Lock, to begin restoration.

The River Stour Action Committee formed a trust in 1967, backed by the Essex Rural Community Council, to focus on restoration of the locks and the navigation. This became the River Stour Trust in 1968. In 1981, an arm of the Sudbury basin was cleared by the United States Air Force&#x27;s 819th Civil Engineering Squadron as part of a training exercise. The trust opened a fund to finance the construction of a new lock at Great Cornard, but a public inquiry to review new bylaws for the navigation proposed that the use of powered boats on the river should be prohibited. The Trust bought Flatford Lock in 1990, and its restoration was aided by a grant of £90,000 from Rio Tinto Zinc. The Trust also paid for the National Rivers Authority to refurbish the gates at Dedham Lock, to make them watertight, and the repairs lasted until they were declared to be unsafe in 2014. At the end of 1995, the Trust received a grant of £167,890 from the Millennium Commission to help with the construction of Great Cornard lock. Additional funds came from the Trust&#x27;s own fund and from local councils.

The Environment Agency is the navigation authority for the river. They took over the role from the National Rivers Authority in 1995. Powered boats are only allowed to use the section of the river near Sudbury from Ballingdon Bridge to Henny Mill, and a speed limit of is enforced. The rest of the once-navigable river from Brundon Mill to Cattawade can be used by canoes, kayaks and other non-powered craft, but have to be portaged around various fixed structures, often located where the locks once were. However, the Environment Agency are considering allowing the use of electric-powered boats on the lower river, and the River Stour Trust has permission to use electric trip boats on this section. The locks at Great Cornard, Stratford St Mary, Dedham and Flatford must be operated by Environment Agency staff, and advance notice of intent to navigate through them must be given. The locks rebuilt in 1928 were long, and wide, with a draught of . Dedham and Flatford locks have tilting weir structures fitted within them, and navigating them is not possible when the weirs are being used as part of the flood defences of the river.

The Stour Valley Adventure Centre hires out canoes, kayaks and paddle boards from a centre in Sudbury. The craft can be borrowed by the hour, and they also offer a two-day paddle from Sudbury to Cattawade, with transport to and from the start and end points to a campsite in Nayland, which forms the mid-point of the journey.

==Flood defences==

After the Navigation Trust declared itself bankrupt, the state of the river steadily declined, as locks decayed and fallen trees were not removed from the river. The lack of maintenance resulted in flooding of agricultural land, and so the Ministry of Agriculture created a Drainage Board responsible for flood control of the area in 1918. Three years later, they requested the Navigation Trust to remove the locks at Horkesley and Boxted, and to permanently open the paddles on the locks at Langham and Stratford St Mary, to aid the passage of water down the river. Numerous meetings took place over the following two decades, but little was achieved, and the river continued to deteriorate. Meadows near Flatford were regularly flooded by water passing up the south channel, and while tides passing up the north channel normally only reached Judas Gap, high spring tides could sometimes reach Flatford. The South Essex Waterworks Company wanted to extract more water from the river immediately following the Second World War, and this was granted on condition that they improved flood defences where the river reached the estuary. This work involved improving the weir at Judas Gap, and constructing a barrage across the south channel. It had 56 gravity-controlled gates, which could be used to allow fresh water to leave the river, but prevent salt water from entering it, and was known as the 56 Gate. Following its completion in 1948, land upstream of the 56 Gate was reclaimed for agricultural use.

In the aftermath of the North Sea flood of 1953, much thought was given as to how to protect coastal communities from such events, and in 1969 a new flood defence scheme was implemented. A dam with a sluice through it was built across the north channel below Cattawade Bridge at Brantham, while sluice gates were fitted across the south channel. The project also included building Cattawade Bypass, which travels over the flood defence dam at Brantham. These changes meant that there was fresh water habitat all the way down to the defences. A new weir containing a fish pass replaced the structure at Judas Gap, and this has resulted in the mill pond at Flatford always being fairly full, even in dry summers. The 56 Gate was no longer needed and the work, which was paid for jointly by Suffolk County Council and the Essex Water Company, was completed in 1971.

==Milling==
The river and its tribtaries have been an important source of power to the communities that live near them since at least the time of the Domesday Book of 1086. Some 45 water mills are known to have existed along their banks. Many of the sites are identifiable from modern maps. In some cases, either the mill or the associated mill house is named, while in others, multiple channels and an obvious mill pond show their location. Below Sudbury, most of the locks were associated with a mill. None of the mills are still operational, but where the buildings still exist, most are now listed buildings. Because the river forms the boundary between Suffolk and Essex for most of its length, those on the left bank are generally in Suffolk, and those on the right bank are in Essex. The furthest upstream is Kedington, where a mill was known to exist in 1066, but had been demolished by 1086. The present building dates from the 18th century, and was a corn mill until 1901. It is Grade II listed, as is the adjacent 17th-century mill house. Wixoe Mill is also an 18th-century building, constructed with a timber frame with weatherboarding on a brick base. The mill house and stables are nearby.

Baythorne Mill in Birdbrook dates from the 18th century, but was extended in the 19th century, when a building to house a steam engine and a tall chimney were added. It retains its mill wheel, although it is not operational, and some rare early leaded glass windows. At Clare, the 19th-century mill house survives but the mill building was destroyed by fire in 1978. At Pentlow, a long range dating from the 18th century contains both the mill and the mill house. The timber frame is clad with red bricks, and both parts are now residential. At Lyston Mill, the weather-boarded timber-framed mill house remains, although the mill itself was demolished in 1887 after a period of disuse. Borley Mill is a large timber-framed structure with three storeys, with a gabled lucombe projecting from the roof. It was a corn mill until 1916, and was then used to produce anilmal feed until it closed in 1969. In the 1940s there was probably a steam engine at the site, but the tall chimney has since been demolished. On the outskirts of Sudbury, the building at Brundon Mill dates from the 18th century. Water power was supplemented by a steam engine from 1857 until cereal milling ceased in 1923. It was converted into a house in 1932. Sudbury Mill is a four-storey structure, parts of which date from the 17th and 18th centuries, but most of it date from 1890. The water wheel, installed in 1889, still turns, although it does not drive machinery. A steam-powered roller mill was added in the early 20th century, and it was producing animal feed when it closed in 1964. The building is now the Mill Hotel.

Great Cornard was the first site where a lock was needed to navigate around the mill. The mill house dates from the 18th century, with later additions. The family of Edward Baker ran the mill from 1851 to 1967, after which it produced animal feed. The site has since been redeveloped for housing. Great Henny is another site where only the mill house survives. It is an early 19th-century timber-framed building with a hipped slate roof. The mill ceased production before the Second World War, and was subsequently damaged by bombing, leading to it being demolished when the war ended. Bures Mill is a timber-framed building, parts of which are weatherboarded, but much of it is now covered in corrugated asbestos panels. Wiston or Wissington Mill is Grade II* listed. It dates from the 18th and 19th centuries, and internally still contains the milling machinery, while externally parts of the water wheel remain. Part of the mill has been converted into a house, including a wing dating from the 16th century.

Boxted Mill house is a two-storey building with attics, but the mill building was demolished in the 1920s. At Langham, there was a corn mill and a fulling mill in 1086, but the fulling mill was demolished around 1510. In 1752, it was recorded that the remaining mill could fulfil either function. The building was reconstructed in brick around 1779, and ceased operating in 1912. It was later demolished to make way for a pumping station. Flatford Mill is well known because of the paintings of John Constable. It carries a date stone showing 1733, but may include some earlier material. The structure includes a granary to the rear, and a 19th-century wing adjoining the granary. Much of it is constructed of red brick, with some weatherboarding. It was owned and operated by the Constable family from the mid-18th century until 1901, when milling ceased, due to competition from more efficient mills. After a period of decay it was restored and given to the National Trust, and is now leased to the Field Studies Council, who operate a field studies centre there. It is Grade I listed, because of its association with Constable. In 2012, an Archimedes screw turbine was installed at the mill. Rated at 11 kW, it was expected to provide around a third of the energy used by the field studies centre. Work has since been carried out to improve the efficiency of the turbine, and to install a fish pass. The lowest mill on the river was Brantham or Green&#x27;s Mill, which was recorded in 1086. It may have been a tide mill at that time, and was definitely so later on. It was rebuilt in 1778, and subsequently became a steam-powered roller mill, producing cereals. It ceased to operate in the 1930s, although it was used as a pepper mill during the Second World War, but was damaged during the conflict. The remains were destroyed by fire in 1965.

==Water supply==
The river plays an inportant role in the supply of drinking water to residents of Essex. Langham Mill had ceased to operate by 1924, and in 1928 South Essex Waterworks (now Essex and Suffolk Water) obtained an Act of Parliament (18 &amp; 19 Geo. 5. c. lxxix) granting them permission to demolish it, in order to construct a pumping station on the site. It was licensed to abstract per day, which was treated at a works to the west, and then pumped to a reservoir at Danbury, from where it flowed to another reservoir at Herongate, suppliying customers in Romford, Ilford and Barking, Essex, in what is now part of Greater London. Reconstruction of the locks at Stratford, Dedham, Flatford and Brantham was a condition of the planning consent for the works. Although not a listed building, the pumping station was added to the Local List in 2020. It is constructed of concrete with a pitched roof, in the International Modernist style popular at the time, and is painted white. At the treatment works, the control room, primary filter house and chemical house are all built in the same Modernist style, and were listed because they form a good example of the style in largely unaltered form. There is a detached house and six semi-detached houses built in a similar style to the south of the works, probably designed as housing for the staff, and a service reservoir to the east with its own Modernist pumping station.

Although the Langham pumping station was completed in 1932, the company was convinced that it would be short of water by 1940, and obtained a second Act of Parliament, the South Essex Waterworks Act 1935 (25 &amp; 26 Geo. 5. c xlviii), to allow it to build an extraction point at Stratford St Mary. Water would be pumped southwards to Abberton Reservoir, construction of which was authorised by the same Act. The consents allowed the company to extract up to per day, but required that per day must continue down the river to Flatford and beyond. This was more than the river could supply, and so only the minimum allowed continued downstream. This reduced flow caused tides to flow upstream as far as Flatford, and the salt content of the tidal water was highly detrimental to the flora and fauna of the river corridor. The solution adopted was to build a further extraction point at Brantham, which meant that the flow past Stratford St Mary could be increased to per day, and the extra abstracted at Brantham.

The continued expansion of housing stocks in south-east Essex meant that still more water was needed and in 1964, the Ely-Ouse to Essex Transfer Scheme was initiated. Water from the River Great Ouse was transferred along the Cut-off Channel to an intake at Blackdyke, from where it flows by gravity to a pumping station at Kennett. It is then pumped to Kirtling Green where it discharges into Kirtling Brook, a tributary of the Stour. The extra water flows along the Stour, where some of it is abstracted by a pumping station at Wixoe for transfer by pipeline to Great Sampford where it discharges into the River Pant, the name of the upper reaches of the River Blackwater. The remaining water increased the flow on the Stour to the pumping stations further downstream. In 2006, further extensions were made to the scheme, as part of a plan to increase the capacity of Abberton Reservoir by 60 percent. Essex and Suffolk Water can extract per day from the Great Ouse, and the Kirtling Brook was too small to cope with this amount. A gravity pipeline was therefore built between Kirtling Green and Wixoe. Downstream, a new pumping station was built at Wormingford, which supplies a pipeline running to the western end of Abberton Reservoir. By 2019, Brantham was licensed to abstract between per day, which flows from the river to the Brantham pumping station by gravity, and is then pumped to Abberton Reservoir by one fixed-speed and two variable speed pumps.

To comply with the Eels (England and Wales) Regulations 2009, new screens were required on the intake from the river at Brantham, to prevent young eels, known as elvers, from being sucked into the machinery and killed. The new screens were positioned on the river side of the existing intake structure, and the rotating bandscreen was supplied by Hydrolox in 2019. It is wide and tall, and the mesh was much finer than the course mesh originally in use at the site. A comprehensive upgrade of the Stratford St Mary&#x27;s pumping station was undertaken in 2020, in view of the ageing technology and the fact that it is now licensed to abstract per day, more than four times the amount for which it was originally designed. The pumps were replaced, allowing the volume of water removed from the river to vary between per day to the full amount of the licence. New screens were required on the intake from the river, to protect elvers. A rotating screen supplied by Hydrolux was selected after considering various options, and this was cantilevered off the existing bandscreen building, to minimise disturbance to the river bed.

<text>Tyrian purple ( &quot;porphúra&quot;; ), also known as royal purple, imperial purple, or imperial dye, is a reddish-purple natural dye. The name Tyrian refers to Tyre, Lebanon, once Phoenicia. It is secreted by several species of predatory sea snails in the family Muricidae, rock snails originally known by the name Murex (&quot;Bolinus brandaris&quot;, &quot;Hexaplex trunculus&quot; and &quot;Stramonita haemastoma&quot;). In ancient times, extracting this dye involved tens of thousands of snails and substantial labour, and as a result, the dye was highly valued. The colored compound is 6,6&#x27;-dibromoindigo.

==History==
Biological pigments were often difficult to acquire, and the details of their production were kept secret by the manufacturers. Tyrian purple is a pigment made from the mucus of several species of murex snail. Production of Tyrian purple for use as a fabric dye began as early as 1200 BC by the Phoenicians, and was continued by the Greeks and Romans until 1453 AD, with the fall of Constantinople. In the same way as the modern-day Latin alphabet of Phoenician origin, Phoenician purple pigment was spread through the unique Phoenician trading empire. The pigment was expensive and time-consuming to produce, and items colored with it became associated with power and wealth. This popular idea of purple being elite contributes to the modern day widespread belief that purple is a &quot;royal colour&quot;. The colour of textiles from this period provides insight into socio-cultural relationships within ancient societies, in addition to providing insights on technological achievements, fashion, social stratification, agriculture and trade connections. Despite their value to archaeological research, textiles are quite rare in the archaeological record. Like any perishable organic material, they are usually subject to rapid decomposition and their preservation over millennia requires exacting conditions to prevent destruction by microorganisms.

Tyrian purple may first have been used by the ancient Phoenicians as early as 1570 BC. It has been suggested that the name Phoenicia itself means &#x27;land of purple&#x27;. The dye was greatly prized in antiquity because the colour did not easily fade, but instead became brighter with weathering and sunlight. It came in various shades, the most prized being that of black-tinted clotted blood.

Because it was extremely tedious to make, Tyrian purple was expensive: the 4th century BC historian Theopompus reported, &quot;Purple for dyes fetched its weight in silver at Colophon&quot; in Asia Minor. The expense meant that purple-dyed textiles became status symbols, whose use was restricted by sumptuary laws. The most senior Roman magistrates wore a &quot;toga praetexta&quot;, a white toga edged in Tyrian purple. The even more sumptuous &quot;toga picta&quot;, solid Tyrian purple with gold thread edging, was worn by generals celebrating a Roman triumph.

By the fourth century AD, sumptuary laws in Rome had been tightened so much that only the Roman emperor was permitted to wear Tyrian purple. As a result, &#x27;purple&#x27; is sometimes used as a metonym for the office (e.g. the phrase &#x27;donned the purple&#x27; means &#x27;became emperor&#x27;). The production of Tyrian purple was tightly controlled in the succeeding Byzantine Empire and subsidized by the imperial court, which restricted its use for the colouring of imperial silks. Later (9th century), a child born to a reigning emperor was said to be &quot;porphyrogenitos&quot;, &quot;born in the purple&quot;.

Some speculate that the dye extracted from the &quot;Bolinus brandaris&quot; is known as () in Biblical Hebrew. Another dye extracted from a related sea snail, &quot;Hexaplex trunculus&quot;, produced a blue colour after light exposure which could be the one known as (), used in garments worn for ritual purposes.

==Production from sea snails==
The dye substance is a mucous secretion from the hypobranchial gland of one of several species of medium-sized predatory sea snails that are found in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, and off the Atlantic coast of Morocco. These are the marine gastropods &quot;Bolinus brandaris&quot; the spiny dye-murex (originally known as &quot;Murex brandaris&quot; Linnaeus, 1758), the banded dye-murex &quot;Hexaplex trunculus&quot;, the rock-shell &quot;Stramonita haemastoma&quot;, and less commonly a number of other species such as &quot;Bolinus cornutus&quot;. The dye is an organic compound of bromine (i.e., an organobromine compound), a class of compounds often found in algae and in some other sea life, but much more rarely found in the biology of land animals. This dye is in contrast to the imitation purple that was commonly produced using cheaper materials than the dyes from the sea snail.

In nature, the snails use the secretion as part of their predatory behavior to sedate prey and as an antimicrobial lining on egg masses. The snail also secretes this substance when it is attacked by predators, or physically antagonized by humans (e.g., poked). Therefore, the dye can be collected either by &quot;milking&quot; the snails, which is more labor-intensive but is a renewable resource, or by collecting and destructively crushing the snails. David Jacoby remarks that &quot;twelve thousand snails of &quot;Murex brandaris&quot; yield no more than 1.4 g of pure dye, enough to colour only the trim of a single garment.&quot; The dye is collected via the snail-harvesting process, involving the extraction of the hypobranchial gland (located under the mollusk&#x27;s mantle). This requires advanced knowledge of biology. Murex-based dyeing must take place close to the site from which the snails originate, because the freshness of the material has a significant effect on the results, the colors yielded based on the long process of biochemical, enzymatic and photochemical reactions, and requires reduction and oxidation processes that probably took several days.
Many other species worldwide within the family Muricidae, for example &quot;Plicopurpura pansa&quot;, from the tropical eastern Pacific, and &quot;Plicopurpura patula&quot; from the Caribbean zone of the western Atlantic, can also produce a similar substance (which turns into an enduring purple dye when exposed to sunlight) and this ability has sometimes also been historically exploited by local inhabitants in the areas where these snails occur. (Some other predatory gastropods, such as some wentletraps in the family Epitoniidae, seem to also produce a similar substance, although this has not been studied or exploited commercially.) The dog whelk &quot;Nucella lapillus&quot;, from the North Atlantic, can also be used to produce red-purple and violet dyes.

==Royal blue==

The Phoenicians also made a deep blue-coloured dye, sometimes referred to as &quot;royal blue&quot; or &quot;hyacinth purple&quot;, which was made from a closely related species of marine snail.

The Phoenicians established an ancillary production facility on the Iles Purpuraires at Mogador, in Morocco. The sea snail harvested at this western Moroccan dye production facility was &quot;Hexaplex trunculus&quot;, also known by the older name &quot;Murex trunculus&quot;.

This second species of dye murex is found today on the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts of Europe and Africa (Spain, Portugal, Morocco).

==Background==
The colour-fast (non-fading) dye was an item of luxury trade, prized by Romans, who used it to colour ceremonial robes. Used as a dye, the colour shifts from blue (peak absorption at 590 nm, which is yellow-orange) to reddish-purple (peak absorption at 520 nm, which is green). It is believed that the intensity of the purple hue improved rather than faded as the dyed cloth aged. Vitruvius mentions the production of Tyrian purple from shellfish. In his &quot;History of Animals&quot;, Aristotle described the shellfish from which Tyrian purple was obtained and the process of extracting the tissue that produced the dye. Pliny the Elder described the production of Tyrian purple in his &quot;Natural History&quot;:

The most favourable season for taking these [shellfish] is after the rising of the Dog-star, or else before spring; for when they have once discharged their waxy secretion, their juices have no consistency: this, however, is a fact unknown in the dyers&#x27; workshops, although it is a point of primary importance. After it is taken, the vein [i.e. hypobranchial gland] is extracted, which we have previously spoken of, to which it is requisite to add salt, a sextarius [about 20 fl. oz.] to every hundred pounds of juice. It is sufficient to leave them to steep for a period of three days, and no more, for the fresher they are, the greater virtue there is in the liquor. It is then set to boil in vessels of tin [or lead], and every hundred amphorae ought to be boiled down to five hundred pounds of dye, by the application of a moderate heat; for which purpose the vessel is placed at the end of a long funnel, which communicates with the furnace; while thus boiling, the liquor is skimmed from time to time, and with it the flesh, which necessarily adheres to the veins. About the tenth day, generally, the whole contents of the cauldron are in a liquefied state, upon which a fleece, from which the grease has been cleansed, is plunged into it by way of making trial; but until such time as the colour is found to satisfy the wishes of those preparing it, the liquor is still kept on the boil. The tint that inclines to red is looked upon as inferior to that which is of a blackish hue. The wool is left to lie in soak for five hours, and then, after carding it, it is thrown in again, until it has fully imbibed the colour.

Archaeological data from Tyre indicate that the snails were collected in large vats and left to decompose. This produced a hideous stench that was actually mentioned by ancient authors. Not much is known about the subsequent steps, and the actual ancient method for mass-producing the two murex dyes has not yet been successfully reconstructed; this special &quot;blackish clotted blood&quot; colour, which was prized above all others, is believed to be achieved by double-dipping the cloth, once in the indigo dye of &quot;H. trunculus&quot; and once in the purple-red dye of &quot;B. brandaris&quot;.


The Roman mythographer Julius Pollux, writing in the 2nd century AD, recounts that the purple dye was first discovered by Heracles (Greek counterpart of the titular god of Tyre, Melqart) while being in Tyre to visit his beloved Tyros, or rather, by his dog, whose mouth was stained purple after biting into a snail on the beach. This story was depicted by Peter Paul Rubens in his painting &quot;Hercules&#x27; Dog Discovers Purple Dye&quot;. According to John Malalas, the incident happened during the reign of the legendary King Phoenix of Tyre, the eponymous progenitor of the Phoenicians, and therefore he was the first ruler to wear Tyrian purple and legislate on its use.

Recently, the archaeological discovery of substantial numbers of Murex shells on Crete suggests that the Minoans may have pioneered the extraction of Imperial purple centuries before the Tyrians. Dating from collocated pottery suggests the dye may have been produced during the Middle Minoan period in the 20th–18th century BC. Accumulations of crushed murex shells from a hut at the site of Coppa Nevigata in southern Italy may indicate production of purple dye there from at least the 18th century BC. Additional archaeological evidence can be found from samples originating from excavations at the extensive Iron Age copper smelting site of “Slaves’ Hill” (Site 34), which is tightly dated by radiocarbon to the late 11th–early 10th centuries BC. Findings from this site include evidence of the use of purple dye found in stains used on pot shards. Evidence of the use of dye in pottery are found in most cases on the upper part of ceramic basins, on the inside surface, the areas in which the reduced dye-solution was exposed to air, and underwent oxidation that turned it purple.

The production of &quot;Murex&quot; purple for the Byzantine court came to an abrupt end with the sack of Constantinople in 1204, the critical episode of the Fourth Crusade. David Jacoby concludes that &quot;no Byzantine emperor nor any Latin ruler in former Byzantine territories could muster the financial resources required for the pursuit of murex purple production. On the other hand, murex fishing and dyeing with genuine purple are attested for Egypt in the tenth to 13th centuries.&quot; By contrast, Jacoby finds that there are no mentions of purple fishing or dyeing, nor trade in the colorant in any Western source, even in the Frankish Levant. The European West turned instead to vermilion provided by the insect &quot;Kermes vermilio&quot;, known as &quot;grana&quot;, or crimson.

In 1909, Harvard anthropologist Zelia Nuttall compiled an intensive comparative study on the historical production of the purple dye produced from the carnivorous murex snail, source of the royal purple dye valued higher than gold in the ancient Near East and ancient Mexico. Not only did the people of ancient Mexico use the same methods of production as the Phoenicians, they also valued murex-dyed cloth above all others, as it appeared in codices as the attire of nobility. &quot;Nuttall noted that the Mexican murex-dyed cloth bore a &quot;disagreeable ... strong fishy smell, which appears to be as lasting as the color itself.&quot; Likewise, the ancient Egyptian &quot;Papyrus of Anastasi&quot; laments: &quot;The hands of the dyer reek like rotting fish&quot;. So pervasive was this stench that the Talmud specifically granted women the right to divorce any husband who became a dyer after marriage.

In 2021, archaeologists found surviving wool fibers dyed with royal purple in the Timna Valley in Israel. The find, which was dated to , constituted the first direct evidence of fabric dyed with the pigment from antiquity.

==Murex purple production in North Africa==
Murex purple was a very important industry in many Phoenician territories and Carthage was no exception. Traces of this once very lucrative industry are still visible in many Punic sites such as Kerkouane, Zouchis, Djerba and even in Carthage itself. According to Pliny, Meninx (today&#x27;s Djerba) produced the best purple in Africa which was also ranked second only after Tyre&#x27;s. It was found also at Essaouira (Morocco). The Royal purple or Imperial purple was probably used until the time of Augustine of Hippo (354–430) and before the demise of the Roman Empire.

==Dye chemistry==

Variations in colours of &quot;Tyrian purple&quot; from different snails are related to the presence of indigo dye (blue), 6-bromoindigo (purple), and the red 6,6&#x27;-dibromoindigo. Additional changes in colour can be induced by debromination from light exposure (as is the case for Tekhelet) or by heat processing. The final shade of purple is decided by chromatogram, which can be identified by high performance liquid chromatography analysis in a single measurement: indigotin (IND) and indirubin (INR). The two are found in plant sources such as woad (&quot;Isatis tinctoria L&quot;.) and the indigo plant (&quot;Indigofera tinctoria L&quot;), as well as in several species of shellfish.

In 1998, by means of a lengthy trial and error process, a process for dyeing with Tyrian purple was rediscovered. This finding built on reports from the 15th century to the 18th century and explored the biotechnology process behind woad fermentation. It is hypothesized that an alkaline fermenting vat was necessary. An incomplete ancient recipe for Tyrian purple recorded by Pliny the Elder was also consulted. By altering the percentage of sea salt in the dye vat and adding potash, he was able to successfully dye wool a deep purple colour.

Recent research in organic electronics has shown that Tyrian purple is an ambipolar organic semiconductor. Transistors and circuits based on this material can be produced from sublimed thin-films of the dye. The good semiconducting properties of the dye originate from strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding that reinforces pi stacking necessary for transport.

==Modern hue rendering==
True Tyrian purple, like most high-chroma pigments, cannot be accurately rendered on a standard RGB computer monitor. Ancient reports are also not entirely consistent, but these give a rough indication of the likely range in which it appeared:

_________ 
_________

The lower one is the sRGB colour #990024, intended for viewing on an output device with a gamma of 2.2. It is a representation of RHS colour code 66A, which has been equated to &quot;Tyrian red&quot;, a term which is often used as a synonym for Tyrian purple.

==Philately==
The colour name &quot;Tyrian plum&quot; is popularly given to a British postage stamp that was prepared, but never released to the public, shortly before the death of King Edward VII in 1910.

<text>The Stour Estuary is a nature reserve in Essex, England, east of Colchester on the estuary of the River Stour, managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB).

The reserve is unusual in that it consists of two divergent habitat types: intertidal mudflats (fringed by saltmarsh and estuarine reeds), and 130 acres (0.5 km2) of deciduous woodland, mainly oak and coppiced sweet chestnut.

The estuary is important as a breeding, roosting and wintering site for many waterfowl and other birds, including woodpeckers, nightingale, blackcap, common whitethroat, sedge warbler, reed warbler, European wigeon, common shelduck, northern pintail, common teal, dark-bellied brant goose, grey plover, common redshank, Eurasian curlew, dunlin and black-tailed godwit.

Mammals to be seen include red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), badger (&quot;Meles meles&quot;), grey squirrel (&quot;Sciurus carolinensis&quot;) and hazel dormouse (&quot;Muscardinus avellanarius&quot;).

Butterflies and rare moths include white admiral (&quot;Limenitis camilla&quot;), chocolate-tip moth (&quot;Clostera curtula&quot;) and peach blossom moth (&quot;Thyatira batis&quot;).

In the Spring, the woodland floor is covered with wood anemones creating a spectacular display.

The Stour Estuary is the focus of Arthur Ransome&#x27;s 1939 children&#x27;s novel, &quot;Secret Water&quot;.

<text>Miss Universe is an annual international major beauty pageant that is run by a Thailand and Mexican-based Miss Universe Organization. Along with Miss World, Miss International, and Miss Earth, it is one of the Big Four beauty pageants.

The Miss Universe Organization and its brand, is currently owned by JKN Global Group and Legacy Holding Group USA Inc., an American division of Mexican company Legacy Holding through the joint venture company JKN Legacy Inc. Telemundo has the licensing rights to air the pageant through 2023. The pageant&#x27;s advocacy is &quot;humanitarian issues and is a voice to affect positive change in the world.&quot;

The current Miss Universe is Victoria Kjær Theilvig of Denmark who was crowned on November 16, 2024 in Mexico City, Mexico.

==History==
The title &quot;Miss Universe&quot; was first used by the International Pageant of Pulchritude in 1926. This contest was held annually until 1935, when the Great Depression and other events preceding World War II led to its demise.

The current Miss Universe pageant was founded in 1952 by Pacific Knitting Mills, a California-based clothing company and manufacturer of Catalina Swimwear, and has since been headquartered in the United States. The company was the sponsor of the Miss America pageant until 1951, when the winner, Yolande Betbeze, refused to pose for publicity pictures wearing one of their swimsuits. In 1952, Pacific Knitting Mills organized the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants, co-sponsoring them for decades to follow.

The first Miss Universe Pageant was held in Long Beach, California in 1952. It was won by Armi Kuusela from Finland, who gave up her title, though not officially, to get married shortly before her year was completed. Until 1958, the Miss Universe title, like that of Miss America, was dated by the year following the contest, so at the time Kuusela&#x27;s title was Miss Universe 1953. Since its founding by Pacific Mills, the pageant has been organized and conducted by the Miss Universe Organization. Eventually, Pacific Mills and its subsidiaries were acquired by the Kayser-Roth Corporation. 

The pageant was first televised in 1955. CBS began broadcasting the combined Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants in 1960, and as separate contests in 1965. Eventually, Gulf and Western Industries bought the Kayser-Roth Corporation in 1975 which also acquired the Miss Universe pageant until 1991 when it was bought by Procter &amp; Gamble. 

In 1996, Donald Trump bought the pageant from ITT Corp, with a broadcasting arrangement with CBS until 2002. During this time, in 1998, Miss Universe, Inc. changed its name to the Miss Universe Organization, and moved its headquarters from Los Angeles to New York City. By late 2002, Trump entered into a joint venture with NBC, which in 2003 outbid the other markets for the TV rights. From 2003 to 2014, the pageant was broadcast in the United States on NBC.

In June 2015, NBC cancelled all business relationships with Trump and the Miss Universe Organization in response to controversial statements about illegal immigrants who crossed the border from Mexico. As part of the legal settlement, in September 2015, Trump bought out NBC&#x27;s 50% stake in the company, making him the company&#x27;s sole owner. Three days later, he sold the whole company to WME/IMG. Following the change of ownership, in October 2015, Fox and Azteca became the official broadcasters of the Miss Universe and Miss USA pageants. The broadcast rights to the Miss Universe Pageant was temporarily split between Telemundo and FYI during the 2020 pageant. amidst COVID-19 pandemic restrictions at the time. The contract with Fox and then-emcee Steve Harvey was resumed for the 2021 edition.

On October 26, 2022, Thailand-based JKN Global Group acquired Miss Universe Organization (MUO) from Endeavor Group Holdings-owned IMG Worldwide at $14 million, making Anne Jakapong Jakrajutatip the first transgender woman to own the organization and marking the first time the organization expands its headquarters outside the U.S. From the 2022 edition onwards, NBC has re-acquired broadcast rights via The Roku Channel for the competition as a result of the ownership changes, marking the first time in Miss Universe history that the pageant has transitioned from traditional broadcast network coverage to full streaming service in the United States.

On November 16, 2023, Paula Shugart, president of the Miss Universe Organization, announced her departure from the Miss Universe Organization. The aforementioned position will not be replaced. Following the departure of Shugart, CEO of the Miss Universe Organization Amy Emmerich also announced her departure on 8 February 2024 and left the organization on 1 March 2024.

==Contestant selection==

To gain participation in Miss Universe, a country needs a local company or person to buy the local rights of the competition through a franchise fee. The fee includes the rights of image, brand and everything related to the pageant. Often the owner of the franchise returns the franchise to the Miss Universe Organization, which resells it to a new stakeholder. The reselling of the franchise from one owner to the next is recurrently common in the history of the event, sometimes for contractual breaches or financial reasons. The number of participants fluctuates annually because of the franchising of the pageant paired with conflicting schedules to the regular calendar, but has steadied above 70 countries since 1989.

Usually a country&#x27;s candidate selection involves pageants in the nation&#x27;s local subdivisions, where local winners compete in a national pageant, but there are some countries who opt for an internal selection. For example, from 2000 to 2004, Australian delegates were chosen by a modeling agency. Although such &quot;castings&quot; are generally discouraged by the Miss Universe Organization, Jennifer Hawkins was chosen to represent the country in Miss Universe in 2004 (where she would eventually win the crown). Australia would eventually reinstate its national pageant for Miss Universe from 2005 onwards.

Recent countries that debuted in the pageant include Cameroon (2020), Bahrain (2021), Bhutan (2022), Pakistan (2023), Belarus, Eritrea, Guinea, Iran, Macau, Maldives, Moldova, North Macedonia, Somalia, United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan (2024). Macau is the latest newcomer and the most recent country to obtain its first ever semifinal placement at Miss Universe, after debuting in 2024 as a semifinalist in the Top 30. 

There have been widespread speculations regarding Saudi Arabia&#x27;s potential entry into the Miss Universe pageant. However, the Miss Universe Organization has officially denied these claims and dispelled any rumors regarding Saudi Arabia&#x27;s participation in the contest. 

Meanwhile, Botswana remains the most recent first-time entry to ever win Miss Universe on its debut year (with Mpule Kwelagobe in 1999), and Denmark is the most recent country to obtain its first ever national win in Miss Universe (with Victoria Kjær Theilvig in 2024).

Cultural barriers, particularly with the swimsuit competition, and the prohibitive franchise fees of the event have prevented some countries like Mozambique from participating. Nevertheless, the Miss Universe Pageant has historically proven popular in regions like the Americas, Africa and Asia, especially in countries like United States, Philippines, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, South Africa, France, Thailand and Indonesia, given their successful track record of multiple semifinal appearances in the last decade and combined multiple titles in the competition&#x27;s history. , only two countries have been present at every Miss Universe since its inception in 1952: Canada and France.

Since 2012, openly transgender women have been allowed to compete as long as they won their national pageants. Six years after this rule went into effect, Angela Ponce of Spain became the first openly transgender candidate to compete in the contest, in the 2018 edition. In 2019, Myanmar&#x27;s Swe Zin Htet became the first openly lesbian woman to compete in Miss Universe. Spain&#x27;s Patricia Yurena Rodríguez is currently the highest-placed LGBT member at Miss Universe, placing second to Venezuela&#x27;s Gabriela Isler in 2013, but did not come out until years after the competition. In 2021, the Philippines&#x27; Beatrice Gomez became the first openly bisexual (and LGBT) contestant to enter the Miss Universe semifinals, after finishing as a finalist in the Top 5 that year. In 2023, Portugal&#x27;s Marina Machete became the first transgender contestant to enter the Miss Universe semifinals, after finishing as a semifinalist in the Top 20.

Previously, official rules had stated that pageant contestants, &quot;must not have ever been married, not had a marriage annulled nor given birth to, or parented a child. The titleholders are also required to remain unmarried throughout their reign.&quot; However, in August 2022, the Miss Universe Organization announced that mothers, married, or pregnant women are eligible to compete in the pageant. The new rule has been instituted since 2023. Accepting married contestants reinvigorates tension between the American-based Miss Universe pageant and the European-based Mrs. Universe pageant, which was previously the only avenue for married women to compete for the Universe title. Later that same year, Colombia&#x27;s Camila Avella became the first candidate to become a mother before clinching a semifinal placement at Miss Universe, after finishing as a finalist in the Top 5. 

Moreover, Miss Universe has always strictly prohibited age fabrication. While the pageant&#x27;s minimum age limit has been set at 18 years old, this presents a problem for several European countries that allow 17-year-old contestants to compete in their pageants. National titleholders under 18 years of age must be replaced by their runner-up or another candidate in the main pageant. In recent years, all Miss Universe candidates have been required to be at least university degree holders or working professionals from the onset of their national pageants. In September 2023, R&#x27;Bonney Gabriel announced that the organization would be dropping the upper age limit. Previously, contestants had to be between 18 and 28 years old by the start of the pageant. Beginning in 2024, &quot;every adult woman in the world will be eligible to compete to be Miss Universe.&quot;

==Main pageant==

Throughout the history of Miss Universe, the main pageant has varied widely in terms of annual scheduling. In the last decade, the Miss Universe competition has been consistently held over a two-week period between early November and late January. Because of television schedule demands (largely as a result of international time zone differences) or conflicting national events happening during the organizing process (such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the Olympics, FIFA World Cup and national elections depending on the hosting country), four editions have been postponed to next year (as with the 2014, 2016, 2020, and 2022 editions). Since the 2022 edition held in New Orleans, United States during the 2023 calendar year, the Miss Universe Organization has regularly announced the hosting nation of the immediate next edition during the live coronation night. The next edition is scheduled for 2024 in Mexico. Between the early 1970s through the late 2000s, the pageant spans a full month (typically between March and June) to allow time for rehearsals, appearances, and the preliminary competition, with the winner being crowned by the previous year&#x27;s titleholder during the final competition.

According to the organizers, the Miss Universe contest is more than a beauty pageant, though they are expected to participate in swimsuit and evening gown competitions. Women aspiring to become Miss Universe must be intelligent, well-mannered, and cultured. If a candidate is unable to perform well during each round, she is often eliminated. Normally, the placements of the candidates are determined by a ranked vote, where each judge ranks each of the candidates individually and within the stipulated rules. In the past, the pageant semifinalists were chosen on a round robin system. Between 2017 and 2019, the semifinalists were selected based on highest scores per continental group followed by the judging panel&#x27;s wildcard list along an extra candidate chosen in popular choice. All preliminary results were reset and a new competition starts with the highest placed positions at the semifinals. From 2020 onwards, the round robin system was reinstated where in each round of the grand final, the group of candidates with the lowest rates are progressively eliminated. However, this criterion has been modified to use weighted averages or with points accumulated by stages from the preliminary competition to coronation night, with the assessment in ascending or descending order. From 2011 to 2014, 2016, 2020 and since 2022, the public can also select another semifinalist via fan-voting. Since the pageant&#x27;s inception, all semifinalists are announced at the beginning of the live telecast regardless of the edition&#x27;s format and if ties occur in the final rounds, the preliminary results are used.

The winner then signs a contract with the Miss Universe Organization that can last at least seven months to more than a full year as per demands of the Miss Universe Organization. The new Miss Universe takes office immediately after the coronation and takes on a public cause in which she becomes the ambassador for a year to spread messages about the control of diseases, peace, and public awareness of AIDS (though the organization&#x27;s more recent humanitarian works have included various causes such as women&#x27;s and ethnic minority rights, along with contemporary racial issues, public health issues and the consequences of global warming). The winner also receives a cash allowance for her entire reign, a New York Film Academy scholarship, a modeling portfolio, beauty products, clothes, shoes, as well as styling, healthcare, and fitness services by different sponsors of the pageant. She also gains exclusive access to events such as fashion shows and opening galas, as well as access to casting calls and modeling opportunities throughout New York City. Between 1996 and 2015, the winner is given the use of a Trump Place apartment in New York City during her reign, which she shares with the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA titleholders. Starting in 2022, the winner and the two runners-up in the Top 3 will shuffle between residences in New York, United States and Bangkok, Thailand.

If the winner, for any reason, cannot fulfill her duties as Miss Universe, the first runner-up takes over. This protocol has happened only once , when Panama&#x27;s Justine Pasek succeeded Russia&#x27;s Oxana Fedorova as Miss Universe in 2002 after the latter&#x27;s dethronement later that same year. Aside from the main winner and her runners-up, special awards are also given to the winners of the Best National Costume, Miss Photogenic, and Miss Congeniality. The Miss Congeniality award is chosen by the delegates themselves. In recent years, Miss Photogenic has been chosen by popular internet vote (the winner used to be chosen by media personnel covering the event), and the winning country for Best National Costume is announced live after the naming of the semifinalists during finals night. Starting in 2024, Continental Queens are announced after the show that will travel with the Miss Universe winner.

==Crowns of Miss Universe==
The crown of Miss Universe has changed twelve times over the course of its 70-year history. 
* The Romanov Imperial Nuptial Crown (1952) was the first crown. It was previously owned by a Russian czar. It contains 1,529 flawless diamonds weighing 300 carats and was insured for US$500,000. It was used to crown Armi Kuusela in 1952.
* The Romanov Diadem Crown (1953), or infamously known as &quot;The Metallic Bronze Crown&quot; due to its solid metallic bronze design, replaced the inaugural crown. Miss Universe 1953 Christiane Martel was the only titleholder to wear it. 
* The Star of the Universe (1954–1960) was named for the star shape at its top. It is made up of approximately 1,000 oriental cultured black pearls set in solid gold and platinum and weighed 1.25 pounds. It was insured for US$500,000.

* The Coventry Crown (1963–2001) was designed by the renowned jeweler Sarah Coventry. She remade the rhinestone crown to feature a female figure holding a scepter as its main centerpiece and it was dubbed &quot;The Lady Crown&quot;. The design was modified in 1973 for the wearer&#x27;s convenience and was popularly known as &quot;The Chandelier Crown&quot;. The cheaper cost of its rhinestone design made it possible to create exact replicas of the crown to be given to outgoing titleholders. In the late 1980’s, the crowns were made by International Gem and Jewelry Show, Inc. Miss Universe 2001 Denise Quinones was its last holder.
* The Mikimoto Phoenix Crown (2002–2007, and 2017–2018) was used for the fifty-first anniversary of the Miss Universe Organization.

Catriona Gray was its last holder in 2019, before it was retired from use.
* The CAO Crown (2008) was used to crown Dayana Mendoza in 2008. It is a tiara designed by Rosalina Lydster and Dang Kim Lien of CAO Fine Jewelry from Vietnam. The crown, valued at US$120,000, was made from a combination of 18K white and yellow gold and has over 1,000 precious stones, including 555 white diamonds (30 carats), 375 cognac diamonds (14 carats), 10 smoky quartz crystals (20 carats), and 19 morganite gemstones (60 carats). The yellow luster of the gold represented the prosperous, thriving economy of Vietnam as symbolized by a Vietnamese crane. However, Mendoza declined to use this crown and insisted on the Mikimoto crown when she crowned Stefanía Fernández as her successor.
* The Diamond Nexus Peace Crown (2009–2013) was the winning crown made by Diamond Nexus Labs. Fans worldwide were given the opportunity to vote online in 2009 to determine which of the Unity, Hope, and Peace Crowns would be the next crown of Miss Universe. The crown is set with 1,371 gemstones, weighing a total of . It contains 544.31 grams of 14K and 18K white gold as well as platinum. In 2010, the top arches of the crown were removed for the wearer&#x27;s convenience. The crown features synthetic rubies to represent Miss Universe&#x27;s HIV/AIDS education and awareness platform. Diamond Nexus Labs was the first ever eco-friendly official jeweler of the Miss Universe Organization and was selected as part of NBC Universal&#x27;s &quot;Green is Universal&quot; initiative.
* The DIC Crown (2014–2016) was used to crown Paulina Vega, Pia Wurtzbach, and Iris Mittenaere. It was produced by Czech company Diamonds International Corporation (DIC) and estimated to be worth US$300,000. The whole production process took approximately four months and required the work of ten artisans. The crown is reminiscent of the Manhattan Skyline and is composed of 311 diamonds, 5 pieces of blue topaz, 198 pieces of blue sapphire, 33 pieces of heat-fired crystals, and 220 grams of 18K white gold. The total weight of the crown is 411 grams. The crown was retired in 2017 due to a copyright infringement and subsequent payment issues between DIC and the Miss Universe Organization.
* The Mouawad Power of Unity Crown (2019–2021) was made by Mouawad Jewelry, who became the new jeweler for the Miss Universe Organization. With an estimated worth of almost US$6 million, the Mouawad crowns are the world&#x27;s most expensive set of pageant crowns on record. From 2019 to 2021, Zozibini Tunzi, Andrea Meza, and Harnaaz Sandhu were crowned with it. The crown consists of a golden canary diamond that weighs 62.83 carats. According to Pascal Mouawad, the crown symbolizes ambition, diversity, community, and beauty. 
* The Mouawad Force for Good Crown (2022–2023) is the second Mouawad crown and was used to crown R&#x27;Bonney Gabriel and Sheynnis Palacios. It holds 110 carats of blue sapphires, 48 carats of white diamonds, and a 45.14 carats royal blue sapphire at its center. 
* The Jewelmer &quot;Lumière de l’Infini&quot; Crown (2024–present), unveiled on 13 November 2024, is designed by Philippine-based luxury jewelry company Jewelmer, known for specializing in golden Philippine South Sea pearls. It was handcrafted by master jewelers through the use of traditional Filipino and French jewelry design and making techniques, particularly the Place Vendôme technique. Each of the golden pearls was harvested and prepared through 377 steps. The design of the crown is meant to encapsulate and evoke the long history of beauty with the Miss Universe Organization and its queens. Its gold and platinum metal foundations resemble those of the waves and the dance of the universe, which are adorned with hundreds of diamonds and 23 golden South Sea pearls. The biggest golden pearl featured at the top-center of the crown represents the sun, bursting with diamond-adorned golden rays. The French &quot;Lumière de l’Infini&quot; translates to &quot;Light of Infinity&quot; (transliterally) and &quot;Shining Infinitely&quot; or &quot;Infinite Brilliance&quot; (contextually).

The &quot;Miss Universe Organization&quot; currently owns and runs the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants. Between 2020 and 2022, it stopped organizing the Miss USA and the Miss Teen USA competitions, when these franchises were operated by Crystle Stewart, until her suspension in October 2022, and as a result, the latter pageants returned to the &quot;Miss Universe Organization&quot;.

Based in New York City and Bangkok, it is currently owned by the Thai JKN Global Group since 26 October 2022, when the former owners WME/IMG sold the pageant. The organization sells television rights to the pageants and pageant organizations in other countries.

Electronic Arts was reportedly developing a video game based on the pageant in 2013, but development status is currently uncertain due to the closure of EA Black Box, the studio allegedly developing the game.

<text>Miss World is the oldest existing international beauty pageant. It was created in the United Kingdom by Eric Morley in 1951. Since his death in 2000, Morley&#x27;s widow, Julia Morley, has co-chaired the pageant. Along with Miss Universe, Miss International, and Miss Earth, it is one of the Big Four beauty pageants.

The current Miss World is Krystyna Pyszková of the Czech Republic who was crowned on 9 March 2024 in Mumbai, India.

==History==
===20th century===
In 1951, Eric Morley organised a bikini contest as part of the Festival of Britain celebrations that he called the Festival Bikini Contest. The event was popular with the press, which dubbed it &quot;Miss World&quot;. The swimsuit competition was intended as a promotion for the bikini, which had only recently been introduced to the market and was still widely regarded as immodest. When the 1951 Miss World pageant winner, Kerstin &quot;Kiki&quot; Hakansson from Sweden, was crowned in a bikini, it added to the controversy.

The pageant was originally planned as a Pageant for the Festival of Britain, but Morley decided to make the Miss World pageant annual. He registered the &quot;Miss World&quot; name as a trademark, and all future pageants were held under that name. But because of the controversy arising from Håkansson&#x27;s crowning in a bikini, countries with religious traditions threatened not to send delegates to future events, and the bikini was condemned by the Pope. Objection to the bikini led to its replacement in all future pageants with more modest swimwear, and from 1976 swimsuits were replaced by evening gowns for the crowning. Håkansson remains the only Miss World crowned in a bikini. In Miss World 2013 all participants wore a one-piece swimsuit plus a traditional sarong below the waist as a compromise with local culture.

Morley announced the Miss World winners in the order No. 3, No. 2 and No. 1. This was intended to keep the tension up, and avoid the anticlimax if Nos. 2 and 3 are announced after the winner.

In 1959, the BBC began to broadcast the pageant. Its popularity grew with the advent of television. During the 1960s and 1970s, Miss World was among the most watched programs of the year on British television. In 1970, the contest in London was disrupted by women&#x27;s liberation protesters armed with flour bombs, stink bombs, and water pistols loaded with ink. The 1970 contest was also controversial when South Africa sent two contestants (one black and one white). Henceforth, South Africa was banned from the contest until apartheid was abolished. More than 18 million people watched the pageant at its peak during the late 1970s and early 1980s.

In the 1980s, the pageant repositioned itself with the slogan &quot;Beauty With a Purpose&quot;, with added tests of intelligence and personality. In 1984, BBC1 controller Michael Grade announced that the corporation would cease to broadcast beauty pageants the next January, after it had shown Miss Great Britain, saying, &quot;I believe these contests no longer merit national air time.&quot; He added, &quot;They are an anachronism in this day and age of equality and verging on the offensive.&quot; Thames Television broadcast Miss World between 1980 and 1988, when ITV dropped it.

During the early 1990s, mainstream television broadcasts of the event declined in popularity after it became &quot;increasingly unfashionable&quot; in the late 1980s. The pageant returned on satellite channel Sky One in 1997, before moving to Channel 5 for three years (1998–2000).

Eric Morley died in 2000, and his wife, Julia, succeeded him as chair of the Miss World organisation.

===21st century===
The first black African Miss World winner, Agbani Darego of Nigeria, was crowned in 2001. As part of its marketing strategy, Miss World came up with a &quot;Vote For Me&quot; television special during that edition, featuring the delegates behind the scenes and on the beach, and allowing viewers to phone in or vote online for their favourites. It also sells broadcasters its Talent, Beach Beauty and Sports events as television specials. ITV broadcast the 2001 pageant from South Africa on digital channel ITV2, with the special airing a week earlier on the main ITV channel.

In 2002, the pageant was slated to host its final in Abuja, Nigeria. This choice was controversial, as a northern Nigerian woman, Amina Lawal, was awaiting death by stoning for adultery under Sharia law there, but Miss World used the publicity surrounding its presence to bring greater global awareness and action to Lawal&#x27;s plight. No British channel agreed to broadcast the event, and there were objections to the contest.

Former Miss World Aishwarya Rai attended the Miss World 2014 ceremony with her husband Abhishek Bachchan, daughter Aaradhya and mother Brinda Rai. The pageant has been broadcast on local TV channel London Live since 2014.

==Miss World Organization==
The Miss World Organization owns and manages the annual Miss World Finals, a competition that has grown into one of the world&#x27;s biggest. Since its launch in 1951, the Miss World organisation has raised more than £1 billion for children&#x27;s charities that help disabled and underprivileged children. Miss World is franchised in more than 100 countries.

===1970s–1990s===
The Miss World pageant has been the target of many controversies since its inception.
* In 1970, feminist protesters threw flour bombs during the live event at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall, momentarily alarming the host, Bob Hope.
* The 1973 winner, Marjorie Wallace, was stripped of her title on 8 March 1974 because she had failed to fulfill the basic requirements of the job. Miss World&#x27;s organizers did not elect someone to serve in her place.
* In 1976, several countries boycotted the pageant because it included both a white and a Black contestant from South Africa. South Africa competed for the last time in 1977, before returning in 1991 as apartheid disintegrated.
* The 1980 winner, Gabriella Brum of Germany, resigned one day after winning, initially claiming her boyfriend disapproved. A few days later it emerged that she had been forced to resign after it was discovered that she had posed naked for a magazine.

===Nigeria 2002===
In the year leading up the finals in Nigeria, several European title holders lobbied their governments and the EU parliament to support Amina Lawal&#x27;s cause. A number of contestants followed the lead of Kathrine Sørland of Norway in boycotting the contest (despite the controversy, Sørland became a semifinalist in both the Miss World and Miss Universe contests), while others, such as Costa Rica, were instructed by their national governments and parliaments not to attend. Among the other boycotting nations were Denmark, Spain, Switzerland, Panama, Belgium and Kenya. There was further controversy over the possibly suspended participation of France and South Africa, which might or might not have been due to the boycott. Lawal asked that contestants not suspend their participation in the contest, saying that it was for the good of her country and that they could, as the representative of Sweden had earlier remarked, make a much stronger case for her on the ground in Nigeria.

Despite the increasing international profile the boycott was garnering in the world press, the contest proceeded in Nigeria after being rescheduled to avoid taking place during Ramadan, with many prominent nations sending delegates. Osmel Sousa of Venezuela, one of the world&#x27;s most influential national directors, said, &quot;there is no question about it [the participation of Miss Venezuela in the contest].&quot; But the trouble did not end there. A &quot;ThisDay&quot; (Lagos, Nigeria) newspaper editorial suggesting that Muhammad would probably have chosen one of his wives from among the contestants had he been alive to see it resulted in inter-religious riots that started on 22 November in which over 200 people were killed in the city of Kaduna and many houses of worship were burned by religious zealots. Because of these riots, the 2002 pageant was moved to London, following widely circulated reports that Canada&#x27;s and Korea&#x27;s representatives had withdrawn from the contest and returned to their respective countries out of safety concerns. A fatwa urging the beheading of the woman who wrote the offending words, Isioma Daniel, was issued in Nigeria, but was declared null and void by the relevant Saudi Arabian authorities. Upon the pageant&#x27;s return to Britain, many of the boycotting contestants chose to attend, including Miss Norway, Kathrine Sørland, who was ironically tipped in the last few days as the favourite for the crown she had previously boycotted.

The eventual winner of the pageant was Azra Akın of Turkey, the first predominantly Muslim country to hold the title since Egypt in 1954.

===Indonesia 2013===

In Miss World 2013, protests by Islamic groups began a few weeks before the contest began, resulting in the pageant&#x27;s finale and all pre-pageant activities being isolated to Hindu-majority Bali.

===China 2015===

<doc id="150344" wikidata="Q7337830" url="?curid=150344" title="River Stour Trust">
<text>The River Stour Trust is a registered charity and waterway restoration group. It was founded in 1968 to protect and enhance the right of the public to navigate the River Stour, Suffolk, England. It is led by volunteers who are dedicated to its aims and objectives of restoring the navigation from Sudbury to the Sea (a distance of approximately 24.5 miles/37 km).

Since its formation, the Trust has restored Flatford and Dedham Locks, Flatford Barge Dock (in association with the National Trust), rescued an original River Stour lighter, and restored the Quay Basin, Gasworks Cut and 19th century Granary Building, which has become the headquarters for the Trust. In 1997, the Trust opened the new Millennium Lock at Great Cornard (creating through navigation from Sudbury to Great Henny) and in 2007, opened its new Visitor &amp; Education Centre (adjacent to Cornard Lock) to offer facilities for visiting schools, other groups and the local community.

Since 2007, Griff Rhys Jones, the well-known actor, director, writer and producer, has been a Vice President of the River Stour Trust. He says, &quot;I am a strong supporter of the River Stour Trust and everything to do with it. The riverway is so beautiful and unspoilt, especially with the wildlife and water-lilies and bullrushes, it is just terrific. It is a great example of why rivers should be open to people...I salute the River Stour Trust for opening the locks...it is supposed to be a river that traffic travels on.”

==Boating on the River Stour==
The River Stour is a statutory navigation and a right to travel by boat along the whole river is still preserved. Almost half of the river is now re-opened for use as a through navigation for boats (from Sudbury to Great Henny on the upper reach and from Stratford St Mary to Brantham on the lower reach). However, the remaining locks, which provided through navigation on the unrestored central section, are largely derelict or have disappeared, and the Trust continues to work towards restoring these and other obstacles to enable boats to navigate the whole river.

Bylaws provide that from Ballingdon bridge (Sudbury) to Great Henny, boats with engines may be used, but are subject to a strict speed limit of 4 mph, which does not create wash or damage to the banks. However, boats with engines are precluded from using the river below Great Henny, unless they were licensed at the time of the Anglian Water Authority Act 1977 (c. i). Currently, only boats light enough to maneuver around many the obstacles may use the river below Great Henny. This restricts most of the river to canoes although, even for such small craft, the river is not sufficiently navigable to allow easy passage along its entire lower section.

River Stour Trust volunteers offer boat trips from Easter to October so that members of the public can enjoy the beauty of Constable country.

==Sudbury to the Sea==
Every year the Trust organises the Sudbury to the Sea event. Canoes, kayaks and small boats take part in the two-day event, which covers the non-tidal length of the river. The event starts at the Trust Headquarters (The Granary) in Sudbury, with lunch at Bures and an overnight camp at Wissington. The second day takes the participants through Stratford St Mary where the Trust is restoring the lock, and on through the heart of Constable Country via Dedham and Flatford before ending at Cattawade. The event attracts between 200 and 300 boats. While the Trusts event celebrates this scenic navigation with a &#x27;party&#x27; vibe, those seeking a more tranquil experience are able to paddle the navigation at any time of the year using their own boats (subject to possession of an EA License) or with any of the hire operators working along the river including; Outdoor Hire Centre Network who offer self-guided trips and River Stour Boating CIC who offer guided trips.

==Stratford Lock==
The lock at Stratford St Mary was restored over a period of more than 10 years and completed in 2018.
It is accessible from the village of Stratford St Mary by a footpath which starts near the wier.

<text>Waterway restoration is the activity of restoring a canal or river, including special features such as warehouse buildings, locks, boat lifts, and boats.

In the United Kingdom, Canada, and United States, the focus of waterway restoration is on improving navigability, while in Australia the term may also include improvements to water quality.

==Waterway restoration in Canada==
===Shubenacadie Canal===
The Shubenacadie Canal Commission was formed in 1986 to oversee the future of this waterway. Locks three and five have been restored, water levels in the connecting lakes have been stabilized and a visitor center opened. The ten-year business plan for 2007-2016 aims to save four more locks and rebuild four water control structures to make the route open for small boats from Lake Banook to the village of Shubenacadie.

===Soulanges Canal===
The Soulanges Canal closed in 1958. Today there are plans to reopen the canal to pleasure boats. The mission of the Régie intermunicipale du canal de Soulanges is to manage the development of tourism development as part of the reopening of the canal.

==Waterway restoration in Finland==
===Suvorov military canals===

Suvorov military canals (Suvorov canals) are series of four open canals on Saimaa Lake in Finland. Apart from the Kutvele canal, the other three canals spent 200 years almost untouched from the early 19th century until 2003, when the Finnish National Board of Antiquities began restoration works on them. Now they have been turned into tourist attractions.

===Tar canals===

The tar canals in Kajaani were canals and locks built to pass the Koivukoski and Ämmäkoski rapids. First used in 1846, the locks were vital in the transportation of wood pine tar to Oulu. The worn-down canals were closed in 1915. The refurbished Ämmäkoski lock was re-opened in 1984, but the Koivukoski canal has been totally dismantled and the site now houses a hydroelectric power plant. The refurbished canal is not used for transport, but in the summertime, tar boat shows are organised for tourists.

==Waterway restoration in the United Kingdom==

Due to competition from the railways and the narrow design of most UK canals (which prevented the carriage of economically sized bulk loads), large parts of the UK&#x27;s canal system were abandoned in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The rise of the leisure industry in the 1950s meant that the complete abandonment of the remaining canals was avoided.

The increasing use of canals for leisure purposes led some people to consider restoring some of those that had been abandoned. At first, progress was slow due to the lack of funding, with most of the work having to be done manually by volunteers.

As the leisure industry grew, the economic benefits of having a canal became more apparent and some state funding started to appear. At the same time, public interest increased the size of various volunteer groups.

At the present time, canal restoration in the UK is carried out by a mixture of volunteers and professionals working on a large variety of projects.

<text>A subculture is a group of people within a cultural society that differentiates itself from the values of the conservative, standard or dominant culture to which it belongs, often maintaining some of its founding principles. Subcultures develop their own norms and values regarding cultural, political, and sexual matters. Subcultures are part of society while keeping their specific characteristics intact. Examples of subcultures include BDSM, hippies, hipsters (which include 1940s original parent subculture and nipster), goths, steampunks, bikers, punks, skinheads, gopnik, hip-hoppers, metalheads, cosplayers, otaku, otherkin, furries, hackers and more. The concept of subcultures was developed in sociology and cultural studies. Subcultures differ from countercultures.

==Definitions==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines subculture, in regards to sociological and cultural anthropology, as &quot;an identifiable subgroup within a society or group of people, esp. one characterized by beliefs or interests at variance with those of the larger group; the distinctive ideas, practices, or way of life of such a subgroup.&quot; Some subcultures are formed by members with characteristics or preferences that differ from the majority of society, who generally have a preference for body modifications such as tattoos, punctures, and certain forms of plastic surgery.

Unlike mainstream social relationships, subcultural communities are characterized by transience, informality, and a lack of typical social kinship relationships.

As early as 1950, David Riesman distinguished between a majority, &quot;which passively accepted commercially provided styles and meanings, and a &#x27;subculture&#x27; which actively sought a minority style ... and interpreted it in accordance with subversive values&quot;. In his 1979 book &quot;&quot;, Dick Hebdige argued that a subculture is a subversion to normalcy. He wrote that subcultures can be perceived as negative due to their nature of criticism to the dominant societal standard. Hebdige argued that subculture brings together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.

In 1995, Sarah Thornton, drawing on Pierre Bourdieu, described &quot;subcultural capital&quot; as the cultural knowledge and commodities acquired by members of a subculture, raising their status and helping differentiate themselves from members of other groups. In 2007, Ken Gelder proposed to distinguish subcultures from countercultures based on the level of immersion in society. Gelder further proposed six key ways in which subcultures can be identified through their:
# often negative relations to work (as &#x27;idle&#x27;, &#x27;parasitic&#x27;, at play or at leisure, etc.);
# negative or ambivalent relation to class (since subcultures are not &#x27;class-conscious&#x27; and do not conform to traditional class definitions);
# association with territory (the &#x27;street&#x27;, the &#x27;hood&#x27;, the club, etc.), rather than property;
# movement out of the home and into non-domestic forms of belonging (i.e. social groups other than the family);
# stylistic ties to excess and exaggeration (with some exceptions);
# refusal of the banalities of ordinary life and massification.

Sociologists Gary Alan Fine and Sherryl Kleinman argued that their 1979 research showed that a subculture is a group that serves to motivate a potential member to adopt the artifacts, behaviors, norms, and values characteristic of the group.

Contemporary subcultures typically refer to popular culture, including animation, comics, video games, and popular music.

==History of studies==
The evolution of subcultural studies has three main steps:

===Subcultures and deviance===
The earliest sociological studies on subcultures came from the so-called Chicago School, who interpreted them as forms of deviance and delinquency. Starting with what they called Social Disorganization Theory, they claimed that subcultures emerged on one hand because of some population sectors&#x27; lack of socialization with the mainstream culture and, on the other, because of their adoption of alternative axiological and normative models. As Robert E. Park, Ernest Burgess, and Louis Wirth suggested, by means of selection and segregation processes, there thus appear in society &quot;natural areas&quot; or &quot;moral regions&quot; where deviant models concentrate and are re-inforced; they do not accept objectives or means of action offered by the mainstream culture, proposing different ones in their place—thereby becoming, depending on circumstances, innovators, rebels, or retreatists (Richard Cloward and Lloyd Ohlin).

Subcultures, however, are not only the result of alternative action strategies but also of labelling processes on the basis of which, as Howard S. Becker explains, society defines them as outsiders. As Cohen clarifies, every subculture&#x27;s style, consisting of image, demeanour and language becomes its recognition trait. And an individual&#x27;s progressive adoption of a subcultural model will furnish him/her with growing status within this context but it will often, in tandem, deprive him/her of status in the broader social context outside where a different model prevails. Cohen used the term &#x27;Corner Boys&#x27; which were unable to compete with their better secured and prepared peers. These lower-class youths didn&#x27;t have equal access to resources, resulting in the status of frustration, marginalization, and search for a solution.

===Subcultures and resistance===
In the work of John Clarke, Stuart Hall, Tony Jefferson, and Brian Roberts of the Birmingham CCCS (Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies), subcultures are interpreted as forms of resistance. Society is seen as being divided into two fundamental classes, the working class and the middle class, each with its own class culture, and middle-class culture being dominant. Particularly in the working class, subcultures grow out of the presence of specific interests and affiliations around which cultural models spring up, in conflict with both their parents&#x27; culture and mainstream culture. Subcultural groups emphasize voluntary, informal, and organic subordinate relationships formed in unregulated street public spaces. Facing a weakening of class identity, subcultures are then new forms of collective identification, expressing what Cohen defined &quot;symbolic resistance&quot; against the mainstream culture and developing imaginary solutions for structural problems. However, the Birmingham School believes that the symbolic rejection of mainstream bourgeois lifestyles by subcultures is illusory.

As Paul Willis and Dick Hebdige underline, identity and resistance in subcultures are expressed through the development of a distinctive style which, by a re-signification and &quot;bricolage&quot; operation, use cultural goods and services as standardized products to buy and consume, in order to communicate and express one&#x27;s own conflict. Yet the culture industry is often capable of re-absorbing the components of such a style and once again transforming them into consumer goods for the mass society. At the same time the mass media, while they participate in building subcultures by broadcasting their images, also weaken subcultures by depriving them of their subversive content or by spreading a socially stigmatized image of them and their members.

===Subcultures and distinction===
The most recent interpretations see subcultures as forms of distinction. In an attempt to overcome the idea of subcultures as forms of deviance or resistance, they describe subcultures as collectivities which, on a cultural level, are sufficiently homogeneous internally and heterogeneous with respect to the outside world to be capable of developing, as Paul Hodkinson points out, consistent distinctiveness, identity, commitment and autonomy. Defined by Sarah Thornton as taste cultures, subcultures are endowed with elastic, porous borders, and are inserted into relationships of interaction and mingling, rather than independence and conflict, with the cultural industry and mass media, as Steve Redhead and David Muggleton emphasize. The very idea of a unique, internally homogeneous, dominant culture is explicitly criticized. Thus forms of individual involvement in subcultures are fluid and gradual, differentiated according to each actor&#x27;s investment, outside clear dichotomies. The ideas of different levels of subcultural capital (Sarah Thornton) possessed by each individual, of the supermarket of style (Ted Polhemus) and of style surfing (Martina Böse) replace that of the subculture&#x27;s insiders and outsiders – with the perspective of subcultures supplying resources for the construction of new identities going beyond strong, lasting identifications.

==Identifying==
The study of subcultures often consists of the study of symbolism attached to clothing, music, hairstyles, jewellery, and other visible affectations by members of subcultures, and also of the ways in which these same symbols are interpreted by members of the dominant culture. Dick Hebdige writes that members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, , and argot.
Subcultures can exist at all levels of organizations, highlighting the fact that there are multiple cultures or value combinations usually evident in any one organization that can complement but also compete with the overall organisational culture. In some instances, subcultures have been legislated against, and their activities regulated or curtailed. British youth subcultures had been described as a moral problem that ought to be handled by the guardians of the dominant culture within the post-war consensus.

==Relationships with mainstream culture==
It may be difficult to identify certain subcultures because their style (particularly clothing and music) may be adopted by mass culture for commercial purposes. Businesses often seek to capitalize on the subversive allure of subcultures in search of &quot;Cool&quot;, which remains valuable in the selling of any product. This process of cultural appropriation may often result in the death or evolution of the subculture, as its members adopt new styles that appear alien to mainstream society.

Music-based subcultures are particularly vulnerable to this process; what may be considered subcultures at one stage in their historiessuch as jazz, goth, punk, hip hop, and rave culturesmay represent mainstream taste within a short period. Even religious groups can be seen as subcultures. In his research on British punk rock in the late 1970s, Hebdige proposed a controversial proposition at the time: punk portrayed the entire history of post-war working-class youth culture in a &quot;cut&quot; form, blending elements that originally belonged to completely different eras. Some subcultures reject or modify the importance of style, stressing membership through the adoption of an ideology which may be much more resistant to commercial exploitation. The punk subculture&#x27;s distinctive (and initially shocking) style of clothing was adopted by mass-market fashion companies once the subculture became a media interest. Dick Hebdige argues that the punk subculture shares the same &quot;radical aesthetic practices&quot; as the Dadaist and Surrealist art movements:

Like Duchamp&#x27;s &#x27;ready mades&#x27; - manufactured objects which qualified as art because he chose to call them such, the most unremarkable and inappropriate items - a pin, a plastic clothes peg, a television component, a razor blade, a tampon - could be brought within the province of punk (un)fashion ... Objects borrowed from the most sordid of contexts found a place in punks&#x27; ensembles; lavatory chains were draped in graceful arcs across chests in plastic bin liners. Safety pins were taken out of their domestic &#x27;utility&#x27; context and worn as gruesome ornaments through the cheek, ear or lip ... fragments of school uniform (white bri-nylon shirts, school ties) were symbolically defiled (the shirts covered in graffiti, or fake blood; the ties left undone) and juxtaposed against leather drains or shocking pink mohair tops.
== Urban tribes ==

In 1985, French sociologist Michel Maffesoli coined the term &quot;urban tribe&quot; or neotribalism. It gained widespread use after the publication of his &quot;The Time of the Tribes&quot; (1988). In 1996, this book was published in English. According to Maffesoli, neo tribes are microgroups of people who share common interests in urban areas. The members of these relatively small groups tend to have similar worldviews, dress styles and behavioral patterns. Their social interactions are largely informal and emotionally laden, different from late capitalism&#x27;s corporate-bourgeoisie cultures, based on dispassionate logic. Maffesoli claims that punks are a typical example of an &quot;urban tribe&quot;.

In the context of consumer culture, the notion of consumer tribes indicate ephemeral groups of individuals that often share a common interest and a share a subculture. Unlike traditional tribes that share kinship and language, consumer tribes are elective and ephemeral because they disperse without necessarily building long-term relationships. Consumer tribes often fluctuate around a common hobby or interest but lack permanent social bonds to become a brand community.

== Sexual and gender identity-based subcultures ==


The sexual revolution of the 1960s led to a countercultural rejection of the established sexual and gender norms in the Western world, particularly in the urban areas of Europe, North and South America, Australia, and white South Africa. A more permissive social environment in these areas led to a proliferation of &quot;sexual subcultures&quot;—cultural expressions of non-normative sexuality. As with other subcultures, sexual subcultures adopted certain styles of fashion and gestures to distinguish themselves from mainstream Western culture.

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people express themselves through the LGBT culture, considered the largest sexual subculture of the 20th and 21st centuries. With the ever-increasing acceptance of homosexuality in the early 21st century, including its expressions in fashion, music, and design, the gay culture can no longer be considered a subculture in many parts of the world, although some aspects of gay culture like leathermen, bears, and chubs are considered subcultures within the gay movement itself. The butch and femme identities or roles among some lesbians also engender their own subculture with stereotypical attire, for instance drag kings. A late 1980s development, the queer movement can be considered a subculture broadly encompassing those that reject normativity in sexual behavior, and who celebrate visibility and activism. The wider movement coincided with growing academic interests in queer studies and queer theory.

Aspects of sexual subcultures can vary along other cultural lines. For instance, in the United States, &quot;down-low&quot; is a slang term specifically used within the African-American community to refer to Black men who usually identify as heterosexual but actively seek sexual encounters and relations with other men, practice gay cruising, and frequently adopt a specific hip-hop attire during these activities. They avoid sharing this information even if they have female sexual partner(s), they are married to a woman, or they are single.

==Social media==
In a 2011 study, Brady Robards and Andy Bennett said that online identity expression has been interpreted as exhibiting subcultural qualities. However, they argue it is more in line with neotribalism than with what is often classified as subculture. Social networking websites are quickly becoming the most used form of communication and means to distribute information and news. They offer a way for people with similar backgrounds, lifestyles, professions or hobbies to connect. According to a co-founder and executive creative strategist for RE-UP, as technology becomes a &quot;life force,&quot; subcultures become the main bone of contention for brands as networks rise through cultural mash-ups and phenomenons. Where social media is concerned, there seems to be a growing interest among media producers to use subcultures for branding. This is seen most actively on social network sites with user-generated content, such as YouTube.

Subcultures can be and have been successfully targeted by firms commercially. A stream of academic research in consumer culture shows the multiple ways in which companies and firms target subcultures with commercial offerings.

==Discrimination==
Discrimination-based harassment and violence are sometimes directed towards a person or group based on their culture or subculture. In the United States and the United Kingdom, the concept of subculture has always been the main explanatory tool for sociological and criminological understanding of deviant behavior. In 2013, the Greater Manchester Police in the United Kingdom began to classify attacks on subcultures such as goths, emos, punks, and metalheads as hate crimes, in the same way they record abuse against people because of their religion, race, disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity. The decision followed the murder of Sophie Lancaster and beating of her boyfriend in 2007, who were attacked because they were goths. In 2012, human rights activists have denounced the occurrence of emo killings in Iraq, which consisted of between at least 6 and up to 70 teenage boys who were kidnapped, tortured, and murdered in Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq, due to being targeted because they dressed in a &quot;Westernized&quot; emo style.

<doc id="150362" wikidata="Q2001027" url="?curid=150362" title="River Orwell">
<text>The River Orwell flows through the county of Suffolk in England from Ipswich to Felixstowe. Above Ipswich, the river is known as the River Gipping, but its name changes to the Orwell at Stoke Bridge, about half a mile below where the river becomes tidal by Bobby Robson Bridge on West End Road. It broadens into an estuary at Ipswich, where the Ipswich dock has operated since the 7th century, and then flows into the North Sea at Felixstowe, the UK&#x27;s largest container port, after joining the River Stour at Shotley forming Harwich harbour.

The large Orwell Bridge carries the A14 trunk road over the estuary to the south of Ipswich.

==Name==
In the name &quot;Orwell&quot;, &quot;Or-&quot; comes from an ancient river-name—probably pre-Celtic; but &quot;-well&quot; probably indicates an Anglo-Saxon naming. In &quot;A tour through England and Wales&quot;, written in 1722, Daniel Defoe calls the river &quot;Orwel&quot; (though he does this inconsistently). He also mentions that &quot;a traveller will hardly understand me, especially a seaman, when I speak of the River Stour and the River Orwell at Harwich, for they know them by no other names than those of Maningtre-Water, and Ipswich-Water&quot;. The writer Eric Blair chose the pen name under which he would later become famous, &quot;George Orwell,&quot; because of his love for the river.
A few miles north of the Orwell is another Suffolk river, the Ore, and Orfordness, the village port of Orford with its historic castle.

==Estuary==
The estuary flows through different sections as it makes its way down from Ipswich to the sea:

===Freston Reach===
Redgate Hard is located here. This hard is probably post medieval.


===Downham Reach===
A whale was beached on Downham Reach around 1816.


===Potters Reach===

===Lower Reach===
At this point the Stour flows into the Orwell by Shotley Point.

==Sailing==
The Orwell provides a popular venue for sailing. Interest originally centred on the hamlet of Pin Mill (featured in two children&#x27;s novels by Arthur Ransome: &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Mean To Go To Sea&quot; and &quot;Secret Water&quot;), which is home to the Pin Mill Sailing Club and its Hard. Ransome had kept his yacht &quot;Selina King&quot; at the Pin Mill anchorage in 1937–39.

Since the 1970s marinas have opened at Levington (Suffolk Yacht Harbour, pictured), Woolverstone, Fox&#x27;s (just outside Ipswich), and two marinas in the old Ipswich Wet Dock. Woolverstone is home to the Royal Harwich Yacht Club that was for many years host to the Swordfish 15-foot racing dinghy built by Fairey Marine, in addition to its 12-foot Firefly, a derivative of the National 12-foot dinghy, both designed by the sailor Uffa Fox. It now hosts a broad range of sailing events, such as the annual &#x27;Junior Race Week&#x27;.

==Ipswich Barrier==
Ipswich has in the past been affected by flooding, both fluvial flooding from water passing down the river Gipping, and tidal flooding from tidal surges passing up the estuary of the Orwell, with the river becoming much narrower near to the entrance to Ipswich Docks. In order to reduce this risk, the Environment Agency implemented a programme of works expected to cost a total of £58 million to improve the flood defences on both banks of the tidal river and of the Port of Ipswich. The work included the construction of the Ipswich tidal barrier, and because the work affected the right of navigation on the New Cut, the section of the Orwell immediately above the barrier site, it required an order to be issued under the Transport and Works Act 1992. The Ipswich Barrier Order was issued by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in August 2012.

The barrier consists of a rising sector gate, wide and high, located just to the west of the entrance to the wet dock. In November 2014, a contract for £28 million was awarded to VBA, a joint venture between VolkerStevin, Boskalis Westminster and Atkins, for construction of the barrier and associated flood defences on the banks of the river. The barrier is designed to prevent tidal surges passing further up stream, and to enable downstream fluvial flows to be controlled. It provides better flood protection to some 1,500 homes and 400 business properties. The river at the barrier site was wide, but in order to allow the construction of the barrier and the commissioning of the gate, a large cofferdam, square, extending downwards into the chalk bed of the river, was formed against the east bank. This left a much narrower channel to allow the river flows to reach the estuary and boats to continue to access the river above the barrier site.

The sector gate was designed by the German firm IRS, and was manufactured in Holland by Hollandia. Once assembled, it was floated across the North Sea, and lifted into the concrete support structure by a 600 tonne crane. The position of the gate is moved by two hydraulic cylinders, and it can be positioned to prevent a tidal surge passing up stream, or to regulate the downstream flow of the river. The concrete structure was tied in to the eastern bank early in the project, but ties to the western bank had to wait until the gate had been commissioned. At that point, both the flow of the river and boats could pass through the new structure, and the side channel could be blocked off. The new barrier was officially opened in early February 2019 by Therese Coffey, Floods Minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, by which time the cost of the project had risen to £67.4 million. While most of the funding came from the Environment Agency, some was also provided by Ipswich Borough Council, the New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership, the Regional Flood and Coastal Committee, and UK Power Networks.

==&quot;The Yangtse Incident&quot;==
The 1957 film &quot;Yangtse Incident: The Story of HMS Amethyst&quot; was filmed on the river. The naval shore establishment at HMS Ganges also featured in the film being used as a site for Chinese gun batteries.

<text>The River Gipping is the source river for the River Orwell in the county of Suffolk in East Anglia, England, which is named from the village of Gipping, and which gave its name to the former Gipping Rural District. It rises near Mendlesham Green and flows in a south-westerly direction to reach Stowmarket. From there it flows towards the south or south east, passing through Needham Market then Baylham. The river continues to flow south between Great Blakenham and Claydon, and through Bramford and Sproughton until it flows into Ipswich, where it becomes the Orwell at Stoke Bridge. The river has supplied power to a number of watermills, several of which are still standing. None are operational, although the mill at Baylham retains most of its machinery, and is the only complete mill on the river.

There is evidence that the river was used for navigation in the thirteenth and seventeenth centuries, but in 1790 the Ipswich and Stowmarket Navigation Act 1790 (30 Geo. 3. c. 57) was obtained to enable the river to be improved from Ipswich to Stowmarket. This was achieved by building 15 locks, and the river was then known as the Stowmarket Navigation. The navigation was opened in 1793, and although few records were kept of income and expenditure, the enterprise appears to have been profitable. In 1819, there was talk of expansion, but nothing came of the plans. In the 1840s, as railways arrived in the area, the Trustees negotiated with the Eastern Union Railway, and the navigation was leased to them for 42 years. At the end of the lease, it was in a poor state, despite the fact that the railway had a legal duty to maintain it.

Traffic to Stowmarket never recovered, but there was some traffic through the lower four locks, with barges serving the Fison&#x27;s and Packard&#x27;s fertiliser factories at Bramford. By 1917, it was no longer economical to keep it open, and it closed in 1922, although a formal closing order was not obtained until the early 1930s. After a period of decay, the local branch of the Inland Waterways Association raised the idea of restoring it. The River Gipping Trust now spearhead this work, and several of the lock chambers have been restored, while the Gipping Valley River Path had been established along the towpath. There are many listed buildings along the course of the river, including some of the locks and bridges (Creeting lock and bridge and Baylham lock and bridge) several of the mill buildings and Fison&#x27;s fertiliser warehouse at Bramford, which has been severely damaged by a fire leaving just a skeleton.

==Early use of the River Gipping==

Early recorded use of the river includes the transporting of stone which was used in the rebuilding of Bury St Edmunds Abbey. The stone was carried in flat-bottomed boats to Rattlesden. Although some sources record that it was Caen stone imported from Normandy, the stone actually came from quarries at Barnack in Northamptonshire, which were owned by the abbot of Peterborough. There is also some confusion about the date of this activity, and whether it was for the original building of the abbey between 1070 and 1095, or for a rebuilding in the 13th century. It is more certain that Stowmarket church bells were recast in the 17th century after being transported down-river.

The first proposal for the construction of the navigation was in 1719, but the traders of Ipswich objected, fearing loss of trade. It was not until 1789 that six local gentlemen (two of whom were vicars) with foresight realised that because of poor transport, due to badly-maintained turnpike roads, the population and industries were dwindling in the Stowmarket area. They engaged William Jessop, who employed Isaac Lenny as the surveyor and a parliamentary bill for the construction of the navigation was introduced on 17 February 1790. It became an act of Parliament as the Ipswich and Stowmarket Navigation Act 1790 (30 Geo. 3. c. 57) on 1 April 1790, and created a board of trustees, consisting of six men. They were empowered to borrow £14,300 to finance the work, and an additional £6,000 if this became necessary. They also had powers to build an extension of the navigation from Stowupland Bridge for to the turnpike road that ran to Bury St Edmunds. An unusual clause in the act prohibited the carrying of fishing tackle by boats using the navigation, for which a fine of £5 could be charged.

==Construction of the navigation==
The first meeting of the new company took place on 19 April 1790, and Jessop was asked to prepare drawings which would form the basis for tenders. The directors also decided to advertise for a surveyor, and on 7 June they appointed James Smith from Reading. They expected the navigation to be finished by October 1791, and so Smith&#x27;s contract only ran until then. At the same meeting they appointed Mr Baynes of Stowmarket to handle legal matters, and Dyson and Pinkerton as contractors. Both were members of civil engineering families, whose careers had developed since the 1760s, and who had collaborated on a number of schemes, making them the first civil engineering contractors. John Dyson Sr had worked with James Pinkerton on the Adlingfleet Drainage scheme, the Driffield Navigation and the Laneham Drainage scheme, but for this project, he worked with George Pinkerton, thought to be one of James&#x27; younger sons.

Work started in 1790 at the Ipswich end of the navigation, but there were problems. Baynes was sacked after less than a month, because of &quot;unaccommodating and improper behaviour&quot;, and in November, Dyson and Pinkerton were dismissed for trespassing on land which did not belong to the trustees. Legal action followed, which caused delays and involved the trustees in extra costs, although some work carried on during the lawsuit. Smith set up a brickworks in January 1791, and a contract to build six locks was awarded to Samuel Wright, millwright, of Ipswich in June. Because of the dispute, the Ipswich end was not sufficiently completed to enable materials to be carried up the navigation, and so they had to be carried overland to enable work on the Stowmarket end to continue. A verdict was reached in the dispute between Dyson and Pinkerton and the trustees on 14 November 1791, but the outcome is unclear.

The trustees next asked the civil engineer John Rennie to assess the state of the project. His inspection was carried out in the presence of the trustees on 13–15 December 1791, and he produced a report within a week. He reported that the section from Stowmarket and Needham Market, the other main town on the waterway, was almost complete, but advised that the towpath would need to be raised in places. There were three turf and timber locks, but he suggested that further locks should be made of brick. He felt that while Jessop had laid out the plans prior to the obtaining of the initial act of Parliament, there had been a failure to adequately survey the river and detail the works that would be required to construct the navigation. He particularly criticised Lenny&#x27;s lack of accuracy, and recommended that a new survey should be made, so that the work needed could be identified.

John Rennie replaced William Jessop as engineer in December 1791 and Richard Coats was appointed surveyor at a salary of £200 p.a. as somebody with knowledge of bricklaying and masonry work. Rennie was appointed chief engineer of the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation in 1793 some 40 miles away and Coat&#x27;s left in October 1793 with a £50 gratuity when he was appointed Rennie&#x27;s resident engineer on a salary of £240 p.a.

Rennie made his next report to the trustees on 23 April 1792. He estimated that £12,762 would be required to finish the work, of which £6,600 would be needed for the remaining 12 locks, which he thought could be built for £550 each. He then inspected the lower river, and agreed that Jessop&#x27;s original site for the junction between the navigation and the River Orwell was the best available. He suggested that the timber locks should be rebuilt, once the navigation began to make a profit, and recommended that another act of Parliament should be obtained, to raise more money. The Ipswich and Stowmarket Navigation Act 1793 (33 Geo. 3. c. 20) was obtained on 28 March 1793, which authorised the trustees to borrow an extra £15,000, as the original capital had all been spent. The final cost of construction was £26,263, which was nearly double the original estimate. The waterway was just under long from Ipswich to Stowmarket, rising through 15 locks of broad construction each , suitable for barges with a draught of . It was opened throughout on 14 September 1793.

===Operation===
The main cargoes on the navigation consisted of agricultural produce which travelled down stream, with coal and other heavy goods travelling in the opposite direction. Initially, there were up to four barges working on the navigation, and tolls for the first year amounted to £460. The number of barges then increased to 10 but frost and flooding in early 1795 caused serious damage, and £1,000 had to be spent on repairs. Despite a short-term fall in income, the tolls for the year ending in July 1795 came to £937. Subsequently, details of receipts were not recorded in the minutes of the Trustees, so are unknown, but they did record that barges were making over 30 trips each week in the early 1800s. Each trip took around seven hours. James Austin was appointed as surveyor in October 1804, but absconded in 1805. The trustees advertised in the Cambridge newspapers, offering a reward of 10 guineas (£10.50) if he could be apprehended and placed in jail.

===Expansion===
During 1791, when the trustees were negotiating with John Rennie, they had asked him to assess an extension of the navigation from Stowmarket to the River Lark at Bury St Edmunds, but this was not pursued. With the navigation thriving, there were two proposals for canals from Ipswich to Eye, Suffolk in 1819. A meeting was held in January at Eye, which was chaired by Charles Cornwallis, 2nd Marquess Cornwallis. It considered two reports, one proposed by the civil engineer William Cubitt, which involved a tunnel through the hills at Mendlesham, with the estimated cost exceeding £100,000, and another, for a canal over the hills, costing £80,000. Both were thought to be too expensive to implement, but a third proposal emerged, for an extension from the River Gipping at Needham Market, which would follow the valley of a tributary through Creeting St Mary to Earl Stonham, where a basin would be built beside the turnpike road (now the A140 road). This would enable waggons to make a round trip from Eye in a single day, rather than the two days that a trip to Ipswich took. The scheme was estimated to cost £12,000, and shares in it were offered at the meeting. Although many were taken up, the scheme did not advance any further.

===Decline===

When the Eastern Union Railway announced plans for an extension from Ipswich to Stowmarket in 1844, the trustees negotiated with the company to lease their canal. They hoped that this would be of benefit to the shareholders, and that it would help the railway by removing one source of opposition to their plans. They submitted a firm proposal for the lease on 8 February 1845, to which the railway agreed, and the shareholders sanctioned the action soon afterwards. They engaged a parliamentary agent to handle the details, who realised that the original act of Parliament, dating from 1790, expressly prohibited the trustees from leasing the canal. By September, the two sides had agreed that each of them would seek to obtain powers to overturn the clause. The railway company would pay £1,070 per year for the first 21 years, and £850 per year for the second 21 years. The trustees sought an act of Parliament to authorise this, which contained a clause requiring the railway company to maintain the navigation. The House of Lords were not convinced that the clause was strong enough, and amended it to ensure that the railway had to maintain it &quot;in as good a state and condition as the same shall be at the time of passing of the Act.&quot; With this amendment in place, the (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. cvi) was passed on 26 June 1846.

Meanwhile, the railway company was obtaining its own act of Parliament, which had initially included a similar clause about maintenance, but this had been dropped by the time the act was passed. The Railway Commissioners voiced their concern that the railway had somehow managed to gain control over a navigation without any of the details being included in their own act. They raised the issue in their report to Parliament in 1847.

The line opened in 1846, and with it came a serious decline in traffic on the navigation. The condition of the waterway declined, and the Railway Commissioners asked the Great Eastern Railway who had taken over the Eastern Union Railway, to repair the defective sections in 1869. When the 42-year period of the lease was close to ending, the two sides met, and the railway declined to extend the lease. The navigation was by this time in a poor condition, with little traffic, but because of the clause in the 1846 act, the railway company offered the trustees £2,000 in lieu of repairs. This was agreed on 5 January 1888, and the money was paid on 23 March.

Trade on the upper part of the navigation to Stowmarket was extremely limited, with just an occasional barge carrying manure to Prentice&#x27;s Manure Works, and returning with guncotton, which was manufactured at an explosives works. There was more traffic between Ipswich and Bramford, as barges regularly worked to Fison&#x27;s and Packard&#x27;s factories. The companies paid lower tolls because they helped to maintain the lock gates and clear weeds from the channel. 30-ton barges were worked through the lower four locks in trains of two dumb barges with a steam-powered barge pulling them. By 1917, the undertaking was virtually bankrupt. Income amounted to around £220 per year, with expenditure running at £480, and there was no capital left. The trustees tried to make economies, but in May 1922, with the current account overdrawn, they resolved to close the navigation from 3 June 1922.

The trustees met again in November 1930, and in 1932 resolved to formally close the navigation. The passing of the Land Drainage Act 1930 meant that they did not need to obtain an act of Parliament to do so, and instead a closing order was obtained under section 41 of that act. The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries confirmed the order on 5 October 1932. A final meeting was held on 16 March 1934, when debts were settled, and the remaining money was split between East Suffolk County Council and the catchment board, who had responsibility for the river under the terms of the Land Drainage Act 1930. All records were passed to the clerk of the catchment board, and the meeting closed with a vote of thanks to the trustees&#x27; own clerk for his commitment over the years. The waterway gradually fell into decay.

==Restoration==
The River Gipping Trust aim to restore navigation once more, restore and improve the towpath and provide recreational and leisure facilities to improve the life and welfare of the areas inhabitants. The Trust are currently working on improving and restoring parts of the towpath between Paper Mill Lock and Badley Lock and concentrating their navigational restoration efforts on the 2.5 mile stretch of river between Needham Market and Baylham with many of the locks fully restored ready for lock gates to be installed. 

Restoration work was started by the Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council, which had been reconstituted by the government in the spring of 1974, the Eastern Region branch of the Inland Waterways Association (IWA) began to take an active role in the improvement of the River Gipping. This cause was highlighted by an article in the December 1979 edition of the waterways magazine &quot;Waterways World&quot;, which showed the state of the navigation, and noted that the long-term aim of the local branch of the IWA was restoration to navigable standards for leisure traffic. Already the group had been clearing the towpath, and this led to the setting up of the &quot;Gipping Valley River Path&quot;, a footpath from Ipswich to Stowmarket which uses the towpath for most of its route. Between 1993 and 2004, members of the IWA worked on the reconstruction of first Bosmere and then Creeting locks. Subsequently, the chamber of Baylham lock has been restored, although no gates have been fitted, and work has been carried out at Pipps Ford to restore a bridge over the tail of the lock and the river channel around the lock.

Claydon lock was destroyed when the A45 road was built. The river at this point was diverted through a new cut, and the remains of the lock lies buried adjacent to the road, which has now become the A14 trunk road. The River Gipping Trust are working with the Highways Agency in establishing what remains of the lock and the possibility of carrying out a feasibility study of the 230 year old lock. Water levels on the river are regulated by various devices. Hawks Mill lock at Needham Market has had an automatic rising sluice gate fitted, while Paper Mill lock incorporates an automatic tilting sluice gate.

In 2007, the Inland Waterways Association decided that it would be better to set up a separate organisation to manage restoration of the navigation, and the River Gipping Trust was formed in May of that year. It is a private company limited by guarantee, and is registered at Companies House with company number 06145692. It is also registered as a charity.

In 2021 The River Gipping Trust restored the original 1793 brick bridge abutments at Baylham and installed a new wooden footbridge platform across the river replacing one last seen at the bottom of the river in 1942. Work continued through 2022 on the wheelchair friendly ramps leading up to the footbridge with a grand opening in May 2023 by local MP Dr Dan Poulter, which enabled 1km of permissive footpath to be opened along the line of the original towpath, not walked for around 100 years.

In 2023 the Trust completed the restoration of Pipps Ford Lock, the fourth lock to be fully restored up to lock gate installation level. Baylham, Creeting and Bosmere being the other three.

==Route==
The source of the River Gipping is in the village of Mendlesham Green. It rises to the north of the village, just above the contour, and is fed by waters drained from fields. It heads towards the south-west, passing under the main street of Mendlesham Green by Green Farm, a grade II listed timber-framed and plastered farmhouse dating from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It continues in the same general direction, passing Great Gipping Wood and Old Newton Hall, both on the north bank. The hall is a grade II* listed structure, dating from 1600 to 1630, with later additions. The joinery in one of the rooms in the left wing is exceptional. By Stonebridge Ford, the river is joined by a stream flowing northwards from Columbine Hall, a grade II* listed former manor house built of flint rubble around 1400, and another stream flowing southwards from Old Newton. By Bridge Farm, another timber-framed and plastered farmhouse dating from the late sixteenth century, Newton Bridge carries the B1113 road over the river, which then passes under a railway bridge, crosses the contour, and is joined by Haughley Watercourse, which flows southwards through Haughley and Dagworth.

The river now turns to the south east, and passes under the A14 Stowmarket Bypass to enter Stowmarket. It is crossed by Stowupland Street and Station Road, below which the river was made navigable. Immediately after Station Road bridge is The Maltings, originally a malthouse, but adapted as a warehouse to serve the navigation. The brick-built structure has nine openings on the ground floor, which once held chutes for loading barges, and two loading doors on the first floor. It is now used as a restaurant and leisure centre. The Gipping Valley River Path runs along the eastern bank of the river, which is flanked by industrial buildings. It is joined by the Rattlesden River, flowing from the west. Stowupland Lock was just below the junction, beyond which the river passes under the A1120 road bridge. Beyond the bridge, Badley Mill House is a seventeenth-century former mill-house. It has an eighteenth-century extension with a cellar dating from the early sixteenth century. The next bridge carries the railway over the river, and the site of Badley lock is close to Badley Mill Farm. The lock now acts as a weir. To the east of the lock is Creeting Hall, a mid-sixteenth-century manor house, with later additions, which is now divided into two dwellings.

The river is joined by the River Jordan on the east bank and Wattisham Watercourse on the west bank. To the east of Needham Market is Hawks Mill and Needham Lock. The lock is at the upstream end of the mill bypass channel. The present mill building was constructed in 1884. Although it still contains a working Armfield water turbine, all of the internal machinery has been removed. The road in front of it is supported by an eighteenth-century bridge. Just to the east are the remains of a post mill, originally built further north, but moved to its present location in 1880, and used as a dovecote. It is thought to be the last example of its type in the country. Needham Market sewage works is located on the east bank of the river, while to the west are some former gravel pits, which have been landscaped to become part of the Needham Lake park. The park spans the river, and parts of it are a designated local nature reserve. The river splits into two just to the north of the B1078 bridge, with the River Gipping to the east and the Old River to the west. Bosmere lock is located below the bridge, and the four-storey timber-framed and weatherboarded mill building was used as a restaurant, but subsequently converted to private flats. The iron breast-shot water wheel remains, but the machinery does not. It was formerly called Barking Road Mill or Quinton&#x27;s Mill, as there was a Bosmere Mill some further downstream.

The Gipping Valley River Path moves to the west bank at the bridge. The next lock downstream is Creetings Lock, with Riverside Farmhouse standing on the east bank. It was built in 1798 and was originally a mill house. The original Bosmere mill was close by, but was demolished in the early twentieth century. Coddenham Watercourse flowing west from Ashbocking through Coddenham joins the mill stream, and the Old River rejoins the main channel below that. Pipps Ford Lock came next, with Pipps Ford farmhouse, dating from the 16th and 17th centuries located to the east. The railway comes close to the river, and the Gipping Valley River Path briefly leaves the river, to run alongside the railway, but rejoins the towpath at Baylham Mill. A new footbridge has been installed and a permissive path runs along the river providing an alternative path to the one that runs alongside the railway, some 0.5km away from the river.The mill, close to a sixteenth-century mill house, was built in nineteenth century, and has three storeys with an attic storey containing storage bins. The cast iron breastshot waterwheel drove three pairs of stones through wooden shafting. Two additional pairs could either be water-powered, or an oil engine could drive them. Most of the machinery is still in situ, making it the only complete water mill on the river. There is a red-brick humped backed bridge over the tail of the adjacent lock, which was repaired with gault brick in the nineteenth century.
To the east of the river, both above and below the lock, is the site of Combretovium, known to have contained two Roman forts. Finds have included a bronze statuette of Nero and a saddle-cloth weight, which may indicate that cavalry was stationed there. After Shamford Lock, the river is crossed by the railway, with Blakenham Lock situated to the north of Great Blakenham. The Gipping Way reverts to the east bank at the lock, and nearby is a nineteenth-century house called Gipping Weir. The river and railway re-cross, and to the east of the river there are extensive flooded gravel workings. At the southern end of the workings, the site of Claydon lock now lies beneath the A14 dual carriageway. Continuing southwards, the next lock was Paper Mill Lock, beside which is the paper mill. To the west, but separated from the river by the railway, is Suffolk Water Park, which occupies flooded gravel workings. To the south stood the north warehouse at Fisons Horticultural Division, which was built around 1858 to manufacture superphosphate fertiliser. To the south of the building, Edward Packard established the world&#x27;s first superphosphate factory between 1851 and 1854, and the two companies amalgamated soon after Joseph Fison set up his rival enterprise in 1858. Somersham Watercouse flows around the western edge of the Suffolk Water Park, and joins the west bank. The factory was closed in 2003 and completely destroyed in a fire, believed to be arson, on 6 May 2019.

After another crossing under the railway, the river skirts the eastern edge of Bramford and circles a hill, on top of which is Sproughton Manor, a grade II listed house built for Col Henry Phillipps in 1863 by the architect William Eden Nesfield. Sproughton Lock and mill are at the bottom of the hill. The mill is built in red brick and dates from the late eighteenth century. The mill race passes below the mill, which was operational until 1947, but all the machinery has been removed. Parts of the adjacent mill house date from around 1600. After passing under the A14 road, the river briefly heads north-east, through Chantry Cut, where Chantry Lock is situated, to pass under the railway. There are two bridges, as the railway line forks on the south side of the river. A flood barrier has been installed below the first bridge. Now passing through Ipswich, the river also forks, with the eastern branch being the River Gipping, and the western branch forming the start of the River Orwell. A modern sluice is located on the Orwell just below the junction. A final weir marks the position of Handford Sea Lock, below which the two channels rejoin. An outfall is situated below the junction, beyond which the river is tidal.

===Little Gipping===

Just north of the Handford Sea Lock weir, a freshwater spur extends to the east. This waterway is of human construction and may date back to Roman times. It has undergone a number of names over the years, but is best known as the Little Gipping. As much of its route has been filled-in, what is left constitutes an important part of the 
Alderman Canal West and Alderman Canal East, two Local Nature Reserves.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the River Gipping system was as follows in 2016.
The reasons for the quality being less than good include sewage discharge affecting most of the river, physical modification of channels, ground water abstraction, and poor management of agricultural and rural land adjacent to the river system. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and mercury compounds, none of which had previously been included in the assessment.

<text>Gipping is a village and civil parish in the Mid Suffolk district of Suffolk in eastern England. Located around three miles north north-east of Stowmarket, in 2005 its population was 80. At the 2011 Census the population remained less than 100 and was included in the civil parish of Old Newton with Dagworth.

The parish contains Great Gipping Wood, an ancient woodland and SSSI, whilst the River Gipping runs through it. It shares a parish council with neighbouring Old Newton with Dagworth.

==Gipping Hall==

For many years the village was linked with the family descended from Walter Tirel, the cousin of William Rufus.
Sir James Tyrrell who allegedly confessed to murdering the Princes in the Tower under Richard III and was executed by order of Henry VII in 1502 for treason. He built a chapel in the village in the 1470s, which is still there.

<doc id="150374" wikidata="Q622527" url="?curid=150374" title="Self-harm">
<text>Self-harm refers to intentional behaviors that cause harm to oneself. This is most commonly regarded as direct injury of one&#x27;s own skin tissues, usually without suicidal intention. Other terms such as cutting, self-injury, and self-mutilation have been used for any self-harming behavior regardless of suicidal intent. Common forms of self-harm include damaging the skin with a sharp object or scratching with the fingernails, hitting, or burning. The exact bounds of &quot;self-harm&quot; are imprecise, but generally exclude tissue damage that occurs as an unintended side-effect of eating disorders or substance abuse, as well as more societally acceptable body modification such as tattoos and piercings.

Although self-harm is by definition non-suicidal, it may still be life-threatening. People who do self-harm are more likely to die by suicide, and self-harm is found in 40–60% of suicides. Still, only a minority of those who self-harm are suicidal.

The desire to self-harm is a common symptom of some personality disorders. People with other mental disorders may also self-harm, including those with depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, mood disorders, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, dissociative disorders, psychotic disorders, as well as gender dysphoria or dysmorphia. Studies also provide strong support for a self-punishment function, and modest evidence for anti-dissociation, interpersonal-influence, anti-suicide, sensation-seeking, and interpersonal boundaries functions. Self-harm can also occur in high-functioning individuals who have no underlying mental health diagnosis.

The motivations for self-harm vary; some use it as a coping mechanism to provide temporary relief of intense feelings such as anxiety, depression, stress, emotional numbness, or a sense of failure. Self-harm is often associated with a history of trauma, including emotional and sexual abuse. There are a number of different methods that can be used to treat self-harm, which concentrate on either treating the underlying causes, or on treating the behavior itself. Other approaches involve avoidance techniques, which focus on keeping the individual occupied with other activities, or replacing the act of self-harm with safer methods that do not lead to permanent damage.
Self-harm tends to begin in adolescence. Self-harm in childhood is relatively rare, but the rate has been increasing since the 1980s. Self-harm can also occur in the elderly population. The risk of serious injury and suicide is higher in older people who self-harm. Captive animals, such as birds and monkeys, are also known to harm themselves.

==History==

Although the 20th-century psychiatrist Karl Menninger is often credited with the initial clinical characterization of self-harm, self-harm is not a new phenomenon. There is frequent reference in 19th-century clinical literature and asylum records which make a clear clinical distinction between self-harm with and without suicidal intent. This differentiation may have been important to both safeguard the reputations of asylums against accusations of medical neglect and to protect patients and their families from the legal or religious consequences of a suicide attempt. In 1896, the American ophthalmologists George Gould and Walter Pyle categorized self-mutilation cases into three groups: those resulting from &quot;temporary insanity from hallucinations or melancholia; with suicidal intent; and in a religious frenzy or emotion&quot;.

Self-harm was, and in some cases continues to be, a ritual practice in many cultures and religions.

The Maya priesthood performed auto-sacrifice by cutting and piercing their bodies in order to draw blood. A reference to the priests of Baal &quot;cutting themselves with blades until blood flowed&quot; can be found in the Hebrew Bible. However, in Judaism, such self-harm is forbidden under Mosaic law. It occurred in ancient Canaanite mourning rituals, as described in the Ras Shamra tablets.

Self-harm is practised in Hinduism by the ascetics known as &quot;sadhu&quot;s. In Catholicism, it is known as mortification of the flesh. Some branches of Islam mark the Day of Ashura, the commemoration of the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, with a ritual of self-flagellation, using chains and swords.

Dueling scars such as those acquired through academic fencing at certain traditional German universities are an early example of scarification in European society. Sometimes, students who did not fence would scar themselves with razors in imitation.

Constance Lytton, a prominent suffragette, used a stint in Holloway Prison during March 1909 to mutilate her body. Her plan was to carve &#x27;Votes for Women&#x27; from her breast to her cheek, so that it would always be visible. But after completing the &quot;V&quot; on her breast and ribs she requested sterile dressings to avoid blood poisoning, and her plan was aborted by the authorities. She wrote of this in her memoir &quot;Prisons and Prisoners&quot;.

Kikuyu girls cut each other&#x27;s vulvas in the 1950s as a symbol of defiance, in the context of the campaign against female genital mutilation in colonial Kenya. The movement came to be known as &quot;Ngaitana&quot; (&quot;I will circumcise myself&quot;), because to avoid naming their friends, the girls said they had cut themselves. Historian Lynn Thomas described the episode as significant in the history of FGM because it made clear that its victims were also its perpetrators.

===Classification===
Karl Menninger considered self-mutilation as a non-fatal expression of an attenuated death wish and thus coined the term &quot;partial suicide&quot;. He began a classification system of six types:
# neurotic – nail-biters, pickers, extreme hair removal, and unnecessary cosmetic surgery
# religious – self-flagellants and others
# puberty rites – hymen removal, circumcision, or clitoral alteration
# psychotic – eye or ear removal, genital self-mutilation, and extreme amputation
# organic brain diseases – which allow repetitive head-banging, hand-biting, finger-fracturing, or eye removal
# conventional – nail-clipping, trimming of hair, and shaving beards.

Pao (1969) differentiated between &quot;delicate&quot; (low lethality) and &quot;coarse&quot; (high lethality) self-mutilators who cut. The &quot;delicate&quot; cutters were young, multiple episodic of superficial cuts and generally had borderline personality disorder diagnosis. The &quot;coarse&quot; cutters were older and generally psychotic. Ross and McKay (1979) categorized self-mutilators into nine groups: &quot;cutting&quot;, &quot;biting&quot;, &quot;abrading&quot;, &quot;severing&quot;, &quot;inserting&quot;, &quot;burning&quot;, &quot;ingesting or inhaling&quot;, &quot;hitting&quot;, and &quot;constricting&quot;.

After the 1970s the focus of self-harm shifted from Freudian psycho-sexual drives of the patients.

Walsh and Rosen (1988) created four categories numbered by Roman numerals I–IV, defining &quot;Self-mutilation&quot; as rows II, III and IV.

Favazza and Rosenthal (1993) reviewed hundreds of studies and divided self-mutilation into two categories: &quot;culturally sanctioned self-mutilation&quot; and &quot;deviant self-mutilation&quot;. Favazza also created two subcategories of sanctioned self-mutilations; &quot;rituals&quot; and &quot;practices&quot;. The &quot;rituals&quot; are mutilations repeated generationally and &quot;reflect the traditions, symbolism, and beliefs of a society&quot; (p. 226). &quot;Practices&quot; are historically transient and cosmetic such as piercing of earlobes, nose, eyebrows as well as male circumcision while &quot;deviant self-mutilation&quot; is equivalent to self-harm.

==Classification and terminology==
&quot;Self-harm&quot; (SH), &quot;self-injury&quot; (SI), &quot;nonsuicidal self-injury&quot; (NSSI) and &quot;self-injurious behavior&quot; (SIB) are different terms to describe tissue damage that is performed intentionally and usually without suicidal intent. The adjective &quot;deliberate&quot; is sometimes used, although this has become less common, as some view it as presumptuous or judgmental. Less common or more dated terms include &quot;parasuicidal behavior&quot;, &quot;self-mutilation&quot;, &quot;self-destructive behavior&quot;, &quot;self-inflicted violence&quot;, &quot;self-injurious behavior&quot;, and &quot;self-abuse&quot;. Others use the phrase &quot;self-soothing&quot; as intentionally positive terminology to counter more negative associations. &quot;Self-inflicted wound&quot; or &quot;self-inflicted injury&quot; refers to a broader range of circumstances, including wounds that result from organic brain syndromes, substance abuse, and autoeroticism.

Different sources draw various distinctions between some of these terms. Some sources define &quot;self-harm&quot; more broadly than &quot;self-injury&quot;, such as to include drug overdose, eating disorders, and other acts that do not directly lead to visible injuries. Others explicitly exclude these. Some sources, particularly in the United Kingdom, define &quot;deliberate self-harm&quot; or &quot;self-harm&quot; in general to include suicidal acts. (This article principally discusses non-suicidal acts of self-inflicted skin damage or self-poisoning.) The inconsistent definitions used for self-harm have made research more difficult.

Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) has been listed in section 2 of the DSM-5-TR under the category &quot;other conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention&quot;. While NSSI is not a separate mental disorder, the DSM-5-TR adds a diagnostic code for the condition in-line with the ICD. The disorder is defined as intentional self-inflicted injury without the intent of dying by suicide. Criteria for NSSI include five or more days of self-inflicted harm over the course of one year without suicidal intent, and the individual must have been motivated by seeking relief from a negative state, resolving an interpersonal difficulty, or achieving a positive state.

A common belief regarding self-harm is that it is an attention-seeking behavior; however, in many cases, this is inaccurate. Many self-harmers are very self-conscious of their wounds and scars and feel guilty about their behavior, leading them to go to great lengths to conceal their behavior from others. They may offer alternative explanations for their injuries, or conceal their scars with clothing. Self-harm in such individuals may not be associated with suicidal or para-suicidal behavior. People who self-harm are not usually seeking to end their own life; it has been suggested instead that they are using self-harm as a coping mechanism to relieve emotional pain or discomfort or as an attempt to communicate distress.

Studies of individuals with developmental disabilities (such as intellectual disability) have shown self-harm being dependent on environmental factors such as obtaining attention or escape from demands. Some individuals may have dissociation harboring a desire to feel real or to fit into society&#x27;s rules.

==Signs and symptoms==
The most common form of self-harm for adolescents, according to studies conducted in six countries, is stabbing or cutting the skin with a sharp object. For adults ages 60 and over, self-poisoning (including intentional drug overdose) is by far the most common form. Other self-harm methods include burning, head-banging, biting, scratching, hitting, preventing wounds from healing, self-embedding of objects, and hair-pulling. The locations of self-harm are often areas of the body that are easily hidden and concealed from the sight of others. Neither the DSM-IV-TR nor the ICD-10 provide diagnostic criteria for self-harm. It is often seen as only a symptom of an underlying disorder, though many people who self-harm would like this to be addressed.

==Causes==

===Mental disorder===
Although some people who self-harm do not have any form of recognized mental disorder, self-harm often co-occurs with psychiatric conditions. Self-harm is, for example, associated with eating disorders, autism spectrum disorders, borderline personality disorder, dissociative disorders, bipolar disorder, depression, phobias, and conduct disorders. As many as 70% of individuals with borderline personality disorder engage in self-harm. An estimated 30% of individuals with autism spectrum disorders engage in self-harm at some point, including eye-poking, skin-picking, hand-biting, and head-banging. According to a meta-analysis that did not distinguish between suicidal and non-suicidal acts, self-harm is common among those with schizophrenia and is a significant predictor of suicide. There are parallels between self-harm and Münchausen syndrome, a psychiatric disorder in which individuals feign illness or trauma. There may be a common ground of inner distress culminating in self-directed harm in a Münchausen patient. However, a desire to deceive medical personnel in order to gain treatment and attention is more important in Münchausen&#x27;s than in self-harm.

===Psychological factors===

Self-harm is frequently described as an experience of depersonalization or a dissociative state. Abuse during childhood is accepted as a primary social factor increasing the incidence of self-harm, as is bereavement, and troubled parental or partner relationships. Factors such as war, poverty, unemployment, and substance abuse may also contribute. Other predictors of self-harm and suicidal behavior include feelings of entrapment, defeat, lack of belonging, and perceiving oneself as a burden along with having an impulsive personality and/or less effective social problem-solving skills. Two studies have indicated that self-harm correlates more with pubertal phase, particularly the end of puberty (peaking around 15 for girls), rather than with age. Adolescents may be more vulnerable neurodevelopmentally in this time, and more vulnerable to social pressures, with depression, alcohol abuse, and sexual activity as independent contributing factors. Transgender adolescents are significantly more likely to engage in self-harm than their cisgender peers. This can be attributed to distress caused by gender dysphoria as well as increased likelihoods of experiencing bullying, abuse, and mental illness.

===Genetics===

The most distinctive characteristic of the rare genetic condition Lesch–Nyhan syndrome is uncontrollable self-harm and self-mutilation, and may include biting (particularly of the skin, nails, and lips) and head-banging. Genetics may contribute to the risk of developing other psychological conditions, such as anxiety or depression, which could in turn lead to self-harming behavior. However, the link between genetics and self-harm in otherwise healthy patients is largely inconclusive.

===Drugs and alcohol===

Substance misuse, dependence and withdrawal are associated with self-harm. Benzodiazepine dependence as well as benzodiazepine withdrawal is associated with self-harming behavior in young people. Alcohol is a major risk factor for self-harm. A study which analyzed self-harm presentations to emergency rooms in Northern Ireland found that alcohol was a major contributing factor and involved in 63.8% of self-harm presentations. A 2009 study in the relation between cannabis use and deliberate self-harm (DSH) in Norway and England found that, in general, cannabis use may not be a specific risk factor for DSH in young adolescents. Smoking has also been associated with both non-suicidal self injury and suicide attempts in adolescents, although the nature of the relationship is unclear. A 2021 meta-analysis on literature concerning the association between cannabis use and self-injurious behaviors has defined the extent of this association, which is significant both at the cross-sectional (odds ratio = 1.569, 95% confidence interval [1.167-2.108]) and longitudinal (odds ratio = 2.569, 95% confidence interval [2.207-3.256]) levels, and highlighting the role of the chronic use of the substance, and the presence of depressive symptoms or of mental disorders as factors that might increase the risk of self-injury among cannabis users.

==Pathophysiology==
Self-injury may result in serious injury and scarring. While non-suicidal self-injury by definition lacks suicidal intent, it may nonetheless result in accidental death.

While the motivations for self harm vary, the most commonly endorsed reason for self harm given by adolescents is &quot;to get relief from a terrible state of mind&quot;. Young people with a history of repeated episodes of self harm are more likely to self-harm into adulthood, and are at higher risk of suicide. In older adults, influenced by a combination of interconnected individual, societal, and healthcare factors, including financial and interpersonal problems and comorbid physical conditions and pain, with increased loneliness, perceived burdensomeness of ageing, and loss of control reported as particular motivations.
There is a positive statistical correlation between self-harm and physical, sexual, and emotional abuse.
Self-harm may become a means of managing and controlling pain, in contrast to the pain experienced earlier in the person&#x27;s life over which they had no control (e.g., through abuse).

Assessment of motives in a medical setting is usually based on precursors to the incident, circumstances, and information from the patient. However, limited studies show that professional assessments tend to suggest more manipulative or punitive motives than personal assessments.

A UK Office for National Statistics study reported only two motives: &quot;to draw attention&quot; and &quot;because of anger&quot;. For some people, harming themselves can be a means of drawing attention to the need for help and to ask for assistance in an indirect way. It may also be an attempt to affect others and to manipulate them in some way emotionally. However, those with chronic, repetitive self-harm often do not want attention and hide their scars carefully.

Many people who self-harm state that it allows them to &quot;go away&quot; or dissociate, separating the mind from feelings that are causing anguish. This may be achieved by tricking the mind into believing that the present suffering being felt is caused by the self-harm instead of the issues they were facing previously: the physical pain therefore acts as a distraction from the original emotional pain. To complement this theory, one can consider the need to &quot;stop&quot; feeling emotional pain and mental agitation.

Alternatively, self-harm may be a means of feeling &quot;something&quot;, even if the sensation is unpleasant and painful. Those who self-harm sometimes describe feelings of emptiness or numbness (anhedonia), and physical pain may be a relief from these feelings.

Those who engage in self-harm face the contradictory reality of harming themselves while at the same time obtaining relief from this act. It may even be hard for some to actually initiate cutting, but they often do because they know the relief that will follow. For some self-harmers this relief is primarily psychological while for others this feeling of relief comes from the beta endorphins released in the brain. Endorphins are endogenous opioids that are released in response to physical injury, acting as natural painkillers and inducing pleasant feelings, and in response to self-harm would act to reduce tension and emotional distress. Many people do not feel physical pain when self-harming. Studies of clinical and non-clinical populations suggest that people who engage in self-harm have higher pain thresholds and tolerance in general, although a 2016 review characterized the evidence base as &quot;greatly limited&quot;. There is no consensus as to the reason for this apparent phenomenon.

As a coping mechanism, self-harm can become psychologically addictive because, to the self-harmer, it works; it enables them to deal with intense stress in the current moment. The patterns sometimes created by it, such as specific time intervals between acts of self-harm, can also create a behavioral pattern that can result in a wanting or craving to fulfill thoughts of self-harm.

===Autonomic nervous system===
Emotional pain activates the same regions of the brain as physical pain, so emotional stress can be a significantly intolerable state for some people. Some of this is environmental and some of this is due to physiological differences in responding. The autonomic nervous system is composed of two components: the sympathetic nervous system controls arousal and physical activation (e.g., the fight-or-flight response) and the parasympathetic nervous system controls physical processes that are automatic (e.g., saliva production). The sympathetic nervous system innervates (e.g., is physically connected to and regulates) many parts of the body involved in stress responses. Studies of adolescents have shown that adolescents who self-injure have greater physiological reactivity (e.g., skin conductance) to stress than adolescents who do not self-injure.

==Treatment==
Several forms of psychosocial treatments can be used in self-harm including dialectical behavior therapy. Psychiatric and personality disorders are common in individuals who self-harm and as a result self-harm may be an indicator of depression and/or other psychological problems. , there is little or no evidence that antidepressants, mood stabilizers, or dietary supplements reduce repetition of self-harm. In limited research into antipsychotics, one small trial of flupentixol found a possible reduction in repetition, while one small trial of fluphenazine found no difference between low and ultra-low doses. , no clinical trials have evaluated the effects of pharmacotherapy on adolescents who self-harm.

Emergency departments are often the first point of contact with healthcare for people who self-harm. As such they are crucial in supporting them and can play a role in preventing suicide. At the same time, according to a study conducted in England, people who self-harm often experience that they do not receive meaningful care at the emergency department. Both people who self-harm and staff in the study highlighted the failure of the healthcare system to support, the lack of specialist care. People who self-harm in the study often felt shame or being judged due to their condition, and said that being listened to and validated gave them hope. At the same time staff experienced frustration from being powerless to help and were afraid of being blamed if someone died by suicide.

There are also difficulties in meeting the need of patients that self-harm in mental healthcare. Studies have shown that staff found the care for people who self-harm emotionally challenging and they experienced an overwhelming responsibility in preventing the patients from self-harming and the care focuses mainly on maintaining the safety for the patients, for example by removing dangerous items or physical restraint, even if it is believed to be ineffective.

===Therapy===
Dialectical behavior therapy for adolescents (DBT-A) is a well-established treatment for self-injurious behavior in youth and is probably useful for decreasing the risk of non-suicidal self-injury. Several other treatments including integrated CBT (I-CBT), attachment-based family therapy (ABFT), resourceful adolescent parent program (RAP-P), intensive interpersonal psychotherapy for adolescents (IPT-A-IN), mentalization-based treatment for adolescents (MBT-A), and integrated family therapy are probably efficacious. Cognitive behavioral therapy may also be used to assist those with Axis I diagnoses, such as depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) can be successful for those individuals exhibiting a personality disorder, and could potentially be used for those with other mental disorders who exhibit self-harming behavior. Diagnosis and treatment of the causes of self-harm is thought by many to be the best approach to treating self-harm. In adolescents multisystem therapy shows promise. According to the classification of Walsh and Rosen trichotillomania and nail biting represent class I and II self-mutilation behavior (see classification section in this article); for these conditions habit reversal training and decoupling have been found effective according to meta-analytic evidence.

A meta-analysis found that psychological therapy is effective in reducing self-harm. The proportion of the adolescents who self-harmed over the follow-up period was lower in the intervention groups (28%) than in controls (33%). Psychological therapies with the largest effect sizes were dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and mentalization-based therapy (MBT).

In individuals with developmental disabilities, occurrence of self-harm is often demonstrated to be related to its effects on the environment, such as obtaining attention or desired materials or escaping demands. As developmentally disabled individuals often have communication or social deficits, self-harm may be their way of obtaining these things which they are otherwise unable to obtain in a socially appropriate way (such as by asking). One approach for treating self-harm thus is to teach an alternative, appropriate response which obtains the same result as the self-harm.

===Avoidance techniques===

Generating alternative behaviors that the person can engage in instead of self-harm is one successful behavioral method that is employed to avoid self-harm. Techniques, aimed at keeping busy, may include journaling, taking a walk, participating in sports or exercise or being around friends when the person has the urge to harm themselves. The removal of objects used for self-harm from easy reach is also helpful for resisting self-harming urges. The provision of a card that allows the person to make emergency contact with counselling services should the urge to self-harm arise may also help prevent the act of self-harm. Some providers may recommend harm-reduction techniques such as snapping of a rubber band on the wrist, but there is no consensus as to the efficacy of this approach.

==Epidemiology==
It is difficult to gain an accurate picture of incidence and prevalence of self-harm. Even with sufficient monitoring resources, self-harm is usually unreported, with instances taking place in private and wounds being treated by the self-harming individual. Recorded figures can be based on three sources: psychiatric samples, hospital admissions and general population surveys. A 2015 meta-analysis of reported self-harm among 600,000 adolescents found a lifetime prevalence of 11.4% for suicidal or non-suicidal self-harm (i.e. excluding self-poisoning) and 22.9% for non-suicidal self-injury (i.e. excluding suicidal acts), for an overall prevalence of 16.9%. The difference in SH and NSSI rates, compared to figures of 16.1% and 18.0% found in a 2012 review, may be attributable to differences in methodology among the studies analyzed.

The World Health Organization estimates that, as of 2010, 880,000 deaths occur as a result of self-harm (including suicides). About 10% of admissions to medical wards in the UK are as a result of self-harm, the majority of which are drug overdoses. However, studies based only on hospital admissions may hide the larger group of self-harmers who do not need or seek hospital treatment for their injuries, instead treating themselves. Many adolescents who present to general hospitals with deliberate self-harm report previous episodes for which they did not receive medical attention. In the United States up to 4% of adults self-harm with approximately 1% of the population engaging in chronic or severe self-harm.

The onset of self-harm tends to occur around puberty, although scholarship is divided as to whether this is usually before puberty or later in adolescence. Meta-analyses have not supported some studies&#x27; conclusion that self-harm rates are increasing among adolescents. It is generally thought that self-harm rates increase over the course of adolescence, although this has not been studied thoroughly. The earliest reported incidents of self-harm are in children between 5 and 7 years old. In addition there appears to be an increased risk of self-harm in college students than among the general population. In a study of undergraduate students in the US, 9.8% of the students surveyed indicated that they had purposefully cut or burned themselves on at least one occasion in the past. When the definition of self-harm was expanded to include head-banging, scratching oneself, and hitting oneself along with cutting and burning, 32% of the sample said they had done this. In Ireland, a study found that instances of hospital-treated self-harm were much higher in city and urban districts, than in rural settings. The CASE (Child &amp; Adolescent Self-harm in Europe) study suggests that the life-time risk of self-injury is ~1:7 for women and ~1:25 for men.

===Gender differences===

Aggregated research has found no difference in the prevalence of self-harm between men and women. This contrasts with previous studies, which suggested that up to four times as many females as males have direct experience of self-harm, which many had argued was rather the result of data collection biases.

The WHO/EURO Multicentre Study of Suicide, established in 1989, demonstrated that, for each age group, the female rate of self-harm exceeded that of the males, with the highest rate among females in the 13–24 age group and the highest rate among males in the 12–34 age group. However, this discrepancy has been known to vary significantly depending upon population and methodological criteria, consistent with wide-ranging uncertainties in gathering and interpreting data regarding rates of self-harm in general. Such problems have sometimes been the focus of criticism in the context of broader psychosocial interpretation. For example, feminist author Barbara Brickman has speculated that reported gender differences in rates of self-harm are due to deliberate socially biased methodological and sampling errors, directly blaming medical discourse for pathologising the female.

This gender discrepancy is often distorted in specific populations where rates of self-harm are inordinately high, which may have implications on the significance and interpretation of psychosocial factors other than gender. A study in 2003 found an extremely high prevalence of self-harm among 428 homeless and runaway youths (aged 16–19) with 72% of males and 66% of females reporting a history of self-harm. However, in 2008, a study of young people and self-harm saw the gender gap widen in the opposite direction, with 32% of young females, and 22% of young males admitting to self-harm. Studies also indicate that males who self-harm may also be at a greater risk of completing suicide.

There does not appear to be a difference in motivation for self-harm in adolescent males and females. Triggering factors such as low self-esteem and having friends and family members who self-harm are also common between both males and females. One limited study found that, among those young individuals who do self-harm, both genders are just as equally likely to use the method of skin-cutting. However, females who self-cut are more likely than males to explain their self-harm episode by saying that they had wanted to punish themselves. In New Zealand, more females are hospitalized for intentional self-harm than males. Females more commonly choose methods such as self-poisoning that generally are not fatal, but still serious enough to require hospitalization.

===Elderly===

In a study of a district general hospital in the UK, 5.4% of all the hospital&#x27;s self-harm cases were aged over 65. The male to female ratio was 2:3, although the self-harm rates for males and females over 65 in the local population were identical. Over 90% had depressive conditions, and 63% had significant physical illness. Under 10% of the patients gave a prior history of earlier self-harm, while both the repetition and suicide rates were very low, which could be explained by the absence of factors known to be associated with repetition, such as personality disorder and alcohol abuse. However, NICE Guidance on Self-harm in the UK suggests that older people who self-harm are at a greater risk of completing suicide, with 1 in 5 older people who self-harm going on to end their life. A study completed in Ireland showed that older Irish adults have high rates of deliberate self-harm, but comparatively low rates of suicide.

===Developing world===

Only recently have attempts to improve health in the developing world concentrated on not only physical illness but also mental health. Deliberate self-harm is common in the developing world. Research into self-harm in these area is however, still very limited. Though an important case study is that of Sri Lanka, which is a country exhibiting a high incidence of suicide and self-poisoning with agricultural pesticides or natural poisons. Many people admitted for deliberate self-poisoning during a study by Eddleston &quot;et al.&quot; were young and few expressed a desire to die, but death was relatively common in the young in these cases. The improvement of medical management of acute poisoning in the developing world is poor and improvements are required in order to reduce mortality.

Some of the causes of deliberate self-poisoning in Sri Lankan adolescents included bereavement and harsh discipline by parents. The coping mechanisms are being spread in local communities as people are surrounded by others who have previously deliberately harmed themselves or attempted suicide. One way to reduce self-harm would be to limit access to poisons; however many cases involve pesticides or yellow oleander seeds, and the reduction of access to these agents would be difficult. Great potential for the reduction of self-harm lies in education and prevention, but limited resources in the developing world ultimately make these methods challenging.

===Prison inmates===

Deliberate self-harm is especially prevalent in prison populations. A proposed explanation for this is that prisons are often violent places, and prisoners who wish to avoid physical confrontations may resort to self-harm as a ruse, either to convince other prisoners that they are dangerously insane and resilient to pain or to obtain protection from the prison authorities. Prisoners are sometimes placed in cells with no furniture or objects to prevent them from harming themselves. Self-harm also occurs frequently in inmates who are placed in solitary confinement.

==Awareness==

There are many movements among the general self-harm community to make self-harm itself and treatment better known to mental health professionals, as well as the general public. For example, March 1 is designated as Self-injury Awareness Day (SIAD) around the world. On this day, some people choose to be more open about their own self-harm, and awareness organizations make special efforts to raise awareness about self-harm.

==Other animals==
Self-harm in non-human mammals is a well-established but not widely known phenomenon. Its study under zoo or laboratory conditions could lead to a better understanding of self-harm in human patients.

Zoo or laboratory rearing and isolation are important factors leading to increased susceptibility to self-harm in higher mammals, e.g., macaque monkeys. Non-primate mammals are also known to mutilate themselves under laboratory conditions after administration of drugs. For example, pemoline, clonidine, amphetamine, and very high (toxic) doses of caffeine or theophylline are known to precipitate self-harm in lab animals.

In dogs, canine obsessive-compulsive disorder can lead to self-inflicted injuries, for example canine lick granuloma. Captive birds are sometimes known to engage in feather-plucking, causing damage to feathers that can range from feather shredding to the removal of most or all feathers within the bird&#x27;s reach, or even the mutilation of skin or muscle tissue.

Breeders of show mice have noticed similar behaviors. One known as &quot;barbering&quot; involves a mouse obsessively grooming the whiskers and facial fur off themselves and cage-mates.

<text>The Fens or Fenlands in eastern England is a area of former marshland of low lying land supporting a rich ecology and numerous species. Most of the fens were drained centuries ago, resulting in a flat, dry, low-lying agricultural region supported by a system of drainage channels and man-made rivers (dykes and drains) and automated pumping stations. There have been unintended consequences to this reclamation, as the land level has continued to sink and the dykes have been built higher to protect it from flooding.

Fen is the local term for an individual area of marshland or former marshland. It also designates the type of marsh typical of the area, which has neutral or alkaline water and relatively large quantities of dissolved minerals, but few other plant nutrients.

The Fens are a National Character Area, based on their landscape, biodiversity, geodiversity and economic activity.

The Fens lie inland of the Wash, and are an area of nearly in the south east of Lincolnshire, most of Cambridgeshire (which also includes parts of the old historic county of Huntingdonshire), and western most parts of Norfolk and Suffolk.

Most of the Fens lie within a few metres of sea level. As with similar areas in the Netherlands, much of the Fenland originally consisted of fresh- or salt-water wetlands. These have been artificially drained and continue to be protected from floods by drainage banks and pumps. With the support of this drainage system, the Fenland has become a major arable agricultural region for grains and vegetables. The Fens are particularly fertile, containing around half of the grade 1 agricultural land in England.

The Fens have been referred to as the &quot;Holy Land of the English&quot; because of the former monasteries, now churches and cathedrals, of Crowland, Ely, Peterborough, Ramsey and Thorney. Other significant settlements in the Fens include Boston, Downham Market, King’s Lynn, Mildenhall, March, Spalding, and Wisbech.

==Background: historical flooding and drainage==
The Fens are very low-lying compared with the chalk and limestone uplands that surround them – in most places no more than above sea level. As a result of drainage and the subsequent shrinkage of the peat fens, many parts of the Fens now lie below mean sea level. Although one writer in the 17th century described the Fenland as entirely above sea level (in contrast to the Netherlands), the area now includes the lowest land in the United Kingdom. Holme Fen in Cambridgeshire, is around below sea level. Within the Fens are a few hills, which have historically been called &quot;islands&quot;, as they remained dry when the low-lying fens around them were flooded. The largest of the fen-islands was the 23-square-mile (60 km2) Kimmeridge Clay island, on which the cathedral city of Ely was built: its highest point is above mean sea level.

Without artificial drainage and flood protection, the Fens would be liable to periodic flooding, particularly in winter due to the heavy load of water flowing down from the uplands and overflowing the rivers. Some areas of the Fens were once permanently flooded, creating lakes or &quot;meres&quot;, while others were flooded only during periods of high water. In the pre-modern period, arable farming was limited to the higher areas of the surrounding uplands, the fen islands, and the so-called &quot;Townlands&quot;, an arch of silt ground around the Wash, where the towns had their arable fields. Though these lands were lower than the peat fens before the peat shrinkage began, the more stable silt soils were reclaimed by medieval farmers and embanked against any floods coming down from the peat areas or from the sea. The rest of the Fenland was dedicated to pastoral farming, fishing, fowling, and the harvesting of reeds or sedge for thatch. In this way, the medieval and early modern Fens stood in contrast to the rest of England, which was primarily an arable agricultural region.

Since the advent of modern drainage in the 19th and 20th centuries, the Fens have been radically transformed. Today, arable farming has almost entirely replaced pastoral. The economy of the Fens is heavily invested in the production of crops such as grains, vegetables, and some cash crops such as rapeseed and canola.

==Areas of the Fens==

Drainage in the Fenland consists of both river drainage and internal drainage of the land between the rivers. The internal drainage was organised by &quot;levels&quot; or districts, each of which includes the fen parts of one or several parishes. The details of the organisation vary with the history of their development, but the areas generally include:

===Great Level===

* The Great Level of the Fens is the largest region of fen in eastern England: including the lower drainage basins of the River Nene and the Great Ouse, it covers about . It is also known as the Bedford Level, after Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford, who headed the so-called adventurers (investors) in the 17th-century drainage in this area; his son became the first governor of the Bedford Level Corporation. In the 17th century, the Great Level was divided into the North, Middle and South Levels for the purposes of administration and maintenance. In the 20th century, these levels were given new boundaries; they included some fens that were never part of the jurisdiction of the Bedford Level Corporation.
**The South Level lies to the southeast of the Ouse Washes and surrounds Ely, as it did in the 17th century.
**The Middle Level lies between the Ouse Washes and the Nene, but historically was defined as between the Ouse Washes and Morton&#x27;s Leam, a 15th-century canal that runs north of the town of Whittlesey.
**The North Level now includes all of the fens in Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire between the Nene and the River Welland. It originally included only a small part of these lands, including the ancient parishes of Thorney and Crowland, but excluding most of Wisbech Hundred and Lincolnshire, which were under their own local jurisdictions.

===Bourne and Deeping Fens===
Bourne Fen and Deeping Fen lie in the southern most parts of Lincolnshire, between the Rivers Welland and the Bourne Eau with the River Glen running between the two Fens and the area covers both the town of Bourne as well as The Deepings including the villages of Langtoft and Baston.

===Lindsey Level===
The Lindsey Level, also known as the Black Sluice District, was first drained in 1639 and extends from the Glen and Bourne Eau to Swineshead and then across to Kirton. Its waters is carried mostly though the South Forty-Foot Drain through to the Haven at Boston though the Black Sluice. Also this area includes the market town of Spalding and the ancient village of Sempringham.
The above were all redrained at one time or another after the Civil War (1642–1649).

===Holland, Wildmore, West and East Fens===
These areas cover the northern most part of the Fens from Boston right up as far north west as Washingborough near Lincoln along the course of the River Witham and to the north east it extends up as far as the edge of the Lincolnshire Wolds to the seaside town of Skegness.

* The Witham Commission Fens:
**First District: from Washingborough to Billinghay Dales
**Second District: Blacksluice – Holland Fen
**Third District: north of the River Witham above Bardney
**Fourth District: East, West and Wildmore Fens and the Townland from Boston to Wainfleet
**Fifth District: Kyme Eau to Billinghay Skirth
**Sixth District: Blacksluice – Helpringham Eau to Kyme Eau

These were drained in the 18th and 19th centuries.

==Formation and geography==
At the end of the most recent glacial period, known in Britain as the Devensian, ten thousand years ago, Britain and continental Europe were joined by the ridge between Friesland and Norfolk. The topography of the bed of the North Sea indicates that the rivers of the southern part of eastern England flowed into the Rhine, thence through the English Channel. From the Fens northward along the modern coast, the drainage flowed into the northern North Sea basin. As the ice melted, the rising sea level drowned the lower lands, leading ultimately to the present coastline.

These rising sea levels flooded the previously inland woodland of the Fenland basin; over the next few thousand years both saltwater and freshwater wetlands developed as a result. Silt and clay soils were deposited by marine floods in the saltwater areas and along the beds of tidal rivers, while organic soils, or peats, developed in the freshwater marshes. Fenland water levels peaked in the Iron Age; earlier Bronze and Neolithic settlements were covered by peat deposits, and have only recently been found after periods of extensive droughts revealed them. During the Roman period, water levels fell once again. Settlements developed on the new silt soils deposited near the coast. Though water levels rose once again in the early medieval period, by this time artificial banks protected the coastal settlements and the interior from further deposits of marine silts. Peats continued to develop in the freshwater wetlands of the interior fens.

The wetlands of the fens have historically included:
*Washes: these are places such as tidal mud flats and braided rivers, which are sometimes exposed and at other times covered with water.
*Salt marsh: this is the higher part of a tidal wash, on which salt-adapted plants grew.
*Fen: this is a broad expanse of nutrient-rich shallow water in which dead plants do not fully decay, resulting in a flora of emergent plants growing in saturated peat.
*Moor: this developed where the peat grew above the reach of the land water which carried the nutrients to the fen. Its development was enabled where the fen was watered directly by rainfall. The slightly acidic rain neutralized the hydroxide ions of the peat, making it more suitable for acid-loving plants, notably &quot;Sphagnum&quot; species. This is the same as bog, but the word &quot;moor&quot; was applied to this acid peatland occurring on hills. These moors disappeared in the 19th century. Researchers did not think that the Fenland had this kind of peat, until the discovery of archaeological and documentary evidence showing that it did until the early 19th century.
*Waters: these have included:
**tidal creeks, which reached from the sea into the marsh, the Townlands and in some places, the fen. They were named only if big enough to be regarded as havens
**meres, or shallow lakes, which were more or less static but aerated by wind action
** many rivers, both natural and (from Roman times on) artificial

Major areas for settlement were:
*&quot;Townlands&quot;, a broad bank of silt (the remains of the huge creek levees that developed naturally during the Bronze and Iron Ages), on which the settlers built homes and grew vegetables for households
*&quot;fen islands&quot;: areas of higher land, which were never covered by the growing peat
*&quot;fen edges&quot;: uplands surrounding the fens

In general, of the three principal soil types found in the Fenland today, the mineral-based silt resulted from the energetic marine environment of the creeks, the clay was deposited in tidal mud-flats and salt-marsh, while the peat grew in the fen and bog. The peat produces black soils, which are directly comparable to the American muck soils. A roddon, the dried raised bed of a watercourse, is more suitable for building than the less stable peat.

Since the 19th century, all of the acid peat in the Fens has disappeared. Drying and wastage of peats has greatly reduced the depth of the alkaline peat soils and reduced the overall elevation of large areas of the peat fens. It is also recorded that peat was dug out of the East and West Lincolnshire fens in the 14th century and used to fire the salterns of Wrangle and Friskney. In later centuries it was used locally for winter fuel and its digging controlled by the Duchy of Lancaster.

Written records of earthquakes in the Fen area appear as early as 1048. According to &quot;Historia Ingulfi,&quot; p. 64, (1684) this took place in Lincolnshire. In 1117 one affected Holland, Lincs, &quot;endangering and injuring Crowland Abbey&quot;. In 1185 Lincoln was damaged. In 1448 a shock was recorded in south Lincolnshire (&quot;Ingulfi,&quot; p. 526). In 1750 John Moore records a severe shock attended by a rumbling noise in Bourn after midday. This was felt in Lincolnshire, Leicestershire and Northamptonshire. Houses tottered, slates, tiles and some chimneys fell. As it was a Sunday, some people ran out of the churches &quot;in great consternation&quot;. In 1792 another shock was also felt in Bourne and neighbouring towns.

==History==

===Pre-Roman settlement===
There is evidence of human settlement near the Fens from the Mesolithic on. The evidence suggests that Mesolithic settlement in Cambridgeshire was particularly along the fen edges and on the low islands within the fens, to take advantage of the hunting and fishing opportunities of the wetlands. Internationally important sites include Flag Fen and Must Farm quarry Bronze Age settlement and Stonea Camp.

===Roman farming and engineering===
The Romans constructed the Fen Causeway, a road across the Fens to link what later became East Anglia with what later became central England; it runs between Denver and Peterborough. They also linked Cambridge and Ely. Generally, their road system avoided the Fens, except for minor roads designed for exporting the products of the region, especially salt, beef and leather. Sheep were probably raised on the higher ground of the Townlands and fen islands, then as in the early 19th century. There may have been some drainage efforts during the Roman period, including the Car Dyke along the western edge of the Fenland between Peterborough and Lincolnshire, but most canals were constructed for transportation.

How far seaward the Roman settlement extended is unclear owing to the deposits laid down above them during later floods.
===Early post-Roman settlements===
The early post-Roman settlements were made on the Townlands. It is clear that there was some prosperity there, particularly where rivers permitted access to the upland beyond the fen. Such places were Wisbech, Spalding, Swineshead and Boston. All the Townlands parishes were laid out as elongated strips, to provide access to the products of fen, marsh and sea. On the fen edge, parishes are similarly elongated to provide access to both upland and fen. The townships are therefore often nearer to each other than they are to the distant farms in their own parishes.

===Early Middle Ages and Middle Ages===
After the end of Roman Britain, there is a break in written records. It is thought that some Iceni may have moved west into the Fens to avoid the Angles, who were migrating across the North Sea from Angeln (modern Schleswig) and settling what would become East Anglia. Surrounded by water and marshes, the Fens provided a safe area that was easily defended and not particularly desirable to invading Anglo-Saxons.

It has been proposed that the names of West Walton, Walsoken and Walpole suggest the native British population, with the &quot;Wal-&quot; coming from the Old English &quot;walh&quot;, meaning &quot;foreigner&quot;. However, the villages are in close proximity to the old Roman sea wall, so the &quot;wal-&quot; element is more probably from &quot;wal&quot; or &quot;weal&quot;, meaning &quot;wall&quot;. &quot;Walton&quot; is generally believed to mean &quot;wall-town&quot;, &quot;Walsoken&quot; to mean &quot;the district under particular jurisdiction by the wall&quot;, and &quot;Walpole&quot; to mean simply &quot;wall-pole&quot; (Old English &quot;wal&quot; and &quot;pal&quot;).

When written records resume in Anglo-Saxon England, the names of a number of peoples of the Fens are recorded in the Tribal Hidage and Christian histories. They include North Gyrwe (Peterborough and Crowland), South Gyrwe (Ely), the Spalda (Spalding), and Bilmingas (part of south Lincolnshire).

In the early Christian period of Anglo-Saxon England, a number of Christians sought the isolation that could be found in the wilderness of the Fens. Later classified as saints, often with close royal links, they include Guthlac, Etheldreda, Pega, and Wendreda. Hermitages on the islands became centres of communities which later developed as monasteries with massive estates. In the &quot;Life of Saint Guthlac&quot;, a biography of the East Anglian hermit who lived in the Fens during the early 8th century, Saint Guthlac was described as attacked on several occasions by people he believed were Britons, who were then living in the Fens. However, Bertram Colgrave, in the introduction to one edition, doubts this account, because of the lack of evidence of British survival in the region. British place names in the area are &quot;very few&quot;.

Monastic life was disrupted by Danish (Anglo-Saxon) raids and centuries of settlement from the 6th century but was revived in the mid-10th-century monastic revival. In the 11th century, the whole area was incorporated into a united Anglo-Saxon England. The Fens remained a place of refuge and intrigue. It was here that Alfred Aetheling was brought to be murdered and here where Hereward the Wake based his insurgency against Norman England.

Fenland monastic houses include the so-called &quot;Fen Five&quot; (Ely Cathedral Priory, Thorney Abbey, Croyland Abbey, Ramsey Abbey and Peterborough Abbey) as well as Spalding Priory. As major landowners, the monasteries played a significant part in the early efforts at drainage of the Fens.

====Royal Forest====
During most of the 12th century and the early 13th century, the south Lincolnshire fens were afforested. The area was enclosed by a line from Spalding, along the River Welland to Market Deeping, then along the Car Dyke to Dowsby and across the fens to the Welland. It was deforested in the early 13th century. There is little agreement as to the exact dates of the establishment and demise of the forest, but it seems likely that the deforestation was connected with the Magna Carta or one of its early 13th-century restatements, though it may have been as late as 1240. The forest would have affected the economies of the townships around it and it appears that the present Bourne Eau was constructed at the time of the deforestation, as the town seems to have joined in the general prosperity by about 1280.

Though the forest was about half in Holland (Lincolnshire) and half in Kesteven, it is known as Kesteven Forest.

==Draining the Fens==

===Early modern attempts to drain the Fens===

Though some signs of Roman hydraulics survive, and there were also some medieval drainage works, land drainage was begun in earnest during the 1630s by the various investors who had contracts with King Charles I to do so. The leader of one of these syndicates was the Earl of Bedford, who employed Cornelius Vermuyden as engineer. Contrary to popular belief, Vermuyden was not involved with the draining of the Great Fen in Cambridgeshire and Norfolk in the 1630s, but only became involved with the second phase of construction in the 1650s. The scheme was imposed despite huge opposition from locals who were losing their livelihoods based on fishing and wildfowling. Fenmen known as the Fen Tigers tried to sabotage the drainage efforts.

Two cuts were made in the Cambridgeshire Fens to join the River Great Ouse to the sea at King&#x27;s Lynn – the Old Bedford River and the New Bedford River, the latter being known also as the &quot;Hundred Foot Drain&quot;. Both cuts were named after the Fourth Earl of Bedford who, along with some &quot;gentlemen adventurers&quot; (venture capitalists), funded the construction and were rewarded with large grants of the resulting farmland. The work was directed by engineers from the Low Countries. Following this initial drainage, the Fens were still extremely susceptible to flooding, so windpumps were used to pump water away from affected areas. The Company of Adventurers were more formally incorporated in 1663 as the Bedford Level Corporation.

However, their success was short-lived. Once drained of water, the peat shrank, and the fields lowered further. The more effectively they were drained, the worse the problem became, and soon the fields were lower than the surrounding rivers. By the end of the 17th century, the land was under water once again.

Though the three Bedford Levels together formed the biggest scheme, they were not the only ones. Lord Lindsey and his partner Sir William Killigrew had the Lindsey Level inhabited by farmers by 1638, but the onset of the Civil War permitted the destruction of the works until the act of Parliament that led to the formation of the Black Sluice Commissioners, the Black Sluice Drainage Act 1765 (5 Geo. 3. c. &quot;86&quot;).
Many original records of the Bedford Level Corporation, including maps of the Levels, are now held by Cambridgeshire Archives and Local Studies Service at the County Record Office in Cambridge.

===Modern drainage===
The major part of the draining of the Fens was effected in the late 18th and early 19th century, again involving fierce local rioting and sabotage of the works. The final success came in the 1820s when windpumps were replaced with powerful coal-powered steam engines, such as Stretham Old Engine, which were themselves replaced with diesel-powered pumps, such as those at Prickwillow Museum and, following World War II, the small electric stations that are still used today.
The dead vegetation of the peat remained undecayed because it was deprived of air (the peat being anaerobic). When it was drained, the oxygen of the air reached it, since then the peat has been slowly oxidizing. This, together with the shrinkage on its initial drying and the removal of soil by the wind, has meant that much of the Fens lies below high tide level. As the highest parts of the drained fen are now only a few metres above mean sea level, only sizeable embankments of the rivers, and general flood defences, stop the land from being inundated. Nonetheless, these works are now much more effective than they were.

The Fens today are protected by of embankments defending against the sea and of river embankments. Eleven internal drainage board (IDB) groups maintain 286 pumping stations and of watercourses, with the combined capacity to pump 16,500 Olympic-size swimming pools in a 24-hour period or to empty Rutland Water in 3 days.

==Modern farming and food manufacturing in the Fens==
As of 2008, there are estimated to be 4,000 farms in the Fens involved in agriculture and horticulture, including arable, livestock, poultry, dairy, orchards, vegetables and ornamental plants and flowers. They employ about 27,000 people in full-time and seasonal jobs. In turn, they support around 250 businesses involved in food and drink manufacturing and distribution, employing around 17,500 people.

Over 70% of the Fens is involved in environmental stewardship schemes, under which of hedgerow and of ditches are managed, providing large wildlife corridors and habitat for endangered animals such as the water vole.

==Restoration==
In 2003, the Great Fen Project was initiated to return parts of the Fens to their original pre-agricultural state. The periodic flooding by the North Sea, which renewed the character of the Fenlands, was characterised conventionally by the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; as &quot;ravaged by serious inundations of the sea&quot;. The modern approach is to allow a little farmland to be flooded again and turned into nature reserves. By introducing fresh water, the organisers of the project hope to encourage species such as the snipe, lapwing and bittern. Endangered species such as the fen violet will be seeded.

The Fens Waterways Link is a scheme to restore navigation to some of the drainage works. It is planned to bring the South Forty-Foot Drain and parts of the Car Dyke into use as part of a route between Boston and Cambridge.

==Sports==
The Fens is the origin of English bandy and Fen skating. It is the base of Great Britain Bandy Association and in Littleport there is a project in place aiming at building an indoor stadium for ice sports. If successful, it will have the largest sheet of ice in the country with both a bandy pitch and a speed skating oval.

==Settlements==
Many historic cities, towns and villages have grown up in the fens, sited chiefly on the few areas of raised ground. These include:

<text>Chess or the King&#x27;s Game () is a book on chess. It was published in Leipzig in 1616 under the name of &quot;Gustavus Selenus&quot; (&quot;Gustavus&quot; being an anagram of &quot;Augustus&quot; and &quot;Selenus&quot; referring to the Greek moon goddess Selene, linked to the Latin origin of the name &quot;Lüneburg&quot;), the pen name of Duke Augustus of Brunswick-Lüneburg (1579–1666). As a young prince, Augustus probably had learned of the game during his voyages to Italy and purchased numerous chess books from the Augsburg merchant and art collector Philipp Hainhofer. The first textbook on chess in the German language, the work is mainly based on the &quot;Libro de la invencion liberal y arte del juego del axedrez&quot; written in 1561 by the Spanish priest Ruy López de Segura, but also contains extensive philosophical and historical considerations (e.g. on the &quot;chess village&quot; of Ströbeck).

In addition to chess instruction, the book contained interesting illustrations of contemporary German chess pieces by Jacob van der Heyden et al. The usage for chessmen at the time tended to favor slender designs with nested floral crowns. The book was so successful that pieces of this pattern became known as the &quot;Selenus chess sets”. Over time, pieces became taller, thinner, and more elaborate. Their apparent floral nature lead some to name them &quot;Garden chess sets&quot; or &quot;Tulip chess sets&quot;. Selenus pattern sets were commonly made in Germany and Central Europe until about 1914 when they were completely eclipsed by the more playable and stable Staunton chess set pattern, which was introduced in 1849 by manufacturer Jaques of London.

<text>The Old Bedford River is an artificial, partial diversion of the waters of the River Great Ouse in the Fens of Cambridgeshire, England. It was named after the fourth Earl of Bedford who contracted with the local Commission of Sewers to drain the Great Level of the Fens beginning in 1630. It provided a steeper and shorter path for the waters of the Great Ouse, and was embanked to prevent them flooding the low ground of the South Fens. Throughout the project, the Earl and his Adventurers faced disruption from those who were opposed to drainage schemes. The project was deemed to have succeeded in draining the fens in 1637, but that decision was reversed in 1638. After a lull during the English Civil War, when much of the work was damaged, the Dutch engineer Cornelius Vermuyden worked with William Russell, the fifth Earl of Bedford to complete the drainage. Disruption and unrest continued while the work was carried out, resulting in the Adventurers employing armed guards. A second river, the New Bedford River, was cut parallel to the first channel, which then became the Old Bedford River. At some point, the Old Bedford River was split into two parts, when the upper section was diverted into the River Delph at Welches Dam, and the lower section was joined to the Counter Drain. Both parts retain the name, but are not connected to each other. The area between the two Bedford rivers acts as a large washland, which holds floodwater when the river channels cannot cope with the volume of water in them.

The river acts as the outlet for a number of land drainage projects. Three internal drainage boards are located along its banks, and there are several pumping stations which pump water from low-lying fens into the Counter Drain and the lower section of the Old Bedford River. At the junction with the Great Ouse is Old Bedford Sluice, through which the water passes to reach the tidal river, but this is not always possible, particularly when high volumes of water are passing down the New Bedford River as a result of heavy rainfall further up the Great Ouse. To resolve this, a pumping station was built at Welches Dam in 1948, to pump water from the Counter Drain and lower Old Bedford River into the River Delph, which runs parallel to the lower river for most of it length, but then crosses the washland to enter the New Bedford River at Welmore Lake Sluice. When pumping occurs, flow in the lower river above Welney is reversed, and a vertical sluice gate prevents water discharged into the river by the Upwell Internal Drainage Board from reaching the pumping station.

The river is navigable from Welches Dam to Old Bedford Sluice, but passage through the sluice can only be made when tidal water levels allow, as there is no lock. Welches Dam Lock used to provide a link from the Middle Level Navigations to the Great Ouse, which was the only link between the two river systems when Well Creek became unnavigable. However, a campaign to save Well Creek from being filled in was successful, and the recommended transfer route follows the old course of the River Nene and Well Creek to Salters Lode Lock at Denver. In 2006, the Environment Agency closed Welches Dam Lock, and despite campaigns for it to be reinstated, it has remained closed. There are proposals as part of the Fens Waterways Link which could result in more of the Old Bedford River becoming navigable, in order to provide a circular cruising route including parts of the Great Ouse and the Middle Level Navigations. 

==History==
The idea of an artificial river running, as the Old Bedford River does, from Earith to Denver was not a new idea; it had been proposed as early as 1604 by the engineer John Hunt. At a meeting of the Commissioners of Sewers held at King&#x27;s Lynn on 1 September 1630, they asked the Dutch drainage engineer Cornelius Vermuyden to implement a drainage scheme for the southern fens, known as the Great Level. He would fund the work himself, but would receive of the drained land in recognition of his investment. Vermuyden produced plans for the work, but wanted of land. However, the Commissioners were not willing to increase the area of land, and so asked the Earl of Bedford if he would undertake the work, to which he agreed. He would be given six years to complete the work. Despite their earlier reluctance to increase the area of land awarded for carrying out the work, the Earl would receive . Of this, would be used to fund ongoing maintenance of the drainage works, would be given to the King, and the remaining would be for the Earl of Bedford. He and 13 other adventurers were granted a charter in 1634, creating a Corporation.

Once the project started, the Earl of Bedford engaged Vermuyden to design the works. At the time, many thought that any solution should involve making existing rivers wider and deeper, whereas Vermuyden was an advocate of new straight channels, designed to increase the gradient of a river, and it was this view that prevailed. The result was the construction of the Bedford River, around long, and running in a straight line from a sluice near Earith to another near Salters Lode. The Bedford River was around wide, and was the main channel constructed. It provided a route for the waters of the Great Ouse which was considerably shorter and steeper than the existing route via Stretham and Ely. The project, which also included cutting or improving eight other drains, was financed by the Earl of Bedford and several other investors. It was undertaken between 1630 and 1636, but although the work carried out may have been based on Vermuyden&#x27;s plans, there is no firm evidence that he was involved as the supervising engineer.

Prior to work starting, those who objected to the scheme had, among other things, composed &quot;libellous songs to disparage the work&quot;, but once construction began, things got much worse. The objectors destroyed dykes as they were erected, filled in channels that had been dug, and opened sluices to flood the land. There were frequent riots, with those carrying out the work attempting to drive cattle from the fens, and crowds armed with scythes and pitchforks attempting to stop them. Tracts and pamphlets were produced by both parties in the confrontation. William Hayward made a detailed survey of the Great Level in 1636, from which it could be seen that the works were only partly completed. However, in 1637, the Commission of Sewers met at St Ives, and stated that the work outlined in the original agreement had been largely finished. Part of the reasoning may have been that several of the adventurers were almost bankrupt, and the decision gave them the land that had been agreed. Numerous complaints were then received by the Privy Council, which turned the king against the Earl of Bedford and his Corporation. It was recognised that much of the Great Level was improved, but the drainage was patchy, and therefore the adventurers had failed to drain the Great Level. On 12 April 1638, the project was deemed to be defective. Later that year, on 18 July, the king was declared as the undertaker who would ensure that the level was drained.

Vermuyden was involved in this second scheme, for which a few works were begun in 1638, but his main plans were not published until 1642. In this period, unrest among those who lived in the Fens, and felt that they no longer had access to what has previously been common land, did not abate. There were disturbances in Whelpmore Fen, near Littleport, and in 1638, threats to break down Ely prison to free those who had been arrested were taken seriously enough that it was guarded during the night. Oliver Cromwell became an advocate for those who had been dispossessed, although he was not against drainage in general, but only the injustices that accompanied it. Activity on the Bedford Levels ceased when the English Civil War began in 1642, and people used the confusion of that period to destroy many of the drainage works. 

===Second phase===
Although activity ceased, planning did not. Proposals to drain the Great Level were submitted to Parliament in August 1645, and although progress was slow, in part due to a huge number of objections, they resulted in an act of Parliament being passed on 29 May 1649. This empowered William Russell, the fifth Earl of Bedford and some adventurers to drain the Great Level, without disrupting navigation on the rivers, and to make them into &quot;winter ground&quot;. They had until 10 October 1656 to complete the work. &quot;Winter ground&quot; would be suitable for growing crops such as coleseed, rapeseed, corn, grain, hemp and flax, as well as providing pasture for cattle. Despite the act, the undertakers did not have a clear plan of what they would do to achieve the drainage, but were hoping that they could include the works of the Fourth Earl of Bedford. Several engineers made suggestions, but only Vermuyden had a clear plan and workmen to complete the work. As a result, he became the project director on 25 January 1650, despite not being popular particularly with his colleagues. 

He split the Great Level into three, which were later known as the North Level, the Middle Level and the South Level, with the Bedford River forming the divide between the Middle Level and the South Level. Work began of the North and Middle Levels first, with the existing drainage works being restored, and new embanking and sluices constructed. In the South Level, the New Bedford River was cut, running parallel to the original Bedford River, which was renamed the Old Bedford River. This was around to the east of the Old Bedford River, and was known as the Hundred Foot River. It became the main channel for the upland waters of the Great Ouse. Water was diverted into it, instead of along the Old Bedford River, by the Severn Holes Sluice, at the start of the Old Bedford River. A high barrier bank was constructed to the west of the Old Bedford River, and another to the east of the New Bedford River, so that in times of flood, the intervening space between the rivers would be inundated, but the surrounding land would not. This vast washland is known as the Ouse Washes.

Earlier disruption of the work was repeated, with attempts to destroy the newly-created banks, and the adventurers resorting to using armed guards to protect their work. Frequent complaints were made to Parliament, and eventually, it became difficult to obtain labourers. After the Battle of Dunbar some of the workers were Scottish prisoners, and their numbers were swelled by Dutch prisoners after the Battle of Dover. The works in the North and Middle Levels, to the north-west of the Old Bedford River, were judged to be completed on 26 March 1651, and a second judgement took place at Ely in March 1652, when the South Level was signed off. A service of thanksgiving took place in Ely Cathedral, to celebrate the completion of the work. Attempts were made to create a formal organisation to ensure the works were maintained, and this resulted in the creation of the Bedford Level Corporation under the terms of the General Drainage Act 1663.

===River Delph===
Vermuyden&#x27;s Drain or the Forty Foot Drain was constructed in 1651 to drain fenland to the north of Chatteris. It was joined by the Cranbrook Drain just before it joined the Old Bedford River at Welches Dam. There is a third channel between the Bedford Rivers, which is now known as the River Delph. It begins near where Vermuyden&#x27;s Drain ends, and runs parallel to the Old Bedford River for most of its length, before crossing the washland to join the New Bedford River at Welmore Lake Sluice, above Denver Sluice. Its history is obscure, as its construction does not appear to have been documented. It was built some time after the Bedford Rivers, and at some point, a bend was added to the Old Bedford River at Welches Dam. This probably occurred after 1789, when C. N. Cole&#x27;s map of the Bedford Level showed the original straight course, and before 1821, when R. G. Baker&#x27;s map of Cambridgeshire showed it with the bend. Blair offers an explanation, although he admits that it is conjectural. After Vermuyden&#x27;s Drain was cut, it was found that water could flow up the Old Bedford River, rather than down it towards Denver. Edmund Welche, an engineer who worked with Vermuyden, then built a dam across the Old Bedford River just upstream of the junction. This resulted in water flowing down the Old Bedford River flooding the washes, and so the River Delph was cut. The Old Bedford River was slewed sideways to join the new channel, and a bank was built between the Delph and the downstream portion of the Old Bedford River to maintain the integrity of the washland. Cole writing in 1784 stated that the purpose of the Delph was to make emptying of the washland easier. This has resulted in the Old Bedford River having two sections, which are not connected together. The upstream section flows down from Earith to Welches Dam, and then flows into the River Delph. The Counter drain which runs to the west of the upstream section has a similar kink in it where it joins Vermuyden&#x27;s Drain, and they then flow into the downstream section of the Old Bedford River, which joins the tidal Great Ouse at Old Bedford Sluice near Denver.

Welmore Lake Sluice was originally built as a dam by the proprietors of the Washlands, with the aim of preventing spring tides and small floods from entering the washlands. When an act of Parliament was obtained in 1812 to authorise further embanking of the Hundred Feet Washes, the unsatisfactory nature of its operation was explained. When there were high floods, a small channel was cut through the dam, and the water scoured out a larger channel. Once the floods had subsided, the Bedford Corporation had to rebuild the dam to restore its previous function. This was an expensive process, and was resolved in 1825 when the Welmore Lake Sluice was constructed to replace the dam. At around the same time, the Nine Holes Sluice at the upstream end of the Old Bedford River was replaced by the present Seven Holes Sluice and bridge. This was constructed by the Hundreds Foot Wash Commissioners, and carries the inscription &quot;H.W.C. 1824&quot;. The sluice at the downstream end of the Old Bedford River was also rebuilt prior to 1828. The operation of the sluice at the downstream end was problematic for many years. Together with the sluice at Denver on the old course of the Great Ouse and that at Salters Lode on the outfall from the Middle Level, it prevented tides moving further upstream. The sluice gates were opened when the water level on the downstream side dropped below an agreed level, but in times of heavy rainfall, the water levels were swelled by the mass of water passing from the upland Great Ouse down the New Bedford River. This prevented the doors of the sluices being opened for days at a time, with water backing up in the respective rivers.

===Land drainage===
Artificial drainage of low-lying wetlands generally involves one or both of two different practices: excluding water flowing from high areas from entering the low-lying area, and pumping out water which does manage to get into the low-lying area. The Old Bedford River was constructed on the first principle, as were most of the drainage works constructed in the seventeenth century in the English fens. Both the Old Bedford River and the New Bedford River were intended to reduce or eliminate flooding of the fens of the South Level by carrying the bulk of the water from the Great Ouse River from the uplands of Huntingdonshire to the sea in a straight channel, rather than allowing it to meander across the fens of the South Level. Both now have pumping stations on their banks, and receive water which is pumped from lower lying land.

Mepal pumping station is the outlet for the Sutton and Mepal internal drainage board. The drainage district was created in 1749 by the Isle of Ely Drainage Act 1748 (22 Geo. 2. c. 11), and covered an area of . Pumping was performed by six wind pumps driving scoop wheels, but these were replaced in 1840 by a beam engine manufactured by the Butterley Company and rated at . It drove a scoop wheel which was in diameter, discharging into the Counter Drain. The beam engine was replaced in 1926 by two Vickers-Petter two-stroke hot-bulb diesel engines, driving Gwynnes pumps. One of these engines was replaced by a Brush diesel engine in 1939, after it disintegrated while being started. The other was replaced by a Ruston five-cylinder diesel engine in 1947, which was connected to the 1927 pump by V-belts. The station was upgraded in 1994, when electric pumps were fitted, but the Ruston engine was retained as a backup. The Sutton and Mepal district did not want to become part of the Middle Level in 1848, as it already head its own pumping engine, but more recently, it has been managed by the Middle Level Commissioners.

The Manea and Welney District Drainage Commissioners are the successors to another drainage district, created by the Fen Drainage Act 1758 (32 Geo. 2. c. 13) and the Althorpe Inclosure Act 1799
(39 Geo. 3. c. &quot;90&quot; ). It originally contained of fenland, and like the Sutton and Mepal District, the commissioners declined to become part of the district created by the Middle Level Drainage and Navigation Act 1844 (7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. cvi), as they had installed a pumping engine in 1842. This was a Butterley beam engine, rated at , which replaced several wind pumps. It drove a diameter scoop wheel, and the installation included three Lancashire boilers. This was replaced by two Vickers-Petters 2-stroke hot bulb diesel engines in 1923, each producing and driving a centrifugal pump manufactured by Gwynnes. These were upgraded to Ruston and Hornsby 4-stroke diesel engines in 1948, again driving Gwynnes pumps, developing . The engines were still in situ in 2013, but since 1997 pumping has been performed by four 6-cylinder diesel engines manufactured by Perkins and driving submersible pumps. This station is now known as Glenhouse pumping station, after the house built for the engine driver in 1907. 

The Manea and Welney District Drainage Commissioners are now responsible for an area of , in which they maintain of waterways and operate three pumpings stations. These are shown as Purls Bridge, Welches Dam and Glenhouse on their district plan. Purls Bridge pumping station is located downstream of Purls Bridge farm, and consists of an Allen-Gwynnes electric pump in a small brick building, installed some time after 1975. Details of the Welches Dam pumping station are less clear, as there was a diesel engine and pump in a wooden building at Old Mill Drove from the 1920s, but this became disused around 1975. The pumping station is shown at Old Mill Drove.

Two further pumping stations at Cock Fen and Upwell Fen are operated by Upwell Internal Drainage Board. This district was created by an act of Parliament in 1801, and consisted of two parts, on either side of Popham&#x27;s Eau. It covers an area of and the board manage of watercourses and operate five pumping stations. Nordelph pumping station discharges into Popham&#x27;s Eau, while Padgets Corner and Bedlam Bridge pumping stations discharge into the Sixteen Foot Drain, part of the Middle Level system. Cock Fen pumping station was built in 1975, after it became impossible to drain the area by gravity to the north or west. The rectangular brick building houses diesel pumps. The final pumping station is on the right bank of the Old Bedford River. Lake Farm pumping station is a small, privately-owned installation, which drains a small part of the Ouse Washes.

There is another pumping station at Welches Dam, which pumps water from the Counter Drain and lower Old Bedford River through the Middle Level Barrier Bank and into the River Delph. This was constructed in the 1940s and commissioned in December 1948. It was designed by W. F. Pattison, the Mechanical Engineer of the Great Ouse Catchment Board, who died prior to the completion of the project. The catchment board wanted to prevent water in the lower Old Bedford River overflowing its banks, particularly when the Old Bedford Sluice was blocked by higher water levels in the tidal Great Ouse. A pumping station was seen as a cheaper option than raising the banks of the river for its entire length, and siting it at Welches Dam, between the outflow of the Manea and Welney District Drainage Commissioners and the Sutton and Mepal Internal Drainage Board, meant that the head against which the water had to be pumped was less than it would have been if it had been situated near the Old Bedford Sluice. It was sized to pump 750 tons per minute, based on each of the drainage districts producing 300 tons per minute and a flow of 150 tons per minute from the higher areas of land into Cranbrook Drain. This was achieved by installing two Allen diesel engines and pumps. One of the diesel engines was replaced by a Perkins engine in 1998, which was connected to the original pump by a reduction gearbox. The Allen engine was sold, and both pumpsets lasted until 2011, when the second Allen engine was given to the Internal Fire Museum of Power, based at Tanygroes, Ceredigion. The diesel engines were replaced by electrical pumps, supplied by Bedford Pumps, but the maximum amount of power available meant that the total output of the station was reduced by around one fifth.

When the Welches Dam pumping station is operating, flow in the Old Bedford River above Glenhouse pumping station is reversed. When the Upwell Internal Drainage Board wanted to discharge water into the lower Old Bedford River, the Great Ouse River Authority, successors to the Catchment Board, required them to pay for the installation of a sluice further upstream, so that Welches Dam pumping station would not be overwhelmed by the additional volumes of water. The sluice consists of a single vertical sluice gate located just downstream of Welney Bridge. It was built by the Great Ouse River Authority and commissioned in 1973, prior to the Upwell pumping stations being built.

==Navigation==

The Old Bedford River is navigable between Welches Dam Lock and the Old Bedford Sluice. For a time it was part of the only route between the River Nene and the Great Ouse via the Middle Levels. Well Creek became impassable after commercial carrying ended on the Middle Levels in the 1940s, and Norfolk County Council wanted to fill it in to use part of the course for a road diversion in 1959. This was the start of campaigning to reopen it, resulting in the Well Creek Trust being formed in 1970, and Well Creek was reopened in 1975. The route along the Old River Nene and Well Creek to Salters Lode Lock then became the recommended route to transfer between the two river systems. The use of Welches Dam Lock and the Old Bedford River was subsequently restricted to certain weekends by the Environment Agency, who now manage the waterway.

In 2006, the Environment Agency closed Welches Dam Lock, drained the channel from there to the Middle Levels&#x27; Horseway Lock, and blocked off the lock entrance with piling. Since then, the Inland Waterways Association have campaigned for it to be reopened, but with no success. In 2018, they organised a campaign cruise along the Old Bedford River, to highlight the issue. Access through the Old Bedford Sluice is only possible near low water during neap tides, and is further hampered by silting of the short channel below the sluice. Four narrow boats attempted to pass through the sluice, but only one succeeded. Once on the Old Bedford River, it was joined by a canoe, a kayak and a dinghy. After an overnight stop at Welney, the flotilla continued through Welney Sluice, and despite some problems with weed growth, reached Welches Dam by around midday, where they were greeted by a television news cameraman and crews from the other boats which had not successfully negotiated the Old Bedford Sluice. The return passage through the sluice was somewhat easier.

One solution proposed by Project Hereward, an umbrella organisation for a number of local waterways groups, is to raise the water level in the Welches Dam to Horseway Lock channel, so that it is level with the Old Bedford River. This would overcome the problem of Welches Dam Lock being very small, at only long. A small change to the upper gates at Horseway Lock would be required to accommodate the change in level. Project Hereward estimated the cost of this work to be £3 million in 2018, but the Environment Agency costed it at £9 million.

Modification to the Old Bedford River has been proposed as part of the Fens Waterways Link. In addition to an inland waterway from Boston to Peterborough, the project includes a circular route which includes sections of the Middle Level Navigations and the Great Ouse from Denver to Earith. The missing link is the section from Earith back to the Middle Level Navigations, for which three options have been proposed. One was to build an aqueduct to carry boats from Welches Dam over the Old Bedford River and into the tidal New Bedford River, which joins the Great Ouse above Hermitage Lock. The second was to build a new lock between Welches Dam and the Old Bedford River. The section above Welches Dam to the sluice at Earith would be enlarged so that it became navigable, and a new lock structure would be built to bypass Earith Sluice. The third option involved making the Twenty Foot River navigable towards Chatteris. This then becomes Fenton&#x27;s Lode, and the new route would follow Fenton&#x27;s Lode to High Fen pumping station. A new section of canal would run from the pumping station to a drainage ditch called Cranbrook Drain, which would be enlarged and join the Old Bedford River below Earith Sluice. Upgrading of the final section of the Old Bedford River would be required, and again, a lock structure to bypass Earith Sluice would be needed. The second route was the preferred option in 2003, although Lincolnshire County Council still showed all three routes on their 2018 Waterways Development Strategy document.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the Old Bedford River and River Delph, which includes the Ouse Washes, was as follows in 2019.

The water quality in the river has deteriorated since 2014, when it was rated good for ecological status. This is partly due to the fact that dissolved oxygen levels are now included in the assessment. Other reasons for the quality being less than good are low flow and physical modification of the channel, which is managed for flood protection. Both of these factors affect fish populations within the river. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and mercury compounds, none of which had previously been included in the assessment.

<text>The nipple is a raised region of tissue on the surface of the breast from which, in lactating females, milk from the mammary gland leaves the body through the lactiferous ducts to nurse an infant. The milk can flow through the nipple passively, or it can be ejected by smooth muscle contractions that occur along with the ductal system. The nipple is surrounded by the areola, which is often a darker colour than the surrounding skin.

Male mammals also have nipples but without the same level of function or prominence. A nipple is often called a &quot;teat&quot; when referring to non-humans. &quot;Nipple&quot; or &quot;teat&quot; can also be used to describe the flexible mouthpiece of a baby bottle.

In humans, the nipples of both males and females can be sexually stimulated as part of sexual arousal. In many cultures, female nipples are sexualized, or regarded as sex objects and evaluated in terms of their physical characteristics and sex appeal. Some cultures have little to no sexualization of the nipple, and going topless presents no barrier.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;nipple&quot; most likely originates as a diminutive of &quot;neb&quot;, an Old English word meaning &quot;beak&quot;, &quot;nose&quot;, or &quot;face&quot;, and which is of Germanic origin. The words &quot;teat&quot; and &quot;tit&quot; share a Germanic ancestor. The second of the two, tit, was inherited directly from Proto-Germanic, while the first entered English via Old French.

== Structure ==
In mammals, a nipple (also called mammary papilla or teat) is a small projection of skin containing the outlets for 15–20 lactiferous ducts arranged cylindrically around the tip. Marsupials and eutherian mammals typically have an even number of nipples arranged bilaterally, from as few as 2 to as many as 19.

The skin of the nipple is rich in a supply of special nerves that are sensitive to certain stimuli: these are slowly-adapting and rapidly-adapting cutaneous mechanoreceptors. Mechanoreceptors are identified respectively by Type I slowly-adapting with multiple Merkel corpuscle end-organs and Type II slowly-adapting with single Ruffini corpuscle end-organs, as well as Type I rapidly-adapting with multiple Meissner corpuscle end-organs and Type II rapidly-adapting with single Pacinian corpuscle end-organs. The dominant nerve supply to the nipple comes from the lateral cutaneous branches of fourth intercostal nerve. The nipple is also used as an anatomical landmark. It marks the T4 (fourth thoracic vertebra) dermatome and rests over the approximate level of the diaphragm.

The arterial supply to the nipple and breast originates from the anterior intercostal branches of the internal thoracic (mammary) arteries; lateral thoracic artery; and thoracodorsal arteries. The venous vessels parallel the arteries. The lymphatic ducts that drain the nipple are the same for the breast. The axillary nodes are the apical axillary nodes, the lateral group and the anterior group. 75% of the lymph is drained through the axillary lymph nodes located near the armpit. The rest of the drainage leaves the nipple and breast through infroclavicular, pectoral, or parasternal nodes.

Since nipples change throughout the life span in men and women, the anatomy of the nipple can change and this change may be expected and considered normal.

===In male mammals===

Almost all mammals have nipples. Why males have nipples has been the subject of scientific research. Differences among the sexes (called sexual dimorphism) within a given species are considered by evolutionary biologists to be mostly the result of sexual selection, directly or indirectly. There is a consensus that the male nipple exists because there is no particular advantage to males losing the trait. In consequence, some biologists would call the male nipple a spandrel.

In humans, the nipples are often surrounded by body hair.

==Function==


The physiological purpose of nipples is to deliver milk, produced in the female mammary glands during lactation, to an infant. During breastfeeding, nipple stimulation by an infant will stimulate the release of oxytocin from the hypothalamus. Oxytocin is a hormone that increases during pregnancy and acts on the breast to help produce the milk-ejection reflex. Oxytocin release from the nipple stimulation of the infant causes the uterus to contract even after childbirth. The strong uterine contractions that are caused by the stimulation of the mother&#x27;s nipples help the uterus contract to clamp down the uterine arteries. These contractions are necessary to prevent post-partum haemorrhage.

When the infant suckles or stimulates the nipple, oxytocin levels rise and small muscles in the breast contract, moving the milk through the milk ducts. The result of nipple stimulation by the infant helps to move breast milk out through the ducts and to the nipple. This contraction of milk is called the &quot;let-down reflex&quot;. Latching on refers to the infant fastening onto the nipple to breastfeed. A good attachment is when the bottom of the areola (the area around the nipple) is in the infant&#x27;s mouth and the nipple is drawn back inside his or her mouth. A poor latch results in insufficient nipple stimulation to create the let down reflex. The nipple is poorly stimulated when the baby latches on too close to the tip of the nipple. This poor attachment can cause sore and cracked nipples and a reluctance of the mother to continue to breastfeed. After birth, the milk supply increases based upon the continuous and increasing stimulation of the nipple by the infant. If the baby increases nursing time at the nipple, the mammary glands respond to this stimulation by increasing milk production.

==Clinical significance==
===Pain===

Nipple pain can be a disincentive for breastfeeding. Sore nipples that progress to cracked nipples is of concern since many women cease breastfeeding due to the pain. In some instances, an ulcer will form on the nipple. One reason for the development of cracked and sore nipples is the incorrect latching-on of the infant to the nipple. If a nipple appears to be wedge-shaped, white and flattened, this may indicate that the attachment of the infant is not good and there is a potential of developing cracked nipples. Herpes infection of the nipple is painful. Nipple pain can also be caused by excessive friction of clothing against the nipple that causes a fissure.

===Discharge===
Nipple discharge refers to any fluid that seeps out of the nipple of the breast. Discharge from the nipple does not occur in lactating women. And discharge in non-pregnant women or women who are not breastfeeding may not cause concern. Men that have discharge from their nipples are not typical. Discharge from the nipples of men or boys may indicate a problem. Discharge from the nipples can appear without squeezing or may only be noticeable if the nipples are squeezed. One nipple can have discharge while the other does not. The discharge can be clear, green, bloody, brown or straw-coloured. The consistency can be thick, thin, sticky or watery.

Some cases of nipple discharge will clear on their own without treatment. Nipple discharge is most often not cancer (benign), but rarely, it can be a sign of breast cancer. It is important to determine what is causing the discharge and to get treatment. Reasons for nipple discharge include:
* Pregnancy
* Recent breastfeeding
* Rubbing on the area from a bra or T-shirt
* Injury to the breast
* Infection
* Inflammation and clogging of the breast ducts
* Noncancerous pituitary tumors
* Small growth in the breast (usually not cancer)
* Severe underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)
* Fibrocystic breast (normal lumpiness in the breast)
* Use of certain medicines
* Use of certain herbs, such as anise and fennel
* Widening of the milk ducts

Sometimes, babies can have nipple discharge. This is caused by hormones from the mother before birth. It usually goes away in two weeks. Cancers such as Paget&#x27;s disease (a rare type of cancer involving the skin of the nipple) can also cause nipple discharge.

Nipple discharge that is not normal is bloody, comes from only one nipple, or comes out on its own without squeezing or touching the nipple. Nipple discharge is more likely to be normal if it comes out of both nipples or happens when the nipples are squeezed. Squeezing the nipple to check for discharge can make it worse. Leaving the nipple alone may make the discharge stop.

Nipple discharge in a male is usually of more concern. Most of the time a mammogram and an examination of the fluid is done. A biopsy is often performed. A fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy can be fast and least painful. A very thin, hollow needle and slight suction will be used to remove a small sample from under the nipple. Using a local anesthetic to numb the skin may not be necessary since a thin needle is used for the biopsy. Receiving an injection to prevent pain from the biopsy may be more painful than the biopsy itself.

Some men develop a condition known as gynecomastia, in which the breast tissue under the nipple develops and grows. Discharge from the nipple can occur. The nipple may swell in some men possibly due to increased levels of estrogen.

===Appearance===
Changes in appearance may be normal or related to disease.
* Inverted nipples – This is normal if the nipples have always been indented inward and can easily point out when touched. If the nipples are pointing in and this is new, this is an unexpected change.
* Skin puckering of the nipple – This can be caused by scar tissue from surgery or an infection. Often, scar tissue forms for no reason. Most of the time this issue does not need treatment. This is an unexpected change. This change can be of concern since puckering or retraction of the nipple can indicate an underlying change in breast tissue that may be cancerous.
* The nipple is warm to the touch, red or painful – This can be an infection. It is rarely due to breast cancer.
* Scaly, flaking, or itchy nipple – This is most often due to eczema or a bacterial or fungal infection. This change is not expected. Flaking, scaly, or itchy nipples can be a sign of Paget&#x27;s disease.
* Thickened skin with large pores – This is called peau d&#x27;orange because the skin looks like an orange peel. An infection in the breast or inflammatory breast cancer can cause this problem. This is not an expected change.
* Retracted nipples – The nipple was raised above the surface but changes, begins to pull inward, and does not come out when stimulated.
The average projection and size of human female nipples is slightly more than .

===Breast cancer===
Symptoms of breast cancer can often be seen first by changes of the nipple and areola, although not all women have the same symptoms, and some people do not have any signs or symptoms at all. A person may find out they have breast cancer after a routine mammogram.
Warning signs can include:
* New lump in the nipple, or breast or armpit
* Thickening or swelling of part of the breast, areola, or nipple
* Irritation or dimpling of breast skin
* Redness or flaky skin in the nipple area or the breast
* Pulling in of the nipple or pain in the nipple area
* Nipple discharge other than breast milk, including blood
* Any change in the size or the shape of the breast or nipple
* Pain in any area of the breast

Changes in the nipple are not necessarily symptoms or signs of breast cancer. Other conditions of the nipple can mimic the signs and symptoms of breast cancer.

===Vertical transmission===
Some infections are transmitted through the nipple, especially if irritation or injury to the nipple has occurred. In these circumstances, the nipple itself can become infected with Candida that is present in the mouth of the breastfeeding infant. The infant will transmit the infection to the mother. Most of the time, this infection is localized to the area of the nipple. In some cases, the infection can progress to become a full-blown case of mastitis or breast infection. In some cases, if the mother has an infection with no nipple cracks or ulcerations, it is still safe to breastfeed the infant.

Herpes infection of the nipple can go unnoticed because the lesions are small but usually are quite painful. Herpes in the newborn is a serious and sometimes fatal infection. Transmission of Hepatitis C and B to the infant can occur if the nipples are cracked.

Other infections can be transmitted through a break of the skin of the nipple and can infect the infant.

===Other disorders===

* Nipple bleb
* Candida infection of the nipple
* Eczema of the nipple
* Inverted nipple
* Staphylococcus infection of the nipple
* Edematous areola
* Herpes infection of the nipple
* Reynaud phenomenon of the nipple
* Flat nipple
===Surgery===
A nipple-sparing/subcutaneous mastectomy is a surgical procedure where breast tissue is removed, but the nipple and areola are preserved. This procedure was historically done only prophylactically or with mastectomy for the benign disease over the fear of increased cancer development in retained areolar ductal tissue. Recent series suggest that it may be an oncologically sound procedure for tumours not in the subareolar position.

==Society and culture==
===Exposure===
The cultural tendency to hide the female nipple under clothing has existed in Western culture since the 1800s. As female nipples are often perceived an intimate part, covering them might have originated under Victorian morality as with riding side saddle. Exposing the entire breast and nipple is a form of protest for some and a crime for others. The exposure of nipples is usually considered immodest and in some instances is viewed as lewd or indecent behavior.

A case in Erie, Pennsylvania, concerning the exposure of breasts and nipple proceeded to the United States Supreme Court. The Erie ordinance was regulating the nipple in public as an act that is committed when a person &quot;knowingly or intentionally, ... appears in a state of nudity commits Public Indecency.&quot; Later in the statute, nudity is further described as an uncovered female nipple. But nipple exposure of a man was not regulated. An opinion column credited to Cecil Adams noted: &quot;Ponder the significance of that. A man walks around bare-chested and the worst that happens is he won&#x27;t get served in restaurants. But a woman who goes topless is legally in the same boat as if she&#x27;d had sex in public. That may seem crazy, but in the US it&#x27;s a permissible law.&quot;

The legality around the exposure of nipples is inconsistently regulated throughout the US. Some states do not allow the visualization of any part of the breast. Other jurisdictions prohibit any female chest anatomy by banning anatomical structures that lie below the top of the areola or nipple. Such is the case in West Virginia and Massachusetts. West Virginia&#x27;s regulation is very specific and is not likely to be misinterpreted, stating: &quot;[The] display of &#x27;any portion of the cleavage of the human female breast exhibited by a dress, blouse, skirt, leotard, bathing suit, or other wearing apparel [is permitted] provided the areola is not exposed, in whole or in part.

The Instagram social media site has a &quot;no nipples&quot; policy with exceptions: material that is not allowed includes &quot;some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is OK, too&quot;. Previously, Instagram had removed images of nursing mothers. Instagram removed images of Rihanna and had her account cancelled in 2014 when she posted selfies with nipples. This was incentive for the Twitter campaign #FreeTheNipple. In 2016, an Instagram page invited users to post images of nipples from both sexes; @genderless_nipples, which displays close ups of both the nipples of men and women for the purpose of spotlighting what may be inconsistency. Some contributors have circumvented the policy. Facebook has also been struggling to define its nipple policy.

Filmmaker Lina Esco made a film entitled &quot;Free the Nipple&quot;, which is about &quot;laws against female toplessness or restrictions on images of female, but not male, nipples&quot;, which Esco states is an example of sexism in society.

===Sexuality===
Nipples can be sensitive to touch, and nipple stimulation can incite sexual arousal. Few women report experiencing orgasm from nipple stimulation. Before Komisaruk et al.&#x27;s functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) research on nipple stimulation in 2011, reports of women achieving orgasm from nipple stimulation relied solely on anecdotal evidence. Komisaruk&#x27;s study was the first to map the female genitals onto the sensory portion of the brain; it indicates that sensation from the nipples travels to the same part of the brain as sensations from the vagina, clitoris and cervix, and that these reported orgasms are genital orgasms caused by nipple stimulation, and may be directly linked to the genital sensory cortex (&quot;the genital area of the brain&quot;).

===Piercings===

===In business===
Some companies and non-profit organisations have used the word &quot;nipple&quot; or images of nipples to draw attention to their product or cause.

<text>Donovan Phillips Leitch (born 10 May 1946), known mononymously as Donovan, is a Scottish musician, songwriter and record producer. He emerged from the British folk scene in early 1965 and subsequently scored multiple international hit singles and albums during the late 1960s. His work became emblematic of the flower power era with its blend of folk, pop, psychedelica and jazz stylings.

Donovan first achieved recognition with live performances on the pop TV series &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; in 1965. Having signed with Pye Records that year, he recorded singles and two albums in the folk vein for Hickory Records, scoring three UK hit singles: &quot;Catch the Wind&quot;, &quot;Colours&quot; and &quot;Universal Soldier&quot;, the last written by Buffy Sainte-Marie. He then signed to CBS/Epic in the US and became more successful internationally, beginning a long collaboration with British record producer Mickie Most. In September 1966, &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot; topped America&#x27;s &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for one week and went to No. 2 in Britain, followed by &quot;Mellow Yellow&quot; at US No. 2 in December 1966, then 1968&#x27;s &quot;Hurdy Gurdy Man&quot; in the top 5 in both countries and then &quot;Atlantis&quot;, which reached US No. 7 in May 1969. The compilation &quot;Donovan&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; was released in March 1969 and peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard 200.

Donovan became a friend of other prominent musicians such as Joan Baez, Brian Jones and the Beatles. He taught John Lennon a finger-picking guitar style in 1968 that Lennon employed in &quot;Dear Prudence&quot;, &quot;Julia&quot;, &quot;Happiness Is a Warm Gun&quot; and other songs. His backing musicians included the Jeff Beck Group and John Bonham, Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones, who later rose to fame as members of Led Zeppelin. Donovan&#x27;s commercial fortunes waned after parting with Most in 1969, and he left the industry for a time.

Donovan continued to perform and record intermittently in the 1970s and 1980s. His musical style and hippie image were scorned by critics, especially after the rise of punk rock. His performing and recording became sporadic until a revival in the 1990s with the emergence of Britain&#x27;s rave scene and in 1994, he moved permanently to Ireland where he still lives. In 1996 he recorded the album &quot;Sutras&quot; with producer Rick Rubin and in 2004 made the album &quot;Beat Cafe&quot;. Donovan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2014.

==Early life==
Donovan was born on 10 May 1946, in Maryhill, Glasgow to Donald and Winifred (née Phillips) Leitch. His grandmothers were Irish. He contracted polio as a child. The disease and treatment left him with a limp. His family moved to the new town of Hatfield, Hertfordshire, England. Influenced by his family&#x27;s love of folk music, he began playing the guitar at 14. He enrolled in art school but soon dropped out, to live out his beatnik aspirations by going on the road.

==Music career==

===1964–66: Rise to fame===

Returning to Hatfield, Donovan spent several months playing in local clubs, absorbing the folk scene around his home in St Albans, learning the crosspicking guitar technique from local players such as Mac MacLeod and Mick Softley and writing his first songs. In 1964, he travelled to Manchester with Gypsy Dave, then spent the summer in Torquay, Devon. In Torquay he stayed with Mac MacLeod and took up busking, studying the guitar and learning traditional folk and blues.

In late 1964, Donovan was offered a management and publishing contract by Peter Eden and Geoff Stephens of Pye Records in London, for which he recorded a 10-track demo tape which included the original of his first single, &quot;Catch the Wind&quot; and &quot;Josie&quot;. The first song revealed the influence of Woody Guthrie and Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott, who had also influenced Bob Dylan. Dylan comparisons followed for some time. In an interview with KFOK radio in the US on 14 June 2005, MacLeod said: &quot;The press were fond of calling Donovan a Dylan clone as they had both been influenced by the same sources: Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott, Jesse Fuller, Woody Guthrie and many more.&quot;

While recording the demo, Donovan befriended Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones, who was recording nearby. He had recently met Jones&#x27; ex-girlfriend, Linda Lawrence, who is the mother of Jones&#x27; son, Julian Brian (Jones) Leitch. The on-off romantic relationship that developed over five years was a force in Donovan&#x27;s career. She influenced Donovan&#x27;s music but refused to marry him and she moved to the United States for several years in the late 1960s. They met by chance in 1970 and married soon after. Donovan had other relationships – one of which resulted in the birth of his first two children, Donovan Leitch and Ione Skye, both of whom became actors.

====Donovan and Dylan====
During Bob Dylan&#x27;s trip to the UK in the spring of 1965, the British music press were making comparisons of the two singer-songwriters which they presented as a rivalry. This prompted The Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones to say,

Donovan is the undercurrent In D. A. Pennebaker&#x27;s film &quot;Dont Look Back&quot; documenting Dylan&#x27;s tour. Near the start of the film, Dylan opens a newspaper and exclaims, &quot;Donovan? Who is this Donovan?&quot; and Alan Price from The Animals spurred the rivalry on by telling Dylan that Donovan is a better guitar player, but that he had only been around for three months. Throughout the film Donovan&#x27;s name is seen next to Dylan&#x27;s on newspaper headlines and on posters in the background, and Dylan and his friends refer to him consistently.

Donovan finally appears in the second half of the film, along with Derroll Adams, in Dylan&#x27;s suite at the Savoy Hotel despite Donovan&#x27;s management refusing to allow journalists to be present, saying they did not want &quot;any stunt on the lines of the disciple meeting the messiah&quot;. According to Pennebaker, Dylan told him not to film the encounter, and Donovan played a song that sounded just like &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; but with different words. When confronted with lifting his tune, Donovan said that he thought it was an old folk song. Once the camera rolled, Donovan plays his song &quot;To Sing For You&quot; and then asks Dylan to play &quot;Baby Blue&quot;. Dylan later told &quot;Melody Maker&quot;: &quot;He played some songs to me. ... I like him. ... He&#x27;s a nice guy.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot; noted that Dylan had mentioned Donovan in his song &quot;Talking World War Three Blues&quot; and that the crowd had jeered, to which Dylan had responded backstage: &quot;I didn&#x27;t mean to put the guy down in my songs. I just did it for a joke, that&#x27;s all.&quot;

In an interview for the BBC in 2001 to mark Dylan&#x27;s 60th birthday, Donovan acknowledged Dylan as an influence early in his career while distancing himself from &quot;Dylan clone&quot; allegations:

====Collaboration with Mickie Most====
In late 1965, Donovan split with his original management and signed with Ashley Kozak, who was working for Brian Epstein&#x27;s NEMS Enterprises. Kozak introduced Donovan to American businessman Allen Klein (later manager of the Rolling Stones and, in their final months, the Beatles). Klein in turn introduced Donovan to producer Mickie Most, who had chart-topping productions with the Animals, Lulu and Herman&#x27;s Hermits. Most produced all Donovan&#x27;s recordings during this period, although Donovan said in his autobiography that some recordings were self-produced, with little input from Most. Their collaboration produced successful singles and albums, recorded with London session players including Big Jim Sullivan, Jack Bruce, Danny Thompson, and future Led Zeppelin members John Paul Jones and Jimmy Page.

Many of Donovan&#x27;s late 1960s recordings featured musicians including his key musical collaborator John Cameron on piano, Danny Thompson (from Pentangle) or Spike Heatley on upright bass, Tony Carr on drums and congas and Harold McNair on saxophone and flute. Carr&#x27;s conga style and McNair&#x27;s flute playing are a feature of many recordings. Cameron, McNair and Carr also accompanied Donovan on several concert tours and can be heard on his 1968 live album &quot;Donovan in Concert&quot;.

====&quot;Sunshine Superman&quot;====

By 1966, Donovan had shed the Dylan/Guthrie influences and become one of the first British pop musicians to adopt flower power. He immersed himself in jazz, blues, Eastern music and the new generation of counterculture-era US West Coast bands such as Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead. He was entering his most creative phase as a songwriter and recording artist, working with Mickie Most and with arranger, musician and jazz fan John Cameron. Their first collaboration was &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot;, one of the first psychedelic pop records.

Donovan&#x27;s rise stalled in December 1965 when &quot;Billboard&quot; broke news of the impending production deal between Klein, Most and Donovan, and then reported that Donovan was to sign with Epic Records in the US. Despite Kozak&#x27;s denials, Pye Records dropped the single and a contract dispute ensued, because Pye had a US licensing arrangement with Warner Bros. Records. As a result, the UK release of the &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot; LP was delayed for months, robbing it of the impact it would have had. Another outcome was that the UK and US versions of this and later albums differed – three of his Epic LPs were not released in the UK and &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot; was issued in a different form in each country. Several tracks on his late 1960s Epic (US) LPs were not released in the UK for many years. The legal dispute continued into early 1966. During the hiatus, Donovan holidayed in Greece, where he wrote &quot;Writer in the Sun&quot;, inspired by rumours that his recording career was over. He toured the US and appeared on episode 23 of Pete Seeger&#x27;s television show &quot;Rainbow Quest&quot; in 1966 with Shawn Phillips and Rev. Gary Davis. After his return to London, he developed his friendship with Paul McCartney and contributed the line &quot;sky of blue and sea of green&quot; to &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;.

By spring 1966, the American contract problems had been resolved and Donovan signed a $100,000 deal with Epic Records. Donovan and Most went to CBS Studios in Los Angeles, where they recorded tracks for an LP, much composed during the preceding year. Although folk elements were prominent, the album showed increasing influence of jazz, American west coast psychedelia and folk rock – especially the Byrds. The LP sessions were completed in May and &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot; was released in the US as a single in June. It was a success, selling 800,000 in six weeks and reaching No. 1. It went on to sell over one million and was awarded a gold disc. The LP followed in August, preceded by orders of 250,000 copies, reached No. 11 on the US album chart and sold over half a million.

The US version of the &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot; album features instruments including acoustic bass, sitar, saxophone, tablas and congas, harpsichord, strings and oboe. Highlights include the swinging &quot;The Fat Angel&quot;, which Donovan&#x27;s book confirms was written for Cass Elliot of the Mamas &amp; the Papas. The song is notable for naming the Jefferson Airplane before they became known internationally and before Grace Slick joined. Other tracks include &quot;Bert&#x27;s Blues&quot; (a tribute to Bert Jansch), &quot;Guinevere&quot; and &quot;Legend of a Girl Child Linda&quot;, a track featuring voice, acoustic guitar and a small orchestra for over six minutes.

The album also features the sitar, which was played by American folk-rock singer Shawn Phillips. Donovan met Phillips in London in 1965 and he became a friend and early collaborator, playing acoustic guitar and sitar on recordings including &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot; as well as accompanying Donovan at concerts and on Pete Seeger&#x27;s TV show. Creatively, Phillips served as a silent partner in the gestation of many of Donovan&#x27;s songs from the era, with the singer later acknowledging that Phillips primarily composed &quot;Season of the Witch&quot;. Several songs including the title track had a harder edge. The driving, jazzy &quot;The Trip&quot;, named after a Los Angeles club name, chronicled an LSD trip during his time in L.A. and is loaded with references to his sojourn on the West Coast, and names Dylan and Baez. The third &quot;heavy&quot; song was &quot;Season of the Witch&quot;. Recorded with American and British session players, it features Donovan&#x27;s first recorded performance on electric guitar. The song was covered by Julie Driscoll, Brian Auger and the Trinity on their first LP in 1967 and Al Kooper and Stephen Stills recorded an 11-minute version on the 1968 album, &quot;Super Session&quot;. Donovan&#x27;s version is also in the closing sequence of the Gus Van Sant film, &quot;To Die For&quot;. 

Because of earlier contractual problems, the UK version of &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot; LP was not released for another nine months. This was a compilation of tracks from the US albums &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot; and &quot;Mellow Yellow&quot;. Donovan did not choose the tracks.

====Mellow Yellow====

On 24 October 1966, Epic released the single &quot;Mellow Yellow&quot;, arranged by John Paul Jones and purportedly featuring Paul McCartney on backing vocals, but not in the chorus. In his autobiography Donovan explained &quot;electrical banana&quot; was a reference to a &quot;yellow-coloured vibrator&quot;. The song became Donovan&#x27;s signature tune in the US and reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, No. 3 on the Cash Box chart, and it earned a gold record award for sales of more than one million in the US.

Through the first half of 1967, Donovan worked on a double-album studio project, which he produced. In January he gave a concert at the Royal Albert Hall accompanied by a ballerina who danced during a 12-minute performance of &quot;Golden Apples&quot;. On 14 January, New Musical Express reported he was to write incidental music for a National Theatre production of &quot;As You Like It&quot;, but this did not come to fruition. His version of &quot;Under the Greenwood Tree&quot; did appear on &quot;A Gift from a Flower to a Garden&quot;.

In March Epic released the &quot;Mellow Yellow&quot; LP (not released in the UK), which reached No. 14 in the US album charts, plus a non-album single, &quot;Epistle to Dippy&quot;, a Top 20 hit in the US. Written as an open letter to a school friend, the song had a pacifist message as well as psychedelic imagery. The real &quot;Dippy&quot; was in the British Army in Malaysia. According to Brian Hogg, who wrote the liner notes for the Donovan boxed set &quot;&quot;, Dippy heard the song, contacted Donovan and left the army. On 9 February 1967, Donovan was among guests invited by the Beatles to Abbey Road Studios for the orchestral overdub for &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, the finale to &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;.

====Arrest====
On 10June 1966, Donovan became the first high-profile British pop star to be arrested for possession of cannabis. Donovan&#x27;s drug use was mostly restricted to cannabis, with occasional use of LSD and mescaline. His LSD use is thought to be referenced indirectly in some of his lyrics. Public attention was drawn to his marijuana use by the TV documentary &quot;A Boy Called Donovan&quot; in early 1966, which showed the singer and friends smoking cannabis at a party thrown by the film crew. Donovan&#x27;s arrest proved to be the first in a long series involving the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. In early 1967, Donovan was subject of an exposé in the &quot;News of the World&quot;.

According to Donovan, the article was based on an interview by an ex-girlfriend of his friend Gypsy Dave. The article was the first in a three-part series, &quot;Drugs &amp; Pop Stars – Facts That Will Shock You.&quot; It was quickly shown some claims were false. A &quot;News of the World&quot; reporter claimed to have spent an evening with Mick Jagger, who allegedly discussed his drug use and offered drugs to companions. He had mistaken Brian Jones for Jagger, and Jagger sued the newspaper for libel. Among other supposed revelations were claims that Donovan and stars including members of The Who, Cream, The Rolling Stones and The Moody Blues regularly smoked marijuana, used other drugs and held parties where the recently banned hallucinogen LSD was used, specifically naming the Who&#x27;s Pete Townshend and Cream&#x27;s Ginger Baker.

It emerged later that the &quot;News of the World&quot; reporters were passing information to the police. In the late 1990s, &quot;The Guardian&quot; said &quot;News of the World&quot; reporters had alerted police to the party at Keith Richards&#x27;s home, which was raided on 12 February 1967. Although Donovan&#x27;s was not as sensational as the later arrests of Jagger and Richards, he was refused entry to the US until late 1967. He could not appear at the Monterey International Pop Festival in June that year.

===1967–69: International success===
In July 1967, Epic released &quot;There Is a Mountain&quot;, which just missed the US top ten and was later used as the basis for the Allman Brothers Band&#x27;s &quot;Mountain Jam&quot;. In September, Donovan toured the US, backed by a jazz group and accompanied by his father, who introduced the show. Later that month, Epic released Donovan&#x27;s fifth album, a set titled, &quot;A Gift from a Flower to a Garden&quot;, the first rock music box set and only the third pop-rock double album released. It was split into halves. The first, &quot;Wear Your Love Like Heaven&quot;, was for people of his generation who would one day be parents; the second, &quot;For Little Ones&quot;, was songs Donovan had written for coming generations. Worried it might be a poor seller, Epic boss Clive Davis also insisted the albums be split and sold separately in the US (the &quot;Wear Your Love Like Heaven&quot; album cover was photographed at Bodiam Castle), but his fears were unfounded – although it took time, the original boxed set sold steadily, eventually peaking at 19 in the US album chart and achieving gold record status in the US in early 1970.

The psychedelic and mystical overtones were unmistakable – the front cover featured an infra-red photograph by Karl Ferris showing Donovan at Bodiam Castle, dressed in a robe, holding flowers and peacock feathers, while the back photo showed him holding hands with Indian guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The liner notes included an appeal for young people to give up drugs. His disavowal of drugs came after his time with the Maharishi in Rishikesh, a topic discussed in a two-part interview for the first two issues of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

In late 1967 Donovan contributed two songs to the Ken Loach film &quot;Poor Cow&quot;. &quot;Be Not Too Hard&quot; was a musical setting of Christopher Logue&#x27;s poem &quot;September Song&quot; and was later recorded by such artists as Joan Baez and Shusha Guppy. The title track, originally entitled &quot;Poor Love&quot;, was the B-side of his next single, &quot;Jennifer Juniper&quot;, which was inspired by Jenny Boyd, sister of George Harrison&#x27;s wife, Pattie Boyd and was another top 40 hit in the US. Donovan developed interest in eastern mysticism and claims to have interested the Beatles in transcendental meditation.

In early 1968 he was part of the group that traveled to the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Rishikesh. The visit gained worldwide attention thanks to the presence of all four Beatles as well as Beach Boys lead singer Mike Love, as well as actress Mia Farrow and her sister Prudence (who inspired Lennon to write &quot;Dear Prudence&quot;). According to a 1968 Paul McCartney interview with Radio Luxembourg, it was during this time that Donovan taught Lennon and McCartney finger-picking guitar styles including the clawhammer, which he had learned from Mac MacLeod. Lennon used this technique on songs including &quot;Dear Prudence&quot;, &quot;Julia&quot;, &quot;Happiness is a Warm Gun&quot; and &quot;Look at Me&quot;, and McCartney with &quot;Blackbird&quot; and &quot;Mother Nature&#x27;s Son&quot;.
Donovan&#x27;s next single, in May 1968, was the psychedelic &quot;Hurdy Gurdy Man&quot;. The liner notes from EMI&#x27;s reissues say the song was intended for Mac MacLeod, who had a heavy rock band called Hurdy Gurdy. After hearing MacLeod&#x27;s version, Donovan considered giving it to Jimi Hendrix, but when Most heard it, he convinced Donovan to record it himself. Donovan tried to get Hendrix to play, but he was on tour. Jimmy Page played electric guitar in some studio sessions and is credited with playing on the song. Alternatively, it is credited to Alan Parker.

Donovan credits Page and &quot;Allen Hollsworth&quot; (a misspelling of Allan Holdsworth) as the &quot;guitar wizards&quot; for the song, saying they created &quot;a new kind of metal folk&quot;.

Since John Bonham and John Paul Jones also played, Donovan said perhaps the session inspired the formation of Led Zeppelin. The heavier sound of &quot;Hurdy Gurdy Man&quot; was an attempt by Most and Donovan to reach a wider audience in the US, where hard-rock groups like Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience were having an impact. The song became one of Donovan&#x27;s biggest hits, making the Top 5 in the UK and the US and the Top 10 in Australia.

In July 1968, Epic released &quot;Donovan in Concert&quot;, the recording of his Anaheim concert in September 1967. The cover featured only a painting by Fleur Cowles (with neither the artist&#x27;s name nor the title). The album contained two of his big hits and songs which would have been new to the audience. The expanded double CD from 2006 contained &quot;Epistle To Derroll&quot;, a tribute to one of his formative influences, Derroll Adams. The album also includes extended group arrangements of &quot;Young Girl Blues&quot; and &quot;The Pebble and the Man&quot;, a song later reworked and retitled as &quot;Happiness Runs&quot;. In the summer of 1968, Donovan worked on a second LP of children&#x27;s songs, released in 1971 as the double album, &quot;HMS Donovan&quot;. In September, Epic released a single, &quot;Laléna&quot;, a subdued acoustic ballad which reached the low 30s in the US. The album &quot;The Hurdy Gurdy Man&quot; followed (not released in the UK), continuing the style of the &quot;Mellow Yellow&quot; LP, and reached 20 in the US, despite containing two earlier hits, the title track and &quot;Jennifer Juniper&quot;.

After another US tour in the autumn he collaborated with Paul McCartney, who was producing &quot;Postcard&quot;, the debut LP by Welsh singer Mary Hopkin. Hopkin covered three Donovan songs: &quot;Lord Of The Reedy River&quot;, &quot;Happiness Runs&quot; and &quot;Voyage of the Moon&quot;. McCartney returned the favour by playing tambourine and singing backing vocals on Donovan&#x27;s next single, &quot;Atlantis&quot;, which was released in the UK (with &quot;I Love My Shirt&quot; as the B-side) in late November and reached 23.

Early in 1969, the comedy film &quot;If It&#x27;s Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium&quot; featured music by Donovan; the title tune was written by him and sung by J. P. Rags, and he also performed &quot;Lord of the Reedy River&quot; in the film as a singer at a youth hostel. On 20 January, Epic released the single, &quot;To Susan on the West Coast Waiting&quot;, with &quot;Atlantis&quot; as the B-side. The A-side, a gentle calypso-styled song, contained another anti-war message and became a moderate Top 40 US hit. However, when DJs in America and Australia flipped it and began playing &quot;Atlantis&quot;, that became a hit. The gentle &quot;Atlantis&quot; later formed the backdrop to a violent scene in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 1990 film &quot;GoodFellas&quot;. &quot;Atlantis&quot; was revived in 2000 for an episode of &quot;Futurama&quot; titled &quot;The Deep South&quot; (2ACV12) which aired on 16 April that year. For this episode Donovan recorded a satirical version of the song describing the Lost City of Atlanta which featured in the episode.

In March 1969 (too soon to include &quot;Atlantis&quot;), Epic and Pye released &quot;Donovan&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, which included four previous singles – &quot;Epistle To Dippy&quot;, &quot;There is a Mountain&quot;, &quot;Jennifer Juniper&quot; and &quot;Laléna&quot;, as well as rerecorded versions of &quot;Colours&quot; and &quot;Catch The Wind&quot; (which had been unavailable to Epic because of Donovan&#x27;s contractual problems) and stereo versions of &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot; (previously unissued full length version) and &quot;Season of the Witch&quot;. It became the most successful album of his career; it reached 4 in the US, became a million-selling gold record and stayed on the Billboard album chart for more than a year. On 26 June 1969 the track &quot;Barabajagal (Love Is Hot)&quot; (recorded May 1969), which gained him a following on the rave scene decades later, was released, reaching 12 in the UK but charting less strongly in the US. This time he was backed by the original Jeff Beck Group, featuring Beck on lead guitar, Ronnie Wood on bass, Nicky Hopkins on piano and Micky Waller on drums. The Beck group was under contract to Most and it was Most&#x27;s idea to team them with Donovan to bring a heavier sound to Donovan&#x27;s work, while introducing a lyrical edge to Beck&#x27;s.

On 7 July 1969, Donovan performed at the first show in the second season of free rock concerts in Hyde Park, London, which also featured Blind Faith, Richie Havens, the Edgar Broughton Band and the Third Ear Band. In September 1969, the &quot;Barabajagal&quot; album reached 23 in the US. Only the recent &quot;Barabajagal&quot;/&quot;Trudi&quot; single and &quot;Superlungs My Supergirl&quot; were 1969 recordings, the remaining tracks were from sessions in London in May 1968 and in Los Angeles in November 1968. 

In the late 1960s to the early 1970s he lived at Stein, on the Isle of Skye, where he and a group of followers formed a commune and where he was visited by George Harrison. He named his daughter, born 1970, Ione Skye.

=== 1970s: Changes ===
In late 1969, the relationship with Most ended after an argument over an unidentified recording session in Los Angeles. In the 1995 BBC Radio 2 &quot;The Donovan Story&quot;, Most recounted:

==== Open Road band ====
Donovan said he wanted to record with someone else, and he and Most did not work together again until &quot;Cosmic Wheels&quot; (1973). After the rift, Donovan spent two months writing and recording the album &quot;Open Road&quot; as a member of the rock trio Open Road. Stripping the sound of Most&#x27;s heavy studio productions down to stuff that could be played by a live band, Donovan dubbed the sound &quot;Celtic Rock&quot;. The album peaked at No. 16 in the U.S., the third-highest of any of his full-length releases to date, but as his concert appearances became less frequent and new artists and styles of popular music began to emerge, his commercial success began to decline. Donovan said:

Donovan&#x27;s plan for &quot;Open Road&quot; was to tour the world for a year, beginning with a boat voyage around the Aegean Sea, documented in the 1970 film &quot;There is an Ocean&quot;. This was partially on the advice from his management to go into tax exile, during which he was not to set foot in the UK until April 1971, but after touring to France, Italy, Russia and Japan, he cut the tour short:

The band would continue without Donovan, adding new members, touring and releasing the album &quot;Windy Daze&quot; in 1971 before disbanding in 1972.

==== Reunions with Linda Lawrence and Mickie Most ====
After this reunion, Donovan and Linda married on 2 October 1970 at Windsor register office and honeymooned in the Caribbean. Donovan dropped out of the round of tour promotion and concentrated on writing, recording and his family. The largely self-produced children&#x27;s album &quot;HMS Donovan&quot; in 1971, went unreleased in the US and did not gain a wide audience. During an 18-month tax exile in Ireland (1971–72), he wrote for the 1972 film &quot;The Pied Piper&quot;, in the title role, and for &quot;Brother Sun, Sister Moon&quot; (1972). The title song from the Zeffirelli film provided Donovan with a publishing windfall in 1974 when it was covered as the B-side of the million-selling US top 5 hit &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot;, by Australia&#x27;s singing nun, Sister Janet Mead.

After a new deal with Epic, Donovan reunited with Mickie Most in early 1973, resulting in the LP &quot;Cosmic Wheels&quot;, which featured arrangements by Chris Spedding. It was his last chart success, reaching the top 40 in America and Britain. Late in the year, he released &quot;Essence To Essence&quot;, produced by Andrew Loog Oldham, and a live album recorded and released only in Japan, which featured an extended version of &quot;Hurdy Gurdy Man&quot;, including an additional verse written by George Harrison in Rishikesh. While recording the album, Alice Cooper invited Donovan to share lead vocals on his song &quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot;.

&quot;Cosmic Wheels&quot; was followed up by two albums that same year: his second concert album, &quot;Live in Japan: Spring Tour 1973&quot; and the more introspective &quot;Essence to Essence&quot;. His last two albums for Epic Records were &quot;7-Tease&quot; (1974) and &quot;Slow Down World&quot; (1976). In 1977, he opened for Yes on their six-month tour of North America and Europe following the release of &quot;Going for the One&quot; (1977). The 1978 LP, &quot;Donovan&quot; was on Most&#x27;s RAK Records in the UK and on Clive Davis&#x27; new Arista Records in the US; it reunited him for the last time with Most and Cameron, but was not well received at the height of the new wave and did not chart.

=== 1980s–1990s ===
The punk era (1976–1980) provoked a backlash in Britain against the optimism and whimsy of the hippie era, of which Donovan was a prime example. The word &quot;hippie&quot; became pejorative and Donovan&#x27;s fortunes suffered. In this period, he released the albums &quot;Neutronica&quot; (1980), &quot;Love Is Only Feeling&quot; (1981) and &quot;Lady of the Stars&quot; (1984), and guest-starred on &quot;Stars on Ice&quot;, a half-hour variety show on ice produced by CTV in Toronto. There was a respite when he appeared alongside Sting, Phil Collins, Bob Geldof, Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck in the Amnesty International benefit show &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball&quot;. Accompanied by Danny Thompson, Donovan performed several hits including &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot;, &quot;Mellow Yellow&quot;, &quot;Colours&quot;, &quot;Universal Soldier&quot; and &quot;Catch the Wind&quot;. He was also in the performance of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot; for the show&#x27;s finale. Donovan also appeared at the Glastonbury Festival on 18 June 1989 with the band Ozric Tentacles accompanying him onstage.

In 1990, Donovan released a live album featuring new performances of his classic songs. In 1991, Nettwerk released a tribute album to Donovan, &quot;Island of Circles&quot;. Sony&#x27;s 2-CD boxed set &quot;&quot; (1992) continued the restoration of his reputation and was followed by the 1994 release of &quot;Four Donovan Originals&quot;, which saw his four classic Epic LPs on CD in their original form for the first time in the UK. He found an ally in rap producer and Def Jam label owner Rick Rubin and recorded the album &quot;Sutras&quot; for Rubin&#x27;s American Recordings label.

===2000s===

In 2000, Donovan narrated and played himself in the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;The Deep South&quot; on 16 April with a parody of the song &quot;Atlantis&quot;.

A new album, &quot;Beat Cafe&quot;, on Appleseed Records in 2004, marked a return to the jazzy sound of his 1960s recordings and featured bassist Danny Thompson and drummer Jim Keltner, with production by John Chelew (The Blind Boys of Alabama). At a series of &quot;Beat Cafe&quot; performances in New York, Richard Barone (The Bongos) joined Donovan to sing and read passages from Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s &quot;Howl&quot;.

In May 2004, Donovan played &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot; at the wedding concert for the Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Denmark. He released his early demo tapes, &quot;Sixty Four&quot; and a re-recording of the &quot;Brother Sun, Sister Moon&quot; soundtrack on iTunes. A set of his Mickie Most albums was released on 9 May 2005. This EMI set has extra tracks including another song recorded with the Jeff Beck Group. In 2005, his autobiography &quot;The Hurdy Gurdy Man&quot; was published. In May/June 2005, Donovan toured the UK (Beat Cafe Tour) and Europe with Tom Mansi on double bass, former Damned drummer Rat Scabies and Flipron keyboard player, Joe Atkinson.

In 2006, Donovan played British festivals and two dates at Camden&#x27;s The Jazz Cafe, London.

In January 2007, Donovan played at the Kennedy Center, in Washington, DC; at Alice Tully Hall, in New York City; and at the Kodak Theatre, in Los Angeles, in conjunction with a presentation by filmmaker David Lynch supporting the David Lynch Foundation for Consciousness-Based Education and world peace. The concert at the Kodak Theatre was filmed by Raven Productions and broadcast on public television as a pledge drive. Donovan&#x27;s partnership with the David Lynch Foundation saw him performing concerts through October 2007, as well as giving presentations about Transcendental meditation. He appeared at Maharishi University of Management in Fairfield, Iowa, in May 2007, and toured the UK with Lynch in October 2007.

In March 2007, Donovan played two shows at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas. He had planned a spring 2007 release of an album, along with a UK tour, but announced the tour was cancelled and the album delayed. He said was in good health and gave no reason for the cancellation.

In April 2007, Donovan presented a three-part series on Ravi Shankar for BBC Radio 2. In October 2007, he announced plans for the &quot;Invincible Donovan University&quot; focusing on Transcendental Meditation, to be near Glasgow or Edinburgh. In October 2007 the DVD &quot;The Donovan Concert—Live in LA&quot;, filmed at the Kodak Theatre Los Angeles earlier that year, was released in the UK. On 6 October 2009, Donovan was honoured as a BMI Icon at the 2009 annual BMI London Awards. The Icon designation is given to BMI songwriters who have had &quot;a unique and indelible influence on generations of music makers&quot;.

=== 2010s–2020s ===
In October 2010, Donovan&#x27;s released the double album &quot;Ritual Groove&quot;, which he had described as &quot;a soundtrack to a movie not yet made.&quot; On 10 May 2021, his 75th birthday, Donovan released the music video for the album&#x27;s song &quot;I Am the Shaman&quot;. David Lynch produced the track and directed the video.

In 2012, he released &quot;The Sensual Donovan&quot;, recorded in 1971 with John Phillips of The Mamas and the Papas, backed by The Crusaders. In 2013, he recorded the album &quot;Shadows of Blue&quot; at Treasure Isle Studios in Nashville. The album includes songs he wrote in the 1970s and explores a country style.

A tribute album to Donovan, &quot;Gazing with Tranquility&quot;, was released in October 2015 under nonprofit label Rock the Cause Records to benefit the charity Huntington&#x27;s Hope. It features covers by The Flaming Lips, Lissie and Sharon Van Etten.

In 2019, Donovan released &quot;Eco-Song&quot;, an album of songs with an ecological theme, inspired by Greta Thunberg. He hoped to adapt the album into a rock opera but was unable to due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

To mark the 50th anniversary of Brian Jones&#x27;s death in 2019, Donovan released a tribute album, &quot;Joolz Juke&quot;, featuring Jones&#x27;s grandson (and Donovan&#x27;s step-grandson), Joolz Jones. In 2021, he released the album &quot;Lunarian&quot;, dedicated to his wife. The album&#x27;s song &quot;Still Waters&quot; was recorded decades earlier with Nils Lofgren. Donovan and Lawrence created an animated children&#x27;s television series, &quot;Tales of Aluna&quot;, with 26 episodes produced by Australian studio Three&#x27;s a Company. They had developed the series&#x27;s story over decades.

Donovan released the album &quot;Gaelia&quot; in December 2022. The album&#x27;s singles &quot;Rock Me&quot; and &quot;Lover O&#x27; Lover&quot; featured David Gilmour on guitar. Donovan took 2024 off to prepare for a sixtieth anniversary concert series planned for 2025.

Donovan had a relationship with American model Enid Karl and they had two children: actor-musician Donovan Leitch in 1967 and actress Ione Skye in 1970. In October of 1970, Donovan married Linda Lawrence. They have two children together, Astrella and Oriole; Oriole had a relationship with Shaun Ryder of the Happy Mondays and had a daughter, Coco, with whom Donovan has held joint art and photography exhibitions. Lawrence was the inspiration for &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot;.

Donovan is also the adoptive father of Lawrence&#x27;s and Brian Jones&#x27;s son, Julian Brian (Jones) Leitch.

In February 2024, Donovan was disqualified from driving for two years and fined €500 for dangerous driving by Skibbereen District Court in Ireland. A charge of being drunk in charge of a vehicle was dismissed, as the court determined it would be unsafe to convict him for that offence. The court heard that the singer was still working and that he supports charitable causes. He has lived in Ireland for thirty years, with no previous convictions.

Donovan, as of February 2024, lives in Castlemagner, Kanturk in County Cork. He suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a &quot;restricted lung disease&quot;.

===Religious beliefs===
Donovan identifies as pagan. Raised Protestant, he left the religion after reading Lao Tzu, Zen and Celtic mythology as a teenager. His personal belief system combines Celtic mythology, Buddhism and goddess worship. During a 2022 interview with &quot;Variety&quot;, he said &quot;[E]very other song of mine celebrates the Goddess. She is Mother Nature. And we have been placed in this extraordinary position, almost on the edge of extinction, by this totally, overly male view that every resource, every river, every breeze, every cloud, every metal in the land should be raped and pillaged and sold as a commodity.&quot;

== Accolades ==
In November 2003, the University of Hertfordshire awarded Donovan an honorary Doctor of Letters degree. He was nominated by Sara Loveridge (a student at the university who had interviewed and reviewed Donovan for the university paper in 2001–2002); Andrew Morris, Sara&#x27;s partner and Donovan researcher/writer; and Mac MacLeod.

On 14 April 2012, Donovan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

<text>Ackley is a city in the Franklin and Hardin counties in the U.S. state of Iowa. The population was 1,599 at the 2020 census.

==History==

In 1852, immigrants began purchasing farms and settling in the north Hardin County area. In the fall of 1852, Lemuel Harvy &quot;Seth&quot; Arledge, a frontiersman who acted as both a physician and preacher originally from Kentucky staked a claim just north of the Hardin County line and built a cabin close to where Highway 57 now passes. Another settler, Thomas Downs, became the first permanent resident of Ackley when he bought Dr. Arledge&#x27;s claim. Later his widow sold a strip of land from Butler Street to the four county corner for $3.00 an acre to Minor Gallop. Gallop built a house, just east of Highway 57 which became an inn, a stopover for stagecoaches, and the first post office.

Many caravans arrived in anticipation of settling in this area. Roby Parriott and wife, Abigail, settled in Washington Township, Butler County. Parriott immediately began to acquire more land and purchased what is now the business section of Ackley.

Mills were built on the Iowa River south of the community and in 1856 a stage line was built from Cedar Falls to Fort Dodge. The Dubuque and Pacific Railroad Company received a charter from the State of Iowa in the 1850s to build a railroad. Surveying teams were sent out. One of the members was J. William Ackley. He decided Etna Township was a good place for a railroad station. The land was owned by Parriott and his wife, who had purchased it for speculation.

William Ackley purchased the land for the railroad route and discussed founding a town. He and three other land developers purchased the land which is now the town itself for $25.00 an acre. They then sold sites for developing the town. In 1857, the town of Ackley was staked out. The plan was signed December 12, 1857. Even though Ackley never lived here, he gave the town his name.

In 1865, the Dubuque and Sioux City Railroad bought nearly all the timber at Island Grove and corded it up where the Illinois Central depot stands. By October, when the railroad reached Ackley, there were 10 business establishments and several homes. The completion of the railroad brought on a rush of settlers and businessmen and the town boomed.

The Fontaine post office was moved to Ackley and its name was changed. The town of Ackley was incorporated and William A. Francis became the first mayor. The Ackley Civic Center now stands at the site of a store once owned by Francis.
As Ackley expanded more buildings were being constructed in the business area. A brick, six-room school was built at State and Second Street for $14,000. Catholics, Methodists and Presbyterians built frame churches. The population soared to 500.

The town was incorporated on August 28, 1869. By 1870, the town had a brick schoolhouse, five churches, a mayor and council, a newspaper, and many stores. In the next thirty years the town replaced the frame buildings on Main Street with brick structures, built a waterworks, established a light plant, and built hotels. The population at that time was approximately 2,000.

In the 1870s, Ackley acquired businesses such as a hardware store, furniture store, harness shop, boots and shoe store, general merchandise, jewelry and a brewery. The Ackley Independent Newspaper as well as lawyers, a doctor and fraternal organizations became part of the town.

The Hook and Ladder fire department was organized in the 1880s. The Goettels and the C.H. Doepke buildings appeared on the landscape in the 1880s. A four-year high school opened with an enrollment of 40 students. The Iowa state constitution was amended in 1882, making the production and sale of alcoholic beverages illegal within the state (i.e. Iowa became a “dry state.”) The Supreme Court declared the amendment unconstitutional in 1883, but the Iowa legislature then passed another very strict prohibition law. Due to this, the Ackley brewery closed.

In 1885, the local school district went before the Supreme Court in &quot;Ackley School Dist. v. Hall&quot; over a bond dispute.

The streets were lit with oil lamps by the late 19th century. Seven students graduated from the high school in the 1890s. Plans for the Ackley Hotel were developed in the last decade of the 19th century. The project was financed by selling shares for $25 to $1000 a share. The hotel was built on the corner of State and Railroad Street (Park). During the 1890s, water mains and sewer drains were laid. Electric lights and telephone service also appeared in Ackley.

The first rural mail route was established in 1900. The first Sauerkraut Days celebration was held September 17, 1903. A high school building was erected on the northeast corner of the playground. The wooden water tower was replaced with a steel tower at Main and Cerro Gordo Streets.

There was much excitement over the coming of the automobile. A local mechanic constructed a horseless carriage in 1905 which ran to Spencer and back but was not further promoted. Ackley did pave its main streets by 1915 and many auto dealers started business.

Marshall Canning Plant and husking shed was built in 1918 and canning began in 1919. The &quot;Glacier Trail&quot; (the road now designated as &quot;County S-56&quot;) was marked through Ackley in 1922. More streets were paved.
In 1927, a new school was built to house 12 grades. Ackley participated in athletic sports, music and academic activities with surrounding schools. A food processing company was established.

The 1930s brought the Great Depression and 3 banks in Ackley closed. The Municipal Building was erected in 1939. The mayor and town council, fire department, police station, library and a large meeting room were housed in the building.

School buses started running in 1946. City mail delivery was inaugurated in 1947. In 1948, the Ackley Golf Club was designed and the club house was built. In 1954, twenty-two rural school districts joined with Ackley to form the Ackley Community School. Ackley celebrated its Centennial in 1957.
Ackley has drawn positive publicity to the community through the frequent stops by RAGBRAI and a new Country Club.

==Geography==

Quarantine orders were established for households with smallpox, and guards were posted outside affected homes. On June 11, J.C. Wilson was employed as quarantine officer. During this time, Shenandoah musician W.F. Strong composed a piano arrangement called &quot;Quarantine Polka&quot;.

<text>Tabor is a city in Fremont County and extends northward into Mills County in the U.S. state of Iowa. The population was 1,014 at the time of the 2020 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

== History ==

In 1852 the city of Tabor was founded by &quot;a few families from Oberlin, Ohio, almost all of them Congregationalists,&quot; &quot;generous people, early settlers from New England and Ohio who had brought with them Puritan ideas of religion, and Sumner&#x27;s and Phillips&#x27; and Garrison&#x27;s ideas of freedom.&quot; Among them were the Christian clergymen George Gaston, Samuel A. Adams, and Rev. John Todd, and their families. They chose to settle in what is now Tabor in order to found a Christian college, which eventually became Tabor College. The founders were impressed with this high location and mutually selected the name &quot;Tabor&quot; after the Biblical name of Mount Tabor, a mountain near Nazareth, the town of Jesus&#x27; childhood.

The town was the home of many abolitionists; Rev. Todd, co-founder of Tabor College, was a &quot;conductor&quot; on the Underground Railroad. The residents of Tabor held monthly abolitionist prayer meetings, and helped runaway slaves whenever they could.

During the Bleeding Kansas period (1854–1860), Tabor was on a route established to enable anti-slavery partisans to reach Kansas without needing to go through the slave state of Missouri. A shipment of 200 Sharps rifles, sent from Boston for use in Kansas by free-state partisans, were stored there (in John Todd&#x27;s barn). In 1857–1858 abolitionist John Brown spent the winter in Tabor, assembling and training men for his raid on Harpers Ferry.

Tabor College was located in the city from 1853 until 1927, when it closed for financial reasons. The college&#x27;s buildings housed German prisoners of war during World War II.

The Tabor &amp; Northern Railway, a 9-mile line connecting with the Wabash Railroad at Malvern, operated from 1889 to 1934. It was operated by the college.

<text>Forest City is a city in Hancock and Winnebago counties in the U.S. state of Iowa, and the county seat of Winnebago County. The population was 4,285 in the 2020 census, a decline from the 4,362 population in 2000.

==History==
Forest City was officially founded in 1855. Formerly known as “Puckerbrush”, Robert Clark the official founder/surveyor deemed it “Forest City” because it was cut right out of the trees. It was then platted in 1856, and later incorporated on June 14, 1878. The population started to grow when immigrants from Sweden and Norway settled in the Forest City area because of the similar topography. Its growth continued as city leaders convinced the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railroad to come through Forest City. Although the Civil War stunted the area&#x27;s growth, many immigrants found the city attractive. Later on churches, banks, a college (Waldorf University), electricity, and the telephone turned Forest City into an ideal country town. In 1960, investors took over a failing travel trailer factory and created Winnebago Industries, creating what would become one of the largest employers in the region and causing the population to grow. Winnebago&#x27;s corporate headquarters were later relocated to Eden Prairie, Minnesota causing the population to decline. Today, Forest City&#x27;s population is around 4,200.

<text>Coppock is a city in Henry, Jefferson, and Washington counties in the U.S. state of Iowa. The population was 36 at the 2020 census.

The Washington County portion of Coppock is part of the Iowa City, Iowa Metropolitan Statistical Area. There is only one business open to the public, a tavern/boat landing.

==History==
John Coppock and Thomas Tucker built a grist mill and saw mill on the Skunk River in 1859. The grist mill was on the north bank of the river about 1/8 mile (1/4 km) east of what is now Locust St. John&#x27;s son Thomas Coppock built a general store nearby, and the Coppock businesses became a social center for the surrounding area. By 1877, when John Coppock died, the grist mill was a four-story building, and the operation included 360 acres of land, 4 houses and a ferry.

Coppock&#x27;s mill was the site of a battle in 1882 between the Iowa Central Railway and the narrow-gauge Burlington and Western Railway for locations of bridges across the Skunk River. The Burlington and Western was later widened and taken over by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy and the Iowa Central was taken over by the Minneapolis and St. Louis.

With the coming of the railroads there was major development around the mill. The town of Coppock was platted in 1882, with 4 city blocks. The two railroads paralleled each other in a broad curve south of the town, each with its own depot, passing siding, stock yard and, water tank. The Burlington and Western also had a coaling station. John Coppock Jr. bought the mill and dam in 1883, and by 1887, the mill was a 40 by 50 foot, six-story building. Ice harvesting became an important winter business in this era, the Burlington and Western built a siding for loading ice. The Burlington and Western also advertised the availability of gravel and unlimited quantities of crushed-stone from Coppock.

By the end of the century, Trite&#x27;s Park and Brown&#x27;s Park competed for the tourist business, offering swimming, boating, picnic grounds and facilities for group activities. There was even a small steamboat available for charter trips on the river and a &quot;tobbogan slide&quot; into the water, all within walking distance of the railroad stations. Excursions were coordinated with the Burlington and Western Railway, which allowed a passenger car to be chartered from Burlington, set out on a siding at Coppock for the day, and then picked up by the evening train for the return trip to Burlington. These parks were destroyed by a major flood in 1903.

Coppock was incorporated as a city on Feb. 24, 1902. By that time, the town had a hotel, multiple general stores and a blacksmith shop in addition to the mill. The population peaked at over 100 between 1910 and 1920, but declined to 93 by 1930. The former Coppock mill was moved to Wayland in 1917. At that time, the two railroads still had The Burlington Route stopped service through Coppock in 1934 and pulled up the tracks a year later. In 1935, the road from Wayland to Coppock was graveled, making it passable year round. The Minneapolis and St. Louis continued to operate through 1971.

==Geography==
Coppock is located on the Skunk River just above its confluence with Crooked Creek.

<text>Victor is a town in Poweshiek and Iowa counties in the U.S. state of Iowa. The population was 875 in the 2020 census, a decline from the population of 952 in 2000.

==History==
Prior to its opening for European settlement, the area around what is now Victor was home to the Sac and Fox Indians.

The Dragoon Trail trail follows the path of the 1st U. S. Dragoons, the country&#x27;s first mounted infantry unit, on their historic march in the summer of 1835. The purpose of the march was to scout Iowa after the Black Hawk Purchase of 1832. This trail generally followed the Bear Creek Valley in western Iowa County and passed about a mile south of what would later become Victor. 

In 1856 and 1857, Mormon Handcart Pioneers followed the Dragoon Trail south of Victor on their way from the end of the rail line in Iowa City to the Salt Lake Valley in Utah. The route was later referred to locally as the &quot;State Road&quot; and today is officially designated by the county as &quot;A Diagonal&quot;. Later, until about 1863, Mormon pioneers passed through Victor in covered wagons. 

In April 1854, George W. Wilson, a native of Ohio, purchased from the federal government the land on which Victor now occupies.

In October 1861, Wilson permanently moved from Ohio to Iowa and soon began negotiations with Thomas C. Durant of New York City, a railroad officer. The resulting agreement involved granting a right of way through Wilson&#x27;s land, providing space for a switch yard and station, and building a depot.

Construction of the depot started on November 15, 1861, and was completed by December 24. Materials were sourced partly from Wilson&#x27;s timber land near Victor, with additional supplies purchased from Davenport and Iowa City. Samuel Howard, the foreman, led the construction with assistance from several workers who prepared and transported the timbers.

The depot was the first building in what would become the town of Victor, laying the foundation for its growth.

May 5, 1863, Joseph A. Blackburn - a brother-in-law of George Wilson - completed the legal steps necessary for the original town of &quot;Wilson&quot;, named in honor of the man who entered the land. Another addition was made June 19, 1866, and still another December 20, 1867.

In 1869, following Iowa&#x27;s general law, the town was incorporated. Under the direction of Wilson and the town was divided into lots by surveyor Charles Stotwell. The town had been originally surveyed just eight years prior to its incorporation.

In July 1854 the first post office in the region was established south of Victor on the State Road and given the name &quot;Victor&quot; after a village in New York. In 1865, the post office was relocated to where the town had been established and the town&#x27;s name was changed from Wilson to Victor. 

A man named McEckley was the first to build a house, store and mill at what is now the site of Victor. The early settlers, primarily of Irish and German descent, came from Ohio, Indiana, and Maryland. Later, Belgian and Czech immigrants arrived. 

===Railroad===
The first railroad to reach Victor was the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad (M&amp;M Railroad) which arrived in 1862. Chartered in 1853, the M&amp;M was Iowa&#x27;s first railroad. It was created to connect Davenport on the Mississippi River to Council Bluffs on the Missouri River. It was the first railroad west of the Mississippi to be connected by a bridge to the East and it played a significant role in the development of the first transcontinental railroad.

The Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad, under lease to the Chicago &amp; North Western, however, was the first to actually reach Council Bluffs. Thomas C. Durant, vice president of the Union Pacific Railroad, held stock in both railroads and was accused of corruption in manipulating the railroads&#x27; stock prices and operating as a petty tyrant. 

The Rock Island Line bought the M&amp;M on July 9, 1866.

<text>Eddyville is a city in Mahaska, Monroe, and Wapello counties in the U.S. state of Iowa. The population was 970 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
&quot;Circa&quot; 1839, a Sauk village was established on this site following the end of the Black Hawk War. The village was referred to by the name of its chief, Chief Hard Fish, or Wish-e-co-ma-que. In 1840 or 1841, before Iowa became a state, Jabish P. Eddy was permitted to open a trading post in Hard Fish&#x27;s village. It was a place for trade with the Indians and for pioneers to provision and ford the Des Moines River. In 1842, the area was obtained as part of the New Purchase and the Sauk moved up river. J.P. Eddy became the Indian agent for the area and set aside some of his land for the eponymously named town. In 1843, the area was opened for white settlement. The town was formally incorporated in 1857.

The first commercial coal mines in Wapello County were opened near Eddyville. Local oral history has it that a two-story house that once stood at the northwest corner of Seventh and Vance Streets served as a stop on the Underground Railroad until the Civil War made that unnecessary. Several &#x27;coal banks&#x27; were in operation in 1857, including the Roberts Mine, directly across the Des Moines River from town. These mines worked coal seams exposed on the hillsides of the river valley.

Eddyville was served by the Keokuk and Des Moines Railroad, which later became part of the Rock Island Railroad between Ottumwa and Oskaloosa generally on what is known as Sixth Street, and by a spur of the Milwaukee Railroad from Albia, with a trestle bridge across the river to connect to the Rock Island on the north side of Eddyville. The Rock Island depot with a warehouse was between Walnut and Mill Streets, on the west side of the line. The line was closed and abandoned in the 1970s, but the old Milwaukee line has been rebuilt and expanded to serve Cargill and related operations from Albia where it joins the Burlington Northern Santa Fe.

A three-story brick school with a bell tower was located for many years on the block bounded by Seventh and Eighth Streets and Vance and Berdan Streets. This building housed all education for the community, through 12th grade. The property was enlarged with a ball field on the south across Berdan, and a playground on the west. The third story and bell tower were removed early in the twentieth century and the materials used to build a companion high school building, with the remaining portion of the original building used as an elementary school, including the heating plant. An auditorium and gymnasium with a stage was built about the time of World War II. In the late 1950s, the state encouraged school consolidation of the one-room schools in the surrounding countryside, including Chillicothe and Kirkville, and the school district borrowed to build a new junior-senior high school building approximately one mile east, on the south side of the county line road, which opened for classes in the late summer of 1961; the old buildings were then devoted to elementary classes.

Subsequently, Eddyville merged with the Hedrick and Fremont schools and, most recently, Blakesburg.

There was a city-owned electric system with a generator next to the railroad on Sixth Street at Mill Street. Some time around World War I, the city sold the system to a private company.

Following World War II, the city built a public water system with a well on the south side of town and stand pipe water tower on Cemetery Hill. The system produced water pressure of 85-90 pounds per square inch in most of the community.

The volunteer fire department for much of the early and mid-20th century used a truck with three tanks and a front-mounted pump (sometimes called the chemical truck), and a General-St. Louis truck that was acquired from Mason City. Both had open cockpits and could be hand cranked to start the engine. In the late 1950s, the school bus barn burned and the department saved two International Metro buses. Some of the fire department members restored one Metro for the District and the District gave the other one to the department, which used it for rescue for many years thereafter.

About that time, L.W. Klein, owner of the furniture store and funeral home, decided to stop running ambulance calls and donated some of his equipment to the fire department for the rescue truck. The department worked hard with training, fund raising and obtaining equipment, such that when the state became interested in improving ambulance services, they looked at Eddyville&#x27;s well-developed program as a model.

Iowa law allowed townships to levy a tax for fire protection, and Columbia and East Des Moines Townships contracted with the city to provide this service. Individual property owners from other townships could contract for fire protection. &quot;Circa&quot; 1960, the townships bought a fire truck on an International chassis with a front mount pump, and the chemical tank truck was retired but the pump was salvaged. In the early 1970s the two townships purchased a truck, had a tank built and a pump (from the old chemical truck) installed for use as a tanker truck and the city and the townships built a building to house the tanker as well as certain city operations and equipment. &quot;Circa&quot; 1974, the City purchased a new fire truck on a Ford chassis. A new fire station has since been built on Walnut Street at 6th Street, and there is more room for newer equipment.

For many years, the library, jail and upstairs meeting room and city hall, with adjacent fire station, were located at the corner of Walnut and First (or Front) Streets. In the early 1960s, with funding from an inheritance, this was extensively remodeled and modernized.

In the mid-1960s, the city, with a grant and a low-interest loan from the Farmers Home Administration, constructed a sanitary sewer system, with lagoon treatment. The monthly fee was $4.60 for residences and $5.00 for businesses.

The Des Moines River has been a fact of life for the community throughout its history, with major flooding in 1947, 1965 and more recently. The Army Corps of Engineers built a series of levees after the floods of 1947, and has raised them since.

The road to Albia originally crossed the river on a one-lane steel superstructure bridge from the west end of Walnut Street. After World War II, demand for electricity increased, and construction of an electric generating plant by Iowa Southern Utilities was begun across the river and south, known as Bridgeport Station. About the same time, a new concrete bridge was built and the old steel bridge removed, leaving a small park area across from city hall. The Eddyville side of the approach to the new bridge was built on extensive fill which also served as part of the levee system that had been built by the Corps of Engineers.

Demand for electricity continued to grow, Iowa Southern had built bigger, newer plants at Chillicothe and Burlington, and the Bridgeport station was obsolete. Cargill had a new process that worked in the laboratory, but they needed a cheap source of large amounts of steam to see if it worked in practice, so they purchased the Bridgeport Station for this purpose, and the Cargill plant was constructed, and continues to grow.

Telephone service was provided from an office on the second floor of a building on the south side of Walnut Street at the alley between Second and Third Streets, with a switchboard and cranked phones, most of which were on party lines. In the early 1960s, United Telephone modernized this with a new dial system. As a result of a petition drive, citizens agreed to pay 25 cents a month extra to call Ottumwa, Oskaloosa and Albia without long-distance tolls.

==Geography==

Eddyville is located on the east bank of a bend in the Des Moines River, approximately 70 miles south-southeast of Des Moines and 15 miles north-northwest of Ottumwa.

<text>Walcott ( , [ˈwɔlkət]) is a city in Muscatine and Scott counties in the U.S. state of Iowa. The population was 1,551 at the time of the 2020 census. Walcott&#x27;s interchange on Interstate 80 is home to an enormous complex of restaurants, motels and truck stops, including the Iowa 80 truck stop, which is the world&#x27;s largest.

Most of Walcott is part of the Davenport–Moline–Rock Island, IA-IL Metropolitan Statistical Area, but the Muscatine County portion of the city is considered part of the Muscatine Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Walcott was incorporated on July 10, 1894.

The City of Walcott was originally platted in 1854. The first passenger train route west of the Mississippi River began service in 1855 and helped Walcott grow. William Walcott, who was a director of Chicago and Rock Island Railroad, donated $500 in 1855 for the construction of a school building, with the stipulation that the fledgling town along the railroad tracks near Davenport be named after him.

Long before Walcott was even a vision to William Walcott, it was a great expanse of open prairie inhabited by the Kaskaskia people. The Kaskaskias were later driven out of the Quad Cities area by the renegade Meskwaki tribe. This tribe, a splinter of the Canadian Iroquois, was America&#x27;s largest Indian nation.

In 1857, much of the Walcott land was sold for as low as 75 cents an acre, enabling many German and Scotch-Irish immigrants to settle in the area. Many of the Scotch-Irish worked for the railroad builders and settled on the farmland south and west of the town. While they contributed much to the early development of Walcott, circa 1871 they began to move farther west. Most of the German settlers were from Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany, and some came from eastern and southern Germany. By 1910, nearly 90 percent of the farmland in Scott County was owned by German immigrants or their descendants.

A petition for incorporation was signed and presented to Judge C.M. Waterman of the District Court at Davenport on June 5, 1894. At that time, the total population was 354. The election was held on July 7, 1894, and of the 81 votes cast, 54 were in favor of the incorporation. The result of the election was approved and filed by the District Court on July 14, 1894.

Long before most small towns thought of supplying their citizens with water, Walcott had plans for an efficient and adequate water system. Walcott was the first rural Scott County community to build a water system and water tower. The installation was completed in 1897, and provided the citizens of Walcott with inexpensive water service, good drinking water, and improved fire protection. In 1914, the first sewage disposal system was built. Lagoons for the sanitation system were installed in the late 1960s and three cells were added to the lagoon system in 1975.

As early as 1897, the people of Walcott banded together to provide an organized way of fighting the terror and destructiveness of fire. In those early days, the department consisted of a small number of volunteer firemen and two hand-pulled hose carts. In 1931, the town built a fire station and city hall. Today, that same building houses the Fire Department and City Hall.

The Walcott Savings Bank was organized in 1894 with a capital stock of $30,000. On April 1, 1904, the Farmers Savings Bank began business with at capital stock of $25,000. In 1911, Walcott was declared the richest town in the US in consideration of the bank deposits for its population of 300, according to Dunn &amp; Co. in the Bankers&#x27; Journal of New York. During the depression year of 1931, the two banks were consolidated and Walcott Trust and Savings Bank was formed.

The original town was expanded in 1962 to include Highway 6. Additional ground was annexed in 1973 to include the Interstate 80 interchange area and the French and Hecht Building, which currently houses FirstCo Inc. In the early 1990s, quadrants adjacent to and near the Interstate 80 interchanged were also annexed in. The annexation of the area near Interstate 80 has increased the area&#x27;s valuation significantly. Many businesses, including the world&#x27;s largest truck stop, Iowa 80 Truck Stop, are located within the city limits.

In 1997, Walcott joined in a sister city partnership with Bredenbek, Germany.

<doc id="150418" wikidata="Q1590850" url="?curid=150418" title="Sheldon, Iowa">
<text>Sheldon is a city in O&#x27;Brien and Sioux counties in the U.S. state of Iowa, along the Floyd River. The population was 5,512 at the time of the 2020 census; it is the largest city in O&#x27;Brien County.

==History and culture==

Sheldon got its start in the year 1873, following construction of the Sioux City &amp; St. Paul Railroad through that territory. It was named for Israel Sheldon, a railroad promoter. It was a strategic location on the rail for businesses from as far away as Minneapolis and Omaha, after the addition of the intersection with the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway in 1878.

The growth in infrastructure has continued. Today, the city lies at the crossroads of Iowa Highway 60 and U.S. Route 18. Eastbound and westbound rail service is provided by IC&amp;E Railroad (since 2008 a subsidiary of Canadian Pacific Railway), while northbound and southbound service is provided by Union Pacific Railroad.

The city&#x27;s first financial institution, the Sheldon State Bank, closed in 1903. In 1961, the city made headlines when it was revealed that Burnice Geiger had embezzled more than two million dollars from the Sheldon National Bank, operated by her father. She was sentenced to fifteen years in prison in the same year, but paroled in 1966.

Today, the city is most known for its annual display of marigolds and the moniker of its local schools&#x27; athletic teams—the Orabs. The name stands for the school colors orange and black. Sheldon High School also hosts the Sheldon High School Summer Theatre program. Sheldon is the home of Northwest Iowa Community College and the Carnegie Library, which was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

==In popular culture==
Sheldon was mentioned on page 13 of the Tim O&#x27;Brien book &quot;If I Die in a Combat Zone, Box Me Up and Ship Me Home&quot;: &quot;Together we watched trombones and crepe-paper floats move down mainstreet. The bands and floats represented Sheldon, Tyler, Sibley, Jackson, and a dozen other neighboring towns&quot;.

Ken Snyder (born 1949), pastor of the Parkview Assembly of God in Sheldon, self-released a record album entitled &quot;Ken: By Request Only&quot; in 1976. The record jacket—featuring Snyder in now-outdated hair and clothes—has made the LP popular on websites that highlight unusual-looking album covers. (Snyder retired as pastor in 2018 and was elected to the Sheldon city council in 2021.)

==Geography==
Sheldon is located at (43.181180, −95.848123).

<text>Michael Hampton (born November 15, 1956) is an American funk/rock guitarist. He is a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, inducted in 1997 with fifteen other members of Parliament-Funkadelic.

== Career ==
Hampton was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and started his professional career when he was recruited as a seventeen-year-old guitar prodigy by the band Funkadelic, which found itself in need of a lead guitarist after original guitarist Eddie Hazel left the band. Hampton impressed Funkadelic&#x27;s George Clinton by performing a note-for-note rendition of Hazel&#x27;s ten-minute solo &quot;Maggot Brain&quot;. Hampton made his debut with the band&#x27;s album &quot;Let&#x27;s Take It to the Stage&quot; in 1975, which is dominated by his guitar. Hampton&#x27;s playing included fuzzy, Hendrix-inspired licks and wailing harmonics. Due to his young age, Hampton was nicknamed &quot;Kidd Funkadelic&quot;.

Hampton became a fixture in Funkadelic, and he continued his role as lead guitarist even during Hazel&#x27;s sporadic returns to the band. Hampton&#x27;s performances of &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; — which had become more improvised – became regular features of live Parliament-Funkadelic shows, and the song became his signature concert performance. The bonus-EP of Funkadelic&#x27;s &quot;One Nation Under a Groove&quot; (1978) included a live version of the song featuring Hampton. One of his most celebrated performances is the lead guitar solo on the Funkadelic hit single &quot;(Not Just) Knee Deep&quot; from 1979, as well the title track to the Brides of Funkenstein&#x27;s second album &quot;Never Buy Texas From A Cowboy&quot;.

In 1981, Clinton was forced to disband the P-Funk musical empire due to financial and legal difficulties. In 1993, Hampton performed on the album &quot;Under the 6&quot; with Slave Master. Hampton continued to perform on albums released under Clinton&#x27;s name, which featured many other P-Funk mainstays as well, and he became a member of the P-Funk All-Stars. In 1998, he released his first solo album entitled &quot;Heavy Metal Funkason&quot; through the P-Vine label in Japan.

In 2022, Hampton joined Chuck Treece to form the funk/punk fusion group Punkadelic. With Hampton on guitar and Treece on bass and drums, Punkadelic performed both original music and Funkadelic covers in Philadelphia, Mexico, and live on the radio at WOCM Ocean 98 in Ocean City, Maryland. Punkadelic released two singles and an original EP titled &quot;Collective Consciousness&quot; in 2023.

<doc id="150421" wikidata="Q253776" url="?curid=150421" title="Phalarope">
<text>A phalarope is any of three living species of slender-necked shorebirds in the genus Phalaropus of the bird family Scolopacidae.

Phalaropes are close relatives of the shanks and tattlers, the &quot;Actitis&quot; and Terek sandpipers, and also of the turnstones and calidrids. They are especially notable for their unusual nesting behavior and their unique feeding technique.

Two species, the red or grey phalarope (&quot;P. fulicarius&quot;) and the red-necked phalarope (&quot;P. lobatus&quot;) breed around the Arctic Circle and winter on tropical oceans. Wilson&#x27;s phalarope (&quot;P. tricolor&quot;) breeds in western North America and migrates to South America. All are in length, with lobed toes and a straight, slender bill. Predominantly grey and white in winter, their plumage develops reddish markings in summer.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Phalaropus&quot; was introduced by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 with the red phalarope (&quot;Phalaropus fulicarius&quot;) as the type species. The English and genus names come through French &quot;phalarope&quot; and scientific Latin &quot;Phalaropus&quot; from Ancient Greek &quot;phalaris&quot;, &quot;coot&quot;, and &quot;pous&quot;, &quot;foot&quot;. Coots and phalaropes both have lobed toes.

The genus contains three species:




A fossil species, &quot;P. elenorae&quot;, is known from the Middle Pliocene 4–3 million years ago (Mya). A coracoid fragment from the Late Oligocene (23 Mya) near Créchy, France, was also ascribed to a primitive phalarope; it might belong to an early species of the present genus or a prehistoric relative. The divergence of phalaropes from their closest relatives can be dated to around that time, as evidenced by the fossil record (chiefly of the shanks) and supported by tentative DNA sequence data. Of note, the last remains of the Turgai Sea disappeared around then, and given the distribution of their fossil species, this process probably played a major role in separating the lineages of the shank-phalarope clade.

==Ecology and behavior==
Red and red-necked phalaropes are unusual amongst shorebirds in that they are considered pelagic, that is, they spend a great deal of their lives outside the breeding season well out to sea. Phalaropes are unusually halophilic (salt-loving) and feed in great numbers in saline lakes such as Mono Lake in California and the Great Salt Lake of Utah.

===Feeding===
When feeding, a phalarope often swims in a small, rapid circle, forming a small whirlpool. This behavior is thought to aid feeding by raising food from the bottom of shallow water. The bird then reaches into the center of the vortex with its bill, plucking small insects or crustaceans caught up therein. Phalaropes use the surface tension of water to capture food particles and get them to move up along their bills and into their mouths in what has been termed as a capillary ratchet.

===Sexual dimorphism and reproduction===
In the three phalarope species, sexual dimorphism and contributions to parenting are reversed from what is normally seen in birds. Females are larger and more brightly colored than males. The females pursue and fight over males, then defend them from other females until the male begins incubation of the clutch. Males perform all incubation and chick care, while the female attempts to find another male to mate with. If a male loses his eggs to predation, he often rejoins his original mate or a new female, which then lays another clutch. When the season is too late to start new nests, females begin their southward migration, leaving the males to incubate the eggs and care for the young. Phalaropes are uncommon among birds and vertebrates in general in that they engage in polyandry, with one female taking multiple male mates, while males mate with only one female. Specifically, phalaropes engage in serial polyandry, wherein females pair with multiple males at different times in the breeding season.

<text>Calvin Eugene Simon (May 22, 1942 – January 6, 2022) was an American singer who was a member of the bands Parliament and Funkadelic. He is a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, inducted in 1997 along with fifteen other members of Parliament-Funkadelic.

==Early life==
Simon was born in Beckley, West Virginia on May 22, 1942. Simon was drafted into the United States Army in 1966, and served with C Battery, 3rd Battalion, 13th Field Artillery Regiment, 9th Infantry Division during the Vietnam War in 1967–68.

==Career==
Simon started out in the late 1950s as one of The Parliaments, a doo wop barbershop quintet led by George Clinton. In 1978, Simon (along with other original Parliaments Fuzzy Haskins and Grady Thomas), left Parliament-Funkadelic after financial and management disputes with Clinton. In 1981, the trio caused confusion when they formed a new band, and released an album called &quot;Connections &amp; Disconnections&quot; under the name Funkadelic. In 1998, Simon, along with original Parliaments bass vocalist Ray Davis, Haskins, and Grady Thomas, founded Original P, performing until his departure in 2007.

After a hiatus from the music industry, Simon turned to gospel music and recorded for his own label, Simon Says Records. In June 2004 he released an album called &quot;Share the News&quot;, which reached #32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Gospel Albums chart. In 2019, he and Parliament-Funkadelic were given Grammy Lifetime Achievement Awards.

==Death==
Simon died on January 6, 2022, at the age of 79.

<doc id="150423" wikidata="Q858340" url="?curid=150423" title="Bifocals">
<text>Bifocals are eyeglasses with two distinct optical powers correcting vision at both long and short distances. Bifocals are commonly prescribed to people with presbyopia who also require a correction for myopia, hyperopia, and/or astigmatism.

==History==
Benjamin Franklin is generally credited with the invention of bifocals. He decided to saw his lenses in half so he could read the lips of speakers of French at court, the only way he could understand them. Historians have produced some evidence to suggest that others may have come before him in the invention; however, a correspondence between George Whatley and John Fenno, editor of the &quot;Gazette of the United States&quot;, suggested that Franklin had indeed invented bifocals, and perhaps 50 years earlier than had been originally thought. On the contrary, the College of Optometrists concluded:
:Unless further evidence emerges all we can say for certain is that Franklin was one of the first people to wear split bifocals and this act of wearing them caused his name to be associated with the type from an early date. This no doubt contributed greatly to their popularisation. The evidence implies, however, that when he sought to order lenses of this type the London opticians were already familiar with them. Other members of Franklin&#x27;s circle of British friends may have worn them even earlier, from the 1760s, but it is at best uncertain (and arguably improbable?) that split bifocal lenses had a famous gentleman inventor. Since many inventions are developed independently by more than one person, it is possible that the invention of bifocals may have been such a case.

John Isaac Hawkins, the inventor of trifocal lenses, coined the term &quot;bifocals&quot; in 1824 and credited Benjamin Franklin.

In 1955, Irving Rips of Younger Optics created the first seamless or &quot;invisible&quot; bifocal, a precursor to progressive lenses. This followed Howard D. Beach&#x27;s 1946 work in &quot;blended lenses&quot;, O&#x27;Conner&#x27;s &quot;Ultex&quot; lens in 1910, and Isaac Schnaitmann&#x27;s single-piece bifocal lens in 1837.

== Construction ==
Original bifocals were designed with the most convex lenses (for close viewing) in the lower half of the frame and the least convex lenses on the upper. Up until the beginning of the 20th century two separate lenses were cut in half and combined in the rim of the frame. The mounting of two half-lenses into a single frame led to a number of early complications and rendered such spectacles quite fragile. A method for fusing the sections of the lenses together was developed by Louis de Wecker at the end of the 19th century and patented by John Louis Borsch Jr. (1873–1929) in 1908. In 1915, Henri (Henry) A. Courmettes (1884-1969), a French immigrant to the US, patented the “Flat Top” (or “D Segment”) reading portion of the bifocal. The advantages were wide reading area, less prismatic effects and no image jump between distance and close viewing. This was first introduced in mass production by the Univis Lens Co. of Dayton, OH. in 1926. In 1935, Courmettes went on to patent the Tilted Bifocal Lens, in 1936, a method of grinding two prescriptions simultaneously on that Tilted Bifocal Lens, and in 1951, the Cataract Bifocal Lens. 

Today most bifocals are created by moulding a reading segment into a primary lens and are available with the reading segments in a variety of shapes and sizes.

==Problems==
Bifocals can contribute to falls, cause headaches, and even dizziness for some wearers. Adaptation to the small field of view offered by the reading segment of bifocals can take some time, as the user learns to move either the head or the reading material rather than the eyes. Computer monitors are generally placed directly in front of users and can lead to muscle fatigue due to the unusual straight and constant movement of the head. This trouble is mitigated by the use of monofocal lenses for computer use.

==Future==

Research continues in an attempt to eliminate the limited field of vision in current bifocals. New materials and technologies may provide a method which can selectively adjust the optical power of a lens. Researchers have constructed such a lens using a liquid crystal layer applied between two glass substrates.

==Bifocals in the animal world==
The aquatic larval stage of the diving beetle &quot;Thermonectus marmoratus&quot; has, in its principal eyes, two retinas and two distinct focal planes that are substantially separated (in the manner of bifocals) to switch their vision from up-close to distance, for easy and efficient capture of their prey, mostly mosquito larvae.

<text>Ramon &quot;Tiki&quot; Fulwood (May 23, 1944 – October 29, 1979) was an American musician. He was the drummer for the funk bands Parliament and Funkadelic, as well as a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, inducted in 1997 with fifteen other members of Parliament-Funkadelic.

== Career ==
Fulwood was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1944. In the late 1960s, Fulwood was the house drummer for the Uptown Theater in Philadelphia when he met guitarist Eddie Hazel. Hazel and bassist Billy Bass Nelson were on tour as musical support for the doo wop vocal group The Parliaments. Hazel and Nelson convinced group leader George Clinton to add Fulwood to the group, where he replaced drummer Harvey McGee. Fulwood, Hazel, and Nelson formed the core of The Parliaments musical backing group, which later became known as Funkadelic. Fulwood first quit Funkadelic in 1971 following a pay dispute with Clinton, but played with Parliament-Funkadelic sporadically thereafter.

Fulwood also played drums in the Tyrone Davis band and the Chairmen of the Board between stints with P-Funk, and later was briefly employed by Miles Davis. Fulwood died of stomach cancer in 1979. In 2016, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Fulwood at no. 39 in its 100 greatest drummers of all time, and in 2013 &quot;Spin&quot; named ranked him at no. 76 in its 100 greatest drummers of alternative music.

<doc id="150425" wikidata="Q489255" url="?curid=150425" title="Sioux City, Iowa">
<text>Sioux City () is a city in Woodbury and Plymouth counties in the U.S. state of Iowa. The population was 85,797 in the 2020 census, making it the fourth-most populous city in Iowa. The county seat of Woodbury County, Sioux City is the primary city of the five-county Sioux City metropolitan area, which had 149,940 residents in 2020. Sioux City and the surrounding areas of northwestern Iowa, northeastern Nebraska and southeastern South Dakota are sometimes referred to collectively as Siouxland.

Sioux City is located at the navigational head of the Missouri River. The city is home to several cultural points of interest including the Sioux City Public Museum, Sioux City Art Center and Sergeant Floyd Monument, which is a National Historic Landmark. The city is also home to Chris Larsen Park, commonly referred to as &quot;the Riverfront&quot;, which includes the Anderson Dance Pavilion, Sergeant Floyd River Museum &amp; Welcome Center and Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center. 

==History==

Iowa is in the tallgrass prairie of the North American Great Plains, historically inhabited by speakers of Siouan languages.
The area of Sioux City was inhabited by Yankton Sioux when it was first reached by Spanish and French furtrappers in the 18th century. The first documented US citizens to record their travels through this area were Meriwether Lewis and William Clark during the summer of 1804. Sergeant Charles Floyd, a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, died here on August 20, 1804, the only death during the two and a half-year expedition.

Sioux City was laid out in the winter of 1854–1855. It became a major transportation hub to the western Plains, including Mormons heading to Salt Lake City and speculators heading to Wyoming goldfields.

In 1891, the Sioux City Elevated Railway was opened and became the third steam-powered elevated rapid transit system in the world, and later the first electric-powered elevated railway in the world after conversion in 1892. However, the system fell into bankruptcy and closed within a decade.

The city gained the nickname &quot;Little Chicago&quot; during the Prohibition era due to its reputation for being a purveyor of alcoholic beverages.

On July 19, 1989, United Airlines Flight 232 crash-landed at Sioux Gateway Airport, killing 112 people, but 184 survived the crash and ensuing fire due to outstandingly quick performances by fire and emergency local teams.

According to a 2015 University of Iowa study for the Iowa Initiative for Sustainable Communities, blight and disinvestment are serious problems in the downtown core as investment has shifted to suburbs.

==Geography==
Sioux City borders two states, South Dakota to the west-northwest and Nebraska to the west.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

<text>Carlisle is a city in Warren and Polk counties in the U.S. state of Iowa. The population was 4,160 at the 2020 census. The city is part of the Des Moines–West Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The city received considerable media attention in 1997 when Carlisle residents Kenny and Bobbi McCaughey (pronounced &quot;McCoy&quot;) became the parents of the world&#x27;s first surviving set of septuplets.

== History ==
=== Liberty and Dudley ===
Jeremiah &quot;Uncle Jerry&quot; Church was an early settler in Iowa, who arrived in Fort Des Moines in the summer of 1845.
He laid out a new town in Polk County, just north of the border with Warren, in the winter of 1845 that he named Dudley.
This was his second attempt at platting the town, the first attempt he had named Liberty and abandoned because the place that he had chosen turned out to be school land.

The tale goes that he staked his claim of Dudley at midnight on 1845-10-11 by the light of some burning Native American dwellings that he had set on fire.
Church&#x27;s plans for Dudley were ambitious; he wanted it to rival Des Moines, ran a ferry to the location himself, and even invited the territorial commissioners to consider it as a candidate for county seat of Polk County.
But the town did not last very long, as it was destroyed by the Flood of 1851, the commissioners having earlier noted in their rejection of it for county seat that it was located on low ground.

=== Carlisle ===
So Church, who also founded Brooklyn, Iowa alongside T. K. Brooks and William Lamb (a town that he put forward as a contender for the state capital), set out on his third attempt at a town in Polk, which he named Carlisle and laid out in 1851 with David Moore.
This was also located in Polk, south-west of the former Dudley, but the county borders were changed in 1852, which relocated it to the southern half of Allen Township, which was split in two in order to restore a so-called &quot;stolen strip&quot; in the north of Warren County.

Church himself had been the first merchant in Dudley, but the first merchant in its replacement was Abraham Shoemaker, previously a businessman in Dudley.
Other firsts were Robert Nicholson, first mayor; Albert Petrie, the first child born there; William Buxton who built the first flour mill there; Jackson Shoemaker and Ellen Compton, the first couple to be married there; and Elias Compton, the first person to die there (in 1851).

It is named after Carlisle, Pennsylvania and was incorporated in May 1870.
The town experienced growth in 1871 when the railroad was built through it, with the town&#x27;s primary business area, until that time located at the top of a hill, moving down to the valley where the railway line was located, leaving the hill as a primarily residential area, with homes and churches.

Buxton&#x27;s flour mill company was the Carlisle Flouring Mills, incorporated in 1854 with Buxton as chairman and John Leas as company secretary and treasurer.
Other officers were Carlisle citizens A. B. Shoemaker, Daniel Moore, James Mount, Thomas Obriety, a Dr. Ward, Hugh Marshman, and Edwin Oaks.
The actual mill, a 4 storey building housing two runs of burrs, was completed in June 1856, at a cost of .
Robert Nicholson bought it in 1863, and proceeded in 1874 to extend it lengthwise so that it could house five runs of burrs and two purifiers, driven by a engine.
By this point it had cost .

Carlisle&#x27;s first schoolhouse was built in 1853 and the building itself lasted through at least 1879, although by that time it had become merely a private home.
Daniel Moore built it at a cost of .
The school itself closed some time in 1869 or 1870 when a 2 storey school house had been constructed to replace it, which was extended in 1879.

&quot;Uncle Jerry&quot; Church lived in Carlisle until his death in November 1874.

By 1879 the town had a population of around 500, four churches (Methodist, Baptist, Christian, and United Bretheren), two general stores, three groceries, three drug stores, four physicians, a blacksmith, a wagon maker, a mechanic, a grain dealer, a hotel, a pottery, a brick yard, a meat market, a tin, hardware, &amp; cabinet shop, and a shoe shop.
Its postmaster was Will R. Randleman, and its justices were J. F. Stivers (also a notary public) and J. E. McClintic.

On the evening of June 13, 1998, an F2 tornado damaged much of the downtown, but no casualties were reported. The downtown area received little warning as the tornado struck less than 1 minute after the tornado siren began to sound. The tornado, which touched down half a mile west of the Sabetha City Hall, caused serious damage to two blocks of the town, with 18 buildings in the downtown area being damaged, five (including the city hall building) to near &quot;the point of loss&quot;. The tornado lifted about half a mile east of City Hall. Damage to the city hall building amounted to $2 million, and additional damage to homes and vehicles away from downtown occurred due to tornado-toppled trees and branches away from the tornado&#x27;s center along with strong straight-line winds.

<text>Geuda Springs is a city in Cowley and Sumner counties in the U.S. state of Kansas. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 158.

==History==

On the line between Cowley and Sumner counties is a remarkable group of salt springs that each put out 100 to 450 gallons per hour and have been known since the earliest settlement of that region. These springs are on a branch of the St. Louis &amp; San Francisco railroad, a little to the north of the town of Geuda Springs and about from Arkansas City. The waters from these springs infiltrate the waters of the nearby creeks. A lake formed by the creek near these springs has been greatly enlarged by damming the creek and now covers about , making it the largest body of salt water in the state. Geuda is said to be an Indian word, Ge-u-da, meaning healing springs, and the place must have been a well known stopping place with the Indians. Many improvements were made at the springs during the late 1880s, including a bath-house and hotel, lake improvements, and new automobile access. Much of the water has been bottled and shipped to points in Kansas and adjoining states. About 1890, a dam with a flume outlet was built across the salt marsh just north of the springs, which filled the marsh with water and created a lake large enough for recreational boating.

Later in the 1900s, the population of Geuda Springs slowly declined. During the 1950s, Geuda Springs had a bar which featured slot machines, dancing and music. A volunteer fire department exists to protect the town and the surrounding area but primary fire protection is provided by Arkansas City. In the 1990s, a new community center was built for the residents. It is surrounded by homes over 80 years of age and an old church building. Geuda Springs has a cemetery to the northwest of town with tombstones dating to the 1870s. One notable gunfighter Luke Short, died in Geuda Springs in 1893 of congestive heart failure.
