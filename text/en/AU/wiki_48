<text>The rebec (sometimes rebecha, rebeckha, and other spellings, pronounced or ) is a bowed stringed instrument of the Medieval era and the early Renaissance. In its most common form, it has a narrow boat-shaped body and one to five strings.

==Origins==
Popular from the 13th to 16th centuries, the introduction of the rebec into Western Europe coincided with the Arabic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula. There is, however, evidence of the existence of bowed instruments in the 9th century in Eastern Europe. The Persian geographer of the 9th century Ibn Khurradadhbih cited the bowed Byzantine lira (or &quot;lūrā&quot;) as a typical bowed instrument of the Byzantines and equivalent to the pear-shaped Arab &quot;rebab&quot;.

The rebec was adopted as a key instrument in Arab classical music and in Morocco it was used in the tradition of Arabo-Andalusian music, which had been kept alive by descendants of Muslims who left Spain as refugees following the Reconquista. The rebec also became a favorite instrument in the tea houses of the Ottoman Empire.

The rebec was first referred to by that name around the beginning of the 14th century, though a similar instrument, usually called a &quot;lira da braccio&quot; (arm lyre), had been played since around the 9th century. The name derives from the 15th century Middle French &quot;rebec&quot;, altered in an unexplained manner from the 13th century Old French &quot;ribabe&quot;, which in turn comes from the Arabic &quot;rebab&quot;. An early form of the rebec is also referred to as the &quot;rubeba&quot; in a 13th century Moravian treatise on music. Medieval sources refer to the instrument by several other names, including kit and the generic term fiddle.

A distinguishing feature of the rebec is that the bowl (or body) of the instrument is carved from a solid piece of wood. This distinguishes it from the later period vielles and gambas known in the Renaissance.

== Tuning ==
The number of strings on the rebec varies from 1 to 5, although three is the most common number. Early forms of the instrument commonly had 2. The strings are often tuned in fifths, although this tuning is not universal. Many depictions of the rebec show its bridge as flat, which would mean that several strings were bowed at the same time. This suggests that the strings would likely be tuned in fifths and fourths similar to the fiddle and mandora. The instrument was originally in the treble range, like the violin, but later larger versions were developed, so that by the 16th century composers were able to write pieces for consorts of rebecs, just as they did for consorts of viols.

== In use ==
The rebec was often played by professional minstrels and musicians at feasts. In northern Europe, musicians typically held it at the shoulder, while musicians in southern Europe and northern Africa held it down in the lap and gripped the bow from below.

The use of frets on the rebec is somewhat ambiguous. Many scholars who have written about the instrument have described it as fretless. However, some illustrations from the 13th century onward depict frets on the rebec. It is possible to attribute this discrepancy to the fact that frets on bowed instruments appeared in Europe in the early renaissance, but not in England until the 15th century.

In time, the viol came to replace the rebec, and the instrument was little used beyond the renaissance period. The instrument was used by dance masters until the 18th century, however, often being used for the same purpose as the kit, a small pocket-sized violin. The rebec also remained in use in folk music, especially in eastern Europe and Spain. Andalusi nubah, a genre of music from North Africa, often includes the rebec. Chilote Waltz (a variation of traditional waltz, played in Chiloe Island, Chile) also uses the rebec.

== In popular culture ==
Hugh Rebeck is a minor character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, one of the musicians called by Peter in an oft-cut scene. Presumably, he is named for the instrument that he plays.

In a scene in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, a goatherd entertains Don Quixote and Sancho Panza by playing a rebec and singing a love song.

A rebec featured prominently in one of Ellis Peters&#x27; (12th century) Brother Cadfael stories: Liliwin, the title character of &quot;The Sanctuary Sparrow&quot;, earned his living by playing that instrument. His rebec was damaged by a mob that accused him of murder, but one of the monks repaired it and returned to him at the end of the story.

<text>Nicholas Barbon ( 1640 – 1698) was an English economist, physician, and financial speculator. Historians of mercantilism consider him to be one of the first proponents of the free market.

In the aftermath of the Great Fire of London, he became an active London property developer and helped to pioneer fire insurance and mortgages as a means of financing such developments.

==Early life==
Nicholas Barbon was born in London in either 1637 or 1640. He was the eldest son of Praise-God Barebone (or Barbon), the namesake of Barebone&#x27;s Parliament of 1653, the predecessor of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s Protectorate. Praise-God Barebone was a Fifth Monarchist who purportedly gave Nicholas the baptismal name &quot;If-Jesus-Christ-had-not-died-for-thee-thou-hadst-been-damned,&quot; an example of a hortatory name, a type of virtue name that was common among some Dissenting families in 17th-century England. Conflicting sources claim the name &quot;Unless-Jesus-Christ-Had-Died-For-Thee-Thou-Hadst-Been-Damned&quot; was given to Nicholas&#x27; father or to his uncle and Nicholas&#x27; hortatory name was supposedly a variant on this name. 

Barbon became a religious separatist with Millenarianist beliefs, including fervent advocacy of infant baptism in particular. He studied medicine at the Universities of Leiden and Utrecht in the Netherlands, and received his Doctor of Medicine qualification from the latter in 1661. Three years later, he became an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in London.

==Property development==
He soon turned from the medical profession to the building trade, which suddenly became important in 1666 when the Great Fire of London devastated most of the City of London which at the time was separated from Westminster, the seat of Britain&#x27;s government, by two miles of countryside, dotted with grand mansions. Within a few years he was &quot;the most prominent London builder of his age&quot;. He built houses streets at a time, often around squares, and his developments were mostly to the west of the City of London, where land was plentiful.

Barbon was responsible for joining the city to the seat of government at Westminster for the first time as a result of developments along the Strand, Bloomsbury, St Giles and Holborn. Barbon did this despite long-established restrictions on new buildings associated with various Acts of Parliament and royal declarations in the late 16th century: he often simply disregarded legal and local objections, demolished existing buildings without permission and rebuilt speculatively in search of a quick profit.

On 11 June 1684, Barbon&#x27;s expansionary speculation brought him and his building tradesmen into conflict with lawyers based at Gray&#x27;s Inn. Barbon started his largest project yet, the redevelopment of Red Lion Square, and environs in Holborn without being authorised to do so. The Gray&#x27;s Inn lawyers, Inns of Court adjacent saw their rural outlooks jeopardised, and started physical fist fights with Barbon&#x27;s workmen, but the developer and his men fought back. The lawyers subsequently obtained warrants for his arrest but Barbon had these set aside and the development scheme was completed. Another setback came when houses he had built at Mincing Lane collapsed because of inadequate foundations.

&quot;He was unique in the unscrupulousness and brazenness of his business tactics&quot; and his contemporary Roger North, who studied his dealings and interviewed him on the subject, called him &quot;an exquisite mob master&quot; in recognition of his ability to manipulate people to carry out his schemes.

==Insurance and mortgages==
At the same time, Barbon took an interest in the development of insurance and the banking industry, and helped to pioneer both. In 1680–81, with 11 associates, he founded an &quot;Insurance Office for Houses&quot; which offered fire insurance for up to 5,000 households in London. Fires were a major danger in London at the time: the Great Fire destroyed more than 13,000 houses and displaced about 100,000 people, and another conflagration in 1678 damaged the Middle Temple, one of the Inns of Court. In 1690, together with John Asgill, he founded the National Land Bank. This was Britain&#x27;s first land bank—a financial institution which issued loans in the form of mortgages against real estate.

These were popular with landowners because they could now raise money against the value of their main asset. The bank was moderately successful, and even threatened to usurp the Bank of England in 1696. The government budget deficit had grown to an unsustainable level; Barbon merged the National Land Bank with another institution (founded by John Briscoe) to form Land Bank United, and offered the government a £2 million loan (£ as of ). The scheme foundered when Barbon and Briscoe could not raise enough money, and Land Bank United was demerged.

Barbon was also active in other fields during the 1690s. Largely in order to take advantage of Parliamentary privilege and thus gain immunity from prosecution by his creditors he bought a number of burgages in the rotten borough of Bramber in Sussex, which enabled him to be elected one of its Members of Parliament in 1690 and 1695. Another project involved trying to pump drinking water from the River Thames, to be piped to his new building developments. He patented a design in 1694, and tried to sell pumping rights alongside fire insurance contracts.

==Economic theory==

During the later part of his life, Nicholas Barbon wrote extensively on economic theory. His pamphlets and books on political economy are considered important because of their innovative views on money, trade (especially free trade) and supply and demand. His works, especially &quot;A Discourse of Trade&quot; (written in 1690), influenced and drew praise from 20th-century economists such as John Maynard Keynes (in &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot;) and Joseph Schumpeter. Karl Marx cites his work, notably &quot;A Discourse on Coining the New Money Lighter&quot; of (1696) in &quot;Das Capital&quot;. He was one of several late 17th-century economic, social and political theorists with a medical education background; contemporaries included Benjamin Worsley, Hugh Chamberlen, William Petty and John Locke.

His early writings sought to explain and advertise his insurance and mortgage schemes and his building developments; for example, in his &quot;Apology for the Builder: or a Discourse showing the Cause and Effects of the Increase of Building&quot; of 1685—written in the aftermath of his fight with the lawyers of Gray&#x27;s Inn—Barbon justified (anonymously) his expansionary building policy by describing the benefits it would bring to London and Britain as a whole. His &quot;A Discourse of Trade&quot;, written five years later, was much more significant, however. As a broad explanation of his economic and political views, it brought together all of his ideas and became the basis for his reputation as an economic theorist.

Barbon observed the power of fashion and luxury goods to enhance trade. Fashion demanded the replacement of goods before they had worn out; he believed this directed people towards the continuous purchasing of goods, which therefore created constant demand. These views were contrary to standard moral values of the time, influenced by the government and the church. He was one of the earliest writers to draw this distinction between the moral and economic aspects of purchasing.

His views on interest were praised by Joseph Schumpeter. Barbon described as a &quot;mistake&quot; the standard view that interest is a monetary value, arguing that because money is typically borrowed to buy assets (goods and stock), the interest that is charged on the loan is a type of rent—&quot;a payment for the use of goods&quot;. From this, Schumpeter extrapolated the argument that just as rent is the price paid for the use of what he called &quot;unwrought stock, or the &quot;natural agents&quot; of [economic] production&quot;, interest is the price paid for &quot;wrought stock—the &quot;produced&quot; means of production&quot;.

One of the main arguments in &quot;A Discourse of Trade&quot; was that money did not have enough intrinsic value to justify a government&#x27;s hoarding of it; policies intended to help accumulate supposedly &quot;valuable&quot; commodities such as silver and gold were not appropriate, because the laws of supply and demand were the main determiner of their value. Such criticism of mercantilism—the view that a country&#x27;s prosperity can be measured by its stock of bullion—helped to lay the foundation for classical economics, and was unusual at the time. Along with John Locke, with whom he debated his theories, Barbon was one of the first theorists to argue that money&#x27;s value was principally symbolic and that its main function was to assist trade. These views were expanded upon in his 1696 pamphlet, &quot;A Discourse Concerning Coining the New Money Lighter&quot;.

Barbon was influenced by populationism; he identified a country&#x27;s wealth with its population. He also advocated the use of paper and credit money, and postulated the reduction of interest rates, which he thought impeded the growth in manufacturing and trade. He discussed these issues in his 1696 pamphlet, which also considered the effects of the Recoinage of that year, in which the Royal Mint recalled large quantities of silver coins, melted them down and reminted them, resulting in a temporary fall in the supply of money.

Despite the importance of some of his theories, Barbon&#x27;s work (especially &quot;A Discourse of Trade&quot;) has been criticised for an excess of &quot;definition and classification&quot; instead of analysis and a disjointed style which lacked rigour. This has been attributed to the early period in which he wrote, when economic thought was not yet fully developed.

==Later life and death==
Barbon built a house for himself and his business interests in Crane Court, off Fleet Street, but later moved to Osterley House, a large 16th-century mansion west of London.

By the time of his death, Barbon had built or financed developments to the value of £200,000 (£ as of ) according to Sir John Lowther, 1st Viscount Lonsdale.

He died at Osterley in 1698 or 1699. His will was written in May 1698 and his executors received probate on 6 February 1699.

== Memorial ==

<doc id="151724" wikidata="Q1042851" url="?curid=151724" title="Carlos De León">
<text>Carlos De León, also known as &quot;Sugar&quot; De Leon, (May 3, 1959 – January 1, 2020) was a Puerto Rican boxer who made history by becoming the first cruiserweight to win the world title twice. Subsequently, he kept breaking his own record for the most times as cruiserweight champion by regaining the title on two further occasions.

== Career ==

De León, a native of Trujillo Alto, Puerto Rico, first won a world title when he faced the WBC world champion Marvin Camel on November 25, 1980, replacing David Pearce the Great Britain boxer on the undercard of Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Durán&#x27;s second fight in New Orleans. De León outpointed Camel over fifteen rounds. In a rematch later, De León knocked out Camel in eight rounds. When his countryman Ossie Ocasio won the WBA world title, De León and Ocasio became the second pair of Puerto Ricans to share world titles in the same division at the same time; Alfredo Escalera and Samuel Serrano had achieved the feat in the 1970s in the junior lightweight division.

=== Taking loss ===
De León lost his title in a shocking upset to former Gerry Cooney victim S. T. Gordon by a knockout in round two in Cleveland in 1982, and won a comeback fight versus former world heavyweight champion Leon Spinks by a knockout in round six in 1983. After that, he and Gordon boxed a rematch in Las Vegas, and De León dropped Gordon once in the first round and once in the twelfth, en route to a unanimous decision win in a history-making bout: De León had now become the first boxer to win the world cruiserweight title twice.

=== Champion again ===
He defended his title against &quot;Yaqui López&quot; by a knockout in four at San Jose, California, and with decisions over Anthony Davis and Bashiru Ali. The Davis bout took place in Las Vegas and the fight with Ali was in Oakland, California. De León next lost his title in Las Vegas to Alfonzo Ratliff in a decision. Ratliff was in turn beaten by Bernard Benton, who defended against De León on March 22, 1986, once again in Las Vegas. De León joined the likes of Sugar Ray Robinson and Muhammad Ali in becoming one of the few boxers ever to win one division&#x27;s world championship at least three times, defeating Benton by decision.

=== Once more ===
He made a couple of defenses in Italy and then in 1988, he defended the title against Uruguayan José María Flores Burlón in Atlantic City, New Jersey, winning by twelve rounds in a unanimous decision but then he lost his titles in a unification bout with WBA and IBF world champion Evander Holyfield, by technical knockout in the eighth round, also in Las Vegas. But Holyfield soon left the division to pursue the world heavyweight championship, and De León was left with an open door to break his own record and win the title for a record fourth time. He went to London, where he beat the WBC&#x27;s number two ranked contender, Sammy Reeson, by a knockout in the ninth round, breaking his own record and was crowned world cruiserweight champion once again.

=== Holding on ===
Carlos held on to the title for two years until finally losing it to Massimiliano Duran in Italy in an eleventh-round disqualification. He gained the title by his aforementioned win over Sammy Reeson. He made a defense by drawing with Johnny Nelson before the loss to Massimilano Duran mentioned earlier.

== After boxing ==
During the 1990s, De León ran afoul of the law a number of times, once while he was carrying a rifle. He worked on helping the professional boxing career of his son, prospect Carlos de León Jr.

He died on January 1, 2020, due to a cardiac arrest. He was 60.

<doc id="151727" wikidata="Q199418" url="?curid=151727" title="Ziggy Marley">
<text>David Nesta &quot;Ziggy&quot; Marley (born 17 October 1968) is a Jamaican reggae musician. He is the son of reggae icon Bob Marley and Rita Marley. He led the family band Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers until 2002, with whom he released eight studio albums. After the disbandment, he launched a successful solo career, releasing eight solo studio albums on his own label, Tuff Gong Worldwide. Ziggy continues his father&#x27;s practice of recording and self-releasing all of his music. He is an eight-time Grammy Award winner and a Daytime Emmy Award recipient.

==Early life==
David Nesta Marley was born in Kingston, Jamaica, on 17 October 1968. He grew up in Trenchtown, a poor neighborhood of Kingston, and in Wilmington, Delaware, where he attended elementary school for a few years. Ziggy grew up very active, playing soccer and running the mountains, a lifestyle passed on by his parents. As the oldest son of Bob and Rita Marley, Ziggy grew up surrounded by music. He has 5 half brothers, one brother, and two sisters. He received guitar and drum lessons from his father and began sitting in on Wailers recording sessions by the age of ten.

==Career==

===1979–1984: Family beginnings===
In the earliest known record of his musical career, Marley performed as part of a singing group called The Seven Do Bees, made up of him and his classmates, and wherein he was given the stage name &quot;Freddie Dic&quot;. The name never stuck, however, and instead, David went on to become known as &quot;Ziggy&quot;, a nickname often reported to have been given to him by his father Bob Marley, meaning &quot;little spliff&quot;. However, Ziggy stated the following to &quot;Melody Maker&quot; magazine in 1988: &quot;Me name David but me big Bowie fan. So at the time of the &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; album, me call meself Ziggy and now everyone do.&quot;

During the late 1970s, Ziggy could also be seen alongside his brother Stephen at some of their father&#x27;s larger concerts around Jamaica and abroad. In 1978, the duo appeared on stage at the One Love Peace Concert in Kingston, and the following year at Reggae Sunsplash II in Montego Bay.

===1985–2002: Ziggy Marley &amp; The Melody Makers===

In 1979, Ziggy and his siblings Sharon, Cedella and Stephen formed the Melody Makers (named after the British weekly pop/rock music newspaper, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;) and made their recording debut with &quot;Children Playing in the Streets&quot;. The track was written for them by their father, who had composed the song for them four years earlier. All royalties from the single were pledged to the United Nations, to aid its efforts during the International Year of the Child.

The Melody Makers made their onstage debut as a group on 23 September 1979, performing on the same bill as their father for the first and only time at the &quot;Roots Rock Reggae&quot; two-day concert series in Kingston&#x27;s National Arena. Ziggy was 11 years old at the time. Notable other early moments in Ziggy&#x27;s musical history include a performance with Stephen at their father&#x27;s funeral in 1981, and later that year the Melody Makers released their second single, &quot;What A Plot&quot;, under the family&#x27;s Tuff Gong record label. The Melody Makers recorded an unreleased album titled &quot;Children Playing&quot; in 1979.

Following Bob Marley&#x27;s death in 1981, Ziggy began performing in his place alongside the Wailers at various shows around Jamaica, and in 1984 the group went on tour in support of the year&#x27;s Bob Marley &quot;Legend&quot; compilation album release. The Melody Makers&#x27; first fully released album was &quot;Play the Game Right&quot; in 1985. Their 1988 album &quot;Conscious Party&quot; was a major worldwide hit and received a Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album. In 1996, the band performed the theme song &quot;Believe in Yourself&quot; for the animated children&#x27;s show &quot;Arthur&quot;. Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers won three Grammy Awards and five nominations in total before disbanding in 2002.

===2003–2006: Dragonfly/Solo Career beginning===

After the Melody Makers disbanded, Ziggy Marley launched a solo career. His debut solo album, &quot;Dragonfly&quot;, was released in April 2003. The album featured the single &quot;True To Myself&quot;, which remains one of his biggest hits. The track &quot;Rainbow in the Sky&quot; features both Flea and John Frusciante of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, while &quot;Melancholy Mood&quot; features only Flea.

===2006–2011: Tuff Gong Worldwide (independent artist)===
In July 2006, his second solo album, &quot;Love Is My Religion&quot;, was released on his independent record label Tuff Gong Worldwide. The album won a Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album, making it Marley&#x27;s 4th Grammy win.

Marley performed a duet with Donna Summer for her 2008 album &quot;Crayons&quot;. In May 2009, his third solo album &quot;Family Time&quot;, was released on Tuff Gong Worldwide. &quot;Family Time&quot; was presented as a children&#x27;s album and features family and friends: Rita Marley, Cedella Marley, Judah Marley, Paul Simon, Willie Nelson, Jack Johnson, Toots Hibbert, Laurie Berkner, Elizabeth Mitchell, and more. This album won a Grammy Award for Best Musical Album for Children. In June 2011, Marley released his fourth album &quot;Wild and Free&quot;. The title track, featuring Woody Harrelson, was available for free with the pre-order of Ziggy&#x27;s first comic book, &quot;Marijuanaman&quot;.

=== 2012–present: Two more albums ===

In 2013, Marley&#x27;s song &quot;I Love You Too&quot; won him a Daytime Emmy Award in the Outstanding Original Song – Children&#x27;s and Animation category, after it was used in the Cbeebies animation &quot;3rd &amp; Bird&quot;. Ziggy released the children&#x27;s book, &quot;I Love You Too&quot;, based on the song and illustrated by Agnieszka Jatkowska. In April 2014, Ziggy Marley released his fifth solo studio album, entitled &quot;Fly Rasta&quot;. &quot;Fly Rasta&quot; won the Grammy for Best Reggae Album at the 57th Grammy Awards. Marley later announced his sixth solo album &quot;Ziggy Marley&quot; to be released spring 2016.

In May 2018, Marley released his most recent studio album, &quot;Rebellion Rises&quot;, through Tuff Gong Worldwide. The album received rave reviews upon release. &quot;Cryptic Rock&quot; gave the album 5 out of 5 stars, stating &quot;Politically and socially relevant, Rebellion Rises is a war of music, creating peace with a purpose.&quot;. &quot;Island Stage&quot; called the album &quot;a 10-track masterpiece that continues his father&#x27;s tradition of promoting emancipation from mental slavery through education, social activism, and healthy living.&quot; &quot;Reggaeville&quot; said the album &quot;is not an angry record. It is not a bitter record. But, it is not a record of hope, either. The time of hoping for change is a notion Marley considers past due. This is a record of action, and for Ziggy Marley, the time for action is now.&quot;

<doc id="151732" wikidata="Q1757318" url="?curid=151732" title="The Rascals">
<text>The Rascals (originally known as the Young Rascals) are an American rock band, formed in Garfield, New Jersey, southeast of Paterson in 1965. The original lineup featured lead vocalist and keyboardist Felix Cavaliere, vocalist and percussionist Eddie Brigati, drummer Dino Danelli, and guitarist and vocalist Gene Cornish. Cavaliere and Brigati wrote the majority of the Rascals&#x27; original material.

Between 1966 and 1968 the band gained popularity with a blend of rock, pop and soul music. Nine of their singles charted in the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, including the #1s &quot;Good Lovin&#x27;&quot; (1966), &quot;Groovin&#x27;&quot; (1967), and &quot;People Got to Be Free&quot; (1968); as well as big radio hits like the much-covered &quot;How Can I Be Sure?&quot; (#4 1967) and &quot;A Beautiful Morning&quot; (#3 1968). Another critical favorite &quot;A Girl Like You&quot; (#10 1967), became an early example of the blue-eyed soul genre. Additionally, four of the band&#x27;s LPs received gold certifications in the US, including the top 10 albums &quot;Groovin&#x27;&quot; (1967) and &quot;Once Upon a Dream&quot; (1968). The group continued into the early 1970s after the departures of Brigati and Cornish, with Cavaliere leading the Rascals in a more album-oriented direction with strong jazz and funk influences.

The Rascals were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997 and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2010, and the classic lineup also reunited in 2012 for a series of shows in New York and New Jersey. The reunion continued in 2013 with shows on Broadway. Cavaliere and Cornish began performing again as the Rascals in 2022 without Brigati and Danelli, the latter of whom died the same year.

==History==
=== Origins ===
Felix Cavaliere was already trained in classical piano by his mother when he founded a doo-wop group, the Escorts (not the R&amp;B group with the same name), while enrolled at Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York east of Rochester. In 1964, Cavaliere took a job with Joey Dee&#x27;s backing band, the Starliters of &quot;Peppermint Twist&quot; fame, where he met Starliter David Brigati. When the group played the Choo Choo Club in Garfield, Cavaliere met Brigati&#x27;s younger brother, Eddie, who wanted to follow in his brother&#x27;s footsteps. Cavaliere, in an interview with journalist Don Paulson, spoke about when he first met the younger Brigati:

Canadian guitarist Gene Cornish left his group, The Unbeatables, for which he acted as frontman, to join the Starliters, in early 1965. After meeting Cornish, Cavaliere&#x27;s interest in forming a band of his own led him to convince both Cornish and (Eddie) Brigati to depart from Dee&#x27;s backing band to start a new one with an old acquaintance of his, jazz drummer Dino Danelli. The group came up with the name &quot;Rascals&quot; while at the Choo Choo Club. Prior to the Rascals name they were using another group name &quot;Them&quot;. Because there was another group, which included Van Morrison, using the name &quot;Them&quot; in the UK they dropped that name and came up with The Rascals name through the help of TV comedy star Soupy Sales whom they met through manager Billy (Amato) Smith. The Rascals were Sales&#x27; back up band touring local colleges in the early months of 1965.

Initially, the Rascals began rehearsing at Cavaliere&#x27;s house in Pelham Manor, New York east of Yonkers and then the Choo Choo Club, mostly because it was close to Brigati&#x27;s home and they needed a showcase. Later in May 1965, under the direction of their management Billy (Amato) Smith, they were hired to do a summer engagement at the debut of The Barge, a floating club by Dune Road in Westhampton Beach, New York. They settled at the club in eastern Long Island and there developed their mixed R&amp;B-soul sound based on Cavaliere&#x27;s organ and soulful vocals, mostly filled with traditional R&amp;B covers. The quartet did not have any official bass player, because of Brigati&#x27;s inability to play musical instruments, other than percussion (even when the band bought him a Fender Mustang Bass in 1967) and the Rascals&#x27; wish of staying in the formula of four members. Cavaliere&#x27;s organ pedals (and later, session bassists like Chuck Rainey, in studio recordings) filled the bass parts.

At the Barge club in August 1965, manager Billy (Amato) Smith, who discovered them at the beginning of their music career as the Rascals, introduced the group to Sid Bernstein, an impresario known at the time for helping to promote the British Invasion, bringing famous UK bands like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones to America. Promoting the band, Bernstein and Smith came up with the publicity stunt of posting the phrase &quot;The Rascals are coming!&quot; at the Shea Stadium&#x27;s scoreboard, at the same time that the Fab Four were doing the opening of their 1965 North American tour. Beatles manager Brian Epstein ordered the post to be removed before his band arrived on the stage.

This event helped the group to get a $15,000 contract with Atlantic Records, a label which mainly had black artists, becoming the first white-only act to be signed at Atlantic. Bernstein managed them for the next five years with Billy (Amato) Smith as their publicist and promotion advisor. The contract also stipulated that the band could self-produce their records. But problems arose when they discovered that another group, Borrah Minnevitch&#x27;s and Johnny Puleo&#x27;s &#x27;Harmonica Rascals&#x27;, objected to their release of records under the name &#x27;The Rascals&#x27;. To avoid conflict, Bernstein decided to rename the group &#x27;The Young Rascals&#x27;, possibly because all the members were under 25.

=== Commercial success and songwriting development ===
The line-up of Brigati on lead vocals, Cavaliere on organ, Cornish on guitar and Danelli on drums was present in the Young Rascals&#x27; debut single, the Pam Sawyer/Lori Burton &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore&quot;, which was performed in their first television performance on the program &quot;Hullabaloo&quot; on February 24, 1966. But the track reached only #23 in Canada and did not reach the Top 40 of the US charts. After the modest success of &quot;Eat Out My Heart Anymore&quot;, Cavaliere assumed the lead vocals on their subsequent records, starting with its follow-up &quot;Good Lovin&#x27;&quot;, originally recorded by Lemme B. Good and The Olympics in 1965, with the same arrangement and different lyrics from the original. Ironically, David Brigati had been the lead singer of the Starliters, but never had any hits; once Joey Dee had a hit with &quot;The Peppermint Twist&quot; he took over the lead vocals. History repeated itself when Felix replaced Eddie as the Rascals&#x27; lead singer. They performed &quot;Good Lovin&#x27;&quot; on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. The Young Rascals version became their first Canada/USA #1. Shortly after, their eponymous debut album was released, mostly composed of garage rock renditions of folk rock (&quot;Just a Little&quot; and &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;), and soul tunes (&quot;Mustang Sally&quot; and &quot;In the Midnight Hour&quot;), with only one original, the Cavaliere/Cornish penned &quot;Do You Feel It&quot;. &quot;The Young Rascals&quot; reached #15 on the Billboard Top LPs chart and #10 in &quot;Cashbox&quot;. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA.

From there the songwriting partnership between Felix Cavaliere and Eddie Brigati began to flourish. Cavaliere wrote the music and themes, and Brigati, the verses with the former&#x27;s help. Their second album, &quot;Collections&quot;, had four Cavaliere/Brigati songs and two Cornish originals in its eleven tracks. Follow-ups to their number one record, &quot;You Better Run&quot;–later covered by Pat Benatar in 1980 – and &quot;Come On Up&quot;, did not do as well as their predecessor (peaking at #20 and #43, respectively). The band made their UK debut on December1, 1966, at The Scotch of St. James club in London. Paul McCartney attended the concert and was so excited by the band that he also attended their show the following night, held at the Blaises Club.

In the meantime, Cavaliere began dating high school student Adrienne Bechurri. Their relationship inspired him to write several songs in 1967, including Top 20 &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Lonely Too Long&quot; and Top 10&#x27;s &quot;How Can I Be Sure&quot;, and &quot;Groovin&#x27;&quot;, their second #1. &quot;Groovin&#x27;&quot;, having its laid-back sound and an Afro-Cuban groove, found some resistance with Atlantic&#x27;s head Jerry Wexler; &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Lonely Too Long&quot; and the jazz-influenced &quot;A Girl Like You&quot; talked about the advantages of a relationship against loneliness, but the introspective &quot;How Can I Be Sure&quot;, with Brigati&#x27;s lead vocals, expressed the doubts about love, like Cavaliere&#x27;s conflicting feelings about Bechurri. All these songs were included at the &quot;Groovin&#x27;&quot; album, which had the majority of the tracks penned by Cavaliere/Brigati. Bruce Eder, writing for AllMusic, rates &quot;Groovin&#x27;&quot; as the Rascals&#x27; best, noting the record&#x27;s soulful core and innovative use of jazz and Latin instrumental arrangements.

&quot;Groovin&quot;&#x27; marked the first time that the Young Rascals used outside musicians, bringing some important collaborators like Chuck Rainey, Hubert Laws, and David Brigati to augment their sound. Particularly, David Brigati also helped his brother&#x27;s band in arranging vocal harmonies and singing background on many Rascals records. The band, especially Cavaliere, wanted to depart from their &quot;singles act&quot; label to be more like an &quot;albums act&quot;, something that would become common to more artists at the late 1960s. The album &quot;Once Upon a Dream&quot;, released at 1968, is an example of this change, because it was the first Rascals album designed from conception as an album, rather than as a vehicle to package their singles (eight of &quot;Groovin&quot;&quot;s eleven songs had been released as single A or B sides, most in advance of the album). &quot;Once Upon a Dream&quot; also incorporated Indian music in its sound, adding Eastern instruments like sitar, tamboura, and tabla. David Brigati made a special appearance on the album, singing lead on the title track. The psychedelic &quot;It&#x27;s Wonderful&quot; was released before the album, but its different style, in comparison with their earlier singles, hindered its sales and the single only reached the #20. The album&#x27;s song &quot;My Hawaii&quot; became a top of the charts hit in Hawaii.

The band billed themselves as the Young Rascals for the last time with the single release of &quot;It&#x27;s Wonderful&quot;; from that point on they were known as simply &#x27;The Rascals&#x27;. Their first official single release as &quot;the Rascals&quot; was the optimistic 1968&#x27;s &quot;A Beautiful Morning&quot;, which reached #3. Internationally, the band was exceptionally popular in Canada where &quot;A Girl Like You&quot;, &quot;How Can I Be Sure?&quot; and &quot;A Beautiful Morning&quot; all reached #1. But they struggled in the UK, where they only twice reached the top 75, with &quot;Groovin&#x27;&quot; (#8) and &quot;A Girl Like You&quot; (#35).

&quot;Time Peace: The Rascals&#x27; Greatest Hits&quot;, released in mid-1968, topped the U.S. album chart and became the group&#x27;s best-selling album. In the same year, &quot;People Got to Be Free&quot;, a horn-punctuated plea for racial tolerance (the band was known for refusing to tour on segregated bills) just months after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and of Robert F. Kennedy, became their third and final U.S. #1 single, and their sixth and final Canadian #1. It was also their final U.S. Top Ten hit, although they remained a Canadian top 10 act for the next few years.

In 1969, the Rascals released the double album &quot;Freedom Suite&quot;. An album with one LP dedicated to &quot;conventional&quot; songs and another to instrumentals, it should have been the band&#x27;s definitive change to produce more ambitious albums, according to Richie Unterberger. But &quot;Freedom Suite&quot; was their last Top 40 album, peaking at #17. Brigati&#x27;s songwriting contributions were diminished on this album, in favor of Cavaliere&#x27;s solo compositions, as well his vocals, singing lead only on two songs on &quot;Freedom Suite&quot;. Brigati&#x27;s participation declined even more in later albums.

=== Commercial waning and demise (1969–1972) ===
&quot;A Ray of Hope&quot;, &quot;Heaven&quot;, &quot;See&quot;, and &quot;Carry Me Back&quot; followed and were all modest U.S. hits for the band during late 1968 and 1969; they entered the top 40, but none rose higher than #24. In Canada, however, the Rascals were still major stars; all these songs went top ten, completing a run of 11 straight Canadian top ten hits for the Rascals from 1967 to 1969. December 1969&#x27;s &quot;Hold On&quot; broke the run of top 40 US singles for the Rascals, stalling at #51, as well as the run of Canadian top tens, peaking at #22.

Brigati left the group in 1970, followed by Cornish in 1971. Their last Rascals album was &quot;Search and Nearness&quot; (#198 U.S.), which featured Brigati&#x27;s lead vocals on the Cornish-penned &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know&quot;, a cover of the Box Tops&#x27; hit &quot;The Letter&quot;, and drummer Danelli&#x27;s composition &quot;Fortunes&quot;. The only single release from the album to chart was the spiritually themed &quot;Glory, Glory&quot; (#58 U.S., #40 Canada), with backing vocals by The Sweet Inspirations. &quot;Search and Nearness&quot; was the Rascals&#x27; last album for Atlantic Records, with Cavaliere and Danelli taking the band to Columbia Records in mid-1971.

Cavaliere shifted towards more jazz- and gospel-influenced writing for the Rascals&#x27; next two albums, the double disc &quot;Peaceful World&quot; (U.S. #122) and &quot;The Island Of Real&quot; (U.S. #180), using Robert Popwell and Buzzy Feiten on bass and guitar respectively, and new singers Annie Sutton and Molly Holt. These albums did not sell as well as their earlier work, with none of their associated singles reaching higher than #95 on the U.S. chart. Towards the end of 1970 Danny Weis joined as a replacement for Feiten on guitar. Feiten then again replaced Weis before the group disbanded.

==Post break-up==
Cavaliere released several solo albums during the 1970s. Brigati, with his brother David, released &quot;Lost in the Wilderness&quot; in 1976. Cornish and Danelli worked together in Bulldog, who released two albums—one for MCA Records in 1973 with the minor hit single &quot;No&quot;, the second for Buddah in &#x27;74—and Fotomaker, who released three albums on Atlantic in 1978–79. In 1982, Danelli joined Steve Van Zandt in Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul for the group&#x27;s first two albums.

After appearing at Atlantic Records 40th anniversary celebration on May 14, 1988, the Rascals reunited with Cavaliere, Cornish, and Danelli for a brief reunion tour in 1988. The reunion group featured an expanded lineup including Mel Owens (in Brigati&#x27;s place) on vocals and percussion, Steve Mackey on bass, Ed Mattey on guitar, Dena Iverson and Cindy McCabe on backup vocals, and a horn section from Nashville to beef up the sound. The reunion did not last beyond the end of the year. After that, Cavaliere returned to his solo career, and in the 1990s there were two factions touring: The New Rascals (featuring Cornish and Danelli) and Cavaliere, who sometimes called his grouping Felix Cavaliere&#x27;s Rascals. The New Rascals lasted only a short time but toured again in 2006 with two new members, Bill Pascali (formerly of Vanilla Fudge) on vocals and keyboards and Charlie Souza on bass and vocals. The New Rascals released a concert DVD, shot at club Centro in New Jersey on Route 35.

The Rascals were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on May 6, 1997. Steve Van Zandt gave the induction speech and presented the award. All four original members appeared together to perform &quot;Good Lovin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Groovin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;How Can I Be Sure?&quot;, and &quot;People Got to Be Free&quot;. In early 2009, Eddie Brigati put together a project of young musicians who played all the classics. He performed with the group along with his brother David. Called The Boys From The Music House, the band consisted of Anthony Duke Claus, a cousin of Eddie&#x27;s on lead vocals and tambourine; Joseph Pomarico on lead guitar, harmonica and background vocals; Adam Sullivan on piano, organ, and background vocals; and Matt Gazzano on drums.

== Reunions and Danelli&#x27;s death (2012–present) ==
On April 24, 2010, all four members of The Rascals reunited for the Kristen Ann Carr benefit, which was held at Tribeca Grill in Manhattan; Bruce Springsteen and Stevie Van Zandt joined the band for a closing &quot;Good Lovin&#x27;&quot;.

The group&#x27;s original lineup reunited in 2012 for their first public performances since 1988 (other than one-off reunions in 1997 and 2010) with &quot;The Rascals: Once Upon a Dream&quot;, a combination concert/theatrical event that was produced and directed by Steven Van Zandt and Maureen Van Zandt with lighting/projection by Marc Brickman. In addition to the concert experience, the history of The Rascals, and the history of the 1960s through their music, the production features a combination of interviews with the four Rascals, filmed scenes of actors enacting key moments in the band&#x27;s history, news footage, and archival footage of the band. The show originally ran for six performances in December 2012 at the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, New York.

The show had fifteen performances from April 15 to May 5, 2013, at the Richard Rodgers Theatre on Broadway in New York City. Near the end of the show&#x27;s Broadway run, it was announced that &quot;Once Upon a Dream&quot; would be taken on the road, with performances scheduled in various cities on the East coast of North America for a six-month tour during May–November 2013. After its national tour, the show was expected to return to Broadway for a second three-week limited-run from December 2013 through January 2014, at the Marquis Theatre, but it was canceled. Later in 2014, Cavaliere returned to performing as &quot;Felix Cavaliere&#x27;s Rascals&quot; with The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful as their opening act. Both Cavaliere&#x27;s Rascals and The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful served as opening acts for a concert by The Beach Boys in Jones Beach on Long Island on July 5, 2014. In 2018, Cornish collapsed and suffered cardiac arrest while performing in Billings, Montana. After recovering in 2020, he published the memoir &quot;Good Lovin&#x27;: My Life as a Rascal&quot;.

In October 2022, in an interview with Rock Cellar Magazine, Cornish announced that he would be reuniting with Cavaliere later that month (and into 2023) for the &quot;Time Peace Tour&quot; (though Cornish was unable to perform at the tour&#x27;s first show). Interviewer Frank Mastropolo expressed surprise that the two were reuniting again, to which Cornish commented that the group had never expected to reunite in 2012 and 2013 (after the original lineup first split in 1972). 

Cornish also revealed that he and Cavaliere wanted the &quot;Once Upon a Dream&quot; reunion to continue in late 2013 and into 2014. Corninsh said that Danelli &quot;had a lot of demands that we couldn&#x27;t meet&quot; and &quot;was coming up with excuses,&quot; while &quot;Eddie [Brigati] didn&#x27;t want to do it any more &quot;[sic]&quot;.&quot; With regards to their upcoming reunion, Cornish said that &quot;Dino [Danelli] is incapable of playing drums anymore [and] is in a long-term facility... Eddie turned us down again.&quot; Danelli died from coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure on December 15, 2022, at a rehabilitation facility in Manhattan, after a period of declining health. He was 78. In 2023 and 2024, Cavaliere and Cornish have continued to perform together as the Rascals (sometimes credited as &quot;the Rascals featuring Felix Cavaliere and Gene Cornish&quot;). Their 2024 dates were billed as the &quot;People Got To Be Free Tour 2024;&quot; at least some 2024 dates again featured the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful as an opening act, similarly to Cavaliere&#x27;s tour with them in 2014.

==Legacy==
The Rascals were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on May 6, 1997. Steve Van Zandt gave the induction speech and presented the award. All four original members appeared together to perform &quot;Good Lovin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Groovin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;How Can I Be Sure?&quot;, and &quot;People Got to Be Free&quot;. In 2005, the Rascals were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. In August 2007, the Rascals&#x27; catalog of Atlantic Records albums was re-released by Atlantic Records affiliate Rhino Records.

On June 18, 2009, Eddie Brigati and Felix Cavaliere were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. The ceremony was held at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York City, where a brief reunion took place with the founder of The Rascals, Billy (Amato) Smith. &quot;Groovin&#x27;&quot; has been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

<text>The Cult are an English rock band formed in Bradford in 1983. Before settling on their current name in January 1984, the band had performed under the name Death Cult, which was an evolution of the name of lead vocalist Ian Astbury&#x27;s previous band Southern Death Cult. They gained a dedicated following in the United Kingdom in the mid-1980s as a post-punk and gothic rock band, with singles such as &quot;She Sells Sanctuary&quot;, before breaking into the mainstream in the United States in the late 1980s establishing themselves as a hard rock band with singles such as &quot;Love Removal Machine&quot;. Since its initial formation in 1983, the band have had various line-ups: the longest-serving members are Astbury and guitarist Billy Duffy, who are also their two main songwriters.

The Cult&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Dreamtime&quot; was released in 1984 to moderate success, with its lead single &quot;Spiritwalker&quot; reaching No. 1 on the UK Indie Chart. Their second studio album, &quot;Love&quot; (1985), was also successful, charting at No. 4 in the UK and including singles such as &quot;She Sells Sanctuary&quot; and &quot;Rain&quot;. The band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Electric&quot; (1987), launched them to new heights of success, also peaking at No. 4 in the UK and charting highly in other territories, and spawned the hit singles &quot;Love Removal Machine&quot;, &quot;Lil&#x27; Devil&quot; and &quot;Wild Flower&quot;. On that album, the Cult supplemented their post-punk sound with hard rock; the polish on this new sound was facilitated by producer Rick Rubin. After moving to Los Angeles, where the band have been based for the remainder of their career, the Cult continued the musical experimentation of &quot;Electric&quot; with its follow-up studio album &quot;Sonic Temple&quot; (1989), which marked their first collaboration with Bob Rock, who would produce several of the band&#x27;s subsequent studio albums. &quot;Sonic Temple&quot; was their most successful studio album to that point, entering the Top 10 on the UK and US charts, and included one of the band&#x27;s most popular songs &quot;Fire Woman&quot;.

By the time of their fifth studio album &quot;Ceremony&quot; (1991), tensions and creative differences began to surface between the band members. This resulted in the recording sessions for &quot;Ceremony&quot; being held without a stable line-up, leaving Astbury and Duffy as the only two official members, and featuring support from session musicians on bass guitar and drums. The ongoing tension had carried over within the next few years, during which one more studio album, &quot;The Cult&quot; (1994), was recorded. After their first breakup in 1995, the Cult reformed in 1999 and released their seventh studio album &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot; two years later. The commercial failure of the album and resurfaced tensions led to the band&#x27;s second dissolution in 2002. The Cult reunited once again in 2006, and have since released four more studio albums: &quot;Born into This&quot; (2007), &quot;Choice of Weapon&quot; (2012), &quot;Hidden City&quot; (2016) and &quot;Under the Midnight Sun&quot; (2022).

==History==
===Early history (1981–1984)===

The band&#x27;s origins can be traced to 1981, in Bradford, Yorkshire, where lead vocalist and songwriter Ian Astbury formed a band called Southern Death Cult. The name was chosen with a double meaning. It was derived from the academic term &quot;Southern Death Cult&quot;, used to describe a cluster of 14th-century Native American groups now classified as the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. The name Southern Death Cult also inspired by what the band viewed was the centralisation of political and economic power in Southern England (including the power of the music industry); there has long been a perceived notion of a UK North–South divide based on social, historic and economic reasons. Astbury was joined by guitarist Buzz Burrows, bassist Barry Jepson and drummer Aki Nawaz Qureshi; they performed their first show at the Queen&#x27;s Hall in their hometown of Bradford on 29 October 1981. The band were at the forefront of an emerging style of music, in the form of post-punk and gothic rock, they achieved critical acclaim from the press and music fans.

The band signed to independent record label Situation Two, an offshoot of Beggars Banquet Records, and released a three-track, triple A-side single, &quot;Moya&quot;, in 1982. They toured through England headlining some shows and touring with Bauhaus and Theatre of Hate. The band played their final performance in Manchester during February 1983, meaning after only 16 months the band was over. A compilation album named &quot;The Southern Death Cult&quot; was released, this being a collection of the single, radio sessions with John Peel for Radio One and live performances – one of which an audience member recorded with a tape recorder.

In April 1983, Astbury teamed up with guitarist Billy Duffy and formed the band &quot;Death Cult&quot;. Duffy had been in the Nosebleeds (along with Morrissey, later of the Smiths), Lonesome No More and then Theatre of Hate. In addition to Astbury and Duffy, the band also included bassist Jamie Stewart and drummer Raymond Taylor Smith (later known as Ray Mondo), both from the Harrow, London based post-punk band, Ritual. Death Cult made their live debut in Oslo, Norway on 25 July 1983 and also released the &quot;Death Cult&quot; EP in the same month, then toured through mainland Europe. In September 1983, Mondo was deported to his home country of Sierra Leone and replaced by Nigel Preston, formerly of Theatre of Hate. The single &quot;Gods Zoo&quot; was released in October 1983. Another European tour, with UK dates, followed that autumn. To tone down their name&#x27;s gothic connotations and gain broader appeal, the band changed its name to &quot;the Cult&quot; in January 1984 before appearing on the Channel 4 television show, &quot;The Tube&quot;.

The Cult&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Dreamtime&quot;, was recorded at Rockfield Studios, in Monmouth, Wales in 1984. The record was to be produced by Joe Julian, but after recording the drum tracks, the band decided to replace him with John Brand. Brand produced the record, but guitarist Duffy has said the drum tracks were produced by Julian, as Preston had become unreliable.

The band recorded the songs which later became known as &quot;Butterflies&quot;, &quot;(The) Gimmick&quot;, &quot;A Flower in the Desert&quot;, &quot;Horse Nation&quot;, &quot;Spiritwalker&quot;, &quot;Bad Medicine (Waltz)&quot;, &quot;Dreamtime&quot;, &quot;With Love&quot; (later known as &quot;Ship of Fools&quot;, and also &quot;Sea and Sky&quot;), &quot;Bone Bag&quot;, &quot;Too Young&quot;, &quot;83rd Dream&quot;, and one untitled outtake. It is unknown what the outtake was, or whether it was developed into a song at a later date. Songs like &quot;Horse Nation&quot; showed Astbury&#x27;s intense interest in Native American issues, with the lyrics to &quot;Horse Nation&quot;, &quot;See them prancing, they come neighing, to a horse nation&quot;, taken almost verbatim from the book &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; (1970), while &quot;Spiritwalker&quot; dealt with shamanism, and the record&#x27;s title and title track are overtly influenced by Australian Aboriginal beliefs.

On 4 April 1984, the Cult released the single &quot;Spiritwalker&quot;, which reached No. 1 on the independent charts in the UK, and acted as a teaser for their forthcoming studio album &quot;Dreamtime&quot;. This was followed that summer by a second single, &quot;Go West (Crazy Spinning Circles)&quot;, before the release of &quot;Dreamtime&quot; in September; the album reached No. 21 in the UK, and sold over 100,000 copies in the UK alone. On 12 July 1984, the band recorded five songs at the BBC Maida Vale 5 studio for a Richard Skinner session. Before and after the album&#x27;s release, the Cult toured throughout Europe and England before recording another single, &quot;Ressurection Joe&quot; (UK No. 74), released that December. Following a Christmas support slot with Big Country, the Cult toured Europe with support from the Mission (then-called the Sisterhood). &quot;Dreamtime&quot; was released initially only in the UK, but after its success, and as the Cult&#x27;s popularity grew worldwide, it was issued in approximately 30 countries.

===Mainstream success (1985–1990)===
In May 1985, the Cult released their fourth single, &quot;She Sells Sanctuary&quot;, which peaked at No. 15 in the UK and spent 23 weeks in the Top 100. The song was recently voted No. 18 in VH1&#x27;s Indie 100. In June 1985, following his increasingly erratic behaviour, Preston was fired from the band. Big Country&#x27;s drummer Mark Brzezicki was picked to replace Preston, and was also included in the music video for &quot;She Sells Sanctuary&quot;. The Cult then finished recording their second studio album, &quot;Love&quot;, in July and August 1985. The band&#x27;s music and image shifted from their punk-oriented roots to 1960s psychedelia influences. &quot;Love&quot; was a chart success, peaking at No. 4 in the UK and selling 100,000 copies there toward a total of 500,000 copies throughout Europe, as well as 100,000 in Australia and 500,000 copies in the United States. &quot;Love&quot; reached number 20 on the charts in the Netherlands, where it remained for 32 weeks. To date, the record has sold over two and a half million copies worldwide.

From late September 1985 to June 1986, the band went on a worldwide tour with new drummer Les Warner (who had played with Julian Lennon and Johnny Thunders). Two more singles from the &quot;Love&quot; album followed; &quot;Rain&quot; (charting in the UK at No. 17) and &quot;Revolution&quot; (charting in the UK at No. 30). Neither charted in the US. Another single, &quot;Nirvana&quot;, was issued only in Poland. The album version of &quot;Rain&quot;, as well as the remix &quot;(Here Comes the) Rain&quot;, were used in the Italian horror film &quot;Demons 2&quot; (1986). Once back in England, the band booked themselves into the Manor Studios in Oxfordshire, with producer Steve Brown (who had produced &quot;Love&quot;), and recorded over a dozen new songs. The band were unhappy with the sound of their new studio album, titled &quot;Peace&quot;, and they decided to go to New York so producer Rick Rubin could remix the first single, &quot;Love Removal Machine&quot;.

Rubin agreed to work with the band, but only if they re-recorded the song. Rubin eventually talked them into re-recording the entire album. The band&#x27;s record company, Beggars Banquet, was displeased with this, as two months and £250,000 had already been spent on the record. However, after hearing the initial New York recording, Beggars Banquet agreed to proceed. The first single, &quot;Love Removal Machine&quot;, was released in February 1987, and the new version of the album appeared in April that year, now renamed as &quot;Electric&quot;, reaching No. 4 and eventually outselling &quot;Love&quot;. The band toured with Kid Chaos (also known as &quot;Haggis&quot; and &quot;The Kid&quot;) on bass guitar, with Stewart on rhythm guitar. Two more singles, &quot;Lil Devil&quot; and &quot;Wild Flower&quot;, were released during 1987. A few tracks from the original &quot;Peace&quot; album appeared on the single versions of &quot;Love Removal Machine&quot;, and &quot;Lil Devil&quot;. The full &quot;Peace&quot; album would not be released until 2000, when it was included as Disc 3 of the &quot;Rare Cult&quot; box set.

In the US, the Cult, now consisting of Astbury, Duffy, Stewart, Warner and Kid Chaos, were supported by a then-unknown Guns N&#x27; Roses. The band also appeared at Roskilde Festival in Denmark in June 1987. During the Australian part of the world tour, the band wrecked £30,000 worth of equipment, and as a result they could not tour Japan as no company would rent them new equipment. At the end of the tour the &quot;Electric&quot; album had been certified Gold in the UK, and sold roughly 3 million copies worldwide, but the band were barely speaking to each other by then. Haggis left the band at the end of the &quot;Electric&quot; tour to form the Four Horsemen for Rubin&#x27;s Def American label. Astbury and Duffy fired Warner and their management team Grant/Edwards, and moved to Los Angeles with Stewart. Warner sued the band several times for his firing, as well as for what he considered were unpaid royalties for his performance on the &quot;Electric&quot; album, resulting in lengthy court battles. The Cult signed a new management deal and wrote 21 new songs for their next album.

For the next studio album, Stewart returned to playing bass guitar, and John Webster was brought in to play keyboards. The band used Chris Taylor to play drums during rehearsals and record the demos, with future Kiss drummer Eric Singer performing during the second demo recording sessions. The Cult eventually recruited session drummer Mickey Curry to fill the drumming role and Aerosmith sound engineer, Bob Rock, to produce. Recorded in Vancouver from October to December 1988, and released in April of the following year, &quot;Sonic Temple&quot; went Top 10 in both the UK and the US, where it was certified Gold and Platinum respectively. The band went on tour in support of the new album and new single &quot;Fire Woman&quot; (UK No. 15) (NZ No. 1), with yet another new drummer, Matt Sorum, and Webster as keyboardist. The next single, &quot;Edie (Ciao Baby)&quot; (UK No. 25) has become a regular song at concerts for many years.

In Europe, the band toured with Aerosmith, and in the US, after releasing another single &quot;Sun King&quot; (UK No. 42), they spent 1989 touring in support of Metallica before heading out on their own headlining tour later that same year. A fourth single, &quot;Sweet Soul Sister&quot; (UK No. 38), was released in February 1990, with the video having been filmed at Wembley Arena, London, on 25 November 1989. &quot;Sweet Soul Sister&quot; was partially written in Paris and was inspired by the bohemian lifestyle of that city. Released as a single in February 1990, the song was another hit in the UK, and reportedly reached number one on the rock charts in Brazil. After playing a show in Atlanta in February 1990, the band&#x27;s management told Astbury that his father had just died of cancer; as a result, the remainder of the tour was cancelled after a final leg of shows were performed in April. After the tour ended, the band were on the verge of breaking-up due to Stewart retiring and moving to Canada to be with his wife, and Sorum leaving to join Guns N&#x27; Roses.

In 1990, Astbury organised the Gathering of the Tribes festival in Los Angeles and San Francisco with artists such as Soundgarden, Ice-T, Indigo Girls, Queen Latifah, Iggy Pop, the Charlatans, the Cramps and Public Enemy appearing. This two-day festival drew 40,000 people. Also in 1990, a ten CD box set was released in the UK, containing rare songs from the Cult&#x27;s singles. The CDs in this box set were all issued as picture discs with rice paper covers, housed in a white box called &quot;Singles Collection&quot;, or a black box called &quot;E.P. Collection &#x27;84 - &#x27;90&quot;. In 1991, director Oliver Stone offered Astbury the role of Jim Morrison in Stone&#x27;s film &quot;The Doors&quot;. He declined the role because he was not happy with the way Morrison was represented in the film, and the role was ultimately played by Val Kilmer.

===&quot;Ceremony&quot; and the lawsuit (1991–1993)===
In 1991, Astbury and Duffy were writing again for their next studio album. During the demo recordings, Todd Hoffman and James Kottak played bass guitar and drums, respectively. During the actual album recording sessions, Curry was recruited again to play drums, with Charley Drayton on bass guitar, and various other performers. Astbury and Duffy&#x27;s working relationship had disintegrated by that time, with the two men reportedly rarely even being in the studio together during recording. The resulting studio album &quot;Ceremony&quot; was released to mixed responses. The album climbed to US No. 34, but sales were not as impressive as the previous three studio albums, only selling around one million copies worldwide. Only two official singles were released from the record: &quot;Wild Hearted Son&quot; (UK No. 34, Canada No. 41) and &quot;Heart of Soul&quot; (UK No. 50), although &quot;White&quot; was released as a single only in Canada, &quot;Sweet Salvation&quot; was released as a single (as &quot;Dulce Salvación&quot;) in Argentina in 1992, and the title track &quot;Ceremony&quot; was released in Spain.

The Cult&#x27;s Ceremonial Stomp tour went through Europe in 1991 and North America in 1992. In 1991 the Cult played a show at the Marquee Club in London, which was recorded and released in February 1993, packaged with some vinyl UK copies of their first greatest hits release. Only a handful of CD copies of it were ever manufactured originally, however it was subsequently reissued on CD in 1999. An incomplete bootleg video of this show is also in circulation.

The band were sued by the parents of the Native American boy pictured on the cover of &quot;Ceremony&quot;, for alleged exploitation and for the unauthorised use of the child&#x27;s image. The parents stated that the boy felt he had been cursed by the band&#x27;s burning of his image, and was &quot;emotionally scarred.&quot; This image of the boy is also burned in the video for &quot;Wild Hearted Son&quot;. This lawsuit delayed the release of &quot;Ceremony&quot; in many countries including South Korea and Thailand, which did not see the record&#x27;s release until late 1992, and it was unreleased in Turkey until the Cult played several shows in Istanbul in June 1993.

A world tour followed with backing from drummer Michael Lee (Page &amp; Plant, Little Angels), bassist Kinley &quot;Barney&quot; Wolfe (Lord Tracy, Black Oak Arkansas), and keyboardist John Sinclair (Ozzy Osbourne, Uriah Heep) returning one last time, and the Gathering of the Tribes moved to the UK. Here artists such as Pearl Jam performed. The warm-up gig to the show, in a small nightclub, was dedicated to the memory of Nigel Preston, who had died a few weeks earlier at the age of 28. Following the release of the single &quot;The Witch&quot; (#9 in Australia) and the performance of a song for the 1992 &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; movie soundtrack entitled &quot;Zap City&quot;, produced by Steve Brown and originally a B-side to &quot;Lil&#x27; Devil&quot;, two volumes of remixes of &quot;She Sells Sanctuary&quot;, called &quot;Sanctuary Mixes MCMXCIII, volumes one and two&quot;, and in support of &quot;Pure Cult: for Rockers, Ravers, Lovers, and Sinners&quot;, a greatest hits compilation which debuted at No. 1 on the British charts and later went to number one in Portugal, Astbury and Duffy fired the &quot;backing band&quot; and recruited Craig Adams (the Mission) and Scott Garrett for performances across Europe in 1993, with some shows featuring Mike Dimkich on rhythm guitar. This tour marked the first time the band performed in Turkey, Greece, and the Slovak Republic.

===&quot;The Cult&quot; and first break-up (1994–1998)===
With the same line-up still in place, the band released &quot;The Cult&quot; in October 1994, produced by Bob Rock. Astbury referred to the record as a collection of &quot;very personal and very revealing&quot; songs about his life, with the subject matter ranging from sexual abuse at the age of 15, to the death of Nigel Preston, to his directionless years spent in Glasgow in the late 1970s.

The record achieved little success, only reaching No. 69 in the US and No. 21 in the UK. Duffy remarked that he thought that the record wouldn&#x27;t sell well due to the offensive lyrics. The record went to number one in Portugal also, but quickly dropped out of sight. The single &quot;Coming Down (Drug Tongue)&quot; was released with the band going on tour in support of the new album. Only one more single, &quot;Star&quot;, was officially released with a live appearance on UK TV show &quot;The Word&quot;. &quot;Star&quot; began life in 1986 as &quot;Tom Petty&quot; and was recorded at the &quot;Sonic Temple&quot; demo sessions as &quot;Starchild&quot;, being dropped by the band during rehearsals. In 1993, the song was resurrected and was finally completed for the record in 1994 as, just simply, &quot;Star&quot;.

When the band began the Beauty&#x27;s On the Streets tour in winter 1994, they augmented the line-up with James Stevenson on rhythm guitar. As with the &quot;Ceremony&quot; record several years earlier, no other official singles were released, but several other songs were released on a strictly limited basis: &quot;Sacred Life&quot; was released in Spain and the Netherlands, &quot;Be Free&quot; was issued in Canada and France, &quot;Saints Are Down&quot; was issued in Greece, but none of the songs gained much commercial success. During this tour, the Cult made their first ever appearance in Norway.

During the &quot;Black Rain&quot; tour of South America in spring of 1995, despite the fact that several more new songs had already been recorded, the tour was cancelled after an appearance in Rio de Janeiro in March, and the band broke up citing unspecified problems on a recent South American tour. Astbury started up a garage band called Holy Barbarians a few months later. The band made their debut at the 100 Club in London in February 1996 and released their first (and only) studio album in May 1996, and toured throughout North America and Europe for the rest of 1996. The band started writing material for a second studio album in 1997, but the band was dissolved and Astbury began writing and recording a solo album. Throughout 1997 and 1998 Astbury recorded his debut solo studio album, originally to be titled &quot;Natural Born Guerilla&quot;, later called &quot;High Time Amplifier&quot;. Ultimately the album remained unreleased until June 2000 when it was released under the name &quot;Spirit\Light\Speed&quot;. Astbury played one solo concert in 1999.

In November 1996, a number of CD reissues were released: the band&#x27;s American record company released &quot;High Octane Cult&quot;, a slightly updated greatest hits compilation released only in the US and Japan; &quot;The Southern Death Cult&quot;, a remastered edition of the fifteen-song compilation CD; a ten-song compilation CD by Death Cult called &quot;Ghost Dance&quot;, consisting of the untitled four-song EP, the single &quot;God&#x27;s Zoo&quot;, and four unreleased songs from a radio broadcast; and a remastered repackaging of the &quot;Dreamtime&quot; album, containing only the ten original songs from the record in their original playing order and almost completely different but original artwork. &quot;Dreamtime Live at the Lyceum&quot; was also remastered and issued on video and for the first time on CD, with the one unreleased song from the concert, &quot;Gimmick&quot;.

===First reunion, &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot; and second hiatus (1999–2005)===

In 1999, Astbury and Duffy reformed the Cult with former drummer Matt Sorum and ex-Porno for Pyros bassist Martyn LeNoble. Their first official concert was at the Tibetan Freedom Concert in June 1999, after having rehearsed at shows in the Los Angeles area. The band&#x27;s 1999 &quot;Cult Rising&quot; reunion tour resulted in a sold out 30 date tour of the US, ending with 8 consecutive sold out nights at the LA House of Blues. In 2000, the band toured South Africa for the first time, and North and South America, and contributed the song &quot;Painted on My Heart&quot; to the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot;. The song was featured prominently and the melody was fused into parts of the score. In June, Astbury&#x27;s long-delayed debut solo studio album was finally released as &quot;Spirit\Light\Speed&quot;, but it failed to gain much success. In November 2000, another authorised greatest hits compilation was released, &quot;Pure Cult: The Singles 1984–1995&quot;, along with an accompanying DVD, which was later certified gold in Canada. The Cult, as well as Ian Astbury, performed on separate tracks on the Doors tribute album, &quot;Stoned Immaculate: The Music of The Doors&quot;, covering &quot;Wild Child&quot; and &quot;Touch Me&quot;.

In November 2000, Beggars Banquet released 15,000 copies of a six-disc box set (with a bonus seventh disc of remixes for the first 5000 copies) titled &quot;Rare Cult&quot;. The box set consists of album out-takes, demos, radio broadcasts, and album B-sides. It is most notable for including the previously unreleased &quot;Peace&quot; album in its entirety. In 2001, the band signed to Atlantic Records and recorded a new studio album, &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;, originally being produced by Mick Jones of Foreigner, until Jones bowed out to tour with Foreigner. Astbury and Duffy co-wrote a song with Jones, an odd occurrence, as in the past, neither Astbury or Duffy would co-write their material. Bob Rock was the producer, with LeNoble and Chris Wyse as recording bassists, as Mike Dimkich played rhythm guitar on tour, and Sorum returning as drummer. Although Sorum has previously toured with the band on the &quot;Sonic Temple&quot; tour in 1989, this was the first time that he had recorded a studio album with the band.

However &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot; was not the comeback record the band had hoped for. Despite reaching No. 37 in the US, No. 22 in Canada, and No. 25 in Spain, sales quickly dropped, only selling roughly 500,000 copies worldwide. The first single &quot;Rise&quot;, reached No. 41 in the US, and No. 2 on the mainstream rock charts, but Atlantic Records quickly pulled the song from radio playlists. Astbury would later describe the experience with Atlantic to be &quot;soul destroying&quot;, after Atlantic tried to tamper with the lyrics, the record cover, and choice of singles from the record.

After the first single from the record, the band&#x27;s working relationship with Atlantic was on paper only, with Atlantic pulling &quot;Rise&quot; from the radio stations playlists, and stopping all promotion of the record. The second single &quot;Breathe&quot; was only released as a radio station promo, and the final single &quot;True Believers&quot; was only on a compilation sampler disc released in January 2002 (after the Cult&#x27;s tour had already ended). Despite &quot;True Believers&quot; receiving radio airplay in Australia, both singles went largely unnoticed, and both Astbury and Duffy walked away from the project. LeNoble rejoined the band for the initial dates in early 2001, and Billy Morrison filled in on bass guitar for the majority of the 2001 tour.

The European tour of 2001 was cancelled, largely due to security concerns after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the band flew back to the US to tour again with Aerosmith. But the eleven-week tour was considered by fans to be a disaster, as the band played only a brief rundown of their greatest hits. In October 2001, a show at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles was filmed for release on DVD. After the tour ended in December 2001, the band took most of 2002 off, apart from a few shows in the US to promote the release of the DVD, with Scott Garrett and Craig Adams rejoining the band.

Despite the commercial disappointment of &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot; and the supporting tour, the band was voted &quot;Comeback of the Year&quot; by &quot;Metal Edge&quot; readers in the magazine&#x27;s 2001 Readers&#x27; Choice Awards.

In late 2002, Ian Astbury declared the Cult to be &quot;on ice&quot; indefinitely, after performing a brief series of dates in October 2002 to promote the release of the &quot;Music Without Fear&quot; DVD. During this second hiatus, Astbury performed as a member of the Doors (later dubbed the Doors of the 21st Century, later still renamed D21c, and most recently known as Riders on the Storm) with two of the original members of that group. D21c was sued numerous times, both by Jim Morrison&#x27;s family and by drummer John Densmore. Astbury supposedly started work on recording another solo studio album that later became the backbone for the Cult&#x27;s &quot;Born into This&quot; (2007).

At the same time, Duffy was part of Coloursound with bassist Craig Adams and ex-Alarm frontman Mike Peters, then Dead Men Walking (again with Peters) and later Cardboard Vampyres. Sorum became a member of the hard rock supergroup Velvet Revolver. In 2003, all of the Cult&#x27;s records were issued on CD, with several bonus tracks being issued on the Russian, Belarusian, and Lithuanian versions. These eastern European releases had many printing mistakes on the jacket sleeves and lyric inserts. In October 2004, all of the Cult&#x27;s records were again remastered and issued again on CD, this time in Japan in different cardboard foldout sleeves. &quot;She Sells Sanctuary&quot; appeared in the 2001 video game &quot;Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec&quot;, in the NTSC-U version and 2002 videogame &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;, playing on rock station V-Rock.

===Second reunion, &quot;Born into This&quot; and &quot;Capsule&quot; EPs (2006–2010)===

Despite Astbury&#x27;s previous statement from 2004 that a reunion would not happen, The Cult announced in January 2006 that they were reuniting for &quot;some limited gigs&quot; throughout the year. A month later, the band made their first live appearance in three-and-a-half years on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;. Their line-up consisted of Astbury (lead vocals), Duffy (lead guitar), John Tempesta (drums), Dimkich (rhythm guitar) and Wyse (returning as bassist). Their first stage show was held in March 2006 in San Francisco, California, at The Fillmore. The entire tour was recorded by Instant Live and sold after each show. In May, they did an eight date tour in Canada. Later that summer, they toured central and eastern Europe and played their first concerts in Bulgaria, Poland and Serbia. An eleven-date UK tour followed as well as several more dates in the United States, finishing with a South American tour in December. That year, Duffy began the band Circus Diablo with Billy Morrison, Sorum, Brett Scallions and Ricky Warwick.

During these tours, the band occasionally played an extended set, including several songs the band had not performed in decades: &quot;King Contrary Man&quot; and &quot;Hollow Man&quot;, neither of which had been performed since 1987; also, &quot;Libertine&quot; was performed approximately three times, for the first time since 2000, and &quot;Brother Wolf, Sister Moon&quot;, which was only performed one time since 1986 (for this particular song, the band played an abridged version which has never been performed before or since).

Astbury announced in February 2007 that he was leaving Riders on the Storm and returning to the Cult. He stated: &quot;I have decided to move on and focus on my own music and legacy.&quot; The Cult was featured on Stuffmagazine.com&#x27;s list of ultimate air guitar players. On 21 March 2007, it was announced that the band would be touring Europe with the Who. The first confirmed tour date was in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, in early June, with at least a dozen shows set to follow. The band played a gig in London&#x27;s West End at the CC Club on 7 June 2007, along with nearly two dozen shows across continental Europe during summer. The tour also includes the first performance in Romania and Croatia.

On 29 May 2007, the band signed a deal with major metal label Roadrunner Records. Their eight studio album, titled &quot;Born into This&quot; was released on 16 October, and was produced by Martin &quot;Youth&quot; Glover, bassist for Killing Joke. &quot;Born into This&quot; was released as regular single disc and limited edition double disc, the second disk being a bonus 5-track CD holding the following tracks: &quot;Stand Alone&quot;, &quot;War Pony Destroyer&quot;, &quot;I Assassin (Demo)&quot;, &quot;Sound of Destruction (Demo)&quot; and &quot;Savages (Extended Version)&quot;. Prior to the album&#x27;s release, the band played festival and headline dates, and supported the Who in Europe through summer 2007, with a US headline tour to follow.

The band&#x27;s appearance at Irving Plaza in New York City in early November 2006 was filmed and was released in 2007. &quot;The Cult New York City&quot;, issued by Fontana North and is the Cult&#x27;s first high definition DVD release. Meanwhile, Astbury lent vocals on two tracks of the 2007 Unkle studio album &quot;War Stories&quot;, one of them being the first single from the album, &quot;Burn My Shadow&quot;.

The band performed a UK and European tour in late-February and early-March 2008. On 24 March, they began their North American tour including a major 13-city tour in Canada. During September 2008, the Cult did a brief series of dates in the northeast United States, and they toured in Brazil as part of the South American tour in October 2008. As of May 2008, according to &quot;The Gauntlet&quot;, the Cult are currently unsigned and no longer under contract with Roadrunner Records. In October 2008, it was announced that the Cult would headline the inaugural Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Marathon in San Antonio, to be run 16 November 2008. The Cult announced plans for a tour showcasing their 1985 &quot;Love&quot; album across the US and then the UK in October where they will play at the Royal Albert Hall.

Coinciding with the remastered &quot;Love&quot; album and four-disc &quot;Omnibus&quot; boxed set, the Cult kicked off the long-awaited &quot;Love Live Tour&quot; in late summer. Performing their classic &quot;Love&quot; album in its entirety, each show was played with the &quot;Love&quot; tracks opening with &quot;Nirvana&quot; to &quot;Black Angel&quot;. A quick intermission followed, then other Cult hits were played (varying by venue): &quot;Sun King&quot;, &quot;Dirty Little Rock Star&quot;, &quot;Electric Ocean&quot;, &quot;Illuminated&quot;. Then followed the favourites &quot;Fire Woman&quot;, &quot;Lil Devil&quot;, &quot;Wild Flower&quot;, and lastly &quot;Love Removal Machine&quot;. In the evening of 10 October 2009 at the Royal Albert Hall in London, the band performed a second encore with original Cult bassist Jamie Stewart and drummer Mark Brzezicki, who played drums with the band during the &quot;Love&quot; album recording sessions in July and August 1985. The band sold &quot;Love Live&quot; USB flash drives for each show during the tour.

The Cult continued their &quot;Love Live Tour&quot; and played dates in the United States, New Zealand, Australia, and Japan during 2010. The band finished recording a four-track &quot;Capsule&quot; with producer Chris Goss. &quot;Capsule 1&quot; was said to be the first of three or four to be released sometime in summer 2010. Release formats include CD-DVD DualDisc, 12-inch vinyl, and digital downloads. &quot;Capsule 1&quot; was released on 14 September 2010. The band officially announced the release of its first new studio recording since 2007, &quot;Every Man and Woman Is a Star&quot;. The new single was released through the iTunes Store on 31 July 2010.

On 1 August 2010, the band played the sold-out music festival Sonisphere, which marked their first UK performance since the tour for their &quot;Love&quot; album. During the performance they debuted their new single, &quot;Every Man and Woman is a Star&quot;, which was released on 1 August 2010. On 14 September 2010 the band embarked on a new US tour and released &quot;Capsule 1&quot; in conjunction with media technology company Aderra Inc. and made it available in multiple formats including a CD-DVD DualDisc, USB flash drive, 12 inch vinyl, FLAC download and MP3 download. The collection includes a short film made by Ian Astbury and Rick Rogers.

On 26 October 2010 the band and Aderra Inc. announced the release of a new song, &quot;Embers&quot;, for 1 November 2010 and &quot;Capsule 2&quot; available through their web store on 16 November 2010. Pictures from the Cult&#x27;s tour stop in Chicago on 28 October 2010 can be seen at a local radio station website.

On 17 September 2010, the band performed live at the Fall Frenzy concert at the Tempe Beach Park in Tempe, Arizona. Other bands that played at this concert were Stone Temple Pilots, Shinedown, and Sevendust.

On 4 December 2010, the band performed a live set for &quot;Guitar Center Sessions&quot; on DirecTV. The episode included an interview with the band by program host, Nic Harcourt.

===&quot;Choice of Weapon&quot; and &quot;Hidden City&quot; (2011–2017)===

During the Cult&#x27;s concert at the Hammersmith Apollo in London on 21 January 2011 Ian Astbury declared that the Cult would be recording a new studio album directly after the tour. They also announced that they would be working with Chris Goss, who performed with Masters of Reality as an opening act the same evening. On 11 May 2011, it was announced that the Cult were signed to Cooking Vinyl Records, who would release the new studio album in early 2012. Commented guitarist Billy Duffy: &quot;We are very much looking forward to returning to our U.K. roots in many ways working with Cooking Vinyl.&quot; Lead vocalist Ian Astbury added, &quot;We look forward to a long and fruitful relationship with Cooking Vinyl.&quot; By May 2011, the band had been writing and recording new demos at its Witch Mountain studio hideaway in the Hollywood Hills, and began recording their new album at Hollywood Recording Studios. In October 2011, bassist Chris Wyse stated the album was almost finished and expected to be released in April 2012. Wyse also described it as a &quot;Zep/Stooges mix of energy.&quot;

On 29 November 2011, it was announced that the album would be produced by Bob Rock, who provided the same role on &quot;Sonic Temple&quot;, &quot;The Cult&quot; and &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;. The studio album, entitled &quot;Choice of Weapon&quot;, was released on 22 May 2012. The band partnered with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; to premiere the first song from the album titled &quot;Lucifer&quot; on 30 January. On 5 February 2012, the Cult song &quot;She Sells Sanctuary&quot; was used as the soundtrack for a Budweiser beer commercial in a mashup with Flo Rida aired during Super Bowl XLVI. In May 2012 the Cult appeared on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; and played &quot;For the Animals&quot;.

On 28 September 2012, it was announced that the band would release &quot;Weapon of Choice&quot;, a &quot;prequel&quot; album to accompany the band&#x27;s latest studio album, &quot;Choice of Weapon&quot;. The digital-only release, available exclusively on iTunes for two months only beginning 16 October, features the songs that were ultimately included in &quot;Choice of Weapon&quot; at an earlier stage of development. Explaining the motivations behind the release, lead vocalist Ian Astbury said that &quot;These songs were turned over and over, forged in long rehearsals and writing sessions, and emanated from challenges both personal and professional. We put our guts into this; [Producer Chris] Goss was able to create an environment where the songs were born through playing and turning over lyrics, through hard work and intense sessions.&quot; Astbury added &quot;These songs have an integrity and rawness of their own. In many ways it&#x27;s a different album to the one we released and reveals the foundations of &#x27;Choice Of Weapon&#x27;. We were able to close the doors and begin to explore spaces we had not been in for a while.&quot; The song &quot;Twisted and Bleeding&quot; was made available for free download at the band&#x27;s website ahead of the full digital release.

On 20 June 2013, the band announced the release of &quot;Electric-Peace&quot; which comprises the entire &quot;Electric&quot; album plus the &quot;Peace&quot; album which was previously released on the now discontinued &quot;Rare Cult&quot; box set in 2000. It was released in the US on 30 July. In 2013 Mike Dimkich left the band and joined Bad Religion to replace guitarist Greg Hetson. James Stevenson, from the &quot;Beauty&#x27;s on the Streets&quot; tour in 1994, replaced Dimkich as the Cult&#x27;s rhythm guitarist.

In March 2013, Billy Duffy told the Argentine journalist Fabrizio Pedrotti that the Cult had begun work on a new studio album for a 2014 release. The band were expected to begin work on the album after they finish their 2013 world tour, where they played the &quot;Electric&quot; album in its entirety. In August 2014, Duffy added that the next album, which was not expected to be released before 2015 at the earliest, would &quot;be more guitar heavy&quot;.

On 5 November 2015, it was announced that the Cult would release their new studio album, entitled &quot;Hidden City&quot;, on 5 February 2016. The album is said to be the final part of a trilogy that began with &quot;Born into This&quot;, and marks the fifth time Bob Rock had produced a Cult album. The band also announced that they had hired Australian-born bassist Grant Fitzpatrick (ex-Mink) as the replacement for Chris Wyse. Chris Chaney (Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Camp Freddy) and producer Bob Rock performed session bass on the album. In support of &quot;Hidden City&quot;, the Cult opened for Guns N&#x27; Roses on the Not in This Lifetime... Tour.

In an October 2016 interview with &quot;PopMatters&quot; journalist J.C. Maçek III, Cult guitarist Billy Duffy spoke of the band&#x27;s playlist while on tour, saying &quot;Obviously you want to make an impactful [show],&quot; he continues. &quot;There are some practical, pragmatic decisions made. If you&#x27;re playing to a crowd who are not very familiar with you, there&#x27;s no point of going too deep but we do always make sure we play a new song. Like on Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; [tour] we had fifty minutes which is ten songs all in. So, you know we just made sure that in those ten songs we played &#x27;Deeply Ordered Chaos&#x27; which we’re proud of and it makes a certain statement. And it just alerts people to the fact that, yes, we have made a record in the last 30 years. You know and that&#x27;s a good thing. Psychologically, that&#x27;s the blood transfusion that we need. And we&#x27;re very mindful, we have a very loyal fan base. We don&#x27;t pander as you well know.&quot;

===&quot;Under the Midnight Sun&quot;, reunion of Death Cult and future material (2018–present)===
In an April 2018 interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot;, guitarist Billy Duffy was asked if another studio album by the Cult was in the works. He replied, &quot;Never say never! Ian and I enjoy the process of making new music, and we feel it&#x27;s vital to keep the band healthy, even if it&#x27;s pretty much in the law of diminishing returns area now. Who knows if it will be a whole album a series of singles or an EP? I can say new Cult music will be forthcoming, but these days we don&#x27;t rush it as there&#x27;s no point. Quality is key. We are past the point of having to release stuff so if we feel it&#x27;s good enough, then we will release it in some shape or another.&quot;

On 2 April 2018, a tour of the United States of America called &quot;Revolution 3 Tour&quot; was announced for the summer. They performed as one of the three headliners, along with Stone Temple Pilots and Bush.

In April 2019, the Cult announced that they would celebrate the 30th anniversary of the release of their fourth studio album &quot;Sonic Temple&quot; with a world tour, which began on 2 May in Houston, Texas and was expected to wrap up in 2020.

In a June 2019 interview with &quot;LA Weekly&quot;, lead vocalist Ian Astbury stated that the Cult were &quot;long overdue&quot; to release new music. He was quoted as saying: &quot;We do have some stuff we&#x27;ve been working on, but it&#x27;s yet to see the light of day.&quot; Six months later, Astbury told &quot;Atlantic City Weekly&quot; that the band was going to start working on new music in 2020: &quot;We&#x27;ve got a few pieces lying around in various stages of completion. The intention is to get together in the New Year and take a look at what we&#x27;ve got and decide how we are going to go about moving forward. It&#x27;s an essential part of any creative lifeblood.&quot; On 6 May 2020, the Cult announced on their Twitter page that they had signed to Black Hill Records.

On 15 August 2020, Duffy announced on his Twitter that the band were recording their eleventh studio album with producer Tom Dalgety at Rockfield Studios, where the Cult had recorded their debut studio album &quot;Dreamtime&quot; 36 years earlier. Progress was slow for nearly two years, hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the album being recorded remotely, with the half of the band tracking it at Rockfield Studios and Astbury in the United States. In May 2022, Duffy told &quot;The Yorkshire Post&quot; that the &quot;main bulk&quot; of the album was finished and mastered. On 7 July 2022 the band announced &quot;Under the Midnight Sun&quot; as the title of their album, released on 7 October, and &quot;Give Me Mercy&quot; was released its first single.

Prior to the release of the album, the Cult embarked on a co-headlining six-date UK tour with Alice Cooper and Creeper in May and June 2022, and in the following month, they toured in North America with Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and Zola Jesus.

On 14 August 2023, Astbury and Duffy announced a twelve-date tour of the UK, along with a single US date in Los Angeles, under the title &quot;Death Cult 8323&quot;. Whilst concentrating on the Death Cult material, the shows also covered Southern Death Cult and The Cult&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Dreamtime&quot; and &quot;Love&quot;.

On 5 October 2023, &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot; reported that The Cult were working on new material for a possible 2024 release. Astbury confirmed in February 2025 that new music from the band is in the works, but expressed uncertainty about releasing another studio album as The Cult: &quot;Albums are dead, pretty much albums are finished. Albums are dead, the concept of making an album, I like the idea of making — if you have a piece of music and it&#x27;s fresh, put it out.&quot;

==Influences==
Duffy and Astbury cited among their influences a lot of different bands &quot;from the Doors to Led Zeppelin. We literally went from the front of our record collections to the back. And then along the way we were drawn in by the likes of Public Image Ltd, Joy Division and Siouxsie and the Banshees. You might not hear it in the music but it&#x27;s there.&quot; They also cited Bauhaus among many other post-punk influences. Duffy also praised Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers for a major performance he attended in 1977 and Siouxsie and the Banshees who &quot;always had great guitar players with killer riffs.&quot; Duffy also hailed AC/DC for &quot;the power of a good three chord riff&quot;, Pete Townshend of the Who &quot;in terms of commitment to stage performing&quot; and Brian May of Queen for using &quot;&#x27;echoplex&#x27; tape delays to orchestrate his own solo&quot;.

==Musical style==
AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated The Cult &quot;formed as a goth band&quot; and later became &quot;a stadium-filling hard rock act led by the shamanistic Ian Astbury.&quot; American vocal coach Ken Tamplin adds &quot;the band&#x27;s early sound was heavily influenced by punk rock and post-punk, with their debut album &quot;Dreamtime&quot; released in 1984.&quot; The Cult&#x27;s music evolved over the years, incorporating alternative rock, arena rock, heavy metal and psychedelia with guitar solos and tribal rhythms. In 1985, Astbury said, &quot;Our music is just melodies and guitars. We&#x27;re like Big Country and U2, only better!&quot;

<text>The Aztec or Mexica calendar is the calendrical system used by the Aztecs as well as other Pre-Columbian peoples of central Mexico. It is one of the Mesoamerican calendars, sharing the basic structure of calendars from throughout the region.

The Aztec sun stone, often erroneously called the calendar stone, is on display at the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City.
The actual Aztec calendar consists of a 365-day calendar cycle called (year count), and a 260-day ritual cycle called (day count). These two cycles together form a 52-year &quot;century&quot;, sometimes called the &quot;calendar round&quot;. The is considered to be the agricultural calendar, since it is based on the sun, and the is considered to be the sacred calendar.

==Tōnalpōhualli==
The (&quot;day count&quot;) consists of a cycle of 260 days, each day signified by a combination of a number from 1 to 13, and one of the twenty day signs. With each new day, both the number and day sign would be incremented: 1. Crocodile is followed by 2. Wind, 3. House, 4. Lizard, and so forth up to 13. Reed. After Reed, the cycle of numbers would restart (though the twenty day signs had not yet been exhausted), resulting in 1. Jaguar, 2. Eagle, and so on, as the days immediately following 13. Reed. This cycle of number and day signs would continue similarly until the 20th week, which would start on 1. Rabbit, and end on 13. Flower. It would take a full 260 days (13×20) for the two cycles (of twenty day signs, and thirteen numbers) to realign and repeat the sequence back to 1. Crocodile.

===Day signs===
The set of day signs used in central Mexico is identical to that used by Mixtecs, and to a lesser degree similar to those of other Mesoamerican calendars. Each of the day signs bear an association with one of the four cardinal directions.

There is some variation in the way the day signs were drawn or carved. Those here were taken from the .
Wind and Rain are represented by images of their associated gods, and respectively.

Other marks on the stone showed the current world, and the worlds before this one. Each world was called a sun, and each sun had its own species of inhabitants. The Aztecs believed that they were in the Fifth Sun, and like all of the suns before them, they would also eventually perish due to their own imperfections. Every 52 years was marked out due to the belief that 52 years was a life cycle and at the end of any given life cycle, the gods could take all they had, and destroy the world.
The 260 days of the sacred calendar were grouped into twenty periods of 13 days each. Scholars usually refer to these thirteen-day &quot;weeks&quot; as , using a Spanish term derived from &quot;thirteen&quot; (just as the Spanish term &quot;dozen&quot; is derived from &quot;twelve&quot;). The original Nahuatl term was &quot;in cencalli tonalli&quot; (a family of days), according to Book IV of the &quot;Florentine Codex&quot;.

Each is named according to the calendar date of the first day of the 13 days in that . In addition, each of the twenty in the 260-day cycle had its own tutelary deity:


 is the Aztec year () count (). One year consists of 360 named days and 5 nameless (). These &#x27;extra&#x27; days are thought to be unlucky. The year was broken into 18 periods of twenty days each, sometimes compared to the Julian month. The Nahuatl word for moon is but whatever name was used for these periods is unknown. Through Spanish usage, the 20-day period of the Aztec calendar has become commonly known as a .

Each 20-day period started on (Crocodile) for which a festival was held. The eighteen are listed below. The dates are from early eyewitnesses; each wrote what they saw. &#x27;s date precedes the observations of by several decades and is before recent to the surrender. Both are shown to emphasize the fact that the beginning of the Native new year became non-uniform as a result of an absence of the unifying force of after the Mexica defeat.

===&quot;Veintenas&quot; of the &quot;xiuhpōhualli&quot;===
== Xiuhmolpilli ==
The ancient &quot;Mexicans&quot; counted their years by means of four signs combined with thirteen numbers, thus obtaining periods of 52 years, which are commonly known as &quot;Xiuhmolpilli&quot;, a popular but incorrect generic name; the most correct Nahuatl word for this cycle is Xiuhnelpilli. The table with the current years:
==Reconstruction of the Solar calendar==
For many centuries scholars had tried to reconstruct the Calendar. A widely accepted version was proposed by Professor of the , based on the studies of and of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. His correlation argues that the first day of the Mexica year was February 13 of the old Julian calendar or February 23 of the current Gregorian calendar.
Using the same count, it has been the date of the birth of , the end of the year and a cycle or &quot;Tie of the Years&quot;, and the New Fire Ceremony, day-sign of the year , corresponding to the date February 22. A correlation by independent researcher Ruben Ochoa interprets pre-Columbian codices, to reconstruct the calendar, while ignoring most primary colonial sources that contradict this idea, using a method that proposes to connect the year count to the vernal equinox and placing the first day of the year on the first day after the equinox. 

In this regard, José Genaro Emiliano Medina Ramos, a senior native nahua philosopher from San Lucas Atzala in the state of Puebla, proposes a multidisciplinary calendar reconstruction in náhuatl (‘centro de Puebla’ variant) according with his own nahua cosmosvision; and relying precisely on Ochoa&#x27;s smart correlation and on Tena&#x27;s presuppositions as well. His proposal was translated to Spanish and English, and codified as an academic webpage in 2023.

<doc id="151736" wikidata="Q1699264" url="?curid=151736" title="John Barbour (poet)">
<text>John Barbour (c.1320 – 13 March 1395) was a Scottish poet and the first major named literary figure to write in Scots. His principal surviving work is the historical verse romance, &quot;The Brus&quot; (&quot;The Bruce&quot;), and his reputation from this poem is such that other long works in Scots which survive from the period are sometimes thought to be by him. He is known to have written a number of other works, but other titles definitely ascribed to his authorship, such as &quot;The Stewartis Oryginalle&quot; (&quot;Genealogy of the Stewarts&quot;) and &quot;The Brut&quot; (&quot;Brutus&quot;), are now lost.

Barbour was latterly Archdeacon of the Diocese of Aberdeen in Scotland. He also studied in Oxford and Paris. Although he was a man of the church, his surviving writing is strongly secular in both tone and themes. His principal patron was Robert II and evidence of his promotion and movements before Robert Stewart came to power as king tend to suggest that Barbour acted politically on the future king&#x27;s behalf.

He died in 1395, probably in Aberdeen.

==Life==
John Barbour may have been born around 1320 if the record of his age in 1375 as 55 is correct. His birthplace is not known, though Aberdeenshire and Galloway have made rival claims.

Barbour&#x27;s first appearance in the historical record comes in 1356 with promotion to the archdeaconry of Aberdeen from a post he had held for less than a year in Dunkeld Cathedral. It is inferred from this that he was also present in Avignon in 1355. In 1357, when David II returned to Scotland from exile and was restored to active kingship, Barbour received a letter of safe-conduct to travel through England to the University of Oxford. He subsequently appears to have left the country in other years coincidental with periods when David II was active king.

After the death of David II in 1371, Barbour served in the royal court of Robert II in a number of capacities. It was during this time that he composed, &quot;The Brus&quot;, receiving for this in 1377 the gift of ten pounds Scots, and in 1378 a life-pension of twenty shillings. He held various posts in the king&#x27;s household. In 1372 he was one of the auditors of exchequer and in 1373 a clerk of audit.

The only biographical evidence for his closing years is his signature as a witness to sundry deeds in the &quot;Register of Aberdeen&quot; in 1392. According to the obit-book of St Machar&#x27;s Cathedral, Aberdeen he died on 13 March 1395 and state records show that his life-pension was not paid after that date. Barbour made provision for a mass to be sung for himself and his parents, an instruction that was observed in the Cathedral of St Machar until the Reformation.

==Works==

===&quot;The Brus&quot;===

&quot;The Brus&quot;, Barbour&#x27;s major surviving work, is a long narrative poem written while he was a member of the king&#x27;s household in the 1370s. Its subject is the ultimate success of the prosecution of the First War of Scottish Independence. Its principal focus is Robert the Bruce and Sir James Douglas, but the second half of the poem also features actions of Robert II&#x27;s Stewart forebears in the conflict.

Barbour&#x27;s purpose in the poem was partly historical and partly patriotic. He celebrates The Bruce (Robert I) and Douglas throughout as the flowers of Scottish chivalry. The poem opens with a description of the state of Scotland at the death of Alexander III (1286) and concludes (more or less) with the death of Douglas and the burial of the Bruce&#x27;s heart (1332). Its central episode is the Battle of Bannockburn.

Patriotic as the sentiment is, this is expressed in more general terms than is found in later Scottish literature. In the poem, Robert I&#x27;s character is a hero of the chivalric type common in contemporary romance, Freedom is a &quot;noble thing&quot; to be sought and won at all costs, and the opponents of such freedom are shown in the dark colours which history and poetic propriety require, but there is none of the complacency of the merely provincial habit of mind.

Barbour&#x27;s style in the poem is vigorous, his line generally fluid and quick, and there are passages of high merit. The most quoted part is Book 1, lines 225-228:

===&quot;Stewartis Oryginalle&quot;===
One of Barbour&#x27;s known lost works is &quot;The Stewartis Oryginalle&quot; which is described as having traced the genealogy of the Stewarts. The Stewart name replaced that of Bruce in the Scottish royal line when Robert II acceded to the throne after the death of David II, his uncle.

Robert II was Barbour&#x27;s royal patron. It is not known how the work came to be lost.

===&quot;Buik of Alexander&quot;===
Attempts have been made to name Barbour as the author of the &quot;Buik of Alexander&quot;, a Scots translation of the &quot;Roman d&#x27;Alexandre&quot; and other associated pieces. This translation borrows much from &quot;The Brus&quot;. It survives and is known to us from the unique edition printed in Edinburgh, c. 1580, by Alexander Arbuthnot.

===&quot;Legends of the Saints&quot;===
Another possible work was added to Barbour&#x27;s canon with the discovery in the library of the University of Cambridge, by Henry Bradshaw, of a long Scots poem of over 33,000 lines, dealing with &quot;Legends of the Saints&quot;, as told in the &quot;Legenda Aurea&quot; and other legendaries. The general likeness of this poem to Barbour&#x27;s accepted work in verse-length, dialect and style, and the facts that the lives of English saints are excluded and those of St. Machar (the patron saint of Aberdeen) and St. Ninian are inserted, make this ascription plausible. Later criticism, though divided, has tended in the contrary direction, and has based its strongest negative judgement on the consideration of rhymes, assonance and vocabulary.

==Legacy==
As &quot;father&quot; of Scots poetry, Barbour holds a place in the Scotland&#x27;s literary tradition similar to the position often given to Chaucer, his slightly later contemporary, &quot;vis à vis&quot; the vernacular tradition in England. If he truly was the author of the five or six long works in Scots which different witnesses ascribe to him, then he would have been one of the most voluminous writers of Early Scots, if not the most voluminous of all Scots poets. But his authorship of &quot;The Brus&quot; alone, both for its original employment of the chivalric genre, and as a tale of a struggle against tyranny, secures his place as an important and innovative literary voice who broke new linguistic ground.

<text>Dr Alexander Barclay (c. 1476 – 10 June 1552) was a poet and clergyman of the Church of England, probably born in Scotland.

==Biography==
Barclay was born in about 1476. His place of birth is matter of dispute, but William Bulleyn, who was a native of Ely, and probably knew him when he was in the monastery there, asserts that he was born &quot;beyonde the cold river of Twede&quot; (&quot;River Tweed&quot;, i.e. in Scotland). His early life was spent at Croydon, but it is not certain whether he was educated at Oxford or Cambridge. It may be presumed that he took his degree, as he uses the title of &quot;Syr&quot; in his translation of Sallust&#x27;s &quot;Bellum Jugurthinum&quot;, and in his will he is called Doctor of Divinity.

From the numerous incidental references in his works, and from his knowledge of European literature, it may be inferred that he spent some time abroad. Thomas Cornish, suffragan bishop in the diocese of Bath and Wells, and provost of Oriel College, Oxford, from 1493 to 1507, appointed him chaplain of the college of Ottery St Mary, Devon. Here he wrote his satirical poem, &quot;The Ship of Fools&quot;, partly a translation from Sebastian Brant.

The death of his patron in 1513 apparently put an end to his connection with the west, and he became a monk in the Benedictine monastery of Ely. In this retreat he probably wrote his eclogues. He left Ely to join the Franciscan order. In 1520 &quot;Maistre Barkleye, the Blacke Monke and Poete&quot; was desired to devise &quot;histoires and convenient raisons to florisshe the buildings and banquet house withal&quot; at the meeting between Henry VIII and Francis I at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. He at length became a Franciscan friar of Canterbury.

It is presumed that he conformed with the change of religion, for he retained under Edward VI the livings of Great Baddow, Essex, and of Wokey, Somerset, which he had received in 1546, and was presented in 1552 by the dean and chapter of Canterbury to the rectory of All Hallows, Lombard Street, London. He died shortly after this last preferment at Croydon, Surrey, where he was buried on 10 June 1552.

==Works==
&quot;The Ship of Fools&quot; (1509) was as popular in its English dress as it had been in Germany. It was the starting-point of a new satirical literature. In itself a product of the medieval conception of the fool who figured so largely in the Shrovetide and other pageants, it differs entirely from the general allegorical satires of the preceding centuries. The figures are no longer abstractions; they are concrete examples of the folly of the bibliophile who collects books but learns nothing from them, of the evil judge who takes bribes to favour the guilty, of the old fool whom time merely strengthens in his folly, of those who are eager to follow the fashions, of the priests who spend their time in church telling &quot;gestes&quot; of Robin Hood and so forth. Thus, the work is of interest as throwing light on the manners and customs of the times to which it refers.

Barclay wrote the &quot;Life of St George&quot; (c. 1515) for Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk with a dedication to Nicholas West. He translated the &quot;Mirrour of Good Manners&quot; (c. 1518), from the Italian of Dominic Mancini. This work was written at the command of Sir Giles Alington.

Most of Barclay&#x27;s works were made in collaboration with the printer Richard Pynson. He wrote five &quot;Eclogues&quot;, part printed by Wynkyn de Worde around 1518, and printed in full in John Cawood&#x27;s 1570 edition. The sources of the &quot;Eclogues&quot; include works by Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini, Baptista Mantuanus, and Jean Lemaire de Belges. The &quot;Eclogues&quot; include laments for John Alcock, John Morton, and Roger Westminster, Prior of Ely.

<doc id="151743" wikidata="Q353" url="?curid=151743" title="Blanche of Castile">
<text>Blanche of Castile (; ; 4 March 1188 – 27 November 1252) was Queen of France by marriage to Louis VIII. She acted as regent twice during the reign of her son, Louis IX: during his minority from 1226 until 1234, and during his absence from 1248 until 1252.

==Early life==
Blanche was born in Palencia, Spain, in 1188, the third daughter of Alfonso VIII, King of Castile, and Eleanor of England, sister of King Richard I of England and King John of England. In her youth, she visited the Abbey of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas, founded by her parents, several times. In consequence of the Treaty of Le Goulet between Philip Augustus and John of England, Blanche&#x27;s sister, Urraca, was betrothed to Philip&#x27;s son, Louis. After meeting the two sisters, their grandmother Eleanor of Aquitaine (who had been a queen consort of France herself) judged that Blanche&#x27;s personality was more fit to fulfil the role. In the spring of 1200, Eleanor crossed the Pyrenees with her and brought her to France instead.

==Appearance==
Eleanor of Aquitaine judged that Urraca, Blanche&#x27;s sister, was more beautiful than Blanche, although Catherine Hanley states we have no knowledge about what Blanche looked like.

==Marriage==
Blanche was twelve years of age, and Louis was only a year older, by the time the marriage treaty was finally signed. King John ceded the fiefs of Issoudun and Graçay as a dowry. The marriage was celebrated 23 May 1200, at Port-Mort on the right bank of the Seine, in John&#x27;s domains, as those of Philip lay under an interdict. Blanche bore her first child in 1205.

During the English barons&#x27; rebellion of 1215–16 against King John, it was Blanche&#x27;s English ancestry as granddaughter to Henry II that led to Louis being offered the throne of England as Louis I. However, with the death of John in October 1216, the barons changed their allegiance to John&#x27;s son, the nine-year-old Henry.

Louis continued to claim the English crown in her right, only to find a united nation against him. Philip Augustus refused to help his son, and Blanche was his sole support. Blanche raised money from her father-in-law by threatening to put up her children as hostages. She established herself at Calais and organized two fleets, one of which was commanded by Eustace the Monk, and an army under Robert of Courtenay. With French forces defeated at Lincoln in May 1217 and then routed on their way back to their London stronghold, Louis desperately needed the reinforcements from France. On 24 August, the English fleet destroyed the French fleet carrying those reinforcements off Sandwich and Louis was forced to sue for peace. 

==Regency==
Philip died in July 1223, and Louis VIII and Blanche were crowned on 6 August. Upon Louis&#x27; death in November 1226 from dysentery, he left Blanche, by then 38, regent and guardian of his children. Of her twelve or thirteen children, six had died, and Louis, the heir – afterwards the sainted Louis IX – was but twelve years old. She had him crowned within a month of his father&#x27;s death in Reims and forced reluctant barons to swear allegiance to him. The situation was critical, since Louis VIII had died without having completely subdued his southern nobles. The king&#x27;s minority made the Capetian domains even more vulnerable. To gain support, she released Ferdinand, Count of Flanders, who had been in captivity since the Battle of Bouvines. She ceded land and castles to Philip I, Count of Boulogne, son of King Philip II of France and his controversial wife, Agnes of Merania.

Several key barons, led by Peter Mauclerc, refused to recognize the coronation of the young king. Shortly after the coronation, Blanche and Louis were traveling south of Paris and nearly captured. Blanche appealed to the people of Paris to protect their king. The citizens lined the roads and protected him as he returned.

Helped by Theobald IV of Champagne and the papal legate to France, Romano Bonaventura, she organized an army. Its sudden appearance brought the nobles momentarily to a halt. Twice more did Blanche have to muster an army to protect Capetian interests against rebellious nobles and Henry III of England. Blanche organized a surprise attack in the winter. In January 1229, she led her forces to attack Mauclerc and force him to recognize the king. She accompanied the army herself and helped collect wood to keep the soldiers warm. Not everyone was happy with her administration. Her enemies called her &quot;Dame Hersent&quot; (the wolf in the &quot;Roman de Renart&quot;)

In 1229, she was responsible for the Treaty of Paris, in which Raymond VII, Count of Toulouse, submitted to Louis. By the terms of the agreement, his daughter and heir, Joan, married Blanche&#x27;s son, Alphonse, and the county could only pass to his heirs. He gave up all the lands conquered by Simon de Montfort to the crown of France. It also meant the end of the Albigensian Crusade.

To prevent Henry III of England from gaining more French lands through marriage, Blanche denied him the first two brides he sought. In 1226, he sought to marry Yolande of Brittany, Mauclerc&#x27;s daughter. Blanche instead forced her father to give Yolande to Blanche&#x27;s son John. When Henry became engaged to Joan, Countess of Ponthieu, Blanche lobbied the Pope to deny the marriage based on consanguinity, denying the dispensation Henry sought.

In 1230, Henry III came to invade France. At the cost of some of the crown&#x27;s influence in Poitou, Blanche managed to keep the English Queen mother Isabella, Countess of Angoulême, and her second husband, Hugh X of Lusignan, from supporting the English side. However, Mauclerc did support the English and Brittany rebelled against the crown in 1230. Originally, the English landed in Brittany with 275 knights, men at arms, and barons to meet his ally Peter I, Duke of Brittany. The campaign began well for Henry III, who probably recruited foot soldiers on the continent as he brought 7,800 marks with him. On the other hand, Blanche&#x27;s troops were insubordinate to her and refused to serve beyond the 40 day feudal contract; most disbanded after 40 days. Philip I, Count of Boulogne, left the royal forces and proceeded to raid Champagne. Blanche had to chase Philip to try to stop him from raiding the important county, leaving Henry III to proceed without serious resistance.

Meanwhile, the Norman nobles were also in open rebellion against Blanche. However, instead of marching to help the Norman rebels, he followed the advice of his vassal, advisor, and former regent Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent, and marched into Poitou. In any case, it appears that Henry&#x27;s excursion to Aquitaine was not necessary despite the calls for help by Geoffrey Beauchamp, who probably panicked due to a slight rise in unrest in Aquitaine. Henry besieged Mirabeau and proceeded to Bordeaux, apparently &quot;securing&quot; the south while also losing massive amounts of money and being forced to take loans. What made it worse was that Aquitaine was not in any serious danger of being taken by the French because what remained of the French royal army was trying to quash a rebellion in Champagne, nowhere near Aquitaine.

Henry&#x27;s military operation was still not a complete loss. He was able to get money, military engines, and bolts for crossbows along with the militia of La Réole. Henry marched north into Poitou but the gifts which Blanche had sent to Hugh X of Lusignan, Count of La Marche, and Raymond I, Viscount of Thouars, kept them loyal to the French. Although the local lords could not see Henry off, he was either unable or unwilling to commit to a large offensive investment and decided to return to Brittany, where he spent the remainder of his money on feasts. He proceeded to England having accomplished little. He lost money and prestige even if he had not taken significant casualties. Thus the rebellion died out, which helped establish Blanche and Louis as more stable rulers. Henry&#x27;s failure to make any significant impact with his invasions ultimately discouraged Mauclerc&#x27;s rebellion, and, by 1234, he was firm in his support of Louis.

St. Louis owed his realm to his mother and remained under her influence for the duration of her life.

==Queen mother==
Louis began to take part in political affairs by declaring his maturity, but Blanche was very influential and powerful in politics and court affairs, and her son did not withhold anything from her. No one dared to criticize the Queen Mother. In 1233, Raymond of Toulouse was starting to chafe under the terms of the treaty of Paris, thus Blanche sent one of her knights, Giles of Flagy, to convince him to cooperate. Blanche heard through troubadours of the beauty, grace, and religious devotion of the daughters of Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence, and assigned Giles a second mission to visit Provence. Giles found a much better reception in Provence than in Toulouse. Upon his return to Paris, Blanche decided that a Provençal marriage would suit her son and help keep Toulouse in check. In 1234, Louis married Margaret of Provence, who was the eldest of the four daughters of Ramon, Count of Provence, and Beatrice of Savoy.

She did not have a good relationship with her daughter-in-law, perhaps due to the controlling relationship Blanche had with her son, and she wanted to maintain control of her son and the court. To maintain better control over the new queen, Blanche dismissed the family and servants who had come to her wedding before the couple reached Paris. Prior to the arrival of the new queen, Blanche was considered the beauty of the court, and had poems written about her beauty by the count of Champagne. In 1230, it was even rumoured that she was pregnant by Romano Bonaventura. The new queen drew the attention of the court and the king away from Blanche, so she sought to keep them apart as much as she could. Jean de Joinville tells of the time when Queen Margaret was giving birth and Blanche entered the room telling her son to leave saying &quot;Come ye hence, ye do naught here&quot;. Queen Margaret then allegedly fainted out of distress. Joinville also remarks that when Queen Blanche was present in the royal household, she did not like Margaret and Louis to be together &quot;except when he went to lie with her&quot;.

In 1239, Blanche insisted on a fair hearing for the Jews, who were under threat by increasing antisemitism in France. She presided over a formal disputation in the king&#x27;s court. Louis insisted on the burning of the Talmud and other Jewish books, but Blanche promised Rabbi Yechiel of Paris, who spoke for the Jews, that he and his goods were under her protection.

==Second regency and death==
In 1248, Blanche again became regent during Louis IX&#x27;s absence on the Crusade, a project which she had strongly opposed. In the disasters which followed, she maintained peace while draining the land of men and money to aid her son in the East. She fell ill at Melun in November 1252 and was taken to Paris, but lived only a few days. She was buried at Maubuisson Abbey, which she had founded herself. Louis heard of her death in the following spring and reportedly did not speak to anyone for two days afterwards.

==Patronage and learning==
Blanche was a patron of the arts and owned a variety of books, both in French and in Latin. Some of these were meant as teaching tools for her son. &quot;Le Miroir de l&#x27;Ame&quot; was dedicated to Blanche. It instructs queens to rigorously practice Christian virtues in daily life. She oversaw the education of her children, all of whom studied Latin. She also insisted on lessons in Christian morals for all of them. Both Louis and Isabelle, her only surviving daughter, were canonized.

The chanson &quot;Amours ou trop tard me suis pris&quot;, a prayer to the Virgin Mary, is often attributed to Blanche.

==Literature==
Blanche of Castile is mentioned in François Villon&#x27;s 15th century poem Ballade des Dames du Temps Jadis (&quot;Ballad of Ladies of Times Past&quot;), together with other famous women of history and mythology. Blanche&#x27;s selection as bride for Louis and travel to France is noted in Elizabeth Chadwick&#x27;s &quot;The Autumn Throne&quot; and E. L. Konigsburg&#x27;s &quot;A Proud Taste for Scarlet and Miniver&quot;.

Blanche and Isabella of Angoulême are the main characters in Jean Plaidy&#x27;s novel &quot;The Battle of the Queens,&quot; and she is briefly mentioned in Marcel Proust&#x27;s &quot;Swann&#x27;s Way&quot;, in a disaparaging way by Doctor Cottard and Brichot.

Blanche is a key character in the novel &quot;Four Sisters, All Queens&quot;, by Sherry Jones, which focuses on her daughters-in-law Margaret of Provence and Beatrice of Provence and their sisters Sancha of Provence and Eleanor of Provence. She is a supporting character in the novel &quot;The Crown Rose&quot; by Fiona Avery, based on the life of her daughter Saint Isabelle of France. Blanche is also a central antagonist in the fictional middle grade novel, &quot;The Inquisitor&#x27;s Tale&quot;, written by Adam Gidwitz.

Blanche&#x27;s betrothal is depicted in the Shakespearean history play &quot;King John&quot;.

==In popular culture==
An image of Blanche of Castile has been used on the home kit of French Rugby union team Stade Français since the 2008 season.

During the 1950s French restaurateur Noël Corbu claimed that Blanche of Castile had deposited a treasure in Rennes-le-Château that was later discovered by Bérenger Saunière during the late 19th century. This was later utilised by Pierre Plantard in his development of the Priory of Sion mythology.

<doc id="151744" wikidata="Q203286" url="?curid=151744" title="Kevin Johnson (basketball)">
<text>Kevin Maurice Johnson (born March 4, 1966) is an American former professional basketball player and politician who served as the 55th mayor of Sacramento, California from 2008 to 2016. Elected in 2008 and re-elected in 2012, Johnson is the first African American to serve as mayor of Sacramento. Before entering politics, Johnson was a professional basketball player in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

After a stint with the Cleveland Cavaliers during a portion of his rookie year, the point guard played as a member of the Phoenix Suns for the remainder of his NBA career.

During his 12-year playing career, Johnson was a three-time NBA All-Star as well as four-time second team All-NBA selection and held numerous records for the Phoenix Suns organization. At the University of California, Berkeley, Johnson was named a two-time All-Pac-10 Conference player and an honorable-mention All-American by the Associated Press.

Johnson holds a B.A. in political science from U.C. Berkeley that he completed after his initial retirement from the NBA. Since founding St. HOPE in 1989, Johnson has been active in education reform. As Mayor of Sacramento, Johnson launched two education initiatives: Stand UP and Sacramento READS!, to benefit students in Sacramento. Johnson also helped to deter the Sacramento Kings basketball team from moving to Anaheim, and, later, to Seattle, Washington.

==Early life==
Johnson, the son of Georgia West and Lawrence Johnson, was born March 4, 1966, in Sacramento. After his father died in a boating accident when he was three, Johnson was raised by his grandparents, the Peat family. He attended Sacramento High School, where he starred in both baseball and basketball. In his senior year, Johnson led the state of California in scoring (32.5 ppg) and was named the Northern California Player of the Year.

==Basketball career==

===University of California===
Johnson accepted a scholarship to play basketball for the University of California, Berkeley. As a four-year starter, Johnson ended his college career in 1987 as the school&#x27;s all-time leader in assists (since eclipsed by Jason Kidd), steals, and scoring (since eclipsed by Lamond Murray, Sean Lampley, Patrick Christopher, Joe Shipp and Jerome Randle). Johnson was named to the Pac-10&#x27;s All-Conference First Team in his junior and senior seasons, averaging 17.2 points and 5 assists in his final year. He led Cal to the program&#x27;s first post-season appearances in 26 seasons with NIT bids in 1986 and 1987 and was the first player in the Pac-10 Conference to post a triple-double. In 1992, Johnson became the first Golden Bear to have his jersey (No. 11) retired.

Johnson briefly played for Cal&#x27;s baseball team and the Oakland Athletics drafted him as a shortstop in the 23rd round of the 1986 MLB draft. After playing a couple games with Oakland&#x27;s minor-league team in Modesto, California during the summer of 1986, Johnson ended his baseball career, finding the road to professional baseball more arduous and risky compared to basketball.

===Cleveland Cavaliers===
Following his senior season of college basketball, the Cleveland Cavaliers selected Johnson with the seventh pick in the 1987 NBA draft. Originally drafted by Cleveland to challenge the incumbent point guard Mark Price for the starting spot, Johnson found himself playing limited minutes as Price&#x27;s backup during the 1987–88 NBA season.

===Phoenix Suns===
On February 28, 1988, Johnson, Mark West, Tyrone Corbin, and a future draft pick were traded to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for forward Larry Nance, Mike Sanders, and a future draft pick. Adjusting quickly to the change of scenery and much-increased playing time, Johnson excelled and the league named him the NBA Rookie of the Month for April 1988 as he averaged 15.1 points, an 86.4% free throw percentage, 10.6 assists, and 5.6 rebounds.

In his first full season with Phoenix, Johnson grew into one of the game&#x27;s elite players, averaging 20.4 points, 12.2 assists, a 50.5% field goal percentage, and an 88.2% free-throw percentage. With those numbers, Johnson joined Magic Johnson and Isiah Thomas as the only players in NBA history to average at least 20 points and 12 assists in a season. His rapid improvement earned him the 1988–89 NBA&#x27;s Most Improved Player Award. The 1988–89 season was the first of three straight seasons in which Johnson averaged at least 20 points and 10 assists, joining Oscar Robertson and Isiah Thomas as the only players in league history to accomplish that feat. It also represented the beginning of a new era for the previously moribund Suns&#x27; franchise. In K.J.&#x27;s first seven full seasons in Phoenix from 1989 to 1995, the Suns won the most regular season games in the NBA (394, an average of 56 and never fewer than 53), constituting the only club to win at least 50 every year during that span, and they won the second-most playoff games (46), trailing only the Chicago Bulls.

Johnson received berths to the NBA All-Star Team in 1990, 1991, and 1994. In the 1991 All-Star Game in Charlotte, Johnson wore number 41 instead of his familiar number 7. NBC announcers Bob Costas and Mike Fratello speculated that the decision represented K.J.&#x27;s quiet way of honoring teammate Mark West, the Suns&#x27; stoic, largely unrecognized center who thanklessly executed the dirty work on the glass and in the paint.

In the 1991 NBA All-Star Game, Johnson started alongside Magic Johnson in the Western Conference backcourt. In anticipation of the game, the &quot;Sporting News&quot; asked whether K.J. may have surpassed Magic as the best player on the court. The previous spring in the 1990 Western Conference Semifinals, Johnson led the Suns past Magic&#x27;s league-best, 63-win Los Angeles Lakers, four games to one. Over the last two games, Johnson closed out the series by averaging 33.5 points and a dozen assists as the Suns won both Game Four and Game Five, with K.J. vastly outplaying Magic Johnson in the fourth quarter of both contests. Indeed, Johnson&#x27;s clutch performances led Hall of Fame center and NBC commentator Bill Walton to later remark, &quot;Kevin Johnson ... really came to the top of this league in the 1990 playoffs when he waxed Magic Johnson and the Lakers in the early rounds. Kevin Johnson—and the Suns—taking care of business in 1990, four to one over the Lakers ... Kevin Johnson just totally outplaying Magic.&quot; Johnson&#x27;s performance during the 1990 playoffs led the Suns to a second consecutive berth in the Western Conference Finals as Phoenix became the only team to ever defeat John Stockton&#x27;s Jazz (55 wins) and Magic Johnson&#x27;s Lakers (63 wins) in the same postseason.

Johnson made the playoffs every year of his career after his rookie season, reversing the fortunes of the perennially losing Phoenix Suns. The 1992–93 Suns, led by Johnson and new teammate Charles Barkley, posted an NBA-best 62–20 record and managed to make it to the NBA Finals, where they lost to the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls four games to two. Johnson averaged 17.8 points and 7.9 assists in the playoffs and established an NBA record for Finals minutes played by logging 62 minutes in Game 3 (a 129–121 triple-OT victory) vs. the Bulls.

But even before Johnson played his first regular season game with Charles Barkley, he suffered an undiagnosed sports hernia in October 1992 when he attempted to lift heavy-set rookie teammate Oliver Miller off the ground during warmups before a preseason game. By the middle of the 1995–96 season, Johnson had suffered a second undiagnosed sports hernia. Primarily due to the groin, hamstring, quadriceps, and other muscle strains stemming from these undiagnosed hernias, Johnson missed 109 regular season games during his four seasons with Barkley from 1992–93 through 1995–96 (although he only missed one playoff game during his entire career). When diligent off-season workouts during the summer of 1996 failed to erase the abdominal and groin pain that had been plaguing Johnson since the middle of the last season, the Suns&#x27; doctors finally diagnosed the second hernia just before the start of training camp in the fall of 1996. Then, during surgery to repair the sports hernia, the Phoenix doctors discovered the second, &quot;hidden&quot; hernia that had existed for four years.

Despite the undiagnosed hernia problems, K.J. continued to thrive in the postseason.

In 1994, he averaged 26.6 points and 9.6 assists in the postseason, scoring 38 points three different times in ten games and averaging 11.0 assists in those three contests.

In 1995, after an injury-riddled regular season, Johnson returned to form in the postseason. He averaged 24.8 points on 57.3% shooting from the field and 9.3 assists in ten games, including 43 points (18–24 FG) with 9 assists, 6 rebounds, 3 steals, and just 1 turnover in Game Four of the Western Conference Semifinals at Houston and 46 points (21–22 FT) with 10 assists against only 1 turnover in Game Seven. During that series, K.J. sank more three-pointers (5) than he&#x27;d hit in the entire 1994–95 regular season (4).

In game four of the previous year&#x27;s series with Houston, Johnson completed a remarkable play, driving the baseline and dunking over Rockets&#x27; center Hakeem Olajuwon. The shot became an oft-played highlight for the ages and was part of a second consecutive 38-point, 12-assist effort by the point guard.

===International competition===
In the summer of 1994, Johnson played with the U.S. national team, otherwise known as Dream Team II, in the 1994 FIBA World Championship, reuniting with old teammate and point guard rival Mark Price to win the gold medal. Johnson led Dream Team II in both total assists (31) and assists per game (3.9), while shooting 47.1% (16–34) from the field and 50.0% (16–32) on two-point field goal attempts. The U.S. head coach, Don Nelson, stated, &quot;I really like having KJ on the court. The thing that stood out is how he sacrificed his scoring to be a distributor of the ball and make his team win. We didn&#x27;t need his offense on this team. We did need his defense, penetration and assists. He gave us all three.&quot;

===Retirement and comeback===
Johnson retired after the 1997–98 season, but returned briefly after receiving a call from his former coach and friend Cotton Fitzsimmons during the 1999–2000 season to replace the injured Jason Kidd during the playoff run. Johnson helped the Suns win their first playoff series in five years. After Phoenix lost in the second round to the Los Angeles Lakers, he retired for the second and final time.

In 2001, Johnson&#x27;s No. 7 was retired by the Suns and he was inducted into their Ring of Honor.

==The Kevin Johnson Corporation==
The Kevin Johnson Corporation includes operations of several subsidiary organizations specializing in real estate development and management, sports management, and business acquisition. A key component of The Kevin Johnson Corporation includes appearances and public speaking engagements for corporations, academic institutions, and community organizations.

==St. HOPE==
In 1989, while still an NBA player, Johnson founded St. HOPE (Helping Others Pursue Excellence) as an after-school program for kids in his native Oak Park neighborhood of Sacramento, California. St. HOPE eventually expanded to run as a nonprofit umbrella organization that consisted of three divisions: St. HOPE Academy, St. HOPE Public Schools, and St. HOPE Development Corporation. This encompassed the new vision to be a nonprofit community development corporation whose mission is to &quot;revitalize communities through public education, civic leadership, economic development, and the arts.&quot; Johnson served as CEO of St. HOPE until January 2008.

The St. HOPE Development Corporation, founded in 1994, has focused its efforts on Oak Park. The Development Corporation has enabled the renovation of a number of projects including a historic bank building that is now a local U.S. Bank branch, a Victorian house that has been converted to office space, and a 25,000 square foot art gallery and retail complex that includes the Guild Theater and 40 Acres Art Gallery.

St. HOPE Public Schools is a pre-K-through-12th-grade independent charter school system that provides education to nearly 2,000 students in seven small schools. One of the schools St. HOPE impacted was Sacramento High School (colloquially known as Sac High and now the Sacramento Charter High School), where three generations of Johnson&#x27;s family including him attended. In October 2002, Sac High was at risk of being shut down and restricted into five smaller schools due to low test scores. But by January 2003, Johnson had raised seed money from the Gates Foundation and drafted a petition to reopen Sac High as an independent charter school. On September 2, 2003 Sac High reopened as Sacramento Charter High School, a charter school with 1,450 students. Since St. HOPE&#x27;s involvement with Sac High, student performance has improved. In 2010 Sac High&#x27;s API score improved to 719, compared to 610 in 2006. The number of students who completed all courses required for University of California or California State University Admission also rose between those years from 84% to 90.6%.

These improved test scores attracted the attention of a school in New York and St. HOPE eventually expanded into Harlem at the St. HOPE Leadership Academy Charter School which opened in 2008. Since 2007, the decision to expand St. HOPE to New York has been taught as a case study in the Entrepreneurship in Education Reform class at Harvard Business School. Following presentation of the case study, Johnson discusses it over lunch with the Harvard students and faculty. The class works as a feeder program for students to participate in the Mayoral Fellowship Program in Sacramento.

==Election for Mayor&#x27;s Office of Sacramento==

On March 5, 2008, Johnson announced he would run for mayor of Sacramento, his hometown, challenging incumbent Heather Fargo. Election day was June 3, 2008. Since no candidate received a majority of the vote in the nonpartisan election, there was a runoff.

Johnson garnered the endorsement of the Sacramento Police Officers Association (SPOA), the Region Builders, the Chamber of Commerce, Realtors&#x27; Association and Labor Council, among others. Johnson was also endorsed by Sacramento City Council members Steve Cohn (Vice Mayor) and Sandy Sheedy, and by former Sacramento Mayor Jimmie Yee.

On June 4, 2008, Kevin Johnson, who led by 8 percentage points, forced a runoff election for mayor versus the two-term incumbent. 374 of 378 precincts were reported, and Johnson was ahead of Mayor Heather Fargo 47% to 40%. Five other candidates split the rest of the vote. The candidates needed more than 50% to win the election. Third place finisher Leonard Padilla endorsed Mayor Fargo on June 4, 2008. Johnson, by late May, loaned his campaign $500,000 and raised $490,000, while Fargo raised $340,000 despite having started fundraising in 2005.

===2008 primary election for mayor of Sacramento===

Johnson and Fargo had a runoff election in November, won by Johnson.

===2008 runoff election for mayor of Sacramento===
==First term==

Johnson launched nine initiatives in his first term as Mayor.

Volunteer Sacramento was launched alongside Cities of Service, a bipartisan coalition of mayors founded in 2009 to encourage public service. As one of the founding cities, Sacramento logged 1.7 million hours of service and created $22 million in economic impact in 2009. In 2010, 3 million hours of service were logged, adding a $70 million economic impact in the region. For these efforts, Sacramento was awarded a City of Service Leadership Grant.

For Arts&#x27; Sake was launched to increase interest and support of Sacramento&#x27;s local art. In response to this commitment, Sacramento was chosen by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. as the first city in the nation to pilot the &quot;Any Given Child&quot; program. The program is designed to bring equal access to arts programming for children K-8. It currently operates in Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Rivers Unified School District.

Sacramento Steps Forward is an initiative launched to end chronic homelessness in Sacramento. Johnson assumed leadership as Chair of the regional Policy Board to End Homelessness and joined the U.S. Conference of Mayors&#x27; Task Force on Hunger and Homelessness in 2009. By 2011, 2,350 households were moved into permanent housing and Sacramento was awarded approximately $6 million through the Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-housing Program.

Johnson launched the STAND UP education initiative to increase student achievement in Sacramento schools with $6 million being raised to bring education reform and innovative programming to Sacramento.

In 2010, Johnson was the founding chair of the U.S. Conference of Mayors&#x27; Public Schools Task Force and the Co-Chair of U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan&#x27;s Mayoral Advisory Council.

The Greenwise initiative was launched to diversify economic development, go green, and promote Sacramento as the &quot;Emerald Valley.&quot; Sacramento was selected by President Obama to participate in the Better Buildings Challenge which provides federal investment to achieve energy efficiency. Sacramento committed to reducing energy use 20% by 2020 in 12 million square feet of building space. The Greenwise initiative works to establish programs to achieve this commitment.

Think Big was launched to facilitate the economic development of Sacramento, including the construction of a new entertainment and sports complex. Think Big oversees progress at the downtown Railyards, an area that has been left unutilized since the 1980s and is currently one of the largest urban infill project in the country.

In 2011 Johnson launched another education initiative, Sacramento READS!, in response to the &quot;literacy crisis in Sacramento.&quot; Beginning in 2011, Sacramento READS! was designed as a 10-year initiative to ensure all children in Sacramento can read at grade level by the end of 3rd grade by focusing on school readiness, attendance, and limiting summer learning loss.

The City-Schools Collaborative was launched to better align city services with school districts to maximize resources to support public education.

The Gang Prevention Task Force was launched to form a three-year city-county partnership to reduce gang violence through school-based and job-training programs. Johnson acquired over $17 million in federal and state stimulus dollars for law enforcement and community policing.

==2012 re-election==
Johnson announced he would run for reelection for Mayor of Sacramento on September 14, 2011. Election day was June 5, 2012. Johnson was challenged by three individuals: Jonathan Michael Rewers, Leonard Padilla, and Richard Jones. Since Johnson received a majority of the vote (more than 50% of the vote), no run-off was required. Johnson raised at least $841,394 in his reelection bid and spent $500,000 of that on the race.

Johnson was endorsed by Sacramento City Council members Angelique Ashby (Vice Mayor), Steve Cohn, and Jay Schenirer. Johnson also received support from the Sacramento Police Officers Association, the Sacramento Area Firefighters Local 522, and the Sacramento Metro Chamber along with California Senate pro Tem President Darrell Steinberg, Governor Jerry Brown, and Senator Dianne Feinstein.

===2012 primary election for Mayor of Sacramento===

Johnson defeated the three other candidates with 58.74% of the votes.

==Leadership roles and accolades==
In June 2012 Johnson was elected the second vice president of the United States Conference of Mayors (USCM). He became the first Sacramento mayor to be elected to the second vice president position and became the first Sacramento mayor to serve as president, which he was set to assume in 2014. This was the second national leadership position Johnson assumed in 2012, as he was previously elected to the first vice president of the National Conference of Black Mayors, where he assumed the presidency in 2013. After becoming president of the National Conference of Black Mayors (NCBM), Johnson took steps that resulted in the dissolution of the organization.

Johnson has served on the board of directors for the University of California Alumni Association, Phoenix Suns Charities, Christian Athlete Ministries, Phoenix Symphony, the School House Foundation, Jobs for America&#x27;s Graduates (JAG), and on the advisory board for the Caring Institute.

Johnson has received numerous awards for his dedication and contributions to his community. In 1991, Former President George H. W. Bush honored Johnson with as the 411th Point of Light recipient in recognition of Johnson&#x27;s concern and compassion for children and education. In addition to being selected as one of the &quot;15 Greatest Men on Earth&quot; by &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;, Johnson has received the NBA&#x27;s J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award, the John R. Wooden Lifetime Achievement Award 2008, the Good Morning America Award from &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, the &quot;Most Caring American&quot; award by the Caring Institute, and induction into the World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame in Boise, Idaho.

==Controversies==

===Sexual assault and harassment allegations===
A teenager told Phoenix police in 1996 that Johnson had allegedly molested her in his home during the summer of 1995, when she was sixteen years old. During a phone conversation secretly recorded by detectives, Johnson apologized to the girl after she confronted him with the accusation. However, he also stated that &quot;what you&#x27;re saying happened, I&#x27;m not entirely agreeing happened.&quot; &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; stated that they had received a copy of a proposed settlement agreement, under which Johnson would have paid the girl&#x27;s family $230,000. After conducting an investigation, the Maricopa County Attorney&#x27;s Office declined to prosecute, on the grounds that there was not a reasonable likelihood of conviction. On October 8, 2015, press accounts surfaced of a 1996 police video which showed detectives saying there was a likely chance that he was abusing her and others.

===High school investigation===
On April 16, 2008, rival mayoral candidate Leonard Padilla distributed a 2007 report of similar allegations made against Johnson at St. HOPE Sacramento High School; these accusations were investigated by local police, but no charges were filed. On April 29, 2008, a group of female civic leaders that included former Sacramento Mayor Anne Rudin, Sacramento Municipal Utility District board member Genevieve Shiroma, and former State Senator Deborah Ortiz demanded the release of the police report on the matter.

The teacher to whom the student initially brought the complaint subsequently resigned over the incident, claiming, &quot;St. HOPE sought to intimidate the student through an illegal interrogation and even had the audacity to ask me to change my story.&quot; Two classmates and a school counselor confirmed the teacher&#x27;s version of events. Sacramento Police Chief Rick Braziel responded, saying, &quot;I think the allegations at the school were handled in the way that you would want them handled. Immediately they followed all the normal protocols that they were supposed to follow. I think it was pretty clear there was nothing there... We did ask the young lady whether anyone had influenced her—her answer was no.&quot; The Sacramento County Sheriff John McGinness said on May 30, 2008, that Johnson&#x27;s actions, though ill-advised, were not illegal.

===St. HOPE Academy&#x27;s misuse of AmeriCorps funds===
On April 9, 2009, Acting U.S. Attorney Lawrence G. Brown announced that St. HOPE Academy had agreed to pay $423,836.50 over ten years in settlement of allegations that it did not appropriately spend AmeriCorps grants and education awards and did not adequately document spending of grants. The settlement amount represented one half of the $847,673 in AmeriCorps funds received by St. HOPE Academy over three years from 2004 to 2007. Johnson, St. HOPE Academy&#x27;s founder and former CEO, agreed to pay $72,836.50 of St. HOPE Academy&#x27;s $73,836.50 initial payment. In settlement, St. HOPE Academy acknowledged not adequately documenting a portion of its AmeriCorps grant expenditures, and the Corporation for National and Community Service terminated its September 24, 2008 suspension of St. HOPE Academy and Johnson from receiving federal funds, ending questions about Sacramento&#x27;s eligibility to receive federal stimulus funds.

===Problems with real estate===
In 2007, &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; investigated Johnson&#x27;s real estate holdings in the Oak Park neighborhood of Sacramento and found that more than half the properties owned by Johnson and his entities had been cited for various code violations, including fire risk from overgrown vegetation, dead animals, junk and debris on the properties, as well as decaying and fire-damaged buildings. A local group, Oak Park United against Slumlords (OPUS), complained that Johnson was &quot;stopping progress&quot; in the neighborhood by refusing to develop some of its key properties.

===Pieing incident===
Johnson attended a charity event at Sacramento Charter High School on September 21, 2016, when a man approached him and hit him in the face with a pie. Johnson then allegedly assaulted his assailant, later alleging self-defense. The perpetrator, Sean Thompson, was arrested on a felony charge of assaulting a public official and misdemeanor charge of battery on school property.

==Personal life==
Johnson married Michelle Rhee, the former Chancellor of the District of Columbia School System, on September 3, 2011, in front of 40 people at Tennessee mountain resort Blackberry Farm (resort). They had originally planned to get married the year before, but decided to postpone it in the wake of a large amount of media attention to their nuptials.

<doc id="151747" wikidata="Q365620" url="?curid=151747" title="Robert I, Latin Emperor">
<text>Robert I (died 1228), also known as Robert of Courtenay, was Latin Emperor of Constantinople from 1221 until his death in 1228. He was a younger son of the emperor Peter II of Courtenay, and Yolanda of Flanders.

When it became known in France that Peter of Courtenay was dead, his eldest son, Philip, Marquis of Namur, renounced the succession to the Latin empire of Constantinople in favor of his brother Robert, who set out to take possession of his distracted inheritance. On the way to his new homeland, Robert stayed in Hungary from autumn 1220 to early 1221, enjoying the hospitality of his brother-in-law Andrew II of Hungary. It is possible that Villard de Honnecourt also belonged to his entourage. Robert and Andrew made political alliance against Theodore Komnenos Doukas, Despot of Epirus. Andrew II and his heir Béla escorted Robert until the Bulgarian border. There Robert mediated the wedding between Tsar Ivan Asen II and Andrew&#x27;s daughter, Anna Maria.

Crowned emperor on 25 March 1221, Robert&#x27;s first loss was Thessalonica in 1224 to Theodore Doukas of Epirus. Worried about the situation of the Catholic Latin Empire, pope Honorius III called for a crusade for the defense of Thessalonica, but the response was ineffective. In the same year, Robert&#x27;s empire would suffer another defeat to John Ducas Vatatzes at the Battle of Poimanenos.

Following this defeat Robert was compelled to make peace with his chief foe, John III Ducas Vatatzes, emperor of Nicaea, who was confirmed in all his conquests. Robert promised to marry Eudokia, daughter of the late emperor of Nicaea, Theodore I Lascaris and Anna Angelina. He had been betrothed to Eudokia on a former occasion; the circumstances surrounding the failed negotiations are unclear, but George Akropolites states that the arrangement was blocked on religious grounds by the Orthodox Patriarch Manuel Sarantenos: Robert&#x27;s sister Marie de Courtenay was married to Emperor Theodore I Laskaris. Accordingly, Robert, already Theodore&#x27;s brother-in-law, could not also be his son-in-law. Regardless, Robert soon repudiated this engagement, and married the Lady of Neuville, already the fiancée of a Burgundian gentleman. Heading a conspiracy, the Burgundian drove Robert from Constantinople, he fled to Rome to seek redress from the pope who convinced him to return to Constantinople, but on his return trip, in early 1228, the emperor died in Morea.

<text>Henry (c. 1178 – 11 June 1216) was Latin emperor of Constantinople from 1205 until his death in 1216. He was one of the leaders of the Fourth Crusade in which the Byzantine Empire was conquered and Latin Empire formed.

==Life==
Henry was born in Valenciennes, France around 1178. He was the son of Count Baldwin V of Hainaut and Countess Margaret I of Flanders. Henry first married (in 1204) Agnes of Montferrat, daughter of Boniface of Montferrat. Henry&#x27;s only child by his first wife Agnes died in childbirth with his mother.

Some contemporary historians say that Henry made peace with Bulgarians after the death of Kaloyan, and a marriage was arranged in 1213 between Henry and Maria, daughter of Kaloyan and stepdaughter of Tsar Boril of Bulgaria.

Henry had a daughter with an unnamed mistress. This daughter, whose name is not recorded, probably (Margaret-Isabel) later married Alexius Slav, who established his own state in the Rhodope mountains. He was later given the title of despot.

==Leadership in the Fourth Crusade==
Having joined the Fourth Crusade in about 1201, he distinguished himself at the siege of Constantinople of 1203 and elsewhere. During the July 1203 siege, Henry was one of eight division generals, the others including Boniface of Montferrat (the crusade leader), Doge Enrico Dandolo (leader of the Venetians), Louis of Blois (one of the first nobles to take the cross), and Henry&#x27;s own brother, Baldwin IX of Flanders, who controlled the largest division. During the 1204 siege, Henry led a chevauchée expedition to gain supplies and raided a castle in Philia, near the Black Sea with, according to Robert de Clari, about 30 knights and an unspecified number of mounted sergeants. An ambush was laid for him by Emperor Alexius V Ducas, but Henry and his force routed the Greeks soundly, captured a revered icon supposedly containing relics of Christ, and returned to the crusader camp. He soon became prominent among the princes of the new Latin Empire.

==In the Latin Empire==
When his elder brother, Emperor Baldwin, was captured at the Battle of Adrianople in April 1205 by the Bulgarians, Henry was chosen regent of the empire, succeeding to the throne when the news of Baldwin&#x27;s death arrived. He was crowned on 20 August 1206.

Upon Henry&#x27;s ascension as Latin emperor, the Lombard nobles of the Kingdom of Thessalonica refused to give him allegiance. A two-year war ensued and after defeating the Templar-supported Lombards, Henry confiscated the Templar castles of Ravennika and Zetouni (Lamia).

Henry was a wise ruler, whose reign was largely passed in successful struggles with Tsar Kaloyan of Bulgaria and with his rival Emperor Theodore I Lascaris of Nicaea. He later fought against Boril of Bulgaria (1207–1218) and managed to defeat him in the Battle of Philippopolis. Henry campaigned against the Nicean Empire, expanding a small holding in Asia Minor (at Pegai) with campaigns in 1207 (at Nicomedia) and in 1211–1212 (with the Battle of the Rhyndacus), where he captured important Nicean possessions at Nymphaion. Though Theodore I Laskaris could not oppose this later campaign, it appears that Henry decided it best to focus on his European problems, for he sought a truce with Theodore I in 1214, and amicably divided Latin from Nicean possessions to the favour of Nicea.

Domestically, Henry appears to have a different character than many of the other Crusader nobles as seen in his even-handed and pragmatic treatment of the Greeks. George Akropolites, the contemporary 13th-century Greek historian, notes that Henry &quot;though a Frank by birth, behaved graciously to the Romans who were natives of the city of Constantine, and ranked many of them among his magnates, others among his soldiers, while the common populace he treated as his own people.&quot; Indeed, when a Papal legate (Pelagio Galvani, Cardinal-Bishop of Albano) arrived in Constantinople in 1213 and began to imprison Orthodox clergy and to close churches on the orders of Pope Innocent III, Henry countermanded the orders on the request of the city&#x27;s Greek clergy.

Henry appears to have been brave but not cruel, and tolerant but not weak, possessing &quot;the superior courage to oppose, in a superstitious age, the pride and avarice of the clergy.&quot; The emperor died, poisoned, it is said, by Oberto II of Biandrate, ex-regent of Thessaloniki, on 11 June 1216. Gardner suggests this happened at the instigation of his wife, Maria of Bulgaria. On his death his brother-in-law Peter Courtenay was crowned emperor in Rome but never arrived in Constantinople. In the years 1217 to 1219, therefore, the Latin Empire was effectively ruled by Yolanda, Henry&#x27;s sister and Peter&#x27;s widow, in regency. The last two Latin emperors were Peter and Yolanda&#x27;s sons, Robert and Baldwin.

<text>Heavenly are a twee pop band, originally forming in Oxford, England in 1989. Amelia Fletcher (vocals/guitar), Mathew Fletcher (drums; Amelia&#x27;s brother), Peter Momtchiloff (guitar) and Robert Pursey (bass) had all been members of Talulah Gosh, a key member of the C86 scene.

==History==
Heavenly debuted with the 7&quot; single &quot;I Fell in Love Last Night&quot;, followed by another 7&quot;, &quot;Our Love Is Heavenly&quot;, both released in 1990 on Sarah Records. &quot;Heavenly vs. Satan&quot;, the group&#x27;s debut album, came out in 1991. At this stage in their career, the instrumentation remained very much the same jangly guitar style used by Talulah Gosh.

Before releasing the critically acclaimed &quot;Le Jardin de Heavenly&quot;, Cathy Rogers (keyboard, back-up vocals) joined the band. Her harmony vocals and keyboards became an integral part of the group&#x27;s sound. The group&#x27;s second album also features the track &quot;C is the Heavenly Option,&quot; featuring the guest vocals of K Records founder Calvin Johnson, who released Heavenly&#x27;s records in the US.

Before their next long-player, Heavenly released two non-album 7&quot; singles, &quot;P.U.N.K. Girl&quot; and &quot;Atta Girl.&quot; These signalled a growing complexity in Fletcher&#x27;s songwriting, particularly &quot;Atta Girl,&quot; in which Fletcher and Rogers sung in rapid-fire trade-off vocals. A broadening (and darkening) of lyrical subject matter was shown in the B-side, &quot;Hearts and Crosses,&quot; which told the story of a date rape, with an upbeat keyboard riff providing an ironic counterpoint.

The band&#x27;s third LP was &quot;The Decline and Fall of Heavenly&quot; (1994). In 1995, the band contributed the song &quot;Snail Trail&quot; to the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Bothered produced by the Red Hot Organization.

The group&#x27;s last album was &quot;Operation Heavenly&quot; (1996). Arriving in the middle of the Britpop boom, the album contained a cover of the Serge Gainsbourg-penned and France Gall-performed &quot;Nous ne sommes pas des anges,&quot; sung entirely in French by Fletcher. Due to the closing of Sarah Records it was released on Wiiija. It included a second Calvin Johnson guest spot on the track &quot;Pet Monkey.&quot;

However, shortly before the release of &quot;Operation Heavenly&quot;, Mathew Fletcher took his own life. The remaining members announced that the band name Heavenly was to be retired, but that they would continue, using the name Marine Research, a moniker under which they released a single album, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Sounds from the Gulf Stream&quot;, on K Records (it was not released separately in Britain). Afterwards, Marine Research dissolved.

The band&#x27;s core members reformed in 2002 as Tender Trap, releasing four albums before calling it a day in 2013. As of 2024, Fletcher and Pursey are both in The Catenary Wires and Swansea Sound, while Momtchiloff plays in Would-be-goods and Tufthunter.

Heavenly reunited for a concert at Bush Hall in London in May 2023, with Ian Button replacing Mathew Fletcher on drums. In 2024, the band played further dates in Spain, France and the US. The band also premiered new songs on those tour dates as well.

<text>Peter, also Peter II of Courtenay (; died 1219), was emperor of the Latin Empire of Constantinople from 1216 to 1217.

==Biography==
Peter II was a son of Peter I of Courtenay (died 1183), a younger son of Louis VI of France and his second wife, Adélaide de Maurienne. His mother was Elisabeth de Courtenay, daughter of Renaud de Courtenay (died 1194) and Hawise du Donjon.

Peter first married Agnes I, via whom he obtained the three counties of Nevers, Auxerre, and Tonnerre. In 1193 he married secondly to Yolanda, a sister of Baldwin and Henry of Flanders, who were afterwards the first and second emperors of the Latin Empire of Constantinople. Peter accompanied his cousin, King Philip Augustus, on the third Crusade in 1190, returning to France in 1193. He fought (alongside his brother Robert) in the Albigensian Crusade in 1209 and 1211, when he took part in the siege of Lavaur. He was present at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214.

When his brother-in-law, the emperor Henry, died without issue in 1216, Peter was chosen as his successor, and with a small army he left his residence of château de Druyes in France to take possession of his throne. He was consecrated emperor at the Basilica of Saint Lawrence outside the Walls in Rome by Pope Honorius III on 9 April 1217. He then borrowed some ships from the Venetians, promising in return to conquer Durazzo for them, but he failed in this enterprise and sought to make his way to Constantinople by land. On the journey he was seized by the despot of Epirus, Theodore Komnenos Doukas, and, after an imprisonment of two years, died, probably by foul means. Peter thus never governed his empire, which, however, was ruled for a time by his wife, Yolanda, who had succeeded in reaching Constantinople. Two of his sons, Robert and Baldwin, reigned in turn as emperors of the Latin Empire of Constantinople.

==Family==
By his first wife Agnes I, Countess of Nevers he had:
* Matilda I, Countess of Nevers

By his second wife Yolanda of Flanders, of the House of Flanders he had:
* Philip (died 1226), Marquis of Namur, who declined the offer of the crown of the Latin Empire
* Robert of Courtenay (died 1228), Latin Emperor of the Latin Empire of Constantinople 
* Henry (died 1229), Marquis of Namur
* Baldwin II of Constantinople (died 1273), Latin Emperor of the Latin Empire of Constantinople 
* Margaret (died 1270), Marchioness of Namur, who first married Raoul, Lord of Issoudun, and then Henry I, Count of Vianden
* Elizabeth of Courtenay who married Walter, count of Bar and then Eudes sire of Montagu
* Yolanda de Courtenay, who married Andrew II of Hungary, King of Hungary and King of Croatia
* Eleanor, who married Philip of Montfort, Lord of Tyre
* Marie de Courtenay, who married Theodore I Lascaris, Emperor of Nicaea
* Agnes, who married Geoffrey II Villehardouin, Prince of Achaea

<text>Kyrenia is a city on the northern coast of Cyprus, noted for its historic harbour and castle. It is under the &quot;de facto&quot; control of Northern Cyprus.

While there is evidence showing that the wider region of Kyrenia has been populated before, the city was built by the Greeks named Achaeans from the Peloponnese after the Trojan War (1300 BC). According to Greek mythology, Kyrenia was founded by the Achaeans Cepheus and Praxandrus who ended up there after the Trojan War. The heroes gave to the new city the name of their city of Kyrenia located in Achaia, Greece.

As the town grew prosperous, the Romans established the foundations of its castle in the 1st century AD. Kyrenia grew in importance after the 9th century due to the safety offered by the castle, and played a pivotal role under the Lusignan rule as the city never capitulated. The castle has been most recently modified by the Venetians in the 15th century, but the city surrendered to the Ottoman Empire in 1571.

The city&#x27;s population was almost equally divided between Muslims and Christians in 1831, with a slight Muslim majority. However, with the advent of British rule, many Turkish Cypriots fled to Anatolia, and the town came to be predominantly inhabited by Greek Cypriots. While the city suffered little intercommunal violence, its Greek Cypriot inhabitants, numbering around 2,650, fled or were forcefully displaced in the wake of the Turkish invasion in 1974. Currently, the city is populated by Turkish Cypriots, mainland Turkish settlers, and British expats, with a municipal population of 33,207.

Kyrenia is a cultural and economical centre, described as the tourism capital of Northern Cyprus. It is home to numerous hotels, nightlife and a port. It hosts an annual culture and arts festival with hundreds of participating artists and performers and is home to three universities with a student population around 14,000.

==History==
===Ancient times===
The earliest document which mention Kyrenia is the &#x27;Periplus of Pseudo Skylax&#x27;. It dates to the thirteenth century but is based on fourth-century BC knowledge. The manuscript names numerous towns along the Mediterranean coast and mentions Kyrenia as a harbour town: &#x27;Opposite Cilicia is the island of Cyprus, and these are its city-states (poleis): Salamis, which is Greek and has a closed winter harbour; the Karpasia, Kyrenia, Lapithos, which is Phoenician; Soloi (this has also winter harbour); Marion, which is Greek; Amathus (which is autochthonous). All of them have deserted (summer) harbours. And there are also city states speaking strange languages inland.’4 Skylax referred to both Kyrenia and Lapithos as Phoenician towns. Coins with Phoenician legends underline that the Northern coast between Kyrenia and Lapithos were at least under Phoenician influence.

Another topographical source is the &#x27;Stadiasmus Maris Magni&#x27; (from the name &#x27;stadion&#x27;, a unit measuring distances, 1 stadion = 184 metres). The unknown author, who sailed from Cape Anamur on the Cilician coast to Cyprus and circumnavigated the island, gave the distances from Asia Minor to the nearest point in Cyprus. This was 300 stadia, about 55 000 metres. He also recorded distances between towns. From Soli to Kyrenia he counted 350 stadia, from Kyrenia to Lapithos 50 and from Lapithos to Karpasia it was 550 stadia.

The &#x27;Geography&#x27; of Claudios Ptolemaios which was lost for over a thousand years and rediscovered in medieval times, is a further important source upon which the later cartography of the Renaissance is based. Ptolemy, who lived in Alexandria, Egypt, about 150 A.D., gives the distances between the towns and settlements of Cyprus which are marked by cycles. He also lists Kyrenia.

Another medieval reproduction of an ancient scroll is the &#x27;Tabula Peutingeriana&#x27; or &#x27;Peutinger Table&#x27;. It is nearly seven metres long and one metre wide and shows the road network in the Roman Empire of the 4th/5th century. The roads are drawn in straight lines and the road-stations are marked by kinks, and towns by pictograms with the name of the place and the numbers in Roman miles. Kyrenia together with Paphos, Soloi, Tremethousa and Salamis are marked by a pictogram showing two towers close together. Kyrenia is connected by a road via Lapithos and Soli with Paphos and via Chytri (Greek Kythraea, Turkish Değirmenlik) with Salamis.

Through the use of milestones during Roman times, a new source appeared which shows that the road circuit around the island was completed. Kyrenia was connected via Soli and Paphos to the western and southern part of the island. At the same time, the road to the east was extended along the shore to Karpasia and Urania on the Karpas peninsula. During the following centuries, Kyrenia is variously named on the maps as Ceraunia, Cerenis, Keronean, Kernia and Kerini.

Cepheus from Arcadia is believed to be the founder of the town of Kyrenia. A military leader, he arrived at the north coast of the island bringing with him many settlers from various towns in Achaea. One such town, located near present-day Aigio in the Peloponnese, was also called Kyrenia. This is said to be the home of the mythical Ceryneian Hind () from the 12 Labours of Hercules. East of Kyrenia lies the &quot;Coast of Achaeans&quot;. It was at Kyrenia, according to Strabo, that Teucer came first ashore, to found the ancient Kingdom of Salamis after the Trojan war.

The earliest reference made to the town of Kyrenia is found, together with that of the other seven city kingdoms of Cyprus, in Egyptian scripts dating from the period of Ramesses III, 1125-1100s BC.

From its early days of settlement, Kyrenia&#x27;s commerce and maritime trade benefited enormously from its proximity to the Asia Minor coast. Boats set sail from the Aegean islands, traveled along the Asia Minor coast, and then crossed over the short distance to the northern shores of Cyprus to reach the two city kingdoms of Lapithos and Kyrenia. This lively maritime activity (late 4th or early 3rd century BC) is evident in an ancient shipwreck discovered by Andreas Kariolou in 1965, just outside Kyrenia harbour. The vessel&#x27;s route along Samos, Kos, Rhodes, the Asia Minor coastline and then Kyrenia, demonstrates the town&#x27;s close maritime relations with other city kingdoms in the eastern Mediterranean.

During the succession struggle between Ptolemy and Antigonus that followed Alexander the Great&#x27;s death in 323 BC, Kyrenia was subdued under the rule of the kingdom of Lapithos that allied itself with the Antigonid dynasty. Diodorus Siculus(19.79) observes that in 312 BC. Ptolemy arrested Praxipos the king of Lapithos and the king of Kyrenia. Once the Ptolemies were successful in dominating the whole island, all city kingdoms were abolished. Kyrenia however, because of its maritime trade, continued to prosper. In the 2nd century BC, it is cited as one of six Cypriot towns which were benefactors to the Oracle at Delphi, that is, it received its special representatives who collected contributions and gifts. The town&#x27;s prosperity at this time is also evident from its two temples, one dedicated to Apollo and the other to Aphrodite, and from the rich archeological finds dating from the Hellenistic period excavated within the present-day town limits.

The Romans succeeded the Ptolemies as rulers of Cyprus and during this time Lapithos became the administrative centre of the district. The numerous tombs excavated and the rich archeological finds dating from this period indicate however, that Kyrenia continued to be a populous and prosperous town. An inscription found at the base of a limestone statue dating from 13 to 37 AD, refers to &#x27;Kyrenians Demos&#x27; that is, the town&#x27;s inhabitants. Here as everywhere else, the Romans left their mark by constructing a castle with a seawall in front of it so that boats and ships could anchor in safety.

Christianity found fertile ground in the area. Early Christians used the old quarries of Chrysokava, just east of Kyrenia castle, as catacombs and cut-rock cemeteries which are considered among the island&#x27;s most important specimens of this period. Later, some of these caves were converted into churches and feature iconography, the most representative of which is that found at &quot;Ayia Mavri&quot;. The latest editions of the Roman Martyrology no longer include a mention, as a martyr, of Bishop Theodotus of this see. The Greek Menologium recounts, under 6 May, that under Licinius he was arrested and tortured, before being released when the Edict of Milan of 313, of which Licinius was co-author, mandated toleration of Christians in the Roman Empire.

===Middle ages===

With the division of the Roman Empire into an eastern and a western empire, in 395 Cyprus came under the Byzantine emperors and the Greek Orthodox Church. The Byzantine emperors fortified Kyrenia&#x27;s Roman castle and in the 10th century, they constructed in its vicinity a church dedicated to Saint George, which the garrison used as a chapel. Then, when in 806, Lambousa was destroyed in the Arab raids, Kyrenia grew in importance because its castle and garrison offered its inhabitants protection and security. Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus, the island&#x27;s last Byzantine governor, sent his family and treasures to the castle for safety in 1191 when King Richard I of England went to war with him and became the island&#x27;s new master.

Richard&#x27;s rule was not welcomed in Cyprus so he sold the island first to the Knights Templar, and then in 1192, to Guy of Lusignan. Under Frankish rule, the villages of the district of Kyrenia became feudal estates and the town became once again the administrative and commercial centre for its region. The Lusignans enlarged the castle, built a wall and towers around the town, and extended the fortifications to the harbour. They also fortified the Byzantine castles of Saint Hilarion, Buffavento and Kantara, which, together with Kyrenia Castle, protected the town from land and sea attacks. Kyrenia castle played a pivotal role in the island&#x27;s history during the many disputes among the Frankish kings, as well as the conflicts with the Genoese. 

In 1229, during the civil war in Cyprus, the forces of King Henry I of Cyprus and the Ibelins took the castle of Kyrenia from the supporters of Frederick II with the support of Genoese ships. Strangely Henry I&#x27;s wife Alice of Montferrat was one of the victims and he had never met her.

In 1489, Cyprus came under Venetian rule. The Venetians modified Kyrenia Castle to meet the threat that the use of gunpowder and cannons posed. The castle&#x27;s royal quarters and three of its four thin and elegant Frankish towers were demolished and replaced by thickset circular towers that could better withstand cannon fire. 

In 1505, a plague that was thought to have originated in Anatolia killed a quarter of the town&#x27;s population. Another plague that originated in the Levant and affected parts of the island struck the town in 1523.

The castle&#x27;s towers were never put to the test. In 1571, the castle and the town surrendered to the Ottoman army.

===Ottoman rule===

Under Ottoman rule, Kyrenia district was at first one of four, then one of six, administrative districts of the island and the town remained its administrative capital. The town&#x27;s fortunes declined however as it was transformed into a garrison town. The Christian population was expelled from the fortified city, and no one was allowed to reside within the castle other than the artillerymen and their families. These men coerced the town&#x27;s inhabitants and those of the surrounding villages, Christian and Muslim alike, with their arbitrary looting and crimes. The few local inhabitants who dared to stay were merchants and fishermen whose livelihood depended on the sea. They built their homes outside the city wall, which through time, neglect and disrepair, turned to ruin. The rest of the inhabitants moved further out to the area known as Pano Kyrenia or the &#x27;Riatiko&#x27; (so called because it once belonged to a king) or fled further inland and to the mountain villages of Thermeia, Karakoumi, Kazafani, Bellapais and Karmi.

The town revived again when bribes and gifts paid to local Turkish officials caused them to permit local maritime trade with Asia Minor and the Aegean islands to resume. In 1783, the church of Chrysopolitissa was renovated. Then in 1856, following the Hatt-i Humayun, which introduced social and political reform and greater religious freedom for the various peoples of the Ottoman Empire, the church of Archangel Michael was rebuilt on a rocky mount overlooking the sea. At about this time, many of the Christian inhabitants of the surrounding villages re-established themselves in the town. Local agriculture and maritime trade, particularly the export of carobs to Asia Minor, allowed the people of Kyrenia to have a comfortable living, and some even to educate their children and pursue other cultural activities.

According to the 1831 census, which counted only male inhabitants, Muslims made up 52% of the population. By 1881, three years into the British administration of the island, Muslims and Christians in the town were still almost equal in numbers; the census for 1881 records the town&#x27;s population as 570 Muslims and 594 Christians. However, a significant Muslim emigration from the town to Anatolia took place between 1881 and 1931, reducing the Muslim population ratio to only 36% in 1901, 32.5% in 1911, 30% in 1921, and 24% in 1931. One explanation for this exodus may be the general anxiety that prevailed among the island&#x27;s Muslim population during the Balkan and First World wars, when the Ottomans fought against Greece in the former and Britain in the latter. Proclamation of the island as a British colony in 1924 caused further Turkish Cypriot emigration to Anatolia, symptomatic of the weak bond the Cypriot Turkish population had with the town. The Turkish Cypriot population proportion continued to decrease until 1960 when it reached 20%.

===British rule===

In 1878, following a secret agreement between the British and Ottoman governments, the island was ceded to Great Britain as a military base in the eastern Mediterranean. At first Great Britain did not undertake major administrative changes, so Kyrenia remained the district&#x27;s capital. A road was constructed through the mountain pass to connect the town to Nicosia, the island&#x27;s capital, and the harbour was repaired and expanded to accommodate increasing trade with the opposite coast. The town&#x27;s municipal affairs were put in order and the municipal council took an active role in cleaning and modernizing the town.

In 1893, a hospital was built through private contributions and effort. By the 1900s (decade), Kyrenia was a buzzing little town with a new school building, its own newspaper, and social, educational, and athletic clubs. It was also a favoured vacation spot for many wealthy Nicosian families. Many homes were converted into pensions and boardinghouses and in 1906, the first hotel, Akteon, was built by the sea.

These first decades of British rule however, also saw increased economic hardship for the population. High taxation, frequent droughts, and a world economic depression were precipitating factors for a mass exodus of people from the town and district, first to Egypt and then to the United States. The transfer of the island to British rule also prompted anxiety in the Turkish Cypriot population, whose numbers stagnated as a significant emigration to Anatolia took place. Meanwhile, the ratio of the Greek Cypriots grew significantly from 49% to 67%.

In 1922, the Episcopal see of Kyrenia relocated back to the town after the completion of a new metropolitan building. That same year, the Greco-Turkish war brought to a halt all trade with the opposite coast causing a serious economic depression.

Costas Catsellis, a young repatriate from the United States, came to the rescue by building the town&#x27;s first modern hotels, the Seaview in 1922 and the Dome in 1932. Kyrenia&#x27;s mild climate, picturesque harbour, numerous archeological sites, panoramic views that combined sea, mountains and vegetation, coupled with modern amenities, soon attracted many travellers and Kyrenia&#x27;s economy revived through tourism.

After the Second World War, more hotels were built and the town remained a favoured vacation spot for people from Nicosia and foreign travellers alike. To the town&#x27;s Greek and Turkish inhabitants were added many from Great Britain, who chose Kyrenia as their permanent place of residence.

===1960-present===

In 1960, Cyprus gained its independence from Great Britain. However, the intercommunal conflict that broke out in 1963–64 between the island&#x27;s Greek and Turkish population again eroded Kyrenia&#x27;s prosperity. While skirmishes in Kyrenia were minimal, the Turkish Resistance Organisation did blockade the Kyrenia-Nicosia road and occupy Saint Hilarion castle.

Despite these difficulties, the 1960s and early 1970s was a period of lively cultural and economic activity. A new town hall was built and a Folklore Museum established. The ancient shipwreck already alluded to was reassembled, together with all its amphorae and cargo, and permanently exhibited at the castle. The number of new hotels and tourists multiplied and a new road was constructed in the early 1970s connecting the town to Nicosia from the east. The town&#x27;s cultural activities greatly increased. Other than the many traditional cultural and religious fairs and festivals annually celebrated, flower shows, yachting races, concerts and theater performances were organized. Kyrenia, the smallest of Cypriot towns, was undoubtedly the island&#x27;s most precious jewel.

According to the 1973 census, 67.7% of the city&#x27;s inhabitants were Greek Cypriots, while the Turkish Cypriots made up 25.1% of the population. The town&#x27;s inhabitants, Greek, Turk, Maronite, Armenian, Latin and British peacefully coexisted and cooperated in their daily affairs and the town had grown beyond its two historic neighbourhoods of Kato (Lower) Kyrenia and Pano (Upper) Kyrenia. It expanded towards the mountain slopes to form the new neighbourhood of &quot;California&quot;, and eastward it had just about reached the outskirts of Thermia, Karakoumi and Ayios Georgios.

On 20 July 1974, the Turkish army invaded Cyprus in response to a coup d&#x27;état carried out by EOKA B and the Greek military junta of 1967–1974, landing at 5-Mile point, west of Kyrenia. Gaining ground against the local forces, the Turkish Army reached Kyrenia on 22 July 1974 during the UN-sponsored cease fire. The majority of the Greek Cypriot population of the city fled in the wake of the Turkish advance. A small group of Greek Cypriots who tried to remain within Kyrenia were kept in the Dome Hotel until October 1975, after which they were taken to Bellapais; the total number of the displaced Kyrenian Greek Cypriots were around 2,650. Subsequently, Turkish Cypriots displaced from elsewhere in Cyprus and immigrants from Turkey moved in, with the result that the town&#x27;s present ethnic make-up is predominantly Turkish and Turkish-Cypriot.

== Cityscape ==

===Harbour===
In its heyday, just before the British occupation of the island in 1878, Kyrenia harbour was a quiet, often ignored, port between Cyprus and other countries in Europe and the Middle East. From there local Caïques, Cypriot owned - Greek and Turkish Cypriot - and Greek owned, conducted a thriving trade. Depending on the season, they exported wheat and olives, donkeys and goats and much more. Larger boats, mostly from Europe, arrived in the late fall and early winter to take in the crop of carobs, the main export item of the area. The caiques brought in wood, earthenware, legumes, cheese, butter, and even small luxuries items such as silk and cotton cloth, buttons and odd pieces of furniture. Slowly, two storied buildings emerged around the harbour as the owners used the lower floor as warehouses and the second floor as their residences.

The town&#x27;s trade with the Anatolian coast and beyond the Levant sea was badly affected when in 1885, the then British government of the island began the Kyrenia harbour works that left the harbor wide open to the northern gales. Slowly, over the next decades, scores of caiques were wrecked within Kyrenia harbour, with their owners often unable to recover from the loss.

Kyrenia harbour is currently a tourist location.

As of December 2022, a restoration of the Harbour has begun and is expected to be complete by June 2023.

===Architecture===

Kyrenia Castle at the east end of the old harbour is a spectacular site. The castle dates back to Byzantine times and has served the Byzantines, Crusaders, Venetians, Ottomans, and British. Within its walls there is a 12th-century chapel containing reused late Roman capitols, and a shipwreck museum. Huge round towers that the Venetians built in 1540 occupy the corners. These strengthened the castle against the artillery of the time..

The town has an icon museum housed in a church that had been dedicated to the Archangel Michael. Not far from it there are some tombs cut into the rock dating from about the 4th century. Behind the harbour are the ruins of a small Christian church, and in the harbour is a small tower from which a defensive chain could be slung to close the harbour to any enemies. The Anglican Church of St. Andrews is behind the castle, close to the bus station, and is open all year round.
An example of Ottoman architecture in the city centre is the Agha Cafer Pasha Mosque, built in 1589–90. The city is also home to four 19th century fountains and an Ottoman-era cemetery where soldiers serving at the castle and victims of contagious diseases are rumoured to have been interred.

Bellapais Abbey (from the French &quot;abbaye de la paix&quot; which means the Peace Monastery), in the northern village of Bellapais, was constructed between 1198 and 1205. The main building as it can be seen today was built during the 13th century by French Augustinian monks, and specifically during the rule of King Hugh III 1267–1284. The pavilions around the courtyard and the refectory were constructed during the rule of King Hugh IV between 1324 and 1359. You can also see the Ancient Greek Orthodox Church of Mother Mary Robed in White.

Outside the town, on the Kyrenia mountain range, are Buffavento Castle, St. Hilarion Castle and Kantara Castle, all of which are thought to have been constructed by the Byzantines following the Arab raids on the island. During Lusignan rule, Buffavento Castle was a prison and called &#x27;Château du Lion&#x27;. There the despot Byzantine king of the island, Isaac Comnenus, is said to have fled after Richard the Lion Heart conquered Cyprus in 1191. The mountaintop castle of St. Hilarion dominates the town of Kyrenia and is visible for many miles along the coast. Historical records show that the castle was originally a monastery, founded about 800 when a monk by the name of Hilarion chose the site for his hermitage. Later, perhaps in 1100, the monastery was changed into a castle. The easternmost of the three castles is Kantara castle. Sources only mention the castle in the year 1191, when Richard Lion-Heart captured the island.

==Climate==
Kyrenia has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;) with long, dry and hot summers and cool winters with mixed weather of sunny spells and rain. Kyrenia is among the wettest places in coastal Cyprus.

== Economy ==

Kyrenia is the centre of tourism in Northern Cyprus and one of the most important cities of Cyprus in terms of tourism. It hosts numerous shopping areas and malls, restaurants and a vibrant nightlife with a number of entertainment facilities. The harbour, in particular, is lined with cafés, bars and restaurants frequented by locals and tourists. In 2009, it had 93 hotels, nine of which had five stars.

In early 2000s, the city and the surrounding area saw a construction boom due to the positive mood created by the Annan Plan for Cyprus. Between 2001 and 2003, construction cases per year increased by more than three times and the city saw a great amount of property being sold to foreigners. The construction boom resulted in the building of numerous housing estates and apartment buildings. The city continued to receive heavy investment throughout the decade and is still a centre of investment. However, the recession that struck Northern Cyprus at the end of the 2000s and the beginning of 2010s affected the city and caused great difficulty for the small-scale entrepreneurs and shop owners to maintain their businesses. An important part of the economy consists of tourists that come to visit casinos, but this does not necessarily provide benefits for the local businesses.

In addition to its historical harbour, Kyrenia is home to a port named the Kyrenia Touristic Port, opened in 1987. This port is a major transport hub in Northern Cyprus due to its relative proximity to Turkey and is home to commercial activity, while being a place of entry for tourists who choose to travel by ferry. It has contributed to the flow of commercial products and tourists between Turkey and Northern Cyprus.

== Culture ==

Kyrenia annually hosts the Kyrenia Festival of Culture and Arts for the whole month of June. The festival includes concerts ranging from popular Turkish bands and singers, such as Duman, Sertab Erener and Zülfü Livaneli to Latin music and reggae in the city&#x27;s amphitheatre and the Ramadan Cemil Square, talk shows, plays and musicals performed by theatrical groups from Turkey. The festival in 2012 saw the participation of 500-600 artists and performers. It has also hosted international performers such as the bands UB40 and The Animals and invited street artists from Europe for performances. It has also been praised for its inclusive approach to local musicians as a way of encouraging cultural activity in Northern Cyprus. Under mayor Nidai Güngördü, the festival was renamed &quot;Kyrenia Days of Culture and Arts&quot; with activities spread from May to September.

The city hosted the Golden Island International Film Festival in 2014, the first time such an organization took place in Northern Cyprus. 20 Turkish Cypriot films were shown in the festival as well as foreign films.

The city is home to various musical activities. One such activity is the annual International Bellapais Music Festival, in which notable Turkish Cypriot musicians, such as the pianist Rüya Taner and international musicians participate. Another such organization is the Bellapais Spring Music Festival, which features operas and classical music concerts from Turkish Cypriot, Turkish and international individuals and institutions.

<doc id="151758" wikidata="Q1709098" url="?curid=151758" title="José Celso Barbosa">
<text>José Celso Barbosa Alcala (July 27, 1857 – September 21, 1921) was a Puerto Rican physician, sociologist and political leader. Known as the father of the statehood movement in Puerto Rico, Barbosa was the first Puerto Rican, and one of the first persons of African descent to earn a medical degree in the United States.

After his return to the island in 1880, Barbosa made many contributions to medicine and public health. He initiated an early form of health insurance, encouraging employers to pay a fee to cover future needs of their employees. In 1900 Barbosa was among the first five Puerto Rican leaders appointed to the Executive Cabinet under Governor Charles H. Allen, in the first civilian government organized by the United States. He served in the Cabinet until 1917. From 1917 to 1921, Barbosa served in the first elected Puerto Rican Senate.

==Early years ==
Barbosa was born in 1857 in the city of Bayamón, Puerto Rico to parents of African and European ancestry. He received both his primary and secondary education in Puerto Rico. He was the first person of African ancestry to attend Puerto Rico&#x27;s prestigious Jesuit Seminary. After graduating from the seminary, Barbosa tutored private students to save money to attend college. In 1875, he moved to New York City to attend prep school, where he learned English in a year.

==Education==

Originally Barbosa wished to become a lawyer, but after he suffered a bout of pneumonia in New York City, his doctor recommended that he study medicine. In 1877 he applied but was denied admission to the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University, due to his race. He then applied and was admitted to the medical school of the University of Michigan, where he graduated as valedictorian of the class of 1880. Barbosa was the first person from Puerto Rico to earn a medical degree in the United States. He returned to Puerto Rico, where he set up a practice in his hometown of Bayamón.

The Spanish colonial government initially did not recognize Barbosa&#x27;s medical degree, as it was not from a known European university. The American consul to the island intervened on behalf of Barbosa to have his United States degree recognized, so that he could practice.

Barbosa provided medical care all over the island. He introduced the novel idea of employers paying a fee for the future healthcare needs of their employees (a very early health insurance system). In 1893, Barbosa founded the first Puerto Rican cooperative and named it &quot;El Ahorro Colectivo.&quot;

==Political career==
During the Spanish colonial period, Barbosa was a member of the Partido Autonomista Puro (Pure Autonomous Party), also known as &quot;Partido Histórico&quot; and &quot;Partido Ortodoxo&quot;, led by Román Baldorioty de Castro, but left because of ideological differences.

In 1898, when the United States bombarded and blockaded San Juan during the Spanish–American War, Barbosa and other doctors who lived in Bayamón traveled to the town of Cataño and took a ferry to the capital. Barbosa, as a member of the Red Cross, went to the aid of the wounded Puerto Rican and Spanish soldiers. He and his party on the ferry had to travel across San Juan Bay at risk, as they were under cannon fire. Barbosa and those with him were recommended by the Spanish government for the &quot;Cruz de la Orden del Mérito Naval&quot; (The Cross of the Order of Naval Merit) for their bravery.

As a result of the war, the United States made Puerto Rico one of its territories. On July 4, 1899, Barbosa formed the pro-statehood Partido Republicano de Puerto Rico. He became known as the father of the statehood for Puerto Rico movement.
==Later years==

On June 5, 1900, President William McKinley named Barbosa, together with Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón, José de Diego, Manuel Camuñas and Andrés Crosas, as part of an Executive Cabinet under U.S.-appointed Governor Charles H. Allen, the first civilian governor of the island. The Executive Cabinet also included six American members. Barbosa served on the Executive Cabinet until 1917, dealing with a variety of governors appointed by the US during that period, and providing continuity in administration.

During this period, in 1907 he founded the newspaper &quot;El Tiempo,&quot; the first bilingual newspaper published on the island.

With representative elections authorized in 1917, Barbosa ran for an at-large seat. He was elected, serving as a member of the first Puerto Rican Senate, from 1917 to 1921.

José Celso Barbosa died in San Juan on September 21, 1921. He was buried in Santa Maria Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery in Old San Juan. One of his daughters, Pilar Barbosa, became a historian, serving as the Official Historian of Puerto Rico from 1993 to 1997. She was also a political activist who carried on her father&#x27;s work.

==Legacy and honors==

*Puerto Rico has declared his birthday, July 27, an official holiday, known as José Celso Barbosa Day.
*Barbosa&#x27;s house in Bayamón has been preserved and is operated as a historic house museum. Many of his awards, certificates, books and other artifacts of interest are on exhibit. 
*On August 1, 2006, the United States Postal Service Post Office at 100 Avenida RL Rodriguez in Bayamón was named as the &quot;Dr. Jose Celso Barbosa Post Office Building&quot;. The act for this was signed by President George W. Bush.
* In Ponce, there is a school named after him.
*Avenida José C. Barbosa, in Yauco, is named for him.

==Descendants==
Barbosa had twelve children including, Roberto C. Barbosa who became a dentist, Guillermo H. Barbosa, who became a surgeon and Pilar Barbosa de Rosario, who became Puerto Ricos first female official historian and married José Ezequiel Rosario. His cousin Jesus, gave birth to Oddosia &quot;Thea&quot; Barbosa.

<doc id="151762" wikidata="Q227444" url="?curid=151762" title="Zu Chongzhi">
<text>Zu Chongzhi (; 429 – 500), courtesy name Wenyuan (), was a Chinese astronomer, inventor, mathematician, politician, and writer during the Liu Song and Southern Qi dynasties. He was most notable for calculating pi as between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927, a record in precision which would not be surpassed for nearly 900 years.
==Life and works==

Chongzhi&#x27;s ancestry was from modern Baoding, Hebei. To flee from the ravages of war, Zu&#x27;s grandfather Zu Chang moved to the Yangtze, as part of the massive population movement during the Eastern Jin. Zu Chang () at one point held the position of Chief Minister for the Palace Buildings () within the Liu Song and was in charge of government construction projects. Zu&#x27;s father, Zu Shuozhi (), also served the court and was greatly respected for his erudition.

Zu was born in Jiankang. His family had historically been involved in astronomical research, and from childhood Zu was exposed to both astronomy and mathematics. When he was only a youth, his talent earned him much repute. When Emperor Xiaowu of Song heard of him, he was sent to the Hualin Xuesheng () academy, and later the Imperial Nanjing University (Zongmingguan) to perform research. In 461 in Nanxu (today Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), he was engaged in work at the office of the local governor. In 464, Zu moved to Louxian (today Songjiang district, Shanghai), there, he compiled the Daming calendar and calculated π.

Zu Chongzhi, along with his son Zu Gengzhi, wrote a mathematical text entitled &quot;Zhui Shu&quot; (; &quot;Methods for Interpolation&quot;). It is said that the treatise contained formulas for the volume of a sphere, cubic equations and an accurate value of pi. This book has been lost since the Song dynasty.

His mathematical achievements included
*the &quot;Daming&quot; calendar () introduced by him in 465.
*distinguishing the sidereal year and the tropical year. He measured 45 years and 11 months per degree between those two; today we know the difference is 70.7 years per degree.
*calculating one year as 365.24281481 days, which is very close to 365.24219878 days as we know today.
*calculating the number of overlaps between sun and moon as 27.21223, which is very close to 27.21222 as we know today; using this number he successfully predicted an eclipse four times during 23 years (from 436 to 459).
*calculating the Jupiter year as about 11.858 Earth years, which is very close to 11.862 as we know of today.
*deriving two approximations of pi, (3.1415926535897932...) which held as the most accurate approximation for for over nine hundred years. His best approximation was between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927, with  (, milü, close ratio) and  (, yuelü, approximate ratio) being the other notable approximations. He obtained the result by approximating a circle with a 24,576 (= 213 × 3) sided polygon. This was an impressive feat for the time, especially considering that the counting rods he used for recording intermediate results were merely a pile of wooden sticks laid out in certain patterns. Japanese mathematician Yoshio Mikami pointed out, &quot; was nothing more than the value obtained several hundred years earlier by the Greek mathematician Archimedes, however milü = could not be found in any Greek, Indian or Arabian manuscripts, not until 1585 Dutch mathematician Adriaan Anthoniszoon obtained this fraction; the Chinese possessed this most extraordinary fraction over a whole millennium earlier than Europe&quot;. Hence Mikami strongly urged that the fraction be named after Zu Chongzhi as &quot;Zu&#x27;s fraction&quot;. In Chinese literature, this fraction is known as &quot;Zu&#x27;s ratio&quot;. Zu&#x27;s ratio is a best rational approximation to , and is the closest rational approximation to from all fractions with denominator less than 16600.
*finding the volume of a sphere as D3/6 where D is diameter (equivalent to 4/3r3).

== Astronomy ==
Zu was an accomplished astronomer who calculated the time values with unprecedented precision. His methods of interpolation and the use of integration were far ahead of his time. Even the results of the astronomer Yi Xing (who was beginning to utilize foreign knowledge) were not comparable. The Sung dynasty calendar was backwards to the &quot;Northern barbarians&quot; because they were implementing their daily lives with the &quot;Da Ming Li&quot;. It is said that his methods of calculation were so advanced, the scholars of the Sung dynasty and Indo influence astronomers of the Tang dynasty found it confusing.

== Mathematics ==
The majority of Zu&#x27;s great mathematical works are recorded in his lost text the &quot;Zhui Shu&quot;. Most schools argue about his complexity since traditionally the Chinese had developed mathematics as algebraic and equational. Logically, scholars assume that the &quot;Zhui Shu&quot; yields methods of cubic equations. His works on the accurate value of pi describe the lengthy calculations involved. Zu used the Liu Hui&#x27;s algorithm described earlier by Liu Hui to inscribe a 12,288-gon. Zu&#x27;s value of pi is precise to six decimal places and for almost nine hundred years thereafter no subsequent mathematician computed a value this precise. Zu also worked on deducing the formula for the volume of a sphere with his son Zu Gengzhi. In their calculation, Zu used the concept that two solids with equal cross-sectional areas at equal heights must also have equal volumes to find the volume of a Steinmetz solid. And further multiplied the volume of the Steinmetz solid with π/4, therefore found the volume of a sphere as πd^3/6 (d is the diameter of the sphere).

==Inventions and innovations==
===Hammer mills===
In 488, Zu Chongzhi was responsible for erecting water powered trip hammer mills which was inspected by Emperor Wu of Southern Qi during the early 490s.

===Paddle boats===
Zu is also credited with inventing Chinese paddle boats or Qianli chuan in the late 5th century AD during the Southern Qi dynasty. The boats made sailing a more reliable form of transportation and based on the shipbuilding technology of its day, numerous paddle wheel ships were constructed during the Tang era as the boats were able to cruise at faster speeds than the existing vessels at the time as well as being able to cover hundreds of kilometers of distance without the aid of wind.

===South pointing chariot===
The south-pointing chariot device was first invented by the Chinese mechanical engineer Ma Jun (c. 200–265 AD). It was a wheeled vehicle that incorporated an early use of differential gears to operate a fixed figurine that would constantly point south, hence enabling one to accurately measure their directional bearings. This effect was achieved not by magnetics (like in a compass), but through intricate mechanics, the same design that allows equal amounts of torque applied to wheels rotating at different speeds for the modern automobile. After the Three Kingdoms period, the device fell out of use temporarily. However, it was Zu Chongzhi who successfully re-invented it in 478, as described in the texts of the &quot;Book of Song&quot; and the &quot;Book of Qi&quot;, with a passage from the latter below:
When Emperor Wu of Liu Song subdued Guanzhong he obtained the south-pointing carriage of Yao Xing, but it was only the shell with no machinery inside. Whenever it moved it had to have a man inside to turn (the figure). In the Sheng-Ming reign period, Gao Di commissioned Zi Zu Chongzhi to reconstruct it according to the ancient rules. He accordingly made new machinery of bronze, which would turn round about without a hitch and indicate the direction with uniformity. Since Ma Jun&#x27;s time such a thing had not been.
== Literature ==
Zu&#x27;s paradoxographical work &quot;Accounts of Strange Things&quot; [] survives.

==Named after him==
* ≈ as Zu Chongzhi&#x27;s ratio.
*The lunar crater Tsu Chung-Chi
*1888 Zu Chong-Zhi is the name of asteroid 1964 VO1.
*ZUC stream cipher is a new encryption algorithm.

<text>The Nazz was an American rock band formed in Philadelphia in 1967. The group was founded by guitarist and main songwriter Todd Rundgren and bassist Carson Van Osten. Drummer Thom Mooney and vocalist/keyboardist Robert &quot;Stewkey&quot; Antoni joined soon after. The group is best known for their debut single &quot;Open My Eyes”, and &quot;Hello It&#x27;s Me&quot;.

During 1968 and 1969, the Nazz released two albums (&quot;Nazz&quot; and &quot;Nazz Nazz&quot;). Following the group&#x27;s disbandment in 1969, a collection of archival recordings was compiled and released under the title &quot;Nazz III&quot;. Rundgren later re-recorded a solo version of &quot;Hello It&#x27;s Me&quot; that reached number 5 on the U.S. charts.

==History==
===Name and formation===
Nazz was formed in Philadelphia in 1967. Vocalist/keyboardist Robert Antoni performed and recorded under the mononym Stewkey, which he said was a nickname he earned because he &quot;was always stewed&quot;.

The band took its name from The Yardbirds&#x27; 1966 song &quot;The Nazz Are Blue&quot;. There also exists a 1952 monologue, &quot;The Nazz&quot;, by the American Beatnik comedian Lord Buckley, but Rundgren has said that none of the band members were aware of this. 

The band&#x27;s official name on all records and press materials is simply &quot;Nazz&quot;, without the definite article. However, the group also sometimes called themselves &quot;the Nazz&quot;. Rundgren stated that &quot;We were formed in the late sixties, so most every band was &quot;the&quot; something. It was always &#x27;the This&#x27; or &#x27;the That,&#x27; so we were looking for something kind of simple and iconographic, I guess.&quot; In the song &quot;Loosen Up&quot;, a member introduces the group as &quot;the Nazz, from Philadelphia.&quot; Conversely, in a 2019 interview, Mooney and Antoni stated that &quot;Nazz&quot; had always been the correct name.

The group&#x27;s original managers Jack Warfield and Jerry Bartoff owned a record store in downtown Philadelphia, and the band first rehearsed in a storage room above the record store. The group&#x27;s first major concert had them opening for the Doors on June 18, 1967.

In Phoenix, Arizona, another band called Nazz was formed at about the same time that Nazz was formed in Philadelphia. This group released only one single before moving to Los Angeles and renaming themselves Alice Cooper.

The Nazz were approached at a Holiday Inn bar by manager/publicist John Kurland, who was looking for an act to manage and thought they looked like a band. After hearing them play in their space above the record shop, Kurland bargained with Warfield and Bartoff to buy the Nazz out. Kurland and his assistant Michael Friedman marketed the Nazz in a teen magazine along with bands like the Monkees. However, the band preferred the heavier rock sounds of The Who and Cream. Since they actually played in both styles there may have been some conflict among fans about their image.

The band members often complained that Kurland restricted the number of concerts they played; Thom Mooney said in a late 1968 interview that &quot;We haven&#x27;t played a lot of dates yet, as our management didn&#x27;t want us overexposed.&quot; In a 2019 interview, however, Mooney challenged this complaint by the band, saying that they did have a reasonably loaded tour schedule and that the only reason management did not book them at more shows was because they could not play at bars, being underage.

The group signed with SGC Records, which released &quot;Nazz&quot; in October 1968. There was talk of putting the album out on the Colgems label, but the band objected to this as they did not want to be seen as another Monkees, who recorded for Colgems.

===&quot;Nazz Nazz&quot; and &quot;Nazz III&quot;===
An attempt at recording in England in January 1969 was cut short when the Musicians&#x27; Union found they had not obtained proper permission to record in the country, though before returning to the United States the Nazz did a shopping spree to update their wardrobe, building their definitive look. The Nazz then recorded their second album in Los Angeles in late 1968 and early 1969. Sources have claimed the album was originally called &quot;Fungo Bat&quot;, but Rundgren, Stewkey, and Mooney have all said &quot;Fungo Bat&quot; was just a working title. (A fungo bat is a special baseball bat used only for practice; it is not intended to hit pitched balls.)

Due to tensions which emerged during the recording of the album, Van Osten left shortly after it was completed. The Nazz then played a few shows as a trio, with temporary bassists filling Van Osten&#x27;s slot, before Rundgren quit as well. At this point, the Nazz&#x27;s second album had still yet to be released. At Stewkey and Mooney&#x27;s request, the planned double album was shortened to a single LP before being released as &quot;Nazz Nazz&quot; in May 1969. Much of what was cut was piano-based Rundgren material, influenced by singer/songwriter Laura Nyro - a far cry from the group&#x27;s original Beatles-Who-Yardbirds-Cream derived sound. For a short time the Nazz continued as a duo, touring with support musicians now covering for both Rundgren and Van Osten, before formally dissolving.

In a 2002 interview Rundgren said of the Nazz&#x27;s career: &quot;It was brief and very intense. I&#x27;ve made peace with it, but a lot of potential was wasted. I don&#x27;t really blame any single person for that. I had a hard time focusing on the band, I continued to develop myself as a songwriter and a performer. Eventually everyone would feel like a backup band - I was writing the songs, producing the records. As time went on my presence was bound to distort the thing.&quot;

&quot;Nazz III&quot; was released in May 1971, over a year after the break-up. It consists primarily of material that was cut from the second album.

==Solo careers and legacy==
Rundgren had a successful career as a solo artist and with the band Utopia. His biggest solo hit was an up-tempo version of &quot;Hello It&#x27;s Me&quot;, from his 1972 &quot;Something/Anything?&quot; album, which peaked at #5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on 22 December 1973. 

Van Osten largely dropped out of music, and worked for decades with The Walt Disney Company producing comic books and other media.

Stewkey and Mooney reconnected and played with Fuse for a brief period using two names, Fuse or Nazz, depending on where they were gigging. Mooney would leave again, and Fuse evolved into &quot;Sick Man of Europe&quot;, and later (without Stewkey) Cheap Trick.

The Nazz proved influential on the emerging genre dubbed power pop, which featured melodic pop songwriting with a more aggressive performance style. They gained wider recognition thanks to the inclusion of &quot;Open My Eyes&quot; on &quot;&quot; (1972), an anthology of American 1960s garage punk and psychedelia compiled by musician Lenny Kaye. The three Nazz LPs were reissued by Rhino Records on LP in 1983 and subsequently on CD with bonus demo and outtake tracks. In 2009, Spectra Records released three albums by Nazz. They were &quot;Nazz vs. Toddzila,&quot; &quot;13th and Pine&quot;, (compilation) and &quot;Hello It&#x27;s Crazy Me&quot;. 

In 2011, the Bangles recorded &quot;Open My Eyes&quot; on their album &quot;Sweetheart of the Sun.&quot; The next year, King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard also recorded a cover of the song, for the &quot;Nuggets: Antipodean Interpolations Of The First Psychedelic Era&quot; compilation. 

==In popular culture==
* &quot;Open My Eyes&quot; and &quot;Wildwood Blues&quot; by the Nazz are featured on the soundtrack of &quot;The Mad Room&quot;, a 1969 horror movie directed by Bernard Girard.

<doc id="151774" wikidata="Q131306" url="?curid=151774" title="SPQR">
<text>SPQR or S.P.Q.R., an initialism for  (; ), is an emblematic phrase referring to the government of the Roman Republic. It appears on documents made public by an inscription in stone or metal, in dedications of monuments and public works, and on some Roman currency.

The full phrase appears in Roman political, legal, and historical literature, such as the speeches of Cicero and (&quot;Books from the Founding of the City&quot;) of Livy.

==Translation==

In Latin, &quot;&quot; is a nominative singular noun meaning &quot;Senate&quot;. &quot;Populusque&quot; is compounded from the nominative noun &quot;&quot;, &quot;the People&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, an enclitic particle meaning &quot;and&quot; which connects the two nominative nouns. The last word, &quot;&quot; (&quot;&quot;), is an adjective modifying the whole of &quot;Senātus Populusque&quot;: the &quot;Roman Senate and People&quot;, taken as a whole. Thus, the phrase is translated literally as &quot;The Roman Senate and People&quot;, or more freely as &quot;The Senate and People of Rome&quot;.

==Historical context==
The title&#x27;s date of establishment is unknown, but it first appears in inscriptions of the Late Republic, from around 80 BC onwards. Previously, the official name of the Roman state, as evidenced on coins, was simply &quot;ROMA&quot;. The abbreviation last appears on coins of Constantine the Great (ruled 312–337 AD), the first Roman emperor to support Christianity.

This signature continued in use under the Roman Empire. The emperors were considered the &quot;de jure&quot; representatives of the people even though the &quot;senātūs consulta&quot;, or decrees of the Senate, were made at the &quot;de facto&quot; pleasure of the emperor.

&quot;Populus Romanus&quot; in Roman literature is a phrase meaning the government of the People. When the Romans named governments of foreign states, they used &quot;populus&quot; in the singular or plural, such as &quot;populi Priscorum Latinorum&quot;, &quot;the governments of the Old Latins&quot;. &quot;Romanus&quot; is the established adjective used to distinguish the Romans, as in &quot;civis Romanus&quot;, &quot;Roman citizen&quot;.

The Roman people appear very often in law and history in such phrases as &quot;dignitas&quot;, &quot;maiestas&quot;, &quot;auctoritas&quot;, &quot;libertas populi Romani&quot;, the &quot;dignity, majesty, authority, freedom of the Roman people&quot;. They were a &quot;populus liber&quot;, &quot;a free people&quot;. There was an &quot;exercitus, imperium, iudicia, honores, consules, voluntas&quot; of this same &quot;populus&quot;: &quot;the army, rule, judgments, offices, consuls and will of the Roman people&quot;. They appear in early Latin as &quot;Popolus&quot; and &quot;Poplus&quot;, so the habit of thinking of themselves as free and sovereign was quite ingrained.

The Romans believed that all authority came from the people. It could be said that similar language seen in more modern political and social revolutions directly comes from this usage. People in this sense meant the whole government. The latter, however, was essentially divided into the aristocratic Senate, whose will was executed by the consuls and praetors, and the &quot;comitia centuriata&quot;, &quot;committee of the centuries&quot;, whose will came to be safeguarded by the Tribunes.

One of the ways the emperor Commodus (180–192) paid for his donatives and mass entertainments was to tax the senatorial order, and on many inscriptions, the traditional order is provocatively reversed (&quot;Populus Senatusque...&quot;).

==Medieval use==

Beginning in 1184, the Commune of Rome struck coins in the name of the SENATVS P Q R. From 1414 until 1517, the Roman Senate struck coins with a shield inscribed SPQR.

== Modern use ==

During the regime of Benito Mussolini, SPQR was emblazoned on a number of public buildings and manhole covers in an attempt to promote his dictatorship as a &quot;New Roman Empire&quot;.

Even in contemporary usage, SPQR is still used in the municipal coat of arms of Rome and as abbreviation for the comune of Rome in official documents. The Italians have long used a different and humorous expansion of this abbreviation, &quot;Sono Pazzi Questi Romani&quot; (). SPQR is also part of the coat of arms of the Capital Military Command of the Italian army (Italian: &quot;Comando Militare Capitale&quot;). 

In business, in English-speaking countries, SPQR is sometimes (humorously) used to mean &quot;Small Profits, Quick Returns&quot;, often by people who have studied Latin at school.

=== Civic references ===

&quot;SPQ&quot; is sometimes used as an assertion of municipal pride and civic rights. The Italian town of Reggio Emilia, for instance, has SPQR in its coat of arms, standing for . There are historic usages of the deployment of the &quot;SPQ&quot; format in various other European cities and towns:
=== Popular culture ===
SPQR is often used to represent the Roman Empire and Roman Republic, such as in video games and movies.
In the 2000 movie &quot;Gladiator&quot;, the Roman general Maximus (portrayed by Russell Crowe) has &quot;SPQR&quot; tattooed on his upper arm, which he removes by scraping after he is sold into slavery.

<text>Lamont Jody Hawkins (born November 10, 1970), better known by his stage name U-God, meaning Universal-God, is an American rapper and member of the hip hop collective Wu-Tang Clan. He has been with the group since its inception, and is known for his deep voice and rhythmic flow that can alternate between gruff and smooth.

== Early life ==
Hawkins was born in Brownsville, Brooklyn, New York City. He moved to Staten Island as a youth. He was originally a beatboxer for Cappadonna, and was friends with future members Method Man, Inspectah Deck and childhood friend of Raekwon. Sometime before the members united, U-God was mentored in rap by Cappadonna. He soon became friends with RZA and Ghostface Killah, and he began rhyming under the alias Golden Arms, based on the Kung-Fu movie &quot;Kid with the Golden Arm&quot;. Later on he changed his name to U-God (which is short for his Five-Percent Nation righteous name &quot;Universal God Allah&quot;).

== Career ==

=== &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot; / &quot;Wu-Tang Forever&quot; ===
U-God was convicted on the grounds of firearm and drug possession charges on April 17, 1992, and was paroled in January 1993. His incarceration prevented him from attending the group&#x27;s debut album &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot; recording sessions for the most part, his input on the seminal LP consisting of only a short bridge on the group&#x27;s debut single &quot;Protect Ya Neck&quot; as well as the fan-favorite opening verse of &quot;Da Mystery of Chessboxin&#x27;&quot;. Nevertheless, after his release, he quickly became known to fans for his rugged flow and bass-like voice on Wu tracks such as &quot;Winter Warz&quot;, &quot;Knuckleheadz&quot;, &quot;Investigative Reports&quot;, and &quot;Black Jesus&quot;. He was featured heavily on the group&#x27;s second album &quot;Wu-Tang Forever&quot;, on which he was one of only four of the group to get a solo track – &quot;Black Shampoo&quot; (the others being Inspectah Deck with &quot;The City&quot;, RZA with &quot;Sunshower&quot; and Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard with &quot;Dog Shit&quot;).

=== &quot;Golden Arms Redemption&quot; ===
U-God was the eighth member of the group to record a solo album, releasing &quot;Golden Arms Redemption&quot; in 1999 on Priority Records, which displayed a wide variety of sounds from gritty blaxploitation funk to urgent string sections, and featured guest appearances from several Wu-Tang members and affiliates. It had two singles in &quot;Dat&#x27;s Gangsta&quot; and &quot;Bizarre&quot;. The song &quot;Rumble&quot; was used as the main song for the video game &quot;Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style&quot;. Bizarre debuted #7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Rap Singles, but soon after Priority Records was on the verge of shutting down. Still, the album managed to go Gold in sales. Based on the initial success, U-God was able to open his own label, Suppa Nigga Productions. He released his second album &quot;Mr. Xcitement&quot; in 2005.

=== &quot;Dopium&quot; and &quot;The Keynote Speaker&quot; ===

In 2009 U-God released the album &quot;Dopium&quot; and had the lead single &quot;Wu-Tang&quot; featuring Method Man. The album featured guest appearances by Sheek Louch, Jim Jones, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, GZA, Cappadonna, Killah Priest and Scotty Wotty with production by Bloody Beat Roots, Felix Cartel and Large Professor. In 2013 U-God announced a new album &quot;The Keynote Speaker&quot; with production by RZA who also served as the albums executive producer. The album was released on July 23, 2013, by RZA&#x27;s Soul Temple Records with guest appearances from Styles P, Kool Keith, Method Man, RZA, GZA and Inspectah Deck.

=== &quot;Venom&quot; and autobiographical book ===
On December 13, 2016, U-God released through Babygrande Records&#x27; SoundCloud account a song &quot;Venom&quot; and announced that his new album, also called &quot;Venom&quot;, would be released soon. On September 25, 2017, he added a tweet in which he announced that he had finished his autobiography entitled &quot;&quot; and it would be released along with his new album in March 2018. On February 2, 2018, he released a free mixtape &quot;Bring Back God II&quot; through DatPiff platform. &quot;Venom&quot; was released on March 30, 2018 and debuted at #34 on the U.S. Rap Albums Chart.

<doc id="151783" wikidata="Q470877" url="?curid=151783" title="Stirling's approximation">
<text>In mathematics, Stirling&#x27;s approximation (or Stirling&#x27;s formula) is an asymptotic approximation for factorials. It is a good approximation, leading to accurate results even for small values of formula_1. It is named after James Stirling, though a related but less precise result was first stated by Abraham de Moivre.

One way of stating the approximation involves the logarithm of the factorial:
formula_2
where the big O notation means that, for all sufficiently large values of formula_1, the difference between formula_4 and formula_5 will be at most proportional to the logarithm of formula_1. In computer science applications such as the worst-case lower bound for comparison sorting, it is convenient to instead use the binary logarithm, giving the equivalent form
formula_7 The error term in either base can be expressed more precisely as formula_8, corresponding to an approximate formula for the factorial itself,
formula_9
Here the sign formula_10 means that the two quantities are asymptotic, that is, their ratio tends to 1 as formula_1 tends to infinity.

== Derivation ==
Roughly speaking, the simplest version of Stirling&#x27;s formula can be quickly obtained by approximating the sum
formula_12
with an integral:
formula_13

The full formula, together with precise estimates of its error, can be derived as follows. Instead of approximating formula_14, one considers its natural logarithm, as this is a slowly varying function:
formula_15

The right-hand side of this equation minus
formula_16
is the approximation by the trapezoid rule of the integral
formula_17

and the error in this approximation is given by the Euler–Maclaurin formula:
formula_18

where formula_19 is a Bernoulli number, and is the remainder term in the Euler–Maclaurin formula. Take limits to find that
formula_20

Denote this limit as formula_21. Because the remainder in the Euler–Maclaurin formula satisfies
formula_22

where big-O notation is used, combining the equations above yields the approximation formula in its logarithmic form:
formula_23

Taking the exponential of both sides and choosing any positive integer formula_24, one obtains a formula involving an unknown quantity formula_25. For , the formula is
formula_26

The quantity formula_25 can be found by taking the limit on both sides as formula_1 tends to infinity and using Wallis&#x27; product, which shows that formula_29. Therefore, one obtains Stirling&#x27;s formula:
formula_30

== Alternative derivations ==
An alternative formula for formula_14 using the gamma function is
formula_32
(as can be seen by repeated integration by parts). Rewriting and changing variables , one obtains
formula_33
Applying Laplace&#x27;s method one has
formula_34
which recovers Stirling&#x27;s formula:
formula_35

=== Higher orders ===
In fact, further corrections can also be obtained using Laplace&#x27;s method. From previous result, we know that formula_36, so we &quot;peel off&quot; this dominant term, then perform two changes of variables, to obtain:formula_37To verify this: formula_38.

Now the function formula_39 is unimodal, with maximum value zero. Locally around zero, it looks like formula_40, which is why we are able to perform Laplace&#x27;s method. In order to extend Laplace&#x27;s method to higher orders, we perform another change of variables by formula_41. This equation cannot be solved in closed form, but it can be solved by serial expansion, which gives us formula_42. Now plug back to the equation to obtainformula_43notice how we don&#x27;t need to actually find formula_44, since it is cancelled out by the integral. Higher orders can be achieved by computing more terms in formula_45, which can be obtained programmatically.

Thus we get Stirling&#x27;s formula to two orders:formula_46

=== Complex-analytic version ===
A complex-analysis version of this method is to consider formula_47 as a Taylor coefficient of the exponential function formula_48, computed by Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula as
formula_49
where denotes the Stirling numbers of the first kind. From this one obtains a version of Stirling&#x27;s series
formula_50
which converges when . 
Stirling&#x27;s formula may also be given in convergent form as
formula_51
where 
formula_52

==Versions suitable for calculators==
The approximation
formula_53
and its equivalent form
formula_54
can be obtained by rearranging Stirling&#x27;s extended formula and observing a coincidence between the resultant power series and the Taylor series expansion of the hyperbolic sine function. This approximation is good to more than 8 decimal digits for with a real part greater than 8. Robert H. Windschitl suggested it in 2002 for computing the gamma function with fair accuracy on calculators with limited program or register memory.

Gergő Nemes proposed in 2007 an approximation which gives the same number of exact digits as the Windschitl approximation but is much simpler:
formula_55
or equivalently,
formula_56

An alternative approximation for the gamma function stated by Srinivasa Ramanujan in Ramanujan&#x27;s lost notebook is
formula_57
for . The equivalent approximation for has an asymptotic error of and is given by
formula_58

The approximation may be made precise by giving paired upper and lower bounds; one such inequality is
formula_59

== History ==
The formula was first discovered by Abraham de Moivre in the form
formula_60

De Moivre gave an approximate rational-number expression for the natural logarithm of the constant. Stirling&#x27;s contribution consisted of showing that the constant is precisely formula_61.

<text>Veruca Salt is an American alternative rock band founded in Chicago in 1992 by vocalist-guitarists Nina Gordon and Louise Post, drummer Jim Shapiro, and bassist Steve Lack. They are best known for their first single, &quot;Seether&quot;, which was released on the 1994 album &quot;American Thighs&quot;. That success was followed up with 1997&#x27;s &quot;Eight Arms to Hold You&quot;. By 1998, Post was the only original member still in the band and continued on with other musicians. Veruca Salt released the album &quot;Resolver&quot; in 2000 and the album &quot;IV&quot; in 2006. After a hiatus in 2012, the band reformed with its original lineup. Their fifth studio album, &quot;Ghost Notes&quot;, was released in 2015.

==History==
=== 1992–1998: Formation and mainstream success ===
Named after Veruca Salt, the spoiled rotten rich girl from the 1964 children&#x27;s book &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; by Roald Dahl, Veruca Salt was formed in Chicago in 1992 by Louise Post (guitar and vocals) and Nina Gordon (guitar and vocals). Post and Gordon were introduced through mutual friend Lili Taylor, and began playing music together. They wrote songs for a year and a half before placing an ad in the Chicago Sun-Times for an all-female rhythm section. Instead the band was joined by Gordon&#x27;s brother Jim Shapiro on drums and Steve Lack on bass. Songwriting was shared between Gordon and Post, though the two seldom collaborated. Rather, each would typically submit a complete song to the group and sing the lead vocals on that song, while the other would record backing vocals.

The band had performed a handful of shows when Jim Powers of Minty Fresh Records asked them to sign. The band&#x27;s first release was the single &quot;Seether&quot;/&quot;All Hail Me&quot; on Minty Fresh Records, in 1994. The single was a success and Veruca Salt accompanied Hole on a tour, before releasing their first full-length album, &quot;American Thighs&quot;. The album which included &quot;Seether&quot; and &quot;All Hail Me&quot;, eventually reached Gold status. In a 2014 retrospective, music magazine &quot;Paste&quot; listed &quot;Seether&quot; as number 10 and &quot;All Hail Me&quot; as number 39 on their list of the 50 greatest grunge songs of all time.

After signing to Geffen Records, the band quickly gained in popularity as &quot;Seether&quot; became an MTV hit. A second single, &quot;Number One Blind&quot; was released along with a music video directed by Steve Hanft. The band was unsure about the video and pulled it from MTV in a panic. As a result, Geffen ceased any further marketing for &quot;American Thighs&quot;.

A stop-gap EP which was recorded by Steve Albini, &quot;Blow It Out Your Ass It&#x27;s Veruca Salt&quot;, was released in 1996. In 1996, Veruca Salt appeared as Pavement&#x27;s replacement band in their video &quot;Painted Soldiers&quot;.

Veruca Salt&#x27;s second album, &quot;Eight Arms to Hold You&quot;, was produced by Bob Rock and released in 1997. Lead single &quot;Volcano Girls&quot; gained exposure as the opening theme to the teen comedy film &quot;Jawbreaker&quot;.

Veruca Salt performed another single, &quot;Shutterbug&quot;, on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;; instead of the featured musical group performing two songs as had been a tradition, the musical performances were split between Sting and Veruca Salt. This change was announced at the last minute between the dress rehearsal and the live show, at the behest of Sting to producer Lorne Michaels.

Shapiro left the band soon after the release of &quot;Eight Arms&quot;, due to unease with having to learn how to play drums – an instrument he had only started playing when asked to join the band – while under public scrutiny. Shapiro was replaced by Stacy Jones (of Letters to Cleo and American Hi-Fi). Jones toured with the band on the &quot;Eight Arms&quot; tour and appeared in the music videos for &quot;Volcano Girls&quot; and &quot;Shutterbug&quot;. In 1997, Veruca Salt opened for the band Bush in a North American tour.

===1998–2012: Gordon&#x27;s departure and reformation===
Gordon and Post started working together on Veruca Salt&#x27;s third album. However, after an argument between the two, Gordon left the band to pursue a solo career in 1998. (Gordon&#x27;s first album, &quot;Tonight and the Rest of My Life&quot;, was released in 2000 and featured drumming by Stacy Jones, who had also left Veruca Salt and was in a relationship with Gordon). The dispute between Gordon and Post has been described as &quot;one of the greatest rock soap operas since Fleetwood Mac or Hüsker Dü.&quot;

Post, as the only remaining band member, contributed the song &quot;Somebody&quot; to the Depeche Mode tribute album &quot;For the Masses&quot; before recruiting a new lineup. Guitarist Stephen Fitzpatrick joined and went on to become one of Post&#x27;s principal songwriting partners during the next decade. Jimmy Madla and Suzanne Sokol joined on drums and bass guitar, respectively. Most of the band&#x27;s record label support had been fired during the Universal/PolyGram merger, so Post left Geffen Records, formed her own Velveteen Records label, and signed a distribution deal with Beyond Music. The reformed band released the album &quot;Resolver&quot;, which spawned both a single and video for &quot;Born Entertainer&quot; in May 2000.

Sokol left the band at the end of 2000 and was replaced by Post&#x27;s friend Gina Crosley. The band continued to tour through the summer of 2001 in the UK. Post and Crosley also attempted to form a supergroup with Courtney Love of Hole and others but the project soon imploded. This allowed the pair to focus on new material for Veruca Salt which eventually yielded the &quot;Officially Dead&quot; EP that was primarily distributed during the band&#x27;s 2003 tour of Australia. That tour was precipitated by the title track (which had been released on the Resolver LP three years prior) charting on the Triple J Top 100, peaking at #13.

By 2005, Madla left to enter the restaurant business and Crosley was also dismissed. They were replaced in the studio by Solomon Snyder and Michael Miley, respectively. Veruca Salt began 2005 by touring Australia, undertaking both headline festival appearances and club shows. This session resulted in the &quot;Lords of Sounds and Lesser Things&quot; &quot;(LOSALT)&quot;. The band went on tour with Post, Fitzpatrick, drummer Kellii Scott, and bassist Nicole Fiorentino. &quot;LOSALT&quot; was released independently by the band and included six new songs. The EP&#x27;s title is an extract from Zora Neale Hurston&#x27;s &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot;. This lineup then recorded a full-length album, &quot;IV&quot;, and released it in September 2006 (like &quot;Resolver&quot; before it, this album was released a month apart from a Nina Gordon solo album). The band then went on what would prove to be the last tour of Louise Post&#x27;s solo incarnation of the band. A single, &quot;So Weird&quot;, was released to radio at the end of October 2006, but despite being critically well-received, neither the song nor the album did well commercially.

In 2007, the band recorded a cover of Neil Young&#x27;s song &quot;Burned&quot; for a 2007 breast cancer benefit album and then went almost entirely dormant. Post took time to have a child while Fiorentino went on to play bass with the Smashing Pumpkins and The Cold and Lovely. Kellii Scott returned to his original band, Failure. On March 14, 2012, the band announced on their official website that they were on an indefinite hiatus.

===2013–present: Original lineup reunion===
On March 15, 2013, Veruca Salt announced the reunion of its original line-up (Nina Gordon, Louise Post, Jim Shapiro, and Steve Lack) with a message on the band&#x27;s official Facebook page which read, &quot;for now let&#x27;s just say this: hatchets buried, axes exhumed.&quot; The band also mentioned that they might be open to adding material from their time apart into their sets at some point. The reunion marked the first time Shapiro would play drums since leaving the band in 1997. It had also been years since Lack played bass, with his time out of the band spent on overcoming drug and alcohol abuse and pursuing surfing.

On September 29, 2013, the band announced via social media that they were working on new material. Their first release since reforming came in the form of a release for Record Store Day 2014. The band released a 10-inch vinyl EP, MMXIV, which contained two new songs, &quot;It&#x27;s Holy&quot; and &quot;The Museum of Broken Relationships&quot;, on one side and a 20th-anniversary re-release of &quot;Seether&quot; on the other. The band then toured both the United States and a nine-date sold-out tour of Australia.

On May 19, 2015, the band announced the release of their fifth album, &quot;Ghost Notes&quot;. The album, released on July 10, 2015, was the first to feature the band&#x27;s original lineup since 1997&#x27;s &quot;Eight Arms to Hold You&quot;. Post and Gordon appeared on Ken Reid&#x27;s TV Guidance Counselor Podcast on August 7, 2015, and revealed that Veruca Salt were approached to host a Fox comedy variety show in the 1990s.

In March 2017, the band reunited with Nicole Fiorentino for a one-off performance at a Planned Parenthood charity event; Patty Schemel, formerly of Hole, filled in on drums. The band returned to Australia in February 2018 for a series of headline shows, as well as being part of the mini-festival &quot;A Day on the Green&quot; alongside The Fauves, Tumbleweed, The Lemonheads, Spiderbait and The Living End. Veruca Salt teamed up with Rock the Vote for the 2018 American election, releasing a track titled &quot;Low Grade Fever&quot; from the &quot;Ghost Notes&quot; recording sessions.

In June 2022, Louise Post released &quot;But I Love You Without Mascara (Demos ’97-’98)&quot; which featured several unreleased demos from the transitional period between &quot;Eight Arms to Hold You&quot; and &quot;Resolver&quot;. She also released a solo album in June 2023 called Sleepwalker.

<text>Alfred Charles Auguste Foucher (1865–1952), was a French scholar, who argued that the Buddha image has Greek origins. He has been called the &quot;father of Gandhara studies&quot;, and is a much-cited scholar on ancient Buddhism in northwest Indian subcontinent and the Hindu Kush region.

== Travels ==
He made his first trip to northeastern India in 1895. In 1910 he examined the Great Zimbabwe and the Khami ruins, proclaiming both were made by Phoenicians. His views on ruins in southern Africa are not considered accurate by modern scholars. In 1922 he was asked by the governments of France and Afghanistan to organize an archeological co-operative which became the &quot;French Archaeological Delegation in Afghanistan (DAFA)&quot;.
Foucher&#x27;s most famous work was &quot;L&#x27;Art Gréco-Bouddhique du Gandhara&quot; in which he described how Buddhist art prior to Pan-Hellenism was principally aniconic, representing the Buddha by depicting elements of the Buddha&#x27;s life instead of depicting the Buddha himself. Foucher argued that the first sculpted images of the Buddha were heavily influenced by Greek artists. He coined the term &quot;Greco-Buddhist art&quot;.

Foucher especially considered Hellenistic free-standing Buddhas as &quot;the most beautiful, and probably the most ancient of the Buddhas&quot;, assigning them to the 1st century BCE, and making them the starting point of the anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha (&quot;The Buddhist art of Gandhara&quot;, Marshall, p101).

Following the mid-20th century discovery of Roman trading posts in Southern India, Foucher&#x27;s argument was revised in favour of Roman influence, as opposed to Greek.

New archeological discoveries in Central Asia however (such as the Hellenistic city of Ai-Khanoum and the excavation of Sirkap in modern Pakistan), have been pointing to rich Greco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek civilizations in these areas, reviving the Hellenistic thesis. Nonetheless, his central thesis that the Buddha was of Classical origin has become established. For a compelling counter-argument to Foucher&#x27;s essay, see Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, &quot;The Origin of the Buddha Image&quot;.

<text>The Bandidos Motorcycle Club, also known as the Bandido Nation, is an outlaw motorcycle club with a worldwide membership. Formed in San Leon, Texas, in 1966, the Bandidos MC is estimated to have between 2,000 and 2,500 members and 303 chapters located in 22 countries, making it the second-largest motorcycle club in the world behind the Hells Angels.

Numerous law enforcement and international intelligence agencies classify the Bandidos as an organized crime syndicate.

==History==
The Bandidos Motorcycle Club was founded by 36-year-old dockworker Donald Eugene Chambers on March 4, 1966, in San Leon, Texas. Chambers named the club in honor of the Mexican bandits who lived by their own rules, and he recruited members from biker bars locally in Houston as well as in Corpus Christi, Galveston, and San Antonio. Like other outlaw motorcycle clubs, they call themselves &quot;one percenters&quot;, a phrase coined by the former president of the American Motorcyclist Association who once stated that 99 percent of motorcyclists were law-abiding citizens and 1 percent &quot;outlaws&quot;. By the early 1970s, the club had over one hundred members, including many Vietnam War veterans.

Ronald Jerome Hodge took over from Chambers as the Bandidos&#x27; president in 1972. Hodge was nicknamed &quot;Mr. Prospect&quot; because of the short amount of time in which he was awarded his club membership, and he later became known as &quot;Step Mother&quot; in deference to Chambers&#x27; moniker &quot;Mother&quot;. Under Hodge&#x27;s leadership, the Bandidos became an international motorcycle club when the first foreign chapter was established in Sydney, Australia in 1983. The Australian branch was founded by Anthony Mark Spencer, who had previously encountered Bandidos members during a visit to the United States. Hodge was sentenced to five years in prison in December 1988 for conspiring to bomb homes and automobiles belonging to members of a rival club, and he died of heart disease in 1992.

In 1989, the club was established in Europe when a chapter was formed in Marseille, France. Subsequent expansion into the Nordic countries in the 1990s led to a violent feud with the Hells Angels. The third Bandidos international president, James Edward Lang, as well as his successor, Charles Craig Johnston, were each sentenced to ten years&#x27; imprisonment on drug charges in November 1998. George Wegers, who served as international president between 1998 and 2005, was convicted of racketeering charges in October 2006.

The Bandidos embarked on a failed endeavour to establish themselves in Canada after merging with the Montreal-based Rock Machine Motorcycle Club in 2000. The Bandidos ceded Quebec to the Hells Angels at the conclusion of the province&#x27;s deadliest biker war in 2003. In 2007, the Bandidos&#x27; Canadian chapters went defunct following the internal Shedden massacre.

According to the club&#x27;s website, the Bandidos&#x27; Western Hemisphere chapters became autonomous from the international chapters in Europe and Australia on July 17, 2007. The American chapters began wearing a redesigned patch in 2011.

==Insignia==

The Bandidos&#x27; insignia, known as the &quot;Fat Mexican&quot;, consists of a caricature of a Mexican bandit wearing a sombrero and holding a sword in one hand and a pistol in the other. The design is credited to the club&#x27;s founder, Donald Chambers. The &quot;Fat Mexican&quot; bears a resemblance to the Frito Bandito – a cartoon mascot of the Fritos corn chips brand – and according to Bandidos lore, Chambers took the club&#x27;s name and logo from the mascot. However, the Frito Bandito was not developed until 1967, the year after the Bandidos&#x27; foundation. In addition to the &quot;Fat Mexican&quot; and diamond-shaped &quot;1%er&quot; emblems, club members also wear other patches on leather or denim vests – known as &quot;colors&quot;. These patches consist of red lettering displayed on a gold background. The Bandidos&#x27; color scheme was inspired by that of the United States Marine Corps and chosen by Chambers, a Marine Corps veteran of the Vietnam War. Patches denoting a member&#x27;s rank and chapter are worn, as are various other patches which have specific meanings. Although the particular meaning of each patch is not publicly known, various law enforcement agencies have identified Bandidos patches which they believe are related to criminal activity. For example, police have reported that the &quot;Expect No Mercy&quot; patch is awarded to those who have committed murder on behalf of the club, while the &quot;TCB&quot; (&quot;Taking Care of Business&quot;) patch is worn by club officers and nomads. Similar to the &quot;Expect No Mercy&quot; patch, the &quot;CDG&quot; (&quot;Coup de Grâce&quot;) patch reportedly signifies a member who has committed a significant act of violence.

The Bandidos&#x27; mottos include &quot;Cut one, we all bleed&quot;, &quot;God forgives, Bandidos don&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;Our colors don&#x27;t run&quot; and &quot;We are the people our parents warned us about&quot;. Another, more generic, saying of the club is &quot;Bandidos forever, forever Bandidos&quot; (&quot;BFFB&quot;).

==Membership==
Bandidos members must be male and own at least one Harley-Davidson motorcycle (although other American-made motorcycles can also be allowed). Prospective members must undertake a three-stage process before being initiated, beginning as a &quot;hangaround&quot;, before becoming a &quot;prospect&quot; and then &quot;probation&quot;. The length of this process is decided by each chapter president, and ends when the chapter&#x27;s members vote unanimously to allow the probationary member to enter the club. A screening process is carried out to prevent infiltration by law enforcement. Upon joining the Bandidos, each member must sign their motorcycle over to the club.

Each club chapter follows a structured hierarchy, with a president, vice-president, sergeant-at-arms, road captain and secretary/treasurer. Members must abide by various by-laws, such as not wearing the club patch while riding in a car or truck, and are required to attend meetings (known as &quot;Church&quot;) four times per month. These rules also dictate that any member who fails to attend mandatory group motorcycle rides is fined and must forfeit the title of his motorcycle. Another requirement is that Bandidos must follow the philosophy &quot;All members are your brothers and your family&quot;, and must &quot;not fear authority and have a general disdain for the rules of society&quot;. Any member who cooperates with law enforcement, for example, is susceptible to disciplinary action. All Bandidos regalia, including tattoos, is considered club property. Membership fees are required, and are used to cover club expenses, such as funeral costs, and contribute to a legal defense fund. Club bylaws state that any member who commits suicide will not receive a Bandidos funeral.

The Bandidos have an estimated membership of between 2,000 and 2,500 worldwide. In the United States, the majority of the club consists of white and Hispanic males.

==Organization==
The Bandidos Motorcycle Club is organized by local chapters, with state and regional officers, as well as a national chapter made up of four regional vice-presidents and a national president. The leadership of the club consists of an international president, known as &quot;El Presidente&quot;, who has authority over every club chapter. The club also has Nomad chapters, made up of members not bound by geographical location, which are responsible for security, counterintelligence and internal discipline. The Bandidos&#x27; &quot;mother chapter&quot; is based in Houston, Texas.

The club has 303 chapters worldwide, located in twenty-two countries in North America, Oceania, Europe and Asia.

===North America===
The United States is home to 93 Bandidos chapters, located in sixteen states. The club is concentrated in Texas but extends into Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, New Mexico, Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, Utah, Idaho, Nevada, Washington and Oklahoma. The Bandidos incorporated in Texas as a non-profit organization in 1978. The club has subsequently incorporated in other states, including Washington and Alabama.

The Bandidos expanded into Canada following a merger with the Rock Machine Motorcycle Club in Quebec in 2000. After establishing further chapters in Ontario, Alberta and Manitoba, the club&#x27;s operations in Canada ceased in November 2007 as a result of infighting, law enforcement efforts, and pulled status from the club&#x27;s American leadership.

In 2004, the Bandidos formed a chapter in Costa Rica.

===Oceania===
The first Australian chapter was formed in 1983, in Sydney, by former members of the Comanchero Motorcycle Club. The club has since expanded substantially in Australia and there are forty-five Bandidos chapters throughout the country.

The Bandidos have a small but growing presence in New Zealand after a rocky start in 2012. They claim to have more than a dozen patched members and prospects in the Christchurch area.

===Europe===

There are approximately ninety Bandidos chapters in Europe. The first European chapter opened in Marseille in France in 1989. This was followed by expansion into the Nordic countries, with branches being established in Denmark in 1993, Sweden in 1994, and Finland and Norway in 1995.

The German department of the Bandidos was chartered in 2000. Chapters were then founded in Italy in 2001 and on the Channel Islands in 2003.

The Bandidos formed its first chapter in the Netherlands in 2014. The club was prohibited in the country in 2017, however.

In recent years the club has also expanded heavily into Spain, Belgium, Estonia, Greece, England and Ireland. Additionally, it is reportedly considering establishing a presence in Russia and Eastern Europe.

===Asia===
In 2001, the Bandidos were established in Thailand via a merger with the Diablos Motorcycle Club in Pattaya. The club further expanded to Malaysia and Singapore in 2006.

===Support clubs===
Like other major motorcycle clubs, the Bandidos also have a number of &quot;support&quot; clubs. These groups usually wear reverse colors (gold border with red background rather than the Bandidos&#x27; red-border–and–gold background). They also commonly wear a unique patch (known as the &quot;Heart Patch&quot;) consisting of a round patch in Bandidos colors on the front upper left of the colors (vest), as worn by the member. Most of these clubs are regional.

==Criminal allegations and incidents==

The United States Department of Justice, the Criminal Intelligence Service Canada, Europol and the Australian Federal Police consider the Bandidos to be a criminal organization. Law enforcement agencies in the United States also identify the Bandidos as one of the &quot;big four&quot; motorcycle gangs, along with the Hells Angels, the Outlaws and the Pagans, and contend that the club is responsible for organized crime activity such as drug dealing, arms trafficking, prostitution, extortion, money laundering and murder. In Australia, the Bandidos are included among the &quot;big six&quot;, with the Hells Angels, the Comanchero, the Finks, the Mongols and the Rebels.

While individual chapters had previously been banned in Germany, the Netherlands became the first country to prohibit the club as a whole in December 2017 when a court in Utrecht outlawed both the Dutch department of the Bandidos and the international organization on the grounds that the club forms a threat to public order.

<text>François Xavier Tourte (1747 – 25 April 1835) was a French bow maker who made a number of significant contributions to the development of the bow of stringed instruments, and is considered to be the most important figure in the development of the modern bow. Because of this, he has often been called the Stradivari of the bow. 

==Development of the modern bow==
Tourte spent eight years as a watchmaker&#x27;s apprentice before finally becoming an apprentice to his luthier father, Nicolas Pierre Tourte &quot;père&quot; (c.1700 - 1764). After his father&#x27;s death, Tourte, in collaboration with the violin virtuoso G. B. Viotti, made important changes in the form of the bow in the Classical period between 1785 and 1790.

Tourte&#x27;s bows are made from pernambuco wood, the most usual form of wood used on professional bows today. Tourte&#x27;s bows tended to be heavier than previous models, with more wood at the tip of the bow counterbalanced by a heavier frog (the device connecting the hair to the stick at the end nearest the player&#x27;s hand).

They generally have a usable hair-length of around 65 cm, and the balance point is 19 cm from the frog. The bows were elegantly fluted through half, or sometimes the whole, of their length. The curve in the wood was created by heating the wood thoroughly and then bending it. Before Tourte, bows had been cut to the desired bend. The final important change credited to Tourte is the screw in the frog (or nut) to moderate the tension in the hair. This propelling and withdrawing screw is found on virtually all modern violin bows. He is also credited with the invention of the spreader block, which fixes the hair of the bow in a flat ribbon, and so prevents tangling.

At the height of his career, a single Tourte bow fetched 15 Louis d&#x27;Or. Tourte destroyed any bow that was not entirely faultless before it left his workshop. He never varnished his bows but only rubbed them with pumice powder and oil. The Tourte pattern was followed by Dominique Peccatte, Jacob Eury, Nicolas Maire, François Lupot, Nicolas Maline, Joseph Henry and Jean Pierre Marie Persois.

== Quotes ==
&quot;The French bow maker François-Xavier Tourte, more commonly known as François Tourte or Tourte le jeune, is often referred to as &#x27;the inventor of the modern bow,&#x27; or &#x27;the Stradivari of the bow.&#x27; His bows, dating from the end of the eighteenth century and the early decades of the nineteenth, had a marked effect upon the timbre of violins and upon performance practice, enabling new forms of expression and articulation to be developed, and in particular, facilitating the increased use of legato. François Joseph Fétis&#x27;s entry in the second, expanded edition of his &quot;Biographie Universelle des Musiciens et Bibliographie Générale de la Musique&quot; (1860–65) has until recently been the only source of biographical information about François Tourte. Some thirty documents recently discovered in French archives provide further fresh insight into this maker&#x27;s life and work.&quot;

&quot;Tourte - French family of bowmakers and luthiers. It Nicolas Pierre Tourte and his sons Nicolas Léonard and François Xavier and perhaps Charles Tourte, son of Nicolas Léonard. In addition, at least two channelled (canalé) bows dating from about 1750–60 exist bearing the brand-stamp A.TOURTE.&quot; - Paul Childs

<text>T-Mobile is the brand name used by some of the mobile communications subsidiaries of the German telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom AG in the Czech Republic (T-Mobile Czech Republic), Poland (T-Mobile Polska) and the United States (T-Mobile US).

The T-Mobile brand was introduced in 1996 and the name was previously used by subsidiaries in other countries, including Austria (now Magenta), Croatia (now Hrvatski Telekom), Germany (now Deutsche Telekom), Hungary (now Magyar Telekom), Montenegro (now Crnogorski Telekom), the Netherlands (now Odido), North Macedonia (now Makedonski Telekom), Slovakia (now Slovak Telekom), and the United Kingdom (now EE).

In 1999, Deutsche Telekom formed the holding company T-Mobile International AG for its mobile communications subsidiaries. From 2003 to 2007, T-Mobile International was one of Deutsche Telekom&#x27;s services, in addition to &quot;Broadband/Fixnet&quot;, &quot;Business Customers&quot; and &quot;Group HQ and Shared Services&quot;. In 2009, Deutsche Telekom transformed its structure to adopt a regional setup (Germany, Europe, US). By combining its previously separated fixed and mobile subsidiaries to form integrated local businesses, T-Mobile International itself was merged into Deutsche Telekom AG.

When T-Mobile International AG existed, the holding company was based in Bonn, Germany, and its subsidiaries operated GSM-, UMTS- and LTE-based cellular networks in Europe, the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The company had financial stakes in mobile operators in both Central and Eastern Europe. Globally, T-Mobile International&#x27;s subsidiaries had a combined total of approximately 230 million subscribers. It was the world&#x27;s thirteenth-largest mobile-phone service provider by subscribers, and the fourth-largest multinational after the UK&#x27;s Vodafone, India&#x27;s Airtel, and Spain&#x27;s Telefónica.

==History==


Germany&#x27;s first mobile-communications services were radiotelephone systems that were owned and operated by the state postal monopoly, &quot;Deutsche Bundespost&quot;. It launched the analog first-generation C-Netz (&quot;C Network&quot;, marketed as &quot;C-Tel&quot;), Germany&#x27;s first true mobile phone network in 1985.

On 1 July 1989, West Germany reorganized Deutsche Bundespost and consolidated telecommunications into a new unit, &quot;Deutsche Bundespost Telekom&quot;. On 1 July 1992, it began to operate Germany&#x27;s first GSM network, along with the C-Netz, as its &quot;DeTeMobil&quot; subsidiary. The GSM 900 MHz frequency band was referred to as the &quot;D-Netz&quot;, and Telekom named its service &quot;D1&quot;; the private consortium awarded the second license (now Vodafone Germany) chose the name &quot;D2&quot;. Deutsche Bundespost Telekom was renamed Deutsche Telekom AG on 1 January 1995 as part of phase two of the German communications reform. This process of deregulation continued in November 1996, when DT was privatized and had the largest European IPO at the time, with the stock abbreviation &#x27;DT 1&#x27;.

In December 1999, T-Mobile International AG &amp; Co. KG holding company was founded (later renamed T-Mobile International AG). In 2002, as DT consolidated its international operations, it anglicized the T-Mobil name to &quot;T-Mobile&quot;.

On 5 July 2005 Deutsche Telekom transformed its structure and adopted a regional setup (Germany, Europe, US). Where available, the local mobile businesses were combined with the respective local wireline businesses to follow the integrated business approach. In 2009 T-Mobile International AG was merged into Deutsche Telekom AG.

== Deutsche Telekom Mobile Operations ==

===Austria===

Until 2000, Magenta Telekom (known then as T-Mobile) was a shareholder of the former max.mobil. network. In April 2001, it acquired one hundred percent and subsequently introduced the T-Mobile brand in Austria by rebranding max.mobil. in April 2002 as T-Mobile Austria. It later rebranded again to Magenta Telekom on 6 May 2019, after acquiring the Austrian operations of UPC from Liberty Global in December 2017.

In 2005, it acquired former competitor tele.ring from &quot;Western Wireless International&quot;. It is now used as a discount brand. tele.ring is an Austrian mobile network operator. Since it was bought by Magenta Telekom (then T-Mobile) in 2006, it is no longer a legally independent company. Tele.ring is administratively independent and now acts primarily as a discount-offer, similar to Yesss and BoB of A1. In the past, tele.ring was known for their aggressive price-politics.

===Croatia===

T-Mobile entered the Croatian market in October 1999 when DT initially acquired a thirty-five percent interest in Hrvatski telekom, including its cell phone service provider &quot;Cronet&quot;. Two years later, DT signed an agreement with the Croatian government to acquire the additional 16 percent needed for a majority holding. In January 2003, Hrvatski Telekom assembled all of its mobile activities under a single brand &quot;HTmobile&quot;. Finally, in October 2004, &quot;HTmobile&quot; became &quot;T-Mobile Hrvatska&quot;, or &quot;T-Mobile Croatia&quot;, thus joining the global T-Mobile family also by name. Since January 1, 2010, Hrvatski Telekom and T-Mobile Croatia merged into one company on the Croatian market under the name Hrvatski Telekom (in English: Croatian Telecom); the T-Mobile brand remained active in the mobile-business area and T-Com in the fixed-business area until 2013 when they were replaced by unified brand &quot;Hrvatski Telekom&quot;.

===Czech Republic===

T-Mobile was previously known as &quot;Paegas&quot; in the Czech Republic. T-Mobile Czech Republic a.s. has been operating in the Czech market since 1996.
As of 31 December 2014, 6 million customers were using T-Mobile services.

T-Mobile Czech Republic a.s. operates a public mobile communications network on the GSM standard in the 900 and 1800 MHz bands and is also authorized to operate a UMTS network. On 19 October 2005, T-Mobile was the first operator in the Czech Republic to launch this third-generation technology under the name &quot;Internet 4G&quot;.

===Germany===

Germany&#x27;s initial mobile communications services were radiotelephone systems that were owned and operated by the state postal monopoly, &quot;Deutsche Bundespost&quot;. These early mobile communications networks were referred to as the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; networks.

Deutsche Bundespost Telekom built Germany&#x27;s first cellular mobile network, an analog, first-generation system referred to as the &quot;C&quot; network or C-Netz. The network became operational in 1985 and services were marketed under the C-Tel brand. Following German reunification in 1990, the &quot;C&quot; network was extended to the former East Germany.

On 1 July 1992, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom&#x27;s &quot;DeTeMobil&quot; subsidiary began operating Germany&#x27;s first GSM 900 MHz frequency cellular network, which the organization referred to as &quot;D-Netz&quot;. Digital GSM services were marketed under the &quot;D1&quot; brand and DeTeMobil continued to sell analog cellular services concurrently under the existing C-Tel brand. In 1994, DeTeMobil introduced short message service (SMS) services.

In 1996, DT began to brand its subsidiaries with the &quot;T-&quot; prefix, renaming the DeTeMobil subsidiary T-Mobil and rebranding the GSM cellular network &quot;T-D1&quot;. C-Netz was renamed to T-C-Tel. The T-C-Tel / C-Netz services were fully discontinued in 2000.

D1 introduced prepaid service called &quot;Xtra&quot; in 1997.

Despite the numerous changes in subsidiary names and brands, Germans sometimes continue to use the &quot;T-D1&quot; name within Germany and refer to T-Mobile as D1.
On 1 April 2010, after the T-Home and T-Mobile German operations merged to form Telekom Deutschland GmbH, a wholly owned DT subsidiary; the T-Mobile brand was discontinued in Germany and replaced with the Telekom brand.

===Hungary===

On 1 May 2004, the same day as Hungary joined the European Union, the former company, named &quot;Westel&quot; (which was owned entirely by the former Matáv) changed its name, and the entire marketing. Westel was the most popular cellphone network in Hungary at the time. The company was called &quot;T-Mobile Hungary&quot;, but after some financial decisions, as with the other &quot;T-&quot; companies, it formed to &quot;Magyar Telekom Nyrt. Mobil Szolgáltatások Üzletág&quot; (Hungarian Telekom, Mobile Services Business Unit), and its branding started to use &quot;Telekom&quot; instead of &quot;T-Mobile&quot;. T-Mobile also provides high-speed services, like EDGE, 3G, and HSDPA in Hungary&#x27;s major cities.

===North Macedonia===

In Republic of North Macedonia, T-Mobile was previously known as &quot;Mobimak&quot;. The company has been operating in the Macedonian market since 1996. On 7 September 2006, Mobimak accepted the international T-Mobile branding. By June 2007, T-Mobile reached one million subscribers, out of which 85 percent were active and using their services. T-Mobile MK covers 98 percent of the population. It has a GSM 900 licence, offers GPRS, MMS and mobile internet services using T-Mobile HotSpots and has implemented the EDGE fast mobile internet specification. T-Mobile Macedonia applied for a UMTS licence on 1 August 2007. From 1 July T-Mobile ceased to exist as a legal entity and was replaced by the Telekom brand. The carrier name is now &quot;Telekom MK&quot;.
The codes are 070/071/072.

===Montenegro===

The T-Mobile brand entered the Montenegrin market in 2006 through the acquisition of MoNet GSM mobile provider. T-Mobile Montenegro (&quot;T-Mobile Crna Gora&quot;) is fully owned by T-Crnogorski Telekom, which is itself owned by Magyar Telekom, a DT subsidiary. Although the acquisition by Magyar Telekom was done in 2005, it was not until 26 September 2006, that the MoNet GSM operator was re-branded as T-Mobile Montenegro.

MoNet GSM launched on July 1, 2000, as part of Telecom Montenegro. It became an independent incorporated limited-liability company a month later, on 1 August 2000. The company currently holds around 34 percent of the Montenegrin market and uses GSM 900, GPRS, and EDGE technologies. Since 21 June 2007, 3G/UMTS services have been available in larger cities as well as on the coast.

===Netherlands===

Deutsche Telekom entered the Dutch market by the acquisition of Ben on 20 September 2002. In 2007, T-Mobile Netherlands, a wholly owned subsidiary of T-Mobile International, acquired Orange Netherlands from France Télécom for EUR 1.33 billion. This makes it the third largest mobile telephone operator in the country behind KPN and Vodafone.

As part of an acquisition of Tele2 Netherlands by T-Mobile Netherlands, which was announced on December 15, 2017, the previous owner Tele2 AB became a 25% shareholder in T-Mobile Netherlands. The company is now called Odido.

===Poland===

T-Mobile Polska serves over thirteen million customers, and owns licenses for 900, 1800MHz bands which are used for GSM, 800, 900, 1800, 2100 2600MHz for LTE and 2100 (DSS), 3500MHz for 5G NR NSA. Formerly &quot;Era&quot;, rebranding took place on 5 June 2011. T-Mobile Poland with Orange Polska have consolidated their infrastructure.

===Romania===
Telekom Romania Mobile Communications S.A. is a mobile network company in Romania, wholly owned by OTE, which in turn is controlled by Deutsche Telekom, operating under Telekom brand. Telekom Romania Mobile had 3.5 million subscribers with 15% market share as of July 2021.

===Slovakia===

The T-Mobile brand entered the Slovak market in May 2005, after rebranding the EuroTel network from Eurotel Bratislava to &quot;T-Mobile Slovensko&quot; nowadays &quot;Telekom&quot;. The company Eurotel Bratislava was partially owned by Slovak Telekom, an incumbent fixed-line operator, which later acquired a one hundred percent stake in Eurotel Bratislava. T-Mobile International and DT never owned T-Mobile Slovensko directly; DT is partially owner of Slovak Telekom and thus T-Mobile International has procurement managing function within T-Mobile Slovensko. On 1 July 2010, Slovak Telekom and T-Mobile Slovensko merged into one company on the Slovak market under the name &quot;Telekom&quot;; T-Mobile brand no more remains active in the mobile-business area, as well as the T-Com in the fixed-business area.

The Telekom network provides services on three networks GSM (900/1800 MHz), UMTS (2100 MHz), Flash OFDM (450 MHz). Mobile data services are provided on 4G, 3G, GSM network with EDGE extension and on UMTS with DC-HSPA+ 42 Mbit/s and HSUPA 5,8 Mbit/s. Flash OFDM is one of two commercially successfully launched solely data networks in the world. It supports upload speed up to 5.8 Mbit/s.

===United Kingdom===

&quot;T-Mobile UK&quot; started life as &quot;Mercury One2One&quot;, the world&#x27;s first GSM 1800 mobile network. It was originally operated by the now-defunct Mercury Communications. Later known simply as &quot;one2one&quot;, it was purchased by DT in 1999 and rebranded as T-Mobile in 2002.

T-Mobile offered both pay-as-you-go and pay-monthly contract phones. T-Mobile launched their 3G UMTS services in the Autumn of 2003. T-Mobile UK&#x27;s network was also used as the backbone network behind the Virgin Mobile virtual network.

In late 2007, it was confirmed that the merger of the high-speed 3G and HSDPA networks operated by T-Mobile UK and 3 (UK) was to take place starting January 2008. This left T-Mobile and 3 with the largest HSDPA mobile phone network in the country. In 2009, France Télécom&#x27;s Orange and DT, T-Mobile&#x27;s parent, announced they were in advanced talks to merge their UK operations to create the UK&#x27;s largest mobile operator. In March 2010, the European Commission approved this merger on the condition that the combined company sell 25% of the spectrum it owns on the 1800 MHz radio band and amend a network sharing agreement with smaller rival 3. The merger was completed the following month, the new company&#x27;s name later being announced as EE. Orange and T-Mobile continued as separate brands in the market until 2015, both run by the new parent company.

T-Mobile UK and Orange UK announced on 15 February 2015 the sale of EE to BT Group for £12.5B and to take shares of 12% within the BT Group as part of the deal.

===United States===

T-Mobile US provides wireless voice, messaging, and data services in the United States mainland including Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands under the T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile brands. The company operates the second largest wireless network in the U.S. market with over 95 million customers and annual revenues of $32 billion. Its nationwide network reaches 98 percent of Americans, through its EDGE 2G/HSPA 3G/HSPA+ 4G/4G LTE networks, as well as through roaming agreements &quot;(see section: Radio frequency spectrum chart)&quot;. , J. D. Power and Associates, a global marketing-information-services firm, ranked the company highest among major wireless carriers for retail-store satisfaction four years consecutively and highest for wireless customer care two years consecutively.

The company owns licences to operate a 1900 MHz GSM PCS digital cellular network and AWS UMTS digital cellular networks using 600 MHz, 700 MHz, 850 MHz, 1700 MHz and 2100 MHz covering areas of the continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It provides coverage in areas where it does not own radio frequency spectrum licenses via roaming agreements with other operators of compatible networks. In addition to its cellular mobile network, T-Mobile US operates a nationwide Wi-Fi Internet-access network under the T-Mobile HotSpots brand. The T-Mobile HotSpot service offers access to a nationwide network of approximately 8,350 access points, installed in venues such as Starbucks coffeehouses, FedEx Office Office and Print Centers, Hyatt hotels and resorts, Red Roof Inns, Sofitel hotels, Novotel hotels, the airline clubs of American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and US Airways, and airports.

T-Mobile US, Inc. traces its roots to the 1994 establishment of VoiceStream Wireless PCS as a subsidiary of Western Wireless Corporation. Spun off from parent Western Wireless on 3 May 1999, VoiceStream Wireless Corporation was purchased by Deutsche Telekom on 31 May 2001, for $35 billion and renamed T-Mobile USA, Inc. in July 2002. This legacy is reflected in some mismatch between US and German T-Mobile service, notably the frequency mismatch making phones inoperative in the other country, and picture messaging issues (non-delivery of pictures in text messages) between those networks.

After a failed attempt by AT&amp;T in 2011 to purchase the company in a $39 billion stock and cash offer (which was withdrawn after being faced with significant regulatory and legal hurdles, along with heavy resistance from the U.S. government and the Sprint Corporation), T-Mobile USA announced its intent to merge with MetroPCS Communications, Inc., the sixth largest carrier in the U.S., to improve its competitiveness with other national carriers; the deal was approved by the Department of Justice and Federal Communications Commission in March 2013. The merger agreement gave Deutsche Telekom the option to sell its 72% stake in the merged company, valued at around $14.2 billion, to a third-party before the end of the 18-month lock-up period. On 1 May 2013, the combined company, now known as T-Mobile US, began trading on the New York Stock Exchange as a public company.

==== Merger with Sprint ====
On 29 April 2018, T-Mobile and Sprint announced a $26 billion merger deal, with the resulting company to operate under the name T-Mobile. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai announced that he would back the merger. On 11 February 2020, the deal was approved by a federal judge. The merger was completed on 1 April 2020 with Deutsche Telekom holding owning 43% of the company, SoftBank at 24% and the remaining 33% to the public shareholders.

As part of the merger, T-Mobile US acquired Assurance Wireless, the service subsidized by the federal Lifeline Assistance program, a government benefit program supported by the federal Universal Service Fund.

==Marketing==
The company prominently uses the color magenta in its marketing and is known to pursue legal action against other companies who attempt to use similar shades for their advertising.

The five-note T-Mobile audio logo was composed by Lance Massey in 1999, and was originally part of the song (&quot;Hello Hola&quot; by Clan Chi) used to promote DT&#x27;s Tour de France bicycle team.

===Sponsorships===
T-Mobile, specifically the T-Mobile US subsidiary in the United States, holds the naming rights to T-Mobile Arena on the Las Vegas Strip near Las Vegas, to T-Mobile Center in Kansas City and to T-Mobile Park in Seattle.

Deutsche Telekom, has served as the kit sponsor for German Bundesliga club Bayern Munich since 2002. T-Mobile was also the official sponsor of English Football League Championship side West Bromwich Albion from 2004 to 2008 and previously sponsored Rotherham United from 2002 to 2003 as well as Scottish Premier League clubs Rangers and Celtic.

T-Mobile co-sponsored Everton with the One2One brand and they also sponsored the 2002 FA Youth Cup Final. T-Mobile was also a kit sponsor for English club Birmingham City. The phone company is also involved in sponsoring leagues such as the Austrian Football Bundesliga, which is named the T-Mobile Bundesliga.

T-Mobile also has banner ads at some matches of Mexico&#x27;s top association football league, Liga MX, despite not having a presence in that country.

Since 2016, the wireless company has sponsored the Major League Baseball Home Run Derby.

<text>&quot;Our Fair City&quot; is a fantasy short story by Robert A. Heinlein, originally printed in &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, January 1949. The story involves an old parking lot attendant, his pet whirlwind (named Kitten), and a muckraking newspaper columnist who decide to &quot;clean up&quot; their city&#x27;s corrupt government by running the whirlwind for political office.

==Reception==
Alexei Panshin has called it an &quot;amiable trifle&quot;, while Brian Stableford has described it as an example of &quot;preliminary de-historicization followed by re-accommodation to American pragmatism&quot;.

==Origins==

Heinlein biographer William H. Patterson Jr. noted that Heinlein wrote the story in four days in October 1947, inspired by L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s decision to name a dust devil which was frequently present outside Heinlein&#x27;s apartment.

<text>&#x27;—And He Built a Crooked House—&#x27; is a science fiction short story by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, first published in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; in February 1941. It was reprinted in the anthology &quot;Fantasia Mathematica&quot; (Clifton Fadiman, ed.) in 1958, and in the Heinlein collections &quot;The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag&quot; in 1959 and &quot;The Best of Robert Heinlein&quot; in 1973. The story is about a mathematically inclined architect named Quintus Teal who has what he thinks is a brilliant idea to save on real estate costs by building a house shaped like the unfolded net of a tesseract. The title is paraphrased from the nursery rhyme &quot;There Was a Crooked Man&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Quintus Teal, a &quot;Graduate Architect&quot; in the Los Angeles area, wants architects to be inspired by topology and the Picard–Vessiot theory. During a conversation with friend Homer Bailey he shows models made of toothpicks and clay, representing projections of a four-dimensional tesseract, the equivalent of a cube, and convinces Bailey to build one. The house is quickly constructed in an &quot;inverted double cross&quot; shape (having eight cubical rooms, arranged as a stack of four cubes with a further four cubes surrounding the second cube up on the stack). The night before Teal is to show Bailey and his wife, Matilda, around the house, an earthquake occurs. The three of them arrive the next morning to find what appears to be just a single cubical room. 

Inside, they find the upper floors completely intact, but the stairs seem to form a closed loop. As all the doors and windows lead directly into other spaces, there seems to be no way to get back out. At one point, they look down a hallway and are shocked to see their own backs. Teal realizes that the earthquake caused the house to fold into an actual tesseract.

In attempting to move from one room to another by way of a French window, Teal falls outside and lands in shrubbery. Exploring further, they find that the windows of the original top room do not connect where they mathematically &quot;should&quot;. One gives a dizzying view from above the Empire State Building, another an upside-down view of a seascape. A third window looks out on a place of no-space, with no color, not even black. The fourth window looks out on an unearthly desert scene. Just then another earthquake hits, and so they exit in a panic through the open window. They find themselves in a desert with twisted, tree-like vegetation around them, with no sign of the house or the window they just jumped through. At first they fear that they might be on another planet. They are relieved when they discover, from a passing truck driver, that they are in Joshua Tree National Park (referred to by the driver as Joshua Tree National Forest).

Returning to the house, they find it has vanished. Teal remarks that it must&#x27;ve &quot;fell through into another section of space&quot; on the last earthquake, and that he should&#x27;ve &quot;anchored it at the foundations&quot;.

The story ends with Teal rejoicing that he&#x27;s now got a &quot;great new revolutionary idea for a house&quot;, and Mr. Bailey attempting to punch him out of frustration, which Teal quickly evades, as &quot;he was always a man of action&quot;.

==Address==
The story gives Quintus Teal&#x27;s address as 8775 Lookout Mountain Avenue in Hollywood (), across the street from &quot;the Hermit, the original Hermit of Hollywood&quot;. That address is across the street from Heinlein&#x27;s own house at the time the story was written.

==Reception==
Stating that it &quot;was, for many readers, the first introduction to four-dimensional geometry that held any promise of comprehensibility&quot;, Carl Sagan in 1978 listed &quot;—And He Built a Crooked House—&quot; as an example of how science fiction &quot;can convey bits and pieces, hints and phrases, of knowledge unknown or inaccessible to the reader&quot;.

<text>Play is a one-act play by Samuel Beckett. It was written between 1962 and 1963 and first produced in German as Spiel on 14 June 1963 at the Ulmer Theatre in Ulm-Donau, Germany, directed by Deryk Mendel, with Nancy Illig (W1), Sigfrid Pfeiffer (W2) and Gerhard Winter (M). The first performance in English was on 7 April 1964 at the Old Vic in London. It was not well-received upon its British premiere.

==Synopsis==

The curtain rises on three identical grey funeral &quot;urns&quot;, about three feet tall by preference, arranged in a row facing the audience. They contain three stock characters. In the middle urn is a man (M). To his right is his wife (W1) or long-time partner. The third urn holds his mistress (W2). Their &quot;[f]aces [are] so lost to age and aspect as to seem almost part of the urns.&quot; Beckett had used similar imagery before, Mahood&#x27;s jar in &quot;The Unnameable&quot;, for example, or the dustbins occupied by Nell and Nagg in &quot;Endgame&quot;.
At the beginning and end of the play, a spotlight picks out all three faces, and all three characters recite their own lines, in what Beckett terms a &quot;chorus&quot;; the effect is unintelligible. The main part of this play is made up of short, occasionally fragmented sentences spoken in a &quot;[r]apid tempo throughout&quot; &quot;which in his 1978 rehearsals [he] likened to a lawn mower – a burst of energy followed by a pause, a renewed burst followed by another pause.&quot; &quot;He wrote each part separately, then interspersed them, working over the proper breaks in the speeches for a long time before he was satisfied.&quot;

One character speaks at a time and only when a strong spotlight shines in his or her face. The style is reminiscent of Mouth&#x27;s logorrhoea in &quot;Not I&quot;, the obvious difference being that these characters constantly use first person pronouns. Clichés and puns abound. While one is talking the other two are silent and in darkness. They neither acknowledge the existence of the others around them (M: &quot;To think we were never together&quot;) nor appear aware of anything outside their own being and past (W2: &quot;At the same time I prefer this to . . . the other thing. Definitely. There are endurable moments&quot;). Beckett writes that this spotlight &quot;provokes&quot; the character&#x27;s speech, and insists that whenever possible, a single, swivelling light should be used, rather than separate lights switching on and off. In this manner the spotlight is &quot;expressive of a unique inquisitor&quot;. Billie Whitelaw referred to it as &quot;an instrument of torture.&quot; The spotlight is in effect the play&#x27;s fourth character.

In an almost fugal style the three obsess over the affair. Each presents his or her own version of the truth told in the past tense and each from his or her respective points of view. It is one of Beckett&#x27;s most &#x27;musical&#x27; pieces with &quot;a chorus for three voices, orchestration, stage directions concerning tempo, volume and tone, a &quot;da capo&quot; repeat of the entire action&quot; and a short coda.

Towards the end of the script, there is the concise instruction: &quot;Repeat play.&quot; Beckett elaborates on this in the notes, by saying that the repeat might be varied. &quot;[I]n the London production, variations were introduced: a weakening of light and voices in the first repeat, and more so in the second; an abridged second opening; increasing breathlessness; changes in the order of the opening words.&quot; The purpose of this is to suggest a gradual winding down of the action for he writes of &quot;the impression of falling off which this would give, with the suggestion of a conceivable dark and silence in the end, or of an indefinite approximating towards it.&quot; At the end of this second repeat, the play appears as if it is about to start again for a third time (as in &quot;Act Without Words II&quot;), but does not get more than a few seconds into it before it suddenly stops.

===The affair===

&quot;The affair was unexceptional. From the moment when the man tried to escape his tired marriage and odious professional commitments by taking a mistress, [events took a predictable enough course:] the wife soon began to ‘smell her off him’; there were painful recriminations when the wife accused the man, hired a private detective, threatened to kill herself, and confronted the mistress in an old rambling house reminiscent of &quot;Watt&quot; (and where the servant again is &#x27;Erskine&#x27;) ... The man renounced the mistress, was forgiven by his wife who &#x27;suggested a little jaunt to celebrate, to the Riviera or ... Grand Canary,&#x27; and then, [true to form], returned to the mistress, this time to elope with her. [In time] their relationship too became jaded, and the man&quot; abandons her as well.

According to Knowlson and John Pilling in &quot;Frescoes of the Skull: the later prose and drama of Samuel Beckett&quot;, “&quot;[T]he three figures in &quot;Play&quot; … are not three-dimensional characters. Any attempt to analyse them as if they were would be absurd. The stereotype predominates … [They] belong … to the artificial world of melodrama and romance embodied in romanticized fiction.&quot;

==Biographical references==

During the late 1950s when staying in London, Beckett often met with Barbara Bray, at the time a script-editor with the BBC. A small and attractive widow in her thirties, she was also intelligent and well read. “Beckett seems to have been immediately attracted to her and she to him. Their encounter was highly significant for them both, for it represented the beginning of a relationship that was to last, in parallel with that with of [his long-time partner] Suzanne, for the rest of his life.” In short time their association became “a very intimate and personal one.”

“In a visit to Paris in January 1961, Barbara ... informed Beckett that she intended to move [there] to live permanently” “a move which had been discussed more than once with Sam.” His response was unusual. In March he married Suzanne in a civil ceremony in the seaside town of Folkestone, England. Ostensibly this was to ensure if he died before her Suzanne would “inherit the rights to his work, since, under French law, there was no ‘common-law wife’ legislation … Or he may simply have wanted to affirm where his true loyalty lay. Whatever the reason, the marriage made it clear … that he was unwilling to leave the woman with whom he had already lived for more than twenty years.”

For all that, in June 1961 Bray still decided to move and despite his recent marriage “[a]lmost every day [he went] round, often spending a good part of the day or a large part of the evening there.” “Oddly enough, this side of his life was [not well] known about in Paris ... [Beckett’s] natural reserve and well-developed sense of decorum were allied to his fear of giving offence to Suzanne.” Anthony Cronin notes that strangely – or perhaps not so strangely – during this time he was often to be found talking “fervently and seriously about suicide.” Despite his unwillingness to do much about it he was clearly suffering badly from guilt.

To comply with the law, Beckett “was obliged to be in residence in Folkestone for a minimum of two weeks to allow him to be married in the Registry Office there” and this time spent there observing the locals may well have influenced the “middle class, English, ‘Home Counties’” setting of &quot;Play&quot; and his use in the play of the names of “Ash and Snodland” which are both the names of towns in Kent, although James Knowlson points to two visits to Sweetwater at about the same time.

It was during the first London production that he encountered Billie Whitelaw for the first time. “Whitelaw’s deep brooding voice caught so many inflections that Beckett found himself at times listening to her instead of rehearsing the play.”

==Reception==
In 1998, David Benedict of &quot;The Independent&quot; argued that &quot;Play&quot; is a &quot;finer, more dramatically distilled&quot; work than &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; (1953).

==Interpretations==
“The earliest version (April 1962) was written for a woman and two men, Syke and Conk, figures in white boxes. In the final version we are presented instead with, as Michael Robinson describes it in &quot;The Long Sonata of the Dead: A Study of Samuel Beckett&quot;, “the three corners of love’s eternal triangle (the emphasis here is on the eternal) … They have no names [now], simply the designations M, W1 and W2 which aim at anonymity but also stand for all men and women who have, like them, been caught up in a three-part love affair,”

The play is entitled &quot;Play&quot;, in the same way that Beckett&#x27;s only venture into film is called &quot;Film&quot; but as always with Beckett there are other levels. “Speaking of his previous life the man remarks: ‘I know now, all that was just … play’, but what then is the meaning of ‘all this? And when will this become the same?’ All three characters admit that life was senseless yet there appears to be ‘no sense in this … either, none whatsoever’; though this does not prevent them from making ‘the same mistakes as when it was the sun that shone, of looking for sense where possibly there is none. They are playing … a pointless game with unending time of which they are the playthings.” This also could be a reference to one of the world&#x27;s most famous theatrical metaphors: “All the world&#x27;s a stage, And all the men and women merely players.”

In writing to George Devine, who directed the Old Vic production, Beckett suggests that “the inquirer (light) begins to emerge as no less a victim of his inquiry than they and as needing to be free, within narrow limits, literally to act the part, i.e. to vary only slightly his speeds and intensities.” But the role of the light is even more ambiguous, for it has also been seen as “a metaphor for our attention (relentless, all-consuming, whimsical)” and a way of “switching on and switching off speech exactly as a playwright does when he moves from one line of dialogue on his page to the next.” Neither of these analogies conflicts with the more popular views where the spotlight is believed to represent God, or some other moral agent tasked with assessing, each character&#x27;s case to be relieved from the binds of the urn by having them relive this relationship, which has ruined all their lives. This view ascribes a motive to the light beyond mere torture. That may not be the case. Just as easily as God, the light could represent the devil.

This reliving of the details surrounding the affair only takes up the first half of the text however; Beckett called this part the ‘Narration.’ As Paul Lawley says in &quot;Beckett’s dramatic counterpoint: a reading of &quot;Play&quot;&quot;, “[T]he second half of the text (preceded by a five second long blackout) – called ‘Meditation’ by Beckett himself – sheds a subtle new light on the first. In the Meditation each of the heads casts about for the sense of its situation, considers the nature of the light, probes for certainties amid the darkness and then makes an attempt to imagine what has happened to the other two corners of this particular Eternal Triangle ... We can now see that the heads are not chained exclusively to their ‘past’, their narration(s): they are victims of the light, certainly, but not only victims, for they can recognize themselves as such and can speak of the light when forced to speak by the light. The light obliges them to speak but it does not necessarily determine &quot;what&quot; they speak – yet we only realize this in the Meditation section of the text.”

“They cope with the light in various ways and natures. W1 screams at the light: ‘Get off me’ and she wonders what she must do to satisfy the disturbing and tormenting light. W2 is content with the idea that the light must know that she is doing her best. But she also wonders if she is perhaps a little ‘unhinged’ (meaning that she may go mad). For M the light enables fantasy. He imagines the two women drinking green tea together in the places they have each been with him and comforting each other. He fantasises waking up with both women and then going for a boat trip with the two of them on a summer&#x27;s afternoon. “At the end of the second part, M is completely aware of the mechanism of the light but not aware of his own narcissism” however.

“If the play consisted only of the Narration it would be as though the light were obliging them not only to speak, but to speak only of these events, to tell only this story.”

Many of Beckett&#x27;s plays and prose pieces are located “in ‘places’ which may strike us as being most adequately described as ‘Hell’, ‘Limbo’ or ‘Purgatory’– and the parallels with Dante are always tempting” – and indeed the most popular interpretation of &quot;Play&quot; is that the three are in some place like this. The use of urns to encase the bodies of the three players is thought to symbolise their entrapment inside the demons of their past; the way in which all three urns are described at the start of the play as &quot;touching&quot; each other is often deciphered as symbolising the shared problem which all three characters have endured.

“The whole situation resembles very closely that of &quot;Bérénice&quot;, in which two men, the Emperor Titus and King Antiochus, are in love with the heroine; Bérénice, for her part, is in love with Titus and regards Antiochus as her dearest friend. Yet the tragedy ends, bloodlessly, with Titus remaining unwillingly in Rome, while the other two reluctantly leave the city to go their separate ways. By the end of &quot;Bérénice&quot;, all three major characters have threatened to commit suicide; perhaps the three characters in &quot;Play&quot; are being punished because they &quot;have&quot; committed suicide. The text certainly indicates that very least the husband might have “sought refuge in death” also “[n]ot only does W1 threaten both her own life and that of W2, but W1 describes herself as ‘Dying for dark,’ and W2 affirms, ‘I felt like death.’ As so often with Beckett, the loose clichés assume an eerie literality.”

Beckett tasked himself with re-reading all of Racine’s plays in the mid-1950s and James Knowlson suggests that “this daily diet of Racinian claustrophobia forced Beckett to concentrate on the true essentials of theatre: Time, Space and Speech [which] pointed him in the direction that made a tightly focused, monologic play like &quot;Happy Days&quot; or &quot;Play&quot; possible.

It is conceivable that the three parties are not actually dead at all. Purgatory is, after all, not a theological concept Beckett would have been brought up with though Dante’s interpretation of it did catch his imagination. In the final paragraph of his 1929 essay &quot;Dante...Bruno. Vico...Joyce&quot; (whose strained, unpleasant second sentence reads, in full, &quot;The conception of Philosophy and Philology as a pair of nigger minstrels out of the Teatro dei Piccoli is soothing, like the contemplation of a carefully folded ham-sandwich&quot;), Beckett makes a striking comparison between Dante&#x27;s version of Purgatory and Joyce&#x27;s: “Dante&#x27;s is conical and consequently implies culmination. Mr. Joyce&#x27;s is spherical and excludes culmination … On this earth that is [his] Purgatory.&quot;. If the trio are separated physically then each would be in a private hell where he or she imagines and reimagines what may have happened to the other two and relives the events of the narration in his or her own mind. If we view the three urns purely as a theatrical device to bring these separate points of view together this interpretation is also valid. “Life on earth, the endless recurring cycle of history, constitutes Purgatory for Joyce in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. From Joyce’s Purgatory there is no escape, not even for the individual human being, who dies only to be reborn into the cycle. Likewise Beckett’s take on Purgatory is that it “is a state rather than a process.”

===Music===

In 1965 Philip Glass composed music for a production of &quot;Play&quot;. The piece was scored for two soprano saxophones, and is his first work in a minimalist idiom – an idiom which was substantially influenced by the work of Beckett.

===Film===

====&quot;Comédie&quot; (1966)====

In 1966 Beckett worked with a young director, Marin Karmitz (an assistant to Jean-Luc Godard as well as Roberto Rossellini), on a film version of &quot;Play&quot;, resulting in the film, &quot;Comédie&quot;. The cast included Michael Lonsdale, Eléonore Hirt and Delphine Seyrig.

====&quot;Beckett on Film&quot; (2000)====

Another filmed version of &quot;Play&quot; was directed by Anthony Minghella for the &quot;Beckett on Film&quot; project, starring Alan Rickman, Kristin Scott Thomas and Juliet Stevenson.

For this particular interpretation of the play, it is assumed that the action takes place in Hell, perhaps in reference to Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s famous assertion, &#x27;Hell is—other people&#x27; though T. S. Eliot’s rebuttal, “Hell is oneself,” is probably more accurate. In this filmed version, the action is set in a vast landscape of &quot;urn people&quot;, all speaking at once. “This [interpretation] was much turned over, along with doubts whether it should be there at all, in animated discussions that went on throughout the Barbican meeting places.”

A camera is used instead of a stage light to provoke the characters into action; Minghella uses a jump cut editing technique to make it seem as though there are even more than two repetitions of the text. He “made the equipment into a threatening force by switching it with bullying speed from one face to another, forcing unusual speed of delivery for the actors. Juliet Stevenson told [ Katharine Worth ] that during rehearsals she had wondered whether the lines were being delivered too fast for viewers to take in their sense [but] theatre critic, Alice Griffin ... thought that the lines ‘came across more clearly and more easily understandable than sometimes in the theatre.’ This she attributed partly to Minghella&#x27;s use of close-up, a recurring feature of the film versions naturally enough.”

The postmodern outlook of the film (&quot;a field of urns in a dismal swamp, a gnarled, blasted oak in the background, a lowering, Chernobyl sky&quot;) was however criticized by &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Art critic Adrian Searle as &quot;adolescent, and worse, clichéd and illustrational,&quot; adding: &quot;Any minute, expect a dragon&quot;. It is also perhaps noteworthy that this version does not feature the last section of the script, in which the characters almost embark upon a third cycle of the text.

<text>Pedro Antonio Morales (October 22, 1942 – February 12, 2019) was a Puerto Rican professional wrestler. He is best known for his appearances in the United States with Worldwide Wrestling Associates (WWA) and the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF).

Debuting in 1959, Morales originally came to prominence with WWA in the 1960s, where he held the World Heavyweight Championship and World Tag Team Championship. In 1970, he joined the WWWF, winning its World Heavyweight Championship and United States Championship. In a second run with the by-then World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in the 1980s, he won the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship and Tag Team Championship, establishing himself as the promotion&#x27;s first Triple Crown Champion. He retired from professional wrestling in 1987.

A popular champion, Morales had particular appeal to his native Puerto Ricans and the wider Latino audience. The first Latino to hold a world heavyweight championship, his reign as WWWF Heavyweight Champion remains among the longest in history. He previously also held the record for most cumulative days as Intercontinental Champion at 619 days across two reigns, having been surpassed by Gunther&#x27;s one reign in February 2024. He was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame in 1995, the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum in 2015 and the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 2017.

== Early life ==
Morales was born on October 22, 1942, in the municipality of Culebra, an island off the shore of Puerto Rico&#x27;s main island. He was a member of a large family, with 85 cousins just on his mother&#x27;s side. Morales once claimed that sixty five percent of Culebra&#x27;s population had some bloodline connection to him. He was raised in Culebra throughout his childhood and remained there until reaching his adolescence, when his mother sent him to live with an aunt in Brooklyn, New York, to finish his high school education. It was there that one of his sister&#x27;s friends introduced him to the members of a wrestling club which quickly earned his interest. After practicing in his school and at a local YMCA, Morales debuted as an amateur wrestler at the age of 13, competing in the 160 lb division. In New York, he also became a professional wrestling fan, witnessing the tag team of Miguel Pérez, Sr. and Antonino Rocca. Morales also played baseball. When he was 16 years old, he was selected in the Liga de Béisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico&#x27;s (now known as Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente) first year draft by the Leones de Ponce. However, due to living outside of Puerto Rico, he declined the opportunity. Instead, Morales elected to train in order to become a professional wrestler, in the process gaining twenty pounds. A year later, his father signed the documentation required by the New York State Athletic Commission in order to begin his career as an underage performer.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1959–1965) ===
When he was 17 years old, Morales trained under Barba Roja to become a wrestler and participated on a card held in New York City in 1959. He debuted by earning a victory over Howard LaVine, who performed under the pseudonym Buddy Gilbert, going on to participate in tag team matches and other stipulation matches throughout the tri-state area the following year. During the next two years, he wrestled in Virginia and North Carolina, particularly in the towns of Petersburg, Virginia and Charlotte, North Carolina. Morales frequently wrestled fellow Puerto Rican Gypsy Joe on these cards. He also earned wins over Jimmy Quinn, Don Savage and Sonny Fargo, while wrestling several local figures such as Swede Hanson, Laverne Baxter and Tony Nero. The following year, Morales began visiting several more states, often teaming up with different Latin luchadores, such as Pepper Gonzales and Gory Guerrero, while holding loose feuds with a wrestler simply known as “The Viking” and Mark Starr. As a traveling performer, he amassed mixed results, with most of his victories taking place in British Columbia. While there, Morales defeated Tarzan Potvin, Tony Nero, Bud Rattal, Tommy O&#x27;Toole and Johnny Demchuk in a two-month period, before losing three challenges to Oliver Winrush. After a similar result in a short program with Hard Boiled Haggerty, he had two draws against Allan Garfield, before defeating him on July 16, 1962. Over the following months, Morales served as a mid-carder, losing to several of the high-card talents. However, he gained wins over jobbers such as Poncho Pico, Sputnik Monroe and Gypsy Biviano, the latter of whom he won a three-fall match .

The following August, Morales traveled to Texas and was involved in a series of matches with Jack and Jim Dalton, facing them along multiple tag team partners. After emerging victorious in a feud over Nelson Royal, he relocated to Washington, D.C., and Bridgeport, Connecticut, where he wrestled Miguel Torres, Angelo Savoldi and Lou Albano, while entering into a rivalry with Tony Altomare. It was there where he first teamed up with Miguel Pérez, Sr. and Argentina Apollo, who were the first tag team champions recognized in the history of the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF, now known as WWE). In 1963, Morales performed in several tag team matches against Johnny Barend and Magnificent Maurice, returning to New York and New Jersey in a program alongside Gordo Chihuahua, who worked as enhancement talent. Later in the year, he formed a recurrent tag team with Perez and feuded with Pedro Rodriguez. In June, Morales joined Bruno Sammartino, Bobo Brazil, Perez and Apollo to once again enter a storyline with Johnny Barend, who was now joined by Diamond Jack. After this, Vittorio Apollo became his mainstay tag team partner, with whom he challenged The Fabulous Kangaroos, Johnny Barend and Buddy Rogers on several occasions. Morales finished the year by teaming with Pérez, earning three victories over the Fabulous Kangaroos. The team opened 1964 by feuding with Chris and John Tolos, losing the first two encounters but winning the three-fall rubber match. Individually, Morales defeated Chuck Martoni, Arnold Skaaland and Prince Nero several times.

The tag team next entered a feud with Jerry Graham and Luke Graham, losing multiple times before earning a win on September 19, 1964. The team also exchanged results against Hans &amp; Max Mortier. During this time frame, Morales picked singles wins over Frank Hickey, Chuck Martoni, Bobby Davis, Arnold Skaaland, Humberto Mercado, Matt Gilmore, Boris Malenko, Klondike Bill, Jose Quinteras, Magnificent Maurice, Bull Johnson and Luke Graham, while losing in matches against Wild Red Berry and Freddie Blassie. Morales then entered a double feud against Pedro Rodriguez and Gene Kiniski, dominating Rodriguez but losing to Kiniski. Alongside Pérez, he restarted their feud with the Grahams, earning a second victory. In the final months of 1964, Morales also gained wins over Robert Duranton and Steve Stanlee.

=== Worldwide Wrestling Associates (1965–1968) ===
Morales opened 1965 by moving to Worldwide Wrestling Associates (WWA) in California, an organization that had been created as a mirror to the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), where he engaged in multiple concurrent feuds, defeating &quot;The Executioner&quot; in his first match, before going on to defeat several wrestlers with similar characters by winning against &quot;The Axeman&quot; twice, &quot;El Verdugo&quot; and &quot;The Hangman&quot; on several occasions during the first three months of the year. Morales also experienced success in matches outside storyline, besting Jesse Rose, Charlie Kalani, Ruffy Colden, Billy Red Lyons, Kenny Yates, Don Savage, Luke Graham, Hard Boiled Haggerty, some of them more than two consecutive times. In March, he was involved in a program with Karl Von Stroheim, winning a series of matches against him and teaming with Mr. Moto and Luis Hernandez to win tag team matches that also included Kurt Von Stroheim.

On March 12, 1965, Morales defeated &quot;The Destroyer&quot; Dick Beyer to win the WWA World Heavyweight Championship in a three-fall match. He continued earning singles victories over Horst Wessel, Kurt Von Stroheim, Al Marshall, Broadway Venus, Bill Cody and in a rematch against The Destroyer, while teaming along Hernandez to wrestle multiple combinations. He became involved in a feud against The Assassins and The Butcher, steadily gaining the upper hands both individually and in tag matches. Morales moved on from these angles and defeated Rod Orell, Billy Klutzer and The Mummy, before dropping the championship to Luke Graham on July 23, 1965. Morales responded by defeating Graham in a three-fall chain match less than a month later, in the process winning a Brass Knuckles Championship. Meanwhile, his team with Hernandez won three consecutive matches against The Assassins by disqualification. Subsequently, a revival of his previous feuds with The Butcher and The Assassins became intertwined with the current involving Graham, leading to a series of matches featuring different combinations during the following months. Hernandez was eventually replaced by Adalberto Torres as Morales&#x27;s tag team partner, along whom he also 
faced Gorilla Monsoon and a variety of partners. On October 17, 1965, he defeated Graham to regain the WWA World Heavyweight Championship. Morales went on to defeat Graham in two more rematches, scoring victories over Ox Anderson, Bandito Lopez and Jack Allen as well. Following a short series against El Mongol, he continued this pattern in matches involving Swede Karlsen, Baron Leone, Killer Karlson, The Golden Terror, Mark Lewin, Killer Karl Kox and Clyde Steeves. Morales also won a battle royale held in Fort Worth, Texas and brought closure to his feud with El Mongol by besting him on February 13, 1966. During this stage, he also changed tag team partners frequently, teaming with Better Boucher, Ramon Torres and Billy Red Lyons among others, gathering mixed results.

In the final months before making a tour to Japan, Morales defeated Mark Lewin and Indio Joe, but also lost to Lyons and Mark Lewin. At his first show in Tokyo, he had a draw against Don Lewin. Morales continued this run by defeating Michiaki Yoshimura, Yoshino Sato, Mr. Moto, Mitsu Hirai, Umanosuke Ueda, tying against Kim Il in all of their encounters and losing only to Giant Baba by countout in singles. During this run, he teamed with Arman Hussein, Lewin, Wilbur Snyder, Lonnie Mayne &amp; Billy Two, among others, with the results being divided inequitable manner between wins, losses and draws. On May 27, 1966, Morales returned to California and went on another winning streak over Ray Shields, Jack Lanza, El Mongol, Stan Neilson, Baby Destroyer and Fritz Von Goering, before entering a series against Buddy Austin, losing the first three encounters and dropping the WWA World Heavyweight Championship to him on August 5, 1966, before winning the fourth match. He also reformed his tag team with Luis Hernandez, finding success in this division as well by winning the WWA World Tag Team Championship on June 24, 1966, being a dual champion for over a month. After a win over Art Mahalik, Morales wrestled Hernandez to a three-fall draw. This was followed by victories over Austin and in a second battle royale. Despite gathering singles wins over the likes of El Mongol, Austin, Magnificent Maurice, Joe Flores and Frank Marconi, during the following months, Morales focused on the tag team division, earning eleven wins, seven draws and only one loss before dropping the titles to Hard Boiled Haggerty and El Shereef on October 28, 1966. He subsequently split results against Shereef, also besting Rip Miller and Austin on several occasions during November. To close the year, Morales joined Mark Lewin to recapture the WWA World Tag Team Championship on December 10, 1966.

Morales began 1967 by also teaming with Ricky Romero, Mr. Moto and Pepper Gomez, gathering victories along all of them. In singles, he remained in the top of the card, defeating Paul Diamond, El Shereef, Killer Karl Kox, K.O. Murphy and Johnny Vander, while wrestling Haggerty and The Mad Russian to draws. After winning two more matches along Lewin, their team ceased to exist, costing them the titles. Morales was then joined by Romero as his partner, once again winning the WWA World Tag Team Championship along with him on February 10, 1967. The team went on to win almost a dozen matches, while he won contests against The Mighty Atlas, The Preacher and Mike DiBiase during the following months. Morales also ran a parallel team with Pepper Gomez, winning the American Wrestling Alliance World Tag Team Championship along with him after winning their two previous matches. He made his first appearance in Hawaiian territory along Gomez on April 26, 1967. After returning to California the following month, Morales entered a series against his former partner Mark Lewin, but lost both encounters. He then continued to team with Gomez and Romero, recording a successful run until they became part-time partners in July 1967, when he joined fellow Puerto Rican José Luis Rivera, immediately entering a long feud against Mike DiBiase, who teamed with a variety of wrestlers, but most frequently wrestled along Karl Gotch. While individually, Morales entered a brief period where he recorded more draws and losses than wins, his team with Rivera won their first five encounters, which also featured him besting DiBiase and Gotch in singles. Concurrent to this, his team with Romero began experiencing more losses, while the one along Gomez remained consistently successful. While DiBiase and Gotch won in two consecutive events, the feud began to produce several draws. Morales and Rivera won the last encounter on August 16, 1967, then migrating to another rivalry against Freddie Blassie &amp; Buddy Austin. Despite earning wins over several other teams, they were unable to best Blassie and Austin during this feud, only recording a single win. Individually, Morales gained victories over Tony Nero and Tony Altomare, both of whom eventually teamed and lost to the Puerto Rican team.

He challenged and defeated Blassie by himself, but lost in a rematch. Morales wrestled Pat Patterson in two tag matches, losing along Rivera but winning with Gomez. The team with Rivera dissolved afterwards, with another teammate emerging in the figure of Antonio Pugliese. Both of Morales&#x27; teams managed to record a successful run against an assortment of teams that included different combinations of opponents such as Stan Stasiak, Tom Andrews, Blassie, Austin, Patterson and Ray Stevens among others. Meanwhile, in one-on-one competition he bested Ron Romano, Baron Mikel Scicluna, Rick Renaldo, The Rebel and won an eight-man battle royale. Morales closed the year by rejoining Gomez as a full-time partner, defeating the team of Blassie and The Great Malenko. To open 1968, he defeated The Preacher, The Rebel and Blassie, briefly rejoining Romero in a draw. Individually, Morales then entered a streak of draws, before rebounding with wins over Rick Renaldo, Rocky Montero, The Alaskan, Lou Anthony, Rocky Montero and The Masked Invader. Antonio Pugliese reappeared on May 4, 1968, only to drop the WWA World Tag Team Championship to The Medics. A week later, Morales and Gomez also lost the AWA World Tag Team Championship to Kinji Shibuya &amp; Masa Saito, but regained them on June 8, 1968. Mil Máscaras became a new member of the team, whom he joined in winning a series against Jim Osborne and losing another to Blassie and Austin. Morales made a one-night appearance in Hawaii during the summer, besting Pat Patterson. Both of Morales teams began having mixed results, which brought in another winning streak as a singles wrestler which included names such as Fritz Von Goering, Texas, Osborne, Lou Anthony, Rick Renaldo, Thunderbolt Patterson, Tony Romano, Rocky Montaro and The Masked Invader before being snapped by Blassie via disqualification. On November 7, 1968, Morales challenged Gene Kiniski for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, but failed to win the match. He won his next match by defeating George Cannon, forming a brief partnership with Hahn Lee that only lasted for a month. In his final matches for the WWA, Morales defeated The Raider and El Mongol twice.

=== 50th State Big Time Wrestling (1967–1970) ===
Now a full-time performer for 50th State Big Time Wrestling in Hawaii, he quickly entered a successful run with victories over Dave Ruhl, Austin and Tank Morgan. This resulted in Morales defeating Curtis Iaukea for the NWA Hawaii Heavyweight Championship on May 21, 1969, and Kiniski for the NWA North American Heavyweight Championship less than a month afterwards. During this timeframe he also teamed with several wrestlers, including Gomez, Don Leo Jonathon, Dory Dixon and Ed Francis. Morales went on to defeat Austin and Kiniski in rematches, interrupting this run by unsuccessfully challenging Pat Paterson for the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship in California. On October 13, 1969, he added the Hawaii Tag Team Championship to his other titles along Francis, holding it for a couple of weeks. After defeating Rocky Montero and Gorilla Monsoon, Morales dropped the North American Championship to Curtis Iaukea on September 24, 1969. However, in his following appearance he recovered the Hawaii Tag Team titles with Francis. After successfully teaming with Bing Ki Lee on three consecutive cards, Morales recovered the North American belt from Iaukea on November 5, 1969. In the final events of the year, he defeated &quot;The Original Sheik&quot; Ed Farhat, got disqualified twice against Tank Morgan and wrestled Johhny Barend. Morales began 1970 by wrestling in a series against Jack Bence, which later involved Bing Ki Lee and Tank Morgan. After defeating both Bence and Morgan, he returned to his feud with Barend dropping the North American Heavyweight Championship on February 7, 1970. Morales recovered by winning a match over Mac MacFarland and teaming with Bing Ki Lee to win the Hawaii Tag Team Championship from Barend and Ripper Collins. The team was successful in their next encounter against Kinji Shibuya and Mitsu Arakawa. After defeating Barend in a stretcher match, Morales defeated Les Roberts and advanced to the second round of the Strelich Tournament, a single-knockdown competition for the Strelich Perpetual Trophy, with a win over Woody Farmer. However, a loss to Don Carson in the quarterfinals eliminated him from the event.

He made a brief return to California, partnering with Freddie Blassie, but the team lost a series against Don Carson and the Great Kojika. Back in Hawaii, Morales defeated Bad Boy Shields, Mr. Fujiwara, Les Roberts and Mac MacFarland, only losing a match to Kinji Shibuya, during the following couple of months. In late May, Hard Boiled Haggerty arrived to the promotion. This reignited their feud in two encounters that favored Morales, who won a tag team match and tied in singles. Stan Frazier and Tony Borne were the next opponents that he bested during the summer. On July 1, 1970, Morales and Bing Ki Lee lost the Hawaii Tag Team Championship to Barend and Billy Robinson. In his next appearance, he joined Sam Steamboat and Hahn Lee in a win over Barend, Killer Karl Kox and Ripper Collins. In another tour to California, Morales lost to Black Gordman by count out and defeated Don Serrano, also teaming with Rocky Johnson for the first time to wrestle the Great Kojika and John Tolos. He then got disqualified in a match against Barrend and tied with Kinji Shibuya. On August 5, 1970, Morales regained the North American Heavyweight Championship from Barend. He was then involved in a series of matches involving John Tolos, whom he defeated in a tag team competition but lost in singles. During the following two months, Morales recorded a series of draws in matches against Ripper Collins, Billy Robinson and Kinji Shibuya twice. After snapping this streak with a win over Abdullah the Butcher, he dropped the North American Heavyweight Championship to The Destroyer. In his final two matches in the MPP, Morales bested Jack Armstrong in a three-fall match and lost a 4-on-4 against Collins, Barend and The Destroyer while teaming with Sam Steamboat, Billy Robinson, Frank Allman and Hahn Lee. Returning to California, Morales began by defeating El Lobo on several encounters, also scoring wins over The Texan and John Tolos before losing the final of a one-night tournament for the NWA Pacific Coast Heavyweight Championship to Tony Rocca. During his final months in the West Coast, he defeated Karl Heisinger and Billy Graham, also participating in several tag team matches along Rocca and Ray Mendoza.

=== World Wide Wrestling Federation (1970–1975) ===
Morales made his first appearance for the World Wide Wrestling Federation, now known as WWE, on November 21, 1970, by teaming with Chief Jay Strongbow in a draw against The Mongols, Newton Tattrie and Josip Peruzovic, as part of a one-night appearance. Now a full-time member of the WWWF roster, he joined Gorilla Monsoon the following month, scoring a win in a three-fall rematch. In his singles debut, Morales defeated Joe Turco. This was followed by wins over The Black Demon, &quot;The Wolfman&quot; Willie Farkas and Bulldog Brower during the following month. On January 7, 1971, Morales won the vacant WWWF United States Championship by defeating Blassie in a tournament final. A team-up with Gorilla Monsoon also took place in two draws involving The Mongols. 

On February 8, 1971, Morales defeated Ivan Koloff to win the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship only a month after winning his first individual title within the promotion. The move also vacated the United States Championship. This ignited a series of wins over the likes of Jack Evans and his previous opponents The Black Demon and Bulldog Brower. Subsequently, a series of victories in tag team matches involving Blackjack Mulligan evolved into a feud of single encounters, in which Morales won half a dozen events, before scoring two more team victories along Moonson. Meanwhile, The Wolfman and Bulldog Brower became recurrent enhancement talents during this run. Morales also scored wins over the likes of Beautiful Bobby and Tarzan Tyler, who eventually teamed up with Luke Graham, which turned into a double feud against both. Tyler, The Black Demon, Graham and The Beautiful Bobby were the opponents faced by him during a winning streak that extended throughout the summer. Different tag teams along with Monsoon, Jay Strongbow and Manuel Soto experienced similar success. During August 1971, Morales scored several victories over Graham and Tyler, also besting them as a tag team and in a 3-on-3 match that included Lou Albano. However, in his final contest of the month he suffered a loss to Stan Stasiak. In September, Tyler and Graham brought in Jimmy Valiant as a teammate, which led to a series of matches including a win over him in a steel cage. On October 25, 1971, Morales defeated Stasiak in a Texas Death match. The following month brought wins over Tyler and Valiant, but also included an encounter where he bested Freddie Blassie and a continuation of the feud against Stasiak during the second half. During this time-frame, Rivera joined Morales in the WWWF, becoming part of his usual partners along Monsoon and Strongbow. He closed 1971 by defeating Blassie in a Roman Gladiator match, Ray Stevens, Stan Stasiak twice and The Rugged Russians along with Rivera.

First contender Blassie and Stasiak remained Morales&#x27; main rivals in the first two months of 1972, against whom he scored several draws and some wins. Graham, Valiant and Toru Tanaka served as enhancement talents. On February 18, 1972, Morales and Rivera defeated The Rugged Russians, continuing this parallel rivalry. March featured several different matchups, in which he emerged victorious against &quot;Baron&quot; Mikel Scicluna, Smasher Sloan and Rugged Russian #2, while consistently teaming with Rivera against Curtis Iaukea and Scicluna, both of whom he defeated individually throughout April. The following month featured feuds which ended in Morales earning several victories over Pampero Firpo, Tanaka, Iaukea and Albano. After disposing of Valiant, Graham, Scicluna and Graham again, the feud against Albano continued with wins in regular and steel cage matches. During June 1972, Morales also bested other notable opponents, including Nikita Mulkovitch, Blue Demon and Ernie Ladd. To continue this run, he defeated George Steele in New York. Following three wins over Tanaka and more against Firpo, Morales teamed with Sammartino on July 18, 1972, to face the former and Mr. Fuji. The match featured the two most popular wrestlers of the era, but finished in a no contest with both of the involved in a confrontation after Mr. Fuji threw salt in both of their faces, ensuing a fight. A rematch took place, this time in a team with Monsoon, but finished in a draw. Morales defeated both Tanaka and Mr. Fuji by countout and won the following two tag team matches. This was followed by a series involving Steele, Fuji, Ernie Ladd, Chuck O&#x27;Connor, aka Big John Studd, and &quot;The Spoiler&quot; Don Jardine, none of whom were able to gain an upper hand against him. On September 30, 1972, Morales faced Bruno Sammartino in the first-ever match featuring the two fan favorite, technical wrestlers. The crowd favored him, despite Sammartino&#x27;s large fan base in the city of New York. After 75 minutes of wrestling featuring several near-falls, the contest ended in a draw, when the city&#x27;s curfew entered into effect. Subsequently, both performers embraced, signifying the end of their rivalry and the reformation of the tag team. However, the lack of a resolution was not well received, the fans were noticeably angry, and some jumped into the dugouts to shake their fists at the wrestlers. The main event of the 1972 Showdown at Shea later became known as &quot;The Match of the Century&quot; and is still regarded as one of the best events in the history of professional wrestling. After scoring a win over The Spoiler, Morales joined Sammartino in a rematch against Tanaka and Mr. Fuji, this time emerging victorious in a three-fall contest.

This was followed with a rematch, this time teaming with André the Giant. The Spoiler remained Morales most common adversary during the following months, which resulted in wins over him and his partner, Buddy Wolfe. Other wrestlers to fail in their attempts to defeat Morales were Ernie Ladd, The Sheik and Ray Stevens. To close the year, Morales defeated Tanaka individually and in tag team action, before going on to defeat Wolfe on several occasions. On December 2, 1972, he rejoined Rivera in a win. During the first months of 1973, Morales bested Mr. Fuji, Buddy Wolfe and Lonnie Mayne, as well as Hans Schmidt, Lonnie Mayne and Curtis Iaukea. He also teamed with Moonson, Bobo Brazil and Strongbow. A feud with Mayne went on to include a steel cage match. A series against Freddie Blassie concluded with three singles wins for Morales, also including a tag team contest. Throughout April and May, he successfully faced a number of recycled adversaries, including Mayne, Wolfe and Tanaka, along with wins over new ones such as Don Leo Jonathan and Mike McCord, aka Austin Idol. Morales also defeated Blassie twice, including a steel cage match. Throughout the summer, he performed mostly as a singles wrestler, gathering wins over Toru Tanaka, Paul Jones, Lonnie Mayne, Jonathan, McCord and George Steele facing them repeatedly in cyclical fashion. This trend was broken with the arrival of August, when Morales bested other figures including Blackjack Lanza and Stan Stasiak. During the month of September 1973, he was placed over Ib Solvang Hansen, McCord, Steele and Fuji. Morales went on to win a series against Lanza and a Texas Death Match involving Stasiak, before having Fuji serve as enhancement talent for the following weeks. On November 2, 1973, he made an appearance in AWA, winning a three-fall contest over Ray Stevens. Morales worked an angle with the then-villain Larry Hennig, besting him in singles. He followed this by entering a feud with Stasiak which featured mixed results, but concluded with him dropping the WWWF Heavyweight Championship on December 1, 1973. Morales&#x27; title run lasted 1,027 days, remaining to this date the longest reign by any Latino and the fifth longest overall. His reign was featured in the independent film &quot;The Wrestler&quot;, where footage of him was shown while two characters remarked &quot;C1: Morales... Eastern league champion. C2: And he is young. C1: He sure is good...&quot; as part of a discussion of dangerous adversaries that could be possible opponents for an aging wrestler. 

Following this, he returned in two tag team matches, before defeating Stasiak twice in three rematches. One of these matches was promoted by Sponsham wrestling and held at Roberto Clemente Coliseum. Morales remained successful as a singles wrestler, gathering wins over Fuji, Eddie Sullivan, Otto Von Heller, Johnny Rodz and Black Gordman during the first half of 1974. During the second half of the year, he bested Nikolai Volkoff and Strong Kobayashi, before exchanging results in a long-running feud against Killer Kowalski. In his final phase of this run for the promotion, Morales was victorious over Butcher Vachon, wrestling his final match on March 1, 1975.

=== Big Time Wrestling (1975–1976) ===
Four days later, Morales returned to California, wrestling for the Big Time Wrestling territory in San Francisco. Despite now serving mainly as a tag team performer along Manny Cruz, Raul Mata, Pat Patterson, Cowboy Lang and The Haitian Kid among others, he also remained a singles attraction, gathering wins over Ricky Hunter, The Brute and winning a feud over Kurt Von Brauner during the following two months. Morales began the summer by teaming with Patterson on a consistent basis, sometimes alternating to include Peter Maivia, Don Muraco or a random wrestler. Their main opponents during this timeframe were The Invaders, against whom they exchanged results, with Morales and Patterson winning the NWA San Francisco World Tag Team Championship on October 29, 1975. Immediately afterwards, they became involved in a series against Don Muraco and Mr. Saito that lasted for the remainder of the year and from which they emerged with the best balance. To begin the following year, Mr. Saito and The Invaders were included in the feud, teaming with Muraco and Fuji on alternate events. The rivalry eventually shifted to singles competition, where Morales defeated Muraco on three dates before losing once. To close this run, he lost a contest to The Great Fuji by being counted out. Morales made two appearances in St. Louis, winning two tag team matches and defeating Ox Baker individually.

=== American Wrestling Association (1976–1977) ===
On October 30, 1976, he joined the American Wrestling Association as a full-time performer. Returning to his former singles pace, Morales went on to immediately enter an undefeated streak over Bobby Jones, Moose Morowski, Buddy Wolff, Frankie Hill, Baron Von Raschke, Vito Martino, Ray Stevens, Pierre Poisson, Blackjack Lanza, Puppy Dog Peloquin, Rodeo Jones, Roger Kirby, Ray Stevens, Joe Carlos and Frankie Hill to close the year. To open 1977, he continued to trend in matches including Tom DeMarco, Mike Soma, Mad Dog Vachon, Baron Von Raschke, Poisson, Bobby Duncum, Moose Morowski and Jim Brunzell, also winning a battle royale and drawing in a series against The Super Destroyer. His streak continued the following month, this time over Bob Arnel and The Strangler, going on to include matchups against the opponents that he had already defeated. The feud with The Super Destroyer resumed shortly afterwards, this time ending with another draw and two wins for Morales. A rivalry with Nick Bockwinkel also took place in parallel, recording a no contest and a victory. After briefly teaming with Peter Maivia, Morales defeated Armando Rodriguez and entered a series against Alfred Hayes, which ended with a balance of five wins, two losses and two draws. Afterwards, he recorded mixed results in several contests against The Super Destroyer. In what marked the final stage of this AWA run, Morales continued defeating jobbers Mike York, Kenny Jay and The Strangler, but began losing more often to talent that he had bested earlier including Nick Bockwinkel and others such as Angelo Mosca.

=== Championship Wrestling from Florida (1977–1978) ===
After migrating to Championship Wrestling from Florida, he immediately emerged victorious from a rivalry with Pat Patterson. In this territory, Morales’ tag team with Johnson became more active and defeated the team of Patterson &amp; Ivan Koloff on five consecutive encounters. A second feud, this time with Don Muraco was not as successful and he experienced mixed results, but also winning more often than he lost. During this time-frame, Morales also faced “Superstar” Billy Graham and Lars Anderson on a regular basis. On October 8, 1977, Morales unsuccessfully challenged Harley Race for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Afterwards, Koloff joined Mr. Saito as his main partner in the ongoing team feud, but both of the combinations with Johnson and Muraco were able to best them. Morales then teamed twice with Dusty Rhodes in a draw and a win against Lars Anderson &amp; Killer Karl Kox, also teaming with Muraco one last time to defeat Koloff and Saito. On December 6, 1977, Morales wrestled Race for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, failing to win the belt. The following night he faced Race, Dick Murdoch, Baron Von Krupp and Mr. Sakuruda for the title, but was disqualified. To close the year, Morales earned singles victories over Buddy Roberts and Tank Patton. His team along Johnson opened the year by winning their first two matches, going on to defeat Koloff and Saito to win the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship on January 24, 1978. Concurrently, Morales wrestled Anderson and divided honors in a series which included a win in the Superbowl of Wrestling. A feud with Killer Karl Kox ended in individual and team losses, a streak which ended costing them the titles. After recovering with wins over Koloff and Saito, Morales and Johnson regained the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship on February 14, 1978. This reign was short, lasting only two weeks before dropping them to Saito and Mr. Sato. Morales then wrestled several singles matches, defeating Killer Karl Kox, Bobby Dumcum, Saito, Bob Roop, Jack Ruggers and Charlie Cook, dividing contests with Dick Slater and losing to Koloff. This was followed by three new partners, Tiger Conway, Jr., with whom he won four consecutive bouts, Joe Azzari, which led to two losses, and Jerry Brisco, who wrestled with him in two draws.

=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling and Canada (1978–1980) ===
On May 5, 1978, Morales returned to Puerto Rico for one night and teamed with Rivera. Afterwards, Ron Mikolajczyk became a recurrent teammate, mostly in matches involving Butch Bronson and a chosen partner. During the following months, Morales scored wins over Len Denton, Butch Cassidy, Rick Oliver and Sir Winston, but lost to Killer Karl Kox, Dick Slater and The Spoilers. On June 23, 1978, he made a tour to New Japan Pro-Wrestling, but only participated in tag matches. This was followed by a visit to Kansas, where Morales defeated Alex Perez and lost to Jesse Ventura. In October, he toured Germany, with a win over Amet Chong and losses to Kublai Khan. On November 11, 1978, Morales made a one night visit to California, teaming with Chavo Guerrero, Sr. in a win over Eddie Mansfield and The Grappler. The following year, he began making appearances in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. His first partner became Skip Young, along whom he managed to gain mixed results in matches involving Moose Morowski, John Studd and Baron Von Raschke among others. In singles competition, Morales defeated Mr. X #1, Brute Bernard and Morowski. A secondary teammate, Les Thornton, joined him in several victories, while Abe Jacobs and Johnny Weaver teamed occasionally. Eventually, Jay Youngblood became Morales&#x27;s main partner, recording a winning streak while he also teamed with several other wrestlers including Cocoa Samoa, Tiger Jeet Singh and Bob Marcus with similar success. However, as a single performer he lost matches to Nick Bockwinkel, Len Denton and Killer Karl Kox, also failing to advance in a tournament for the NWA Canadian Heavyweight Championship. His victories during this time-frame were over Brute Bernard, Rudy Kay and Charlie Fulton. On November 8, 1979, Morales returned to NJPW, besting Kengo Kimura, Kuniaki Kobayashi, drawing with Tatsumi Fujinami and losing to Antonio Inoki. He also teamed with Singh and Bob Backlund in wins that included victories over both Fujinami and Inoki, but lost along with Greg Valentine in return matches. To open the following year, Morales relocated to Canada, where he defeated David Patterson, Mr. X #1, The Scorpion, Doug Somers and Brute Bernard, but lost a series to Ox Baker in alternate dates at South and North Carolina. In his final matches within the NWA circuit, Morales earned wins over Billy Starr, Frankie Laine and The Destroyer, both in singles and tag team matches.

=== Return to WWF (1980 - 1983, 1985 - 1987)===
==== Triple Crown Champion (1980–1983) ====

On May 6, 1980, Morales returned to the renamed World Wrestling Federation, defeating Moose Monroe, Frank Savage, Mark Pole, Brute Bernard and Ben Alexander during the course of the following weeks. He formed a tag team with Bob Backlund, which won its first two contests. Meanwhile, Morales continued on his successful run with victories over Ron Shaw, Mikel Scicluna, Tor Kamata, Afa, B.B. Coleman, Johnny Rodz and The Hangman. On August 9, 1980, he won the WWF Tag Team Championship along with Backlund by besting Afa and Sika, the Wild Samoans, at the Showdown at Shea 1980. However, they had to forfeit the championship belts the following day, due to a rule stating that no heavyweight champion could hold a second title at the same time. During the following month, Afa and Kamata served as enhancement talent, while Morales also participated in a battle royale. Afterwards, he went on to defeat several adversaries, including Larry Zbyszko, Scicluna, Afa, Rodz and The Hangman. A series with Ken Patera intensified after a loss, with Morales recovering to defeat him to win the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship on December 8, 1980. With this win, he became the first man in history to win the Triple Crown Championship, which along his United States Championship reign also meant holding all of the promotion&#x27;s titles during his era, a recognition that only he held for almost two decades. Morales also feuded with Sgt. Slaughter, defeating him by disqualification. During the early months of 1981, he continued defeating the likes of The Hangman, Ron Shaw, Jose Estrada and Zbyszko, but tied in contests against St. Slaughter and Stan Hansen. After defeating and drawing with St. Slaughter in another series, Killer Khan became Morales&#x27; most recurrent adversary, experiencing more success, while other names such as Greg Valentine and Hansen challenged him occasionally. This was followed by a short feud against The Moondogs, which ended with singles wins over both members of the team. On March 26, 1981, Morales faced Hulk Hogan, dominating throughout the match and winning by count out. The feud with The Moondogs resumed afterwards, with mixed results in tag team competition but another win over Moondog Rex. Another figure who became a mainstay was Sgt. Slaughter, whom he often defeated by disqualification.

Jerry Johnson and Johnny Rodz served as jobbers during this run. After participating in a battle royale won by Angelo Mosca, the two entered a feud, from which Morales emerged victorious. During the month of June, he also scored consecutive wins over his former rivals Killer Khan and Sgt. Slaughter, ending their respective storylines. This led to a feud against Don Muraco, to whom Morales dropped the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship on June 20, 1981. Two subsequent rematches ended in one win, three losses and a draw. Morales began wrestling and defeating other adversaries, including George Steele, The Executioner and Larry Sharpe, besides the usual low card talents that he had consistently bested previously. The feud with Muraco continued and he earned two wins and a draw, leading to a titular rematch between them. Morales entered the contest with wins over The Executioner and Greg Valentine, winning the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship back on November 23, 1981, in a Texas Death match. With this win, Morales became the first man to hold the Intercontinental title twice, and he held it for fourteen months, the longest reign up until that point. He was successful in four rematches against Muraco, with Valentine systematically becoming his main adversary. In his first bout of 1982, Morales defeated Valentine by disqualification. He was able to dominate Hans Schroeder, Larry Dee and Killer Khan, but drew in another match against Valentine, who also went on to win their next encounter by disqualification. Their series continued with the equitable results of one win, one loss and a draw. To continue, Morales won two consecutive contests, including a Brass Knuckles Alley Fight, but got disqualified in the third. This was momentarily interrupted with a short program against Mr. Fuji, Mr. Saito and Lou Albano, which also featured wins over Rodz and Adrian Adonis. After being resumed, Morales won two more matches over Valentine, once again being disqualified in the third, before coming back to win in a Texas Death match. He then entered a winning streak, during which he defeated The Black Demon twice, Jesse Ventura by countout, Adonis thrice, Fuji and Valentine four times, two of these being Brass Knuckles Matches and other a Street Fight. This came to an end when Morales was disqualified against Jimmy Snuka. He wrestled Valentine three more times, winning in a Brass Knuckles match and by countout.

During the summer of 1982, Morales feuded with Bob Orton, Jr., gaining the upper hand after being disqualified in the open bout. Estrada, Saito and Swede Hanson were also bested during this time. However, this streak was also ended in a count out loss to Snuka. In September, Morales won contests over Rocky Cole and Scicluna, but was counted out against Buddy Rose, which led to a draw in a rematch. He opened the following months with victories in matches featuring Bob Bradley, Tony Russo and Swede Hanson, but was counted out in a challenge by Superstar Billy Graham. Morales continued his feud with Buddy Rose, defeating him by disqualification. Two more matches against Graham ended in a draw and a disqualification loss. Afterwards, Morales was involved in a no contest and a double disqualification draw with Rose, going on to close with two consecutive wins. During the month of November, he divided honors with Graham, also scoring victories over Tony Russo and Fuji. On December 28, 1982, Morales wrestled Don Muraco to a double disqualification draw. On his first match of 1983, the result was repeated, this time in a match involving Graham. The following weeks brought wins over Sammy Sanders, Bob Bradley, Fuji and Rose, but also losses to Graham and Muraco, most of which were by countout or disqualification. After besting Graham in another bout, Morales dropped the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship to Muraco on January 22, 1983. However, he countered by winning a rematch, also defeating Graham before losing a second rubber match. Afterwards, Morales gained wins over Swede Hanson, Bob Bradley, Victor Rivera, Buddy Rose, Huertas Gonzalez and Fuji. He also emerged victorious from a feud with Graham, winning the majority of their encounters. Morales and Muraco went on to exchange results, but neither one was able to dominate cleanly, with most wins being consequence of count outs and disqualifications. Meanwhile, he bested Eddie Carson and participated in occasional multi-wrestler team matches.

==== Puerto Rican tours (1983–1984) ====
On April 23, 1983, Morales began a tour in his native Puerto Rico performing for Capitol Sports Promotions (CSP), now known as the World Wrestling Council, challenging Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in his first appearance.

After a brief interruption where he bested Swede Hanson in a WWF card held at New York, Morales returned to CSP joining Carlos Colón, Sr. to win the CSP World Tag Team Championship over The Medics. On June 25, 1983, he defeated Buddy Landel to add the CSP North American Heavyweight Championship. In a rare CSP card outside of Puerto Rican soil, Morales wrestled Hugo Savinovich in Trinidad. On September 10, 1983, The Medics recovered the titles from Morales and Colón. One week later, Morales faced Ric Flair in the first Aniversario event, winning the contest by disqualification. On January 6, 1984, he dropped the North American Heavyweight Championship to Sweet Daddy Siki. After wrestling Cyclon Negro in Trinidad and defeating Buddy Rose in a WWF event, Morales won a rematch against Siki, recovering the title. He held the belt until September 15, 1984, dropping it to Randy Savage during the final stage of his CSP stay. Another notable opponent was J. J. Dillon. This run was highlighted by a feud against Bob Sweetan, who injured Morales&#x27; neck with a piledriver during one of their encounters.

==== Various feuds and retirement (1985–1987) ====
During the months of March and April 1985, Morales participated in tag team matches for the WWF, including participation in a show held in Kuwait. Morales later went on to defeat Mr. X, Terry Gibbs and Steve Lombardi during the following months. On May 24, 1985, he wrestled Strong Machine #1 to a draw in a NJPW show. Morales entered the 1985 King of the Ring tournament, besting Johnny V in the opening contest before receiving a bye during the quarterfinals. However, he was eliminated by Muraco in the semifinals. During this time-frame, Tito Santana became his occasional tag team partner. Individually, Morales went on to defeat Mr.X several times, Gibbs, Lombardi and Barry O twice, Rene Goulet four times and Tiger Chung Lee. He was also successful in two team matches along Santana. On September 12, 1985, Morales bested Muraco in New Jersey. The following night he claimed a win over Valentine. Morales defeated Bob Orton, Jr., Goulet and Barry O to conclude the month. October began with a winning streak which featured Les Thornton and Matt Borne along with enhancement talent, until this victory spree was halted by The Missing Link.

Morales made his following appearance in a WWF event held in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he defeated The Spoiler. The second half of the month brought wins in two matches along with Santana and singles success over opponents that he had previously wrestled. This pattern continued in November, when Morales and Santana exchanged results against Valentine and Brutus Beefcake. Individually, he gained victories over several familiar performers including Lee, Barry O, Gibbs and The Spoiler, also winning a series against Alexi Smirnoff and losing a single time to Orton. Contests including Moondog Spot, Thorton and Lee ended in the same fashion, with Morales going on to win a rematch over Orton. On December 12, 1985, Goulet scored a rare win over him. In turn, Morales ended the year with wins over Matt Borne, The Spoiler, Smirnoff, Barry O and Mike Sharpe, in the process successfully teaming with Santana. He won his first two contests of 1986 Moondog Spot and Lee, before losing to Terry Funk. This was followed by a series of tag team matches along Santana and Danny Spivey, which ended with a 2–1 balance. After besting two jobbers, Morales teamed with Steve Gatorwolf to defeat Valentine and Beefcake. After four more wins over his regular opponents, he lost to Orton. This pattern was repeated once more, but this time Morales earned a disqualification victory over Orton after winning the first four contests. Concurrently to this series, he was involved in a 3-on-3 match. On February 15, 1986, Morales defeated Bret Hart in Phoenix, Arizona. This was followed with wins over Goulet, Thorthon, Steve Lombardi and a successful feud against Orton. Morales made his only WrestleMania appearance in 1986 when he was a part of a 20-man invitational battle royal at WrestleMania 2. After two tag team victories along Santana, Morales defeated Hercules and Beefcake among others. This was followed by a prolonged series with both members of the Moondogs, from which he emerged victorious. On May 17, 1986, Morales defeated The Iron Sheik in a WWF return to California. His tag team with Santana remained successful, winning their contests throughout the summer. Meanwhile, Morales earned wins over Paul Christy, Roger Kirby, Lee, The Iron Sheik and Hercules, but began to lose more often against opponents such as Jake Roberts, King Kong Bundy and Savage. Like the year before, he entered the King of the Ring tournament, advancing with a win over Rudy Diamond. Morales advanced further by besting Mike Rotundo in the quarterfinals and Nikolai Volkoff in the semifinals, but lost the final to Harley Race. The following months brought mixed results, with wins over Muraco and Jim Neidhart but losses to Hercules and Adrian Adonis.

Morales recovered by defeating Savage three times and Gibbs once, while drawing with Orton before losing a rematch to Race. He entered the Sam Muchnick Memorial Tournament, winning his matchup against Funk in the opening round before being eliminated by Beefcake in the quarterfinals. On September 20, 1986, Morales defeated Jake Roberts. His next two feuds featured him getting disqualified and defeated by Muraco, exchanging results with Hercules and dominating Moondog Rex. However, his next series against Kamala saw him being counted out and pinned. A feud with Orton ended in similar fashion. Morales&#x27; team with Santana suffered the same fate, losing twice and participating in a double count out draw. Two rivalries involving Hercules and Steve Lombardi ended with mixed results. Afterwards, Morales won contests over The Red Demon, Lombardi and Sivi Afi, while losing to Muraco and being counted out against Savage.

In December, Morales bested Jimmy Jack Funk, Volkoff, Frenchy Martin and Bravo, but also featured an unsuccessful rivalry with Race. He opened 1987 with a win over Bret Hart, before teaming with Santana twice with mixed results. At 44 years old, Morales was entering his final year as an active wrestler, now being moved back in the card. He lost a series of matches against Bravo, but, bested Muraco before entering a feud with Nick Kiniski that featured several draws before he gained the upper hand in the final bout. Despite this, during this stage of his career Morales was unable to gain wins over the likes of King Kong Bundy and Bravo, unsuccessfully challenging the new Intercontinental Champion, The Honky Tonk Man, on several dates. Some wrestlers that he had bested in the past, such as Butch Reed or Sika were also booked over him, along with strong adversaries such as Jake Roberts, Bravo, Orton and Paul Orndorff. His wins over this time-span were over Moondog Spot, Sika and Jimmy Jack Funk. On March 8, 1987, Morales teamed with Danny Spivey in the quarterfinals of a tournament for the World Tag Team Championship, but they were eliminated by Rick Martel and Tom Zenk. May was marked by several unsuccessful matches that formed part of a rivalry with Ron Bass, but finished with a win over Lombardi. Morales and Santana teamed twice more, but were unable to overtake the team of Haku and Tama, however, he subsequently joined Jim Brunzell, in emerging victorious over The Hart Foundation which in its original incarnation as cited here was made up of Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart. During July, he bested Martin twice, also losing to One Man Gang and Orndorff. Morales made a final in-ring appearance as professional wrestler by participating in a battle royale held on November 16, 1987.

=== Retirement (1987–2019) ===
Following his retirement from the squared circle, Morales became a road agent and later a commentator for WWF&#x27;s Spanish-language programming, the first time that a Puerto Rican performed this duty for an international promotion. He returned to this role working for World Championship Wrestling during the 1990s, narrating &quot;Nitro&quot; and pay per views alongside Miguel Alonzo. This accomplishment has since been duplicated by Jack Meléndez and Willie Urbina.

Morales made few wrestling related appearances since his WCW days, with his last appearances being at autograph signings in fan conventions. He appeared at Wrestling Reunion III in 2005 and Wrestling Reunion 5 in 2007, reuniting with Sammartino at the latter. Despite living a low profile life following his retirement, he was the inspiration for homages and mentions throughout the decades which followed. A self-proclaimed &quot;old school&quot; wrestler, he was not interested in the overselling of gimmicks and spectacle that is seen in modern professional wrestling, despite admitting the economic success of the &quot;sports entertainment&quot; formula.

== Legacy ==
Morales was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame as part of the class of 1995. Professional wrestling critics and purists have discussed his contributions to the discipline in widespread publications. Tomás Marín Rodríguez &quot;El Martillo&quot;, part of a group led by José Antonio Geigel and one of the founding members of the first promotion in Puerto Rico, expressed in an interview that he considers Morales the best Puerto Rican wrestler in history. Marín considered that both his in-ring style and chivalry made him &quot;unique&quot; among performers. Terry Funk, Stan Hansen, Greg Valentine and Magnificent Muraco have expressed having enjoyed working matches with Morales. Fernwood Gold III and Thor Jensen of UGO Networks listed him as the 36th best face wrestler in history, noting how he appealed to the fanbase in New York. His run as the first Latin American Intercontinental Champion is often lauded. Bill Barnwell of IGN Sports also included Morales in the site&#x27;s list of Top Intercontinental Champions, placing him in the sixth slot. Jeremy Thomas of 411.com ranked him fifth as part of a debate among the website&#x27;s staff. In a similar discussion held at Slam! Sports, writer Greg Oliver considered him the best wrestler to hold the belt, stating that when &quot;he held the title, there was a sense of honour and pride with it&quot;. WWE itself ranked Morales in the ninth spot in the &quot;Intercontinental Champions&quot; entry of their Top 25 series. As merits for this recognition, the promotion mentioned him being the first wrestler to win the title twice and holding it for a combined total of over 600 days. His combined total stood as the record until he was surpassed by Gunther in February 2024. WWE also included him in a compendium titled &quot;Top 50 Good Guys in Wrestling History&quot;, which featured wrestlers that performed as fan favorites during their careers. In September 2016, the promotion joined NBC Universo to commemorate National Hispanic Heritage Month, creating a series highlighting the career of several wrestlers including Morales.

Outside of the WWE, he has received recognition as a Latin American and Hispanic pioneer in other promotions. In mid-1996, Morales appeared at an event of the short lived American Wrestling Federation, in the championship match between Bob Orton, Jr. and Tito Santana, along with other superstars and legends like Sgt. Slaughter, Chris Adams, and special guest referee Jim Brunzell. On August 31, 2006, as part of a Total Nonstop Action Wrestling taping, Morales was mentioned by Konnan along fellow Hall of Famers Carlos Colón, Santana, Mil Máscaras and the Guerrero family, being acknowledged as Latinos that paved the way within the wrestling industry. This was part of an in-character celebratory speech following The Latin American Xchange&#x27;s coronation as NWA World Tag Team Champions. In reality, Konnan credits him with &quot;[teaching] a lot&quot; about the politics of wrestling and &quot;the things you need to do in the ring to be a success in this business&quot; during his time in WCW. From 2003 onwards, the World Wrestling Council approached Morales and offered holding an Aniversario event in his honor, but he declined the invitations for ten years. In 2013, Morales accepted being the honoree of Aniversario 40. He was the centerpiece of the International Pedro Morales Fan Club, an independent organization that ran during the 1970s and that recruited members through wrestling magazines. In 2000, &quot;The Ring Chronicle&quot; inducted Morales into its own version of the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame. Modern fan reaction has also been positive in regards to the historical significance of his accomplishments. Nate Scaccia, a contributor to the website Bleacher Report, considers Morales the best Intercontinental champion of all time, ranking first in the title&#x27;s entry at the website&#x27;s WWE Champion Series. Michael Robinson and Will Baker, amateur writers for the same site, also consider him the 31st best WWE wrestler in history and 11th greatest WWE Champion respectively. He repeated at the ninth place in a subsequent interpretation. Besides the wrestling and sports media, the mun2 network also featured Morales in an article that listed their selection for the &quot;20 of the most memorable Latino wrestlers in WWE history&quot; which was published in 2012. When compiling a list based on the &quot;[wrestler&#x27;s] impact on the [Puerto Rican] fanbase&quot;, Raúl Álzaga of &quot;Primera Hora&quot; listed him third overall.

As a trainer, Morales was involved in the instruction of Dory Funk Jr., a former NWA World Heavyweight Champion who in 2009 was inducted into the Hall of Fame as part of The Funks. In 2022, his estate signed a deal to appear in Greg Gagne’s AWA-inspired PowerTown action figure line.

== Personal life and death ==
Morales&#x27; mother Teodora was a businesswoman, who continued to advise him on economic decisions throughout his life. He met Karen Johnson in 1965, when she attended an event at Long Beach where he was performing. They dated for five years, with her working as a teacher while his career often took him abroad to other states and countries. The couple married in 1972, in a small ceremony held at Puerto Rico which was only attended by family and the judge, continuing this relationship throughout his wrestling career and afterwards. The couple had a son, Pedro Morales Jr. born in 1974. Due to the nature of his work, Morales had lived in over a dozen cities throughout his career, including some time in Japan. However, when his son was about to start kindergarten, the family bought a house in Central New Jersey. His wife began working at Avenel Street Elementary School. The resources gathered in the industry were reinvested in &quot;stocks, bonds and properties&quot; which allowed them to capitalize in the long term.

After his last job in pro wrestling as a Spanish-language commentator in WCW, Morales retired from the sport and permanently settled in Woodbridge Township, New Jersey, where he adopted gardening as a hobby, cultivating tomatoes in his personal garden. Due to working during a time where the ring featured no methods of protection, Morales suffered several injuries that continued to linger after his career was over, limiting the amount of physical exercise that he was capable of doing. However, he remained a frequent visitor to The Club, a gym located in Woodbridge. Despite being a resident of this area, he continued to travel frequently to Puerto Rico, visiting the archipelago multiple times per year. In 2003, he expressed interest in returning to live permanently in a coastal town near the Caribbean Sea once his wife retired. However, this did not materialize. An advanced case of Parkinson&#x27;s disease prevented him from traveling to Puerto Rico during his final years. By this point his health had deteriorated, with the emergence of cardiac afflictions and cancer as well. Morales died on February 12, 2019, in Perth Amboy, New Jersey at the age of 76. He was survived by his wife, with their son predeceasing them in 2014.

<doc id="151806" wikidata="Q166479" url="?curid=151806" title="St Kilda, Scotland">
<text>St Kilda () is a remote archipelago situated west-northwest of North Uist in the North Atlantic Ocean. It contains the westernmost islands of the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. The largest island is Hirta, whose sea cliffs are the highest in the United Kingdom; three other islands (Dùn, Soay and Boreray) were also used for grazing and seabird hunting. The islands are administratively a part of the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar local authority area.

The origin of the name &quot;St Kilda&quot; is a matter of conjecture. The islands&#x27; human heritage includes unique architectural features from the historic and prehistoric periods, although the earliest written records of island life date from the Late Middle Ages. The medieval village on Hirta was rebuilt in the 19th century, but illnesses brought by increased external contacts through tourism, and the upheaval of the First World War, contributed to the island&#x27;s evacuation in 1930. Permanent habitation on the islands possibly extends back two millennia, the population probably never exceeding 180; its peak was in the late 17th century. The population waxed and waned, eventually dropping to 36 in 1930, when the remaining population was evacuated. Currently, the only year-round residents are military personnel; a variety of conservation workers, volunteers and scientists spend time there in the summer months. The entire archipelago is owned by the National Trust for Scotland. 

A cleit is a stone storage hut or bothy unique to St Kilda; there are known to be 1,260 on Hirta and a further 170 on the other group islands. Two different early sheep types have survived on these remote islands: the Soay, a Neolithic type, and the Boreray, an Iron Age type. The islands are a breeding ground for many important seabird species including northern gannets, Atlantic puffins, and northern fulmars. The St Kilda wren and St Kilda field mouse are endemic subspecies.

It became one of Scotland&#x27;s six World Heritage Sites in 1986, and is one of the few in the world to hold joint status for both its natural and cultural qualities.

== Origin of names ==

The name &quot;St Kilda&quot;, which is not used in Gaelic, is of obscure origin, as there is no saint by the name &quot;Kilda&quot;. It occurs for the first time in (&quot;Treasure of Navigation&quot;), a pilot book published by Lucas Waghenaer in 1592. A. B. Taylor suggests that it originated as a copying error for &quot;Skilda(r)&quot;, a name that appears on Nicolas de Nicolay&#x27;s 1583 map of Scotland, which Waghenaer used as a source. On Nicolay&#x27;s map, the name denotes an island group closer to Lewis and Harris than St Kilda, possibly Haskeir, Gasker or Haskeir Eagach. Taylor notes that the latter two groups could be compared to shields lying flat upon the water, and gives the Norse word (meaning &quot;shields&quot;) as the etymon.
According to another theory, advanced by William J. Watson and others, the name derives from Tobar Childa, an important well on Hirta. &quot;Childa&quot; is in fact a descendant of , the Norse word for a well, but it is possible that visitors to the island (who would have used the well to take on fresh water) mistook it as the name of a local saint. A number of other theories have been suggested in both the past and in modern times.

The origins of &quot;Hiort&quot;, and its anglicized form &quot;Hirta&quot;,which long pre-date &quot;St Kilda&quot;, are similarly obscure. Watson derives it from the Gaelic word , meaning &quot;death&quot;, noting that although Alexander MacBain suggested &quot;that the ancient Celts fancied this sunset isle to be the gate to their earthly paradise&quot; the connection was more likely to be to the dangers of living on St Kilda, which &quot;in the Hebrides is regarded as a penitentiary rather than a gate to paradise&quot;. It has also been said to mean &quot;the western land&quot;, from the Gaelic although this theory presents difficulties. It may not be Gaelic in origin at all, but rather Norse. Taylor derives it from the Norse word , meaning &quot;stags&quot;, on account of the islands&#x27; &quot;jagged outlines&quot;. In support of this theory, he notes that &quot;Hirtir&quot; appears in the 13th-century as a name for an island group in the Hebrides.

As with St Kilda, a number of other theories have been offered. All the names of and on the islands are discussed by Richard Coates.

== Geography ==
The islands are composed of Tertiary igneous formations of granites and gabbro, heavily weathered by the elements. The archipelago represents the remnants of a long-extinct ring volcano rising from a seabed plateau approximately below sea level.

At in extent, Hirta is the largest island in the group and comprises more than 78% of the land area of the archipelago. Next in size are Soay (English: &quot;sheep island&quot;) at and Boreray (&quot;the fortified isle&quot;), which measures . Soay is north-west of Hirta, Boreray 6 kilometres (4 mi) to the northeast. Smaller islets and stacks in the group include Stac an Armin (&quot;warrior&#x27;s stack&quot;), Stac Lee (&quot;grey stack&quot;) and Stac Levenish (&quot;stream&quot; or &quot;torrent&quot;). The island of Dùn (&#x27;fort&#x27;), which protects Village Bay from the prevailing southwesterly winds, was at one time joined to Hirta by a natural arch. MacLean (1972) suggests that the arch was broken when struck by a galleon fleeing the defeat of the Spanish Armada, but other sources, such as Mitchell (1992) and Fleming (2005), suggest that the arch was simply swept away by one of the many fierce storms that batter the islands every winter.

The highest point in the archipelago, Conachair (&quot;the beacon&quot;) at , is on Hirta, immediately north of the village. In the southeast is Oiseval (&quot;east fell&quot;), which reaches , and Mullach Mòr (&quot;big hill summit&quot;) 361 metres (1,185 ft) is due west of Conachair. Ruival (&quot;red fell&quot;) and Mullach Bi (&quot;pillar summit&quot;) dominate the western cliffs. Boreray reaches and Soay . The extraordinary Stac an Armin reaches , and Stac Lee, , making them the highest sea stacks in Britain.

In modern times, St Kilda&#x27;s only settlement was at Village Bay ( or ) on the east side of Hirta. Gleann Mòr on the north coast of Hirta and Boreray also contain the remains of earlier habitations. The sea approach to Hirta into Village Bay suggests a small settlement flanked by high rolling hills in a semicircle behind it. This is misleading. The whole north face of Conachair is a vertical cliff up to high, falling sheer into the sea and constituting the highest sea cliff in the UK.

The archipelago is the site of many of the most spectacular sea cliffs in the British Isles. Baxter and Crumley (1988) suggest that St Kilda: &quot;...is a mad, imperfect God&#x27;s hoard of all unnecessary lavish landscape luxuries he ever devised in his madness. These he has scattered at random in Atlantic isolation from the corrupting influences of the mainland, west of the westmost Western Isles. He has kept for himself only the best pieces and woven around them a plot as evidence of his madness.&quot;

Although from the nearest land, St Kilda is visible from as far as the summit ridges of the Skye Cuillin, some distant. The climate is oceanic with high rainfall, , and high humidity. Temperatures are generally cool, averaging in January and in July. The prevailing winds, especially strong in winter, are southerly and southwesterly. Wind speeds average approximately 85 percent of the time and more than more than 30 percent of the time. Gale-force winds occur less than 2 percent of the time, but gusts of and more occur regularly on the high tops, and speeds of have occasionally been recorded near sea level. The tidal range is , and ocean swells of frequently occur, which can make landings difficult or impossible at any time of year. The oceanic location protects the islands from snow, which lies for only about a dozen days per year.

The archipelago&#x27;s remote location and oceanic climate are matched in the UK only by a few smaller outlying islands such as the Flannan Isles, North Rona, Sula Sgeir, and the Bishop&#x27;s Isles at the southern edge of the Outer Hebrides. Administratively, St Kilda was part of the parish of Harris in the traditional county of Inverness-shire. Today it is incorporated in the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar unitary authority (formerly Western Isles Islands Council).

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===
It has been known for some time that St Kilda was continuously inhabited for two millennia or more, from the Bronze Age to the 20th century. In 2015, the first direct evidence of earlier Neolithic settlement emerged, sherds of pottery of the Hebridean ware style, found to the east of the village. The subsequent discovery of a quarry for stone tools on Mullach Sgar above Village Bay led to finds of numerous stone hoe-blades, grinders and Skaill knives in the Village Bay &quot;cleitean&quot;, unique stone storage buildings (see below). These tools are also probably of Neolithic origin. 

The potsherds appear to have been made of local material, rather than material brought from other islands in the Hebrides, suggesting that the islands were settled in the 4th millennium BC. Iron Age pottery is also known. Archaeologist Alan Hunter Blair reported that &quot;the eastern end of Village Bay on St Kilda was occupied fairly intensively during the Iron Age period, although no house structures were found&quot;.

=== 13th to 18th centuries ===
The first written record of St Kilda may date from 1202 when an Icelandic cleric wrote of taking shelter on &quot;the islands that are called Hirtir&quot;. Early reports mentioned finds of brooches, an iron sword and Danish coins, and the enduring Norse place names indicate a sustained Viking presence on Hirta, but the visible evidence has been lost. In the late 14th century John of Fordun referred to it as &quot;the isle of Irte (&quot;insula de Irte&quot;), which is agreed to be under the Circius and on the margins of the world&quot;. The islands were historically part of the domain of the MacLeods of Harris, whose steward was responsible for the collection of rents in kind and other duties. The first detailed report of a visit to the islands dates from 1549, when Donald Munro suggested that: &quot;The inhabitants thereof simple poor people, scarce in religion, but M&#x27;Cloyd of Herray, his , or he he in sic office, in the at midsummer, with some chaplaine to baptize .&quot;

Coll MacDonald of Colonsay raided Hirta in 1615, removing 30 sheep and a quantity of barley. Thereafter, the islands developed a reputation for abundance. At the time of Martin Martin&#x27;s visit in 1697 the population was 180 and the steward travelled with a &quot;company&quot; of up to 60 persons to which he &quot;elected the most &#x27;meagre&#x27; among his friends in the neighbouring islands, to that number and took them periodically to St Kilda to enjoy the nourishing and plentiful, if primitive, fare of the island, and so be restored to their wonted health and strength.&quot;

According to Keay and Keay (1994), until the early 19th century the islanders&#x27; &quot;close relationship with nature had taken the ritual form of Druidism&quot;, whilst their understanding of Christianity shaped their relationships with one another: a combination of &quot;natural devoutness and superstitious character&quot;. Macauley (1764) claimed the existence of a &quot;druidic&quot; circle of stones fixed perpendicularly in the ground near the Stallar House on Boreray. However, by 1875 all trace of this had gone and according to John Sands “the St Kildans seem never to have heard of it”.

Rachel Chiesley, Lady Grange was held on St Kilda from 1734 to 1741. The church minister of Harris, Kenneth Macaulay, visited St Kilda in 1759 on behalf of the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge (SSPCK), and published in 1764 &quot;The History of St Kilda, containing a Description of this Remarkable Island, the Manners and Customs of its Inhabitants, the Religious and Pagan Antiquities there found, with many other curious and interesting particulars.&quot;

Visiting ships brought cholera and smallpox in the 18th century. In 1727, the loss of life was so high that too few residents remained to man the boats, and new families were brought in from Harris to replace them. By 1758 the population had risen to 88, and it had reached just under 100 by the end of the century. This figure remained fairly constant from the 18th century until 1852, when 36 islanders, with the help of the Highland and Island Emigration Society, emigrated to Australia on board the &quot;Priscilla&quot;; reducing the population to 70. Among the emigrants was Ewen Gillies. The laird of St Kilda, Sir John MacLeod, tried to persuade some of the group to return to the island; when they were unconvinced, he paid for their voyage to Australia. Eighteen of the 36 St Kildans died of sickness on the ship or in quarantine. The island never fully recovered from the population loss.The emigration was in part a response to the laird&#x27;s closure of the church and manse for several years during the Disruption that created the Free Church of Scotland.

=== Religion ===

A missionary called Alexander Buchan went to St Kilda in 1705, but despite his long stay, the idea of organised religion did not take hold. This changed when Rev. John MacDonald, the &quot;Apostle of the North&quot;, arrived in 1822. He set about his mission with zeal, preaching 13 lengthy sermons during his first 11 days. He returned regularly and raised funds on behalf of the St Kildans, although privately he was appalled by their lack of religious knowledge. The islanders took to him with enthusiasm and wept when he left for the last time eight years later. His successor, who arrived on 3 July 1830, was Rev. Neil Mackenzie, a resident Church of Scotland minister who greatly improved the conditions of the inhabitants. He reorganised island agriculture, was instrumental in the rebuilding of the village (see below) and supervised the building of a new church and manse. With help from the Gaelic School Society, MacKenzie and his wife introduced formal education to Hirta, beginning a daily school to teach reading, writing and arithmetic and a Sunday school for religious education.

Mackenzie left in 1844. No new minister was appointed for a decade and as a result, the school closed on the MacKenzie&#x27;s departure and although he had achieved a great deal, the weakness of the St Kildans&#x27; dependence on external authority was exposed in 1865 with the arrival of Rev. John Mackay. Despite their fondness for Mackenzie, who stayed in the Church of Scotland, the St Kildans declared in favour of the new Free Church of Scotland during the Great Disruption. Mackay, the new Free Church minister, placed an uncommon emphasis on religious observance. He introduced a routine of three two-to-three-hour services on Sunday at which attendance was effectively compulsory. One visitor noted in 1875 that: &quot;The Sabbath was a day of intolerable gloom. At the clink of the bell, the whole flock hurry to Church with sorrowful looks and eyes bent upon the ground. It is considered sinful to look to the right or to the left.&quot;

Time spent in religious gatherings interfered seriously with the practical routines of the island. Old ladies and children who made noise in church were lectured at length and warned of dire punishments in the afterworld. During a period of food shortages on the island, a relief vessel arrived on a Saturday, but the minister said that the islanders had to spend the day preparing for church on the Sabbath, and it was Monday before supplies were landed. Children were forbidden to play games and required to carry a Bible wherever they went. Mackay remained minister on St Kilda for 24 years.

The church and manse have recently been restored and further restoration is planned for the 200th anniversary of the church. Visitors can see how they may have appeared in the 1920s.

=== Way of life ===
Most modern commentators feel that the predominant theme of life on St Kilda was isolation. When Martin Martin visited the islands in 1697, the only means of making the journey was by open boat, which could take several days and nights of rowing and sailing across the ocean and was next to impossible in autumn and winter. According to a St Kilda diarist writing in 1908, vicious storms could be expected at any time between September and March. More modern records from the National Trust for Scotland record gales for 75 days a year with peak winds around whilst peak wave heights on the Scottish west coast have been recorded at .

In the mid 18th century the St Kildans are recorded as speaking a &quot;very corrupt dialect of the Galic adulterated with a little mixture of the Norvegian tongue.&quot;

Separated by distance and weather, the natives knew little of mainland and international politics. After the Battle of Culloden in 1746, it was rumoured that Prince Charles Edward Stuart and some of his senior Jacobite aides had escaped to St Kilda. An expedition was launched, and in due course British soldiers were ferried ashore to Hirta. They found a deserted village, as the St Kildans, fearing pirates, had fled to caves to the west. When the St Kildans were persuaded to come down, the soldiers discovered that the isolated natives knew nothing of the prince and had never heard of King George II either.

Even in the late 19th century, the islanders could communicate with the rest of the world only by lighting a bonfire on the summit of Conachair which would, weather permitting, be visible to those on the isles of Harris and the Uists, or by using the &quot;St Kilda mailboat&quot;. This was the invention of John Sands, who visited in 1877. During his stay, a shipwreck left nine Austrian sailors marooned there, and by February supplies were running low. Sands attached a message to a lifebuoy salvaged from the &quot;Peti Dubrovacki&quot; and threw it into the sea. Nine days later it was picked up in Birsay, Orkney, and a rescue was arranged. The St Kildans, building on this idea, would fashion a piece of wood into the shape of a boat, attach it to a bladder made of sheepskin, and place in it a small bottle or tin containing a message. Launched when the wind came from the north-west, two-thirds of the messages were later found on the west coast of Scotland or in Norway.
===Diet===

Another significant feature of St Kilda life was diet. The islanders kept sheep and some cattle, and were able to grow a limited amount of food crops such as barley and potatoes on the better-drained land in Village Bay; in many ways the islands can be seen as a large mixed farm. Samuel Johnson reported in the 18th century that sheep&#x27;s milk was made &quot;into small cheeses&quot; by the St Kildans. They generally eschewed fishing because of the heavy, northern seas and unpredictable weather. The mainstay of their food supplies was the profusion of island birds, especially gannet and fulmar. These they harvested as eggs and young birds and ate both fresh and cured. Adult puffins were also caught using fowling rods. The method involved the use of a flexible pole with a noose on the end; a flick of the wrist would flip the noose over the puffin&#x27;s head and it was killed before its struggles could alarm other birds. A 1764 census described a daily consumption by the 90 inhabitants of &quot;36 wildfoul eggs and 18 wildfoul&quot; (i.e. seabirds).

This feature of island life came at a price. When Henry Brougham visited in 1799 he noted that &quot;the air is infected by a stench almost insupportable – a compound of rotten fish, filth of all sorts and stinking seafowl&quot;. An excavation of the &quot;Taigh an t-Sithiche&quot; (the &quot;house of the faeries&quot; – see below) in 1877 by Sands unearthed the remains of gannet, sheep, cattle, and limpets amidst various stone tools. The building is between 1,700 and 2,500 years old, which suggests that the St Kildan diet had changed little over the millennia. Indeed, the tools were recognised by the St Kildans, who could put names to them as similar devices were still in use.

Razorbill, guillemot, and fulmar eggs were collected before the late 1920s in St Kilda&#x27;s islands by their men scaling the cliffs. The eggs were buried in St Kilda peat ash to be eaten through the cold, northern winters. The eggs were considered to taste like duck eggs in taste and nourishment.

These fowling activities involved considerable skills in climbing, especially on the precipitous sea stacks. An important island tradition involved the &quot;Mistress Stone&quot;, a door-shaped opening in the rocks northwest of Ruival over-hanging a gully. Young men of the island had to undertake a ritual there to prove themselves on the crags and worthy of taking a wife. Martin Martin wrote:


Another important aspect of St Kildan life was the daily &quot;parliament&quot;. This was a meeting held in the street every morning after prayers and attended by all the adult males during the course of which they would decide upon the day&#x27;s activities. No one led the meeting, and all men had the right to speak. According to Steel (1988), &quot;Discussion frequently spread discord, but never in recorded history were feuds so bitter as to bring about a permanent division in the community&quot;. This notion of a free society influenced Enric Miralles&#x27; vision for the new Scottish Parliament Building, opened in October 2004.

Whatever the privations, the St Kildans were fortunate in some respects, for their isolation spared them some of the evils of life elsewhere. Martin noted in 1697 that the citizens seemed &quot;happier than the generality of mankind as being almost the only people in the world who feel the sweetness of true liberty&quot;, and in the 19th century their health and well being was contrasted favourably with conditions elsewhere in the Hebrides. Theirs was not a utopian society; the islanders had ingenious wooden locks for their property, and financial penalties were exacted for misdemeanours. Nonetheless, no resident St Kildan is known to have fought in a war, and in four centuries of history, no serious crime committed by an islander was recorded there.

=== Tourism in the 19th century ===

Norman Heathcote visited the islands in 1898 and 1899 and wrote a book about his experiences. During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds&#x27; eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. &quot;For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy&quot;. The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially &quot;tetanus infantum&quot;, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 per cent during the late 19th century. The &quot;cnatan na gall&quot; (lit. &quot;flu of the foreigner&quot;) or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.

By the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. There was talk of an evacuation in 1875 during MacKay&#x27;s time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and there was no obvious sign that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.

=== First World War ===
Early in the First World War, the Royal Navy erected a signal station on Hirta, and daily communications with the mainland were established for the first time. On the morning of 15 May 1918, the German submarine SM U-90 arrived in Village Bay and, after issuing a warning, started shelling the island. Seventy-two shells were fired and the wireless station was destroyed. The manse, church, and jetty storehouse were damaged, but there was no loss of life. One eyewitness recalled: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t what you would call a bad submarine because it could have blowed every house down because they were all in a row there. He only wanted Admiralty property. One lamb was killed... all the cattle ran from one side of the island to the other when they heard the shots.&quot;

As a result of this attack, a 4-inch Mark III QF gun was erected on a promontory overlooking Village Bay, but it never saw action. Of greater significance to the islanders were the introduction of regular contact with the outside world and the development of a money-based economy. This made life easier for the St Kildans but also made them less self-reliant. Both were factors in the evacuation of the island little more than a decade later.

&quot;Ironically, things improved with the war, which brought a naval detachment and regular deliveries of mail and food from naval supply vessels but when these services were withdrawn at end of the war, the sense of isolation increased. Able bodied young islanders left for a better life, resulting in a breakdown of the island economy&quot;.

=== Evacuation and aftermath ===
Numerous factors led to the evacuation of St Kilda. The islands&#x27; inhabitants had existed for centuries in relative isolation until tourism and the presence of the military during the First World War led the islanders to seek alternatives to privations they routinely suffered. The changes made to the island by visitors in the 19th century disconnected the islanders from the way of life that had allowed their forebears to survive in this environment. Despite the construction of a small jetty in 1902, the islands remained at the weather&#x27;s mercy.

After the end of the Great War, most of the young men left the island, and the population fell from 73 in 1920 to 37 in 1928. After the death of four men from influenza in 1926, there was a succession of crop failures in the 1920s. Investigations by the University of Aberdeen into the soil where crops had been grown have shown that there had been contamination by lead and other pollutants, caused by the use of seabird carcasses and peat ash in the manure used on the fields. This occurred over a lengthy period of time, as manuring practices became more intensive, and may have been a factor in the evacuation.

The last straw came with the death of a young woman, Mary Gillies, who fell ill with appendicitis in January 1930 and was taken to the mainland for treatment. She died in hospital, having given birth to a daughter who also died. It was assumed that she had died of appendicitis, but her son Norman John Gillies discovered in 1991 that she had died of pneumonia. All the cattle and sheep were taken off the island two days before the evacuation by the tourist boat &quot;Dunara Castle&quot; for sale on the mainland. However, all the island&#x27;s working dogs were drowned in the bay because they could not be taken. Although the cats were left behind, many did not survive the winter. In 1931, the remaining cats were shot to protect the native birds and rodents. On 29 August 1930, the ship HMS &quot;Harebell&quot; took the remaining 36 inhabitants to Morvern on the Scottish mainland, a decision they took collectively themselves. 

The morning of the evacuation promised a perfect day. The sun rose out of a calm and sparkling sea and warmed the impassive cliffs of Oiseval. The sky was hopelessly blue and the sight of Hirta, green and pleasant as the island of so many careless dreams, made parting all the more difficult. Observing tradition the islanders left an open Bible and a small pile of oats in each house, locked all the doors and at 7 am boarded the &quot;Harebell&quot;. Although exhausted by the strain and hard work of the last few days, they were reported to have stayed cheerful throughout the operation. But as the long antler of Dun fell back onto the horizon and the familiar outline of the island grew faint, the severing of an ancient tie became a reality and the St Kildans gave way to tears.
One source states that &quot;officials found forestry work for the men, and most of them were settled at Lochaline near Oban, while other families went to live at Strome Ferry, Ross-shire, Culcabock near Inverness, and at Culross, Fife&quot;. Barclay visited the resettled islanders and found that some were experiencing difficulties with disillusionment and adjustment, which she reported to the Scottish Department of Health. The last of the native St Kildans, Rachel Johnson, died in 2016 at the age of 93, having been evacuated at the age of eight.

In 1931, the laird, Sir Reginald MacLeod of MacLeod, sold the islands to Lord Dumfries, later the 5th Marquess of Bute. For the next 26 years they saw few people, save for the occasional summer visitors or a returning St Kildan family. Lord Dumfries was an ornithologist and bought the islands to preserve them as a bird sanctuary, leaving them to the National Trust for Scotland on his death in 1956.

The story of St Kilda has attracted artistic interpretations, including Michael Powell&#x27;s 1937 film &quot;The Edge of the World&quot; and an opera.

=== Military occupation ===
The islands saw no military activity during the Second World War, remaining uninhabited, but three aircraft crash sites remain from that period. A Bristol Beaufighter LX798 based at RAF Port Ellen on Islay crashed into Conachair within of the summit on the night of 3–4 June 1943. A year later, just before midnight on 7 June 1944, the day after D-Day, a Short Sunderland flying boat ML858 was wrecked at the head of Gleann Mòr. A small plaque in the church is dedicated to those who died in this accident.

A Vickers Wellington bomber crashed on the south coast of Soay in 1942 or 1943. Not until 1978 was any formal attempt made to investigate the wreck, and its identity has not been absolutely determined. Amongst the wreckage, a Royal Canadian Air Force cap badge was discovered, which suggests it may have been HX448 of 7 Operational Training Unit which went missing on a navigation exercise on 28 September 1942. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the Wellington is LA995 of 303 Ferry Training Unit which was lost on 23 February 1943.

In 1955 the British government decided to incorporate St Kilda into a missile-tracking range based in Benbecula, where test firings and flights are carried out. Thus in 1957 St Kilda became permanently inhabited once again. A variety of military buildings and masts have since been erected, including a canteen (which is not open to the public), the Puff Inn. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) leases St Kilda from the National Trust for Scotland for a nominal fee.

Hirta is still occupied year-round by a small number of civilians employed by defence contractor QinetiQ working in the military base (MOD Hebrides) on a monthly rotation. In 2009 the MOD announced that it was considering closing down its missile-testing ranges in the Western Isles, potentially leaving the Hirta base unmanned. In 2015 the base had to be temporarily evacuated due to adverse weather conditions.

In summer 2018, the MOD facilities were being restored as part of building a new base; one report stated that the project included &quot;replacing aged generators and accommodation blocks&quot;. With no permanent population, the island population can vary between 20 and 70, most living here temporarily. These inhabitants include MOD employees, National Trust for Scotland employees, and several scientists working on a Soay sheep research project.

==21st-century tourism==

Visits to St Kilda were encouraged until facilities closed due to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 but it has since reopened. 

The National Trust for Scotland has improved the village on Hirta over the years. &quot;They have reroofed the cottages on the main street, restored the church, and re-stacked stones that years of gales had toppled from the cleits, or bothies, that dot the volcanic landscape&quot;. One cottage, #3 on &quot;The Street&quot; has been more extensively restored and turned into the museum. However, a full restoration of the other cottages is not expected. 

The Historic Environment Scotland website states that &quot;the plain, two-bay church, with the schoolroom added to its north west in 1898&quot; was &quot;restored as they might have appeared in the 1920s.&quot; The site also explains that the &quot;arrangement of St Kilda Village along a curving street is the result of mid-19th century improvement ... Distinctive drystone storage structures, known as cleitan, are scattered throughout the landscape. There are over 1,400 cleitan known throughout the St Kilda archipelago, but they are concentrated in the area around the village&quot;. 
The National Trust for Scotland suggests that there is a great deal of interest in diving in the area as well as viewing of seabirds in &quot;Europe&#x27;s most important seabird colony, and one of the major seabird breeding stations in the North Atlantic. Before the closure, day trips for tourists were readily available, by boat, leaving from Stein Jetty, Skye. A review of St Kilda, written before facilities closed, warned that landing at the pier can be difficult in rough seas.

== Architecture ==

=== Prehistoric buildings ===
The oldest structures on St Kilda are the most enigmatic. Large sheepfolds lie inland from the existing village at &quot;An Lag Bho&#x27;n Tuath&quot; (English: the hollow in the north) and contain curious &quot;boat-shaped&quot; stone rings, or &quot;settings&quot;. Soil samples suggest a date of 1850 BC, but they are unique to St Kilda, and their purpose is unknown. In Gleann Mòr, (north-west of Village Bay beyond Hirta&#x27;s central ridge), there are 20 &quot;horned structures&quot;, essentially ruined buildings with a main court measuring about , two or more smaller cells and a forecourt formed by two curved or horn-shaped walls. Again, nothing like them exists anywhere else in Europe, and their original use is unknown. Also in Gleann Mòr is &quot;Taigh na Banaghaisgeich&quot;, the &quot;Amazon&#x27;s House&quot;. As Martin (1703) reported, many St Kilda tales are told about this female warrior.
This Amazon is famous in their traditions: her house or dairy of stone is yet extant; some of the inhabitants dwell in it all summer, though it be some hundred years old; the whole is built of stone, without any wood, lime, earth, or mortar to cement it, and is built in form of a circle pyramid-wise towards the top, having a vent in it, the fire being always in the centre of the floor; the stones are long and thin, which supplies the defect of wood; the body of this house contains not above nine persons sitting; there are three beds or low vaults that go off the side of the wall, a pillar betwixt each bed, which contains five men apiece; at the entry to one of these low vaults is a stone standing upon one end fix&#x27;d; upon this they say she ordinarily laid her helmet; there are two stones on the other side, upon which she is reported to have laid her sword: she is said to have been much addicted to hunting, and that in her time all the space betwixt this isle and that of Harries, was one continued tract of dry land.
Similar stories of a female warrior who hunted the now-submerged land between the Outer Hebrides and St Kilda are reported from Harris. The structure&#x27;s forecourt is akin to the other &quot;horned structures&quot; in the immediate area, but like Martin&#x27;s &quot;Amazon&quot; its original purpose is the stuff of legend rather than archaeological fact.

Much more is known of the hundreds of unique &quot;cleitean&quot; that decorate the archipelago. These dome-shaped structures are constructed of flat boulders with a cap of turf on the top. This enables the wind to pass through the cavities in the wall but keeps the rain out. They were used for storing peat, nets, grain, preserved flesh and eggs, manure, and hay, and as a shelter for lambs in winter. The date of origin of this St Kildan invention is unknown, but they were in continuous use from prehistoric times until the 1930 evacuation. More than 1,200 ruined or intact &quot;cleitean&quot; remain on Hirta and a further 170 on the neighbouring islands. House no. 16 in the modern village has an early Christian stone cross built into the front wall, which may date from the 7th century.

=== Medieval village ===
A medieval village lay near Tobar Childa, about from the shore, at the foot of the slopes of Conachair. The oldest building is an underground passage with two small annexes called &quot;Taigh an t-Sithiche&quot; (house of the faeries) which dates to between 500 BC and 300 AD. The St Kildans believed it was a house or hiding place, although a more recent theory suggests that it was an ice house.

Extensive ruins of field walls and &quot;cleitean&quot; and the remnants of a medieval &quot;house&quot; with a beehive-shaped annexe remain. Nearby is the &quot;Bull&#x27;s House&quot;, a roofless rectangular structure in which the island&#x27;s bull was kept during winter. Tobar Childa itself is supplied by two springs that lie just outside the Head Wall that was constructed around the Village to prevent sheep and cattle gaining access to the cultivated areas within its boundary. There were 25 to 30 houses altogether. Most were blackhouses of typical Hebridean design, but some older buildings were made of corbelled stone and turfed rather than thatched. The turf was used to prevent the ingress of wind and rain, and the older &quot;beehive&quot; buildings resembled green hillocks rather than dwellings.

=== Post-Medieval structures ===
The Head Wall was built in 1834 when the medieval village was abandoned and a new one planned between Tobar Childa and the sea some down the slope. This came about as the result of a visit by Sir Thomas Dyke Ackland, one of the Members of Parliament for Devon. Appalled by the primitive conditions, he gave money for the building of a completely new settlement of thirty new blackhouses. These houses were made of dry stone, had thick walls, and were roofed with turf. Each typically had only one tiny window and a small opening for letting out smoke from the peat fire that burnt in the middle of the room. As a result, the interiors were blackened by soot. The cattle occupied one end of the house in winter, and once a year the straw from the floor was stripped out and spread on the ground.

In October 1860, several of the new dwellings were damaged by a severe gale, and repairs were sufficient only to make them suitable for use as byres. According to Alasdair MacGregor&#x27;s analysis of the settlement, the sixteen modern, zinc-roofed cottages amidst the black houses and new Factor&#x27;s house seen in most photographs of the native islanders were constructed around 1862.
One of the more poignant ruins on Hirta is the site of &quot;Lady Grange&#x27;s House&quot;. Lady Grange had been married to the Jacobite sympathiser James Erskine, Lord Grange, for 25 years when he decided that she might have overheard too many of his treasonable plottings. He had her kidnapped and secretly confined in Edinburgh for six months. From there she was sent to the Monach Isles, where she lived in isolation for two years. She was then taken to Hirta from 1734 to 1740, which she described as &quot;a vile neasty, stinking poor isle&quot;. After a failed rescue attempt, she was removed on her husband&#x27;s orders to the Isle of Skye, where she died. The &quot;house&quot; on Hirta which carries her name is a large cleit in the Village meadows.

Boswell and Johnson discussed the subject during their 1773 tour of the Hebrides. Boswell wrote: &quot;After dinner to-day, we talked of the extraordinary fact of Lady Grange&#x27;s being sent to St Kilda, and confined there for several years, without any means of relief. Dr Johnson said, if M&#x27;Leod would let it be known that he had such a place for naughty ladies, he might make it a very profitable island.&quot;
In the 1860s unsuccessful attempts were made to improve the landing area by blasting rocks. A small jetty was erected in 1877, but it was washed away in a storm two years later. In 1883 representations to the Napier Commission suggested the building of a replacement, but it was 1901 before the Congested Districts Board provided an engineer to enable one to be completed the following year. Nearby on the shoreline are some huge boulders which were known throughout the Highlands and Islands in the 19th century as &quot;Doirneagan Hirt&quot;, Hirta&#x27;s pebbles.

At one time, three churches stood on Hirta. Christ Church, in the site of the graveyard at the centre of the village, was in use in 1697 and was the largest, but this thatched-roof structure was too small to hold the entire population, and most of the congregation had to gather in the churchyard during services. St Brendan&#x27;s Church lay over a kilometre away on the slopes of Ruival, and St Columba&#x27;s at the west end of the village street, but little is left of these buildings. A new kirk and manse were erected at the east end of the village in 1830 and a Factor&#x27;s house in 1860.

=== Buildings on other islands ===

Dùn means &quot;fort&quot;, and there is but a single ruined wall of a structure said to have been built in the far-distant past by the Fir Bolg. The only &quot;habitation&quot; is &quot;Sean Taigh&quot; (old house), a natural cavern sometimes used as a shelter by the St Kildans when they were tending the sheep or catching birds. Soay has a primitive hut known as &quot;Taigh Dugan&quot; (Dugan&#x27;s house). This is little more than an excavated hole under a massive stone with two crude walls on the sides. The story of its creation relates to two sheep-stealing brothers from Lewis who came to St Kilda only to cause further trouble. Dugan was exiled to Soay, where he died; the other, called Fearchar Mòr, was sent to Stac an Armin, where he found life so intolerable he cast himself into the sea.

Boreray boasts the &quot;Cleitean MacPhàidein&quot;, a &quot;cleit village&quot; of three small bothies used on a regular basis during fowling expeditions. Here too are the ruins of &quot;Taigh Stallar&quot; (the steward&#x27;s house), which was similar to the Amazon&#x27;s house in Gleann Mòr although somewhat larger, and which had six bed spaces. The local tradition was that it was built by the &quot;Man of the Rocks&quot;, who led a rebellion against the landlord&#x27;s steward. It may be an example of an Iron Age wheelhouse and the associated remains of an agricultural field system were discovered in 2011. As a result of a smallpox outbreak on Hirta in 1724, three men and eight boys were marooned on Boreray until the following May. No fewer than 78 storage &quot;cleitean&quot; exist on Stac an Armin and a small bothy. A small bothy exists on the precipitous Stac Lee too, also used by fowlers.

==Fauna and flora==
=== Wildlife ===
St Kilda is a breeding ground for many important seabird species. One of the world&#x27;s largest colonies of northern gannets, totalling 30,000 pairs, amount to 24 per cent of the global population. There are 49,000 breeding pairs of Leach&#x27;s petrels, up to 90 per cent of the European population; 136,000 pairs of Atlantic puffins, about 30 per cent of the UK total breeding population, and 67,000 northern fulmar pairs, about 13 per cent of the UK total. Dùn is home to the largest colony of fulmars in Britain. Before 1828, St Kilda was their only UK breeding ground, but they have since spread and established colonies elsewhere, such as Fowlsheugh. The last great auk (&quot;Pinguinus impennis&quot;) seen in Britain was killed on Stac an Armin in July 1840. Unusual behaviour by St Kilda&#x27;s bonxies was recorded in 2007 during research into recent falls in the Leach&#x27;s petrel population. Using night-vision gear, ecologists observed the skuas hunting petrels at night, a remarkable strategy for a seabird. The St Kilda archipelago has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International for its seabird colonies.

Two wild animal taxa are unique to St Kilda: the St Kilda wren (&quot;Troglodytes troglodytes hirtensis&quot;), which is a subspecies of the Eurasian wren, and a subspecies of wood mouse known as the St Kilda field mouse (&quot;Apodemus sylvaticus hirtensis&quot;). A third taxon endemic to St Kilda, a subspecies of house mouse known as the St Kilda house mouse (&quot;Mus musculus muralis&quot;), vanished entirely after the departure of human inhabitants, as it was strictly associated with settlements and buildings. It had several traits in common with a sub-species (&quot;Mus musculus mykinessiensis&quot;) found on Mykines island in the Faroe Islands. The grey seal (&quot;Halichoerus grypus&quot;) now breeds on Hirta but did not do so before the 1930 evacuation.

The archipelago&#x27;s isolation has resulted in a lack of biodiversity. The most successful colonists with nearly two hundred species are the flies followed by beetles with approximately 140 species. There are no bees on the islands, so flies are probably important pollinators of plants. One beetle, the rare and endangered weevil, &quot;Ceutorhynchus insularis&quot;, is known from only Dùn and the Westmann Islands, an archipelago off the south-west coast of Iceland. Less than one hundred species of butterfly and moth occur, compared to 367 recorded on the Western Isles. Red admiral (&quot;Vanessa atalanta&quot;) and painted lady (&quot;Vanessa cardui&quot;) are two of only seven species of butterflies, both well known and common migrants. Common summer moths are the antler (&quot;Cerapteryx graminis&quot;), dark arches (&quot;Apamea monoglypha&quot;) and the migrant silver Y (&quot;Autographa gamma&quot;). One unusual moth recorded is the least carpet (&quot;Idaea rusticata&quot;), an occasional migrant, and in the UK, usually recorded in the south-east of England. On 4 September 2014 a rare vagrant oleander hawk-moth (&quot;Daphnis nerii&quot;) was recorded. Oleander is not found in the UK every year, and the larva has never been recorded in Britain.

Its plant life is heavily influenced by island&#x27;s natural environment such as the salt spray, strong winds and acidic peaty soils. No trees grow on the archipelago, although there are more than 130 different flowering plants, 162 species of fungi and 160 bryophytes. Several rarities exist amongst the 194 lichen species. Kelp thrives in the surrounding seas, which contain a diversity of unusual marine invertebrates. The St Kilda dandelion (&quot;Taraxacum pankhurstianum&quot;) is an endemic species of dandelion, identified in 2012.

The beach at Village Bay is unusual in that its short stretch of summer sand recedes in winter, exposing the large boulders on which it rests. A survey of the beach in 1953 found only a single resident species, the crustacean isopod &quot;Eurydice pulchra&quot;.

=== Soay sheep ===

On the inaccessible island of Soay are sheep of a unique type, which lived as feral animals and belonged to the owner of the islands, not to the islanders. These Soay sheep are believed to be remnants of the earliest sheep kept in Europe in the Neolithic Era, and are small, short-tailed, usually brown with white bellies, and have naturally moulting fleeces. About 200 Soay sheep remain on Soay itself, and soon after the evacuation a second feral population of them was established on Hirta, which at that time had no sheep; in 1994 these numbered between 600 and 1,700. A few Soays have been exported to form breeding populations in other parts of the world, where they are valued for their hardiness, small size and unusual appearance. On Hirta and Soay, the sheep prefer the &quot;Plantago&quot; pastures, which grow well in locations exposed to sea spray and include red fescue (&quot;Festuca rubra&quot;), sea plantain (&quot;Plantago maritima&quot;) and sea pink (&quot;Armeria maritima&quot;).

The St Kildans kept up to 2,000 of a different type of sheep on the islands of Hirta and Boreray. These were a Hebridean variety of the Scottish Dunface, a primitive sheep probably similar to those kept throughout Britain during the Iron Age. During the evacuation, all the islanders&#x27; sheep were removed from Hirta, but those on Boreray were left to become feral. These sheep are now regarded as a breed in their own right, the Boreray. The Boreray is one of the rarest British sheep and is one of the few remaining descendants of the Dunface (although some Scottish Blackface blood was introduced in the 19th century).

== Nature conservation ==
On his death on 14 August 1956, the Marquess of Bute&#x27;s will bequeathed the archipelago to the National Trust for Scotland provided they accepted the offer within six months. After much soul-searching, the executive committee agreed to do so in January 1957. The slow renovation and conservation of the village began, much of it undertaken by summer volunteer work parties. In addition, scientific research began on the feral Soay sheep population and other aspects of the natural environment. In 1957 the area was designated a national nature reserve.

In 1986 the islands became the first place in Scotland to be inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, for its terrestrial natural features. In 2004, the WHS was extended to include a large amount of the surrounding marine features as well as the islands themselves. In 2005 St Kilda became one of only two dozen global locations to be awarded mixed World Heritage Status for both &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;cultural&quot; significance. The islands share this honour with internationally important sites such as Machu Picchu in Peru, Mount Athos in Greece and the Ukhahlamba/Drakensberg Park in South Africa.

St Kilda is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, a National Scenic Area, a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and was a European Union Special Protection Area. Visiting yachts may find shelter in Village Bay, but those wishing to land are told to contact the National Trust for Scotland in advance. Concern exists about the introduction of non-native animal and plant species into such a fragile environment. In 2008 the National Trust for Scotland received the support of Scotland&#x27;s Minister for Environment, Michael Russell for their plan to ensure no rats came ashore from the &quot;Spinningdale&quot;, a UK-registered/Spanish-owned fishing trawler which grounded on Hirta on 1 February. There was concern that bird life on the island could be seriously affected. Fortunately, potential contaminants from the vessel including fuel, oils, bait and stores were successfully removed by Dutch salvage company Mammoet before the bird breeding season in early April.

St Kilda&#x27;s marine environment of underwater caves, arches and chasms, offers a very challenging but superlative diving experience. Such is the power of the North Atlantic swell that the effects of the waves can be detected below sea level.

<text>Film is a 1965 short film written by Samuel Beckett, his only screenplay. It was commissioned by Barney Rosset of Grove Press. Writing began on 5 April 1963 with a first draft completed within four days. A second draft was produced by 22 May and a 40-leaf shooting script followed thereafter. It was filmed in New York City in July 1964. Beckett and Alan Schneider originally wanted Charlie Chaplin, Zero Mostel and Jack MacGowran; however, they eventually did not get involved. Beckett then suggested Buster Keaton. James Karen, who was to have a small part in the film, also supported having Keaton. The filmed version differs from Beckett&#x27;s original script but with his approval since he was on set all the time, this being his only visit to the United States, as stated in the script printed in &quot;Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett&quot; (Faber and Faber, 1984).

It was remade by the British Film Institute (1979, 16 mm, 26 minutes) without Beckett&#x27;s supervision, as Film: a screenplay by Samuel Beckett. David Rayner Clark directed Max Wall.

It first appeared in print in &quot;Eh Joe and Other Writings&quot; (Faber and Faber, 1967).

==Synopsis==
Throughout the first two parts, almost everything is seen through the eye of the camera (designated in the script as E), although there are occasional moments when O&#x27;s perception is seen. In the third part, much more of O&#x27;s perception of the room and its contents is given. In order to distinguish between the two perceptions, objects seen by O were shot through a lens-gauze, blurring his perception while E&#x27;s perception was shot without gauze or filters, keeping the images sharp.

===The street===
The film opens onto a rippled image that fills the entire screen. Without colour, it is difficult to discern what is being shown, but it is alive. As it moves, it is shown to be an extreme close-up of an eyelid; it fills the entire screen. The eye opens, slowly, closes, opens again, blinks and then fades into a different rippled image, still somewhat organic but changed, still. As the camera begins to pan right and up, it is discernable as a wall; we are outside a building (an old factory situated in Lower Manhattan). It is summer, though it is hard to tell. The camera&#x27;s movement is not smooth. It is as if it is looking for something. Eventually, it loses interest and pans left and down back to the wall.

Suddenly, the camera (E) shifts violently to the left. A man (O) is hurrying along the wall from left to right. He pauses, hugging the wall, and E gets a chance to focus on him. He has on a long dark overcoat, the collar of which is turned up and his hat is pulled down over his face. (Keaton had asked Beckett what O was wearing underneath. &quot;I hadn&#x27;t thought of that,&quot; the author admitted and then proposed, &quot;the same coat&quot;, which appealed to both men.) He is hanging onto a briefcase with his left hand whilst trying to shield the exposed side of his face with the other. He realises he&#x27;s been seen and cowers against the wall; E quickly shifts behind him.

No longer conscious of being observed, O starts off again, knocking over a trestle and stumbling over a railway sleeper—anything to stay as close as possible to the wall. He charges into a man and woman, knocking the man&#x27;s hat off. E looks from the man&#x27;s face to the woman&#x27;s and back again. The man has a moustache and is wearing a pince-nez. They have been consulting a newspaper, which the woman keeps hold of. They both look appalled at what has happened.

E moves back to a long shot and watches O barge through and on his way. The man replaces his hat, takes off his pince-nez. and looks after the fleeing figure. The couple look at each other and the man &quot;opens his mouth to &quot; but the woman shushes him, uttering the only sound in the whole play. Together they turn to stare directly at E as an open-mouthed expression takes over their faces; they can not bear to look at what they have seen and turn their faces away. But what had they seen?
The action shifts back to O just as he reaches and turns a corner. He heads off down the street until he realises he is at the right doorway. He enters.

===Stairs===
The camera cuts to the vestibule. The viewer is directly behind O. Stairs lead up on the left, but O veers right and pauses, pulling himself together. He takes his pulse and E moves in. As soon as he becomes aware of E&#x27;s presence he rushes down a couple of steps and cowers beside the wall until the camera retreats a little. When it does he reverses back up to street-level and then begins up the stairs.

A frail old woman is coming down. The camera gives us a brief close-up. &quot;She carries a tray of flowers slung from her neck by a strap. She descends slowly and with fumbling feet.&quot; O backs up and hurries down the steps to the right again where he sits down on a step and presses his face against the balusters. He glances up briefly to see where she is, then hides his head from view.

As the woman reaches the bottom of the stairs, she looks straight into the lens. The expression on her face changes to the one of wide-eyed horror that was displayed on the faces of the man and woman outside. She closes her eyes and collapses. E checks on where the man had been, but O has made his escape. His coat tails are seen flying up the stairs.

E chases after him and finds him at the top of the first flight. He looks around to see if there is anyone about. Satisfied, he turns left and, not without some difficulty, opens the door to a room and enters. E slips in unnoticed as O locks the door behind him and then takes his pulse once more.

===The room===
We find ourselves in a &quot;small barely furnished room.&quot; The man—and the camera following him from behind—survey its contents: a dog and a cat share a basket, a caged parrot and a goldfish in its bowl sit atop a small table. The walls are bare, apart from a mirror and an unframed picture pinned to the wall: a Sumerian Tell Asmar figurine with big eyes (described in the screenplay as &quot;the face of God the Father&quot;). There is also a couch with a filthy pillow, some blankets and a rug on it, a rocking chair with a &quot;curiously carved headrest&quot; and there is a window with a tattered roller blind with full-length net curtains to either side.

====Preparation of room====
Systematically, O takes each object or creature in the room and disables its ability to &#x27;see&#x27; him: he closes the blind and pulls the net curtains across, he covers the mirror with the rug, the cat and dog (“a shy and uncooperative, little Chihuahua”) are – with some difficulty – ejected from the room and the picture is torn up. Although stated simply, the mechanics needed to execute these tasks are laborious (e.g., as he passes the window, he hides behind the blanket which he holds in front of himself to cover the mirror and he carries the cat and dog facing away from him as he tries to put them out the door).

After all the above, he goes to sit in the chair. There are two holes in the headrest that suggest eyes. He ignores them and sits. O takes the folder from his case and goes to open it, but there are &quot;two eyelets, well proportioned&quot;; he turns the folder through 90° but he&#x27;s disturbed by the parrot&#x27;s eye and has to get up and cover the cage with his coat. He sits again, repeats the same process with his folder and then has to get up and cover the goldfish bowl, too.

&quot;Beckett initially contemplated setting &quot;Film&quot; in the evening, but had to decide against it for a practical reason: &#x27;to remove all possibility of his putting off light in room.&#x27;&quot;

====Period in rocking chair====
Finally O sits down opposite the denuded wall, opens the folder, and takes out seven photographs of himself, which he examines in sequence:

# 6 months old – in his mother&#x27;s arms
# 4 years old – kneeling in an attitude of prayer
# 15 years old – in his school blazer, teaching a dog to beg
# 20 years old – in his graduation gown, receiving his scroll from the Rector
# 21 years old – with his arm around his fiancée
# 25 years old – a newly enlisted man, with a little girl in his arms
# 30 years old – looking over forty, wearing a patch over one eye and looking grim

He spends twice as long on pictures 5 and 6. After he looks at the seventh photograph for a few seconds, he rips it up and drops it on the floor. He then works his way through the rest of the photos in reverse order, looking at each one briefly again and then tearing it up. The photograph of him as an infant must be on a tougher mount and he has some difficulty with that one. “[I]n Beckett the distant past is always more tenacious than recent events.” Afterwards he rocks slightly, hands holding the armrests and then checks his pulse once more.

O is now in a similar situation to the man in &quot;A Piece of Monologue&quot;, who has also destroyed all his old photographs and now stands facing a similarly blank wall.

====Investment proper====
As O begins to doze off, E begins to move round to his left. Suddenly, O realises he is being watched and turns his head violently to the right. E moves behind him again. He resumes rocking and dozes off. This time E whirls round to the right, passing the window, the mirror, the birdcage and fishbowl and finally stops in front of the space on the wall where the picture was.

E turns around and, for the first time, we are face-to-face with O, asleep in his rocking chair. All of a sudden he wakes and stares straight into the camera lens. He looks very much like the man in the seventh photograph only much older. He still has the eye patch.

He half starts from the chair, then stiffens. Gradually, the horrified look we have seen before on the couple and the old woman&#x27;s faces appears on his. He is looking at himself, but not the scruffy, wearish man we have been watching. The man before him, standing with a big nail beside his head, has a look of &quot;acute &quot;intentness&quot;&quot; on his face. O slumps back into the chair and starts rocking. He closes his eye and the expression fades. He covers his face with his hands briefly and then looks again. This time we see the face of E in close-up, just the eyes.

O covers his eyes again, bows his head. The rocking dies down and then stops. The screen goes black. We then see the opening image of the eye, which is frozen, and the credits are presented over it. Once finished, the eye closes and the film is over.

==Interpretation==
:&quot;The greatest Irish film.&quot; – Gilles Deleuze

:A &quot;load of old bosh.&quot; – Dilys Powell (&quot;The Sunday Times&quot;)

The work is studied by and has been the subject of criticism from both film and theatre scholars, with the former tending to study the film as shot, the latter tending to study the script as written. Critical opinion is mixed, but it is generally held in higher regard by film scholars than it is by theatre or Beckett scholars. The views above represent extremes. A &#x27;middle-ground&#x27; review would probably be &quot;a poor attempt by a genuine writer to move into a medium that he simply hadn&#x27;t the flair or understanding of to make a success&quot;. Beckett&#x27;s own opinion was that it was an “interesting failure.”

The film opens and closes with close-ups of a sightless eye. This inevitably evokes the notorious opening sequence of &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot; in which a human eye is sliced open with a razor blade. In fact, &quot;The Eye&quot; was an early title for &quot;Film&quot;, though admittedly, at that time, he had not thought of the need for the opening close-up. As a student of French literature, Beckett would have been familiar with Victor Hugo’s poem &quot;La Conscience&quot;. ‘&quot;Conscience&quot;’ in French can mean either ‘conscience’ in the English sense or ‘consciousness’ and the double meaning is important. Hugo&#x27;s poem concerns a man haunted by an eye that stares at him unceasingly from the sky. He runs away from it, ever further, even to the grave, where, in the tomb, the eye awaits him. The man is Cain. He has been trying to escape consciousness of himself, the self that killed his brother, but his conscience will not let him rest. The eye/I is always present and, when he can run no further, must be faced in the tomb.

&quot;Film&quot; takes its inspiration from the 18th-century Idealist Irish philosopher Berkeley. At the beginning of the work, Beckett uses the famous quotation: &quot;esse est percipi&quot; (to be is to be perceived). Notably, Beckett leaves off a portion of Berkeley&#x27;s edict, which reads in full: “&quot;esse est percipi aut percipere&quot;” (to be is to be perceived or to perceive). Alan Schneider, the director of Film, was once asked if he could provide an explanation that ‘the man in the street’ could understand:

: &quot;It&#x27;s a movie about the perceiving eye, about the perceived and the perceiver – two aspects of the same man. The perceiver desires like mad to perceive and the perceived tries desperately to hide. Then, in the end, one wins.&quot;

In between takes on the set near the Brooklyn Bridge, Keaton told a reporter something similar, summarizing the theme as &quot;a man may keep away from everybody but he can&#x27;t get away from himself.&quot;

In Beckett&#x27;s original script, the two main characters, the camera and the man it is pursuing are referred to as E (the Eye) and O (the Object). This simplistic division might lead one to assume that the Eye is only interested in the man it is pursuing. This may be true, but it does not mean it will not have the same effect on anyone who comes in contact with it. “E is both part of O and not part of O; E is also the camera and, through the camera, the eye of the spectator as well. But E is also self, not merely O&#x27;s self but the self of any person or people, specifically that of the other characters — the elderly couple and the flower-lady — who respond to its stare with that look of horror.” E is, so to speak, O&#x27;s blind eye. &quot;He has the function of making all with whom he comes into contact self-aware.”

O does everything physically possible to avoid being seen by others, but the only thing he can do to avoid perception by an “all seeing god” is to tear up his picture, a symbolic act, as if saying, “If I don&#x27;t believe you exist you can&#x27;t see me.” There is no one there to see him for what he really is other than himself and so, in this godless world, it is only fitting that E, representing O&#x27;s self-perception, would appear standing where the picture has been torn from the wall. O also destroys the photographs of his past, his &#x27;memories&#x27; of who he was. Now all that remains for O is to escape from himself - which he achieves by falling asleep until woken by E&#x27;s intense gaze. The room is more figurative than literal, like many of Beckett&#x27;s rooms, “as much psychological as physical, &#x27;rooms of the mind&#x27;, as one ... actor called them.”

If Beckett were Shakespeare he might well have written: &quot;To be seen or not to be seen, that is the question.&quot; It is an issue that concerns many of Beckett&#x27;s characters. At the end of the first act of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, when the boy wants to know what to tell Mr Godot, Vladimir tells him: “Tell him … (&quot;he hesitates&quot;) … tell him you saw us. (&quot;Pause.&quot;) You did see us, didn’t you?” But what happens when you are alone? The narrator of &quot;The Unnamable&quot; answers: “They depart, one by one, and the voices go on, it’s not theirs, they were never there, there was never anyone but you, talking to you about you…” The old woman in &quot;Rockaby&quot; appears to be the exact opposite of O but although she actively seeks to be seen by someone while O does everything to avoid perceivedness, the irony is that both characters are alone with only themselves for company.

Beckett&#x27;s script has been interpreted in various ways. R. C. Lamont writes that &quot;&quot;Film&quot; deals with the apprenticeship to death, the process of detaching oneself from life. Like the Tibetan &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;, it teaches the gradual dissolution of self. The veiling of the windows and mirrors, the covering of the birdcage – the extinction of light, reflection and light – are so many ritualistic steps to be taken before final immobility, the resignation of the end.” At the end of &quot;Film&quot;, O is seated in his rocker with his face buried in his hands; at the end of &quot;Rockaby&quot;, the old woman&#x27;s head inclines forward as if, finally, she had died. The final scene in &quot;Film&quot; is also comparable to the moment in the library when the old man in &quot;That Time&quot; sees his own reflection in the glass covering a painting.

It could be tempting to think of O and E as a Beckettian &quot;Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot; – indeed in notes for the first draft Beckett did toy “with the idea of making ‘E tall’ and ‘O short (and) fat’ which corresponds with the dual physique of Jekyll and Hyde” – but &quot;Film&quot; is not concerned with representations of good and evil, only with the concept of the second self, of pursuer and pursued.” The special relationship existing between O and E - an atypical case of Doppelgänger - constitutes what has been called &quot;palindromic identity.&quot;

For Linda Ben-Zvi, “Beckett does not merely reproduce the modernist critique of and anxiety over technology and the reproduction of art; he attaches &#x27;no truth value&#x27; to his critique of technology and the reproduction of the gaze. Instead, he creates a dialogue that awakens and revitalises the uncritical perception of his audience... The work not only is predicated on the form but invariably becomes a critique of its form.&quot; Having written a play titled &quot;Play&quot; and a song called &quot;Song&quot;, it comes as no surprise that Beckett would entitle his first foray into cinema as &quot;Film&quot;. The title supports Ben-Zvi&#x27;s interpretation in that it is a film about cinematic technology: how the movie camera and photographic images are used in &quot;Film&quot; are essential to understanding it. When he writes, “No truth value attaches to above, regarded as of merely structural and dramatic convenience”, Beckett takes the emphasis away from Berkeley&#x27;s maxim thus stressing the dramatic structure of the work. The viewers are being asked to consider the work structurally and dramatically rather than emotionally or philosophically.

Film critic and film historian Andrew Sarris briefly mentions &quot;Film&quot; in his book, &quot;The American cinema: directors and directions, 1929-1968&quot;. Sarris discusses &quot;Film&quot; in the context of his section on the film career of Buster Keaton, writing that: &quot;Even Samuel Beckett contributed to the desecration of the Keaton mask by involving the actor of absurdity before its time in a dreary exercise called &quot;Film&quot;, the most pretentious title in all cinema.&quot;

==Beckett and Keaton==
Beckett had never seen Schneider direct any of his plays and yet continued to entrust him with the work. However, for this particular project, Beckett became personally involved. Schneider has speculated that it may simply have been the opportunity to work directly with Keaton. It has even been suggested that one inspiration for &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; might have come from a 1949 film called &quot;The Lovable Cheat&quot; in which Keaton has a small part as a man who is convinced by the main character, who owes him money, to wait endlessly for a man named Godeau, who will pay the debt.

When Schneider managed to hunt up Keaton, he found that genius of the silent screen — old, broke, ill, and alone — some $2 million ahead in a four-handed poker game with an imaginary Louis B. Mayer of MGM and two other invisible Hollywood moguls.

“Yes, I accept the offer,&quot; were silent Keaton&#x27;s unexpected first words to Schneider. Keaton was dying even as they made the film. &quot;We didn’t know that,&quot; Rosset told interviewer Patsy Southgate in 1990, &quot;but looking back at it, the signs were there. Couldn’t speak — he was not so much difficult, he just wasn’t there.&quot; Keaton would in fact die eighteen months after the shooting of &quot;Film&quot;.

From this one might think that Keaton jumped at the chance, but this was not the case. James Karen remembers:

: “He had to be talked into it by Eleanor [his wife] and I remember calling and saying, ‘You know, it could be your &quot;Les Enfants du paradis&quot;. It could be that wonderful, wonderful thing.’”

Beckett had wanted to work with Keaton several years earlier, when he offered him the role of Lucky in the American stage premiere of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, but Buster turned it down. It&#x27;s said that Buster didn&#x27;t understand &quot;Godot&quot; and had misgivings about this script as well. Presumably this went a long way to make him think twice about this new project.

During a meeting with historian and documentary filmmaker Kevin Brownlow, Beckett was quite forthcoming:

: “Buster Keaton was inaccessible. He had a poker mind as well as a poker face. I doubt if he ever read the text - I don&#x27;t think he approved of it or liked it. But he agreed to do it and he was very competent … Of course, I had seen his silent films and enjoyed them – don&#x27;t suppose I could remember them now. He had a young woman with him – his wife, who had picked him up from his alcoholism. We met him at a hotel. I tried to engage him in conversation, but it was no good. He was absent. He didn&#x27;t even offer us a drink. Not because he was being unfriendly, but because it never occurred to him.”

Schneider&#x27;s recollection of that awkward first meeting confirms all of this and more: “They simply had nothing to say to each other, no worlds of any kind to share. And all of Sam&#x27;s good will and my own failing efforts to get something started failed to bring them together on any level. It was a disaster.”

But not entirely. Although the role called for Beckett&#x27;s seemingly ubiquitous bowler hat, Keaton had brought along some of his trademark flattened-down Stetsons and it was quickly agreed that he should wear one of those. On the Monday morning they “traipsed down in Joe Coffey&#x27;s ancient Morgan to just beneath the shadow of Brooklyn Bridge and began the shooting.” Beckett continues:

: “The heat was terrible - while I was staggering in the humidity, Keaton was galloping up and down and doing whatever we asked of him. He had great endurance, he was very tough and, yes, reliable. And when you saw that face at the end - oh!’ He smiled, ‘At last’”

Both Beckett and Schneider were novices; Keaton a seasoned veteran. That said, “Keaton&#x27;s behaviour on the set was … steady and cooperative … He was indefatigable if not exactly loquacious. To all intents and purposes, we were shooting a silent film, and he was in his best form. He encouraged [Schneider] to give him vocal directions during the shot, sometimes starting over again without stopping the camera if he felt he hadn&#x27;t done something well the first time. (Nor did he believe much in rehearsal, preferring the spontaneity of performance.) Often when [the crew was] stumped over a technical problem with the camera, he came through with suggestions, inevitably prefacing his comments by explaining that he had solved such problems many times at the Keaton Studios back in 1927.”

Both Beckett and Schneider pronounced themselves more than pleased with Keaton&#x27;s performance; the latter called him &quot;magnificent.&quot;

Keaton&#x27;s negative comments about the film are often reported but this final recollection by Schneider may redress the balance: “[W]hatever he may have subsequently said to interviewers or reporters about not understanding a moment of what he was doing or what the film was about, what I remember best of our final farewell on the set was that he smiled and half-admitted those six pages were worth doing after all.”

In February 1965, when on a trip to West Berlin, “in deference to his recent work with Buster Keaton, he went to see Keaton again in his 1927 film &quot;The General&quot;, finding it, however, disappointing.”

Canadian playwright Sherry MacDonald wrote a play, &quot;The Stone Face&quot;, based on the encounter between Beckett, Keaton and Schneider.

<doc id="151814" wikidata="Q564889" url="?curid=151814" title="Queen Anne-Marie of Greece">
<text>Anne-Marie (; born Princess Anne-Marie Dagmar Ingrid of Denmark, 30 August 1946) is a Danish princess who was Queen of Greece as the consort of King Constantine II from their marriage on 18 September 1964 until the abolition of the Greek monarchy on 1 June 1973.

Anne-Marie is the youngest daughter of Frederik IX of Denmark and Ingrid of Sweden. In 1964, she married Constantine and became queen consort of Greece. They had five children: Princess Alexia, Crown Prince Pavlos, Prince Nikolaos, Princess Theodora, and Prince Philippos. As queen, Anne-Marie spent much of her time working for a charitable foundation known as &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s Fund&quot;, a foundation established by her mother-in-law, Queen Frederica of Greece. In 1967, Anne-Marie and her family were forced into exile upon the rise of a military dictatorship. After fleeing to Rome, they eventually settled in London, when the Greek monarchy was officially abolished.

Anne-Marie and her family were stripped of their Greek citizenship and had their property revoked, leading them to sue in the European Court of Human Rights. Of the compensation she earned, Anne-Marie set up the &quot;Anne-Marie Foundation&quot;, which provided assistance to people in rural areas of Greece. In 2013, she and Constantine moved back to Greece. They moved to Athens in 2022, where Constantine died in January the following year.

==Birth and family==
Princess Anne-Marie was born on 30 August 1946 in Frederik VIII&#x27;s Palace, an 18th-century palace which forms part of the Amalienborg Palace complex in central Copenhagen. She was the third and last daughter and child of Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Ingrid of Denmark. Her father was the eldest son of Christian X of Denmark and Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin; her mother, born a princess of Sweden, was the only daughter of the Crown Prince of Sweden (later King Gustaf VI Adolf) and Princess Margaret of Connaught. At birth, Anne-Marie had two elder sisters: Princess Margrethe (later queen of Denmark) and Princess Benedikte (who became princess of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg).

Anne-Marie was baptised on 9 October 1946 in the Holmen Church in Copenhagen. Her godparents were her paternal grandparents, King Christian X and Queen Alexandrine of Denmark; her maternal grandfather, Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden; her maternal uncle Prince Bertil, Duke of Halland; her paternal great-uncle King Haakon VII of Norway; her paternal great-aunt Princess Dagmar of Denmark; her grandfather&#x27;s cousin Prince George of Greece and Denmark; her father&#x27;s cousin, Crown Princess Märtha of Norway; Queen Mary of the United Kingdom; and Crown Princess Juliana of the Netherlands.

Anne-Marie is a great-great-granddaughter of both Queen Victoria and Christian IX of Denmark. Therefore, she is related to many other members of European royalty, such as her future husband Constantine II, who is also a great-great-grandchild of both Queen Victoria and Christian IX of Denmark. Moreover, Anne-Marie is the aunt by marriage of Felipe VI of Spain and the first cousin of Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden.

==Early life==
Princess Anne-Marie and her sisters grew up in apartments at Frederik VIII&#x27;s Palace at Amalienborg in Copenhagen and in Fredensborg Palace in North Zealand. She spent summer holidays with the royal family in her parents&#x27; summer residence at Gråsten Palace in Southern Jutland. On 20 April 1947, less than a year after Princess Anne-Marie&#x27;s birth, her grandfather, Christian X, died, and her father ascended the throne as King Frederik IX.

At the time of her father&#x27;s accession to the throne, only males could ascend the throne of Denmark. As Anne-Marie&#x27;s parents had no sons, it was assumed that her paternal uncle, Prince Knud, would one day assume the throne. The popularity of Frederik IX and his daughters and the more prominent role of women in Danish life paved the way for a new Act of Succession in 1953 which permitted female succession to the throne following the principle of male-preference primogeniture, where a female can ascend to the throne if she has no brothers. Her eldest sister, Margrethe, therefore became heir presumptive, and Princess Benedikte and Princess Anne-Marie became second and third in the line of succession.

Anne-Marie was educated at N. Zahle&#x27;s School, a private school in Copenhagen, from 1952 to 1961. In 1961, she attended the Chatelard School for Girls, an English boarding school outside Montreux in Switzerland. In 1963 and 1964, she attended the Institut Le Mesnil, a Swiss finishing school also in Montreux. Upon returning from schooling, Anne-Marie undertook childcare work for a few years. This was in approval of her mother, who wished for her to become a good housewife to her future husband.

==Marriage==
In 1959, at the age of 13, Anne-Marie first met her future husband, her third cousin Constantine, Crown Prince of Greece, who accompanied his parents, King Paul and Queen Frederica, on a state visit to Denmark. Constantine at the time was 19 years old. They met a second time in Denmark in 1961, when Constantine declared to his parents his intention to marry Anne-Marie. The pair became secretly engaged without telling the public nor members of their families due to Frederik IX&#x27;s opposition to their relationship because of her young age. They met again in Athens in May 1962 at the wedding of Constantine&#x27;s older sister, Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark, and Prince Juan Carlos of Spain. Anne-Marie was a bridesmaid, while Constantine was a groomsman for the future monarchs of Spain. The couple spent time in Athens afterward and told their families about their engagement. They met again in 1963 at the centenary celebrations of the Greek monarchy. Though it had already been revealed to their family, their engagement was announced to the public during these celebrations. Following this, Anne-Marie began studying the history of Greece and the history of the Greek monarchy, as well as taking Modern Greek lessons in order to learn the language of the country her husband was to reign over.

Constantine&#x27;s mother, Frederica, initially requested that one million dollars be spent on the wedding, however, the private office of the Danish royal family denied this. The Danish and Greek royal families eventually agreed on two million dollars being invested in the wedding. Prior to it being spent, this money was stored in the Swiss banking system. In July 1964, the announcement of the engagement of Constantine and Anne-Marie raised the polite protests of the Left in Denmark. Previously, on 6 March 1964, King Paul died, and Constantine succeeded him as King of the Hellenes. There was speculation that as a result of Paul&#x27;s death, the wedding would be postponed and delayed. However, Frederica requested that their marriage took place on its original date. Anne-Marie and Constantine were married on 18 September 1964 (two weeks after Anne-Marie&#x27;s 18th birthday) in the Metropolis, the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Athens. Anne-Marie converted from Lutheranism to the Greek Orthodox Church 7 months and 3 days after her marriage. On April 21, 1965. There was a special permission, for this, from the Archbishop of Athens and all Greece, who is the head of the Orthodox Church of Greece. In order for her to be able to celebrate the Easter, which was 4 days later.

Also, as she was marrying a foreign ruler, consent to the marriage was given on the condition that Anne-Marie renounce her succession rights to the Danish throne for herself and her descendants.

==Queen of the Hellenes==

As Queen of Greece, Anne-Marie&#x27;s initial primary role was to provide the nation with an heir who would eventually take over as King. Anne-Marie spent much of her time working for a charitable foundation known as &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s Fund&quot; and later as the &quot;Anne-Marie Foundation&quot;, which provided assistance to people in rural areas of Greece. Her Majesty&#x27;s Fund was an organisation set up by Frederica during her husband&#x27;s reign which aimed at assisting the poor and disadvantaged. Anne-Marie also worked closely with the Red Cross and other not-for-profit charities.

On 10 July 1965, Queen Anne-Marie gave birth at the villa Mon Repos in Corfu to her first child, Princess Alexia, who was heir presumptive to the throne of Greece, from her birth until the birth of her younger brother Crown Prince Pavlos on 20 May 1967 in accordance with Greece&#x27;s order of succession adhering to male-preference primogeniture. At the time of Alexia and Pavlos&#x27; births, political stability within Greece was diminishing due to a schism between Constantine and the Prime Minister Georgios Papandreou, who wished to demote the minister of defence, Petros Garoufalias, in order to assume office himself. A falling out resulting in Papandreou&#x27;s resignation then ensued.

A group of Greek soldiers in April 1967 overthrew the government of the new Prime Minister, Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, which marked the beginning of a military dictatorship in Greece. The royal family was left unaware and in order to avoid fighting, Constantine and Anne-Marie agreed to recognise the dictatorship against their will, however many members of the public therefore believed that they supported and even funded the coup. The following month, Anne-Marie gave birth to a son, Pavlos, who immediately assumed the position of Crown Prince of Greece from his sister. At his baptism, Anne-Marie and Constantine decided to make Frederica his godmother and the Hellenic Army his godfather figure. Many people viewed this decision as the royal family&#x27;s recognition of the military dictatorship. As a result of the military coup, relations between Athens and Copenhagen had been deteriorating and in an attempt to salvage &quot;national security&quot;, no member of the Danish royal family was permitted to attend the baptism. Margrethe II of Denmark, the future queen of Denmark, was married to Henri de Laborde de Monpezat at their wedding on 10 June 1967. Anne-Marie, the sister of Margrethe, and Constantine were subsequently denied an invite to their wedding, further ruining relations for a period of time.

==Exile==

In December 1967, Constantine attempted to shake off the military&#x27;s authoritarian regime by trying to stage a counter-coup with the help of his political allies. The counter-coup failed. Upon the coup&#x27;s abandonment, the military junta in Greece strongly advised Anne-Marie and Constantine to leave the country. Without leaving them any real options when saying this, they were essentially forcing them to be exiled from the country. Anne-Marie and Constantine fled to nearby Italy and sought refuge at the Greek Embassy in Rome, where Anne-Marie and Constantine became puppet monarchs. After two months of refuge at the Greek Embassy, Anne-Marie and Constantine received greeting from Moritz, Landgrave of Hesse, who organised to put them up at the Villa Polissena, an Italian palace where Moritz himself had previously lived upon his family&#x27;s exile. Anne-Marie eventually agreed with Constantine to move to 13 Via di Porta Latina, where a large villa owned by Countess Cristina Paolozzi was located. The couple rented out the space at 8,000 francs per month for the next five years.

Possibly due to stress and worry, Anne-Marie suffered a miscarriage in early 1968. Anne-Marie fell pregnant again in February of the next year and gave birth to Prince Nikolaos of Greece and Denmark. Anne-Marie and Constantine established a small school in their villa to preserve the Greek culture among their children. Despite the expansion of their family, Anne-Marie and Constantine had been experiencing some marital struggles in the early 1970s. It was reported that Anne-Marie in 1974 was considering filing a divorce and moving back to Denmark, however, their relationship was repaired and even &quot;strengthened&quot; as a result.

Throughout this time, although they were living in exile, Anne-Marie and Constantine still formally remained the monarchs of Greece. They were paid monthly by the military junta, but lacked invitations to Greek governmental events. They were still allowed to represent Greece and the Greek crown at international royal events. For example, the pair attended the 21st birthday of Charles, Prince of Wales, in 1969, the 2500th anniversary of the founding of the Persian Empire in 1971, and the baptism in Madrid of François, the eldest son of Alfonso, Duke of Anjou and Cádiz. One of the last events Anne-Marie and Constantine attended as the monarchs of Greece was the funeral of Frederik IX, Anne-Marie&#x27;s father, whom she grieved deeply.

==Dethronement==

The military junta in Greece began noticeably distancing itself from the monarchy when Georgios Zoitakis replaced Georgios Papadopoulos as the Regent of Greece. In 1972, Constantine&#x27;s face was replaced on coins by a phoenix, a symbol of the Greek military and the national bird of Greece. There began a period of growing uprise against the military dictatorship, which resulted in the abolition of the monarchy in 1973. Anne-Marie and Constantine were officially dethroned by the 1974 Greek republic referendum on 29 July 1974. The royal family were stripped of their monthly payments from the government, forcing them to leave their home in Rome. Margrethe II immediately agreed to house Anne-Marie, Constantine and their family in Amalienborg for a year. Anne-Marie moved with her family to England. They lived first in Chobham in Surrey. Later, they moved to the London suburb of Hampstead.

The military dictatorship in Greece collapsed in 1974 after a failed coup d&#x27;état, which aimed to unite Greece and Cyprus. The failed coup directly resulted in the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus, which brought great opposition to the Greek junta. It was hoped that their positions as King and Queen of the Hellenes would be restored as democracy was reinstated, but another referendum confirmed that the monarchy would stay abolished and the Third Hellenic Republic was finally formed. The new Greek government continued to enforce the exile of Anne-Marie and her family as they saw them as a threat to the new republic. The family were disallowed to enter the country from then on. They were denied entry into the country even for Frederica&#x27;s funeral. Frederica had died in exile in February 1981 in Madrid, where she had been staying with her daughter, Sofía. The Spanish royal family and Spanish government intervened and gained authorisation for the Greek royals to return for only one day, the day of the funeral. 

In London, Anne-Marie established with Constantine the Hellenic College of London to again help their children learn the Greek language and culture. The family continued to earn support from the Spanish royal family, Danish royal family, British royal family, Swedish royal family and Norwegian royal family. Anne-Marie and Constantine received financial aid from Hussein of Jordan and Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran. Following a miscarriage in 1980, Anne-Marie and Constantine agreed to expand their family. After the christening of Prince Peter of Yugoslavia, whom Anne-Marie and Constantine baptised, the couple gave birth to Princess Theodora in June 1983 and later Prince Philippos in April 1986. In 1989, the silver anniversary of Anne-Marie&#x27;s marriage to Constantine was celebrated at Kronborg Castle in Denmark.

==Return to Greece==
The government of Greece in 1991 granted Anne-Marie and Constantine permission to retrieve over 68 tonnes of their belongings to either keep or sell. These objects had previously been abandoned in Tatoi Palace and Mon Repos Palace when the monarchs were exiled 23 years earlier. Two years later, the couple were allowed to enter Greece again in a private visit on their yacht with their children. They had agreed with the government to avoid touristic and populated areas. When the family stopped for oil at a port in southern Greece, Anne-Marie and Constantine were swarmed with crowds of people and press, who greeted them with cheers and claps. As a result, the Greek government sent naval destroyers and a Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft. This was called evidence that the pair still held &quot;real influence in Greece&quot;. The family were subsequently escorted by members of the military, before being obliged to sail out of Greek maritime borders.
Possibly as a result of their 1993 visit, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou confiscated all property of the exiled royal family, including Tatoi, Mon Repos and Psychico, a farm located on Mount Hymettus. All tangible items that the family had not evacuated in 1991 were also taken from them by the government. Finally, the government stripped the Greek royal family of their Greek citizenship and passport, unless they renounced their dynastic rights, abandoned the name &quot;of Greece&quot; and swore an oath to the republic. Anne-Marie and Constantine called it &quot;the greatest insult in this world for a Greek to be told that he is not a Greek&quot;. In addition, they were accused by the Greek government of tampering with the 1974 republic referendum results by officiating the marriage of Pavlos and Marie-Chantal Miller in London as a real princely marriage.

Anne-Marie and Constantine, along with Princess Irene and Princess Katherine, made the decision to take the Greek government to court in April 1996 over the confiscation of their citizenships and properties. The Supreme Civil and Criminal Court of Greece agreed with their discrimination claim, however, the Council of State overrode their decision and stated that the removal of their passports was a measure taken that conforms with the constitution of the Third Republic. As a result, the family took Greece to court in the European Court of Human Rights and sued them for €200 million. Months later the initiation of the claim, the court ruled in the royal family&#x27;s favour in November 2000. The ruling, however, did not require the government to return the family&#x27;s properties and instead allowed them to be compensated through money. Of the €200 million claim, Anne-Marie and Constantine won €12 million, Irene won €900,000 and Katherine €300,000. The family did not receive their citizenship back either. Although originally requesting Spanish citizenships, Anne-Marie eventually requested from her sister, Margrethe II, to have Danish diplomatic passports established in the names of the members of the Greek royal family. She agreed and in their Danish passports, their names were established as &quot;HM Queen Anne-Marie&quot; and &quot;HM King Constantine II&quot;.

Possibly in an attempt to villainise the former monarchs, their payments were taken out of the natural disaster relief fund. In 2003, Constantine used the money they received to establish the Anna-Maria Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation aimed to provide aid to victims of natural disasters, particularly those of floods, earthquakes and bushfires. Since 2019, Anne-Marie has headed the foundation as its president.

==Later life==
Following the resolution of the disputes, relations between the Greek royal family and the Greek government began to relax. On 21 May 2004, Anne-Marie was peripherally involved in a dispute in Madrid between former Crown Prince Vittorio Emanuele of Italy and his cousin and dynastic rival, Prince Amedeo of Savoy-Aosta. At a &quot;soirée&quot; held at the Zarzuela Palace during the wedding celebrations of Felipe, Prince of Asturias, Amedeo approached Vittorio, who reportedly punched him twice in the face, causing him to stumble backward down the steps. Upon learning of the incident Spain&#x27;s King Juan Carlos, a cousin of both men, reportedly declared that &quot;never again&quot; would an opportunity to abuse his hospitality be afforded the competing pretenders.
On 14 August 2004, Anne-Marie and her husband Constantine visited their former home in Athens, the former Royal Palace that is currently the Presidential Palace, for the first time since 1967. They were received by then-President of Greece Costis Stephanopoulos along with other members of the International Olympic Committee, of which Constantine was an honorary member of. In December 2004, Constantine, Anne-Marie and their children were again invited to pay a personal private visit by President Stephanopoulos. Once the games concluded, the government announced that Anne-Marie and Constantine&#x27;s exile would finally be revoked.

In 2013, Anne-Marie and Constantine returned to reside in Greece. They sold their home in London for €11.5 million and announced their return to Greece. He and his wife, Anne-Marie, purchased a villa in Porto Cheli, Peloponnese residing there until they relocated to Athens in the spring of 2022. For her 60th birthday, Anne-Marie boarded the cruise ship the &quot;Aphroessa&quot;, which Constantine had organised for her.

Constantine began experiencing health and mobility issues, leading to him requiring more care from Anne-Marie. He was hospitalised following his COVID-19 diagnosis. On 10 January 2023, Anne-Marie became widowed when her husband died of a stroke at the private Hygeia Hospital in Athens at the age of 82.

On 19 December 2024, Anne-Marie&#x27;s children and five of her grandchildren applied for Greek citizenship, selecting the surname &quot;Ντε Γκρες&quot; (De Grèce; &quot;of Greece&quot;). Anne-Marie did not apply, with it being reported that she was &quot;not interested&quot;.

===Arms and monogram===
The coats of arms of Queen Anne-Marie combine the 1936–1973 royal coat of arms of Greece and the 1948–1972 coat of arms of Denmark which was current at the time of her marriage in 1964. The Danish coat of arms is almost identical with the dynastic arms inescutcheon in the Greek coat of arms, which equals the Danish coat of arms of 1819–1903. The only difference is that the Greek arms also include Iceland&#x27;s white stockfish on red in the lower dexter corner.

<text>Ingrid of Sweden (Ingrid Victoria Sofia Louisa Margareta; 28 March 1910 – 7 November 2000) was Queen of Denmark from 20 April 1947 to 14 January 1972 as the wife of King Frederik IX.

Ingrid was born into the House of Bernadotte as the only daughter of Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden (later King Gustaf VI Adolf) and his first wife, Princess Margaret of Connaught. In 1935, she married Frederik, then Crown Prince of Denmark. The couple had three daughters: Margrethe, Benedikte, and Anne-Marie.

In 1947, Frederik became king upon the death of his father, King Christian X, and Ingrid became queen consort. As queen, Ingrid reformed the traditions of Danish court life, abolished many old-fashioned customs at court and created a more relaxed atmosphere at official receptions. In 1972, Frederik died and was succeeded by his and Ingrid&#x27;s eldest daughter, Margrethe II. Ingrid died in 2000.

==Early life==

Ingrid was born on 28 March 1910, at the Royal Palace in Stockholm as the third child and the only daughter of Gustaf Adolf, Crown Prince of Sweden and his first wife, Princess Margaret of Connaught. Her mother was a daughter of Queen Victoria&#x27;s third son Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn by his wife Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia.

She was baptised Ingrid Victoria Sofia Louisa Margareta in Slottskyrkan (the Royal Chapel) in Stockholm, Sweden on 5 May 1910. Her godparents were: the King and Queen of Sweden (her paternal grandparents); the Dowager Queen of Sweden (her paternal great-grandmother); the Duke and Duchess of Connaught and Strathearn (her maternal grandparents); the Dowager Grand Duchess of Baden (her paternal great-grandmother); the Empress of Russia (her mother&#x27;s paternal first cousin); Princess Alexander of Teck (her mother&#x27;s paternal first cousin); the Prince of Wales (her mother&#x27;s paternal first cousin); Prince Adalbert of Prussia (her maternal second cousin); the Grand Duchess of Baden (her grandaunt); and the Dowager Duchess of Dalarna (her great-grandaunt).

Ingrid and her family lived in apartments in the Royal Palace in Stockholm, in a mansion at Ulriksdal, near the capital, and in a summer residence, Sofiero Palace in Helsingborg, Scania in southern Sweden. Crown Princess Margaret founded a school for Ingrid with a small circle of Swedish noble girls. Ingrid was also given some domestic instruction as part of her education. As a child, she practiced cooking in her model cottage on the palace grounds and even washed the dishes after meals. In 1920, when Ingrid was just ten years old, her mother died from sepsis while in the eighth month of her sixth pregnancy. After her mother&#x27;s death, Ingrid spent several months of each year in the United Kingdom in the care of her grandfather. Observers suggested that Ingrid&#x27;s strong self-discipline was shaped as an effect of her mother&#x27;s death. Her father remarried Lady Louise Mountbatten three years later. Louise was a second cousin of Ingrid&#x27;s. Only a stillborn daughter resulted from her father&#x27;s second marriage. Ingrid felt betrayed by her father when he remarried, and she was unkind to Crown Princess Louise. Ingrid and her father would not reconcile until many years later.

Ingrid was taught history, art history, political science, and learned several languages. Her knowledge of art and culture was extended by long stays in Paris and Rome. Along with her father, stepmother and brother Prince Bertil, Ingrid took a five-month journey through the Middle East between 1934 and 1935. She was interested in sports, especially horse-riding, skiing and tennis. Ingrid made her debut at the opening of the Swedish Riksdag in 1928 when she was noted to be &quot;smartly dressed&quot;. She was also noted to be an accomplished linguist, horsewoman, skier, skater and dancer. She often played tennis against her grandfather King Gustav V. During her young adulthood, Ingrid was often seen driving her two-seat car around Stockholm. Besides gaining a reputation as a stylish young woman, she was known as being quite attractive. After her visit to the United States in 1939, Americans described her as &quot;tall and very slender&quot; with a &quot;nicely modeled mouth and exquisite teeth&quot;.

== Marriage ==
The question of Ingrid&#x27;s marriage was a hot topic of conversation in the 1920s. She was matched with various foreign royalties and was seen by some as a possible wife for the heir apparent to the British throne, the Prince of Wales, who was her second cousin. Her mother, Margaret of Connaught, and the then-Prince of Wales&#x27; father, King George V, were first cousins, both being grandchildren of Queen Victoria. In 1928, Ingrid met the Prince of Wales in London. However, no engagement took place. She was also considered as a match for Prince George of the United Kingdom, the fourth son of King George V. 

On 15 March 1935, shortly before her 25th birthday, her engagement to Frederik, the Crown Prince of Denmark and Iceland, who was 11 years her senior, was announced. They had gotten engaged in private in the beginning of February. They were related in several ways. As descendants of Oscar I of Sweden, they were third cousins. Through Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden, they were third cousins. And finally through Paul I of Russia, Frederik was a fourth cousin of Ingrid&#x27;s mother.

The couple was married in Stockholm Cathedral on 24 May 1935 by the Archbishop of Uppsala, Erling Eidem. Ingrid wore the veil of Irish lace her late mother, Princess Margaret of Connaught, had worn at her wedding 30 years earlier. The veil has since been worn by all of Ingrid&#x27;s female descendants as well as her granddaughter-in-law Mary Donaldson. She wore a crown of myrtle from a shrub her mother had brought with her from Osborne House in England to Sofiero Palace in Sweden. Carrying a sprig of myrtle in the wedding bouquet is a tradition that maintains to this day in the Swedish royal family and, with Ingrid, has continued into the Danish royal family when she brought cuttings from the shrub at Sofiero to be planted at Fredensborg Palace. Ingrid&#x27;s second cousins Princess Ragnhild and Princess Astrid of Norway served as bridesmaids while Count Gustaf Bernadotte of Wisborg, son of Folke Bernadotte, was a page boy.

Among the guests at the wedding were Frederik&#x27;s parents, King Christian X and Queen Alexandrine of Denmark; Ingrid&#x27;s father and stepmother, Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf and Crown Princess Louise of Sweden; and Ingrid&#x27;s grandparents, King Gustaf V of Sweden and the Duke of Connaught and Stathearn; as well as The King and Queen of the Belgians and The Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Norway.

The Swedish royal barge Vasaorden transported the couple to Dannebrog, the Danish royal yacht, on 24 May. Two days later, they arrived in Copenhagen aboard the yacht before leaving for a honeymoon to Rome. Her wedding was one of the greatest media events of the day in Sweden in 1935, and received so much attention that the media were criticised for it. Ingrid also appeared on the radio in 1935 and read a poem, something that was also given much attention. 

==Crown Princess==
While she was Crown Princess, she was the official patron of the Girl Guides (1936), after having taken, and passed, the same tests all applicants were given. In 1940, before the occupation, she was the leader of the &quot;Danske Kvinders Beredskab&quot; (The Danish Women&#x27;s war-effort society). During the German occupation of Denmark in World War II, Ingrid, with her personal courage and integrity, influenced the Danish Royal House and its conduct in relation to the occupation forces, and won great popularity as a symbol of silent resistance and public patriotic moral. She showed solidarity toward the Danish population, and could often be seen on her bicycle or with her baby carriage on the streets of Copenhagen during the war. Her open defiance of the occupation forces made her grandfather, King Gustav of Sweden, worry about the risks, and in 1941, he sent a demand to her to be more discreet &quot;for the sake of the dynasty&quot; and its safety, but she reacted with anger and refused to obey, and she had the support of her spouse, who shared her views. One display of defiance shown by Ingrid was her positioning of the flags of Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom in the window of the nursery at Amalienborg, the royal residence in the centre of Copenhagen.

==Queen consort==
Upon her husband&#x27;s accession to the throne on 20 April 1947, she became the Queen of Denmark. As such, she reformed the traditions of Danish court life, abolished many old-fashioned customs at court and created a more relaxed atmosphere at official receptions. She was interested in gardening and art, and renovated the Gråsten Slot according to her own historical research about the palace&#x27;s original appearance.

==Widowed queen==
In 1972, King Frederik IX died, and Ingrid was widowed at the age of 61. Her elder daughter, aged 31, became the new queen, and Ingrid now assumed a position as family matriarch. That same year, after having sworn to respect the Danish constitution, she was appointed &quot;Rigsforstander&quot; (formal regent) and representative of the monarch whenever her daughter (and later her grandsons) were absent, a task she performed on many occasions. This was exceptional; previously, only the Crown Prince had been allowed to act as regent in the absence of the monarch.

She was patron of a long line of social organizations, positions which, one after another, she eventually left to Princess Benedikte as years passed: &quot;Røde Kors&quot;, &quot;Ældre Sagen&quot;, &quot;Red Barnet&quot;, &quot;Løgum Klosters Refugium&quot;, and &quot;Fonden for Træer og Miljø&quot;. She also founded the organizations &quot;Kong Frederik og Dronning Ingrids fond til humanitære og kulturelle formål, Ingridfondet&quot; for South Jutland, &quot;Det kgl. Grønlandsfond&quot;, and &quot;Dronning Ingrids Romerske Fond til støtte af kulturelle og videnskabelige formål&quot;. She was described as dutiful, well-prepared and energetic.

==Death==

Queen Ingrid died on 7 November 2000 at Fredensborg Palace, Fredensborg, with her three daughters—Queen Margrethe II, Princess Benedikte and Queen Anne-Marie of Greece—and ten grandchildren at her bedside. Thousands gathered outside Amalienborg Palace, her official residence, after her death was announced; flowers were left, candles were lit and hymns were sung in her honour. Her funeral took place on 14 November 2000, and Ingrid was interred next to her husband, King Frederik IX, outside Roskilde Cathedral near Copenhagen. The funeral was attended by many crowned heads of Europe and other heads of state, among them King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden, Queen Sofia of Spain, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, King Harald V and Queen Sonja of Norway, King Albert II and Queen Paola of Belgium, Grand Duke Jean and Grand Duchess Joséphine Charlotte of Luxembourg, Charles, Prince of Wales, Prince Albert II of Monaco, President of Iceland Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson and former President of Finland Mauno Koivisto.

<doc id="151820" wikidata="Q2276626" url="?curid=151820" title="Reagan Democrat">
<text>A Reagan Democrat is a traditionally Democratic voter in the United States, referring to working class residents who supported Republican presidential candidates Ronald Reagan in the 1980 and/or the 1984 United States presidential elections, and/or George H. W. Bush in the 1988 United States presidential election. The term remains part of the lexicon in American political jargon because of Reagan&#x27;s continued widespread popularity among a large segment of the electorate.

==Overview==
During the 1980 election a dramatic number of voters in the United States, disillusioned with the economic malaise of the 1970s and the presidency of Jimmy Carter (even more than four years earlier under moderate Republican Gerald Ford), supported Reagan, a former Democrat and California governor. Reagan&#x27;s optimistic tone managed to win over a broad set of voters to an almost unprecedented degree (for a Republican since moderate war hero Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s victories in 1952 and 1956) across the board but did not make particular demographic inroads with Democratic voters, with the possible exception of national security voters (a focused yet relatively small group, difficult to find decisive empirical support for and identified in 1980 with Democrat Henry &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson, a Reagan ally for a brief period after 1980 until his death in 1983).

The term Reagan Democrat is sometimes used to describe moderate Democrats who are more conservative than liberal on certain issues like national security and immigration. The term Reagan Democrat also refers to the vast sway that Reagan held over the House of Representatives during his presidency, even though the house had a Democratic majority during both of his terms. The term also hearkens back to Richard Nixon&#x27;s silent majority, a concept that Reagan himself used during his political campaigns in the 1970s.
Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg issued a study of Reagan Democrats, analyzing white ethnic voters (largely unionized auto workers) in Macomb County, Michigan, just north of Detroit. The county voted 63 percent for John F. Kennedy in 1960 but 66 percent for Reagan in 1984. He concluded that Reagan Democrats no longer saw the Democratic Party as champions of their working-class aspirations but instead saw them as working primarily for the benefit of others: the very poor, feminists, the unemployed, African Americans, Latinos, and other groups. In addition, Reagan Democrats enjoyed gains during the period of economic prosperity that coincided with the Reagan administration following the malaise of the Carter administration. They also supported Reagan&#x27;s strong stance on national security and opposed the 1980s Democratic Party on such issues as pornography, crime, and high taxes.

Greenberg periodically revisited the voters of Macomb County as a barometer of public opinion until he conducted a 2008 exit poll that found &quot;nearly 60 percent&quot; of Macomb County voters were comfortable&#x27; with Mr. Obama&quot;, drawing the conclusion that Macomb County had &quot;become normal and uninteresting&quot; and &quot;illustrates America&#x27;s evolving relationship with race&quot;. As such, Greenberg stated in an op-ed for &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m finished with the Reagan Democrats of Macomb County in suburban Detroit after making a career of spotlighting their middle-class anger and frustrations about race and Democratic politicians.&quot; Obama ultimately won Macomb County by a comfortable 53–45% margin that year, the same margin he won nationally. In 2016, Macomb County voted for Donald Trump, and did so again in 2020 and 2024.

Reagan biographer Craig Shirley wrote extensively about Reagan Democrats. His 1980 election account &quot;Rendezvous with Destiny&quot; clearly distinguishes the appearance of blue-collar crossovers for Reagan during the 1980 Wisconsin primaries at a Reagan event in Milwaukee&#x27;s &quot;ethnic Mecca&quot; Serb Hall. He writes: &quot;A young Democrat, Robert Ponasik, stood on a chair furiously waving a handmade sign that proclaimed, &#x27;Cross Over for Reagan&#x27;. Of the reaction to Reagan in Serb Hall, Lynn Sherr of ABC reported, &#x27;In judging from the way they showed up at a long-time Democratic meeting hall ... a large number of blue-collar voters could go for Reagan.

==Reagan Democrats in the 1990s and into the 21st century==
The demographic shift that Reagan tapped into continued into the 1990s after he left office. The Democrats responded with new themes. This is evidenced by the rise of Bill Clinton to the presidency during the 1992 presidential election. In that campaign, candidate Clinton billed himself as &quot;a different kind of Democrat&quot;, and forswore many older Democratic Party policies in favor of centrist Third Way policies that were championed by the Democratic Leadership Council in hopes of reconnecting with many working-class voters who had voted Republican in presidential campaigns since 1968—the silent majority of Nixon and the Reagan Democrats.

Many self-styled Reagan Democrats claim to be fiscal conservatives but still support many aspects of the core programs of the New Deal and the Great Society while also supporting Reagan&#x27;s strong defense policies and his optimism in American culture. They still voted for Democratic politicians in the legislative and state elections until mid-1990s. Some elements of the Tea Party movement fit this sketch but many other independents and Democrats could fall into the same category as well. One of the most prominent self-styled Reagan Democrats includes the one-time Virginia Senator Jim Webb (who was in office from 2007 to 2013), whom columnist David Paul Kuhn asserts is the quintessential Reagan Democrat and one of the last of an &quot;endangered species&quot; within the Democratic Party.

In 2012, conservative commentator George Will, observing the long-term movements of partisanship, said: &quot;White voters without college education—economically anxious and culturally conservative—were called &#x27;Reagan Democrats&#x27; when they were considered only seasonal Republicans because of Ronald Reagan. Today they are called the Republican base.&quot;

==Donald Trump and Joe Biden==

The term still carries relevance, since part of this group defected to Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election, who won every swing state in the Rust Belt and became the first Republican candidate to win Pennsylvania and Michigan since 1988 and the first to win Wisconsin since 1984. All of these states voted for Reagan in 1980 and 1984 but voted for Democratic U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996 and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.

Following the 2016 election, which saw many Rust Belt counties turn to Trump, a Republican strategist said that the working-class Reagan Democrats who favored Trump in 2016 should now be called &quot;Trump Republicans&quot;. Conversely, it has been suggested that Reagan Democrats did not necessarily swing the Rust Belt states in 2016 but rather that Democratic voters in those regions stayed home on election day. Trump became the first Republican presidential candidate to win all three Rust Belt states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin since Reagan in 1984.

In a 2021 profile with &quot;Politico&quot;, Stan Greenberg used the term &quot;Biden Republican&quot; to identify a large bloc of suburban white collar voters who chose Joe Biden over Trump in the 2020 United States presidential election. Greenberg highlighted that these voters have been reliably Republican for decades but were inclined to vote for the Democratic nominee because of the nativism of Trumpism. Following the 2024 United States presidential election, Trump flipped all three Rust Belt states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin again. With Trump&#x27;s Electoral College victories in 2016 and 2024, he became the first Republican presidential candidate to win all three Rust Belt states twice since Reagan in 1980 and 1984.

==Similar concepts internationally==

* In the United Kingdom, the term &quot;Essex man&quot; can be used to describe a similar group of traditionally Labour-voting working-class voters who switched to voting for the Conservative Party led by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s thanks to her Right to Buy policy in particular. While no name in particular has been given to this group, the 2017 UK general election saw some Brexit-supporting middle or northern working-class areas swing disproportionally to the Conservative Party. For example, this was manifested in the Conservative candidates gaining part-urban Labour seats in Stoke-on-Trent, Middlesbrough, and Walsall in spite of the general Labour gain nationwide and in pro-European Union areas and the general losses for the Conservatives. On the other hand, Essex was dominated by the Conservatives in that election, with the party winning all 18 seats. After a larger number of northern working class areas swung to the Conservatives in the 2019 election, polling companies dubbed this group of people Workington man. The trend intensified in the 2019 UK general election, where the red wall largely voted for the Conservatives in greater numbers. This resulted in some constituencies that had been Labour for a century electing a Conservative MP, while others turned Conservative for the first time. 
* In Australia, the term &quot;Howard battler&quot; was used to refer to suburban working-class and traditionally Labor voters who switched to the Liberal Party led by John Howard in the mid-1990s and carried the Liberals to victory for the first time since Malcolm Fraser in 1980.
* In New Zealand, political columnist Chris Trotter has theorised about the emergence of &quot;Waitakere Man&quot;, a traditionally blue-collar constituency who he believes switched their votes to National Party leader John Key in 2008 on the premises of &quot;ambition&quot; and &quot;aspiration&quot;, and supposedly also represent a backlash against &quot;political correctness gone mad&quot;.

<text>Cyberpunk is a tabletop role-playing game in the dystopian science fiction genre, written by Mike Pondsmith and first published by R. Talsorian Games in 1988. It is typically referred to by its second or fourth edition names, Cyberpunk 2020 and Cyberpunk Red, in order to distinguish it from the cyberpunk genre after which it is named.
==Setting==

&quot;Cyberpunk&quot; exists within its own fictional timeline, which splits from the real world in the 1980s. The timeline has been extended with each major edition of the game, from the first edition set in 2013 to &quot;Cyberpunk Red&quot; set in 2045.

The backstory for &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; begins with the United States becoming embroiled in a major conflict in Central America in the 1980s. This conflict ends in a military coup and causes a significant economic collapse. As a result, the Soviet Union is itself preserved from collapse, and the European Common Market and Japan emerge as global superpowers. In tandem with economic collapse, other disasters have wreaked havoc across the globe, including food blights and devastating famines, as well as the destruction of entire regions of land as a consequence of war. By the late 1990s, the Middle East has become a radioactive desert in the fallout of nuclear conflict.

With the lack of government and police enforcement due to the Central American wars and subsequent economic collapse, casual violence has become endemic in many parts of the world. At the same time, megacorporations have risen to power and fight amongst themselves for dominance, and orbital habitats have begun to develop and form into independent states, both causes and symptoms of the increasing fracturing of civilization. Bioengineering, against a backdrop of warfare, has resulted in the rapid development of cybernetic prosthetics and direct human-machine interfaces, and many now suffer from &quot;technoshock&quot;, an inability to cope with a world of synthetic muscle tissue, organic circuits, and designer drugs.

The main location for &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; is the fictional Night City, situated on the West Coast of the United States between Los Angeles and San Francisco. With a population of five million, it presents a stratified society of gang warfare, corporate rivalries, and political machinations in which the players must survive.

==System==
The rules of &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; are built on R. Talsorian&#x27;s Interlock system.

A core game mechanic is the concept of Difficulty Values, used to gauge whether a player succeeds or fails at any given task. A player takes the value of their most appropriate character attribute, adds the values of any relevant skills or modifiers, and then finally adds the value of a ten-sided die roll. In order to succeed, they must beat the Difficulty Value assigned to the task by the gamemaster. &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; was one of the first tabletop games to use this concept.

===Character creation===
As cyberpunks, the players embrace body modification, cybertech and bioengineering. They live by four tenets:
# Style over substance.
# Attitude is everything.
# Always take it to the Edge.
# (Break) the rules.

There are ten key roles, each with their own special abilities. These include charismatic musicians (&#x27;rockerboys&#x27;), bodyguards and assassins (&#x27;solos&#x27;), computer hackers (&#x27;netrunners&#x27;), road warriors (&#x27;nomads&#x27;), street experts (&#x27;fixers&#x27;), investigative journalists and reporters (&#x27;medias&#x27;), mechanics (&#x27;techs&#x27; or &#x27;techies&#x27;), doctors (&#x27;medtechs&#x27;), corporate executives (&#x27;corpos&#x27;), and police officers (&#x27;lawmen&#x27;).

A choice of rules are provided for character creation, either by assigning points to purchase skills or by rolling d10s for a more random outcome. A system called Lifepath is provided to develop each character further, by generating goals, motivations, and events from their past. Finally, they gain money, cyberware, weapons and other equipment, including fashion and lifestyle goods.

Further character development is skill-based rather than level-based; for successful play, players are awarded points to be spent on improving their characters&#x27; skill sets.

===Combat===
The combat system is called Friday Night Firefight (FNFF), and emphasizes lethality. Unlike role-playing systems where characters amass hit points as they progress, allowing them to survive higher amounts of combat damage, the amount of damage a character can sustain in &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; does not generally increase as the character develops.

Each round, characters are permitted to take one move action and one other action. There are rules governing the use of autofire, armor, and cover, including specific instructions for using people as shields. Alternative ammunition types for weapons are available, for example a shotgun can be fired with buckshot instead of slugs. Character skills can be used to improve both ranged and melee combat.

Additionally, there are rules covering other forms of damage such as drowning and asphyxiation, electrocution, and being set on fire.

===Netrunning===
There are also rules for cybernetic hacking, called Netrunning. When characters &quot;jack in&quot;, they can interpret the NET in several different ways, including as a classic &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; maze, or perhaps as a star-filled galaxy.

Netrunners engage in the virtual world with interface plugs, &quot;cyberdecks&quot;, and the Interface special ability. Cyberdecks include slots to contain Programs, selected ahead of time by Netrunners to assist in tasks such as evasion, decryption and detection. Combat and other actions in the NET are fast, taking place second-by-second, as opposed to three second combat rounds in the physical world.

The destruction of the global NET in later editions of &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; turns the attention of Netrunners to local private networks. The effect on gameplay is that Netrunning is no longer a remote activity; Netrunners are embedded within their team and, with equipment such as &quot;virtuality goggles,&quot; can alternate their actions between both physical and virtual space. Closer integration with other activities was a game design choice to ensure all characters have a part to play during a hacking scene.

===Empathy and cyberpsychosis===
The acquisition of cyberware—cyberweapons, cyberoptics and other implants—carries a Humanity Cost.
Every ten points of Humanity Cost causes the loss of an Empathy point, the character attribute that measures how well they relate to other people.
An Empathy level of zero represents a complete loss of humanity, a state known as cyberpsychosis; in the case of players, their character becomes a non-player character controlled by the gamemaster.

==History==
&quot;Cyberpunk&quot; was designed by Mike Pondsmith as an attempt to replicate the gritty realism of 1980s cyberpunk science fiction. In particular, Walter Jon Williams&#x27; novel &quot;Hardwired&quot; was an inspiration, and Williams helped playtest the game. Another key influence was the film &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. Many also assume William Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Neuromancer&quot; was an influence; however, Pondsmith did not read the novel until a later date. Other sources included the film &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; and the anime &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot;.

===First edition===

The original version of &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; was published in 1988 by R. Talsorian Games. The game components of the boxed set consist of a 44-page &quot;Handbook&quot;, a 38-page &quot;Sourcebook&quot;, a 20-page &quot;Combat Book&quot;, four pages of game aids and two ten-sided dice.

A number of rules supplements were subsequently published in 1989:
* &quot;Rockerboy&quot; (sourcebook for the Rockerboy character class)
* &quot;Solo of Fortune&quot; (sourcebook for the Solo character class)
* &quot;&quot; (based on the Walter Jon Williams novel)
* &quot;Near Orbit: Space Supplement&quot; (with rules for space travel)

This edition of the game retroactively became known as Cyberpunk 2013.

===Second edition: &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot;===

In 1990, R. Talsorian Games released the second edition of the game, titled &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot;, which featured updated rules for combat, Netrunning, and character generation. The game&#x27;s timeline was also retconned to accommodate the German reunification in 1990. It was released as a boxed set that contained a 222-page softcover book, and a 24-page reference guide and adventure.

R. Talsorian Games released two revised versions: &quot;Cyberpunk 2020 version 2.00&quot; (1992), and &quot;Cyberpunk 2020 version 2.01&quot; (1993).

A total of 28 rules supplements and sourcebooks, and 6 adventures were also published by R. Talsorian Games between 1993 and 1996. In addition, Atlas Games published twelve adventures under license between 1991 and 1994.

Dream Pod 9 released &quot;Night&#x27;s Edge&quot; in 1992, taking the &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot; setting and adding a horror theme, including vampires and werewolves. Dream Pod 9 published ten other supplements and adventures in this setting between 1992 and 1995.

An alternate world sourcebook, &quot;Cybergeneration&quot;, was published in 1993; it centers around teenagers with unusual, superhuman skills gained from a nanotech virus epidemic. The first version of &quot;Cybergeneration&quot; required the &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot; rulebook, but a second version became a standalone game.

Two &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot; novels were published, in 1995 and 1996.

===Third edition: &quot;Cyberpunk V3.0&quot;===

&quot;Cyberpunk V3.0&quot; is set in the 2030s, and was published in 2005. It takes &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; into a transhumanist setting in the aftermath of a fourth Corporate War. The global NET has been corrupted and rendered unusable, as has much hardcopied data, throwing human history into doubt. Six new subcultures have emerged, known as Altcults; one such group are the Edgerunners, successors to the cyberpunks of previous editions.

The third edition uses the Fuzion game system, rather than Interlock. The artwork in the book used photographs of action figures and toys instead of hand-drawn art like in previous editions. Both the change of setting and the artwork within the book received negative criticism.

From 2007 to 2008, two sourcebooks were published to accompany this edition.

===Fourth edition: &quot;Cyberpunk Red&quot;===

The fourth edition of &quot;Cyberpunk&quot;, titled &quot;Cyberpunk Red&quot;, is set in 2045, following the events of &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot; and serving as a prequel to the video game &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot;. The game is set after a fourth Corporate War; however, the events differ from &quot;Cyberpunk V3.0&quot;, which is considered to be a separate timeline.

The &quot;Cyberpunk Red&quot; core rulebook was released in November 2020. It was preceded by the release of a simplified boxed set, known as the &quot;Cyberpunk Red Jumpstart Kit&quot;, at Gen Con in August 2019. The core rulebook was delayed from a planned release alongside the &quot;Jumpstart Kit&quot;, initially to allow &quot;Cyberpunk Red&quot; game lore to be better aligned with &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot;, and later due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

R. Talsorian began developing a new &quot;Cyberpunk Edgerunners Mission Kit&quot; based on the successful &quot;&quot; anime series, itself based on the &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot; video game by CD Projekt Red. The missions will use the existing Cyberpunk RED tabletop roleplaying game engine. The sourcebook began development in response to the popularity of game mods created for the video game. The new set takes place in the 2077 timeline, with R. Talsorian announcing plans to continue making content for the 2045 setting.

===Collectible card games===
Two different, independent collectible card games have been licensed and produced based on the &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; setting. The first, called &quot;Netrunner&quot;, was designed by Richard Garfield, and released by Wizards of the Coast in 1996 (the game has since been re-released as &quot;&quot; but is no longer associated with the &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; universe). The second was called &quot;Cyberpunk CCG&quot;, released in 2003, designed by Peter Wacks and published by Social Games.

==Reception==
In Issue 37 of &quot;Challenge&quot;, Julia Martin commented, &quot;the game has style. While it is a game with some ragged edges, &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; recreates the atmosphere of the literature and movies from which it draws admirably.&quot; Martin had issues with the combat system, especially the organization of the rules, some ambiguous rules, and the lack of super-advanced weaponry. She also grumbled about typos, noting, &quot;Quite frankly, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen this many apparently careless, minor errors since Judges Guild went defunct some years ago.&quot; She also found the netrunning system far too general. Despite all these problems, she confessed, &quot;I really like this game. It has lots of problems, [...] but it has a great many redeeming points also. [...] The characters and the world view are the heart of Cyberpunk, and they are the best of it.&quot; She concluded, &quot;It is a marvelous creature which can be molded into a tremendous campaign by a referee with experience. It is definitely worth the money (and you might even like the combat system). Go check it out.&quot;

Stewart Wieck reviewed &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; for &quot;White Wolf&quot; #14, rating it 3 overall, and stated that &quot;Cyberpunk is a fine game set in an environment which is very conducive to role-playing.&quot;

In the May 1989 edition of &quot;Games International&quot; (Issue 5), Paul Mason found the rules disorganized and lacked an index. He also found lots of typos, &quot;the sign of a rushed production.&quot; Although Mason found the concept behind the game &quot;quite appealing,&quot; he thought that the combat system, which was supposed to be an improvement on the usual non-descriptive hit point system, was too constricted by data tables to be very descriptive. He concluded by giving this game an average rating of 3 out of 5, saying, &quot;All in all, &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; does the job. If you want to run a game in this genre and you want a single source of rules and background, then this game will be adequate to the task [...] It doesn&#x27;t contain any ideas radically new to rolegaming, however, and so won&#x27;t be much use to anyone else except inveterate collectors.&quot;

In the September 1989 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 149), Jim Bambra liked the production values of the original edition, but found many typos in the various books as well as a missing encounter table. Bambra found the setting &quot;does a superb job of capturing the flavor and atmosphere of a disturbingly plausible and realistic future. The development and presentation of the Net is stunning and can be used as a basis for countless numbers of adventures. No other game has succeeded in portraying computer hacking in such a vibrant and absorbing way.&quot; He concluded that this was not for everyone: &quot;Gamers brought up on heroic-fantasy or shiny science-fiction games may find the gritty realism of the &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; game not to their liking... To decide if this is the game for you, read a few of the Cyberpunk style novels. If you like them, don’t waste any time — rush out and buy the &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; game. Welcome to life on the edge.&quot;

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, game critic Rick Swan commented that this game &quot;remains the purist&#x27;s choice, the RPG most successfully capturing the genre&#x27;s grim atmosphere.&quot; He found that &quot;Combat is chart-heavy but playable, and extremely dangerous for player characters; one well-placed shot is all that it takes to wipe out a careless Nomad.&quot; Swan concluded by giving the game a rating of 3 out of 4, saying, &quot;&quot;Cyberpunk&quot;″s gritty realism may not be everyone&#x27;s idea of a good time; characters tends to lead short, intense lives, flashy heroics are in short supply, and cynicism abounds. A terrific game for pessimists.&quot; 

Stewart Wieck reviewed the 2nd edition of &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #24 (Dec./Jan., 1990), rating it a 4 out of 5 and stated that &quot;A definite improvement over the first edition, &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot; revamps the first cyberpunk genre game and deserves the attention of all cyberpunk genre gamers.&quot;

In the September 1992 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 185), Allen Varney found &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot; just as stylish as its first-edition predecessor, but he found even more typos in this edition than in the first edition. Varney liked the new streamlined combat system, but criticized the duality of modern combat, where &quot;unarmored characters become pools of blood in 10 seconds of combat, but those in flak armor can shrug off submachine-gun fire.&quot; Varney also felt that the Netrunning system was much improved, calling the rules system &quot;elegant and original.&quot; Varney thought the second edition&#x27;s biggest flaw was lack of an index, but he also criticized the dichotomy of a system where &quot;you can break into Eurobank and embezzle five million bucks, but you better pay your phone bill on time or you’re in big trouble.&quot; He accused the game of being &quot;in the curious position of advocating rebellion, but only in socially acceptable ways.&quot; Nonetheless, Varney concluded that &quot;The &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; game’s second edition surpasses its first edition on every count. With its smooth action, &#x27;pure&#x27; cyberpunk atmosphere, easily accessible setting, and medium-low complexity, this game tops my list as the field&#x27;s best route to dark near-future adventure.&quot;

In a 1996 reader poll undertaken by &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time, &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; was ranked 10th. Editor Paul Pettengale commented: &quot;&quot;Cyberpunk&quot; was the first of the &#x27;straight&#x27; cyberpunk RPGs, and is still the best. The difference between cyberpunk and other sci-fi is a matter of style and attitude. Everything about the &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; game, from the background to the rules system, is designed to create this vital atmosphere. &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; is set in an unforgiving world where betrayal and double-crosses are common, trust is hard to find and paranoia is a useful survival trait.&quot;

In November 2020, &quot;Forbes&quot; found &quot;Cyberpunk Red&quot; to be a consistent continuation of the themes from &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot;. Contributor Rob Wieland praised the system for character generation, stating, &quot;One of the signature elements of the game, lifepaths, went through a great refinement. Lifepath is a chart where players roll to determine elements of their character’s history. It creates lovers, friends, rivals and more for GMs to hang plot hooks on. &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; thrives on the personal connections between characters. Lifepath makes player buy-in easier; players are going to be much more interested in a job given to them by an old flame than a random NPC.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted this game&#x27;s influence on the genre, saying, &quot;The moral ambiguity introduced here eventually becomes a significant part of the language of urban science fiction and fantasy, paving the way for games like &quot;Shadowrun&quot;, &quot;Nightlife&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Unknown Armies&quot;, and more in the edgy &#x27;90s.&quot;

<text>Tejano music (), also known as Tex-Mex music, is a popular music style fusing Mexican influences. Its evolution began in northern Mexico (a variation of regional Mexican music known as ).

It reached a larger audience in the late 20th century with the popularity of Mazz, Selena, and other performers like La Mafia, Ram Herrera, La Sombra, Elida Reyna, Elsa García, Laura Canales, Oscar Estrada, Jay Perez, Emilio Navaira, Esteban &quot;Steve&quot; Jordan, Shelly Lares, David Lee Garza, Jennifer Peña and La Fiebre.

==Origins==
Europeans from Germany (first during the Spanish regime in the 1830s), Poland, and Czechia migrated to Texas and Mexico, bringing with them their style of music and dance. They brought with them the accordion, polkas music and dance. Their music influenced the Tejanos. Central to the evolution of early Tejano music was the blend of traditional forms such as the corrido and mariachi, and Continental European styles, such as polka introduced by German, Polish, and Czech settlers in the late 19th century. In particular, the accordion was adopted by Tejano folk musicians at the turn of the 20th century, and it became a popular instrument for amateur musicians in Texas and Northern Mexico. Small bands known as &quot;orquestas&quot;, featuring amateur musicians, became a staple at community dances. Early inceptions of Tejano music demonstrated musical innovation, but also a social and cultural innovation in themes that countered narratives of dominant culture.

At the turn of the century, Tejanos were mostly involved in ranching and agriculture. The only diversion was the occasional traveling musician who would come to the ranches and farms. Their basic instruments were the flute, guitar, and drum, and they sang songs that were passed down through the generations from songs originally sung in Mexico. One of these musicians was Lydia Mendoza, who became one of the first to record Spanish language music as part of RCA&#x27;s expansion of their popular race records of the 1920s. As these traveling musicians traveled into areas where the German Texans and other European settlers lived. 

&quot;Norteño&quot;/&quot;conjunto&quot; accordion pioneer Narciso Martínez, known as the &quot;Father of Conjunto Music&quot;, defined the accordion&#x27;s role in conjunto music. He learned many tunes from German, Polish and Czech brass bands and transposed them to accordion. Martínez gave accordion playing a new virtuosity in the 1930s, when he adopted the two button row accordion. At the same time, he formed a group with &quot;bajo sexto&quot; player Santiago Almeida.
With the accordion, drums, and &quot;bajo sexto&quot;, Tejanos now had a sound they could begin to call their own. In the 1940s, Valerio Longoria introduced lyrics to &quot;conjunto&quot; music, further establishing the Tejano claim to this new sound.

In the 1950s, Isidro Lopez further revolutionized the Tejano sound by emphasizing less on the traditional Spanish that Valerio used and using the new Tex-Mex instead. This created a newer sound and took us one step close to the sound we have today. In the 1960s and 70s Little Joe and The Latinaires (later renamed La Familia), The Latin Breed, Luis Ramirez Y su Latin Express, and others infused the orchestra sound into the Tejano sound, taking their influences from Pop, R&amp;B, and other forms of music. In the late 70s and early 80s, there was a new sound emerging with up-and-coming groups like McAllen&#x27;s Espejismo, led by songwriter/lead singer Rudy Valdez, and Brownsville natives Joe Lopez, Jimmy Gonzalez, and Mazz introduced keyboard to Tejano, influenced by the disco sound of the era. During that period, La Mafia became the first Tejano band to put on rock-style shows for their generation.

== History ==
Tejano musicians like Flaco Jiménez and Esteban Steve Jordan carried on Martinez&#x27;s tradition of accordion virtuosity and became a fixture on the international World Music scene by the 1980s.

In the 1950s and 1960s, rock and roll and country music made inroads, and electric guitars and drums were added to conjunto combos. Also, performers such as Little Joe added both nuances of soul music and R&amp;B, and a Chicano political consciousness. Little Joe, Estevan Jordan, The Royal Jesters, Romances, Carlos Guzman, Joe Bravo, Dimas Three, Chuck &amp; the Dots, the Sky Tones, the Broken Hearts, the Volumes and Sunny Ozuna and the Sunliners were popular in 1960s.

The 1960s and 1970s brought a new chicano music and the first La Onda Tejana Broadcasters. Popular Tejano musician and producer Paulino Bernal of the Conjunto Bernal discovered and introduced to the Tejano music scene the norteño band Los Relampagos del Norte with Ramón Ayala and Cornelio Reyna on his Bego Records. Ayala still enjoys success on both sides of the border. Reyna enjoyed a very successful career as an actor and solo singer and resurfaced in the Tejano scene with a major hit with his collaboration with Tejano band La Mafia. He toured constantly until his death. In the 1960s and 1970s, the first La Onda Tejana broadcasting pioneers hit the airwaves including Marcelo Tafoya (first recipient of the Tejano Music Awards &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award), Ramiro &quot;Snowball&quot; de la Cruz, Mary Rodriguez, Rosita Ornelas, and Luis Gonzalez, shortly followed by an influx of broadcasters including the Davila family of San Antonio. This central Texas support by popular broadcasters helped fuel La Onda.

In 1987, Gloria Anzaldúa wrote: 

La Onda popularity continued to surge in the early to mid-1980s with the fusion progression of Tejano music coming to the forefront regionally with Tejano ballads like Espejismo&#x27;s hit &quot;Somos Los Dos&quot;, written and sung by McAllen native Rudy Valdez, and La Sombra with their Tex-Mex English and Spanish brand of Tejano. As the 1990s dawned, La Mafia, already holding over a dozen Tejano Music Awards, originated a new Tejano style later to become a Tejano standard. With extensive touring from as early as 1988, they eventually opened the doors for such artists as Selena Quintanilla, Emilio Navaira, Jay Perez, and Mazz. Electronic instruments and synthesizers increasingly dominated the sound, and Tejano music increasingly appealed to bilingual country and rock fans. In the wake of her murder, Selena Quintanilla&#x27;s music received attention from a mainstream American audience as well. Quintanilla, known as &quot;The Queen of Tejano Music&quot;, became the first female Tejano artist to win a Grammy and her &quot;Ven Conmigo&quot; became the first Tejano album by a female artist to be certified gold.

Since the end of the 20th century, Tejano has seen a decline of dedicated radio stations across the US, due to several factors. Among these is the success of Intocable. As a result, many radio stations across the U.S., especially in Texas, have converted to Norteño/banda. This has caused Tejano internet radio to become popular.

At the turn of the 21st century, Tejano influence has declined in part due to decreased promotion, the rise in Regional Mexican and other Latin music, the breakup or retirement of established performers, and the emergence of few new performers. Most Tejano artists who performed throughout the 1990s during the music&#x27;s peak who are still performing today have rarely played to the same wide attention in recent years. Regardless, today&#x27;s Tejano music, while far more pop-oriented than its Depression-era roots, is still a regional musical style in several Tejano communities as well as in other parts of the United States.

==Development==


Tejano music was born in Texas. Although it has influences from Mexico and other Latin American countries, the main influences are American. The types of music that make up Tejano are folk music, roots music, rock, R&amp;B, soul music, blues, country music and the Latin influences of norteño, mariachi, and Mexican cumbia. Tejano musicians such as Emilio and Raulito Navaira, David Lee Garza, and Jay Perez exhibit influence from rock and roots music.

Tejano has various categories of music and bands. Three major categories are conjunto, orchestra/orquesta, and modern. A conjunto band is composed of accordion, bajo sexto, electric bass, and drums. Examples of conjunto bands are Esteban &quot;Steve&quot; Jordan, and The Hometown Boys. An orchestra/orquesta consists of bass, drums, electric guitar, synthesizer, and a brass section on which it relies heavily for its sound. Some examples of Modern bands are Ruben Ramos and the Texas Revolution, The Liberty Band, The Latin Breed, La Mafia, Selena Quintanilla, La Sombra, Elida Reyna y Avante, Los Palominos, David Lee Garza y Los Musicales, Shelly Lares, Jay Perez, and Mazz.

Mexican influence on Tejano music has resulted in a sound increasingly more like Norteño. The accordion, while a historically popular instrument in Tejano music, has gone from a secondary instrument to a must-have instrument. Today, groups like Sunny Sauceda, Eddie Gonzalez, and La Tropa F emphasize the accordion.

== Music industry ==
During the Post World War II years, local and regional companies emerged to record and market Tejano music. Key factors that influenced the production of Tejano music can be attributed to a diversifying American culture and greater socioeconomic opportunities enabled Mexican American musicians to perform and record music for regional audiences. Early popular forms of Tejano music in the form of female duets and &quot;orquesta tejana&quot; of the 1940s later influenced the development of Tex-Mex style of the 1950s, and &quot;La Onda Chicana (The Chicano Wave)&quot; of the 1960s. The growing popularity of accordion based music and &quot;homegrown&quot; records directly influenced the need for Tejano record producers and labels.

Record companies such as &quot;Discos Ideal&quot; established in San Benito, Texas in 1947 and Freddie Records established in Corpus Christi, Texas in 1970 are among the most prolific in producing &quot;conjunto&quot; style music. Freddie Records, named after founder, Freddie Martinez, Sr. has remained a key figure in the production of Tejano music well into the 21st century.

==Influence==
The term &quot;Tex-Mex&quot; is also used in American rock and roll for Tejano-influenced performers such as the Sir Douglas Quintet and the Texas Tornados (featuring Flaco Jiménez, Freddy Fender, Augie Meyers, and Doug Sahm), Los Super Seven, Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs, Los Lobos, Latin Playboys, Louie and the Lovers, The Champs, Ry Cooder, Calexico, Los Lonely Boys, The Mavericks, Son de Rey, and Selena y Los Dinos.

Texan accordion music has also influenced Basque trikitixa players.

Contemporary Swedish-American composer Sven-David Sandström has incorporated Tejano stylings in his classical music.

Tejano and conjunto music is so popular that organizations such as the Guadalupe Arts Center in San Antonio, Texas hold annual festivals every year. The performers have included legends such as Flaco Jiménez, conjunto groups from around the world, and contemporary artists.

== Tejano music female singers of the late 1980s and 1990s ==
The unknown history of many Tejano female singers in the late 1980s and 1990s has remained in the dark because of little to no media exposure; perhaps, the media was fixated on the biggest names like Selena, Laura Canales, Elsa García (singer), Elida Reyna, Shelly Lares and a few others. They were famous and well promoted for good reason - they had notable vocal talent, great producers, top class musicians (bands), and recording studios that rushed to give them the publicity they needed. Tejano female singers Lynda V (and the Boys) and Letty Guval are two amongst others who made their mark in Tejano Music in 1990s but little is known about them. Lynda V (and the Boys) formed her band in 1988, signed a record contract with Bob Griever and CBS Records in 1990, and two years later signed a record deal with major company Capitol EMI. Lynda V and the Boys worked together as a band until 2005. Letty Guval started her Tejano music career in 1994 after singing with the University of Texas Pan American Mariachi Band in Edinburg for two years. She signed a record contract with Wicker Records in 1994 and signed a four-year contract with Fonovisa-Platino Records; her career was short-lived, but she was the first female Tejano artist to be invited to sing at the White House during the Clinton administration in 1994. In her News article, Kelly James from the &quot;South Bend Tribune&quot; writes about Letty, &quot;Born in California, raised in Mexico, and educated in Texas, Guval incorporates her cross-cultural experience into her music.&quot; In his book, Guadalupe San Miguel, Jr. writes about both, Letty Guval and Lynda V, he writes, &quot;EMI Latin … had five relatively new female acts: Stephanie Lynn, Elsa García, Lynda V. and the Boys, Agnes Torres of the New Variety Band, and Delia y Culturas&quot;.  About Letty Guval San Miguel says, &quot;Occasionally, Tejano musicians provided only touches of music from other styles, their incorporation into Tejano music was brief enough so that it did not interrupt the beat of the song. Two examples come to mind—one from Letty Guval and the second from Conjunto Bernal. In the mid-1990s, Guval, a popular Tejana performer, recorded a ranchera called &#x27;Sentimiento.&#x27; At key points in the song and for only a few seconds, she incorporated some &quot;banda&quot; rhythms.&quot; Both Lynda V. and Letty Guval traveled the United States and Mexico performing for many. In the 1990s both performed different times at the Tejano Music Awards and the Johnny Canales Show.

<doc id="151826" wikidata="Q312214" url="?curid=151826" title="Marrano">
<text>Marranos is a term for Spanish and Portuguese Jews who converted to Christianity, either voluntarily or by Spanish or Portuguese royal coercion, during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, but who continued to practice Judaism in secrecy or were suspected of it. They are also called crypto-Jews, the term increasingly preferred in scholarly works over &quot;Marranos&quot;.

The term specifically refers to the charge of crypto-Judaism, whereas the term &quot;converso&quot; was used for the wider population of Jewish converts to Catholicism, whether or not they secretly still practised Jewish rites. Converts from either Judaism or Islam were referred to by the broader term of &quot;New Christians&quot;.

The term &quot;marrano&quot; came into later use in 1492 with the Castilian Alhambra Decree, which prohibited the practice of Judaism in Spain and required all remaining Jews to convert or leave. The Spanish Inquisition was established prior to the decree, surveilled New Christians to detect whether their conversion to Christianity was sincere. The vast majority of Jews in Spain had converted to Catholicism, perhaps under pressure from the Massacre of 1391, and &quot;conversos&quot; numbered hundreds of thousands. They were monitored by the Spanish Inquisition and subject to suspicions by Old Christians of the secret practice of Judaism, whether or not that was the case.

In modern use, &quot;marrano&quot; can be considered offensive and pejorative, although some scholars continue to use the term interchangeably with &quot;converso&quot; or crypto-Jew. In modern Spanish, &quot;marrano&quot; means &quot;pig&quot;, or, more often, &quot;dirty person&quot;. Because of these possible meanings for the term &quot;Marrano&quot; might also be offensive to some descendants of Spanish Jews.

==Etymology==
The origin of the term &quot;Marrano&quot; as applied to crypto-Jews is unclear, since there have been several proposed etymologies in addition to swine. 

The Hebrew word for &quot;Meshumad&quot;, literally standing for &quot;self-destroyed&quot; or a heretic to Judaism, for a Jew who deliberately rebels against the observance of Jewish law.

The main difference between a &quot;Min&quot;, a &quot;Meshumad&quot;, and the &quot;Anusim&quot; is that the act of abandonment of Judaism is voluntary for a Min and a Meshumad, while for the Anusim it is not.

One source of the term derives from an Arabic word for &quot;forbidden, illicit&quot;, &quot;Muḥarram&quot;. The Arabic word in this context means &quot;swine&quot; or &quot;pork&quot;, and either expresses the same repulsion towards the converts that the converts previously had for these ritually unclean meat. 

However, as applied to Crypto-Jews, the term Marrano derives from the Spanish &amp; Portuguese verb &quot;marrar&quot; and &quot;amarrar&quot; meaning &quot;to fail&quot;, &quot;to plan to go wrong&quot;, &quot;to break away&quot;, &quot;to defraud&quot;, &quot;to target&quot;, &quot;to tie up&quot;, &quot;to refrain&quot;, &quot;to deviate&quot;, &quot;to clinch&quot;, &quot;to moor&quot;, illuminating that those targeted and forced by the Spanish Crown had no choice but to adopt Christianity, either leave the Kingdom of Spain all while the Crown seized their property and money and gave them no support to leave, be murdered either for not showing complete loyalty to Christianity or for leaving Spain and coming back showing that these Jews were traitors to the Spanish Crown. 

It also has Arabic origin meaning &quot;to deviate&quot; or &quot;to err&quot;, in the sense that they deviated from their newly adopted faith by secretly continuing to practice Judaism. A third origin has been cited from Galician-Portuguese, where &quot;marrar&quot; means &quot;to force&quot; and &quot;marrano&quot; means &quot;forced one&quot;, indicating the compulsory nature of the religious conversions. José Meir Estrugo Hazán writes in his book &quot;Los Sefardíes&quot; that &quot;marrano&quot; is the term the Spanish Jews prefer.

Under state pressure in the late 14th and early 15th century, over half of Jews in the Iberian Peninsula converted to Christianity, thus avoiding the Decree of Expulsion which affected Spain&#x27;s remaining openly Jewish population in 1492. The numbers who converted and the effects of various migrations in and out of the area have been the subject of historical debate. A phylogeographic study in 2008 of 1,150 volunteer Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups appeared to support the idea that the number of conversions has been significantly underestimated, as 20% of the tested Iberian population had haplogroups consistent with Sephardi ancestry. This percentage was suggested as representing the proportion of Sephardi in the population at the time of mass conversions in the 14th and 15th centuries. However, the authors concede that other historical population movements from the Near East such as Syrians and Phoenicians may also account for these results.

==Portugal==

Some Portuguese &quot;conversos&quot; or &quot;cristãos-novos&quot; continued to practice as crypto-Jews. In the early 20th century, historian Samuel Schwartz wrote about crypto-Jewish communities discovered in northeastern Portugal (namely, Belmonte, Bragança, Miranda, and Chaves). He claimed that members had managed to survive more than four centuries without being fully assimilated into the Old Christian population. The last remaining crypto-Jewish community in Belmonte officially returned to Judaism in the 1970s and opened a synagogue in 1996. In 2003, the American Sephardi Federation founded the Belmonte Project to raise funds to acquire Judaic educational material and services for the Belmonte community, who then numbered 160–180.

Two documentary films have been made in north-eastern Portugal where present-day descendants of marranos were interviewed about their lives. In 1974 for &quot;The Marranos of Portugal&quot;, the Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA) sent reporter Ron Ben-Yishai to conduct interviews with families about their religious practice. After being asked to prove he knew Hebrew before they would talk, he found people still reluctant to speak openly. Nevertheless, he did eventually gain a remarkable insight into their version of Jewish customs, prayers and songs. The film was commended at the 1976 Jerusalem Jewish Film and TV Festival. Another documentary, &quot;The Last Marranos&quot;, was made by the New York Jewish Media Fund in 1997.

After the expulsion of Jews and Muslims from Spain (1492) and the Forced Conversion by Portugal&#x27;s King Manuel I in Portugal (1497), &quot;conversos&quot; continued to be suspect in socially strained times. In Lisbon in 1506, a months-long plague caused people to look for scapegoats. Some became suspicious that &quot;conversos&quot; might be practicing Judaism and therefore be at fault. On April 17, 1506, several &quot;conversos&quot; were discovered who had in their possession &quot;some lambs and poultry prepared according to Jewish custom; also unleavened bread and bitter herbs according to the regulations for the Passover, which festival they celebrated far into the night.&quot; Officials seized several but released them after a few days.

On the same day on which the &quot;conversos&quot; were freed, the Dominicans displayed a crucifix and a reliquary in glass from which a peculiar light issued in a side-chapel of their church, where several New Christians were present. A New Christian who tried to explain the miracle as due to natural causes was dragged from the church and killed by an infuriated woman. A Dominican roused the populace still more. Friar João Mocho and the Aragonese friar Bernardo, crucifix in hand, were said to have gone through the streets of the city, crying &quot;Heresy!&quot; and calling upon the people to destroy the &quot;conversos&quot;. Attracted by the outcry, sailors from Holland, Zeeland and others from ships in the port of Lisbon, joined the Dominicans and formed a mob with local men to pursue the &quot;conversos&quot;.

The mob dragged &quot;converso&quot; victims from their houses and killed some. Old Christians who were in any way associated with New Christians were also attacked. The mob attacked the tax-farmer João Rodrigo Mascarenhas, a New Christian; although a wealthy and distinguished man, his work also made him resented by many. They demolished his house. Within 48 hours, many &quot;conversos&quot; were killed; by the third day all who could leave escaped, often with the help of other Portuguese. The killing spree lasted from 19 to 21 April, in what came to be known as the Lisbon massacre.

King Manuel severely punished those who took part in the killings. The ringleaders and the Dominicans who encouraged the riot were also executed. Local people convicted of murder or pillage suffered corporal punishment and their property was confiscated. The king granted religious freedom for 20 years to all &quot;conversos&quot; in an attempt at compensation. Lisbon lost &quot;Foral&quot; (municipal) privileges. The foreigners who had taken part generally escaped punishment, leaving with their ships.

New Christians were attacked in Gouveia, Alentejo, Olivença, Santarém, and other places. In the Azores and the island of Madeira, mobs massacred former Jews. Because of these excesses, the king began to believe that a Portuguese Inquisition might help control such outbreaks.

The Portuguese &quot;conversos&quot; worked to forestall such actions, and spent immense sums to win over the &quot;Curia&quot; and most influential cardinals. Spanish and Portuguese &quot;conversos&quot; made financial sacrifices. Alfonso Gutierrez, Garcia Alvarez &quot;el Rico&quot; (the rich), and the Zapatas, &quot;conversos&quot; from Toledo, offered 80,000 gold crowns to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, if he would mitigate the harshness of the Inquisition.

The Mendes of Lisbon and Flanders also tried to help. None were successful in preventing the Inquisition Papal Bull Meditatio Cordis of July 16, 1547, Inquisition in Portugal. This Bull Meditatio Cordis still did not have the &quot;Power of Confiscation&quot;. Portuguese Marranos continued, with many bribes of the Popes in Rome, and with prolonged negotiation against this &quot;Power of Confiscation&quot; succeeded to delay it 32 years, but finally conceded this &quot;deadly weapon&quot; in 1579. The Portuguese Inquisition now had been endowed, 101 years after the Spanish Inquisition of November 1, 1478, with the same extremities of rigor as the Spanish prototype. The suffered immensely both from mob violence and interrogation and testing by the Inquisition. Attacks and murders were recorded at Trancoso, Lamego, Miranda, Viseu, Guarda, and Braga.

At Covilhã, there were rumors that the people planned to massacre all the New Christians on one day. In 1562, prelates petitioned the &quot;Cortes&quot; to require &quot;conversos&quot; to wear special badges, and to order Jewish descendants to live in ghettos (&quot;judiarias&quot;) in cities and villages as their ancestors had before the conversions.

In 1641, João IV of Portugal ennobled the Curiel family, a Marrano family who served as Agents to the Crown of Spain and Portugal. They held diplomatic positions across Europe until the late 18th century.

In the 1970s, the Marranos of Belmonte officially rejoined Judaism and reestablished ties with the Jews of Israel. The Museu Judaico de Belmonte was opened in 2005 in Belmonte, it is the first Jewish museum in Portugal.

==Spain==
According to historian Cecil Roth, Spanish political intrigues had earlier promoted the anti-Jewish policies which culminated in 1391, when Regent Queen Leonora of Castile gave the Archdeacon of Écija, Ferrand Martinez, considerable power in her realm. Martinez gave speeches that led to violence against the Jews, and this influence culminated in the sack of the Jewish quarter of Seville on June 4, 1391. Throughout Spain during this year, the cities of Ecija, Carmona, Córdoba, Toledo, Barcelona and many others saw their Jewish quarters destroyed and inhabitants massacred.

It is estimated that 200,000 Jews saved their lives by converting to Christianity in the wake of these persecutions. Other Jews left the country altogether and around 100,000 openly practicing Jews remained.

In 1449, feelings rose against &quot;conversos&quot;, breaking out in a riot at Toledo. Instigated by two canons, Juan Alfonso and Pedro Lopez Galvez, the mob plundered and burned the houses of Alonso Cota, a wealthy &quot;converso&quot; and tax-farmer. They also attacked the residences of wealthy New Christians in the quarter of la Magdelena. Under Juan de la Cibdad, the &quot;conversos&quot; opposed the mob, but were repulsed. They were executed with their leader. As a result, several prominent &quot;converso&quot; men were deposed from office, in obedience to a new statute.

Nearly 20 years later in July 1467, another riot occurred where a mob attacked &quot;conversos&quot; in Toledo. The chief magistrate (&quot;alcalde mayor&quot;) of the city was Alvar Gomez de Cibdad Real, who had been private secretary to King Henry IV of Castile. He was a protector of the &quot;conversos.&quot; Together with prominent &quot;conversos&quot; Fernando and Alvaro de la Torre, Alvar wished to take revenge for an insult by the counts de Fuensalida, leaders of the Old Christians. His intention was to seize control of the city, but fierce conflict erupted. Opponents set fire to houses of New Christians near the cathedral. The conflagration spread so rapidly that 1,600 houses were consumed. Both Old Christians and &quot;conversos&quot; perished. The brothers De la Torre were captured and hanged.

Tensions arose in Córdoba between Old Christians and &quot;conversos&quot;, where they formed two hostile parties. On March 14, 1473, during a dedication procession, a girl accidentally threw dirty water from the window of the house of one of the wealthiest &quot;conversos&quot; (the customary way to dispose of it.) The water splashed on an image of the Virgin being carried in procession in honor of a new society (from which &quot;conversos&quot; had been excluded by Bishop D. Pedro.) A local blacksmith started arousing a rabble against the Jews, who he blamed for the insult, which immediately joined in a fierce shout for revenge.

The mob went after &quot;conversos&quot;, denouncing them as heretics, killing them, and burning their houses. To stop the excesses, the highly respected D. Alonso Fernandez de Aguilar, whose wife was a member of the &quot;converso&quot; family of Pacheco, together with his brother D. Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba (&quot;El Gran Capitán&quot;), and a troop of soldiers, hastened to protect the New Christians. D. Alonso called upon the mob to retire. Its leader insulted the count, who immediately felled him with his lance. Aroused, the people considered him a martyr. Incited by Alonso de Aguilar&#x27;s enemy, they again attacked the &quot;conversos&quot;. The rioting lasted three days. Those who escaped sought refuge in the castle, where their protectors also took shelter. The government decreed that Jews and &quot;conversos&quot; should remain in their neighborhood or leave the city.

In 1473, attacks on &quot;conversos&quot; arose in numerous other cities: Montoro, Bujalance, Adamuz, La Rambla, Santaella, and elsewhere. Mobs attacked &quot;conversos&quot; in Andújar, Úbeda, Baeza, and Almodóvar del Campo also. In Valladolid, groups looted the belongings of the New Christians. At Segovia, there was a massacre (May 16, 1474). D. Juan Pacheco, a &quot;converso&quot;, led the attacks. Without the intervention of the alcalde, Andres de Cabrera, all New Christians might have died. At Carmona, it was reported that not one &quot;converso&quot; was left alive.

===Inquisition===
Tens of thousands of Jews were baptised in the three months before the deadline for expulsion, some 40,000 if one accepts the totals given by Kamen: most of these undoubtedly to avoid expulsion, rather than as a sincere change of faith. These &quot;conversos&quot; were the principal concern of the Inquisition; being suspected of continuing to practice Judaism put them at risk of denunciation and trial.

During 1492, about 12,000 &quot;conversos&quot; entered Navarre from Aragon&#x27;s repression, where they were allowed to remain. Tudela in Navarre turned into a &quot;converso&quot; haven. The Tudelans had already proclaimed in 1486 that &quot;if any inquisitor enters their city, he will be thrown into the Ebro river.&quot; Later the resistance to the inquisitors was so strong that its aldermen ordered commissioners and attorneys to ask the Catholic Monarchs to limit the power of the Inquisition in 1510.

The most intense period of persecution of &quot;conversos&quot; lasted until 1530. From 1531 to 1560, however, the percentage of &quot;conversos&quot; among the Inquisition trials dropped to 3% of the total. There was a rebound of persecutions when a group of crypto-Jews was discovered in Quintanar de la Orden in 1588; and there was a rise in denunciations of &quot;conversos&quot; in the last decade of the sixteenth century. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, some &quot;conversos&quot; who had fled to Portugal began to return to Spain, fleeing the persecution of the Portuguese Inquisition, founded in 1536. This led to a rapid increase in the trials of crypto-Jews, among them a number of important financiers. In 1691, during a number of &quot;autos-da-fé&quot; in Majorca, 37 &quot;chuetas&quot;, or &quot;conversos&quot; of Majorca, were burned.

During the eighteenth century the number of &quot;conversos&quot; accused by the Inquisition decreased significantly. Manuel Santiago Vivar, tried in Córdoba in 1818, was the last person tried for being a crypto-Jew.

===Converso-Jewish relations===
The &quot;conversos&quot; of Seville and other cities of Castile, and especially of Aragon, bitterly opposed the Spanish Inquisition established in 1478. They rendered considerable service to the king, and held high legal, financial, and military positions. The government issued an edict directing traditional Jews to live within a ghetto and be separated from &quot;conversos&quot;. Despite the law, however, the Jews remained in communication with their New Christian brethren.

&quot;They sought ways and means to win them from Catholicism and bring them back to Judaism. They instructed the Marranos in the tenets and ceremonies of the Jewish religion; held meetings in which they taught them what they must believe and observe according to the Mosaic law; and enabled them to circumcise themselves and their children. They furnished them with prayer-books; explained the fast-days; read with them the history of their people and their Law; announced to them the coming of the Passover; procured unleavened bread for them for that festival, as well as kosher meat throughout the year; encouraged them to live in conformity with the law of Moses, and persuaded them that there was no law and no truth except the Jewish religion.&quot; These were the charges brought by the government of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile against the Jews. They constituted the grounds for their expulsion and banishment in 1492, so they could not subvert &quot;conversos&quot;. Jews who did not want to leave Spain had to accept baptism as a sign of conversion.

The historian Henry Kamen&#x27;s &quot;Inquisition and Society in Spain in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries&quot; questions whether there were such strong links between &quot;conversos&quot; and Jewish communities. Whilst historians such as Yitzhak Baer state, &quot;the conversos and Jews were one people&quot;, Kamen claims, &quot;Yet if the conversos were hated by the Christians, the Jews liked them no better.&quot; He documented that &quot;Jews testified falsely against them [the conversos] when the Inquisition was finally founded.&quot; This issue is being debated by historians.

==Conversos in Italy==
Although the vast majority of Spain&#x27;s 250,000 &quot;conversos&quot; had abandoned Judaism and been assimilated into Spain&#x27;s dominant Catholic culture, many of those continuing to secretly practice their former religion felt threatened and persecuted by the Inquisition which continued to actively persecute heresy. Some of these chose to leave Spain, in bands or as individual refugees. Many migrated to Italy, attracted by the climate, which resembled that of the Iberian Peninsula, and by the kindred language. When they settled at Ferrara, Duke Ercole I d&#x27;Este granted them privileges. His son Alfonso confirmed the privileges to twenty-one Spanish &quot;conversos&quot;: physicians, merchants, and others (ib. xv. 113 et seq.). A thoroughly researched history of these migrations is also contained in the book about one of their leaders Dona Gracia Nasi called, &quot;The Woman Who Defied Kings&quot;, by the historian and journalist Andree Aelion Brooks.

Spanish and Portuguese &quot;conversos&quot; also settled at Florence and contributed to make Livorno a leading seaport. They received privileges at Venice, where they were protected from the persecutions of the Inquisition. In Milan they materially advanced the interests of the city with their industry and commerce. At Bologna, Pisa, Naples, and numerous other Italian cities, they freely exercised the Jewish religion again. They were soon so numerous that Fernando de Goes Loureiro, an abbot from Oporto, filled an entire book with the names of &quot;conversos&quot; who had drawn large sums from Portugal and had openly avowed Judaism in Italy.

In Piedmont, Duke Emmanuel Philibert of Savoy welcomed &quot;conversos&quot; from Coímbra and granted them commercial and industrial privileges, as well as the free exercise of their religion. Rome was full of &quot;conversos&quot;. Pope Paul III received them at Ancona for commercial reasons. He granted complete liberty &quot;to all persons from Portugal and Algarve, even if belonging to the class of New Christians.&quot; By 1553 three thousand Portuguese Jews and &quot;conversos&quot; were living at Ancona.

Two years later, Pope Paul IV issued orders to have all the &quot;conversos&quot; in Papal states be thrown into the prisons of the Inquisition which he had instituted. Sixty of them, who acknowledged the Catholic faith as penitents, were transported to the island of Malta; twenty-four, who adhered to Judaism, were publicly burned (May 1556). Those who escaped the Inquisition were received at Pesaro by Guidobaldo II della Rovere, Duke of Urbino. Guidobaldo had hoped to have the Jews and &quot;conversos&quot; of Turkey select Pesaro as a commercial center; when that did not happen, he expelled the New Christians from Pesaro and other districts in 1558 (ib. xvi. 61 et seq.).

Many &quot;conversos&quot; also went to Dubrovnik, formerly a considerable Croatian seaport on the Adriatic Sea. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled with Portuguese refugees.

==Latin America==
During the 16th and 17th centuries, some &quot;conversos&quot; migrated to the Americas, often the Castilian territories of the Vice-royalties of New Spain, Peru, and the Río de la Plata in Argentina. Legal emigration to the New World was strictly controlled and required proof of three generations of Christian ascendance. Nevertheless, many &quot;conversos&quot; managed to evade these restrictions and managed to obtain &quot;encomiendas&quot; papers of legal identity in the New World.

==France==
According to Isidore Loeb, in a special study of the subject in the &quot;Revue des Études Juives&quot; (xiv. 162–183), about 3,000 Jews came to Provence after the Alhambra Decree expelled Jews from Spain in 1492.

From 1484, one town after another had called for expulsion, but the calls were rejected by Charles VIII. However, Louis XII, in one of his first acts as king in 1498, issued a general expulsion order of the Jews of Provence. Though not enforced at the time, the order was renewed in 1500 and again in 1501. On this occasion, it was definitively implemented. The Jews of Provence were given the option of conversion to Christianity and a number chose that option. However, after a short while – if only to compensate partially for the loss of revenues caused by the departure of the Jews – the king imposed a special tax, referred to as &quot;the tax of the neophytes.&quot; These converts and their descendants soon became the objects of social discrimination and slanders.

==Estado da India (Portuguese India)==
In the &quot;Marrano Factory: The Portuguese Inquisition and Its New Christians 1536-1765&quot;, Professor Antonio Jose Saraiva of the University of Lisbon, writes &quot;King Manuel theoretically abolished discrimination between Old and New Christians by the law of March 1, 1507 which permitted the departure of New Christians to any part of the Christian world, declaring that they “be considered, favored and treated like the Old Christians and not distinct and separated from them in any matter.” Nevertheless, in apparent contradiction to that law, in a letter dated Almeirim, February 18, 1519, King Manuel promoted legislation henceforth prohibiting the naming of New Christians to the position of judge, town councilor or municipal registrar in Goa, stipulating, however, that those already appointed were not to be dismissed. This shows that even during the first nine years of Portuguese rule, Goa had a considerable influx of recently baptized Spanish and Portuguese Jews.&quot;

Some New Christians sought to re-join Jewish populations in India (particularly through the Jewish community in Cochin), while others went on to be extremely influential in the spice trade, and the gems trade between Portugal, and India. This activity aroused the ire of the Catholic clergy. During this period, the first bishop of Goa, Gaspar Jorge de Leão Pereira wrote his anti-Semitic work &quot;&quot;contra os Judeos&quot; (tracts against Jews)&quot;, and called for the establishment of the Inquisition in Goa (which was established in 1560).

==Migrations==
There was no significant wave of emigration of from Spain, the majority of Sephardic communities, such as that of Salonika having been formed as a result of the Alhambra Decree in 1492. However, there was a steady trickle of crypto-Jewish marranos who wished to practice their faith freely to more liberal environments. One of their leaders who helped them get there was the Lisbon-born international banker, Gracia Mendes Nasi. They also migrated to Flanders, where they were attracted by its flourishing cities, such as Antwerp and Brussels. &quot;Conversos&quot; from Flanders, and others direct from the Iberian Peninsula, went under the guise of Catholics to Hamburg and Altona about 1580, where they established a community and held commercial relations with their former homes. Some migrated as far as Scotland. Christian IV of Denmark invited some New Christian families to settle at Glückstadt about 1626, granting certain privileges to them and to &quot;conversos&quot; who came to Emden about 1649.

The vast majority of Spain&#x27;s &quot;conversos&quot;, however, remained in Spain and Portugal and were suspected of &quot;Marranism&quot; by the Spanish Inquisition. Although the wealthier among them could easily bypass discriminatory &quot;Limpieza de sangre&quot; laws, they constituted a significant portion of the over three thousand people executed for heresy by the Spanish Inquisition. In his luminous book the &quot;Marrano Factory: The Portuguese Inquisition and Its New Christians 1536-1765&quot;, Professor Antonio Jose Saraiva of the University of Lisbon, writes that &quot;After August 1531, when the establishment of the Inquisition in Portugal was in the offing and especially after June 14, 1532 when New Christian emigration from Portugal became a capital offense, anti-New Christian sentiment surged on all sides. The New Christians were panic-stricken and emigrants, legal or clandestine, headed for Flanders, Italy, the Ottoman Empire, the Portuguese possessions in India, North Africa. After the middle of the century, England, France, the Spanish Americas and Brazil were the favorite destinations, not necessarily in that order.&quot; The New Christians breathed more freely when Philip III of Spain came to the throne. By the law of April 4, 1601, he granted them the privilege of unrestricted sale of their real estate as well as free departure from the country for themselves, their families, and their property. Many, availing themselves of this permission, followed their coreligionists to North Africa and Turkey. After a few years, however, the privilege was revoked, and the Inquisition resumed its activity.

Some migrated to London, whence their families spread to Brazil (where &quot;conversos&quot; had settled at an early date) and other colonies in the Americas. Migrations to Constantinople and Thessaloniki, where Jewish refugees had settled after the expulsion from Spain, as well as to Italy, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, Vienna, and Timișoara, continued into the middle of the 18th century.

==Today==
Late 20th century political and social changes in Spain caused reappraisal of Jewish and Muslim contributions to its culture. There has been much new scholarship on Sephardic Jews, Moors and the consequences of conversion and expulsion. In addition, there have been official governmental efforts to welcome tourists of both ancestries to Spain. Towns and regions have worked to preserve elements of Jewish and Moorish pasts.

In Spanish Civil Code Art. 22.1, the government created concessions to nationals of several countries and Sephardi Jews historically linked with Spain allowing them to seek citizenship after five years rather than the customary ten required for residence in Spain. Later it was dropped to two years. In November 2012, the residency requirement was eliminated. In October 2006, the Parliament of Andalusia asked the three parliamentary groups that form the majority to support an amendment that would similarly ease the way for nationals of Morisco descent to gain Spanish citizenship. The proposal was originally made by IULV-CA, the Andalusian branch of the United Left.

In 2004, Shlomo Moshe Amar traveled to Portugal to celebrate the centennial anniversary of the Lisbon Synagogue &quot;Shaare Tikvah&quot;. During his stay, Shlomo Moshe Amar met descendants of Jewish families persecuted by the Inquisition who still practice Judaism at the house of rabbi Boaz Pash. This was an historical meeting that had not happened between a Chief Rabbi and Portuguese Bnei Anusim in centuries. Rabbi Shlomo Moshe Amar promised to create a committee to evaluate the Halachic situation of the community. The delay of the Chief Rabbi to create the committee and help the descendants of Sephardi Jews in Portugal forced the creation of a second Jewish community in Lisbon, Comunidade Judaica Masorti Beit Israel, to ensure the recognition of the Bnei Anusim as Jews.

<text>In medicine, a side effect is an effect of the use of a medicinal drug or other treatment, usually adverse but sometimes beneficial, that is unintended. Herbal and traditional medicines also have side effects.

A drug or procedure usually used for a specific effect may be used specifically because of a beneficial side-effect; this is termed &quot;off-label use&quot; until such use is approved. For instance, X-rays have long been used as an imaging technique; the discovery of their oncolytic capability led to their use in radiotherapy for ablation of malignant tumours.

== Frequency of side effects ==

The World Health Organization and other health organisations characterise the probability of experiencing side effects as:

* Very common, ≥ 1⁄10
* Common (frequent), 1⁄10 to 1⁄100
* Uncommon (infrequent), 1⁄100 to 1⁄1000
* Rare, 1⁄1000 to 1⁄10000
* Very rare, &lt; 1⁄10000
The European Commission recommends that the list should contain only effects where there is &quot;at least a reasonable possibility&quot; that they are caused by the drug and the frequency &quot;should represent crude incidence rates (and not differences or relative risks calculated against placebo or other comparator)&quot;. The frequency describes how often symptoms appear &quot;after&quot; taking the drug, without assuming that they were necessarily &quot;caused by&quot; the drug. Both healthcare providers and lay people misinterpret the frequency of side effects as describing the increase in frequency caused by the drug.

==Examples of therapeutic side effects==

Most drugs and procedures have a multitude of reported adverse side effects; the information leaflets provided with virtually all drugs list possible side effects. Beneficial side effects are less common; some examples, in many cases of side-effects that ultimately gained regulatory approval as intended effects, are:
* Bevacizumab (Avastin), used to slow the growth of blood vessels, has been used against dry age-related macular degeneration, as well as macular edema from diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and central retinal vein occlusion.
*Buprenorphine has been shown experimentally (1982–1995) to be effective against severe, refractory depression.
* Bupropion (Wellbutrin), an anti-depressant, also helps smoking cessation; this indication was later approved, and the name of the drug as sold for smoking cessation is Zyban. Bupropion branded as Zyban may be sold at a higher price than as Wellbutrin, so some physicians prescribe Wellbutrin for smoking cessation.
* Carbamazepine is an approved treatment for bipolar disorder and epileptic seizures, but it has side effects useful in treating attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, phantom limb syndrome, paroxysmal extreme pain disorder, neuromyotonia, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
* Dexamethasone and betamethasone in premature labor, to enhance pulmonary maturation of the fetus.
* Doxepin has been used to treat angioedema and severe allergic reactions due to its strong antihistamine properties.
* Gabapentin, approved for treatment of seizures and postherpetic neuralgia in adults, has side effects which are useful in treating bipolar disorder, essential tremor, hot flashes, migraine prophylaxis, neuropathic pain syndromes, phantom limb syndrome, and restless leg syndrome.
* Hydroxyzine, an antihistamine, is also used as an anxiolytic.
* Magnesium sulfate in obstetrics for premature labor and preeclampsia.
* Methotrexate (MTX), approved for the treatment of choriocarcinoma, is frequently used for the medical treatment of an unruptured ectopic pregnancy.
* The SSRI medication sertraline is approved as an antidepressant but delays sexual climax in men, and can be used to treat premature ejaculation.
* Sildenafil was originally intended for pulmonary hypertension; subsequently, it was discovered that it also produces erections, for which it was later approved.
* Terazosin, an α1-adrenergic antagonist approved to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate) and hypertension, is (one of several drugs) used off-label to treat drug induced diaphoresis and hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating).
* Thalidomide, a drug sold over the counter from 1957 to 1961 as a tranquiliser and treatment for morning sickness of pregnancy, became notorious for causing tens of thousands of babies to be born without limbs and with other conditions, or stillborn. The drug, though still subject to other adverse side-effects, is now used to treat cancers and skin disorders, and is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.
