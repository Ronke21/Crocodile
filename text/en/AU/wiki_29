<doc id="150240" wikidata="Q6645095" url="?curid=150240" title="List of watermills in the United Kingdom">
<text>The use of water power in Britain was at its peak just before the Industrial Revolution. The need for power was great and steam power had not yet become established. It is estimated that at this time there were well in excess of ten thousand watermills in the country. Most of these were corn mills (to grind flour), but almost any industrial process needing motive power, beyond that available from the muscles of men or animals, used a water wheel, unless a windmill was preferred.

Today only a fraction of these mills survive. Many are used as private residences, or have been converted into offices. At least one is now a whiskey distillery, and another is a gin distillery. A number have been preserved or restored as museums where the public can see the mill in operation.

This is a list of some of the surviving watermills and tide mills in the United Kingdom.

<text>A watermill or water mill is a mill that uses hydropower. It is a structure that uses a water wheel or water turbine to drive a mechanical process such as milling (grinding), rolling, or hammering. Such processes are needed in the production of many material goods, including flour, lumber, paper, textiles, and many metal products. These watermills may comprise gristmills, sawmills, paper mills, textile mills, hammermills, trip hammering mills, rolling mills, and wire drawing mills.

One major way to classify watermills is by wheel orientation (vertical or horizontal), one powered by a vertical waterwheel through a gear mechanism, and the other equipped with a horizontal waterwheel without such a mechanism. The former type can be further subdivided, depending on where the water hits the wheel paddles, into undershot, overshot, breastshot and pitchback (backshot or reverse shot) waterwheel mills. Another way to classify water mills is by an essential trait about their location: tide mills use the movement of the tide; ship mills are water mills onboard (and constituting) a ship.

Watermills impact the river dynamics of the watercourses where they are installed. During the time watermills operate channels tend to sedimentate, particularly backwater. Also in the backwater area, inundation events and sedimentation of adjacent floodplains increase. Over time however these effects are cancelled by river banks becoming higher. Where mills have been removed, river incision increases and channels deepen.

== History ==

There are two basic types of watermills, one powered by a vertical-waterwheel via a gear mechanism, and the other equipped with a horizontal-waterwheel without such a mechanism. The former type can be further divided, depending on where the water hits the wheel paddles, into undershot, overshot, breastshot and reverse shot waterwheel mills.

=== Western world ===
==== Classical antiquity ====

The Greeks invented the two main components of watermills, the waterwheel and toothed gearing, and used, along with the Romans, undershot, overshot and breastshot waterwheel mills.

The earliest evidence of a water-driven wheel appears in the technical treatises &quot;Pneumatica&quot; and &quot;Parasceuastica&quot; of the Greek engineer Philo of Byzantium (ca. 280−220 BC). The British historian of technology M.J.T. Lewis has shown that those portions of Philo of Byzantium&#x27;s mechanical treatise which describe water wheels and which have been previously regarded as later Arabic interpolations, actually date back to the Greek 3rd century BC original. The sakia gear is, already fully developed, for the first time attested in a 2nd-century BC Hellenistic wall painting in Ptolemaic Egypt.

Lewis assigns the date of the invention of the horizontal-wheeled mill to the Greek colony of Byzantium in the first half of the 3rd century BC, and that of the vertical-wheeled mill to Ptolemaic Alexandria around 240 BC.

The Greek geographer Strabo reports in his &quot;Geography&quot; a water-powered grain-mill to have existed near the palace of king Mithradates VI Eupator at Cabira, Asia Minor, before 71 BC.

The Roman engineer Vitruvius has the first technical description of a watermill, dated to 40/10 BC; the device is fitted with an undershot wheel and power is transmitted via a gearing mechanism. He also seems to indicate the existence of water-powered kneading machines.

The Greek epigrammatist Antipater of Thessalonica tells of an advanced overshot wheel mill around 20 BC/10 AD. He praised for its use in grinding grain and the reduction of human labour:

The Roman encyclopedist Pliny mentions in his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; of around 70 AD water-powered trip hammers operating in the greater part of Italy. There is evidence of a fulling mill in 73/74 AD in Antioch, Roman Syria.

The 2nd century AD multiple mill complex of Barbegal in southern France has been described as &quot;the greatest known concentration of mechanical power in the ancient world&quot;. It featured 16 overshot waterwheels to power an equal number of flour mills. The capacity of the mills has been estimated at 4.5 tons of flour per day, sufficient to supply enough bread for the 12,500 inhabitants occupying the town of Arelate at that time. A similar mill complex existed on the Janiculum hill, whose supply of flour for Rome&#x27;s population was judged by emperor Aurelian important enough to be included in the Aurelian walls in the late 3rd century.

A breastshot wheel mill dating to the late 2nd century AD was excavated at Les Martres-de-Veyre, France.

The 3rd century AD Hierapolis water-powered stone sawmill is the earliest known machine to incorporate the mechanism of a crank and connecting rod. Further sawmills, also powered by crank and connecting rod mechanisms, are archaeologically attested for the 6th century AD water-powered stone sawmills at Gerasa and Ephesus. Literary references to water-powered marble saws in what is now Germany can be found in Ausonius 4th century AD poem Mosella. They also seem to be indicated about the same time by the Christian saint Gregory of Nyssa from Anatolia, demonstrating a diversified use of water-power in many parts of the Roman Empire.

The earliest turbine mill was found in Chemtou and Testour, Roman North Africa, dating to the late 3rd or early 4th century AD. A possible water-powered furnace has been identified at Marseille, France.

Mills were commonly used for grinding grain into flour (attested by Pliny the Elder), but industrial uses as fulling and sawing marble were also applied.

The Romans used both fixed and floating water wheels and introduced water power to other provinces of the Roman Empire. So-called &#x27;Greek Mills&#x27; used water wheels with a horizontal wheel (and vertical shaft). A &quot;Roman Mill&quot; features a vertical wheel (on a horizontal shaft). Greek style mills are the older and simpler of the two designs, but only operate well with high water velocities and with small diameter millstones. Roman style mills are more complicated as they require gears to transmit the power from a shaft with a horizontal axis to one with a vertical axis.

Although to date only a few dozen Roman mills are archaeologically traced, the widespread use of aqueducts in the period suggests that many remain to be discovered. Recent excavations in Roman London, for example, have uncovered what appears to be a tide mill together with a possible sequence of mills worked by an aqueduct running along the side of the River Fleet.

In 537 AD, ship mills were ingeniously used by the East Roman general Belisarius, when the besieging Goths cut off the water supply for those mills. These floating mills had a wheel that was attached to a boat moored in a fast flowing river.

==== Middle Ages ====


The surviving evidence for watermills sharply increases with the emergence of documentary genres such as monastic charters, Christian hagiography and Germanic legal codes. These were more inclined to address watermilling, a mostly rural work process, than the ancient urban-centered literary class had been. By Carolingian times, references to watermills had become &quot;innumerable&quot; in Frankish records. The Domesday Book, compiled in 1086, records 5,624 watermills in England alone. Later research estimates a less conservative number of 6,082 that should be considered a minimum as the northern reaches of England were never properly recorded. In 1300, this number had risen to between 10,000 and 15,000. By the early 7th century, watermills were also well established in Ireland. A century later they began to spread across the former Roman Rhine and Danube frontier into the other parts of Germany. Ship mills and tide mills, both of which yet unattested for the ancient period, were introduced in the 6th century.

; Tide mills

In recent years, a number of new archaeological finds has consecutively pushed back the date of the earliest tide mills, all of which were discovered on the Irish coast: A 6th century vertical-wheeled tide mill was located at Killoteran near Waterford. A twin flume horizontal-wheeled tide mill dating to c. 630 was excavated on Little Island. Alongside it, another tide mill was found which was powered by a vertical undershot wheel. The Nendrum Monastery mill from 787 was situated on an island in Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland. Its millstones are 830 mm in diameter and the horizontal wheel is estimated to have developed at its peak. Remains of an earlier mill dated at 619 were also found at the site.

; Survey of industrial mills

In a 2005 survey the scholar Adam Lucas identified the following first appearances of various industrial mill types in Western Europe. Noticeable is the preeminent role of France in the introduction of new innovative uses of waterpower. However, he has drawn attention to the dearth of studies of the subject in several other countries.

===Ancient East Asia===
The waterwheel was found in China from 30 AD onwards, when it was used to power trip hammers, the bellows in smelting iron, and in one case, to mechanically rotate an armillary sphere for astronomical observation (see Zhang Heng). Although the British chemist and sinologist Joseph Needham speculates that the water-powered millstone could have existed in Han China by the 1st century AD, there is no sufficient literary evidence for it until the 5th century AD. In 488 AD, the mathematician and engineer Zu Chongzhi had a watermill erected which was inspected by Emperor Wu of Southern Qi (r. 482–493 AD). The engineer Yang Su of the Sui dynasty (581–618 AD) was said to operate hundreds of them by the beginning of the 6th century. A source written in 612 AD mentions Buddhist monks arguing over the revenues gained from watermills. The Tang dynasty (618–907 AD) &#x27;Ordinances of the Department of Waterways&#x27; written in 737 AD stated that watermills should not interrupt riverine transport and in some cases were restricted to use in certain seasons of the year. From other Tang-era sources of the 8th century, it is known that these ordinances were taken very seriously, as the government demolished many watermills owned by great families, merchants, and Buddhist abbeys that failed to acknowledge ordinances or meet government regulations. A eunuch serving Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (r. 712–756 AD) owned a watermill by 748 AD which employed five waterwheels that ground 300 bushels of wheat a day. By 610 or 670 AD, the watermill was introduced to Japan via Korean Peninsula. It also became known in Tibet by at least 641 AD.

===Ancient India===
According to Greek historical tradition, India received water-mills from the Roman Empire in the early 4th century AD when a certain Metrodoros introduced &quot;water-mills and baths, unknown among them [the Brahmans] till then&quot;.

===Arabic world===
Engineers under the Caliphates adopted watermill technology from former provinces of the Byzantine Empire, having been applied for centuries in those provinces prior to the Muslim conquests, including modern-day Syria, Jordan, Israel, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, and Spain (see List of ancient watermills).

The industrial uses of watermills in the Islamic world date back to the 7th century, while horizontal-wheeled and vertical-wheeled watermills were both in widespread use by the 9th century. A variety of industrial watermills were used in the Islamic world, including gristmills, hullers, sawmills, ship mills, stamp mills, steel mills, sugar mills, and tide mills. By the 11th century, every province throughout the Islamic world had these industrial watermills in operation, from al-Andalus and North Africa to the Middle East and Central Asia. Muslim and Middle Eastern Christian engineers also used crankshafts and water turbines, gears in watermills and water-raising machines, and dams as a source of water, used to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines. Fulling mills, and steel mills may have spread from Al-Andalus to Christian Spain in the 12th century. Industrial watermills were also employed in large factory complexes built in al-Andalus between the 11th and 13th centuries.

The engineers of the Islamic world used several solutions to achieve the maximum output from a watermill. One solution was to mount them to piers of bridges to take advantage of the increased flow. Another solution was the ship mill, a type of watermill powered by water wheels mounted on the sides of ships moored in midstream. This technique was employed along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in 10th-century Iraq, where large ship mills made of teak and iron could produce 10 tons of flour from corn every day for the granary in Baghdad.

===Persia===
More than 300 watermills were at work in Iran till 1960. Now only a few are still working. One of the famous ones is the water mill of Askzar and the water mill of the Yazd city, still producing flour.

==Operation==


Typically, water is diverted from a river or impoundment or mill pond to a turbine or water wheel, along a channel or pipe (variously known as a flume, head race, mill race, leat, leet, lade (Scots) or penstock). The force of the water&#x27;s movement drives the blades of a wheel or turbine, which in turn rotates an axle that drives the mill&#x27;s other machinery. Water leaving the wheel or turbine is drained through a tail race, but this channel may also be the head race of yet another wheel, turbine or mill. The passage of water is controlled by sluice gates that allow maintenance and some measure of flood control; large mill complexes may have dozens of sluices controlling complicated interconnected races that feed multiple buildings and industrial processes.

Watermills can be divided into two kinds, one with a horizontal water wheel on a vertical axle, and the other with a vertical wheel on a horizontal axle. The oldest of these were horizontal mills in which the force of the water, striking a simple paddle wheel set horizontally in line with the flow turned a runner stone balanced on the rynd which is atop a shaft leading directly up from the wheel. The bedstone does not turn. The problem with this type of mill arose from the lack of gearing; the speed of the water directly set the maximum speed of the runner stone which, in turn, set the rate of milling.

Most watermills in Britain and the United States of America had a vertical waterwheel, one of four kinds: undershot, breast-shot, overshot and pitchback wheels. This vertical produced rotary motion around a horizontal axis, which could be used (with cams) to lift hammers in a forge, fulling stocks in a fulling mill and so on.

===Milling corn===
However, in corn mills rotation about a vertical axis was required to drive its stones. The horizontal rotation was converted into the vertical rotation by means of gearing, which also enabled the runner stones to turn faster than the waterwheel. The usual arrangement in British and American corn mills has been for the waterwheel to turn a horizontal shaft on which is also mounted a large pit wheel. This meshes with the wallower, mounted on a vertical shaft, which turns the (larger) great spur wheel (mounted on the same shaft). This large face wheel, set with pegs, in turn, turned a smaller wheel (such as a lantern gear) known as a stone nut, which was attached to the shaft that drove the runner stone. The number of runner stones that could be turned depended directly upon the supply of water available. As waterwheel technology improved mills became more efficient, and by the 19th century, it was common for the great spur wheel to drive several stone nuts, so that a single water wheel could drive as many as four stones. Each step in the process increased the gear ratio which increased the maximum speed of the runner stone. Adjusting the sluice gate and thus the flow of the water past the main wheel allowed the miller to compensate for seasonal variations in the water supply. Finer speed adjustment was made during the milling process by &quot;tentering&quot;, that is, adjusting the gap between the stones according to the water flow, the type of grain being milled, and the grade of flour required.

In many mills (including the earliest) the great spur wheel turned only one stone, but there might be several mills under one roof. The earliest illustration of a single waterwheel driving more than one set of stones was drawn by Henry Beighton in 1723 and published in 1744 by J. T. Desaguliers.

===Overshot and pitchback mills===
The overshot wheel was a later innovation in waterwheels and was around two and a half times more efficient than the undershot. The undershot wheel, in which the main water wheel is simply set into the flow of the mill race, suffers from an inherent inefficiency stemming from the fact that the wheel itself, entering the water behind the main thrust of the flow driving the wheel, followed by the lift of the wheel out of the water ahead of the main thrust, actually impedes its own operation. The overshot wheel solves this problem by bringing the water flow to the top of the wheel. The water fills buckets built into the wheel, rather than the simple paddle wheel design of undershot wheels. As the buckets fill, the weight of the water starts to turn the wheel. The water spills out of the bucket on the down side into a spillway leading back to river. Since the wheel itself is set above the spillway, the water never impedes the speed of the wheel. The impulse of the water on the wheel is also harnessed in addition to the weight of the water once in the buckets. Overshot wheels require the construction of a dam on the river above the mill and a more elaborate millpond, sluice gate, mill race and spillway or tailrace.

An inherent problem in the overshot mill is that it reverses the rotation of the wheel. If a miller wishes to convert a breastshot mill to an overshot wheel all the machinery in the mill has to be rebuilt to take account of the change in rotation. An alternative solution was the pitchback or backshot wheel. A launder was placed at the end of the flume on the headrace, this turned the direction of the water without much loss of energy, and the direction of rotation was maintained. Daniels Mill near Bewdley, Worcestershire is an example of a flour mill that originally used a breastshot wheel, but was converted to use a pitchback wheel. Today it operates as a breastshot mill.
Larger water wheels (usually overshot steel wheels) transmit the power from a toothed annular ring that is mounted near the outer edge of the wheel. This drives the machinery using a spur gear mounted on a shaft rather than taking power from the central axle. However, the basic mode of operation remains the same; gravity drives machinery through the motion of flowing water.

Toward the end of the 19th century, the invention of the Pelton wheel encouraged some mill owners to replace over- and undershot wheels with Pelton wheel turbines driven through penstocks.

=== Tide mills ===

A different type of watermill is the tide mill. This mill might be of any kind, undershot, overshot or horizontal but it does not employ a river for its power source. Instead a mole or causeway is built across the mouth of a small bay. At low tide, gates in the mole are opened allowing the bay to fill with the incoming tide. At high tide the gates are closed, trapping the water inside. At a certain point a sluice gate in the mole can be opened allowing the draining water to drive a mill wheel or wheels. This is particularly effective in places where the tidal differential is very great, such as the Bay of Fundy in Canada where the tides can rise fifty feet, or the now derelict village of Tide Mills, East Sussex. The last two examples in the United Kingdom which are restored to working conditions can be visited at Eling, Hampshire and at Woodbridge, Suffolk.

&quot;Run of the river&quot; schemes do not divert water at all and usually involve undershot wheels the mills are mostly on the banks of sizeable rivers or fast flowing streams. Other watermills were set beneath large bridges where the flow of water between the stanchions was faster. At one point London bridge had so many water wheels beneath it that bargemen complained that passage through the bridge was impaired. 

==Current status==
In 1870 watermills still produced 2/3 of the power available for British grain milling. By the early 20th century, availability of cheap electrical energy made the watermill obsolete in developed countries although some smaller rural mills continued to operate commercially later throughout the century.

A few historic mills such as the Water Mill, Newlin Mill and Yates Mill in the US and The Darley Mill Centre in the UK still operate for demonstration purposes. Small-scale commercial production is carried out in the UK at Daniels Mill, Little Salkeld Mill and Redbournbury Mill. This was boosted to overcome flour shortages during the Covid pandemic.

Some old mills are being upgraded with modern hydropower technology, such as those worked on by the South Somerset Hydropower Group in the UK.

In some developing countries, watermills are still widely used for processing grain. For example, there are thought to be 25,000 operating in Nepal, and 200,000 in India. Many of these are still of the traditional style, but some have been upgraded by replacing wooden parts with better-designed metal ones to improve the efficiency. For example, the Centre for Rural Technology in Nepal upgraded 2,400 mills between 2003 and 2007.

==Applications==
* Bark mills ground bark, from oak or chestnut trees to produce a coarse powder for use in tanneries.
* Blade mills were used for sharpening newly made blades.
* Blast furnaces, finery forges, and tinplate works were, until the introduction of the steam engine, almost invariably water powered. Furnaces and Forges were sometimes called iron mills.
* Bobbin mills made wooden bobbins for the cotton and other textile industries.
* Carpet mills for making carpets and rugs were sometimes water-powered.
* Cotton mills were driven by water. The power was used to card the raw cotton, and then to drive the spinning mules and ring frames. Steam engines were initially used to increase the water flow to the wheel, then as the Industrial Revolution progressed, to directly drive the shafts.
* Fulling or &quot;walk&quot; mills were used for a finishing process on woollen cloth.
* Gristmills, or &quot;corn mills&quot;, grind grains into flour. 
* Lead was usually smelted in smeltmills prior to the introduction of the cupola (a reverberatory furnace).
* Needle mills for scouring needles during manufacture were mostly water-powered (such as Forge Mill Needle Museum)
* Oil mills for crushing oil seeds might be wind or water-powered
* Paper mills used water not only for motive power, but also required it in large quantities in the manufacturing process.
* Powder mills for making gunpowder - black powder or smokeless powder were usually water-powered.
* Rolling mills shaped metal by passing it between rollers.
* Sawmills cut timber into lumber.
* Slitting mills were used for slitting bars of iron into rods, which were then made into nails.
* Spoke mills turned lumber into spokes for carriage wheels.
* Stamp mills for crushing ore, usually from non-ferrous mines
* Textile mills for spinning yarn or weaving cloth were sometimes water-powered.

<text>Reuben or [[Reuven (name)|Reuven]] is a Biblical male first name from Hebrew רְאוּבֵן (Re&#x27;uven), meaning &quot;behold, a son&quot;. In the Bible, Reuben was the firstborn son of Jacob.

Variants include Reuvein in Yiddish or as an English variant spelling on the Hebrew original; Rúben in European Portuguese; Rubens in Brazilian Portuguese; Rubén in Spanish; Rubèn in Catalan; Ruben in Dutch, German, French, Italian, Indonesian, Polish, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, and Armenian; and [[Rupen (disambiguation)|Rupen]]/[[Roupen]] in Western Armenian.

The form Ruben can also be a form of the name Robin, itself a variation of the Germanic name Robert, in several Celtic languages. It preserves the &quot;u&quot; sound from the name&#x27;s first component &quot;hruod&quot; (compare Ruairí, the Irish form of Roderick).

<text>The mercury-in-glass or mercury thermometer is a thermometer that uses the thermal expansion and contraction of liquid mercury to indicate the temperature.

==Construction==
A basic mercury thermometer is a precisely crafted piece of tube-shaped glass enveloping a mercury-filled reservoir connected to an extremely thin channel, called the capillary bore, that provides a chamber the mercury from the reservoir can expand into. The shorter, bulbous end of the tube containing the reservoir is called the bulb and the longer, narrower end with the bore is called the stem. Etched into the stem or on a carefully aligned plate next to it is a graduated temperature scale. Lower temperatures are near the bulb and higher temperatures near the top of the stem. The space above the mercury may be filled with nitrogen gas or it may be at less than atmospheric pressure, a partial vacuum.

==Theory of operation==
As the temperature of the surrounding environment changes, the mercury thermally expands and contracts, causing it to move out of, or into, the reservoir and, at the same time, rise or fall through the bore. Although changes to the mercury&#x27;s volume are slightabout .018% for each degree Celsiusthe small volume of the bore compared to the bulb&#x27;s volume visually amplifies the change. This design feature results in clearly visible movement of the mercury up or down the scale, enabling precise temperature readings.

==Calibration==
In order to calibrate the thermometer, the bulb is made to reach thermal equilibrium with a temperature standard such as an ice/water mixture, and then with another standard such as water/vapour, and the tube is divided into regular intervals between the fixed points. In principle, thermometers made of different material (e.g., coloured alcohol thermometers) might be expected to give different intermediate readings due to different expansion properties; in practice the substances used are chosen to have reasonably linear expansion characteristics as a function of thermodynamic temperature, and so give similar results.

==History==
The earliest documented use of mercury in a thermometer stretches as far back to perhaps the 1620s when the Jesuit scholar, Athanasius Kircher, used quicksilver for his air thermometer, the precursor to in-glass thermometers. Later, in the 1650s, failed experiments were run to determine if mercury might be a superior substitute for spirits in an enclosed glass thermometer. In 1659, the astronomer Ismael Boulliau abandoned using mercury when he determined that it was not as responsive to changes in temperature as spirits.

In 1713, Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit began experimenting with mercury thermometers. By 1717, he was making them commercially. The superiority of his mercury thermometers over alcohol-based thermometers made them very popular, leading to the widespread adoption of his Fahrenheit scale, the measurement system he developed and used for his thermometers.

Anders Celsius, a Swedish scientist, devised the Celsius scale, which was described in his publication &quot;The origin of the Celsius temperature scale&quot; in 1742.

To define his scale Celsius used two fixed temperature points: the temperature of melting ice and the temperature of boiling water, both under atmospheric pressure of the standard atmosphere. This was not a new idea, since Isaac Newton was already working on something similar. The distinction of Celsius was to use the condition of melting and not that of freezing. The experiments for reaching a good calibration of his thermometer lasted for 2 winters. By performing the same experiment over and over again, he discovered that ice always melted at the same calibration mark on the thermometer. He found a similar fixed point in the calibration of boiling water to water vapour (when this is done to high precision, a variation will be seen with atmospheric pressure; Celsius noted this). At the moment that he removed the thermometer from the vapour, the mercury level climbed slightly. This was related to the rapid cooling (and contraction) of the glass.

When Celsius decided to use his own temperature scale, he originally defined his scale &quot;upside-down&quot;, that is he chose to set the boiling point of pure water at 0 °C (212 °F) and the freezing point at 100 °C (32 °F). One year later, Frenchman Jean-Pierre Christin proposed to invert the scale with the freezing point at and the boiling point at . He named it centigrade (100 steps).

Finally, Celsius proposed a method of calibrating a thermometer:
# Place the cylinder of the thermometer in melting ice made of pure water and mark the point where the fluid in the thermometer stabilises. This point is the freeze/thaw point of water.
# In the same manner mark the point where the fluid stabilises when the thermometer is placed in boiling water vapour.
# Divide the length between the two marks into 100 equal parts.

These points are adequate for approximate calibration, but both the freezing and boiling points of water vary with atmospheric pressure. Later thermometers that used a liquid other than mercury also gave slightly different temperature readings. In practice, these variations were very slight and remained close to the thermodynamic temperature, once the latter was discovered. These issues were explored experimentally with the gas thermometer. Until the discovery of true thermodynamic temperature, the mercury thermometer usually &quot;defined&quot; the temperature.

Modern thermometers are often calibrated using the triple point of water instead of the freezing point; the triple point occurs at 273.16 kelvins (K), 0.01 °C.

==Maximum thermometer==
One special kind of mercury-in-glass thermometer, called a maximum thermometer, works by having a constriction in the neck close to the bulb. As the temperature rises, the mercury is pushed up through the constriction by the force of expansion. When the temperature falls, the column of mercury breaks at the constriction and cannot return to the bulb, thus remaining stationary in the tube. The observer can then read the maximum temperature over the set period of time. To reset the thermometer it must be swung sharply. This design is used in the traditional type of medical thermometer.

==Maximum minimum thermometer==
A maximum minimum thermometer, also known as Six&#x27;s thermometer, is a thermometer which registers the maximum and minimum temperatures reached over a period of time, typically 24 hours. The original design contains mercury, but solely as a way to indicate the position of a column of alcohol whose expansion indicates the temperature; it is not a thermometer operated by the expansion of mercury; mercury-free versions are available.

==Physical properties==
Mercury thermometers cover a wide temperature range from ; the instrument&#x27;s upper temperature range may be extended through the introduction of an inert gas such as nitrogen. This introduction of an inert gas increases the pressure on the liquid mercury and therefore its boiling point is increased, this in combination with replacing the Pyrex glass with fused quartz allows the upper temperature range to be extended to .

Mercury cannot be used below the temperature at which it becomes solid, . If the thermometer contains nitrogen, the gas may flow down into the column when the mercury solidifies and be trapped there when the temperature rises, making the thermometer unusable until returned to the factory for reconditioning. To avoid this, some weather services require that all mercury-in-glass thermometers be brought indoors when the temperature falls to .

To measure lower meteorological temperatures, a thermometer containing a mercury-thallium alloy which does not solidify until the temperature drops to may be used.

==Phase-out==

, many mercury-in-glass thermometers are used in meteorology; however, they are becoming increasingly rare for other uses, as many countries banned them for medical use due to the toxicity of mercury. Some manufacturers use galinstan, a liquid alloy of gallium, indium, and tin, as a replacement for mercury.

The typical &quot;fever thermometer&quot; contains between of elemental mercury. Swallowing this amount of mercury would pose little danger but the inhaling of the vapour could lead to health problems.

In February 2009, the Argentine Health Ministry instructed by resolution 139/09 that all health centres and hospitals should buy mercury-free thermometers and blood pressure meters and called on dentists, medical technicians, and environmental health specialists to start eliminating this toxin. , mercury thermometers were still on sale to the public at pharmacies.

====Austria====
There was a voluntary take-back action for thermometers containing mercury based on the Federal Waste Management Plan 2006, and carried out in close cooperation between the Austrian Chamber of Pharmacists (Österreichische Apothekerkammer), the Federal Ministry of Environment, a private waste disposer, a producer of electronic thermometers and a pharmaceutical distributor. The disposal company supplied each pharmacy (approximately 1,200) with a collection bin and covered the cost of disposal. The pharmaceutical distributor covered the logistical costs for the distribution of the thermometers. The pharmacies accepted a refund of only 0.50 Euro per thermometer for handling (which is far below their normal margin). The supplier provided the thermometers at a reduced price. The Federal Ministry supported each sold thermometer (covering about 30% of the direct costs) and advertised the project. During the collection period, consumers could bring in a mercury thermometer and buy an electronic thermometer for a subsidised price of 1 Euro. Between October 2007 and January 2008, about 465,000 electronic thermometers were sold and about one million mercury thermometers (together containing about 1 tonne of mercury) were collected.

====Philippines====
By the Philippines Department of Health’s Administrative Order 2008-0221, all mercury equipment from hospitals, including mercury-in-glass thermometers, was to be phased out in the Philippines by September 28, 2010. Even before the order was released, 50 hospitals had already banned mercury from their establishments. Among these fifty hospitals, the Philippine Heart Center was the first one to do so. San Juan de Dios Hospital, Philippine Children’s Medical Center, San Lazaro Hospital, Ospital ng Muntinlupa, Lung Center of the Philippines, the National Kidney and Transplant Institute, Manila Adventist Medical Center and Las Piñas Hospital also made steps to ban the toxic chemical. The country was the first one to make a step to ban mercury from its health care system in Southeast Asia and they used non-mercury digital thermometers instead.

====United Kingdom====
Since European Union directive 2007/51/EC came into force on 3 April 2009, the UK Health Protection Agency (HPA) reported that mercury thermometers could no longer be sold to the general public. Shops holding stocks of unsold thermometers had to withdraw them from sale; mercury thermometers purchased before this date could be used without legal implications. The purpose of these restrictions is to protect the environment and public health by decreasing the amount of mercury waste released. The HPA had, in 2007, released a guide to dealing with small spills of mercury.

Despite the phasing-out of mercury thermometers in the United Kingdom, British media continues to refer to temperature measurements, especially for weather forecasts, as &quot;the mercury&quot;.

====United States====
In the United States, both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the United States Environmental Protection Agency recommend that alternative thermometers be used in the home.

<doc id="150246" wikidata="Q1324198" url="?curid=150246" title="Treaty of Ghent">
<text>The Treaty of Ghent () was the peace treaty that ended the War of 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom. It took effect in February 1815. Both sides signed it on December 24, 1814, in the city of Ghent, United Netherlands (now in Belgium). The treaty restored relations between the two parties to &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot; by restoring the pre-war borders of June 1812. Both sides were eager to end the war. It ended when the treaty arrived in Washington and was immediately ratified unanimously by the United States Senate and exchanged with British officials the next day. 

The treaty was approved by the British Parliament and signed into law by the Prince Regent (the future King George IV) on December 30, 1814. It took a month for news of the treaty to reach the United States, during which American forces under Andrew Jackson won the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815. U.S. President James Madison signed the treaty and exchanged final ratified copies with the British ambassador on February 17, 1815.

The treaty began more than two centuries of peaceful relations between the United States and the United Kingdom despite a few tense moments, such as the Aroostook War in 1838–39, the Pig War in 1859, and the Trent Affair in 1861.

==Background==
In late 1813, emperor Alexander I of Russia offered to mediate peace negotiations between the British and Americans at Saint Petersburg, but the British rejected Russian mediation and never sent a delegation. A new arrangement was made in early January 1814 to hold direct peace talks at Gothenburg in Sweden, yet the British again failed to show up for several months.

After the abdication of Napoleon in April 1814, British public opinion demanded major gains in the war against the United States. The senior American representative in London, Reuben Beasley, told US Secretary of State James Monroe:

However, the prime minister, Lord Liverpool, aware of growing opposition to wartime taxation and the demands of merchants in Liverpool and Bristol to reopen trade with America, realized that Britain had little to gain and much to lose from prolonged warfare.

After rejecting American proposals to broker peace negotiations, Britain reversed course in mid-1814. With the defeat of Napoleon in March–April 1814, the main British goals of stopping American trade with France and impressment of sailors from American ships were dead letters. President Madison informed Congress that the United States could no longer demand an end to impressment from the British, and he formally dropped the demand from the peace process. 

A meeting between the negotiators eventually took place in late June 1814, where it was decided to move the site of peace talks to Ghent in the Southern Netherlands. The Americans sent five commissioners: John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, James A. Bayard, Sr., Jonathan Russell, and Albert Gallatin. All were senior political leaders except Russell; Adams was in charge. The British sent minor officials, who kept in close touch with their superiors in London. The British commissioners Gambier, Goulburn, Adams and Baker arrived in Ghent on 6 and 7 August 1814, and the first formal meeting with the American plenipotentiaries began on 8 August 1814 at 1 p.m. The British government&#x27;s main diplomatic focus in 1814 was not ending the war in North America, but the European balance of power after the apparent defeat of Napoleonic France and the return to power in Paris of the pro-British Bourbons.

==Negotiations==
At last on 8 August 1814, peace discussions began in neutral Ghent. As the peace talks opened, American diplomats decided not to present President Madison&#x27;s demands for the end of impressment and his suggestion for Britain to turn Canada over to the United States. They were quiet, and so the British instead opened with their demands, the most important of which was the creation of an Indigenous state in the former Canadian southwest territory (the area from Ohio to Wisconsin). It was understood that the British would sponsor the Indigenous state. For decades, the British strategy had been to create a buffer state to block American expansion. The Americans refused to consider a buffer state or to include Indigenous nations directly in the treaty in any fashion. Henry Goulburn, a British negotiator who took part in the treaty negotiations, remarked after meeting with American negotiators that &quot;I had, till I came here, had no idea of the fixed determination which prevails in the breast of every American to extirpate the Indians and appropriate their territory.&quot; Adams argued that there was no precedent for including allied Indigenous nations in bilateral peace treaties and to do so would in effect mean the United States was abandoning its sovereign claims over Indigenous territories, especially under a foreign protectorate like Britain. In doing so, Adams articulated a strong imperial claim of sovereignty over all peoples living within the boundaries of the United States. The British negotiators presented the barrier state as a &quot;sine qua non&quot; for peace, and the impasse brought negotiations to the brink of breakdown. In the end, the British government backed down and accepted Article IX, in which both governments promised to make peace with their indigenous foes and to restore Indigenous nations to &quot;all possessions, rights and privileges which they may have enjoyed, or been entitled to in 1811.&quot;

The British, assuming their planned invasion of New York State would go well, also demanded that Americans not keep any naval forces on the Great Lakes and that the British have certain transit rights to the Mississippi River in exchange for continuation of American fishing rights off of Newfoundland. The United States rejected the demands, and there was an impasse. American public opinion was so outraged when Madison published the demands that even the Federalists were willing to fight on.

During the negotiations, the British had four invasions underway. One force carried out a burning of Washington, but the main mission failed in its goal of capturing Baltimore. The British fleet sailed away when the army commander was killed. A small force invaded the District of Maine from New Brunswick, capturing parts of northeastern Maine and several smuggling towns on the seacoast and re-established the New Ireland colony with the ultimate purpose of incorporating Maine into Canada. Much more important were two major invasions. In northern New York State, 10,000 British troops marched south to cut off New England until a decisive defeat at the Battle of Plattsburgh forced them back to Canada. Nothing was known at the time of the fate of the other major invasion force that had been sent to capture New Orleans and control the Mississippi River.

The British prime minister, Lord Liverpool, wanted the Duke of Wellington to go to command in Canada with the assignment of winning the war. Wellington replied that he would go to America but believed that he was needed in Europe. He also stated:

The government had no choice but to agree with Wellington. Lord Liverpool informed the Foreign Secretary, Lord Castlereagh, who was at Vienna: &quot;I think we have determined, if all other points can be satisfactorily settled, not to continue the war for the purpose of obtaining or securing any acquisition of territory.&quot; Liverpool cited several reasons, especially the unsatisfactory negotiations underway at Vienna, the alarming reports from France that it might resume the war, and the weak financial condition of the government. He did not need to tell Castlereagh that the war was very unpopular and that Britons wanted peace and a return to normal trade. The war with America had ruined many reputations and promised no gain.

After months of negotiations, against the background of changing military victories, defeats, and losses, the parties finally realized that their nations wanted peace and that there was no real reason to continue the war. Each side was tired of the war since export trade was all but paralyzed, and after the fall of Napoleon in 1814, France was no longer an enemy of Britain and so the Royal Navy no longer needed to stop American shipments to France or more seamen. The British were preoccupied in rebuilding Europe after the apparent final defeat of Napoleon. Liverpool told British negotiators to offer a status quo. That was what the British government had desired since the start of the war and was offered by British diplomats immediately to the US negotiators, who dropped demands for an end to British maritime practices and Canadian territory, ignored their war aims, and agreed to the terms. Both sides would exchange prisoners, and Britain would return all slaves that they had freed from their American enslavers or offer financial compensation instead.

==Agreement==
On December 24, 1814, the members of the British and American negotiating teams signed and affixed their individual seals to the document. That did not itself end the war, which required formal ratification of the treaty by both governments, which came in February 1815.

The treaty released all prisoners and restored all captured lands and ships between the United States and Britain (Mobile and Spanish West Florida territory west of the Perdido River were not returned to Spain, who allied with Britain and the Red Stick faction of the Muscogee in the War of 1812, by the United States). Returned to the United States were approximately of territory near lakes Superior and Michigan and in Maine. American-held areas of Upper Canada (now Ontario) were returned to British control, but the Americans only returned Pensacola to Spanish Florida. All of Spanish West Florida west of the Perdido River, including the important port of Mobile, was occupied by the Americans in 1813, but the Treaty of Ghent did not force the Americans to leave this section of West Florida. The treaty made no changes to the prewar boundaries on the U.S.-Canada border.

The British promised to return all freed slaves that they had liberated during the war back to the United States. However, in 1826, Britain instead paid the U.S. government US$1,204,960 () to compensate American slaveholders. Both nations also promised to work towards the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade.

The negotiations in Ghent were concluded in 1814, in anticipation that the two governments would pursue further discussions in 1815 to frame a new commercial agreement between the United States and the British Empire.

Pierre Berton wrote of the treaty:
It was as if no war had been fought, or to put it more bluntly, as if the war that was fought was fought for no good reason. For nothing has changed; everything is as it was at the beginning save for the graves of those who, it now appears, have fought for a trifle [...]. Lake Erie and Fort McHenry will go into the American history books, Queenston Heights and Crysler&#x27;s Farm into the Canadian, but without the gore, the stench, the disease, the terror, the conniving, and the imbecilities that march with every army.

==Aftermath==
In the century of peace between both countries that followed from 1815 to World War I, several more territorial and diplomatic disputes arose, but all were resolved peacefully, sometimes by arbitration.

The course of the war resolved and resolved one major original issue for the Americans. Most Indigenous nations had allied with the British but had been defeated, allowing the United States to continue its expansion westward. On the other hand Britain maintained their maritime rights with no mention of impressment in the treaty, a key victory for them.

James Carr argues that Britain negotiated the Treaty of Ghent with the goal of ending the war but knew that a major British expedition had been ordered to seize New Orleans. Carr says that Britain had no intention of repudiating the treaty and continuing the war if it had won the battle. 

News of the treaty finally reached the United States soon after it had won a major victory in the Battle of New Orleans, and the treaty won immediate wide approval from all sides. The British learned of the treaty when arrived off Fort Bowyer on February 13, carrying news that the Treaty of Ghent had been signed on the previous Christmas Eve.

The US Senate unanimously approved the treaty on February 16, 1815, and President Madison exchanged ratification papers with a British diplomat in Washington on February 17. The treaty was proclaimed on February 18.

== Memorials ==
The Peace Arch, dedicated in September 1921, stands tall at the Douglas–Blaine border crossing between the province of British Columbia and the state of Washington. The monument represents a perpetually open gate across the Canada–U.S. boundary.
In 1922, the &quot;Fountain of Time&quot; was dedicated in Washington Park, Chicago, commemorating 110 years of peace between the United States and Britain. The Peace Bridge between Buffalo, New York, and Fort Erie, Ontario, opened in 1927 to commemorate more than a century of peace between the United States and Canada.

Perry&#x27;s Victory and International Peace Memorial (1936) commemorates the Battle of Lake Erie that took place near Ohio&#x27;s South Bass Island, in which Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry led a fleet to victory in one of the most significant naval battles to occur in the War of 1812. Located on an isthmus on the island, the memorial also celebrates the lasting peace between Britain, Canada, and the United States that followed the war.

<doc id="150247" wikidata="Q64116" url="?curid=150247" title="High Wycombe">
<text>High Wycombe, often referred to as Wycombe ( ), is a market town in Buckinghamshire, England. Lying in the valley of the River Wye surrounded by the Chiltern Hills, it is west-northwest of Charing Cross in London, south-southeast of Aylesbury, southeast of Oxford, northeast of Reading and north of Maidenhead.

According to the 2021 United Kingdom census, High Wycombe&#x27;s built up area has a population of 127,856, making it the largest town in the ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire. The High Wycombe Urban Area, the conurbation of which the town is the largest component, has a population of 140,684. Part of the urban area constitutes the civil parish of Chepping Wycombe, which had a population of 14,455 according to the 2001 census – this parish represents that part of the ancient parish of Chepping Wycombe which was outside the former municipal borough of Wycombe. There has been a market held in the High Street since at least the Middle Ages. The market is currently held on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday.

==History==
===Early history===

The town once featured a Roman villa (built 150–170 AD) which has been excavated four times, most recently in 2002. Mosaics and a bathhouse were unearthed at the site on what is now the Rye parkland. The name Wycombe would appear to come from the river Wye and the old English word for a wooded valley, &quot;combe&quot;, but according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary of Place-Names&quot; the name, which was first recorded in 799–802 as &quot;Wichama&quot;, is more likely to be Old English &quot;wic&quot; and the plural of Old English &quot;ham&quot;, and probably means &quot;dwellings&quot;; the name of the river was a late back-formation. Wycombe appears in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 and was noted for having six mills.

The existence of a settlement at High Wycombe was first documented as &#x27;Wicumun&#x27; in 970. The parish church was consecrated by Wulfstan, the visiting Bishop of Worcester, in 1086. The town was described as a borough from at least the 1180s, and built its first moot hall in 1226, with a market hall being built later in 1476.

The 1841 census reports the population that year was 3,184.

===Trade and industrial development===
High Wycombe remained a mill town through Medieval and Tudor times, manufacturing lace and linen cloth. It was also a stopping point on the way from Oxford to London, with many travellers staying in the town&#x27;s taverns and inns.

The paper industry was notable in 17th and 18th century High Wycombe. The Wye&#x27;s waters were rich in chalk, and therefore ideal for bleaching pulp. The paper industry was soon overtaken by the cloth industry.

Wycombe&#x27;s most famous industry, furniture (particularly Windsor chairs) took hold in the 19th century, with furniture factories setting up all over the town. Many terraced workers&#x27; houses were built to the east and west of town to accommodate those working in the furniture factories. In 1875, it was estimated that there were 4,700 chairs made per day in High Wycombe. When Queen Victoria visited the town in 1877, the council organised an arch of chairs to be erected over the High Street, with the words &quot;Long live the Queen&quot; printed boldly across the arch for the Queen to pass under. Wycombe Museum includes many examples of locally made chairs and information on the local furniture and lace industries.

The town&#x27;s population grew from 13,000 residents in 1881 to 29,000 in 1928. Wycombe was completely dominated socially and economically by the furniture industry.

===20th century===

By the 1920s, many of the housing areas of Wycombe had decayed into slums. A slum clearance scheme was initiated by the council in 1932, whereby many areas were completely demolished and the residents rehoused in new estates that sprawled above the town on the valley slopes. Some of the districts demolished were truly decrepit, such as Newland, where most of the houses were condemned as unfit for human habitation. However, some areas such as St. Mary&#x27;s Street contained beautiful old buildings with fine examples of 18th and 19th century architecture.
From 1940 to 1968 High Wycombe was the seat of the RAF Bomber Command. Moreover, during the Second World War, from May 1942 to July 1945, the U.S. Army Air Force&#x27;s 8th Air Force Bomber Command, codenamed &quot;Pinetree&quot;, was based at a former girls&#x27; school at High Wycombe. This formally became Headquarters, 8th Air Force, on 22 February 1944.
In the 1960s the town centre was redeveloped and many old buildings were demolished. The River Wye was culverted under concrete between 1965 and 1967 from and demolishing most of the old buildings in Wycombe&#x27;s town centre. Two shopping centres were built (the Octagon in 1970 and the Chilterns&#x27; in the 1980s) along with many new multi-storey car parks, office blocks, flyovers and roundabouts.

==Modern-day High Wycombe==
High Wycombe comprises a number of suburbs including Booker, Bowerdean, Castlefield, Cressex, Daws Hill, Green Street, Holmers Farm, Micklefield, Sands, Terriers, Totteridge, Downley and Wycombe Marsh, as well as some nearby villages: Hazlemere and Tylers Green. Particular areas in the suburbs of Castlefield, Micklefield, Terriers and Totteridge have high levels of deprivation compared to the rest of the urban area.

Although situated in the county of Buckinghamshire, which is one of the most affluent parts of the country, Wycombe contains some considerably deprived areas. In 2007, a GMB Union survey ranked the Wycombe district as the 4th dirtiest in the South East and the 26th dirtiest in the whole UK. The survey found litter on 28.5% of streets and highways. Data for the survey were taken from the Government&#x27;s 2005/06 Audit Commission.

The town has undergone major redevelopment, including development of the town&#x27;s existing shopping centre, completion of the Eden Shopping centre, and redevelopment of the Buckinghamshire New University with a large student village and new building on Queen Alexandra Road.

These developments prompted the building of larger blocks of flats, a multimillion-pound hotel in the centre, and a Sainsbury&#x27;s store on the Oxford road next to the Eden shopping centre and bus station.

==Climate==
==Demography==

High Wycombe&#x27;s population figure differs with the varying definitions of the town&#x27;s area. That of the town not including its suburbs was 77,178. However, Hazlemere is now regarded as part of Wycombe, which makes the population of High Wycombe town 92,300. The High Wycombe urban area (the town with some surrounding settlements) had a population of 133,204. This is an increase of 13% since the 2001 population of 118,229.

Notes:
According to the 2011 census, the parliamentary constituency of Wycombe consists of approximately 108,000 people. White British people comprised 67.2% of the constituency&#x27;s population. The next largest group in the constituency were Pakistanis, who comprised 11.8% of the population. 52.3% of the population were Christians, 24% were no religion and 13.4% were Muslim. Wycombe is home to the largest population of Vincentians in the United Kingdom.

65.7% of the constituency owned their own home either outright or with a mortgage. 14.6% were social renters and 17% were private renters. 15.8% of households in the constituency did not own an automobile.

==Governance==
===Parliamentary constituency===
Wycombe&#x27;s political history extends back to 1295. The Wycombe Constituency had continuously elected Conservative Members of Parliament since 1951 until the Labour Party was voted in during the May 2024 general election. 

High Wycombe has been home to two Prime Ministers:

* William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne, who lived at what is now Wycombe Abbey and was MP for the town.
* Benjamin Disraeli, who lived at nearby Hughenden Manor, was defeated as a Radical candidate for the seat three times in the 1830s but won election in 1868 and 1874–1876 as a Conservative. Disraeli made his first political speech in Wycombe, from the portico over the door of the Red Lion Hotel at 9–10 High Street.

High Wycombe was also in the constituency represented by John Hampden (1594-1643), a leading MP and Parliamentarian commander who was killed in action during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms.

The town is represented by Labour MP Emma Reynolds.

The town until the 4th July 2024 General Election was represented by Conservative MP Steve Baker. He was chairman of the eurosceptic European Research Group and was a junior minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union from 2017 to 2018. In July 2018, Baker resigned alongside Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in opposition to the Chequers plan proposed by Prime Minister Theresa May.

===Local government===

Since 2020, there has only been one tier of local government covering High Wycombe, being the unitary authority of Buckinghamshire Council. The former High Wycombe Borough Council was abolished in 1974. Instead of a town council, the councillors elected to Buckinghamshire Council to represent the unparished part of High Wycombe also act as charter trustees, meeting to choose the town&#x27;s mayor.

The ancient parish of Chepping Wycombe covered both the town of High Wycombe and a large rural area around it. To distinguish it from the neighbouring parish of West Wycombe, the parish was historically known variously as East Wycombe, Great Wycombe, High Wycombe, Much Wiccomb, Chipping, Chipping Wycombe, or Chepping Wycombe. The latter version eventually became the official name of parish, despite the town itself being more usually known as High Wycombe. The town does not appear to have been a borough at the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, but was being described as a borough by the 1180s. In the 1220s and 1230s there were disputes with the lord of the manor, Alan Basset, as to the extent of the town&#x27;s independence. These disputes were settled in favour of the town, with its borough rights being confirmed in 1237. Charters confirming the town&#x27;s borough status were subsequently issued on a number of occasions. As part of the general overhaul of ancient boroughs across the country under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, the town became a municipal borough on 1 January 1836, under the name of Chepping Wycombe.

The borough only covered the built-up area of the town, rather than the whole parish. The borough council was therefore responsible for the secular elements of local government within its area, whereas the Chepping Wycombe parish vestry was responsible for secular matters in the part of the parish outside the borough, whilst being responsible for ecclesiastical matters across the whole parish, including the borough. In 1866, under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1866, the old parish of Chepping Wycombe was split into two civil parishes: one called &quot;Wycombe&quot; or &quot;Wycombe Borough&quot; which covered the area of Chepping Wycombe municipal borough, and another parish which retained the name &quot;Chepping Wycombe&quot; which covered the rural parts of the old parish outside the borough.

By that time, the urban area was starting to expand beyond the old borough boundaries into the newly separated parish of Chepping Wycombe, particularly in the Wycombe Marsh area. To deal with growing urbanisation in its area, the parish of Chepping Wycombe was declared to be a local government district in 1868, governed by a local board. The situation was partially simplified in 1880 when the local board was abolished and the borough boundaries were extended to cover the more built-up parts of Chepping Wycombe parish. The parish boundaries were not changed at the same time to match, making the Chepping Wycombe Borough Council responsible for all of the Wycombe parish area and part of the Chepping Wycombe parish area.

When parish and district councils were established under the Local Government Act 1894, it was stipulated that parishes could not straddle district boundaries. The Chepping Wycombe parish was therefore split again in December 1894, with the part within the borough becoming &quot;Chepping Wycombe Urban&quot; and the part outside it becoming &quot;Chepping Wycombe Rural&quot;. Chepping Wycombe Rural was placed in the Wycombe Rural District, whilst the Chepping Wycombe Municipal Borough covered the two parishes of Wycombe and Chepping Wycombe Urban. The two parishes within the borough merged on 30 September 1896 to form a single parish called High Wycombe, although the official name of the borough council which governed that parish remained &quot;Chepping Wycombe Borough Council&quot; until 1 August 1946, when it changed its name to &quot;High Wycombe Borough Council&quot;. The surrounding Chepping Wycombe Rural parish changed its name to Chepping Wycombe parish in 1949.

From 1757 until 1932 the borough council met at the Guildhall. The council built Town Hall on Queen Victoria Road in 1904 as a public assembly hall and entertainment venue, with the intention of later extending it to also serve as council offices and meeting place, but the extension was never built. Instead, the council built the Municipal Offices on Queen Victoria Road in 1932, which then acted as its meeting place and offices until the council&#x27;s abolition in 1974.

From 1974 to 2020, High Wycombe formed part of Wycombe District, with its council being based at the former borough council&#x27;s Municipal Offices (renamed District Council Offices) on Queen Victoria Road. Following further local government reorganisation in 2020 Wycombe District was abolished to become part of Buckinghamshire Council.

===Weighing the mayor===
A ceremony carried out in the town since 1678 involves the weighing of the mayor. At the beginning and end of each year of service, the mayor is weighed in full view of the public to see whether or not he or she has gained weight, presumably at the taxpayers&#x27; expense. The custom, which has survived to the present day, employs the same weighing apparatus used since the 19th century. When the result is known, the town crier announces &quot;And no more!&quot; if the mayor has not gained weight or &quot;And some more!&quot; if they have. Their actual weight is not declared.

==Education==
Buckinghamshire is one of the few counties that still has a selective educational system based on the former tripartite system. Pupils in their last year at primary school take what is commonly known as the 11+ exam. Their score in this exam determines whether they are accepted into a grammar school or a secondary modern school.

===Further and higher education===

Buckinghamshire College Group is a further education college located near High Wycombe at Flackwell Heath, with campuses also at Aylesbury and Amersham.
High Wycombe is home to the main campus of Buckinghamshire New University. It is located in the centre of the town on the former site of the High Wycombe College of Art and Technology. It received its university charter in summer 2007.

==Media coverage==
High Wycombe has been featured in the national media in recent years for a number of different reasons, including seasonal coverage of the local library&#x27;s refusal to display a Christmas carol service poster and other stories such as the triple shooting of three young Asian men, a small-scale riot between feuding families and gangs in which knives, metal poles, and an axe were used whilst a gunman sprayed bullets; and the shooting and murder of Natasha Derby at point-blank range in the middle of a busy dance floor at a town centre venue.

The town appeared in national and international media after anti-terrorism raids were carried out across the town on 10 August 2006 as part of the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot. Five arrests were made at three different houses in the town&#x27;s Totteridge and Micklefield areas. A small number of houses in High Wycombe were evacuated in Walton Drive, which is thought to be because one of the raided houses contained dangerous liquid chemicals.

A no-flight zone over the town was ordered. Other raids and arrests were also made in East London and Birmingham.

King&#x27;s Wood to the north of the town was cordoned off for four months to be searched by police, and many suspicious items were allegedly found including explosives, detonators, weapons and hate tapes. Other woodlands in the Booker area of the town and the M40 at High Wycombe as well as nearby woods were also under observation. Explosives officers were called to the motorway, as were forensic officers. A lane of the motorway was closed as a precaution.

On 21 December 2009, heavy snowfall hit the town, paralysing its road network (which is mainly on steep hills), and causing major disruption to refuse services for several weeks. Staff and customers of the John Lewis department store were stranded overnight, leading to national news reports and interviews from GMTV and other radio stations on the morning of 22 December.

The town&#x27;s nearest motorway is the M40, which has two junctions serving Wycombe: junction 3 for Loudwater and High Wycombe (east) and junction 4 at Handy Cross roundabout for central Wycombe, Marlow and Maidenhead. Junction 4 is a major interchange between the M40 and A404 trunk road which provides a link to the M4. It had suffered from heavy congestion but was improved by the Highways Agency in 2006. Junction 3 is restricted; only traffic going towards and coming from London can join and exit respectively. The M25 and M4 are also fairly close.

Other roads include the A404 towards Marlow and Amersham; the A4010 towards Aylesbury; and the A40 towards Beaconsfield and Oxford.

===Bus===
High Wycombe Eden bus station is served by Redline Buses and Carousel Buses. Major destinations include Reading, Slough, Aylesbury, Heathrow Airport, Maidenhead, Amersham, Chesham, Uxbridge, Beaconsfield Gerrards Cross and Hemel Hempstead. In November 2013, First Berkshire &amp; The Thames Valley added express route X9 to Maidenhead to its existing X74 express to Slough. Other operators serving the town include Red Eagle, Red Rose and Z&amp;S Buses.

The town also has a Park and Ride facility located in Cressex, near junction 4 of the M40. Services run to the town centre, passing the railway station, High Wycombe Coachway which is served by coach services such as: the Airline, Harlequin Travel, Countryside Coaches and Apple Travel which go to places like Maidenhead, Oxford, Heathrow Airport, Gatwick Airport and Farnham 

===Coach===
As of January 2022, no National Express coaches have entered High Wycombe Town centre. The Airline, operated by Oxford Bus Company, operates coach services from Oxford to Heathrow and Gatwick airports via Handy Cross Hub.

===Rail===

The town is served by High Wycombe railway station on the Chiltern Main Line, with services operated by Chiltern Railways from London Marylebone to Aylesbury, Oxford, Stratford-upon-Avon, Birmingham Snow Hill and Kidderminster. The station is the busiest in South Buckinghamshire. Express services travel to London in 23 minutes, slower trains take up to 45 minutes.

The Wycombe Railway ran from High Wycombe to Maidenhead on the Great Western Main Line through Loudwater and Bourne End. However, it was a victim of the Beeching cuts with the Wycombe to Bourne End section closed in May 1970. The southern section remains open as part of the Marlow Branch Line.

===Air===
Heathrow Airport is the nearest international airport, located just outside Buckinghamshire in Hillingdon. Wycombe Air Park on the southern edge of the town is popular with learning pilots and gliders.

==Facilities and places of interest==

There are two shopping centres: the Eden Centre which spreads from the High Street under the Abbey Way flyover to the south of the A40; and the Chilterns Centre, which is located between Queen&#x27;s Square and Frogmoor to the north.
The High Street (pedestrianised in the early 1990s) has a number of 18th and 19th century buildings, and ends at the colonnaded Guildhall that was built in 1757 by Henry Keene, funded by the Earl of Shelburne, and renovated in 1859. The small octagonal-shaped Cornmarket opposite, known locally as the Pepper Pot, was rebuilt to designs by Robert Adam in 1761. The large parish church of All Saints was founded in 1086, enlarged in the 18th century and extensively restored in 1889. There is a large, well equipped theatre, the Wycombe Swan, which hosts many acts and shows before or after their appearance in the West End.

In April 2008, a new development of the town centre was completed. This included the demolition and movement of the bus station and the brand new &quot;Eden Shopping Centre&quot;, with 107 shops, new restaurants, a large bowling alley and cinema and new housing. The old Octagon shopping centre was connected to the new development. The complex, one of the largest in the country, is seen as a major milestone in the regeneration of the town.

To the east of the town centre is the extensive Rye park (and river) and dyke. The park had an outdoor swimming pool, which closed in 2009. The pool has now reopened together with a new gym and has been renamed as the Rye Lido. The River Wye winds through the green space, which is particularly attractive during the summer. Wycombe&#x27;s yearly &quot;Asian Mela&quot; takes place on the Rye. There is a museum on Priory Avenue in the town centre situated on its own grounds and including a Norman castle mound. The theme of the museum is the history of Wycombe, with the main focus being the chair industry.

Wycombe town centre is home to many public houses and bars, especially in the Frogmoor area. The White Horse pub appeared on &#x27;Britain&#x27;s toughest pubs&#x27;.

The town features the old Wycombe Summit, formerly the largest dry ski slope in England, before it was destroyed in a fire. Construction work was due to start in September 2008, on what would have become England&#x27;s third and largest indoor real snow ski centre. In May 2009, it was announced that construction would be delayed due to &#x27;difficulties getting a planning consent amendment.&#x27; As of 31 January 2012 it was announced that the site was up for sale.

Hughenden Manor borders the northern urban fringe of High Wycombe, approximately from the centre of town. Built in the Regency period, the architecturally appealing house was also home to Benjamin Disraeli for three decades in the mid-19th century. The three-floor mansion is situated in its own extensive grounds with beautifully landscaped gardens which back into the attractive Chiltern countryside. It is open to the public all year round as an historical attraction.

The local council maintains a landmark statue of a red lion above the former Woolworth&#x27;s store on the High Street. Its significance dates back to when the building was the &quot;Red Lion Hotel&quot;. Since its installation, the lion has been replaced several times and has had to undergo extensive repair due to damage from both the elements and human interference. Another notable landmark is the ruins of the Hospital of St John the Baptist, which is located on Easton Street, just east of the town centre opposite the Rye parkland, and dates to the 12th century. The stone structure is one of the very oldest in Wycombe, and is said to contain stone used from the Roman villa on the Rye.

The site of the ancient Desborough Castle is situated between the Desborough and Castlefield suburbs of the town, and provides their names.

==Industry==
Wycombe was once renowned for chairmaking (the town&#x27;s football team is nicknamed the &#x27;Chairboys&#x27;) and furniture design remains an important element of the town&#x27;s university curriculum, Buckinghamshire New University. Among the best known furniture companies were Ercol and E Gomme. The River Wye runs through the valley, where beech trees were cut down by the chair industry to forming the town centre (circa 1700), with housing along the slopes (some areas are still surrounded by woods). The town was also home to the worldwide postage stamp and banknote printer Harrison and Sons. More recent industries in the town include the production of paper, precision instruments, clothing and plastics. Many of these are situated in an industrial area of the Cressex district, southwest of the town centre. The two largest sites belong to the companies Swan (tobacco papers, filters and matches) and Verco (office furniture), who until 2004 sponsored the local football team, Wycombe Wanderers.

Wycombe&#x27;s industrial past is reflected on the town&#x27;s motto &quot;Industria ditat&quot;, &quot;Industry enriches&quot;. The motto can be found on town crest and Mayor&#x27;s badge of office.

==Recreation==
===Aviation===

Booker Gliding Club and two flying schools are based at Wycombe Air Park, the modern name for Booker Airfield, to the south of the M40 motorway on the western edge of the town. Many of the replica aircraft used in the film industry, for example in films such as &quot;Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines&quot;, &quot;Aces High&quot; and &quot;The Blue Max&quot; were built and flown from there. Wycombe Air Park is one of the busiest general aviation airfields in the UK. The Air Park is also home to Buckinghamshire Squash and Racketball Club.

===Leisure===
Hollywell Mead, an open swimming pool site in the town&#x27;s Rye Park, closed in March 2009 due to high running costs and was mothballed. However, in summer 2012, after a £2 million investment into the site, a new sports &amp; leisure facility was reopened. Further redevelopment works later took place, with improved tennis courts reopening in late 2013 and an upgraded pool reopening in May 2016.

There is a large leisure centre to the south of town at the top of Marlow Hill, close to the Handy Cross roundabout. Many sporting activities take place here and there is an Olympic-size swimming pool. The original leisure centre was designed by renowned architect John Attenborough, and opened in 1975. In 2011, proposals were made for a new leisure centre to be constructed on the site of the existing running track, with the relocation of the existing artificial turf pitch to the nearby John Hampden Grammar School and the running track to Little Marlow.

In January 2014, the artificial turf pitch had been relocated. By May 2014, construction work on the new facility had commenced.
The old leisure centre closed in December 2015, with the new leisure centre opening in January 2016. The old leisure centre was later demolished to make way for other developments.

==Housing==
A new experimental scheme to knock down old council flats in Micklefield and replace them with housing association properties was approved by John Prescott in 2003 after overwhelming approval by council residents. There are many different housing areas within the town, some of which such as the Castlefield district have gained a bad reputation for crime and drug-related problems.

The town is a diverse mixture of large council estates built in the 1930s, 1950s and 1960s that sprawl up the valley sides, compact Victorian terraces in the bottom of the valley to the east and west of town, and desirable areas for wealthy commuters. The Amersham Hill area is noted for its large period properties and leafy streets. Recent developments are showing a tendency towards blocks of flats, and developers are mainly making use of brownfield sites.

==Sport==
===Football===
The town&#x27;s football team, Wycombe Wanderers, founded in 1887, play at Adams Park, named after Frank Adams who donated the old Loakes Park ground to the club. They relocated to their current stadium in 1990. They currently play in EFL League One and have been members of the English Football League since 1993 when they were promoted as champions of the 1992–93 Football Conference. Since then they have enjoyed two notable cup runs (to the semi-finals of the FA Cup in 2001 and the Football League Cup in 2007), and four recent promotions from the fourth tier of the English league to the third tier (via the playoffs in 1994, and automatically in 2009, 2011 and 2018), plus promotion from the third tier to the second tier (Championship) via the playoffs in 2020. They have been managed by a number of high-profile football figures, including Martin O&#x27;Neill, Lawrie Sanchez, Tony Adams, and Gareth Ainsworth. Their current manager is former player Matt Bloomfield.

===Rugby===
The Wasps rugby union team also played at Adams Park for home games between the 2002–03 season and December 2014, the club&#x27;s most successful spell.

===Cricket===
High Wycombe Cricket Club is an English amateur cricket club with a history of cricket in the village dating back to 1823. The club has a significant success record, with 9 Home Counties Premier Cricket League championship titles to their name. High Wycombe field five senior teams. The 1st team play in the Home Counties Premier Cricket League (a designated ECB Premier League) and the rest compete in the Thames Valley Cricket League. They also have an established junior training section that play competitive cricket in the Bucks Cricket Competitions league.

==In popular culture==
High Wycombe is sometimes portrayed as a rather dull town where nothing much happens, as in this exchange between Kenneth Horne and Kenneth Williams in &quot;Round the Horne&quot;:

The town was mentioned several times in series 4 episode 2 (&quot;The Lying Detective&quot;) of the BBC TV series &quot;Sherlock&quot;, much in the same key.

Scenes in series 2 episode 3 (&quot;The Waldo Moment&quot;) of the Channel 4 TV series &quot;Black Mirror&quot; were filmed in High Wycombe.

<doc id="150248" wikidata="Q146728" url="?curid=150248" title="Water wheel">
<text>A water wheel is a machine for converting the kinetic energy of flowing or falling water into useful forms of power, often in a watermill. A water wheel consists of a large wheel (usually constructed from wood or metal), with numerous blades or buckets attached to the outer rim forming the drive mechanism. Water wheels were still in commercial use well into the 20th century, although they are no longer in common use today. Water wheels are used for milling flour in gristmills, grinding wood into pulp for papermaking, hammering wrought iron, machining, ore crushing and pounding fibre for use in the manufacture of cloth.

Some water wheels are fed by water from a mill pond, which is formed when a flowing stream is dammed. A channel for the water flowing to or from a water wheel is called a mill race. The race bringing water from the mill pond to the water wheel is a headrace; the one carrying water after it has left the wheel is commonly referred to as a tailrace.

Waterwheels were used for various purposes from things such as agriculture to metallurgy in ancient civilizations spanning the Hellenistic Greek world, Rome, China and India. Waterwheels saw continued use in the post-classical age, like in medieval Europe and the Islamic Golden Age, but also elsewhere. In the mid- to late 18th century John Smeaton&#x27;s scientific investigation of the water wheel led to significant increases in efficiency, supplying much-needed power for the Industrial Revolution. Water wheels began being displaced by the smaller, less expensive and more efficient turbine, developed by Benoît Fourneyron, beginning with his first model in 1827. Turbines are capable of handling high &quot;heads&quot;, or elevations, that exceed the capability of practical-sized waterwheels.

The main difficulty of water wheels is their dependence on flowing water, which limits where they can be located. Modern hydroelectric dams can be viewed as the descendants of the water wheel, as they too take advantage of the movement of water downhill.

== Types ==

Water wheels come in two basic designs:
* a horizontal wheel with a vertical axle; or
* a vertical wheel with a horizontal axle.
The latter can be subdivided according to where the water hits the wheel into backshot (pitch-back), overshot, breastshot, undershot, and stream-wheels.
The term &quot;undershot&quot; can refer to any wheel where the water passes under the wheel but it usually implies that the water entry is low on the wheel.

Overshot and backshot water wheels are typically used where the available height difference is more than a couple of meters. Breastshot wheels are more suited to large flows with a moderate head. Undershot and stream wheel use large flows at little or no head.

There is often an associated millpond, a reservoir for storing water and hence energy until it is needed. Larger heads store more gravitational potential energy for the same amount of water so the reservoirs for overshot and backshot wheels tend to be smaller than for breast shot wheels.

Overshot and pitchback water wheels are suitable where there is a small stream with a height difference of more than , often in association with a small reservoir. Breastshot and undershot wheels can be used on rivers or high volume flows with large reservoirs.

=== Summary of types ===
=== Vertical axis ===
A horizontal wheel with a vertical axle.

Commonly called a tub wheel, Norse mill or Greek mill, the horizontal wheel is a primitive and inefficient form of the modern turbine. However, if it delivers the required power then the efficiency is of secondary importance. It is usually mounted inside a mill building below the working floor. A jet of water is directed on to the paddles of the water wheel, causing them to turn. This is a simple system usually without gearing so that the vertical axle of the water wheel becomes the drive spindle of the mill.

=== Stream ===
A stream wheel is a vertically mounted water wheel that is rotated by the water in a water course striking paddles or blades at the bottom of the wheel. This type of water wheel is the oldest type of horizontal axis wheel. They are also known as free surface wheels because the water is not constrained by millraces or wheel pits. 

Stream wheels are cheaper and simpler to build and have less of an environmental impact than other types of wheels. They do not constitute a major change of the river. Their disadvantages are their low efficiency, which means that they generate less power and can only be used where the flow rate is sufficient. A typical flat board undershot wheel uses about 20 percent of the energy in the flow of water striking the wheel as measured by English civil engineer John Smeaton in the 18th century. More modern wheels have higher efficiencies.

Stream wheels gain little or no advantage from the head, a difference in water level.

Stream wheels mounted on floating platforms are often referred to as hip wheels and the mill as a ship mill. They were sometimes mounted immediately downstream from bridges where the flow restriction of the bridge piers increased the speed of the current.

Historically they were very inefficient but major advances were made in the eighteenth century.

=== Undershot wheel ===
An undershot wheel is a vertically mounted water wheel with a horizontal axle that is rotated by the water from a low weir striking the wheel in the bottom quarter. Most of the energy gain is from the movement of the water and comparatively little from the head. They are similar in operation and design to stream wheels.

The term undershot is sometimes used with related but different meanings:
* all wheels where the water passes under the wheel
* wheels where the water enters in the bottom quarter.
* wheels where paddles are placed into the flow of a stream. See the stream above.

This is the oldest type of vertical water wheel.

=== Breastshot wheel ===
The word breastshot is used in a variety of ways. Some authors restrict the term to wheels where the water enters at about the 10 o’clock position, others 9 o’clock, and others for a range of heights. In this article it is used for wheels where the water entry is significantly above the bottom and significantly below the top, typically the middle half.

They are characterized by:
* buckets carefully shaped to minimize turbulence as water enters
* buckets ventilated with holes in the side to allow air to escape as the water enters
* a masonry &quot;apron&quot; closely conforming to the wheel face, which helps contain the water in the buckets as they progress downwards

Both kinetic (movement) and potential (height and weight) energy are utilised.

The small clearance between the wheel and the masonry requires that a breastshot wheel has a good trash rack (&#x27;screen&#x27; in British English) to prevent debris from jamming between the wheel and the apron and potentially causing serious damage.

Breastshot wheels are less efficient than overshot and backshot wheels but they can handle high flow rates and consequently high power. They are preferred for steady, high-volume flows such as are found on the Fall Line of the North American East Coast. Breastshot wheels are the most common type in the United States of America and are said to have powered the industrial revolution.

=== Overshot wheel ===
A vertically mounted water wheel that is rotated by water entering buckets just past the top of the wheel is said to be overshot. The term is sometimes, erroneously, applied to backshot wheels, where the water goes down behind the wheel.

A typical overshot wheel has the water channeled to the wheel at the top and slightly beyond the axle. The water collects in the buckets on that side of the wheel, making it heavier than the other &quot;empty&quot; side. The weight turns the wheel, and the water flows out into the tail-water when the wheel rotates enough to invert the buckets. The overshot design is very efficient, it can achieve 90%, and does not require rapid flow.

Nearly all of the energy is gained from the weight of water lowered to the tailrace although a small contribution may be made by the kinetic energy of the water entering the wheel. They are suited to larger heads than the other type of wheel so they are ideally suited to hilly countries. However even the largest water wheel, the Laxey Wheel in the Isle of Man, only utilises a head of around . The world&#x27;s largest head turbines, Bieudron Hydroelectric Power Station in Switzerland, utilise about .

Overshot wheels require a large head compared to other types of wheel which usually means significant investment in constructing the headrace. Sometimes the final approach of the water to the wheel is along a flume or penstock, which can be lengthy.

=== Backshot wheel ===
A backshot wheel (also called pitchback) is a variety of overshot wheel where the water is introduced just before the summit of the wheel. In many situations, it has the advantage that the bottom of the wheel is moving in the same direction as the water in the tailrace which makes it more efficient. It also performs better than an overshot wheel in flood conditions when the water level may submerge the bottom of the wheel. It will continue to rotate until the water in the wheel pit rises quite high on the wheel. This makes the technique particularly suitable for streams that experience significant variations in flow and reduces the size, complexity, and hence cost of the tailrace.

The direction of rotation of a backshot wheel is the same as that of a breastshot wheel but in other respects, it is very similar to the overshot wheel. See below.

=== Hybrid ===
==== Overshot and backshot ====
Some wheels are overshot at the top and backshot at the bottom thereby potentially combining the best features of both types. The photograph shows an example at Finch Foundry in Devon, UK. The head race is the overhead timber structure and a branch to the left supplies water to the wheel. The water exits from under the wheel back into the stream.

==== Reversible ====
A special type of overshot/backshot wheel is the reversible water wheel. This has two sets of blades or buckets running in opposite directions so that it can turn in either direction depending on which side the water is directed. Reversible wheels were used in the mining industry in order to power various means of ore conveyance. By changing the direction of the wheel, barrels or baskets of ore could be lifted up or lowered down a shaft or inclined plane. There was usually a cable drum or a chain basket on the axle of the wheel. It is essential that the wheel have braking equipment to be able to stop the wheel (known as a braking wheel). The oldest known drawing of a reversible water wheel was by Georgius Agricola and dates to 1556.

== History ==
As in all machinery, rotary motion is more efficient in water-raising devices than oscillating motion. In terms of power source, waterwheels can be turned by either human respectively animal force or by the water current itself. Waterwheels come in two basic designs, either equipped with a vertical or a horizontal axle. The latter type can be subdivided, depending on where the water hits the wheel paddles, into overshot, breastshot and undershot wheels. The two main functions of waterwheels were historically water-lifting for irrigation purposes and milling, particularly of grain. In case of horizontal-axle mills, a system of gears is required for power transmission, which vertical-axle mills do not need.

=== Western world ===
==== Greco-Roman world ====
The technological breakthrough occurred in the technologically developed Hellenistic period between the 3rd and 1st century BC. A poem by Antipater of Thessalonica praised the water wheel for freeing women from the exhausting labor of milling and grinding.

===== Water-lifting =====
The compartmented water wheel comes in two basic forms, the wheel with compartmented body (Latin &quot;tympanum&quot;) and the wheel with compartmented rim or a rim with separate, attached containers. The wheels could be either turned by men treading on its outside or by animals by means of a sakia gear. While the tympanum had a large discharge capacity, it could lift the water only to less than the height of its own radius and required a large torque for rotating. These constructional deficiencies were overcome by the wheel with a compartmented rim which was a less heavy design with a higher lift.

The earliest literary reference to a water-driven, compartmented wheel appears in the technical treatise &quot;Pneumatica&quot; (chap. 61) of the Greek engineer Philo of Byzantium (). In his &quot;Parasceuastica&quot; (91.43−44), Philo advises the use of such wheels for submerging siege mines as a defensive measure against enemy sapping. Compartmented wheels appear to have been the means of choice for draining dry docks in Alexandria under the reign of Ptolemy IV (221−205 BC). Several Greek papyri of the 3rd to 2nd century BC mention the use of these wheels, but do not give further details. The non-existence of the device in the Ancient Near East before Alexander&#x27;s conquest can be deduced from its pronounced absence from the otherwise rich oriental iconography on irrigation practices. Unlike other water-lifting devices and pumps of the period though, the invention of the compartmented wheel cannot be traced to any particular Hellenistic engineer and may have been made in the late 4th century BC in a rural context away from the metropolis of Alexandria.

The earliest depiction of a compartmented wheel is from a tomb painting in Ptolemaic Egypt which dates to the 2nd century BC. It shows a pair of yoked oxen driving the wheel via a sakia gear, which is here for the first time attested, too. The Greek sakia gear system is already shown fully developed to the point that &quot;modern Egyptian devices are virtually identical&quot;. It is assumed that the scientists of the Museum of Alexandria, at the time the most active Greek research center, may have been involved in its invention. An episode from the Alexandrian War in 48 BC tells of how Caesar&#x27;s enemies employed geared waterwheels to pour sea water from elevated places on the position of the trapped Romans.

Around 300 AD, the noria was finally introduced when the wooden compartments were replaced with inexpensive ceramic pots that were tied to the outside of an open-framed wheel.

===== Watermilling =====
Taking indirect evidence into account from the work of the Greek technician Apollonius of Perge, the British historian of technology M.J.T. Lewis dates the appearance of the vertical-axle watermill to the early 3rd century BC, and the horizontal-axle watermill to around 240 BC, with Byzantium and Alexandria as the assigned places of invention. A watermill is reported by the Greek geographer Strabon () to have existed sometime before 71 BC in the palace of the Pontian king Mithradates VI Eupator, but its exact construction cannot be gleaned from the text (XII, 3, 30 C 556).

The first clear description of a geared watermill offers the late 1st century BC Roman architect Vitruvius who tells of the sakia gearing system as being applied to a watermill. Vitruvius&#x27;s account is particularly valuable in that it shows how the watermill came about, namely by the combination of the separate Greek inventions of the toothed gear and the waterwheel into one effective mechanical system for harnessing water power. Vitruvius&#x27; waterwheel is described as being immersed with its lower end in the watercourse so that its paddles could be driven by the velocity of the running water (X, 5.2).

About the same time, the overshot wheel appears for the first time in a poem by Antipater of Thessalonica, which praises it as a labour-saving device (IX, 418.4–6). The motif is also taken up by Lucretius (ca. 99–55 BC) who likens the rotation of the waterwheel to the motion of the stars on the firmament (V 516). The third horizontal-axled type, the breastshot waterwheel, comes into archaeological evidence by the late 2nd century AD context in central Gaul. Most excavated Roman watermills were equipped with one of these wheels which, although more complex to construct, were much more efficient than the vertical-axle waterwheel. In the 2nd century AD Barbegal watermill complex a series of sixteen overshot wheels was fed by an artificial aqueduct, a proto-industrial grain factory which has been referred to as &quot;the greatest known concentration of mechanical power in the ancient world&quot;.

In Roman North Africa, several installations from around 300 AD were found where vertical-axle waterwheels fitted with angled blades were installed at the bottom of a water-filled, circular shaft. The water from the mill-race which entered tangentially the pit created a swirling water column that made the fully submerged wheel act like true water turbines, the earliest known to date.

===== Navigation =====
Apart from its use in milling and water-raising, ancient engineers applied the paddled waterwheel for automatons and in navigation. Vitruvius (X 9.5–7) describes multi-geared paddle wheels working as a ship odometer, the earliest of its kind. The first mention of paddle wheels as a means of propulsion comes from the 4th–5th century military treatise &quot;De Rebus Bellicis&quot; (chapter XVII), where the anonymous Roman author describes an ox-driven paddle-wheel warship.

==== Medieval Europe ====
Ancient water-wheel technology continued unabated in the early medieval period where the appearance of new documentary genres such as legal codes, monastic charters, but also hagiography was accompanied with a sharp increase in references to watermills and wheels.

The earliest vertical-wheel in a tide mill is from 6th-century Killoteran near Waterford, Ireland, while the first known horizontal-wheel in such a type of mill is from the Irish Little Island (c. 630). As for the use in a common Norse or Greek mill, the oldest known horizontal-wheels were excavated in the Irish Ballykilleen, dating to c. 636.

Cistercian monasteries, in particular, made extensive use of water wheels to power watermills of many kinds. An early example of a very large water wheel is the still extant wheel at the early 13th century Real Monasterio de Nuestra Senora de Rueda, a Cistercian monastery in the Aragon region of Spain. Grist mills (for grain) were undoubtedly the most common, but there were also sawmills, fulling mills and mills to fulfil many other labour-intensive tasks. The water wheel remained competitive with the steam engine well into the Industrial Revolution. At around the 8th to 10th century, a number of irrigation technologies were brought into Spain and thus introduced to Europe. One of those technologies is the Noria, which is basically a wheel fitted with buckets on the peripherals for lifting water. It is similar to the undershot water wheel mentioned later in this article. It allowed peasants to power watermills more efficiently. According to Thomas Glick&#x27;s book, &quot;Irrigation and Society in Medieval Valencia&quot;, the Noria probably originated from somewhere in Persia. It has been used for centuries before the technology was brought into Spain by Arabs who had adopted it from the Romans. Thus the distribution of the Noria in the Iberian peninsula &quot;conforms to the area of stabilized Islamic settlement&quot;.

The assembly convened by William of Normandy, commonly referred to as the &quot;Domesday&quot; or Doomsday survey, took an inventory of all potentially taxable property in England, which included over six thousand mills spread across three thousand different locations, up from less than a hundred in the previous century.

The type of water wheel selected was dependent upon the location. Generally if only small volumes of water and high waterfalls were available a millwright would choose to use an overshot wheel. The decision was influenced by the fact that the buckets could catch and use even a small volume of water. For large volumes of water with small waterfalls the undershot wheel would have been used, since it was more adapted to such conditions and cheaper to construct. So long as these water supplies were abundant the question of efficiency remained irrelevant. By the 18th century, with increased demand for power coupled with limited water locales, an emphasis was made on efficiency scheme.

By the 11th century there were parts of Europe where the exploitation of water was commonplace. The water wheel is understood to have actively shaped and forever changed the outlook of Westerners. Europe began to transit from human and animal muscle labor towards mechanical labor with the advent of the water wheel. Medievalist Lynn White Jr. contended that the spread of inanimate power sources was eloquent testimony to the emergence of the West of a new attitude toward, power, work, nature, and above all else technology.

Harnessing water-power enabled gains in agricultural productivity, food surpluses and the large scale urbanization starting in the 11th century. The usefulness of water power motivated European experiments with other power sources, such as wind and tidal mills. Waterwheels influenced the construction of cities, more specifically canals. The techniques that developed during this early period such as stream jamming and the building of canals, put Europe on a hydraulically focused path, for instance water supply and irrigation technology was combined to modify supply power of the wheel.

The water mill was used for grinding grain, producing flour for bread, malt for beer, or coarse meal for porridge.

==== 17th- and 18th-century Europe ====
Millwrights distinguished between the two forces, impulse and weight, at work in water wheels long before 18th-century Europe. Fitzherbert, a 16th-century agricultural writer, wrote &quot;druieth the wheel as well as with the weight of the water as with strengthe [impulse]&quot;. Leonardo da Vinci also discussed water power, noting &quot;the blow [of the water] is not weight, but excites a power of weight, almost equal to its own power&quot;. However, even realisation of the two forces, weight and impulse, confusion remained over the advantages and disadvantages of the two, and there was no clear understanding of the superior efficiency of weight. Prior to 1750 it was unsure as to which force was dominant and was widely understood that both forces were operating with equal inspiration amongst one another. The waterwheel sparked questions of the laws of nature, specifically the laws of force. Evangelista Torricelli&#x27;s work on water wheels used an analysis of Galileo&#x27;s work on falling bodies, that the velocity of a water sprouting from an orifice under its head was exactly equivalent to the velocity a drop of water acquired in falling freely from the same height.

==== Industrial Europe ====
The water wheel was a driving force behind the earliest stages of industrialization in Britain. Water-powered reciprocating devices were used in trip hammers and blast furnace bellows. Richard Arkwright&#x27;s water frame was powered by a water wheel.

==== North America ====
Water wheels were used to power sawmills, grist mills and for other purposes during development of the United States. The diameter water wheel at McCoy, Colorado, built in 1922, is a surviving one out of many which lifted water for irrigation out of the Colorado River.

Two early improvements were suspension wheels and rim gearing. Suspension wheels are constructed in the same manner as a bicycle wheel, the rim being supported under tension from the hub- this led to larger lighter wheels than the former design where the heavy spokes were under compression. Rim-gearing entailed adding a notched wheel to the rim or shroud of the wheel. A stub gear engaged the rim-gear and took the power into the mill using an independent line shaft. This removed the rotative stress from the axle which could thus be lighter, and also allowed more flexibility in the location of the power train. The shaft rotation was geared up from that of the wheel which led to less power loss. An example of this design pioneered by Thomas Hewes and refined by William Armstrong Fairburn can be seen at the 1849 restored wheel at the Portland Basin Canal Warehouse.

==== Australia ====
Australia has a relatively dry climate, nonetheless, where suitable water resources were available, water wheels were constructed in 19th-century Australia. These were used to power sawmills, flour mills, and stamper batteries used to crush gold-bearing ore. Notable examples of water wheels used in gold recovery operations were the large Garfield water wheel near Chewton—one of at least seven water wheels in the surrounding area—and the two water wheels at Adelong Falls; some remnants exist at both sites. The mining area at Walhalla once had at least two water wheels, one of which was rolled to its site from Port Albert, on its rim using a novel trolley arrangement, taking nearly 90 days. A water wheel at Jindabyne, constructed in 1847, was the first machine used to extract energy—for flour milling—from the Snowy River.

Compact water wheels, known as Dethridge wheels, were used not as sources of power but to measure water flows to irrigated land.

==== New Zealand ====
Water wheels were used extensively in New Zealand. The well-preserved remains of the Young Australian mine&#x27;s overshot water wheel exist near the ghost town of Carricktown, and those of the Phoenix flour mill&#x27;s water wheel are near Oamaru.

=== China ===
According to Joseph Needham and other historians, the text known as the &quot;Xin Lun&quot; written by Huan Tan about 20 AD (during the usurpation of Wang Mang) infers that water wheels had been used for pounding machinery in grain mills. The &quot;Xin Lun&quot; states that the legendary mythological king known as Fu Xi was the one responsible for the pestle and mortar, which evolved into the tilt-hammer and then trip hammer device (see trip hammer). Although the author speaks of the mythological Fu Xi, a passage of his writing gives hint that the water wheel was in widespread use by the 1st century AD in China (Wade-Giles spelling):

Fu Hsi invented the pestle and mortar, which is so useful, and later on it was cleverly improved in such a way that the whole weight of the body could be used for treading on the tilt-hammer (&quot;tui&quot;), thus increasing the efficiency ten times. Afterwards the power of animals—donkeys, mules, oxen, and horses—was applied by means of machinery, and water-power too used for pounding, so that the benefit was increased a hundredfold.

In the year 31 AD, the engineer and Prefect of Nanyang, Du Shi (d. 38), applied a complex use of the water wheel and machinery to power the bellows of the blast furnace to create cast iron. Du Shi is mentioned briefly in the &quot;Book of Later Han&quot; (&quot;Hou Han Shu&quot;) as follows (in Wade-Giles spelling):

In the seventh year of the Chien-Wu reign period (31 AD) Tu Shih was posted to be Prefect of Nanyang. He was a generous man and his policies were peaceful; he destroyed evil-doers and established the dignity (of his office). Good at planning, he loved the common people and wished to save their labor. He invented a water-power reciprocator (&quot;shui phai&quot;) for the casting of (iron) agricultural implements. Those who smelted and cast already had the push-bellows to blow up their charcoal fires, and now they were instructed to use the rushing of the water (&quot;chi shui&quot;) to operate it ... Thus the people got great benefit for little labor. They found the &#x27;water(-powered) bellows&#x27; convenient and adopted it widely.

According to the &quot;Book of Jin&quot;, Zhang Heng (78-139) invented a water-powered armillary sphere which could &quot;turn around by water leakage&quot; around 130. Later generations speculated that this meant a water wheel.

According to the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, the mechanical engineer Ma Jun (c. 200–265) from Cao Wei used a water wheel to power and operate a large mechanical puppet theater for Emperor Ming of Wei ( 226–239). The device was carved using large wood, wheel shaped, and operated parallel to the ground to lift water in order to drive an assortment of puppets as well as mills with pestle. The Prefect Han Ji was made Superintendent of Metallurgical Production sometime before 238. He &quot;adapted the furnace bellows to the use of ever-flowing water, and an efficiency three times greater than before was attained.&quot; Twenty years later, a new design was introduced by a man named Du Yu. A record dated to 263 or later mentions a device known as &quot;shui dui&quot; that made use of water wheels: 

In the beginning of the Yuanjia era (424-429), an artificial lake was created for water powered blowing bellows used in smelting and casting works. However it was discovered that the earthworks of the lake leaked and were insufficient for their intended purpose. They were destroyed and replaced by man-powered &quot;treadmill bellows&quot;.

=== India ===
The early history of the watermill in India is obscure. Ancient Indian texts dating back to the 4th century BC refer to the term &quot;cakkavattaka&quot; (turning wheel), which commentaries explain as &quot;arahatta-ghati-yanta&quot; (machine with wheel-pots attached). On this basis, Joseph Needham suggested that the machine was a noria. Terry S. Reynolds, however, argues that the &quot;term used in Indian texts is ambiguous and does not clearly indicate a water-powered device.&quot; Thorkild Schiøler argued that it is &quot;more likely that these passages refer to some type of tread- or hand-operated water-lifting device, instead of a water-powered water-lifting wheel.&quot;

According to Greek historical tradition, India received water-mills from the Roman Empire in the early 4th century AD when a certain Metrodoros introduced &quot;water-mills and baths, unknown among them [the Brahmans] till then&quot;. Irrigation water for crops was provided by using water raising wheels, some driven by the force of the current in the river from which the water was being raised. This kind of water raising device was used in ancient India, predating, according to Pacey, its use in the later Roman Empire or China, even though the first literary, archaeological and pictorial evidence of the water wheel appeared in the Hellenistic world.

Around 1150, the astronomer Bhaskara Achārya observed water-raising wheels and imagined such a wheel lifting enough water to replenish the stream driving it, effectively, a perpetual motion machine. The construction of water works and aspects of water technology in India is described in Arabic and Persian works. During medieval times, the diffusion of Indian and Persian irrigation technologies gave rise to an advanced irrigation system which bought about economic growth and also helped in the growth of material culture.

=== Islamic world ===

After the spread of Islam engineers of the Islamic world continued the water technologies of the ancient Near East; as evident in the excavation of a canal in the Basra region with remains of a water wheel dating from the 7th century. Hama in Syria still preserves some of its large wheels, on the river Orontes, although they are no longer in use. One of the largest had a diameter of about and its rim was divided into 120 compartments. Another wheel that is still in operation is found at Murcia in Spain, La Nora, and although the original wheel has been replaced by a steel one, the Moorish system during al-Andalus is otherwise virtually unchanged. Some medieval Islamic compartmented water wheels could lift water as high as . Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi&#x27;s &quot;Kitab al-Hawi&quot; in the 10th century described a noria in Iraq that could lift as much as , or . This is comparable to the output of modern norias in East Asia, which can lift up to , or .

The industrial uses of watermills in the Islamic world date back to the 7th century, while horizontal-wheeled and vertical-wheeled water mills were both in widespread use by the 9th century. A variety of industrial watermills were used in the Islamic world, including gristmills, hullers, sawmills, shipmills, stamp mills, steel mills, sugar mills, and tide mills. By the 11th century, every province throughout the Islamic world had these industrial watermills in operation, from al-Andalus and North Africa to the Middle East and Central Asia. Muslim and Christian engineers also used crankshafts and water turbines, gears in watermills and water-raising machines, and dams as a source of water, used to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines. Fulling mills and steel mills may have spread from Islamic Spain to Christian Spain in the 12th century. Industrial water mills were also employed in large factory complexes built in al-Andalus between the 11th and 13th centuries.

The engineers of the Islamic world developed several solutions to achieve the maximum output from a water wheel. One solution was to mount them to piers of bridges to take advantage of the increased flow. Another solution was the shipmill, a type of water mill powered by water wheels mounted on the sides of ships moored in midstream. This technique was employed along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in 10th-century Iraq, where large shipmills made of teak and iron could produce 10 tons of flour from grain every day for the granary in Baghdad. The flywheel mechanism, which is used to smooth out the delivery of power from a driving device to a driven machine, was invented by Ibn Bassal (fl. 1038–1075) of Al-Andalus; he pioneered the use of the flywheel in the saqiya (chain pump) and noria. The engineers Al-Jazari in the 13th century and Taqi al-Din in the 16th century described many inventive water-raising machines in their technological treatises. They also employed water wheels to power a variety of devices, including various water clocks and automata.

=== Modern developments ===
==== Hydraulic wheel ====
A recent development of the breastshot wheel is a hydraulic wheel which effectively incorporates automatic regulation systems. The Aqualienne is one example. It generates between 37 kW and 200 kW of electricity from a waterflow with a head of . It is designed to produce electricity at the sites of former watermills.

== Efficiency ==
Overshot (and particularly backshot) wheels are the most efficient type; a backshot steel wheel can be more efficient (about 60%) than all but the most advanced and well-constructed turbines. In some situations an overshot wheel is preferable to a turbine.

The development of the hydraulic turbine wheels with their improved efficiency (&gt;67%) opened up an alternative path for the installation of water wheels in existing mills, or redevelopment of abandoned mills.

== The power of a wheel ==

The energy available to the wheel has two components:

* Kinetic energy – depends on how fast the water is moving when it enters the wheel
* Potential energy – depends on the change in height of the water between entry to and exit from the wheel

The kinetic energy can be accounted for by converting it into an equivalent head, the velocity head, and adding it to the actual head. For still water the velocity head is zero, and to a good approximation it is negligible for slowly moving water, and can be ignored. The velocity in the tail race is not taken into account because for a perfect wheel the water would leave with zero energy which requires zero velocity. That is impossible, the water has to move away from the wheel, and represents an unavoidable cause of inefficiency.

The power is how fast that energy is delivered which is determined by the flow rate. It has been estimated that the ancient donkey or slave-powered quern of Rome made about one-half of a horsepower, the horizontal waterwheel creating slightly more than one-half of a horsepower, the undershot vertical waterwheel produced about three horsepower, and the medieval overshot waterwheel produced up to forty to sixty horsepower.

=== Quantities and units ===
*formula_1 efficiency
*formula_2 density of water (1000 kg/m3)
*formula_3 cross sectional area of the channel (m2)
*formula_4 diameter of wheel (m)
*formula_5 power (W)
*formula_6 distance (m)
*formula_7 strength of gravity (9.81 m/s2 = 9.81 N/kg)
*formula_8 head (m)
*formula_9 pressure head, the difference in water levels (m)
*formula_10 velocity head (m)
*formula_11 velocity correction factor. 0.9 for smooth channels.
*formula_12 velocity (m/s)
*formula_13 volume flow rate (m3/s)
*formula_14 time (s)
=== Measurements ===
The pressure head formula_15 is the difference in height between the head race and tail race water surfaces. The velocity head formula_16 is calculated from the velocity of the water in the head race at the same place as the pressure head is measured from. The velocity (speed) formula_17 can be measured by the pooh sticks method, timing a floating object over a measured distance. The water at the surface moves faster than water nearer to the bottom and sides so a correction factor should be applied as in the formula below.

There are many ways to measure the volume flow rate. Two of the simplest are:
*From the cross sectional area and the velocity. They must be measured at the same place but that can be anywhere in the head or tail races. It must have the same amount of water going through it as the wheel.
*It is sometimes practicable to measure the volume flow rate by the bucket and stop watch method.

=== Formulae ===
=== Rules of thumb ===
==== Breast and overshot ====
==== Traditional undershot wheels ====
=== Hydraulic wheel part reaction turbine ===
A parallel development is the hydraulic wheel/part reaction turbine that also incorporates a weir into the centre of the wheel but uses blades angled to the water flow.
The WICON-Stem Pressure Machine (SPM) exploits this flow. Estimated efficiency 67%.

The University of Southampton School of Civil Engineering and the Environment in the UK has investigated both types of Hydraulic wheel machines and has estimated their hydraulic efficiency and suggested improvements, i.e. The Rotary Hydraulic Pressure Machine. (Estimated maximum efficiency 85%).

These type of water wheels have high efficiency at part loads / variable flows and can operate at very low heads, &lt; . Combined with direct drive Axial Flux Permanent Magnet Alternators and power electronics they offer a viable alternative for low head hydroelectric power generation.

<text>The Tyson turbine is a conical water turbine with helical blades emerging partway down from the apex gradually increasing in radial dimension and decreasing in pitch as they spiral towards the base of the cone. This design doesn&#x27;t need a casement, as it is inserted directly into flowing water.

Marketed as part of a hydropower system that extracts power from the flow of water, the turbine is mounted below a raft, driving a power system, typically a lift irrigation pump or generator, on top of the raft by belt or gear. The turbine is towed into the middle of a river or stream, where the flow is the fastest, and tied off to shore. It requires no local engineering, and can easily be moved to other locations.

<doc id="150253" wikidata="Q944772" url="?curid=150253" title="River Cam">
<text>The River Cam () is the main river flowing through Cambridge in eastern England. After leaving Cambridge, it flows north and east before joining the River Great Ouse to the south of Ely, at Pope&#x27;s Corner. The total distance from Cambridge to the sea is about and is navigable for punts, small boats, and rowing craft. The Great Ouse also connects to England&#x27;s canal system via the Middle Level Navigations and the River Nene. In total, the Cam runs for around from its furthest source (near Debden in Essex) to its confluence with the Great Ouse.

==Name==
The original name of the river was the &quot;Granta&quot; and (unusually) its present name derives from the city of Cambridge () rather than the other way around: After the city&#x27;s present name developed in Middle English, the river&#x27;s name was backformed to match. This was not universally applied, however, and the upper stretch of the river continues to be informally known as the Granta. It has been said that the river is the &quot;Granta&quot; above the Silver Street Bridge (in Cambridge) and the &quot;Cam&quot; below it. The Rhee tributary is also formally known as the Cam, and the Granta has a tributary on its upper stretch also known as the Granta. On Ordnance Survey maps, the two main tributaries&#x27; alternative names are recognised: &quot;River Cam or Granta&quot; and &quot;River Cam or Rhee&quot;.

The Cam has no connection with the much smaller River Cam in Gloucestershire.

==The lower river==

An organisation called the Conservators of the River Cam was formed in 1702, charged with keeping the river navigable. The Conservators are responsible for the two locks in and north east of Cambridge: Jesus Lock and Baits Bite Lock. The stretch north (downstream) of Jesus Lock is sometimes called the lower river. 

The stretch between Jesus Lock and Baits Bite Lock is much used for rowing. There are also many residential boats on this stretch, their occupants forming a community who call themselves the Camboaters.

Navigation on the lowest section of the Cam, below and including Bottisham Lock, is the responsibility of the Environment Agency.

==From Jesus Lock and the Backs to Grantchester (middle and upper river)==

The stretch above Jesus Lock is sometimes known as the middle river (with the section above the Mill Pond being referred to as the upper river). Between Jesus Lock and the Mill Pond, it passes through the Backs below the walls of many of the colleges. This is the section of river most popular with tourists, with its picture-postcard views of elegant bridges, green lawns and graceful willows. This stretch also has the unusual feature of the remains of a submerged towpath: the riverside colleges did not permit barge horses on the Backs, so the beasts waded up the Cam to the mill pulling their loads behind them.

Access for mechanically powered boats is prohibited above &#x27;La Mimosa&#x27; Pub (at the upstream end of Jesus Green) between 1 April and 30 September, when the middle and upper river are open only to manually propelled craft. The most common of these are the flat-bottomed punts.

Between 1 October and 31 March powered boats are allowed as far as Mill Pool, but few people take advantage of this, as there are very few public mooring places along the Backs, and the river is too narrow and the bridges too low to afford easy passing or turning for many boats.
Punts and canoes can be manhandled around the weir above the Mill Pool by means of the rollers, a slipway from lower to upper level. From the Mill Pool and its weir, the river can be followed upstream through Grantchester meadows to the village of Grantchester and Byron&#x27;s Pool, where it is fed by many streams.

==Tributaries==
The two principal tributaries of the Cam are the Granta and the Rhee, though both are also known as the Cam.

===Rhee===
The Rhee begins just off the High Street (Ashwell Springs), at Ashwell in Hertfordshire. Running north out of Ashwell, it forms the county boundary between Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire for around two kilometres, then the boundary between Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire for a further kilometre. At this point its course turns east and from here until it merges with the Granta it forms the parish boundary between a succession of villages, though until it reaches Barrington it remains at a distance of around a kilometre from any settlement of any size.

Just after flowing under the Roman Ermine Street, it crosses the avenue of Wimpole Hall and a few kilometres later it receives the waters of the minor River Mel that runs through Meldreth. It runs along the southern edge of the village of Barrington, where it still powers a water mill known as Bulbeck Mill. At Harston it passes Harston Mill, the site of a water mill from at least the 11th century until the need for mill died out in the mid-20th century, and the parish church of All Saints. It then touches the eastern edge of the village of Haslingfield before joining the Granta at Hauxton Junction. From source to its confluence with the Granta it is in length.

===Granta===

The longer tributary, the Granta, starts in the parish of Debden to the east of the village of Widdington in Essex. After initially running south west to descend from the hills of Uttlesford, it turns north just west of the village of Henham. From there until Great Shelford it largely follows the course of the West Anglia Main Line railway. Its northward journey passes first through Newport, where it is joined by the streams known as Wicken Water and Debden Water. A couple of miles later it forms a picturesque addition to views of the stately home as it flows past the front of Audley End House, and is also joined by the stream known as Fulfen Slade. It then skirts the edges of a number of villages as it moves into Cambridgeshire, successively Littlebury, Little Chesterford, Great Chesterford, Ickleton, Hinxton, Duxford and Whittlesford, powering a number of water mills along the way. Forming the boundary between Great Shelford and Little Shelford, it turns west to flow past Hauxton to merge with the Rhee a mile south of Grantchester at Hauxton Junction. From source to its confluence with the Rhee it is in length.

===Other tributaries===
A further tributary, also known as the Granta, runs from south of Haverhill to join the larger Granta south of Great Shelford. Another minor tributary is Bourn Brook which has its source near the village of Eltisley, west of Cambridge, running east through Caxton, Bourn and Toft to join the Cam at Byron&#x27;s Pool.

==Literature==
&quot;The Reeve&#x27;s Tale&quot; from Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; begins:

The mill formerly stood by Brasley Bridge on Grantchester Road. The mill pond is extant and the foundations of the mill can be seen when the water is low.

Byron&#x27;s Pool is named after the poet, Lord Byron, who is reputed to have swum there. It was certainly a bathing place for Rupert Brooke and the Cambridge neo-Pagans. Brooke used to canoe from Cambridge to lodgings in Grantchester, which included the Old Vicarage. His homesick poem of 1912 evokes the river:

: Oh! there the chestnuts, summer through,
: Beside the river make for you
: A tunnel of green gloom, and sleep
: Deeply above; and green and deep
: The stream mysterious glides beneath,
: Green as a dream and deep as death.
: To smell the thrilling-sweet and rotten
: Unforgettable, unforgotten
: River-smell, and hear the breeze
: Sobbing in the little trees.
: Say, do the elm-clumps greatly stand
: Still guardians of that holy land?
: The chestnuts shade, in reverend dream,
: The yet unacademic stream?
—&quot;The Old Vicarage, Grantchester&quot;, &quot;Collected Poems&quot; (1916)

One of Brooke&#x27;s contemporaries, Gwen Darwin, later Raverat, grew up in the old mill by the Mill Pond. Her book, &quot;Period Piece&quot;, is a memoir of a childhood messing about on the river. The mill house is now part of Darwin College.

Children&#x27;s author Philippa Pearce, who lived in Great Shelford until her death in December 2006, featured the Cam in her books, most notably &quot;Minnow on the Say&quot;. The river is renamed the River Say, with Great and Little Shelford becoming Great and Little Barley, and Cambridge becoming &quot;Castleford&quot; (not to be confused with the real town of the same name in West Yorkshire).

River Cam is referred to as &quot;Camus, reverend Sire&quot; in line 103 of John Milton&#x27;s pastoral elegy &quot;Lycidas&quot;. Edward King, in whose memory the elegy was composed, was a fellow student at Cambridge.

==Use for recreation==

Like many rivers, the Cam is extensively used for several forms of recreational activity. These include angling, swimming and various kinds of boating.
===Angling===
The water is not murky and is clean enough from its source to its confluence with the Great Ouse to support fish. The fishing rights on the west bank are leased annually to the Cambridge Fish Preservation and Angling Society.

The Cam below Bottisham Sluice may still hold burbot, a fish thought to be extinct in English waters since the early 1970s. The last known burbot caught in Britain was in 1969, on the Cam, and in 2010 a fisherman reported spotting two in the Great Ouse.

Above Hinxton and Great Chesterford the river holds a stock of wild brown trout, though it is also stocked by the Audley Fly Fishers club and other angling societies who own the rights.

===Boating===
All boats require a navigation licence from either the Conservators of the River Cam or the Environment Agency.

There are public moorings just below Jesus Lock on both sides of the river and on the western bank just north of the bridge at Clayhithe (both with a maximum stay of 48 hours), and unofficial moorings on the railings adjoining Riverside in Cambridge (unlimited stay, but usually fully occupied) which are under review by Cambridge City Council and likely to be reduced to eight or nine formalised residential moorings, or removed altogether. The moorings on the commons in Cambridge (Jesus Green, Midsummer Common and Stourbridge Common) are reserved by the City Council for holders of its long-term mooring permits. There are also some privately owned moorings.

There is a public slipway next to the garden of the Green Dragon pub in Water Street, Chesterton. This is occasionally used for launching small boats.

====Punting====

Punting is the most popular form of boating on the stretch of the river between Jesus Lock and Grantchester. Several of the colleges own punts, and they can also be hired from various companies, either with or without a person to operate them. The colleges and at least one private operator also own punts which are available for members of the public to travel on.

====Canoeing====
Canoeing and kayaking, both recreational and competitive, are popular at all times of year, especially on the section above the Mill Pond towards Grantchester. Both Cambridge Canoe Club (on Sheep&#x27;s Green) and Cambridge University Canoe Club (just upstream from Newnham) are based here.

====Powered boating====
Powered boats may navigate as far upstream as La Mimosa restaurant (next to Jesus Green) all year round, and as far as the Mill Pool between 1 October and 31 March.

====Rowing====
The lower river between Jesus Lock and Baits Bite Lock is the training and racing home of the Cambridge University Combined Boat Clubs&#x27; university and college, and the Cambridgeshire Rowing Association&#x27;s town, rowing teams. The Cambridge Lent, May and Town Bumps rowing races, where boats set off at regular intervals, and the object is to catch and touch (that is, &#x27;bump&#x27;) the boat in front, are held here.

====Sailing====
The Cam Sailing Club was founded in 1899. It is based at Clayhithe near Waterbeach and organises sailing races most weekends between March and November.

===Swimming===

Swimming on the upper river is popular in the summer, and people bathe at Grantchester Meadows all year round. Hardy bathers take part in the New Year&#x27;s Day swim.

==Navigation==

Cambridge had been an inland port due to its location on the River Cam prior to the draining of the Fens. As the university colleges rose in importance, the course of the river through the town, known as the Backs, was moved further to the east to accommodate their new buildings. A report conducted in 1618 by Richard Atkyns highlighted the problems caused by sandbanks above Clayhithe and watermills obstructing navigation. An order made by the parliamentary committee of the association in 1643 regulated use of the river for trade, but the biggest change was the construction of Denver Sluice on the River Great Ouse, which reduced river levels on the lower river as tidal waters were excluded from the Ouse. Both the university and the Corporation of Cambridge complained to Parliament in 1697 that the trade route to the town from King&#x27;s Lynn had been severely impaired.

In 1699, the corporation sought to obtain an act of Parliament which would allow them to improve the river from Clayhithe to Queens Mill at Cambridge. The River Cam Navigation Act 1702 (1 Ann. St. 2. c. 11) was obtained on 27 February 1702 and created the Conservators of the River Cam, a legal body with authority to charge tolls for use of the river, which ranged from four shillings (20p) a ton for wine to one penny (0.4p) per person for passengers. The conservators, of which there were a maximum of eleven, had powers to mortgage the tolls, in order to raise capital for improvements to the river immediately. This they did, and built sluices at Jesus Green, Chesterton, Baits Bite and Clayhithe. Most of the tolls were collected at Clayhithe.

Prior to 1722, Denver sluice had been destroyed, and although Cambridge Corporation opposed its reconstruction, it was rebuilt by 1750. The river entered a period of steady profitability, with toll receipts rising from £432 in 1752 to over £1,000 by 1803. In 1835 they peaked at £1,995, and then declined slightly until 1846. The conservators also raised some revenue from rents on the public houses which they owned adjacent to each of the sluices. Another act of Parliament, the River Cam Navigation Act 1813 (53 Geo. 3. c. ccxiv), was obtained on 21 July 1813 which allowed the Conservators to alter the tolls and charge penalties, while the South Level Act 1827 (7 &amp; 8 Geo. 4. c. xlvii) created Commissioners who had responsibility for the river below Bottisham. This act also appointed the vice-chancellor of the university and the mayor as navigation commissioners. The conservators built locks at Baits Bite and Bottisham, and removed the sluice at Chesterton.

The river was sufficiently profitable that the conservators were able to contribute £400 towards the cost of rebuilding the Great Bridge, now called the Magdalene Bridge, in 1823, and a further £300 for the rebuilding of the Small Bridge, now Silver Street Bridge, in 1841. A year later they constructed a house at Clayhithe, which cost £880, and included a large room for meetings and banquets. Just three years later the Eastern Counties Railway reached Cambridge, and the navigation declined rapidly. Receipts dropped from £1,393 in 1846 to £367 in 1850, and were just £99 in 1898. Most commercial carrying on the river had stopped by World War I, although Banhams operated two steam tugs and three barges until the late 1930s, carrying gas water from Cambridge Gasworks to King&#x27;s Lynn, where it was used in the manufacture of fertiliser. The last recorded passenger services had ceased nearly 100 years earlier, in 1839 and were started again in 2008 with the passenger vessel moored on Jesus Green.

Traffic using the river today consists of private cruisers making the journey to Jesus Lock, with the section above Baits Bite lock regularly in use by the University rowing clubs, both for practice and for races. Motorised craft can navigate along the Backs in winter, but headroom is severely restricted. The Conservators of the River Cam now have an office in the former lock-keepers cottage at Baits Bite, while the house at Clayhithe is now the residence of the foreman of the conservators. The conservators are still responsible for the river above Bottisham lock, while the lower river has been managed by the Environment Agency since its creation in 1995.

The three locks are all of different sizes. Bottisham and Baits Bite locks are both fully automated, with a vertical guillotine gate at the upstream end and traditional mitre gates at the downstream end. Jesus lock is manually operated, and has mitre gates at both ends. Boat sizes are restricted to by the length of Bottisham lock, and to by the width of Baits Bite lock. Jesus lock is only wide. The navigable lodes of Reach, Swaffham Bulbeck and Bottisham, the last of which is no longer navigable, can be reached from the River Cam.

==Flooding==
The Cam is normally a placid river but flooding does occasionally happen. The most recent serious floods were in 2001, first in February and again on 22–23 October, and then in February 2009.

The Environment Agency is responsible for managing water levels and issuing flood warnings for the entire river.

<text>A cross-flow turbine, Bánki-Michell turbine, or Ossberger turbine is a water turbine developed by the Australian Anthony Michell, the Hungarian Donát Bánki and the German Fritz Ossberger. Michell obtained patents for his turbine design in 1903, and the manufacturing company Weymouth made it for many years. Ossberger&#x27;s first patent was granted in 1933 (&quot;Free Jet Turbine&quot; 1922, Imperial Patent No. 361593 and the &quot;Cross Flow Turbine&quot; 1933, Imperial Patent No. 615445), and he manufactured this turbine as a standard product. Today, the company founded by Ossberger which bears his name is the leading manufacturer of this type of turbine.

Unlike most water turbines, which have axial or radial flows, in a cross-flow turbine the water passes through the turbine transversely, or across the turbine blades. As with a water wheel, the water is admitted at the turbine&#x27;s edge. After passing to the inside of the runner, it leaves on the opposite side, going outward. Passing through the runner twice provides additional efficiency. When the water leaves the runner, it also helps clean it of small debris and pollution. The cross-flow turbine is a low-speed machine that is well suited for locations with a low head but high flow. 

Although the illustration shows one nozzle for simplicity, most practical cross-flow turbines have two, arranged so that the water flows do not interfere.

Cross-flow turbines are often constructed as two turbines of different capacity that share the same shaft. The turbine wheels are the same diameter, but different lengths to handle different volumes at the same pressure. The subdivided wheels are usually built with volumes in ratios of . The subdivided regulating unit, the guide vane system in the turbine&#x27;s upstream section, provides flexible operation, with 33, 66 or 100 % output, depending on the flow. Low operating costs are obtained with the turbine&#x27;s relatively simple construction.

==Details of design==
The turbine consists of a cylindrical water wheel or runner with a horizontal shaft, composed of numerous blades (up to 37), arranged radially and tangentially. The blade&#x27;s edges are sharpened to reduce resistance to the flow of water. A blade is made in a part-circular cross-section (pipe cut over its whole length). The ends of the blades are welded to disks to form a cage like a hamster cage and are sometimes called &quot;squirrel cage turbines&quot;; instead of the bars, the turbine has the trough-shaped steel blades.

The water flows first from the outside of the turbine to its inside. The regulating unit, shaped like a vane or tongue, varies the cross-section of the flow. The water jet is directed towards the cylindrical runner by nozzle. The water enters the runner at an angle of about 45/120 degrees, transmitting some of the water&#x27;s kinetic energy to the active cylindrical blades.
The regulating device controls the flow based on the power needed, and the available water. The ratio is that (0–100%) of the water is admitted to 0-100%×30/4 blades. Water admission to the two nozzles is throttled by two shaped guide vanes. These divide and direct the flow so that the water enters the runner smoothly for any width of opening. The guide vanes should seal to the edges of the turbine casing so that when the water is low, they can shut off the water supply. The guide vanes therefore act as the valves between the penstock and turbine. Both guide vanes can be set by control levers, to which an automatic or manual control may be connected. 

The turbine geometry (nozzle-runner-shaft) assures that the water jet is effective. The water acts on the runner twice, but most of the power is transferred on the first pass, when the water enters the runner. Only of the power is transferred to the runner when the water is leaving the turbine.

The water flows through the blade channels in two directions: outside to inside, and inside to outside. Most turbines are run with two jets, arranged so two water jets in the runner will not affect each other. It is, however, essential that the turbine, head and turbine speed are harmonised.

The cross-flow turbine is of the impulse type, so the pressure remains constant at the runner.

==Advantages==
The peak efficiency of a cross-flow turbine is somewhat less than a Kaplan, Francis or Pelton turbine. However, the cross-flow turbine has a flat efficiency curve under varying load. With a split runner and turbine chamber, the turbine maintains its efficiency while the flow and load vary from 1/6 to the maximum. 

Since it has a low price, and good regulation, cross-flow turbines are mostly used in mini and micro hydropower units of less than one thousand kW and with heads less than .

Particularly with small run-of-the-river plants, the flat efficiency curve yields better annual performance than other turbine systems, as small rivers&#x27; water is usually lower in some months. The efficiency of a turbine determines whether electricity is produced during the periods when rivers have low flows. If the turbines used have high peak efficiencies, but behave poorly at partial load, less annual performance is obtained than with turbines that have a flat efficiency curve. 

Due to its excellent behaviour with partial loads, the cross-flow turbine is well-suited to unattended electricity production. Its simple construction makes it easier to maintain than other turbine types; only two bearings must be maintained, and there are only three rotating elements. The mechanical system is simple, so repairs can be performed by local mechanics.

Another advantage is that it can often clean itself. As the water leaves the runner, leaves, grass etc. will not remain in the runner, preventing losses. Therefore, although the turbine&#x27;s efficiency is somewhat lower, it is more reliable than other types. No runner cleaning is normally necessary, e.g. by flow inversion or variations of the speed. Other turbine types are clogged more easily, and consequently face power losses despite higher nominal efficiencies.

<doc id="150256" wikidata="Q7337563" url="?curid=150256" title="River Lark">
<text>The River Lark crosses the border between Suffolk and Cambridgeshire in England. It is a tributary of the River Great Ouse, and was extended when that river was re-routed as part of drainage improvements. It is thought to have been used for navigation since Roman times, and improvements to its navigability were made in 1638 and in the early 18th century, when locks and staunches were built. Special powers to improve the river from Mildenhall to Bury St Edmunds were granted by statute (River Lark Act 1698). The upper terminus was on the northern edge of Bury St Edmunds, but a new dock was opened near the railway station after the Eastern Union Railway opened its line in 1846.

The navigation was officially abandoned in 1888, but despite this, commercial use of the river continued until 1928. Following an acquisition by the Great Ouse Catchment Board, locks at Barton Mills and Icklingham were rebuilt in the 1960s, but were isolated when the A11 road bridge was lowered soon afterward. It now has one operational lock at Isleham, and can be navigated to Jude&#x27;s Ferry.

Water quality in the river was generally moderate in 2016, although there was a section where the quality was bad, the lowest rating given by the Environment Agency, who monitor English rivers. The river hosts a large population of signal crayfish, an invasive species which has increased as the eel population has diminished.

==Course==
Rising at Bradfield Combust, to the south of Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, it flows through Bury, Mildenhall and Prickwillow, and joins the Great Ouse south of Littleport in Cambridgeshire. It is about long, of which is navigable.

The upper river is an important focus for prehistoric activity, particularly relating to the Neolithic enclosure at Fornham All Saints. This comprises a large causewayed enclosure, several ring features, and a long cursus.

Just above Barton Mills, a side weir connects the river to the start of the Cut-off Channel, a drain running from there to Denver along the south-eastern edge of the Fens, which was constructed in the 1950s and 1960s. During times of flood it carries the headwaters of the River Lark, the River Wissey and the Little Ouse to Denver Sluice on the River Great Ouse.

Below Barton Mills, the mill stream at Mildenhall marks the start of a footpath which follows the north bank of the river, passing Mildenhall Cricket Club, to Isleham, after which there are footpaths and drove roads on both sides of the river to its junction with the Great Ouse. There is a weir at King&#x27;s Staunch, after which comes Jude&#x27;s Ferry, the current head of navigation, where boats at least in length can be turned. A magnificent hoard of late Roman silver was discovered at nearby Thistley Green in 1942, and the 34 pieces, which included bowls, spoons, dishes and goblets, were declared to be Treasure trove and are now in the British Museum.
The stretch from Jude&#x27;s Ferry to Isleham includes several pill-boxes, which were constructed during World War II to defend against invasion. Above the start of the lock cut is a memorial to the famous Baptist preacher Charles Spurgeon, who was baptised in the river on 3 May 1850. The site, where a chain ferry once crossed the river, and another near the weir were used for public baptisms until 1970. Isleham itself has three pubs, all dating from the 17th century, some shops and a large marina. There was an outbreak of cholera here in the 1850s, when over 500 people were &quot;living in hollows&quot; as a result of poverty which affected many fenland villages. In medieval times, Isleham was an important port with three quays. Remains of a Roman villa and over 6,000 Bronze-Age artefacts, which are now in the Moyse&#x27;s Hall Museum at Bury St Edmunds, indicate that it has been a centre of occupation since antiquity.

From Isleham to Prickwillow, the river flows for almost in an artificial cut, thought to have been constructed by the Romans, and joined the River Great Ouse at Prickwillow until 1830. The Great Ouse was then diverted, and its old course occupied by the Lark. There are a number of pumping stations on the banks of this section, including the Lark Engine, which has been the main outlet for the drainage of the southern part of Burnt Fen since 1842. Many of the surrounding ditches once flowed into the river by gravity, but the draining of the fens has resulted in the land surface dropping, and the water must now be raised by up to from the ditches to the river. At Mile End, two pumping stations sit one above the other, indicating the progressive sinking of the land. Prickwillow is home to the Museum of Fen Pumping Engines, itself once a working pumping station, and now holding several engines which were used in the draining of the Fens.

Prickwillow vicarage also demonstrates the shrinking of the land. Its ground floor rooms were originally the cellars, and the two steps leading to the front door have been replaced by nine. Below Prickwillow, the river is crossed by the Ely to Norwich railway line. The final of the river&#x27;s course are quite straight, as the river flows through another artificial channel. At its junction with the Great Ouse, the channel is crossed by a road which was formerly the A10, which ran along the banks of the Great Ouse at this point on its route from Ely to Littleport, but this section has been bypassed by a new alignment of the road further to the west.

==Management==
The river is managed and maintained by the Environment Agency, from whom boat owners must obtain a licence in order to use the waterway. The Agency have designated the section from Sicklesmere through Bury St Edmunds and Fornham St Martin to Isleham as a Flood Warning Area.

==Navigation==
The Lark is thought to have been used by the Romans for the carriage of clunch, a building material quarried from pits near Isleham, and stone for the building of Bury St Edmunds Abbey was carried to the site along the river. The first records of plans to improve the river for navigation date from 1635, when Henry Lambe sought to make it navigable from the Ouse to Bury St Edmunds. Although his plans were approved by a commission, there was local opposition, and it was December 1637 before he was granted a licence from the King to complete the work. The River Lark Act 1698 (11 Will. 3. c. 22) was passed after having been pending for several years. By 1700, the upper reaches were again in disrepair, and Henry Ashley obtained powers to improve the river from Worlington to below Mildenhall Mill, and to make it navigable from there to East Gate bridge in Bury St Edmunds. In addition to a schedule of tolls for the carriage of commodities, special provision was made so that some coal could be carried without incurring tolls, to assist the poor of Bury St Edmunds, and &quot;gentlemen and persons of quality&quot; did not have to pay for the use of the river by pleasure boats.

Ashley built 14 staunches and 11 sluices, the latter almost certainly referring to pound locks. In 1716, tolls amounted to £475, although the work was unfinished, and Ashley estimated that a further £800 was required to complete it. Disputes with millers were recorded in 1720 and 1722, and ownership of the navigation was disputed on Ashley&#x27;s death. The Master of the Rolls gave it to Joshua and Joanna Palmer in 1742, but receipts were meagre, at around £267 per year, and the maintenance carried out was barely sufficient. Ownership had passed to their son, Ashley Palmer, by 1781, when the navigation made a profit of £274. In 1790, there were plans for a link from Bury St Edmunds to the River Stour at Mistley, which John Rennie surveyed, but it involved heavy engineering work, including a tunnel, and the estimated cost of £75,000 could not be raised. Palmer died in 1792, and the river was managed by Susanna Palmer, his widow.

The costs of maintenance were high, for in 1807 tolls of £1,348 were received, but profits were less than one third of that amount. Recognising that a large investment was needed to keep the river profitable, an attempt was made in 1817 to sell it to the Duke of Norfolk for £12,000, but this came to nothing. The original commissioners appointed under the act obtained in 1700 had failed to appoint any more commissioners, and so new commissioners were authorised by a further act of Parliament, the (57 Geo. 3. c. lxxi), with powers to raise the tolls to pay for the maintenance of the navigation. Little work was done, although a new lock and staunch were built at Isleham under provisions of the Eau Brink Act 1821 (1 &amp; 2 Geo. 4. c. lxiv). The South Level Commissioners, who had been formed by an act of Parliament obtained in 1827, took over control of the lower river, and re-routed it to join the new course of the Great Ouse which had been diverted into a cut to the west of its original route. Trade on the upper river was increasingly difficult, as a result of obstructions and shoals in the channel. The lighters used on the river often had to be partially unloaded at Prickwillow, to allow them to navigate the shallower sections.

Control of the river above Isleham was inherited by Sir Thomas Cullum when Susanna Palmer died. He rebuilt most of the locks and staunches in the 1830s, resulting in increased trade in coal and general merchandise which originated from Kings Lynn, but success was short lived, as the Eastern Union Railway opened a line from Ipswich to Bury St Edmunds in 1846, and decline was immediate. In the 1850s, with the Fornham to Bury section impassible, the Bury St Edmunds Navigation Company proposed a scheme to reopen the river to Bury railway station. Their prospectus stated that the Eastern Union Railway had been managing the river for seven years, but little changed, as they failed to raise a working capital of £20,000, and by the 1860s, the route above Mildenhall was ruined.

Abandonment of the river as a navigation was authorised by the Railway and Canal Traffic Act 1888. The River Arun in West Sussex was the only other river abandoned by this act. Despite this, the Eastern Counties Navigation and Transport Co Ltd bought the river from Lee Brook to Bury St Edmunds in 1890, made Tuddenham Mill Stream navigable, repaired locks and staunches on the main river, and re-opened it in September 1894. The company was bankrupt by December, and the Icklingham to Bury St Edmunds section closed again. Some trading continued on the lower reaches, but commercial carrying ceased after 1928. Ownership of the river passed to the Great Ouse Catchment Board with the passing of the Land Drainage Act 1930. They rebuilt Barton Mills and Icklingham locks in the 1960s, but the bridge carrying the A11 road at Barton Mills was lowered soon afterward, and the present head of navigation is at Jude&#x27;s Ferry.

==Ecology==
The Environment Agency assesses the water quality within the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the River Lark system was as follows in 2019.
Separate figures for the Lark downstream of Isleham are not available, and the final row covers the lower section of the Lark, parts of the River Great Ouse and a number of its other tributaries. The Hawstead to Abbey Gardens section deteriorated from poor quality in 2015 to bad in 2016. The Environment Agency have set a target for ensuring it is moderate by 2027. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) and perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS), neither of which had previously been included in the assessment.

The river hosts a large population of the invasive species, the signal crayfish. A study published in 2011 identified the decline in eels, which predate the crayfish, as the major factor in their dramatic increase.

==Points of interest==





There is a second, much shorter, River Lark also in Suffolk which flows into the River Deben at Martlesham.

<doc id="150257" wikidata="Q5441539" url="?curid=150257" title="Feigned madness">
<text>&quot;Feigned madness&quot; is a phrase used in popular culture to describe the assumption of a mental disorder for the purposes of evasion, deceit or the diversion of suspicion. In some cases, feigned madness may be a strategy—in the case of court jesters, an institutionalised one—by which a person acquires a privilege to violate taboos on speaking unpleasant, socially unacceptable, or dangerous truths.

== Modern examples ==

===To avoid responsibility===
* Vincent Gigante, American Mafia don, was seen wandering the streets of Greenwich Village, Manhattan in his bathrobe and slippers, mumbling incoherently to himself, in what he later admitted was an elaborate act.
* Allegedly, Shūmei Ōkawa, Japanese nationalist, on trial for war crimes after World War II.
* Garrett Brock Trapnell, a professional thief and confidence man, frequently pretended to be affected by schizophrenia or dissociative identity disorder in order to be sent to mental institutions rather than prison for his crimes. This strategy eventually failed when he was brought to trial for aircraft hijacking. He was later the subject of a book by Eliot Asinof, entitled &quot;The Fox Is Crazy Too&quot;.

===To examine the system from the inside===
Investigative journalists and psychologists have feigned madness to study psychiatric hospitals from within:
* American muckraker Nellie Bly; see &quot;Ten Days in a Mad-House&quot; (1887)
* The Rosenhan experiment in the 1970s also provides a comparison of life inside several mental hospitals.
* The Swedish artist Anna Odell created the project &quot;Okänd, kvinna 2009-349701&quot; to examine power structures in healthcare, the society&#x27;s view of mental illness and the victimhood imposed on the patient.

== Historical examples ==
* Lucius Junius Brutus, who feigned stupidity, causing the Tarquins to underestimate him as a threat until the time when he was able to drive the Roman people to insurrection.
* Ibn al-Haytham, also known as Alhazen, who was ordered by the sixth Fatimid Caliph, al-Hakim, to regulate the flooding of the Nile; he later perceived the insanity and futility of what he was attempting to do and, fearing for his life, feigned madness to avoid the Caliph&#x27;s wrath. The Caliph, believing him to be insane, placed him under house arrest rather than execute him for failure. Alhazen remained there until the Caliph&#x27;s death, thereby escaping punishment for his failure to accomplish a task that had been impossible from the beginning.
* Kamo, a Bolshevik revolutionary, successfully feigned madness when in a German prison in 1909, and then in a Russian prison in 1910.
* Ion Ferguson, an Irish psychiatrist in the British Army in a World War II German prisoner-of-war camp, successfully feigned madness to get himself repatriated. He also assisted two other prisoners in doing the same.
*Ephrem the Syrian, a prominent Christian theologian and writer of Christian literature, avoided presbyteral consecration by feigning madness because he thought he was unworthy of it.

==In fiction and mythology==
* Shakespeare&#x27;s Hamlet, who feigns madness in order to speak freely and gain revenge—possibly based on a real person; see Hamlet (legend).
* &quot;Madness in Valencia&quot; is a 1590s comedy by Lope de Vega in which the male lead gets himself into an asylum to escape prosecution for murder. Other characters also feign for love.
* Odysseus feigned madness by yoking a horse and an ox to his plow and sowing salt or plowing the beach. Palamedes believed that he was faking and tested it by placing his son, Telemachus right in front of the plow. When Odysseus stopped immediately, his sanity was proven.
* &quot;Feign madness but keep your balance&quot; is one of the Thirty-Six Stratagems
* &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, Randle McMurphy feigns insanity in order to serve out his criminal sentence in a mental hospital rather than a prison.
* In Henry IV by Luigi Pirandello, the main character feigns insanity.
* In Goodbyeee, the last episode of BBC sitcom &quot;Blackadder&quot;, Blackadder feigns madness to try to avoid being sent into battle.
*The protagonist of the film &quot;Shock Corridor&quot; is a journalist who fakes insanity in order to gain access to an institution.
* In &quot;Ricochet&quot;, Denzel Washington plays an assistant district attorney who feigns madness to catch a criminal by extraordinary means. He remarks: &quot;Going insane, it&#x27;s strangely liberating, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;
*Another notable example is &quot;Primal Fear&quot;, adapted from the William Diehl novel of the same name. In the film, Martin Vail (Richard Gere) defends a timid, young altar boy named Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton) accused of murdering an archbishop. Halfway through, Vail discovers Stampler has dissociative identity disorder, with one sociopathic personality called &quot;Roy,&quot; who was responsible for killing the Archbishop. However, after Stampler is released due to plea of insanity, Vail discovers Stampler faked the disorder in order to avoid execution. The film was Edward Norton&#x27;s debut, which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.
*Jose Manalo and Wally Bayola&#x27;s roles in &quot;Scaregivers&quot; feigned madness by eating peanut butter disguised as stool samples, which landed them in a mental facility.
*In &quot;Colditz&quot;, a British television series about prisoners-of-war in WWII Germany, Wing Commander George Marsh feigns madness as a way of escaping. He successfully convinces his captors that he is insane and is duly repatriated. But there is a twist: after his return to Britain, Marsh becomes genuinely insane.

<doc id="150259" wikidata="Q312167" url="?curid=150259" title="Meyer Lansky">
<text>Meyer Lansky (born Maier Suchowljansky; July 4, 1902 – January 15, 1983), known as the &quot;Mob&#x27;s Accountant&quot;, was an American organized crime figure who, along with his associate Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano, was instrumental in the development of the National Crime Syndicate in the United States.

A member of the Jewish mob, Lansky developed a gambling empire that stretched around the world. He was said to own points (percentages) in casinos in Las Vegas, Cuba, Miami, and New Orleans. Lansky had a strong influence with the Italian-American Mafia. He played a large role in the consolidation of the criminal underworld by introducing money laundering and offshore banking in 1932, used in the 1950s for cash from the heroin trade. The full extent of this role has been the subject of some debate, as Lansky himself denied many of the accusations against him.

Despite nearly 50 years as a member/participant in organized crime, Lansky was never found guilty of anything more serious than illegal gambling. He was one of the most financially successful gangsters in American history. Before he fled Cuba, Lansky was said to be worth an estimated (equivalent to $ million in ). When he died in 1983, his family learned that his estate was worth only around ().

==Early life==
Maier Suchowljansky was born on July 4, 1902, in Grodno, Russian Empire (now Belarus), to a Polish-Jewish family. When asked his native country, Lansky always responded &quot;Poland&quot;. In 1911, Lansky emigrated to the United States through the port of Odessa with his mother and brother Jacob, and joined his father (who had immigrated in 1909) living on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York.

Lansky met Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel when they were children. They became lifelong friends, as well as partners in the bootlegging trade, and together managed the Bugs and Meyer Mob, with its reputation as one of the most violent Prohibition gangs. Lansky was also close friends with Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano; the two met as teenagers when Luciano attempted to extort Lansky for protection money on his walk home from school. Luciano respected the younger boy&#x27;s defiant responses to his threats, and the two formed a lasting partnership. They later associated with veteran gangster Arnold Rothstein until his murder in 1928.

==Career==
===Gambling operations, 1929–1945===
Luciano had a vision to form a national crime syndicate in which the Italian, Jewish, and Irish gangs could pool their resources and turn organized crime into a lucrative business for all—an organization he founded after a conference in Atlantic City organized by himself, Lansky, Johnny Torrio, and Frank Costello in May 1929.

Also, as early as 1932, Lansky shifted money from illegal activities in New Orleans to Swiss offshore accounts. The Swiss secrecy law from 1934 sanctioned the money laundering by &quot;banks whose officials knew very well they were working for criminals&quot;. By 1936, Lansky had established gambling operations in Florida and Cuba. These gambling operations were founded upon two innovations:

* Lansky and his connections had the technical expertise to manage them effectively based upon Lansky&#x27;s knowledge of the mathematical odds of most popular wagering games.
* Mob connections and bribed law enforcement were used to ensure their establishments&#x27; legal and physical security from other crime figures and law enforcement.

There was also an absolute rule of integrity concerning the games and wagers made within their establishments. Lansky&#x27;s &quot;carpet joints&quot; in Florida and elsewhere were never &quot;clip joints&quot;, where gamblers were unsure whether the games were rigged. Lansky ensured that the staff administering the games were of high integrity.

===World War II involvement, 1938–1945===
In the 1930s, Lansky and his gang stepped outside their usual criminal activities to break up rallies held by the pro-Nazi German-American Bund. He recalled a particular rally in Yorkville, a German neighborhood in Manhattan, that he and 14 associates disrupted:
When Judge Nathan D. Perlman offered to pay Lansky for his services, he declined:I am a Jew, and I feel for the Jews in Europe who are suffering. They are my brothers.During World War II, Lansky was instrumental in helping the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI)&#x27;s Operation Underworld, in which the government recruited criminals to watch out for German infiltrators and submarine-borne saboteurs. Lansky helped arrange a deal with the government via a high-ranking United States Navy official that secured Luciano&#x27;s release from prison; in exchange, the Mafia provided security for the warships being built along the docks in New York Harbor. German submarines were sinking Allied ships in great numbers along the eastern seaboard and the Caribbean coast, and there was great fear of attack or sabotage by Nazi sympathizers. Lansky connected the ONI with Luciano, who reportedly instructed Joseph Lanza to prevent sabotage on the New York waterfront.

===The Flamingo Hotel, 1946–1947===
In 1946, Lansky convinced the Italian-American Mafia to put Siegel in charge of Las Vegas, and became a major investor in Siegel&#x27;s Flamingo Hotel. To protect himself from the type of prosecution that sent Al Capone to prison for tax evasion and prostitution, Lansky transferred his growing casino empire&#x27;s illegal earnings to a Swiss bank account, where anonymity was assured by the 1934 Swiss Banking Act. Lansky eventually bought an offshore bank in Switzerland, which he used to launder money through a network of shell and holding companies.

In 1946, Lansky attended a secret meeting in Havana to discuss Siegel&#x27;s management of the Flamingo Hotel, which was running far behind schedule and costing Siegel&#x27;s Mafia investors a great deal of money. The other bosses wanted to kill Siegel, but Lansky begged them to give his friend a second chance.

Despite this reprieve, Siegel continued to lose money on the Flamingo. A second meeting was then called. By the time the meeting occurred, the casino had turned a small profit. With Luciano&#x27;s support, Lansky convinced the other investors to give Siegel more time. When the hotel started losing money again, the other investors decided that Siegel was finished. It is widely believed that Lansky was compelled to give the final okay on eliminating Siegel due to his long relationship with him and his stature in the organization.

On June 20, 1947, Siegel was shot and killed in Beverly Hills, California. Twenty minutes later, Lansky&#x27;s associates, including Gus Greenbaum and Moe Sedway, walked into the Flamingo and took control of it. According to the FBI, Lansky retained a substantial financial interest in the Flamingo for the next 20 years. Lansky said in several interviews later in his life that if it had been up to him, &quot;Ben Siegel would be alive today&quot;.

Siegel&#x27;s death marked a power transfer in Vegas from New York&#x27;s Five Families to the Chicago Outfit. Although his role was considerably more restrained than in previous years, Lansky is believed to have both advised and aided Chicago boss Tony Accardo in initially establishing his hold.

===Cuba, 1946–1959===

After World War II, as a reward for his wartime service, Luciano&#x27;s sentence was commuted to time served. His release was conditioned on his agreeing not to contest the revocation of his American citizenship and accept deportation to his native Italy. After arriving in Italy, Luciano settled in Sicily. He secretly moved to Cuba, where he worked to resume control over Mafia operations. Luciano also ran a number of casinos in Cuba with the sanction of Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista. Upon discovering Luciano&#x27;s presence in Cuba and resumption of criminal activity, the U.S. government pressured Batista into deporting Luciano to Italy.

Batista and Lansky formed a renowned friendship and business relationship that lasted a decade. During a stay at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York in the late 1940s, it was mutually agreed that, in exchange for kickbacks, Batista would offer Lansky and the Mafia control of the country&#x27;s casinos and racetracks. Batista would open Havana to large-scale gambling, and his government would match, dollar for dollar, any hotel investment over , which would include a casino license. Lansky would put himself at the center of Cuba&#x27;s gambling operations. He immediately called on his associates to hold a summit in Havana.

The Havana Conference was held on December 22, 1946, at the Hotel Nacional. This was the first full-scale meeting of American underworld leaders since the Chicago meeting in 1932. Present were such figures as Joe Adonis, Albert &quot;The Mad Hatter&quot; Anastasia, Frank Costello, Joseph &quot;Joe Bananas&quot; Bonanno, Vito Genovese, Moe Dalitz, Thomas Luchese, from New York; Santo Trafficante Jr. from Tampa; Carlos Marcello from the New Orleans crime family; and Stefano Magaddino, Bonanno&#x27;s cousin from Buffalo. From Chicago there were Accardo and the Fischetti brothers, &quot;Trigger-Happy&quot; Charlie and Rocco Fischetti; and, representing the Jewish interest, Lansky, Dalitz and &quot;Dandy&quot; Phil Kastel from Florida.

The first to arrive was Luciano, who secretly traveled to Havana on a false passport. Lansky shared with the attendees his vision of a new Havana, profitable for those willing to invest the right sum of money. According to Luciano, the only attendee who ever recounted the events in any detail, he was appointed as kingpin for the mob, to rule from Cuba until such time as he could find a legitimate way back into the U.S. Entertainment at the conference was provided by, among others, Frank Sinatra, who had flown to Cuba with his friends, the Fischetti brothers.

In 1952, Lansky offered then-President of Cuba Carlos Prío Socarrás a bribe of to step down so Batista could return to power. Once Batista retook control of the government in a military coup in March 1952, he quickly put gambling back on track. Batista offered Lansky an annual salary of to serve as an unofficial gambling minister. By 1955, he had changed the gambling laws again, granting a gaming license to anyone who invested in a hotel or in a new nightclub. Unlike the procedure for acquiring gaming licenses in Vegas, this provision exempted venture capitalists from background checks. As long as they made the required investment, they were given public matching funds for construction, a ten-year tax exemption and duty-free importation of equipment and furnishings. The government would get for the license, plus a percentage of the profits from each casino. Cuba&#x27;s 10,000 slot machines, even the ones that dispensed small prizes for children at country fairs, were to be the province of Roberto Fernandez y Miranda, the brother of Batista&#x27;s wife, Marta Fernandez Miranda de Batista.

A Cuban army general and government sports director, Fernandez was also given the parking meters in Havana as an extra bonus. Import duties were waived on materials for hotel construction, and Cuban contractors with the right &quot;in&quot; made windfalls by importing much more than was needed and selling the surplus to others for hefty profits. It was rumored that besides the to get a license, sometimes more was required under the table. Periodic payoffs were requested and received by corrupt politicians.

Lansky set about reforming the Cabaret Montmartre, which soon became the &quot;in&quot; place in Havana. He also installed a casino at the Hotel Nacional, relying on Batista&#x27;s support.

===Cuban Revolution and flight to Bahamas (1959 and the 1960s)===
The 1959 Cuban Revolution and the rise of Fidel Castro changed the climate for mob investment in Cuba. On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1958, while Batista was preparing to flee to the Dominican Republic before settling permanently in Francoist Spain, where he died in exile in 1973, Lansky was celebrating the US$3 million he made in the first year of operations at his 440-room, US$8 million palace, the Habana Riviera. Many of the casinos, including several of Lansky&#x27;s, were looted and destroyed that night. Lansky fled on January 7 to the Bahamas. In Nassau the Bay Street Boys were ruling. On January 8, 1959, Castro and his revolutionaries took control of Havana, setting up a command post in the Hilton. The new Cuban president, Manuel Urrutia Lleó, took steps to close the casinos. In October 1960, Castro nationalized all the island&#x27;s hotel-casinos and outlawed gambling.

After the revolution, Lansky sought compensation for losses in Cuba from the U.S. government.

===Sexual blackmail and J. Edgar Hoover===
Lansky is credited with having &quot;controlled&quot; compromising pictures of a sexual nature featuring former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover with his longtime aide Clyde Tolson. In his book, &quot;Official and Confidential: The Secret Life of J. Edgar Hoover&quot;, Anthony Summers cites multiple primary sources regarding Lansky&#x27;s use of blackmail to gain influence with politicians, policemen and judges. One stage of the acquisition of blackmail materials was orgies held by late attorney and Hoover protégé Roy Cohn and liquor magnate Lewis Rosenstiel, who had lasting ties with the Mafia from his bootleg operations during Prohibition.

The 2019 release of FBI files on Lansky revealed extensive monitoring and investigation, which makes it harder to explain why Lansky was not pursued to conviction, unless he evaded it by blackmail. Cohn copied this model of blackmail to control politicians and evade conviction himself.

===Attempted emigration and trial (1970–72)===
In 1970, Lansky fled to Herzliya Pituah, Israel, to escape federal tax evasion charges in the United States. He was a strong sympathizer with Israel. At the time Israeli law did not permit the extradition of Israeli citizens, and under the Law of Return, any Jew could legally settle in Israel and naturalize. The Israeli government reserved the right to exclude Jews with a criminal past from settling in the country. Two years after his arrival, Lansky was deported back to the U.S. The federal government brought Lansky to trial with the testimony of loan shark Vincent &quot;Fat Vinnie&quot; Teresa. Lansky was acquitted in 1973.

==Personal life and death==
In 1929 Lansky married Anna Citron, with whom he had three children, before divorcing in 1946. In 1948 he married Thelma Schwarz.

Lansky retired in Miami and spent his last 10 years quietly at his home in Miami Beach, Florida. He died of lung cancer on January 15, 1983, aged 80.

===Equity===
On paper, Lansky was worth almost nothing at the time of his death. At the time, the FBI believed he left behind over in hidden bank accounts but it never found any money. This would be equivalent to $ in .

Lansky&#x27;s biographer Robert Lacey describes his financially strained circumstances in the last two decades of his life and his inability to pay for health care for his handicapped son, who eventually died in poverty. For Lacey, there was no evidence &quot;to sustain the notion of Lansky as king of all evil, the brains, the secret mover, the inspirer and controller of American organized crime&quot;. He concludes from evidence including interviews with the surviving members of the family that Lansky&#x27;s wealth and influence had been grossly exaggerated. His second wife&#x27;s granddaughter told the author T. J. English that at the time of his death in 1983, Lansky left only $57,000 in cash, equivalent to $ in terms. When asked in his later years what went wrong in Cuba, Lansky said, &quot;I crapped out&quot;. He told people he had lost almost every penny in Cuba and was barely getting by.

Hank Messick, a journalist for the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; who spent years investigating Lansky, said that the key to understanding Lansky lay with the people around him, &quot;Meyer Lansky doesn&#x27;t own property. He owns people&quot;. To him, the FBI, and Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, the reality was that Lansky had kept large sums of money in other people&#x27;s names for decades and that keeping very little in his own was nothing new to him.

In 2010, Lansky&#x27;s daughter Sandra publicly said that her father had transferred $15 million to his brother&#x27;s account sometime in the early 1970s, when Lansky was having problems with the IRS. How much money Lansky really had will probably never be known. Since the warming of relations between the U.S. and Cuba in 2015, Lansky&#x27;s grandson, Gary Rapoport, has been asking the Cuban government to compensate him for the confiscation of the Riviera hotel his grandfather built in Havana.

==In popular culture==
===In film===
* The character Hyman Roth, portrayed by Lee Strasberg, and certain aspects of the main character Michael Corleone from the film &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974), are based on Lansky. In fact, shortly after the premiere, Lansky phoned Strasberg and congratulated him on a good performance (Strasberg was nominated for an Oscar for his role), but added, &quot;You could&#x27;ve made me more sympathetic.&quot; Roth&#x27;s statement to Corleone that &quot;We&#x27;re bigger than U.S. Steel&quot; was similar to something Lansky told his wife while watching a news story on the Mafia. The character Johnny Ola, Roth&#x27;s right-hand man, was inspired by Lansky&#x27;s associate Vincent Alo. The character Moe Greene, a friend of Roth, is modeled on Bugsy Siegel. The film reflects that Lansky was denied the Right of Return to Israel and returned to the US to face criminal charges, but invented details regarding Roth&#x27;s attempts to bribe Latin American dictators for entry to their countries, as well as Roth&#x27;s ultimate fate.

<text>Larks are passerine birds of the family Alaudidae. Larks have a cosmopolitan distribution with the largest number of species occurring in Africa. Only a single species, the horned lark, occurs in North America, and only Horsfield&#x27;s bush lark occurs in Australia. Habitats vary widely, but many species live in dry regions. When the word &quot;lark&quot; is used without specification, it often refers to the Eurasian skylark &quot;(Alauda arvensis)&quot;.

==Taxonomy and systematics ==
The family Alaudidae was introduced in 1825 by the Irish zoologist Nicholas Aylward Vigors as a subfamily Alaudina of the finch family Fringillidae. Larks are a well-defined family, partly because of the shape of their . They have multiple scutes on the hind side of their tarsi, rather than the single plate found in most songbirds. They also lack a pessulus, the bony central structure in the syrinx of songbirds. They were long placed at or near the beginning of the songbirds or oscines (now often called Passeri), just after the suboscines and before the swallows, for example in the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union&#x27;s first check-list. Some authorities, such as the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union and the &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot;, adhere to that placement. However, many other classifications follow the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy in placing the larks in a large oscine subgroup Passerida (which excludes crows, shrikes and their allies, vireos, and many groups characteristic of Australia and southeastern Asia). For instance, the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union places larks just after the crows, shrikes, and vireos. At a finer level of detail, some now place the larks at the beginning of a superfamily Sylvioidea with the swallows, various &quot;Old World warbler&quot; and &quot;babbler&quot; groups, and others. Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that within the Sylvioidea the larks form a sister clade to the family Panuridae which contains a single species, the bearded reedling (&quot;Panurus biarmicus&quot;). The phylogeny of larks (Alaudidae) was reviewed in 2013, leading to the recognition of the arrangement below.

The genus level cladogram shown below is based on a molecular phylogenetic study of the larks by Per Alström and collaborators published in 2023. The subfamilies are those proposed by the authors. For two species the results conflict with the taxonomy published online in July 2023 by Frank Gill, Pamela Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC): the rusty bush lark (&quot;Mirafra rufa&quot;) and Gillett&#x27;s lark (&quot;Mirafra gilletti&quot;) were found to be embedded in the genus &quot;Calendulauda&quot;. Alström and collaborators proposed that the genus &quot;Mirafra&quot; should be split into four genera: &quot;Mirafra&quot;, &quot;Plocealauda&quot;, &quot;Amirafra&quot; and &quot;Corypha&quot;.

=== Extant genera===
The family Alaudidae contains 102 extant species which are divided into 24 genera: For more detail, see list of lark species.
=== Extinct genera===
* Genus &quot;Eremarida&quot; – (&quot;Eremarida xerophila&quot;)

==Description==

Larks, or the family Alaudidae, are small- to medium-sized birds, in length and in mass. The smallest larks are likely the &quot;Spizocorys&quot; species, which can weigh only around in species like the pink-billed lark and the Obbia lark, while the largest lark is the Tibetan lark.

Like many ground birds, most lark species have long hind claws, which are thought to provide stability while standing. Most have streaked brown plumage, some boldly marked with black or white. Their dull appearance camouflages them on the ground, especially when on the nest. They feed on insects and seeds; though adults of most species eat seeds primarily, all species feed their young insects for at least the first week after hatching. Many species dig with their bills to uncover food. Some larks have heavy bills (reaching an extreme in the thick-billed lark) for cracking seeds open, while others have long, down-curved bills, which are especially suitable for digging.

Larks are the only passerines that lose all their feathers in their first moult (in all species whose first moult is known). This may result from the poor quality of the chicks&#x27; feathers, which in turn may result from the benefits to the parents of switching the young to a lower-quality diet (seeds), which requires less work from the parents.

In many respects, including long tertial feathers, larks resemble other ground birds such as pipits. However, in larks the tarsus (the lowest leg bone, connected to the toes) has only one set of scales on the rear surface, which is rounded. Pipits and all other songbirds have two plates of scales on the rear surface, which meet at a protruding rear edge.

===Calls and song===
Larks have more elaborate calls than most birds, and often extravagant songs given in display flight. These melodious sounds (to human ears), combined with a willingness to expand into anthropogenic habitats—as long as these are not too intensively managed—have ensured larks a prominent place in literature and music, especially the Eurasian skylark in northern Europe and the crested lark and calandra lark in southern Europe.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
Male larks use song flights to defend their breeding territory and attract a mate. Most species build nests on the ground, usually cups of dead grass, but in some species the nests are more complicated and partly domed. A few desert species nest very low in bushes, perhaps so circulating air can cool the nest. Larks&#x27; eggs are usually speckled. The size of the clutch is very variable and ranges from the single egg laid by Sclater&#x27;s lark up to 6–8 eggs laid by the calandra lark and the black lark. Larks incubate for 11 to 16 days.

==In culture==
===Larks as food===
Larks, commonly consumed with bones intact, have historically been considered wholesome, delicate, and light game. They can be used in a number of dishes; for example, they can be stewed, broiled, or used as filling in a meat pie. Lark&#x27;s tongues are reputed to have been particularly highly valued as a delicacy. In modern times, shrinking habitats made lark meat rare and hard to come by, though it can still be found in restaurants in Italy and elsewhere in southern Europe.

===Symbolism===
The lark in mythology and literature stands for daybreak, as in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;the bisy larke, messager of day&quot;, and Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnet 29, &quot;the lark at break of day arising / From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven&#x27;s gate&quot; (11–12). The lark is also (often simultaneously) associated with &quot;lovers and lovers&#x27; observance&quot; (as in Bernart de Ventadorn&#x27;s Can vei la lauzeta mover) and with &quot;church services&quot;. These meanings of daybreak and religious reference can be combined, as in Blake&#x27;s &quot;Visions of the Daughters of Albion&quot;, into a &quot;spiritual daybreak&quot; to signify &quot;passage from Earth to Heaven and from Heaven to Earth&quot;. With Renaissance painters such as Domenico Ghirlandaio, the lark symbolizes Christ, with reference to John 16:16.

===Literature===
Percy Bysshe Shelley&#x27;s famed 1820 poem &quot;To a Skylark&quot; was inspired by the melodious song of a skylark during an evening walk.

English poet George Meredith wrote a poem titled &quot;The Lark Ascending&quot; in 1881.

In Mervyn Peake&#x27;s &quot;Titus Groan&quot;, first book of the &quot;Gormenghast&quot; trilogy, &quot;Swelter approache[s] [Lord Sepulchrave] with a salver of toasted larks&quot; during the reception following newborn Titus&#x27;s christening.

Canadian poet John McCrae mentions larks in his poem &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot;.

===Music===
English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams wrote a musical setting of George Meredith&#x27;s poem, completed in 1914. It was composed for violin and piano, and entitled &quot;The Lark Ascending - A Romance&quot;. The work received its first performance in December 1920. Soon afterwards the composer arranged it for violin and orchestra, in which version it was first performed in June 1921, and this is how the work remains best-known today.

The old Welsh folk song &quot;Marwnad yr Ehedydd&quot; (The Lark&#x27;s Elegy) refers to the death of &quot;the Lark&quot;, possibly as a coded reference to the Welsh leader Owain Glyndŵr.

The French-Canadian folk song &quot;Alouette&quot; refers to plucking feathers from a lark.

===Pet===
Traditionally, larks are kept as pets in China. In Beijing, larks are taught to mimic the voice of other songbirds and animals. It is an old-fashioned habit of the Beijingers to teach their larks 13 kinds of sounds in a strict order (called &quot;the 13 songs of a lark&quot;, Chinese: 百灵十三套). The larks that can sing the full 13 sounds in the correct order are highly valued, while any disruption in the songs will decrease their value significantly.

===Early awakening===
Larks sing early in the day, often before dawn, leading to the expression &quot;up with the lark&quot; for a person who is awake early in the day, and the term &quot;lark&quot; being applied to someone who habitually rises early in the morning.

<doc id="150262" wikidata="Q7337590" url="?curid=150262" title="River Little Ouse">
<text>The River Little Ouse, also known as the Brandon River, is a river in the east of England, a tributary of the River Great Ouse. For much of its length it defines the boundary between Norfolk and Suffolk.

It rises east of Thelnetham, close to the source of the River Waveney, which flows eastwards while the Little Ouse flows west. The village of Blo&#x27; Norton owes its name to the river: it was earlier known as &quot;Norton Bell-&#x27;eau&quot;, from being situated near this &quot;fair stream&quot;. In this area the river creates a number of important wetland areas such as at Blo&#x27; Norton and Thelnetham Fens, and areas managed by the Little Ouse Headwaters Project. The course continues through Rushford, Thetford, Brandon, and Hockwold before the river joins the Great Ouse north of Littleport in Cambridgeshire. The total length is about .

The river is navigable from the Great Ouse to a point above Brandon.

==Origins==
A distinctive feature of the headwaters of the Little Ouse and the Waveney is the valley in which they flow; the Little Ouse flows westwards while the Waveney flows eastwards. The valley is broad, cutting through boulder clay to the north and to the south, but is crossed by a flat sandy feature at Lopham Ford, between South Lopham, Norfolk and Redgrave, Suffolk. Here the two rivers rise, barely apart, at an altitude of around . The B1113 road crosses the valley on the sandy bank, known as The Frith, and which is the only crossing of the Norfolk border which is on dry land. To the east are the wetlands of Redgrave and Lopham Fens, while to the west is Hinderclay Fen. The whole area overlays a thick bed of chalk.

The geological features of a large through valley, but no large river, are unusual, and were first recorded by Rev. Osmond Fisher in 1868, a keen geologist who thought the features were related to glaciation, but failed to convince the geologists of the 1870s. More recently, Prof Richard West carried out a detailed field study of the area between 2002 and 2007, and his work was published by the Suffolk Naturalists&#x27; Society in 2009. He concluded that the valley was caused by the runoff from a large glacial lake, which eventually melted, leaving the valley as it is today, with the sands of the lake bed becoming the sands of the Breckland, a large area of gorse-covered sandy heath that spans the border between Norfolk and Suffolk.

The downstream end of the Little Ouse has changed much over the centuries. In the Fens and Norfolk Marshland, it was quite possible for the course of a river to change as the result of a flooding episode so it is not surprising to find that the Great Ouse used to enter The Wash by way of the Old Croft River, the Wellstream and Wisbech (the Ouse beach). The modern lower Great Ouse was then the lower part of the Little Ouse. On this occasion, the change was artificial. The 17th century drainers under Cornelius Vermuyden dug the Old Bedford River between the Great Ouse at Earith and what had hitherto been the Little Ouse at Denver. A link was made for the Great Ouse between Littleport and the Little Ouse at Brandon Creek, and both the drainage and the navigation were directed towards King&#x27;s Lynn rather than Wisbech.

==Route==
Rising near the B1113 from South Lopham to Redgrave, the fledgeling Little Ouse flows west, and is joined by a stream flowing northwards from the hamlets of Rickinghall and Botesdale, before passing through Hinderclay Fen. This was once a flourishing valley fen, and was a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), but the fen dried out as a result of changes to the river, made to improve drainage from surrounding agricultural land. Rare species died out, and the designation was removed in 1983, but recent action by the Little Ouse Headwaters Project has resulted in areas of wet fen being extended and species being reintroduced. They have been assisted in this by funding from the European Union. The river crosses Thelnetham Road, Blo&#x27; Norton as a ford, near which is Thelnetham windmill, a grade II* listed tower mill dating from 1819 and restored in the 1980s.

The course turns briefly to the north-west, and is crossed by the B1111 road to the south of Garboldisham. To the north of the bridge is Garboldisham windmill, a post mill dating from 1780. This is also a grade II* listed structure, although its sails and tiller beam are missing. Continuing westwards, the river passes to the south of Gasthorpe, with the ruined church of All Saints a little further to the south. It was abandoned before 1900, and now has no roof. Passing along the northern edge of Knettishall Heath Country Park, there are two weirs, after which the Peddars Way and Norfolk Coast Path cross on a footbridge. A minor road crosses at Rushford, where the bridge is a scheduled ancient monument, and another bridge carries the A1088 into Thetford, beyond which is a weir. The Black Bourn river joins from the south, and the combined flow turns to the north to reach Thetford. The border between Norfolk and Suffolk has followed the river for most of its course, but skirts to the west of Thetford.

As it approaches Thetford, the river passes through Nunnery Lakes Reserve, a nature reserve managed by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO). A series of deep pools were created in the 1970s when gravel and sand were extracted, and the site is now a haven for wildlife. The BTO have their main offices at the northern end of the site, near to Nuns Bridge Road, where there are three listed bridges, built on the line of Icknield Way, an ancient track thought to have been first used around 3000 BCE. The southernmost bridge, crossing the Little Ouse, dates from the late 18th century, and has two elliptical arches with a central cutwater. The central bridge has a single semi-circular arch, and was built of brick in the early 19th century. The northernmost crosses the River Thet, dates from the late 18th century, and has two elliptical arches, with splayed parapets and stone coping slabs. For many years there was an open-air swimming pool on the widened river just above Nuns Bridges, but this closed in the early 1970s amid growing concerns over pollution, when an indoor swimming pool was built to replace it, and opened in 1971.

===Below Thetford===
Below the pool site, the river is joined by the River Thet, where there is a network of channels, sluices and weirs, together with the remains of a water mill, dating from the early 19th century. The building is now used as a masonic lodge. As it threads its way through the town, the river is crossed by Town Bridge, a single elliptical cast iron span dating from 1829, and after it passes under the A11 Thetford Bypass, it is bordered by Thetford Forest. This is the largest manmade lowland forest in Britain, covering . There is a weir beyond the bridge, and the county border rejoins the river as it turns back towards the west. This section is easier to follow, as the St Edmund Way footpath runs along the north bank from the centre of Thetford, but leaves the river where the county boundary joins. The St Edmund Way continues to the north of the river, and the Little Ouse Path runs to the south. At Santon Downham, the Little Ouse Path continues along the north bank of the river, on the original towpath.

The footpath leaves the river just before the A1065 bridge at Brandon, but rejoins it soon afterwards. Brandon Lock follows, with the lock chamber to the north and a large weir to the south. The Ely to Norwich Railway line crosses from the north bank to the south, and there is a Romano-British settlement site on the north bank. It lies at one end of the Foss Ditch, a waterway dating from the Saxon period that ran for between the Little Ouse and the River Wissey, which may have been used for defence. The towpath stops following the river to the south of Hockwold cum Wilton, turning to the north. The river has been diverted from its original course, to cross the Cut-off Channel in a concrete aqueduct. Large guillotine sluices control whether the water is fed into the lower river or along the Cut-off Channel. As it rejoins its original course, it passes under Wilton Bridge, and there are footpaths on both sides, set back from the channel on flood banks.

To the south of the river are a series of washes, meres and wooded stretches. Parts of this area were formerly arable farmland, but were converted into the Lakenheath Fen wetland by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). The reedbeds and grazing marshes have attracted significant populations of reed warblers, sedge warblers, bearded tits, marsh harriers, and increasingly, bitterns. At the western end of the fens is Botany Bay, where water from Lakenheath Old Lode and the Twelve Foot Drain is pumped into the river. A little further on is the confluence with another drain, called Lakenheath New Lode.

The final of the river follow a relatively straight course which heads north-west to join the River Great Ouse at Brandon Creek. The channel is man-made, and probably dates from the Roman period. Prior to its construction, the river continued due west, and joined the Great Ouse near Old Bank Farm. Its dry raised bed, known locally as a rodham, can easily be traced in the landscape, as its light-coloured bands of silt contrast with the dark, low-lying peat soils. It is also clearly shown on the modern Ordnance Survey map, delineated by the 0 ft contour. On the river channel, there is a pumping station on the north bank, and the course passes between the hamlets of Brandon Bank on the north bank and Little Ouse on the south. Nearby is the lowest trig point in Britain, marking a spot which is below sea level. Its junction with the Great Ouse is immediately after it passes under the A10 road.

==Flood precautions==
The Environment Agency has designated the section from Thetford to Brandon, where it flows through the afforested Breckland, as a Flood Warning Area.

The lower part of the river crosses over the Cut-off Channel in a concrete aqueduct. The Channel is a drain which runs from Barton Mills to Denver along the south-eastern edge of the Fens, and was constructed in the 1950s and 1960s. During times of flood it carries the head waters of the River Lark, the River Wissey and the Little Ouse to Denver Sluice. On its east side are two sluices, so that flood water from the upper river can be diverted into the Cut-off Channel and the section between there and the Great Ouse isolated. The flood banks on this lower section are up to half a mile (0.8 km) apart, so that the meandering river can form a large lake.

Nearer the mouth of the river, the Brandon Engine was the main outlet for the drainage of the northern half of Burnt Fen from 1830 until 1958. The original steam engine was replaced in 1892, by a new engine that could pump 75 tons per minute. That engine was replaced by a 250 horse power oil engine in late 1925, supplied by Blackstone and Company, which drove a Gwynne rotary pump. The pump could discharge 150 tons per minute against a head of , and lasted for 30 years. When a replacement was considered in the 1950s, the Commissioners of the Burnt Fen were faced with the problem that the White House Drain which supplied it had become bigger and more unstable as the ground surface had shrunk, and the engine sat at the top of a hill, rather than at the lowest point on the northern Fen. Consequently, a new electric pumping station was constructed at Whitehall on the River Great Ouse, the flow in the drain reversed, and the pumping station decommissioned.

==Navigation==

The river is currently navigable for from its junction with the River Great Ouse to Santon Downham bridge. There are references to its use by boats carrying goods to Brandon as early as the 13th century, and barges are known to have reached Thetford, some beyond Santon Downham when the river was tidal. Stone from Barnack, used in the construction of Thetford Priory in the 12th century, was almost certainly moved along the river, and improvements to the channel were authorised by the Commissioners of Sewers as early as 1575. Further documentary evidence confirms that it was navigable as far as Thetford in 1664.

However, water levels dropped when Denver Sluice was built on the River Great Ouse. An Act of Parliament authorised the Corporation of Thetford to make improvements to the river in 1670, but they were unable to carry out the work, and so the Rt Hon Henry, Earl of Arlington made the improvements, and was assigned the tolls as a result. A series of staunches were built, to hold back the water and raise the levels, but they were too far apart to be effective. The rights of the navigation were given to Thetford Corporation by Henry&#x27;s daughter Isabella in 1696, and the Corporation had to build a new staunch near Thetford in 1742, in order to maintain water levels in the town.

By 1750, disputes were arising, since all the original Commissioners were dead, and they had failed to appoint replacements. A new Act of Parliament was sought and obtained in 1751, which appointed new Commissioners. Immediately, Thetford Corporation made improvements to the river, constructing staunches at Thetford, Thetford Middle, Turfpool, Croxton, Santon, Brandon and Sheepwash. An eighth staunch was built later at Crosswater, where Lakenheath Lode joins the river. Staunches consisted of a gate or gates across the river, which held back the water above it, to enable boats to float over shallow sections. Their disadvantage was that the river level had to be lowered by a sluice to allow the gate to be opened. They are all labelled &quot;Stanch&quot; on the 1905 Ordnance Survey map. A further Act was obtained in 1789, which regularised the collection of tolls on the whole river by Thetford Corporation. They rebuilt the seven staunches between 1827 and 1835, and the £955 of income received from the navigation in 1833 accounted for over 90 per cent of the total income of the Corporation.

The 1770s saw a grand plan to build a canal from the Little Ouse at Thetford to the River Stort at Bishops Stortford. With a spur to Cambridge, this would have enabled goods to reach London by canal from much of East Anglia. Although the capital cost could not be justified, it was not until the 1850s and the advent of the railways that the scheme was finally abandoned.

Tolls reached a record £1,728 in 1845, when over 15,000 tonnes of coal were carried, but the arrival of the railways, in the form of a line from Norwich to Brandon, and an extension of the Eastern Counties Railway from Newport to Brandon, both opened on the same day in 1845, started the rapid decline of the navigation. Tolls had fallen to £439 by 1849. The tolls were leased to private individuals from 1850, but an attempt to transfer £320 to the Council finance committee from the navigation in 1859 resulted in nearly a year of legal wrangling, and ultimately the money was repaid in 1860. The state of the navigation declined steadily, although there was still commercial traffic, and a paddle steamer ran trips to Cambridge and around the local waterways in the 1880s.
Repairs were again necessary in the 1890s, but with no funds available, the navigation committee asked Fisons, who ran a screw tug called &quot;Speedwell&quot; to tow lighters to King&#x27;s Lynn, for an advance on their tolls to fund the work. This arrangement continued, and kept the navigation open for some years. When Henry de Salis visited it in 1904, he reported that most of the staunches were out of order, and that it was in poor condition. The Bedford Level Commissioners kept the weed removed from the lower section, and the South Level Commissioners maintained Crosswater Staunch, but commercial traffic had ceased by the start of the First World War. Responsibility for the river passed to the Great Ouse Catchment Board with the passing of the Land Drainage Act 1930, and they removed the staunches, replacing those at Thetford and at Brandon with sluices. Responsibility changed again with the formation of the Environment Agency in 1995.

The navigable river is mainly on the same level, with a single lock, which was opened in 1995, at Brandon just a short distance from Brandon bridge. The lock is wide but only long, and so is not suitable for many narrowboats, although boats up to long can be turned just below the lock, which is less than from Brandon village.

There is a campaign to re-open the river for navigation to Thetford, and the Environment Agency commissioned consultants in 2003 to look at the feasibility of such a project. The report suggested that four locks would be required on this section. The head of navigation was effectively extended in 2008 when the section from Brandon Bridge to Santon Downham was made more accessible to boaters by the construction of moorings just below Santon Downham bridge, which are now managed by the Great Ouse Boating Association. Beyond the bridge the river is only accessible to canoes and dingies, due to the presence of rocks on the river bed.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the River Little Ouse system was as follows in 2019.
The Environment Agency data for the upper river covers a short section of the Little Ouse, and a long section of the stream that flows northwards from Rickinghall and Botesdale. They have set a target for improving the water quality on this section from bad to poor by 2021. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) and perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS), neither of which had previously been included in the assessment.

<text>The River Wissey is a river in Norfolk, eastern England. It rises near Bradenham, and flows for nearly to join the River Great Ouse at Fordham. The lower are navigable. The upper reaches are notable for a number of buildings of historic interest, which are close to the banks. The river passes through the parkland of the Arts and Crafts Pickenham Hall, and further downstream, flows through the Army&#x27;s Stanford Training Area (STANTA), which was created in 1942 by evacuating six villages. The water provided power for at least two mills, at Hilborough and Northwold. At Whittington, the river becomes navigable, and is surrounded by fenland. A number of pumping stations pump water from drainage ditches into the higher river channel.

Although navigation is known to have taken place since at least the time of the Domesday Book, there is less documentary evidence than for other neighbouring rivers, as there was no centre of population at the head of the navigation. A sugar-beet factory was built on the banks in 1925 at Wissington, which could only be accessed by river or railway, and started a period of relative prosperity, which ended in 1943, when the first road to reach the factory was built. All use of the river is now by pleasure craft.

==Course==
The river is a tributary of the Great Ouse, rising at Shipdham, near East Bradenham in Norfolk, and flowing for nearly through Necton, North Pickenham, South Pickenham, Great Cressingham, Ickburgh, Northwold and Stoke Ferry before joining the Great Ouse south of Downham Market, specifically in the small parish of Fordham. Its course has altered, as it originally flowed to Wisbech, which derives its name from the river, and historically, it has also been known as the River Stoke or Stoke River. The source, to the north of Shipdham, is close to the contour, and is close to the source of the River Yare, which flows in the opposite direction.

===Upper reaches===
To the south of the stream is Manor Farm, a Grade II listed building dating from the sixteenth century, although extended and refaced over the following 200 years. Much of the original timber frame has been replaced by brick.
Associated with the farm are some ancient fishponds. The course continues to the west, passing the Grade I listed Huntingfield Hall farmhouse, again dating from the sixteenth century, but with nineteenth-century alterations, and then flowing along the northern edge of Bradenham. The parish church is separated from the main centre of population by the river. It is a medieval building, constructed of flint, ashlar masonry and brick, much of it dating from the fourteenth century, though parts are a little earlier. To the west of the village is a small sewage treatment plant, located on the south bank, after which it passes to the north of Holme Hale and to the south of Necton. It turns to the south to pass under Station Road at Erneford Bridge, close to Erneford House, which is constructed of colourwashed bricks with a pantile roof and dates from 1700. It passes under a disused railway bridge, and continues to the east of North Pickenham, where the parish church of St Andrew was substantially rebuilt in 1863, but retains its earlier tower and north transept.

At South Pickenham, the river passes through the parkland of Pickenham Hall, which covers an area of . It is marked on Faden&#x27;s county map of 1797, and was extended in the mid-nineteenth century. Much of it is grassland with ancient oaks. are laid out as gardens and pleasure grounds, leading down to the river, which has been widened at this point. A rustic oak bridge dating from the early 1900s links the gardens to the park. The hall itself was built between 1902 and 1905 by the Arts and Crafts architect Robert Weir Schultz for the banker G W Taylor. The previous house, dating from around 1830, could not be preserved, as it was found to be unstable during the rebuild. At Great Cressingham, the former manor house sits on the east bank. It is Grade I listed, and includes moulded brick monograms belonging to John and Elizabeth Jenny, who bought the house in 1542. Turning briefly to the south-west, Home Lane crosses the river by a ford at Hilborough. To the south of the hamlet is Hilborough Mill and the miller&#x27;s house, dating from 1819. Most of the machinery is still in place, although the paddles are missing from the cast iron waterwheel.

Further south is Bodney Hall farmhouse, which dates from the sixteenth century, with alterations made in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. There are ancient fish ponds marked on the Ordnance Survey map. The river then passes through a danger area, which is used by the army for training purposes. During the Second World War, the area was the location of RAF Bodney. The river passes Langford Church, a Grade I listed medieval building containing a monument to Sir Nicholas Garrard, which was designed by Christopher Horsnaile senior in baroque style in 1727. The windows are covered with corrugated iron sheets, because the building is within the Army&#x27;s Stanford Training Area. A tributary, which rises near Merton and flows through a large lake called Stanford Water, joins the Wissey from the east. The nearby village of Stanford was one of six evacuated to make way for the Stanford Training Area in 1942.

Beyond the junction, the river turns to the west, and passes gravel pits near Ickburgh. Near the bridge under the A1065 road is Bridge House, remodelled as a pair of semi-detached houses in the nineteenth century, but still containing parts of the original leper chapel dating from the thirteenth century. Passing to the north of Mundford, the channel turns to the north-west, and passes between the lakes of Didlington Hall on the north bank and those formed by sand and gravel extraction to the south. Two sluices mark the location of Northwold watermill, which was demolished some time after 1938. The River Gadder, which rises to the north-east of Cockley Cley, and its distributary, the Oxborough Drain, enter the Wissey on its north bank. To the north of Whittington, there is a disused pumping station by the junction with the Stringside Drain, and the river becomes navigable. It is now just above sea level.

===Lower reaches===

The Stringside Drain flows into the river from the north, just upstream from the A134 bridge at Whittington. This forms the present head of navigation, as boats up to at least can use the junction to turn round. Below the bridge, a wharf served the maltings owned by Whitbread in the 19th century. A footpath runs along the northern bank of the river, and is in good condition from Whittington to Wissington. Stoke Ferry, with its fine windmill sits close to the northern bank of the river, protected from it by flood banks. Below the village is the junction with the Cut-off Channel, a drain running from Barton Mills on the River Lark to Denver along the south-eastern edge of the Fens, which was constructed in the 1950s and 1960s. During times of flood it carries the head waters of the River Lark, the Little Ouse and the River Wissey to Denver Sluice on the River Great Ouse. A guillotine sluice isolates the main channel of the river when flood water is diverted into the Cut-off Channel, and the river then passes over the channel in a concrete aqueduct.

Close to the junction is a pumping station which pumps water from the river to the Stoke Ferry drinking water treatment works. The United Kingdom&#x27;s first two-way enclosed fish pass was installed in 2012 to enable fish to negotiate the flood defenses, and reach spawning grounds further upstream. It was funded by the Environment Agency, while Anglian Water supply the energy to operate it from the treatment works. It is similar in design to many in the Netherlands, but the siphon has been modified to enable a wider variety of fish species to use it.

Methwold Lode flows in from the south, and the river is then constrained by wide flood banks on both sides of the river. Wissington bridge is relatively new, as there was no road access to the sugar-beet factory below it when it was built in 1925. The road to the factory has since been bypassed, with the newer bridge providing more headroom than the old. At Hilgay, the Cut-off Channel passes very close to the river, with Snowre Hall, a 15th-century building containing some of the earliest domestic brickwork in England on its northern bank.

Hilgay, the largest village on the river, sits on a raised isle, some above the surrounding fenland. Its elevation has become more pronounced as the draining of the fenland has caused the ground to shrink. It was notable in Saxon and early Norman times for the large numbers of fish and eels found there. Hilgay Old Bridge still crosses the river, but the newer A10 bypass also crosses just below it. The final landmark before the junction with the Great Ouse is the railway bridge carrying the Ely to King&#x27;s Lynn line over the river.

The river below Whittington passes through fenland, and is embanked to separate it from the lower-lying land on either side. Drainage of the land is managed by internal drainage boards (IDBs), and there are several pumping stations which pump water from drainage ditches into the river channel. Land to the north of the river from Stringside Drain to its mouth is managed by the Stoke Ferry Internal Drainage Board. To the south, the area from Whittington to the Methwold Drain is managed by the Northwold IDB, and from there to the mouth is managed by the Southery and District IDB. They control a much larger area, and the southern border of the IDB is formed by the River Little Ouse.

==History==
The &quot;ey&quot; part of the name means &quot;river&quot; thus the name is tautological. Documentary evidence for the history of the river is scarce, compared to the neighbouring River Lark and River Little Ouse, both of which had a sizeable town at the head of navigation, whereas the Wissey does not. The Wissey is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, when it was navigable from &quot;Oxenburgh&quot; to King&#x27;s Lynn and Cambridge, and there are remains of a medieval settlement near the river at Oxborough Ferry. It was mentioned in 1575, when the Commissioners of Sewers, meeting at King&#x27;s Lynn, ruled that it should be cleared and made wider between Stokebridge and Whittington, and that the bridge at Stoke Ferry should be repaired. This bridge was contentious, as the Abbot of Ely lost the ferry tolls when it was built. He destroyed it, to protect his income, but was required to re-instate it by the Hundred Court.

There were wharfs at Oxborough Hithe in the 1750s, handling trade in coal and grain, and evidence of boathouses further upstream at Northwold. The only Act of Parliament which covered the Wissey was passed in 1814, and this was more concerned with drainage than with navigation. Commissioners were appointed, who had responsibility for drainage in the parishes of Northwold, Stoke Ferry, Wereham, West Dereham and Wretton. They were empowered to widen the river between Hilgay Creek&#x27;s End and Stoke Bridge, with the cost being borne by local landowners. They could also levy tolls on anyone using the north bank, although they could only use such tolls to repair the bank.

Trade continued to the wharf at Oxborough Hithe and to another at Stoke Ferry until at least 1858, and may have continued for years afterwards, as the railway from Denver did not arrive until 1882. A barge called &quot;Wissey&quot; was operated by J Coston from Hilgay, which was known to have reached Cambridge in 1896 and 1898. In the 1930s, A Jackson was trading corn from Stoke Ferry, while one of the busiest times for the river was between 1925 and 1943. Wissington sugar-beet factory was opened in 1925, and until 1941 could only be reached by river or by the Wissington Light Railway, which crossed the river at the western edge of the factory. The site was then requisitioned by the Ministry of Agriculture who used Italian prisoners of war to refurbish the railway and construct roads to the factory. Three tugs, named &quot;Hilgay&quot;, &quot;Littleport&quot; and &quot;Wissington&quot; were used to pull a fleet of 24 steel barges, which were used to take the beet to King&#x27;s Lynn during the winter months and to bring coal in the reverse direction during the summer.

==Points of interest==




==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the River Wissey was as follows in 2019.
The reasons for the water quality being less than good include discharge from sewage treatment works, runoff of nutrients from agricultural land, and physical modification of the channel, which inhibits the free movement of fish in particular. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) and perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS), neither of which had previously been included in the assessment.

<text>Colditz () is a small town in the district of Leipzig, in Saxony, Germany. It is best known for Colditz Castle, the site of the Oflag IV-C POW camp for officers in World War II.

==Geography==
Colditz is situated in the Leipzig Bay, southeast of the city of Leipzig. The town centre is located on the banks of Zwickau Mulde river, south of its confluence with the Freiberg Mulde. The municipality had a population of 8,374 in 2020.

The town Colditz consists of Colditz proper and the &quot;Ortsteile&quot; (divisions) Bockwitz, Collmen, Commichau, Erlbach, Erlln, Hausdorf, Hohnbach, Kaltenborn, Koltzschen, Lastau, Leisenau, Maaschwitz, Meuselwitz, Möseln, Podelwitz, Raschütz, Schönbach, Sermuth, Skoplau, Tanndorf, Terpitzsch, Zollwitz, Zschadraß, Zschetzsch and Zschirla.

==History==

The first record of a burgward on the Mulde river, called &quot;Cholidistcha&quot;, dates to the year 1046, when Emperor Henry III dedicated it to his consort Agnes of Poitou. The name is possibly of Slavic origin.

In 1083, Henry&#x27;s son and successor Henry IV recommended that his follower Count Wiprecht of Groitzsch build a castle on the cliff above the river. From 1158, under the rule of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, the fortress became the residence of the noble House of Colditz, a dynasty of &quot;ministeriales&quot; in the Imperial Pleissnerland territory. In the 12th century, merchant houses were built around a marketplace below the castle and St. Nicholas&#x27; Church was built. In 1265, the Colditz citizens were granted town privileges by the ruler.

In 1243, the former Imperial estates were pledged to the Wettin margrave Henry III of Meissen. His grandson, Margrave Frederick I of Meissen occupied Colditz Castle in 1309. The whole lordship was finally incorporated into the Margravate of Meissen by 1404. Merged into the Electorate of Saxony from 1423, Colditz was held by Elector Ernest upon the 1485 Treaty of Leipzig.

In 1504, the local baker accidentally set Colditz on fire, and the city hall, church, castle and a large part of the town went up in flames. In 1506, reconstruction began and new buildings were raised around the rear castle courtyard. After the defeat of Elector John Frederick I of Saxony in the Schmalkaldic War of 1546–47, the town passed to his cousin Maurice. His descendants continued to rebuild Colditz Castle as a hunting lodge. From 1602 to 1622, it served as the residence of Dowager Electress Sophie, widow of Elector Christian I.

In the 17th century, the cloth and linen manufacture developed. In the 18th century, clay from the Colditz area started to be used in the Meissen porcelain factory that was established in 1710 by Elector Augustus the Strong. In 1804 a ceramics factory was established in Colditz by Thomsberger &amp; Hermann.
In the Nazi era, Colditz Castle was temporarily used as a concentration camp by the SA and as a &quot;Reichsarbeitsdienst&quot; camp. During the Second World War, the town did not suffer any damage. In 1940, the town became the headquarters of the German military district Wehrkreis IV for personnel guarding an &quot;Oflag&quot; POW camp for officers, when Oflag IV-C was established in the castle. It became widely known after the war, for both its notable inmates (&quot;Prominente&quot;), such as Giles Romilly or George Lascelles, and several escape attempts.

On 14April 1945, the U.S. Army entered the town and freed the prisoners. However, under agreements signed at the Yalta Conference, the Americans withdrew and were replaced by Soviet occupation forces late in June 1945. As a result, Colditz and the entire state of Saxony became part of East Germany. In 1958, the publicly owned porcelain factory was established. It produced a major part of the dishes used by Mitropa, as evident by the manufacturer&#x27;s logo &quot;cp&quot;. Both porcelain and chamotte industry went into decline after 1990.

Since German reunification in 1990, efforts have been made to increase visits by tourists. The castle was restored and has become a much visited museum. The great flood of August 2002 as well as the flood of 2013 caused some damage to the old town, but it has since been restored.

Traffic on the section of the Glauchau-Großbothen railway line, which ran through Colditz, ceased in 2000. Public transport is provided by buses, with services to Grimma, Leisnig, Hartha, Rochlitz, and Bad Lausick, as well as to several villages in the vicinity.

==Wartime dramatisations==
The story of the wartime prisoners at Oflag IV-C was documented by Patrick Robert (&quot;Pat&quot;) Reid in his books &quot;The Colditz Story&quot; and &quot;The Latter Days At Colditz&quot;, and the former was used as the basis for a 1955 film directed by Guy Hamilton. In the early 1970s the BBC broadcast a series, &quot;Colditz&quot;, created by Brian Degas and Gerard Glaister, with Reid as technical advisor. 
In 1973 the TV comedy series The Two Ronnies shot a sketch &quot;Colditz&quot; featuring Ronnie Corbett in the role of the new detainee and Ronnie Barker as camp commandant.
Beginning in 1973 a board game Escape from Colditz was marketed by Parker Brothers, followed by a computer game in 1991.

<text>François Kevorkian (; born 10 January 1954), also known by the stage name François K, is a French DJ, producer, remixer and label owner of Armenian descent and based in the United States of America, who started his career DJing in clubs such as the Paradise Garage and Studio 54. Kevorkian has produced and remixed work by a diverse range of musicians including the Smiths, Adam Ant, Kraftwerk, Pet Shop Boys, Depeche Mode, Diana Ross, Gloria Estefan and U2, and is considered one of the forefathers of house music.

==Biography==
François Kevorkian () was born and raised in France, with Armenian heritage. He played the drums in his adolescent years. 

He moved to the United States in 1975. At that time the competition to be a drummer was very high, so around 1976 he became a DJ in underground clubs in New York City. DJing soon became his full-time occupation, including some work at more commercial venues such as the club New York, New York in 1977. He taught himself tape editing and started making disco medleys, such as Rare Earth&#x27;s &quot;Happy Song&quot;. He was offered a role in A&amp;R for a nascent dance independent record label, Prelude Records, which allowed him to go into the studio and do remixes. His first remix, of &quot;In The Bush&quot; by Musique, became a club and radio hit, and was followed by further hit remixes including &quot;You&#x27;re The One For Me&#x27; and &quot;Keep On&quot; by D-Train, and &quot;Beat The Street&quot; by Sharon Redd. He left Prelude in 1982, and in the same year had the most #1 singles on Billboard&#x27;s Dance Music Chart, including his remixes of tracks such as &quot;Situation&quot; by Yazoo, and &quot;Go Bang&quot; by Dinosaur L.

Kevorkian also performed as a DJ at Club Zanzibar in Newark, New Jersey during the 1980s, home to the &quot;Jersey Sound&quot; brand of deep house or garage house.

During this time he began building his own recording studio, Axis Studios, in the same building as Studio 54. The studio soon became a major commercial operation. He stopped DJing around 1983 to focus on recording and mixing full-time, but started again in early 1990. Due to the new international popularity of dance music, he gained exposure overseas and began performing abroad. He toured Japan with Larry Levan in 1992 on the &#x27;Harmony Tour&#x27; before Levan&#x27;s death in November that year, and also appeared at London&#x27;s Ministry of Sound and Fabric, Japan&#x27;s Spacelab Yellow, Ibiza&#x27;s Pacha and Space, Italy&#x27;s Angels of Love and many large festivals.

In 1995, he started an eclectic independent record label, Wave Music, on which he released his own work, including the &quot;FK-EP&quot;, as well as records by Abstract Truth, Floppy Sounds and other electronic music releases. In 1996, with partner John Davis, he launched Body&amp;SOUL, a weekly party held every Sunday afternoon at Club Vinyl, 6 Hubert Street, playing alongside co-resident DJs Joaquin &#x27;Joe&#x27; Claussell and Danny Krivit. The &#x27;Body&amp;SOUL&#x27; sound, a soulful mix of organic and spiritual dance music, led to the release of a compilation series by the same name.

He continued his career as an artist, returning to a more electronic sound, and the release of his Sonar Music set in 2002 marked an edgier and more futuristic style, more closely related to Techno and Dub than the House sound he was identified with as a DJ. In 2002, he also started touring with Derrick May, playing sets together as the Cosmic Twins at Berlin&#x27;s Tresor, Manchester&#x27;s Sankey&#x27;s Soap and London&#x27;s Fabric. Kevorkian released a new compilation CD in 2006, entitled &quot;Frequencies&quot;.

In April 2003, he started a residency at a new weekly Monday night event in New York City called &quot;Deep Space NYC&quot;, an eclectic night focused on dub music and related styles. He mixed &quot;Deep Space NYC Vol. 1&quot;, a compilation featuring several of his own productions, along with Jamaican dub reggae and roots reggae artists Mutabaruka and U-Roy. Kevorkian&#x27;s work with U-Roy was co-produced in a discomix style with British roots reggae and Dubplate artist, Russ Disciple of The Disciples (band). He also provided remixes for Moloko, Yoko Ono, Cesária Évora, Nina Simone, as well as for his own label. In 2005, he was inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame as both a remixer and DJ.

Kevorkian has subsequently performed at events around the world, including Midem (France), Sónar (Spain), Global Gathering (UK), Exit Festival (Serbia), The Big Chill (UK), Bestival (UK) and Electric Picnic (Ireland).

<doc id="150271" wikidata="Q1851197" url="?curid=150271" title="Seigneur of Sark">
<text>The Seigneur of Sark is the lord of the manor of Sark in the Channel Islands. A female seigneur of Sark is called Dame of Sark, of which there have been three. The husband of a female ruler of Sark is not a consort but is &quot;jure uxoris&quot; (&quot;by right of (his) wife&quot;) a seigneur himself.

==Description==

The title is hereditary, but with permission of the Crown, it may be mortgaged or sold, as happened in 1849 when Pierre Carey le Pelley sold the fief to Marie Collings for £6,000.

The Seigneur was, before the constitutional reforms of 2008, the head of the feudal government of Sark, with the British monarch being the feudal overlord. The Seigneur had a suspensive veto power and the right to appoint most of the island&#x27;s officers. Many of the laws, particularly those related to inheritance and the rule of the Seigneur, had changed little since Queen Elizabeth I, by Letters Patent, granted a fiefdom to Hellier de Carteret in 1565.

The residents of Sark voted to introduce a fully elected legislature to replace the feudal government in a 2006 referendum, and the law change was approved on 9 April 2008. The first democratic election was held on 10 December 2008. The changes in the political system mostly apply to the parliament, the Chief Pleas, not to the Seigneur.

Many seigneurs are buried at St. Peter&#x27;s Anglican Church, Sark.

<text>Colditz Castle (or &quot;Schloss Colditz&quot; in German) is a Renaissance castle in the town of Colditz near Leipzig, Dresden and Chemnitz in the state of Saxony in Germany. The castle is between the towns of Hartha and Grimma on a hill spur over the river Zwickauer Mulde, a tributary of the River Elbe. It had the first wildlife park in Germany when, during 1523, the castle park was converted into one of the largest menageries in Europe. 

The castle gained international fame as the site of Oflag IV-C, a prisoner-of-war camp during World War II for &quot;incorrigible&quot; Allied officers who had repeatedly attempted to escape from other camps.

== Original castle ==


In 1046, Henry III of the Holy Roman Empire gave the burghers of Colditz permission to build the first documented settlement at the site. During 1083, Henry IV urged Margrave Wiprecht of Groitzsch to develop the castle site, which Colditz accepted. During 1158, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa made Thimo I &quot;Lord of Colditz&quot;, and major building works began. By 1200, the town around the market was established. Forests, empty meadows, and farmland were settled next to the pre-existing Slavic villages Zschetzsch, Zschadraß, Zollwitz, Terpitzsch and Koltzschen. Around that time the larger villages Hohnbach, Thierbaum, Ebersbach and Tautenhain also developed.

During the Middle Ages, the castle was used as a lookout post for the German Emperors and was the hub of the Reich territories of the Pleissenland (anti-Meißen Pleiße-lands). During 1404, the nearly 250-year rule of the dynasty of the Lords of Colditz ended when Thimo VIII sold Colditz Castle for 15,000 silver marks to the Wettin ruler of the period in Saxony.

As a result of family dynastic politics, the town of Colditz was incorporated into the Margraviate of Meissen. During 1430, the Hussites attacked Colditz and set town and castle on fire. Around 1464, renovation and new building work on the castle were done by order of Prince Ernest, who died in Castle Colditz in 1486. During the reigns of Electors Frederick III the Wise and John the Gentle, Colditz was a royal residence of the electors of Saxony.

== Periods of reconstruction and changes in use==

During 1504, the servant Clemens the baker accidentally set Colditz afire, and the town hall, church, castle and a large part of the town was burned. During 1506, reconstruction began and new buildings were erected around the rear castle courtyard. During 1523, the castle park was converted into one of the largest zoos in Europe. During 1524, rebuilding of the upper floors of the castle began. The castle was reconstructed in a fashion that corresponded to the way it was divided-— into the cellar, the royal house and the banqueting hall building. There is nothing more to be seen of the original castle, where the present rear of the castle is located, but it is still possible to discern where the original divisions were (the Old or Lower House, the Upper House and the Great House).

The structure of the castle was changed during the long reign of the Elector Augustus of Saxony (1553–86), and the complex was reconstructed into a Renaissance style castle from 1577 to 1591, including the portions that were still in the gothic architectural style. Architects and Peter Kummer supervised further restoration and rebuilding. Later, Lucas Cranach the Younger was commissioned as an artist in the castle.

During this period the portal at what is known as the church house was created during 1584, made of &quot;Rochlitz Porphyr&quot; (rhyolite tuff) and richly decorated in the mannerist style by Andreas Walther II. This dimension stone has been in use in architecture for more than 1,000 years. It was at this time that both the interior and the exterior of &quot;the Holy Trinity&quot; castle chapel that links the cellar and electors&#x27; house with one another were redesigned. Soon thereafter the castle became an administrative office for the Office of Colditz and a hunting lodge. During 1694, its then-current owner, King Augustus the Strong of Poland, began to expand it, resulting in a second courtyard and a total of 700 rooms.

During the 19th century, the church space was rebuilt in the neo-classic architectural style, but its condition was allowed to deteriorate. The castle was used by Frederick Augustus III, Elector of Saxony as a workhouse to feed the poor, the ill, and persons who had been arrested. It served this purpose from 1803 to 1829, when its workhouse function was assumed by an institution in Zwickau. During 1829, the castle became a mental hospital for the &quot;incurably insane&quot; from Waldheim. During 1864, a new hospital building was erected in the Gothic Revival style, on the ground where the stables and working quarters had been previously located. It remained a mental institution until 1924.

From 1829 to 1924, Colditz was a sanatorium, generally reserved for the wealthy and the nobility of Germany. The castle thus functioned as a hospital during a long period of massive change in Germany, from slightly after the Napoleonic Wars destroyed the Holy Roman Empire and created the German Confederation, throughout the lifespan of the North German Confederation, the complete reign of the German Empire, throughout the First World War, and until the beginnings of the Weimar Republic. Between 1914 and 1918, the castle was home to both psychiatric and tuberculosis patients, 912 of whom died of malnutrition. The castle was home to several notable figures during its time as a mental institution, including Ludwig Schumann, the second youngest son of the composer Robert Schumann, and , one of the inventors of the airship.

When the Nazis gained power during 1933, they converted the castle into a political prison for communists, homosexuals, Jews and other people they considered undesirable. Starting 1939, Allied prisoners were housed there.

== Use as POW camp ==


After the outbreak of World War II, the castle was converted into a high security prisoner-of-war camp for officers who had become security or escape risks or who were regarded as particularly dangerous. Since the castle is situated on a rocky outcrop above the River Zwickauer Mulde, the Germans believed it to be an ideal site for a high security prison.

The larger outer court in front of the &quot;Kommandantur&quot; (commander&#x27;s offices) had only two exits and housed a large German garrison. The prisoners lived in an adjacent courtyard in a 90 ft (27 m) tall building. Outside, the flat terraces which surrounded the prisoners&#x27; accommodation were watched constantly by armed sentries and surrounded by barbed wire. The prison was named &quot;Oflag IV-C&quot; (officer prison camp 4C) and was operated by the Wehrmacht.

While the camp was home to prisoners of war from many different countries, including Poland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Canada, in May 1943 Wehrmacht High Command decided to house only British and American officers. 
The camp&#x27;s first British prisoners were the Laufen Six on 7 November 1940, who were transferred to Colditz after their first escape attempt from the Laufen Camp.

Although it was considered a high security prison, it had one of the greatest records of successful escape attempts. This could be owing to the general nature of the prisoners that were sent there; most of them had attempted escape previously from other prisons and were transferred to Colditz because the Germans had thought the castle escape-proof.

One escape scheme even included a glider, the Colditz Cock, that was built and kept in a remote portion of the castle&#x27;s attic during the winter of 1944–45. The glider was never used, as the camp was liberated not long after its completion. After liberation, the glider was brought down from the hidden workshop to the attic below and assembled for the prisoners to see. Assigned to the task force that liberated the castle, American war correspondent Lee Carson entered Colditz on 15 April 1945 and took the only photograph of the glider completed in the attic. For some time after the war the glider was regarded as a tall tale, as there was no solid proof that the glider had existed and Colditz was then in the Soviet occupation zone in Germany. Bill Goldfinch took home the drawings he had made while designing the glider, and when the single photograph finally surfaced the story was taken seriously.

During 1999, a full-sized replica of the glider was commissioned by Channel 4 Television in the UK and built by Southdown Aviation Ltd at Lasham Airfield, closely following Goldfinch&#x27;s drawings. Watched by several of the former prisoners of war who worked on the original, it was test-flown at RAF Odiham during 2000. The escape plan could have worked. In 2012, Channel 4 commissioned another full-sized replica of the glider which was launched from the same roof as had been planned for the original. The unmanned radio-controlled replica made it across the river and landed in a meadow 180 metres below.

Captain Pat Reid, who successfully escaped from Colditz in 1942, went on to write multiple works on the living conditions and various escape attempts at Colditz from 1940 to 1945: &quot;The Colditz Story&quot; and &quot;The Latter Days at Colditz&quot;. In the early 1970s, he served as a technical consultant for a BBC television series, &quot;Colditz&quot; (1972), featuring David McCallum, Edward Hardwicke and Robert Wagner, that focused on life at Colditz.

The escapes from Colditz, featured in many works of fiction or documentaries, popularized the unrealistic image of prisoner of war escapes as being common; this is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Colditz Myth&quot;.

During the last days of the prison camp at Colditz, many of its prominent or high-ranking prisoners were transferred to Laufen by order of Himmler. In April 1945, U.S. troops entered the town of Colditz and, after a two-day fight, captured the castle on 16 April 1945. In May 1945, the Soviet occupation of Colditz began. According to the agreement at the Yalta Conference it became a part of East Germany. The government turned Colditz Castle into a prison for local criminals. Later, the castle was a home for the aged and a nursing home, as well as a hospital and psychiatric clinic. For many years after the war, forgotten hiding places and tunnels were found by repairmen, including a radio room established by the French POWs, which was then &quot;lost&quot; again to be rediscovered some twenty years later.

== Present ==

During 2006 and 2007, the castle underwent a significant amount of refurbishment and restoration which was paid for by the state of Saxony. The castle walls were repainted to recreate the appearance of the castle prior to World War II.

With renovations largely completed, the castle now includes both a museum and guided tours showing some of the escape tunnels built by prisoners of the Oflag during the war. The chapel has been restored to its prewar decoration, with glass panels inserted to the flag stone flooring to reveal an escape tunnel dug by French escapees.

The outer courtyard and former German &quot;Kommandantur&quot; (guard quarters) have been converted into a youth hostel / hotel and the &quot;Gesellschaft Schloss Colditz e.V.&quot; (the Colditz Castle historical society), founded during 1996, has its offices in a portion of the administration building in the front castle court.

<doc id="150279" wikidata="Q623772" url="?curid=150279" title="Uvular consonant">
<text>Uvulars are consonants articulated with the back of the tongue against or near the uvula, that is, further back in the mouth than velar consonants. Uvulars may be stops, fricatives, nasals, trills, or approximants, though the IPA does not provide a separate symbol for the approximant, and the symbol for the voiced fricative is used instead. Uvular affricates can certainly be made but are rare: they occur in some southern High-German dialects, as well as in a few African and Native American languages. (Ejective uvular affricates occur as realizations of uvular stops in Lillooet, Kazakh, or as allophonic realizations of the ejective uvular fricative in Georgian.) Uvular consonants are typically incompatible with advanced tongue root, and they often cause retraction of neighboring vowels.

==Uvular consonants in IPA==
The uvular consonants identified by the International Phonetic Alphabet are:

==Descriptions in different languages==

English has no uvular consonants (at least in most major dialects), and they are largely unknown in the indigenous languages of Australia and the Pacific, though uvular consonants separate from velar consonants are believed to have existed in the Proto-Oceanic language and are attested in the modern Formosan languages of Taiwan, while a uvular approximant may occur in Arrernte. Uvular consonants are, however, found in many Middle-Eastern and African languages, most notably Arabic and Somali, and in native American languages. In parts of the Caucasus mountains and northwestern North America, nearly every language has uvular stops and fricatives. Two uvular R phonemes are found in various languages in northwestern Europe, including French, some Occitan dialects, a majority of German dialects, some Dutch dialects, and Danish. Uvulars are almost unknown in the Indian subcontinent, but have been found in Malto and Kusunda natively. However, several languages spoken in the northwest of the subcontinent have loaned uvular consonants from Arabic and even Persian, especially languages that were spoken in places that were under Muslim rule for long periods of time, such as Punjabi.

The voiceless uvular stop is transcribed as in both the IPA and X-SAMPA. It is pronounced somewhat like the voiceless velar stop , but with the middle of the tongue further back on the velum, against or near the uvula. The most familiar use will doubtless be in the transliteration of Arabic place names such as &quot;Qatar&quot; and &quot;Iraq&quot; into English, though, since English lacks this sound, this is generally pronounced as , the most similar sound that occurs in English.

, the uvular ejective, is found in Ubykh, Tlingit, Cusco Quechua, and some others. In Georgian, the existence of this phoneme is debatable, since the general realization of the letter &quot;ყ&quot; is . This is due to merging with and therefore being influenced by this merger and becoming .

, the voiced equivalent of , is much rarer. It is like the voiced velar stop , but articulated in the same uvular position as . Few languages use this sound, but it is found in Iranian Persian (and allophonicly in other varieties of Persian) and in some Northeast Caucasian languages, notably Tabasaran, and Pacific Northwest, such as Kwakʼwala. It may also occur as an allophone of another uvular consonant. In Kazakh, the voiced uvular stop is an allophone of the voiced uvular fricative after the velar nasal.

The voiceless uvular fricative is similar to the voiceless velar fricative , except that it is articulated near the uvula. It is found in Georgian, and instead of in some dialects of German, Spanish, and colloquial Arabic, as well as in some Dutch varieties and in standard Afrikaans.

Uvular flaps have been reported for Kube (Trans–New Guinea), Hamtai (Angan family), and for the variety of Khmer spoken in Battambang province.

The Enqi dialect of the Bai language has an unusually complete series of uvular consonants consisting of the stops /q/, /qʰ/ and /ɢ/, the fricatives /χ/ and /ʁ/, and the nasal /ɴ/. All of these contrast with a corresponding velar consonant of the same manner of articulation. The existence of the uvular nasal is especially unusual, even more so than the existence of the voiced stop.

The Tlingit language of the Alaska Panhandle has ten uvular consonants, all of which are voiceless obstruents:

And the extinct Ubykh language of Turkey has twenty.

==Phonological representation==
In featural phonology, uvular consonants are most often considered to contrast with velar consonants in terms of being [–high] and [+back]. Prototypical uvulars also appear to be [-ATR].

Two variants can then be established. Since palatalized consonants are [-back], the appearance of palatalized uvulars in a few languages such as Ubykh is difficult to account for. According to Vaux (1999), they possibly hold the features [+high], [-back], [-ATR], the last being the distinguishing feature from a palatalized velar consonant.

== Uvular rhotics ==

The uvular trill is used in certain dialects (especially those associated with European capitals) of French, German, Dutch, Portuguese, Danish, Swedish and Norwegian, as well as sometimes in Modern Hebrew, for the rhotic phoneme. In many of these it has a uvular fricative (either voiced or voiceless ) as an allophone when it follows one of the voiceless stops , , or at the end of a word, as in the French example &quot;&quot; , or even a uvular approximant [ʁ̞].

As with most trills, uvular trills are often reduced to a single contact, especially between vowels.

Unlike other uvular consonants, the uvular trill is articulated without a retraction of the tongue, and therefore doesn&#x27;t lower neighboring high vowels the way uvular stops commonly do.

Several other languages, including Inuktitut, Abkhaz, Uyghur and some varieties of Arabic, have a voiced uvular fricative but do not treat it as a rhotic consonant. However, Modern Hebrew and some modern varieties of Arabic also both have at least one uvular fricative that is considered non-rhotic, and one that is considered rhotic.

In Lakhota the uvular trill is an allophone of the voiced uvular fricative before .

<text>Jessica Hynes (&quot;née&quot; Stevenson) (born 30 October 1972) is a British actress, director and writer. Best known as a comedy actress, she has played Cheryl in &quot;The Royle Family&quot; (1998-2010), Siobhan Sharpe in &quot;Twenty Twelve&quot; (2011-2012) and &quot;W1A&quot; (2014-2017) and Emily Yates in &quot;There She Goes&quot; (2018-2023). She was also one of the stars, creators and writers of &quot;Spaced&quot; (1999-2001). She has also had starring roles in television film &quot;Tomorrow La Scala!&quot; and BBC dramas &quot;Years and Years&quot; (2019) and &quot;Miss Austen&quot; (2025). In film, Hynes has appeared in the &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; (2004-2025), &quot;Nativity&quot; (2012-2018) and &quot;Paddington&quot; (2017-2024) film series. 

Hynes has been nominated for two International Emmy Awards, a Tony Award, a Laurence Olivier Award, five BAFTAs (winning two), three Royal Television Society Awards (winning two) and three British Comedy Awards (winning two).

==Early life==
Hynes was born in Lewisham, London, and grew up in Brighton, where she attended St Luke&#x27;s Infant and Junior Schools and Dorothy Stringer High School. After her parents split up, she was raised by her mother. She moved back to London as a young adult. Her maternal grandmother came from the village of Llanelian, north Wales, where her uncle also ran a farm. Her mother is a fluent Welsh speaker who later moved back to north Wales. In 2023, Hynes took part in the S4C series Iaith ar Daith where she began to learn the Welsh language; she cited being able to speak Welsh to her mother as a reason why she wanted to take part in the programme.

==Career==
As a teenager, Hynes was a member of the National Youth Theatre company, and made her stage début with the company in Lionel Bart&#x27;s &quot;Blitz!&quot; in 1990. In 1991 she appeared in Disneys &#x27;Swing Kids&#x27; alongside Frank Whaley and Robert Sean-Leonard. In the same year she appeared in Peter Greenaway&#x27;s film &#x27;The baby of Macon&#x27; playing &#x27;The first Midwife&#x27;. Between 1992–1993, she played a season at the West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds. In 1994, Hynes appeared as an uncredited extra in the first episode of &quot;The Day Today&quot; in the Attitudes Night segment, a parody of the UK&#x27;s changing attitudes.

Early in her career, Hynes teamed up with future &quot;Spaced&quot; co-star Katy Carmichael in a comedy double-act called &quot;the Liz Hurleys&quot;, appeared in two productions at Sheffield&#x27;s Crucible Theatre, and acted for television shows including &quot;Staying Alive&quot;, &quot;Six Pairs of Pants&quot;, &quot;(Un)natural Acts&quot;, and &quot;Asylum&quot; (on which the &quot;Spaced&quot; team of Hynes, Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright first assembled). From 1998 to 2000, she played the supporting role of Cheryl in the hit sitcom &quot;The Royle Family&quot;; she reprised the role for special episodes in 2006, 2009 and 2010. In 1999, she co-wrote and starred in &quot;Spaced&quot;. For which she won two comedy awards and was nominated for an International Emmy and a Bafta for writing and creating the show alongside Simon Pegg. 

Hynes&#x27; London theatre début was in April 2002, playing the tough ex-prisoner &quot;Bolla&quot; in Jez Butterworth&#x27;s &quot;The Night Heron&quot; at the Royal Court for which she was nominated for a Lawrence Olivier Award In 2004, she played a minor part as Yvonne in horror comedy &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;, again working with Pegg and Wright. In the same year, she was also cast as Magda, friend of the titular character, in the Hollywood sequel &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27; Diary 2&quot;, also called &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27; Diary: The Edge of Reason&quot;. 

In early 2007, Hynes took a lead role in the film &quot;Magicians&quot;, starring alongside comic duo David Mitchell and Robert Webb. She provided the voice of Mafalda Hopkirk in &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;. She played Joan Redfern in the 2007 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes &quot;Human Nature&quot; and &quot;The Family of Blood&quot;. She then appeared in part two of the story &quot;The End of Time&quot;, playing a character named Verity Newman, who is Joan&#x27;s great-granddaughter. Hynes appeared in Big Finish&#x27;s Eighth Doctor audio adventure &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot;, with her &quot;Spaced&quot; colleague Simon Pegg. She starred in &quot;Son of Rambow&quot; (credited as Jessica Stevenson), playing Mary Proudfoot opposite the star of the film, Bill Milner. In November 2007, BBC One released &quot;Learners&quot;, a comedy drama television movie which Hynes starred in and wrote.

In 2008 she appeared in a revival of Alan Ayckbourn&#x27;s &quot;The Norman Conquests&quot; at the Old Vic. In 2009 she made her Broadway début in the play&#x27;s transfer and was nominated for a Tony Award for her performance. The show itself won a Tony for best revival that year.

Hynes appeared as a &quot;right-on&quot; PR person, Siobhan Sharpe, in the London Olympics centred satire &quot;Twenty Twelve&quot;, of which the first series screened on BBC Four in 2011, moving to BBC Two in spring 2012. A further series was screened in July 2012. She reprised the role in the 2014 series &quot;W1A&quot; for which she won a BAFTA. 

In 2017 , she directed her first feature film, &quot;The Fight&quot;, produced by Jamie Adams and Unstoppable media. In 2018, she played the role of a mother in the BBC Four programme &quot;There She Goes&quot;. She stars alongside David Tennant, raising a daughter with a severe learning disability. It is based on the real life of writer Shaun Pye and his wife Sarah Crawford whose daughter was born with a chromosomal disorder. She won a Bafta for her role in the series and was nominated for an International Emmy for her role in &#x27;414&#x27; the special made in 2023. In 2019, she starred in the BBC and HBO production &quot;Years and Years&quot; for which she won a Royal Television Society award.

==Personal life==
Hynes is married to Adam Hynes, a sculptor. The couple have been together since they were 18 years old, but only married in 2002, when she officially changed her surname from her birth name of Stevenson – including for screen credits. They have three children together, and live in Folkestone, Kent. 

She has six siblings and her sister Zoe runs her own fashion label Tallulah and Hope.

<text>In combinatory logic for computer science, a fixed-point combinator (or fixpoint combinator) is a higher-order function (i.e. a function which takes a function as argument) that returns some &quot;fixed point&quot; (a value that is mapped to itself) of its argument function, if one exists.

Formally, if formula_1 is a fixed-point combinator and the function formula_2 has one or more fixed points, then formula_3 is one of these fixed points, i.e.
: formula_4

Fixed-point combinators can be defined in the lambda calculus and in functional programming languages and provide a means to allow for recursive definitions.

==&quot;Y&quot; combinator in lambda calculus==
In the classical untyped lambda calculus, every function has a fixed point. A particular implementation of formula_1 is Haskell Curry&#x27;s paradoxical combinator &quot;Y&quot;, given by

: formula_6
(Here we use the standard notations and conventions of lambda calculus: &quot;Y&quot; is a function that takes one argument &quot;f&quot; and returns the entire expression following the first period; the expression formula_7 denotes a function that takes one argument &quot;x&quot;, thought of as a function, and returns the expression formula_8, where formula_9 denotes &quot;x&quot; applied to itself. Juxtaposition of expressions denotes function application, is left-associative, and has higher precedence than the period.)

===Verification===
The following calculation verifies that formula_10 is indeed a fixed point of the function formula_11:

The lambda term formula_12 may not, in general, β-reduce to the term formula_13. However, both terms β-reduce to the same term, as shown.

===Uses===
Applied to a function with one variable, the &quot;Y&quot; combinator usually does not terminate. More interesting results are obtained by applying the &quot;Y&quot; combinator to functions of two or more variables. The additional variables may be used as a counter, or index. The resulting function behaves like a &quot;while&quot; or a &quot;for&quot; loop in an imperative language.

Used in this way, the &quot;Y&quot; combinator implements simple recursion. The lambda calculus does not allow a function to appear as a term in its own definition as is possible in many programming languages, but a function can be passed as an argument to a higher-order function that applies it in a recursive manner.

The &quot;Y&quot; combinator may also be used in implementing Curry&#x27;s paradox. The heart of Curry&#x27;s paradox is that untyped lambda calculus is unsound as a deductive system, and the &quot;Y&quot; combinator demonstrates this by allowing an anonymous expression to represent zero, or even many values. This is inconsistent in mathematical logic.

===Example implementations===
An example implementation of &quot;Y&quot; in the language R is presented below:
Y &lt;- \(f) {
 g &lt;- \(x) f(x(x))
 g(g)
This can then be used to implement factorial as follows:
fact &lt;- \(f) \(n)
 if (n == 0) 1 else n * f(n - 1)
Y(fact)(5) # yields 5! = 120
Y is only needed when we do not have function names. Substituting all the definitions into one line so that function names are not required gives:
(\(f) (\(x) f(x(x)))(\(x) f(x(x)))) (\(f) \(n) if (n == 0) 1 else n * f(n - 1)) (5)
This works because R uses lazy evaluation.

Languages that use strict evaluation, such as Python, C++, and others, can often express Y; however, any implementation is useless in practice since it loops indefinitely until terminating through stack overflow.

==Fixed-point combinator==

The Y combinator is an implementation of a fixed-point combinator in lambda calculus. Fixed-point combinators may also be easily defined in other functional and imperative languages. The implementation in lambda calculus is more difficult due to limitations in lambda calculus.
The fixed-point combinator may be used in a number of different areas:
* General mathematics
* Untyped lambda calculus
* Typed lambda calculus
* Functional programming
* Imperative programming

Fixed-point combinators may be applied to a range of different functions, but normally will not terminate unless there is an extra parameter. When the function to be fixed refers to its parameter, another call to the function is invoked, so the calculation never gets started. Instead, the extra parameter is used to trigger the start of the calculation.

The type of the fixed point is the return type of the function being fixed. This may be a real or a function or any other type.

In the untyped lambda calculus, the function to apply the fixed-point combinator to may be expressed using an encoding, like Church encoding. In this case particular lambda terms (which define functions) are considered as values. &quot;Running&quot; (beta reducing) the fixed-point combinator on the encoding gives a lambda term for the result which may then be interpreted as fixed-point value.

Alternately, a function may be considered as a lambda term defined purely in lambda calculus.

These different approaches affect how a mathematician and a programmer may regard a fixed-point combinator. A mathematician may see the Y combinator applied to a function as being an expression satisfying the fixed-point equation, and therefore a solution.

In contrast, a person only wanting to apply a fixed-point combinator to some general programming task may see it only as a means of implementing recursion.

===Values and domains===
Many functions do not have any fixed points, for instance formula_14 with formula_15. Using Church encoding, natural numbers can be represented in lambda calculus, and this function &quot;f&quot; can be defined in lambda calculus. However, its domain will now contain &quot;all&quot; lambda expressions, not just those representing natural numbers. The Y combinator, applied to &quot;f&quot;, will yield a fixed-point for &quot;f&quot;, but this fixed-point won&#x27;t represent a natural number. If trying to compute &quot;Y f&quot; in an actual programming language, an infinite loop will occur.

===Function versus implementation===

The fixed-point combinator may be defined in mathematics and then implemented in other languages. General mathematics defines a function based on its extensional properties. That is, two functions are equal if they perform the same mapping. Lambda calculus and programming languages regard function identity as an intensional property. A function&#x27;s identity is based on its implementation. 

A lambda calculus function (or term) is an implementation of a mathematical function. In the lambda calculus there are a number of combinators (implementations) that satisfy the mathematical definition of a fixed-point combinator.

===Definition of the term &quot;combinator&quot;===

Combinatory logic is a higher-order functions theory. A combinator is a &quot;closed&quot; lambda expression, meaning that it has no free variables. The combinators may be combined to direct values to their correct places in the expression without ever naming them as variables.

== Recursive definitions and fixed-point combinators ==

Fixed-point combinators can be used to implement recursive definition of functions. However, they are rarely used in practical programming. Strongly normalizing type systems such as the simply typed lambda calculus disallow non-termination and hence fixed-point combinators often cannot be assigned a type or require complex type system features. Furthermore fixed-point combinators are often inefficient compared to other strategies for implementing recursion, as they require more function reductions and construct and take apart a tuple for each group of mutually recursive definitions.

=== The factorial function ===

The factorial function provides a good example of how a fixed-point combinator may be used to define recursive functions. The standard recursive definition of the factorial function in mathematics can be written as

: formula_16

where &quot;n&quot; is a non-negative integer.
If we want to implement this in lambda calculus, where integers are represented using Church encoding, we run into the problem that the lambda calculus does not allow the name of a function (&#x27;fact&#x27;) to be used in the function&#x27;s definition. This can be circumvented using a fixed-point combinator formula_17 as follows.

Define a function &quot;F&quot; of two arguments &quot;f&quot; and &quot;n&quot;:
: formula_18
(Here formula_19 is a function that takes two arguments and returns its first argument if &quot;n&quot;=0, and its second argument otherwise; formula_20 evaluates to &quot;n&quot;-1.)

Now define formula_21. Then formula_22 is a fixed-point of &quot;F&quot;, which gives
: formula_23

as desired.

==Fixed-point combinators in lambda calculus==

The Y combinator, discovered by Haskell B. Curry, is defined as
: formula_24

===Other fixed-point combinators===

In untyped lambda calculus fixed-point combinators are not especially rare. In fact there are infinitely many of them. In 2005 Mayer Goldberg showed that the set of fixed-point combinators of untyped lambda calculus is recursively enumerable.

The Y combinator can be expressed in the SKI-calculus as
: formula_25

Additional combinators (B, C, K, W system) allow for much shorter encodings. With formula_26 the self-application combinator, since formula_27 and formula_28, the above becomes
: formula_29

The shortest fixed-point combinator in the SK-calculus using S and K combinators only, found by John Tromp, is
: formula_30

although note that it is not in normal form, which is longer. This combinator corresponds to the lambda expression
: formula_31

The following fixed-point combinator is simpler than the Y combinator, and β-reduces into the Y combinator; it is sometimes cited as the Y combinator itself:
: formula_32

Another common fixed-point combinator is the Turing fixed-point combinator (named after its discoverer, Alan Turing):
: formula_33

Its advantage over formula_34 is that formula_35 beta-reduces to formula_36,
whereas formula_37 and formula_38 only beta-reduce to a common term.

formula_39 also has a simple call-by-value form:
: formula_40

The analog for mutual recursion is a &quot;polyvariadic fix-point combinator&quot;, which may be denoted Y*.

===Strict fixed-point combinator===

In a strict programming language the Y combinator will expand until stack overflow, or never halt in case of tail call optimization. The Z combinator will work in strict languages (also called eager languages, where applicative evaluation order is applied). The Z combinator has the next argument defined explicitly, preventing the expansion of formula_41 in the right-hand side of the definition:
: formula_42

and in lambda calculus it is an eta-expansion of the &quot;Y&quot; combinator:
: formula_43

=== Non-standard fixed-point combinators ===

If F is a fixed-point combinator in untyped lambda calculus, then we have

:formula_44

Terms that have the same Böhm tree as a fixed-point combinator, i.e. have the same infinite extension formula_45, are called &quot;non-standard fixed-point combinators&quot;. Any fixed-point combinator is also a non-standard one, but not all non-standard fixed-point combinators are fixed-point combinators because some of them fail to satisfy the fixed-point equation that defines the &quot;standard&quot; ones. These combinators are called &quot;strictly non-standard fixed-point combinators&quot;; an example is the following combinator:
: formula_46
where
: formula_47
: formula_48
since

:formula_49
where formula_50 are modifications of formula_51 created on the fly which add formula_52 instances of formula_53 at once into the chain while being replaced with formula_54.

The set of non-standard fixed-point combinators is not recursively enumerable.

==Implementation in other languages==

The Y combinator is a particular implementation of a fixed-point combinator in lambda calculus. Its structure is determined by the limitations of lambda calculus. It is not necessary or helpful to use this structure in implementing the fixed-point combinator in other languages.

Simple examples of fixed-point combinators implemented in some programming paradigms are given below.

=== Lazy functional implementation ===

In a language that supports lazy evaluation, like in Haskell, it is possible to define a fixed-point combinator using the defining equation of the fixed-point combinator which is conventionally named codice_1. Since Haskell has lazy datatypes, this combinator can also be used to define fixed points of data constructors (and not only to implement recursive functions). The definition is given here, followed by some usage examples. In Hackage, the original sample is: 
fix, fix&#x27; :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a
fix f = let x = f x in x -- Lambda dropped. Sharing.
 -- Original definition in Data.Function.
-- alternative:
fix&#x27; f = f (fix&#x27; f) -- Lambda lifted. Non-sharing.

fix (\x -&gt; 9) -- this evaluates to 9

fix (\x -&gt; 3:x) -- evaluates to the lazy infinite list [3,3,3...]

fact = fix fac -- evaluates to the factorial function
 where fac f 0 = 1
 fac f x = x * f (x-1)

fact 5 -- evaluates to 120
=== Strict functional implementation ===

In a strict functional language, as illustrated below with OCaml, the argument to &quot;f&quot; is expanded beforehand, yielding an infinite call sequence,
: formula_55.

This may be resolved by defining fix with an extra parameter.
let rec fix f x = f (fix f) x (* note the extra x; hence fix f = \x-&gt; f (fix f) x *)

let factabs fact = function (* factabs has extra level of lambda abstraction *)
 0 -&gt; 1
 | x -&gt; x * fact (x-1)

let _ = (fix factabs) 5 (* evaluates to &quot;120&quot; *)
In a multi-paradigm functional language (one decorated with imperative features), such as Lisp, Peter Landin suggested the use of a variable assignment to create a fixed-point combinator, as in the below example using Scheme:
(define Y!
 (lambda (f)
 ((lambda (g) 
 (set! g (f (lambda (x) (g x)))) ;; (set! g expr) assigns g the value of expr,
 g) ;; replacing g&#x27;s initial value of #f, creating 
 #f))) ;; thus the truly self-referential value in g
Using a lambda calculus with axioms for assignment statements, it can be shown that codice_2 satisfies the same fixed-point law as the call-by-value Y combinator:
: formula_56

In more idiomatic modern Scheme usage, this would typically be handled via a codice_3 expression, as lexical scope was introduced to Lisp in the 1970s:
(define Y*
 (lambda (f)
 (letrec ;; (letrec ((g expr)) ...) locally defines g 
 ((g ;; as expr recursively: g in expr refers to 
 (f (lambda (x) (g x))))) ;; that same g being defined, g = f (λx. g x)
 g))) ;; ((Y* f) ...) = (g ...) = ((f (λx. g x)) ...)
Or without the internal label:
(define Y
 (lambda (f)
 ((lambda (i) (i i))
 (lambda (i)
 (f (lambda (x)
 (apply (i i) x)))))))
===Imperative language implementation===

This example is a slightly interpretive implementation of a fixed-point combinator. A class is used to contain the &quot;fix&quot; function, called &quot;fixer&quot;. The function to be fixed is contained in a class that inherits from fixer. The &quot;fix&quot; function accesses the function to be fixed as a virtual function. As for the strict functional definition, &quot;fix&quot; is explicitly given an extra parameter &quot;x&quot;, which means that lazy evaluation is not needed.
template &lt;typename R, typename D&gt;
class fixer
public:
 R fix(D x)
 return f(x);
private:
 virtual R f(D) = 0;

class fact : public fixer&lt;long, long&gt;
 virtual long f(long x)
 if (x == 0)
 return 1;
 return x * fix(x-1);
};

long result = fact().fix(5);
Another example can be shown to demonstrate SKI combinator calculus (with given bird name from Combinatory logic) being used to build up Z combinator to achieve Tail call-like behavior through trampolining:
var K = a =&gt; b =&gt; a; // Kestrel
var S = a =&gt; b =&gt; c =&gt; a(c)(b(c)); // Starling
var I = S(K)(K); // Identity
var B = S(K(S))(K); // Bluebird
var C = S(B(B)(S))(K(K)); // Cardinal
var W = C(S)(I); // Warbler
var T = C(I); // Thrush
var V = B(C)(T); // Vireo
var I_ = C(C(I)); // Identity Bird Once Removed; same as C(B(B)(I))(I)
var C_ = B(C); // Cardinal Once Removed
var R_ = C_(C_); // Robin Once Removed
var V_ = B(R_)(C_); // Vireo Once Removed
var I__ = R_(V); // Identity Bird Twice Removed
var Z = B(W(I_))(V_(B)(W(I__)));

var Z2 = S(K(S(S(K(S(S(K)(K))(S(K)(K))))(S(K(S(K(S))(K)))(S(K(S(S(K)(K))))(K))))(K(S(S(K))))))(S(S(K(S(S(K(S(K(S))(K)))(S))(K(K))))(S(K(S(S(K(S(K(S))(K)))(S))(K(K))))(S(K(S))(K))))(K(S(S(K(S(S(K)(K))(S(K)(K))))(S(K(S(K(S))(K)))(S(K(S(S(K)(K))))(K))))(K(S(K(S(S(K(S(S(K(S(K(S))(K)))(S))(K(K))))(S(K(S(S(K(S(K(S))(K)))(S))(K(K))))(S(K(S(S(K)(K))))(K))))))(K))))));
 // Alternative fully expanded form.

var Z3 = S(S(K(S(S)(K(S(S(K)(K))(S(K)(K))))))(K))(S(S(K(S))(K))(K(S(S(K(S))(S(K(S(K(S(K(S(K(S(S)(K(K))))(K)))(S)))(S(S(K)(K)))))(K)))(K(K(S(S(K)(K))(S(K)(K))))))));
 // Another shorter version.

var trampoline = fn =&gt; {
 let ctx = fn;
 while (ctx instanceof Function)
 ctx = ctx();
 return ctx;

var count_fn = self =&gt; n =&gt;
 (console.log(n), n === 0)
 ? n
 : () =&gt; self(n - 1); // Return thunk &quot;() =&gt; self(n - 1)&quot; instead.

trampoline(Z(count_fn)(10));
trampoline(Z2(count_fn)(10));
trampoline(Z3(count_fn)(10));
==Typing==

In System F (polymorphic lambda calculus) a polymorphic fixed-point combinator has type
: ∀a.(a → a) → a
where formula_57 is a type variable. That is, if the type of formula_58 fulfilling the equation formula_59 is formula_57, – the most general type, – then the type of formula_2 is formula_62. So then, formula_63 takes a function which maps formula_57 to formula_57 and uses it to return a value of type formula_57.

In the simply typed lambda calculus extended with recursive data types, fixed-point operators can be written, but the type of a &quot;useful&quot; fixed-point operator (one whose application always returns) may be restricted.

In the simply typed lambda calculus, the fixed-point combinator Y cannot be assigned a type because at some point it would deal with the self-application sub-term formula_67 by the application rule:
: formula_68

where formula_53 has the infinite type formula_70. No fixed-point combinator can in fact be typed; in those systems, any support for recursion must be explicitly added to the language.

=== Type for the Y combinator ===

In programming languages that support recursive data types, the unbounded recursion in formula_71 which creates the infinite type formula_72 is broken by marking the formula_72 type explicitly as a recursive type formula_74, which is defined so as to be isomorphic to (or just to be a synonym of) formula_75. The formula_74 type value is created by simply tagging the function value of type formula_75 with the data constructor tag formula_78 (or any other of our choosing).

For example, in the following Haskell code, we have codice_4 and codice_5 being the names of the two directions of the isomorphism, with types:
Rec :: (Rec a -&gt; a) -&gt; Rec a
app :: Rec a -&gt; (Rec a -&gt; a)
which lets us write:
newtype Rec a = Rec { app :: Rec a -&gt; a }

y :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a
y f = (\ x -&gt; f (app x x)) (Rec (\ x -&gt; f (app x x)))
-- x :: Rec a
-- app x :: Rec a -&gt; a
-- app x x :: a
Or equivalently in OCaml:
type &#x27;a recc = In of (&#x27;a recc -&gt; &#x27;a)
let out (In x) = x

let y f = (fun x a -&gt; f (out x x) a) (In (fun x a -&gt; f (out x x) a))
Alternatively:
let y f = (fun x -&gt; f (fun z -&gt; out x x z)) (In (fun x -&gt; f (fun z -&gt; out x x z)))
==General information==
Because fixed-point combinators can be used to implement recursion, it is possible to use them to describe specific types of recursive computations, such as those in fixed-point iteration, iterative methods, recursive join in relational databases, data-flow analysis, FIRST and FOLLOW sets of non-terminals in a context-free grammar, transitive closure, and other types of closure operations.

A function for which &quot;every&quot; input is a fixed point is called an identity function. Formally:
: formula_79
In contrast to universal quantification over all formula_53, a fixed-point combinator constructs &quot;one&quot; value that is a fixed point of formula_2. The remarkable property of a fixed-point combinator is that it constructs a fixed point for an &quot;arbitrary given&quot; function formula_2.

Other functions have the special property that, after being applied once, further applications don&#x27;t have any effect. More formally:
: formula_83
Such functions are called idempotent (see also Projection (mathematics)). An example of such a function is the function that returns &quot;0&quot; for all even integers, and &quot;1&quot; for all odd integers.

In lambda calculus, from a computational point of view, applying a fixed-point combinator to an identity function or an idempotent function typically results in non-terminating computation. For example, we obtain
: formula_84
where the resulting term can only reduce to itself and represents an infinite loop.

Fixed-point combinators do not necessarily exist in more restrictive models of computation. For instance, they do not exist in simply typed lambda calculus.

The Y combinator allows recursion to be defined as a set of rewrite rules, without requiring native recursion support in the language.

In programming languages that support anonymous functions, fixed-point combinators allow the definition and use of anonymous recursive functions, i.e. without having to bind such functions to identifiers. In this setting, the use of fixed-point combinators is sometimes called &quot;anonymous recursion&quot;.

<text>Slovincian (Slovincian: &quot;slôvjinskjy&quot;, ; ; ) is an extinct language formerly spoken by the Slovincians living between lakes Gardno and Łebsko near Słupsk in Pomerania.

Slovincian is classified either as a language (first by Friedrich Lorentz), or as a Kashubian dialect or variant. Slovincian and Kashubian are both classified as Pomeranian. See below.

Slovincian became extinct in the early twentieth century ultimately due to stigmatization from Germans. However, individual words and expressions survived until after World War II, when the region became Polish. Some Slovincians were expelled along with the Germans. Of those allowed to stay, a few elderly people had fragmentary knowledge of Slovincian until the 1950s.

It is disputed whether Slovincians actually used that name, given to them by the Russian academic Aleksander Hilferding, for themselves. The synonym &quot;Lebakaschuben&quot; (Łebsko Kashubians) is also used. Some scholars believe that Slovincians regarded themselves merely as Lutheran Kashubians and their language as Kashubian. Nevertheless, the name &quot;Slovincian&quot; prevails in literature and is also used officially, for example in &quot;Słowiński Park Narodowy&quot; (Slovincian National Park), a protected area on the Polish Pomeranian coast.

==Transcription==
Because Slovincian was never a written language, many different notation systems have been used in dictionaries and grammars of this language. This article will use a modified Kashubian orthography designed with northern dialects in mind used by some authors. Things such as voicing assimilation will not be accounted for to maintain an etymological spelling, as also such assimilation is predictable.




Additionally, breve ⟨˘⟩ is used for short vowels that appear in some loanwords, and macron ⟨¯⟩ is used to indicate length in one set of words. Stress is marked with ⟨ˈ⟩.

==Phonology==




===Vowel length, pitch, and stress===
Slovincian native vowels do not show any phonemic difference in length except in one set of words; however, loanwords show unpredictability as to whether the given vowel will be long or short, giving a series of long or short loan-phonemes, existing only in loanwords.

It was originally posited that Slovincian had pitch, but it was later shown to be entirely dependent on stress, and thus, non-phonemic. However, stress itself is phonemic and can appear on any syllable. There is a tendency to place the accent on the first syllable in polysyllabic stems, especially in noun inflections and, more rarely, in verbal inflections.

===Notable allophony and other phonetic processes===
Unstressed word-final ⟨e⟩ has an archiphoneme of ⟨ë⟩. The pronouns &quot;tewa&quot;, &quot;jewa&quot;, &quot;czewa&quot;, &quot;njewa&quot;, etc., are subject to irregular phonetic reduction and can be realized with either ⟨ë⟩ or ⟨e⟩, with an ultimate underlying ⟨e⟩.

⟨ë⟩ is phonemically /ə/; regionally, it may be [æ].

⟨o⟩ can be realized as a diphthong [ɔu̯] when stressed in open medial syllables, and in closed syllables and ultima.

⟨ó⟩ can be a diphthong [ou̯] when stressed. [ou̯] and [o] are neutralized to /o/ in unstressed position before ⟨r⟩ and ⟨rz⟩.

Diphthongs or triphthongs whose elements end in ⟨j⟩ or ⟨ù⟩ will never have a diphthongized first element, even when stressed.

Some numerals show an irregular positional lengthening of ⟨y⟩ before word-final ⟨-nc⟩, represented as /i/.

It has been claimed that ⟨y⟩ and ⟨i⟩ are allophones appearing after hard or soft consonants, respectively; however, minimal pairs exist, for example:

: &quot;wëbjijã&quot; (&quot;to knock out&quot;) (first person singular future) vs. &quot;wëbjyjã&quot; (first person singular present)

The distinction between the two is neutralized after all consonants word-finally except after ⟨j, s, z, cz, dż⟩.

⟨ô⟩ can be diphthongized to [ʉɵ] when stressed and realized as [ɵ] when unstressed. /ɵ/ can optionally be stressed in a few monosyllabic, common words, resulting from a reduction due to rapid speech and frequent use.

⟨e⟩ diphthongizes to [ɛj] when stressed.

⟨é⟩ diphthongizes to [ej] when stressed except word-finally, where it remains phonetic /ej/.

⟨ó⟩ is the archiphoneme of ⟨o⟩ and ⟨ó⟩ before ⟨i⟩.

Nasal vowels can lose nasality when in coda position and unstressed.

⟨a⟩ before nasal consonants and when stressed has an allophone ⟨ã⟩, and becomes [ã] again in the same position when unstressed as an alternative, non-phonemic pronunciation.

⟨o⟩ also can undergo non-phonemic nasalization to ⟨õ⟩ in the same position.

In Kluki, all vowels in such position could non-phonemically nasalize. Proclitics do not affect nasality.

Regionally, ⟨v⟩ and ⟨f⟩ can allophonically be [w] and [ʍ] in word-final position.

⟨j⟩ has an allophone [xʲ] after /p/.

Slovincian displays a voicing assimilation system similar to the one found in Polish.

⟨kj⟩, ⟨gj⟩, ⟨chj⟩, and ⟨ghj⟩ can be phonetically realized as [c͡ç], [ɟ͡ʝ], [ç], and [ʝ], respectively.

Certain affixes can cause secondary stress (and, in some cases, secondary stress causes the appearance of non-phonemic diphthongs).

==Development from Proto-Slavic==
Slovincian shares many similar developments as Kashubian, with some notable differences being:

Long *a, often from being with a tautosyllabic voiced consonants, became &lt;o&gt; usually and &lt;ó&gt; (via &lt;o&gt;) before nasals. Otherwise, *a remained &lt;a&gt;.
* *drapatь &gt; drapac (&quot;to scratch&quot;)
* *gradъ &gt; gr&#x27;od (&quot;hail&quot;)
* *gъpanъ &gt; pón (&quot;lord&quot;)
*a before tautosyllabic *r (*ar) &gt; &lt;or&gt;.
* *darъ &gt; dor
*a before tautosyllabic *l, ľ &gt; &lt;ôù&gt; (where *l and *ľ merged).
* valъ &gt; vôùl
*a before tautosyllabic *j&gt; ôj medially and &gt; ôù finally
* *ajьko &gt; jôjkô
* *chad
* &lt;v&gt; from earlier *v and *v́ before a consonant and in the coda is lost between u̯ and a pause.
* *pravьda &gt; prôùda
Long Proto-Slavic *u fronts to &lt;ú&gt;. Initial *u also has a prothetic &lt;w&gt; inserted.
* *učiti &gt; wùczic
Short Proto-Slavic *o fronts to &lt;ô&gt;. Initial *o also has a prothetic &lt;w&gt; inserted. Short o raises to &lt;ó&gt; before liquids.
* *okъno &gt; wôknô
Proto-Slavic *e shifts to &lt;ê&gt; (which diphthongizes when stressed).
* *teplъ &gt; cêply
Proto-Slavic *ň hardens to &lt;nj&gt; (/nj/) medially and initially, and becomes /n/ finally. For the spelling of &lt;ń&gt;, see the transcription of Slovinician
* *ničьto &gt; njic
* *koňь &gt; kóń (pronounced /ˈkon/).
A lack of further palatalization of soft *k and *g.
* *kortъ̀kъ &gt; krótkjy
* *dȏrgъ &gt; drôgjy
Bëlaczenié.
* *ablo &gt; jablô
Numerous other changes exist, usually occurring within individual words.
A retention of the dual.
* ˈbrzég (&quot;coast&quot;) &gt; ˈbrzêgji (&quot;two coasts&quot;)
A reduction of the suffix -ôwac (From *-ovati) to -ac.
* daˈrôwac||daˈrac

==Grammar==

Slovincian grammar displays typical Slavic features, including declinable nouns, adjectives, verbs, pronouns, and numerals, as well as comparative and superlative forms, but notably retains a dual number. Many of its grammatical endings differ from those in Kashubian.

==History==
The ancestors of the Slovincians, the West Slavic Pomeranians, moved in after the Migration Period. Following the Ostsiedlung, the Slovincians, like most of the other Wends, gradually became Germanized. The adoption of Lutheranism in the Duchy of Pomerania in 1534 distinguished the Slovincians from the Kashubes in Pomerelia, who remained Roman Catholic. In the 16th century, &quot;Slovincian&quot; was also applied to the Slavic speakers in the Bytów (Bütow) region further south.

In the 16th and 17th century, Michael Brüggemann (also known as Pontanus or Michał Mostnik), Simon Krofey (Szimon Krofej), and J.M. Sporgius introduced Kashubian into the Lutheran Church. Krofey, pastor in Bytów (Bütow), published a religious song book in 1586, written in Polish but also containing some Kashubian words. Brüggemann, pastor in Schmolsin, published a Polish translation of some works of Martin Luther and biblical texts, also containing Kashubian elements. Other biblical texts were published in 1700 by Sporgius, pastor in Schmolsin. His &quot;Schmolsiner Perikopen&quot;, most of which is written in the same Polish-Kashubian style of Krofey&#x27;s and Brüggemann&#x27;s books, also contain small passages (&quot;6th Sunday after Epiphanias&quot;) written in pure Kashubian.

Hilferding (1862) and Parczewski (1896) confirmed a progressive language shift in the Kashubian population from their Slavonic vernacular to the local German dialect (Low German Ostpommersch or High German, in eastern Kashubian areas also Low German Low Prussian).

By the 1920s, the Slovincian villages had become linguistically German, though a Slovincian consciousness remained. The area remained within the borders of Germany until becoming part of Poland after World War II ended in 1945 and the area became Polish. Some Slovincians were expelled along with the German population, some were allowed to remain. In the 1950s, mainly in the village of Kluki (formerly Klucken), a few elderly people still remembered fragments of Slovincian.

Slovincians began to ask for the right to emigrate to West Germany, and virtually all of the remaining Slovincian families had emigrated there by the 1980s.

==Dialects==
Slovincian can be divided into two major dialects, East and West, each with subdialects, with a third transitional dialect. The dialect in Kluki is often considered the main form of Slovincian, as it was the longest to continue to speak Slovincian.

The eastern dialect stretches from Smołdzino to Stojcino.

The western dialect includes the territory by Lake Gardno (Gardna Wielka and Gardna Mała) excluding Stojcino, as Stojcino had more economic and religious ties with Smołdzino.

Major differences between East and West include:
# the Proto-Slavic vowels &quot;*i&quot;, &quot;*y&quot;, &quot;*u&quot;, &quot;*ę&quot; after hard consonants (and after ⟨c, dz⟩ in the West) became [æ] in the East and [ɛ] in the West, phonemically ⟨ë⟩ /ə/;
# Slovincian diphthongs ⟨ê⟩ [ɪɛ] and ⟨ô⟩ [ʉɵ] are monophthongized before nasals in stressed syllables in Western Slovincian and preserved as diphthongs in Eastern;
# in the dative singular masculine, Eastern Slovincian has the endings ⟨-ojú⟩ or ⟨-ejú⟩, whereas the West Slovincian has the endings ⟨-ôjú⟩ and ⟨-ejú⟩.

Eastern has the subdialects of:
# Smołdzino and Żeleskie (Kluki Żeleskie), which has the following features: Proto-Slavic ǫ is preserved in every position, nasalization of the diphthongs ⟨ó⟩ [ou] and ⟨o⟩ [ɑu] in stressed syllables before nasal consonants, /v, f/ can be pronounced as [w, ʍ], universal retention of softness in ⟨czwj⟩ (e.g. &quot;czwjardi&quot; from &quot;*tvьrdъ&quot; (compare Polish )), and verbs of class III2D (first person ⟨-újã⟩) are formed not only from the stem ⟨-aja-⟩ but also ⟨-owa-⟩;
# Smołdziński Las and Czołpino, characterized by the fact that the syllable-final labiodental ⟨v, f⟩ can be pronounced as [w, ʍ] after [ou];
# Stojcino, where ⟨õ⟩ can be pronounced as [ou] in initial position and stressed final position, but remains [oũ] in unstressed final position, and all vowels and diphthongs are realized as weakly nasalized in stressed syllables before nasals.

Western has the subdialects of:
# Gardna Wielka, where [ʉɵ] can be pronounced as [ʉ], ⟨e⟩ and ⟨ô⟩ have become [i] and [ʉ] in unstressed syllables before nasals, and [ɪɛ] and [ʉɵ] can be pronounced as [i] and [ʉ] before ⟨rsz⟩;
# Gardna Mała, where [ɛ] is [i] in unstressed syllables before nasals after soft consonants;
# Wysoka, Retowo, Łódki, Czysta, and the historic &quot;Blottken&quot; (now part of Wysoka, coordinates: 54.633611,17.143906), where the vowels [ʉ] and [ɵ] have become [u] and [o], and the diphthongs [ʉɵ] and [ɵʉ] correspond here to [uo] and [ou], and [ɛ] has become [i] in unstressed syllables before nasals after soft consonants.

There existed a dialect in Rowy, extinct already in the 19th century, some of whose toponyms have been preserved.

Stowięcino has a transitional subdialect between East and West. Lorentz claims that [a] here is more back than in Kluki, while Rudnicki claims it is more front.

The use of ⟨-aja-⟩ and ⟨-owa-⟩ for ⟨-owac⟩ verbs could have been common to all three villages, but might have been absent in Witkowo.

==Classification==
Lorentz points to shared features between Slovincian and Kashubian such as ⟨ë⟩ for old short &quot;*i&quot;, &quot;*y&quot;, &quot;*u&quot;, and Kashubization pointed to five features distinguishing Slovincian as a language distinct from Kashubian:
# the diphthongization of Proto-Slavic &quot;*o&quot; &gt; Kashubian ⟨ò⟩ after labial and velar consonants is ⟨ô⟩ in Slovincian;
# Kashubian ⟨wò, wù⟩ are pronounced /we, wu/, whereas ⟨w⟩ as /v/ is retained in Slovincian;
# ⟨w⟩, which is always used as a spirant in the final syllable in Kashubian, has become a semi-vowel in Slovincian after ⟨o, ó, ú⟩;
# Slovincian, like Polabian, underwent bylaczenie, unlike Kashubian; Lorentz also posits a retention of hard ⟨ł⟩ in some positions, making this a partial merger;
# Slovincian treats class III2C verbs (first person singular ⟨-újã⟩) differently than Kashubian.

Nitsch made the following counterarguments to each point:
# the first difference is about as large as some differences between standard Polish and dialects of Polish;
# the second difference is also small;
# this is not a shift of /v/ to a semivowel in some positions but rather a loss of /v/ between the semivowel /u̯/ and a pause;
# this is not partial bylaczenie but rather there was a loss of *l in similar positions as *v, and all other remaining *l merged with *ľ;
# this difference is a neologism created in Slovincian but is ultimately minor.

Since then, most scholars have classified Slovincian as a dialect of Kashubian.

<text>The Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD or LA City Fire) provides firefighting services as well as technical rescue services, hazardous materials services, and emergency medical services to the citizens of the city of Los Angeles, California, United States. The LAFD is responsible for approximately four million people who live in the agency&#x27;s jurisdiction. The Los Angeles Fire Department was founded in 1886 and is the third largest municipal fire department in the United States, after the New York City Fire Department and the Chicago Fire Department. The department is sometimes also referred to as the &quot;Los Angeles City Fire Department&quot; or &quot;LA City Fire&quot; to distinguish it from the Los Angeles County Fire Department, which serves unincorporated areas and, via contracts, other incorporated municipalities within Los Angeles County without their own fire departments. The department is currently under the command of acting Fire Chief Ronnie Villanueva after former LAFD Chief Kristen Crowley was fired by Los Angeles City Mayor, Karen Bass following the 2025 Southern California Wildfires, she was removed because she refused to write an after-action report.

==History==
The Los Angeles Fire Department has it origins in the year 1871. In September of that year, George M. Fall, the County Clerk for Los Angeles County organized Engine Company No. 1. It was a volunteer firefighting force with an Amoskeag fire engine and a hose jumper (cart). The equipment was hand-drawn to fires. In the spring of 1874, the fire company asked the Los Angeles City Council to purchase horses to pull the engine. The Council refused and the fire company disbanded.

Many of the former members of Engine Company No. 1 reorganized under the name of Thirty-Eights No. 1 in May 1875, Engine Co. No. 2 was organized under the name Confidence Engine Company.

Los Angeles acquired its first &quot;hook and ladder&quot; truck for the Thirty-Eights. It proved to be too cumbersome and was ill-adapted to the needs of the city. It was sold to the city of Wilmington. In 1876, another &quot;hook and ladder&quot; truck was purchased, serving in the city until 1881.

In 1878, a third fire company was formed by the residents in the neighborhood of Sixth Street and Park. It was given the name of &quot;Park Hose Co. No. 1&quot;. East Los Angeles formed a hose company named &quot;East Los Angeles Hose Co. No. 2&quot; five years later. The final volunteer company was formed in the fall of 1883 in the Morris Vineyard area. This company was called &quot;Morris Vineyard Hose Co. No.3.&quot;

All of these companies remained in service until February 1, 1886, when the present paid fire department came into existence.
In 1877, the first horses were bought for the city fire department. The department would continue to use horses for its equipment for almost fifty years, phasing out the last horse drawn equipment on July 19, 1921.
By 1900, the department had grown to 18 fire stations with 123 full-time paid firefighters and 80 fire horses. The city had also installed 194 fire-alarm boxes allowing civilians to sound the alarm if a fire was spotted. 660 fire hydrants were placed throughout the city, giving firefighters access to a reliable water source. In 1955 Station 78 in Studio City became the first racially integrated station in the department.

Since 1978 the LAFD has provided emergency medical and fire suppression services to the city of San Fernando by contract.

In responses to the 2020 pandemic, the LAFD has helped to administer the COVID-19 vaccine to residents from Los Angeles. Also, more than 1,800 Los Angeles firefighters have received the COVID-19 vaccine.

In 2022, Kristin Crowley became the first female, and the first openly gay, chief of the LAFD.

==Organization==

=== Administration ===
Administration has the official office for the Fire Chief of the department. CAD designation of &#x27;FC1&#x27; and radio designation of &#x27;Fire Chief&#x27;. The Fire Chief reports directly to the Board of Fire Commissioners.

===Executive Bureau / Chief of Staff===
Executive Bureau/Chief Of Staff is commanded by a Deputy Chief (Bureau Commander) who holds the title of Chief of Staff. The Chief of Staff is assisted by an Executive Administrative Assistant II and Senior Management Analyst I. In 2022, the Executive Bureau was changed from the previous name of Administration Bureau.

==Rank structure==
==Types of apparatus==
The department utilizes a wide array of apparatus and equipment. These are most but not all of the apparatus.

===Triple combination engines===
The triple combination fire engine or “triple” (as it is commonly called) is the most common type of firefighting apparatus in Los Angeles. The term “triple combination” refers to the apparatus having three components; water tank, high capacity water pump, and hose. The triple can be found as a one-piece engine company or as two engines assigned to a Task Force station. The “triples” used by the LAFD have a direct drive, dual centrifuge main pump rated at 1,500 GPM at 150 psi with a 10-foot lift through a 6-inch suction. These apparatus carry a combination of all of the following sizes of hose; 4″, 2″, 1 3/4″, 1 1/2″ and 1″. The standard hose load is 750&#x27; of 4&quot;, 750&#x27; of 2 1/2&quot; with a 325GPM nozzle, 400&#x27; of 1 3/4&quot; with a 200 GPM nozzle, 400&#x27; of 1 1/2&quot; with a 125 GPM nozzle and 500&#x27; of 1&quot; with a dual gallonage 10/40 GPM nozzle. The water tank carrying capacity of all LAFD engines is 500 gallons. All frontline engines are equipped with a 30-gallon Class A foam injection system with the exception of Engine 51 at LAX that carries Class B foam in the onboard system. These apparatus are staffed by four members, including a captain who is the company commander, an engineer responsible for driving, maintaining and operating the pump, and two firefighters. A number of triples in the LAFD are also paramedic assessment companies – meaning they include a firefighter/paramedic as part of the crew. All engines are equipped with fire suppression gear as well as basic rescue equipment and emergency medical services equipment.

===Light Forces and Task Forces===

The LAFD uses the concept of Light Forces and Task Forces which can be considered one &quot;Resource&quot;, although comprising more than one unit or company.

A Light Force is composed of a Pump Engine (200 Series, for example Engine 201 or Engine 301 for 100 stations) and a Ladder Truck. Light forces will almost always respond together as one unit or resource.

A Task Force is simply a Light Force coupled with an Engine. An Engine Company is considered a single unit or &quot;resource&quot; when responding to incidents on its own. A Task Force usually responds to larger incidents, such as structural fires, and is made up of an Engine, a 200 Series Engine (Pump), and a Truck, all operating together. While a standard Engine is always staffed with a full crew, a 200 Series Engine (Pump)is only staffed by a driver (and one other firefighter if responding as part of a Light Force). The purpose of the 200 Series Engine (Pump) is to provide support and equipment to the Truck in a Light Force, and either the Truck Company or the Engine Company in a Task Force.

===Rescue Ambulances===

Rescue Ambulances (RAs), often called &#x27;rescues&#x27; for short, can be considered either Paramedic/advanced life support (ALS), or Emergency Medical Technician/basic life support (BLS) units. Ambulances number 1-112 are frontline Advanced Life Support Units staffed by 2 firefighter / paramedics, while those in the 200 series are Advanced Life Support reserve units. Ambulances in the 800s &amp; 900s are Basic Life Support Units staffed by 2 firefighter EMTs, with 900-series units assigned to Stations identified numerically over 100. Rescue Ambulances have Cardiac Defibrillators and Monitors, Cardiac Drugs, Intubation and Airway supplies and other equipment for Emergency Medical Responses.

===Helicopters===

The Air Operations Section (AIROPS) of the LAFD operates out of Fire Station 114 at Van Nuys Airport (KVNY). The helicopter fleet consists of five Medium Duty helicopters and two Light Duty helicopters, making the Department capable of handling brush fire suppression, air ambulance transport, high rise fire response, and hoist rescues.

&quot;FIRE 1&quot;, &quot;FIRE 2&quot;, &quot;FIRE 3&quot;, &quot;FIRE 4&quot;, and &quot;FIRE 5&quot; are all AgustaWestland AW139s. &quot;FIRE 6&quot; and &quot;FIRE 7&quot; are both Bell 206 B-III Jet Rangers.
The department previously operated Bell 205 and Bell 412 types, the last of which was retired in 2017 to make way for the newer AW139s.

===Fireboats===
The Port of Los Angeles is under the jurisdiction of the LAFD which operates 5 fireboats to provide fire protection for ships and dockside structures. &quot;Fireboat 1&quot;, &quot;Fireboat 3&quot; and &quot;Fireboat 5&quot; are identical long aluminum fireboats capable of a top speed of while fully loaded. They are equipped with a pump and a deluge gun. They also have a firefighting foam capacity.

&quot;Fireboat 4&quot;, also known as the &quot;Bethel F. Gifford&quot;, was commissioned in 1962 and is the oldest of the fleet. It is capable of pumping water at and carries of foam solution for petrochemical fires. It is equipped with jet-stream nozzles to allow for increased maneuverability.

The newest and most technologically advanced of the fireboats is the long &quot;Fireboat 2&quot;, also known as the &quot;Warner Lawrence&quot;, which has the capability to pump up to up to in the air. Boat 2 also has an onboard area for treatment and care of rescued persons.

=== USAR Task Force 1===
The Los Angeles Fire Department is the founding member of one of California&#x27;s eight FEMA Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces. California Task Force 1 (CA-TF1) is available to respond to natural or man-made disasters around the country and world and assist with search and rescue, medical support, damage assessment and communications.

== Command structure ==

The LAFD is divided into four operational Bureaus: Operations Central Bureau (OCB), Operations West Bureau (OWB), Operations South Bureau (OSB); formerly known as &#x27;South Division&#x27;, and Operations Valley Bureau (OVB); formerly known as &#x27;North Division&#x27;. Each Bureau is commanded by a Deputy Chief, who holds the title of &#x27;Bureau Commander&#x27;. Each Bureau also has an Assistant Chief who serves as the &#x27;Assistant Bureau Commander&#x27;. To replicate the former North and South Division, Operations Central Bureau (OCB) and Operations Valley Bureau (OVB) also have three additional Assistant Chiefs who work 24-hour platoon duty. These Assistant Chiefs staff marked Dodge RAM SUVs and respond to major incidents - Command 22 for Operations Central Bureau (OCB) and Command 42 of Operations Valley Bureau (OVB).

* Operations Central Bureau compromises of 3 battalions and 22 Fire Stations. Battalion 1 (8 Fire Stations), Battalion 2 (8 Fire Stations) and Battalion 11 (6 Fire Stations). Operations Central Bureau headquarters are located at Fire Station 3 located in Civic Center and Bunker Hill.
* Operations West Bureau compromises of 3 battalions and 21 Fire Stations. Battalion 4 (7 Fire Stations), Battalion 5 (7 Fire Stations) and Battalion 9 (7 Fire Stations). Operations West Bureau headquarters are located at Fire Station 82 located in Hollywood
* Operations South Bureau compromises 3 battalions and 25 Fire Stations. Battalion 6 (11 Fire Stations), Battalion 13 (8 Fire Stations), Battalion 18 (6 Fire Stations). Operations South Bureau headquarters is located at the San Pedro Municipal Building (638 South Beacon Street, Suite 374).
* Operations Valley Bureau compromises of 5 battalions and 31 Fire Stations. Battalion 10 (9 Fire Stations), Battalion 12 (7 Fire Stations), Battalion 14 (7 Fire Stations), Battalion 15 (8 Fire Stations) and Battalion 17. Operations Valley Bureau headquarters is temporarily located at Fire Station 83 located in Encino.

Each of the four operational Bureaus house a number of battalions. These battalions are staffed by uniformed personnel who rotate on a 24-hour platoon duty. Each battalion is commanded by a Battalion Chief, who responds to major incidents within their battalion, usually 20-30 square miles in size. They have the responsibility of commanding these scenes as the Incident Commander (IC). Battalion Chiefs typically respond to these incidents with a Firefighter/Specialist, who holds the title of Emergency Incident Technician (EIT). EITs drive the Dodge RAM SUV to the scenes and act as an assistant to the Battalion Chief.

Note that stations with a truck and a 200 series engine (pump) will usually respond the two apparatus together as a lightforce. So, for example, Truck 1 and Engine 201 will often respond together as &quot;Light Force 1&quot;. The only full time exception is Fire Station 9 where Engine 209 is fully staffed. Truck 9 responds as a single company when appropriate. During &quot;Augmented Staffing&quot; (red-flag brush fire weather, or other increased threat days) the 200 series engines can be fully staffed as a 4-member Engine Company. Each company can then either be dispatched individually or as a &quot;Task Force&quot;.

400 series Engines are ready reserve apparatus. These apparatus are full loaded with equipment and hose. They are used either for short term relief IE when a frontline apparatus is shut down for repair or maintenance. 400 series Engines are also staffed as needed during &quot;High Hazard&quot; days or other augmented staffing times.

The LAFD has six Type 3 wildland Engines. Five are property of the State of California OES but are staffed as needed and maintained by the LAFD. Together these 5 Engines form Strike Team 1880C. Engine 482C is housed at Fire Station 82 and is a ready reserve Type 3 wildland Engine.

<text>A one-hit wonder is any entity that achieves mainstream popularity, often for only one piece of work, and becomes known among the general public solely for that momentary success. The term is most commonly used in regard to music performers with only one hit single that overshadows their other work. Some artists dubbed &quot;one-hit wonders&quot; in a particular country had achieved success in other countries. Music artists with subsequent popular albums and hit listings are not properly considered a one-hit wonder, although artists with multiple hits have sometimes been erroneously labelled as &quot;one-hit wonders&quot; if one particular hit has become much more well-remembered years or decades later than their other hits. One-hit wonders usually see their popularity decreasing after their hit listing, and most often never return to hit listings with other songs or albums.

==Music industry==
In &quot;The Billboard Book of One-Hit Wonders,&quot; music journalist Wayne Jancik defines a one-hit wonder as &quot;an act that has won a position on [the] national, pop, Top 40 record chart just once.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine defines a U.S. one-hit wonder as an &quot;artist that cracks the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 and never makes it back to that position.&quot;

This formal definition can include acts with greater success outside their lone pop hit and who are not typically considered one-hit wonders, while at the same time excluding acts who have multiple hits which have been overshadowed by one signature song, or those performers who never hit the top 40, but had exactly one song achieve mainstream popularity in some other fashion (that is, a &quot;turntable hit&quot; or a song that was ineligible for the top-40 charts).

<text>Landkreis Emsland () is a district in Lower Saxony, Germany named after the river Ems. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Leer, Cloppenburg and Osnabrück, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (district of Steinfurt), the district of Bentheim in Lower Saxony, and the Netherlands (provinces of Drenthe and Groningen).

== History ==

For a long time the region of the Emsland was extremely sparsely populated, due to the fens on both sides of the river. Small villages were established in medieval times along the river and on the Hümmling. In the 13th century the bishops of Münster gained control over the region; the Emsland remained property of the bishop until 1803, when the clerical states were dissolved. It came under rule of Prussia and Arenberg, but after the Napoleonic Wars the Congress of Vienna decided to hand the territory over to the Kingdom of Hanover. The Duchy of Arenberg continued to exist as a fief of the Hanoverian kings. When Hanover was annexed by Prussia (1866), the dukes were deposed soon after (1875).

The now Prussian Province of Hanover was subdivided into districts in 1885; four districts were established on the territory of what is now the Landkreis Emsland. The districts were merged in 1977 to form the present district.

Under Nazi rule, labour camps known as the &quot;Emslandlager&quot; (&quot;Emsland camps&quot;) held thousands of political opponents of the Nazi Party, located outside Börgermoor, now part of the commune Surwold, not far from Papenburg. A memorial of these camps, the Dokumentations- und Informationszentrum (DIZ) Emslandlager, is located at Papenburg. The well known resistance song &quot;Peat Bog Soldiers&quot; was composed by political prisoners at one of these camps.

In 1950 a governmental plan for the development of Emsland was adopted. Its aim was to turn the region into an industrial location. This was accomplished by draining the fens and establishing projects like the test track of the maglev &quot;Transrapid&quot; and several large shipyards such as the Meyer-Werft in Papenburg. Although the Landkreis Emsland lost much of its original character, some areas retain their natural character, for example the Hümmling.

The 1977 district reforms in Lower Saxony united the former districts of Lingen, Meppen and Aschendorf-Hümmling in the district of Emsland, with Meppen as administrative seat. The Emsland remains a very Roman Catholic region compared to other parts of Lower Saxony.

== Geography ==
The district is located on the Dutch border. It is named after the Ems river, which crosses the region from south to north. It is an absolutely plain countryside, which was once full of fens. The only elevations are in the Hümmling, which is a hilly forest area east of the Ems.

Although the Emsland region is nowadays primarily a county among many others in Lower Saxony, its locals have what could be called a distinct sense of regional pride which will unlikely be found elsewhere in this state.

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms displays:

* a megalithic grave, typical for the Hümmling area
* the roses from the arms of the Duchy of Arenberg
* the anchor from the arms of the County of Lingen
The wavy line symbolises the river Ems.

<doc id="150296" wikidata="Q208075" url="?curid=150296" title="McDonnell Douglas DC-10">
<text>The McDonnell Douglas DC-10 is an American trijet wide-body aircraft manufactured by McDonnell Douglas.

The DC-10 was intended to succeed the DC-8 for long-range flights. It first flew on August 29, 1970; it was introduced on August 5, 1971, by American Airlines.
The trijet has two turbofans on underwing pylons and a third one at the base of the vertical stabilizer.
The twin-aisle layout has a typical seating for 270 in two classes.

The initial DC-10-10 had a range for transcontinental flights. The DC-10-15 had more powerful engines for hot and high airports. The DC-10-30 and –40 models (with a third main landing gear leg to support higher weights) each had intercontinental ranges of up to . The KC-10 Extender (based on the DC-10-30) is a tanker aircraft that was primarily operated by the United States Air Force.
Early operations of the DC-10 were afflicted by its poor safety record, which was partially attributable to a design flaw in the original cargo doors that caused multiple incidents, including fatalities. Most notable was the crash of Turkish Airlines Flight 981 in Paris in 1974, the deadliest crash in aviation history up to that time. Following the crash of American Airlines Flight 191, the deadliest aviation accident in U.S. history, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) temporarily banned all DC-10s from American airspace in June 1979. In August 1983, McDonnell Douglas announced that production would end due to a lack of orders, as it had widespread public apprehension after the 1979 crash and a poor fuel economy reputation. As design flaws were rectified and fleet hours increased, the DC-10 achieved a long-term safety record comparable to those of similar-era passenger jets.
The DC-10 outsold the similar Lockheed L-1011 TriStar due to the latter&#x27;s delayed introduction and high cost. Production of the DC-10 ended in 1989, with 386 delivered to airlines along with 60 KC-10 tankers. It was succeeded by the lengthened, heavier McDonnell Douglas MD-11.
After merging with McDonnell Douglas in 1997, Boeing upgraded many in-service DC-10s as the MD-10 with a glass cockpit that eliminated the need for a flight engineer. In February 2014, the DC-10 made its last commercial passenger flight. Cargo airlines continued to operate a small number as freighters. The Orbis Flying Eye Hospital is a DC-10 adapted for eye surgery. A few DC-10s have been converted for aerial firefighting use. Some DC-10s are on display, while other retired aircraft are in storage.

==Development==
===Background===
Following an unsuccessful proposal for the United States Air Force&#x27;s CX-HLS (Heavy Logistics System) in 1965, Douglas Aircraft began design studies based on its CX-HLS submission. The aviation author John H. Fielder notes that the company was under competitive pressure to produce a wide-body aircraft, having been somewhat slow in the previous decade to introduce its first jetliners. In 1966, American Airlines offered a specification to manufacturers for a twin-engine wide-body aircraft smaller than the Boeing 747 yet capable of flying similar long-range routes from airports with shorter runways; this specification would be highly influential in the design of what would become the DC-10. It would become McDonnell Douglas&#x27;s first commercial airliner after the merger between McDonnell Aircraft Corporation and Douglas Aircraft Company in 1967.

An early DC-10 design proposal was for a four-engine double-deck wide-body jet airliner with a maximum seating capacity of 550 passengers and similar in length to a DC-8. The proposal was shelved in favor of a trijet single-deck wide-body airliner with a maximum seating capacity of 399 passengers, and similar in length to the DC-8 Super 60. The choice of three engines was influenced by surveys of potential customers other than American Airlines, together with a desire to enhance hot and high climb performance after an engine failure—a serious concern at Stapleton International Airport, which was heavily utilized by United Airlines, one of the major anticipated buyers. Large portions of the detailed design work, particularly that of the fuselage, were subcontracted to external companies, such as the American aerospace company Convair. The legal relationship between McDonnell Douglas, Convair, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) would later serve to complicate matters; specifically, Convair was forbidden from contacting the regulator no matter the severity of any safety concerns it had in the DC-10&#x27;s design.

McDonnell Douglas management became seriously concerned about the viability of the DC-10 after learning about the competing Lockheed L-1011, which was very similar and was being offered to the same customers. On February 19, 1968, in what was supposed to be a knockout blow to Lockheed, George A. Spater, President of American Airlines, and James S. McDonnell of McDonnell Douglas announced American Airlines&#x27; intention to acquire the DC-10. This was a shock to Lockheed and there was general agreement within the U.S. aviation industry that American Airlines had left its competitors at the starting gate. According to Fielder, McDonnell Douglas had been urgently pursuing the DC-10&#x27;s completion in light of the prospective competition and the high financial stakes involved. Together with American Airlines&#x27; announcement of the DC-10 order, it was also reported that American Airlines had declared its intention to have the British Rolls-Royce RB211 turbofan engine on its DC-10 airliners. The DC-10 was first ordered by launch customers American Airlines with 25 orders, and United Airlines with 30 orders and 30 options in 1968. The DC-10&#x27;s similarity to the Lockheed L-1011 in design, passenger capacity, and launch date resulted in a sales competition that affected the profitability of both aircraft.

===Into flight===

On August 29, 1970, the first DC-10, a series 10, conducted its maiden flight. An extensive flight test program was carried out, totaling 929 flights and 1,551 flight hours; the test program was not incident-free: during one ground test in 1970, an outwardly-opening cargo door blew out and resulted rapid pressurization changes that caused the main cabin&#x27;s floor to collapse. This discovery and first effort at rectification led to a contract dispute between McDonnell Douglas and Convair over what changes were necessary and financial liability. Fielder alleges that McDonnell Douglas consistently sought to minimize and postpone any design changes to the DC-10, although this attitude was not an explicit policy. In July 1971, Convair outlined the situation in a formal memo; almost a year later, it internally expressed concerns that the inadequate resolution would lead to loss of aircraft. Tragically, the initial rectification work would prove to be inadequate.

On July 29, 1971, the FAA issued the type certificate for the DC-10, permitting its entry into revenue service. It entered commercial service with American Airlines on August 5, 1971, with the initial flight being a round-trip flight between Los Angeles and Chicago. United Airlines also commenced DC-10 flights later that same month. American&#x27;s DC-10s were configured to seat a maximum of 206 passengers while United&#x27;s seated 222; both had six-across seating in first-class and eight-across (four pairs) in coach. They operated the first version of the DC-10, referred to as the &quot;domestic&quot; series 10, which had a range of with a typical passenger load and a range of with maximum payload.

===Further development===

Various models of the DC-10 promptly followed, such as the series 15, which had a typical load range of . The series 20 was powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D turbofan engines, whereas the series 10 and 30 engines were General Electric CF6. Prior to taking delivery of the aircraft, Northwest&#x27;s president asked that the &quot;series 20&quot; aircraft be redesignated &quot;series 40&quot; because the airliner was much improved over the original design. The FAA issued the certification for the series 40 on October 27, 1972. In 1972, the DC-10&#x27;s listed unit cost was reportedly US$20M ($ in prices).

The series 30 and 40 were longer-range &quot;international&quot; versions. The main visible difference between the models is that the series 10 has three sets of landing gear (one front and two main) while the series 30 and 40 have an additional centerline main gear. The center main two-wheel landing gear (which extends from the center of the fuselage) was added to distribute the extra weight and for additional braking. The series 30 had a typical load range of and a maximum payload range of . The series 40 had a typical load range of and a maximum payload range of .

The DC-10 had two engine options and introduced longer-range variants a few years after entering service; these allowed it to distinguish itself from its main competitor, the L-1011. Further models and derivatives of the DC-10 have been considered; perhaps the most radical of these being an unpursued twin-engined model akin to the Airbus A300. However, following a spate of fatal accidents, particularly the American Airlines Flight 191 crash (the deadliest aviation accident in US history) orders for the DC-10 had nosedived by 1980, the type having garnered a poor reputation that was widespread amongst the traveling public as well as prospective operators. Competitive pressure had also played a role, Boeing in particular had developed the 747SP variant specifically to better compete with the DC-10 and L-1011.

In December 1988, the 446th and final DC-10 rolled off the Long Beach, California Products Division production line and was delivered to Nigeria Airways in July 1989. The production run had exceeded the 1971 estimate of 438 deliveries needed to break even on the program; however, according to Fielder, the DC-10 had not reached the breakeven point by the end of production. As the final DC-10s were delivered, McDonnell Douglas started production of its successor, the MD-11, which was essentially a stretched derivative of the DC-10-30.

In the late 1980s, international travel was on the rise due to lower oil prices and more economic freedom, leading to a surge in demand for wide-body airliners. However, the Boeing 747-400, MD-11, Airbus A330/A340, and soon-to-be-built Boeing 777 were all behind schedule and could not fully meet the demand. Production of first-generation widebodies like the Boeing 747-100/200/300, L-1011, and DC-10 had ended, so the value of used DC-10-30s almost doubled, rising from less than $20 million to almost $40 million.

==Design==
The McDonnell Douglas DC-10 is a low-wing wide-body aircraft. It is sized to conduct medium to long-range flights, offering similar endurance to the larger Boeing 747 yet being able to use shorter runways and thus access airports that it could not. Dependent upon configuration, the main cabin can accommodate between 250 and 380 passengers across its main deck. The fuselage is split into two levels, the upper deck is the only one where passenger seating would be present as the smaller lower level is typically used for storage for baggage and food preparation; elevators are usually present to carry people and carts between the two levels. As originally designed, the floor of the main cabin was not strong enough to withstand full pressure differential, yet key control lines are routed through this floor, an approach that proved to be a key vulnerability.

The DC-10 is a trijet, being powered by three turbofan engines. Two of these engines are mounted on pylons that attach to the bottom of the wings, while the third engine is encased in a protective banjo-shaped structure that is mounted on the top of the rear fuselage. In comparison to the first generation of jetliners, these engines generated less noise and were usually smoke-free. The engines are equipped with thrust reversers which reduce the distance required when landing. Despite being considerably larger, the landing speed of the DC-10 was comparable to that of the contemporary Boeing 727.

The primary flight controls of the DC-10 consist of inboard and outboard ailerons, two-section elevators, and a two-section rudder; the secondary flight controls comprise leading edge slats, spoilers, and a dual-rate movable horizontal stabilizer. The vertical stabilizer with the rudder is mounted on top of the tail engine banjo while the horizontal stabilizer with its four-segment elevator is attached to the sides of the rear fuselage conventionally. The DC-10 is equipped with retractable tricycle landing gear. To enable higher gross weights, the later –30 and –40 series have an additional two-wheel main landing gear, which retracts into the center of the fuselage.

The DC-10 is capable of performing all-weather operations, a function that many preceding jetliners had been incapable of. From the onset, it could perform takeoffs and landings completely under autopilot. Cassette tapes were used to load preprogrammed flight plans into the flight computer. As originally built, the cockpit was operated by a flight crew of three; numerous DC-10s have received a retrofitted glass cockpit and the Advanced Common Flightdeck, which has &quot;significant commonality&quot; with that of the MD-11, thus eliminating the flight engineer and permitting the aircraft, re-designated &quot;MD-10&quot;, to be flown by a flight crew of two. Three independent hydraulic systems are present. The flight controls actuate many of the flight control surfaces across the airliner via these hydraulic circuits. The critical nature of these circuits and their vulnerability to damage in the tail area led to the addition of hydraulic fuses to prevent the total loss of fluid. Power for the hydraulics was derived from primary and reserve engine-driven pumps equipped on each of the three engines. Hydraulic power was required for flight control, there was no provision for reverting to manual flight control inputs.

: The –10CF is a convertible passenger and cargo transport version of the –10. Eight were delivered to Continental Airlines and one to United Airlines.

;DC-10-15
: The –15 variant was designed for use at hot and high airports. The series 15 is basically a –10 fitted with higher-thrust GE CF6-50C2F (derated DC-10-30 engines) powerplants. The –15 was first ordered in 1979 by Mexicana and Aeroméxico. Seven were completed between 1981 and 1983.

===Long-range variants===

;DC-10-30
:A long-range model and the most common model produced. It was built with General Electric CF6-50 turbofan engines, with larger fuel tanks and a larger wingspan to increase range and fuel efficiency, and with a set of rear center landing gear to support the increased weight. It was very popular with European flag carriers. A total of 163 were built from 1972 to 1988 and delivered to 38 different customers. The model was first delivered to KLM and Swissair on November 21, 1972, and first introduced in service on December 15, 1972, by the latter.
;DC-10-30CF
:The convertible cargo/passenger transport version of the DC-10-30. The first deliveries were to Overseas National Airways (ONA) and Trans International Airlines in 1973. A total of 27 were built.
;DC-10-30ER
:The extended-range version of the DC-10-30. The –30ER aircraft has a higher maximum takeoff weight of ; is powered by three GE CF6-50C2B engines each producing of thrust; and is equipped with an additional fuel tank in the rear cargo hold. It has an additional 700 mi of range to 6,600 mi (5,730 nmi; 10,620 km). The first of this variant was delivered to Finnair in 1981. A total of six were built and five –30s were later converted to –30ERs.
;DC-10-30AF
:Also known as the DC-10-30F. This was the all-freight version of the –30. Production was to start in 1979, but Alitalia did not confirm its order then. Production began in May 1984 after the first aircraft order from FedEx. A total of 10 were built.
;DC-10-40
:The first long-range version fitted with Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D engines. Originally designated &quot;DC-10-20&quot;, this model was renamed DC-10-40 after a special request from Northwest Orient Airlines: the aircraft was much improved compared to its original design, with a higher MTOW (on par with the Series 30) and with more powerful engines, and retains the increased wingspan from the DC-10-30. The airline&#x27;s president wanted to advertise that he had the latest version. The company also wanted its aircraft to be equipped with the same engines as its Boeing 747s for fleet commonality.
:Northwest Orient Airlines and Japan Airlines were the only airlines to order the Series 40, respectively ordering 22 and 20 aircraft. The Northwest DC-10-40s were delivered with improved engines, Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-20 engines producing of thrust and an MTOW of . The DC-10-40s delivered to Japan Airlines were equipped with P&amp;W JT9D-59A engines that produced a thrust of and an MTOW of .
:Forty-two DC-10-40s were built from 1973 to 1983. Externally, the DC-10-40 can be distinguished from the DC-10-30 by a slight bulge near the front of the nacelle for the #2 (tail) engine.
;DC-10-40D
:A domestic variant for Japan Airlines

=== Proposed variants ===

==== DC-10-20 ====
A proposed version of the DC-10-10 with extra fuel tanks, extensions on each wingtip, and a rear center landing gear. It was to use Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-15 turbofan engines, each producing of thrust, with a maximum takeoff weight of . However, engine improvements led to increased thrust and increased takeoff weight. Northwest Orient Airlines, one of the launch customers for this longer-range DC-10 requested the name change to DC-10-40.

==== DC-10-50 ====
A proposed version with Rolls-Royce RB211-524 engines for British Airways. The order never came and the plans for the DC-10-50 were abandoned after British Airways ordered the Lockheed L-1011-500 instead.

==== DC-10 Twin ====
Beginning in 1966, two-engine designs were studied for the DC-10 before the design settled on the three-engine configuration. Later, a big twin based on the DC-10 cross-section was proposed to Airbus as a 50/50 venture but was rejected. Then in 1971, a shortened DC-10 version with two engines was proposed as a competitor to the Airbus A300. McDonnell Douglas held a major presentation of the proposed DC-10 Twin at Long Beach, and several European airlines were willing to place orders. However on July 30, 1973, MDC&#x27;s board decided not to give the proposed twin the go-ahead, as no US airline had ordered it. Later, more DC-10 Twin proposals were made, either as a collaboration with a European manufacturer or as a solely McDonnell Douglas product, but none proceeded beyond design studies.

===Tanker versions===
The KC-10 Extender is a military version of the DC-10-30CF for aerial refueling. The aircraft was ordered by the U.S. Air Force and delivered from 1981 to 1988. A total of 60 were built. These aircraft are powered exclusively by General Electric CF6 turbofan engines.

The KDC-10 was an aerial refueling tanker for the Royal Netherlands Air Force. These were converted from civil airliners (DC-10-30CF) to a similar standard as the KC-10. Also, commercial refueling companies Omega Aerial Refueling Services and Global Airtanker Service operate three KDC-10 tankers for lease.

The DC-10 Air Tanker is a DC-10-based firefighting tanker aircraft, using modified water tanks from Erickson Air-Crane.

===MD-10 upgrade===

The MD-10 is an upgrade to add a glass cockpit to the DC-10 with the re-designation to &quot;MD-10&quot;. The upgrade included an Advanced Common Flightdeck similar to what was used on the MD-11 and was launched in September 1996. However, the actual avionics are shared with the Boeing 717, using the Honeywell VIA liquid-crystal-displays. The program was continued by Boeing after its merger with McDonnell Douglas in 1997, and the first MD-10 flew on April 14, 1999. The new cockpit eliminated the need for the flight engineer position and allowed common type rating with the MD-11. This has allowed companies such as FedEx Express, which operated both the MD-10 and MD-11, to use a common pilot pool for both aircraft. The MD-10 conversion now falls under the Boeing Converted Freighter program where Boeing&#x27;s international affiliate companies perform the conversions.

==Operators==

On January 8, 2007, Northwest Airlines retired its last remaining DC-10 from scheduled passenger service, thus ending the aircraft&#x27;s operations with major airlines. Regarding the retirement of Northwest&#x27;s DC-10 fleet, Wade Blaufuss, spokesman for the Northwest chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association said, &quot;The DC-10 is a reliable airplane, fun to fly, roomy and quiet, kind of like flying an old Cadillac Fleetwood. We&#x27;re sad to see an old friend go.&quot; Biman Bangladesh Airlines was the last commercial carrier to operate the DC-10 in passenger service. The airline flew the DC-10 on a regular passenger flight for the last time on February 20, 2014, from Dhaka, Bangladesh to Birmingham, UK. Local charter flights were flown in the UK until February 24, 2014. As of September 2024, two DC-10s are in commercial service, one with TAB Airlines, a Bolivian cargo airline operating scheduled flights in the Americas, and one with the Panamanian start-up Cargo Three, also in the Americas.

Non-airline operators included Omega Aerial Refueling Services with three DC-10 based KDC-10 tanker aircraft and the 10 Tanker Air Carrier with four modified DC-10-30s used for fighting wildfires. Orbis International has used a DC-10 as a flying eye hospital. Surgery is performed on the ground and the operating room is located between the wings for maximum stability. In 2008, Orbis replaced its aging DC-10-10 with a DC-10-30 jointly donated by FedEx and United Airlines. The newer DC-10 was converted into an MD-10 configuration and began flying as an eye hospital in 2010. A modified DC-10 is operated by the Missile Defense Agency as the Widebody Airborne Sensor Platform (WASP).

=== Airworthy aircraft ===

As of December 2024, there are 10 aircraft that are airworthy, as follows:
*1 with Transportes Aéreos Bolivianos (TAB) Cargo services
*1 as Orbis International flying hospital
*4 as firefighter aircraft with 10 Air tanker service as DC-10 airtanker
*2 with Omega Aerial Refueling Services as KDC-10
*1 with Cargo Three

==Accidents and incidents==
As of February 2025, the DC-10 had been involved in 55 accidents and incidents, including 32 hull-loss accidents, with 1,261 occupant fatalities. Of these accidents and incidents, it has been involved in nine hijackings resulting in one death and a bombing resulting in 170 occupant fatalities. Despite its poor safety record in the 1970s, which gave it an unfavorable reputation, the DC-10 has proved to be a reliable aircraft with a low overall accident rate as of 1998. The DC-10&#x27;s initially poor safety record has continuously improved as design flaws were rectified and fleet hours increased. The DC-10&#x27;s lifetime safety record is comparable to similar second-generation passenger jets as of 2008.

===Cargo-door problem===

The DC-10 has cargo doors that open outward; this allows the cargo area to be completely filled, as the doors do not occupy otherwise usable interior space when open. To overcome the outward force from pressurization of the fuselage at high altitudes, outward-opening doors must use heavy locking mechanisms. In the event of a door lock malfunction, there is greater potential for explosive decompression.

On June 12, 1972, American Airlines Flight 96 lost its aft cargo door above Windsor, Ontario. Before takeoff, the door appeared secure, but the internal locking mechanism was not fully engaged. When the aircraft reached approximately in altitude, the door blew out, and the resulting explosive decompression collapsed the cabin floor. Many control cables to the empennage were cut, leaving the pilots with very limited control of the aircraft. Despite this, the crew performed a safe emergency landing. U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators found the cargo-door design to be dangerously flawed, as the door could be closed without the locking mechanism fully engaged, and this condition was not apparent from visual inspection of the door nor from the cargo-door indicator in the cockpit. The NTSB recommended modifications to make it readily apparent to baggage handlers when the door was not secured and also recommended adding vents to the cabin floor so that the pressure difference between the cabin and cargo bay during decompression could quickly equalize without causing further damage. Although many carriers voluntarily modified the cargo doors, no airworthiness directive was issued, due to a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement between the head of the FAA, John H. Shaffer, and the head of McDonnell Douglas&#x27;s aircraft division, Jackson McGowen. McDonnell Douglas made some modifications to the cargo door, but the basic design remained unchanged, and problems persisted.

On March 3, 1974, in an accident circumstantially similar to American Airlines Flight 96, a cargo-door blowout caused Turkish Airlines Flight 981 to crash near Ermenonville, France, in the deadliest air crash in history at the time—346 passengers and crew died. The cargo door of Flight 981 had not been fully locked, though it appeared so to both cockpit crew and ground personnel. The Turkish aircraft had a seating configuration that exacerbated the effects of decompression, and as the cabin floor collapsed into the cargo bay, control cables were severed and the aircraft became uncontrollable. Investigators found that the DC-10&#x27;s relief vents were not large enough to equalize the pressure between the passenger and cargo compartments during explosive decompression. Following this crash, a special subcommittee of the United States House of Representatives investigated the cargo-door issue and the certification by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the original design. An airworthiness directive was issued, and all DC-10s underwent mandatory door modifications. The DC-10 experienced no more major incidents related to its cargo door after FAA-approved changes were made.

===Engine-related accidents===

On May 25, 1979, American Airlines Flight 191 crashed immediately after takeoff from Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport. Its left engine and pylon assembly swung upward over the top of the wing, severing the leading edge slat actuator hydraulic lines. The slats retracted under the aerodynamic forces, causing the left wing to stall. This, combined with asymmetric thrust due to the missing engine, caused the aircraft to rapidly roll to the left, descend, and crash, killing all 271 people on board and two on the ground. Following the crash, the FAA withdrew the DC-10&#x27;s type certificate on June 6, 1979, grounding all U.S.-registered DC-10s and those from nations with agreements with the United States, and banning all DC-10s from U.S. airspace. These measures were rescinded five weeks later on July 13, 1979, after the slat actuation and position systems were modified, along with stall warning and power supply changes. In November 1979, the FAA fined American Airlines for removing the engine and its pylon as a single unit in its maintenance procedure, thus damaging the structure and causing the engine separation, rather than removing the engine from the pylon before removing the pylon from the wing as advised by McDonnell Douglas.

On July 19, 1989, United Airlines Flight 232 crashed at Sioux City, Iowa, after an uncontained engine failure of the tail engine earlier in the flight disabled all hydraulic systems and rendered most flight controls inoperable. The flight crew, assisted by a deadheading DC-10 flight instructor, performed a partially controlled emergency landing by constantly adjusting the thrust of the remaining two engines; 185 people on board survived, but 111 others died, and the aircraft was destroyed. The DC-10 was designed without backup flight controls because it was considered extremely improbable that all hydraulic systems would fail. However, due to their close proximity under the tail engine, the engine failure ruptured all three, resulting in a total loss of control of the elevators, ailerons, spoilers, horizontal stabilizers, rudder, flaps, and slats. Following the accident, hydraulic fuses were installed in the #3 hydraulic system below the tail engine on all DC-10 aircraft to ensure that sufficient control remains if all three hydraulic systems are damaged in this area.

===Other accidents with fatalities===
* November 3, 1973: National Airlines Flight 27, a DC-10-10 cruising at , experienced an uncontained failure of the right engine. One cabin window separated from the fuselage after it was struck by debris flung from the exploding engine. The passenger sitting next to that window was killed and ejected from the aircraft. The crew initiated an emergency descent and landed the aircraft safely.
* March 1, 1978: Continental Airlines Flight 603, a DC-10-10, commenced a takeoff from Los Angeles International Airport when the recapped tread of a tire on the left main landing gear separated, causing the blowout of two adjacent tires, which ruptured a fuel tank. This, combined with excessive heat from the rejected takeoff, resulted in a massive fire. Two passengers were killed in the ensuing evacuation and two died later from injuries sustained in the accident.
* October 31, 1979: Western Airlines Flight 2605, a DC-10-10, collided with construction equipment after landing on a closed runway at Mexico City International Airport, killing 72 of the 88 people on board and one person on the ground. The crash was caused by failure to follow proper landing guidelines in consideration of the fog on the runway.
* November 28, 1979: Air New Zealand Flight 901, DC-10-30 ZK-NZP, crashed into Mount Erebus on Ross Island, Antarctica during a sightseeing flight over the continent, killing all 257 on board. The accident was caused by the flight coordinates being altered without the flight crew&#x27;s knowledge, combined with unique Antarctic weather conditions.
* January 23, 1982: World Airways Flight 30, DC-10-30CF registration N113WA, overran the runway at Boston Logan International Airport and slid into the shallow water of Boston Harbor. Two of the 200 passengers were not found; all other passengers and the 12 crew members survived.
* September 13, 1982: Spantax Flight 995, DC-10-30CF EC-DEG, was destroyed by fire after an aborted take-off at Málaga, Spain. A total of 50 passengers were killed and 110 injured due to the flames.
* July 24, 1987: Air Afrique Flight 056, flying from Fiumicino Airport, Italy, to Charles de Gaulle Airport, France, was hijacked immediately after departure. The aircraft thereafter landed at Geneva, Switzerland, for refueling. During the stopover, the hijacker executed a 28-year-old passenger. The aircraft was later stormed by Swiss police and the hijacker was subdued.
* July 27, 1989: Korean Air Flight 803, DC-10-30 HL7328, crashed short of the runway in bad weather while trying to land at Tripoli, Libya. Seventy-five of the 199 on board plus another four people on the ground were killed in the accident.
* September 19, 1989: UTA Flight 772, DC-10-30 N54629, crashed in the Ténéré Desert in Niger following an in-flight bomb explosion, killing all 170 people on board.
* December 21, 1992: Martinair Flight 495, DC-10-30CF PH-MBN, crashed while landing in bad weather at Faro, Portugal, killing 54 passengers and crew.
* June 13, 1996: Garuda Indonesia Flight 865, DC-10-30 PK-GIE, had just taken off from Fukuoka Airport, Japan, when a high-pressure blade from the right engine separated. The aircraft was just a few feet above the runway, and the pilot decided to abort the takeoff. Consequently, the DC-10 skidded off the runway and came to a halt past it, losing one of its engines and its landing gear. Three passengers perished in the accident.
*December 21, 1999: Cubana de Aviación Flight 1216, DC-10-30 F-GTDI, overran the runway at La Aurora International Airport, Guatemala City. Eight passengers and eight crew members on board were killed, as were two people on the ground.

===Other hull losses===
* December 17, 1973: Iberia Airlines Flight 933 crashed and struck the ALS system at Boston Logan International Airport which collapsed the front landing gear. All 168 passengers and crew survived. This is the first hull loss of a DC-10 aircraft.
* November 12, 1975: Overseas National Airways (ONA) Flight 032, DC-10-30CF N1032F, accelerated through a flock of seagulls during its takeoff roll from John F. Kennedy International Airport on a ferry flight. The captain initiated a rejected takeoff, but the right-hand engine exploded, causing a partial braking failure. The pilots steered off the runway to avoid plowing into a blast fence, causing the landing gear to collapse and rupturing a fuel tank; the ensuing fire destroyed the aircraft. All 139 on board—all ONA employees—survived with 32 suffering injuries.
* January 2, 1976: Saudi Arabian Airlines Flight 5130, DC-10-30CF N1031F leased from ONA, landed short of the runway at Istanbul-Yesilköy Airport, tearing off the left-hand engine and the left and center main landing gear. All 362 passengers evacuated safely while one of thirteen crew members was injured. The accident was attributed to an excessively low approach, possibly caused by the first officer using the radar altimeter for altitude reference over irregular terrain.
* December 3, 1983: Korean Air Lines Flight 084, DC-10-30 freighter HL7339, collided head-on during the takeoff roll with SouthCentral Air Flight 59, Piper PA-31 N35206, which was taking off from Anchorage International Airport. The Piper struck the DC-10&#x27;s left and center main landing gear and three passengers sustained minor injuries; the DC-10 overran the runway and the three crew suffered serious injuries. Investigators determined that the Korean Air Lines pilot became disoriented taxiing in fog, failed to follow correct procedures and confirm his position, and accidentally initiated takeoff from the wrong runway.
* May 21, 1988: American Airlines Flight 70, DC-10-30 N136AA, overran Runway 35L at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) after the flight crew attempted a rejected takeoff. Two crew were seriously injured and the remaining 12 crew and 240 passengers escaped safely. The accident was attributed to a shortcoming in the original design standards; no requirement had existed to test whether partially worn brake pads could stop the aircraft during a rejected takeoff, and 8 of the 10 worn pad sets had failed.
* April 14, 1993: American Airlines Flight 102, DC-10-30 N139AA, skidded off the runway on landing at DFW in a rainstorm, collapsing the nose and left main landing gear and badly damaging the left-hand engine and wing. Two passengers suffered serious injuries during the emergency evacuation, while the remaining 187 passengers and 13 crew escaped safely. The NTSB attributed the crash to poor directional control technique by the captain.
* September 5, 1996: FedEx Express Flight 1406, DC-10-10F N68055, suffered an in-flight cargo fire while flying from Memphis, Tennessee to Boston, Massachusetts. The aircraft made a successful emergency landing at Stewart International Airport in Newburgh, New York, however after evacuating all 5 crew members the aircraft was consumed by fire and destroyed. 
* December 18, 2003: FedEx Express Flight 647, MD-10-10F N364FE, was destroyed by fire after the right main landing gear collapsed due to a hard landing at Memphis International Airport. One of the two pilots and one of the five passengers—all deadheading FedEx employees—suffered minor injuries in the emergency evacuation.
* July 28, 2006: FedEx Express Flight 630, MD-10-10F N391FE, departed runway 18R and burned out at Memphis International Airport following the collapse of the left main landing gear. The two pilots and a single passenger suffered minor injuries during the emergency evacuation. The accident was attributed to improper landing gear maintenance.
* October 28, 2016: FedEx Express Flight 910, MD-10-10F N370FE, partially exited the runway at Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport following the collapse of the left main landing gear. The accident was attributed to improper landing gear maintenance.

===Other notable incidents===
* April 7, 1994: The flight crew of Federal Express Flight 705, DC-10-30 N306FE, was attacked by a deadheading FedEx employee in an attempted murder-suicide intended to cause the aircraft to crash. The seriously injured crew returned to Memphis International Airport after subduing the hijacker, using aerobatic maneuvers and damaging the aircraft in the process. The aircraft was repaired and returned in service.
* July 25, 2000: The right-hand thrust reverser cowl door of Continental Airlines Flight 55, DC-10-30 N13067, shed a strip of metal which landed on the runway at Charles de Gaulle Airport upon takeoff. Minutes later, Air France Flight 4590, operated by a Concorde, ran over the metal strip at high speed, bursting a tire and causing a fuel tank to rupture and burst into flames. The Concorde&#x27;s pilots attempted to keep control of the aircraft, but it stalled and crashed. The strip of metal was traced to third-party replacement parts not approved by the FAA.
* January 31, 2001: Japan Airlines Flight 958, DC-10-40D JA8546, was involved in a midair near collision with a Japan Airlines Boeing 747-400 near Yaizu. Both flight crews performed evasive maneuvers; all 677 aboard both aircraft survived, with nine aboard the 747-400 seriously injured.

<text>Rijsbergen a town in the municipality of Zundert in the southern Netherlands.

In the town used to be an AC (Aanmeldcentrum, i.e. Asylum Request Center).

Until 1997 Rijsbergen was an independent municipality, after which it was added to Zundert.

The skyline of Rijsbergen is dominated by the neo-Gothic Roman Catholic church of Saint Bavo, which was built in 1918 as a replacement of a smaller fourteenth-century church.
The church is situated in the town centre and is flanked by the former town hall, which has been transformed into a museum. Furthermore, in the outskirts of Rijsbergen a successful Garden Centre can be found named: &quot;De Bosrand&quot;. A deeply loved place by the locals. 

The countryside around Rijsbergen is dotted with eleven shrines devoted to the Virgin Mary. They were built after the Second World War as a thanksgiving for surviving the war relatively undamaged.

<text>Ealing () is a district in west London, England, west of Charing Cross in the London Borough of Ealing. It is the administrative centre of the borough and is identified as a major metropolitan centre in the London Plan.

Ealing was historically an ancient parish in the county of Middlesex. Until the urban expansion of London in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was a rural village. Improvement in communications with London, culminating with the opening of the railway station in 1838, shifted the local economy to market garden supply and eventually to suburban development. By 1902 Ealing had become known as the &quot;Queen of the Suburbs&quot; due to its greenery, and because it was halfway between city and country.

As part of the growth of London in the 20th century, Ealing significantly expanded and increased in population. It became a municipal borough in 1901 and part of Greater London in 1965. It is now a significant commercial and retail centre with a developed night-time economy. Ealing has the characteristics of both leafy suburban and inner-city development. The Pitshanger neighbourhood and some others retain the lower density, greenery and architecture of suburban villages. Ealing&#x27;s town centre is often referred to as &quot;Ealing Broadway&quot;, the name of both a railway interchange and a shopping centre.

Most of Ealing, including the commercial district, Ealing Broadway, South Ealing, Ealing Common, Montpelier, Pitshanger and most of Hanger Hill fall under the W5 postcode. Areas to the north-west of the town centre such as Argyle Road and West Ealing fall under W13 instead. West Twyford north-east of the town centre, near Hanger Hill, falls under the NW10 postcode area. The population of Ealing (including Northfields) was 85,014 at the 2011 census.

==History==
===Toponymy===
Ealing&#x27;s name derives from the Gillingas, a Saxon tribe mentioned in a charter issued by Æthelred of Mercia around the year 700. The Gillingas themselves took their name from a patriarch or chief called &quot;Gilla&quot;. The place-name appears as &quot;Yllinges&quot; around the year 1170 and as &quot;Elyng&quot; in 1553.

===Early history===
Archaeology evinces parts of Ealing have been lived in by neanderthal humans – the Lower Palaeolithic Age. The typical stone tool type of neanderthals, the Mousterian, is not found in south-east England, but Levallois type may be consistent with the hand axes found. These primitive hunters span a period of at least 300,000 years in Britain. Of the Iron Age, Milne lists six Carthaginian and pre-Roman bronze coins from Middlesex: Ashford and Ealing (Carthage coins); Edmonton (Seleucid (2), Rhegium, Bithynia coins). These are not so significant as for similar and more plentiful finds from Dorset, and Milne suggests that some represent parts of imported bronze scrap.
The Church of St. Mary&#x27;s, the parish church&#x27;s priest for centuries fell to be appointed by the Bishop of London, earliest known to be so in , when he gave the great tithes to Canon Henry for keeping St. Paul&#x27;s cathedral school. The church required frequent repair in the 1650s and was so ruinous in about 1675 that services were held elsewhere for several years. Worshippers moved to a wooden tabernacle in 1726 and the steeple fell in 1729, destroying the church, before its rebuilding. In the 12th century Ealing was amid a fields- and villages-punctuated forest covering most of the county from the southwest to the north of the City of London.

The earliest surviving English census is that for Ealing in January 1599. This list was a tally of all 85 households in Ealing village giving the names of the inhabitants, together with their ages, relationships and occupations. It survives in manuscript form at The National Archives (&quot;piece E 163/24/35&quot;), and was transcribed and printed by K J Allison for Ealing Historical Society in 1961.

Settlements were scattered throughout the parish. Many of them were along what is now called St. Mary&#x27;s Road, near to the church in the centre of the parish. There were also houses at Little Ealing, Ealing Dean, Haven Green, Drayton Green and Castlebar Hill.

The parish of Ealing was far from wholly divided among manors, such as those of Ealing, Gunnersbury and Pitshanger. These when used for crops were mostly wheat, but also barley and rye, with considerable pasture for cows, draught animals, sheep and recorded poultry keeping. There were five free tenements on Ealing manor in 1423: Absdons in the north, Baldswells at Drayton, Abyndons and Denys at Ealing village, and Sergeaunts at Old Brentford. It is likely that there had once been 32 copyhold tenements, including at least 19 virgates of 20 rateable acres and 9 half virgates. When created the copyhold land amounted to not more than , a total increased before 1423 by land at Castlebar Hill.

Ealing had an orchard in 1540 and others in 1577–8 and 1584. Numbers increased, as were orchards often taken out of open fields, by 1616 in Crowchmans field, in 1680–1 in Popes field, and in 1738 in Little North field. Some lay as far north as the centre of the parish. River Long field and adjoining closes at West Ealing contained 1,008 fruit trees in 1767, including 850 apple trees, 63 plum, and 63 cherry.

Ealing demesne in 1318 had a windmill, which was rebuilt in 1363–4. This was destroyed in or before 1409 and may have been repaired by 1431, when it was again broken.

Great Ealing School was founded in 1698 by the Church of St Mary&#x27;s. This became the &quot;finest private school in England&quot; and had many famous pupils in the 19th century such as William S. Gilbert, composer and impresario, and Cardinal Newman – since 2019 recognised as a saint. As the zone became built-up, the school declined and closed in April 1908.
The earliest maps of just the parish of Ealing survive from the 18th century; John Speed and others having made maps of Middlesex, more than two centuries before.

At Ealing a fair was held on the green in 1822, when William Cobbett chronicled he was diverted by crowds of Cockneys headed there. The fair, of unknown origin, was held from 24 to 26 June until suppressed in 1880.

The manor included Old Brentford and its extensive Thames fisheries, and in 1423 tenants of Ealing manor rented three fisheries in the Thames. In 1257 the king ordered the Bishop whoever it may be from time to time (sede vacante) to provide 8,000-10,000 lampreys and other fish for owning the manor, impliedly per year, which shows the extent of the local catch.

===Suburb of London===
With the exception of driving animals into London on foot, the transport of heavy goods tended be restricted to those times when the non-metalled roads were passable due to dry weather. With the passing of the Toll Road Act, this highway was gravelled and so the old Oxford Road became an increasingly busy and important thoroughfare running from east to west through the centre of the parish. This road was later renamed as Uxbridge Road. The well-to-do of London began to see Ealing as a place to escape from the smoke and smells. In 1800 the architect John Soane bought Payton Place and renamed it Pitzhanger Manor, not to live but just for somewhere green and pleasant, where he could entertain his friends and guests. Soon afterward, in 1801, the Duke of Kent bought a house at Castlebar. Soon, more affluent Londoners followed but with the intention of taking up a permanent residence which was conveniently close to London. The only British prime minister to be assassinated, Spencer Perceval, made his home at Elm House. Up until that point, Ealing was mostly made up of open countryside and fields where, as in previous centuries, the main occupation was farming.

===Old inns and public houses===
As London grew in size, more food and materials went in and more finished goods came out. Since dray horses can only haul loads a few miles per day, frequent overnight stops were needed. To satisfy this demand a large number of inns were situated along the Uxbridge Road, where horses could be changed and travellers refresh themselves, prompting its favour by highwaymen. Stops in Ealing included The Feathers, The Bell, The Green Man and The Old Hats.
At one point in history there were two pubs called the Old Hat(s) either side of one of the many toll gates on the Uxbridge Road in West Ealing. Following the removal of the toll gate the more Westernmost pub was renamed The Halfway House.

===Expansion===
As London developed, the area became predominantly market gardens which required a greater proportion of workers as it was more labour-intensive. Ealing Grove School was established in 1834, integrating both academic and agricultural education. In the 1850s, with improved travel (the Great Western Railway and two branches of the Grand Union Canal), villages began to grow into towns and merged into unbroken residential areas. At this time Ealing began to be called the &quot;Queen of the Suburbs&quot;.

Mount Castle Tower, an Elizabethan structure which stood at the top of Hanger Hill, was used as a tea-stop in the 19th century. It was demolished to make way for Fox&#x27;s Reservoir in 1881. This reservoir, with a capacity of , was erected north of Hill Crest Road, Hanger Hill, in 1888 and a neighbouring reservoir for was constructed . This supply of good water helped to make Ealing more attractive than ever.

Mount Castle Tower was also known as Hanger Hill Tower, and as such it was a vital viewing point for the Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790), which linked the Royal Greenwich Observatory with the Paris Observatory via a chain of trigonometric readings. This survey was led in England by General William Roy. Hanger Hill Tower was its northernmost observation point, and from it sightings were made to places such as St Ann&#x27;s Hill in Chertsey, Banstead, Upper Norwood, and the Greenwich Observatory itself.

===Modern Victorian suburb===

The most important changes to Ealing occurred in the 19th century. The building of the Great Western Railway in the 1830s, part of which passed through the centre of Ealing, led to the opening of a railway station on the Broadway in 1879, originally called Haven Green. In the next few decades, much of Ealing was rebuilt, predominantly semi-detached housing designed for the rising middle-class. Gas mains were laid and an electricity generating station was built. Better transport links, including horse buses as well as trains, enabled people to more easily travel to work in London. All this, whilst living in what was still considered to be the countryside. Although much of the countryside was rapidly disappearing during this period of rapid expansion, parts of it were preserved as public parks, such as Lammas Park and Ealing Common. Pitzhanger Manor and the extensive grounds on which it stands, was sold to the council in 1901 by Sir Spencer Walpole, which had been bought by his father the Rt. Hon. Spencer Horatio Walpole and thus became Walpole Park.

During the Victorian period, Ealing became a town. This meant that good, well-metalled roads had to be built, and schools and public buildings erected. To protect public health, the newly created Board of Health for Ealing commissioned London&#x27;s first modern drainage and sewage systems here. Just as importantly, drinking fountains providing wholesome and safe water were erected by public prescription. Ealing Broadway became a major shopping centre. The man responsible for much of all this was Charles Jones, Borough Surveyor from 1863 to 1913. He directed the planting of the horse chestnut trees on Ealing Common and designed Ealing Town Hall, both the present one and the older structure which is now a bank (on the Mall). He even oversaw the purchase of the Walpole estate grounds and its conversion into a leisure garden for the general public to enjoy and promenade around on Sundays.

===Queen of the Suburbs===

In 1901, Ealing Urban District was incorporated as a municipal borough, Walpole Park was opened and the first electric trams ran along the Uxbridge Road. As part of its permit to operate, the electric tram company was required to incorporate the latest in modern street lighting into its overhead catenary supply, along the Ealing section of the Uxbridge Road. A municipally-built generating station near Clayponds Avenue supplied power to more street lighting that ran northward, up and along Mount Park Road and the surrounding streets.

It was of this area centred around Mount Park Road that Nikolaus Pevsner remarks as &quot;”epitomising Ealing&#x27;s reputation as &#x27;Queen of the Suburbs&#x27;..”&quot; In a very short time, Ealing had become a modern and fashionable country town, free of the grime, soot and smells of industrialised London, and yet only minutes away from it by modern transport. The Borough Surveyor, Charles Jones, first re-used the term in the preface of his book &quot;Ealing from Village to Corporate Town&quot; of 1902, already used for Surbiton and Richmond, stressing his view that it was already recognised as of having such an identity. The fairly ornate, many-roomed houses set in &quot;sylvan beauty and floriculture&quot; (civic trees and gardens) stood out to Jones. Mount Park Road and side roads keep much of the original character. Some neighbourhoods have resisted conversions into bed-sits, unlike many of the other original London suburbs.

In the 1900s and 1910s, the Brentham Garden Suburb was built. During the interwar period several garden estates, said to be one of the best examples of classic suburbia in mock Tudor style, were built near Hanger Lane. Hanger Hill Garden Village adjoining is likewise a conservation area. In the 1930s Ealing Village&#x27;s mid-rise, green-setting apartment blocks were built, today Grade II (initial, mainstream) category-listed and having gated grounds.
With the amalgamation of the surrounding municipal boroughs in 1965, Ealing Town Hall became the administrative centre for the new London Borough of Ealing. Today, this also includes its offices at Perceval House just next to it. Later in 1984, the Ealing Broadway Centre was completed which includes a shopping centre and a town square.


==Geography==
Ealing is in the heart of west London. A relatively narrow section of the A406 North Circular Road, London bisects the east of it. The nascent M4 motorway also runs almost adjacent to the south.

It is less than two miles from the Tideway (London&#x27;s upper estuary of the Thames) at the local apex of Kew Bridge that links to the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. Ealing has parks and open spaces, such as Ealing Common, Walpole, Lammas, Cleveland, Hanger Hill, Montpelier, and Pitshanger Parks. The River Brent flows through the latter.
==Demographics==

The largest ethnic group in the 2011 census for the Ealing Broadway ward was White British, at 45%. The second largest was Other White, at 21%. The most spoken foreign language was Polish, followed by French and Japanese. The nearby Hanger Hill ward has the city&#x27;s largest Japanese community.

==Transport==
Ealing is served by Ealing Broadway station on the Great Western Main Line and the London Underground in London fare zone 3. It is also served by five other tube stations at North Ealing, South Ealing, Hanger Lane, Northfields, Park Royal and Ealing Common. The Piccadilly line operates at Park Royal, North Ealing, Ealing Common, South Ealing and Northfields; the Central line at Ealing Broadway and Hanger Lane; and the District line at Ealing Broadway and Ealing Common. The stations at Ealing Broadway and West Ealing are served by National Rail operators Great Western Railway and TfL Rail.

Early in the 21st century Transport for London (TFL) planned to reintroduce an electric tram line along the Uxbridge Road (the West London Tram scheme), but this was abandoned in August 2007 in the face of fierce local opposition. Ealing Broadway and West Ealing stations became part of the Elizabeth line in 2022. A total of 18 buses (including night buses) serve Ealing Broadway.

==Economy and culture==

Ealing has a developed night-time economy backed by numerous pubs and restaurants on The Mall, The Broadway and New Broadway (forming part of the greater Uxbridge Road).

==Studios==
Ealing is best known for its film studios at Ealing Green, which are the oldest in the world and are known especially for the Ealing comedies, including &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot;, &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot;, &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; and &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot;. The studios were taken over by the BBC in 1955, with one consequence being that Ealing locations appeared in television programmes including &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (notably within an iconic 1970 sequence in which deadly shop mannequins menaced local residents) to &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;. Most recently, these studios have again been used for making films, including &quot;Notting Hill&quot; and &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;. &quot;St Trinian&#x27;s&quot;, a remake of the classic film, was produced by Ealing Studios; some locations in Ealing can be seen in this film.

Most recently, Ealing Studios was the set for the famous Downton Abbey historical television series, of which the below stairs and servant&#x27;s hall were filmed there. On 16 March 2015, the workplace received a visit from the Duchess of Cambridge to observe current productions, as well as meet the cast and crew of the series stated.

For 14 years, Ealing lacked any cinema houses, after the closure of the Ealing Empire in 2008. 2022 saw the opening of the Ealing Project, a multi-functional community space centred around a cinema.
Renovation began on the New Broadway street cinema in late 2012. Work is underway as of Spring 2021 for &#x27;Filmworks&#x27;, an Art Deco apartment-and-cinema block featuring a Picturehouse cinema. Local group Pitshanger Pictures shows classic movies in St Barnabas Millennium Hall on Pitshanger Lane.

Ealing has a theatre on Mattock Lane, The Questors Theatre.

==Religion==

Regarded by many as Ealing&#x27;s premier architectural work, St Peter&#x27;s Church, Ealing is on Mount Park Road north of central Ealing. The ancient parish church of Ealing is St Mary&#x27;s, in St Mary&#x27;s Road. Standing near Charlbury Grove, Ealing Abbey was founded by a community of Roman Catholic Benedictine monks in 1897. Twinned with the convent of St. Augustine&#x27;s Priory, the large abbey is an example of a traditional, working monastery. There are over fifteen churches in the suburb of Ealing, including Our Lady Mother of the Church, a Polish Roman Catholic church in the Mall, near Ealing Broadway. There are two well-established synagogues, the Ealing United Synagogue (Orthodox), which celebrated its centenary in November 2019, and the Ealing Liberal Synagogue, which was founded in 1943. In surrounding suburbs, there are two mosques in Acton, one in West Ealing, and two in Southall. 

==Music==
Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones famously first met Brian Jones in 1962 at the Ealing Jazz Club, opposite Ealing Broadway station. Other artists who performed at the club include Rod Stewart and Manfred Mann. The Jazz Club is now a nightclub called the &quot;Red Room&quot;.

The Beatles alighted at West Ealing station (the old building) in March 1964 to complete the filming of ‘A Hard Day’s Night’ at Edgehill Road in West Ealing.

Dusty Springfield lived at 2 Kent Gardens, West Ealing as a teenager and attended St. Anne&#x27;s Convent school in Little Ealing Lane.

Brand New Heavies core members (drummer Jan Kincaid, guitarist Simon Bartholomew and bassist Andrew Levy) all hail from Ealing, where they formed the group in 1985.

An August 2013 article in the &quot;Huffington Post&quot; claimed that Ealing could claim to be the home of rock music because of the catalyst effect of the Ealing Club on British musicians.

Two members of the punk band Zatopeks grew up in Ealing, and the group frequently makes nostalgic or ironic references to the borough in its lyrics.

Mitch Mitchell of the Jimi Hendrix Experience was born there in 1947.

White Lies are also from Ealing.

==Sport==
Ealing is home to Ealing Trailfinders Rugby Club. Due to the nearby football teams, Brentford Football Club and Queens Park Rangers, it long lacked its own. Since late 2008, Ealing Town Football Club has been registered with the Football Association and competes. Other football clubs such Old Actonians youth FC, Pitshanger youth FC and Non-League football club Hanwell Town F.C. play in local leagues.

Gaelic Games have a prominent role in the Irish community in Ealing with successful clubs such as St. Joseph&#x27;s GAA and Tir Chonaill GAA in neighbouring Perivale and Greenford.

Ealing has a local running club: Ealing, Southall &amp; Middlesex AC, founded in 1920. It counted double Olympic champion Kelly Holmes among its several club records to her name. members.

ESC D3 Triathlon Club is also based in Ealing. D3 Triathletes compete in triathlons both locally and internationally across all distances and formats including Olympic Distance and Ironman. Though an independent club it is supported by the Ealing Swimming Club based at Gurnell Leisure Centre.

===Cricket===
Ealing Cricket Club was founded in 1870 and their main ground is on Corfton Road. Ealing CC has a significant success record, with 11 Middlesex County Cricket League championship titles to their name. Ealing field six senior teams that compete in the Middlesex County Cricket League (a designated ECB Premier League) and a Woman&#x27;s team in the Middlesex Cricket Women&#x27;s League. They also have an established junior training section that play competitive cricket in the Middlesex Junior Cricket Association.

==Festivals==
Ealing is the host to several annual festivals. The first festival to be regularly staged was the Jazz Festival which is held in Walpole Park. An annual Beer Festival was then started and organised by the Campaign for Real Ale and originally held in the Ealing Town Hall. Due to its popularity, it had outgrown the space available at the Town Hall after a few years, so it too then transferred to the park, where they now have room to offer over 200 real ales. Each cask is supplied with individual cooling jackets to maintain the beer at exactly the right temperature. This event is run by keen volunteers. The success of these events encouraged the local council to licence a broader range of festivals.

<text>The Passion (from Latin , &quot;to suffer, bear, endure&quot;) is the short final period before the death of Jesus, described in the four canonical gospels. It is commemorated in Christianity every year during Holy Week.

The &quot;Passion&quot; may include, among other events, Jesus&#x27;s triumphal entry into Jerusalem, his cleansing of the Temple, his anointing, the Last Supper, his agony, his arrest, his trials before the Sanhedrin and before Pilate, his crucifixion and death, and his burial. Those parts of the four canonical Gospels that describe these events are known as the Passion narratives. In some Christian communities, commemoration of the Passion also includes remembrance of the sorrow of Mary, the mother of Jesus, on the Friday of Sorrows.

The word &quot;passion&quot; has taken on a more general application and now may also apply to accounts of the suffering and death of Christian martyrs, sometimes using the Latin form &quot;passio&quot;.

== Narratives according to the four canonical gospels ==
Accounts of the Passion are found in the four canonical gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Three of these, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, known as the Synoptic Gospels, give similar accounts. The Gospel of John account varies significantly.

Scholars do not agree on which events surrounding the death of Jesus should be considered part of the Passion narrative, and which ones merely precede and succeed the actual Passion narrative itself. For example, Puskas and Robbins (2011) commence the Passion after Jesus&#x27;s arrest and before his resurrection, thus only including the trials, crucifixion and death of Jesus. In Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s &quot;Jesus of Nazareth: Holy Week&quot; (2011), the term &quot;Passion&quot; completely coincides with the crucifixion and death of Jesus; it does not include earlier events and specifically excludes the burial and resurrection. Others such as Matson and Richardson (2014) take a broader approach and consider the triumphal entry, the last supper, the trial before Pilate, the crucifixion, the burial, and the resurrection collectively as constituting the so-called &quot;Passion Week&quot;.

=== Comprehensive narrative ===
Taking an inclusive approach, the &quot;Passion&quot; may include:
* Triumphal entry into Jerusalem: some people welcome Jesus when he enters Jerusalem.
* The Cleansing of the Temple: Jesus expels livestock merchants and money-changers from the Temple of Jerusalem.
* The Anointing of Jesus by a woman during a meal a few days before Passover. Jesus says that for this she will always be remembered.
* The Last Supper shared by Jesus and his disciples in Jerusalem. Jesus gives final instructions, predicts his betrayal, and tells them all to remember him.
* Jesus predicts the Denial of Peter: on the path to Gethsemane after the meal, Jesus tells the disciples they will all fall away that night. After Peter protests he will not, Jesus says Peter will deny him thrice before the cock crows.
* The Agony in the Garden: later that night at Gethsemane, Jesus prays while the disciples rest. Luke 22:43–44 adds that Jesus was terrified, and sweating blood; however, the oldest manuscripts of the Gospel of Luke do not contain these two verses, the other three canonical gospels do not mention this event either, and various manuscripts contain these verses elsewhere, even in the Gospel of Matthew (suggesting repeated attempts at insertion); thus, most modern scholars consider this tradition a later Christian interpolation, probably to counter docetism.
* The Arrest of Jesus: then Judas Iscariot leads in either &quot;a detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and Pharisees&quot; (accompanied according to Luke&#x27;s Gospel by the chief priests and elders), or a &quot;large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and elders of the people,&quot; which arrests Jesus; all his disciples run away. During the arrest in Gethsemane, someone (Peter according to John) takes a sword and cuts off the ear of the high priest&#x27;s servant, Malchus.
* The Sanhedrin trial of Jesus at the high priest&#x27;s palace, later that night. The arresting party brings Jesus to the Sanhedrin (Jewish supreme court); according to Luke&#x27;s Gospel, Jesus is beaten by his Jewish guards prior to his examination; the court examines him, in the course of which, according to John&#x27;s Gospel, Jesus is struck in the face by one of the Jewish officials; the court determine he deserves to die. According to Matthew&#x27;s Gospel, the court then &quot;spat in his face and struck him with their fists.&quot; They then send him to Pontius Pilate. According to the synoptic gospels, the high priest who examines Jesus is Caiaphas; in John, Jesus is also interrogated by Annas, Caiaphas&#x27; father-in-law.
* The Denial of Peter in the courtyard outside the high priest&#x27;s palace, the same time. Peter has followed Jesus and joined the mob awaiting Jesus&#x27; fate; they suspect he is a sympathizer, so Peter repeatedly denies he knows Jesus. Suddenly, the cock crows and Peter remembers what Jesus had said.
* Pilate&#x27;s trial of Jesus, early morning. Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea, questions Jesus, but cannot find any fault with him (according to some gospels, Pilate explicitly declares Jesus&#x27;s innocence); however, the Jewish leaders and the crowd demand Jesus&#x27; death; Pilate gives them the choice of saving Barabbas, a criminal, or saving Jesus. In response to the screaming mob Pilate sends Jesus out to be crucified.
* The Way of the Cross: Jesus and two other convicts are forced to walk to their place of execution. According to the Synoptics, Simon of Cyrene is forced to carry Jesus&#x27;s cross, while John writes that Jesus carried his cross himself.
* The Crucifixion of Jesus: Jesus and the two other convicts are nailed to crosses at Golgotha, a hill outside Jerusalem, later morning through mid afternoon. Various sayings of Jesus on the cross are recorded in the gospels before he dies.
* The Burial of Jesus: the body of Jesus is taken down from the cross and put in a tomb by Joseph of Arimathea (and Nicodemus according to John).
* The Resurrection of Jesus: Jesus rises from the dead, leaving behind an empty tomb and reportedly appearing to several of his followers.

=== Differences between the canonical gospels ===
The Gospel of Luke states that Pilate sends Jesus to be judged by Herod Antipas because as a Galilean he is under his jurisdiction. Herod is excited at first to see Jesus and hopes Jesus will perform a miracle for him; he asks Jesus several questions but Jesus does not answer. Herod then mocks him and sends him back to Pilate after giving him an &quot;elegant&quot; robe to wear.

All the Gospels relate that a man named Barabbas was released by Pilate instead of Jesus. Matthew, Mark and John have Pilate offer a choice between Jesus and Barabbas to the crowd; Luke lists no choice offered by Pilate, but represents the crowd demanding his release.

In all the Gospels, Pilate asks Jesus if he is King of the Jews and Jesus replies &quot;So you say&quot;. Once condemned by Pilate, he was flogged before execution. The canonical gospels, except Luke, record that Jesus is then taken by the soldiers to the Praetorium where, according to Matthew and Mark, the whole contingent of soldiers has been called together. They place a purple robe on him, put a crown of thorns on his head, and according to Matthew, put a rod in his hand. They mock him by hailing him as &quot;King of the Jews&quot;, paying homage and hitting him on the head with the rod.

According to the Gospel of John, Pilate has Jesus brought out a second time, wearing the purple robe and the crown of thorns, in order to appeal his innocence before the crowd, saying &quot;Ecce homo,&quot; (&quot;Behold the man&quot;). But, John represents, the priests urge the crowd to demand Jesus&#x27;s death. Pilate resigns himself to the decision, washing his hands (according to Matthew) before the people as a sign that Jesus&#x27;s blood will not be upon him. According to the Gospel of Matthew they replied, &quot;His blood be on us and on our children!&quot;

Mark and Matthew record that Jesus is returned his own clothes, prior to being led out for execution. According to the Gospel accounts he is forced, like other victims of crucifixion, to drag his own cross to Golgotha, the location of the execution. The three Synoptic Gospels refer to a man called Simon of Cyrene, who is made to carry the cross (, , ), while in the Gospel of John (), Jesus is made to carry his own cross. The Gospel of Mark gives the names of Simon&#x27;s children, Alexander and Rufus. However, the Gospel of Luke refers to Simon carrying the cross &quot;after&quot; Jesus, in that it states: &quot;they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus&quot;. Luke adds that Jesus&#x27;s female followers follow, mourning his fate, but that he responds by quoting Hosea 10:8.

The Synoptic Gospels state that on arrival at Golgotha, Jesus is offered wine laced with myrrh to lessen the pain, but he refuses it. Jesus is then crucified, according to Mark, at &quot;the third hour&quot; (9 a.m.) the morning after the Passover meal, but according to John he is handed over to be crucified at &quot;the sixth hour&quot; (noon) the day before the Passover meal, although many resolve this by saying that the Synoptics use Jewish time, and that John uses Roman time. Pilate has a plaque fixed to Jesus&#x27;s cross inscribed, (according to John) in Hebrew, Greek and Latin – &quot;Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudeorum&quot;, meaning &quot;Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews&quot;. Mark has the plaque say simply, &quot;King of the Jews.&quot; The Gospels then state that the soldiers divide Jesus&#x27;s clothes among themselves, except for one garment for which they cast lots. The Gospel of John claims that this fulfills a prophecy from . Some of the crowd who have been following taunt Jesus by saying, &quot;He trusts in God; let God deliver him now!&quot; The statement suggests that Jesus might perform a miracle to release himself from the cross.

According to the Gospels, two thieves are also crucified, one on each side of him. According to Luke, one of the thieves reviles Jesus, while the other declares Jesus innocent and begs that he might be remembered when Jesus comes to his kingdom (see Penitent thief).

John records that Mary, his mother, and two other women stand by the cross as does a disciple, described as the one whom Jesus loved. Jesus commits his mother to this disciple&#x27;s care. According to the synoptics, the sky becomes dark at midday and the darkness lasts for three hours, until the ninth hour when Jesus cries out &quot;Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?&quot; (&quot;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&quot;). The centurion standing guard, who has seen how Jesus has died, declares Jesus innocent (Luke) or the &quot;Son of God&quot; (Matthew, Mark).

John says that, as was the custom, the soldiers come and break the legs of the thieves, so that they will die faster, but that on coming to Jesus they find him already dead. A soldier pierces his side with a spear.

According to the Gospel of Matthew, Judas, the betrayer, is filled with remorse and tries to return the money he was paid for betraying Jesus. When the high priests say that that is his affair, Judas throws the money into the temple, goes off, and hangs himself. However, according to the Book of Acts , Judas was not remorseful, took the money and bought a field from it, whereupon he suddenly fell and died.

== Narrative according to the Gospel of Peter ==

Further claims concerning the Passion are made in some non-canonical early writings. Another passion narrative is found in the fragmentary &quot;Gospel of Peter&quot;, long known to scholars through references, and of which a fragment was discovered in Cairo in 1884.

The narrative begins with Pilate washing his hands, as in Matthew, but the Jews and Herod refuse this. Joseph of Arimathea, before Jesus has been crucified, asks for his body, and Herod says he is going to take it down to comply with the Jewish custom of not leaving a dead body hung on a tree overnight. Herod then turns Jesus over to the people who drag him, give him a purple robe, crown him with thorns, and beat and flog him.

There are also two criminals, crucified on either side of him and, as in Luke, one begs Jesus for forgiveness. The writer says Jesus is silent as they crucify him, &quot;...as if in no pain.&quot; Jesus is labeled the King of Israel on his cross and his clothes are divided and gambled over.

As in the canonical Gospels, darkness covers the land. Jesus is also given vinegar to drink. Peter has &quot;My Power, My Power, why have you forsaken me?&quot; as the last words of Jesus, rather than &quot;My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?&quot; as quoted in Mark. He is then &quot;taken up&quot;, possibly a euphemism for death or maybe an allusion to heaven. Peter then has a resurrection, similar to the other books.

Serapion of Antioch urged the exclusion of the Gospel of Peter from the Church because Docetists were using it to bolster their theological claims, which Serapion rejected. Many modern scholars also reject this conclusion, as the statement about Jesus being silent &quot;as if in no pain&quot; seems to be based on Isaiah&#x27;s description of the suffering servant, &quot;as a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth.&quot; ().

==The trials of Jesus==
The gospels provide differing accounts of the trial of Jesus. Mark describes two separate proceedings, one involving Jewish leaders and one in which the Roman prefect for Judea, Pontius Pilate, plays the key role. Both Matthew and John&#x27;s accounts generally support Mark&#x27;s two-trial version. Luke, alone among the gospels, adds yet a third proceeding: having Pilate send Jesus to Herod Antipas. The non-canonical Gospel of Peter describes a single trial scene involving Jewish, Roman, and Herodian officials.

== Biblical prophecies ==
=== Old Testament prophecy ===
Christians interpret at least three passages of the Old Testament as prophecies about Jesus&#x27; Passion.

The first and most obvious is the one from (either 8th or 6th century BC). This prophetic oracle describes a sinless man who will atone for the sins of his people. By his voluntary suffering, he will save sinners from the just punishment of God. The death of Jesus is said to fulfill this prophecy. For example, &quot;He had no form or comeliness that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that made us whole, and with his stripes we are healed&quot; ().

The second prophecy of Christ&#x27;s Passion is the ancient text which Jesus himself quoted, while he was dying on the cross. From the cross, Jesus cried with a loud voice, &quot;Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?&quot; which means, &quot;My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?&quot; These words of Jesus were a quotation of the ancient . King David, in Psalm 22, foretold the sufferings of the messiah. For example, &quot;I am a worm and no man, the reproach of men and the outcast of the people. All who see me, laugh me to scorn, they draw apart their lips, and wag their heads: &#x27;He trusts in the Lord: let him free him, let him deliver him if he loves him.&#x27; Stand not far from me, for I am troubled; be thou near at hand: for I have no helper. ...Yea, dogs are round about me; a company of evildoers encircle me; they have pierced my hands and feet – I can count all my bones – they stare and gloat over me; they divide my garments among them, and for my raiment they cast lots&quot; (). The words &quot;they have pierced my hands and feet&quot; are disputed, however.

The third main prophecy of the Passion is from the Book of the Wisdom of Solomon. Protestant Christians place it in the Apocrypha, Catholics and Eastern Orthodox among the deuterocanonical books. But it was written about 150 BC, and many have understood these verses (12–20 of chapter 2) as a direct prophecy of Jesus&#x27; Passion. For example, &quot;Let us lie in wait for the just, because he is not for our turn. ...He boasteth that he hath the knowledge of God, and calleth himself the son of God ... and glorieth that he hath God for his father. Let us see then if his words be true. ...For if he be the true son of God, he will defend him, and will deliver him from the hands of his enemies. Let us examine him by outrages and tortures. ...Let us condemn him to a most shameful death. ...These things they thought, and were deceived, for their own malice blinded them&quot; (Wisdom 2:12–20).

In addition to the above, it deserves to be mentioned that at least three other, less elaborate messianic prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus&#x27; crucifixion, namely, the following Old Testament passages:

&quot;Many are the afflictions of the just man; but the Lord delivers him from all of them. He guards all his bones: not even one of them shall be broken&quot; ().

&quot;And they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink&quot; ().

&quot;And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for an only son; and they shall grieve over him, as the manner is to grieve for the death of the firstborn&quot; ().

=== New Testament prophecy ===
The Gospel explains how these old prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus&#x27; crucifixion.

&quot;So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with Jesus; but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water. ...For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, &#x27;Not a bone of him shall be broken.&#x27; And again another scripture says, &#x27;They shall look on him whom they have pierced&#x27;&quot; ().

In the Gospel of Mark, Jesus is described as prophesying his own Passion and his Resurrection three times:
*On the way to Caesarea Philippi, predicting that the &quot;Son of Man&quot; will be killed and rise within three days.
*After the transfiguration of Jesus, again predicting that the &quot;Son of Man&quot; will be killed and rise within three days.
*On the way to Jerusalem, predicting that the &quot;Son of Man&quot; will be delivered to the leading Pharisees and Sadducees, be condemned to death, delivered to the Gentiles, mocked, scourged, killed, and rise within three days.

Christians argue that these are cases of genuine and fulfilled prophecy and many scholars see Semitic features and tradition in .

After the third prophecy, the Gospel of Mark states that the brothers James and John ask Jesus to be his left and right hand men, but Jesus asks if they can drink from the &quot;cup&quot; he must drink from. They say that they can do this. Jesus confirms this, but says that the places at his right and left hand are reserved for others. Many Christian see this as being a reference to the two criminals at Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion, thus relating to the Passion. The &quot;cup&quot; is sometimes interpreted as the symbol of his death, in the light of Jesus&#x27;s prayer at Gethsemane &quot;Let this cup be taken from me!&quot;

==Liturgical use==

Most Christian denominations will read one or more narratives of the Passion during Holy Week, especially on Good Friday. In the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, a large cross depicting the crucified Christ is brought out into the church and each of the faithful come forward to venerate the cross. Rather than having the Gospel read solely by the priest, whole congregations participate in the reading of the Passion Gospel during the Palm Sunday Mass and the Good Friday service. These readings have the Priest read the part of Christ, a narrator read the narrative, other reader(s) reading the other speaking parts, and either the choir or the congregation reading the parts of crowds (i.e.: when the crowd shouts &quot;Crucify Him! Crucify Him!&quot;).

In the Byzantine Rite of the Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic Churches, the Matins service for Good Friday is called &quot;Matins of the Twelve Passion Gospels&quot;, and is notable for the interspersal of twelve readings from the Gospel Book detailing chronologically the events of the Passion – from the Last Supper to the burial in the tomb – during the course of the service. The first of these twelve readings is the longest Gospel reading of the entire liturgical year. In addition, every Wednesday and Friday throughout the year is dedicated in part to the commemoration of the Passion.

During Holy Week/Passion Week Congregations of the Moravian Church (Herrnhuter Bruedergemeine) read the entire story of Jesus&#x27;s final week from a Harmony of the Gospels prepared for that purpose since 1777. Daily meetings are held, some times two or three times a day, to follow the events of the day. During the course of the reading, the Congregation sings hymn verses to respond to the events of the text.

Most liturgical churches hold some form of commemoration of the Crucifixion on the afternoon of Good Friday. Sometimes, this will take the form of a vigil from noon to 3:00 pm, the approximate time that Jesus hung on the cross. Sometimes there will be a reenactment of the Descent from the Cross; for instance, at Vespers in the Byzantine (Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic) tradition.
==Devotions==
Several non-liturgical devotions have been developed by Christian faithful to commemorate the Passion.

===The Stations of the Cross===

The Stations of the Cross are a series of religious reflections describing or depicting Christ carrying the cross to his crucifixion. Most Catholic churches, as well as many Anglican, Lutheran, and Methodist parishes, contain Stations of the Cross, typically placed at intervals along the sidewalls of the nave; in most churches, they are small plaques with reliefs or paintings, although in others they may be simple crosses with a numeral in the center. The tradition of moving around the Stations to commemorate the Passion of Christ began with Francis of Assisi and extended throughout the Catholic Church in the medieval period. It is most commonly done during Lent, especially on Good Friday, but it can be done on other days as well, especially Wednesdays and Fridays.

===The Passion Offices ===
The Passion Offices were the special prayers said by various Catholic communities, particularly the Passionist fathers to commemorate the Passion of Christ.

===The Little Office of the Passion===

Another devotion is the Little Office of the Passion created by Francis of Assisi (1181/82–1226). He ordered this office around the medieval association of five specific moments in Jesus&#x27;s Passion with specific hours of the day. Having then attributed these to hours of the Divine Office, he arrived at this schema:

* Compline – 21:00 – Jesus&#x27;s Arrest on the Mount of Olives
* Matins – 00:00 – Jesus&#x27;s Trial before the Jewish Sanhedrin
* Prime – 06:00 – &quot;an interlude celebrating Christ as the light of the new day&quot;
* Terce – 09:00 – Jesus&#x27;s Trial before Pontius Pilate
* Sext – 12:00 – Jesus&#x27;s Crucifixion
* None – 15:00 – Jesus&#x27;s Death
* Vespers – 18:00 – &quot;recalling and celebrating the entire daily cycle&quot;

===Acts of reparation===
The Catholic tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as &quot;acts of reparation&quot; for the sufferings and insults that Jesus endured during his Passion. These &quot;acts of reparation to Jesus Christ&quot; do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to &quot;repair the sins&quot; against Jesus. Some such prayers are provided in the Raccolta Catholic prayer book (approved by a Decree of 1854, and published by the Holy See in 1898) which also includes prayers as Acts of Reparation to the Virgin Mary.

In his encyclical &quot;Miserentissimus Redemptor&quot; on reparations, Pope Pius XI called acts of reparation to Jesus Christ a duty for Catholics and referred to them as &quot;some sort of compensation to be rendered for the injury&quot; with respect to the sufferings of Jesus.

Pope John Paul II referred to acts of reparation as the &quot;unceasing effort to stand beside the endless crosses on which the Son of God continues to be crucified&quot;.

==In the arts==

===Visual art===

Each episode of the Passion, such as the Flagellation of Christ or Entombment of Christ, has been represented thousands of times and has developed its own iconographic tradition; the Crucifixion is much the most common and important of these subjects. The Passion is often covered by a cycle of depictions; Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s print cycles were so popular that he produced three different versions. Andachtsbilder is a term for devotional subjects such as the Man of Sorrows or Pietà, that may not precisely represent a moment in the Passion but are derived from the Passion story. The &quot;Arma Christi&quot;, or &quot;Instruments of the Passion&quot; are the objects associated with Jesus&#x27;s Passion, such as the cross, the Crown of Thorns and the Spear of Longinus. Each of the major Instruments has been supposedly recovered as relics which have been an object of veneration among many Christians, and have been depicted in art. Veronica&#x27;s Veil is also often counted among the Instruments of the Passion; like the Shroud of Turin and Sudarium of Oviedo it is a cloth relic supposed to have touched Jesus.

In the Catholic Church, the Passion story is depicted in the Stations of the Cross (&quot;via crucis&quot;, also translated more literally as &quot;Way of the Cross&quot;). These 14 stations depict the Passion from the sentencing by Pilate to the sealing of the tomb, or with the addition of a 15th, the resurrection. Since the 16th-century representations of them in various media have decorated the naves of most Catholic churches. The Way of the Cross is a devotion practiced by many people on Fridays throughout the year, most importantly on Good Friday. This may be simply by going round the Stations in a church, or may involve large-scale re-enactments, as in Jerusalem. The Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy are similar schemes on a far larger scale than church Stations, with chapels containing large sculpted groups arranged in a hilly landscape; for pilgrims to tour the chapels typically takes several hours. They mostly date from the late 16th to the 17th century; most depict the Passion, others different subjects as well.

===Music===

The main traditional types of church music sung during Holy Week are Passions, musical settings of the Gospel narratives, both a Catholic and Lutheran tradition, and settings of the readings and responses from the Catholic Tenebrae services, especially those of the &quot;Lamentations of Jeremiah the Prophet&quot;. The many settings of the Stabat Mater or musical settings of sayings of Jesus on the cross are also commonly performed.

The reading of the Passion section of one of the Gospels during Holy Week dates back to the 4th century. It began to be intoned (rather than just spoken) in the Middle Ages, at least as early as the 8th century. Ninth-century manuscripts have &quot;litterae significativae&quot; indicating interpretive chant, and later manuscripts begin to specify exact notes to be sung. By the 13th century, different singers were used for different characters in the narrative, a practice which became fairly universal by the 15th century, when polyphonic settings of the &quot;turba&quot; passages began to appear also. (&quot;Turba&quot;, while literally meaning &quot;crowd&quot;, is used in this case to mean any passage in which more than one person speaks simultaneously.)

In the later 15th century a number of new styles began to emerge:
* Responsorial Passions set all of Christ&#x27;s words and the turba parts polyphonically.
* Through-composed Passions were entirely polyphonic (also called &quot;motet Passions&quot;). Jacob Obrecht wrote the earliest extant example of this type.
*&quot;Summa Passionis&quot; settings were a synopsis of all four Gospels, including the Seven Last Words (a text later set by Haydn and Théodore Dubois). These were discouraged for church use but circulated widely nonetheless.

In the 16th century, settings like these, and further developments, were created for the Catholic Church by Victoria, William Byrd, Jacobus Gallus, Francisco Guerrero, Orlando di Lasso, and Cypriano de Rore.

Martin Luther wrote, &quot;The Passion of Christ should not be acted out in words and pretense, but in real life.&quot; Despite this, sung Passion performances were common in Lutheran churches right from the start, in both Latin and German, beginning as early as Laetare Sunday (three weeks before Easter) and continuing through Holy Week. Luther&#x27;s friend and collaborator Johann Walther wrote responsorial Passions which were used as models by Lutheran composers for centuries, and &quot;&quot;summa Passionis&quot; versions continued to circulate, despite Luther&#x27;s express disapproval.

Later 16th-century passions included choral &quot;exordium&quot; (introduction) and &quot;conclusio&quot;&quot; sections with additional texts. In the 17th century came the development of oratorio passions which led to Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s Passions, accompanied by instruments, with interpolated texts (then called &quot;madrigal&quot; movements) such as sinfonias, other Scripture passages, Latin motets, chorale arias, and more. Such settings were created by Bartholomäus Gesius and Heinrich Schütz. Thomas Strutz wrote a Passion (1664) with arias for Jesus himself, pointing to the standard oratorio tradition of Schütz, Carissimi, and others, although these composers seem to have thought that putting words in Jesus&#x27; mouth was beyond the pale. The practice of using recitative for the Evangelist (rather than plainsong) was a development of court composers in northern Germany and only crept into church compositions at the end of the 17th century. A famous musical reflection on the Passion is Part II of &quot;Messiah&quot;, an oratorio by George Frideric Handel, though the text here draws from Old Testament prophecies rather than from the gospels themselves.

The best known Protestant musical settings of the Passion are by Bach, who wrote several Passions, of which two have survived completely, one based on the Gospel of John (the &quot;St John Passion&quot;), the other on the Gospel of Matthew (the &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;). His &quot;St Mark Passion&quot; was reconstructed in various ways. The Passion continued to be very popular in Protestant Germany in the 18th century, with Bach&#x27;s second son Carl Philipp Emanuel composing over twenty settings. Gottfried August Homilius composed at least one cantata Passion and four oratorio Passions after all four Evangelists. Many of C. P. E. Bachs performances were in fact works by Homilius.

In the 19th century, with the exception of John Stainer&#x27;s &quot;The Crucifixion&quot; (1887), Passion settings were less popular, but in the 20th century they have again come into fashion. Two notable settings are the &quot;St. Luke Passion&quot; (1965) by Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki and the &quot;Passio&quot; (1982) by Estonian composer Arvo Pärt. Recent examples include &quot;The Passion According to St. Matthew&quot; (1997), by Mark Alburger, and &quot;The Passion According to the Four Evangelists&quot;, by Scott King. Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; (book and lyrics by Tim Rice) and Stephen Schwartz&#x27;s &quot;Godspell&quot; both contain elements of the traditional passion accounts.

Choral meditations on aspects of the suffering of Jesus on the cross include arrangements such as Buxtehude&#x27;s &quot;Membra Jesu Nostri&quot;, a 1680 set of seven Passion cantatas, and the first such Lutheran treatment, incorporating lyrics excerpted from a medieval Latin poem and featuring Old Testament verses that prefigure the Messiah as suffering servant.

===Drama and processions===


Non-musical settings of the Passion story are generally called Passion plays; these have been very widely performed in traditionally Catholic countries, often in churches as liturgical dramas – for versions with musical settings, see the previous section. One famous cycle is performed at intervals at Oberammergau Germany, another in Sordevolo one of the most important in Italy, and another in the Brazilian state of Pernambuco uses what is considered the largest open-air theater in the world. The Passion figures among the scenes in the English mystery plays in more than one cycle of dramatic vignettes. In the Chester Mystery Plays&#x27; portrayal of Christ&#x27;s Passion, specifically his humiliation before his sentence to crucifixion, the accounts of the Gospels concerning the physical violence visited on Jesus during his trial before the Sanhedrin, and the humiliating crowning of thorns visited upon him in Pilate&#x27;s palace (or by Herod&#x27;s soldiers, according to Luke), is further confused by showing both actions as being carried out by jeering Jews.

Processions on Palm Sunday commonly re-enact to some degree the entry of Jesus to Jerusalem, traditional ones often using special wooden donkeys on wheels. Holy Week in Spain retains more traditional public processions than other countries, with the most famous, in Seville, featuring floats with carved tableaux showing scenes from the story.

====In Latin America====
During the Passion week many towns in Mexico have a representation of the passion.

====In Spain====
During the Passion week many cities and towns in Spain have a representation of the Passion.

Many Passion poems and prose text circulated in the fifteenth-century Castile, among which there were the first modern translations of earlier Latin Passion texts and &quot;Vitae Christi&quot;, and also a popular &quot;Monotessaron&quot; or &quot;Pasión de l&#x27;eterno principe Jesucristo&quot; attributed to a pseudo-Gerson. It was most likely written by Thomas à Kempis, whose &quot;Imitation of Christ&quot; mentions the Passion a few times, uniquely when talking about the Eucharist.

===Film===
There have also been a number of films telling the passion story, with a prominent example being Mel Gibson&#x27;s 2004 &quot;The Passion of the Christ.&quot;

==Other traditions==

*The sons of Simon of Cyrene are named as if they might have been early Christian figures known to Mark&#x27;s intended audience. Paul also lists a Rufus in Romans 16:13.
*Most garments of the region were made of woven strips of material that were about eight inches wide and included decorative braids from two to four inches (102 mm) wide. The garments could be disassembled and the strips of cloth were frequently recycled. A single garment might hold sections of many different dates. However, in Damascus and Bethlehem cloth was woven on wider looms, some Damascene being wide. Traditional Bethlehem cloth is striped like pajama material. It would thus appear that Jesus&#x27;s &quot;seamless robe&quot; was made of cloth from either Bethlehem or Damascus.
*A tradition linked to icons of Jesus holds that Veronica was a pious woman of Jerusalem who then gave her kerchief to him to wipe his forehead. When he handed it back to her, the image of his face was miraculously impressed upon it.

== Passion of Jesus in botany ==

The tropical plant passiflora, introduced to Europe in the 16th century, got its name from the Jesuit F B Ferrari, who saw in its flower an emblem containing the instruments of the Passion of Christ. The 3 stigmas represent three nails, a circle of radial filaments - a bloody crown of thorns, a stalk fruit grower - the Holy Grail, five anthers - five wounds of the Savior, a three-bladed leaf - holy Lance, the tendrils represent the whips used in the flagellation of Christ, attachments (antennae) - lashes, white - the Savior&#x27;s innocence, etc.

<text>The Brentford Trilogy is a series of twelve novels by writer Robert Rankin. They humorously chronicle the lives of a couple of drunken middle-aged layabouts, Jim Pooley and John Omally, who confront the forces of darkness in the environs of West London, usually with the assistance of large quantities of beer from their favourite public house, The Flying Swan.

==Novels==

The novels in this series are as follows:

# &quot;The Antipope&quot; (1981) – Pooley and Omally take on the resurrected Pope Alexander VI, the last Borgia pope.
# &quot;The Brentford Triangle&quot; (1982) – Pooley and Omally thwart an alien invasion of Earth when the natives of Ceres (the fifth planet in the solar system before it exploded and became the asteroid belt) come back to the system and seek a new home.
# &quot;East of Ealing&quot; (1984) – Pooley and Omally are forced to deal with a high-tech Satanic takeover of Earth by way of barcoding the entire population, aided by a temporally-relocated version of Sherlock Holmes.
# &quot;The Sprouts of Wrath&quot; (1988) – the unlikely decision to site the next Olympic Games in Brentford threatens to disrupt Pooley and Omally&#x27;s way of life, as the evil Kaleton threatens to turn the stadium into a monster to destroy humanity.
# &quot;The Brentford Chainstore Massacre&quot; (1997) – as the millennium comes early for Brentford, Dr. Steven Malone finds a way to clone Jesus from the Turin Shroud, as chief executive of the millennium committee called Fred (who sold his soul to the devil for ultimate power) attempts to force Pooley into sabotaging a ceremony that will give his Master power over all the world.
#&quot;Sex and Drugs and Sausage Rolls&quot; (2000) – Omally manages a rock group, the lead singer of whom has the power to heal the sick. This book also sees the return of Soap Distant and Small Dave. In this book, Pooley suffers a brutal, but not long-term death.
#&quot;Knees Up Mother Earth&quot; (2004) – there&#x27;s big trouble in little Brentford. Property developers are planning to destroy Griffin Park, the borough&#x27;s beloved football ground, intending to dig up the creature buried underneath it – namely, the serpent that tempted Eve in the Garden of Eden; the source of original sin. As well as being the seventh book in The Brentford Trilogy, it is also the second book in The Witches of Chiswick Trilogy.
#&quot;The Brightonomicon&quot; (2005) – Hugo Rune and his amnesiac assistant Rizla work to stop Count Otto Black from finding the Chronovision. Unlike the other novels in the series, it is set in Brighton and Omally only makes an appearance in the final chapter. It is revealed that Rizla on this occasion (Rune&#x27;s many acolytes are always called Rizla), is actually Pooley.
#&quot;Retromancer&quot; (2009) – the sequel to &quot;The Brightonomicon&quot; again pairs the young Jim Pooley with Hugo Rune in another series of adventures only set partially in Brentford. This book also forms a prequel to &quot;The Antipope&quot;. Set in a dystopia, history has been changed: Germany won World War II, America is a nuclear wasteland, and Jim Pooley and Hugo Rune must set it right.
#&quot;The Lord of the Ring Roads&quot; (2017) – the first of the last Brentford Trilogy.
#&quot;The Chronicles of Banarnia&quot; (2019) – second part of the final Brentford trilogy.
#&quot;Normanghast&quot; (2023) – The third book in the final Brentford Trilogy.

Several of Rankin&#x27;s other novels feature Pooley and Omally, but are not part of The Brentford Trilogy:
*&quot;They Came And Ate Us (Armageddon II: The B-Movie)&quot; (1991) – Pooley and Omally make a brief appearance as one of a number of &quot;trick endings&quot;. 
*&quot;The Most Amazing Man Who Ever Lived&quot; (1995) – Pooley and Omally make a brief appearance, offering their help to Tuppe as he plans to free the book&#x27;s lead character, Cornelius Murphy, from prison. Before they can put their plan into action Cornelius reveals he has already escaped without their help.
*&quot;Nostradamus Ate My Hamster&quot; (1996) – a movie prop-house worker finds a way to put old stars back on the silver screen. Over the course of the book, he learns of the legends of Pooley and Omally and sets out in search of &quot;The Flying Swan&quot;, culminating in a desperate race to stop the return of Adolf Hitler.
*&quot;Web Site Story&quot; (2002) – set in the year 2022, Pooley and Omally have long since passed into the myths and legends of Brentford lore. As people start vanishing into thin air in Brentford, the staff of the &quot;Brentford Mercury&quot; investigate.

Although the books theoretically form a series, actually there is little continuity between volumes. World-changing events that take place in one book are usually ignored in following volumes, and it is very rare for the events of a previous book to be referred to.
For example, the character of shopkeeper Norman Hartnell (not to be confused with the fashion designer of the same name) is abandoned by his wife yet is inexplicably reunited with her in later books. Soap Distant also appears in later books as a Brentford resident despite being declared dead, becoming an albino and dwelling beneath the earth.

==Recurring characters==
*John Vincent Omally and Jim Pooley – an Irishman living in Brentford and his best friend. The &#x27;heroes&#x27; of the series.
*Neville – the part-time barman (who is actually full-time since nobody knows where the real one is) who holds down the Flying Swan in Brentford.
*Norman Hartnell – Brentford shopkeeper and inventor of various bizarre gadgets, including a means of transporting the Great Pyramid from Egypt to Brentford. Not to be confused with the other Norman Hartnell.
*Old Pete and Chips – Old Pete (Age unconfirmed, although he seems to be over a hundred) always appears in the Flying Swan, and Chips is his scraggly dog. He appears as a Victorian street urchin in &quot;The Witches of Chiswick&quot; but is known by the name &#x27;Winston&#x27;. In &quot;Knees Up Mother Earth&quot; he accompanied H. G. Wells to the 20th century where his older self tells him to buy shares in the Ford Motor Company.
*Professor Slocombe – aged, wise magician who often supplies much of the exposition about the various enemies present in the series (He was apparently Merlin in the distant past). Is once described as bearing a resemblance to Peter Cushing. Has a butler named Gammon.
*Marchant – John Omally&#x27;s bicycle, whose anthropomorphic qualities may be a reference to Flann O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s novel &quot;The Third Policeman&quot;.
*Soap Distant – Last of a long line of Distants who have spent their lives searching for the denizens of the inner Earth. Soap is an ordinary man when first seen but returns as a cowled and robed albino after five years &#x27;below&#x27;. 
*Small Dave – Brentford&#x27;s dwarf postman, known to all as a &#x27;vindictive, grudge-bearing wee bastard&#x27;. Raised the ghost of Edgar Allan Poe.
*Hugo Artemis Solon Saturnicus Reginald Arthur Rune – mystic, charlatan and confidence trickster and self declared &#x27;most amazing man who ever lived&#x27; (was also apparently Merlin in a previous time, See &quot;Retromancer&quot;). Has an acolyte named Rizla.
*Hairy Dave and Jungle John – these two brothers are local jobbing builders who are known for their wild coiffure.
*Archroy – former worker at the rubber factory who became a globe trotting master of the martial arts.
*Jennifer Naylor – Brentford&#x27;s sexy lady librarian, later elevated to the town council.
*Young Master Robert – the brewery owner&#x27;s son and the bane of Neville&#x27;s existence.
*Leo Felix – Rastafarian who drives a tow truck.
