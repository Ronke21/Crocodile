<text>The Duchy of Prussia (, , ) or Ducal Prussia (; ) was a duchy in the region of Prussia established as a result of secularization of the Monastic Prussia, the territory that remained under the control of the State of the Teutonic Order until the Protestant Reformation in 1525.

== Overview ==
The duchy became the first Protestant state when Albert, Duke of Prussia formally adopted Lutheranism in 1525. It was inhabited by a German, Polish (mainly in Masuria), and Lithuanian-speaking (mainly in Lithuania Minor) population.

In 1525, during the Protestant Reformation, in accordance to the Treaty of Kraków, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, Albert, secularized the order&#x27;s prevailing Prussian territory (the Monastic Prussia), becoming Albert, Duke of Prussia. As the region had been a part of the Kingdom of Poland since the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), King of Poland Sigismund I the Old, as its suzerain, granted the territory as a hereditary fief of Poland to Duke Albert per the Treaty of Kraków, a decision that was sealed by the Prussian Homage in Kraków in April 1525. The new duke established Lutheranism as the first Protestant state church. The capital remained in Königsberg (modern Kaliningrad).

The duchy was inherited by the Hohenzollern prince-electors of Brandenburg in 1618. This personal union is referred to as Brandenburg-Prussia. Frederick William, the &quot;Great Elector&quot; of Brandenburg, achieved full sovereignty over the duchy under the 1657 Treaty of Wehlau, confirmed in the 1660 Treaty of Oliva. In the following years, attempts were made to return to Polish suzerainty, especially by the capital city of Königsberg, whose burghers rejected the treaties and viewed the region as part of Poland. The Duchy of Prussia was elevated to a kingdom in 1701.

==History==
===Background===
As Protestantism spread among the laity of the Teutonic Monastic State of Prussia, dissent began to develop against the Roman Catholic rule of the Teutonic Knights, whose Grand Master, Albert, Duke of Prussia, a member of a cadet branch of the House of Hohenzollern, lacked the military resources to assert the order&#x27;s authority.

After losing a war against the Kingdom of Poland, and with his personal bishop, Georg von Polenz of Pomesania and of Samland, who had converted to Lutheranism in 1523, and a number of his commanders already supporting Protestant ideas, Albert began to consider a radical solution.

At Wittenberg in 1522, and at Nuremberg in 1524, Martin Luther encouraged him to convert the order&#x27;s territory into a secular principality under his personal rule, as the Teutonic Knights would not be able to survive the reformation.

===Establishment===
On 10 April 1525, Albert resigned his position, became a Protestant and in the Prussian Homage was granted the title &quot;Duke of Prussia&quot; by his uncle, King Sigismund I of Poland. In a deal partly brokered by Luther, Ducal Prussia became the first Protestant state, anticipating the dispensations of the Peace of Augsburg of 1555.
When Albert returned to Königsberg, he publicly declared his conversion and announced to a quorum of Teutonic Knights his new ducal status. The knights who disapproved of the decision were pressured into acceptance by Albert&#x27;s supporters and the burghers of Königsberg, and only Eric of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, Komtur of Memel, opposed the new duke. On 10 December 1525, at their session in Königsberg, the Prussian estates established the Lutheran Church in Ducal Prussia by deciding the Church Order.

By the end of Albert&#x27;s rule, the offices of Grand Commander and Marshal of the Order had deliberately been left vacant, and the order was left with but 55 knights in Prussia. Some of the knights converted to Lutheranism in order to retain their property and then married into the Prussian nobility, while others returned to the Holy Roman Empire, and remained Catholic. These remaining Teutonic Knights, led by the next Grand Master, Walter von Cronberg, continued to unsuccessfully claim Prussia, but retained much of the estates in the Teutonic bailiwicks outside of Prussia.

On 1 March 1526, Albert married Princess Dorothea, daughter of King Frederick I of Denmark, thereby establishing political ties between Lutheranism and Scandinavia. Albert was greatly aided by his elder brother George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, who had earlier established the Protestant religion in his territories of Franconia and Upper Silesia. Albert also found himself reliant on support from his uncle Sigismund I of Poland, as the Holy Roman Empire, and the Roman Catholic Church, had banned him for his Protestantism.

The Teutonic Order had only superficially carried out its mission to Christianize the native rural population and erected few churches within the state&#x27;s territory. There was little longing for Roman Catholicism. Baltic Old Prussians and Prussian Lithuanian peasants continued to practice pagan customs in some areas, for example, adhering to beliefs in Perkūnas (Perkunos), symbolized by the goat buck, Potrimpo, and Pikullos (Patollu) while &quot;consuming the roasted flesh of a goat&quot;. Bishop George of Polentz had forbidden the widespread forms of pagan worship in 1524 and repeated the ban in 1540.

On 18 January 1524 Bishop George had ordered the use of native languages at baptisms, which improved the acceptance of baptism by the peasants. There was little active resistance to the new Protestant religion. The Teutonic Knights having brought Catholicism made the transition to Protestantism easier.

The Church Order of 1525 provided for visitations of the parishioners and pastors, which were first carried out by Bishop George in 1538. Because Ducal Prussia was ostensibly a Lutheran land, authorities traveled throughout the duchy ensuring that Lutheran teachings were being followed and imposing penalties on pagans and dissidents. The rural population of native descent was thoroughly Christianised only starting with the Reformation in Prussia.

A peasant rebellion broke out in Sambia in 1525. The combination of taxation by the nobility, the contentions of the Protestant Reformation, and the abrupt secularization of the Teutonic Order&#x27;s remaining Prussian lands exacerbated peasant unrest. The relatively well-to-do rebel leaders, including a miller from Kaimen and an innkeeper from Schaaken in Prussia, were supported by sympathizers in Königsberg. The rebels demanded the elimination of newer taxes by the nobility, and a return to an older tax of two marks per hide (a measure of land of approximately forty acres).

They claimed to be rebelling against the harsh nobility, not against Duke Albert, who was away in the Holy Roman Empire and said that they would swear allegiance to him only in person. Upon Albert&#x27;s return from the Empire, he called for a meeting of the peasants in a field, whereupon he surrounded them with loyal troops and had them arrested without incident. The leaders of the rebellion were subsequently executed. There were no more large-scale rebellions. Ducal Prussia became known as a land of Protestantism and sectarianism.
In 1544, Duke Albert founded the Albertina University in Königsberg, which became the principal educational establishment for Lutheran pastors and theologians of Prussia. In 1560, the university received a royal privilege from King Sigismund II Augustus of Poland. It was granted the same rights and autonomy that were enjoyed by the Kraków University and so it became one of the leading universities in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The use of the native languages in church services made Duke Albert appoint exiled Protestant Lithuanian pastors as professors, e.g. Stanislovas Rapolionis and Abraomas Kulvietis, making the Albertina also a centre of Lithuanian language and literature.

While the composition of the nobility changed little in the transition from the monastic state to the duchy, the control of the nobility over the dependent peasantry increased. Prussia&#x27;s free peasants, called Kölmer, were holders of free estates according to Culm law. Kölmer held them with about a sixth of the arable land, much more than in other nations in the feudal era.

Administratively, little changed in the transition from the Teutonic Knights to ducal rule. Although he was formally a vassal of the crown of Poland, Albert retained self-government for Prussia, his own army, the minting of his currency, a provincial assembly, (de, &quot;Landtag&quot;), and substantial autonomy in foreign affairs.

===Lack of heirs===
When Albert died in 1568, his teenage son (the exact age is unknown) Albert Frederick inherited the duchy. Sigismund II was also Albert Frederick&#x27;s cousin. The Elector of Brandenburg Joachim II, converted to Lutheranism in 1539. Joachim wanted to merge his lands with the Prussian dukedom so that his heirs would inherit both. Joachim petitioned his brother-in-law, king Sigismund II of Poland the co-enfeoffment of his line of the Hohenzollern with the Prussian dukedom, and finally succeeded, including the then usual expenses.

On 19 July 1569, when, in Lublin, Poland, duke Albert Frederick rendered King Sigismund II homage and was in return installed as Duke of Prussia in Lublin, the King simultaneously enfeoffed Joachim II and his descendants as co-heirs.

Administration in the duchy declined as Albert Frederick became increasingly feeble-minded, which led Margrave George Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach to become Regent of Prussia in 1577.

Following King Sigismund III&#x27;s Prussian regency agreement (1605) with Joachim Frederick of Brandenburg and his Treaty of Warsaw, 1611, with John Sigismund of Brandenburg, confirming the Brandenburgian co-inheritance of Prussia, both regents guaranteed the free practice of Catholic religion in predominantly-Lutheran Prussia. Based on the agreements, some Lutheran churches were reconsecrated as Catholic places of worship (e.g. St. Nicholas Church, Elbląg in 1612).

===Personal union with Brandenburg===

In 1618, the Prussian Hohenzollern became extinct in the male line, and so the Polish fief of Prussia was passed on to the senior Brandenburg Hohenzollern line, the ruling margraves and prince-electors of Brandenburg, who thereafter ruled Brandenburg (a fief of the Holy Roman Empire), and Ducal Prussia (a Polish fief), in personal union. The legal contradiction made a cross-border real union impossible; however, in practice, Brandenburg and Ducal Prussia were more and more ruled as one and were colloquially referred to as &quot;Brandenburg-Prussia&quot;.

In 1618, the Thirty Years&#x27; War broke out, and John Sigismund himself died the following year. His son, George William, was successfully invested with the duchy in 1623 by King of Poland Sigismund III Vasa, thus the personal union Brandenburg-Prussia was confirmed. Many of the Prussian Junkers were opposed to rule by the House of Hohenzollern of Berlin and appealed to Sigismund III Vasa for redress, or even incorporation of Ducal Prussia into the Polish kingdom, but without success.

During the Polish–Swedish wars, the duchy became administered in 1635 by the Polish statesman Jerzy Ossoliński, who was appointed by Polish King Władysław IV Vasa.

Frederick William the &quot;Great Elector&quot;, duke of Prussia and prince-elector of Brandenburg, wished to acquire Royal Prussia in order to territorially connect his two fiefs. Yet, during the Second Northern War, Charles X Gustav of Sweden invaded Ducal Prussia and dictated the Treaty of Königsberg (January 1656), which made the duchy a Swedish fief. In the Treaty of Marienburg (June 1656), Charles X Gustav promised to cede to Frederick William the Polish voivodships of Chełmno, Malbork, Pomerania, and the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia if Frederick William would support Charles Gustav&#x27;s effort. The proposition was somewhat risky since Frederick William would definitely have to provide military support, and the reward could be provided only on victory. When the tide of the war turned against Charles X Gustav, he concluded the Treaty of Labiau (November 1656), making Frederick William I the full sovereign in Ducal Prussia and Warmia, which, however, was part of Poland.

===Emancipation===
In response to the Swedish-Prussian alliance, King John II Casimir Vasa submitted a counteroffer, which Frederick William accepted. They signed the Treaty of Wehlau on 19 September 1657 and the Treaty of Bromberg on 6 November 1657. In return for Frederick William&#x27;s renunciation of the Swedish-Prussian alliance, John Casimir recognised Frederick William&#x27;s full sovereignty over the Duchy of Prussia. After almost 200 years of Polish suzerainty over the Teutonic monastic state of Prussia and its successor Ducal Prussia, the territory passed under the full sovereignty of Brandenburg. Therefore, &quot;Duchy of Prussia&quot; then became the more adequate appellation for the state. Full sovereignty was a necessary prerequisite to upgrade Ducal Prussia to the sovereign Kingdom of Prussia in 1701 when Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg can become &quot;king in Prussia&quot; in 1701 without approvement of Emperor Leopold I.
However, the end of Polish suzerainty was met with resistance of the population, regardless of ethnicity, as it was afraid of Brandenburg absolutism and wished to remain part of the Polish Crown. The burghers of the capital city of Königsberg, led by Hieronymus Roth, rejected the treaties of Wehlau and Oliva and viewed Prussia as &quot;indisputably contained within the territory of the Polish Crown&quot;. It was noted that the incorporation into the Polish Crown under the Treaty of Kraków was approved by the city of Königsberg, while the separation from Poland took place without the city&#x27;s consent. Polish King John II Casimir was asked for help, and masses were held in Protestant churches for the king and the Polish Kingdom. But in 1662, Elector Frederick William entered the city with his troops and forced the city to swear allegiance to him.

However, in the following decades, at least one attempt to return of Polish suzerainty was made. In 1675, the Polish-French Treaty of Jaworów was signed according to which France was to support Polish efforts to regain control of the region, and Poland was to join the ongoing Franco-Brandenburgian War on the French side, however, it was not implemented.

The nature of the &quot;de facto&quot; collectively ruled governance of Brandenburg-Prussia became more apparent through the titles of the higher ranks of the Prussian government, seated in Brandenburg&#x27;s capital of Berlin after the return of the court from Königsberg, where they had sought refuge from the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

===Later development===
After the Kingdom of Prussia&#x27;s annexation of the bulk of the province of Royal Prussia in the First Partition of Poland in 1772, former Ducal Prussia, including previously Polish-controlled Warmia within Royal Prussia, was reorganized into the Province of East Prussia, while Pomerelia and the Malbork Land became the Province of West Prussia, with the exceptions of the two principal cities of Gdańsk and Toruń, annexed into West Prussia only in 1793 after the Second Partition of Poland.

The Kingdom of Prussia, then consisting of East and West Prussia, being a sovereign state, and Brandenburg, being a fief within the Holy Roman Empire, were amalgamated &quot;de jure&quot; only after the latter&#x27;s dissolution in 1806, though later became again partially distinct during the existence of the German Confederation (1815-1866).

<text>The philosopher&#x27;s stone is a mythic alchemical substance capable of turning base metals such as mercury into gold or silver; it was also known as &quot;the tincture&quot; and &quot;the powder&quot;. Alchemists additionally believed that it could be used to make an elixir of life which made possible rejuvenation and immortality.

For many centuries, it was the most sought-after goal in alchemy. The philosopher&#x27;s stone was the central symbol of the mystical terminology of alchemy, symbolizing perfection at its finest, divine illumination, and heavenly bliss. Efforts to discover the philosopher&#x27;s stone were known as the Magnum Opus (&quot;Great Work&quot;).

==Antiquity==
The earliest known written mention of the philosopher&#x27;s stone is in the &quot;Cheirokmeta&quot; by Zosimos of Panopolis (). Alchemical writers assign a longer history. Elias Ashmole and the anonymous author of &quot;Gloria Mundi&quot; (1620) claim that its history goes back to Adam, who acquired the knowledge of the stone directly from God. This knowledge was said to have been passed down through biblical patriarchs, giving them their longevity. The legend of the stone was also compared to the biblical history of the Temple of Solomon and the rejected cornerstone described in Psalm 118.

The theoretical roots outlining the stone&#x27;s creation can be traced to Greek philosophy. Alchemists later used the classical elements, the concept of &quot;anima mundi&quot;, and Creation stories presented in texts like Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot; as analogies for their process. According to Plato, the four elements are derived from a common source or &quot;prima materia&quot; (first matter), associated with chaos. &quot;Prima materia&quot; is also the name alchemists assign to the starting ingredient for the creation of the philosopher&#x27;s stone. The importance of this philosophical first matter persisted throughout the history of alchemy. In the seventeenth century, Thomas Vaughan writes, &quot;the first matter of the stone is the very same with the first matter of all things.&quot;

==Middle Ages==
In the Byzantine Empire and the Arab empires, early medieval alchemists built upon the work of Zosimos. Byzantine and Muslim alchemists were fascinated by the concept of metal transmutation and attempted to carry out the process. The eighth-century Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan (Latinized as &quot;Geber&quot;) analysed each classical element in terms of the four basic qualities. Fire was both hot and dry, earth cold and dry, water cold and moist, and air hot and moist. He theorized that every metal was a combination of these four principles, two of them interior and two exterior. From this premise, it was reasoned that the transmutation of one metal into another could be effected by the rearrangement of its basic qualities. This change would be mediated by a substance, which came to be called &quot;xerion&quot; in Greek and &quot;al-iksir&quot; in Arabic (from which the word &quot;elixir&quot; is derived). It was often considered to exist as a dry red powder (also known as &quot;al-kibrit al-ahmar&quot;, red sulfur) made from a legendary stone—the philosopher&#x27;s stone. The elixir powder came to be regarded as a crucial component of transmutation by later Arab alchemists.

In the 11th century, there was a debate among Muslim world chemists on whether the transmutation of substances was possible. A leading opponent was the Persian polymath Avicenna (Ibn Sina), who discredited the theory of the transmutation of substances, stating, &quot;Those of the chemical craft know well that no change can be effected in the different species of substances, though they can produce the appearance of such change.&quot;

According to legend, the 13th-century scientist and philosopher, Albertus Magnus, is said to have discovered the philosopher&#x27;s stone. Magnus does not confirm he discovered the stone in his writings, but he did record that he witnessed the creation of gold by &quot;transmutation&quot;.

==Renaissance to early modern period==

The 16th-century Swiss alchemist Paracelsus (&quot;Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim&quot;) believed in the existence of alkahest, which he thought to be an undiscovered element from which all other elements (earth, fire, water, air) were simply derivative forms. Paracelsus believed that this element was, in fact, the philosopher&#x27;s stone.

The English philosopher Sir Thomas Browne in his spiritual testament &quot;Religio Medici&quot; (1643) identified the religious aspect of the quest for the philosopher&#x27;s Stone when declaring:

A mystical text published in the 17th century called the &quot;Mutus Liber&quot; appears to be a symbolic instruction manual for concocting a philosopher&#x27;s stone. Called the &quot;wordless book&quot;, it was a collection of 15 illustrations.

==In Buddhism and Hinduism==

The equivalent of the philosopher&#x27;s stone in Buddhism and Hinduism is the &quot;Cintamani&quot;, also spelled as &quot;Chintamani&quot;. It is also referred to as Paras/Parasmani (, ) or Paris ().

In Mahayana Buddhism, &quot;Chintamani&quot; is held by the bodhisattvas, Avalokiteshvara and Ksitigarbha. It is also seen carried upon the back of the Lung ta (wind horse) which is depicted on Tibetan prayer flags. By reciting the Dharani of Chintamani, Buddhist tradition maintains that one attains the Wisdom of Buddhas, is able to understand the truth of the Buddhas, and turns afflictions into Bodhi. It is said to allow one to see the Holy Retinue of Amitabha and his assembly upon one&#x27;s deathbed. In Tibetan Buddhist tradition the Chintamani is sometimes depicted as a luminous pearl and is in the possession of several different forms of the Buddha.

Within Hinduism, it is connected with the gods Vishnu and Ganesha. In Hindu tradition it is often depicted as a fabulous jewel in the possession of the Nāga king or as on the forehead of the Makara. The &quot;Yoga Vasistha&quot;, originally written in the tenth century AD, contains a story about the philosopher&#x27;s stone.

A great Hindu sage wrote about the spiritual accomplishment of Gnosis using the metaphor of the philosopher&#x27;s stone. Sant Jnaneshwar (1275–1296) wrote a commentary with 17 references to the philosopher&#x27;s stone that explicitly transmutes base metal into gold. The seventh-century Siddhar Thirumoolar in his classic &quot;Tirumandhiram&quot; explains man&#x27;s path to immortal divinity. In verse 2709 he declares that the name of God, Shiva is an alchemical vehicle that turns the body into immortal gold.

Another depiction of the philosopher&#x27;s stone is the Shyāmantaka Mani (). According to Hindu mythology, the Shyāmantaka Mani is a ruby, capable of preventing all natural calamities such as droughts, floods, etc. around its owner, as well as producing eight bhāras (≈170 pounds or 700 kilograms) of gold, every day.

==Properties==
The most commonly mentioned properties are the ability to transmute base metals into gold or silver, and the ability to heal all forms of illness and prolong the life of any person who consumes a small part of the philosopher&#x27;s stone diluted in wine. Other mentioned properties include: creation of perpetually burning lamps, transmutation of common crystals into precious stones and diamonds, reviving of dead plants, creation of flexible or malleable glass, and the creation of a clone or homunculus.

===Names===
Numerous synonyms were used to make oblique reference to the stone, such as &quot;white stone&quot; (&quot;calculus albus&quot;, identified with the &quot;calculus candidus&quot; of Revelation 2:17 which was taken as a symbol of the glory of heaven), &quot;vitriol&quot; (as expressed in the backronym &quot;Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem&quot;), also &quot;lapis noster&quot;, &quot;lapis occultus&quot;, &quot;in water at the box&quot;, and numerous oblique, mystical or mythological references such as &quot;Adam, Aer, Animal, Alkahest, Antidotus, Antimonium, Aqua benedicta, Aqua volans per aeram, , Atramentum, Autumnus, Basilicus, Brutorum cor, Bufo, Capillus, Capistrum auri, Carbones, Cerberus, Chaos, Cinis cineris, Crocus, Dominus philosophorum, Divine quintessence, Draco elixir, Filius ignis, Fimus, Folium, Frater, Granum, Granum frumenti, Haematites, Hepar, Herba, Herbalis, Lac, Melancholia, Ovum philosophorum, Panacea salutifera, Pandora, Phoenix, Philosophic mercury, Pyrites, Radices arboris solares, Regina, Rex regum, Sal metallorum, Salvator terrenus, Talcum, Thesaurus, Ventus hermetis&quot;. Many of the medieval allegories of Christ were adopted for the &quot;lapis&quot;, and the Christ and the Stone were indeed taken as identical in a mystical sense. The name of &quot;Stone&quot; or &quot;lapis&quot; itself is informed by early Christian allegory, such as Priscillian (4th century), who stated,

In some texts, it is simply called &quot;stone&quot;, or our stone, or in the case of Thomas Norton&#x27;s Ordinal, &quot;oure delycious stone&quot;. The stone was frequently praised and referred to in such terms.

It may be noted that the Latin expression , as well as the Arabic from which the Latin derives, both employ the plural form of the word for &quot;philosopher&quot;. Thus a literal translation would be &quot;philosophers&#x27; stone&quot; rather than &quot;philosopher&#x27;s stone&quot;.

===Appearance===
Descriptions of the philosopher&#x27;s stone are numerous and various. According to alchemical texts, the stone of the philosophers came in two varieties, prepared by an almost identical method: white (for the purpose of making silver), and red (for the purpose of making gold), the white stone being a less matured version of the red stone. Some ancient and medieval alchemical texts leave clues to the physical appearance of the stone of the philosophers, specifically the red stone. It is often said to be orange (saffron coloured) or red when ground to powder. Or in a solid form, an intermediate between red and purple, transparent and glass-like. The weight is spoken of as being heavier than gold, and it is soluble in any liquid, and incombustible in fire.

Alchemical authors sometimes suggest that the stone&#x27;s descriptors are metaphorical. The appearance is expressed geometrically in &quot;Atalanta Fugiens&quot; Emblem XXI : 

He further describes in greater detail the metaphysical nature of the meaning of the emblem as a divine union of feminine and masculine principles:

Rupescissa uses the imagery of the Christian passion, saying that it ascends &quot;from the sepulcher of the Most Excellent King, shining and glorious, resuscitated from the dead and wearing a red diadem...&quot;.

==Interpretations==
The various names and attributes assigned to the philosopher&#x27;s stone have led to long-standing speculation on its composition and source. Exoteric candidates have been found in metals, plants, rocks, chemical compounds, and bodily products such as hair, urine, and eggs. Justus von Liebig states that &#x27;it was indispensable that every substance accessible... should be observed and examined&#x27;. Alchemists once thought a key component in the creation of the stone was a mythical element named carmot.

Esoteric hermetic alchemists may reject work on exoteric substances, instead directing their search for the philosopher&#x27;s stone inward. Though esoteric and exoteric approaches are sometimes mixed, it is clear that some authors &quot;are not concerned with material substances but are employing the language of exoteric alchemy for the sole purpose of expressing theological, philosophical, or mystical beliefs and aspirations&quot;. New interpretations continue to be developed around spagyric, chemical, and esoteric schools of thought.

The transmutation mediated by the stone has also been interpreted as a psychological process. Idries Shah devotes a chapter of his book, &quot;The Sufis&quot;, to provide a detailed analysis of the symbolic significance of alchemical work with the philosopher&#x27;s stone. His analysis is based in part on a linguistic interpretation through Arabic equivalents of one of the terms for the stone (Azoth) as well as for sulfur, salt, and mercury.

==Creation==

The philosopher&#x27;s stone is created by the alchemical method known as The Magnum Opus or The Great Work. Often expressed as a series of color changes or chemical processes, the instructions for creating the philosopher&#x27;s stone are varied. When expressed in colours, the work may pass through phases of nigredo, albedo, citrinitas, and rubedo. When expressed as a series of chemical processes it often includes seven or twelve stages concluding in multiplication, and projection.

==Art and entertainment==
The philosopher&#x27;s stone has been an inspiration, plot feature, or subject of innumerable artistic works: animations, comics, films, musical compositions, novels, and video games. Examples include &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone,&quot; &quot;As Above, So Below,&quot; &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist, The Flash and&quot; &quot;The Mystery of Mamo.&quot;

The philosopher&#x27;s stone is an important motif in Gothic fiction, and originated in William Godwin&#x27;s 1799 novel &quot;St. Leon&quot;.

<text>Donald Jay Rickles (May 8, 1926 – April 6, 2017) was an American stand-up comedian and actor. He was known primarily for his insult comedy. His film roles include &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot; (1958), &quot;Enter Laughing&quot; (1967), &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot; (1970), and &quot;Casino&quot; (1995). From 1976 to 1978, Rickles had a two-season starring role in the NBC television sitcom &quot;C.P.O. Sharkey&quot;, having previously starred in two eponymous half-hour programs, an ABC variety series titled &quot;The Don Rickles Show&quot; (1968) and a CBS sitcom identically titled &quot;The Don Rickles Show&quot; (1972).

A veteran headline performer at Las Vegas hotel-casinos and peripheral member of the Rat Pack via friendship with Frank Sinatra, Rickles received widespread exposure as a frequent guest on talk and variety shows, including &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, and The &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, and voiced Mr. Potato Head in the first four films of the &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise (1995–2019). He won a Primetime Emmy Award for the 2006 documentary &quot;Mr. Warmth: The Don Rickles Project&quot;. In 2014, he was honored by fellow comedians in a show at the Apollo Theater, which was taped and released on Spike TV titled &quot;Don Rickles: One Night Only&quot;.

== Early life ==
Rickles was born in Queens, New York on May 8, 1926. He was Jewish. His father Max Rickles (1896–1952) emigrated in 1903 with his Lithuanian parents from Kaunas. His mother Etta Rickles (&quot;née&quot; Feldman; 1898–1984) was born in New York City to Austrian immigrant parents. Rickles grew up in Jackson Heights.

After graduating from Newtown High School in 1944, Rickles enlisted in the United States Navy and served during World War II on the motor torpedo boat tender as a seaman first class. He was honorably discharged in 1946. Two years later, intending to be a dramatic actor, he studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and then played bit parts on television. Frustrated by a lack of acting work, Rickles began to perform comedy in clubs in New York, Miami, and Los Angeles. He became known as an insult comedian when he responded to his hecklers. The audience enjoyed these insults more than his prepared material, so he incorporated them into his act.

When Rickles started his career in the early 1950s, he started to call ill-mannered members of the audience &quot;hockey pucks&quot;. His style was similar to that of an older insult comic Jack E. Leonard, though Rickles denied Leonard influenced his style. During an interview on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, Rickles credited Milton Berle&#x27;s comedy style for inspiring him to enter show business.

==Career==
===Rise to fame===
While working in the &quot;Murray Franklin&#x27;s&quot; nightclub in Miami Beach, Florida, early during his career, Rickles spotted Frank Sinatra and remarked to him, &quot;I just saw your movie &quot;The Pride and the Passion&quot; and I wanna tell you, the cannon&#x27;s acting was great.&quot; He added, &quot;Make yourself at home, Frank. Hit somebody!&quot; Sinatra, whose pet name for Rickles was &quot;bullet-head&quot;, enjoyed him so much that he encouraged other celebrities to see Rickles&#x27;s act and be insulted by him. Sinatra&#x27;s support helped Rickles become a popular headline performer in Las Vegas. During a &quot;Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot; special, Rickles was among those who took part in roasting Sinatra, and Rickles himself was also roasted during another show in the series.

Rickles earned the nicknames &quot;The Merchant of Venom&quot; and &quot;Mr. Warmth&quot; for his poking fun at people of all ethnicities and all walks of life. When he was introduced to an audience or on a television talk show, Spanish matador music, &quot;La Virgen de la Macarena&quot;, would usually be played, subtly foreshadowing someone was about to be metaphorically gored. As Rickles observed, &quot;I always pictured myself facing the audience as the matador.&quot;

In 1958, Rickles made his film debut in a serious part in &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot; with Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster. Throughout the 1960s, he often appeared on television in sitcoms and dramatic series. Rickles guest-starred in &quot;Get Smart&quot; as Sid, an old war buddy of Max&#x27;s, who comes to stay with him. In an episode of &quot;Run for Your Life&quot;, Rickles portrayed a distressed comedian whose act culminates in him strangling a patron while imploring the patron to &quot;Laugh!&quot; Rickles took a dramatic turn in the low-budget Roger Corman science-fiction/horror film &quot;X: The Man with the X-Ray Eyes&quot; as a carnival barker out to exploit the title character (portrayed by Ray Milland).
Rickles appeared in the &quot;Beach Party&quot; film series. He recalled in his 2007 memoir that at a White House dinner, Barbara Bush teased him about his decision to appear in those films. Rickles&#x27;s agent Jack Gilardi was married to Annette Funicello when Rickles was cast in the &quot;Beach Party&quot; films. He subsequently began to appear more frequently on television talk shows, first appearing on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; in 1965. Rickles became a frequent guest and guest host, appearing more than 100 times on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; during Carson&#x27;s era. An early Carson–Rickles &quot;Tonight&quot; highlight occurred in 1968 when, while two Japanese women treated Carson to a bath and foot massage, Rickles walked onto the set. Rickles also made frequent appearances on &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; and became a fixture on &quot;The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot; specials.

In 1968, Rickles released a live comedy album titled &quot;Hello, Dummy!&quot;, which reached number 54 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. The same year, he starred in his own variety show on ABC, &quot;The Don Rickles Show&quot;, with comedy writer Pat McCormick as his sidekick; the show lasted only 17 episodes and was replaced by a prime time version of the game &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;. During the 1960s, Rickles made guest appearances on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, &quot;The Munsters&quot;, &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, &quot;The Mothers-in-Law&quot;, &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, &quot;Get Smart&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;Mr. Dingle, the Strong&quot;, &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot;, and &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;.

===Mid-career===

In 1970, Rickles had a notable role as Crapgame in &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, sharing the marquee poster with co-stars Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland, and Carroll O&#x27;Connor. In 1972, he starred in &quot;The Don Rickles Show&quot; (his second series with that title)&quot;,&quot; which lasted for 13 episodes. He also starred in a series of television specials. In his memoirs, Rickles acknowledged a scripted sitcom was not well-suited to his &quot;ad lib&quot; style of performing, as he had earlier said that he never wrote down his jokes.

Starting in 1973, he became a popular dais comedian appearing on &quot;The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot; specials. In 1976–1978, he starred in &quot;C.P.O. Sharkey&quot;, which lasted two seasons. The series is remembered for the cigarette box incident when Johnny Carson made an impromptu visit during a &quot;Tonight Show&quot; taping to the adjacent TV studio during an episode&#x27;s taping, feigning &quot;incensed&quot; ire that Rickles, an ex-smoker, broke Johnny Carson&#x27;s wooden box, from 1967, on the previous night, while a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, on which Bob Newhart was the guest host. The incident was often replayed in &quot;Tonight Show&quot; retrospectives and was considered a highlight of the 1970s era of the series. Rickles retorted that he would replace the box with an X-ray of Johnny Carson&#x27;s lungs.

Rickles occasionally appeared as a panelist on &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; and was depicted in comic-book form by Jack Kirby during his work on the &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal Jimmy Olsen&quot; series (part of Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World).

In the early 1980s, Rickles began to perform with Steve Lawrence in concerts in Las Vegas. In 1983, the duo co-hosted &quot;Foul-Ups, Bleeps &amp; Blunders&quot;, an imitation of &quot;TV&#x27;s Bloopers &amp; Practical Jokes&quot;. In 1982, he was in &quot;Death of a Lodger&quot;, an episode of &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;. In 1985, when Frank Sinatra was asked to organize and perform at Ronald Reagan&#x27;s second presidential inaugural celebration, he insisted Rickles be allowed to perform and do it unrehearsed. Rickles considered this performance the highpoint of his career.

In 1990, he appeared in the second-season episode of &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; titled &quot;The Ventriloquist&#x27;s Dummy&quot;. In 1992, he was cast in &quot;Innocent Blood&quot;, directed by John Landis. In his memoir, Rickles wrote that he recalled Landis was a &quot;production assistant&quot; to Brian G. Hutton during the filming of &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot;. During the filming of &quot;Innocent Blood&quot;, Rickles would kid Landis by ordering him to get coffee or to run other errands befitting his one-time &quot;gofer&quot; status.

In 1993, Rickles starred in another short-lived sitcom titled &quot;Daddy Dearest&quot;, with Richard Lewis. In 1995, he played Billy Sherbert in the Universal Pictures film &quot;Casino&quot; and voiced Mr. Potato Head in the Disney and Pixar film &quot;Toy Story.&quot; He reprised his role as Mr. Potato Head in &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; (1999). Rickles starred as George Wilson in 1998&#x27;s &quot;Dennis the Menace Strikes Again&quot;; that same year, he portrayed a film theater manager in &quot;Dirty Work&quot; and voiced Cornwall, one of the heads of a two-headed dragon, in &quot;Quest for Camelot&quot;. In 1999, he briefly appeared in a fictionalized form in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Viva Ned Flanders&quot;.

===Later works===
Rickles made a cameo appearance as himself in a recurring dream sequence in &quot;Sub Conscious&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Unit&quot;, which aired in February 2007.

On May 8, 2006, on his 80th birthday, Simon &amp; Schuster released his memoir titled &quot;Rickles&#x27; Book&quot;. &quot;Mr. Warmth: The Don Rickles Project&quot;, a documentary about Rickles directed by John Landis, made its debut on HBO on December 2, 2007. Rickles won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program, besting a number of notable comics, including David Letterman, Jon Stewart, and Stephen Colbert. Rickles remarked, &quot;Stephen Colbert&#x27;s a funny man, but he&#x27;s too young. He has got plenty of time to win awards, but this may be my last year and I think that I made it count. On second thought, it was probably just a mercy award for an old man.&quot; In 2009, Rickles appeared on &quot;Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List&quot; and met Griffin&#x27;s mother Maggie to fulfill one item on Maggie&#x27;s &quot;bucket list&quot;. In 2010, he appeared in a commercial during Super Bowl XLIV as a talking rose, and appeared on the 37th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards on CBS TV on June 27, 2010.

He reprised his role as Mr. Potato Head in &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010). In 2011, Rickles reunited with his &quot;Casino&quot; (1995) co-star Joe Pesci in a Snickers advertisement highlighting actors known for their &quot;short fuses&quot;. Rickles also portrayed the supposedly late husband of Elka (Betty White) on &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;— a &quot;surprise&quot; because his character was believed dead.

On May 28, 2014, Rickles was honored by Spike TV&#x27;s &quot;One Night Only: An All-Star Comedy Tribute to Don Rickles&quot;. Recorded live at New York City&#x27;s Apollo Theater, Jerry Seinfeld was the master of ceremonies for the two-hour special, with live monologues by Johnny Depp, Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro, Jon Stewart, David Letterman, Tracy Morgan, Brian Williams, Regis Philbin, Amy Poehler, and Tina Fey. Recorded segments included bits from Bob Newhart, Bill Cosby, Jimmy Kimmel, and Eddie Murphy. Seinfeld described Rickles as a part of the &quot;Mount Rushmore of Stand-up Comedy&quot; with George Carlin, Richard Pryor, and Bill Cosby.

He was still a frequent guest on late night talk shows, including &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; among others, during the later months of his life. On May 11, 2015, Rickles appeared as a guest on one of the final episodes of &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. He also made a cameo appearance in &quot;Grandfathered&quot;.

In an interview in 2014, he dismissed thoughts of retiring, stating: &quot;I&#x27;m in good health. I&#x27;m working better than I ever have. The audiences are great. Why should I retire? I&#x27;m like a fighter. The bell rings and you come out and fight. My energy comes alive. And I still enjoy it.&quot; Up until his death in 2017, despite being impeded by multiple surgeries following a bout with necrotizing fasciitis in 2013, he continued touring across the United States.

He was reportedly slated to reprise his role as Mr. Potato Head in &quot;Toy Story 4&quot; (2019), but he died without recording any of his lines of dialogue. With permission from his wife Barbara Rickles, Josh Cooley used unused archival audio from the previous three &quot;Toy Story&quot; films to honor him and dedicate to his memory.

==Filmography==
== Personal life ==
On March 14, 1965, Rickles married Barbara Sklar of Philadelphia. He admitted to having a difficult time romantically in his 20s and 30s, meeting Sklar through his agent when he was 38 years old and falling for her when she failed to get his sense of humor. They had two children: Mindy, an actress, and Larry, a producer who died of pneumonia at the age of 41. According to Rickles&#x27;s memoir, his grandchildren Ethan and Harrison Mann were much more impressed by his role as Mr. Potato Head than by any of his other achievements. Barbara died from non-Hodgkin lymphoma on March 14, 2021, exactly 56 years after the couple married.

Rickles befriended mobster &quot;Crazy&quot; Joe Gallo following a performance at the Copacabana in 1972. Gallo, whom Rickles had ribbed mercilessly during his set, despite being warned not to do so, accepted Rickles&#x27;s ribbings in good humor and invited him to Umberto&#x27;s Clam House after the show. Rickles declined the offer. That night, a gunfight erupted at Umberto&#x27;s, killing Gallo. This situation was dramatized in the movie The Irishman.

Rickles performed at the inaugurations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush with his friend Frank Sinatra, although Rickles himself was a lifelong Democrat. He considered Bob Newhart his best friend, and the two often vacationed together along with their wives, who were also close. Rickles and Newhart appeared together on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; on January 24, 2005, the Monday following Johnny Carson&#x27;s death, reminiscing about their many guest appearances on Carson&#x27;s show. The two also appeared together on the television sitcom &quot;Newhart&quot; and for previous episodes of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, where Newhart or Rickles were guest hosts. The friendship was memorialized in &quot;Bob &amp; Don: A Love Story&quot;, a 2023 short documentary film by Judd Apatow featuring interviews with and home movies of both families.

== Death ==
On April 6, 2017, Rickles died of kidney failure at his home in Century City, Los Angeles, at the age of 90. He was buried at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Many television hosts paid tribute to his comedic talents, with Conan O&#x27;Brien, Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon, Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers, and David Letterman among them. Barbra Streisand, Billy Crystal, Mel Brooks, &quot;Toy Story&quot; (1995) filmmaker John Lasseter, Ron Howard, Chris Rock, Patton Oswalt, Jim Carrey, Ricky Gervais and even his &quot;Toy Story&quot; (1995) co-stars Tom Hanks (the voice of Woody), Tim Allen (the voice of Buzz Lightyear) and Whoopi Goldberg (the voice of Stretch in &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;) paid their respects on Twitter. 

Bob Newhart said in a statement: &quot;He was called &#x27;The Merchant of Venom&#x27;, but in truth, he was one of the kindest, caring, and most sensitive human beings we have ever known. We are devastated, and our world will never be the same. We were totally unprepared for this.&quot;

Martin Scorsese, who directed him in &quot;Casino&quot; in 1995, stated: &quot;Don Rickles was a giant, a legend ... and I can hear his voice now, skewering me for being so lofty. I had the honor of working with him on my picture &quot;Casino&quot;. He was a professional. He kept me doubled over with laughter every day on the set – yet he was a complete pro. We became friends over the years, and I had the honor of being roasted by him more than once – sometimes when I didn&#x27;t expect it. He just started showing up at places and insulting me. Experiencing Don, and tuning into his mind, I witnessed the evolution of his comedy. It was like listening to a great jazz musician wail. Nobody else did what he did. He made comedy into an art form. And like all geniuses, comic or otherwise, he&#x27;s irreplaceable. He was much loved. I&#x27;m really missing this man.&quot;

At the 90th Academy Awards, The Academy honored Rickles in its annual in Memoriam segment. The film &quot;Toy Story 4&quot; was dedicated to his memory, as well as that of animator Adam Burke; while he would die before recording any dialogue, with the permission of Rickles&#x27;s family he would still reprise his role as Mr. Potato Head posthumously with the use of unused archival footage.

<text>In Orphic cosmogony Phanes (, genitive ) or Protogonos () is a primeval deity who was born from the cosmic egg at the beginning of creation. He is referred by various names, including [[Erikepaios]] &quot;Power&quot; () and [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]] &quot;Thought&quot;.

== Mythology ==
In Orphic cosmogony, Phanes is often equated with Eros or Mithras and has been depicted as a deity emerging from a cosmic egg entwined with a serpent: the Orphic egg. He had a helmet and had broad, golden wings. The Orphic cosmogony is quite unlike the creation sagas offered by Homer and Hesiod. Scholars have suggested that Orphism is &quot;un-Greek&quot;, even &quot;Asiatic&quot;, in conception because of its inherent dualism.

Chronos is said to have created the silver egg of the universe out of which burst the first-born deity Phanes, or Phanes-Dionysus. Phanes was a male god; in an original &quot;Orphic Hymn&quot; he is named as &quot;Lord Priapos&quot;, although others consider him androgynous.

Phanes was a deity of light and goodness, whose name meant &quot;to bring light&quot; or &quot;to shine&quot;; a first-born deity, he emerged from the abyss and gave birth to the universe. Nyx (Night) is variously said to be Phanes&#x27; daughter or older wife; she is the counterpart of Phanes and is considered by Aristophanes the first deity. According to Aristophanes, in a play where Phanes is called &quot;Eros&quot;, Phanes was born from an egg created by Nyx and placed in the boundless lap of Erebus, after which he mates with Chaos and creates the flying creatures.

In Orphic literature, Phanes was believed to have been hatched from the world egg of Chronos and Ananke &quot;Necessity, Fate&quot; or Nyx in the form of a black bird and wind. His older wife Nyx called him &quot;Protogenos&quot;. As she created nighttime, Phanes created daytime and the method of creation by mingling. He was made the ruler of the deities. This new Orphic tradition states that Phanes passed the sceptre to Nyx; Nyx later gave the sceptre to her son Ouranos; Cronus seized the sceptre from his father Ouranos; and finally, the sceptre held by Cronus was seized by Zeus, who holds it at present. Some Orphic myths suggest that Zeus intends to pass the sceptre to Dionysus.

According to the Athenian scholiast Damascius, Phanes was the first god &quot;expressible and acceptable to human ears&quot; (&quot;&quot;). Another &quot;Orphic Hymn&quot; states:
The Derveni papyrus refers to Phanes: 
In the &quot;Orphic Hymns&quot;, Phanes-Protogonus is identified with Dionysus, who is referred to under the names of Protogonus and Eubuleus several times in the collection.

<text>In the mathematical discipline of set theory, forcing is a technique for proving consistency and independence results. Intuitively, forcing can be thought of as a technique to expand the set theoretical universe formula_1 to a larger universe formula_2 by introducing a new &quot;generic&quot; object formula_3.

Forcing was first used by Paul Cohen in 1963, to prove the independence of the axiom of choice and the continuum hypothesis from Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. It has been considerably reworked and simplified in the following years, and has since served as a powerful technique, both in set theory and in areas of mathematical logic such as recursion theory. Descriptive set theory uses the notions of forcing from both recursion theory and set theory. Forcing has also been used in model theory, but it is common in model theory to define genericity directly without mention of forcing.

== Intuition ==
Forcing is usually used to construct an expanded universe that satisfies some desired property. For example, the expanded universe might contain many new real numbers (at least formula_4 of them), identified with subsets of the set formula_5 of natural numbers, that were not there in the old universe, and thereby violate the continuum hypothesis.

In order to intuitively justify such an expansion, it is best to think of the &quot;old universe&quot; as a model formula_6 of the set theory, which is itself a set in the &quot;real universe&quot; formula_1. By the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, formula_6 can be chosen to be a &quot;bare bones&quot; model that is externally countable, which guarantees that there will be many subsets (in formula_1) of formula_5 that are not in formula_6. Specifically, there is an ordinal formula_12 that &quot;plays the role of the cardinal formula_4&quot; in formula_6, but is actually countable in formula_1. Working in formula_1, it should be easy to find one distinct subset of formula_5 per each element of formula_12. (For simplicity, this family of subsets can be characterized with a single subset formula_19.)

However, in some sense, it may be desirable to &quot;construct the expanded model formula_20 within formula_6&quot;. This would help ensure that formula_20 &quot;resembles&quot; formula_6 in certain aspects, such as formula_24 being the same as formula_12 (more generally, that &quot;cardinal collapse&quot; does not occur), and allow fine control over the properties of formula_20. More precisely, every member of formula_20 should be given a (non-unique) &quot;name&quot; in formula_6. The name can be thought as an expression in terms of formula_29, just like in a simple field extension formula_30 every element of formula_31 can be expressed in terms of formula_32. A major component of forcing is manipulating those names within formula_6, so sometimes it may help to directly think of formula_6 as &quot;the universe&quot;, knowing that the theory of forcing guarantees that formula_20 will correspond to an actual model.

A subtle point of forcing is that, if formula_29 is taken to be an &quot;arbitrary&quot; &quot;missing subset&quot; of some set in formula_6, then the formula_20 constructed &quot;within formula_6&quot; may not even be a model. This is because formula_29 may encode &quot;special&quot; information about formula_6 that is invisible within formula_6 (e.g. the countability of formula_6), and thus prove the existence of sets that are &quot;too complex for formula_6 to describe&quot;.
Forcing avoids such problems by requiring the newly introduced set formula_29 to be a generic set relative to formula_6. Some statements are &quot;forced&quot; to hold for any generic formula_29: For example, a generic formula_29 is &quot;forced&quot; to be infinite. Furthermore, any property (describable in formula_6) of a generic set is &quot;forced&quot; to hold under some forcing condition. The concept of &quot;forcing&quot; can be defined within formula_6, and it gives formula_6 enough reasoning power to prove that formula_20 is indeed a model that satisfies the desired properties.

Cohen&#x27;s original technique, now called ramified forcing, is slightly different from the unramified forcing expounded here. Forcing is also equivalent to the method of Boolean-valued models, which some feel is conceptually more natural and intuitive, but usually much more difficult to apply.

=== The role of the model ===
In order for the above approach to work smoothly, formula_6 must in fact be a standard transitive model in formula_1, so that membership and other elementary notions can be handled intuitively in both formula_6 and formula_1. A standard transitive model can be obtained from any standard model through the Mostowski collapse lemma, but the existence of any standard model of formula_57 (or any variant thereof) is in itself a stronger assumption than the consistency of formula_57.

To get around this issue, a standard technique is to let formula_6 be a standard transitive model of an arbitrary finite subset of formula_57 (any axiomatization of formula_57 has at least one axiom schema, and thus an infinite number of axioms), the existence of which is guaranteed by the reflection principle. As the goal of a forcing argument is to prove consistency results, this is enough since any inconsistency in a theory must manifest with a derivation of a finite length, and thus involve only a finite number of axioms.

== Forcing conditions and forcing posets ==
Each forcing condition can be regarded as a &quot;finite&quot; piece of information regarding the object formula_29 adjoined to the model. There are many different ways of providing information about an object, which give rise to different forcing notions. A general approach to formalizing forcing notions is to regard forcing conditions as abstract objects with a poset structure.

A forcing poset is an ordered triple, formula_63, where formula_64 is a preorder on formula_65, and formula_66 is the largest element. Members of formula_65 are the forcing conditions (or just conditions). The order relation formula_68 means &quot;formula_69 is stronger than formula_70&quot;. (Intuitively, the &quot;smaller&quot; condition provides &quot;more&quot; information, just as the smaller interval formula_71 provides more information about the number  than the interval formula_72 does.) Furthermore, the preorder formula_64 must be atomless, meaning that it must satisfy the splitting condition:

*For each formula_74, there are formula_75 such that formula_76, with no formula_77 such that formula_78.

In other words, it must be possible to strengthen any forcing condition formula_79 in at least two incompatible directions. Intuitively, this is because formula_79 is only a finite piece of information, whereas an infinite piece of information is needed to determine formula_29.

There are various conventions in use. Some authors require formula_64 to also be antisymmetric, so that the relation is a partial order. Some use the term partial order anyway, conflicting with standard terminology, while some use the term preorder. The largest element can be dispensed with. The reverse ordering is also used, most notably by Saharon Shelah and his co-authors.

=== Examples ===

Let formula_83 be any infinite set (such as formula_5), and let the generic object in question be a new subset formula_85. In Cohen&#x27;s original formulation of forcing, each forcing condition is a &quot;finite&quot; set of sentences, either of the form formula_86 or formula_87, that are self-consistent (i.e. formula_86 &quot;and&quot; formula_87 for the same value of formula_90 do not appear in the same condition). This forcing notion is usually called Cohen forcing.

The forcing poset for Cohen forcing can be formally written as formula_91, the finite partial functions from formula_92 to formula_93 under &quot;reverse&quot; inclusion. Cohen forcing satisfies the splitting condition because given any condition formula_79, one can always find an element formula_95 not mentioned in formula_79, and add either the sentence formula_86 or formula_87 to formula_79 to get two new forcing conditions, incompatible with each other.

Another instructive example of a forcing poset is formula_100, where formula_101 and formula_102 is the collection of Borel subsets of formula_103 having non-zero Lebesgue measure. The generic object associated with this forcing poset is a random real number formula_104. It can be shown that formula_105 falls in every Borel subset of formula_106 with measure 1, provided that the Borel subset is &quot;described&quot; in the original unexpanded universe (this can be formalized with the concept of &quot;Borel codes&quot;). Each forcing condition can be regarded as a random event with probability equal to its measure. Due to the ready intuition this example can provide, probabilistic language is sometimes used with other divergent forcing posets.

== Generic filters ==

Even though each individual forcing condition formula_79 cannot fully determine the generic object formula_29, the set formula_109 of all true forcing conditions does determine formula_29. In fact, without loss of generality, formula_3 is commonly considered to &quot;be&quot; the generic object adjoined to formula_6, so the expanded model is called formula_113. It is usually easy enough to show that the originally desired object formula_29 is indeed in the model formula_113.

Under this convention, the concept of &quot;generic object&quot; can be described in a general way. Specifically, the set formula_3 should be a generic filter on formula_117 relative to formula_6. The &quot;filter&quot; condition means that it makes sense that formula_3 is a set of all true forcing conditions:

* formula_120
* formula_121
* if formula_122, then formula_123
* if formula_124, then there exists an formula_125 such that formula_126

For formula_127 to be &quot;generic relative to formula_6&quot; means:

* If formula_129 is a &quot;dense&quot; subset of formula_65 (that is, for each formula_74, there exists a formula_132 such that formula_133), then formula_134.

Given that formula_6 is a countable model, the existence of a generic filter formula_127 follows from the Rasiowa–Sikorski lemma. In fact, slightly more is true: Given a condition formula_74, one can find a generic filter formula_127 such that formula_139. Due to the splitting condition on formula_117, if formula_127 is a filter, then formula_142 is dense. If formula_143, then formula_144 because formula_145 is a model of formula_146. For this reason, a generic filter is never in formula_145.

== P-names and interpretations ==

Associated with a forcing poset formula_65 is the class formula_149 of formula_65-names. A formula_65-name is a set formula_152 of the form

:formula_153

Given any filter formula_127 on formula_65, the interpretation or valuation map from formula_65-names is given by

:formula_157

The formula_65-names are, in fact, an expansion of the universe. Given formula_159, one defines formula_160 to be the formula_65-name

:formula_162

Since formula_163, it follows that formula_164. In a sense, formula_165 is a &quot;name for formula_166&quot; that does not depend on the specific choice of formula_3.

This also allows defining a &quot;name for formula_3&quot; without explicitly referring to formula_3:

:formula_170

so that formula_171.

=== Rigorous definitions ===

The concepts of formula_117-names, interpretations, and formula_165 may be defined by transfinite recursion. With formula_174 the empty set, formula_175 the successor ordinal to ordinal formula_176, formula_177 the power-set operator, and formula_178 a limit ordinal, define the following hierarchy:

: formula_179

Then the class of formula_65-names is defined as

:formula_181

The interpretation map and the map formula_182 can similarly be defined with a hierarchical construction.

== Forcing ==

Given a generic filter formula_183, one proceeds as follows. The subclass of formula_65-names in formula_145 is denoted formula_186. Let

:formula_187

To reduce the study of the set theory of formula_188 to that of formula_145, one works with the &quot;forcing language&quot;, which is built up like ordinary first-order logic, with membership as the binary relation and all the formula_65-names as constants.

Define formula_191 (to be read as &quot;formula_79 forces formula_193 in the model formula_145 with poset formula_65&quot;), where formula_69 is a condition, formula_193 is a formula in the forcing language, and the formula_198&#x27;s are formula_65-names, to mean that if formula_127 is a generic filter containing formula_69, then formula_202. The special case formula_203 is often written as &quot;formula_204&quot; or simply &quot;formula_205&quot;. Such statements are true in formula_188, no matter what formula_127 is.

What is important is that this external definition of the forcing relation formula_208 is equivalent to an internal definition within formula_145, defined by transfinite induction (specifically formula_210-induction) over the formula_65-names on instances of formula_212 and formula_213, and then by ordinary induction over the complexity of formulae. This has the effect that all the properties of formula_188 are really properties of formula_145, and the verification of formula_146 in formula_188 becomes straightforward. This is usually summarized as the following three key properties:

*Truth: formula_218 if and only if it is forced by formula_127, that is, for some condition formula_139, we have formula_191.
*Definability: The statement &quot;formula_191&quot; is definable in formula_145.
*Coherence: formula_224.

=== Internal definition ===
There are many different but equivalent ways to define the forcing relation formula_225 in formula_6. One way to simplify the definition is to first define a modified forcing relation formula_227 that is strictly stronger than formula_225. The modified relation formula_227 still satisfies the three key properties of forcing, but formula_230 and formula_231 are not necessarily equivalent even if the first-order formulae formula_232 and formula_233 are equivalent. The unmodified forcing relation can then be defined as
formula_234
In fact, Cohen&#x27;s original concept of forcing is essentially formula_227 rather than formula_225.

The modified forcing relation formula_227 can be defined recursively as follows:
# formula_238 means formula_239
# formula_240 means formula_241
# formula_242 means formula_243
# formula_244 means formula_245
# formula_246 means formula_247
Other symbols of the forcing language can be defined in terms of these symbols: For example, formula_248 means formula_249, formula_250 means formula_251, etc. Cases 1 and 2 depend on each other and on case 3, but the recursion always refer to formula_117-names with lesser ranks, so transfinite induction allows the definition to go through.

By construction, formula_227 (and thus formula_225) automatically satisfies Definability. The proof that formula_227 also satisfies Truth and Coherence is by inductively inspecting each of the five cases above. Cases 4 and 5 are trivial (thanks to the choice of formula_256 and formula_257 as the elementary symbols), cases 1 and 2 relies only on the assumption that formula_3 is a filter, and only case 3 requires formula_3 to be a &quot;generic&quot; filter.

Formally, an internal definition of the forcing relation (such as the one presented above) is actually a transformation of an arbitrary formula formula_260 to another formula formula_261 where formula_79 and formula_117 are additional variables. The model formula_6 does not explicitly appear in the transformation (note that within formula_6, formula_266 just means &quot;formula_267 is a formula_117-name&quot;), and indeed one may take this transformation as a &quot;syntactic&quot; definition of the forcing relation in the universe formula_1 of all sets regardless of any countable transitive model. However, if one wants to force over some countable transitive model formula_6, then the latter formula should be interpreted under formula_6 (i.e. with all quantifiers ranging only over formula_6), in which case it is equivalent to the external &quot;semantic&quot; definition of formula_225 described at the top of this section:

: For any formula formula_260 there is a theorem formula_275 of the theory formula_57 (for example conjunction of finite number of axioms) such that for any countable transitive model formula_6 such that formula_278 and any atomless partial order formula_279 and any formula_117-generic filter formula_3 over formula_6 formula_283

This the sense under which the forcing relation is indeed &quot;definable in formula_6&quot;.

== Consistency ==

The discussion above can be summarized by the fundamental consistency result that, given a forcing poset formula_65, we may assume the existence of a generic filter formula_127, not belonging to the universe formula_287, such that formula_288 is again a set-theoretic universe that models formula_146. Furthermore, all truths in formula_288 may be reduced to truths in formula_287 involving the forcing relation.

Both styles, adjoining formula_127 to either a countable transitive model formula_145 or the whole universe formula_287, are commonly used. Less commonly seen is the approach using the &quot;internal&quot; definition of forcing, in which no mention of set or class models is made. This was Cohen&#x27;s original method, and in one elaboration, it becomes the method of Boolean-valued analysis.

== Cohen forcing ==

The simplest nontrivial forcing poset is formula_295, the finite partial functions from formula_296 to formula_93 under &quot;reverse&quot; inclusion. That is, a condition formula_69 is essentially two disjoint finite subsets formula_299 and formula_300 of formula_296, to be thought of as the &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; parts of with no information provided on values outside the domain of formula_69. &quot;formula_70 is stronger than formula_69&quot; means that formula_305, in other words, the &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; parts of formula_70 are supersets of the &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; parts of formula_69, and in that sense, provide more information.

Let formula_127 be a generic filter for this poset. If formula_69 and formula_70 are both in formula_127, then formula_312 is a condition because formula_127 is a filter. This means that formula_314 is a well-defined partial function from formula_296 to formula_316 because any two conditions in formula_127 agree on their common domain.

In fact, formula_318 is a total function. Given formula_319, let formula_320. Then formula_321 is dense. (Given any formula_69, if formula_323 is not in formula_69&#x27;s domain, adjoin a value for formula_323—the result is in formula_321.) A condition formula_327 has formula_323 in its domain, and since formula_329, we find that formula_330 is defined.

Let formula_331, the set of all &quot;yes&quot; members of the generic conditions. It is possible to give a name for formula_332 directly. Let

:formula_333

Then formula_334 Now suppose that formula_335 in formula_287. We claim that formula_337. Let

:formula_338

Then formula_339 is dense. (Given any formula_69, find formula_323 that is not in its domain, and adjoin a value for formula_323 contrary to the status of &quot;formula_343&quot;.) Then any formula_344 witnesses formula_337. To summarize, formula_332 is a &quot;new&quot; subset of formula_296, necessarily infinite.

Replacing formula_296 with formula_349, that is, consider instead finite partial functions whose inputs are of the form formula_350, with formula_351 and formula_352, and whose outputs are formula_353 or formula_354, one gets formula_355 new subsets of formula_296. They are all distinct, by a density argument: Given formula_357, let

:formula_358

then each formula_359 is dense, and a generic condition in it proves that the αth new set disagrees somewhere with the formula_360th new set.

This is not yet the falsification of the continuum hypothesis. One must prove that no new maps have been introduced which map formula_296 onto formula_362, or formula_362 onto formula_355. For example, if one considers instead formula_365, finite partial functions from formula_296 to formula_362, the first uncountable ordinal, one gets in formula_288 a bijection from formula_296 to formula_362. In other words, formula_362 has &quot;collapsed&quot;, and in the forcing extension, is a countable ordinal.

The last step in showing the independence of the continuum hypothesis, then, is to show that Cohen forcing does not collapse cardinals. For this, a sufficient combinatorial property is that all of the antichains of the forcing poset are countable.

== The countable chain condition ==

An (strong) antichain formula_152 of formula_65 is a subset such that if formula_374 and formula_375, then formula_69 and formula_70 are incompatible (written formula_378), meaning there is no formula_379 in formula_65 such that formula_381 and formula_382. In the example on Borel sets, incompatibility means that formula_383 has zero measure. In the example on finite partial functions, incompatibility means that formula_312 is not a function, in other words, formula_69 and formula_70 assign different values to some domain input.

formula_65 satisfies the countable chain condition (c.c.c.) if and only if every antichain in formula_65 is countable. (The name, which is obviously inappropriate, is a holdover from older terminology. Some mathematicians write &quot;c.a.c.&quot; for &quot;countable antichain condition&quot;.)

It is easy to see that formula_102 satisfies the c.c.c. because the measures add up to at most formula_354. Also, formula_391 satisfies the c.c.c., but the proof is more difficult.

Given an uncountable subfamily formula_392, shrink formula_393 to an uncountable subfamily formula_394 of sets of size formula_323, for some formula_396. If formula_397 for uncountably many formula_398, shrink this to an uncountable subfamily formula_399 and repeat, getting a finite set formula_400 and an uncountable family formula_401 of incompatible conditions of size formula_402 such that every formula_403 is in formula_404 for at most countable many formula_405. Now, pick an arbitrary formula_405, and pick from formula_401 any formula_70 that is not one of the countably many members that have a domain member in common with formula_69. Then formula_410 and formula_411 are compatible, so formula_393 is not an antichain. In other words, formula_391-antichains are countable.

The importance of antichains in forcing is that for most purposes, dense sets and maximal antichains are equivalent. A &quot;maximal&quot; antichain formula_152 is one that cannot be extended to a larger antichain. This means that every element formula_74 is compatible with some member of formula_152. The existence of a maximal antichain follows from Zorn&#x27;s Lemma. Given a maximal antichain formula_152, let

:formula_418

Then formula_419 is dense, and formula_134 if and only if formula_421. Conversely, given a dense set formula_419, Zorn&#x27;s Lemma shows that there exists a maximal antichain formula_423, and then formula_134 if and only if formula_421.

Assume that formula_65 satisfies the c.c.c. Given formula_427, with formula_428 a function in formula_288, one can approximate formula_430 inside formula_287 as follows. Let formula_432 be a name for formula_430 (by the definition of formula_288) and let formula_69 be a condition that forces formula_432 to be a function from formula_437 to formula_438. Define a function formula_439, by

:formula_440

By the definability of forcing, this definition makes sense within formula_287. By the coherence of forcing, a different formula_442 come from an incompatible formula_69. By c.c.c., formula_444 is countable.

In summary, formula_430 is unknown in formula_287 as it depends on formula_127, but it is not wildly unknown for a c.c.c.-forcing. One can identify a countable set of guesses for what the value of formula_430 is at any input, independent of formula_127.

This has the following very important consequence. If in formula_288, formula_451 is a surjection from one infinite ordinal onto another, then there is a surjection formula_452 in formula_287, and consequently, a surjection formula_454 in formula_287. In particular, cardinals cannot collapse. The conclusion is that formula_456 in formula_288.

== Easton forcing ==
The exact value of the continuum in the above Cohen model, and variants like formula_458 for cardinals formula_459 in general, was worked out by Robert M. Solovay, who also worked out how to violate formula_460 (the generalized continuum hypothesis), for regular cardinals only, a finite number of times. For example, in the above Cohen model, if formula_461 holds in formula_287, then formula_463 holds in formula_288.

William B. Easton worked out the proper class version of violating the formula_460 for regular cardinals, basically showing that the known restrictions, (monotonicity, Cantor&#x27;s Theorem and König&#x27;s Theorem), were the only formula_146-provable restrictions (see Easton&#x27;s Theorem).

Easton&#x27;s work was notable in that it involved forcing with a proper class of conditions. In general, the method of forcing with a proper class of conditions fails to give a model of formula_146. For example, forcing with formula_468, where formula_469 is the proper class of all ordinals, makes the continuum a proper class. On the other hand, forcing with formula_470 introduces a countable enumeration of the ordinals. In both cases, the resulting formula_288 is visibly not a model of formula_146.

At one time, it was thought that more sophisticated forcing would also allow an arbitrary variation in the powers of singular cardinals. However, this has turned out to be a difficult, subtle and even surprising problem, with several more restrictions provable in formula_146 and with the forcing models depending on the consistency of various large-cardinal properties. Many open problems remain.

== Random reals ==

Random forcing can be defined as forcing over the set formula_474 of all compact subsets of formula_475 of positive measure ordered by relation formula_476 (smaller set in context of inclusion is smaller set in ordering and represents condition with more information). There are two types of important dense sets:

# For any positive integer formula_477 the set formula_478 is dense, where formula_479 is diameter of the set formula_79.
# For any Borel subset formula_481 of measure 1, the set formula_482 is dense.

For any filter formula_3 and for any finitely many elements formula_484 there is formula_485 such that holds formula_486. In case of this ordering, this means that any filter is set of compact sets with finite intersection property. For this reason, intersection of all elements of any filter is nonempty. If formula_3 is a filter intersecting the dense set formula_488 for any positive integer formula_477, then the filter formula_3 contains conditions of arbitrarily small positive diameter. Therefore, the intersection of all conditions from formula_3 has diameter 0. But the only nonempty sets of diameter 0 are singletons. So there is exactly one real number formula_492 such that formula_493.

Let formula_494 be any Borel set of measure 1. If formula_3 intersects formula_496, then formula_497.

However, a generic filter over a countable transitive model formula_1 is not in formula_1. The real formula_492 defined by formula_3 is provably not an element of formula_1. The problem is that if formula_503, then formula_504 &quot;formula_79 is compact&quot;, but from the viewpoint of some larger universe formula_506, formula_79 can be non-compact and the intersection of all conditions from the generic filter formula_3 is actually empty. For this reason, we consider the set formula_509 of topological closures of conditions from G (i.e., formula_510). Because of formula_511 and the finite intersection property of formula_3, the set formula_513 also has the finite intersection property. Elements of the set formula_513 are bounded closed sets as closures of bounded sets. Therefore, formula_513
is a set of compact sets with the finite intersection property and thus has nonempty intersection. Since formula_516 and the ground model formula_1 inherits a metric from the universe formula_518, the set formula_513 has elements of arbitrarily small diameter. Finally, there is exactly one real that belongs to all members of the set formula_513. The generic filter formula_3 can be reconstructed from formula_492 as formula_523.

If formula_90 is name of formula_492, and for formula_526 holds formula_504&quot;formula_528 is Borel set of measure 1&quot;, then holds

:formula_529

for some formula_530. There is name formula_90 such that for any generic filter formula_3 holds

:formula_533

Then

:formula_529

holds for any condition formula_79.

Every Borel set can, non-uniquely, be built up, starting from intervals with rational endpoints and applying the operations of complement and countable unions, a countable number of times. The record of such a construction is called a &quot;Borel code&quot;. Given a Borel set formula_528 in formula_1, one recovers a Borel code, and then applies the same construction sequence in formula_2, getting a Borel set formula_539. It can be proven that one gets the same set independent of the construction of formula_540, and that basic properties are preserved. For example, if formula_541, then formula_542. If formula_528 has measure zero, then formula_539 has measure zero. This mapping formula_545 is injective.

For any set formula_494 such that formula_526 and formula_504&quot;formula_528 is a Borel set of measure 1&quot; holds formula_550.

This means that formula_105 is &quot;infinite random sequence of 0s and 1s&quot; from the viewpoint of formula_1, which means that it satisfies all statistical tests from the ground model formula_1.

So given formula_105, a random real, one can show that

:formula_555

Because of the mutual inter-definability between formula_105 and formula_127, one generally writes formula_558 for formula_2.

A different interpretation of reals in formula_2 was provided by Dana Scott. Rational numbers in formula_288 have names that correspond to countably-many distinct rational values assigned to a maximal antichain of Borel sets – in other words, a certain rational-valued function on formula_562. Real numbers in formula_2 then correspond to Dedekind cuts of such functions, that is, measurable functions.

== Boolean-valued models ==
Perhaps more clearly, the method can be explained in terms of Boolean-valued models. In these, any statement is assigned a truth value from some complete atomless Boolean algebra, rather than just a true/false value. Then an ultrafilter is picked in this Boolean algebra, which assigns values true/false to statements of our theory. The point is that the resulting theory has a model that contains this ultrafilter, which can be understood as a new model obtained by extending the old one with this ultrafilter. By picking a Boolean-valued model in an appropriate way, we can get a model that has the desired property. In it, only statements that must be true (are &quot;forced&quot; to be true) will be true, in a sense (since it has this extension/minimality property).

== Meta-mathematical explanation ==

In forcing, we usually seek to show that some sentence is consistent with formula_146 (or optionally some extension of formula_146). One way to interpret the argument is to assume that formula_146 is consistent and then prove that formula_146 combined with the new sentence is also consistent.

Each &quot;condition&quot; is a finite piece of information – the idea is that only finite pieces are relevant for consistency, since, by the compactness theorem, a theory is satisfiable if and only if every finite subset of its axioms is satisfiable. Then we can pick an infinite set of consistent conditions to extend our model. Therefore, assuming the consistency of formula_146, we prove the consistency of formula_146 extended by this infinite set.

== Logical explanation ==

By Gödel&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem, one cannot prove the consistency of any sufficiently strong formal theory, such as formula_146, using only the axioms of the theory itself, unless the theory is inconsistent. Consequently, mathematicians do not attempt to prove the consistency of formula_146 using only the axioms of formula_146, or to prove that formula_573 is consistent for any hypothesis formula_574 using only formula_573. For this reason, the aim of a consistency proof is to prove the consistency of formula_573 relative to the consistency of formula_146. Such problems are known as problems of relative consistency, one of which proves
The general schema of relative consistency proofs follows. As any proof is finite, it uses only a finite number of axioms:

: formula_578

For any given proof, formula_146 can verify the validity of this proof. This is provable by induction on the length of the proof.

: formula_580

Then resolve

: formula_581

By proving the following
it can be concluded that

: formula_582

which is equivalent to

: formula_583

which gives (*). The core of the relative consistency proof is proving (**). A formula_146 proof of formula_585 can be constructed for any given finite subset formula_586 of the formula_146 axioms (by formula_146 instruments of course). (No universal proof of formula_585 of course.)

In formula_146, it is provable that for any condition formula_69, the set of formulas (evaluated by names) forced by formula_69 is deductively closed. Furthermore, for any formula_146 axiom, formula_146 proves that this axiom is forced by formula_66. Then it suffices to prove that there is at least one condition that forces formula_574.

In the case of Boolean-valued forcing, the procedure is similar: proving that the Boolean value of formula_574 is not formula_598.

Another approach uses the Reflection Theorem. For any given finite set of formula_146 axioms, there is a formula_146 proof that this set of axioms has a countable transitive model. For any given finite set formula_586 of formula_146 axioms, there is a finite set formula_603 of formula_146 axioms such that formula_146 proves that if a countable transitive model formula_145 satisfies formula_603, then formula_188 satisfies formula_586. By proving that there is finite set formula_610 of formula_146 axioms such that if a countable transitive model formula_145 satisfies formula_610, then formula_188 satisfies the hypothesis formula_574. Then, for any given finite set formula_586 of formula_146 axioms, formula_146 proves formula_585.

Sometimes in (**), a stronger theory formula_92 than formula_146 is used for proving formula_585. Then we have proof of the consistency of formula_573 relative to the consistency of formula_92. Note that formula_625, where formula_626 is formula_627 (the axiom of constructibility).

<text>Penobscot Indian Island Reservation (Abenaki: &quot;Álənαpe Mə́nəhan&quot;) is an Indian reservation for the Penobscot Tribe of Maine, a federally recognized tribe of the Penobscot in Penobscot County, Maine, United States, near Old Town. The population was 758 at the 2020 census. The reservation extends for many miles alongside 15 towns and two unorganized territories in a thin string along the Penobscot River, from its base at Indian Island, near Old Town and Milford, northward to the vicinity of East Millinocket, almost entirely in Penobscot County. A small, uninhabited part of the reservation used as a game preserve and hunting and gathering ground is in South Aroostook, Aroostook County, by which it passes along its way northward.

==Government==
The Penobscot Tribe of Maine is headquartered in Indian Island, Maine. The tribal chief is Kirk Francis. The vice-chief is Mark Sockbeson.

== History ==
The Penobscot people long inhabited the area between present-day Old Town and Bangor, and still occupy tribal land on the nearby Penobscot Indian Island Reservation. The first European to visit the site was probably the Portuguese Estêvão Gomes in 1524, who was working for Spain. He was followed by the French explorer Samuel de Champlain in 1605. Champlain was looking for the mythical city of Norumbega, thought to be where Bangor now lies. French missionary priests settled among the Penobscot. This valley was contested between France and Britain into the 1750s; after Britain defeated France in the Seven Years&#x27; War, the territory became dominated by England. It was one of the last northern regions to become part of New England. One of the most important Penobscot chiefs was Madockawando.

=== King William&#x27;s War ===
There were tensions on the border between New England and Acadia, which New France defined as reaching the Kennebec River in southern Maine. English settlers from Massachusetts (whose charter included the Maine area) had expanded their settlements into Acadia. To secure New France&#x27;s claim to present-day Maine, New France established Catholic missions among the three largest native villages in the region: one on the Kennebec River (Norridgewock); one farther north on the Penobscot River (Penobscot) and one on the Saint John River (Medoctec). For their part, in response to King Philip&#x27;s War, the five Indian tribes in the region of Acadia created the Wabanaki Confederacy to form a political and military alliance with New France to stop the New England expansion.

On Abbé Petit&#x27;s advice, Father Louis-Pierre Thury settled at Pentagouet (Castine, Maine) in 1690, near Jean-Vincent d&#x27;Abbadie de Saint-Castin, where he remained eight years. He acquired great influence over the Abenaki and took part in their expeditions. In 1689 he accompanied Saint-Castin on the raid that resulted in the destruction of Pemaquid (1689); he left a detailed account of events. In 1692 Thury accompanied a war party against York (Maine) in what became known as the Candlemas Massacre.

==== Raid on Penobscot (1692) ====
Benjamin Church&#x27;s third expedition to Acadia during the war was in 1692 when he conducted a retaliatory raid with 450 men against the Penobscot village.

Two years later, Thury worked to thwart the actions of Phips, who wanted to keep the Abenaki neutral; Thury played an important role in retaining them under French influence. He took part in the attack against Pescadouet (Oyster Bay) in New Hampshire, and was present with Robinau de Villebon and a party of Abenaki at the capture of Pemaquid by Pierre Le Moyne d&#x27;Iberville in 1696. The bishop of Quebec made him his vicar general in 1698 and appointed him to be the superior of the missions in Acadia.

Madockawando and others from Penobscot fought alongside Hertel Portneuf and St. Castin at the Battle of Fort Loyal (May 1690). They were also involved in Raid on Wells (1692). Finally they accompanied Villie in the Raid on Oyster River in 1694. He died during the war in 1697.

=== Father Rale&#x27;s War ===

==== Raid on Thomaston (1722) ====
On 15 July 1722, Father Lauverjat from Penobscot led 500-600 natives from Penobscot and Medunic (Maliseet) to lay siege to Fort St. Georges in Colonel Thomas Westbrook&#x27;s home town of Thomaston for twelve days. They burned the sawmill, a large sloop, and sundry houses, and killed many of their cattle. Five New Englanders were killed and seven were taken prisoner, while the New Englanders killed twenty Maliseet and Penobscot warriors.

==== Raid on Penobscot (1723) ====
During Father Rale&#x27;s War, Father Lauverjat was established at the mission. On March 9, 1723, Colonel Thomas Westbrook from Thomaston led 230 men to the Penobscot River and traveled approximately upstream to the Penobscot village. They found a large Penobscot fort— by , with walls surrounding 23 wigwams. There was also a large chapel (). The village was vacant of people, and the soldiers burned it to the ground.

Starting in 1775, Condeskeag became the site of treaty negotiations by which the Penobscot people were made to give up almost all their ancestral lands, a process complete by about 1820, when Maine became a state. The tribe was eventually left with only their main village on an island upriver from Bangor, called &quot;Indian Old Town&quot; by the settlers. Eventually a white settlement taking the name Old Town was planted on the river bank opposite the Penobscot village, which began to be called &quot;Indian Island.&quot; It continues as the base of the federally recognized Penobscot Nation.

== Tourism ==
The reservation is home to a small museum. Penobscot High Stakes Bingo, which operated from 1973 until 2015, was one of the first Native American gambling enterprises operating in the country.

== Notable residents ==

* Sherri Mitchell, author and attorney
* ssipsis, a writer who grew up on the reservation
* June Sapiel, activist 
* Molly Spotted Elk, dancer, actress, and writer

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the Indian reservation has a total area of . of it is land and of it (65.70%) is water.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 562 people, 214 households, and 157 families living in the Indian reservation. The population density was 72.5/mi2 (28.0/km2). There were 263 housing units at an average density of 34.0/mi2 (13.1/km2). The racial makeup of the Indian reservation was 14.59% White, 84.88% Native American, and 0.53% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.53% of the population. As of the 2009 U.S Census Bureau estimate, there were 541 people living in the reservation.

There were 214 households, out of which 44.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 35.0% were married couples living together, 25.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.6% were non-families. 22.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.61 and the average family size was 2.97.

In the Indian reservation the population was spread out, with 33.3% under the age of 18, 6.6% from 18 to 24, 31.3% from 25 to 44, 19.2% from 45 to 64, and 9.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32 years. For every 100 females there were 92.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 84.7 males.

The median income for a household in the Indian reservation was $24,653, and the median income for a family was $24,000. Males had a median income of $34,500 versus $23,194 for females. The per capita income for the Indian reservation was $13,704. About 23.5% of families and 22.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 28.3% of those under age 18 and 6.1% of those age 65 or over.

==In popular culture==
The climax of the 1825 novel &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot; by Maine native John Neal is set on Indian Island during the American Revolutionary War. The novel features a protagonist of mixed Penobscot-English descent and describes the island as &quot;the last encampment of the Penobscot Red men&quot;.

<doc id="152207" wikidata="Q1149458" url="?curid=152207" title="Compactness theorem">
<text>In mathematical logic, the compactness theorem states that a set of first-order sentences has a model if and only if every finite subset of it has a model. This theorem is an important tool in model theory, as it provides a useful (but generally not effective) method for constructing models of any set of sentences that is finitely consistent.

The compactness theorem for the propositional calculus is a consequence of Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem (which says that the product of compact spaces is compact) applied to compact Stone spaces, hence the theorem&#x27;s name. Likewise, it is analogous to the finite intersection property characterization of compactness in topological spaces: a collection of closed sets in a compact space has a non-empty intersection if every finite subcollection has a non-empty intersection.

The compactness theorem is one of the two key properties, along with the downward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, that is used in Lindström&#x27;s theorem to characterize first-order logic. Although there are some generalizations of the compactness theorem to non-first-order logics, the compactness theorem itself does not hold in them, except for a very limited number of examples.

==History==
Kurt Gödel proved the countable compactness theorem in 1930. Anatoly Maltsev proved the uncountable case in 1936.

==Applications==

The compactness theorem has many applications in model theory; a few typical results are sketched here.

===Robinson&#x27;s principle===

The compactness theorem implies the following result, stated by Abraham Robinson in his 1949 dissertation. 

Robinson&#x27;s principle: If a first-order sentence holds in every field of characteristic zero, then there exists a constant formula_1 such that the sentence holds for every field of characteristic larger than formula_2 This can be seen as follows: suppose formula_3 is a sentence that holds in every field of characteristic zero. Then its negation formula_4 together with the field axioms and the infinite sequence of sentences 
formula_5
is not satisfiable (because there is no field of characteristic 0 in which formula_6 holds, and the infinite sequence of sentences ensures any model would be a field of characteristic 0). Therefore, there is a finite subset formula_7 of these sentences that is not satisfiable. formula_7 must contain formula_6 because otherwise it would be satisfiable. Because adding more sentences to formula_7 does not change unsatisfiability, we can assume that formula_7 contains the field axioms and, for some formula_12 the first formula_13 sentences of the form formula_14 Let formula_15 contain all the sentences of formula_7 except formula_17 Then any field with a characteristic greater than formula_13 is a model of formula_19 and formula_6 together with formula_15 is not satisfiable. This means that formula_3 must hold in every model of formula_19 which means precisely that formula_3 holds in every field of characteristic greater than formula_25 This completes the proof. 

The Lefschetz principle, one of the first examples of a transfer principle, extends this result. A first-order sentence formula_3 in the language of rings is true in (or equivalently, in ) algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 (such as the complex numbers for instance) if and only if there exist infinitely many primes formula_1 for which formula_3 is true in algebraically closed field of characteristic formula_29 in which case formula_3 is true in algebraically closed fields of sufficiently large non-0 characteristic formula_2 
One consequence is the following special case of the Ax–Grothendieck theorem: all injective complex polynomials formula_32 are surjective (indeed, it can even be shown that its inverse will also be a polynomial). In fact, the surjectivity conclusion remains true for any injective polynomial formula_33 where formula_34 is a finite field or the algebraic closure of such a field.

===Upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem===

A second application of the compactness theorem shows that any theory that has arbitrarily large finite models, or a single infinite model, has models of arbitrary large cardinality (this is the Upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem). So for instance, there are nonstandard models of Peano arithmetic with uncountably many &#x27;natural numbers&#x27;. To achieve this, let formula_35 be the initial theory and let formula_36 be any cardinal number. Add to the language of formula_35 one constant symbol for every element of formula_38 Then add to formula_35 a collection of sentences that say that the objects denoted by any two distinct constant symbols from the new collection are distinct (this is a collection of formula_40 sentences). Since every subset of this new theory is satisfiable by a sufficiently large finite model of formula_41 or by any infinite model, the entire extended theory is satisfiable. But any model of the extended theory has cardinality at least formula_36.

===Non-standard analysis===

A third application of the compactness theorem is the construction of nonstandard models of the real numbers, that is, consistent extensions of the theory of the real numbers that contain &quot;infinitesimal&quot; numbers. To see this, let formula_43 be a first-order axiomatization of the theory of the real numbers. Consider the theory obtained by adding a new constant symbol formula_44 to the language and adjoining to formula_43 the axiom formula_46 and the axioms formula_47 for all positive integers formula_48 Clearly, the standard real numbers formula_49 are a model for every finite subset of these axioms, because the real numbers satisfy everything in formula_43 and, by suitable choice of formula_51 can be made to satisfy any finite subset of the axioms about formula_52 By the compactness theorem, there is a model formula_53 that satisfies formula_43 and also contains an infinitesimal element formula_52 

A similar argument, this time adjoining the axioms formula_56 etc., shows that the existence of numbers with infinitely large magnitudes cannot be ruled out by any axiomatization formula_43 of the reals. 

It can be shown that the hyperreal numbers formula_53 satisfy the transfer principle: a first-order sentence is true of formula_49 if and only if it is true of formula_60 

==Proofs==

One can prove the compactness theorem using Gödel&#x27;s completeness theorem, which establishes that a set of sentences is satisfiable if and only if no contradiction can be proven from it. Since proofs are always finite and therefore involve only finitely many of the given sentences, the compactness theorem follows. In fact, the compactness theorem is equivalent to Gödel&#x27;s completeness theorem, and both are equivalent to the Boolean prime ideal theorem, a weak form of the axiom of choice.

Gödel originally proved the compactness theorem in just this way, but later some &quot;purely semantic&quot; proofs of the compactness theorem were found; that is, proofs that refer to but not to . One of those proofs relies on ultraproducts hinging on the axiom of choice as follows:

Proof: 
Fix a first-order language formula_61 and let formula_43 be a collection of formula_63-sentences such that every finite subcollection of formula_63-sentences, formula_65 of it has a model formula_66 Also let formula_67 be the direct product of the structures and formula_68 be the collection of finite subsets of formula_69 For each formula_70 let formula_71 
The family of all of these sets formula_72 generates a proper filter, so there is an ultrafilter formula_73 containing all sets of the form formula_74

Now for any sentence formula_3 in formula_76
* the set formula_77 is in formula_73
* whenever formula_79 then formula_80 hence formula_3 holds in formula_82
* the set of all formula_83 with the property that formula_3 holds in formula_82 is a superset of formula_86 hence also in formula_73
Łoś&#x27;s theorem now implies that formula_3 holds in the ultraproduct formula_89 So this ultraproduct satisfies all formulas in formula_69

<text>The Government of Ireland Act 1920 (10 &amp; 11 Geo. 5. c. 67) was an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Act&#x27;s long title was &quot;An Act to provide for the better government of Ireland&quot;; it is also known as the Fourth Home Rule Bill or (inaccurately) as the Fourth Home Rule Act and informally known as the Partition Act. The Act was intended to partition Ireland into two self-governing polities: the six north-eastern counties were to form &quot;Northern Ireland&quot;, while the larger part of the country was to form &quot;Southern Ireland&quot;. Both territories were to remain part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and provision was made for their future reunification through a Council of Ireland. The Act was passed by the British Parliament in November 1920, received royal assent in December and came into force on 3 May 1921.

The smaller Northern Ireland was duly created with a devolved government and remained in the UK. The larger Southern Ireland was not recognized by most of its citizens, who instead recognized the self-declared Irish Republic in the ongoing Irish War of Independence. The conflict resulted in the Anglo-Irish Treaty in December 1921. Under the treaty, Ireland would leave the UK (with the option for Northern Ireland to opt out and remain in the UK, which it immediately did) in December 1922 and become the Irish Free State, which would later evolve into today&#x27;s Republic of Ireland. The institutions set up under this Act for Northern Ireland continued to function until they were suspended by the British parliament in 1972 as a consequence of the Troubles.

The remaining provisions of the Act still in force in Northern Ireland were repealed under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.

== Background ==
Various attempts had been made to give Ireland limited regional self-government, known as Home rule, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The First Home Rule Bill of 1886 was defeated in the House of Commons because of a split in the Liberal Party over the principle of Home Rule, while the Second Home Rule Bill of 1893, having been passed by the Commons was vetoed by the House of Lords. The Third Home Rule Bill introduced in 1912 by the Irish Parliamentary Party could no longer be vetoed after the passing of the Parliament Act 1911 which removed the power of the Lords to veto bills. They could merely be delayed for two years.

Because of the continuing threat of civil war in Ireland, King George V called the Buckingham Palace Conference in July 1914 where Irish Nationalist and Unionist leaders failed to reach agreement. Controversy continued over the rival demands of Irish Nationalists, backed by the Liberals (for all-Ireland home rule), and Irish Unionists, backed by the Conservatives, for the exclusion of most or all of the province of Ulster. In an attempt at compromise, the British government put forward an amending bill, which would have allowed for Ulster to be temporarily excluded from the working of the Act; this failed to satisfy either side and the stalemate continued until overtaken by the outbreak of World War I. A few weeks after the British entry into the war, the Act received Royal Assent, while the amending bill was abandoned. However, the Suspensory Act 1914 (which received Royal Assent on the same day) meant that implementation would be suspended for the duration of what was expected to be only a short European war.

== Developments in Ireland ==
During the Great War, Irish politics moved decisively in a different direction. Several events, including the Easter Rising of 1916, the subsequent reaction of the British Government and the Conscription Crisis of 1918, had altered the state of Irish politics and contributed to Sinn Féin becoming the dominant voice of Irish nationalism. Sinn Féin, standing for &#x27;an independent sovereign Ireland&#x27;, won 73 of the 105 parliamentary seats on the island in the 1918 general election. Its elected members established their own parliament, Dáil Éireann, which declared the country&#x27;s independence as the Irish Republic. Dáil Éireann, after a number of meetings, was declared illegal in September 1919 by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Viscount French.

When the Act became law on 23 December 1920 it was already out of touch with realities in Ireland. The long-standing demand for home rule had been replaced among nationalists by a demand for complete independence (an Irish Republic). The Republic&#x27;s army was waging the Irish War of Independence against British rule, which had reached a nadir in late 1920.

== Long&#x27;s committee &amp; Bill Approval==

A delay ensued because of the effective end of the First World War in November 1918, the Paris Peace Conference, 1919 and the Treaty of Versailles that was signed in June 1919. Starting in September 1919, with the British Government, now led by David Lloyd George, committed under all circumstances to implementing Home Rule, the British cabinet&#x27;s Committee for Ireland, under the chairmanship of former Ulster Unionist Party leader Walter Long, pushed for a radical new solution. Long proposed the creation of two Irish home rule entities, Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland, each with unicameral parliaments. The House of Lords accordingly amended the old Bill to create a new Bill which provided for two bicameral parliaments, &quot;consisting of His Majesty, the Senate of (Northern or Southern) Ireland, and the House of Commons of (Northern or Southern) Ireland.&quot;

The Bill&#x27;s second reading debates in late March 1920 revealed that already a large number of Irish members of parliament present felt that the proposals were unworkable.

For a variety of reasons all the Ulster Unionist Member of Parliament (MP) at Westminster voted against the Act. They preferred that all or most of Ulster would remain fully within the United Kingdom, accepting the proposed northern Home Rule state only as the second best option. The Long Committee originally called for all nine Counties of Ulster to be included in Northern Ireland. When it became clear that three counties of Ulster would be excluded from Northern Ireland, southern Unionists left the Irish Unionist Alliance (dissolved in 1922) and formed the Unionist Anti-Partition League in opposition to the impending partition of Ireland.

After considerable delays in debating the financial aspects of the measure, the substantive third reading of the Bill was approved by a large majority on 11 November 1920. On the day of the passing of the Act the MP representing North East Tyrone, Thomas Harbison predicted that violence would result in his constituency: 

A considerable number of the Irish Members present voted against the Bill, including Southern Unionists such as Maurice Dockrell and Nationalists like Joe Devlin. Most Irish MPs were abstaining from Westminster, sitting in Dáil Éireann.

== Two &#x27;Home Rule&#x27; Irelands ==
The Act divided Ireland into two territories, Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland, each intended to be self-governing, except in areas specifically reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom: chief amongst these were matters relating to the Crown, to defence, foreign affairs, international trade and currency. During a speech at Caernarvon (in October 1920) Lloyd George stated his reasoning for reserving specific governmental functions: &quot;The Irish temper is an uncertainty and dangerous forces like armies and navies are better under the control of the Imperial Parliament.&quot;

Northern Ireland was defined as &quot;the parliamentary counties of Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry and Tyrone, and the parliamentary boroughs of Belfast and Londonderry&quot;, and Southern Ireland was defined as &quot;so much of Ireland as is not comprised within the said parliamentary counties and boroughs&quot;. Northern Ireland, amounting to six of the nine counties of Ulster, was seen as the maximum area within which Unionists could be expected to have a safe majority. This was in spite of the fact that in the last all-Ireland election (1918 United Kingdom general election in Ireland) counties Fermanagh and Tyrone had Sinn Féin/Nationalist Party (Irish Parliamentary Party) majorities. Apparently referring to the results of that election, on 14 December 1921 the British Prime Minister spoke of the coercion of Tyrone and Fermanagh: 

== Structures of the governmental system ==
At the apex of the governmental system was to be the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, who would be the Monarch&#x27;s representative in both of the Irish home rule regions. The system was based on colonial constitutional theories. Executive authority was to be vested in the crown and, in theory, not answerable to either parliament. The Lord Lieutenant would appoint a cabinet that did not need parliamentary support. No provision existed for a prime minister.

Such structures matched the theory in the British dominions, such as Canada and Australia, where in powers belonged to the governor-general and there was no normal responsibility to parliament. In reality, governments had long come to be chosen from parliament and to be answerable to it. Prime ministerial offices had come into existence. Such developments were also expected to happen in Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland, but technically were not required under the Act.

== Constituency reform ==

The Act revised the constituencies in the Redistribution of Seats (Ireland) Act 1918 for elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom. In place of the 105 UK MPs for all of Ireland in 1918, there were to be 33 UK MPs from Southern Ireland and 13 UK MPs from Northern Ireland. The same constituencies were to elect 128 MPs to the Southern Ireland House of Commons and 52 MPs to the Northern Ireland House of Commons. Elections for the two Irish parliaments took place in May 1921. No elections were held in Southern Ireland to the United Kingdom House of Commons as the Irish Free State was due to be established on 6 December 1922, less than a month after the 1922 United Kingdom general election.

== Potential for Irish unity ==
As well as sharing the same viceroy, a Council of Ireland was to be composed of 20 members from each Parliament. The council would co-ordinate matters of common concern to the two parliaments (transport, health, agriculture etc.). Each Parliament was to possess the ability, in identical motions, to vote powers to the council, which Britain intended should evolve into a single Irish Parliament. The council had little real power – the provisions of the Act called for the council to promote consultations which could lead to eventual unity. The Council never met.

== Aftermath ==
=== Northern Ireland ===
The Parliament of Northern Ireland came into being in June 1921. At its inauguration, in Belfast City Hall, King George V made a famous appeal for Anglo-Irish and north–south reconciliation. The speech, drafted by the government of David Lloyd George on recommendations from Jan Smuts Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa, with the enthusiastic backing of the King, opened the door for formal contact between the British Government and the Republican administration of Éamon de Valera.

Though it was superseded in large part, its repeal remained a matter of controversy until accomplished in the 1990s (under the provisions of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement).

=== Southern Ireland ===
All 128 MPs elected to the House of Commons of Southern Ireland in the May 1921 elections were returned unopposed; 124 of them, representing Sinn Féin, declared themselves TDs (&quot;Teachtaí Dála&quot;, Irish for &quot;Dáil Deputies&quot;) and assembled as the Second Dáil of the Irish Republic.

With only the four Independent Unionist MPs, who had been elected for the Dublin University constituency and fifteen appointed senators turning up for the state opening of the Parliament of Southern Ireland at the Royal College of Science in Dublin (now Government Buildings) in June 1921, the new legislature was suspended. Southern Ireland was ruled, for the time being, directly from London as it had been before the Government of Ireland Act.

The Provisional Government of the Irish Free State was constituted on 14 January 1922 &quot;at a meeting of members of the Parliament elected for constituencies in Southern Ireland&quot;. That meeting was not convened as a meeting of the House of Commons of Southern Ireland nor as a meeting of the Dáil. Instead, it was convened by Arthur Griffith as &quot;Chairman of the Irish Delegation of Plenipotentiaries&quot; (who had signed the Anglo-Irish Treaty) under the terms of the Treaty.

Elections in June 1922 were followed by the meeting of the Third Dáil, which worked as a Constituent Assembly to draft a constitution for the Irish Free State. For the purposes of British law the constitution was confirmed by the Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922; the new state then came into being on 6 December 1922.

=== Consequences ===
The Treaty provided for the ability of Northern Ireland&#x27;s Parliament, by formal address, to opt out of the new Irish Free State, which as expected, the Parliament of Northern Ireland brought into effect on 7 December 1922 (the day after the establishment of the Irish Free State). An Irish Boundary Commission was set up to redraw the border between the new Irish Free State and Northern Ireland, but it remained unchanged in return for financial concessions and the British and Irish governments agreed to suppress its report. In regards to the possible loss of territory due to the Boundary Commissions findings, on 25 January 1922 James Craig, the 1st Prime Minister of Northern Ireland stated: &quot;&quot;I will never give in to any re-arrangement of the boundary that leaves our Ulster area less than it is under the Government of Ireland Act&quot; The newly formed Government of Northern Ireland refused to appoint a representative to the Boundary Commission. The Council of Ireland never functioned as hoped (as an embryonic all-Ireland parliament), as the new governments decided to find a better mechanism in January 1922.

In consequence of the establishment of the Irish Free State, the British parliament passed the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922, which made a number of adjustments to Northern Ireland&#x27;s system of government as set up by the 1920 Act. Most notably, the office of Lord Lieutenant was abolished, being replaced by the new office of Governor of Northern Ireland.

== Repeal ==
The final provisions of the 1920 Act remaining in force in the United Kingdom were repealed under the terms of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, after the Good Friday Agreement. In the republic, the Statute Law Revision Act 2007 repealed the Act almost 85 years after Constitution of the Irish Free State replaced it as the basic constitutional law.

<doc id="152214" wikidata="Q191849" url="?curid=152214" title="Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory">
<text>In set theory, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, named after mathematicians Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel, is an axiomatic system that was proposed in the early twentieth century in order to formulate a theory of sets free of paradoxes such as Russell&#x27;s paradox. Today, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, with the historically controversial axiom of choice (AC) included, is the standard form of axiomatic set theory and as such is the most common foundation of mathematics. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice included is abbreviated ZFC, where C stands for &quot;choice&quot;, and ZF refers to the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice excluded.

Informally, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory is intended to formalize a single primitive notion, that of a hereditary well-founded set, so that all in the universe of discourse are such sets. Thus the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory refer only to pure sets and prevent its models from containing urelements (elements that are not themselves sets). Furthermore, proper classes (collections of mathematical objects defined by a property shared by their members where the collections are too big to be sets) can only be treated indirectly. Specifically, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory does not allow for the existence of a universal set (a set containing all sets) nor for unrestricted comprehension, thereby avoiding Russell&#x27;s paradox. Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory (NBG) is a commonly used conservative extension of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory that does allow explicit treatment of proper classes.

There are many equivalent formulations of the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. Most of the axioms state the existence of particular sets defined from other sets. For example, the axiom of pairing says that given any two sets formula_1 and formula_2 there is a new set formula_3 containing exactly formula_1 and formula_2. Other axioms describe properties of set membership. A goal of the axioms is that each axiom should be true if interpreted as a statement about the collection of all sets in the von Neumann universe (also known as the cumulative hierarchy).

The metamathematics of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory has been extensively studied. Landmark results in this area established the logical independence of the axiom of choice from the remaining Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms and of the continuum hypothesis from ZFC. The consistency of a theory such as ZFC cannot be proved within the theory itself, as shown by Gödel&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem.


== History ==
The modern study of set theory was initiated by Georg Cantor and Richard Dedekind in the 1870s. However, the discovery of paradoxes in naive set theory, such as Russell&#x27;s paradox, led to the desire for a more rigorous form of set theory that was free of these paradoxes.

In 1908, Ernst Zermelo proposed the first axiomatic set theory, Zermelo set theory. However, as first pointed out by Abraham Fraenkel in a 1921 letter to Zermelo, this theory was incapable of proving the existence of certain sets and cardinal numbers whose existence was taken for granted by most set theorists of the time, notably the cardinal number aleph-omega (formula_6) and the set formula_7 where formula_8 is any infinite set and formula_9 is the power set operation. Moreover, one of Zermelo&#x27;s axioms invoked a concept, that of a &quot;definite&quot; property, whose operational meaning was not clear. In 1922, Fraenkel and Thoralf Skolem independently proposed operationalizing a &quot;definite&quot; property as one that could be formulated as a well-formed formula in a first-order logic whose atomic formulas were limited to set membership and identity. They also independently proposed replacing the axiom schema of specification with the axiom schema of replacement. Appending this schema, as well as the axiom of regularity (first proposed by John von Neumann), to Zermelo set theory yields the theory denoted by &quot;ZF&quot;. Adding to ZF either the axiom of choice (AC) or a statement that is equivalent to it yields ZFC.

== Formal language ==
Formally, ZFC is a one-sorted theory in first-order logic. The equality symbol can be treated as either a primitive logical symbol or a high-level abbreviation for having exactly the same elements. The former approach is the most common. The signature has a single predicate symbol, usually denoted formula_10, which is a predicate symbol of arity 2 (a binary relation symbol). This symbol symbolizes a set membership relation. For example, the formula formula_11 means that formula_1 is an element of the set formula_2 (also read as formula_1 is a member of formula_2).

There are different ways to formulate the formal language. Some authors may choose a different set of connectives or quantifiers. For example, the logical connective NAND alone can encode the other connectives, a property known as functional completeness. This section attempts to strike a balance between simplicity and intuitiveness.

The language&#x27;s alphabet consists of:

* A countably infinite amount of variables used for representing sets
* The logical connectives formula_16, formula_17, formula_18
* The quantifier symbols formula_19, formula_20
* The equality symbol formula_21
* The set membership symbol formula_10
* Brackets ( )

With this alphabet, the recursive rules for forming well-formed formulae (wff) are as follows:

* Let formula_23 and formula_24 be metavariables for any variables. These are the two ways to build atomic formulae (the simplest wffs):
:formula_25
:formula_26

* Let formula_27 and formula_28 be metavariables for any wff, and formula_23 be a metavariable for any variable. These are valid wff constructions:
:formula_30
:formula_31
:formula_32
:formula_33
:formula_34

A well-formed formula can be thought as a syntax tree. The leaf nodes are always atomic formulae. Nodes formula_35 and formula_36 have exactly two child nodes, while nodes formula_37, formula_38 and formula_39 have exactly one. There are countably infinitely many wffs, however, each wff has a finite number of nodes.

== Axioms ==
There are many equivalent formulations of the ZFC axioms. The following particular axiom set is from . The axioms in order below are expressed in a mixture of first order logic and high-level abbreviations.
Axioms 1–8 form ZF, while the axiom 9 turns ZF into ZFC. Following , we use the equivalent well-ordering theorem in place of the axiom of choice for axiom 9.

All formulations of ZFC imply that at least one set exists. Kunen includes an axiom that directly asserts the existence of a set, although he notes that he does so only &quot;for emphasis&quot;. Its omission here can be justified in two ways. First, in the standard semantics of first-order logic in which ZFC is typically formalized, the domain of discourse must be nonempty. Hence, it is a logical theorem of first-order logic that something exists — usually expressed as the assertion that something is identical to itself, formula_40. Consequently, it is a theorem of every first-order theory that something exists. However, as noted above, because in the intended semantics of ZFC, there are only sets, the interpretation of this logical theorem in the context of ZFC is that some &quot;set&quot; exists. Hence, there is no need for a separate axiom asserting that a set exists. Second, however, even if ZFC is formulated in so-called free logic, in which it is not provable from logic alone that something exists, the axiom of infinity asserts that an &quot;infinite&quot; set exists. This implies that &quot;a&quot; set exists, and so, once again, it is superfluous to include an axiom asserting as much.

=== Axiom of extensionality ===
Two sets are equal (are the same set) if they have the same elements.

formula_41

The converse of this axiom follows from the substitution property of equality. ZFC is constructed in first-order logic. Some formulations of first-order logic include identity; others do not. If the variety of first-order logic in which one is constructing set theory does not include equality &quot;formula_21&quot;, formula_25 may be defined as an abbreviation for the following formula: formula_44

In this case, the axiom of extensionality can be reformulated as

formula_45

which says that if formula_46 and formula_47 have the same elements, then they belong to the same sets.

=== Axiom of regularity (also called the axiom of foundation) ===
Every non-empty set formula_46 contains a member formula_47 such that formula_46 and formula_47 are disjoint sets.

formula_52
or in modern notation:
formula_53

This (along with the axioms of pairing and union) implies, for example, that no set is an element of itself and that every set has an ordinal rank.

=== Axiom schema of specification (or of separation, or of restricted comprehension) ===
Subsets are commonly constructed using set builder notation. For example, the even integers can be constructed as the subset of the integers formula_54 satisfying the congruence modulo predicate formula_55:

formula_56

In general, the subset of a set formula_57 obeying a formula formula_58 with one free variable formula_46 may be written as:

formula_60

The axiom schema of specification states that this subset always exists (it is an axiom &quot;schema&quot; because there is one axiom for each formula_61). Formally, let formula_61 be any formula in the language of ZFC with all free variables among formula_63 (formula_47 is not free in formula_61). Then:

formula_66

Note that the axiom schema of specification can only construct subsets and does not allow the construction of entities of the more general form:

formula_67

This restriction is necessary to avoid Russell&#x27;s paradox (let formula_68 then formula_69) and its variants that accompany naive set theory with unrestricted comprehension (since under this restriction formula_47 only refers to sets within&quot; formula_57 that don&#x27;t belong to themselves, and formula_72 has not&quot; been established, even though formula_73 is the case, so formula_47 stands in a separate position from which it can&#x27;t refer to or comprehend itself; therefore, in a certain sense, this axiom schema is saying that in order to build a formula_47 on the basis of a formula formula_58, we need to previously restrict the sets formula_47 will regard within a set formula_57 that leaves formula_47 outside so formula_47 can&#x27;t refer to itself; or, in other words, sets shouldn&#x27;t refer to themselves).

In some other axiomatizations of ZF, this axiom is redundant in that it follows from the axiom schema of replacement and the axiom of the empty set.

On the other hand, the axiom schema of specification can be used to prove the existence of the empty set, denoted formula_81, once at least one set is known to exist. One way to do this is to use a property formula_61 which no set has. For example, if formula_83 is any existing set, the empty set can be constructed as

formula_84

Thus, the axiom of the empty set is implied by the nine axioms presented here. The axiom of extensionality implies the empty set is unique (does not depend on formula_83). It is common to make a definitional extension that adds the symbol &quot;formula_81&quot; to the language of ZFC.

=== Axiom of pairing ===
If formula_46 and formula_47 are sets, then there exists a set which contains formula_46 and formula_47 as elements, for example if x = {1,2} and y = {2,3} then z will be 

formula_91

The axiom schema of specification must be used to reduce this to a set with exactly these two elements. The axiom of pairing is part of Z, but is redundant in ZF because it follows from the axiom schema of replacement if we are given a set with at least two elements. The existence of a set with at least two elements is assured by either the axiom of infinity, or by the and the axiom of the power set applied twice to any set.

=== Axiom of union ===
The union over the elements of a set exists. For example, the union over the elements of the set formula_92 is formula_93

The axiom of union states that for any set of sets formula_94, there is a set formula_95 containing every element that is a member of some member of formula_94:
formula_97

Although this formula doesn&#x27;t directly assert the existence of formula_98, the set formula_98 can be constructed from formula_95 in the above using the axiom schema of specification:
formula_101

=== Axiom schema of replacement ===
The axiom schema of replacement asserts that the image of a set under any definable function will also fall inside a set.

Formally, let formula_61 be any formula in the language of ZFC whose free variables are among formula_103 so that in particular formula_104 is not free in formula_61. Then:

formula_106

(The unique existential quantifier formula_107 denotes the existence of exactly one element such that it follows a given statement.)

In other words, if the relation formula_61 represents a definable function formula_109, formula_95 represents its domain, and formula_111 is a set for every formula_112 then the range of formula_109 is a subset of some set formula_104. The form stated here, in which formula_104 may be larger than strictly necessary, is sometimes called the axiom schema of collection.

=== Axiom of infinity ===


Let formula_116 abbreviate formula_117 where formula_118 is some set. (We can see that formula_119 is a valid set by applying the axiom of pairing with formula_120 so that the set is formula_119). Then there exists a set such that the empty set formula_81, defined axiomatically, is a member of and, whenever a set is a member of then formula_123 is also a member of .

formula_124

or in modern notation:
formula_125

More colloquially, there exists a set having infinitely many members. (It must be established, however, that these members are all different because if two elements are the same, the sequence will loop around in a finite cycle of sets. The axiom of regularity prevents this from happening.) The minimal set satisfying the axiom of infinity is the von Neumann ordinal which can also be thought of as the set of natural numbers formula_126

=== Axiom of power set ===
By definition, a set formula_57 is a subset of a set formula_46 if and only if every element of formula_57 is also an element of formula_46:

formula_131

The Axiom of power set states that for any set formula_46, there is a set formula_47 that contains every subset of formula_46:

formula_135

The axiom schema of specification is then used to define the power set formula_136 as the subset of such a formula_47 containing the subsets of formula_46 exactly:

formula_139

Axioms &quot;1–8&quot; define ZF. Alternative forms of these axioms are often encountered, some of which are listed in . Some ZF axiomatizations include an axiom asserting that the empty set exists. The axioms of pairing, union, replacement, and power set are often stated so that the members of the set formula_46 whose existence is being asserted are just those sets which the axiom asserts formula_46 must contain.

The following axiom is added to turn ZF into ZFC:

=== Axiom of well-ordering (choice) ===
The last axiom, commonly known as the axiom of choice, is presented here as a property about well-orders, as in .
For any set formula_142, there exists a binary relation formula_143 which well-orders formula_142. This means formula_143 is a linear order on formula_142 such that every nonempty subset of formula_142 has a least element under the order formula_143.

formula_149

Given axioms &quot;1&quot; – &quot;8&quot;, many statements are equivalent to axiom &quot;9&quot;. The most common of these goes as follows. Let formula_142 be a set whose members are all nonempty. Then there exists a function formula_109 from formula_142 to the union of the members of formula_142, called a &quot;choice function&quot;, such that for all formula_154 one has formula_155. A third version of the axiom, also equivalent, is Zorn&#x27;s lemma.

Since the existence of a choice function when formula_142 is a finite set is easily proved from axioms &quot;1–8&quot;, AC only matters for certain infinite sets. AC is characterized as nonconstructive because it asserts the existence of a choice function but says nothing about how this choice function is to be &quot;constructed&quot;.

== Motivation via the cumulative hierarchy ==

One motivation for the ZFC axioms is the cumulative hierarchy of sets introduced by John von Neumann. In this viewpoint, the universe of set theory is built up in stages, with one stage for each ordinal number. At stage 0, there are no sets yet. At each following stage, a set is added to the universe if all of its elements have been added at previous stages. Thus the empty set is added at stage 1, and the set containing the empty set is added at stage 2. The collection of all sets that are obtained in this way, over all the stages, is known as &quot;V&quot;. The sets in &quot;V&quot; can be arranged into a hierarchy by assigning to each set the first stage at which that set was added to &quot;V&quot;.

It is provable that a set is in &quot;V&quot; if and only if the set is pure and well-founded. And &quot;V&quot; satisfies all the axioms of ZFC if the class of ordinals has appropriate reflection properties. For example, suppose that a set &quot;x&quot; is added at stage α, which means that every element of &quot;x&quot; was added at a stage earlier than α. Then, every subset of &quot;x&quot; is also added at (or before) stage α, because all elements of any subset of &quot;x&quot; were also added before stage α. This means that any subset of &quot;x&quot; which the axiom of separation can construct is added at (or before) stage α, and that the powerset of &quot;x&quot; will be added at the next stage after α.

The picture of the universe of sets stratified into the cumulative hierarchy is characteristic of ZFC and related axiomatic set theories such as Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory (often called NBG) and Morse–Kelley set theory. The cumulative hierarchy is not compatible with other set theories such as New Foundations.

It is possible to change the definition of &quot;V&quot; so that at each stage, instead of adding all the subsets of the union of the previous stages, subsets are only added if they are definable in a certain sense. This results in a more &quot;narrow&quot; hierarchy, which gives the constructible universe &quot;L&quot;, which also satisfies all the axioms of ZFC, including the axiom of choice. It is independent from the ZFC axioms whether &quot;V&quot; = &quot;L&quot;. Although the structure of &quot;L&quot; is more regular and well behaved than that of &quot;V&quot;, few mathematicians argue that &quot;V&quot; = &quot;L&quot; should be added to ZFC as an additional &quot;axiom of constructibility&quot;.

== Metamathematics ==
===Virtual classes===

Proper classes (collections of mathematical objects defined by a property shared by their members which are too big to be sets) can only be treated indirectly in ZF (and thus ZFC).
An alternative to proper classes while staying within ZF and ZFC is the &quot;virtual class&quot; notational construct introduced by , where the entire construct &quot;y&quot; ∈ { &quot;x&quot; | F&quot;x&quot; } is simply defined as F&quot;y&quot;. This provides a simple notation for classes that can contain sets but need not themselves be sets, while not committing to the ontology of classes (because the notation can be syntactically converted to one that only uses sets). Quine&#x27;s approach built on the earlier approach of . Virtual classes are also used in , , and in the Metamath implementation of ZFC.

===Finite axiomatization===
The axiom schemata of replacement and separation each contain infinitely many instances. included a result first proved in his 1957 Ph.D. thesis: if ZFC is consistent, it is impossible to axiomatize ZFC using only finitely many axioms. On the other hand, von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory (NBG) can be finitely axiomatized. The ontology of NBG includes proper classes as well as sets; a set is any class that can be a member of another class. NBG and ZFC are equivalent set theories in the sense that any theorem not mentioning classes and provable in one theory can be proved in the other.

===Consistency===
Gödel&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem says that a recursively axiomatizable system that can interpret Robinson arithmetic can prove its own consistency only if it is inconsistent. Moreover, Robinson arithmetic can be interpreted in general set theory, a small fragment of ZFC. Hence the consistency of ZFC cannot be proved within ZFC itself (unless it is actually inconsistent). Thus, to the extent that ZFC is identified with ordinary mathematics, the consistency of ZFC cannot be demonstrated in ordinary mathematics. The consistency of ZFC does follow from the existence of a weakly inaccessible cardinal, which is unprovable in ZFC if ZFC is consistent. Nevertheless, it is deemed unlikely that ZFC harbors an unsuspected contradiction; it is widely believed that if ZFC were inconsistent, that fact would have been uncovered by now. This much is certain — ZFC is immune to the classic paradoxes of naive set theory: Russell&#x27;s paradox, the Burali-Forti paradox, and Cantor&#x27;s paradox.

 studied a subtheory of ZFC consisting of the axioms of extensionality, union, powerset, replacement, and choice. Using models, they proved this subtheory consistent, and proved that each of the axioms of extensionality, replacement, and power set is independent of the four remaining axioms of this subtheory. If this subtheory is augmented with the axiom of infinity, each of the axioms of union, choice, and infinity is independent of the five remaining axioms. Because there are non-well-founded models that satisfy each axiom of ZFC except the axiom of regularity, that axiom is independent of the other ZFC axioms.

If consistent, ZFC cannot prove the existence of the inaccessible cardinals that category theory requires. Huge sets of this nature are possible if ZF is augmented with Tarski&#x27;s axiom. Assuming that axiom turns the axioms of infinity, power set, and choice (&quot;7&quot; – &quot;9&quot; above) into theorems.

=== Independence ===
Many important statements are independent of ZFC. The independence is usually proved by forcing, whereby it is shown that every countable transitive model of ZFC (sometimes augmented with large cardinal axioms) can be expanded to satisfy the statement in question. A different expansion is then shown to satisfy the negation of the statement. An independence proof by forcing automatically proves independence from arithmetical statements, other concrete statements, and large cardinal axioms. Some statements independent of ZFC can be proven to hold in particular inner models, such as in the constructible universe. However, some statements that are true about constructible sets are not consistent with hypothesized large cardinal axioms.

Forcing proves that the following statements are independent of ZFC:

* Axiom of constructibility (V=L) (which is also not a ZFC axiom)
* Continuum hypothesis
* Diamond principle
* Martin&#x27;s axiom (which is not a ZFC axiom)
* Suslin hypothesis

Remarks:

* The consistency of V=L is provable by inner models but not forcing: every model of ZF can be trimmed to become a model of ZFC + V=L.
* The diamond principle implies the continuum hypothesis and the negation of the Suslin hypothesis.
* Martin&#x27;s axiom plus the negation of the continuum hypothesis implies the Suslin hypothesis.
* The constructible universe satisfies the generalized continuum hypothesis, the diamond principle, Martin&#x27;s axiom and the Kurepa hypothesis.
* The failure of the Kurepa hypothesis is equiconsistent with the existence of a strongly inaccessible cardinal.

A variation on the method of forcing can also be used to demonstrate the consistency and unprovability of the axiom of choice, i.e., that the axiom of choice is independent of ZF. The consistency of choice can be (relatively) easily verified by proving that the inner model L satisfies choice. (Thus every model of ZF contains a submodel of ZFC, so that Con(ZF) implies Con(ZFC).) Since forcing preserves choice, we cannot directly produce a model contradicting choice from a model satisfying choice. However, we can use forcing to create a model which contains a suitable submodel, namely one satisfying ZF but not C.

Another method of proving independence results, one owing nothing to forcing, is based on Gödel&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem. This approach employs the statement whose independence is being examined, to prove the existence of a set model of ZFC, in which case Con(ZFC) is true. Since ZFC satisfies the conditions of Gödel&#x27;s second theorem, the consistency of ZFC is unprovable in ZFC (provided that ZFC is, in fact, consistent). Hence no statement allowing such a proof can be proved in ZFC. This method can prove that the existence of large cardinals is not provable in ZFC, but cannot prove that assuming such cardinals, given ZFC, is free of contradiction.

===Proposed additions===
The project to unify set theorists behind additional axioms to resolve the continuum hypothesis or other meta-mathematical ambiguities is sometimes known as &quot;Gödel&#x27;s program&quot;. Mathematicians currently debate which axioms are the most plausible or &quot;self-evident&quot;, which axioms are the most useful in various domains, and about to what degree usefulness should be traded off with plausibility; some &quot;multiverse&quot; set theorists argue that usefulness should be the sole ultimate criterion in which axioms to customarily adopt. One school of thought leans on expanding the &quot;iterative&quot; concept of a set to produce a set-theoretic universe with an interesting and complex but reasonably tractable structure by adopting forcing axioms; another school advocates for a tidier, less cluttered universe, perhaps focused on a &quot;core&quot; inner model.

== Criticisms ==
ZFC has been criticized both for being excessively strong and for being excessively weak, as well as for its failure to capture objects such as proper classes and the universal set.

Many mathematical theorems can be proven in much weaker systems than ZFC, such as Peano arithmetic and second-order arithmetic (as explored by the program of reverse mathematics). Saunders Mac Lane and Solomon Feferman have both made this point. Some of &quot;mainstream mathematics&quot; (mathematics not directly connected with axiomatic set theory) is beyond Peano arithmetic and second-order arithmetic, but still, all such mathematics can be carried out in ZC (Zermelo set theory with choice), another theory weaker than ZFC. Much of the power of ZFC, including the axiom of regularity and the axiom schema of replacement, is included primarily to facilitate the study of the set theory itself.

On the other hand, among axiomatic set theories, ZFC is comparatively weak. Unlike New Foundations, ZFC does not admit the existence of a universal set. Hence the universe of sets under ZFC is not closed under the elementary operations of the algebra of sets. Unlike von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory (NBG) and Morse–Kelley set theory (MK), ZFC does not admit the existence of proper classes. A further comparative weakness of ZFC is that the axiom of choice included in ZFC is weaker than the axiom of global choice included in NBG and MK.

There are numerous mathematical statements independent of ZFC. These include the continuum hypothesis, the Whitehead problem, and the normal Moore space conjecture. Some of these conjectures are provable with the addition of axioms such as Martin&#x27;s axiom or large cardinal axioms to ZFC. Some others are decided in ZF+AD where AD is the axiom of determinacy, a strong supposition incompatible with choice. One attraction of large cardinal axioms is that they enable many results from ZF+AD to be established in ZFC adjoined by some large cardinal axiom. The Mizar system and metamath have adopted Tarski–Grothendieck set theory, an extension of ZFC, so that proofs involving Grothendieck universes (encountered in category theory and algebraic geometry) can be formalized.

<text>Howard is a village in Brown and Outagamie counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 19,950 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Green Bay metropolitan area.

The village is mostly within Brown County; a small portion extends west into Outagamie County. It is bordered to the east by Green Bay, a sub-basin of Lake Michigan. Prior to being incorporated as the Village of Howard, the Town of Howard was commonly referred to as &quot;Duck Creek&quot; because of the Duck Creek waterway winding its way through the village.

==History==
The Green Bay area was first explored by Europeans in 1634, when Jean Nicolet, a French voyager, arrived in the area. The Town of Howard was established in 1835 and slowly developed along Duck Creek as a center for mail delivery, farming, quarrying and lumbering. By 1848, there were three major railroads that convergen in Howard, the Chicago &amp; North Western (C&amp;NW), the SOO Line (SOO) And the Milwaukee Road (MILW). It was named for Brigadier General Benjamin Howard, an officer in the War of 1812.

By 1856, a school was operating and the Town of Howard became known for its Duck Creek stone quarries; of which there were four. The last of the quarries were shut down in 2002. 

By 1959, the population had grown and the Town of Howard became incorporated as the Village of Howard. Residential, commercial and industrial growth has continued steadily since that time, creating a suburban community on Green Bay&#x27;s northwest side. Today the only railroads that reach Green Bay are the Escanaba &amp; Lake Superior (E&amp;LS) and the Canadian National (CN). Two of the four original railroad yards have been removed or abandoned. The Fox River Valley (FRVR) Railroad yard, formerly the Green Bay &amp; Western (GB&amp;W), has been turned into a park and apartments. The Milwaukee Road (MILW) yard has had its tracks removed, but is still owned by Canadian National. It is planned to be converted to apartments. There are several different parks in Howard, that are open to the public. The Duck Creek Quarry Park is open to the public all year round. There are several nature parks open to recreation and sporting events; all but one are open year round.

<text>Menasha () is a city in Winnebago and Calumet counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 18,268 at the 2020 census. Of this, 15,144 were in Winnebago County, and 2,209 were in Calumet County. The city&#x27;s name comes from the Winnebago word meaning &quot;thorn&quot; or &quot;island&quot;. In the Menominee language, it is known as &quot;Menāēhsaeh&quot;, meaning &quot;little island&quot;. It is part of the Fox Cities region of Wisconsin. Doty Island is located partially in Menasha, which it shares with Neenah.

Menasha&#x27;s location on the Fox River and Lake Winnebago led to its rich history, dating back to the inhabitation by Native American tribes for centuries. European settlement in the 1800s led to the development of Menasha as a transportation hub and later a center for paper production and wooden ware products. Today, Menasha is home to the Barlow Planetarium and the Weis Earth Science Museum on the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh, Fox Cities Campus.

==History==
Ancestors of the Ho-Chunk occupied what is currently Menasha. In the 1600s, the Meskwaki established a village just north of Menasha. A surprise attack by French soldiers and traders resulted in the deaths of nearly all Meskwaki residing in the area. The bodies were subsequently interred in a large mound, known as Butte des Morts (&quot;Hill of the Dead&quot;), which served as a prominent landmark until its destruction by the Chicago and North Western Railway in 1863.

In 1836, the land was ceded to the United States in the Treaty of the Cedars. This opened up land for public sale, and territorial governor James Duane Doty was one of the first investors in the land. In 1848, Doty and his associates, including Curtis Reed, formed the town of Menasha on the channel north of Doty Island. In 1849, Reed and Doty were successful in convincing the United States government to place the navigational channel of the Fox-Wisconsin waterway through the north channel in Menasha. In 1854 Menasha approved $150,000 in bonding to bring the Manitowoc &amp; Mississippi Railroad in with the intent of establishing Menasha as the principal transportation axis in Wisconsin. Menasha was incorporated as a city in 1874, and at that point was considered to be a transportation hub.

The early 1900s saw a shift to industrial production of general and specialized papers. Menasha was home to many paper mills including the George A. Whiting Paper Company Mill, the John Strange Paper Mill, Island Paper Company, and Gilbert Paper Company, to name a few. Menasha was also home to the George Banta Publishing Company which published textbooks, military manuals, yearbooks, and magazines.

Menasha Corporation also called Menasha home. It was established in 1849 by Elisha D. Smith as Menasha Wooden Ware. It produced wooden containers like butter tubs and barrels and eventually became the world&#x27;s largest wooden ware products manufacturer. After wooden ware products fell out of use in the early 1900s, Menasha Wooden Ware shifted to the corrugated packaging business, changing its name to Menasha Corporation.

<doc id="152241" wikidata="Q1570163" url="?curid=152241" title="Waupun, Wisconsin">
<text>Waupun is a city in Dodge and Fond du Lac counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 11,344 at the 2020 census. Of this, 7,795 were in Dodge County, and 3,549 were in Fond du Lac County. In Fond du Lac County, the Town of Waupun abuts the city of Waupun.

==History==

===Founding===
Waupun was founded in 1839 by Seymour Wilcox, the first settler along the Rock River in what was then deciduous forested land. Wilcox chose the land on recommendation of John Bannister, the first surveyor of Fond du Lac County, who reported to the government office in Green Bay that &quot;the Rock River Valley was the most beautiful and fertile he had ever seen.&quot; Wilcox surveyed the land himself in late fall of 1838, returning to Green Bay for the winter. In February 1839 he returned to the plot he laid out accompanied by two men, John N. Ackerman and Hiram Walker, who were interested in the powerful river and fertile land. They quickly nailed together a shanty to four bur oaks and began building a suitable cabin for the Wilcox homestead. Leaving Ackerman and Walker to finish, Wilcox returned to Green Bay to bring his family to their new home. They reached Waupun on March 20, 1839.

Waupun comes from the Ojibwe word &quot;Waubun&quot; which means &quot;the east,&quot; &quot;the morning,&quot; &quot;the twilight of dawn&quot; and &quot;dawn of day.&quot; Waupun was originally supposed to be named &quot;Waubun&quot; but the state of Wisconsin made a spelling error, and Waupun never bothered to change it. An adjacent town with the same name was changed along with the village.

===Early history===
The first town election took place in 1842 at the Wilcox home; eleven votes were cast. When the village charter was ratified 15 years later, 323 votes were cast in the first election. Because of the steady growth of the village, a city charter was granted on March 15, 1878. John N. Ackerman was elected as the first city mayor.

In 1851, the city was chosen for the State Penitentiary, owing to the abundance of limestone for construction. The main building, constructed in 1854, is still in use.

The Milwaukee &amp; Horicon Railroad reached Waupun in 1856. It was sold to the Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway June 23, 1863. This company eventually became the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, known as &quot;The Milwaukee Road&quot;, which served Waupun until 1980, when the line was sold to the state of Wisconsin and became the Wisconsin &amp; Southern Railroad.

The Waupun Library Association was established in 1858 through the efforts of William Euen and Edwin Hillyer. Hillyer ran the library out of his insurance office for 37 years without pay. In 1895, the city took ownership of the library, appointing a new library board which included Edwin Hillyer and Lucius D. Hinkley. When the city took ownership, it was soon moved to a side room in the Whiting Theater, which became the Davison Theater while still housing the library. In 1900, through the fundraising efforts of the Waupun Women&#x27;s Club, it became a free public library. The Waupun Carnegie Library, now Waupun Heritage Museum, was built in 1904 with a $10,000 grant from Andrew Carnegie. A new library building was built in 1968 and is the current Waupun Public Library.

The territorial census in 1847 showed the Town of Waupun to have a population of 956. The 1875 Wisconsin census showed the village of Waupun to have a population of 1,867.

===Second World War===
In 1945 Waupun, was selected for the site of a German POW camp. Despite public opposition, the camp was constructed next to the canning factory, south of Doty Street. The prisoners were brought to Wisconsin to relieve deficits of manpower in the area factories and farms. There were about 200 POWs at the Waupun camp who were assigned to work either for Canned Foods Inc. in Waupun or Stokely Foods in Brandon, Wisconsin.

Waupun lies near the edge of the Horicon Marsh, the largest cattail marsh in the United States, and is the principal access point to wildlife viewing for the Horicon Wildlife Refuges.

The Fond du Lac County Park, on the edge of Waupun, has preserved a remnant stand of old-growth southern mesic forest, which once covered over of Southern Wisconsin. The Fond du Lac County Park also provides camping.

<text>Whitewater is a city located in Walworth and Jefferson counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. Located near the southern portion of the Kettle Moraine State Forest, Whitewater is the home of the University of Wisconsin–Whitewater. As of the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population was 14,889.

==History==
Whitewater was founded at the confluence of Whitewater Creek and Spring Brook, and named for the white sand in their beds. A gristmill was built on Whitewater creek, the resulting pond now called Cravath Lake. The town grew quickly when the first railroad line in Wisconsin passed through in 1853, but struggled when the two largest employers left town.

Whitewater was originally founded entirely by settlers who arrived there from New England. These people were &quot;Yankees&quot;, that is to say they were descended from the English Puritans who settled New England in the 1600s. They were part of a wave of New England farmers who headed west into what was then the wilds of the Northwest Territory during the early 1800s. Most of them arrived as a result of the completion of the Erie Canal. When they arrived in what is now Whitewater, then nothing but dense virgin forest and wild prairie, the New Englanders laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes. They brought with them many of their Yankee New England values, such as staunch support for abolitionism and a passion for education, establishing many schools as well. They were mostly members of the Congregationalist Church though some were Episcopalian. Due to the second Great Awakening some of them had converted to Methodism before moving to what is now Whitewater. Whitewater, like much of Wisconsin, would be culturally very continuous with early New England culture for most of its early history.

Unlike much of Wisconsin, Walworth County was notable for not being heavily German-American, Whitewater had almost no German-Americans at a time when the state as a whole was receiving many. Whitewater in particular and Walworth County in general were also heavily anti-slavery, and the abolitionist movement was popular amongst the New England descended portion of the population in the area.

In the late 1800s immigrant families primarily from Belgium, Canada, Russia and Serbia settled in Whitewater, as well as smaller amounts of immigrants from France and England.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. Most of the city lies in Walworth County.

===Climate===
==Demographics==

In recent years, Whitewater has seen the arrival of around 800-1000 immigrants, mostly from Nicaragua. In a 2024 letter to the Biden administration, the city’s police chief and city manager requested more federal resources to assist in handling the influx.

<doc id="152256" wikidata="Q174193" url="?curid=152256" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland">
<text>The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was the union of the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland into one sovereign state, established by the Acts of Union in 1801. It continued in this form for over a century. In 1927, it evolved into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, after the Irish Free State gained a degree of independence in 1922.

The United Kingdom, from its islands off the coast of Europe, financed the coalition that defeated France during the Napoleonic Wars, and further developed its dominant Royal Navy enabling the British Empire to become the foremost world power for the next century. For nearly a century from the final defeat of Napoleon following the Battle of Waterloo to the outbreak of World War I, Britain was almost continuously at peace with Great Powers. The most notable exception was the Crimean War with the Russian Empire, in which actual hostilities were relatively limited. However, the United Kingdom did engage in extensive wars in Africa and Asia, such as the Opium Wars with the Qing dynasty, to extend its overseas territorial holdings and influence.

Britain&#x27;s empire was expanded into most parts of Africa and much of South Asia. The Colonial Office and India Office ruled through a small number of administrators who managed the units of the empire locally, while local institutions began to develop. British India, by far the most important overseas possession, saw a short-lived revolt in 1857. In overseas policy, the central policy was free trade, which enabled British financiers and merchants to operate successfully in many otherwise independent countries, as in South America. Beginning in earnest in the second half of the nineteenth century, the Imperial government granted increasing levels of autonomy to locally elected governments in colonies where white settlers had become demographically or politically dominant, with this process eventually resulting in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Newfoundland and South Africa becoming self-governing dominions. While these dominions remained part of the British Empire, in practice, these governments were permitted greater management of their own internal affairs, with Britain remaining primarily responsible for their foreign and trade policies.

Rapid industrialisation that began in the decades prior to the state&#x27;s formation continued up until the mid-19th century. The Great Irish Famine, exacerbated by government inaction in the mid-19th century, led to demographic collapse in much of Ireland and increased calls for Irish land reform. The 19th century was an era of rapid economic modernisation and growth of industry, trade and finance, in which Britain largely dominated the world economy. Outward migration was heavy to the principal British overseas possessions and to the United States. 

With respect to other powers, the British remained non-aligned until the early 20th century when the growing naval power of the German Empire increasingly came to be seen as an existential threat to the British Empire. In response, London began to cooperate with Japan, France and Russia, and moved closer to the United States. Although not formally allied with any of these powers, by 1914 British policy had all but committed to declaring war on Germany if the latter attacked France. This was realized in August 1914 when Germany invaded France via Belgium, whose neutrality had been guaranteed by London. The ensuing First World War eventually pitted the Allied and Associated Powers including the British Empire, France, Russia, Italy and the U.S. against the Central Powers of Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. The deadliest conflict in human history up to that point, the war ended in an Allied victory in November 1918 but inflicted a massive cost to British manpower, materiel and treasure.

Growing desire for Irish self-governance led to the Irish War of Independence almost immediately after the conclusion of World War I, which resulted in British recognition of the Irish Free State in 1922. Although the Free State was explicitly governed under dominion status and thus was not a fully independent polity, as a dominion it was no longer considered to be part of the United Kingdom and ceased to be represented in the Westminster Parliament. Six northeastern counties in Ireland, which since 1920 were being governed under a much more limited form of home rule, opted-out of joining the Free State and remained part of the Union under this limited form of self-government. In light of these changes, the British state was renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on 12 April 1927 with the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act. The modern-day United Kingdom is the same state, that is to say a direct continuation of what remained after the Irish Free State&#x27;s secession, as opposed to being an entirely new successor state.

==1801 to 1820==
===Union of Great Britain and Ireland===

A brief period of limited independence for the Kingdom of Ireland came to an end following the Irish Rebellion of 1798, which occurred during the British war with revolutionary France. The Kingdom of Great Britain&#x27;s fear of an independent Ireland siding against them with Revolutionary France resulted in the decision to unite the two countries. This was brought about by legislation in the parliaments of both kingdoms and came into effect on 1 January 1801. The Irish had been led to believe by the British that their loss of legislative independence would be compensated with Catholic emancipation, that is, by the removal of civil disabilities placed upon Roman Catholics in both Great Britain and Ireland. Despite personal sympathy for Roman Catholics, King George III believed that agreeing to Catholic Emancipation would violate his Coronation Oath to uphold the Protestant faith, and his lack of support for the initiative led the Prime Minister, William Pitt the Younger, to resign.

===Napoleonic Wars===

During the War of the Second Coalition (1799–1801), Britain occupied most of the French and Dutch overseas possessions, the Netherlands having become a satellite state of France in 1796, but tropical diseases claimed the lives of over 40,000 troops. When the Treaty of Amiens ended the war, Britain agreed to return most of the territories it had seized. The peace settlement was in effect only a ceasefire, and Napoleon continued to provoke the British by attempting a trade embargo on the country and by occupying the city of Hanover, capital of the Electorate, a German-speaking duchy of the Holy Roman Empire which was in a personal union with the United Kingdom. In May 1803, war was declared again. Napoleon&#x27;s plans to invade Great Britain failed, chiefly due to the inferiority of his navy, and in 1805 a Royal Navy fleet led by Nelson decisively defeated the French Imperial Navy and Royal Spanish Navy at Trafalgar, which was the last significant naval action of the Napoleonic Wars.

In 1806, Napoleon issued the series of Berlin Decrees, which brought into effect the Continental System. This policy aimed to eliminate the threat from the British by closing French-controlled territory to foreign trade. The British Army remained a minimal threat to France; it maintained a standing strength of just 220,000 men at the height of the Napoleonic Wars, whereas the French Imperial Army exceeded a million men—in addition to the armies of numerous allies and several hundred thousand national guardsmen that Napoleon could draft into the French armies when they were needed. Although the Royal Navy effectively disrupted France&#x27;s extra-continental trade—both by seizing and threatening French shipping and by seizing French colonial possessions—it could do nothing about France&#x27;s trade with the major continental economies and posed little threat to French territory in Europe. France&#x27;s population and agricultural capacity far outstripped that of the British Isles, but it was smaller in terms of industry, finance, mercantile marine and naval strength.

Napoleon expected that cutting Britain off from Continental Europe would end its economic hegemony. On the contrary Britain possessed the greatest industrial capacity in the world, and its mastery of the seas allowed it to build up considerable economic strength through trade to its possessions and the United States. The Spanish uprising in 1808 at last permitted Britain to gain a foothold on the Continent. The Duke of Wellington gradually pushed the French out of Spain, and in early 1814, as Napoleon was being driven back in the east by the Royal Prussian Army, the Imperial Austrian Army, and the Imperial Russian Army, Wellington invaded southern France. After Napoleon&#x27;s surrender and exile to the Principality of Elba, peace appeared to have returned. Napoleon suddenly reappeared in 1815. The Allies united and the armies of Wellington and Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher defeated Napoleon once and for all at the Battle of Waterloo.

===War of 1812 with the United States===
To defeat France, Britain put heavy pressure on the United States, seizing merchant ships suspected of trading with France, and impressing sailors (conscription) born in Britain, regardless of their claimed American citizenship. British government agents armed Indigenous American tribes in Canada that were raiding American settlements on the frontier. The Americans felt humiliated and demanded war to restore their honour, despite their complete unpreparedness. The War of 1812 was a minor sideshow to the British, but the American army performed very poorly, and was unable to successfully attack Canada. In 1813, the Americans took control of Lake Erie and thereby of western Ontario, knocking most of the Indian tribes out of the war. When Napoleon surrendered for the first time in 1814, three separate forces were sent to attack the Americans in upstate New York, along the Maryland coast (burning Washington but getting repulsed at Baltimore), and up the Mississippi River to a massive defeat at the Battle of New Orleans. Each operation proved a failure with the British commanding generals killed or in disgrace. The war was a stalemate without purpose. A negotiated peace was reached at the end of 1814 that restored the prewar boundaries. British Canada celebrated its deliverance from American rule, Americans celebrated victory in a &quot;second war of independence,&quot; and Britain celebrated its defeat of Napoleon. The treaty opened up two centuries of peace and open borders.

===Postwar reaction: 1815–1822===
Britain emerged from the Napoleonic Wars a very different country than it had been in 1793. As the Industrial Revolution progressed, society changed, becoming more urban. The postwar period saw an economic slump, and poor harvests and inflation caused widespread social unrest. British leadership was intensely conservative, ever watchful of signs of revolutionary activity of the sort that had so deeply affected France. Historians have found very few signs, noting that social movements such as Methodism strongly encouraged conservative support for the political and social status quo.

The major constitutional changes included a reform of Parliament, and a sharp decline in the power and prestige of the monarchy. The Prince regent, on becoming King George IV in 1820 asked Parliament to divorce his wife Queen Caroline of Brunswick so that he could marry his favourite lover. Public and elite opinion strongly favoured the Queen and ridiculed the king. The fiasco helped ruin the prestige of the monarchy and it recovered a fraction of the power wielded by King George III in his saner days. Historian Eugene Black says:
:the damage was irrevocable. The sovereign was increasingly a symbolic contradiction in his own age. Through madness, stupidity, and immorality Victoria&#x27;s three predecessors lowered the stock of monarchy. Only thirty years of the narrow domestic virtues of Queen Victoria finally retrieved the symbolic luster of the sovereign.

==== Ultra Tories: Peterloo Massacre and the Six Acts ====

The Ultra-Tories were the leaders of reaction and seemed to dominate the Tory Party, which controlled the government. Every untoward event seemed to point to a conspiracy on the left which necessitated more repression to head off another terror such as happened in the French Revolution in 1793. Historians find that the violent radical element was small and weak; there were a handful of small conspiracies involving men with few followers and careless security; they were quickly suppressed. Nevertheless, techniques of repression included the suspension of Habeas Corpus in 1817 (allowing the government to arrest and hold suspects without cause or trial). Sidmouth&#x27;s Gagging Acts of 1817 heavily muzzled the opposition newspapers; the reformers switched to pamphlets and sold 50,000 a week.
In industrial districts in 1819, factory workers demanded better wages, and demonstrated. The most important event was the Peterloo Massacre in Manchester, on 16 August 1819, when a local militia unit composed of landowners charged into an orderly crowd of 60,000 which had gathered to demand the reform of parliamentary representation. The crowd panicked and eleven died and hundreds were injured. The government saw the event as an opening battle against revolutionaries. In reaction Lord Liverpool&#x27;s government passed the &quot;Six Acts&quot; in 1819. They prohibited drills and military exercises; facilitated warrants for the search for weapons; outlawed public meetings of more than 50 people, including meetings to organise petitions; put heavy penalties on blasphemous and seditious publications; imposing a fourpenny stamp act on many pamphlets to cut down the flow on news and criticism. Offenders could be harshly punished including exile in Australia. In practice the laws were designed to deter troublemakers and reassure conservatives; they were not often used.

One historian would write: &quot;Peterloo was a blunder; it was hardly a massacre.&quot; It was a serious mistake by local authorities who did not understand what was happening. Nevertheless, it had a major impact on British opinion at the time and on history ever since as a symbol of officialdom brutally suppressing a peaceful demonstration thinking mistakenly that it was the start of an insurrection.

The Ultra-Tories peaked in strength about 1819–1822 then lost ground inside the Tory Party. They were defeated in important breakthroughs that took place in the late 1820s in terms of tolerating first dissenting Protestants. An even more decisive blow was the unexpected repeal of the many restrictions on Catholics, after widespread organised protest by the Catholic Association in Ireland under Daniel O&#x27;Connell, with support from Catholics in England. Robert Peel was alarmed at the strength of the Catholic Association, warning in 1824, &quot;We cannot tamely sit by while the danger is hourly increasing, while a power co-ordinate with that of the Government is rising by its side, nay, daily counteracting its views.&quot; The Duke of Wellington, Britain&#x27;s most famous war hero, told Peel, &quot;If we cannot get rid of the Catholic Association, we must look to Civil War in Ireland sooner or later.&quot; Peel and Wellington agreed that to stop the momentum of the Catholic Association it was necessary to pass Catholic emancipation, which gave Catholics the vote and the right to sit in Parliament. That happened in 1829 using Whig support. Passage demonstrated that the veto power long held by the ultra-Tories no longer was operational, and significant reforms were now possible across the board. The stage was set for the Age of Reform.

==Age of Reform: 1820–1837==

The era of reform came in a time of peace, guaranteed in considerable part by the overwhelming power of the Royal Navy. Britain engaged in only one serious war between 1815 and 1914, the Crimean War against the Russian Empire in the 1850s. That war was strictly limited in terms of scope and impact. The major result was the realisation that military medical services needed urgent reform, as advocated by the nursing leader Florence Nightingale. British diplomats, led by Lord Palmerston, promoted British nationalism, opposed reactionary regimes on the continent, helped the Spanish colonies to free themselves and worked to shut down the international slave trade.

It was a time of prosperity, population growth and better health, except in Ireland where over one million deaths were caused by the Great Famine when the potato crop failed in the 1840s. The Government did little to help the starving poor in Ireland. Along with the one million deaths, another one million would emigrate in a few short years, mostly to Britain and to the United States. The trend of emigration would continue in Ireland for decades and Ireland&#x27;s population has never recovered to its pre-famine levels. The Irish language was almost wiped out. The failure of the British government to respond to the crisis in the eyes of the Irish people would lead to a growth in resentment of Britain and a rise in Irish nationalism. The famine is remembered in Ireland to this day as oppression by the British Empire.

Industrial Revolution accelerated, with textile mills joined by iron and steel, coal mining, railroads and shipbuilding. The second British Empire, founded after the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in the American Revolutionary War of the 1770s, was dramatically expanded in India, other parts of Asia, and Africa. There was little friction with other colonial powers until the 1890s. British foreign policy avoided entangling alliances.

Britain from the 1820s to the 1860s experienced a turbulent and exciting &quot;age of reform&quot;. The century started with 15 years of war against France, ending in Wellington&#x27;s triumph against Napoleon in 1815 at Waterloo. There followed 15 difficult years, in which the Tory Party, representing a small, rich landed aristocracy that was fearful of a popular revolution along the French model, employed severe repression. In the mid-1820s, however, as popular unrest increased, the government made a series of dramatic changes. The more liberal among the Tories rejected the ultraconservative &quot;Ultra Tory&quot; faction. The party split, key leaders switched sides, the Tories lost power, and the more liberally minded opposition Whigs took over. The Tory coalition fell apart, and it was reassembled under the banner of the Conservative Party. Numerous Tories, such as Lord Palmerston, switched over to the Whig opposition, and it became the Liberal Party.
Constitutionally, the 1830s marks a watershed: the end of Crown control over the cabinet. King William IV in 1834 was obliged to accept a Prime Minister who had a majority in Parliament, and the Crown ever since has gone along with the majority.

The great Reform Act 1832 came at a time of intense public and elite anxiety and broke the logjam. The parliamentary system, based on a very small electorate and large numbers of seats that were tightly controlled by a small elite, was radically reformed. For the first time the growing industrial cities had representation in Parliament. This opened the way for another decade of reform that culminated in the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846ending the tariff on imported grain that kept prices high for the landed aristocracy. Repeal was heavily promoted by the Anti-Corn Law League, grass roots activists led by Richard Cobden and based in the industrial cities; they demanded cheap food. There were a series of reforms of the electoral laws, expanding the number of male voters and reducing the level of corruption. The reactionary Tory element was closely linked to the Church of England, and expressed its strong hostility toward Catholics and nonconformist Protestants by restricting their political and civil rights. The Catholic started to organise in Ireland, threatening instability or even civil war, and the moderates in Parliament emancipated them. The Nonconformists were similarly freed from their restrictions. In addition to reforms at the Parliamentary level, there was a reorganisation of the governmental system in the rapidly growing cities, putting a premium on modernisation and expertise, and large electorates as opposed to small ruling cliques. A rapidly growing middle class, as well as active intellectuals, broaden the scope of reform to include humanitarian activities such as a new poor law and factory laws to protect women and children workers.

===Protestant Nonconformists===

In the 1790–1815 period there was an improvement in morals caused by the religious efforts by evangelicals inside the Church of England, and Dissenters or Nonconformist Protestants as people:
Nonconformists, including Presbyterians, Congregationalists, the Baptists and the rapidly-growing Methodist denomination, as well as Quakers, Unitarians and smaller groups. They were all outside the established Church of England (except in Scotland, where the established Church of Scotland was Presbyterian), They proclaimed a devotion to hard work, temperance, frugality and upward mobility, with which historians today largely agree. A major Unitarian magazine, the &quot;Christian Monthly Repository&quot; asserted in 1827:

The Nonconformists suffered under a series of disabilities, some of which were symbolic and others were painful, and they were all deliberately imposed to weaken the dissenting challenge to Anglican orthodoxy. The Nonconformists allied with the Whigs to demand for civil and religious equality. Grievances included a 1753 law that to be legally recognised marriage had to take place in the Anglican parish church. The Anglican parish register was the only legally accepted birth documentation. The Anglican parish controlled the only religious burial grounds. The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge had to reject non-Anglican applicants. At the local level, everyone who lived in the boundaries of an Anglican church was required to pay taxes to support the parish. The Test and Corporation laws required all national and local government officials had to attend Anglican church services. In February 1828, Whig leader Lord John Russell, presented petitions assembled by the main Nonconformist pressure group, the United Committee, which represented Congregationalist, Baptists and Unitarians. Their demand was the immediate repeal of the hated laws. Wellington and Peel originally were opposed, but then tried to compromise. They finally gave, splitting the Tory party, and signaling that the once unstoppable power of the Anglican establishment was now unexpectedly fragile and vulnerable to challenge.

===Foreign policy===

Three men shaped British foreign policy from 1810 to 1860, with only a few interruptions, Viscount Castlereagh (especially 1812–1822). George Canning (especially 1807–1829) and Viscount Palmerston (especially 1830–1865). For a complete list, see Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.

The coalition that defeated Napoleon was financed by Britain, and held together at the Congress of Vienna in 1814–1815. It successfully broke Napoleon&#x27;s comeback attempt in 1815. Castlereagh played a central role at Vienna, along with Austrian leader Klemens von Metternich. While many Europeans wanted to punish France heavily, Castlereagh insisted on a mild peace, with the Kingdom of France to pay 700 million livre in indemnities and lose the territory seized after 1791. He realised that harsher terms would lead to a dangerous reaction in France, and now that the conservative old-fashioned Bourbons were back in power, they were no longer a threat to attempt to conquer all of Europe. Indeed, Castlereagh emphasised the need for a &quot;balance of power&quot;, whereby no nation would be powerful enough to threaten the conquest of Europe the way Napoleon had. Vienna ushered in a century of peace, with no great wars and few important localised ones until the Crimean War (1853–1856). Prussia, Austria, and Russia, as absolute monarchies, tried to suppress liberalism wherever it might occur. Britain first took a Reactionary position at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, but relented and broke ranks with the absolute monarchies by 1820. Britain intervened in Portugal in 1826 to defend a constitutional government there and recognising the independence of Spain&#x27;s American colonies after their wars of independence in 1824. British merchants and financiers and, later, railway builders, played major roles in the economies of most Latin American nations.

===Age of Reform===
====Main achievements====
In the 1825 to 1867 era, widespread public demonstrations, some of them violent, escalated to demand reform. The ruling Tories were dead set against anything smacking of democracy or popular rule and favoured severe punishment of demonstrators, as exemplified by the Peterloo Massacre in Manchester in 1819. The Tory ranks were cracking, however, especially when Robert Peel (1788–1830) broke away on several critical issues. Nevertheless, the Whig party gets most of the credit. The middle classes, often led by nonconformist Protestants, turned against the Tories and scored the greatest gains. For example, symbolic restrictions on nonconformists called the Test Acts were abolished in 1828. Much more controversial was the repeal of severe discrimination against Roman Catholics after the Irish Catholics organised, and threatened rebellion, forcing major concessions in 1829.

Financial reform, led by William Huskisson and Peel, rationalised the tariff system, and culminated in the great repeal of the tariffs on imported grain in 1846, much to the dismay of grain farmers. The 1846 repeal of the Corn Laws established free trade as the basic principle by which British merchants came to dominate the globe, and brought cheap food to British workers. A depoliticised civil service based on merit replaced patronage policies rewarding jobs for partisan efforts. Efficiency was a high priority in government, with the goal of low taxation. Overall, taxation was about 10%, the lowest in any modern nation.

Foreign policy became moralistic and hostile to the reactionary powers on the continent, teaming up with the United States to block European colonialism in the New World through the Monroe Doctrine of 1823. Slavery was abolished throughout the British Empire. The Royal Navy stepped up efforts to stop international trade in slaves.

Municipal reform was a necessity for the rapidly growing industrial cities still labouring under a hodgepodge of centuries-old laws and traditions. When Peel took over the Home Office, he abolished the espionage and cruel punishments, ended the death penalty for most crimes, and inaugurated the first system of professional police—who in London to this day are still called &quot;Bobbies&quot; in his honour. The Municipal Corporations Act 1835 modernised urban government, which previously had been controlled by closed bodies dominated by Tories. Over 200 old municipal corporations were abolished and replaced with 179 elected borough councils. Elections were to be based on registered voters, city finances had to be audited in a uniform fashion, and city officials were elected by the local taxpayers.

By far the most important of the reforms was the democratisation of Parliament, which began in a small but highly controversial fashion with the Reform Act 1832. The main impact was to drastically reduce the number of very small constituencies, with only a few dozen voters under the control of a local magnate. Industrial cities gained many of the seats but were still significantly underrepresented in Parliament. The 1831–1832 battle over parliamentary reform was, &quot;a year probably unmatched in English history for the sweep and intensity of its excitement.&quot; Every few years an incremental enlargement of the electorate was made by Parliament, reaching practically all male voters by the 1880s, and all the women by 1928. Both parties introduced paid professional organisers who supervised the mobilisation of all possible support in each constituency; about 80% of the men voted. The Tories discovered that their conservatism had an appeal to skilled workers, and also to women, hundreds of thousands of whom were organised by the Primrose League. Women&#x27;s suffrage was not on the agenda. The abolition of the House of Lords, while often discussed, was never necessary because the upper house repeatedly retreated in the face of determined House of Commons action. After defeating the first two versions of the Reform Act 1832, the Whigs got the king to agree to appoint as many new peers as was necessary to change the outcome. He promised to do so, but convinced the Lords it would be much wiser for them to approve the law.

====Political process====
A weak ruler as regent (1811–1820) and king (1820–1830), George IV let his ministers take full charge of government affairs. He was a deeply unpopular playboy. When he tried to get Parliament to pass a law allowing him to divorce his wife Queen Caroline, public opinion strongly supported her.

After four decades of rule by Pittites and Tories the first breakthrough in reform came in the removal by a Tory government of restrictions on the careers of Protestant Nonconformists in the repeal in 1828 of the laws that required Anglican church membership for many academic and government positions. Much more intense was the long battle over the civil rights of Roman Catholics. Catholic emancipation came in 1829, which removed the most substantial restrictions on Roman Catholics in Great Britain and Ireland. The Duke of Wellington, as Tory prime minister, decided that the surging crisis in largely Catholic Ireland necessitated some relief for the Catholics, although he had long opposed the idea. The other main Tory leader was Robert Peel, who suddenly reversed himself on the Catholic issue and was roundly denounced and permanently distrusted by the Ultra Tory faction of die-hards.

Earl Grey, prime minister from 1830 to 1834, and his rejuvenated Whig Party enacted a series of major reforms: the poor law was updated, child labour restricted and, most important, the Reform Act 1832 refashioned the British electoral system. In 1832 Parliament abolished slavery in the Empire with the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. The government purchased all the slaves for £20,000,000 (the money went to rich plantation owners who mostly lived in England), and freed the slaves, most of whom were in the Caribbean sugar islands.

The Whigs became champions of parliamentary reform by making the Reform Act 1832 their signature measure. It sharply reduced the numbers of &quot;rotten borough&quot; and &quot;pocket boroughs&quot; (where elections were controlled by powerful families), and instead redistributed seats on the basis of population. It also broadened the franchise, adding 217,000 voters to an electorate of 435,000 in England and Wales. The main effect of the act was to weaken the power of the landed gentry, and enlarge the power of the professional and business middle-class, which now for the first time had a significant voice in Parliament. However, at this point the great majority of manual workers, clerks and farmers did not have enough property to qualify to vote. Many of them received the vote in 1867. The aristocracy continued to dominate the Church of England, the most prestigious military and naval posts, and high society, but not business, industry or finance. In terms of national governmental policy, the democratic wishes of the entire people had become decisive.

Most historians emphasise the central importance of the legislation of the 1830s–60s, although there was a dissenting minority of scholars in the 1960s and 1970s who argued against deep meanings of Whiggish progress because each of the reforms was relatively minor in itself. Historian Richard Davis concludes that the scholarship of the 1970s represented &quot;a vindication of the main outlines of the old &quot;Whig interpretation.&quot; That is, the Reform Act 1832 was a response to mounting popular pressure. It was &quot;the culmination of a long historical process, and an important turning point in the emergence of a more liberal and broadly based political system… it deserves its old designation of &#x27;Great.&#x27;&quot;

David Thompson has stressed the revolutionary nature of the entire package of reforms:

====Chartism====

Chartism was a large-scale popular protest movement that emerged in response to the failure of the Reform Act 1832 to give the vote to the working class. It lacked middle-class support, and it failed repeatedly. Activists denounced the &quot;betrayal&quot; of the working classes and the &quot;sacrificing&quot; of their &quot;interests&quot; by the &quot;misconduct&quot; of the government. In 1838, Chartists issued the People&#x27;s Charter demanding manhood suffrage, equal-sized election districts, voting by ballots, payment of Members of Parliament (so that poor men could serve), annual parliaments, and abolition of property requirements. The ruling class saw the movement as dangerous. Multiple large peaceful meetings across England demanded change but the Chartists were unable to force serious constitutional debate. In July 1839, however, the House of Commons rejected, by 235 votes to 46, a motion to debate the Chartists&#x27; national petition, bearing 1.3 million signatures. Historians see Chartism as both a continuation of the 18th century fight against corruption and as a new stage in demands for democracy in an industrial society.

=== Prime ministers ===
Prime ministers of the period included: William Pitt the Younger, Lord Grenville, Duke of Portland, Spencer Perceval, Lord Liverpool, George Canning, Lord Goderich, Duke of Wellington, Lord Grey, Lord Melbourne, Lord Palmerston and Robert Peel.

The aristocracy remained dominant: there were 200 hereditary peers in the House of Lords in 1860; by 1837 they numbered 428; in 1901, there were 592. The number rose to 622 by 1910. Reform legislation in 1832, 1867, 1884 and 1918 weakened the aristocracy in terms of its control of the House of Commons. However, it ran the government: of the ten prime ministers under Victoria, six were peers. The seventh was the son of a duke. Two (Peel and Gladstone) emerged from the business community and only one (Disraeli) was a self-made man. Of the 227 cabinet members between 1832 and 1905, 139 were sons of peers.

Field Marshal Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, who defeated Napoleon, served as the leader of the Conservative party in the House of Lords, 1828–1846. Some writers have belittled him as a befuddled reactionary, but a consensus reached in the late 20th century depicts him as a shrewd operator who hid his cleverness behind the facade of a poorly-informed old soldier. Wellington worked to transform the Lords from unstinting support of the Crown to an active player in political manoeuvring, with a commitment to the landed aristocracy. He used his London residence as a venue for intimate dinners and private consultations, together with extensive correspondence that kept him in close touch with party leaders in the Commons and with leading figures in the Lords. He gave public rhetorical support to Ultra-Tory anti-reform positions, but then deftly changed positions toward the party&#x27;s centre, especially when Peel needed support from the upper house. Wellington&#x27;s success was based on the 44 peers elected from Scotland and Ireland, whose election he controlled.

Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey had promoted reform of Parliament since the 1790s, always to be defeated by the Ultra-Tories. The breakthrough came in his success in passage of the Reform Act 1832. He sought this as the final step of reform, rather than a first step in a long process, emphasising the urgent need in 1832 to settle the intense and growing political unrest across Britain. He believed that the respectable classes deserved to have their demands for greater representation met, but he refused to extend political power to the mass of the lower middle class and working class, saying that they were not ready to be trusted with it. He wanted to preserve the basic elements of the existing constitution by removing obvious abuses, thinking that this would strengthen aristocratic leadership. He persuaded the king to promise to create enough new peers to force the bill through the House of Lords. The king made the promise while also advising the peers to stop blocking the bill. The Reform Act 1832 was Grey&#x27;s principal achievement; it reflects his pragmatic, moderate and conservative character, as well as his parliamentary skills of timing and persuasion. His cabinet was a coalition of diverse interests, so in 1834 when it divided over the Irish church question he resigned.

Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston played the dominant role in shaping British foreign-policy as Foreign Secretary (1830–1834, 1835–1841 and 1846–1851) and as prime minister (1855–1858, 1859–1865). He served as Secretary at War in Tory governments for two decades, but switched over to the Whig coalition in 1830. The Tories despised him thereafter as a turncoat, and many of the more radical Whigs were distrustful of his basically conservative views that saw him fainthearted about or opposed to reform measures. He typically warned on the one hand against delays and on the other hand against excessive enthusiasm for reforms, preferring compromise. He was keenly sensitive to public opinion, and indeed often shapes it through his dealings with newspaper editors. When he sensed that public demand had reached an unstoppable momentum, he would work for a watered-down reform. He routinely gave the same advice to foreign governments. Diplomats across Europe took careful note of his move from the Tories to the Whigs, and suspected him of sympathy with the reform movements which were setting off upheavals in France, Belgium and elsewhere, and which frightened the reactionary governments of the major powers Russia, Austria and Russia. In reality he drew his foreign policy ideals from Canning. His main goals were to promote British strategic and economic interests worldwide, remain aloof from European alliances, mediate peace in Europe and use British naval power sparingly as needed. He worried most about France as an adversary, although he collaborated with them as in securing the independence of Belgium from the Kingdom of the Netherlands. He much preferred liberal and reform-oriented nations to reactionary powers. He placed a high priority on building up British strength in India, He spoke often of pride in British nationalism, which found favour in public opinion and gave him a strong basis of support outside Parliament.

=== Reformers ===

Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832) was an intellectual who focused on reforming English law. He was a leading promoter of utilitarianism as a working philosophy of action. The &quot;greatest happiness principle&quot;, or the principle of utility, forms the cornerstone of Bentham&#x27;s thought. By &quot;happiness&quot;, he understood a predominance of &quot;pleasure&quot; over &quot;pain&quot;. He is best known for his inspiration of the radical forces, helping them define those reforms that were most urgently needed and how they could be implemented. His intellectual leadership helped achieve many of the key legal, political, economic and social reforms of the 1830s and 1840s. He especially influenced the reform of education, prisons, poor laws, legal procedures and parliamentary representation.

John Bright (1811–1889) built on his middle-class Quaker heritage and his collaboration with Richard Cobden to promote all varieties of humanitarian and parliamentary reform. They started with a successful campaign against the Corn Laws. These were tariffs on imported food that kept up the price of grain to placate Tory landowners. The major factor in the cost of living was the price of food, and the Corn Laws kept the price high. Bright was a powerful speaker, which boosted him to election to Parliament in 1843. His radical program included extension of the suffrage, land reform and reduction of taxation. He opposed factory reforms, labour unions and controls on hours For workers, women and children, arguing that government intervention in economic life was always mistaken. He opposed wars and imperialism. His unremitting hostility to the Crimean war led to his defeat for reelection in 1857. He was soon reelected from Birmingham, leading a national campaign for parliamentary reform to enlarge the suffrage to reach the working man. He was intensely moralistic and distrusted the integrity of his opponents. He loathed the aristocracy that continued to rule Britain. He held a few minor cabinet positions, but his reputation rests on his organising skills and his rhetorical leadership for reform.

One historian summarised Bright&#x27;s achievements:

==Victorian era==
The Victorian era was the period of Queen Victoria&#x27;s rule between 1837 and 1901 which signified the height of the British Industrial Revolution and the apex of the British Empire. Scholars debate whether the Victorian period—as defined by a variety of sensibilities and political concerns that have come to be associated with the Victorians—actually begins with the passage of the Reform Act 1832. The era was preceded by the Regency era and succeeded by the Edwardian period. Victoria became queen in 1837 at age 18. Her long reign saw Britain reach the zenith of its economic and political power, with the introduction of steam ships, railways, photography and the telegraph. Britain again remained mostly inactive in Continental politics.

The Queen played a small role in politics, but became the iconic symbol of the nation, the empire and proper, restrained behaviour. Her success as ruler was due to the power of the self-images she successively portrayed of innocent young woman, devoted wife and mother, suffering and patient widow, and grandmotherly matriarch.

===Foreign policy===
====Free trade imperialism====

After the defeat of France in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1792–1815), the UK emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century (with London the largest city in the world from about 1830). Unchallenged at sea, British dominance was later described as &quot;Pax Britannica&quot; (&quot;British Peace&quot;), a period of relative peace in Europe and the world (1815–1914). By the time of the Great Exhibition of 1851, Britain was described as the &quot;workshop of the world&quot;. Using the imperial tools of free trade and financial investment, it exerted major influence on many countries outside Europe and the empire, especially in Latin America and Asia. Thus Britain had both a formal Empire based on British rule as well as an informal one based on the British pound.

====Russia, France and the Ottoman Empire====
One nagging fear was the possible collapse of the Ottoman Empire. It was well understood that a collapse of that country would set off a scramble for its territory and possibly plunge Britain into war. To head that off Britain sought to keep the Russians from occupying Constantinople and taking over the Bosphorus Strait, as well as from threatening India via Afghanistan. In 1853, Britain and France intervened in the Crimean War against Russia. Despite mediocre generalship, they managed to capture the Russian port of Sevastopol, compelling Tsar Nicholas I to ask for peace.

The next Russo-Ottoman war in 1877 led to another European intervention, although this time at the negotiating table. The Congress of Berlin blocked Russia from imposing the harsh Treaty of San Stefano on the Ottoman Empire. Despite its alliance with the French in the Crimean War, Britain viewed the Second Empire of Napoleon III with some distrust, especially as the emperor built up his navy, expanded his empire and took up a more active foreign policy.

====American Civil War====

During the American Civil War (1861–1865), British leaders and elite favoured the Confederate States of America, a major source of cotton for textile mills. Prince Albert was effective in defusing a war scare in late 1861 over the Trent Affair. The mostly working-class British people generally favoured the Union. What little cotton was available came from New York City, as the Union blockade of the Confederacy shut down 95% of Southern exports to Britain. Trade flourished with the Union and many young men crossed the Atlantic to join the Union Army. In September 1862, President Abraham Lincoln announced the Emancipation Proclamation would be issued in 90 days, thus making abolition of slavery a war goal. Britain was long opposed to slavery, itself having abolished it some three decades earlier, and any possibility of its intervention on behalf of the Confederacy ended.

British companies built and operated fast blockade runners to ship arms to and built warships for the Confederacy at considerable profit. London ignored American complaints that it allowed the selling of arms and building of warships for the Confederacy. Both blockade runners and warships caused a major diplomatic row that was partially resolved in the Alabama Claims in 1872, in the Americans&#x27; favour by payment of reparations only for damages caused by British-built Confederate warships.

====Empire expands====

Starting in 1867, Britain united most of its North American colonies as the Dominion of Canada, giving it self-government and responsibility for its own defence, although Canada did not have an independent foreign policy until 1931. The second half of the 19th century saw a scramble for Africa among the European powers. There was talk of war with France over the Fashoda Incident of 1898.

The rise of the German Empire after 1871 posed a new challenge, for it (along with the United States), threatened to usurp Britain&#x27;s place as the world&#x27;s foremost industrial power. Germany acquired a number of colonies in Africa and the Pacific, but Chancellor Otto von Bismarck succeeded in achieving general peace through his balance of power strategy. When William II became German Emperor in 1888, he discarded Bismarck, began using bellicose language, and planned to build a navy to rival Britain&#x27;s. Britain realised its isolation policy was useless as large-scale alliances emerged. It restored good relations with France and the United States, and ended tensions with Russia, while the confrontation with Germany became a naval race.

Ever since Britain had wrested control of the Cape Colony from the Netherlands during the Napoleonic Wars, it had co-existed with Dutch settlers who had migrated further away from the Cape and created two republics of their own: the South African Republic and the Orange Free State. The British imperial vision called for control over these new countries, and the Afrikaans-speaking &quot;Boers&quot; (or &quot;Afrikaners&quot;) fought back in the War in 1899–1902. Outgunned by a mighty empire, the Boer Commandos waged a guerrilla war (which certain other British territories would later employ to attain independence). This gave the British Armed Forces a difficult fight, but their weight of numbers, superior equipment and often brutal tactics, eventually brought about a British victory. The war had been costly in human rights and was widely criticised by Liberals in Britain and worldwide. However, the United States gave London its support. The Boer republics were merged with Cape Colony and Natal into the Union of South Africa in 1910; this had internal self-government, but its foreign policy was controlled by London and it was an integral part of the British Empire.

===Leadership===
Prime ministers of the period included: Lord Melbourne, Robert Peel, Lord John Russell, Lord Derby, Lord Aberdeen, Lord Palmerston, Benjamin Disraeli, William Ewart Gladstone, Lord Salisbury and Lord Rosebery.

Disraeli and Gladstone dominated the politics of the late 19th century, Britain&#x27;s golden age of parliamentary government. They long were idolised, but historians in recent decades have become much more critical, especially regarding Disraeli.

====Disraeli====

Benjamin Disraeli, prime minister in 1868 and 1874–80, remains an iconic hero of the Conservative Party. He was typical of the generation of British leaders who matured in the 1830s and 1840s. He was concerned with threats to established political, social and religious values and elites; he emphasised the need for national leadership in response to radicalism, uncertainty and materialism. Disraeli was especially noted for his enthusiastic support for expanding and strengthening the British Empire, in contrast to Gladstone&#x27;s negative attitude toward imperialism. Gladstone denounced Disraeli&#x27;s policies of territorial aggrandisement, military pomp and imperial symbolism (such as making the Queen Empress of India), saying it did not fit a modern commercial and Christian nation. However, Gladstone himself did not turn down attractive opportunities to expand the empire in Egypt.

Disraeli drummed up support by warnings of a supposed Russian threat to India that sank deep into the Conservative mindset. His reputation as the &quot;Tory democrat&quot; and promoter of the welfare state fell away as historians showed that Disraeli had few proposals for social legislation in 1874–1880, and that the Reform Act 1867 did not reflect a vision of Conservatism for the unenfranchised working man. However, he did work to reduce class antagonism, for as Perry notes, &quot;When confronted with specific problems, he sought to reduce tension between town and country, landlords and farmers, capital and labour, and warring religious sects in Britain and Ireland—in other words, to create a unifying synthesis.&quot;

In the popular culture, Disraeli was a great political hero, a status that persisted for decades after his death. For British music hall patrons in the 1880s and 1890s, &quot;xenophobia and pride in empire&quot; were reflected in the halls&#x27; most popular political heroes: all were Conservatives and Disraeli stood out above all, even decades after his death, while Gladstone was used as a villain. After 1920, historical films helped maintain the political status quo by sustaining an establishment viewpoint that emphasised the greatness of monarchy, empire and tradition as they created &quot;a facsimile world where existing values were invariably validated by events in the film and where all discord could be turned into harmony by an acceptance of the status quo.&quot; Disraeli was an especially popular film hero: &quot;historical dramas favoured Disraeli over Gladstone and, more substantively, promulgated an essentially deferential view of democratic leadership.&quot; Stage and screen actor George Arliss (1868–1946) was famous for his portrayals of Disraeli, winning the Oscar as best actor for 1929&#x27;s &quot;Disraeli&quot;. Arliss &quot;personified the kind of paternalistic, kindly, homely statesmanship that appealed to a significant proportion of the cinema audience… Even workers attending Labour party meetings deferred to leaders with an elevated social background who showed they cared.&quot;.

====Gladstone====
William Ewart Gladstone was the Liberal counterpart to Disraeli, serving as prime minister four times (1868–1874, 1880–1885, 1886 and 1892–1894). His financial policies, based on the notion of balanced budgets, low taxes and laissez-faire, were suited to a developing capitalist society but could not respond effectively as economic and social conditions changed. Called the &quot;Grand Old Man&quot; later in life, he was always a dynamic popular orator who appealed strongly to British workers and the lower middle class. The deeply religious Gladstone brought a new moral tone to politics with his evangelical sensibility. His moralism often angered his upper-class opponents (including Queen Victoria, who strongly favoured Disraeli), and his heavy-handed control split the Liberal party. His foreign policy goal was to create a European order based on cooperation rather than conflict and mutual trust instead of rivalry and suspicion; the rule of law was to supplant the reign of force and self-interest. This Gladstonian concept of a harmonious Concert of Europe was opposed to and ultimately defeated by the Germans with a Bismarckian system of manipulated alliances and antagonisms.

====Salisbury====
Conservative Prime Minister Lord Salisbury was a &quot;talented leader who was an icon of traditional, aristocratic conservatism&quot;. Salisbury was &quot;a great foreign minister, [but] essentially negative, indeed reactionary in home affairs&quot;. Another historian&#x27;s estimate is more favourable; he portrays Salisbury as a leader who &quot;held back the popular tide for twenty years.&quot; &quot;[I]nto the &#x27;progressive&#x27; strain of modern Conservatism he simply will not fit.&quot; One historian pointed to &quot;the narrow cynicism of Salisbury&quot;. One admirer of Salisbury agrees that Salisbury found the democracy born of the 1867 and 1884 Reform Acts as &quot;perhaps less objectionable than he had expected—succeeding, through his public persona, in mitigating some part of its nastiness.&quot;

===Morality===

The Victorian era is famous for the Victorian standards of personal morality. Historians generally agree that the middle classes held high personal moral standards (and usually followed them), but have debated whether the working classes followed suit. Moralists in the late 19th century such as Henry Mayhew decried the slums for their supposed high levels of cohabitation without marriage and illegitimate births. However, new research using computerised matching of data files shows that the rates of cohabitation then were quite low—under 5%—for the working class and the poor.

==Early 20th century==
Prime ministers from 1900 to 1923: Marquess of Salisbury, Arthur Balfour, Henry Campbell-Bannerman, H. H. Asquith, David Lloyd George, Bonar Law.

===Edwardian era: 1901–1914===

Queen Victoria died in 1901 and her son Edward VII became king, inaugurating the Edwardian era, which was characterised by great and ostentatious displays of wealth in contrast to the sombre Victorian Era. With the advent of the 20th century, things such as motion pictures, automobiles, and aeroplanes were coming into use. The new century was characterised by a feeling of great optimism. The social reforms of the last century continued into the 20th with the Labour Party being formed in 1900. Edward died in 1910, to be succeeded by George V, who reigned 1910–1936. Scandal-free, hard working and popular, George V was the British monarch who, with Queen Mary, established the modern pattern of exemplary conduct for British royalty, based on middle-class values and virtues. He understood the overseas Empire better than any of his prime ministers and used his exceptional memory for figures and details, whether of uniforms, politics, or relations, to good effect in reaching out in conversation with his subjects.

The era was prosperous but political crises were escalating out of control. Multiple crises hit simultaneously in 1910–1914 with serious social and political instability arising from the Irish crisis, labour unrest, the women&#x27;s suffrage movements, and partisan and constitutional struggles in Parliament. At one point it even seemed the Army might refuse orders dealing with Ireland. No solution appeared in sight when the unexpected outbreak of the Great War in 1914 put domestic issues on hold. The political party system of the Edwardian era was in delicate balance on the eve of the war in 1914. The Liberals were in power with a progressive alliance of Labour and, off and on, Irish nationalists. The coalition was committed to free trade (as opposed to the high tariffs the Conservatives sought), free collective bargaining for trades unions (which Conservatives opposed), an active social policy that was forging the welfare state, and constitutional reform to reduce the power of the House of Lords. The coalition lacked a long-term plan, because it was cobbled together from leftovers from the 1890s. The sociological basis was non-Anglicanism and non-English ethnicity rather than the emerging class conflict emphasised by the Labour Party.

===Great War===
After a rough start Britain under David Lloyd George successfully mobilised its manpower, industry, finances, empire and diplomacy, in league with the French and Americans, to defeat the Central Powers. The economy grew by about 14% from 1914 to 1918 despite the absence of so many men in the services; by contrast the German economy shrank 27%. The Great War saw a decline in civilian consumption, with a major reallocation to munitions. The government share of GDP soared from 8% in 1913 to 38% in 1918 (compared to 50% in 1943). The war forced Britain to use up its financial reserves and borrow large sums from the U.S.

Britain entered the war to protect Belgium from German aggression, and quickly assumed the role of fighting the Imperial German Army on the Western Front, and dismantling the overseas German Empire. The romantic notions of warfare that everyone had expected faded as the fighting in France bogged down into trench warfare. Along the Western Front the British and French launched repeated assaults on the German trench lines in 1915–1917, which killed and wounded hundreds of thousands, but made only limited gains. By early 1916, with number of volunteers falling off, the government imposed conscription in Britain (but was not able to do so in Ireland where nationalists of all stripes militantly opposed it) in order to keep up the strength of the army. Industry turned out munitions in large quantities, with many women taking factory jobs. The Asquith government proved ineffective but when David Lloyd George replaced him in December 1916 Britain gained a powerful and successful wartime leader.

The Navy continued to dominate the seas, fighting the Imperial German Navy to a draw in the only great battle, the Battle of Jutland in 1916. Germany was blockaded and was increasingly short of food. It tried to fight back with submarines, despite the risk of war by the powerful neutral power the United States. The waters around Britain were declared a war zone where any ship, neutral or otherwise, was a target. After the liner &quot;Lusitania&quot; was sunk in May 1915, drowning over 100 American passengers, protests by the United States led Germany to abandon unrestricted submarine warfare. In spring 1917 it resumed the sinking of all merchant ships without warning. The United States entered the war alongside the Allies in 1917, and provided the needed manpower, money and supplies to keep them going. On other fronts, the British, French, New Zealanders, Australians and Japanese occupied Germany&#x27;s colonies. Britain fought the Ottoman Empire, suffering defeats in the Gallipoli Campaign and (initially) in Mesopotamia, while arousing the Arabs who helped expel the Turks from Mesopotamia and Palestine. Exhaustion and war-weariness were growing worse in 1917, as the fighting in France continued with no end in sight. With Russia collapsing in the 1917 Revolutions Germany now calculated it could finally have numerical superiority on the Western Front. The massive German spring offensives of 1918 failed, and with arrival of a million of the American Expeditionary Forces at the rate of 10,000 a day by May 1918, the Germans realised they were being overwhelmed. Germany gave up, agreeing to an Armistice on 11 November 1918. It was actually tantamount almost to a surrender with Germany handing over her fleet and heavy weapons, and her army retreating behind the river Rhine.

By 1918, there were about five million people in the army and the fledgling Royal Air Force, newly formed from the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), was about the same size of the pre-war army. The almost three million casualties were known as the &quot;lost generation&quot;, and such numbers inevitably left society scarred; but even so, some people felt their sacrifice was little regarded in Britain, with poems like Siegfried Sassoon&#x27;s &quot;Blighters&quot; criticising the war as a human failure. The literary legacy focused on mass death, mechanised slaughter, fallacious propaganda and deep disillusionment, thereby annihilating long-standing romanticised images of the glories of war.

===Postwar===

The war had been won by Britain and its allies, but at a terrible human and financial cost, creating a sentiment that wars should never be fought again. The League of Nations was founded with the idea that nations could resolve their differences peacefully, but these hopes were unfounded.

Following the war, Britain gained the German colony of Tanganyika and part of Togoland in Africa. Britain was granted League of Nations mandates over Palestine, which was turned into a homeland for Jewish settlers, and Iraq, created from the three Ottoman provinces in Mesopotamia; the latter of which became fully independent in 1932. The Kingdom of Egypt, which had been occupied by Britain since 1882, and a British protectorate since 1914, became independent in 1922 after the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, although British troops remained stationed there until the Suez Crisis of 1956.

In domestic affairs the Housing Act 1919 led to affordable council housing which allowed people to move out of decrepit inner-city slums. The slums remained for several more years, with trams being electrified long before many houses. The Representation of the People Act 1918 gave women householders the vote, but it would not be until 1928 that full equal suffrage was achieved. Labour displaced the Liberal Party for second place and achieved major success with the 1922 general election.

==Ireland==
===Campaign for Irish Home Rule===

Part of the agreement which led to the 1800 Act of Union stipulated that the Penal Laws in Ireland were to be repealed and Catholic emancipation granted. However, King George III blocked emancipation, arguing that to grant it would break his coronation oath to defend the Anglican Church. A campaign by the lawyer Daniel O&#x27;Connell, and the death of George III, led to the concession of Catholic emancipation in 1829, allowing Roman Catholics to sit in the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Catholic emancipation was not O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s real goal, which was the repeal of the act of union with Great Britain. On 1 January 1843 O&#x27;Connell confidently, but wrongly, declared that repeal would be achieved that year. When potato blight hit the island in 1846, much of the rural population, especially in Catholic districts, began to starve.

While government funds were supplemented by private individuals and charities, and aid from the United States, it was not enough to avert a major catastrophe. The government of Lord John Russell attempted to raise a loan of £8 million and intended a further loan but this provoked a financial crisis made worse by demand for funds for railways and food imports. The crisis prevented the expending of the loan if the pound was to remain convertible to gold and government funding was slashed in 1847 and the costs of relief transferred to local taxes in Ireland. Cottiers (or farm labourers) were largely wiped out and emigration soared during what is known in Ireland as the &quot;Great Hunger&quot;. A significant minority elected Unionists, who championed the Union. A Church of Ireland (Anglican) barrister Isaac Butt, built a new moderate nationalist movement, the Home Rule League, in the 1870s. After Butt&#x27;s death the home rule movement, or the Irish Parliamentary Party as it had become known, was turned into a major political force under the guidance of William Shaw and a radical young Anglo-Irish Protestant landowner, Charles Stewart Parnell.

Parnell&#x27;s movement campaigned for &quot;Home Rule&quot;, by which they meant that Ireland would govern itself as a region within the United Kingdom. Two home rule Bills (1886 and 1893) were introduced by the Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone, but neither became law, mainly due to opposition from the Conservative party and the House of Lords. The issue was a source of contention throughout Ireland, as a significant majority of Unionists (largely but not exclusively based in Ulster), opposed home rule, fearing that a Catholic Nationalist (&quot;Rome Rule&quot;) parliament in Dublin would discriminate or retaliate against them, impose Roman Catholic doctrine, and impose tariffs on industry. While most of Ireland was primarily agricultural, six of the counties in Ulster were the location of heavy industry and would be affected by any tariff barriers imposed.

Irish demands ranged from the &quot;repeal&quot; of O&#x27;Connell, the &quot;federal scheme&quot; of William Sharman Crawford (actually devolution, not federalism as such), to the Home Rule League of Isaac Butt. Ireland was no closer to home rule by the mid-19th century, and rebellions in 1848 and 1867 failed.

O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s campaign was hampered by the limited scope of the franchise in Ireland. The wider the franchise was expanded, the better anti-union parties were able to do in Ireland. Running on a platform that advocated something like the self-rule successfully enacted in Canada under the British North America Act, 1867, home rulers won a majority of both county and borough seats in Ireland in 1874. By 1882, leadership of the home rule movement had passed to Charles Stewart Parnell of the Irish Parliamentary Party. A wider franchise also changed the ideological mix among non-Irish MPs, making them more receptive to Irish demands. The 1885 election resulted in a hung parliament in which the Irish Parliamentary Party held the balance of power. They initially supported the Conservatives in a minority government, but when news leaked that Liberal Party leader Gladstone was considering home rule, the IPP ousted the Conservatives and brought the Liberals into office.

Gladstone&#x27;s First Home Rule Bill was closely modelled on the self-government given Canada in 1867. Irish MPs would no longer vote in Westminster but would have their own separate Dublin parliament, which would control domestic issues. Foreign policy and military affairs would remain with London. Gladstone&#x27;s proposals did not go as far as most Irish nationalists desired, but were still too radical for both Irish unionists and British unionists: his first home rule hill was defeated in the House of Commons following a split in his own party. Liberal leader Joseph Chamberlain led the battle against home rule in Parliament. He broke with Gladstone and in 1886 formed a new party, the Liberal Unionist Party. It helped defeat home rule and eventually merged with the Conservative party. Chamberlain used anti-Catholicism to build a base for the new party among &quot;Orange&quot; nonconformist Protestant elements in Britain and Ireland. Liberal Unionist John Bright coined the party&#x27;s catchy slogan, &quot;Home rule means Rome rule.&quot;

Gladstone took the issue to the people in the 1886 election, but the Unionists (Conservatives plus the Liberal Unionists) won a majority. In 1890 a divorce case showed Parnell was an adulterer; he was forced from power, and died in 1891. Gladstone introduced a Second Home Rule Bill in 1893, which this time was passed by the Commons, but was defeated in the Conservative-dominated House of Lords. The Conservatives came to power until 1906 and home rule became a dead issue, but the subsidised sale of farm land greatly reduced the Protestant presence in Ireland south of Ulster. Having been rejected by the Conservatives, the Irish nationalist forces had little choice but to support the minority Liberal Party. New groups split off and they finally all merged in 1900 into the Irish Parliamentary Party led by John Redmond.

The Conservative government also felt that the demands in Ireland could be satisfied by helping the Catholics purchase their farms from Protestant owners. A solution by money not force was called &quot;killing home rule with kindness&quot;. Reforms passed as a result included the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 and the Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903. Between 1868 and 1908: spending on Ireland was generally increased, huge tracts of land were purchased from landlords and redistributed to smallholders, local government was democratised, and the franchise widely extended. Ireland remained calm until the eve of the First World War, when the Liberal government passed the Government of Ireland Act 1914 and Protestants in Ulster mobilised to oppose it by force.

Ulster Protestants began to arm themselves and form militias ready to fight; senior leaders of the British army indicated they would not move to suppress the Protestants (the Curragh incident). Suddenly war with Germany broke out and home rule was suspended for the duration. There was no conscription in Ireland; military service was optional. Large numbers of both Protestant and Catholic young men volunteered to fight Germany.

===Irish independence===
The Easter Rising of 1916, using arms supplied by the German Empire was badly organised. The British army suppressed it after a week of fighting but the quick executions of 15 leaders alienated nationalist opinion. Overnight there was a movement away from home rule and toward Irish independence. The Cabinet decided that the 1914 Act should be brought into operation immediately and a Government established in Dublin. Negotiations were stalemated as Ulster mobilised. London made a second attempt to implement Home Rule in 1917, with the calling of the Irish Convention. Prime Minister Lloyd George sought a &quot;dual policy&quot; in April 1918 that attempted to link implementing Home Rule with extending conscription to Ireland. Irish nationalists rejected conscription and a wave of anti-conscription demonstrations signalled growing support for the demand for total independence. The old Irish Party collapsed and a new political force, Sinn Féin which called for force to achieve its goals, united Irish nationalists.

Sinn Féin won the 1918 general elections in Ireland and in keeping with their policy of abstention did not send its elected MPs to Westminster, deciding to set up its own separatist parliament in Dublin; Dáil Éireann, which declared independence. The British government attempted to suppress the First Dáil and the Irish War of Independence followed. London&#x27;s attempted solution was the establishment of two Irish parliaments to pave the way for the Fourth Home Rule Bill, enacted as the Government of Ireland Act 1920 while also attempting to defeat Sinn Féin and the Irish Republican Army which by this time was operating under the remit of Dáil Éireann. In mid 1921 a truce was agreed between the British government and Sinn Féin and this resulted in the Anglo-Irish Treaty. On 6 December 1922, Southern Ireland formed a new dominion named the Irish Free State. As expected, &quot;Northern Ireland&quot; (six counties in Ulster), immediately exercised its right under the Anglo-Irish Treaty to opt out of the new state. This treaty created a division in Irish nationalism and resulted in the Irish Civil War between the Provisional Government of Ireland and the Anti-Treaty faction of the Irish Republican Army. The union of Great Britain with most of Ulster was renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1927, and is known by this name to the present time.

==List of monarchs==
Until 1927, the monarch&#x27;s royal title included the words &quot;of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;. In 1927, the words &quot;United Kingdom&quot; were removed from the royal title so that the monarch was instead styled as &quot;King/Queen of Great Britain, Ireland...[and other places]&quot;. The words &quot;United Kingdom&quot; were restored to the monarch&#x27;s title in 1953 with the reference to &quot;Ireland&quot; replaced with a reference to &quot;Northern Ireland&quot;.
* George III (1801–1820; monarch from 1760)
* George IV (1820–1830)
* William IV (1830–1837)
* Victoria (1837–1901)
* Edward VII (1901–1910)
* George V (1910–1922; title used until 1927 but remained monarch until his death in 1936)

<text>Rooibos ( ; , ), or , is a broom-like member of the plant family Fabaceae that grows in South Africa&#x27;s Fynbos biome.

The leaves are used to make a caffeine free herbal tea that is called rooibos (especially in Southern Africa), bush tea, red tea, or redbush tea (predominantly in Great Britain).

The tea has been popular in Southern Africa for generations, and since the 2000s has gained popularity internationally.
The tea has an earthy flavour that is similar to yerba mate or tobacco.

Rooibos was formerly classified as but is now thought to be part of following Dahlgren (1980).
The specific name of was given by Burman (1759)
for the plant&#x27;s linear growing structure and needle-like leaves.

The name rooibos is Afrikaans deriving from , meaning . The name is protected in South Africa and has protected designation of origin status in the EU.

== Production and processing ==


Rooibos is usually grown in the Cederberg, a small mountainous area in the West Coast District of the Western Cape province of South Africa.

Generally, the leaves undergo oxidation. This process produces the distinctive reddish-brown colour of rooibos and enhances the flavour. Unoxidised &quot;green&quot; rooibos is also produced, but the more demanding production process for green rooibos (similar to the method by which green tea is produced) makes it more expensive than traditional rooibos. It carries a malty and slightly grassy flavour somewhat different from its red counterpart.

==Use==
Rooibos is commonly prepared as a tisane by steeping in hot water, in the same manner as black tea. The infusion is consumed on its own or flavoured by addition of milk, lemon, sugar or honey. It is also served as lattes, cappuccinos or iced tea.

== Chemical composition ==
As a fresh leaf, rooibos contains a high content of ascorbic acid (vitamin C).

Rooibos tea does not contain caffeine and has low tannin levels compared to black tea or green tea. Rooibos contains polyphenols, including flavanols, flavones, flavanones, dihydrochalcones, aspalathin and nothofagin.

The processed leaves and stems contain benzoic and cinnamic acids.

== Grading ==

Rooibos grades are largely related to the percentage needle or leaf to stem content in the mix. A higher leaf content results in a darker liquor, richer flavour and less &quot;dusty&quot; aftertaste. The high-grade rooibos is exported and does not reach local markets, with major consumers being the EU, particularly Germany, where it is used in creating flavoured blends for loose-leaf tea markets.

== History ==
Three species of the Borboniae group of &quot;Aspalathus&quot;, namely &quot;A. angustifolia&quot;, &quot;A. cordata&quot; and &quot;A. crenata&quot;, were once used as tea. These plants have simple, rigid, spine-tipped leaves, hence the common name &#x27;stekeltee&#x27;. The earliest record of the use of &quot;Aspalathus&quot; as a source of tea was that of Carl Peter Thunberg, who wrote about the use of &quot;A. cordata&quot; as tea: &quot;Of the leaves of &quot;Borbonia cordata&quot; the country people make tea.&quot; (Thunberg, July 1772, at Paarl). This anecdote is sometimes erroneously associated with rooibos tea (&quot;Aspalathus linearis&quot;).

Archaeological records suggest that &quot;Aspalathus linearis&quot; could have been used thousands of years ago, but that does not imply rooibos tea was made in precolonial times. The traditional method of harvesting and processing rooibos (for making rooibos infusion or decoction tea) could have, at least partly, originated in precolonial times. However, it does not necessarily follow that San and Khoikhoi used that method to prepare a beverage that they consumed for pleasure as tea.

The earliest available ethnobotanical records of rooibos tea originate in the late 19th century. No Khoi or San vernacular names of the species have been recorded. Several authors have assumed that the tea originated from the local inhabitants of the Cederberg. Apparently, rooibos tea is a traditional drink of Khoi-descended people of the Cederberg (and &quot;poor whites&quot;). However, that tradition has not been traced further back than the last quarter of the 19th century.

Traditionally, the local people would climb the mountains and cut the fine needle-like leaves from wild rooibos plants. They then rolled the bunches of leaves into hessian bags and brought them down the steep slopes using donkeys. Rooibos tea was traditionally processed by beating the material on a flat rock with a heavy wooden pole or club or a large wooden hammer.

The historical record of the use of rooibos in precolonial and early colonial times is mostly a record of absence. Colonial-era settlers could have learnt about some properties of the &quot;Aspalathus linearis&quot; from pastoralists and hunter-gatherers of the Cederberg region. The nature of that knowledge was not documented. Given the available data, the origin of rooibos tea can be viewed in the context of the global expansion of tea trade and the colonial habit of drinking Chinese and later Ceylon tea. In that case, the rooibos infusion or decoction served as a local replacement for the expensive Asian product.

It appears that both the indigenous (San and Khoikhoi) and the colonial inhabitants of rooibos-growing areas contributed to the traditional knowledge of rooibos in some way. For instance, medicinal uses might have been introduced before the 18th century by Khoisan pastoralists or San hunter-gatherers. Also, the use of the &quot;Aspalathus linearis&quot; to make tea, including the production processes, such as bruising and oxidising the leaves, is more likely to have been introduced in colonial times by settlers who were accustomed to drinking Asian tea or its substitutes.

In 1904, South African businessman, also referred to as &#x27;the father of the rooibos industry&#x27;,Benjamin Ginsberg ran a variety of experiments at Rondegat Farm and finally cured rooibos. He simulated the traditional Chinese method of making Keemun by fermenting the tea in barrels, drawing inspiration from his Jewish family&#x27;s tradition of brewing tea and herbal infusions, which were customarily prepared with a samovar The major hurdle in growing rooibos commercially was that farmers could not germinate the rooibos seeds. The seeds were hard to find and impossible to germinate commercially. A medical doctor by profession and business partner to Ginsberg, Pieter le Fras Nortier, ascertained that seeds require a process of scarification before they are planted in acidic, sandy soil.

By the late 1920s, growing demand for the tea had led to problems with supply of the wild rooibos plants. As a remedy, Pieter le Fras Nortier, a district surgeon in Clanwilliam and an avid naturalist, proposed to develop a cultivated variety of rooibos to be raised on appropriately-situated land. Nortier worked on cultivation of the rooibos species in partnership with the farmers Oloff Bergh and William Riordan and with the encouragement of Benjamin Ginsberg.

Bergh harvested a large amount of rooibos in 1925 on his farm Kleinvlei, in the Pakhuis Mountains. Nortier collected seeds in the Pakhuis Mountains (Rocklands) and in a large valley, called Grootkloof, and those first selected seeds are known as the Nortier-type and Redtea-type.

In 1930, Nortier began conducting experiments with the commercial cultivation of the rooibos plant. He cultivated the first plants at Clanwilliam on his farm of Eastside and on the farm of Klein Kliphuis. The tiny seeds were very difficult to come by Nortier, who paid the local villagers £5 per matchbox of seeds collected. An aged Khoi woman found an unusual seed source: having chanced upon ants dragging seed, she followed them back to their nest and, on breaking it open, found a granary.

Nortier&#x27;s research was ultimately successful, and he subsequently showed all the local farmers how to germinate their own seeds. The secret lay in scarifying the seed pods. Nortier placed a layer of seeds between two mill stones and ground away some of the seed pod wall. Thereafter the seeds were easily propagated. Over the next decade the price of seeds rose to £80 per pound, the most expensive vegetable seed in the world, as farmers rushed to plant rooibos. Today, the seed is gathered by special sifting processes. Nortier is today accepted as the father of the rooibos tea industry.

The variety developed by Nortier has become the mainstay of the rooibos industry enabling it to expand and create income and jobs for inhabitants of rooibos-growing regions. Thanks to Nortier&#x27;s research, rooibos tea became an iconic national beverage and then a globalised commodity. Production is today the economic mainstay of the Clanwilliam district. In 1948, the University of Stellenbosch awarded Nortier an Honorary Doctorate D.Sc. (Agria) in recognition for his valuable contribution to South African agriculture.

=== Life history and reproduction ===

&quot;Aspalathus linearis&quot; has a small endemic range in the wild, but horticultural techniques to maximise production have been effective at maintaining cultivation as a semi-wild crop to supply the new demands of the broadening &quot;rooibos&quot; tea industry. &quot;A. linearis&quot; is often grouped with the honeybush (&quot;Cyclopia&quot;), another plant from the Fynbos region of Southern Africa, which is also used to make tea. Like other members of the genus, &quot;A. linearis&quot; is considered a part of the Fynbos ecoregion in the Cape Floristic Region, whose plants often depend on fire for reproduction.

&quot;A. linearis&quot; is a legume and thus an angiosperm and produces an indehiscent fruit. Its flowers make up a raceme inflorescence. Seed germination can be slow, but sprouting can be induced by acid treatment. The seeds are hard-shelled and often need scarification.
For &quot;A. linearis&quot;, fire can stimulate resprouting in the species, but the sprouting is less than that of other plants in the Fynbos ecoregion. &quot;A. linearis&quot; can be considered facultative and obligate sprouters and have lignotuber development for after fires. Typically, there are two classifications of &quot;A. lineraris&quot; in response to fire: &quot;reseeders&quot; and &quot;resprouters&quot;. Reseeders are killed by fire, but it stimulates their seeds’ germination. Resprouters are not completely killed during a fire and grow back from established lignotubers.

Seeds of wild populations are dispersed by species of ants, whose use as dispersers reduces parent-offspring and sibling-sibling competition.
Ants are also helpful in dispersion as they reduce the susceptibility of seeds to other herbivores.

Like most other legumes, there is a symbiotic relationship between rhizoids and the underground lignotuber structure that promotes nitrogen fixation and growth. The nitrogen content in the soil is an important environmental factor for growth, development, and reproduction. Hawkins, Malgas, &amp; Biénabe (2011) suggested that there are multiple ecotypes of &quot;A. linearis&quot; that have different selected methods of growth and morphology and are dependent on the environment. It is unclear how many ecotypes there might be, given their limited geographic range and the limited literature about genetic diversity. Van der Bank, Van der Bank, &amp; Van Wyk (1999) suggest that resprouting populations and reseeding populations have been selected for based on the environment as a way to reduce genetic bottlenecks; however, whether that promotes certain reproductive strategies over others was unclear.

Wild populations can contain both sprouting and non-sprouting individuals, but cultivated rooibos are typically reseeders, not resprouters, and have higher growth rates. Cultivated &quot;A. linearis&quot; can be selected for certain traits that are desirable for human use. Cultivated plants are diploid with a base chromosome number of 9 ( 18 chromosomes), but the understanding of how this might differ in ecotypes is limited. The selection process can include human-mediated pollination, fire suppression, and supplementing soil contents.

Like many other Fynbos plants, &quot;A. linearis&quot; is not significantly pollinated by cape honey bees, which suggests an alternative way of primary pollination. Some wasps likely play an important role in pollinating the flowers and some wasp species are thought to be specially adapted to accessing the &quot;A. linearis&quot; flower.

=== US trademark controversy ===
In 1994, Burke International registered the name &quot;Rooibos&quot; with the US Patent and Trademark Office and so established a monopoly on the name in the United States when the plant was virtually unknown there. When it later entered more widespread use, Burke demanded for companies to pay fees to use the name or to cease its use. In 2005, the American Herbal Products Association and a number of import companies succeeded in defeating the trademark through petitions and lawsuits. After losing one of the cases, Burke surrendered the name to the public domain.

=== Legal protection of the name &quot;rooibos&quot; ===
The South African Department of Trade and Industry issued final rules on 6 September 2013 that protects and restricts the use of the names &quot;rooibos&quot;, &quot;red bush&quot;, &quot;rooibostee&quot;, &quot;rooibos tea&quot;, &quot;rooitee&quot;, and &quot;rooibosch&quot; in the country so that the name cannot be used for things unless they are derived from the &quot;Aspalathus linearis&quot; plant. It also provides guidance and restrictions for how products that include rooibos and in what measures should use the name &quot;rooibos&quot; in their branding.

In May 2021, the European Union conferred protected designation of origin (PDO) status to &quot;rooibos&quot;. Any foodstuff sold as &quot;rooibos&quot; in the EU and several countries outside the bloc must be made by using only &quot;Aspalathus linearis&quot; leaves that are cultivated in the Cederberg region of South Africa.

===Environmental concerns===
The rooibos plant is endemic to a small part of the Western Cape Province, South Africa. It grows in a symbiotic relationship with local micro-organisms. A 2012 South African news item cited concerns regarding the prospects of rooibos farming in the face of climate change.

The use of rooibos and the expansion of its cultivation are threatening other local species of plants endemic to the area such as &quot;Protea convexa&quot;, &quot;Roridula dentata&quot; and &quot;P. scolymocephala&quot;.

<doc id="152261" wikidata="Q708416" url="?curid=152261" title="Michael Spinks">
<text>Michael Spinks (born July 22, 1956) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1977 to 1988. He held world championships in two weight classes, including the undisputed light heavyweight title from 1983 to 1985, and the lineal heavyweight title from 1985 to 1988. As an amateur he won a gold medal in the middleweight division at the 1976 Summer Olympics.

Nicknamed &quot;Jinx&quot;, which spawned the nickname of his straight right hand, &quot;the Spinks Jinx&quot;, Spinks is the brother of former world heavyweight champion Leon Spinks, and uncle of Cory Spinks, a former welterweight and light middleweight champion.

After a successful amateur career, which culminated in his Olympic gold medal win, Spinks went undefeated in his first 31 professional fights, beating Dwight Muhammad Qawi, Eddie Mustafa Muhammad, Marvin Johnson and Eddie Davis en route to becoming the undisputed light heavyweight champion. After defending the title against 10 different fighters, Spinks moved up to heavyweight, and as an underdog defeated long-reigning IBF heavyweight champion Larry Holmes (whose own 48–0 record up to that point was one victory short of tying Rocky Marciano&#x27;s 49–0 unblemished record); in doing so, Spinks became the first reigning light heavyweight world champion to win the heavyweight title. In his final fight, Spinks was knocked out by Mike Tyson in 91 seconds, the only defeat of his professional career.

Spinks has been inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame and the World Boxing Hall of Fame. The International Boxing Research Organization and BoxRec rank Spinks among the 10 greatest light heavyweights of all time.

==Amateur career==
Spinks won the 1974 156-pound Golden Gloves Light Middleweight Championship by defeating Wilber Cameron in Denver, Colorado, and then took the silver medal in the National AAU 165-pound Championship Competition in 1975, losing in three rounds to Tom Sullivan in Shreveport, Louisiana. He rebounded to take the 1976 National Golden Gloves Middleweight championship with a three-round victory over Lamont Kirkland in Miami, Florida, and that same year captured the United States Olympic Trials Middleweight Championship by defeating Keith Broom in Cincinnati, Ohio. At the 1976 Montreal Olympics, Spinks benefited from a favorable draw. Due to a bye and two wins by walkover, he was only required to box two opponents to win the gold medal in the middleweight division. He went on to defeat the Soviet Union&#x27;s Rufat Riskiyev in the final.

===Highlights===
*Compiled an amateur record of (93-7)
*Won the 1974 Light Middleweight (156 lb.) National Golden Gloves Championship.
*Made it to the finals of the 1975 National AAU, losing to Tommy Brooks
*Won the 1976 Middleweight (165 lb.) National Golden Gloves Championship in Miami, Florida.
*Won the Middleweight Gold Medal for the United States at the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

===Olympic results===
 at the XXI Summer Olympics (165 lbs), Montreal, Canada, July 1976:
* Round of 32: bye
* Round of 16: Defeated Jean-Marie Emebe (Cameroon) by walkover
* Quarterfinal: Defeated Ryszard Pasiewicz (Poland) by unanimous decision, 5–0
* Semifinal: Defeated Alec Năstac (Romania) by walkover
* Final: Defeated Rufat Riskiyev (Soviet Union) RSC 3 

Spinks finished his amateur career with a record of 93 wins (35 knockouts,) 7 losses.

==Hiatus==
With the Olympics behind him, Spinks returned to work at a chemical factory in St. Louis, Missouri, &quot;scrubbing floors and cleaning toilets,&quot; as one source tells it. He had no big contracts awaiting him and, while Michael appeared to experts to be the more promising of the two brothers, Leon was at that time the big shooting star, a television staple of ABC Sports, on his way to a shot at heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali. Michael had their mother to care for, and he was intent on helping Leon prepare for Ali. All of this pushed Michael&#x27;s career to the back burner. It was Butch Lewis in 1977 who convinced Michael to turn professional.

==Professional career==
===Early years===
Spinks then turned professional with a win over Eddie Benson, knocking him out in one round on April 17, 1977, in Las Vegas. With that, Spinks began a 31 fight winning streak that would almost extend to the end of his career. After four more wins, Spinks finished &#x27;77 with the first fight that began a gradual ascent in opposition quality: an eight-round decision over Gary Summerhays, a popular young boxer of the time.

In 1978, Spinks won two fights, including an eight-round decision over former world Middleweight title challenger Tom Bethea, in the same undercard where his brother Leon dethroned Ali as world Heavyweight champion in Las Vegas.

1979 saw Spinks get less than three minutes of boxing action inside a ring, with his only fight ending in a first round knockout of Marc Hans, but in 1980, Spinks took his ascent towards the top to another level, when he beat future IBF super-middleweight champion Murray Sutherland, David Conteh, and fringe contenders Ramon Ronquillo and Alvaro Yaqui Lopez (who challenged for a world title four times). Of his five wins that year, three came by knockout, Sutherland and Johnny Wilburn being the only ones who lasted the distance.

===First world title===
By 1981, Spinks was already a top ranked contender, and after beating former and future world light-heavyweight champion Marvin Johnson by a knockout in four rounds, the WBA made Spinks their number one challenger, and so, on July 18 of that year, he met WBA light-heavyweight champion Eddie Mustafa Muhammad, once again in Las Vegas. Spinks dropped Mustafa Muhammad in round 12 and went on to become the WBA light heavyweight champion with a 15-round decision win. He defended the title once in &#x27;81, beating Vonzell Johnson by a knockout in seven.

1982 began with a knockout victory over Mustafa Wassaja. Spinks had become a superstar, at least in the boxing world. He began appearing on the covers of boxing magazines and boxing fans started clamoring for a unification fight with WBC champion Dwight Muhammad Qawi. Tragedy struck his life, however, when in January 1983, his 24-year-old wife, Sandy Massey, died in a car crash, leaving Spinks the single parent of his two-year-old daughter, Michelle.

===Spinks vs Qawi===

Meanwhile, the fight all the fans wanted was being asked for by boxing critics and magazine editors, too. On March 18, two months after his wife&#x27;s death, Spinks and Qawi met in a boxing ring for the undisputed light heavyweight championship. The fight was broadcast by HBO World Championship Boxing, and, according to the book &quot;The Ring: Boxing the 20th Century&quot;, Spinks had a very tough moment to overcome before it even started: His daughter asked him, while he was in his dressing room, if her mother would come to watch the fight. After breaking into tears he composed himself and dominated the fight with his jab and plenty of strategic hooks and crosses. He repeatedly stopped Qawi in his tracks over the first 11 rounds but cautiously waited for Qawi to come out of his crouched defense to resume his assault. Qawi scored a knockdown in round eight. The official scores were 144–140, 144–141, and 144–141, all for Spinks, who was now the undisputed world Light Heavyweight champion. He defended the title one more time before the end of the year, against Oscar Rivadeneira, whom he beat by a ten-round knockout.

Spinks fought only once in 1984, retaining his crown with a twelve-round majority decision over Eddie Davis. He and Qawi were only a couple of weeks away from fighting a rematch in September of that year, but that fight got called off when Qawi was injured during training. Spinks also was recognized as IBF Light heavyweight champion in 1984.

===Holmes vs Spinks===

In 1985, Spinks beat David Sears and Jim McDonald, both by knockout, in title defenses, before challenging Larry Holmes for the IBF and lineal heavyweight championship. Holmes was trying to tie Rocky Marciano&#x27;s record of 49–0 as the heavyweight champion, but it was Spinks who made history that night, winning a controversial and narrow fifteen-round unanimous decision and becoming the first ever world light-heavyweight champion to win the world heavyweight title. His controversial victory over Holmes was named &quot;Ring Magazine&quot; Upset of the Year. With this, Michael and Leon had also become the first pair of brothers ever to be world heavyweight champions, followed two decades later by Wladimir and Vitali Klitschko.

===Heavyweight champion===

In 1986, Spinks and Holmes fought a rematch as part of the heavyweight unification series, and had nearly the same result, this time Spinks winning by a 15-round split decision. After that, he retained the world heavyweight championship once again, by a knockout in four against Steffen Tangstad. In 1987 he was stripped of the crown by the IBF for refusing to fight their mandatory challenger, Tony Tucker, and accepting a higher offer to fight Gerry Cooney instead. Spinks knocked out Cooney in five rounds, and after Mike Tyson had unified the heavyweight belts, fans started clamoring for a fight between them as many still recognized Spinks as the legitimate lineal champion.

===Spinks vs Tyson===

The fight between Spinks and Mike Tyson took place in June 1988, with Tyson knocking Spinks down twice on his way to a first-round knockout. Tyson and Dwight Muhammad Qawi were the only fighters to officially floor Spinks. It was Spinks&#x27;s first defeat in the professional ring, and his last, as he retired following the fight. In this fight he was badly affected by fear.

Spinks had a record of 31 wins and 0 losses, prior to the fight, with 21 wins by knockout as a professional, and still held The Ring magazine heavyweight title, and had a legitimate claim to the Lineal heavyweight championship, for he never had been beaten for his title before them being stripped from him. And he only lost recognition for both when he lost to Tyson.

In addition to his success as a heavyweight, Spinks is generally considered one of the greatest light-heavyweight champions and fighters of all time. He was the only light-heavyweight champion to remain undefeated in the entire history of the division since its inception in 1903 (until Joe Calzaghe), as well as the only reigning light-heavyweight champion to win the heavyweight title.

&quot;The Ring&quot; Magazine in 2002 ranked Spinks as the third greatest light-heavyweight of all time, behind Ezzard Charles and Archie Moore, but ahead of Tommy Loughran, Bob Foster, Harold Johnson, Maxie Rosenbloom and Billy Conn. Furthermore, Spinks did what no other light-heavyweight champion had ever done up to that point: move up to win the world heavyweight championship, by decisioning IBF champion Larry Holmes in 1985.

On &quot;The Ring&quot; Magazine&#x27;s list of 100 greatest punchers of all time, Spinks was ranked 42nd.

On &quot;The Ring&quot; Magazine&#x27;s list of the 80 Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years, released in 2002, Spinks ranked 41st.

East Side Boxing said in its tribute to Spinks, &quot;Michael Spinks went undefeated fighting during the deepest era in Light Heavyweight history. And he beat the real heavyweight champion to win the title, who was also undefeated. Michael Spinks is the most accomplished light heavyweight champion in history.&quot;

==Retirement and later years==

Spinks was once believed to be one of the few top fighters who left the sport of boxing with both a decent amount of money and being seemingly unharmed, free of permanent injuries. However he has shown signs of slurred speech since the 2020s, and he has been in litigation over the loss of his $24 million fortune. Aside from a rare event honoring him and occasionally attending fights, Spinks has largely remained off the boxing scene and out of the public eye.
Ken Hissner reported that, &quot;In October 2007 he was introduced into the ring at the Legendary Blue Horizon in Philadelphia. He seemed quite at home in the ring waving and talking to the fans.&quot;

Spinks lives on a five-acre spread in Greenville, Delaware. However, he has been known for visiting schools—carrying his gold medal and four title belts—where he tells kids to pursue their dreams. &quot;Most of the kids don&#x27;t have a clue who I am,&quot; he says, &quot;but they listen when they see all the gold.&quot;

For years he remained close to his former promoter, Butch Lewis, training fighters and making rare public appearances at events promoted by Lewis.

In 2011, however, after Lewis died from natural causes, it was reported that Spinks had sued Lewis&#x27;s estate in a Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that the promoter had failed to properly manage more than $24 million Spinks had earned in the ring and had violated their agreements that Lewis would continue to manage Spinks&#x27;s money and pay his living expenses for the rest of the boxer&#x27;s life. The lawsuit alleged that he commingled his personal funds with Spinks&#x27;s and used Spinks&#x27;s money to pay his and his children&#x27;s own personal and business expenses. Also named as a defendant was Robert L. Johnson, founder of Black Entertainment Television, head of the real estate firm of RLJ Development LLC, in Bethesda, Maryland, and one of the executors of Lewis&#x27;s $8.5 million estate.

According to Spinks&#x27;s lawyers, following Lewis&#x27;s death Johnson and attorney Leonard Williams stopped the payments without telling him, which in turn caused Spinks&#x27;s health insurance to lapse and bills totaling up to $50,000 a month to go unpaid. &quot;Spinks had to invade his pension and retirement funds and incur significant taxes and penalties in order to meet these obligations,&quot; the boxer&#x27;s lawyers added in the filings.

Spinks asked that the court bar Johnson and Williams from transferring any further assets from Lewis&#x27;s estate until there can be a full accounting and payments to Spinks are resumed.

<doc id="152262" wikidata="Q160569" url="?curid=152262" title="Will-o'-the-wisp">
<text>In folklore, a will-o&#x27;-the-wisp, will-o&#x27;-wisp, or ; ), is an atmospheric ghost light seen by travellers at night, especially over bogs, swamps or marshes.

The phenomenon is known in the United Kingdom by a variety of names, including [[jack-o&#x27;-lantern]], friar&#x27;s lantern, and hinkypunk, and is said to mislead and/or guide travellers by resembling a flickering lamp or lantern. Equivalents of the will-o&#x27;-the-wisps appear in European folklore by various names, e.g., in Latin, in French, or in Germany, Hessdalen light in Norway. Equivalents occur in traditions of cultures worldwide (cf. ); e.g., the Naga fireballs on the Mekong in Thailand. In North America the phenomenon is known as the Paulding Light in Upper Peninsula of Michigan, the Spooklight in Southwestern Missouri and Northeastern Oklahoma, and St. Louis Light in Saskatchewan. In Arab folklore it is known as .

In folklore, will-o&#x27;-the-wisps are typically attributed as ghosts, fairies or elemental spirits meant to reveal a path or direction. These wisps are portrayed as dancing or flowing in a static form, until noticed or followed, in which case they visually fade or disappear. Modern science explains the light aspect as natural phenomena such as bioluminescence or chemiluminescence, caused by the oxidation of phosphine (), diphosphane () and methane (), produced by organic decay.

==Nomenclature==
===Etymology===
The term &quot;will-o&#x27;-the-wisp&quot; comes from &quot;wisp&quot;, a bundle of sticks or paper sometimes used as a torch and the name &#x27;Will&#x27;, thus meaning &#x27;Will of the torch&#x27;. The term &quot;jack-o&#x27;-lantern&quot; (&#x27;Jack of the lantern&#x27;) originally referred to a will-o&#x27;-the-wisp. In the United States, they are often called &quot;spook-lights&quot;, &quot;ghost-lights&quot;, or &quot;orbs&quot; by folklorists.

The Latin name is composed of , meaning &#x27;fire&#x27; and , an adjective meaning &#x27;foolish&#x27;, &#x27;silly&#x27; or &#x27;simple&#x27;; it can thus be literally translated into English as &#x27;foolish fire&#x27; or more idiomatically as &#x27;giddy flame&#x27;. Despite its Latin origins, the term is not attested in antiquity, and the name for the will-o&#x27;-the-wisp used by the ancient Romans is uncertain. The term is not attested in the Middle Ages either. Instead, the Latin is documented no earlier than the 16th century in Germany, where it was coined by a German humanist, and appears to be a free translation of the long-existing German name (&#x27;wandering light&#x27; or &#x27;deceiving light&#x27;) conceived of in German folklore as a mischievous spirit of nature; the Latin translation was made to lend the German name intellectual credibility.

Beside , the will-o&#x27;-the-wisp has also been called in German (where translates to &#x27;wisp&#x27;), as found in e.g. Martin Luther&#x27;s writings of the same 16th century.

===Synonyms===
The names &quot;will-o&#x27;-the-wisp&quot; and &quot;jack-o&#x27;-lantern&quot; are used in etiological folk-tales, recorded in many variant forms in Ireland, Scotland, England, Wales, Appalachia, and Newfoundland.

Folk belief attributes the phenomenon explicitly in the term &quot;hob lantern&quot; or &quot;hobby lantern&quot; (var. &#x27;Hob and his Lantern&#x27;, &#x27;hob-and-lanthorns&quot;). In her book &quot;A Dictionary of Fairies,&quot; K. M. Briggs provides an extensive list of other names for the same phenomenon, though the place where they are observed (graveyard, bogs, etc.) influences the naming considerably. When observed in graveyards, it is known as a &quot;ghost candle&quot; or &quot;corpse candle&quot;.

==Folklore==
In the etiological (origin) tales, protagonists named either Will or Jack are doomed to haunt the marshes with a light for some misdeed. One version from Shropshire is recounted by Briggs in &quot;A Dictionary of Fairies&quot; and refers to Will Smith. Will is a wicked blacksmith who is given a second chance by Saint Peter at the gates of heaven, but leads such a bad life that he ends up being doomed to wander the earth. The Devil provides him with a single burning coal with which to warm himself, which he then uses to lure foolish travellers into the marshes.

An Irish version of the tale has a ne&#x27;er-do-well named Drunk Jack or Stingy Jack who, when the Devil comes to collect his soul, tricks him into turning into a coin, so he can pay for his one last drink. When the Devil obliges, Jack places him in his pocket next to a crucifix, preventing him from returning to his original form. In exchange for his freedom, the Devil grants Jack ten more years of life. When the term expires, the Devil comes to collect his due. But Jack tricks him again by making him climb a tree and then carving a cross underneath, preventing him from climbing down. In exchange for removing the cross, the Devil forgives Jack&#x27;s debt. However, no one as bad as Jack would ever be allowed into heaven, so Jack is forced upon his death to travel to hell and ask for a place there. The Devil denies him entrance in revenge but grants him an ember from the fires of hell to light his way through the twilight world to which lost souls are forever condemned. Jack places it in a carved turnip to serve as a lantern. Another version of the tale is &quot;Willy the Whisp&quot;, related in &quot;Irish Folktales&quot; by Henry Glassie. &quot;Séadna&quot; by Peadar Ua Laoghaire is yet another version—and also the first modern novel in the Irish language.

==Global folklore==
===Americas===
Mexico has equivalents. Folklore explains the phenomenon to be witches who transformed into these lights. Another explanation refers to the lights as indicators to places where gold or hidden treasures are buried which can be found only with the help of children. In this one, they are called luces del dinero (money lights) or luces del tesoro (treasure lights).

The swampy area of Massachusetts known as the Bridgewater Triangle has folklore of ghostly orbs of light, and there have been modern observations of these ghost-lights in this area as well.

The fifollet (or feu-follet) of Louisiana derives from the French. The legend says that the fifollet is a soul sent back from the dead to do God&#x27;s penance, but instead attacks people for vengeance. While it mostly takes part in harmless mischievous acts, the fifollet sometimes sucked the blood of children. Some legends say that it was the soul of a child who died before baptism.

Boi-tatá () is the Brazilian equivalent of the will-o&#x27;-the-wisp. Regionally it is called &quot;Boitatá&quot;, &quot;Baitatá&quot;, &quot;Batatá&quot;, &quot;Bitatá&quot;, &quot;Batatão&quot;, &quot;Biatatá&quot;, &quot;M&#x27;boiguaçu&quot;, &quot;Mboitatá&quot; and &quot;Mbaê-Tata&quot;. The name comes from the Old Tupi language and means &quot;fiery serpent&quot; (&quot;mboî tatá&quot;). Its great fiery eyes leave it almost blind by day, but by night, it can see everything. According to legend, Boi-tatá was a big serpent which survived a great deluge. A &quot;boiguaçu&quot; (cave anaconda) left its cave after the deluge and, in the dark, went through the fields preying on the animals and corpses, eating exclusively its favourite morsel, the eyes. The collected light from the eaten eyes gave &quot;Boitatá&quot; its fiery gaze. Not really a dragon but a giant snake (in the native language, &quot;boa&quot; or &quot;mboi&quot; or &quot;mboa&quot;).

In Argentina and Uruguay, the will-o&#x27;-the-wisp phenomenon is known as luz mala (&quot;evil light&quot;) and is one of the most important myths in both countries&#x27; folklore. This phenomenon is quite feared and is mostly seen in rural areas. It consists of an extremely shiny ball of light floating a few inches from the ground.

In Colombia, la Bolefuego or Candileja is the will-o&#x27;-the-wisp ghost of a vicious grandmother who raised her grandchildren without morals, and as such they became thieves and murderers. In the afterlife, the grandmother&#x27;s spirit was condemned to wander the world surrounded in flames. In Trinidad and Tobago, a soucouyant is a &quot;fireball witch&quot; — an evil spirit that takes on the form of a flame at night. It enters homes through any gap it can find and drinks the blood of its victims.

===Asia===
Aleya (or marsh ghost-light) is the name given to a strange light phenomenon occurring over the marshes as observed by Bengalis, especially the fishermen of Bangladesh and West Bengal. This marsh light is attributed to some kind of marsh gas apparitions that confuse fishermen, make them lose their bearings, and may even lead to drowning if one decided to follow them moving over the marshes. Local communities in the region believe that these strange hovering marsh-lights are in fact Ghost-lights representing the ghosts of fisherman who died fishing. Sometimes they confuse the fishermen, and sometimes they help them avoid future dangers. Chir batti (ghost-light), also spelled &quot;chhir batti&quot; or &quot;cheer batti&quot;, is a dancing light phenomenon occurring on dark nights reported from the Banni grasslands, its seasonal marshy wetlands and the adjoining desert of the marshy salt flats of the Rann of Kutch Other varieties (and sources) of ghost-lights appear in folklore across India, including the Kollivay Pey of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, the Kuliyande Choote of Kerala, and many variants from different tribes in Northeast India. In Kashmir, the Bramrachokh carries a pot of fire on its head.

Similar phenomena are described in Japanese folklore, including , &quot;hi no tama&quot; (&quot;ball of flame&quot;), &quot;aburagae&quot;, , &quot;ushionibi&quot;, etc. All these phenomena are described as associated with graveyards. Kitsune, mythical yokai demons, are also associated with will &#x27;o the wisp, with the marriage of two kitsune producing kitsune-bi (狐火), literally meaning &#x27;fox-fire&#x27;. These phenomena are described in Shigeru Mizuki&#x27;s 1985 book &quot;Graphic World of Japanese Phantoms&quot; (妖怪伝 in Japanese).

In Korea the lights are associated with rice paddies, old trees, mountains or even in some houses and were called &#x27;dokkebi bul’ (Hangul: 도깨비 불), meaning goblin fire (or goblin light). They were deemed malevolent and impish, as they confused and lured passersby to lose their way or fall into pits at night.

The earliest Chinese reference to a will-o&#x27;-the-wisp appears to be the Chinese character 粦 lín, attested as far back as the Shang dynasty oracle bones, depicting a human-like figure surrounded by dots presumably representing the glowing lights of the will-o&#x27;-the-wisp, to which feet such as those under 舞 wǔ, &#x27;to dance&#x27; were added in bronze script. Before the Han dynasty the top had evolved or been corrupted to represent fire (later further corrupted to resemble 米 mǐ, rice), as the small seal script graph in Shuowen Jiezi, compiled in the Han dynasty, shows. Although no longer in use alone, 粦 lín is in the character 磷 lín phosphorus, an element involved in scientific explanations of the will-o&#x27;-the-wisp phenomenon, and is also a phonetic component in other common characters with the same pronunciation.
Chinese polymath Shen Gua may have recorded such a phenomenon in the Book of Dreams, stating, &quot;In the middle of the reign of emperor Jia You, at Yanzhou, in the Jiangsu province, an enormous pearl was seen especially in gloomy weather. At first it appeared in the marsh… and disappeared finally in the Xinkai Lake.&quot; It was described as very bright, illuminating the surrounding countryside and was a reliable phenomenon over ten years, an elaborate Pearl Pavilion being built by local inhabitants for those who wished to observe it.

===Europe===
In European folklore the lights are often believed to be the spirits of un-baptised or stillborn children, flitting between heaven and hell (purgatory).

In Germany there was a belief that a &quot;Irrlicht&quot; was the soul of an unbaptised child, but that it could be redeemed if the remains are first buried near the eaves of the church, so that at the moment rainwater splashes onto this grave, the churchman could pronounce the baptismal formula to sanctify the child.

In Sweden also, the will-o&#x27;-the-wisp represents the soul of an unbaptised person &quot;trying to lead travellers to water in the hope of being baptized&quot;.

Danes, Finns, Swedes, Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians, and Irish people and amongst some other groups believed that a will-o&#x27;-the-wisp also marked the location of a treasure deep in ground or water, which could be taken only when the fire was there. Sometimes magical procedures, and even a dead man&#x27;s hand, were required as well, to uncover the treasure. In Finland and several other northern countries, it was believed that early autumn was the best time to search for will-o&#x27;-the-wisps and treasures below them. It was believed that when someone hid treasure in the ground, he made the treasure available only at the summer solstice (Midsummer, or Saint John&#x27;s Day), and set a will-o&#x27;-the-wisp to mark the exact place and time so that he could reclaim the treasure.

The Aarnivalkea (also known as virvatuli, aarretuli and aarreliekki), in Finnish mythology, are spots where an eternal flame associated with will-o&#x27;-the-wisps burns. They are claimed to mark the places where faerie gold is buried. They are protected by a glamour that would prevent anyone finding them by pure chance. However, if one finds a fern seed from a mythical flowering fern, the magical properties of that seed will lead the fortunate person to these treasures, in addition to providing one with a glamour of invisibility. Since in reality the fern produces no flower and reproduces via spores under the leaves, the myth specifies that it blooms only extremely rarely.

====Britain====
In Welsh folklore, it is said that the light is &quot;fairy fire&quot; held in the hand of a púca, or pwca, a small goblin-like fairy that mischievously leads lone travellers off the beaten path at night. As the traveller follows the púca through the marsh or bog, the fire is extinguished, leaving them lost. The púca is said to be one of the Tylwyth Teg, or fairy family. In Wales the light predicts a funeral that will take place soon in the locality. Wirt Sikes in his book &quot;British Goblins&quot; mentions the following Welsh tale about púca.

A peasant travelling home at dusk sees a bright light travelling along ahead of him. Looking closer, he sees that the light is a lantern held by a &quot;dusky little figure&quot;, which he follows for several miles. All of a sudden he finds himself standing on the edge of a vast chasm with a roaring torrent of water rushing below him. At that precise moment the lantern-carrier leaps across the gap, lifts the light high over its head, lets out a malicious laugh and blows out the light, leaving the poor peasant a long way from home, standing in pitch darkness at the edge of a precipice. This is a fairly common cautionary tale concerning the phenomenon; however, the ignis fatuus was not always considered dangerous. Some tales present the will-o&#x27;-the-wisp as a treasure-guardian, leading those brave enough to follow it to certain riches - a form of behaviour sometimes ascribed also to the Irish leprechaun. Other stories tell of travellers surprising a will-o&#x27;-the-wisp while lost in the woods and being either guided out or led further astray, depending on whether they treated the spirit kindly or harshly.

Also related, the pixy-light from Devon and Cornwall which leads travellers away from the safe and reliable route and into the bogs with glowing lights. &quot;Like Poltergeist they can generate uncanny sounds. They were less serious than their German Weiße Frauen kin, frequently blowing out candles on unsuspecting courting couples or producing obscene kissing sounds, which were always misinterpreted by parents.&quot; Pixy-Light was also associated with &quot;lambent light&quot; which the Old Norse might have seen guarding their tombs. In Cornish folklore, Pixy-Light also has associations with the Colt pixie. &quot;A colt pixie is a pixie that has taken the shape of a horse and enjoys playing tricks such as neighing at the other horses to lead them astray&quot;. In Guernsey, the light is known as the &quot;faeu boulanger&quot; (rolling fire), and is believed to be a lost soul. On being confronted with the spectre, tradition prescribes two remedies. The first is to turn one&#x27;s cap or coat inside out. This has the effect of stopping the &quot;faeu boulanger&quot; in its tracks. The other solution is to stick a knife into the ground, blade up. The faeu, in an attempt to kill itself, will attack the blade.

The will-o&#x27;-the-wisp was also known as the Spunkie in the Scottish Highlands where it would take the form of a linkboy (a boy who carried a flaming torch to light the way for pedestrians in exchange for a fee), or else simply a light that always seemed to recede, in order to lead unwary travellers to their doom. The spunkie has also been blamed for shipwrecks at night after being spotted on land and mistaken for a harbour light. Other tales of Scottish folklore regard these mysterious lights as omens of death or the ghosts of once living human beings. They often appeared over lochs or on roads along which funeral processions were known to travel. A strange light sometimes seen in the Hebrides is referred to as the &quot;teine sith&quot;, or &quot;fairy light&quot;, though there was no formal connection between it and the fairy race.

===Oceania===
The Australian equivalent, known as the Min Min light is reportedly seen in parts of the outback after dark. The majority of sightings are reported to have occurred in the Channel Country region.

Stories about the lights can be found in aboriginal myth pre-dating western settlement of the region and have since become part of wider Australian folklore. Indigenous Australians hold that the number of sightings has increased alongside the increasing ingression of Europeans into the region. According to folklore, the lights sometimes followed or approached people and have disappeared when fired upon, only to reappear later on.

==Scientific explanations==

Science proposes that will-o&#x27;-the-wisp phenomena (ignis fatuus) are caused by the oxidation of phosphine (PH3), diphosphane (P2H4), and methane (CH4). These compounds, produced by organic decay, can cause photon emissions. Since phosphine and diphosphane mixtures spontaneously ignite on contact with the oxygen in air, only small quantities of it would be needed to ignite the much more abundant methane to create ephemeral fires. Furthermore, phosphine produces phosphorus pentoxide as a by-product, which forms phosphoric acid upon contact with water vapor, which can explain &quot;viscous moisture&quot; sometimes described as accompanying ignis fatuus.

===Historical explanations===
The idea of the will-o&#x27;-the-wisp phenomena being caused by natural gases can be found as early as 1596, as mentioned in the works of Ludwig Lavater. In 1776 Alessandro Volta first proposed that natural electrical phenomena (like lightning) interacting with methane marsh gas may be the cause of ignis fatuus. This was supported by the British polymath Joseph Priestley in his series of works &quot;Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air&quot; (1772–1790); and by the French physicist Pierre Bertholon de Saint-Lazare in &quot;De l&#x27;électricité des météores&quot; (1787).

Early critics of the marsh gas hypothesis often dismissed it on various grounds including the unlikeliness of spontaneous combustion, the absence of warmth in some observed ignis fatuus, the odd behavior of ignis fatuus receding upon being approached, and the differing accounts of ball lightning (which was also classified as a kind of ignis fatuus). An example of such criticism is found in &quot;Folk-Lore from Buffalo Valley&quot; (1891) by the American anthropologist John G. Owens.

The apparent retreat of ignis fatuus upon being approached might be explained simply by the agitation of the air by nearby moving objects, causing the gases to disperse. This was observed in the very detailed accounts of several close interactions with ignis fatuus published earlier in 1832 by Major Louis Blesson after a series of experiments in various localities where they were known to occur. Of note is his first encounter with ignis fatuus in a marshland between a deep valley in the forest of Gorbitz, Newmark, Germany. Blesson observed that the water was covered by an iridescent film, and during day-time, bubbles could be observed rising abundantly from certain areas. At night, Blesson observed bluish-purple flames in the same areas and concluded that it was connected to the rising gas. He spent several days investigating the phenomenon, finding to his dismay that the flames retreated every time he tried to approach them. He eventually succeeded and was able to confirm that the lights were indeed caused by ignited gas. The British scientist Charles Tomlinson in &quot;On Certain Low-Lying Meteors&quot; (1893) described Blesson&#x27;s experiments.

Blesson also observed differences in the colour and heat of the flames in different marshes. The ignis fatuus in Malapane, Upper Silesia (now Ozimek, Poland) could be ignited and extinguished, but were unable to burn pieces of paper or wood shavings. Similarly, the ignis fatuus in another forest in Poland coated pieces of paper and wood shavings with an oily viscous fluid instead of burning them. Blesson also accidentally created ignis fatuus in the marshes of Porta Westfalica, Germany, while launching fireworks.

====20th century====
A description of &#x27;The Will-o&#x27;-the Wisp appeared in a 1936 UK publication of &quot;The Scout&#x27;s Book of Gadgets and Dodges&quot;, where the author (Sam F. Braham), describes it as follows:

&#x27;This is an uncertain light which may sometimes be seen dancing over churchyards and marshy places. No one really know how it is produced, and chemists are continually experimenting to discover its nature. It is thought that it is formed by the mixing of marsh gas, which is giving off decaying vegetable matter, with phosphoretted hydrogen, a gas which ignites instantly. But this theory has not been definitely proved.&#x27;
One attempt to replicate ignis fatuus under laboratory conditions was in 1980 by British geologist Alan A. Mills of Leicester University. Though he did succeed in creating a cool glowing cloud by mixing crude phosphine and natural gas, the color of the light was green and it produced copious amounts of acrid smoke. This was contrary to most eyewitness accounts of ignis fatuus. As an alternative, Mills proposed in 2000 that ignis fatuus may instead be cold flames. These are luminescent pre-combustion halos that occur when various compounds are heated to just below ignition point. Cold flames are indeed typically bluish in color and as their name suggests, they generate very little heat. Cold flames occur in a wide variety of compounds, including hydrocarbons (including methane), alcohols, aldehydes, oils, acids, and even waxes. However it is unknown if cold flames occur naturally, though a lot of compounds which exhibit cold flames are the natural byproducts of organic decay.

A related hypothesis involves the natural chemiluminescence of phosphine. In 2008 the Italian chemists Luigi Garlaschelli and Paolo Boschetti attempted to recreate Mills&#x27; experiments. They successfully created a faint cool light by mixing phosphine with air and nitrogen. Though the glow was still greenish in colour, Garlaschelli and Boschetti noted that under low-light conditions, the human eye cannot easily distinguish between colours. Furthermore, by adjusting the concentrations of the gases and the environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.), it was possible to eliminate the smoke and smell, or at least render it to undetectable levels. Garlaschelli and Boschetti also agreed with Mills that cold flames may also be a plausible explanation for other instances of ignis fatuus.

In 1993 professors Derr and Persinger proposed that some ignis fatuus may be geologic in origin, piezoelectrically generated under tectonic strain. The strains that move faults would also heat up the rocks, vaporizing the water in them. Rock or soil containing something piezoelectric, like quartz, silicon, or arsenic, may also produce electricity, channelled up to the surface through the soil via a column of vaporized water, there somehow appearing as earth lights. This would explain why the lights appear electrical, erratic, or even intelligent in their behaviour.

The will-o&#x27;-the-wisp phenomena may occur due to the bioluminescence of various forest dwelling micro-organisms and insects. The eerie glow emitted from certain fungal species, such as the honey fungus, during chemical reactions to form white rot could be mistaken for the mysterious will-o&#x27;-the-wisp or foxfire lights. There are many other bioluminescent organisms that could create the illusions of fairy lights, such as fireflies. Light reflecting off larger forest dwelling creatures could explain the phenomenon of will-o&#x27;-the-wisp moving and reacting to other lights. The white plumage of barn owls may reflect enough light from the Moon to appear as a will-o&#x27;-the-wisp; hence the possibility of the lights moving, reacting to other lights, etc.

Ignis fatuus sightings are rarely reported today. The decline is believed to be the result of the draining and reclamation of swamplands in recent centuries, such as the formerly vast Fenlands of eastern England which have now been converted to farmlands.

<text>Richard Gary Brautigan (January 30, 1935) was an American novelist, poet, and short story writer. A prolific writer, he wrote throughout his life and published ten novels, two collections of short stories, and four books of poetry. Brautigan&#x27;s work has been published both in the United States and internationally throughout Europe, Japan, and China. He is best known for his novels &quot;Trout Fishing in America&quot; (1967), &quot;In Watermelon Sugar&quot; (1968), and &quot;The Abortion: An Historical Romance 1966&quot; (1971).

==Early life==
Brautigan was born in Tacoma, Washington, the only child of Bernard Frederick &quot;Ben&quot; Brautigan Jr. (July 29, 1908May 27, 1994), a factory worker and laborer, and Lulu Mary &quot;Mary Lou&quot; Keho (April 7, 1911September 24, 2005), a waitress. In May 1934, eight months before Richard&#x27;s birth, Bernard and Mary Lou separated. 

Brautigan said that he met his biological father only twice. But after Richard&#x27;s death, Bernard appeared to have been unaware that Richard was his child, saying, &quot;He&#x27;s got the same last name, but why would they wait 45 to 50 years to tell me I&#x27;ve got a son?&quot;

In 1938, Brautigan and his mother began living with Arthur Martin Titland. The couple had a daughter, Barbara Ann, born on May 1, 1939, in Tacoma. Brautigan said that he had a very traumatic experience when, at age nine, his mother left him and his four-year-old sister unattended in a motel room in Great Falls, Montana, for two days.

On January 20, 1943, Mary Lou married fry cook Robert Geoffrey Porterfield. The couple had a daughter named Sandra Jean, born April 1, 1945, at Salem General Hospital in Salem, Oregon. Mary Lou told Brautigan that Porterfield was his biological father, and Brautigan began using &quot;Richard Gary Porterfield&quot; as his name. 

Mary Lou separated from Porterfield in 1946. She married William David Folston Sr. on June 12, 1950. The couple had a son named William David Jr., born on December 19, 1950, in Eugene. Brautigan said that Folston was a violent alcoholic, whom Richard had seen abusing his mother.

Brautigan was raised in poverty; he told his daughter stories of his mother sifting rat feces out of their supply of flour before making flour-and-water pancakes. Brautigan&#x27;s family found it difficult to obtain food, and on some occasions they did not eat for days. The family lived on welfare and moved about the Pacific Northwest for nine years before settling in Eugene, Oregon, in August 1944. 

Brautigan drew from his childhood in the poems and stories that he wrote from as early as the age of 12. His novel &quot;So the Wind Won&#x27;t Blow It All Away&quot; (1982) is loosely based on childhood events, including an incident in which Brautigan accidentally shot the brother of a close friend in the ear, injuring him slightly.

On September 12, 1950, Brautigan enrolled at South Eugene High School. He wrote for his high school newspaper, the &quot;Eugene High School News&quot;. He also played on the school&#x27;s basketball team. He was tall by the time of his graduation. On December 19, 1952, Brautigan&#x27;s first published poem, &quot;The Light&quot;, appeared in the school newspaper. Brautigan graduated with honors from Eugene High School on June 9, 1953. 

After graduation, he moved in with his best friend Peter Webster, and Peter&#x27;s mother Edna Webster became a surrogate mother to Brautigan. According to several accounts, Brautigan stayed with the Websters for about a year before leaving for San Francisco for the first time in August 1954. He returned to Oregon several times, apparently for lack of money.

On December 14, 1955, Brautigan was arrested for throwing a rock through a police station window, supposedly to be sent to prison and fed. He was arrested for disorderly conduct and fined $25. He was committed to the Oregon State Hospital on December 24, 1955, after police noticed patterns of erratic behavior.

At the Oregon State Hospital Brautigan was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and clinical depression, and was treated with electroconvulsive therapy 12 times. While institutionalized, he began writing &quot;The God of the Martians&quot;, a manuscript of 20 very short chapters totaling 600 words. The manuscript was sent to at least two editors but was rejected by both, and remains unpublished. (A copy of the manuscript was recently discovered with the papers of the last of those editors, Harry Hooton.) 

On February 19, 1956, Brautigan was released from the hospital and briefly lived with his mother, stepfather, and siblings in Eugene. He left for San Francisco, where he would spend most of the rest of his life except for periods in Tokyo and Montana.

==Career==
In San Francisco, Brautigan sought to establish himself as a writer. He was known for handing out his poetry on the streets and performing at poetry clubs. In early 1956, Brautigan typed a three-page manuscript and sent it to Macmillan Inc. for publication. The manuscript consisted of two pages with 14 poems and a page with the dedication &quot;for Linda&quot;. Of the poems, only &quot;stars&quot; and &quot;hey&quot; were titled. In a letter dated May 10, 1956, Macmillan rejected the manuscript, stating, &quot;... there is no place where it will fit in&quot;. In 2005, the X-Ray Book Company published the manuscript as a chapbook titled &quot;Desire in a Bowl of Potatoes&quot;.

Brautigan&#x27;s first poetry book publication was &quot;The Return of the Rivers&quot; (1957), a single poem, followed by two collections of poetry: &quot;The Galilee Hitch-Hiker&quot; (1958) and &quot;Lay the Marble Tea&quot; (1959). During the 1960s Brautigan became involved in the burgeoning San Francisco counterculture scene, often appearing as a performance poet at concerts and participating in the various activities of The Diggers. He contributed several short pieces to be used as broadsides by the Communication Company. Brautigan was also a writer for &quot;Change&quot;, an underground newspaper created by Ron Loewinsohn.

In the summer of 1961, while camping in southern Idaho with his wife and daughter Ianthe, Brautigan completed the novels &quot;A Confederate General from Big Sur&quot; and &quot;Trout Fishing in America.&quot; &quot;A Confederate General from Big Sur&quot; was his debut novel, published in 1964, and met with little critical or commercial success. 

But when &quot;Trout Fishing in America&quot; was published in 1967, Brautigan was catapulted to international fame. Literary critics labeled him the writer most representative of the emerging countercultural youth movement of the late 1960s, even though he was said to be contemptuous of hippies. &quot;Trout Fishing in America&quot; has sold over 4 million copies worldwide. 

With his earnings, Brautigan bought a house in Bolinas and a ranch in Montana. He and his wife had separated when their daughter was two, and Ianthe lived mostly with him until she married.

During the 1960s Brautigan published four collections of poetry as well as another novel, &quot;In Watermelon Sugar&quot; (1968). In the spring of 1967 he was Poet-in-Residence at the California Institute of Technology. During this year, his chapbook, &quot;All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace&quot;, was published by The Communication Company. It was printed in an edition of 1,500 copies and distributed free. 

From 1968 to 1970 Brautigan had 23 short pieces published in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. From late 1968 to February 1969, Brautigan recorded a spoken-word album for The Beatles&#x27; short-lived record-label, Zapple. The label was shut down by Allen Klein before the recording could be released. It was released in 1970 on Harvest Records as &quot;Listening to Richard Brautigan&quot;.

In the 1970s Brautigan experimented with literary genres. He published five novels (the first of which, &quot;The Abortion: An Historical Romance 1966&quot;, had been written in the mid-1960s) and a collection of short stories, &quot;Revenge of the Lawn&quot; (1971). In 1974 The Cowell Press collected seven of his broadside poems into the book &quot;Seven Watermelon Suns&quot;. The limited edition of ten copies included embossed color etchings by Ellen Meske. 

&quot;When the 1960s ended, he was the baby thrown out with the bath water,&quot; said his friend and fellow writer, Thomas McGuane. &quot;He was a gentle, troubled, deeply odd guy.&quot; Generally dismissed by literary critics and increasingly abandoned by his readers, Brautigan found his popularity waned throughout the late 1970s and 1980s. His work remained popular in Europe, however, as well as in Japan, where Brautigan visited several times. 

To some of his critics, Brautigan was naive. Lawrence Ferlinghetti said of him, &quot;As an editor I was always waiting for Richard to grow up as a writer. It seems to me he was essentially a naïf, and I don&#x27;t think he cultivated that childishness, I think it came naturally. It was like he was much more in tune with the trout in America than with people.&quot;

Brautigan&#x27;s writings are characterized by a remarkable and humorous imagination. The permeation of inventive metaphors lent even his prose works the feeling of poetry. Evident also are themes of Zen Buddhism, such as the duality of the past and the future and the impermanence of the present. Brautigan&#x27;s last publication before his death in 1984 was his novel &quot;So the Wind Won&#x27;t Blow It All Away&quot; (1982).

&quot;The Edna Webster Collection of Undiscovered Writings&quot; was published in 1999. Brautigan, then twenty-one, had given this collection of writings to Edna Webster in 1955, when he left Oregon for San Francisco.

In 2002, a proposed edition of Brautigan&#x27;s collected poems was rejected by his estate. In November 2016 the French publisher Le Castor Astral published a bilingual edition entitled &quot;Tout ce que j&#x27;ai à déclarer: œuvre poétique complète.&quot;

==Personal life==
On June 8, 1957, Brautigan married Virginia Dionne Alder in Reno, Nevada. The couple had one daughter together, Ianthe Elizabeth Brautigan, born on March 25, 1960, in San Francisco. Brautigan&#x27;s alcoholism and depression caused him to become increasingly abusive and Alder ended the relationship on December 24, 1962, though the divorce was not finalized until July 28, 1970. Brautigan continued to reside in San Francisco after the separation, while Alder settled in Manoa, Hawaii, and became a feminist and an anti-Vietnam War activist.

Brautigan remarried on December 1, 1977, to the Japanese-born Akiko Yoshimura, whom he met in July 1976 while living in Tokyo. The couple settled in Pine Creek, Park County, Montana, for two years. Brautigan and Yoshimura divorced in 1980.

Brautigan had a relationship with Marcia Clay of San Francisco from 1981 to 1982. He also pursued a brief relationship with Janice Meissner, a woman from the North Beach community of San Francisco. Other relationships were with Marcia Pacaud, who appears on the cover of &quot;The Pill Versus the Springhill Mine Disaster&quot;; Valerie Estes, who appears on the cover of &quot;Listening to Richard Brautigan&quot;; and Sherry Vetter, who appears on the cover of &quot;Revenge of the Lawn&quot;.

Brautigan was an alcoholic throughout his adult life; according to his daughter, he often mentioned suicide over a period of more than a decade before ending his life.

==Death==

In 1984, at age 49, Richard Brautigan had moved to Bolinas, California, where he was living alone in a large, old house that he had bought with his earnings years earlier. He died of a self-inflicted .44 Magnum gunshot wound to the head. His decomposed body was found by David Fechheimer, a friend and private investigator, on October 25, 1984. The body was found on the living room floor, in front of a large window that, though shrouded by trees, looked out over the Pacific Ocean. Due to the decomposition of the body it is speculated that Brautigan had ended his life over a month earlier, on September 16, 1984, days after talking to friend Marcia Clay on the telephone (neighbors heard a loud noise that Sunday while watching an NFL game). Brautigan was survived by his parents, both ex-wives, and his daughter Ianthe.

According to Michael Caines, writing in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, the story that Brautigan left a suicide note that simply read: &quot;Messy, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; is apocryphal. Ianthe Brautigan has confirmed that her father did not leave such a message. Brautigan once wrote, &quot;All of us have a place in history. Mine is clouds.&quot;

==Legacy==
Because Brautigan frequently wrote in first-person and included locations and events with which he is associated, readers might assume his work is autobiographical. Writing in 1972, Long Island University professor Terrence Malley points out that &quot;Brautigan&#x27;s books are for the most part both directly autobiographical and curiously elusive . . . It&#x27;s usually difficult to separate confession from whimsy in Brautigan&#x27;s writing&quot; (18).

Several later authors have cited Brautigan as an influence, including Haruki Murakami, W. P. Kinsella, Christopher Moore and Sarah Hall.

The Library for Unpublished Works envisioned by Brautigan in his novel &quot;The Abortion&quot; was housed at the Brautigan Library in Burlington, Vermont, until 1995 when it was moved to the nearby Fletcher Free Library where it remained until 2005. Although there were plans to move it to the Presidio branch of the San Francisco Public Library, these never materialized. However, after an agreement was made between Brautigan&#x27;s daughter, Ianthe Brautigan, and the Clark County Historical Museum (in Vancouver, Washington), the Brautigan Library was moved to the museum in 2010.

The industrial rock band Machines of Loving Grace took its name from one of Brautigan&#x27;s poems. The album &quot;Boo, Forever&quot; by indie rock band Field Guides takes its title from the Brautigan poem of the same name.

In March 1994, a teenager named Peter Eastman Jr. from Carpinteria, California, legally changed his name to Trout Fishing in America, and now teaches English at Waseda University in Japan.

In March 2018, poet Francis Daulerio published &quot;Please Plant This Book&quot; – a reinterpretation of and homage to Brautigan&#x27;s book of the same name on its 50th anniversary. The publication contained seeds to be planted, packed in sleeves which carry poems by Daulerio and illustrations by Scott Hutchison. Profits from the book were to go to The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Hutchison took his own life in May 2018, and in September an expanded version was published as a chapbook, the original edition having sold out, containing a foreword by Ianthe Brautigan and an afterword by Scottish poet Michael Pedersen.

The music video for Kat Meoz&#x27;s &quot;Here I Wait&quot; directed by Kansas Bowling recreates Brautigan&#x27;s book covers and features the only footage in existence of the actual Willard which inspired &quot;Willard and His Bowling Trophies&quot;.

<doc id="152271" wikidata="Q731635" url="?curid=152271" title="Mount Vernon">
<text>Mount Vernon is the former residence and plantation of George Washington, a Founding Father, commander of the Continental Army in the Revolutionary War, and the first president of the United States, and his wife, Martha. An American landmark, the estate lies on the banks of the Potomac River in Fairfax County, Virginia, approximately 15 miles south of Washington, D.C..

The Washington family acquired land in the area in 1674. Around 1734, the family embarked on an expansion of its estate that continued under George Washington, who began leasing the estate in 1754 before becoming its sole owner in 1761.

The mansion was built of wood in a loose Palladian style; the original house was built in about 1734 by George Washington&#x27;s father Augustine Washington. George Washington expanded the house twice, once in the late 1750s and again in the 1770s. It remained Washington&#x27;s home for the rest of his life. Following his death in 1799, the estate progressively declined under the ownership of several successive generations of the family as revenues were insufficient to maintain it adequately.

In 1858, the house&#x27;s historical importance was recognized and was taken over by the Mount Vernon Ladies&#x27; Association, along with part of the Washington property estate. The mansion and its surrounding buildings escaped damage from the American Civil War, which damaged many properties in the Confederate States of America during the Civil War.

Mount Vernon was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is still owned and maintained in trust by the Mount Vernon Ladies&#x27; Association, being open to the public daily in recognition of George Washington&#x27;s 1794 acknowledgement of public interest in his estate: &quot;I have no objection to any sober or orderly person&#x27;s gratifying their curiosity in viewing the buildings, Gardens, &amp;ca. about Mount Vernon.&quot;

== Name ==
When George Washington&#x27;s ancestors acquired the estate, it was known as Little Hunting Creek Plantation, named after the nearby Little Hunting Creek. When Washington&#x27;s older half-brother, Lawrence Washington, inherited it, he renamed it after Edward Vernon, a vice admiral and his commanding officer during the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear who captured Portobelo from the Spanish. When George Washington inherited the property, he retained the name.

==Buildings and grounds==

The estate contained when George Washington lived there. As of 2011, the property consists of , including the mansion and over 30 other buildings near the riverfront.

===Architecture===
Construction on the present mansion at Mount Vernon began in approximately 1734 and was built in incremental stages by an unknown architect under the supervision of Augustine Washington. This staggered and unplanned evolution is indicated by the off-center main door. As completed and seen today, the house is in a loose Palladian style. The principal block, dating from about 1734, was a one-story house with a garret. In the 1750s, the roof was raised to a full second story and a third floor garret. There were also one-story extensions added to the north and south ends of the house; these were torn down during the next building phase. The present day mansion is .

In 1774, the second expansion began. A two-story wing was added to the south side. Two years later a large two-story room was added to the north side. Two single-story secondary wings were built in 1775. These secondary wings, which house the servants hall on the northern side and the kitchen on the southern side, are connected to the &quot;corps de logis&quot; by symmetrical, quadrant colonnades, built in 1778. The completion of the colonnades cemented the classical Palladian arrangement of the complex and formed a distinct &quot;cour d&#x27;honneur&quot;, known at Mount Vernon as Mansion Circle, giving the house its imposing perspective.

The &quot;corps de logis&quot; has a hipped roof with dormers and the secondary wings have gable roofs with dormers. In addition to its second story, the importance of the &quot;corps de logis&quot; is further emphasized by two large chimneys piercing the roof and by a cupola surmounting the center of the house; this octagonal focal point has a short spire topped by a gilded dove of peace. This placement of the cupola is more in the earlier Carolean style than Palladian and was probably incorporated to improve ventilation of the enlarged attic and enhance the overall symmetry of the structure and the two wings; a similar cupola crowns the Governor&#x27;s House at Williamsburg, of which Washington would have been aware.

Though no architect is known to have designed Mount Vernon, some attribute the design to John Ariss, a prominent Virginia architect who designed Paynes Church in Fairfax County (now destroyed) and likely Mount Airy in Richmond County. Other sources credit Colonel Richard Blackburn, who also designed Rippon Lodge in Prince William County and the first Falls Church. Blackburn&#x27;s granddaughter Anne married Bushrod Washington, George&#x27;s nephew, and is interred at the Washingtons&#x27; tomb on the grounds. Most architectural historians believe that the design of Mount Vernon is solely attributable to Washington alone and that the involvement of any other architects is based on conjecture.

=== Interior ===

The rooms at Mount Vernon have mostly been restored to their appearance at the time of George and Martha Washington&#x27;s occupancy. Rooms include Washington&#x27;s study, two dining rooms, the larger of which is known as the New Room, the West Parlour, the Front Parlour, the kitchen and some bedrooms.

The interior design follows the classical concept of the exterior, but owing to the mansion&#x27;s piecemeal evolution, the internal architectural featuresthe doorcases, mouldings and plasterworkare not consistently faithful to one specific period of the 18th-century revival of classical architecture. Instead they range from Palladianism to a finer and later neoclassicism in the style of Robert Adam. This varying of the classical style is best exemplified in the doorcases and surrounds of the principal rooms. In the West Parlour and Small Dining rooms there are doorcases complete with ionic columns and full pediments, whereas in the hall and passageways the doors are given broken pediments supported by an architrave. Many of the rooms are lined with painted panelling and have ceilings ornamented by plasterwork in a Neoclassical style; much of this plasterwork can be attributed to an English craftsman, John Rawlins, who arrived from London in 1771 bringing with him the interior design motifs then fashionable in the British capital.

Visitors to Mount Vernon now see Washington&#x27;s study, a room to which in the 18th century only a privileged few were granted entry. This simply furnished room has a combined bathroom, dressing room and office; the room was so private that few contemporary descriptions exist. Its walls are lined with naturally grained paneling and matching bookcases. In contrast to the privacy of the study, since Washington&#x27;s time, the grandest, most public and principal reception room has been the so-called New Room or Large Dining Rooma two-storied salon notable for its large Palladian window, occupying the whole of the mansion&#x27;s northern elevation, and its fine Neoclassical marble chimneypiece. The history of this chimneypiece to some degree explains the overall restrained style of the house. When it was donated to Washington by English merchant Samuel Vaughan, Washington was initially reluctant to accept the gift, stating that it was &quot;too elegant &amp; costly I fear for my own room, &amp; republican stile of living.&quot;

Efforts have been made to restore the rooms and maintain the atmosphere of the 18th century; this has been achieved by using original color schemes and by displaying furniture, carpets and decorative objects which are contemporary to the house. The rooms contain portraits and former possessions of George Washington and his family.

=== Grounds ===
The gardens and grounds contain English boxwoods, taken from cuttings sent by Major General Henry Lee III a Governor of Virginia and the father of Robert E. Lee, which were planted in 1786 by George Washington and now crowd the entry path. A carriage road skirts a grassy bowling green to approach the mansion entrance. To each side of the green is a garden contained by red brick walls. These Colonial Revival gardens grew the household&#x27;s vegetables, fruit and other perishable items for consumption. The upper garden, located to the north, is bordered by the greenhouse. Ha-ha walls are used to separate the working farm from the pleasure grounds that Washington created for his family and guests. The overseer&#x27;s quarter, spinning room, salt house, and gardener&#x27;s house are between the upper garden and the mansion.

The lower garden, or southern garden, is bordered on the east by the storehouse and clerk&#x27;s quarters, smokehouse, wash house, laundry yard, and coach house. A paddock and stable are on the southern border of the garden; east of them, a little down the hillside, is the icehouse. The original tomb is located along the river. The newer tomb in which the bodies of George and Martha Washington have rested since 1831 is south of the fruit garden; the slave burial ground is nearby, a little farther down the hillside. A &quot;Forest Trail&quot; runs through woods down to a recreated pioneer farm site on low ground near the river; the working farm includes a re-creation of Washington&#x27;s 16-sided treading barn.

A museum and education center are on the grounds and exhibit examples of Washington&#x27;s survey equipment, weapons, and clothing, and the dentures worn by Washington as the first U.S. president. In 2013, the Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington opened on Mount Vernon; the library, which is open for scholarship by appointment only, fosters new scholarship about George Washington and safeguards original Washington books and manuscripts.

== History ==
=== Washington family ===
In 1674, John Washington, the great-grandfather of George Washington, and Nicholas Spencer came into possession of the land from which Mount Vernon plantation would be carved, originally known by its Piscataway name of &quot;Epsewasson&quot;. The successful patent on the acreage was largely executed by Spencer, who acted as agent for his cousin Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper, the English landowner who controlled the Northern Neck of Virginia, in which the tract lay.

When John Washington died in 1677, his son Lawrence, George Washington&#x27;s grandfather, inherited his father&#x27;s stake in the property. In 1690, he agreed to formally divide the estimated 5,000 acre (20 km2) estate with the heirs of Nicholas Spencer, who had died the previous year. The Spencers took the larger southern half bordering Dogue Creek in the September 1674 land grant from Lord Culpeper, leaving the Washingtons the portion along Little Hunting Creek. The Spencer heirs paid Lawrence Washington of tobacco as compensation for their choice.

Lawrence Washington died in 1698, bequeathing the property to his daughter Mildred. On 16 April 1726, she agreed to a one-year lease on the estate to her brother Augustine Washington, George Washington&#x27;s father, for a peppercorn rent; a month later the lease was superseded by Augustine&#x27;s purchase of the property for £180. He built the original house on the site around 1734, when he and his family moved from Pope&#x27;s Creek to Eppsewasson, which he renamed Little Hunting Creek. The original stone foundations of what appears to have been a two-roomed house with a further two rooms in a half-story above are still partially visible in the present house&#x27;s cellar.

Augustine Washington recalled his eldest son, Lawrence, George&#x27;s half-brother, home from school in England in 1738, and set him up on the family&#x27;s Little Hunting Creek tobacco plantation, thereby allowing Augustine to move his family back to Fredericksburg at the end of 1739. In 1739, Lawrence, having reached 21 years of age, began buying up parcels of land from the adjoining Spencer tract, starting with a plot around the grist mill on Dogue Creek. In mid-1740, Lawrence received a coveted officer&#x27;s commission in the British Army and made preparations to go off to war in the Caribbean with the newly formed American Regiment to fight in the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear. He served under Admiral Edward Vernon; returning home, he named his estate after his commander.

=== George Washington ===

Lawrence died in 1752, and his will stipulated that his widow should own a life estate in Mount Vernon, the remainder interest falling to his half-brother George; George Washington was already living at Mount Vernon and probably managing the plantation. Lawrence&#x27;s widow, Anne Fairfax, remarried into the Lee family and moved out. Following the death of Anne and Lawrence&#x27;s only surviving child in 1754, George, as executor of his brother&#x27;s estate leased his sister-in-law&#x27;s estate. Upon the death of Anne Fairfax in 1761, he succeeded to the remainder interest and became sole owner of the property.

In 1758, Washington began the first of two major additions and improvements by raising the house to two-and-a-half stories. The second expansion was begun during the 1770s, shortly before the outbreak of the Revolutionary War. Washington had rooms added to the north and south ends, unifying the whole with the addition of the cupola and two-story piazza overlooking the Potomac River. The final expansion increased the mansion to 21 rooms and an area of 11,028 square feet. The great majority of the work was performed by enslaved African Americans and artisans.

==== Agriculture and enterprise ====

George Washington expanded the estate by purchasing surrounding parcels of land beginning in the late 1750s and was still adding to the estate into the 1780s, including the River Farm estate. From 1759 until the Revolutionary War, Washington, who at the time aspired to become a prominent agriculturist, had five separate farms as part of his estate. He took a scientific approach to farming and kept extensive and meticulous records of both labor and results.

In a letter dated 20 September 1765, Washington writes about receiving poor returns for his tobacco production:

In the same letter he asks about the prices of flax and hemp, with a view to their production:

The tobacco market declined, and many planters in Northern Virginia converted to mixed crops. By 1766, Washington ceased growing tobacco at Mount Vernon and replaced the crop with wheat, corn, and other grains. Besides hemp and flax, he experimented with 60 other crops including cotton and silk. He also derived income from a gristmill which produced cornmeal and flour for export and also ground neighbors&#x27; grain for fees. Washington similarly sold the services of the estate&#x27;s looms and blacksmith.

Washington built and operated a small fishing fleet, permitting Mount Vernon to export fish. Washington practiced the selective breeding of sheep in an effort to produce better quality wool. He was not as invested in animal husbandry as he was in cropping experiments, which were elaborate and included complex field rotations, nitrogen fixing crops and a range of soil amendments. The Washington household consumed a wider range of protein sources than was typical for the Chesapeake population of his day, which consumed a great deal of beef.

The new crops were less labor-intensive than tobacco; hence, the estate had a surplus of slaves. But Washington refused to break up families for sale. Washington began to hire skilled indentured servants from Europe to train the redundant slaves for service on and off the estate.
Following his service in the war, Washington returned to Mount Vernon and in 1785–1786 spent a great deal of effort improving the landscaping of the estate. It is estimated that during his two terms as President of the United States (1789–1797), Washington spent a total of 434 days in residence at Mount Vernon. After his presidency, Washington tended to repairs to the buildings, socializing, and further gardening. In 1797, farm manager James Anderson, a recent Scottish immigrant, suggested the establishment of a whisky distillery, which proved to be the estate&#x27;s most profitable business venture over the decade of its operation.

====George Washington&#x27;s will====
In his will, written several months before his death in December 1799, George Washington left directions for the emancipation of all the slaves who belonged to him. Of the 317 slaves at Mount Vernon in 1799, a little less than half, 123 individuals, belonged to George Washington. Under the terms of his will, these slaves were to be set free upon Martha Washington&#x27;s death.

In accordance with state law, George Washington stipulated in his will that elderly slaves or those who were too sick to work were to be supported throughout their lives by his estate. Children without parents, or those whose families were too poor or indifferent to see to their education, were to be bound out (or apprenticed) to masters and mistresses who would teach them reading, writing, and a useful trade, until they were ultimately freed at the age of twenty-five.

When Martha Washington&#x27;s first husband, Daniel Parke Custis, died without a will, she received a life interest in one-third of his estate, including the slaves. Neither George nor Martha Washington could free these slaves by law. Upon Martha&#x27;s death, these slaves reverted to the Custis estate and were divided among her grandchildren. By 1799, 153 slaves at Mount Vernon were part of this dower property.

Martha signed a deed of manumission in December 1800. Abstracts of court records in Fairfax County, Virginia record this transaction. The slaves received their freedom on January 1, 1801.

== Washington&#x27;s tomb ==
On December 12, 1799, Washington spent several hours riding over the plantation, in snow, sleet, and freezing rain. He ate his supper later that evening without changing from his wet clothes. The following day, he awoke with a severe sore throat (either quinsy or acute epiglottitis) and became increasingly hoarse as the day progressed. All the available medical treatments failed to improve his condition, and he died at Mount Vernon at around 10 pm on December 14, 1799, aged 67.

On December 18, a funeral was held at Mount Vernon, where his body was interred. Congress passed a joint resolution to construct a marble monument in the United States Capitol for his body, an initiative supported by Martha. In December 1800, the United States House passed an appropriations bill for $200,000 (~$ in ) to build the mausoleum, which was to be a pyramid with a base square. Southerners who wanted his body to remain at Mount Vernon defeated the measure.

In accordance with his will, Washington was entombed in a family crypt he had built upon first inheriting the estate. It was in disrepair by 1799, so Washington&#x27;s will also requested that a new, larger tomb be built. This was not executed until 1831, nearly the centennial of his birth. The need for a new tomb was confirmed when an unsuccessful attempt was made to steal his skull. A joint Congressional committee in early 1832 debated the removal of Washington&#x27;s body from Mount Vernon to a crypt in the Capitol, built by Charles Bulfinch in the 1820s. Southern opposition was intense, exacerbated by an ever-growing rift between North and South. Congressman Wiley Thompson of Georgia expressed the Southerners&#x27; fears when he said:
In 1831, the bodies of George and Martha Washington, along with other members of the family, were moved from the old crypt to the new family tomb. On October 7, 1837, Washington&#x27;s remains, encased in a lead inner casket, were transferred from the closed tomb to a sarcophagus presented by John Struthers of Philadelphia. It was placed on the right side of the gateway to the tomb. A similar structure was provided for Martha&#x27;s remains, which was placed on the left. Other members of the Washington family are interred in an inner vault, behind the vestibule containing the sarcophagi.

== Preservation, legacy, and tourism ==


Following Martha Washington&#x27;s death in 1802, George Washington&#x27;s will was carried out in accordance with the terms of his bequests. The largest part of his estate, which included both his papers and Mount Vernon, passed to his nephew, Bushrod Washington, an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. The younger Washington and his wife then moved to Mount Vernon.

Bushrod Washington did not inherit much cash and was unable to support the upkeep of the estate&#x27;s mansion on the proceeds from the property and his Supreme Court salary. He sold some of his own slaves to gain working capital. However, the farms&#x27; low revenues left him short, and he was unable to adequately maintain the mansion.

Following Bushrod Washington&#x27;s death in 1829, ownership of the plantation passed to George Washington&#x27;s grandnephew, John Augustine Washington II. After he died in 1832, his wife, Jane Charlotte inherited the estate, and her son began managing it. Upon her death in 1855, John Augustine Washington III inherited the property. As his funds dwindled and the wear and tear of hundreds of visitors began to take its toll, Washington could do little to maintain the mansion and its surroundings.

Washington suggested to the United States Congress that the federal government purchase the mansion. However, Congress paid little interest to Washington&#x27;s offer, as the legislature was focusing on the conditions that shortly led to the American Civil War. Washington then traveled to Richmond, where he was equally unsuccessful in appealing to the Virginia General Assembly for the state to purchase the mansion. The mansion&#x27;s decline continued.

In 1858, Washington sold the mansion and a portion of the estate&#x27;s land to the Mount Vernon Ladies&#x27; Association, which was under the leadership of Ann Pamela Cunningham. The association paid the final installment of the purchase price of $200,000 ($6.3 million in 2020 dollars) in December 1859, taking possession in February 1860. The estate first opened to the public during that year.

The estate served as a neutral ground for both sides during the Civil War, although fighting raged across the nearby countryside. Troops from both the Union and the Confederacy toured the building. The two women caretakers asked that the soldiers leave their arms behind and either change to civilian clothes or at least cover their uniforms. They usually did as asked.

Harrison Howell Dodge became the third resident superintendent in 1885. During his 52 years&#x27; overseeing the estate, he doubled the facility&#x27;s acreage, improved the grounds, and added many historic artifacts to the collections. Dodge reviewed George Washington&#x27;s writings about the estate, visited other Colonial-era gardens, and traveled to England to see gardens dating from the Georgian period. Using that knowledge, Dodge oversaw the restoration of the site completed by Charles Wilson Killam, and put in place a number of improvements that Washington had planned but had never implemented.

Charles Wall was assistant superintendent from 1929 to 1937, then resident superintendent for 39 years. He oversaw restoration of the house by Killam and planted greenery consistent with what was used in the 18th century. In 1974, a campaign he organized was successful in preserving as parkland areas in Maryland across the Potomac River from Mount Vernon, as part of an effort to retain the bucolic vista from the house. His office was the same one used in the 18th century by Washington.

Steamboats began to carry tourists to the Mount Vernon estate in 1878. In 1892, the Washington, Alexandria and Mount Vernon Electric Railway opened, providing electric trolley service between Alexandria and the estate. The electric railway and its successors carried tourists and others between Washington, D.C., and Mount Vernon from 1896 to 1932, when the federal government acquired part of its route on which to construct the George Washington Memorial Parkway.

 The parkway, originally named the Mount Vernon Memorial Parkway, opened in 1932.

In 2007, the estate opened a reconstruction of George Washington&#x27;s distillery on the site of Washington&#x27;s original distillery, a short distance from his mansion on the Potomac River. Construction of the distillery cost $2.1 million. The fully functional replica received special legislation from the Virginia General Assembly to produce up to of whiskey annually, for sale only at the Mount Vernon gift shop.

Frank Coleman, spokesman for the Distilled Spirits Council that funded the reconstruction, said the distillery &quot;will become the equivalent of a national distillery museum&quot; and serve as a gateway to the American Whiskey Trail. In 2019, Mount Vernon began an annual whiskey festival.

As of 2020, the estate had received more than 85 million visitors. In addition to the mansion, visitors can see original and reconstructed outbuildings and barns (including slaves&#x27; quarters), an operational blacksmith shop, and the Pioneer Farm. Each year on Christmas Day, Aladdin the Christmas Camel recreates Washington&#x27;s 1787 hiring of a camel for 18 shillings to entertain his guests with an example of the animal that brought the Three Wise Men to Bethlehem to visit the newborn Jesus.

Mount Vernon remains a privately owned property. The non-profit Mount Vernon Ladies&#x27; Association has not received any funds from the federal government to support the restoration and maintenance of the mansion and the estate&#x27;s grounds or its educational programs and activities.

The association derives its income from charitable donations and the sales of tickets, produce and goods to visitors. These enable the Association to continue its mission &quot;to preserve, restore, and manage the estate of George Washington to the highest standards and to educate visitors and people throughout the world about the life and legacies of George Washington, so that his example of character and leadership will continue to inform and inspire future generations.&quot; Admission to Mount Vernon is free on Presidents&#x27; Day (the third Monday of February) and on George Washington&#x27;s birthday (February 22).

Mount Vernon was featured in a 1-cent United States postage stamp in 1936 within the Army and Navy Commemorative Series. The green stamp, which was the first in the series, also contained portraits of George Washington and Nathanael Greene, a Major General of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. 

In 1956, a 1.5-cent stamp within the Liberty Issue of U.S. postage stamps memorialized Mount Vernon as a national shrine. The Liberty Issue was originally planned to honor six presidents, six famous Americans, and six historic national shrines. The Mount Vernon stamp, which featured a view of Washington&#x27;s home facing the Potomac River, was the issue&#x27;s first that commemorated a shrine.

Mount Vernon was designated a National Historic Landmark on December 19, 1960, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. Development and improvement of the estate is an ongoing concern. Following a $110 million fundraising campaign, two new buildings that GWWO, Inc./Architects had designed opened in 2006 as venues for additional background on George Washington and the American Revolution. The Ford Orientation Center introduces visitors to George Washington and Mount Vernon with displays and a film. The Donald W. Reynolds Museum and Education Center houses many artefacts related to Washington along with multimedia displays and further films using modern entertainment technology.

Mount Vernon was put on the tentative list for World Heritage Site status in the early 2000s. It was submitted but failed to get approved. In 2014, Mount Vernon awarded its first Cyrus A. Ansary Prize for Courage and Character to former President George H. W. Bush.

The airspace surrounding Mount Vernon is restricted to prevent damage from aircraft vibrations. As a consequence, overhead/aerial photography has been limited and requires unique approaches.

===Mount Vernon Viewshed===

In 1955, a 485-acre farm across from Mount Vernon went up for sale. There were rumors that an oil company was to buy it. Charles Wagner, a resident of the Moyaone Association, a community next to the proposed site, reached out to Charles Wall, the Resident Director of Mount Vernon. The Mount Vernon Ladies&#x27; Association and its then leader, Ohio Member of Congress Frances P. Bolton, had expressed a desire to protect the view from Mount Vernon. At this point Bolton, Wagner, Wall, and Moyaone resident Robert W. Straus developed a decades-long plan to protect the Mount Vernon viewshed, which came to be known as Operation Overview.

The first step was taken in 1957 when Bolton founded the Accokeek Foundation, one of the nation&#x27;s first land trusts. The Foundation was used to purchase of land across from Mount Vernon to help preserve the area,

In 1961 and at Bolton&#x27;s instigation, a joint resolution to preserve the viewshed was introduced in the United States Senate by Senator Clinton Anderson with identical text in the United States House of Representatives by Representative John P. Saylor. The resolution was quickly passed and signed by President John F. Kennedy. Its purpose was to &quot;preserve lands which provide the principal overview from the Mount Vernon Estate and Fort Washington&quot; in order to designate around Mockley Point, which was to be the site of water treatment plant, as a national landmark. The resolution also authorized the National Park Service to receive donations and scenic easements from adjacent communities. At this point Bolton and the Accokeek Foundation transferred their land to the National Park Service to form Piscataway Park. In addition, Moyaone Association residents transferred conservation easements to the Park Service to further protect the viewshed. In 2020, the Moyaone Reserve was given National Register of Historic Places status.

==Access==
===Public transportation===
The Fairfax Connector Routes 101, 151 and 152 buses travel daily between the Mount Vernon estate and the Huntington station on Washington Metro&#x27;s Yellow Line. The Route 11C Metrobus travels between the estate and the Braddock Road station on Metro&#x27;s Blue and Yellow Lines during weekday peak hours.

===Cycling, running, and walking===
The -long Mount Vernon Trail travels along the George Washington Memorial Parkway and the Potomac River between the Mount Vernon estate and Rosslyn in Arlington County, Virginia, where it connects to the Custis Trail. The shared-use path is a part of the Potomac Heritage Trail, the East Coast Greenway and U.S. Bicycle Route 1.

The Mount Vernon Trail connects to shared-use paths that travel on the Francis Scott Key Bridge, the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge, the Arlington Memorial Bridge and the George Mason Memorial Bridge (one of the 14th Street bridges). The bridges cross the river into Washington, D.C., where their shared-use paths connect to the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway Trail, the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal towpath and the Capital Crescent Trail.

<text>Laura Jane Addams (September 6, 1860May 21, 1935) was an American settlement activist, reformer, social worker, sociologist, public administrator, philosopher, and author. She was a leader in the history of social work and Women&#x27;s suffrage. In 1889, Addams co-founded Hull House, one of America&#x27;s most famous settlement houses, in Chicago, Illinois, providing extensive social services to poor, largely immigrant families. Philosophically a &quot;radical pragmatist&quot;, she was arguably the first woman public philosopher in the United States. In the Progressive Era, when even presidents such as Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson identified themselves as reformers and might be seen as social activists, Addams was one of the most prominent reformers.

An advocate for world peace, and recognized as the founder of the social work profession in the United States, in 1931 Addams became the first American woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Earlier, Addams was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree from Yale University in 1910, becoming the first woman to receive an honorary degree from the school. In 1920, she was a co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). 

Addams helped America address and focus on issues that were of concern to mothers or extensions of the domestic-work assigned to women, such as the needs of children, local public health, and world peace. In her essay &quot;Utilization of Women in City Government&quot;, Addams noted the connection between the workings of government and the household, stating that many departments of government, such as sanitation and the schooling of children, could be traced back to traditional women&#x27;s roles in the private sphere. When she died in 1935, Addams was the best-known female public figure in the United States.

==Early life==

Born in Cedarville, Illinois, Jane Addams was the youngest of eight children born into a prosperous northern Illinois family of English-American descent which traced back to colonial Pennsylvania. In 1863, when Addams was two years old, her mother, Sarah Addams (née Weber), died while pregnant with her ninth child. Thereafter Addams was cared for mostly by her older sisters. By the time Addams was eight, four of her siblings had died: three in infancy and one at the age of 16.

Addams spent her childhood playing outdoors, reading indoors, and attending Sunday school. When she was four she contracted tuberculosis of the spine, known as Potts&#x27;s disease, which caused a curvature in her spine and lifelong health problems. This made it complicated as a child to function with the other children, considering she had a limp and could not run as well. As a child, she thought she was ugly and later remembered wanting not to embarrass her father, when he was dressed in his Sunday best, by walking down the street with him.

Jane Addams adored her father, John H. Addams, when she was a child, as she made clear in the stories in her memoir, &quot;Twenty Years at Hull House&quot; (1910). He was a founding member of the Illinois Republican Party, served as an Illinois State Senator (1855–70), and supported his friend Abraham Lincoln in his candidacies for senator (1854) and the presidency (1860). He kept a letter from Lincoln in his desk, and Addams loved to look at it as a child. Her father was an agricultural businessman with large timber, cattle, and agricultural holdings; flour and timber mills and a wool factory. He was the president of The Second National Bank of Freeport, Illinois. He remarried in 1868 when Addams was eight years old. His second wife was Anna Hosteler Haldeman, the widow of a miller in Freeport.

During her childhood, Addams had big dreams of doing something useful in the world. As a voracious reader, she became interested in the poor from her reading of Charles Dickens. Inspired by his works and by her own mother&#x27;s kindness to the Cedarville poor, Addams decided to become a doctor so that she could live and work among the poor.

Addams&#x27;s father encouraged her to pursue higher education but close to home. She was eager to attend the new college for women, Smith College in Massachusetts; but her father required her to attend nearby Rockford Female Seminary (now Rockford University), in Rockford, Illinois.

Her experience at Rockford put her in a first wave of U.S. women to receive a college education. She excelled in this all women environment. She edited the college newspaper, was the valedictorian, participated in the debate club and led the class of 1881. Addams recognized that she and others who were engaged in post secondary education would have new opportunities and challenges. She expressed this in &quot;Bread Givers&quot; (1880), a speech she gave her junior year. She noted the &quot;change which has taken place... in the ambition and aspirations of women.&quot; In the process of developing their intellect and direct labor, something new was emerging. Educated women of her generation wished &quot;not to be a man nor like a man&quot; but claim &quot;the same right to independent thought and action.&quot; Each young woman was gaining &quot;a new confidence in her possibilities, and a fresher hope in her steady progress.&quot; At 20, Addams recognized a changing cultural environment and was learning the skills at Rockford to lead the future settlement movement.
Whilst at Rockford, her readings of Thomas Carlyle, John Ruskin, Leo Tolstoy and others became significant influences. After graduating from Rockford in 1881, with a collegiate certificate and membership in Phi Beta Kappa, she still hoped to attend Smith to earn a proper B.A. That summer, her father died unexpectedly from a sudden case of appendicitis. Each child inherited roughly $50,000 (equivalent to $ in 2016).

That fall, Addams, her sister Alice, Alice&#x27;s husband Harry, and their stepmother, Anna Haldeman Addams, moved to Philadelphia so that the three young people could pursue medical educations. Harry was already trained in medicine and did further studies at the University of Pennsylvania. Jane and Alice completed their first year of medical school at the Woman&#x27;s Medical College of Pennsylvania, but Jane&#x27;s health problems, a spinal operation and a nervous breakdown prevented her from completing the degree. She was filled with sadness at her failure. Her stepmother Anna was also ill, so the entire family canceled their plans to stay two years and returned to Cedarville. her brother-in-law Harry performed surgery on her back, to straighten it. He then advised that she not pursue studies but, instead, travel. In August 1883, she set off for a two-year tour of Europe with her stepmother, traveling some of the time with friends and family who joined them. Addams decided that she did not have to become a doctor to be able to help the poor.

Upon her return home in June 1887, she lived with her stepmother in Cedarville and spent winters with her in Baltimore. Addams, still filled with vague ambition, sank into depression, unsure of her future and feeling useless leading the conventional life expected of a well-to-do young woman. She wrote long letters to her friend from Rockford Seminary, Ellen Gates Starr, mostly about Christianity and books but sometimes about her despair.

Her nephew was James Weber Linn (1876–1939) who taught English at the University of Chicago and served in the Illinois General Assembly. Linn also wrote books and newspaper articles.

==Settlement house==
Meanwhile, Addams gathered inspiration from what she read. Fascinated by the early Christians and Tolstoy&#x27;s book &quot;&quot;, she was baptized a Christian in the Cedarville Presbyterian Church in the summer of 1886. Reading Giuseppe Mazzini&#x27;s &quot;Duties of Man&quot;, she began to be inspired by the idea of democracy as a social ideal. Yet she felt confused about her role as a woman. John Stuart Mill&#x27;s &quot;The Subjection of Women&quot; made her question the social pressures on a woman to marry and devote her life to family.

In the summer of 1887, Addams read in a magazine about the new idea of starting a settlement house. She decided to visit the world&#x27;s first, Toynbee Hall, in London. She and several friends, including Ellen Gates Starr, traveled in Europe from December 1887 through the summer of 1888. After watching a bullfight in Madrid, fascinated by what she saw as an exotic tradition, Addams condemned this fascination and her inability to feel outraged at the suffering of the horses and bulls. At first, Addams told no one about her dream to start a settlement house; but, she felt increasingly guilty for not acting on her dream. Believing that sharing her dream might help her to act on it, she told Ellen Gates Starr. Starr loved the idea and agreed to join Addams in starting a settlement house.

Addams and another friend traveled to London without Starr, who was busy. Visiting Toynbee Hall, Addams was enchanted. She described it as &quot;a community of University men who live there, have their recreation clubs and society all among the poor people, yet, in the same style in which they would live in their own circle. It is so free of &#x27;professional doing good,&#x27; so unaffectedly sincere and so productive of good results in its classes and libraries seems perfectly ideal.&quot; Addams&#x27;s dream of the classes mingling socially to mutual benefit, as they had in early Christian circles seemed embodied in the new type of institution.

The settlement house as Addams discovered was a space within which unexpected cultural connections could be made and where the narrow boundaries of culture, class, and education could be expanded. They doubled as community arts centers and social service facilities. They laid the foundations for American civil society, a neutral space within which different communities and ideologies could learn from each other and seek common grounds for collective action. The role of the settlement house was an &quot;unending effort to make culture and &#x27;the issue of things&#x27; go together.&quot; The unending effort was the story of her own life, a struggle to reinvigorate her own culture by reconnecting with diversity and conflict of the immigrant communities in America&#x27;s cities and with the necessities of social reform.

==Hull House==


In 1889 Addams and her college friend and paramour Ellen Gates Starr co-founded Hull House, a settlement house in Chicago. The run-down mansion had been built by Charles Hull in 1856 and needed repairs and upgrading. Addams at first paid for all of the capital expenses (repairing the roof of the porch, repainting the rooms, buying furniture) and most of the operating costs. However gifts from individuals supported the House beginning in its first year and Addams was able to reduce the proportion of her contributions, although the annual budget grew rapidly. Some wealthy women became long-term donors to the House, including Helen Culver, who managed her first cousin Charles Hull&#x27;s estate, and who eventually allowed the contributors to use the house rent-free. Other contributors were Louise DeKoven Bowen, Mary Rozet Smith, Mary Wilmarth, and others.

Addams and Starr were the first two occupants of the house, which would later become the residence of about 25 women. At its height, Hull House was visited each week by some 2,000 people. Hull House was a center for research, empirical analysis, study, and debate, as well as a pragmatic center for living in and establishing good relations with the neighborhood. Among the aims of Hull House was to give privileged, educated young people contact with the real life of the majority of the population. Residents of Hull House conducted investigations on housing, midwifery, fatigue, tuberculosis, typhoid, garbage collection, cocaine, and truancy. The core Hull House residents were well-educated women bound together by their commitment to labour unions, the National Consumers League and the suffrage movement. Dr. Harriett Alleyne Rice joined Hull House to provide medical treatment for poor families. Its facilities included a night school for adults, clubs for older children, a public kitchen, an art gallery, a gym, a girls&#x27; club, a bathhouse, a book bindery, a music school, a drama group and a theater, apartments, a library, meeting rooms for discussion, clubs, an employment bureau, and a lunchroom. Her adult night school was a forerunner of the continuing education classes offered by many universities today. In addition to making available social services and cultural events for the largely immigrant population of the neighborhood, Hull House afforded an opportunity for young social workers to acquire training. Eventually, Hull House became a 13-building settlement complex, which included a playground and a summer camp (known as Bowen Country Club).

One aspect of the Hull House that was very important to Jane Addams was the Art Program. The art program at Hull House allowed Addams to challenge the system of industrialized education, which &quot;fitted&quot; the individual to a specific job or position. She wanted the house to provide a space, time and tools to encourage people to think independently. She saw art as the key to unlocking the diversity of the city through collective interaction, mutual self-discovery, recreation and the imagination. Art was integral to her vision of community, disrupting fixed ideas and stimulating the diversity and interaction on which a healthy society depends, based on a continual rewriting of cultural identities through variation and interculturalism.

With funding from Edward Butler, Addams opened an art exhibition and studio space as one of the first additions to Hull House. On the first floor of the new addition there was a branch of the Chicago Public Library, and the second was the Butler Art Gallery, which featured recreations of famous artwork as well as the work of local artists. Studio space within the art gallery provided both Hull House residents and the entire community with the opportunity to take art classes or to come in and hone their craft whenever they liked. As Hull House grew, and the relationship with the neighborhood deepened, that opportunity became less of a comfort to the poor and more of an outlet of expression and exchange of different cultures and diverse communities. Art and culture was becoming a bigger and more important part of the lives of immigrants within the 19th ward, and soon children caught on to the trend. These working-class children were offered instruction in all forms and levels of art. Places such as the Butler Art Gallery or the Bowen Country Club often hosted these classes, but more informal lessons would often be taught outdoors. Addams, with the help of Ellen Gates Starr, founded the Chicago Public School Art Society (CPSAS) in response to the positive reaction the art classes for children caused. The CPSAS provided public schools with reproductions of world-renowned pieces of art, hired artists to teach children how to create art, and also took the students on field trips to Chicago&#x27;s many art museums.

===Near west side neighborhood===
The Hull House neighborhood was a mix of European ethnic groups that had immigrated to Chicago around the start of the 20th century. That mix was the ground where Hull House&#x27;s inner social and philanthropic elitists tested their theories and challenged the establishment. The ethnic mix is recorded by the Bethlehem-Howard Neighborhood Center: &quot;Germans and Jews resided south of that inner core (south of Twelfth Street) ... The Greek delta formed by Harrison, Halsted Street, and Blue Island Streets served as a buffer to the Irish residing to the north and the French Canadians to the northwest.&quot; Italians resided within the inner core of the Hull House Neighborhood ... from the river on the east end, on out to the western ends of what came to be known as Little Italy. Greeks and Jews, along with the remnants of other immigrant groups, began their exodus from the neighborhood in the early 20th century. Only Italians continued as an intact and thriving community through the Great Depression, World War II, and well beyond the ultimate d three &quot;ethical principles&quot; for social settlements: &quot;to teach by example, to practice cooperation, and to practice social democracy, that is, egalitarian, or democratic, social relations across class lines.&quot; Thus Hull House offered a comprehensive program of civic, cultural, recreational, and educational activities and attracted admiring visitors from all over the world, including William Lyon Mackenzie King, a graduate student from Harvard University who later became prime minister of Canada. In the 1890s Julia Lathrop, Florence Kelley, and other residents of the house made it a world center of social reform activity. Hull House used the latest methodology (pioneering in statistical mapping) to study overcrowding, truancy, typhoid fever, cocaine, children&#x27;s reading, newsboys, infant mortality, and midwifery. Starting with efforts to improve the immediate neighborhood, the Hull House group became involved in city and statewide campaigns for better housing, improvements in public welfare, stricter child-labor laws, and protection of working women. Addams brought in prominent visitors from around the world and had close links with leading Chicago intellectuals and philanthropists. In 1912, she helped start the new Progressive Party and supported the presidential campaign of Theodore Roosevelt.

&quot;Addams&#x27; philosophy combined feminist sensibilities with an unwavering commitment to social improvement through cooperative efforts. Although she sympathized with feminists, socialists, and pacifists, Addams refused to be labeled. This refusal was pragmatic rather than ideological.&quot;

===Emphasis on children===
Hull House stressed the importance of the role of children in the Americanization process of new immigrants. This philosophy also fostered the play movement and the research and service fields of leisure, youth, and human services. Addams argued in &quot;The Spirit of Youth and the City Streets&quot; (1909) that play and recreation programs are needed because cities are destroying the spirit of youth. Hull House featured multiple programs in art and drama, kindergarten classes, boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; clubs, language classes, reading groups, college extension courses, along with public baths, a gymnasium, a labor museum and playground, all within a free-speech atmosphere. They were all designed to foster democratic cooperation, collective action and downplay individualism. She helped pass the first model tenement code and the first factory laws.

Along with her colleagues from Hull House, in 1901 Jane Addams founded what would become the Juvenile Protective Association. JPA provided the first probation officers for the first Juvenile Court in the United States until this became a government function. From 1907 until the 1940s, JPA engaged in many studies examining such subjects as racism, child labor and exploitation, drug abuse and prostitution in Chicago and their effects on child development. Through the years, their mission has now become improving the social and emotional well-being and functioning of vulnerable children so they can reach their fullest potential at home, in school, and in their communities.

===Documenting social illnesses===
Addams and her colleagues documented the communal geography of typhoid fever and reported that poor workers were bearing the brunt of the illness. She identified the political corruption and business avarice that caused the city bureaucracy to ignore health, sanitation, and building codes. Linking environmental justice and municipal reform, she eventually defeated the bosses and fostered a more equitable distribution of city services and modernized inspection practices. Addams spoke of the &quot;undoubted powers of public recreation to bring together the classes of a community in the keeping them apart.&quot; Addams worked with the Chicago Board of Health and served as the first vice-president of the Playground Association of America.

===Emphasis on prostitution===
In 1912, Addams published &quot;A New Conscience and Ancient Evil&quot;, about prostitution. This book was extremely popular. Addams believed that prostitution was a result of kidnapping only. Her book later inspired Stella Wynne Herron&#x27;s 1916 short story &quot;Shoes&quot;, which Lois Weber adapted into a groundbreaking 1916 film of the same name.

===Feminine ideals===
Addams and her colleagues originally intended Hull House as a transmission device to bring the values of the college-educated high culture to the masses, including the Efficiency Movement, a major movement in industrial nations in the early 20th century that sought to identify and eliminate waste in the economy and society, and to develop and implement best practices. However, over time, the focus changed from bringing art and culture to the neighborhood (as evidenced in the construction of the Butler Building) to responding to the needs of the community by providing childcare, educational opportunities, and large meeting spaces. Hull House became more than a proving ground for the new generation of college-educated, professional women: it also became part of the community in which it was founded, and its development reveals a shared history.

Addams called on women, especially middle-class women with leisure time and energy as well as rich philanthropists, to exercise their civic duty to become involved in municipal affairs as a matter of &quot;civic housekeeping&quot;. Addams thereby enlarged the concept of civic duty to include roles for women beyond motherhood (which involved child rearing). Women&#x27;s lives revolved around &quot;responsibility, care, and obligation&quot;, which represented the source of women&#x27;s power. This notion provided the foundation for the municipal or civil housekeeping role that Addams defined and gave added weight to the women&#x27;s suffrage movement that Addams supported. Addams argued that women, as opposed to men, were trained in the delicate matters of human welfare and needed to build upon their traditional roles of housekeeping to be civic housekeepers. Enlarged housekeeping duties involved reform efforts regarding poisonous sewage, impure milk (which often carried tuberculosis), smoke-laden air, and unsafe factory conditions. Addams led the &quot;garbage wars&quot;; in 1894 she became the first woman appointed as sanitary inspector of Chicago&#x27;s 19th Ward. With the help of the Hull House Women&#x27;s Club, within a year over 1,000 health department violations were reported to city council and garbage collection reduced death and disease.

Addams had long discussions with philosopher John Dewey in which they redefined democracy in terms of pragmatism and civic activism, with an emphasis more on duty and less on rights. The two leading perspectives that distinguished Addams and her coalition from the modernizers more concerned with efficiency were the need to extend to social and economic life the democratic structures and practices that had been limited to the political sphere, as in Addams&#x27;s programmatic support of trade unions and second, their call for a new social ethic to supplant the individualist outlook as being no longer adequate in modern society.

Addams&#x27;s construction of womanhood involved daughterhood, sexuality, wifehood, and motherhood. In both of her autobiographical volumes, &quot;Twenty Years at Hull-House&quot; (1910) and &quot;The Second Twenty Years at Hull-House&quot; (1930), Addams&#x27;s gender constructions parallel the Progressive-Era ideology she championed. In &quot;A New Conscience and an Ancient Evil&quot; (1912) she dissected the social pathology of sex slavery, prostitution and other sexual behaviors among working-class women in American industrial centers from 1890 to 1910. Addams&#x27;s autobiographical persona manifests her ideology and supports her popularized public activist persona as the &quot;Mother of Social Work&quot;, in the sense that she represents herself as a celibate matron who served the suffering immigrant masses through Hull House, as if they were her own children. Although not a mother herself, Addams became the &quot;mother to the nation&quot;, identified with motherhood in the sense of protective care of her people.

==Teaching==
Addams kept up her heavy schedule of public lectures around the country, especially at college campuses. In addition, she offered college courses through the Extension Division of the University of Chicago. She declined offers from the university to become directly affiliated with it, including an offer from Albion Small, chair of the Department of Sociology, of a graduate faculty position. She declined in order to maintain her independent role outside of academia. Her goal was to teach adults not enrolled in formal academic institutions, because of their poverty and/or lack of credentials. Furthermore, she wanted no university controls over her political activism.

Addams was appointed to serve on the Chicago Board of Education. Addams was a charter member of the American Sociological Society, founded in 1905. She gave papers to it in 1912, 1915, and 1919. She was the most prominent woman member during her lifetime.

==Relationships==
Generally, Addams was close to a wide set of other women and was very good at eliciting their involvement from different classes in Hull House&#x27;s programs. Nevertheless, throughout her life Addams did have romantic relationships with a few of these women, including Mary Rozet Smith and Ellen Starr. Her relationships offered her the time and energy to pursue her social work while being supported emotionally and romantically. From her exclusively romantic relationships with women, she would most likely be described as a lesbian in contemporary terms, similar to many leading figures in the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom of the time.

Her first romantic partner was Ellen Starr, with whom she founded Hull House, who she met when both were students at Rockford Female Seminary. In 1889, the two visited Toynbee Hall together and started their settlement house project, purchasing a house in Chicago.

Her second romantic partner was Mary Rozet Smith, who was wealthy and supported Addams&#x27;s work at Hull House, and with whom she shared a house. Historian Lilian Faderman wrote that Jane was in love and she addressed Mary as &quot;My Ever Dear&quot;, &quot;Darling&quot; and &quot;Dearest One&quot;, and concluded that they shared the intimacy of a married couple. They remained together until 1934, when Mary died of pneumonia, after 40 years together.
It was said that, &quot;Mary Smith became and always remained the highest and clearest note in the music that was Jane Addams&#x27; personal life&quot;. Together they owned a summer house in Bar Harbor, Maine. When apart, they would write to each other at least once a day – sometimes twice. Addams would write to Smith, &quot;I miss you dreadfully and am yours &#x27;til death&quot;. The letters also show that the women saw themselves as a married couple: &quot;There is reason in the habit of married folks keeping together&quot;, Addams wrote to Smith.

==Religion and religious motives==
Addams&#x27;s religious beliefs were shaped by her wide reading and life experience. She saw her settlement work as part of the &quot;social Christian&quot; movement. Addams learned about social Christianity from the co-founders of Toynbee Hall, Samuel and Henrietta Barnett. The Barnetts held a great interest in converting others to Christianity, but they believed that Christians should be more engaged with the world and, in the words of one of the leaders of the social Christian movement in England, W. H. Fremantle, &quot;imbue all human relations with the spirit of Christ&#x27;s self-renouncing love&quot;.

According to Christie and Gauvreau (2001), while the Christian settlement houses sought to Christianize, Jane Addams &quot;had come to epitomize the force of secular humanism.&quot; Her image was, however, &quot;reinvented&quot; by the Christian churches.

According to Joslin (2004), &quot;The new humanism, as [Addams] interprets it comes from a secular, and not a religious, pattern of belief&quot;.

According to the Jane Addams Hull-House Museum, &quot;Some social settlements were linked to religious institutions. Others, like Hull-House [co-founded by Addams], were secular.&quot;

Hilda Satt Polacheck, a former resident of Hull House, stated that Addams firmly believed in religious freedom and bringing people of all faiths into the social, secular fold of Hull House. The one exception, she notes, was the annual Christmas Party, although Addams left the religious side to the church.

The Bible served Addams as both a source of inspiration for her life of service and a manual for pursuing her calling. The emphasis on following Jesus&#x27; example and actively advancing the establishment of God&#x27;s Kingdom on earth is also evident in Addams&#x27;s work and the Social Gospel movement.

==Politics==
===Peace movement===

In 1898, Addams joined the Anti-Imperialist League, in opposition to the U.S. annexation of the Philippines. A staunch supporter of the Progressive Party, she nominated Theodore Roosevelt for the presidency during the Party Convention, held in Chicago in August 1912. She signed up on the party platform, even though it called for building more battleships. She went on to speak and campaign extensively for Roosevelt&#x27;s 1912 presidential campaign.

In January 1915, she became involved in the Woman&#x27;s Peace Party and was elected national chairman. Addams was invited by European women peace activists to preside over the International Congress of Women in The Hague, April 28–30, 1915, and was chosen to head the commission to find an end to the war. This included meeting ten leaders in neutral countries as well as those at war to discuss mediation. This was the first significant international effort against the war. Addams, along with co-delegates Emily Balch and Alice Hamilton, documented their experiences of this venture, published as a book, &quot;Women at The Hague&quot; (University of Illinois).

In her journal, Balch recorded her impression of Jane Addams (April 1915):

Miss Addams shines, so respectful of everyone&#x27;s views, so eager to understand and sympathize, so patient of anarchy and even ego, yet always there, strong, wise and in the lead. No &#x27;managing&#x27;, no keeping dark and bringing things subtly to pass, just a radiating wisdom and power of judgement.

Addams was elected president of the International Committee of Women for a Permanent Peace, established to continue the work of the Hague Congress, at a conference in 1919 in Zürich, Switzerland. The International Committee developed into the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF). Addams continued as president, a position that entailed frequent travel to Europe and Asia.

In 1917, she also became a member of the Fellowship of Reconciliation USA (American branch of the International Fellowship of Reconciliation founded in 1919) and was a member of the Fellowship Council until 1933. When the US joined the war in 1917, Addams started to be strongly criticized. She faced increasingly harsh rebukes and criticism as a pacifist. Her 1915 speech on pacifism at Carnegie Hall received negative coverage by newspapers such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which branded her as unpatriotic. Later, during her travels, she spent time meeting with a wide variety of diplomats and civic leaders and reiterating her Victorian belief in women&#x27;s special mission to preserve peace. Recognition of these efforts came with the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Addams in 1931. As the first U.S. woman to win the prize, Addams was applauded for her &quot;expression of an essentially American democracy.&quot; She donated her share of the prize money to the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom.

===Pacifism===
Addams was a major synthesizing figure in the domestic and international peace movements, serving as both a figurehead and leading theoretician; she was influenced especially by Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy and by the pragmatism of philosophers John Dewey and George Herbert Mead. Her books, particularly &quot;Newer Ideals of Peace&quot; and &quot;Peace and Bread in Time of War&quot;, and her peace activism informed early feminist theories and perspectives on peace and war. She envisioned democracy, social justice and peace as mutually reinforcing; they all had to advance together to achieve any one. Addams became an anti-war activist from 1899, as part of the anti-imperialist movement that followed the Spanish–American War. Her book &quot;Newer Ideals of Peace&quot; (1907) reshaped the peace movement worldwide to include ideals of social justice. She recruited social justice reformers like Alice Hamilton, Lillian Wald, Florence Kelley, and Emily Greene Balch to join her in the new international women&#x27;s peace movement after 1914. Addams&#x27;s work came to fruition after World War I, when major institutional bodies began to link peace with social justice and probe the underlying causes of war and conflict.

In 1899 and 1907, world leaders sought peace by convening an innovative and influential peace conference at The Hague. These conferences produced Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. A 1914 conference was canceled due to World War I. The void was filled by an unofficial conference convened by Women at the Hague. At the time, both the US and The Netherlands were neutral. Jane Addams chaired this pathbreaking International Congress of Women at the Hague, which included almost 1,200 participants from 12 warring and neutral countries. Their goal was to develop a framework to end the violence of war. Both national and international political systems excluded women&#x27;s voices. The women delegates argued that the exclusion of women from policy discourse and decisions around war and peace resulted in flawed policy. The delegates adopted a series of resolutions addressing these problems and called for extending the franchise and women&#x27;s meaningful inclusion in formal international peace processes at war&#x27;s end. Following the conference, Addams and a congressional delegation traveled throughout Europe meeting with leaders, citizen groups, and wounded soldiers from both sides. Her leadership during the conference and her travels to the capitals of the war-torn regions were cited in nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize.

Addams was opposed to U.S. interventionism and expansionism and ultimately was against those who sought American dominance abroad. In 1915, she gave a speech at Carnegie Hall and was booed offstage for opposing U.S. intervention into World War I. Addams damned war as a cataclysm that undermined human kindness, solidarity, and civic friendship, and caused families across the world to struggle. In turn, her views were denounced by patriotic groups and newspapers during World War I (1917–18). Oswald Garrison Villard came to her defense when she suggested that armies gave liquor to soldiers just before major ground attacks. &quot;Take the case of Jane Addams for one. With what abuse did not the [New York] &quot;Times&quot; cover her, one of the noblest of our women, because she told the simple truth that the Allied troops were often given liquor or drugs before charging across No Man&#x27;s Land. Yet when the facts came out at the hands of Sir Philip Gibbs and others not one word of apology was ever forthcoming.&quot; Even after the war, the WILPF&#x27;s program of peace and disarmament was characterized by opponents as radical, Communist-influenced, unpatriotic, and unfeminine. Young veterans in the American Legion, supported by some members of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) and the League of Women Voters, were ill-prepared to confront the older, better-educated, more financially secure and nationally famous women of the WILPF. Nevertheless, the DAR could and did expel Addams from membership in their organization. The Legion&#x27;s efforts to portray the WILPF members as dangerously naive females resonated with working class audiences, but President Calvin Coolidge and the middle classes supported Addams and her WILPF efforts in the 1920s to prohibit poison gas and outlaw war. After 1920, however, she was widely regarded as the greatest woman of the Progressive Era. In 1931, the award of the Nobel Peace prize earned her near-unanimous acclaim.

=== Philosophy and &quot;peaceweaving&quot; ===
Jane Addams was also a philosopher of peace. Peace theorists often distinguish between negative and positive peace. Negative peace deals with the absence of violence or war. Positive peace is more complicated. It deals with the kind of society we aspire to, and can take into account concepts like justice, cooperation, the quality of relationships, freedom, order and harmony. Jane Addams&#x27;s philosophy of peace is a type of positive peace. Patricia Shields and Joseph Soeters (2017) have summarized her ideas of peace using the term &quot;Peaceweaving&quot;. They use weaving as a metaphor because it denotes connection. Fibers come together to form a cloth, which is both flexible and strong. Further, weaving is an activity in which men and women have historically engaged. Addams&#x27;s &quot;peaceweaving&quot; is a process which builds &quot;the fabric of peace by emphasizing relationships. Peaceweaving builds these relationships by working on practical problems, engaging people widely with sympathetic understanding while recognizing that progress is measured by the welfare of the vulnerable&quot; 

===Eugenics===

Addams supported eugenics and was vice president of the American Social Hygiene Association, which advocated eugenics in an effort to improve the social &#x27;hygiene&#x27; of American society. She was a close friend of noted eugenicists David Starr Jordan and Charlotte Perkins Gilman, and was an avid proponent of the ideas of G. Stanley Hall. Addams belief in eugenics was tied to her desire to eliminate what she perceived to be &#x27;social ills&#x27;:

===Prohibition===
While &quot;no record is available of any speech she ever made on behalf of the eighteenth amendment&quot;, she nonetheless supported prohibition on the basis that alcohol &quot;was of course a leading lure and a necessary element in houses of prostitution, both from a financial and a social standpoint.&quot; She repeated the claim that &quot;professional houses of prostitution could not sustain themselves without the &#x27;vehicle of alcohol.&#x27;&quot;

==Death==

While Addams was often troubled by health problems in her youth and throughout her life, her health began to take a more serious decline after she suffered a heart attack in 1926.

She died on May 21, 1935, at the age of 74, in Chicago and is buried in her hometown of Cedarville, Illinois.

==Adult life and legacy==
 Jane Addams is buried at Cedarville Cemetery, Cedarville, Illinois.

Hull House and the Peace Movement are widely recognized as the key tangible pillars of Addams&#x27;s legacy. While her life focused on the development of individuals, her ideas continue to influence social, political and economic reform in the United States, as well as internationally. Addams and Starr&#x27;s creation of the settlement house, Hull House, impacted the community, immigrant residents, and social work.

Willard Motley, a resident artist of Hull House, extracting from Addams&#x27; central theory on symbolic interactionism, used the neighborhood and its people to write his 1948 best seller, &quot;Knock on Any Door&quot;. His novel later became a well known court-room film in 1949. This book and film brought attention to how a resident lived an everyday life inside a settlement house and his relationship with Jane Addams.

Addams&#x27;s role as reformer enabled her to petition the establishment at and alter the social and physical geography of her Chicago neighborhood. Although contemporary academic sociologists defined her engagement as &quot;social work&quot;, Addams&#x27;s efforts differed significantly from activities typically labeled as &quot;social work&quot; during that time period. Before Addams&#x27;s powerful influence on the profession, social work was largely informed by a &quot;friendly visitor&quot; model in which typically wealthy women of high public stature visited impoverished individuals and, through systematic assessment and intervention, aimed to improve the lives of the poor. Addams rejected the friendly visitor model in favor of a model of social reform/social theory-building, thereby introducing the now-central tenets of social justice and reform to the field of social work.

Addams worked with other reform groups toward goals including the first juvenile court law, tenement-house regulation, an eight-hour working day for women, factory inspection, and workers&#x27; compensation. She advocated research aimed at determining the causes of poverty and crime, and she supported women&#x27;s suffrage. She was a strong advocate of justice for immigrants, African Americans, and minority groups by becoming a chartered member of the NAACP. Among the projects that the members of Hull House opened were the Immigrants&#x27; Protective League, the Juvenile Protective Association, the first juvenile court in the United States, and a juvenile psychopathic clinic.

Addams&#x27;s influential writings and speeches, on behalf of the formation of the League of Nations and as a peace advocate, influenced the later shape of the United Nations.

Jane Addams also sponsored the work of Neva Boyd, who founded the Recreational Training School at Hull House, a one-year educational program in group games, gymnastics, dancing, dramatic arts, play theory, and social problems. At Hull House, Neva Boyd ran movement and recreational groups for children, using games and improvisation to teach language skills, problem-solving, self-confidence and social skills. During the Great Depression, Boyd worked with the Recreational Project in the Works Progress Administration, (WPA) as The Chicago Training School for Playground Workers, which subsequently became the foundation for the Recreational Therapy and Educational Drama movements in the U.S. One of her best known disciples, Viola Spolin taught in the Recreational Theater Program at Hull House during the WPA era. Spolin went on to be a pioneer in the improvisational theater movement in the US and the inventor of Theater Games.

The main legacy left by Jane Addams includes her involvement in the creation of the Hull House, impacting communities and the whole social structure, reaching out to colleges and universities in hopes of bettering the educational system, and passing on her knowledge to others through speeches and books. She paved the way for women by publishing several books and co-winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931 with Starr.

The Jane Addams Papers Project, originally housed at the University of Illinois at Chicago and Duke University, was relocated to Ramapo College in 2015. The project&#x27;s digital edition actively engages students and the world with the work and correspondence of Jane Addams.

The Addams neighborhood and elementary school in Long Beach, California are named for her.

===Sociology===
Jane Addams was intimately involved with the founding of sociology as a field in the United States. Hull House enabled Addams to befriend and become a colleague to early members of the Chicago School of Sociology. She actively contributed to the sociology academic literature, publishing five articles in the &quot;American Journal of Sociology&quot; between 1896 and 1914. Her influence, through her work in applied sociology, impacted the thought and direction of the Chicago School of Sociology&#x27;s members. In 1893, she co-authored the compilation of essays written by Hull House residents and workers titled, &quot;Hull-House Maps and Papers&quot;. These ideas helped shape and define the interests and methodologies of the Chicago School. She worked with American philosopher George Herbert Mead and John Dewey on social reform issues, including promoting women&#x27;s rights, ending child labor, and mediating during the 1910 Garment Workers&#x27; Strike. This strike in particular bent thoughts of protests because it dealt with women workers, ethnicity, and working conditions. All of these subjects were key items that Addams wanted to see in society.

The University of Chicago Sociology department was established in 1892, three years after Hull House was established (1889). Members of Hull House welcomed the first group of professors, who soon were &quot;intimately involved with Hull House&quot; and assiduously engaged with applied social reform and philanthropy&quot;. In 1893, for example, faculty (Vincent, Small and Bennis) worked with Jane Addams and fellow Hull House resident Florence Kelley to pass legislation &quot;banning sweat shops and employment of children&quot; Albion Small, chair of the Chicago Department of Sociology and founder of the &quot;American Journal of Sociology&quot;, called for a sociology that was active &quot;in the work of perfecting and applying plans and devices for social improvement and amelioration&quot;, which took place in the &quot;vast sociological laboratory&quot; that was 19th-century Chicago. Although untenured, women residents of Hull House taught classes in the Chicago Sociology Department. During and after World War I, the focus of the Chicago Sociology Department shifted away from social activism toward a more scholarly orientation. Social activism was also associated with Communism and a &quot;weaker&quot; woman&#x27;s work orientation. In response to this change, women sociologists in the department &quot;were moved inmasse out of sociology and into social work&quot; in 1920. The contributions of Jane Addams and other Hull House residents were buried in history.

Mary Jo Deegan, in her 1988 book &quot;Jane Addams and the Men of the Chicago School, 1892–1918&quot; was the first person to recover Addams&#x27; influence on sociology. Deegan&#x27;s work has led to recognition of Addams&#x27;s place in sociology. In a 2001 address, for example, Joe Feagin, then president of the American Sociology Association, identified Addams as a &quot;key founder&quot; and he called for sociology to again claim its activist roots and commitment to social justice.

===Remembrances===

On December 10, 2007, Illinois celebrated the first annual Jane Addams Day. Jane Addams Day was initiated by a dedicated school teacher from Dongola, Illinois, assisted by the Illinois Division of the American Association of University Women (AAUW). Chicago activist Jan Lisa Huttner traveled throughout Illinois as Director of International Relations for AAUW-Illinois to help publicize the date, and later gave annual presentations about Jane Addams Day in costume as Jane Addams. In 2010, Huttner appeared as Jane Addams at a 150th Birthday Party sponsored by Rockford University (Jane Addams&#x27; alma mater), and in 2011, she appeared as Jane Addams at an event sponsored by the Chicago Park District.

There is a Jane Addams Memorial Park located near Navy Pier in Chicago. A six-piece sculptural grouping honoring Addams by Louise Bourgeois called &quot;Helping Hands&quot; was originally installed in 1993 at Addams Memorial Park. However, they were &quot;relocated to Chicago Women&#x27;s Park and Gardens&quot; in 2011 after being vandalized. The Jane Addams memorial sculpture was Chicago&#x27;s first major artwork to honor an important woman. In 2007, the state of Illinois renamed the Northwest Tollway as the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway. Hull House buildings were mostly demolished for the establishment of the campus of the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1963, or relocated. The Hull residence itself and a related building are preserved as a museum and monument to Jane Addams.

The Jane Addams College of Social Work is a professional school at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Jane Addams Business Careers Center is a high school in Cleveland, Ohio. Jane Addams High School For Academic Careers is a high school in The Bronx, NY. Jane Addams House is a residence hall built in 1936 at Connecticut College.

In 1973, Jane Addams was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. In 2008 Jane Addams was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame. Addams was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame in 2012. Also, in 2012 she was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display which celebrates LGBTQ history and people. In 2014, Jane Addams was one of the first 20 honorees awarded a 3-foot x 3-foot bronze plaque on San Francisco&#x27;s Rainbow Honor Walk (www.rainbowhonorwalk.org) paying tribute to LGBT heroes and heroines. In 2015, Addams was named by Equality Forum as one of their 31 Icons of the 2015 LGBT History Month.

<text>Reclaim the Streets also known as RTS, are a collective with a shared ideal of community ownership of public spaces. Participants characterise the collective as a resistance movement opposed to the dominance of corporate forces in globalisation, and to the car as the dominant mode of transport.

Reclaim the Streets often stage non-violent direct action street reclaiming events such as the &#x27;invasion&#x27; of a major road, highway or motorway to stage a party. While this may obstruct the regular users of these spaces such as car drivers and public bus riders, the philosophy of RTS is that it is vehicle traffic, not pedestrians, who are causing the obstruction, and that by occupying the road they are in fact opening up public space. The events are usually spectacular and colourful, with sand pits for children to play in, free food and music. At a minority of events, where the police have tried to violently shut down the event there has been violence between protestors and police.

Reclaim the Streets was originally formed by Earth First!

==Past actions==
===UK===

* Camden High Street, 14 May 1995. The first major RTS street party action took over a busy London street and closed it to motor-traffic for an afternoon. Around 500 people took over the street. There was free food served from tables in the middle of the road, and music played from a bicycle-powered sound system. A climbing frame was placed in the middle of a crossroad junction and children were able to play on it. The action met on the high street in the afternoon and left from the Rainbow Centre, a squatted Church in Kentish Town.
* Upper Street, Islington, 23 July 1995. Three thousand people party at another busy traffic junction. Banners are stretched between lampposts, with messages such as ‘STREET NOW OPEN’ and ‘CAR FREE’. There is a sound system as well as a live band that uses a bus stop as a stage. Kids play in a hastily constructed sandpit.
* Birmingham, 6 August 1995. Organised with a handful of people around 200 people turn up for family afternoon with live band playing from the back of a truck. To prevent police using riot tactics to clear the street at the end, a procession with music and dancing headed off down the road to a pub.

<text>The Lincoln County War was an Old West conflict between rival factions which began in 1878 in Lincoln County, New Mexico Territory, the predecessor of the state of New Mexico, and continued until 1881. The feud became famous because of the participation of William H. Bonney (&quot;Billy the Kid&quot;). Other notable participants included Sheriff William J. Brady, cattle rancher John Chisum, lawyer and businessmen Alexander McSween, James Dolan and Lawrence Murphy.

The conflict began between two factions competing for profits from dry goods and cattle interests in the county. The older, established faction was dominated by James Dolan, who operated a dry goods monopoly through a general store referred to locally as &quot;The House&quot;. English-born John Tunstall and his business partner Alexander McSween opened a competing store in 1876, with backing from established cattleman John Chisum. The two sides gathered lawmen, businessmen, Tunstall&#x27;s ranch hands, and criminal gangs to their assistance. The Dolan faction was allied with Lincoln County Sheriff Brady and aided by the Jesse Evans Gang. The Tunstall-McSween faction organized their own posse of armed men, known as the Lincoln County Regulators, and had their own lawmen consisting of town constable Richard M. Brewer and Deputy US Marshal Robert A. Widenmann.

The conflict was marked by revenge killings, starting with the murder of Tunstall by members of the Evans Gang. In revenge for this, the Regulators killed Sheriff Brady and others in a series of incidents. Further killings continued unabated for several months, climaxing in the battle of Lincoln, a five-day gunfight and siege that resulted in the death of McSween and the scattering of the Regulators. Pat Garrett was named County Sheriff in 1880, and he hunted down Billy the Kid, killing two other former Regulators in the process.

The war was fictionalized by several Hollywood movies, including &quot;The Left Handed Gun&quot; in 1958, John Wayne’s &quot;Chisum&quot; in 1970, Sam Peckinpah’s &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot; in 1973 and &quot;Young Guns&quot; in 1988. Ron Hansen’s novel &quot;The Kid&quot; (2016) is also inspired by the Lincoln County War.

==War==

During November 1876, a wealthy Englishman named John Tunstall arrived in Lincoln County, New Mexico, where he intended to develop a cattle ranch, store, and bank in partnership with the young attorney Alexander McSween and cattleman John Chisum. At the time Lincoln County was dominated both economically and politically by Lawrence Murphy and James Dolan, the proprietors of LG Murphy and Co., later James J. Dolan and Co., the only store in the county. The factions were divided along ethnic and sectarian lines, with the Murphy faction being mostly Irish Catholic, while Tunstall and his allies were mostly English Protestant. LG Murphy and Co. lent thousands of dollars to the Territorial Governor, and the Territorial Attorney General eventually held the mortgage on the company. Tunstall learned that Murphy and Dolan, who bought many of their cattle from rustlers, had lucrative beef contracts from the United States government to supply forts and Indian agencies. The government contracts, along with their monopoly on merchandise and financing for farms and ranches, allowed Murphy, Dolan and their partner Riley to become wealthy.

=== The Fritz insurance policy ===
The main event that resulted in the beginning of the Lincoln County War was controversy over the disbursement of Emil Fritz&#x27;s insurance policy. Emil Fritz was a partner of L. G. Murphy. When he died in 1874, the executors of the estate hired Alexander McSween to collect his insurance policy. After collecting the policy, McSween refused to give the money to the executor of the estate because The House claimed that the money was owed to them as a debt and McSween suspected that the executor of the estate would give the money to them. McSween also knew how badly needy for cash The House was and as a business competitor was likely loath to have the money go to them, whether their claim was legitimate or not.

During February 1878, in a court case that was eventually dismissed, they obtained a court order to seize all of McSween&#x27;s assets, but mistakenly included all of Tunstall&#x27;s assets with those of McSween. Sheriff Brady formed a posse to attach Tunstall&#x27;s remaining assets at his ranch 70 miles from Lincoln. Dolan also enlisted the John Kinney Gang, Seven Rivers Warriors and the Jesse Evans Gang, and their job was mainly to harass and rustle cattle from Tunstall&#x27;s and Chisum&#x27;s ranches, as well as being the faction&#x27;s hired gunmen.

===Killing of John Tunstall===
On February 18, 1878, members of the Sheriff&#x27;s posse caught up to Tunstall while he and his ranch-hands, Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Brewer, Billy the Kid, John Middleton, Henry Newton Brown, Robert A. Widenmann, and Fred Waite, were herding his last nine horses back to Lincoln. Frank Warner Angel, a special investigator for the Secretary of the Interior, later determined that Tunstall was shot in &quot;cold blood&quot; by Jesse Evans, William Morton, and Tom Hill. Tunstall&#x27;s murder was witnessed from a distance by several of his men, including Richard Brewer and Billy the Kid. Tunstall&#x27;s murder began the Lincoln County War.

Tunstall&#x27;s cowhands and other local citizens formed a group known as the Regulators to avenge his murder, since the territorial criminal justice system was controlled by allies of Murphy and Dolan. While the Regulators at various times consisted of dozens of American and Mexican cowboys, the main dozen or so members were known as the &quot;iron clad&quot;, including McCarty, Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Brewer, Frank McNab, Doc Scurlock, Jim French, John Middleton, George Coe, Frank Coe, Jose Chavez y Chavez, Charlie Bowdre, Tom O&#x27;Folliard, Fred Waite (a Chickasaw), and Henry Newton Brown.

The Regulators set out to apprehend the sheriff&#x27;s posse members who had murdered Tunstall. After the Regulators were deputized by the Lincoln County justice of the peace, together with Constable Martinez, they attempted to serve the legally issued warrants to Tunstall&#x27;s murderers. Sheriff Brady arrested and jailed Martinez and his deputies in defiance of their deputized status. They gained release and searched for Tunstall&#x27;s murderers. They found Buck Morton, Dick Lloyd, and Frank Baker near the Rio Peñasco. Morton surrendered after a five-mile (8 km) running gunfight on the condition that he and his fellow deputy sheriff, Frank Baker – who had no part in the Tunstall murder but was riding with Morton and Lloyd – would be returned alive to Lincoln. The Regulators&#x27; captain Dick Brewer assured them they would be taken to Lincoln, but other Regulators insisted on killing the prisoners. One Regulator, William McCloskey, who was a friend of Morton&#x27;s, resisted such action.

===Blackwater massacre===
On March 9, 1878, the third day of the journey back to Lincoln, the Regulators killed McCloskey, Morton, and Baker in the Capitan foothills along the Blackwater Creek. They claimed that Morton murdered McCloskey and tried to escape with Baker, forcing them to kill the two prisoners. Few believed the story, as they thought it unlikely that Morton would have killed his only friend in the group. As the bodies of Morton and Baker each bore eleven bullet holes, one for each Regulator, Utley believes that the Regulators murdered them and killed McCloskey for opposing them. Nolan writes that Morton took ten bullets, and Baker was shot five times. That same day, Tunstall&#x27;s other two killers, Tom Hill and Jesse Evans, were shot while trying to rob a sheep drover near Tularosa, New Mexico. Hill died and Evans was severely wounded. While Evans was at Fort Stanton for medical treatment, he was arrested on an old federal warrant for stealing stock from an Indian reservation.

===Killing of William Brady===
Sheriff Brady asked for assistance from the Territorial Attorney General, Thomas Benton Catron, to end this &quot;anarchy&quot;. Catron referred the topic to the Territorial Governor Samuel B. Axtell. The governor decreed that John Wilson, the Justice of the Peace, had been appointed illegally by the Lincoln County Commissioners. Wilson had deputized the Regulators and issued the warrants for Tunstall&#x27;s murderers. Axtell&#x27;s decree meant that the Regulators&#x27; actions, formerly considered legal, were now illegal. Axtell also was able to revoke Widenmann&#x27;s status as a Deputy US marshal, making Sheriff Brady and his men the only law officers of Lincoln County.

On April 1, 1878, the Regulators French, McNab, Middleton, Waite, Brown and McCarty (Billy the Kid) made ready in the corral behind Tunstall&#x27;s store before attacking Brady and his deputies on the main street of Lincoln. Brady died of at least a dozen gunshot wounds; Deputy George W. Hindman was also wounded fatally. McCarty and French broke cover and dashed to Brady&#x27;s body, possibly to get his arrest warrant for McSween or to recover McCarty&#x27;s rifle, which Brady had kept from a prior arrest. A surviving deputy, Billy Matthews, wounded both men with one bullet that passed through both of them. French&#x27;s wound was so severe that he had to be temporarily harbored by Sam Corbet in a crawlspace in Corbet&#x27;s house. Widenmann was also in the corral, but whether he participated was never ascertained: he claimed he was feeding Tunstall&#x27;s dog.

===Battle of Blazer&#x27;s Mill===

Three days after the murders of Brady and Hindman, the Regulators headed southwest from the area around Lincoln, reaching Blazer&#x27;s Mill, a sawmill and trading post that supplied beef to the Mescalero Apaches. They came upon the rancher Buckshot Roberts, listed on their arrest warrant as one of Tunstall&#x27;s murderers. In the ensuing shootout the Regulators mortally wounded Roberts, but he killed Brewer and wounded Middleton, Scurlock, Coe, and McCarty.

===Gunfight at Fritz Ranch===
After Brewer&#x27;s death, the Regulators elected McNab as their captain. On April 29, 1878, Sheriff Peppin was directing a posse that included the Jesse Evans Gang and the Seven Rivers Warriors. They engaged in a shootout with the Regulators McNab, Saunders, and Frank Coe at the Fritz Ranch. McNab died in the gunfire, Saunders was badly wounded, and Frank Coe was captured.

The next day, the Seven Rivers members Tom Green, Charles Marshall, Jim Patterson and John Galvin were killed in Lincoln, and although the Regulators were blamed, this was never proven. Frank Coe escaped custody some time after his capture, allegedly with the assistance of Deputy Sheriff Wallace Olinger, who gave him a pistol.

The day after McNab&#x27;s death the Regulators known as the &quot;iron clad&quot; assumed defensive positions in the town of Lincoln, trading shots with Dolan men and, allegedly, members of the US Army cavalry. &quot;Dutch Charley&quot; Kruling, a Dolan man, was wounded by rifle fire by George Coe. By allegedly shooting at government troops, the Regulators gained a new set of enemies. On May 15, the Regulators tracked down and captured the Jesse Evans gang member Manuel Segovia, who is believed to have shot McNab. They shot him during an alleged escape. Around the time of Segovia&#x27;s death, the Regulator &quot;iron clad&quot; gained a new member, a young Texas cowboy named Tom O&#x27;Folliard, who soon became McCarty&#x27;s best friend.

===Battle of Lincoln===

A large confrontation between the two forces occurred on the afternoon of July 15, 1878, when the Regulators were surrounded in Lincoln in two different positions; the McSween house and the Ellis store. Opposing them were the Dolan/Murphy/Seven Rivers cowboys. In the Ellis store were Scurlock, Bowdre, Middleton, Frank Coe, and several others. About 20 Mexican Regulators, commanded by Josefita Chavez, were also positioned around town. In the McSween house were Alex McSween and his wife Susan, Billy the Kid, Henry Brown, Jim French, Tom O&#x27;Folliard, Jose Chavez y Chavez, George Coe, and a dozen Mexican vaqueros.

During the next three days, the men exchanged shots and shouts. Tom Cullens, one of the McSween house defenders, was killed by a stray bullet. Around this time, Henry Brown, George Coe, and Joe Smith left the McSween house and went to the Tunstall store, where they chased two Dolan men into an outhouse with rifle fire and forced them to dive into the bottom to escape. The impasse continued until the arrival of US Army troops commanded by Colonel Nathan Dudley. When these troops pointed cannons at the Ellis store and other positions, Billy the Kid, Doc Scurlock and his men fled from their positions, as did Chavez&#x27;s cowboys, leaving those remaining in the McSween house to their fate.

On the afternoon of July 19, the Murphy-Dolan faction set the house afire. As the flames spread and night began, Susan McSween and the other woman and five children were granted safe passage out of the house, while the men inside continued to fight the fire. By 9 pm, those left inside got set to flee out the back door of the burning house. Billy the Kid and Jim French assessed their situation, and figured out a way to escape by using pistol fire as cover and escaping. Jim French went out first, followed by Billy the Kid, O&#x27;Folliard, and Jose Chavez y Chavez. The Dolan men saw them running and began shooting, killing Harvey Morris, McSween&#x27;s law partner. Some troopers moved into the back yard to take those left into custody when a close-quarters gunfight erupted. Alexander McSween and the Seven Rivers cowboy Bob Beckwith both died. Three other Mexican Regulators got away in the confusion, to rendezvous with the &quot;iron clad&quot; members yards away.

==Aftermath==
The Lincoln County War accomplished little other than to foster distrust and animosity in the area. The surviving Regulators, most notably Billy the Kid, continued as fugitives. Gradually, his fellow gunmen scattered to their various fates. Billy rode with Bowdre, O&#x27;Folliard, Dave Rudabaugh, and a few other friends, with whom he rustled cattle and committed other crimes. Eventually sheriff Pat Garrett and his posse tracked and killed O&#x27;Folliard, Bowdre, and, in July 1881, the &quot;Kid&quot;. The three men were buried at Fort Sumner, New Mexico.

The Posse Comitatus Act, signed into law June 18, 1878, would have prevented the use of federal troops for domestic law enforcement, but President Hayes invoked the Insurrection Act of 1807 on October 7.

Murphy died of cancer on October 20, 1878, about the age of 47. Susan McSween hired attorney Huston Chapman to pursue charges against Dolan and others, in addition to working for amnesty for the Regulators. On February 18, 1879, one year to the day after Tunstall was murdered, Evans and Billy Campbell killed Chapman, then fled the territory. That murder also was attributed to Dolan, though his involvement was never proven. Dolan was indicted for the murder of Tunstall, but was acquitted. He later acquired all of Tunstall&#x27;s property before dying on his ranch in 1898, aged 49. Susan McSween took over a large sum of land in the years after the Lincoln County War ended, establishing a ranch in Three Rivers, New Mexico. By the mid-1890s her ranch holdings were some of the largest in the territory. She averaged during this time between 3,000 and 5,000 head of cattle. She died a wealthy woman on January 3, 1931, aged 85.

<text>The persimmon () is the edible fruit of a number of species of trees in the genus &quot;Diospyros&quot;. The most widely cultivated of these is the kaki persimmon, &quot;Diospyros kaki&quot; &quot;Diospyros&quot; is in the family Ebenaceae, and a number of non-persimmon species of the genus are grown for ebony timber. In 2022, China produced 77% of the world&#x27;s persimmons.

== Description ==

Like the tomato, the persimmon is not a berry in the general culinary sense, but its morphology as a single fleshy fruit derived from the ovary of a single flower means it is a berry in the botanical sense. The tree &quot;Diospyros kaki&quot; is the most widely cultivated species of persimmon. Typically the tree reaches in height and is round-topped. It usually stands erect, but sometimes can be crooked or have a willowy appearance.
The leaves are long, and are oblong in shape with brown-hairy petioles in length. They are leathery and glossy on the upper surface, brown and silky underneath. The leaves are deciduous and bluish-green in color. In autumn, they turn to yellow, orange, or red.

Persimmon trees are typically dioecious, meaning male and female flowers are produced on separate trees. Some trees have both male and female flowers and in rare cases may bear a perfect flower, which contains both male and female reproductive organs in one flower. Male flowers are pink and appear in groups of three. They have a four-parted calyx, a corolla, and 24 stamens in two rows. Female flowers are creamy-white and appear singly. They have a large calyx, a four-parted, yellow corolla, eight undeveloped stamens, and a rounded ovary bearing the style and stigma. &#x27;Perfect&#x27; flowers are a cross between the two.

Persimmon fruit matures late in the fall and can stay on the tree until winter. In color, the ripe fruit of the cultivated strains range from glossy light yellow-orange to dark red-orange depending on the species and variety. They similarly vary in size from in diameter, and in shape the varieties may be spherical, acorn-, or pumpkin-shaped. The flesh is astringent until fully ripe and is yellow, orange, or dark-brown in color. The calyx generally remains attached to the fruit after harvesting, but becomes easy to remove once the fruit is ripe. The ripe fruit is high in sucrose, mainly in the form of fructose and glucose content, and is sweet in taste.

=== Chemistry ===
Persimmon fruits contain the phytochemicals catechin, gallocatechin and betulinic acid.

== Taxonomy ==

===Selected species===


While many species of &quot;Diospyros&quot; bear fruit inedible to humans or only occasionally gathered, the following are grown for their edible fruit:

====&quot;Diospyros kaki&quot; (Oriental persimmon)====
Oriental persimmon, Chinese persimmon or Japanese persimmon (&quot;Diospyros kaki&quot;) is the most commercially important persimmon. It is native to China, Northeast India and northern Indochina. It was first cultivated in China more than 2,000 years ago, and introduced to Japan in the 7th century and to Korea in the 14th century. China, Japan and South Korea are also the top producers of persimmon. It is known as &quot;shi&quot; (柿) in Chinese, &quot;kaki&quot; (柿) in Japanese and &quot;gam&quot; (감) in Korean and also known as Korean mango. It is known as &quot;haluwabed&quot; (हलुवाबेद) in Nepal and it is used for various culinary purposes and eaten as a seasonal fruit. In Nepal, it is one of the most popular fruits and has been consumed for a very long time. It was introduced to California and southern Europe in the 1800s and to Brazil in the 1890s, in the State of São Paulo, afterwards spreading across Brazil with Japanese immigrants; the State of São Paulo is still the greatest producer within Brazil, with an area of dedicated to persimmon culture in 2003; It is deciduous, with broad, stiff leaves. Its fruits are sweet and slightly tangy with a soft to occasionally fibrous texture. 

=====Varieties=====

Numerous cultivars have been selected. Some varieties are edible in the crisp, firm state but it has its best flavor when allowed to rest and soften slightly after harvest. The Japanese cultivar &#x27;Hachiya&#x27; is widely grown. The fruit has a high tannin content, which makes the unripe fruit astringent and bitter. The tannin levels are reduced as the fruit matures. Persimmons like &#x27;Hachiya&#x27; must be completely ripened before consumption. When ripe, this fruit consists of thick, pulpy jelly encased in a waxy thin-skinned shell.

Commercially and in general, there are two types of persimmon fruit: astringent and non-astringent.

The heart-shaped Hachiya is the most common variety of astringent persimmon. Astringent persimmons contain very high levels of soluble tannins and are unpalatable if eaten before completely softened. The astringency of tannins is removed in various ways. Examples include ripening by exposure to light for several days and wrapping the fruit in paper (probably because this increases the ethylene concentration of the surrounding air). Ethylene ripening can be increased in reliability and evenness, and the process can be greatly accelerated by adding ethylene gas to the atmosphere in which the fruit is stored. For domestic purposes, the most convenient and effective process is to store the ripening persimmons in a clean, dry container together with other varieties of fruit that give off particularly large quantities of ethylene while they are ripening; apples and related fruits such as pears are effective, as well as bananas and several others. Other chemicals are used commercially in artificially ripening persimmons or delaying their ripening. Examples include alcohol and carbon dioxide, which change tannin into the insoluble form. Such bletting processes sometimes are jump-started by exposing the fruit to cold or frost. The resultant cell damage stimulates the release of ethylene, which promotes cellular wall breakdown. Astringent varieties of persimmons also can be prepared for commercial purposes by drying. Tanenashi fruit will occasionally contain a seed or two, which can be planted and will yield a larger, more vertical tree than when merely grafted onto the &quot;D. virginiana&quot; rootstock most commonly used in the U.S. Such seedling trees may produce fruit that bears more seeds, usually six to eight per fruit, and the fruit itself may vary slightly from the parent tree. Seedlings are said to be more susceptible to root nematodes.

The non-astringent persimmon is squat like a tomato and is most commonly sold as &quot;fuyu&quot;. Non-astringent persimmons are not actually free of tannins as the term suggests but rather are far less astringent before ripening and lose more of their tannic quality sooner. Non-astringent persimmons may be consumed when still very firm and remain edible when very soft.

There is a third type, less commonly available, the pollination-variant non-astringent persimmons. When fully pollinated, the flesh of these fruit is brown inside—known as &quot;goma&quot; in Japan—and the fruit can be eaten when firm. These varieties are highly sought after. Tsurunoko, sold as &quot;chocolate persimmon&quot; for its dark brown flesh, Maru, sold as &quot;cinnamon persimmon&quot; for its spicy flavor, and Hyakume, sold as &quot;brown sugar&quot;, are the three best known.

====&quot;Diospyros lotus&quot; (date-plum)====
Date-plum (&quot;Diospyros lotus&quot;), also known as lotus persimmon, is native to temperate Asia and southeast Europe. Its English name probably derives from Persian &quot;Khormaloo&quot; خرمالو literally &quot;date-plum&quot;, referring to the taste of this fruit, which is reminiscent of both plums and dates.

==== &quot;Diospyros decandra&quot; ====
&quot;Diospyros decandra&quot; is native to Mainland Southeast Asia and its fruit peel is golden yellow.

====&quot;Diospyros virginiana&quot; (American persimmon)====
American persimmon (&quot;Diospyros virginiana&quot;) is native to the eastern United States. Harvested in the fall or after the first frost, its fruit is eaten fresh, in baked goods, in steamed puddings, and to make a mildly alcoholic beverage called persimmon beer.

==== &quot;Diospyros blancoi&quot; (velvet persimmon) ====
The Mabolo or velvet-apple (&quot;Diospyros blancoi&quot;; syn. &quot;Diospyros discolor&quot;) is native to Taiwan, the Philippines and Borneo.

====&quot;Diospyros texana&quot; (Texas persimmon)====
Texas persimmon (&quot;Diospyros texana&quot;) is native to central and west Texas and southwest Oklahoma in the United States, and eastern Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas in northeastern Mexico. The fruit of &quot;D. texana&quot; are black, subglobose berries with a diameter of that ripen in August.
The fleshy berries become edible when they turn dark purple or black, at which point they are sweet and can be eaten from the hand or made into pudding or custard.

=== Etymology ===
The word &quot;persimmon&quot; is derived from &quot;putchamin&quot;, &quot;pasiminan&quot;, &quot;pechimin&quot; or &quot;pessamin&quot;, from Powhatan, an Algonquian language of the southern and eastern United States, meaning &quot;a dry fruit&quot;. Other sources have suggested that the word &quot;persimmon&quot; comes from a Persian word meaning date-plum. It was first used in English in the early 17th century.

==Production==


In 2022, world production of persimmons was 4.44 million tonnes, led by China with 77% of the total (table).

In China, the Taiqiu persimmon variety yields approximately 30 tonnes of fruit per year at full production.

===Australia===
The persimmon was introduced to Australia by Chinese immigrants in the 1850s. Only astringent varieties were cultivated until the introduction of non-astringent varieties from Japan in the 1970s. In 2022 the vast majority of persimmons sold domestically in Australia were non-astringent varieties.

===Azerbaijan=== 
Persimmons are one of Azerbaijan&#x27;s most important non-petroleum exports. The main export markets are Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Iran, Kazakhstan and the United Arab Emirates.

===India===

Persimmons have various local names across India, including &quot;japani phal&quot; or &quot;amar phal&quot; in Uttar Pradesh, &quot;amlok&quot; in Assam, &quot;lukum&quot; in Manipur, and &quot;Seemai Panichai&quot; in Tamilnadu. They are grown in Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Darjeeling Region of West Bengal &amp; Arunachal Pradesh.

===Israel===
The primary variety produced in Israel is the Sharon fruit. Israel produces of Sharon fruit a year.

&quot;Sharon fruit&quot; (named after the Sharon plain in Israel) is the marketing name for the Israeli-bred cultivar &#x27;Triumph&#x27;. As with most commercial pollination-variant-astringent persimmons, the fruit are ripened off the tree by exposing them to carbon dioxide. The &quot;sharon fruit&quot; has no core, is seedless and particularly sweet, and can be eaten whole.

===Spain===
The primary variety produced in Spain is the Rojo Brillante. Spain produces 400,000 tons of Rojo Brillante a year.

In the Valencia region of Spain, there is a production area of kaki called the &quot;Ribera del Xùquer&quot; which has a protected label and where only persimmons of the variety &quot;Rojo Brillante&quot; or derived mutations are cultivated. The largest part of these astringent type persimmons are CO2 treated to remove astringency and marketed as &quot;Persimon&quot; with one &quot;m&quot;, which is a registered trademark.

===United States===
California produces of Fuyu a year. Most persimmons produced in California are seedless. California and Florida account for most commercial production. The first commercial orchards in Florida were planted in the 1870s and production peaked in the 1990s before declining. Most persimmon orchards in the US are small scale (70% less than and 90% less than ).

==Toxicity==
Unripe persimmons contain the soluble tannin shibuol, which, upon contact with a weak acid, polymerizes in the stomach and forms a gluey coagulum, a &quot;foodball&quot; or phytobezoar, that can affix with other stomach matter. These phytobezoars are often very hard and almost woody in consistency. More than 85% of phytobezoars are caused by ingestion of unripened persimmons. Persimmon bezoars (diospyrobezoars) often occur in epidemics in regions where the fruit is grown.

==Uses==

Persimmons are eaten fresh, dried, raw or cooked. When eaten fresh, they are usually eaten whole like an apple in bite-size slices and may be peeled, although the skin is edible. One way to consume ripe persimmons, which may have soft texture, is to remove the top leaf with a paring knife and scoop out the flesh with a spoon. Riper persimmons can also be eaten by removing the top leaf, breaking the fruit in half, and eating from the inside out. The flesh ranges from firm to mushy, and, when firm owing to being unripe, has an apple-like crunch. Some varieties are completely inedible until they are fully ripe, such as American persimmons (&quot;Diospyros virginiana&quot;) and &quot;Diospyros digyna&quot;. The leaves can be used to make a tisane and the seeds can be roasted.

In Korea, dried persimmon fruits are used to make the traditional Korean spicy punch &quot;sujeonggwa&quot;, while the matured, fermented fruit is used to make a persimmon vinegar called &quot;gamsikcho&quot;.

In Taiwan, fruits of astringent varieties are sealed in jars filled with limewater to get rid of bitterness. Slightly hardened in the process, they are sold under the name &quot;crisp persimmon&quot; (&quot;cuishi&quot;) or &quot;water persimmon&quot; (&quot;shuishizi&quot;). Preparation time is dependent upon temperature (5 to 7 days at .

For centuries, Japanese have consumed persimmon leaf tea (Kaki-No-Ha Cha) made from the dried leaves of &quot;kaki&quot; persimmons (&quot;Diospyros kaki&quot;). In some areas of Manchuria and Korea, the dried leaves of the fruit are used for making tea. The Korean name for this tea is &quot;gamnip cha&quot;.

In the US from Ohio southward, persimmons are harvested and used in a variety of dessert dishes, most notably pies. They can be used in cookies, cakes, puddings, salads, curries and as a topping for breakfast cereal. Persimmon pudding is a baked dessert made with fresh persimmons that has the consistency of pumpkin pie but resembles a brownie and is almost always topped with whipped cream. An annual persimmon festival, featuring a persimmon pudding contest, is held every September in Mitchell, Indiana.

Persimmons may be stored at room temperature where they will continue to ripen. In northern China, unripe persimmons are frozen outdoors during winter to speed up the ripening process.

Ripe persimmons can be refrigerated for as long as a couple of weeks, though extreme temperature changes may contribute to a mushy texture. It is recommended to store persimmons stem end down.

Persimmons can also be fermented in the manner of black garlic.

===Dried===

In China, Korea, Japan and Vietnam, persimmons after harvesting are prepared using traditional hand-drying techniques outdoors for two to three weeks. The fruit is then further dried by exposure to heat over several days before being shipped to market, to be sold as dried fruit. In Japan, the dried persimmon fruit is called &quot;hoshigaki&quot;, in China &quot;shìbǐng&quot; (柿餠), in Korea &quot;gotgam&quot; or &quot;Geonsi&quot; (乾枾), and in Vietnam &quot;hồng khô&quot; (紅枯). It is eaten as a snack or dessert and used for other culinary purposes.

=== Nutrition ===
Persimmons have higher levels of dietary fiber and some dietary minerals than apples, but overall are not a significant source of micronutrients, except for manganese (17% of the Daily Value, DV) and provitamin A beta-carotene (10% DV, table for raw Japanese persimmons per 100-gram amount). Raw American persimmons are a rich source of vitamin C (80% DV per 100g) and iron (19% DV).

==Culture==
In Ozark folklore, the severity of the upcoming winter is said to be predictable by slicing a persimmon seed and seeing whether it is shaped like a knife, fork, or spoon within. According to the Missouri Department of Conservation, this is not a reliable method.

In Korean folklore the dried persimmon (gotgam, Korean: 곶감) has a reputation for scaring away tigers.

In Malaysia and Singapore, large persimmons are viewed as a status symbol.

==Diseases==
In 1999, the first report of leaf blight on sweet persimmon tree by fungal pathogen &quot;Pestalotiopsis theae&quot; in Spain was documented.
