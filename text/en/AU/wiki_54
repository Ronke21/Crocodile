<text>Temple Newsam (historically Temple Newsham), is a Tudor-Jacobean house in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, with grounds landscaped by Capability Brown. The house is a Grade I listed building, one of nine Leeds Museums and Galleries sites and part of the research group, &quot;Yorkshire Country House Partnership&quot;.

The estate lends its name to the Temple Newsam ward of Leeds City Council, in which it is situated, and lies to the east of the city, just south of Halton Moor, Halton, Whitkirk and Colton.

==History==

=== 1066 to 1520 ===

In the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 the manor is listed as &quot;Neuhusam&quot; (meaning new houses) and was held by Ilbert de Lacy and his sons. Before the Norman Conquest of 1066 it had been held by Dunstan and Glunier, Anglo-Saxon thanes. In about 1155, Henry de Lacy gave it to the Knights Templar, who built Temple Newsam Preceptory on a site near the present house. The Templars farmed the estate very efficiently, with 1,100 animals. In 1307 the Templars were suppressed, and Edward II granted the manor to Sir Robert Holland who held it until 1323 when he was deprived of his estates. The Knights Hospitaller tried to acquire the estate but they were forced to surrender and in 1327 it was granted to Mary de St Pol, the Countess of Pembroke, who held the manor for 50 years. In 1377 by royal decree the estate reverted to Philip Darcy, 4th Baron Darcy de Knayth (1341–1398). It then passed through several members of the Darcy family, until it was inherited by the 21-year old Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy de Darcy in 1488. Between 1500 and 1520 a Tudor manor house, known as &quot;Temple Newsam House&quot;, was built on the site. It has also been spelled &quot;Newsham&quot; in the past.

=== 1500 to 1650 ===
In 1537 Thomas, Lord Darcy was executed for the part he played in the Pilgrimage of Grace and the property was seized by the Crown. In 1544 Henry VIII gave it to his niece Lady Margaret Douglas (Countess of Lennox), and she lived there with her husband Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox. Their son Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, who was born in the house in 1545 and educated there, married Mary, Queen of Scots, by whom he was the father of King James VI of Scotland and I of England. A portrait of Henry and his brother was probably intended to represent the interior of Temple Newsam despite being based on a print of an ideal interior. Following the marriage in 1565, Temple Newsam was seized by Queen Elizabeth I and was managed by an agent.

In 1609 King James I, successor to Elizabeth, granted the estate to his Franco-Scottish second cousin Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox (1574–1624), who was a favourite of the King and given many titles and estates, including farmland and coalmines in the local area. Despite his opportunities, Ludovic was in constant debt and he mortgaged the estate in 1614 for the sum of £9,000 (around £860,000 in today&#x27;s money). In 1622 Lennox began the sale of the estate to Sir Arthur Ingram ( – 1642), a Yorkshire-born London merchant, civil servant, investor in colonial ventures and arms dealer, for £12,000, which he paid in two instalments, the last in July 1624, after Lennox&#x27;s death. During the next 20 years the mansion was rebuilt, incorporating some of the previous house in the west wing. The north and south wings were rebuilt and the east wing was demolished after a bad fire in 1635. Arthur&#x27;s son, also called Arthur, inherited the estate with its debts and continued the building and renovation work. Six months after Charles I was beheaded in 1649, Arthur Ingram the younger was declared delinquent and he compounded his estates and retired to Temple Newsam.

=== 1650 to 1900 ===
After the death of Arthur the younger&#x27;s eldest son, Thomas, in 1660, Temple Newsam was inherited by Arthur&#x27;s second son, Henry Ingram, 1st Viscount of Irvine (created a peer of Scotland as Baron Ingram and Viscount of Irvine in 1661 – although the family used the English form &quot;Irwin&quot;). In 1661, Henry married Lady Essex Montagu, daughter of Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester, a favourite of Charles II. The estate then passed through Henry&#x27;s two sons and five grandsons, the last being Henry Ingram, 7th Viscount of Irvine. The 4th Viscount brought back paintings from his Grand Tour of 1704–07. Extant receipts from 1692 show women as well as men were employed to work the estate in haymaking. In 1712, William Etty designed a new approach to the house, with a bridge and ponds. In 1714, Temple Newsam was inherited by Rich Ingram, 5th Viscount of Irvine, and his wife Anne who spent a vast fortune furnishing the house and creating the East Avenue. Between 1738 and 1746, Henry Ingram, 7th Viscount of Irvine remodelled the west and north wings of the house, creating new bedrooms and dressing rooms and the picture gallery. A painting in Leeds Art Gallery by Philippe Mercier of shows Henry and his wife standing in front of Temple Newsam House.In the 1760s, Charles Ingram, 9th Viscount of Irvine, employed Capability Brown to re-landscape the park on the insistence of his wife, Frances Shepheard, daughter of Samuel Shepheard. Reflecting her interest in pastoral landscape design, Frances is depicted as a shepherdess in a portrait by Benjamin Wilson at Temple Newsam. Both Frances and Charles were actively involved in the design and implementation. Some aspects of Brown&#x27;s plan depicted in paintings by James Chapman and Michael Angelo Rooker were never completed such as a large lake near the house. Extant financial records show that in 1759 women as well as men were employed as garden labourers. After Charles died in 1778, Frances rebuilt the south wing in 1796; she lived at Temple Newsam until her death in 1807.

Charles and Frances&#x27;s eldest daughter Isabella Ingram, (later Marchioness of Hertford) (d.1834) who inherited Temple Newsam, was the mistress of the Prince of Wales (later King George IV) from 1806 to 1819. In 1806, George visited Temple Newsam and presented Isabella with Chinese wallpaper, which she hung in the small Drawing Room next to the Great Hall in around 1820, embellished with cut out birds from Audubon&#x27;s &quot;The Birds of America&quot; (now worth £7.5 million). Lady Hertford inherited the house in 1807; after her husband died in 1822 she spent the season in London, and the rest of the time at Temple Newsam where she involved herself in charitable works including distributing food and clothing to the local people. She allowed the servants to hold an annual supper and ball at Temple Newsam. Reports of poachers were made during 1826 and 1827. During the last years of Isabella&#x27;s life, the canal, railway and roads encroached on the estate as well as coal mining; and she dealt with the companies setting these up. In 1820 the novelist Sir Walter Scott published &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; featuring a Templar preceptory named Temple Stowe, believed to have been modelled on Temple Newsam; the name is preserved in local road names such as Templestowe Crescent. At her death in 1834, Isabella left Temple Newsam to her widowed sister, Frances Ingram Shepheard, wife of Lord William Gordon, who died in 1841.In 1841 the estate was inherited by Hugo Charles Meynell Ingram (d. 1869), son of Elizabeth Ingram, sister of Frances Ingram (Lady Gordon), who made no alterations to the estate. In 1868, the Prince of Wales stayed at Temple Newsam during his visit to Leeds to open the Fine Art Exhibition in the New Leeds General Infirmary; temporary triumphal arches were erected on the estate. Following Hugo Charles&#x27;s death, his son Hugo Meynell-Ingram (d.1871) inherited Temple Newsam; two years later, at his death, his wife Emily Meynell-Ingram (d.1904) inherited the estate. Emily spent a large part of her widowhood at Temple Newsam; she developed it considerably by replacing the sash windows and remodelling the dining room, great staircase and Lord Darnley&#x27;s room. Emily bequeathed Temple Newsam to her nephew Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax.

=== 20th century ===
In 1909, of the estate at Knostrop were compulsorily purchased by Leeds Corporation to build a sewage plant. During the First World War (1914–17) the south wing of the house was turned into a hospital by Edward Wood and his wife Dorothy. Edward Wood fought in France as part of the Yorkshire Hussars, whilst Dorothy oversaw the running of the hospital as part of the Mayors War Committee. In 1922 Edward Wood sold the park and house to Leeds Corporation for a nominal sum, placing covenants over them to ensure their preservation for the future.

On 19 October 1923, Temple Newsam was opened to the public along with a golf course. In the &quot;Derby Daily Telegraph&quot; newspaper, Temple Newsam was compared to Hampton Court Palace. Despite many people visiting the house and using the golf course, the Corporation lost money during the first decade mostly due to poor farming practices. In July 1932, the Great Yorkshire Show was held at Temple Newsam and was a great success. Preparations for war were made as early as April 1939, and in August, small items were being packed up for storage. In September 1939, Temple Newsam was closed to the public and items were moved there for storage from Leeds Art Gallery. It was decided that objects would be displayed, and the house was officially reopened in November 1939, when it was again likened to Hampton Court in the press.

== Architecture ==
Remains of the early 16th century house were retained in the new building, including the brickwork and bay windows in the centre of the west front. The plan of the new house was a conservative E-shape. The Long Gallery and entrance hall in the south wing followed Elizabethan and early Jacobean styles. The entrance porch has Classical columns but they are of Flemish design, rather than following correct Italian design. There are Tudor doorways and timberwork in the cellars, which are largely Tudor in date. Tudor features have also been discovered beneath later layers of decoration, including Lord Darcy&#x27;s crest scratched into the plaster in the Blue Damask room. An inventory of 1565 indicates that the hall, great chamber (later the dining room), gallery and chapel (later the kitchen) were probably where they are now. There is a Tudor doorway in the north wing which was probably the entrance to the original chapel.

In the 17th century, the south and north wings were rebuilt and the east wing demolished, replaced by a low wall with an arched gateway, giving the house a fashionable &#x27;half-H&#x27; appearance. It is possible that the man who made plans for the alteration was Bernard Dinninghof of York. There is also some resemblance to designs by Inigo Jones. Round the top of the house, letters appear in a balustrade, declaring the piety and loyalty of Sir Arthur Ingram: &quot;All Glory And Praise Be Given To God The Father The Son And Holy Ghost On High Peace On Earth Good Will Towards Men Honour And True Allegiance To Our Gracious King Loving Affection Amongst His Subjects Health And Plenty Be Within This House&quot; The chapel in the north wing retains some 17th century features, such as armorial stained glass, probably by Henry Gyles and a carved wooden pulpit by Thomas Ventris, made around 1636, with geometric patterns, pilasters and friezes. The walls had panels of Old Testament figures, painted by John Carleton. An inventory dated 1667 records that the House had 66 rooms and 11 outhouses. An engraving by Kip and Knyff dated 1699 is an accurate representation of the house, showing the varying height of the house and some buildings that were later demolished, including the arched gateway flanked by two small lodges and a detached garden building dating from the mid-1670s.
In 1718, the steward of Temple Newsam suggested an underground service passage to link the north and south wings to the 5th Viscount, who agreed. This tunnel linked the original kitchens in the south wing to the rest of the house. In 1738, Henry, 7th Viscount Irwin wrote to his mother describing the neglected state of the house with windows coming away and cracked brickwork. The house was almost entirely remodelled by Henry. He wanted to follow Palladian design and used craftsmen from York to do so. He widened the gallery, improved the ceiling and windows and created additional rooms. The gallery, completed around 1746, has fine Rococo carvings with overmantle paintings of classical scenes by Antonio Joli. There are also elaborate gilded Rococo ornamental candle holders. The gallery ceiling has detailed stucco work including a medallion of George I. The ceilings in the new Saloon and Library, made from the old Long Gallery, were decorated by Thomas Perritt and Joseph Rose. The doorcases are elaborately carved, probably by Richard Fisher. Two chimney pieces in the Saloon were based on designs by William Kent. The distinctive sphinx gate piers by Lancelot Brown constructed in 1768 were based on designs published by Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington in 1738 and used at Chiswick House. The main rooms in the west wing were redecorated and the windows were replaced with sliding sash windows. A large pedimented stable block was built to the north of the house, in 1742 and probably designed by Daniel Garrett, also in the Palladian style. A painting by Mercier of around 1749, also shows a planned block to the south and a low wall connecting the north and south wings which were never completed.

In 1796, Frances Shepheard employed a Mr Johnson to alter and reface the south wing in a style which tried to copy that of Sir Arthur Ingram&#x27;s original house. Her approach was a departure from the designs for the wing commissioned by her dead husband from John Carr and Robert Adam, as well as the landscaping by Capability Brown who was also consulted about rebuilding the south wing. The wing was made two storeys high throughout with a suite of reception rooms on the ground floor with state bedchambers above. In the 1790s, the kitchens were moved to the north wing and the original kitchen became a brushing room where servants brushed down nobles returning from hunting parties.

At the end of the 19th century, Emily Meynell-Ingram replaced the sash windows with stone mullions and leaded lights and rebuilt the north porch adding the Meynell-Ingram coat of arms over the doorway. She redecorated several rooms and had the great oak staircase installed. The dining room, great staircase and Lord Darnley&#x27;s room were remodelled in Elizabethan style. In 1877, Emily converted the library at the east end of the gallery into a chapel.

== Coal mining on the estate ==
Estate records show the existence of coal pits in and around the park in the seventeenth century and Bell Wood to the south of the house would have had bell pits for coal extraction. A colliery at Halton village was leased to a number of different individuals from 1660 through to at least the 1790s. The leases generally required the leaseholder to supply coals to Temple Newsam house.

In 1815, William Fenton, one of the &#x27;Coal Kings&#x27; of Yorkshire, began the sinking of a mine shaft on the estate at Thorpe Stapleton. The colliery was named Waterloo to commemorate the famous battle of that year. Waterloo Colliery was operated as a royalty concession with contracted &#x27;rents&#x27; for coal extracted going to the Temple Newsam landowner. Fenton also had a village built for his workers on land between the River Aire and the Aire and Calder Navigation. The village was initially called &quot;Newmarket&quot; but then became &quot;Irwin Square&quot; on ordnance survey maps and &quot;Ingram Place&quot; on census lists, but it was commonly simply known as Waterloo. The Yorkshire, Lancashire and England cricketer Albert Ward was born here in 1865. The village had two rows of cottages and a school building. It was connected to the colliery by a wooden footbridge over the river. Deep coal mining on the estate ended with the closure of the Temple Pit of Waterloo Main Colliery in 1968. Opencast mining on the estate began in May 1942. Seven sites were exploited to the south of the house almost entirely destroying Capability Brown&#x27;s landscape. One site reached within of the South Terrace. It continued at the Gamblethorpe site as far as Dawson&#x27;s Wood, in full view of the house, until 1987. No trace of the opencast remains now as the parkland was re-landscaped.

In 2019 there was a temporary exhibition about coal mining at Temple Newsam which was called &#x27;Blot on the Landscape&#x27;.

==House and estate today==
The house and estate are owned by Leeds City Council and open to the public. The house has undergone substantial restoration to its exterior. There is an established programme of restoring rooms back to known previous configurations, reversing the numerous intrusive installations and modifications that took place during the building&#x27;s &quot;art museum&quot; phase.

The wider estate is made up of woods (the second largest part of the Forest of Leeds). There are sporting facilities for football, golf, running, cycling, horse-riding and orienteering. There is an innovative children&#x27;s playground opened in 2011 which caters for both disabled and able-bodied children. &quot;Pegasus Wood&quot;, to the south of the house, commemorates veterans of the Normandy Landing at Pegasus Bridge in 1944.

The &quot;Home Farm&quot;, open to the public, has a barn built in 1694 and is the largest working rare breeds farm in Europe, and only one of 16 nationally approved by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust. Breeds include Gloucester, Kerry, Irish Moiled, Red Poll, White Park, British White, Beef Shorthorn, Vaynol and Belted Galloway cattle; Kerry Hill; Whitefaced Woodland and Portland sheep, and Golden Guernsey goats. The farm was targeted by arsonists twice in 2011 with damage caused to buildings, and some animals killed.

There are extensive gardens, with a celebrated rhododendron walk and six National Plant Collections: Aster novi-belgii (Michaelmas daisies), Phlox paniculata, Delphinium elatum (Cultivars), Solenostemon scutellarioides (sys. Coleus blumei), Primula auricula and Chrysanthemum (Charm and Cascade cultivars). Within the &quot;Walled Garden&quot; there are 800 yards of herbaceous borders.

===Heritage designations===
The main house of Temple Newsam is a Grade I listed building. The grounds are designated as Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England. The neo-classical stable block and the Little Temple are both Grade II* listed. The north lodges and the nearby boundary walls are Grade II listed as are several buildings at Home Farm: the dovecote and laundry, a barn and the farmhouse. Several other structures at Temple Newsam are also Grade II listed, these are the Sphinx Gates, the walled garden, a cast-iron fountain, and a stone bridge.

== Collections ==

There are substantial holdings of fine and decorative art which are designated by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) as being of national significance.

The Picture Gallery, itself an important example of early English rococo style, includes artwork brought back from Europe by Edward 4th Viscount in the first decade of the 18th century, and ranging from paintings of seascapes, landscapes and battle scenes by Antonio Marini, whose portrait is also on display. 

The Picture Gallery also houses a fine suite of furniture commissioned from London furniture maker James Pascall. The suite&#x27;s floral upholstery was made using techniques including petit point needlework and French knots to depict sunflower seeds on the daybed. The Temple Newsam Picture Gallery Suite was the focus of a project in 2021 using microscopic technology to magnify the needlework up to 1,000 times and reveal detail down to individual threads.

Of most significant historical and cultural interest is the Chippendale Society collection of Chippendale works that are on permanent loan. In his book &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Museums and Galleries&quot;, Mark Fisher (a former Department for Culture, Media and Sport minister) gave the museum an excellent review. When interviewed on &quot;Front Row&quot;, BBC Radio 4, November 2004 Fisher placed Temple Newsam House in the top three non-national museums in the country, along with Birmingham&#x27;s Barber Institute and the Dulwich Picture Gallery.

==Events==

&quot;Party in the Park&quot; and &quot;Opera in the Park&quot; were annual ticketed concerts organised by Leeds City Council and Radio Aire, which respectively have accommodated 70,000 and 50,000 spectators. Both were held in July on the site from 1994 to 2014. They took place on the grassed area which slopes down at the front of the house.

An amphitheatre near the stables block is used for occasional open-air theatre performances, and the fields to the north of the Home Farm are used for various events such as Steam Fairs and Dog Shows.

In August 1997 and 1998 the estate was the site of the V Festival but, after the success of the event, this was replaced by a new northern leg of the Reading and Leeds Festivals from 1999, taking place the weekend after the regular V festival slot in August. The Leeds Festival however moved to Bramham Park after the 2002 event when the festival was marred by riots and violence in the festival grounds, and trouble in the surrounding estates of east Leeds.

Sven Vath hosted Cocoon in the Park every July with the organisers behind Mint Club and Mint Festival from 2009 to 2019.

In 2019 it became the new home to Slam Dunk Festival as it had grown and moved out of the city centre of Leeds. In 2019, they launched a new festival called Newsam Park.

Many other events take place at Temple Newsam, such as the Leeds Waggy Walk event for Dogs Trust and Race for Life for Cancer Research UK. Since early 2013, there has been a weekly Parkrun event.

In February 2024, Temple Newsam hosted the BUCS Cross Country Championships. Athletes from British Universities and Colleges, competed in four races of distances between 6,560 metres and 9,690 metres across Temple Newsam Park.

<text>Todmorden ( ; ) is a market town and civil parish in the Upper Calder Valley in Calderdale, West Yorkshire, England. It is north-east of Manchester, south-east of Burnley and west of Halifax. In 2011, it had a population of 15,481.

Todmorden is at the confluence of three steep-sided Pennine valleys and is surrounded by moorlands with outcrops of sandblasted gritstone.

The historic boundary between Yorkshire and Lancashire is the River Calder and its tributary, Walsden Water, which run through the town. The administrative border was altered by the Local Government Act 1888 placing the whole of the town within the West Riding.

The town is served by and railway stations.

==History==
===Etymology===
The name &quot;Todmorden&quot; is first attested in 1246, in the form &quot;Totmardene&quot;; other pre-modern spellings include &quot;Tottemerden&quot;, &quot;Totmereden&quot; and &quot;Totmerden&quot;. This is thought to originate in Old English as a personal name, &quot;Totta&quot;, combined with the Old English words &quot;mǣre&quot; (&#x27;border, boundary&#x27;) and &quot;denu&quot; (&#x27;valley&#x27;). Thus the name once meant &#x27;Totta&#x27;s border-valley&#x27;. The valley in question is thought to have been the one running north-west from the town, and the border the one between Lancashire and Yorkshire.

Although fanciful and historically implausible, alternative etymologies circulate, such as the speculation that the name derives from two words for death: German &quot;Tod&quot; and French &quot;mort&quot;, or that the name meant &quot;marshy den of the fox&quot;, supposedly from &quot;tod&quot;, a word of uncertain origin meaning &#x27;fox&#x27; first attested around 1200, &quot;moor&quot; (which in Old English meant &#x27;marsh&#x27;), and &quot;den&quot; (also attested in Old English to mean an animal&#x27;s lair).

&#x27;Tod&#x27; is an informal name for Todmorden, often used in everyday conversation.

===Prehistory===
In 1898, Blackheath Barrow—a ring cairn monument situated above Cross Stone in Todmorden—was excavated and proved to be a site of &quot;surpassing archaeological interest&quot;, according to J. Lawton Russell, one of the men who carried out the excavation. Various Bronze Age items were discovered, including sepulchral urns, a human skull, teeth and hands.

Russell contended that Blackheath Barrow was primarily a religious site, specifically intended for the &quot;performance of funeral rites&quot;, as there was no evidence that it had been settled for domestic use. Of particular interest were the four cairns, positioned at the cardinal points of the compass, and it has been suggested that this indicates &quot;a ritual evocation of the airts, or spirits of the four directions, with obvious correlates in relation to spirits in the land of the dead&quot;.

The various finds from the 1898 dig are now housed in the Todmorden Library, on permanent display.

===Early history===

Settlement in medieval Todmorden was dispersed, most people living in scattered farms or in isolated hilltop agricultural settlements. Packhorse trails were marked by ancient stones, of which many still survive.

For hundreds of years, streams from the surrounding hills provided water for corn and fulling mills. Todmorden grew to relative prosperity by combining farming with the production of woollen textiles. Some yeomen clothiers were able to build fine houses, a few of which still exist today. Increasingly, though, the area&#x27;s industry turned to cotton. The proximity of Manchester, as a source of material and trade, was undoubtedly a strong factor. Another was that the strong Pennine streams and rivers were able to power the machine looms. Improvements in textile machinery (by John Kay, James Hargreaves and Richard Arkwright), along with the development of turnpike roads (1751–1781), helped to develop the new cotton industry and to increase the local population.

===19th century===
In 1801, most people still lived in the uplands; Todmorden itself could be considered as a mere village. During the years 1800–1845, great changes took place in the communications and transport of the town which were to have a crucial effect on promoting industrial growth. These included the building of: (1) better roads; (2) the Rochdale Canal (1804); and (3) the main line of the Manchester and Leeds Railway (1841), which became the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway in 1847. This railway line incorporated the (then) longest tunnel in the world, the Summit Tunnel. A second railway, from Todmorden to Burnley, opened as a single line in 1849, being doubled to meet demand in 1860. A short connecting line, from Stansfield Hall to Hall Royd, completed the &quot;Todmorden Triangle&quot; in 1862, thus enabling trains to travel in all three directions (Manchester, Leeds and Burnley) without reversing.

The Industrial Revolution caused a concentration of industry and settlement along the valley floor and a switch from woollens to cotton. One family in the area was particularly influential on the town; the Fielden family. They created a &quot;dynasty&quot; that changed the town forever by establishing several large mills, putting up assorted impressive buildings and bringing about social and educational change.

A double murder took place at Christ Church, Todmorden on 2 March 1868. The victims&#x27; graves lie in the churchyard. Miles Weatherhill, a 23-year-old weaver from the town, was forbidden from seeing his housemaid sweetheart, Sarah Bell, by the Reverend Anthony John Plow. Armed with four pistols and an axe, Weatherhill took revenge first on the vicar and then on Jane Smith, another maid who had informed Plow of the secret meetings. Miss Smith died at the scene, while the vicar survived another week before succumbing to his injuries. Weatherhill also seriously injured the vicar&#x27;s wife. On 4 April 1868, Weatherhill became the last person to be publicly hanged in Manchester, at the New Bailey prison. Local legend has it that the face of a young woman is sometimes seen in the window of the vicarage, now in private ownership.

===20th century===
Throughout the first decade of the 20th century, the population of the Borough of Todmorden remained constant. The ten-yearly UK census returns show figures of 25,418 in 1901 and 25,404 in 1911. Like the rest of the Upper Calder Valley, Todmorden&#x27;s economy experienced a slow decline from around the end of World War I onwards, accelerating after World War II until around the late 1970s. During this period there was a painful restructuring of the local economy with the closure of mills and the demise of heavy industry.

On 1 January 1907, Todmorden Corporation became only the second municipality in the British Isles to operate a motor bus service. By the end of that year, the fleet had expanded to five double-deck vehicles: two by Critchley-Norris, two by Lancashire Steam (predecessor of Leyland Motors) and one by Ryknield. In 1931, the service became jointly operated by the Corporation and the LMS railway under the name &quot;Todmorden Joint Omnibus Committee&quot;. At its maximum size in the 1940s and 1950s, the undertaking operated 40 vehicles over 50 route miles (80 km) through the rugged South Pennine terrain.

Until 1938, the town was served by no fewer than six railway stations: Todmorden, Stansfield Hall, Cornholme, Portsmouth, Walsden and Eastwood. With the exception of Todmorden railway station, all closed during the middle third of the 20th century although Walsden railway station reopened on 10 September 1990 on a site a few yards north of the original 1845 railway station. In December 1984, a goods train carrying petrol derailed in the Summit Tunnel between Todmorden and Littleborough causing what is still considered as one of the biggest underground fires in transport history.

In 1980, Todmorden found itself at the centre of a celebrated murder enquiry. On 11 June that year police were called to J.W. Parker&#x27;s coal yard in Todmorden after the discovery of a body, subsequently identified as 56-year-old Zigmund Adamski from Tingley, near Wakefield. The former coal miner had not been seen since setting out on a local shopping trip five days earlier. Although still wearing a suit, his shirt, watch and wallet were missing. A post-mortem established that he died of a heart attack earlier that day, and discovered burns on his neck, shoulders and back of his head. These appeared to have been dressed by a green ointment, which toxicology tests were unable to identify. Adamski&#x27;s case has never been solved, no suspect was ever arrested and in a television documentary the coroner, James Turnbull, described it as &quot;one of the most puzzling cases I&#x27;ve come across in 25 years&quot;. Among the explanations to gain currency was that Adamski was the victim of extraterrestrial abduction, following comments by police officer Alan Godfrey about what he saw on 29 November 1980, described in Jenny Randles&#x27; 1983 book &quot;The Pennine UFO Mystery&quot;. After intense media interest, the Todmorden police force were forbidden from talking further to the press about the case. In 2017, &quot;Blurry Photos&quot; host Dave Stecco said he believes that Adamski could have been a Nazi before immigrating from Poland.

In the 1980s and 1990s, a prominent lesbian intentional community grew up Todmorden — and subsequently Hebden Bridge — &quot;promot[ing] forms of queer intimacy outside of the nuclear family unit&quot;, with &quot;a close-knit community of care&quot; and mutual support, sharing child care and community events, such as a &quot;famous Todmorden Women&#x27;s Disco&quot; held monthly. The nature of that community has changed with evolving queer politics, away from lesbian feminism and towards &quot;homonormative assimilation&quot;.

===21st century===
In 2008, a group of local residents initiated the Incredible Edible project to raise awareness of food issues and in particular local food and food provenance. The project has been responsible for the planting of 40 public fruit and vegetable gardens throughout the town, with each plot inviting passers-by to help themselves to the open source produce. The project has attracted publicity, media attention and visitors and the idea has been replicated in at least fifteen towns and villages in the UK.

==Governance==

Todmorden has a complex geo-administrative history. It lies along the historic county boundary of Yorkshire and Lancashire.

Until the boundary reformation by the Local Government Act 1888, the Lancashire-Yorkshire boundary ran through the centre of Todmorden, following the River Calder to the north-west and the Walsden Water for less than to the south before turning south-eastwards across Langfield Common. Todmorden Town Hall, which was presented to Todmorden by the Fielden family and opened in 1875, straddles the Walsden Water; thus, from 1875 to 1888 it was possible to dance in the town hall ballroom, forward and back, across two counties of England.

Following the Local Government Act 1894, the Todmorden Local Board became an Urban District Council, comprising the wards of Todmorden, Walsden, Langfield and Stansfield. At the same time, Todmorden Rural District Council, comprising the nearby parishes of Blackshaw, Erringden, Heptonstall and Wadsworth, came into being. Two years later, on 2 June 1896, the town was granted a Charter of Incorporation and the area covered by the Urban District Council became a municipal borough. The number of wards was increased from four to six: Central, Walsden, Langfield, Stansfield, Stoodley and Cornholme. Todmorden Rural District was later renamed Hepton Rural District. Since the local government reforms of 1974, Todmorden has been administered as part of the Metropolitan Borough of Calderdale, within the metropolitan county of West Yorkshire. At the local government level, the majority of the town is within Todmorden ward of Calderdale Council with the eastern part of the town, including Eastwood, sharing the adjoining Calder ward with the town of Hebden Bridge and parishes of Blackshaw, Heptonstall, Erringden and Wadsworth As of the 2023 Local Elections, the three Todmorden councillors and three Calder councillors are all part of the Labour Party.

Todmorden&#x27;s postal county was Lancashire until their abolition in 1996. 

===Todmorden Town Council composition===



Only Labour and the Liberal Democrats stood candidates in 2023. The turnout was 9740 and 132 ballots were rejected.

===Twin towns===
Todmorden&#x27;s twin towns are:
* Roncq, Nord, Hauts-de-France, France
* Bramsche, Lower Saxony, Germany

==Geography==
Other villages and towns in the Upper Calder Valley include Hebden Bridge and Mytholmroyd. The territory of the civil parish of Todmorden also extends to cover Eastwood, Walsden, Cornholme, Mankinholes, Lumbutts, Robinwood, Lydgate, Portsmouth, Shade, Stansfield, Dobroyd, Ferney Lee, Gauxholme and Cross Stone.

Medieval Todmorden had consisted of the townships of Langfield and Stansfield in Yorkshire, and Todmorden/Walsden section of the greater township of Hundersfield in the Ancient Parish of Rochdale, Lancashire. The township of Todmorden and Walsden was created in 1801 by the union of the older villages of Todmorden and Walsden.

==Economy==

Heavy industry is now part of Todmorden&#x27;s history, not its present. The industrial chimneys have largely gone and the remaining mills have mostly been converted for other purposes. The town&#x27;s industrial base is much reduced (at one time Todmorden had the largest weaving shed in the world). Todmorden also services the local rural area and attracts visitors through its market (indoor and outdoor), various events, heritage and the local Pennine countryside. It has for centuries been considered the safest accessible route directly across the Pennines.

===Nightlife===
Pubs in the town centre include the Duke of York, the Wellington, and the Pub. The Golden Lion is a renowned live music venue, with its own vinyl-only record label.

The White Hart Wetherspoons at Station Approach was offered for sale in September 2023 and ceased trading, after being sold, in March 2024.

==Landmarks==
Todmorden Town Hall, which was designed in the Neo-Classical style, dominates the centre of the town. The building straddles the Walsden Water, a tributary of the River Calder, and was situated in both Lancashire and Yorkshire until the administrative county boundary was moved on 1 January 1888. Designed by John Gibson of Westminster, this imposing building has a northern end which is semi-circular. One interesting external feature of the town hall is the pediment to the front elevation, which reflects the fact that it straddled the boundary as it depicts the main industries of the two counties. The fine carved stonework has two central female figures on a pedestal. The left-hand sculpture represents Lancashire (cotton spinning and weaving industries), and the right-hand one Yorkshire (wool manufacturing, engineering and agriculture).
Todmorden has the look of a Victorian mill town. Other notable buildings include Dobroyd Castle (completed in 1869), now used as a residential activity centre for schoolchildren; the Edwardian Hippodrome Theatre, and the Grade I listed Todmorden Unitarian Church (built 1865–1869). Dobroyd Castle, the town hall and the Unitarian church were all built at the behest of John Fielden and his sons and designed by John Gibson, who had been a member of Charles Barry&#x27;s team at the Houses of Parliament. Pre-Victorian buildings include two 18th century pubs; Todmorden Old Hall, a Grade II* listed manor house (Elizabethan) in the centre of town, and St. Mary&#x27;s Church which dates from 1476.

Todmorden is situated alongside the Pennine Way, Pennine Bridleway, Mary Towneley Loop and Calderdale Way and is popular for outdoor activities such as walking, fell running, mountain biking and bouldering. Its attractions include canals and locks, a park containing a sports centre, an outdoor skateboard park, tennis courts, a golf course and a cricket ground. There are wooded areas around the town and cafés and restaurants.
The Hippodrome Theatre shows films as well as putting on live performances. The town has a small toy and model museum, a library and a tourist information centre, along with independent retailers. Annual events include a carnival, agricultural show, beer festival, music festival and the traditional Easter Pace Egg plays.

Todmorden is home to many churches and chapels that serve the town and surrounding villages/hamlets. One notable church is the Grade I listed Todmorden Unitarian Church. Its spire is the tallest landmark in the town and surrounding area due to being on a hill. It continues to serve as a religious and civic centre. Other churches include the Central Methodist Church, St Joseph&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, Roomfield Baptist Church and St Mary&#x27;s Church. 

Centre Vale Park in Todmorden is the setting for several pieces of local art, including tree carvings by the sculptor John Adamson, and an iconic bandstand. The bandstand is unique in construction and is designed in an arc shape because this gives it better acoustics. It opened in 1914, and in July 2019 was condemned to be demolished by Calderdale Borough Council. A campaign by local activists resulted in the bandstand being granted grade II listed status by Historic England in January 2020, and in March 2022 funding was accepted by Calderdale Council for a project to improve Centre Vale Park, including the bandstand. Also in the park are the reconstructed remains of Centre Vale Mansion, next to Todmorden War Memorial in the Garden of Remembrance, and nearby there is a sculpture of a dog. This was sculpted by local sculptor David Wynne in 2005, and was cast in steel at the local Todmorden foundry Weir Minerals. It was donated to the park by the sculptor and the foundry, but installation was delayed for several years due to the extensive flood alleviation works. In 2011, the dog was featured on an episode of Derren Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Experiments&quot;. Brown spread a rumour that the dog was lucky; it then gained a reputation for bringing luck to anyone that touched it. During World War I the mansion was used as a military hospital. Centre Vale Park has hosted a parkrun since 9 March 2019.

The Stoodley Pike monument (built 1814 and rebuilt in 1854) stands atop the hill of the same name. It commemorates the defeat of Napoleon and the surrender of Paris. It is a prominent feature of Todmorden&#x27;s moors, and is a landmark on the Pennine Way.

==Media==
Todmorden has been used as a location for the 1980s BBC TV police drama &quot;Juliet Bravo&quot;, Territorial Army series &quot;All Quiet on the Preston Front&quot;, parts of &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot;, BBC TV miniseries &quot;Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit&quot;, the BBC1 series &quot;Life on Mars&quot;, a town in the book Spooks Blood and a film adaptation of the novel &quot;My Summer of Love&quot;. The BBC One crime drama series &quot;Happy Valley&quot;, written by Sally Wainwright (who grew up in nearby Sowerby Bridge), is filmed in and around the town, amongst other locations. In the 1980s, the town was used for two consecutive episodes of BBC fashion series The Clothes Show.

Todmorden featured in the ITV paranormal show &quot;Strange but True&quot; which in their pilot episode from May 1993 investigated the UFO claims in the Todmorden area. The programme included a closed surgery in which Harold Shipman worked for a number of years, as well as the town hall (haunted by a grey lady), and Oddfellows Hall (known as Baxter&#x27;s bar), which is haunted by a builder who died in the construction of the building in 1811.

Before May 2009, the links to Lancashire and the North West were also seen in the media with Todmorden receiving an analogue TV signal from BBC North West. The local television transmitter relayed BBC One and BBC Two to the Todmorden area, however ITV and Channel 4 was different and has always been relayed from Emley Moor (via Cornholme) which broadcasts ITV Yorkshire. Since 2009 the majority of services were relayed via Cornholme although some parts of Walsden retained their television signal from the North West.

In February 2010, Todmorden featured in the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Costing the Earth: The New Diggers&quot;. Members of a guerrilla gardening group spoke about reclaiming unused land for growing vegetables, how this helps the local community and how it can be a driver for change.

In November 2011, Todmorden featured in the Channel 4 programme &quot;The Secret of Luck&quot;, in which Derren Brown sought to convince the town that the dog statue in Centre Vale Park brought good luck.

In September 2010, Todmorden received a visit from then-Prince Charles (his second visit to the town) who came to support Mary Clear&#x27;s Incredible Edible project. This featured on BBC Yorkshire.

Todmorden&#x27;s local newspaper is the &quot;Todmorden News&quot; owned by Johnston Press, now merged (since October 2015) with the &quot;Hebden Bridge Times&quot; from the neighbouring town by the same publisher.

&quot;Singletrack&quot;, a national mountain biking magazine, is based in Todmorden.

<text>Tong (population 17,069 - 2001 UK census) is a ward within the City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council, West Yorkshire, England, named after Tong village which is its oldest settlement. The population at the 2011 Census was 20,608.

== Geography==
The ward is in the extreme south-east of Bradford District in a green wedge of land between the urban areas of Bradford and Leeds, the centre of the former being to the north-west and the centre of the latter being about to the north-east. Although surrounded by Green Belt, most of the settlements nearest to Tong are urban in character, Tong Street being to the west of the village, Drighlington to the south, Gildersome, to the south-east and New Farnley to the east (distances from the boundaries of the ward). The rural village of Bankhouse and the Moravian settlement of Fulneck in Pudsey are about to the north of Tong with Cockersdale to the south-east. East Bierley, immediately adjacent in the south, is part of Kirklees.

== History ==
The ward was formed from the former civil parish of Tong which in the 19th century included the settlements of Dudley Hill, Tong Street, Westgate Hill, and Holme.

The Tong political ward includes the urban areas of Dudley Hill, and the council estates of Bierley, West Yorkshire, Holme Wood and Sutton which is part of Tyersal. These settlements stretch along the main thoroughfare, Tong Street, which is part of the A650 road. To the west of the ward is Woodlands which is part of Oakenshaw and to the very east of the ward is Tong Village on Tong Lane. Tong Village is a small, rural village surrounded by farmers&#x27; fields, and home to a historic local cricket club, Tong CC.

Coal and ironstone were mined in the area in the 19th and the early 20th centuries, and several mines are recorded.

The ward was a former Labour stronghold but, in 2019, the Labour candidate tied with the Green Party candidate Matt Edwards. In 2021, Edwards became the first non-Labour Party councillor in the ward since it was created, with 47% of the vote. In 2022 and 2023 Labour lost both remaining councillors to the Green Party.

== Governance ==
;Councillors
Tong is represented on Bradford Council by three Green councillors; Matt Edwards, Celia Hickson and Ursula Sutcliffe 

 indicates seat up for re-election.

<doc id="152417" wikidata="Q186867" url="?curid=152417" title="Austrian People's Party">
<text>The Austrian People&#x27;s Party ( , ÖVP ) is a Christian-democratic and liberal-conservative political party in Austria.

Since January 2025, the party has been led by Christian Stocker (as an acting leader). It is currently the second-largest party in the National Council, with 51 of the 183 seats, and won 26.3% of votes cast in the 2024 legislative election. It holds seats in all nine state legislatures, and is part of government in seven, of which it leads six. The ÖVP is a member of the International Democracy Union and the European People&#x27;s Party. It sits with the EPP group in the European Parliament; of Austria&#x27;s 19 MEPs, 5 are members of the ÖVP. It is the second largest party in Europe by membership.

An unofficial successor to the Christian Social Party of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the ÖVP was founded immediately following the re-establishment of the Republic of Austria in 1945. Since then, it has been one of the two traditional major parties in Austria, alongside the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ). It was the most popular party until 1970, and has traditionally governed in a grand coalition with the SPÖ. It was the senior partner in grand coalitions from 1945 to 1966 and the junior partner from 1986 to 2000 and 2007–2017. The ÖVP also briefly governed alone from 1966 to 1970. After the 1999 election, the party formed a coalition with the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) until 2003, when a coalition with the FPÖ splinter Alliance for the Future of Austria was formed, which lasted until 2007.

== History ==
The ÖVP is the successor of the Christian Social Party, a staunchly conservative movement founded in 1893 by Karl Lueger, mayor of Vienna and highly controversial right-wing populist. Most of the members of the party during its founding belonged to the former Fatherland Front, which was led by chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss, also a member of the Christian Social Party before the Anschluss. While still sometimes honored by ÖVP members for resisting Adolf Hitler, the regime built by Dollfuss was authoritarian in nature and has been dubbed as Austrofascism. In its present form, the ÖVP was established immediately after the restoration of Austria&#x27;s independence in 1945 and it has been represented in both the Federal Assembly ever since. In terms of Federal Assembly seats, the ÖVP has consistently been the strongest or second-strongest party and as such it has led or at least been a partner in most Austria&#x27;s federal cabinets.

In the 1945 Austrian legislative election, the ÖVP won a landslide victory in Austria&#x27;s first postwar election, winning almost half the popular vote and an absolute majority in the legislature. However, memories of the hyper-partisanship that had plagued the First Republic prompted the ÖVP to maintain the grand coalition with the Communist Party of Austria (KPÖ) and the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) that had governed the country since the restoration of independence in early 1945. The ÖVP remained the senior partner in a coalition with the SPÖ until 1966 and governed alone from 1966 to 1970. It reentered the government in 1986, but has never been completely out of power since the restoration of Austrian independence in 1945 due to a longstanding tradition that all major interest groups were to be consulted on policy.

After the 1999 Austrian legislative election, several months of negotiations ended in early 2000 when the ÖVP formed a coalition government with the right-wing populist Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) led by Jörg Haider. The FPÖ had won just a few hundred more votes than the ÖVP, but was considered far too controversial to lead a government. The ÖVP&#x27;s Wolfgang Schüssel became Chancellor—the first ÖVP Chancellor of Austria since 1970. This caused widespread outrage in Europe and the European Union imposed informal diplomatic sanctions on Austria, the first time that it imposed sanctions on a member state. Bilateral relations were frozen (including contacts and meetings at an inter-governmental level) and Austrian candidates would not be supported for posts in European Union international offices. Austria threatened to veto all applications by countries for European Union membership until the sanctions were lifted. A few months later, these sanctions were dropped as a result of a fact-finding mission by three former European prime ministers, the so-called &quot;three wise men&quot;. The 2002 legislative election resulted in a landslide victory (42.27% of the vote) for the ÖVP under Schüssel. Haider&#x27;s FPÖ was reduced to 10.16% of the vote. At the state level, the ÖVP has long dominated the rural states of Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Salzburg, Styria, Tyrol and Vorarlberg. It is less popular in the city-state of Vienna and in the rural, but less strongly Catholic states of Burgenland and Carinthia. In 2004, it lost its plurality in the State of Salzburg, where they kept its result in seats (14) in 2009. In 2005, it lost its plurality in Styria for the first time.

After the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ) split from the FPÖ in 2005, the BZÖ replaced the FPÖ in the government coalition which lasted until 2007. Austria for the first time had a government containing a party that was founded during the parliamentary term. In the 2006 Austrian legislative election, the ÖVP were defeated and after much negotiations agreed to become junior partner in a grand coalition with the SPÖ, with new party chairman Wilhelm Molterer as Finance Minister and Vice-Chancellor under SPÖ leader Alfred Gusenbauer, who became Chancellor. The 2008 Austrian legislative election saw the ÖVP lose 15 seats, with a further 8.35% decrease in its share of the vote. However, the ÖVP won the largest share of the vote (30.0%) in the 2009 European Parliament election with 846,709 votes, although their number of seats remained the same.

The ÖVP had minor losses in the 2013 Austrian legislative election, and the grand coalition with the SPÖ continued until the 2017 Austrian legislative election, when the ÖVP changed its colour to turquoise and won its first legislative election since 2002. The party underwent a change in its image after Sebastian Kurz became chairman, changing its colour from the traditional black to turquoise, and adopting the alternate name The New People&#x27;s Party (). It became the largest party after the 2017 election, and formed a coalition government with the FPÖ. This collapsed eighteen months later due to the Ibiza affair, leading to the 2019 election, after which the ÖVP formed a new coalition with The Greens.

An investigation into the Ibiza affair by a parliamentary subcommittee, an unstable Cabinet plagued by resignations, and ultimately a corruption inquiry, forced Kurz to resign the chancellorship in October 2021. Kurz was replaced by Karl Nehammer in 2021 as party leader and Chancellor. In the 2024 Austrian legislative election, the party fell to second behind the FPÖ. Following the surge of the FPÖ in various polls throughout late 2024 and early 2025, as well as the collapse of the ÖVP-SPÖ-NEOS coalition talks, Nehammer resigned as party leader and was replaced with Christian Stocker as acting leader.

== Ideology and platform ==
The ÖVP is described as Christian-democratic, conservative, and liberal-conservative. The party has also been described as a catch-all party of the centre-right, in the vein of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany. For most of its existence, the ÖVP has explicitly defined itself as Catholic and anti-socialist, with the ideals of subsidiarity as defined by the encyclical &quot;Quadragesimo anno&quot; and decentralisation.

For the first election after World War II, the ÖVP presented itself as the Austrian Party (), was anti-Marxist and regarded itself as the Party of the center (). The ÖVP consistently held power—either alone or in so-called black–red coalition with the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ)—until 1970, when the SPÖ formed a minority government with the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ). The ÖVP&#x27;s economic policies during the era generally upheld a social market economy.

The party&#x27;s campaign for the 2017 legislative election under the party chairman Sebastian Kurz was dominated by a rightward shift in policy which included a promised crackdown on illegal immigration and a fight against political Islam, making it more similar to the program of the FPÖ, the party that Kurz chose as his coalition partner after the ÖVP won the election. The party underwent a change in its image after Kurz became chairman, changing its colour from the traditional black to turquoise, and adopting the name The new People&#x27;s Party ().

<text>A passphrase is a sequence of words or other text used to control access to a computer system, program or data. It is similar to a password in usage, but a passphrase is generally longer for added security. Passphrases are often used to control both access to, and the operation of, cryptographic programs and systems, especially those that derive an encryption key from a passphrase. The origin of the term is by analogy with &quot;password&quot;. The modern concept of passphrases is believed to have been invented by Sigmund N. Porter in 1982.

==Security==
Considering that the entropy of written English is less than 1.1 bits per character, passphrases can be relatively weak. NIST has estimated that the 23-character passphrase &quot;IamtheCapitanofthePina4&quot; contains a 45-bit strength. The equation employed here is:

: 4 bits (1st character) + 14 bits (characters 2–8) + 18 bits (characters 9–20) + 3 bits (characters 21–23) + 6 bits (bonus for upper case, lower case, and alphanumeric) = 45 bits

(This calculation does not take into account that this is a well-known quote from the operetta H.M.S. Pinafore. An MD5 hash of this passphrase can be cracked in 4 seconds using crackstation.net, indicating that the phrase is found in password cracking databases.)

Using this guideline, to achieve the 80-bit strength recommended for high security (non-military) by NIST, a passphrase would need to be 58 characters long, assuming a composition that includes uppercase and alphanumeric.

There is room for debate regarding the applicability of this equation, depending on the number of bits of entropy assigned. For example, the characters in five-letter words each contain 2.3 bits of entropy, which would mean only a 35-character passphrase is necessary to achieve 80 bit strength.

If the words or components of a passphrase may be found in a language dictionary—especially one available as electronic input to a software program—the passphrase is rendered more vulnerable to dictionary attack. This is a particular issue if the entire phrase can be found in a book of quotations or phrase compilations. However, the required effort (in time and cost) can be made impracticably high if there are enough words in the passphrase and if they are randomly chosen and ordered in the passphrase. The number of combinations which would have to be tested under sufficient conditions make a dictionary attack so difficult as to be infeasible. These are difficult conditions to meet, and selecting at least one word that cannot be found in &quot;any&quot; dictionary significantly increases passphrase strength.

If passphrases are chosen by humans, they are usually biased by the frequency of particular words in natural language. In the case of four word phrases, actual entropy rarely exceeds 30 bits. On the other hand, user-selected pass&quot;words&quot; tend to be much weaker than that, and encouraging users to use even 2-word passphrases may be able to raise entropy from below 10 bits to over 20 bits.

For example, the widely used cryptography standard OpenPGP requires that a user make up a passphrase that must be entered whenever decrypting or signing messages. Internet services like Hushmail provide free encrypted e-mail or file sharing services, but the security present depends almost entirely on the quality of the chosen passphrase.

==Compared to passwords==
Passphrases differ from passwords. A password is usually short—six to ten characters. Such passwords may be adequate for various applications if frequently changed, chosen using an appropriate policy, not found in dictionaries, sufficiently random, and/or if the system prevents online guessing, etc., such as:
* Logging onto computer systems
* Negotiating keys in an interactive setting such as using password-authenticated key agreement
* Enabling a smart-card or PIN for an ATM card where the password data (hopefully) cannot be extracted

But passwords are typically not safe to use as keys for standalone security systems such as encryption systems that expose data to enable offline password guessing by an attacker. Passphrases are theoretically stronger, and so should make a better choice in these cases. First, they usually are and always should be much longer—20 to 30 characters or more is typical—making some kinds of brute force attacks entirely impractical. Second, if well chosen, they will not be found in any phrase or quote dictionary, so such dictionary attacks will be almost impossible. Third, they can be structured to be more easily memorable than passwords without being written down, reducing the risk of hardcopy theft. However, if a passphrase is not protected appropriately by the authenticator and the clear-text passphrase is revealed its use is no better than other passwords. For this reason it is recommended that passphrases not be reused across different or unique sites and services.

In 2012, two Cambridge University researchers analyzed passphrases from the Amazon PayPhrase system and found that a significant percentage are easy to guess due to common cultural references such as movie names and sports teams, losing much of the potential of using long passwords.

When used in cryptography, commonly the passphrase protects a long machine generated key, and the key protects the data. The key is so long a brute force attack directly on the data is impossible. A key derivation function is used, involving many thousands of iterations (salted &amp; hashed), to slow down password cracking attacks.

==Passphrases selection==

Typical advice about choosing a passphrase includes suggestions that it should be:
* Long enough to be hard to guess
* Not a famous quotation from literature, holy books, et cetera
* Hard to guess by intuition—even by someone who knows the user well
* Easy to remember and type accurately
* For better security, any easily memorable encoding at the user&#x27;s own level can be applied.
* Not reused between sites, applications and other different sources

==Example methods==

One method to create a strong passphrase is to use dice to select words at random from a long list, a technique often referred to as diceware. While such a collection of words might appear to violate the &quot;not from any dictionary&quot; rule, the security is based entirely on the large number of possible ways to choose from the list of words and not from any secrecy about the words themselves. For example, if there are 7776 words in the list and six words are chosen randomly, then there are &quot;7,7766 = 221,073,919,720,733,357,899,776&quot; combinations, providing about 78 bits of entropy. (The number &quot;7776&quot; was chosen to allow words to be selected by throwing five dice. &quot;7776 = 65&quot;) Random word sequences may then be memorized using techniques such as the memory palace.

Another is to choose two phrases, turn one into an acronym, and include it in the second, making the final passphrase. For instance, using two English language typing exercises, we have the following. &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&quot;, becomes &quot;tqbfjotld&quot;. Including it in, &quot;Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country&quot;, might produce, &quot;Now is the time for all good tqbfjotld to come to the aid of their country&quot; as the passphrase.

There are several points to note here, all relating to why this example passphrase is not a good one.
* It has appeared in public and so should be avoided by everyone.
* It is long (which is a considerable virtue in theory) and requires a good typist as typing errors are much more likely for extended phrases.
* Individuals and organizations serious about cracking computer security have compiled lists of passwords derived in this manner from the most common quotations, song lyrics, and so on.

The PGP Passphrase FAQ suggests a procedure that attempts a better balance between theoretical security and practicality than this example. All procedures for picking a passphrase involve a tradeoff between security and ease of use; security should be at least &quot;adequate&quot; while not &quot;too seriously&quot; annoying users. Both criteria should be evaluated to match particular situations.

Another supplementary approach to frustrating brute-force attacks is to derive the key from the passphrase using a deliberately slow hash function, such as PBKDF2 as described in RFC 2898.

==Windows support==
If backward compatibility with Microsoft LAN Manager is not needed, in versions of Windows NT (including Windows 2000, Windows XP and later), a passphrase can be used as a substitute for a Windows password. If the passphrase is longer than 14 characters, this will also avoid the generation of a &quot;very&quot; weak LM hash.

==Unix support==
In recent versions of Unix-like operating systems such as Linux, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris and FreeBSD, up to 255-character passphrases can be used.

<text>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is a Eurasian political, economic, international security and defence organization established by China and Russia in 2001. It is the world&#x27;s largest regional organization in terms of geographic scope and population, covering approximately 24% of the area of world (65% of Eurasia) and 42% of the world population. As of 2024, its combined nominal GDP accounts for around 23%, while its GDP based on PPP comprises approximately 36% of the world&#x27;s total.

The SCO is the successor to the Shanghai Five, formed in 1996 between the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan. In June 2001, the leaders of these nations and Uzbekistan met in Shanghai to announce a new organization with deeper political and economic cooperation. In June 2017, it expanded to eight states, with India and Pakistan. Iran joined the group in July 2023, and Belarus in July 2024. Several countries are engaged as observers or dialogue partners. 

The SCO is governed by the Heads of State Council (HSC), its supreme decision-making body, which meets once a year. The organization also contains the Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS).

=== The Shanghai Five ===
The Shanghai Five group was created on 26 April 1996 when the heads of states of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan signed the Treaty on Deepening Military Trust in Border Regions in Shanghai.

On 24 April 1997 the same countries signed the Treaty on Reduction of Military Forces in Border Regions in a meeting in Moscow, Russia. On 20 May 1997 Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Chinese President Jiang Zemin signed a declaration on a &quot;multipolar world&quot;.

Subsequent annual summits of the Shanghai Five group occurred in Almaty, Kazakhstan in 1998, in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan in 1999, and in Dushanbe, Tajikistan in 2000. At the Dushanbe summit, members agreed to &quot;oppose intervention in other countries&#x27; internal affairs on the reason of &#x27;humanitarianism&#x27; and &#x27;protecting human rights;&#x27; and support the efforts of one another in safeguarding the five countries&#x27; national independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and social stability.&quot; The Shanghai Five structure helped speed up the members&#x27; resolution of border disputes, agree on military deployments in border areas, and address security threats.

=== Developing institutional forms ===

In 2001, the annual summit returned to Shanghai and the group was institutionalized. The five member nations first admitted Uzbekistan in the Shanghai Five mechanism. On 15 June 2001, all six heads of state signed the &quot;Declaration of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation&quot;, praising the role played thus far by the Shanghai Five mechanism and aiming to transform it to a higher level of cooperation. From 2001 to 2008, the SCO developed rapidly, establishing a number of permanent bodies and &quot;ad hoc&quot; initiatives dealing with economic and security matters.

In June 2002, the heads of the SCO member states met in Saint Petersburg, Russia and signed the &quot;SCO Charter&quot; which expounded on the organisation&#x27;s purposes, principles, structures and forms of operation. It entered into force on 19 September 2003.

In July 2005, at the summit in Astana, Kazakhstan, with representatives of India, Iran, Mongolia and Pakistan attending an SCO summit for the first time, Nursultan Nazarbayev, the president of the Kazakhstan, greeted the guests in words that had never been used before in any context: &quot;The leaders of the states sitting at this negotiation table are representatives of half of humanity&quot;.

By 2007, the SCO had initiated over twenty large-scale projects related to transportation, energy and telecommunications and held regular meetings of security, military, defence, foreign affairs, economic, cultural, banking, and other officials from its member states.

In July 2015, in Ufa, Russia, the SCO decided to admit India and Pakistan as full members. In June 2016 in Tashkent, both signed the memorandum of obligations, thereby starting the process of joining the SCO. In June 2017, at a summit in Kazakhstan, India and Pakistan officially joined SCO as full members.

In 2004, the SCO established relations with the United Nations (where it is an observer in the General Assembly), the Commonwealth of Independent States in 2005, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2005, the Collective Security Treaty Organization in 2007, the Economic Cooperation Organization in 2007, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in 2011, the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA) in 2014, and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) in 2015. in 2018, SCO Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) has established relations with the African Union&#x27;s African Centre for the Study and Research on Terrorism (ACSRT).

== Organisational structure ==
As of 2020, the Council of Heads of State was the top decision-making body in the SCO, meeting at the annual SCO summits in one of the member states&#x27; capital cities. Because of their government structure, the prime ministers of the parliamentary democracies of India and Pakistan attend the SCO Council of Heads of State summits, as their responsibilities are similar to the presidents of other SCO nations.

As of the 4 July 2024 meeting, the Council of Heads of State consists of:
* Aleksandr Lukashenko  (Belarus)
* Xi Jinping (China)
* Narendra Modi (India)
*  Masoud Pezeshkian  (Iran)
* Kassym-Jomart Tokayev (Kazakhstan)
* Sadyr Japarov (Kyrgyzstan)
* Shehbaz Sharif (Pakistan)
* Vladimir Putin (Russia)
* Emomali Rahmon (Tajikistan)
* Shavkat Mirziyoyev (Uzbekistan)

The Council of Heads of Government is the second-highest council in the organisation. This council also holds annual summits, at which time members discuss issues of multilateral cooperation and approves the organisation&#x27;s budget. As of the 1 November 2022 meeting, Council of Heads of Government consists of:
* Li Qiang (China)
* Narendra Modi (India) (usually sends a deputy, such as EAM Subrahmanyam Jaishankar at the 2021 summit)
* Alihan Smaiylov (Kazakhstan)
* Akylbek Japarov (Kyrgyzstan)
* Shehbaz Sharif (Pakistan) (usually sends a deputy, such as Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs Andleeb Abbas at the 2020 summit)
* Mikhail Mishustin (Russia)
* Qohir Rasulzoda (Tajikistan)
* Abdulla Aripov (Uzbekistan)

As of 2007, the Council of Foreign Ministers also held regular meetings, where they discussed the current international situation and interaction with other international organisations. As of 2021, the Council of National Coordinators coordinated the multilateral cooperation of member states within the framework of the SCO&#x27;s charter.

The Secretariat of the SCO, headquartered in Beijing, China, is the primary executive body of the organisation. It serves to implement organisational decisions and decrees, drafts proposed documents (such as declarations and agendas), function as a document depository for the organisation, arranges specific activities within the SCO framework, and promotes and disseminates information about the SCO. The SCO Secretary-General is elected to a three-year term. Zhang Ming of China became the current Secretary-General on 1 January 2022.

The Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) Executive Committee, headquartered in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, is a permanent organ of the SCO which serves to promote cooperation of member states against the three evils of terrorism, separatism and extremism. The Director of SCO RATS Executive Committee is elected to a three-year term. Ruslan Mirzaev of Uzbekistan became the current Director on 1 January 2022. Each member state also sends a permanent representative to RATS.

The official languages of the SCO are Chinese and Russian.

* 
* 

Turkmenistan has previously declared itself a permanently neutral country, which was recognized by a resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1995, thus ostensibly precluding its membership in the SCO. At the same time, Turkmenistan is a member of the Economic Cooperation Organization since 1992 and an observer of the Organization of Turkic States since 2021. Turkmenistan&#x27;s head of state has been attending SCO summits since 2007 as a guest attendee.

=== Future membership possibilities ===
In 2010, the SCO approved a procedure for admitting new members. In 2011, Turkey applied for dialogue partner status, which it obtained in 2013. At the same time, Turkey is a NATO member and the European Union candidate country. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has stated that he has discussed the possibility of abandoning Turkey&#x27;s candidacy of accession to the European Union in return for full membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. This was reinforced again on 21 November 2016, after the European Parliament voted unanimously to suspend accession negotiations with Turkey. Two days later, on 23 November 2016, Turkey was granted the chairmanship of SCO energy club for the 2017 period. That made Turkey the first country to chair a club in the organisation without full membership status. In 2022, at the 22nd summit of the SCO, the Turkish president said that Turkey would seek full SCO membership status. On 11 July 2024, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stated in a statement to the U.S. Newsweek magazine that they did not consider Turkey&#x27;s membership in NATO as an alternative to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and BRICS.

In 2011, Vietnam expressed interest in obtaining observer status (but has not applied for it).

In 2012, Ukraine expressed interest in obtaining observer status. However, since the deposition of President Viktor Yanukovych and increased tensions with Russia, no application has been submitted and there are no current plans to incorporate Ukraine into the organization.

Azerbaijan expects to receive observer status according to Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry spokesperson Aykhan Hajizada. Azerbaijan will probably become a full member of the SCO in a little while, President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said during his meeting with President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev on 3 July 2024 in Astana.

== Activities ==
===Cooperation on security===
As of 2023, the SCO is primarily centered on security-related concerns, describing the main threats it confronts as being terrorism, separatism and extremism. It has addressed regional human trafficking and weapons trafficking and created terrorist blacklists.

At SCO summit, held in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, on 16–17 June 2004, the Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) was established. On 21 April 2006, the SCO announced plans to fight cross-border drug crimes under the counter-terrorism rubric.

In October 2007, the SCO signed an agreement with the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe, to broaden cooperation on issues such as security, crime, and drug trafficking.

As of 2010, the organisation was opposing cyberwarfare, saying that the dissemination of information &quot;harmful to the spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other states&quot; should be considered a &quot;security threat&quot;. An accord adopted in 2009 defined &quot;information war&quot;, in part, as an effort by a state to undermine another&#x27;s &quot;political, economic, and social systems&quot;. &quot;The Diplomat&quot; reported in 2017 that SCO has foiled 600 terror plots and extradited 500 terrorists through RATS. The 36th meeting of the Council of the RATS decided to hold a joint anti-terror exercise, Pabbi-Antiterror-2021, in Pakistan in 2021.

At the summit in Astana, Kazakhstan, in July 2024, the SCO called for the creation of a fair, multipolar world order based on the key role of the United Nations, international law and the aspiration of sovereign states towards a mutually beneficial partnership. 

===Military activities===
As of 2009, the organisation&#x27;s activities expanded to include increased military cooperation, intelligence sharing, and counterterrorism. At the same time, leaders of SCO states repeatedly stated that the SCO was not a military alliance.

As of 2023, the SCO had not provided military support in any actual conflicts. However, as of 2017, military exercises have regularly been conducted among members to promote cooperation and coordination against terrorism and other external threats, and to maintain regional peace and stability. There have been a number of SCO joint military exercises. The first of these was held in 2003, with the first phase taking place in Kazakhstan and the second in China. Since then China and Russia have teamed up for large-scale war games in Peace Mission 2005, Peace Mission 2007 and Peace Mission 2009, under the auspices of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. More than 4,000 soldiers participated at the joint military exercises in Peace Mission 2007, which took place in Chelyabinsk, Russia near the Ural Mountains, as was agreed upon in April 2006 at a meeting of SCO Defence Ministers. In 2010, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov said that the exercises would be transparent and open to media and the public. Following the war games&#x27; successful completion, Russian officials began speaking of India joining such exercises in the future and the SCO taking on a military role. Peace Mission 2010, conducted 9–25 September at Kazakhstan&#x27;s Matybulak training area, saw over 5,000 personnel from China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan conduct joint planning and operational maneuvers.

The SCO has served as a platform for larger military announcements by members. During the 2007 war games in Russia, with leaders of SCO member states in attendance including Chinese President Hu Jintao, Russia&#x27;s President Vladimir Putin used the occasion to take advantage of a captive audience. Russian strategic bombers, he said, would resume regular long-range patrols for the first time since the Cold War. &quot;Starting today, such tours of duty will be conducted regularly and on the strategic scale&quot;, Putin said. &quot;Our pilots have been grounded for too long. They are happy to start a new life&quot;.

In June 2014, in the Tajik capital Dushanbe, the idea was brought up to merge the SCO with the Collective Security Treaty Organization. However, as of late 2022, in the wake of Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, many SCO and even CSTO members had distanced themselves from military cooperation with Russia.

===Economic cooperation===
In September 2003, a Framework Agreement to enhance economic cooperation was signed by the SCO member states. At the same meeting the Premier of China, Wen Jiabao, proposed a long-term objective to establish a free trade area in the SCO, while other more immediate measures would be taken to improve the flow of goods in the region. A follow-up plan with 100 specific actions was signed one year later, on 23 September 2004.

In October 2005, during the Moscow Summit of the SCO, the Secretary General of the Organisation said that the SCO would prioritise joint energy projects; including in the oil and gas sector, the exploration of new hydrocarbon reserves, and joint use of water resources. The creation of the SCO Interbank Consortium was also agreed upon in order to fund future joint projects. In February 2006, the first meeting of the SCO Interbank Association was held in Beijing. In November 2006, at &quot;The SCO: Results and Perspectives&quot;, an international conference held in Almaty, the representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry announced that Russia was developing plans for an SCO &quot;Energy Club&quot;. in November 2007, Moscow reiterated the need for this &quot;energy club&quot; at an SCO summit. Other SCO members, however, did not commit themselves to the idea. During the 2008 summit it was stated that &quot;Against the backdrop of a slowdown in the growth of world economy pursuing a responsible currency and financial policy, control over the capital flowing, ensuring food and energy security have been gaining special significance&quot;.

At the 2007 SCO summit, Iranian Vice President Parviz Davoodi addressed an initiative that had been garnering greater interest when he said, &quot;The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation is a good venue for designing a new banking system which is independent from international banking systems&quot;.

President Putin included these comments:

We now clearly see the defectiveness of the monopoly in world finance and the policy of economic selfishness. To solve the current problem Russia will take part in changing the global financial structure so that it will be able to guarantee stability and prosperity in the world and to ensure progress.

The world is seeing the emergence of a qualitatively different geo-political situation, with the emergence of new centers of economic growth and political influence.

We will witness and take part in the transformation of the global and regional security and development architectures adapted to new realities of the 21st century, when stability and prosperity are becoming inseparable notions.


In June 2009, at the Yekaterinburg Summit, China announced plans to provide a US$10 billion loan to other SCO member states to shore up the struggling economies of its members amid the global financial crisis. The summit was held together with the first BRIC summit, and the China–Russia joint statement said that they want a bigger quota in the International Monetary Fund.

In 2014, the Eurasian Economic Union was founded in which Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are members.

During the 2019 Bishkek summit, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan suggested taking steps to trade in local currencies instead of U.S. dollars and setting up financial institutions including an SCO bank.

In June 2022, Iran&#x27;s Deputy Foreign Minister for Economic Diplomacy Mehdi Safari suggested creating a single SCO currency to facilitate trade and financial transactions among SCO members.

During 19–22 October 2022, Iran hosted SCOCOEX, an international conference and exhibition on economic cooperation opportunities available to the SCO member states and partners.

As part of the SCO&#x27;s economic agenda, it has established a relatively successful student exchange program called the SCO University.

=== Cultural cooperation ===
Culture ministers of the SCO met for the first time in Beijing on 12 April 2002, signing a joint statement for continued cooperation. The third meeting of the Culture Ministers took place in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, on 27–28 April 2006.

An SCO Arts Festival and Exhibition was held for the first time during the Astana Summit in 2005. Kazakhstan suggested an SCO folk dance festival to take place in 2008, in Astana.

===SCO+===
The SCO+ forum format was initiated by the United Russia party in October 2020. This format includes inter-party interaction not only of the countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (members, observers, candidates) but also of the CIS and BRICS countries.

It was first used during the SCO+ international inter-party forum &quot;Economy for People&quot; on 22–23 October 2020. The forum was attended by speakers from 25 countries, including the chairman of the United Russia party, Dmitry Medvedev, ministers of the SCO countries, Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić, and ambassadors and diplomats of the CIS and BRICS countries. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent greetings to the forum participants.

==Summits==
According to the Charter of the SCO, summits of the Council of Heads of State shall be held annually at alternating venues. The locations of these summits follow the alphabetical order of the member state&#x27;s name in Russian. The charter also dictates that the Council of Heads of Government (that is, the Prime Ministers) shall meet annually in a place decided upon by the council members. The Council of Foreign Ministers is supposed to hold a summit one month before the annual summit of Heads of State. Extraordinary meetings of the Council of Foreign Ministers can be called by any two member states.

==Analysis==
===Relations with the West===

The United States applied for observer status in the SCO, but was rejected in 2005.

At the Astana summit in July 2005, with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq foreshadowing an indefinite presence of U.S. forces in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, the SCO requested the U.S. to set a clear timetable for withdrawing its troops from SCO member states. Shortly afterwards, Uzbekistan requested the U.S. leave the K2 air base.

A report in 2007 noted that the SCO has made no direct comments against the U.S. or its military presence in the region; however, some indirect statements at the past summits have been viewed by Western media outlets as &quot;thinly veiled swipes at Washington&quot;.

From 2001 to 2008, the Western reaction to the SCO was generally skepticism of the organization&#x27;s goals. By the 2010s, however, the West increasingly began to view the SCO as a potential contributor to stability in the region, particularly with regards to Afghanistan.

In September 2023, the United Nations approved United Nations resolution A/77/L.107, titled &quot;Cooperation between the United Nations and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.&quot; The result of the vote was 80 in favour to 2 against with 47 abstentions. The United States and Israel were the only countries to vote against the resolution.

Although the European Council on Foreign Relations dubbed the SCO an &quot;anti NATO alliance&quot; in 2022, apparent inconsistencies among its member states have prevented it from becoming an effective geopolitical alliance. As of July 2023, India and Central Asian countries maintained friendly cooperation with both the West and Russia, India has had fierce conflicts with Pakistan and its ally China at the same time, which has been limiting the possibility of China and Russia forming the group into an anti-Western bloc. Academics Simon Curtis and Ian Klaus write that although SCO has sometimes been compared to NATO, unlike NATO, SCO does not create a collective security alliance.

===Geopolitical aspects===

At a 2005 summit in Kazakhstan the SCO issued a Declaration of Heads of Member States of the SCO which said: &quot;The heads of the member states point out that, against the backdrop of a contradictory process of globalisation, multilateral cooperation, which is based on the principles of equal right and mutual respect, non-intervention in internal affairs of sovereign states, non-confrontational way of thinking and consecutive movement towards democratisation of international relations, contributes to overall peace and security, and call upon the international community, irrespective of its differences in ideology and social structure, to form a new concept of security based on mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality and interaction.&quot;

In November 2005 Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reiterated that the &quot;Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is working to establish a rational and just world order&quot; and that &quot;The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation provides us with a unique opportunity to take part in the process of forming a fundamentally new model of geopolitical integration&quot;.

In 2007, Matthew Brummer tracked the implications of SCO expansion into the Persian Gulf. In 2008, one aim of SCO was to ensure that liberal democracy could not gain ground in these countries, according to political scientist Thomas Ambrosio. In 2016, political scientist Thomas Fingar wrote that China took the lead in establishing the Shanghai Five primarily to limit Russia&#x27;s ability to reassert its influence in Central Asia.

During the 2008 Russo-Georgian war, China opposed Russia&#x27;s infringement on Georgia&#x27;s sovereignty. Citing principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and global order, China used its influence in the SCO to prevent the organization from supporting Russia.

In 2008, Iranian writer Hamid Golpira had this to say on the topic: &quot;According to Zbigniew Brzezinski&#x27;s theory, control of the Eurasian landmass is the key to global domination and control of Central Asia is the key to control of the Eurasian landmass...Russia and China have been paying attention to Brzezinski&#x27;s theory, since they formed the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in 2001, ostensibly to curb extremism in the region and enhance border security, but most probably with the real objective of counterbalancing the activities of the United States and the rest of the NATO alliance in Central Asia&quot;.

In 2008, the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; wrote: &quot;The Declaration points out that the SCO member countries have the ability and responsibility to safeguard the security of the Central Asian region, and calls on Western countries to leave Central Asia. That is the most noticeable signal given by the Summit to the world&quot;.

In January 2023, India as SCO chair, invited Pakistan&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Minister and Chief justice to attend a meeting in Goa in May 2023. As of May 2023, India and Pakistan continued to spar over terrorism, while Central Asian members Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have erupted in armed conflict over border disputes. The SCO was not a platform for resolving bilateral issues, and its members were also reluctant to mediate disputes multilaterally. Due to the widely divergent agendas among member states, Indian commentators even called it the &quot;Shanghai Contradiction Organisation&quot;.

Members of the SCO remained neutral in the Russo-Ukrainian war, they also strengthened cooperation with the Russian Federation. Analysis in 2024 points out that the SCO has generally facilitated amicable China-Russia relations.

=== Other analysis ===
A 2015 European Parliamentary Research Service paper concludes, &quot;The SCO&#x27;s main achievement thus far is to have offered its members a cooperative forum to balance their conflicting interests and to ease bilateral tensions. It has built up joint capabilities and has agreed on common approaches in the fight against terrorism, separatism and extremism. However, major shortcomings, such as institutional weaknesses, a lack of common financial funds for the implementation of joint projects and conflicting national interests have prevented the SCO from achieving a higher level of regional cooperation in other areas.&quot;

In perspective with issues with internal conflict and lack of cohesion only exacerbate how ineffective the SCO would be for China globally.

<text>Styx () is an American rock band formed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1972. They are known for blending melodic hard rock guitar with acoustic guitar, synthesizers mixed with acoustic piano, upbeat tracks with power ballads, and incorporating elements of international musical theatre. The band established themselves with a progressive rock sound during the 1970s, and began to incorporate pop rock and soft rock elements in the 1980s. 

The original line-up comprised Dennis DeYoung, James &quot;J.Y.&quot; Young, John &quot;J.C.&quot; Curulewski and brothers Chuck and John Panozzo. Debuting with &quot;Styx&quot; in 1972, the band usually released an album every year throughout the 1970s. &quot;Styx II&quot; (1973) had the sleeper hit &quot;Lady&quot;, a power ballad, which reached No. 6 in the US, helping the album make the top 20. &quot;Lady&quot; was also a top 20 hit in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. &quot;Equinox&quot; (1975) and &quot;Crystal Ball&quot; (1976) reached the US top 70 with &quot;Equinox&quot; featuring &quot;Lorelei&quot;, a No. 6 hit in Canada. &quot;Crystal Ball&quot; was the first album with Tommy Shaw, who replaced Curulewski in late 1975.

Styx&#x27;s commercial breakthrough in Northern Europe came with &quot;The Grand Illusion&quot; (1977), which peaked at No. 6 in both the US and Canada, and became the first of four straight multi-platinum albums in the US for Styx. It featured the single &quot;Come Sail Away&quot;, a top 10 hit in both countries. The band&#x27;s follow-up, &quot;Pieces of Eight&quot; (1978), was another No. 6 hit in the US, but peaked higher in Canada due to the top 10 hits &quot;Renegade&quot; and &quot;Blue Collar Man (Long Nights)&quot;. In 1979, Styx&#x27;s &quot;Cornerstone&quot; went to No. 2 in both countries on the strength of the cross-border No. 1 hit ballad &quot;Babe&quot;. The album became their breakthrough album in Australia and New Zealand, with &quot;Babe&quot; peaking at No. 3. &quot;Babe&quot; was a No. 6 hit in the UK, and &quot;Cornerstone&quot; charted at No. 36.

In 1981, Styx&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Theatre&quot; was a No. 1 album in the US and Canada, while also reaching the top 10 in Scandinavia and the UK (their biggest album there) and the top 30 in Australia and New Zealand. &quot;The Best of Times&quot; from the album reached No. 1 in Canada, No. 3 in the US, and the top 30 in several other countries, while &quot;Too Much Time on My Hands&quot; was also a top 10 hit in North America. &quot;Kilroy Was Here&quot; (1983) was Styx&#x27;s last major hit album, reaching the top 3 in North America and the top 10 in Scandinavia, although it was less successful elsewhere. Its lead single, &quot;Mr. Roboto&quot;, became Styx&#x27;s third chart-topper in Canada, was a No. 3 hit in the US, and was their biggest hit in Germany (No. 8). After a six-year break, Styx returned with &quot;Edge of the Century&quot; (1990), which reached No. 63 in the US with its single, &quot;Show Me the Way&quot;, becoming a top 3 hit in North America in early 1991.

Overall, Styx had eight songs that hit the top 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, as well as 16 top 40 singles. Seven of their eight top 10 singles were written and sung by founding member and lead singer Dennis DeYoung, who has not been part of the band since 1999. Styx sold over 20 million records for A&amp;M between their signing in 1975 and 1984.

==History==
===Band formation and the Wooden Nickel Years (1961–1974)===
In August 1961, at 12 years of age, twin brothers Chuck (guitar) and John Panozzo (drums) first played music together with their 14-year-old neighbor Dennis DeYoung who played accordion and sang, while living in the Roseland, Chicago area, eventually using the band name The Tradewinds. Chuck left to attend seminary for a year but returned to the group by 1964. Tom Nardini had been brought in to replace Chuck Panozzo on guitar, so he decided to play bass when he returned to the band. John Panozzo was the drummer, while DeYoung had switched from accordion to keyboards. In 1965, the Tradewinds name was changed to TW4 (There Were 4) after another band, the Trade Winds, achieved fame nationally. By 1966, the Panozzo brothers had joined DeYoung at Chicago State College and kept the group together by performing at high schools and fraternity parties while studying to be teachers. In 1969 they added a college friend, folk guitarist John Curulewski, after Nardini departed. Hard rock guitarist James &quot;J.Y.&quot; Young came aboard in 1970, making TW4 a quintet.

In 1972 the band members decided to choose a new name when they signed to Wooden Nickel Records after being spotted by a talent scout at a concert at St. John of the Cross Parish in Western Springs, Illinois (Young&#x27;s hometown). Several suggestions were made and, according to DeYoung, the name Styx was chosen because it was &quot;the only one that none of us hated.&quot;

The band released four albums with Wooden Nickel: &quot;Styx&quot; (1972), &quot;Styx II&quot; (1973), &quot;The Serpent Is Rising&quot; (1973), and &quot;Man of Miracles&quot; (1974). These albums contained straight-ahead rockers mixed with prog rock flourish with a lot of guitars, drums, keyboards, percussion, and vocal solos. They established a fan base in the Chicago area, but were unable to break into the mainstream, though the song &quot;Best Thing&quot; from &quot;Styx&quot; charted on September 16, 1972, and stayed on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for 6 weeks, peaking at No. 82. Then, the power ballad &quot;Lady&quot; (from &quot;Styx II&quot;), began to earn some radio time, first on WLS in Chicago in 1974 and then nationwide. In the spring of 1975, nearly two years after the album had been released, &quot;Lady&quot; hit No. 6 in the US, and &quot;Styx II&quot; went gold soon after. &quot;Lady&quot; is considered by many classic rock critics as being the first power ballad with Dennis DeYoung being referred to as the &quot;father of the power ballad&quot;. With the success of &quot;Lady,&quot; a follow-up single on Styx II, &quot;You Need Love&quot;, was re-released, but only barely cracked the hot 100.

===Early A&amp;M Years and addition of Tommy Shaw (1975–1978)===
On the heels of its belated hit single, Styx signed with A&amp;M Records and released &quot;Equinox&quot; (1975), which sold well and yielded a minor hit in &quot;Lorelei&quot;, which reached No. 27 in the U.S. More importantly, it contained the rock anthem &quot;Suite Madame Blue&quot;, which gained the band considerable recognition and airplay on FM radio in the relatively-new Album Oriented Rock (AOR) format. Following the move to A&amp;M, guitarist John Curulewski suddenly left the band as they were to embark on a nationwide tour in December 1975, due to his desire to spend time with his family. After a frantic last-minute search, the band brought in guitarist Tommy Shaw as Curulewski&#x27;s replacement.

&quot;Crystal Ball&quot; (1976), the first album to feature Shaw, was moderately successful, but was overall a disappointment, failing to achieve the sales of its predecessor. The album showcased the band&#x27;s newest member, as Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; reached No. 36.

Styx&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;The Grand Illusion&quot;, was released on July 7, 1977, and became their breakthrough album, reaching Triple Platinum certification. It spawned a top-ten hit and AOR radio staple in the DeYoung-written &quot;Come Sail Away&quot;, which reached No. 8 in 1978. Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Fooling Yourself (The Angry Young Man)&quot; was a second radio hit and reached No. 29 the same year.

Through the late 1970s and early 1980s, the band enjoyed its greatest success. Their 1978 album &quot;Pieces of Eight&quot; found the group moving in a more straight-ahead hard-rock direction and spawned three Shaw sung hit singles &quot;Renegade&quot; (No. 16 in the US) and &quot;Blue Collar Man (Long Nights)&quot; (No. 21 in the US), plus &quot;Sing for the Day&quot; that reached No. 41.

=== 1980s and Superstardom ===
Their 1979 album &quot;Cornerstone&quot; yielded their first No. 1 hit, the DeYoung ballad &quot;Babe&quot;. By early 1980, &quot;Babe&quot; had become the band&#x27;s biggest international hit and first million-selling single, reaching No. 6 in the United Kingdom. The album also included the No. 26 DeYoung hit upbeat &quot;Why Me&quot; and the rocker &quot;Borrowed Time&quot; (U.S. No. 64), which was co-written with Shaw, plus Shaw&#x27;s folksy &quot;Boat on the River&quot; (1980), which was a hit in much of Europe and Japan. The popularity of the album, which reached No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, helped win the band a People&#x27;s Choice Award for Best New Song in 1980. At the 22nd Grammy Awards, Styx was a nominee for Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group and &quot;Cornerstone&quot;&#x27;s engineers Gary Loizzo and Rob Kingsland were nominated for a Grammy for Best Engineered Recording. The band was also named the most popular rock band in the U.S. in the 1980 year end Gallup Poll.

With the success of &quot;Babe,&quot; DeYoung&#x27;s push for a more mainstream direction gained momentum, while Shaw and Young favored a more rock oriented approach. This arguing over musical direction led to ongoing tension in early 1980 after Shaw objected to the ballad &quot;First Time&quot; being released as the second single from &quot;Cornerstone&quot;. Although the song was generating substantial airplay in some major markets, A&amp;M pulled the plug on the single&#x27;s official release, replacing it with &quot;Why Me&quot;. The argument resulted in DeYoung being briefly fired. However, things were quickly smoothed over. While “First Time” did not chart in the U.S. (because it was not released), it became a huge hit single in the Philippines in 1981.

In January 1981, Styx released &quot;Paradise Theatre&quot;, a concept album that became their biggest hit, reaching No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop albums chart and yielding five singles, including the top ten hits &quot;The Best of Times&quot; by DeYoung (No. 3 Billboard, No. 1 Radio &amp; Records) and &quot;Too Much Time on My Hands&quot; by Shaw (No. 9), his only top 10 single as a member of the band. &quot;Paradise Theatre&quot; became the band&#x27;s fourth consecutive multi-platinum album. Based on yet another Dennis DeYoung concept, the Paradise Theatre was a historic Chicago theatre that had been built in the 20s only to fall on hard times and close a mere 30 years after it opened. DeYoung used the Paradise as a metaphor for the United States in the late 1970s/early 1980s.

An ambitious year long world tour commenced in 1981 in support of the album and was one of the top-grossing tours of the year. The tour had numerous Broadway and movie infused elements, including a dramatic opening featuring a theatre sweep and DeYoung by himself next to a player piano and the show ending with traditional movie credits. Throughout the tour and throughout the 1980s and beyond, the band would open their shows with &quot;Rockin&#x27; the Paradise&quot;, the opening track from &quot;Paradise Theatre&quot; which charted at No. 8 on the Top Rocks Track Chart and aired on the MTV cable channel.

The band was accused by a California religious group and later the Parents Music Resource Center of backmasking Satanic messages in their anti-cocaine anthem, &quot;Snowblind&quot;. James &quot;JY&quot; Young has denied this charge during his introduction for &quot;Snowblind&quot; when played live. Dennis DeYoung has denied the accusation as well, joking on the &quot;In the Studio with Redbeard&quot; program &quot;we had enough trouble to make the music sound right forward.&quot; Also, Young quotes, &quot;If we were going to put some message in our songs, we would have put it so it was in the song forward. Not so you would have to buy some $400 tape recorder to hear it.&quot;

===&quot;Kilroy Was Here&quot; and first disbandment (1983–1984)===

The band continued to follow DeYoung&#x27;s lead with their next project, &quot;Kilroy Was Here&quot; (1983), another more fully realized concept album, embracing the rock opera form. It is set in a future where performing and playing rock music has been outlawed due to the efforts of a charismatic evangelist, Dr. Everett Righteous, played by James &quot;JY&quot; Young. &quot;Kilroy Was Here&quot; featured DeYoung in the part of Kilroy, an unjustly imprisoned rock star. Tommy Shaw played the part of Jonathan Chance, a younger rocker who fights for Kilroy&#x27;s freedom and the lifting of the ban on rock music. This future society is served by robots. Called Robotos, these automatons perform many jobs and several serve as Kilroy&#x27;s prison guards.

Part of the impetus for the Kilroy story was the band&#x27;s reaction to the backmasking accusation. The album included Young&#x27;s song &quot;Heavy Metal Poisoning&quot;, which includes lyrics sarcastically mocking the allegations against the group. Its introduction intentionally included a backward message, the Latin phrases, &quot;annuit coeptis&quot; and &quot;novus ordo seclorum&quot;, from the reverse side of the Great Seal of the United States. Referring to the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776, these are translated, &quot;&quot;Annuit cœptis&quot; - He (God) favors our undertakings, and &quot;Novus ordo seclorum&quot; - A new order of the ages.&quot; Both choices also served the Kilroy story because the villain is an evangelist that seeks to expand his Vision of Morality movement via mass demonstrations.

The album &quot;Kilroy Was Here&quot; went Platinum in 1983, boasting two Top Ten hits written and sung by DeYoung, the synthesizer-based &quot;Mr. Roboto&quot; (No. 3 US) and power ballad &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It End&quot; (No. 6 US). The album earned a nomination as Best Engineered Recording for engineer and long-time friend Gary Loizzo and fellow engineers on the album Will Rascati and Rob Kingsland, for the 26th Grammy Awards (1983).

In 1983 the band mounted an ambitious stage show in support of &quot;Kilroy Was Here&quot; featuring theatrical presentations of three songs utilizing instrumental backing tracks, including &quot;Mr. Roboto&quot;, which featured DeYoung singing live while disguised as a Roboto, &quot;Heavy Metal Poisoning&quot; with Young as the evangelist Dr. Righteous singing while the Panozzo brothers acted as his henchmen on stage and &quot;Haven&#x27;t We Been Here Before&quot; with Shaw as Jonathan Chance and DeYoung (as Kilroy in Roboto costume) duetting. The elaborate show was expensive to produce and was not as profitable as previous tours.

&quot;Kilroy Was Here&quot; brought the creative and competitive tensions within the band beyond the breaking point; this was further exacerbated following the band&#x27;s performance of the &quot;Kilroy&quot; show at that year&#x27;s Texxas Jam, an all day, multi-band rock festival held at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas. While most of the other acts on the bill, in comparison, put forth their &quot;hardest rockers&quot; the theatrics of the &quot;Kilroy&quot; show were not well received and they were basically booed off the stage. A disillusioned Shaw departed the band for a solo career at the conclusion of the tour.

In 1984 the band released its first live album, &quot;Caught in the Act&quot;. The project featured one studio track, &quot;Music Time&quot;, which became a Top 40 hit. The concert was also filmed and released on VHS under the same title (and on DVD in 2007). By the time of the album&#x27;s release, they had already parted ways.

===Reformation, &quot;Edge of the Century&quot;, second disbandment and reformation (1990–1996)===
After the group members began discussing a reunion in the late &#x27;80s, this was delayed due to DeYoung&#x27;s recording and the release of his solo album, &quot;Boomchild&quot;, which got pushed back to February 1989. Styx finally reformed in 1990, bringing in Glen Burtnik as a new guitarist since Shaw was by then committed to Damn Yankees.

The new line-up released one album, &quot;Edge of the Century&quot;, featuring the Dennis DeYoung ballad &quot;Show Me the Way&quot;, which received an additional boost just prior to the first Persian Gulf War. Some radio stations edited the Top Three hit to include the voices of children, whose parents were deployed in Saudi Arabia between 1990 and 1991. The song went all the way to No. 3 on both the Hot 100 and at Adult Contemporary radio and notably remained in the top 40 for 23 weeks and AC for 31 weeks. With the huge success of the song &quot;Show Me the Way&quot;, Styx joined a handful of musical acts to have top 10 singles in three decades and under four different presidential administrations.

A follow-up single, “Love At First Sight&quot;, peaked at No. 25 on the Hot 100 and No. 13 on the Adult Contemporary chart.

Styx toured across the US in the spring and summer of 1991 but their success was short-lived as they were dropped in 1992 after A&amp;M Records was purchased by PolyGram Records, ending an over-fifteen-year relationship.

The band reunited once again in 1995, with guitarist Tommy Shaw returning to the fold to re-record &quot;Lady&quot; for &quot;Styx Greatest Hits&quot;. Session drummer Todd Sucherman filled in for John Panozzo, who was unable to participate due to liver problems caused by years of excessive drinking, which eventually claimed his life the following year on July 16.

The 1996 &quot;Return to Paradise&quot; tour, with Sucherman as a full member, was successful. The reunion tour was documented with a two-disc live set, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Return to Paradise&quot;, which featured three new studio tracks: &quot;On My Way&quot;, &quot;Paradise&quot; (a soft rock ballad that also appears in another version on Dennis DeYoung&#x27;s 1996 &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; album), and &quot;Dear John&quot;, a tribute to the late Panozzo that has become a cult favorite among Styx fans. Later on, the concert was documented on DVD. The &quot;Return to Paradise&quot; album was a surprise success in 1997, achieving gold status and the single “Paradise” briefly charting on the Adult Contemporary chart at No. 27. Following the release of the album, Styx embarked on another tour, this one to mark the 20th anniversary of &quot;The Grand Illusion&quot;.

=== &quot;Brave New World&quot; and departure of DeYoung (1999–2000) ===
Two years later, in 1999, the band released its first new studio album in almost a decade: &quot;Brave New World&quot;. But then, due to illness, DeYoung was unable to commit to touring, so he was replaced by Lawrence Gowan, a classically trained pianist, who had achieved platinum success as a solo act on Sony Canada. Gowan&#x27;s 1985 solo hit &quot;A Criminal Mind&quot; was incorporated into their tour set list and was still performed into the 2010s.

Bassist Chuck Panozzo was sidelined in 1999 due to health problems related to his battle with HIV/AIDS. His public &quot;coming out&quot; occurred in 2001 at the annual Human Rights Campaign banquet, with James &quot;JY&quot; Young in attendance for support.

On June 6, 1999, the group reunited briefly to perform for the Children&#x27;s Miracle Network Telethon as DeYoung&#x27;s final performance with the band. Glen Burtnik filled in for Chuck Panozzo on bass.

On June 9, 2000, Styx appeared with REO Speedwagon at the Riverport Amphitheatre. A 2-CD recording of the concert was released as &quot;Arch Allies: Live at Riverport&quot;, with one disc of each band&#x27;s set and both discs concluding with performances of the two bands collaborating on jam versions of Styx&#x27;s &quot;Blue Collar Man&quot; and REO&#x27;s &quot;Roll with the Changes&quot;. Each band also released their set as a separate album, with additional tracks: Styx&#x27;s version was &quot;At the River&#x27;s Edge: Live in St. Louis&quot;.

===&quot;Cyclorama&quot; and &quot;Big Bang Theory&quot; (2003–2009)===

Styx&#x27;s new lineup released several live albums and released the studio album &quot;Cyclorama&quot; in February 2003, which reached No. 127 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album charts. A single &quot;Waiting for Our Time&quot; hit No. 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; mainstream rock chart for 1 week. Styx toured extensively during this period and released additional live albums. Styx also was part of the Super Bowl pre game entertainment in San Diego prior to the Oakland Raiders vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers. They played a short set in the parking lot, as well as on the field right before the game, playing Queen&#x27;s &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;.

Burtnik left Styx in September 2003, to spend time with his family and to pursue a solo career and release the album &quot;Welcome to Hollywood&quot;. He was replaced by Ricky Phillips, formerly of the Babys and Bad English. Panozzo remains in the band but is featured in concerts playing bass on about four songs, including a duet with Lawrence Gowan. Burtnik would go on to join up with DeYoung for numerous tour dates over the next several years.

On June 5, 2004, Styx participated in Eric Clapton&#x27;s Crossroads Guitar Festival covering songs by Jimi Hendrix, B.B. King, and Slim Harpo with Jeff Baxter as a special guest.

In 2005, Styx released an album of cover tunes, &quot;Big Bang Theory&quot;, which reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 50 on the album charts, their highest-charting album since 1990. Their version of the Beatles song &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; received some radio play, and a video was made for the song.

===Continued touring, &quot;The Mission&quot;, and &quot;Crash of the Crown&quot; (2010–present)===
On February 21, 2010, the current incarnation of the band performed before the Sprint Cup Auto Club 500 In Fontana, California. In a North American tour beginning in May 2010, Styx was a co-headliner of United in Rock with Foreigner and special guests Kansas. In July 2010, Styx announced the forthcoming release of &quot;&quot;, a new release featuring six re-recorded hits and a new song entitled &quot;Difference in the World&quot;. This coincided with &quot;The Grand Illusion / Pieces of Eight Tour&quot;, on which both albums were played in their entirety.

In November 2010 Styx announced that they would be filming their concert in Memphis on November 9 for a DVD. The landmark concert was recorded at the historic Orpheum Theater, where Styx performed both of their classic albums, 1977&#x27;s &quot;The Grand Illusion&quot; and 1978&#x27;s &quot;Pieces of Eight&quot;. They also announced that they&#x27;d be touring the UK with Journey and Foreigner for five dates in June 2011.

In early April 2011, it was announced that Styx would join up with Yes for a &quot;Progressive US Tour&quot; that began on July 4, 2011, with Los Angeles-based singer/songwriter Shane Alexander opening. On December 15, 2011, they participated in the figure skating show Improv-Ice, which was broadcast on television January 15, 2012. On January 26, 2013, the Palladia Channel premiered the concert filmed in November 2010. On November 22, 2013, they announced a benefit concert with REO Speedwagon titled &quot;Rock to the Rescue&quot; to raise money for the affected families of the tornado in central Illinois.

The summer of 2014 found the band back on the road in a new touring package called &quot;Soundtrack of Summer&quot;, with Foreigner and ex-Eagle Don Felder. Styx&#x27;s 2015 summer tour saw them re-uniting with Def Leppard. Along with Tesla, the groups played outdoor venues across the United States. In 2016, Styx announced a series of performances to be held at the Venetian in Las Vegas in early 2017 with Felder.

In February 2017, it was announced that Styx and REO Speedwagon would join forces in a tour entitled &quot;United We Rock&quot; with special guest Felder, which was in large concert venues throughout the US. On April 21, 2017, Styx announced a studio album entitled &quot;The Mission&quot;, simultaneously releasing the single &quot;Gone Gone Gone&quot;. The album was released on June 16, 2017, and is a concept album about a mission to Mars.

On April 7, 2021, Styx announced via social media that they would be releasing an EP titled &quot;The Same Stardust EP&quot;, which would feature two new tracks, as well as some live recordings. The EP was released on vinyl on June 12, 2021, exclusively in indie record stores as a part of RSD Drops for Record Store Day 2021. This is the first Styx release to use their original band logo since &quot;The Complete Wooden Nickel Recordings&quot; in 2005.

From April 30, 2021, through May 5, 2021, Styx posted artwork on social media that included a countdown in the corner that would eventually lead to the revealing of their new album &quot;Crash of the Crown&quot;, revealed on May 6, 2021. With the reveal, they released the album&#x27;s title track on streaming platforms. The Prog Report reviewed the album saying it &quot;stands as one of the very finest in their catalogue.&quot;

Despite positive reviews, &quot;Crash of the Crown&quot; charted for only one week on the Billboard 200, peaking at 114.

After first producing &quot;The Mission&quot; and &quot;Crash of the Crown&quot; and joining Styx on stage in Las Vegas to play &quot;The Mission&quot; in its entirety on January 23, 2019, guitarist Will Evankovich joined Styx for their 2021 summer tour that found them back on the road.

On June 5, 2022, Styx was inducted into the Illinois Rock &amp; Roll Museum Hall of Fame. That same night Dennis DeYoung was additionally inducted as a songwriter.

On March 20, 2024, it was announced via social media that Ricky Phillips would be leaving the band to spend more time at home and away from the road. On March 22, 2024, Lawrence Gowan&#x27;s younger brother Terry debuted as the new touring bass player for Styx at their show in Wallingford, CT. On May 17 he was announced as an official member.

==Consecutive multi-platinum albums==
From 1977 to 1981, Styx released four consecutive albums that have been certified Multi-Platinum, for at least 2 million units sold apiece, by the RIAA: &quot;The Grand Illusion&quot; (1977), &quot;Pieces of Eight&quot; (1978), &quot;Cornerstone&quot; (1979) and &quot;Paradise Theatre&quot; (1981).

A longstanding, oft-repeated claim in the music industry and the mainstream press is that Styx was the first band to release four consecutive &quot;Triple&quot;-Platinum albums, signifying at least 3 million units sold. During the period when these albums charted, the RIAA&#x27;s only certifications were for Gold (500,000 units sold) and Platinum (1 million). Multi-Platinum awards were introduced in late October 1984. Following this development, record companies submitted their most popular artists&#x27; sales records to accountants in order to achieve the new thresholds.
Styx did score three Triple-Platinum albums—&quot;The Grand Illusion&quot; (1977), &quot;Pieces of Eight&quot; (1978) and &quot;Paradise Theatre&quot; (1981)—and one Double-Platinum album—&quot;Cornerstone&quot; (1979)—on the same date, November 14, 1984. Complete and detailed historical sales figures for record albums are not readily available to the public, but the certifications, which can be found at the RIAA site, show that the feat the band actually achieved was being the first group to be awarded four consecutive Multi-Platinum albums with three of those ranking better than Double Platinum. Styx achieved another Double-Platinum album—&quot;Greatest Hits (Volume I)&quot;—on August 23, 2005.

<text>Giovanni Ceva (September 1, 1647 – May 13, 1734) was an Italian mathematician widely known for proving Ceva&#x27;s theorem in elementary geometry. His brother, Tommaso Ceva, was also a well-known poet and mathematician.

==Life==
Ceva received his education at a Jesuit college in Milan. Later in his life, he studied at the University of Pisa, where he subsequently became a professor. In 1686, however, he was designated as the Professor of Mathematics at the University of Mantua and worked there for the rest of his life.

==Work==

Ceva studied geometry for most of his long life. In 1678, he published a now famous theorem on synthetic geometry in a triangle called Ceva&#x27;s Theorem. The theorem,
already known to Yusuf Al-Mu&#x27;taman ibn Hűd in 11th century, states that if three line segments are drawn from the vertices of a triangle to the opposite sides, then the three line segments are concurrent if, and only if, the product of the ratios of the newly created line segments on each side of the triangle is equal to one. He published this theorem in &quot;De lineis rectis&quot;.

Ceva also rediscovered and published Menelaus&#x27;s theorem. He published &quot;Opuscula mathematica&quot; in 1682 and &quot;Geometria Motus&quot; in 1692, as well. In &quot;Geometria Motus&quot;, he anticipated the infinitesimal calculus. Finally, Ceva wrote &quot;De Re Nummaria&quot; in 1711, which was one of the first books in mathematical economics.

Giovanni Ceva also studied applications of mechanics and statics to geometric systems. At one point, however, he incorrectly resolved that the periods of oscillation of two pendulums were in the same ratio as their lengths, but he later realized and corrected the error. Ceva also worked on hydraulics. In 1728, he published &quot;Opus hydrostaticum&quot; which discusses his work in hydraulics. In fact, he used his knowledge of hydraulics to stop a project from diverting the river Reno into the river Po.

<text>In Euclidean geometry, Ceva&#x27;s theorem is a theorem about triangles. Given a triangle , let the lines be drawn from the vertices to a common point (not on one of the sides of ), to meet opposite sides at respectively. (The segments are known as cevians.) Then, using signed lengths of segments,
:formula_1
In other words, the length is taken to be positive or negative according to whether is to the left or right of in some fixed orientation of the line. For example, is defined as having positive value when is between and and negative otherwise.

Ceva&#x27;s theorem is a theorem of affine geometry, in the sense that it may be stated and proved without using the concepts of angles, areas, and lengths (except for the ratio of the lengths of two line segments that are collinear). It is therefore true for triangles in any affine plane over any field.

A slightly adapted converse is also true: If points are chosen on respectively so that 
: formula_2
then are concurrent, or all three parallel. The converse is often included as part of the theorem.

The theorem is often attributed to Giovanni Ceva, who published it in his 1678 work &quot;De lineis rectis&quot;. But it was proven much earlier by Yusuf Al-Mu&#x27;taman ibn Hűd, an eleventh-century king of Zaragoza.

Associated with the figures are several terms derived from Ceva&#x27;s name: cevian (the lines are the cevians of ), cevian triangle (the triangle is the cevian triangle of ); cevian nest, anticevian triangle, Ceva conjugate. (&quot;Ceva&quot; is pronounced Chay&#x27;va; &quot;cevian&quot; is pronounced chev&#x27;ian.)

The theorem is very similar to Menelaus&#x27; theorem in that their equations differ only in sign. By re-writing each in terms of cross-ratios, the two theorems may be seen as projective duals.

==Proofs==

Several proofs of the theorem have been created. 
Two proofs are given in the following. 

The first one is very elementary, using only basic properties of triangle areas. However, several cases have to be considered, depending on the position of the point . 

The second proof uses barycentric coordinates and vectors, but is more natural and not case dependent. Moreover, it works in any affine plane over any field.

===Using triangle areas===

First, the sign of the left-hand side is positive since either all three of the ratios are positive, the case where is inside the triangle (upper diagram), or one is positive and the other two are negative, the case is outside the triangle (lower diagram shows one case).

To check the magnitude, note that the area of a triangle of a given height is proportional to its base. So 
: formula_3
Therefore,
:formula_4
(Replace the minus with a plus if and are on opposite sides of .)
Similarly,
: formula_5
and
: formula_6
Multiplying these three equations gives
: formula_7
as required.

The theorem can also be proven easily using Menelaus&#x27;s theorem. From the transversal of triangle ,
: formula_8
and from the transversal of triangle ,
: formula_9
The theorem follows by dividing these two equations.

The converse follows as a corollary. Let be given on the lines so that the equation holds. Let meet at and let be the point where crosses . Then by the theorem, the equation also holds for . Comparing the two, 
: formula_10
But at most one point can cut a segment in a given ratio so .

===Using barycentric coordinates===

Given three points that are not collinear, and a point , that belongs to the same plane, the barycentric coordinates of with respect of are the unique three numbers formula_11 such that
:formula_12 
and
:formula_13
for every point (for the definition of this arrow notation and further details, see Affine space).

For Ceva&#x27;s theorem, the point is supposed to not belong to any line passing through two vertices of the triangle. This implies that formula_14

If one takes for the intersection of the lines and (see figures), the last equation may be rearranged into
:formula_15 
The left-hand side of this equation is a vector that has the same direction as the line , and the right-hand side has the same direction as the line . These lines have different directions since are not collinear. It follows that the two members of the equation equal the zero vector, and 
:formula_16
It follows that 
:formula_17
where the left-hand-side fraction is the signed ratio of the lengths of the collinear line segments and .

The same reasoning shows
:formula_18
Ceva&#x27;s theorem results immediately by taking the product of the three last equations.

==Generalizations==
The theorem can be generalized to higher-dimensional simplexes using barycentric coordinates. Define a cevian of an -simplex as a ray from each vertex to a point on the opposite ()-face (facet). Then the cevians are concurrent if and only if a mass distribution can be assigned to the vertices such that each cevian intersects the opposite facet at its center of mass. Moreover, the intersection point of the cevians is the center of mass of the simplex.

Another generalization to higher-dimensional simplexes extends the conclusion of Ceva&#x27;s theorem that the product of certain ratios is 1. Starting from a point in a simplex, a point is defined inductively on each -face. This point is the foot of a cevian that goes from the vertex opposite the -face, in a ()-face that contains it, through the point already defined on this ()-face. Each of these points divides the face on which it lies into lobes. Given a cycle of pairs of lobes, the product of the ratios of the volumes of the lobes in each pair is 1. 

Routh&#x27;s theorem gives the area of the triangle formed by three cevians in the case that they are not concurrent. Ceva&#x27;s theorem can be obtained from it by setting the area equal to zero and solving.

The analogue of the theorem for general polygons in the plane has been known since the early nineteenth century.
The theorem has also been generalized to triangles on other surfaces of constant curvature.

The theorem also has a well-known generalization to spherical and hyperbolic geometry, replacing the lengths in the ratios with their sines and hyperbolic sines, respectively.

<text>Corey Woods (born January 12, 1970), better known by his stage name Raekwon ( ), is an American rapper. He rose to prominence as a founding member of the hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan, which achieved mainstream success following the release of their debut album, &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot;, in 1993. Raekwon would subsequently pursue a solo career, releasing his first solo album, entitled &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...&quot;, in 1995. The album received critical acclaim, and is regarded by many critics as one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time, as well as a staple of 1990s rap.

Whereas his next two albums, &quot;Immobilarity&quot; in 1999 and then &quot;The Lex Diamond Story&quot; in 2003, drew mixed reviews, his fourth album, long delayed, &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II&quot;, released in September 2009, was likened to &quot;The Godfather 2&quot;. Recognized for his &quot;street epics&quot; that are &quot;straightforward yet linguistically rich,&quot; Raekwon is ranked among leading rappers. Meanwhile, he founded the record label ICE H20 Records.

== Early life ==
Raekwon was born Corey Woods in Brownsville, Brooklyn, where he was raised by his mother during his early childhood. His father was an addict. Raekwon only met his father once when he was six years old. On that occasion, his father brought him to meet his paternal grandmother (also for the first time) and then snuck out of the apartment. Raekwon moved with his mother to Staten Island after his mother was robbed. They were living in Park Hill by the time Raekwon was adolescent.

Raekwon attributes the name Raekwon to the Five-Percent Nation, an offshoot of the Nation of Islam, when he was a &quot;young kid.&quot; He converted to Islam in 2009.

Growing up, he witnessed his mother being hit and abused by different men, an experience which he said &quot;affected [him] a lot.&quot; As a young man, his mother kicked him out of their Park Hill home when Raekwon got into an argument with her boyfriend and his mother sided with the boyfriend. During this time, he spiraled into a pattern of hopelessness and violent behavior. He became addicted to cocaine and crack cocaine until he became aware of how the crack epidemic was affecting those around him, at which point &quot;it was an automatic stop.&quot;

Raekwon and rap partner Ghostface Killah attended junior high school together on Staten Island. Raekwon attended New Dorp High School, where he befriended rappers Remedy, Method Man and Inspectah Deck.

After being caught in a crossfire and accidentally shot four times, Raekwon began rapping in earnest. He later described being shot as an &quot;important eye opener.&quot;

== Career ==
=== Wu-Tang Clan ===

Woods first rapped as Sha Raider. In 1992, he joined the Wu-Tang Clan, an originally nine-member rap group drawing mainly from the Staten Island but also from the Brooklyn boroughs of New York City. He rapped as Raekwon The Chef, and also used the aliases Lex Diamonds, Shallah Raekwon, and Louis Rich.

As recording artists, the Wu-Tang Clan debuted with the November 1993 album &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot;, which was later certified platinum. Its single &quot;C.R.E.A.M.&quot; reached #8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; rap chart. &quot;Wu-Tang Forever&quot;, a double album, followed in 1997, and was certified 4x multi-platinum. Amid other solo albums by its members, the group released &quot;The W&quot; in 2000, &quot;Iron Flag&quot; in 2001, and &quot;8 Diagrams&quot; in 2007.
=== &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...&quot; ===
In 1994, Raekwon signed a solo deal with Loud Records and released his debut solo single &quot;Heaven &amp; Hell&quot; for the soundtrack to the film &quot;Fresh&quot;. His first solo album, &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...&quot;, was released on August 1, 1995. Sales lagged his fellow Wu-Tang member Method Man&#x27;s &quot;Tical&quot;. Raekwon&#x27;s album drew rave reviews, however, and it was promptly recognized as a classic.

The album&#x27;s narrative struggle is set to imagery of criminal activity, largely cocaine trafficking, and emergence from it into the good life. Wu-Tang member and house producer RZA, who produced the entire album, called it &quot;like a crime mafia story.&quot; Wu-Tang member Ghostface Killah rapped in over half of the album&#x27;s tracks, and the two wrote some lyrics in Barbados and Miami. It also follows a cinematic narrative, inspired by mob and kung-fu movies and a plethora of references and samples in which the main rapping lines with an on-going story of struggle and success. 

Raekwon explained the lyrics&#x27; context as &quot;trying to get out the hood. We wanted to buy the most expensive cars and jewelry and different things like that.&quot; The album, he perceived, &quot;was only built for a certain lifestyle or people that understood that language. But eventually, it would break off to people looking at it as a movie and respecting it saying, &#x27;Yo, wow! This is authentic. This is something that never been done before&#x27; &quot; &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...&quot; debuted at No. 4 on the popular albums chart the Billboard 200, and at No. 2 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It shipped about 130,000 copies in its first week, and was certified gold, at least 500,000 copies shipped, two months later, October 1995.

=== &quot;Immobilarity&quot; and &quot;The Lex Diamond Story&quot; ===
After &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...&quot;, Raekwon featured on R&amp;B group Allure&#x27;s debut or 1997 album. He also featured alongside rappers Nas, Jadakiss, and Big Pun in rapper Fat Joe&#x27;s song &quot;John Blaze.&quot; Raekwon&#x27;s next album, &quot;Immobilarity&quot;, lacking RZA&#x27;s record production and Ghostface Killah features, was issued in 1999 to mixed reviews. &quot;The Lex Diamond Story&quot;, released in 2003 under major label Universal Records, also drew mixed reviews, most critics unimpressed while user reviews widely varied. Raekwon cited a low promotional budget.

=== &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II&quot; ===

Raekwon planned to release &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II&quot; through record producer Dr. Dre&#x27;s label Aftermath Entertainment in 2007. Raekwon credited the executive producer Busta Rhymes with restoring his &quot;&quot;Cuban Linx&quot; mindset,&quot; while most tracks were produced by RZA, who likened collaboration with Dr. Dre to &quot;yin and yang&quot; styles.

Amid many delays, as for sample clearance, the &quot;Only Built For Cuban Linx... Pt. II&quot; track &quot;Surgical Gloves&quot; had been leaked already when the album was released by Raekwon&#x27;s label, Ice H20, under major label EMI&#x27;s distribution on September 8, 2009. The album features Wu-Tang members and affiliates as well as Slick Rick, Jadakiss, Busta Rhymes, Beanie Sigel, and others.

Also in September 2009, MTV ranked Raekwon tenth among &quot;hottest&quot; rappers. In December, HipHopDx&#x27;s 2009 awards named &quot;Only Built For Cuban Linx... Pt. II&quot; album of the year, calling it &quot;the Hip Hop equivalent to &quot;The Godfather 2&quot;, with Rae as revitalized as Marlon was&quot;. Raekwon won Emcee of the Year—the prior year, Nas won—while HipHopDX staff explained,

=== &quot;Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang&quot; ===

After the critical and relative commercial success of &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II&quot;, Raekwon collaborated with Method Man and Ghostface Killah for &quot;Wu-Massacre&quot;, a short trio album designed to showcase unity within the group. Following this release, Raekwon resurrected talk of &quot;Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang&quot;, a project announced in 2007, originally planned as a Wu-Tang album, minus RZA, due to his response to the previous group album &quot;8 Diagrams&quot;. Raekwon forwarded his projects continuously through his growing label Icewater. He both worked on his own project while signing other underground artists.

Although not a Wu-Tang Clan project, &quot;Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang&quot; was released in March 2011, serving as Raekwon&#x27;s fifth solo LP. As originally planned, RZA did not participate on the project, however, several other Wu-Tang members made appearances, as well as Black Thought, Nas and Rick Ross, among others. Raekwon revealed that he intends on eventually releasing a third installment to the &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...&quot; albums.

=== &quot;Lost Jewlry&quot;, &quot;Fly International Luxurious Art&quot;, &quot;The Wild&quot;, and present ===
In 2012, Raekwon launched his own record label, Ice H20 Records. Raekwon announced on November 30, 2012, that he would soon release an EP entitled &quot;Lost Jewlry&quot;. On December 20, he released &quot;Never Can Say Goodbye&quot;, which did not end up on the EP. &quot;Lost Jewlry&quot; was released on January 15, 2013. It featured guest appearances from Maino and Freddie Gibbs, as well as production from Scram Jones, among others.

On January 1, 2013, Raekwon announced that the title of his next album would be &quot;F.I.L.A.&quot;, an acronym for &quot;Fly International Luxurious Art&quot;, and that it would be released during the second quarter of 2013. He would later specify a release month of September 2013. Following the release of the first single &quot;All About You&quot;, Raekwon intimated that the album would be released in January 2014; it finally saw release on April 28, 2015. In November 2016, Raekwon announced that a new album was complete.

On March 24, 2017, Raekwon released a studio album, &quot;The Wild&quot;, his first not to feature collaborations with fellow members of the Wu-Tang Clan. Critical reception was positive, with Pitchfork saying the album was stronger than &quot;Fly&quot;, which it alleged had a &quot;bloated roster&quot;. Consequence of Sound agreed, saying &quot;The Wild&quot; was largely understood as a return to form by Raekwon, with fewer guest appearances by other artists than usual and more focus on Raekwon&#x27;s long-established style, albeit with the &quot;maximalist modern production&quot; he had employed on &quot;Fly&quot;.

Raekwon was featured as a guest on the intro to the &quot;WWCD&quot; compilation by Griselda. On August 1, 2020, Elliot Wilson, of Tidal and &quot;Rap Radar&quot;, announced Raekwon will be releasing &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx 3&quot; soon. In his most recent appearance, Raekwon provided guest vocals alongside Ghostface Killah and Busta Rhymes on &quot;Science Class&quot;, a song off Griselda leader Westside Gunn&#x27;s 2022 mixtape &quot;10&quot;.

<doc id="152435" wikidata="Q1382357" url="?curid=152435" title="Quicksilver Messenger Service">
<text>Quicksilver Messenger Service is an American psychedelic rock band formed in 1965 in San Francisco. The band achieved wide popularity in the San Francisco Bay Area and, through their recordings, with psychedelic rock enthusiasts around the globe, and several of their albums ranked in the Top 30 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop charts. They were part of the new wave of album-oriented bands, achieving renown and popularity despite a lack of success with their singles (only one, &quot;Fresh Air&quot; charted, reaching number 49 in 1970). Though not as commercially successful as contemporaries Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead, Quicksilver was integral to the beginnings of their genre. With their jazz and classical influences and a strong folk background, the band attempted to create an individual, innovative sound. Music historian Colin Larkin wrote: &quot;Of all the bands that came out of the San Francisco area during the late &#x27;60s, Quicksilver typified most of the style, attitude and sound of that era.&quot;

The band&#x27;s members included John Cipollina, Gary Duncan, Greg Elmore, David Freiberg, Nicky Hopkins, and Dino Valenti. Valenti drew heavily on musical influences he picked up during the folk revival of his formative musical years. The style he developed from these sources is evident in Quicksilver Messenger Service&#x27;s swing rhythms and twanging guitar sounds. After many years, the band has attempted to re-form despite the deaths of several members. In 2006, Duncan and Freiberg toured as the Quicksilver Messenger Service, using various backing musicians.

==History==

===Formation===
There is some confusion as to the real origins of the group. According to John Cipollina:

The next day, Valenti was arrested for possession of marijuana and spent the better part of the next two years in jail. However, Gary Duncan has stated:

Whether or not Quicksilver Messenger Service was what Valenti had in mind, it appears from Duncan&#x27;s recollections that he had at least talked with Cipollina about forming a band; Cipollina remembered that:

David Freiberg, a folk-guitarist friend of Valenti, was recruited to the group. He had previously been in a band with Paul Kantner and David Crosby but like Cipollina he had been arrested and briefly jailed for marijuana possession and had just been released. &quot;We were to take care of this guy Freiberg&quot;, Cipollina recalled, and though they had never met before, Freiberg was integrated into the group. The band also added Skip Spence on guitar and began to rehearse at Marty Balin&#x27;s club, the Matrix. Balin, in search of a drummer for the band he was organizing (which became Jefferson Airplane), convinced Spence to switch instruments and groups.

To make up for poaching Spence, Balin suggested that they contact drummer Greg Elmore and guitarist–singer Gary Duncan, who had played together in a group called The Brogues. This new version of the group played its first concert performance in December 1965, playing for the Christmas party of the Committee (improv group). Drummer Greg Elmore and guitarist Jim Murray were added to fill out the original band.

It was a band without a name, Cipollina recalled:
===Management===
The group&#x27;s early management was by Ambrose Hollingworth, who became a paraplegic as a result of an automobile crash near Muir Beach, California in 1966. Hollingworth&#x27;s stewardship, which also included the all-female Ace of Cups, transferred to Ron Polte. Polte was known for going to great lengths to accommodate the needs of his musicians. When perennial studio musician Nicky Hopkins joined the band in 1969, it was the first and only band that officially included him in its performing and recording revenues. Hollingsworth died in 1996, and Polte in 2016.

===Early years===
Jim Murray left the group not long after they performed at the Monterey International Pop Festival in June 1967. The band began a period of heavy touring on the West Coast of the United States where they built up a solid following and featured on many star-studded bills at the Avalon Ballroom and the Fillmore West. Sound system pioneer, inventor, and engineer (and famous LSD chemist) Owsley Stanley regularly recorded concerts at major San Francisco venues during this period, and his archive includes many Quicksilver Messenger Service live performances from 1966 and 1967, which were released on his Bear Recordings label in 2008 and 2009.

Quicksilver Messenger Service initially held back from committing to a record deal but eventually signed to Capitol Records in late 1967, becoming the last of the top-ranked San Francisco bands to join a major label. Capitol was the only company that had missed out on signing a San Francisco &quot;hippie&quot; band during the first flurry of record company interest and, consequently, Quicksilver Messenger Service was able to negotiate a better deal than many of their peers. At the same time, Capitol signed the Steve Miller Band, with whom Quicksilver Messenger Service had appeared on the movie and soundtrack album &quot;Revolution&quot;, together with the group Mother Earth.

Quicksilver Messenger Service released their eponymous debut album in 1968. It was followed by &quot;Happy Trails&quot;, released in early 1969 and largely recorded live at the Fillmore East and the Fillmore West. Like most live albums of the time, &quot;Happy Trails&quot; made extensive use of studio overdubs, and the last two songs were recorded entirely in the studio, but it has nonetheless been called the most accurate reproduction of the band&#x27;s acclaimed live performances. &quot;Happy Trails&quot; was awarded a gold album in the United States.

These albums, which have been hailed as &quot;...two of the best examples of the San Francisco sound at its purest,&quot; emphasize extended arrangements and fluid twin-guitar improvisation. Cipollina&#x27;s highly melodic, individualistic lead guitar style, combined with Gary Duncan&#x27;s driving minor scale, jazzy guitar playing, resulted in a clear, notable contrast to the heavily amplified and overdriven sound of contemporaries like Cream and Jimi Hendrix. In 2003 &quot;Happy Trails&quot; was rated at No. 189 in the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Top 500 albums survey, where it was described as &quot;...the definitive live recording of the mid-Sixties San Francisco psychedelic-ballroom experience...&quot; Archetypal Quicksilver Messenger Service songs include the elongated rendition of Bo Diddley&#x27;s &quot;Who Do You Love?&quot; on &quot;Happy Trails&quot;.

Duncan left the group not long after the recording of &quot;Happy Trails&quot;; according to David Freiberg, this was largely because of his escalating problems with opiates and amphetamines. His &#x27;farewell&#x27; performances were the studio recordings that ended up on &quot;Happy Trails&quot; and a final live performance with the band on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1969. Duncan recalled 18 years later:

Freiberg later recalled that Duncan&#x27;s departure shook the core of the band: &quot;Duncan was the &#x27;engine&#x27; man, it just didn&#x27;t WORK without him ... for me. I was really ... I was devastated...&quot;

For their 1969 album &quot;Shady Grove&quot;, Duncan was replaced by renowned English session keyboardist Nicky Hopkins, who had played on scores of hit albums and singles by acts like the Kinks, the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, the Who, The Jeff Beck Group and Steve Miller. Hopkins&#x27; virtuoso piano boogie dominates the album, giving it a unique sound within the Quicksilver catalog.

===Dino Valenti rejoins===
Gary Duncan and Dino Valenti both returned to Quicksilver Messenger Service at this time, expanding the group to a six-piece. The next two albums, &quot;Just for Love&quot; and &quot;What About Me&quot;, were recorded simultaneously in Hawaii. Much of &quot;What About Me&quot; was recorded at Pacific High Recording in San Francisco, and both albums were mixed at Pacific High.

The band&#x27;s approach to recording was undisciplined, with Valenti renting a building without electricity to record in. The finished albums took many hours in the studio because the group had a contract which allowed unlimited studio time with no Capitol producer present unless invited. The producer was only invited to the studio to hear the playing of the finished albums.

The albums are a departure from the group&#x27;s earlier sound, with Valenti taking over as lead singer and, under the pseudonym of Jesse Oris Farrow, principal songwriter. The records sold relatively well and produced the group&#x27;s one hit radio single, &quot;Fresh Air&quot;. John Cipollina and Nicky Hopkins departed soon after their experiences in Hawaii. Hopkins apparently left during the Hawaii recording sessions, as founding Paul Butterfield Blues Band keyboardist Mark Naftalin takes his place for three cuts on &quot;What About Me&quot;.

===Later years===
The band continued with the lineup of Gary Duncan, Greg Elmore, Dino Valenti and David Freiberg until September 1971, when Freiberg was jailed for marijuana possession; he was replaced by Mark Ryan. Following his recent session contributions, Naftalin joined the band in earnest. This lineup recorded two commercially unsuccessful albums (&quot;Quicksilver&quot; [1971; No. 114] and &quot;Comin&#x27; Thru&quot; [1972; No. 134]) that left the group without a recording contract. Duncan&#x27;s &quot;Doin&#x27; Time in the USA&quot; from the latter album enjoyed a modicum of FM radio play at the time, while the &quot;Quicksilver&quot; track &quot;Fire Brothers&quot; was later covered by 4AD founder Ivo Watts-Russell&#x27;s This Mortal Coil on &quot;Filigree and Shadow&quot; (1986).

Now largely a part-time vehicle for Valenti and Duncan, the group continued to tour sporadically over the next two years, playing a mixture of headlining club dates and arena/stadium support slots for more popular groups such as The James Gang. Naftalin departed the band in 1972 and was replaced by Chuck Steaks. Harold Aceves, formerly a roadie for the band, also joined the band at the same time as a second drummer. Ryan was fired in 1972 after missing a flight; he was replaced by Roger Stanton. Stanton had played with Aceves in a popular Phoenix, Arizona band Poland. Stanton remained with the band until 1974 when he was replaced by Bob Flurie, who was a well-known East Coast virtuoso guitar player. This Quicksilver lineup disbanded in 1975. Aceves, Stanton, and Flurie later backed former Country Joe and the Fish guitarist Barry Melton.

In 1975, Elmore, Duncan, Valenti, Freiberg and Cipollina recorded a reunion album, &quot;Solid Silver&quot;, on Capitol Records. The album also included contributions from a variety of Bay Area musicians, including former keyboardist Nicky Hopkins, session vocalist Kathi McDonald and Jefferson Starship multi-instrumentalist Pete Sears. Freiberg had initially replaced Marty Balin in Jefferson Airplane following his release from prison in 1972 and remained with the group as they evolved into the mammothly successful Jefferson Starship. Released in November 1975, &quot;Solid Silver&quot; fared better from a commercial and critical standpoint than the preceding two albums but only managed to peak at No. 89. While Freiberg elected not to rejoin the live group as a result of his Jefferson Starship commitments, Cipollina, keyboardist Michael Lewis and bassist Skip Olsen toured with the returning trio for a handful of concerts in 1975, culminating in an appearance at San Francisco&#x27;s Winterland Ballroom on December 28. Shortly thereafter, Cipollina departed once again and the remaining quintet continued to tour clubs intermittently until finally dissolving in 1979.

==Remnants and reunions==
After leaving Quicksilver in October 1970, Cipollina formed Copperhead, which was initially a loose and variable aggregation before coalescing around the less transitory lineup of Cipollina, Gary Philippet (vocals, guitar, and organ), Jim McPherson (vocals, bass, and piano), Pete Sears (bass, piano)(Sears was to leave after a matter of months being replaced in 1972 by longtime Bonnie Raitt bassist James &quot;Hutch&quot; Hutchinson, who appeared on the album and played with the band until its demise), and David Weber (drums). Although Clive Davis was particularly enamored of the group and signed them to a lucrative deal with Columbia Records, their eponymous 1973 debut failed to gain traction in the marketplace despite heavy touring, leading to Columbia refusing to release their second album and hastening their disbandment. In 1974, Cipollina guested with Quicksilver-idolizing Welsh progressive rock group Man, playing with them at their 1974 Winterland concerts and on a subsequent UK tour; these efforts resulted in the 1975 live album &quot;Maximum Darkness&quot;. Unable to secure a major label contract in the aftermath of the 1975 Quicksilver reunion, Cipollina continued to perform regularly with many other Bay Area acts, including one billed as Thunder and Lightning, a joint venture with Nick Gravenites, who had co-produced Quicksilver&#x27;s debut, and another billed as Fish and Chips, with Barry Melton; Greg Elmore played drums for the former, Spencer Dryden for the latter, with Peter Albin on bass; various bass players, including Albin and Roger Troy, played with the former. During the same period, Cipollina became a founding member of the Dinosaurs in 1982 while continuing throughout the 80s to play club gigs with both other bands. He died in 1989 at the age of 45 from complications of emphysema exacerbated by Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. Some of Cipollina&#x27;s equipment is displayed at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Hopkins continued his career as a session and touring musician with a variety of acts, including Jefferson Airplane, the Rolling Stones (most notably on &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; and the group&#x27;s ensuing 1972 American tour), the Jerry Garcia Band and Joe Cocker. In the 1980s, he joined the controversial Church of Scientology and credited the organization&#x27;s Purification Rundown with vanquishing his long struggle with substance abuse. Hopkins died in September 1994 from complications resulting from intestinal surgery related to his lifelong battle with Crohn&#x27;s disease.

Valenti underwent brain surgery for an arteriovenous malformation in the late 1980s; despite suffering from short-term memory loss and struggling with the adverse effects of anti-convulsive medications, he continued to write songs and perform with various Marin County musicians until his sudden death in November 1994.

In 1984 Gary Duncan resurrected the brand as &quot;Gary Duncan&#x27;s Quicksilver&quot; and released several albums with a reconstituted lineup, including &quot;Peace By Piece&quot; in 1986, &quot;Shapeshifter Vols. 1 &amp; 2&quot; in 1996, &quot;Shapeshifter Vols. 3 &amp; 4&quot; and &quot;Strange Trim&quot; in 2006. He also issued several live albums and created a website, quicksilvermessengerservice.com. The group also toured as &quot;Quicksilver &#x27;96&quot;, and after that on occasion through the early 2000s, with a lineup of Duncan, Michael Lewis (keyboards), Greg Errico (drums), Bobby Vega (bass), John Bird (guitar), and Tony Menjivar (percussion).

In 2006 Gary Duncan and David Freiberg launched a 40th-anniversary Quicksilver celebration tour as Quicksilver Messenger Service, with Bobby Vega (soon to be replaced by Keith Graves on bass), singer Linda Imperial (Freiberg&#x27;s wife and contributor to Quicksilver projects before as a backup singer) and Jefferson Starship players Prairie Prince (drums) and Chris Smith (keyboards). Following a series of tours, Duncan left the band in 2009. He was replaced by Peter Harris, and the band continued as David Freiberg&#x27;s Quicksilver Messenger Service.

Still active as of 2021, they often opened for the reconstituted Jefferson Starship (led by Freiberg and Paul Kantner) until Kantner&#x27;s death in 2016. Duncan died aged 72 on June 29, 2019, in Woodland, California after suffering a seizure and falling into a coma.

Quicksilver Gold, a tribute band, formed in 2002. Members included Dino Valenti&#x27;s son, Joli Valenti, as well as John Cipollina&#x27;s brother, Mario Cipollina, and some members of Zero. This band broke up in 2004.

<text>The Boeing 717 is an American five-abreast narrow-body airliner produced by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The twin-engine airliner was developed for the 100-seat market and originally marketed by McDonnell Douglas in the early 1990s as the MD-95 until the company merged with Boeing in August 1997. It was a shortened derivative of McDonnell Douglas’ successful airliner, the MD-80, and part of the company&#x27;s broader DC-9 family. Capable of seating up to 134 passengers, the 717 has a design range of . It is powered by two Rolls-Royce BR715 turbofan engines mounted at the rear of the fuselage.

The first order for the airliner was placed with McDonnell Douglas in October 1995 by ValuJet Airlines (later AirTran Airways). With the 1997 merger taking place prior to production, the airliner entered service in 1999 as the &quot;Boeing 717&quot;. Production of the type ceased in May 2006 after 155 were delivered, with 99 examples remaining in service as of November 2024. The type has not been involved in a hull loss or fatal incident.

== Development ==

=== Background ===
Douglas Aircraft launched the DC-9, a short-range companion to its larger four-engine DC-8, in 1963. The DC-9 was an all-new design, using two rear fuselage-mounted Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D turbofan engines; a small, efficient wing; and a T-tail. The DC-9&#x27;s maiden flight was in 1965 and entered airline service later that year. When production ended in 1982, a total of 976 DC-9s had been produced.

The McDonnell Douglas MD-80 series, the second generation of the DC-9, began airline service in 1980. It was a lengthened DC-9-50 with a higher maximum take-off weight (MTOW) and higher fuel capacity, as well as next-generation Pratt and Whitney JT8D-200 series engines and an improved wing design. 1,191 MD-80s were delivered from 1980 to 1999.

The MD-90 was developed from the MD-80 series. It was launched in 1989 and first flew in 1993. The MD-90 was longer and featured a glass cockpit (electronic instrumentation) and more powerful, quieter, fuel-efficient IAE V2525-D5 engines, with the option of upgrading to an IAE V2528 engine. A total of 116 MD-90 airliners were delivered.

=== MD-95 ===
The MD-95 traces its history back to 1983 when McDonnell Douglas outlined a study named the &quot;DC-9-90&quot;. During the early 1980s, as production of the DC-9 family moved away from the smaller Series 30 towards the larger Super 80 (later redesignated MD-80) variants, McDonnell Douglas proposed a smaller version of the DC-9 to fill the gap left by the DC-9-30. Dubbed the DC-9-90, it was revealed in February 1983 and was to be some shorter than the DC-9-81, giving it an overall length of . The aircraft was proposed with a thrust version of the JT8D-200 series engine, although the CFM International CFM56-3 was also considered. Seating up to 117 passengers, the DC-9-90 was to be equipped with the DC-9&#x27;s wing with tip extensions, rather than the more heavily modified increased area of the MD-80. The aircraft had a design range of , with an option to increase to , and a gross weight of .

The DC-9-90 was designed to meet the needs of the newly deregulated American airline industry. However, its development was postponed by the recession of the early 1980s. When McDonnell Douglas did develop a smaller version of the MD-80, it simply shrunk the aircraft to create the MD-87, rather than offer a lower thrust, lighter aircraft that was more comparable to the DC-9-30. With its relatively high MTOW and powerful engines, the MD-87 essentially became a special mission aircraft and could not compete with the all new 100-seaters then being developed. Although an excellent aircraft for specialized roles, the MD-87 often was not sold on its own. Relying on its commonality factor, sales were generally limited to existing MD-80 operators.

In 1991, McDonnell Douglas revealed that it was again considering developing a specialized 100-seat version of the MD-80, initially named the &quot;MD-87-105&quot; (105 seats). It was to be some shorter than the MD-87, powered with engines in the thrust class. McDonnell Douglas, Pratt &amp; Whitney, and the China National Aero-Technology Import Export Agency signed a memorandum of understanding to develop a 105-seat version of the MD-80. At the 1991 Paris Airshow, McDonnell Douglas announced the development of a 105-seat aircraft, designated &quot;MD-95&quot;. The new name was selected to reflect the anticipated year deliveries would begin. McDonnell Douglas first offered the MD-95 for sale in 1994.

In early 1994, the MD-95 re-emerged as similar to the DC-9-30, its specified weight, dimensions, and fuel capacity being almost identical. Major changes included a fuselage &quot;shrink&quot; back to length (same as the DC-9-30), and the reversion to the original DC-9 wingspan of . At this time, McDonnell Douglas said that it expected the MD-95 to become a family of aircraft with the capability of increased range and seating capacity. The MD-95 was developed to satisfy the market need to replace early DC-9s, then approaching 30 years old. The MD-95 was a complete overhaul, going back to the original DC-9-30 design and applying new engines, cockpit and other more modern systems.

In March 1995, longtime McDonnell Douglas customer Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) chose the Boeing 737-600 for its 100-seater over the MD-95. In October 1995, U.S. new entrant and low-cost carrier ValuJet signed an order for 50 MD-95s, plus 50 options. McDonnell Douglas president Harry Stonecipher felt that launching MD-95 production on the basis of this single order held little risk, stating that further orders would &quot;take a while longer&quot;. The ValuJet order was the only order received for some two years.

=== Engines ===
As first proposed, the MD-95 was to be powered by a thrust derivative of the JT8D-200 series with the Rolls-Royce Tay 670 also considered as an alternative. This was confirmed in January 1992, when Rolls-Royce and McDonnell Douglas signed a memorandum of understanding concerning the Tay-powered MD-95. McDonnell Douglas said that the MD-95 project would cost only a minimal amount to develop, as it was a direct offshoot of the IAE-powered MD-90.

During 1993, McDonnell Douglas seemed to be favoring a life extension program of the DC-9-30, under the program name DC-9X, to continue its presence in the 100-120 seat market, rather than concentrating on the new build MD-95. In its evaluation of the engine upgrades available for the DC-9X, McDonnell Douglas found the BMW Rolls-Royce BR700 engine to be the ideal candidate, and on February 23, 1994, the BR700 was selected as the sole powerplant for the airliner.

=== Production site ===
McDonnell Douglas was planning for MD-95 final assembly to be undertaken in China, as an offshoot of the Trunkliner program, for which McDonnell Douglas had been negotiating to have up to 150 MD-90s built in China. The MD-90 Trunkliner deal was finalized in June 1992, but the contract was for a total of 40 aircraft, including 20 MD-80Ts and 20 -90Ts. The MD-80 has been license built in Shanghai since the 1980s. However, in early 1993, MDC said that it was considering sites outside China, and was later seeking alternative locations for the assembly line. In 1994, McDonnell Douglas sought global partners to share development costs. It also began a search for a low-cost final assembly site. Halla Group in South Korea was selected to make the wings; Alenia of Italy the entire fuselage; Aerospace Industrial Development Corp. of Taiwan, the tail; ShinMaywa of Japan, the horizontal stabilizer; and a manufacturing division of Korean Air Lines, the nose and cockpit.

On November 8, 1994, McDonnell Douglas announced that final assembly would be taken away from the longtime Douglas plant at Long Beach Airport, California. Instead, it selected a modifications and maintenance operation, Dalfort Aviation in Dallas, Texas, to assemble the MD-95. In early 1995, management and unions in Long Beach reached an agreement to hold down wage costs for the life of the MD-95 program and McDonnell Douglas canceled the preliminary agreement with Dalfort.

=== Rebranding and marketing ===

After McDonnell Douglas was acquired by Boeing in August 1997, most industry observers expected that Boeing would cancel development of the MD-95. However, Boeing decided to go forward with the design under a new name, Boeing 717. While it appeared that Boeing had skipped the 717 model designation when the 720 and the 727 followed the 707, the 717 name was the company&#x27;s model number for the C-135 Stratolifter military transport and KC-135 Stratotanker tanker aircraft. 717 had also been used to promote an early design of the 720 to airlines before it was modified to meet market demands. A Boeing historian notes that the Air Force tanker was designated &quot;717-100&quot; and the commercial airliner designated &quot;717-200&quot;. The lack of a widespread use of the 717 name left it available for rebranding the MD-95.

At first, Boeing had no more success selling the 717 than McDonnell Douglas. Even the original order for 50 was no certainty in the chaotic post-deregulation United States airline market. Assembly started on the first 717 in May 1997. The aircraft had its roll out ceremony on June 10, 1998. The 717&#x27;s first flight took place on September 2, 1998. Following flight testing, the airliner was awarded a type certification on September 1, 1999. Its first delivery was in September 1999 to AirTran Airways, which Valujet was now called. Commercial service began the following month. Trans World Airlines (TWA) ordered 50 717s in 1998 with an option for 50 additional aircraft.

Boeing&#x27;s decision to go ahead with the 717 slowly began to pay off. Early 717 operators were delighted with the reliability and passenger appeal of the type and decided to order more. The small Australian regional airline Impulse took a long-term lease on five 717s in early 2000 to begin an expansion into mainline routes. The ambitious move could not be sustained in competition with the majors, and Impulse sold out to Qantas in May 2001.

Within a few months, the 717&#x27;s abilities became clear to Qantas, being faster than the BAe 146, and achieving a higher dispatch reliability, over 99%, than competing aircraft. Maintenance costs are low: according to AirTran Airways, a C check inspection, for example, takes three days and is required once every 4,500 flying hours. (For comparison, its predecessor, the DC-9 needed 21 days for a C check.) The new Rolls-Royce BR715 engine design is relatively easy to maintain. Many 717 operators, such as Qantas, became converts to the plane; Qantas bought more 717s to replace its BAe 146 fleet, and other orders came from Hawaiian Airlines and Midwest Airlines.

Boeing actively marketed the 717 to a number of large airlines, including Northwest Airlines, who already operated a large fleet of DC-9 aircraft, and Lufthansa. Boeing also studied a stretched, higher-capacity version of the 717, to have been called 717-300, but decided against proceeding with the new model, fearing that it would encroach on the company&#x27;s 737-700 model. Production of the original 717 continued. Boeing continued to believe that the 100-passenger market would be lucrative enough to support both the 717 and the 737-600, the smallest of the Next-Generation 737 series. While the aircraft were similar in overall size, the 737-600 was better suited to long-distance routes, while the lighter 717 was more efficient on shorter, regional routes.

=== Assembly line and end of production ===
In 2001, Boeing began implementing a moving assembly line for production of the 717 and 737. The moving line greatly reduced production time, which led to lower production costs. Following the slump in airline traffic caused by an economic downturn subsequent to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Boeing announced a review of the type&#x27;s future. After much deliberation, it was decided to continue with production. Despite the lack of orders, Boeing had confidence in the 717&#x27;s fundamental suitability to the 100-seat market, and in the long-term size of that market. After 19 worldwide 717 sales in 2000, and just 6 in 2001, Boeing took 32 orders for the 717 in 2002, despite the severe industry downturn. The 100th 717 was delivered to AirTran Airways on June 18, 2002.

Increased competition from regional jets manufactured by Bombardier and Embraer took a heavy toll on sales during the airline slump after 2001. American Airlines acquired TWA and initially planned to continue the 717 order. American Airlines canceled TWA&#x27;s order for Airbus A318s, but eventually also canceled the Boeing 717s that had not yet been delivered. The beginning of the end came in December 2003 when Boeing failed to reach a US$2.7 billion contract from Air Canada, a long term DC-9 customer, who chose the Embraer E-Jets and Bombardier CRJ200 over the 717. On January 14, 2005, citing slow sales, Boeing announced that it planned to end production of the 717 after it had met all of its outstanding orders.

The 156th and final 717 rolled off the assembly line in April 2006 for AirTran Airways, which was the 717&#x27;s launch customer as well as its final customer. The final two Boeing 717s were delivered to customers Midwest Airlines and AirTran Airways on May 23, 2006. The 717 was the last commercial airplane produced at Boeing&#x27;s Long Beach facility in Southern California.

=== Retirement ===
The first Boeing 717 aircraft built registered as N717XA was scrapped in 2005. TWA sold their aircraft to American Airlines after TWA went bankrupt in December 2001. American Airlines retired their 717s in 2003 and sold them to Air Tran Airways, Qantaslink and Bangkok Airways. Impulse Airlines sold their 717s to Qantaslink in 2004 after the airline ceased operations. Germanwings retired their 717s in 2005 only one year after receiving them. Jetstar retired their 717s in 2007 and sold them to Qantaslink. Bangkok Airways, Midwest Airlines and Olympic Airlines retired their 717s in 2009. Quantum Air retired their 717s after ceasing operations in January 2010. MexicanaClick went bankrupt in August 2010 and retired their 717s. Spanair retired their 717s in 2011. AirTran sold their 717s to Delta Air Lines after the company merged with Southwest in 2014 with the plane registered as N717JL making AirTran&#x27;s final flight from Atlanta to Tampa in December 2014. Turkmenistan Airlines retired their last 717 in July 2018 and was the last Asian operator of the 717. Volotea retired their last 717 in January 2021 and was the last European operator of the 717. QantasLink initially retired their last 717 in October 2024 with the aircraft registered as VH-YQS making its final flight from Sydney to Canberra. However, the aircraft registered VH-YQW returned to service in November 2024. VH-YQW made its final flight in December 2024 from Canberra to Brisbane as QF6216 marking the end of 717 operators outside of the US. Delta Air Lines and Hawaiian Airlines are planning to retire their 717s by the end of 2025 marking the end of the line for the 717.

== Design ==

The 717 features a two-crew glass cockpit that incorporates six interchangeable liquid-crystal-display units and advanced Honeywell VIA 2000 computers. The cockpit design is called Advanced Common Flightdeck (ACF) and is shared with the MD-10 and similar to the MD-11. Flight deck features include an Electronic Instrument System, a dual Flight Management System, a Central Fault Display System, and Global Positioning System. Category IIIb automatic landing capability for bad-weather operations and Future Air Navigation Systems are available. The 717 shares the same type rating as the DC-9, such that the FAA approved transition courses for DC-9 and analog MD-80 pilots could be completed in 11 days.

In conjunction with Parker Hannifin, MPC Products of Skokie, Illinois designed a fly-by-wire technology mechanical control suite for the 717 flight deck. The modules replaced much cumbersome rigging that had occurred in previous DC-9/MD-80 aircraft. The Rolls-Royce BR715 engines are completely controlled by an electronic engine system (Full Authority Digital Engine Control — FADEC) developed by BAE Systems, offering improved controllability and optimization. The engine claimed significantly lower fuel consumption compared to others then available with the equivalent amount of thrust.

Like its DC-9/MD-80/MD-90 predecessors, the 717 has a 2+3 seating arrangement in the main economy class, providing only one middle seat per row, whereas other single-aisle twin jets, such as the Boeing 737 family and the Airbus A320 family, often have 3+3 arrangement with two middle seats per row. Unlike its predecessors, McDonnell Douglas decided not to offer the MD-95/717 with the boarding flexibility of aft airstairs, with the goal of maximizing fuel efficiency through the reduction and simplification of as much auxiliary equipment as possible.

== Variants ==
;717-200
:Production variant powered by either two Rolls-Royce BR715A1-30 or BR715C1-30 engines with 134 passenger seat, 155 built.
;717 Business Express
: Proposed corporate version of 717-200, unveiled at the EBACE Convention in Geneva, Switzerland in May 2003. Configurable for 40 to 80 passengers in first and/or business class interior (typically, 60 passengers with seat pitch of . Maximum range in HGW configuration with auxiliary fuel and 60 passengers was . The version complements BBJ family.
;717-100 (-100X)
: Proposed 86-seat version, formerly MD-95-20; four frames () shorter. Renamed 717-100X; wind tunnel tests began in early 2000; revised mid-2000 to eight-frame () shrink. Launch decision was deferred in December 2000 and again thereafter to an undisclosed date. Shelved by mid-2003.
;717-100X Lite
: Proposed 75-seat version, powered by Rolls-Royce Deutschland BR710 turbofans; later abandoned.
;717-300X
:Proposed stretched version, formerly MD-95-50; studies suggest typical two-class seating for 130 passengers, with overall length increased to by addition of nine frames (five forward and four aft of wing); higher MTOW and space-limited payloads weights; additional service door aft of wing; and BR715C1-30 engines. AirTran expressed interest in converting some -200 options to this model. Was under consideration late 2003 by Star Alliance Group (Air Canada, Austrian Airlines, Lufthansa and SAS); interest was reported from Delta, Iberia and Northwest Airlines.

== Operators ==
, there are 99 Boeing 717s in service with Delta Air Lines (80) and Hawaiian Airlines (19) down from 148 aircraft in 2018.

Delta Air Lines is the largest operator of the 717, flying over 70 percent of all in-service jets as of 2024. In 2013, Delta began leasing the entire fleet of 88 jets previously operated by AirTran Airways from Southwest Airlines, who had purchased AirTran, but wanted to preserve its all-Boeing 737 fleet rather than taking on another class of aircraft. For Delta, used Boeing 717 and MD-90s allowed them to retire their DC-9s while also being cheaper to acquire than buying brand-new jets from Airbus or Boeing. Unlike other mainline US legacy carriers, Delta has decided that its best path to profitability is a strategy that utilizes older aircraft, and Delta has created a very extensive MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) organization, called TechOps, to support them.

In 2015, Blue1 announced it would sell its 717 fleet, with five jets going to Delta and four going to the then third largest operator of the type, Volotea, a Spanish low-cost carrier. In January 2021, Volotea then retired their last of formerly 19 Boeing 717s. It was the last remaining European operator of the type.

=== Orders and deliveries ===


== Accidents and incidents ==
, the Boeing 717 has been involved in six aviation accidents and incidents but with no hull-losses and no fatalities. The major incidents included one on-ground collision while taxiing, an emergency landing where the nose landing gear did not extend, and one attempted hijacking.

<doc id="152438" wikidata="Q462380" url="?curid=152438" title="Queensrÿche">
<text>Queensrÿche () is an American progressive metal band. It formed in 1982 in Bellevue, Washington, out of the local band the Mob. The band has released 16 studio albums, one EP, and several DVDs, and continues to tour and record. The original lineup consisted of guitarists Michael Wilton and Chris DeGarmo, drummer Scott Rockenfield, bassist Eddie Jackson, and lead vocalist Geoff Tate.

Queensrÿche has sold over 20 million albums worldwide, including over six million albums in the United States. They are considered one of the leaders of the progressive metal scene of the mid-to-late 1980s, and often referred to as one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; of the genre, along with Dream Theater and Fates Warning. The band received worldwide acclaim after the release of their 1988 album &quot;&quot;, which is often considered one of the greatest heavy metal concept albums of all time. Their next album, &quot;Empire&quot; (1990), was also very successful and included the hit single &quot;Silent Lucidity&quot;. The band has received three Grammy Award nominations for songs from both albums. In 1998, drummer Rockenfield received an individual Grammy nomination.

Also in 1998, DeGarmo left the band for personal reasons, returning briefly to write and record their eighth studio album &quot;Tribe&quot; (2003). Over the years, his replacements have been Kelly Gray, Mike Stone, and Parker Lundgren. 

Following a highly publicized backstage altercation before a show in São Paulo, Brazil, in April 2012, Tate was fired from the band and replaced with then-Crimson Glory singer Todd La Torre. In response to his dismissal, Tate and his wife Susan (who served as the band&#x27;s manager from 2005 to 2012) filed a lawsuit in a Washington court, claiming that he was wrongfully terminated. The ruling in the preliminary injunction was that both parties were allowed to use the name Queensrÿche until a court ruling or a settlement decided who would get to use the name. A settlement was reached on April 17, 2014, in which founding members Wilton, Rockenfield and Jackson were awarded the rights to the band trademark, continuing to perform with the lineup that additionally includes lead vocalist La Torre and guitarist Lundgren.

During the time both parties could use the name Queensrÿche, Tate created his own lineup featuring former rhythm guitarist Gray and musicians from bands including Blue Öyster Cult, Ozzy Osbourne, Whitesnake, Dio, AC/DC and Quiet Riot. This version of Queensrÿche with Geoff Tate released the album &quot;Frequency Unknown&quot; on April 23, 2013, while Queensrÿche (with La Torre replacing Tate) released their eponymous album on June 24 and 25, 2013 (European and American release date, respectively). Both bands toured in 2013 and 2014, after which Tate changed the name of his version of Queensrÿche to . The La Torre-fronted Queensrÿche has since recorded three more albums with him: &quot;Condition Hüman&quot; (2015), &quot;The Verdict&quot; (2019) and their newest release &quot;Digital Noise Alliance&quot; (2022).

==History==
===1980–1983: From the Mob to Queensrÿche===
The foundations for Queensrÿche began in the late 1970s. guitarist Michael Wilton started the band Joker with friends in 1978, and they were joined by guitarist Chris DeGarmo in 1979. In 1980, Wilton met drummer Scott Rockenfield at Easy Street Records in Seattle, and they formed the band Cross+Fire together on July 18 that year. They covered songs from popular heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, and practiced in the garage of Rockenfield&#x27;s parents which they called &quot;The Dungeon&quot; and fitted with egg cartons as acoustic cladding. Before long, DeGarmo and bassist Eddie Jackson joined Cross+Fire, and the band name was changed to the Mob, after the Black Sabbath song &quot;The Mob Rules&quot;. In need of a singer for a one-off performance at a local rock festival, they recruited Babylon frontman Geoff Tate. After Babylon broke up, Tate performed a few shows with the Mob, but left because he was not interested in performing heavy metal covers.

In 1981, the Mob put together sufficient funds to record a demo tape. Still without a singer, Tate was once again enlisted to help, much to the disapproval of his then-current band, Myth. The group recorded the four songs &quot;Queen of the Reich&quot;, &quot;Nightrider&quot;, &quot;Blinded&quot;, and &quot;The Lady Wore Black&quot;, the latter of which Tate had written the lyrics for. For an entire year, they brought their demo to various labels and were rejected by all of them. The Mob were ultimately offered a management contract by Kim and Diana Harris, the owners of Easy Street Records. However, as Tate remained committed to staying in Myth, the band reluctantly searched for another singer.

Because the name &quot;the Mob&quot; was not available, their manager urged them to choose a different name. They reportedly ran out of ideas, and decided to name the band after the first song on their demo tape, &quot;Queen of the Reich&quot;. The spelling &quot;Queensreich&quot; was modified to prevent association of the band with Nazism; &quot;ryche&quot; is a Middle English cognate to &quot;Reich&quot; which, like the German word, can mean &quot;realm&quot;, &quot;kingdom&quot; or &quot;empire&quot;. The name &quot;Queensrÿche&quot; is written with a metal umlaut over the letter &quot;y&quot;. As the band later joked: &quot;The umlaut over the &#x27;y&#x27; has haunted us for years. We spent eleven years trying to explain how to pronounce it.&quot; The umlaut is used on all of Queensrÿche&#x27;s releases, except for their 2011 album, &quot;Dedicated to Chaos&quot;.

===1983–1987: &quot;The Warning&quot; and &quot;Rage for Order&quot;===
Kim Harris sent the demo tape and a band photo to a friend who wrote for &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine, resulting in a glowing review. On the strength of the growing buzz that surrounded them in both the United States and Europe following this review, the Harrises released Queensrÿche&#x27;s demo tape as a self-titled EP on their independent label 206 Records in 1983. After the EP garnered international praise, receiving much airplay and selling an unusual number of copies for a small independent release, Tate agreed to leave Myth and become Queensrÿche&#x27;s permanent lead singer.

On June 29 and 30, 1983, Queensrÿche was the opening act for Zebra in Portland and Seattle respectively. Kim Harris knew A&amp;R manager Mavis Brodey of EMI-America from the time she was the music director of KZOK-FM, and he convinced her to come to one of these shows. Brodey offered Queensrÿche a contract with EMI, spanning 15 years and encompassing seven albums. EMI re-released the EP &quot;Queensrÿche&quot; to moderate success, peaking at No. 81 on the Billboard charts. The band toured with Quiet Riot through the South and with Twisted Sister to the East Coast and Canada, and opened for Dio in Seattle.

After the EP tour, Queensrÿche travelled to London to record their first full-length album. The band worked with producer James Guthrie, who had worked with Pink Floyd and Judas Priest. Released in September 1984, &quot;The Warning&quot; showed the band in an early stage of development, playing classic heavy metal songs. It peaked at No. 61 on the Billboard album chart, a moderate commercial success. While none of the singles released from &quot;The Warning&quot; charted domestically, &quot;Take Hold of the Flame&quot; was a hit for the band outside the U.S., and particularly in Japan. The band&#x27;s first full-scale U.S. tour (in support of this album) was as the opening act for Kiss on their &quot;Animalize&quot; tour and Iron Maiden on their &quot;Powerslave&quot; tour. They also opened for Dio and Accept on their tours for &quot;The Last in Line&quot; and &quot;Metal Heart&quot; respectively.

&quot;Rage for Order&quot;, released in 1986, introduced a much more polished look and sound for Queensrÿche, while the band was pressured by their management to adopt an image more closely associated with glam metal. Tate later described the period as &quot;we were really into [that] image and we failed miserably.&quot; However, the album itself was slightly more progressive than the band&#x27;s previous releases, having a layered and complex musical structure, and featuring keyboards as prominently as guitars. A video was filmed for the song &quot;Gonna Get Close to You&quot;, written and originally recorded in 1984 by Dalbello. The song &quot;Rage for Order&quot; was written and demoed for the album, but it was not included on the final release. The main riff from this song was worked into an instrumental piece played during some shows on the tour in support of this album, and eventually morphed into the track &quot;Anarchy-X&quot; on their next album. Queensrÿche supported &quot;Rage for Order&quot; with a tour that included opening for AC/DC, Bon Jovi, Ozzy Osbourne and Ratt, and playing with other bands such as Black &#x27;n Blue, Fates Warning, Gang Green, Keel and Raven.

===1988–1993: &quot;Operation: Mindcrime&quot;, &quot;Empire&quot;, and mainstream success===
In 1988, Queensrÿche released &quot;&quot;, a narrative concept album that proved a massive critical and commercial success. The album&#x27;s story revolved around a junkie named Nikki, who is brainwashed into performing assassinations for an underground movement. Nikki is torn over his misplaced loyalty to the cause and his love for Mary, a reformed hooker-turned-nun (vocals by Pamela Moore), who gets in the way. The band&#x27;s progressive metal style was fully developed on this album. The band toured through much of 1988 and 1989 with several bands, including Def Leppard, Guns N&#x27; Roses and Metallica. The album gained critical acclaim and achieved gold status, while its singles &quot;Eyes of a Stranger&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Believe in Love&quot; gave Queensrÿche their first charting hits in America.

The release of &quot;Empire&quot; (1990) brought Queensrÿche to the height of their commercial popularity. It peaked at No. 7 and sold more than three million copies in the United States, more than their previous four releases combined (it was also certified silver in the UK). The power ballad &quot;Silent Lucidity&quot;, which featured an orchestra, became the band&#x27;s first Top 10 single. The arrangements on &quot;Empire&quot; were more straightforward than the band&#x27;s previous efforts.

The subsequent &quot;Building Empires&quot; tour was the first full-fledged tour to feature Queensrÿche as a headlining act (the band had previously headlined a tour in Japan in support of &quot;Operation: Mindcrime&quot;, and had headlined a handful of club and theater shows in the U.S. between 1984 and 1988, and the UK in 1988). The group used its headlining status to perform &quot;Operation: Mindcrime&quot; in its entirety, as well as songs from &quot;Empire&quot;. The tour lasted 18 months, longer than any tour the band had undertaken before or has since. The tour also added a black page to the band&#x27;s history, when during a show in a sports hall in Ichtegem, Belgium on November 20, 1990, a scuffle in the audience resulted in an American fan stabbing a Belgian fan fatally in the chest. Tour manager Howard Ungerleider immediately stopped the show as the band was only playing the seventh song on the set list, &quot;Roads to Madness&quot;. A live album, recorded May 10–12, 1991, was released later that year as &quot;&quot;. The tour also included an MTV Unplugged appearance at Warner Hollywood Studios in Los Angeles on April 27, 1992.

===1994–1997: &quot;Promised Land&quot;, &quot;Hear in the Now Frontier&quot;, and DeGarmo&#x27;s departure===
After taking time off to deal with the burnout resulting from the &quot;Building Empires&quot; tour and with other personal issues, the band released &quot;Promised Land&quot; in October 1994 (a companion CD-ROM, featuring a &quot;Promised Land&quot;-themed game and other interactive features, was released in March 1996). It was a dark and intensely personal album, reflecting the mental state of the band at the time. Although the album debuted at No. 3 and was eventually certified platinum, it was clearly not the commercial success &quot;Empire&quot; had been. As with many other heavy metal and hard rock acts, Queensrÿche&#x27;s commercial fortunes waned with the surge in popularity of genres such as alternative rock and grunge.

Queensrÿche released their sixth full-length studio album, &quot;Hear in the Now Frontier&quot;, in March 1997, to mixed critical and fan reception. The album debuted at No. 19 but quickly vanished from the charts. Toby Wright, who produced Alice in Chains’ self-titled 1995 album, was brought on board for this effort as engineer. The result was a sound that is more dry and stripped down than anything the band had ever released. The wall of guitar, drums, and vocals that had become synonymous with Queensrÿche was gone, replaced by a much more immediate and less powerful style.

Compounding the disappointing sales of the album were issues that plagued the band on the subsequent tour. Less than one month into the &quot;Hear in the Now Frontier&quot; tour, Tate became seriously ill and the band was forced to cancel concert dates for the first time. In an even bigger blow, the band&#x27;s longtime label, EMI America Records, went bankrupt during the same period. Queensrÿche was forced to use its own money to finance the remaining two months of the tour. The band played a handful of December shows in South America because of contractual obligations, and it was during this time, late 1997, that founding member Chris DeGarmo announced he was leaving Queensrÿche. However, his departure was not announced to the public until January 24, 1998. Members of the band have later cited burnout and a desire to pursue interests outside of Queensrÿche as reasons for his departure. For example, Rockenfield has said: &quot;He wanted to pursue other things. He felt like he had done what he wanted musically in his life, and wanted to move on.&quot; After leaving Queensrÿche, DeGarmo began a full-time career as a professional business jet pilot. His involvement with music has since been sporadic. He remains highly regarded in the eyes of Queensrÿche&#x27;s fan base.

===1997–2004: &quot;Q2K&quot;, side projects, and &quot;Tribe&quot;===
DeGarmo was replaced by producer Kelly Gray on rhythm guitar. Gray&#x27;s connections with Queensrÿche went back to the early &#x27;80s, when he was the guitarist for Myth, which was also the band Tate fronted prior to joining Queensrÿche. Gray had previously worked as a producer for bands such as Dokken and Candlebox. Queensrÿche recorded one studio album with Gray, &quot;Q2K&quot; from 1999, which was also the first album for their new label, Atlantic Records. Musically, &quot;Q2K&quot; bore little resemblance to the progressive metal of the band&#x27;s past, and also displayed a similar stripped-down sound as &quot;Hear in the Now Frontier&quot;. Tate has described &quot;Q2K&quot; as a continuation of the experimentation of &quot;Hear in the Now Frontier&quot;. Declining popularity forced the band to tour in clubs and theaters, rather than in the larger arenas and outdoor amphitheaters where they played before. Following the &quot;Q2K&quot; tour, Rockenfield and Gray formed the side project Slave to the System with band members from Brother Cane and recorded a self-titled album.

After the release of a greatest hits collection in 2000, Queensrÿche embarked on another tour, this time in support of Iron Maiden. This enabled the band to play Madison Square Garden for the first time. Unhappy with the lack of support they felt they received from Atlantic Records, Queensrÿche moved to Sanctuary Records in 2001. In July of that year, the band performed a handful of dates at the Moore Theatre in Seattle, Washington. The shows were recorded and released in September 2001 as &quot;Live Evolution&quot;, the band&#x27;s second live album. In 2001 and 2002, Tate worked on his self-titled first solo album, which was released on June 25, 2002.

Gray was fired from the band in May 2002, which according to Rockenfield was &quot;because of [his] personal abuse habits and ongoing problems&quot;.

The band entered the studio as a quartet in the spring of 2003 to record their eighth full-length album, while a compilation of greatest hits was released as part of the Classic Masters series on March 9, 2003. In April, they announced they had been joined by Chris DeGarmo, although his future status with the band was uncertain. In July, Queensrÿche released its first and only album of new material on the Sanctuary label, &quot;Tribe&quot;. DeGarmo, who played on and co-wrote four songs, neither officially rejoined the band nor took part in the supporting tour.

Queensrÿche found a replacement for Gray in Mike Stone, who had previously worked on Tate&#x27;s solo album. Stone accompanied the band on the &quot;Tribe&quot; tour as second guitarist to Wilton&#x27;s lead, though he never was a full member of the band. In June 2003, Queensrÿche launched a co-headlining tour featuring another progressive metal band, Dream Theater. The two bands alternated the opening and closing slots, and ended the shows by playing a handful of songs together. Fates Warning was the special guest for the tour. A recording from this tour was released to CD and DVD as &quot;The Art of Live&quot;, which included two covers performed with Dream Theater.

Over the course of the five album releases (&#x27;Q2K&#x27;, &#x27;Tribe&#x27;, &#x27;Operation: Mindcrime II&#x27;, &#x27;American Soldier&#x27; and &#x27;Dedicated To Chaos&#x27;) after DeGarmo left, the band had gone through three rhythm guitarists, five record companies and four management firms. Q-Prime had taken over management duties before &#x27;Operation: Mindcrime&#x27;; they were eventually replaced by Ray Daniels during the &#x27;Q2K&#x27; sessions, who was then subsequently replaced by Lars Sorensen. Following the &quot;Tribe&quot; tour, Lars Sorensen was dismissed, and Geoff Tate&#x27;s wife Susan was promoted to band manager, after having worked as an assistant manager for the band since 2001. In this period, Wilton spent time recording the self-titled album of his side project Soulbender.

===2004–2007: &quot;Operation: Mindcrime II&quot;===
In July 2004, Queensrÿche announced its plans to record a follow-up to 1988&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. To generate fan interest in the upcoming album, the band hit the road in the fall of 2004 with the &quot;An Evening With Queensrÿche&quot; tour. The tour opened with a shortened greatest hits set, followed by a revised production of &quot;Operation: Mindcrime&quot; with live actors and video; Pamela Moore reprised her role as Sister Mary. The band played a pre-recorded version of &quot;Hostage,&quot; a track from the upcoming album, through the PA as an encore after the end of their set. The second leg of the tour began in early 2005. Before embarking on a third leg in the fall of 2005, Queensrÿche toured with Judas Priest across North America, playing an hour-long set consisting mostly of the band&#x27;s older works and one song from the soon-to-be released sequel, entitled &quot;I&#x27;m American&quot;.

&quot;&quot; was released internationally on March 31, 2006. The album was Queensrÿche&#x27;s first for their new label, Rhino Entertainment, to which it signed in 2005. Ronnie James Dio provided the vocals for Dr. X, the villain. The album debuted at No. 14, the highest chart position for a Queensrÿche album since 1997. The group embarked on a headlining tour in support of the album, joined by Pamela Moore in her role as Sister Mary. The tour featured performances of both &quot;Mindcrime&quot; albums in their entirety. Dio appeared at the Gibson Amphitheatre show in Universal City, California to perform his vocals as Dr. X on &quot;The Chase&quot;, and was shown on a video screen at the other shows. Dio&#x27;s appearance was recorded, and included as an extra on the 2007 DVD release &quot;Mindcrime at the Moore&quot;.

===2007–2010: &quot;Take Cover&quot; and &quot;American Soldier&quot;===

On August 9, 2007, the band announced that it would release a new greatest hits album, entitled &quot;Sign of the Times&quot;. The album was released on August 28, 2007, and a special collector&#x27;s edition featured a bonus disc including various demos and a new song, &quot;Justified&quot;, featuring Chris DeGarmo on guitar. On November 13, 2007, the band released an album of covers entitled &quot;Take Cover&quot;. The album contains covers of songs by Queen, U2, The Police, Black Sabbath, Peter Gabriel, and Pink Floyd, and was the band&#x27;s second release for Rhino Records. On February 3, 2009, Stone announced the end of his association with Queensrÿche to focus on his side project Speed-X, although court declarations later revealed Geoff and Susan Tate fired him for &quot;making too many grand demands&quot;, without discussing their decision with the other band members.

Wilton recorded both lead and rhythm guitar on the band&#x27;s eleventh studio album, &quot;American Soldier&quot;, released on March 31, 2009. The concept album regards war from the perspective of those on the front lines of American wars from World War II through to the present, especially the Iraq War. Parker Lundgren (formerly of The Nihilists and Sledgeback, who also played on Tate&#x27;s solo tour and was in a relationship with Tate&#x27;s stepdaughter Miranda) replaced Stone on the ensuing tour.

===2010–2012: &quot;Dedicated to Chaos&quot;===
In late 2009 and early 2010, the band toured for The Queensrÿche Cabaret. In November 2010, Queensrÿche played several shows for U.S. troops stationed in Iraq. While at a U.S. military position, explosive shells began falling on the base as the result of a bomb attack. Contrary to some news reports stating that some band members were injured, Tate has said in several interviews that he was misquoted and none of the band members suffered any injuries.

The band&#x27;s twelfth studio album, &quot;Dedicated to Chaos&quot;, was released on June 28, 2011 on Roadrunner/Loud &amp; Proud Records, to which the band had signed on August 25, 2010. The album was a drastic departure from the band&#x27;s previous efforts, featuring a greater emphasis on the bass and drums, and with minimal guitar work. The album was released to mixed reviews and was the lowest charting full-length album for the band in its history.

According to Tate, Queensrÿche was already writing new material for a follow-up to &quot;Dedicated to Chaos&quot; as of June 2011, and were discussing re-recording &quot;Operation: Mindcrime&quot; in late 2012, so they could do something special for a 25th anniversary edition.

===2012–2014: Rising West, confrontation, split and lawsuit with Geoff Tate===

In a band meeting on April 12, 2012, which Tate did not attend, the band fired both Tate&#x27;s stepdaughter Miranda, from running the fan club, and his wife Susan, their band manager since 2005. According to Wilton, the reasons were that &quot;the last 3 years, basically it just came to a point that we didn&#x27;t have a voice in the band anymore. It was all run by the singer and his manager, the wife.&quot; On April 14, 2012, before the soundcheck for a show in São Paulo, Brazil, Tate had an argument with the other members about the firing of his family. This confrontation became heated, leading to Tate retaliating by knocking down the drum kit, throwing several punches and physically assaulting and spitting on Rockenfield and Wilton. Over the course of the band&#x27;s next three shows, Wilton, Rockenfield, and Jackson felt that Tate continued to misbehave and they came &quot;to the conclusion that they can no longer work or perform with Mr. Tate.&quot; They called a band meeting on June 5 (some sources say June 6). Tate withdrew from this conference call, after which the other band members voted to &quot;consider Geoff Tate expelled from the band&quot; and &quot;continue to use the Queensrÿche name with a new lead singer&quot;, prompting Tate to take legal action.

While Tate continued working on an upcoming solo album, &quot;Kings &amp; Thieves&quot;, and a subsequent tour, Queensrÿche&#x27;s other band members started the side project that eventually became Rising West. Wilton explained that: &quot;Originally this was deemed as a side project, because we were told by our management that we were not going to do anything for the next year so hey, we have to survive.&quot; Still in search of a frontman for the at-the-time unnamed project, Wilton recommended Todd La Torre to his bandmates, the then-frontman of Crimson Glory, whom he had met several months prior at the NAMM Show in January 2012. Their encounter had resulted in a songwriting collaboration on, among others, a song named &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;, which in 2013 would make its way onto Queensrÿche&#x27;s self-titled album. The band heard some of La Torre&#x27;s demos on YouTube, and took a leap of faith by booking and announcing two shows at Seattle&#x27;s Hard Rock Cafe on June 8 and 9, 2012, even before La Torre met the band members. The project would initially be called &quot;West&quot;, which stood for the four members of the band: &quot;Wilton, Eddie, Scott and Todd&quot;, but was later renamed &quot;Rising West&quot; at the suggestion of Jackson. The band was enthusiastic about this addition to the original name, because &quot;Rising West&quot; reflected the feeling that the project was &quot;something really fresh&quot; for everyone involved; it additionally referred to the band members living on the West Coast, flowed better as a band name than simply &quot;West&quot;, and [in deemphasizing the WEST acronym] acknowledged that Parker Lundgren [whose name was not included in the acronym] would also be participating in the project. The shows were publicly announced on May 29, 2012, revealing that they would focus on Queensrÿche&#x27;s older work. Both shows sold out in 48 hours, among others to fans from Japan, Australia and New Zealand. When the band flew La Torre in from Florida to Seattle nine days before the show to rehearse at Rockenfield&#x27;s house, they hadn&#x27;t played a note together, nor did they know whether it would work. Although La Torre was a big fan of Queensrÿche&#x27;s older albums, he was not very familiar with the songs on &quot;Promised Land&quot; and they had only limited time to prepare for the shows; the band focused on the material from the &quot;Queensrÿche&quot; EP to the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Empire&quot;, which are generally considered the band&#x27;s heaviest releases, and according to La Torre: &quot;are the songs and the time period that most represented the core sound of what Queensryche material was about&quot;. Their first rehearsal together went very smoothly, according to Wilton: &quot;we blasted through 18 to 20 songs and everybody was amazed from the professionality, the musicianship and tone of Todd&#x27;s voice.&quot; Rockenfield was immediately reassured: &quot;the second we played &quot;Queen of the Reich&quot;, it was all over.&quot; Even after the enthusiastic response during these initial shows, the fledgling band still remained unsigned in the days that immediately followed. They already had been approached by Glen Parrish of PGM Management after their show on June 9, 2012, who offered to become their band manager. According to Wilton, Parrish had told the management company in Los Angeles: &quot;I have something very hot here and we should grab these guys before someone else does&quot;. After band negotiations with &quot;at least 3 or 4 record labels&quot;, Parrish chose to sign Queensrÿche with Century Media. 
Meanwhile, Tate, along with his wife, moved forward with the lawsuit they had filed against his former bandmates, claiming unlawful termination and seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent both himself and the remaining bandmembers from using the Queensrÿche name until the issue was resolved. While the Washington state superior court denied this motion on July 13, 2012, they also denied a counter-motion for a preliminary summary judgment filed by the defense (Wilton, Jackson, and Rockenfield); collectively, these rulings enabled both parties to use the brand &quot;Queensrÿche&quot; until a court ruling or settlement further clarified the matter. Subsequent to this temporary verdict, both entities toured with independent bands under the &quot;Queensrÿche&quot; moniker between June 2012 and April 2014, with one incarnation consisting of the remaining Queensrÿche members fronted by La Torre, and the other featuring Tate with his own lineup. In addition, both versions of the group released studio albums during this time, with Geoff Tate&#x27;s incarnation releasing &quot;Frequency Unknown&quot; in April 2013, and the La Torre-fronted lineup releasing a self-titled album two months later.

A settlement was reached on April 17, 2014, and a statement from both parties was released on April 28, 2014. The statement announced that Tate lost the brand Queensrÿche to Rockenfield, Wilton and Jackson, who together with La Torre and Lundgren are to be &quot;the sole band recording and touring as Queensrÿche&quot;, while former vocalist Tate solely has the right to play &quot;Operation: Mindcrime&quot; and &quot;Operation: Mindcrime II&quot; in their entirety &quot;in unique performances&quot;. On May 5, 2014, a press release was released through Wilton&#x27;s Facebook page, further clarifying the specifics of the settlement.

===2014–2017: &quot;Condition Hüman&quot;===
On November 7, 2014, the band opened a pledge drive through PledgeMusic that allowed fans to pre-order their next album, which would be their second with La Torre and their 14th overall. The campaign used the motto &quot;Building The Empire&quot;, and offered regular pledge rewards such as CDs, exclusive access and equipment, but also an investment opportunity for $50,000 in Queensrÿche Holdings, LLC to accredited investors. The campaign page revealed that recording would likely take place between December 1, 2014 and February 28, 2015, and that the album was expected to be ready for release in late spring or early summer 2015. The campaign page also included a video of band members and crew discussing the band&#x27;s desire to approach their fans more proactively, with their attorney Thomas Osinski remarking: &quot;this is famously a band that kept to itself, and in this new era of openness, they want to join with their fans [and] more so after the last few years of challenges they&#x27;ve been through&quot;. The term &quot;Building Empires&quot; was used previously in the &quot;Empire&quot; tour, as well as a video from that tour, although in this context it is used to indicate that the fans are helping to rebuild the band&#x27;s career.

In a January 2015 interview, lead vocalist Todd La Torre revealed that in February they would &quot;hopefully&quot; start tracking their next album. Three months later, guitarist Michael Wilton spoke to interviewer Jennifer Kessinger at the 2015 Welcome to Rockville Festival about the songwriting progress of the album, which was being recorded at the Uberbeatz studio in Washington with producer Zeuss. Wilton said that &quot;it is everything that a fan of Queensrÿche would want from the band&quot; and stated that in more recent concerts and festivals, fans had expressed their satisfaction with the band&#x27;s current line up. Wilton revealed in a later interview that they had finished recording the album, and it was in the process of being mixed and mastered before being sent off to their record label Century Media Records. However, he did not reveal a title or release date.

On July 17, 2015, the band announced that a clip of a new song titled &quot;Arrow of Time&quot; would be released to fans who participated in their PledgeMusic campaign. The song was the opening track of the new album, titled &quot;Condition Hüman&quot;. On August 3, the album&#x27;s track list and artwork were revealed. Todd La Torre stated that &quot;The artwork depicts a beautiful innocence surrounded by the darkness of a jaded unpredictable world.&quot; The new album was released on October 2, 2015.

In the weeks leading up to the release of &quot;Condition Hüman&quot; the band toured North America with German hard rock veterans Scorpions. After the new album&#x27;s release, the band embarked on a tour of the United States in early 2016, and a European tour in September of that year. In October 2016, the band performed in Australia and the Far East. On March 28, 2017, the band announced Rockenfield would take paternity leave to care for his newborn son, and that Kamelot drummer Casey Grillo would fill in his spot for upcoming live dates, Rockenfield has not returned to the band and has filed a lawsuit alleging breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and wrongful discharge. In August 2018, guitarist Mike Stone returned for a couple of months filling in for Parker Lundgren who had to take care of &quot;personal things&quot;.

===2017–present: &quot;The Verdict&quot;, &quot;Digital Noise Alliance&quot; and next album===
On May 1, 2017, Todd La Torre revealed plans for the band&#x27;s next studio album. He said that approximately 15 songs were ready at that point and that they could be characterized by a faster tempo than those on the previous album. The band hoped to enter the studio in September 2017, for an early 2018 release via Century Media. In July 2018, in a Facebook post offering the forthcoming album for early orders, the band announced that the album would be released in 2019. On October 29, 2018, the band revealed that the album was entitled &quot;The Verdict&quot; and released it on March 1, 2019. According to Blabbermouth.net, Todd La Torre was confirmed as playing drums on the album. In November 2019, Wilton stated that he wanted touring drummer Grillo to play on the next Queensryche album.

In July 2021, Parker Lundgren announced he had left the band to pursue &quot;other business ventures&quot;. Mike Stone filled in for the subsequent tour, and later rejoined as a full-time member.

In January 2022, Queensrÿche confirmed they had entered the studio with Zeuss reprising his role as producer, and begun recording their sixteenth studio album, with a tentative late 2022 release date. Grillo confirmed that he was going to play drums on the album. On May 20, 2022, the band announced that the album was titled &quot;Digital Noise Alliance&quot; and that it will be released on October 7. The album was received well in Europe, reaching the Top 20 in Germany and Switzerland as well as the Top 40 in the Netherlands. In the US, however, it became their first album to miss the charts entirely.

Guitarist Michael Wilton has stated that the band has been demoing new material while on the road, and is hoping to enter the studio to record the follow-up to &quot;Digital Noise Alliance&quot; sometime in 2025.

==Tri-Ryche logo==
Queensrÿche&#x27;s logo, the so-called Tri-Ryche (written without an umlaut on the &#x27;y&#x27;), also stems from the band&#x27;s early years. Artist Wes &quot;Grizz&quot; Griswold, who made the artwork for the &quot;Queensrÿche&quot; EP, used to sign his work with a doodle morphed from a crude drawing of a peregrine falcon. He also used it for the stage set and backdrop of Queensrÿche&#x27;s first tour, which he designed. After the band was signed, the record company adopted the doodle as the band&#x27;s logo. However, the Tri-Ryche has never been trademarked by Queensrÿche due to a long-standing controversy over who actually created the Tri-Ryche. Todd Rockenfield, the brother of Queensrÿche&#x27;s drummer, who designed the typeface of the word &quot;Queensryche&quot; on the front and back of the EP, claimed the design of the Tri-Ryche in its eventual form was his, and the band acknowledges his role in the development of the Tri-Ryche. The Tri-Ryche is prominently featured on most of Queensrÿche&#x27;s album covers.

==Musical style==
Queensrÿche is most commonly described as progressive metal and heavy metal. According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, &quot;Queensrÿche constructed a progressive form of heavy metal that drew equally from the guitar pyrotechnics of post-Van Halen metal and &#x27;70s art rock, most notably Pink Floyd and Queen.

<text>In astrophysics, stellar nucleosynthesis is the creation of chemical elements by nuclear fusion reactions within stars. Stellar nucleosynthesis has occurred since the original creation of hydrogen, helium and lithium during the Big Bang. As a predictive theory, it yields accurate estimates of the observed abundances of the elements. It explains why the observed abundances of elements change over time and why some elements and their isotopes are much more abundant than others. The theory was initially proposed by Fred Hoyle in 1946, who later refined it in 1954. Further advances were made, especially to nucleosynthesis by neutron capture of the elements heavier than iron, by Margaret and Geoffrey Burbidge, William Alfred Fowler and Fred Hoyle in their famous 1957 B2FH paper, which became one of the most heavily cited papers in astrophysics history.

Stars evolve because of changes in their composition (the abundance of their constituent elements) over their lifespans, first by burning hydrogen (main sequence star), then helium (horizontal branch star), and progressively burning higher elements. However, this does not by itself significantly alter the abundances of elements in the universe as the elements are contained within the star. Later in its life, a low-mass star will slowly eject its atmosphere via stellar wind, forming a planetary nebula, while a higher–mass star will eject mass via a sudden catastrophic event called a supernova. The term supernova nucleosynthesis is used to describe the creation of elements during the explosion of a massive star or white dwarf.

The advanced sequence of burning fuels is driven by gravitational collapse and its associated heating, resulting in the subsequent burning of carbon, oxygen and silicon. However, most of the nucleosynthesis in the mass range (from silicon to nickel) is actually caused by the upper layers of the star collapsing onto the core, creating a compressional shock wave rebounding outward. The shock front briefly raises temperatures by roughly 50%, thereby causing furious burning for about a second. This final burning in massive stars, called &quot;explosive nucleosynthesis&quot; or supernova nucleosynthesis, is the final epoch of stellar nucleosynthesis.

A stimulus to the development of the theory of nucleosynthesis was the discovery of variations in the abundances of elements found in the universe. The need for a physical description was already inspired by the relative abundances of the chemical elements in the solar system. Those abundances, when plotted on a graph as a function of the atomic number of the element, have a jagged sawtooth shape that varies by factors of tens of millions (see history of nucleosynthesis theory). This suggested a natural process that is not random. A second stimulus to understanding the processes of stellar nucleosynthesis occurred during the 20th century, when it was realized that the energy released from nuclear fusion reactions accounted for the longevity of the Sun as a source of heat and light.

==History==

In 1920, Arthur Eddington, on the basis of the precise measurements of atomic masses by F.W. Aston and a preliminary suggestion by Jean Perrin, proposed that stars obtained their energy from nuclear fusion of hydrogen to form helium and raised the possibility that the heavier elements are produced in stars. This was a preliminary step toward the idea of stellar nucleosynthesis. In 1928 George Gamow derived what is now called the Gamow factor, a quantum-mechanical formula yielding the probability for two contiguous nuclei to overcome the electrostatic Coulomb barrier between them and approach each other closely enough to undergo nuclear reaction due to the strong nuclear force which is effective only at very short distances. In the following decade the Gamow factor was used by Atkinson and Houtermans and later by Edward Teller and Gamow himself to derive the rate at which nuclear reactions would occur at the high temperatures believed to exist in stellar interiors.

In 1939, in a Nobel lecture entitled &quot;Energy Production in Stars&quot;, Hans Bethe analyzed the different possibilities for reactions by which hydrogen is fused into helium. He defined two processes that he believed to be the sources of energy in stars. The first one, the proton–proton chain reaction, is the dominant energy source in stars with masses up to about the mass of the Sun. The second process, the carbon–nitrogen–oxygen cycle, which was also considered by Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker in 1938, is more important in more massive main-sequence stars. These works concerned the energy generation capable of keeping stars hot. A clear physical description of the proton–proton chain and of the CNO cycle appears in a 1968 textbook. Bethe&#x27;s two papers did not address the creation of heavier nuclei, however. That theory was begun by Fred Hoyle in 1946 with his argument that a collection of very hot nuclei would assemble thermodynamically into iron. Hoyle followed that in 1954 with a paper describing how advanced fusion stages within massive stars would synthesize the elements from carbon to iron in mass.

Hoyle&#x27;s theory was extended to other processes, beginning with the publication of the 1957 review paper &quot;Synthesis of the Elements in Stars&quot; by Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler and Hoyle, more commonly referred to as the B2FH paper. This review paper collected and refined earlier research into a heavily cited picture that gave promise of accounting for the observed relative abundances of the elements; but it did not itself enlarge Hoyle&#x27;s 1954 picture for the origin of primary nuclei as much as many assumed, except in the understanding of nucleosynthesis of those elements heavier than iron by neutron capture. Significant improvements were made by Alastair G. W. Cameron and by Donald D. Clayton. In 1957 Cameron presented his own independent approach to nucleosynthesis, informed by Hoyle&#x27;s example, and introduced computers into time-dependent calculations of evolution of nuclear systems. Clayton calculated the first time-dependent models of the &quot;s&quot;-process in 1961 and of the &quot;r&quot;-process in 1965, as well as of the burning of silicon into the abundant alpha-particle nuclei and iron-group elements in 1968, and discovered radiogenic chronologies for determining the age of the elements.

===Hydrogen fusion===

Hydrogen fusion (nuclear fusion of four protons to form a helium-4 nucleus) is the dominant process that generates energy in the cores of main-sequence stars. It is also called &quot;hydrogen burning&quot;, which should not be confused with the chemical combustion of hydrogen in an oxidizing atmosphere. There are two predominant processes by which stellar hydrogen fusion occurs: proton–proton chain and the carbon–nitrogen–oxygen (CNO) cycle. Ninety percent of all stars, with the exception of white dwarfs, are fusing hydrogen by these two processes.

In the cores of lower-mass main-sequence stars such as the Sun, the dominant energy production process is the proton–proton chain reaction. This creates a helium-4 nucleus through a sequence of reactions that begin with the fusion of two protons to form a deuterium nucleus (one proton plus one neutron) along with an ejected positron and neutrino. In each complete fusion cycle, the proton–proton chain reaction releases about 26.2 MeV. Proton-proton chain with a dependence of approximately T^4, meaning the reaction cycle is highly sensitive to temperature; a 10% rise of temperature would increase energy production by this method by 46%, hence, this hydrogen fusion process can occur in up to a third of the star&#x27;s radius and occupy half the star&#x27;s mass. For stars above 35% of the Sun&#x27;s mass, the energy flux toward the surface is sufficiently low and energy transfer from the core region remains by radiative heat transfer, rather than by convective heat transfer. As a result, there is little mixing of fresh hydrogen into the core or fusion products outward.

In higher-mass stars, the dominant energy production process is the CNO cycle, which is a catalytic cycle that uses nuclei of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen as intermediaries and in the end produces a helium nucleus as with the proton–proton chain. During a complete CNO cycle, 25.0 MeV of energy is released. The difference in energy production of this cycle, compared to the proton–proton chain reaction, is accounted for by the energy lost through neutrino emission. CNO cycle is highly sensitive to temperature, with rates proportional to T^{16-20}, a 10% rise of temperature would produce a 350% rise in energy production. About 90% of the CNO cycle energy generation occurs within the inner 15% of the star&#x27;s mass, hence it is strongly concentrated at the core. This results in such an intense outward energy flux that convective energy transfer becomes more important than does radiative transfer. As a result, the core region becomes a convection zone, which stirs the hydrogen fusion region and keeps it well mixed with the surrounding proton-rich region. This core convection occurs in stars where the CNO cycle contributes more than 20% of the total energy. As the star ages and the core temperature increases, the region occupied by the convection zone slowly shrinks from 20% of the mass down to the inner 8% of the mass. The Sun produces on the order of 1% of its energy from the CNO cycle.

The type of hydrogen fusion process that dominates in a star is determined by the temperature dependency differences between the two reactions. The proton–proton chain reaction starts at temperatures about , making it the dominant fusion mechanism in smaller stars. A self-maintaining CNO chain requires a higher temperature of approximately , but thereafter it increases more rapidly in efficiency as the temperature rises, than does the proton–proton reaction. Above approximately , the CNO cycle becomes the dominant source of energy. This temperature is achieved in the cores of main-sequence stars with at least 1.3 times the mass of the Sun. The Sun itself has a core temperature of about . As a main-sequence star ages, the core temperature will rise, resulting in a steadily increasing contribution from its CNO cycle.

===Helium fusion===

Main sequence stars accumulate helium in their cores as a result of hydrogen fusion, but the core does not become hot enough to initiate helium fusion. Helium fusion first begins when a star leaves the red giant branch after accumulating sufficient helium in its core to ignite it. In stars around the mass of the Sun, this begins at the tip of the red giant branch with a helium flash from a degenerate helium core, and the star moves to the horizontal branch where it burns helium in its core. More massive stars ignite helium in their core without a flash and execute a blue loop before reaching the asymptotic giant branch. Such a star initially moves away from the AGB toward bluer colours, then loops back again to what is called the Hayashi track. An important consequence of blue loops is that they give rise to classical Cepheid variables, of central importance in determining distances in the Milky Way and to nearby galaxies. Despite the name, stars on a blue loop from the red giant branch are typically not blue in colour but are rather yellow giants, possibly Cepheid variables. They fuse helium until the core is largely carbon and oxygen. The most massive stars become supergiants when they leave the main sequence and quickly start helium fusion as they become red supergiants. After the helium is exhausted in the core of a star, helium fusion will continue in a shell around the carbon–oxygen core.

In all cases, helium is fused to carbon via the triple-alpha process, i.e., three helium nuclei are transformed into carbon via 8Be. This can then form oxygen, neon, and heavier elements via the alpha process. In this way, the alpha process preferentially produces elements with even numbers of protons by the capture of helium nuclei. Elements with odd numbers of protons are formed by other fusion pathways.

==Reaction rate==
The reaction rate density between species &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, having number densities &quot;n&quot;&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;, is given by:
formula_1
where &quot;k&quot; is the reaction rate constant of each single elementary binary reaction composing the nuclear fusion process:
formula_2
here, &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;v&quot;) is the cross-section at relative velocity &quot;v&quot;, and averaging is performed over all velocities.

Semi-classically, the cross section is proportional to formula_3, where formula_4 is the de Broglie wavelength. Thus semi-classically the cross section is proportional to formula_5.

However, since the reaction involves quantum tunneling, there is an exponential damping at low energies that depends on Gamow factor &quot;E&quot;G, giving an Arrhenius equation:
formula_6
where &quot;S&quot;(&quot;E&quot;) depends on the details of the nuclear interaction, and has the dimension of an energy multiplied for a cross section.

One then integrates over all energies to get the total reaction rate, using the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution and the relation:
formula_7
where formula_8 is the reduced mass.

Since this integration has an exponential damping at high energies of the form formula_9 and at low energies from the Gamow factor, the integral almost vanished everywhere except around the peak, called Gamow peak, at &quot;E&quot;0, where:
formula_10

Thus:
formula_11

The exponent can then be approximated around &quot;E&quot;0 as:
formula_12

And the reaction rate is approximated as:
formula_13

Values of &quot;S&quot;(&quot;E&quot;0) are typically , but are damped by a huge factor when involving a beta decay, due to the relation between the intermediate bound state (e.g. diproton) half-life and the beta decay half-life, as in the proton–proton chain reaction. Note that typical core temperatures in main-sequence stars give &quot;kT&quot; of the order of keV.

Thus, the limiting reaction in the CNO cycle, proton capture by , has &quot;S&quot;(&quot;E&quot;0) ~ &quot;S&quot;(0) = 3.5keV·b, while the limiting reaction in the proton–proton chain reaction, the creation of deuterium from two protons, has a much lower &quot;S&quot;(&quot;E&quot;0) ~ &quot;S&quot;(0) = 4×10−22keV·b. Incidentally, since the former reaction has a much higher Gamow factor, and due to the relative abundance of elements in typical stars, the two reaction rates are equal at a temperature value that is within the core temperature ranges of main-sequence stars.

<doc id="152445" wikidata="Q5940" url="?curid=152445" title="Osnabrück (district)">
<text>Osnabrück () is a district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) in the southwest of Lower Saxony, Germany. With 2,122 km2 it is the second largest district of Lower Saxony.

== History ==
The district in its present form was established on July 1, 1972 by merging the former districts of Melle, Bersenbrück and Wittlage, and most of the old district of Osnabrück. Eight municipalities (Atter, Pye, Hellern, Nahne, Voxtrup, Darum, Gretesch and Lüstringen) were merged with the city of Osnabrück in the same year. The former district of Osnabrück had already been enlarged with the district of Iburg in 1932. The 1972 local government reform also led to a considerable decrease of the number of municipalities.

The present combined territory of the district and the city of Osnabrück is almost identical to the Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück which existed until 1802, when it was mediatised and assigned to the Electorate of Hanover. It was occupied by France between 1807 and 1813, after which it was returned to the Kingdom of Hanover. After the 1866 Austro-Prussian War, the Kingdom of Hanover (including the former bishopric of Osnabrück) was annexed by Prussia. Since 1 November 1946, the area is part of Lower Saxony.

== Geography ==
The northern two thirds of the district belong to the North German plain; the mountain ranges Teutoburg Forest and Wiehen Hills run east-west in the southern third of the district. The river Hase flows through the district from south to north. In the eastern part flows the Hunte.

The district encloses the district-free city of Osnabrück. Together, they form the Osnabrück Land (&quot;Osnabrücker Land&quot;), which can be divided &quot;inter alia&quot; into the smaller regions of Artland, Grönegau and Wittlage Land.

The &quot;Tecklenburger Land&quot; in the west is the geographical continuation of the Osnabrücker land in the neighbouring federal state North Rhine-Westphalia. Often it is ascribed to be Münsterland, although it belongs to the Osnabrücker land historically.

The district is bounded by (from the west and clockwise) the districts of Emsland, Cloppenburg, Vechta and Diepholz, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (districts of Minden-Lübbecke, Herford, Gütersloh, Warendorf and Steinfurt) and the City of Osnabrück.

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms displays the Bennoturm (&quot;Benno&#x27;s Tower&quot;) of Bad Iburg, which served as the fortress of the bishops until 1673. There is also a wheel displayed in the coat of arms, which is the heraldic symbol of the City of Osnabrück.

== Cities and municipalities ==
The district of Osnabrück encompasses 38 municipalities, eight of which are towns. 17 municipalities are part of a Samtgemeinde. Populations at 31 December 2007 are given in parentheses.


== Politics ==

=== Head of the district authority ===

Anja Kebschull (Die Grünen) is the full-time &quot;Landrat&quot; (head of the district authority) since 2019. She is the political representative and president of the district government.

=== District assembly ===

Every five years the citizens of the district Osnabrück elect their representatives into the district assembly. The district assembly is the uppermost organ of the district. The next election takes place in the autumn of 2016. At the last local election on September 11, 2011, 68 delegates and the &quot;Landrat&quot; were elected into the assembly.

The district committee prepares the decisions of the district assembly and decides affairs which the district assembly must not decide. The committee consists of twelve members from the district assembly, eleven of whom are eligible to vote.

Composition of the district assembly since 2011:
* CDU - 30 seats
* SPD - 23 seats
* Alliance 90/The Greens - 10 seats
* FDP - 2 seats
* Independent - 2 seats
* The Left - 1 seat

=== Partnerships ===

Since 1999 a partnership exists to Olsztyn County in the north-east of Poland. From historical attachment and in view of the entry of Poland in the European Union the Osnabrück district performs its special contribution to the development of the German-Polish friendship. During the past years resulted narrow municipal connections to Polish districts. Thus the district as well as the municipality Bad Essen signed a declaration in 2002 about the collaboration with Wałcz County; narrow contacts exist to Gryfino County.

=== Landschaftsverband ===

The &quot;Landschaftsverband&quot; Osnabrücke&quot;r Land&quot;, an incorporated society, looks after cultural interests under sponsorship of the administrative district and the district-free city of Osnabrück.

== Religion ==

The area of the district Osnabrück has been confessionally mixed since Protestant Reformation and the Peace of Westphalia: Lutherans (Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover) and Catholics (Roman Catholic Diocese of Osnabrück). Because the (Catholic) Osnabrücker Land bordered on Lutheran territories, there have been Lutherans in the district since the 19th century. The confessional distribution has not changed significantly in spite of the influx of Heimatvertriebene after 1945.

== Transportation ==

===Roads===

The following long distance roads pass through the district:
* Federal motorway A 1 from Cologne to Bremen and Hamburg
* A 30 from Amsterdam to Bad Oeynhausen, connecting with A 2 to Berlin and Warsaw
* A 33 from Osnabrück past Bielefeld and Paderborn to A 44
* Federal highway B 51 Cologne - Bremen
* B 65 Osnabrück - Hannover
* B 68 Paderborn – Bielefeld – Cloppenburg
* B 214 Lingen – Braunschweig
* B 218 Fürstenau - Bohmte

=== Railways ===
The first railway to reach the district territory was the &quot;Hannoversche Westbahn&quot;, connecting Osnabrück with Hanover in 1855. It was extended to Rheine in 1856. The &quot;Köln-Mindener Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft&quot; connected Osnabrück with Bremen in 1871, and with Münster in 1873. This turned the town&#x27;s main station, Osnabrück Hauptbahnhof, into a significant railway interchange.

Today the following railway lines are used for public transport:
* Hanover-Rheine, serving a.o. Osnabrück and Melle
* Münster-Bremen, serving a.o. Osnabrück, Hasbergen and Bohmte
* Oldenburg-Osnabrück, serving a.o. Osnabrück, Bramsche and Quakenbrück
* Vechta-Hesepe, serving a.o. Rieste
* Osnabrück-Bielefeld, serving a.o. Osnabrück, Oesede and Dissen

<doc id="152447" wikidata="Q216936" url="?curid=152447" title="Sean Combs">
<text>Sean John Combs (born November 4, 1969), better known by his stage name Diddy, and formerly Puff Daddy and P. Diddy, is an American rapper, record producer, and music executive. Born in Harlem and raised in Mount Vernon, Combs worked as a talent director at Uptown Records before founding his own record label, Bad Boy Records in 1993. He is credited with the discovery and development of musical artists including Mary J. Blige, Usher and the Notorious B.I.G., for whom he served as manager and hype man.

Combs&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;No Way Out&quot; (1997), peaked atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and has sold over 7 million copies in the US. Two of its singles, &quot;Can&#x27;t Nobody Hold Me Down&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Missing You&quot;, topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100—the latter was the first hip hop song to debut atop the chart. With a feature on &quot;Mo Money Mo Problems&quot;, Combs became the first solo artist to replace himself atop the chart. His second and third albums, &quot;Forever&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Saga Continues...&quot; (2001), both peaked at number two in the US. Collaborative singles &quot;Bump, Bump, Bump&quot; (2002) and &quot;Shake Ya Tailfeather&quot; (2003) made him the first rapper with five US number-one singles. Following the release of his chart-topping album &quot;Press Play&quot; (2006), Combs formed the musical group Diddy – Dirty Money with R&amp;B singers Kalenna Harper and Dawn Richard to release the collaborative album &quot;Last Train to Paris&quot; (2010). He independently released his fifth album, &quot;The Love Album: Off the Grid&quot;, in 2023.

One of the wealthiest musical artists in the world, Combs topped &quot;Forbes&quot; annual hip-hop rich list in 2014 and 2017. His accolades include three Grammy Awards, three BET Awards and two MTV Video Music Awards. He has worked as a producer for other media, including the reality television series &quot;Making the Band&quot;, and he starred in the films &quot;Made&quot; (2001), &quot;Monster&#x27;s Ball&quot; (2001) and &quot;Get Him to the Greek&quot; (2010). Combs launched the clothing retailer Sean John in 1998, for which he won Menswear Designer of the Year from the Council of Fashion Designers of America in 2004, having previously been nominated in 2000. He served as brand ambassador for the liquor brand Cîroc from 2007 to 2023, and co-founded the television network Revolt in 2013. In 2008, Combs received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the first male rapper to be so honored.

In late 2023, Combs settled a high-profile sexual assault and abuse lawsuit filed by his former partner Cassie Ventura. Numerous lawsuits regarding sexual misconduct were subsequently filed in the following months, with several claimants alleging incidents of sexual assault and abuse by Combs between 1991 and 2009. In March 2024, several properties tied to Combs were raided by the Department of Homeland Security and that September, he was charged with sex trafficking and racketeering. He pleaded not guilty and was denied bail three times. , he is detained at the Metropolitan Detention Center, and his trial is set to start on May 5, 2025.

==Early life==
Sean John Combs was born on November 4, 1969, in Harlem, New York City. Raised in Mount Vernon, New York, his mother Janice Combs (née Smalls) was a model and teacher&#x27;s assistant, and his father, Melvin Earl Combs, served in the U.S. Air Force and was an associate of convicted New York drug dealer Frank Lucas. At age 33, Melvin was shot dead while sitting in his car on Central Park West, when Combs was two years old. Combs has a sister, Keisha, and grew up in poverty.

Combs was raised Catholic and served as an altar boy. He graduated from Mount Saint Michael Academy, an all-boys Catholic school, in 1987. He played football for the academy, and his team won a division title in 1986. Combs said he was given the nickname &quot;Puff&quot; as a child, because he would &quot;huff and puff&quot; when he was angry. Combs was a business major at Howard University, but left after his second year.

==Career==
===1990–1996: Career beginnings===
Combs became an intern at New York&#x27;s Uptown Records in 1990. While working as a talent director at Uptown, under the guidance of label founder Andre Harrell, he helped develop Jodeci and Mary J. Blige. In his college days, Combs had a reputation for throwing parties, some of which attracted up to a thousand participants. Usher, who lived with Combs for a year in New York City when he was 13 years old, told Howard Stern in 2016 that Combs&#x27;s lifestyle was &quot;pretty wild&quot; during that time. In 1991, Combs promoted an AIDS fundraiser with Heavy D held at the City College of New York (CCNY) gymnasium, following a charity basketball game. The event was oversold, and a stampede occurred in which nine people died.

Shortly after being fired from Uptown in 1993, Combs established his own label Bad Boy Records, which entered a joint venture deal with Arista Records. Combs brought Uptown signee Christopher Wallace (better known as the Notorious B.I.G.) along with him to the newly established label. Both Wallace and Craig Mack began recording for the label and yielded mainstream recognition, leading to the former&#x27;s debut album and the label&#x27;s first major project, &quot;Ready to Die&quot; (1994). Combs signed more acts to Bad Boy, including Carl Thomas, Faith Evans, 112, Total, and Father MC. The Hitmen, his in-house production team, worked with Jodeci, Mary J. Blige, Usher, Lil&#x27; Kim, TLC, Mariah Carey, Boyz II Men, SWV, Aretha Franklin, and others.

Mase and the Lox joined Bad Boy just as a widely publicized rivalry between the East Coast and West Coast hip hop scenes was beginning. Combs and Wallace were criticized and parodied by Death Row Records cohorts Tupac Shakur and Suge Knight in songs and interviews during the mid-1990s. During 1994–1995, Combs produced several songs for TLC&#x27;s &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot;, which finished the decade as number 25 on Billboard&#x27;s list of top pop albums of the decade.

===1996–1998: &quot;Puff Daddy&quot; and &quot;No Way Out&quot;===

In 1996, under the name Puff Daddy, Combs released his first commercial vocal work as a rapper. His debut single, &quot;Can&#x27;t Nobody Hold Me Down&quot;, spent 28 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, peaking at number one. His debut album, &quot;No Way Out&quot;, was released on July 22, 1997, through Bad Boy Records. Originally titled &quot;Hell up in Harlem&quot;, the album underwent several changes after the Notorious B.I.G. was killed on March 9, 1997. Several of the label&#x27;s artists made guest appearances on the album. &quot;No Way Out&quot; was a significant success, particularly in the United States, where it reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in its first week of release, selling 561,000 copies.

The album produced five singles: &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Missing You&quot;, a tribute to the Notorious B.I.G., was the first rap song to debut at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; it remained at the top of the chart for 11 consecutive weeks and topped several other charts worldwide. Four other singles—&quot;Can&#x27;t Nobody Hold Me Down&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s All About the Benjamins&quot;, &quot;Been Around the World&quot;, and &quot;Victory&quot;—were also released. Combs collaborated with Jimmy Page on the song &quot;Come with Me&quot; for the 1998 film &quot;Godzilla&quot;.

The album earned Combs five nominations at the 40th Grammy Awards in 1998, and would go on to win the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. On September 7, 2000, the album was certified septuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of over 7 million copies. By the late 1990s, he was being criticized for watering down and overly commercializing hip hop, and for relying excessively on guest appearances, samples, and interpolations of past hits. For example, in a 1997 review of &quot;No Way Out&quot; for &quot;Billboard&quot;, Havelock Nelson commented: &quot;...the over-reliance on huge swathes of undiluted samples is simply clumsy, lazy, and demeaning to the sources.&quot; Also in 1997, Neil Strauss of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Combs the &quot;king of sampled hits&quot;.

===1999–2000: &quot;Forever&quot;===

In April 1999, Combs was charged with assaulting Steve Stoute of Interscope Records. Stoute was the manager for Nas, with whom Combs had filmed a video earlier that year for the song &quot;Hate Me Now&quot;. Combs was concerned that the video, which featured a shot of Nas and Combs being crucified, was blasphemous. He asked for his scenes on the cross to be pulled, but after the video aired unedited on MTV on April 15, Combs visited Stoute&#x27;s offices and injured Stoute.

&quot;Forever&quot;, Combs&#x27;s second solo studio album, was released by Bad Boy Records on August 24, 1999, in North America, and in the UK on the following day. It reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number one on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, before being ousted the following week by Mary J. Blige&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Mary&quot;. The album received positive to mixed reviews from music critics and spawned three singles that have charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. It peaked at number four on the Canadian Albums Chart, Combs&#x27;s highest-charting album in that country.

===2001–2004: &quot;P. Diddy&quot; and &quot;The Saga Continues&quot;===
Combs changed his stage name from &quot;Puff Daddy&quot; to &quot;P. Diddy&quot; in 2001. The gospel album, &quot;Thank You&quot;, which had been completed just before the beginning of the weapons trial, was due to be released in March that year, but remains unreleased . He appeared as a drug dealer in the film, &quot;Made&quot;, and starred with Halle Berry, Heath Ledger, and Billy Bob Thornton in &quot;Monster&#x27;s Ball&quot; (both in 2001).

Combs began working with a series of atypical (for him) artists. For a short period of time, he was the manager of Kelis; they have a collaboration titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Ill&quot;. He was an opening act for &#x27;N Sync on their Spring 2002 Celebrity Tour, and he signed California-based pop girl group Dream to his record label. Combs was a producer of the soundtrack album for the film &quot;Training Day&quot; (2001).

In June 2001, Combs ended Bad Boy&#x27;s distribution deal with Arista Records, gaining full control of the label, its catalogue, and its roster of artists. &quot;The Saga Continues...&quot;, released on July 10 in North America, was the last studio album released by the joint venture. The album reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums charts and was eventually certified Platinum. It is the only studio album under the P. Diddy name, and the first album by Sean Combs not to feature any guest appearances by Jay-Z or Lil&#x27; Kim. Combs was executive producer of the reality TV show, &quot;Making the Band&quot;, which appeared on MTV from 2002 to 2009.

The show involves interviewing candidates and creating musical acts that would then enter the music business. Acts who got their start this way include Da Band, Danity Kane, Day26, and Donnie Klang. In 2003, Combs ran in the New York City Marathon, raising $2million for the educational system of the city of New York. On March 10, 2004, he appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; to discuss the marathon, which he finished in four hours and eighteen minutes. In 2004, Combs headed the campaign &quot;Vote or Die&quot; for the 2004 presidential election. On February 1, 2004, Combs performed at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show.

===2005–2009: &quot;Diddy&quot; and &quot;Press Play&quot;===

On August 16, 2005, Combs announced on &quot;Today&quot; that he was altering his stage name yet again; he would be calling himself &quot;Diddy&quot;. Combs said fans did not know how to address him, which led to confusion.

Combs starred in the 2005 film &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way: Rise to Power&quot;. He played Walter Lee Younger in the 2004 Broadway revival of &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot; and the television adaptation that aired in February 2008. In 2005, Combs sold half of his record company to the Warner Music Group. He hosted the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards and was named one of the 100 Most Influential People of 2005 by &quot;Time&quot; magazine. He was mentioned in the country song &quot;Play Something Country&quot; by Brooks &amp; Dunn: the lyricist says he &quot;didn&#x27;t come to hear P. Diddy&quot;, which is rhymed with &quot;something thumpin&#x27; from the city&quot;.

In 2006, when Combs refused to release rapper Mase from his contractual obligations with Bad Boy to allow him to join the group G-Unit, 50 Cent recorded a diss song, &quot;Hip-Hop&quot;. The lyrics imply that Combs knew the identity of the Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s murderer. The two resolved the feud, but it resurfaced in later years.

Combs released his first album in four years, &quot;Press Play&quot;, on October 17, 2006, on the Bad Boy Records label. The album, featuring guest appearances by many popular artists, debuted at number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart with sales of over 173,009. Its singles &quot;Come to Me&quot; and &quot;Last Night&quot; both reached the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album became available to preview on MTV&#x27;s &quot;The Leak&quot; on October 10, 2006, a week before being sold in stores. &quot;Press Play&quot; received mixed to positive reviews from critics, and was certified Gold on the RIAA ratings. On September 18, 2007, Combs teamed up with 50 Cent and Jay-Z for the &quot;Forbes I Get Money Billion Dollar Remix&quot;.

In June 2008, Combs&#x27;s representative denied rumors of another name change. Combs ventured into reality television in August 2008 with the premiere of his VH1 series &quot;I Want to Work for Diddy&quot;. He appeared—credited under his real name—in two episodes of Season 7 of &quot;&quot;: &quot;Presumed Guilty&quot; and &quot;Sink or Swim&quot;, in the role of lawyer Derek Powell.

===2010–2013: Diddy – Dirty Money and acting===

Combs created a rap supergroup in 2010 known as the Dream Team. The group consists of Combs, Rick Ross, DJ Khaled, Fat Joe, Busta Rhymes, Red Café, and Fabolous. Combs made an appearance at comedian Chris Gethard&#x27;s live show in January 2010 at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York City. In June 2010, Combs played a role, credited as Sean Combs, in the comedy film &quot;Get Him to the Greek&quot;, as Sergio Roma, a record company executive. An &quot;Entourage&quot; series representative announced that Combs would guest star on an episode during the 2010 season.
Recruiting singers Dawn Richard and Kalenna Harper, Combs formed the female duo Diddy – Dirty Money in 2009. The trio&#x27;s first and only album, &quot;Last Train to Paris&quot;, was released by Interscope Records on December 13, 2010. The release was preceded by four singles: &quot;Angels&quot;, &quot;Hello Good Morning&quot;, &quot;Loving You No More&quot;, and &quot;Coming Home&quot;, each saw mixed success on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, although the latter peaked at number 11 on the U.S. Hot 100, number four in the UK, and number seven in Canada. Combs produced the group, and often performed with them. On March 10, 2011, Diddy and Dirty Money performed &quot;Coming Home&quot; live on &quot;American Idol&quot;.

On April 18, 2011, Combs appeared in season one of &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;, guest starring as an undercover NYPD detective. In November 2012, Combs appeared in an episode of the eighth season of the American sitcom &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot;.

===2014–2017: &quot;MMM&quot; and Bad Boy Anniversaries===
On February 26, 2014, Combs premiered &quot;Big Homie&quot;, featuring Rick Ross and French Montana, as the first single from his mixtape &quot;MMM (Money Making Mitch)&quot;, which was originally scheduled to be released that year. The song was released for digital download on March 24, and two days later the trailer for the music video was released. The full version of the music video was released on March 31. Combs used his former stage name Puff Daddy for the album. &quot;MMM&quot; was released as a free mixtape album of 12 tracks on November 4, 2015. In July 2014, Combs and Israeli record producer Guy Gerber released the collaborative album &quot;11:11&quot; as a free download. On June 29, 2015, Combs released the single &quot;Finna Get Loose&quot;, which featured vocals and production by Pharrell Williams.

In July 2015, Bad Boy Entertainment signee Gizzle told the press that she was collaborating with Combs on the ultimately-cancelled album &quot;No Way Out 2&quot;, a sequel to his 1997 debut. She describes the music as unique: &quot;The mindset is to just be classic and to be epic. And to really live up to that... we know it&#x27;s a tall order, but we welcome the challenge.&quot; In April 2016, Combs announced that after this album and its accompanying tour, he planned to retire from the music industry to focus on acting.

On May 20, 2016, Combs launched a tour of Bad Boy Records&#x27; biggest names to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the label. The documentary &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop, Won&#x27;t Stop: A Bad Boy Story&quot;, covering the two shows at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn as well as behind-the-scenes events, was released on June 23, 2017. The show toured to an additional twenty venues across the United States and Canada.

===2018–2024: &quot;Love&quot; and &quot;The Love Album: Off the Grid&quot;===

On November 5, 2017, Combs announced that he would be going by the name Love, stating, &quot;My new name is Love, aka Brother Love.&quot; Two days later, he told the press he had been joking, but on January 3, 2018, he announced on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; that he had changed his mind again, and will be using the new name after all. The change became official in 2022.

In 2019, Combs announced on Twitter that &quot;Making the Band&quot; would return to MTV in 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it failed to do so; it was delayed once more for a release in 2021 before its complete cancellation.

Combs executive-produced Nigerian singer Burna Boy&#x27;s album, &quot;Twice as Tall&quot;, which was released on August 14, 2020.

Combs hosted the 2022 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards. In May of that year, he announced the startup of a new record label, Love Records as part of a recording contract with Motown. Along with Combs himself, the label&#x27;s inaugural artist was singer Jozzy, who signed to the label that same month. The following June, he released the single &quot;Gotta Move On&quot;, which features singer Bryson Tiller and marked his first entry—at number 79—on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 since &quot;Coming Home&quot;. It was promoted as the lead single for the album, although it was only included on its expanded edition. On August 22, 2023, Combs released a teaser trailer on social media for his fifth studio album, &quot;The Love Album: Off the Grid&quot;, which was released on September 15, 2023.

Coinciding with its release was the lead single &quot;Another One of Me&quot; (with the Weeknd, French Montana and 21 Savage). The song peaked at number 87 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while the album peaked at number 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Critical responses to both the song and album were mixed to average. Despite Combs&#x27;s signing with Motown, the album was released independently, with the label&#x27;s name only present on promotional materials. During an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, Combs stated that: 

&quot;The Love Album: Off the Grid&quot; received a nomination for Best Progressive R&amp;B Album at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, which commenced on February 4, 2024; Combs did not attend the ceremony, due to sexual misconduct allegations levied against him.

==Business career==
&quot;Fortune&quot; magazine listed Combs at number 12 on their top 40 of entrepreneurs under 40 in 2002. &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine estimated that for the year ending May 2017, Combs earned $130 million, ranking him number one among entertainers.

In late 2006, the department store Macy&#x27;s removed Sean John jackets from their shelves when they discovered that the clothing was made using raccoon dog fur. Combs had not known the jackets were made with genuine fur, but as soon as he was alerted, he had production stopped.

In November 2008, Combs added a men&#x27;s perfume line &quot;I Am King&quot; to the Sean John brand. The fragrance, dedicated to Barack Obama, Muhammad Ali, and Martin Luther King Jr., featured Bar Refaeli in its advertising. In early 2016, Sean John introduced the brand&#x27;s GIRLS collection.

===White Parties===
Combs held a series of parties known as White Parties between 1998 and 2009. The parties had a strict all-white dress code. A 2024 &quot;New York Times&quot; article stated that in the 2000s &quot;few events held the cultural cachet&quot;. CNN commented that &quot;there was a time when one of the hottest summer tickets belonged to anyone who was able to score an invite to party&quot; with Combs, and that the parties &quot;marked the peak of his cultural influence&quot;.

==Legal issues==
In 1997, Combs was sued for landlord neglect by ; Combs denied the charges. On April 15, 1999, shortly after the music video for Nas&#x27; &quot;Hate Me Now&quot; aired on MTV featuring Combs being crucified, he and two others burst into Nas&#x27; former manager, Steve Stoute&#x27;s office and attacked him. Stoute sued Combs in June 1999, resulting in Combs paying him an out-of-court settlement of $500,000. Originally charged with assault for the event, Combs pleaded guilty on September 8, 1999, to a charge of harassment, and was sentenced to spend one day in an anger management class.

On December 27, 1999, Combs, his then-girlfriend Jennifer Lopez, and his protégé rapper Shyne were at Club New York in Times Square in Manhattan when gunfire occurred. A prosecutor said that the incident was sparked by an argument at the club between Combs and another patron. After a police investigation, Combs and Shyne were arrested for weapons violations and other charges. Combs was charged with four weapons-related crimes and with bribing his driver, Wardel Fenderson, to claim ownership of his gun. With a gag order in place, the highly publicized trial began. Combs&#x27;s attorneys were Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. and Benjamin Brafman. Combs was found not guilty on all charges. Shyne was convicted on five of his eight charges and sentenced to ten years in prison. Combs and Lopez broke up shortly after. A lawsuit filed by Fenderson, who said he suffered emotional damage after the shooting, was settled in February 2004. Lawyers for both sides, having agreed to keep the settlement terms secret, said the matter had been &quot;resolved to the satisfaction of all parties&quot;.

In 2001, Combs was arrested for driving with a suspended license in Florida.

In 2003, the National Labor Committee revealed that factories producing the Sean John clothing brand in Honduras were violating Honduran labor laws. Accusations were that workers were subjected to body searches and involuntary pregnancy tests, bathrooms were locked and access tightly controlled, and employees were forced to work overtime and received sweatshop wages. Charles Kernaghan of the National Labor Committee told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that, &quot;Sean Puff Daddy obviously has a lot of clout, he can literally do a lot overnight to help these workers.&quot; Combs responded with an extensive investigation, telling reporters, &quot;I&#x27;m as pro-worker as they get.&quot; In February 2004, Kernaghan announced that improvements had been implemented at the factory, including adding air conditioning and water purification systems, firing the most abusive supervisors, and allowing the formation of a labor union.

Also in 2003, Kirk Burrowes sued Combs, claiming that Combs had forced him to give up his shares in Bad Boy Records through threats of violence. In 2006, the case was dismissed because the statute of limitations had expired.

In 2005, an assault charge against Combs filed by Michigan television host Rogelio Mills was resolved in Combs&#x27;s favor.

Later in 2005, London-based musical artist and DJ Richard Dearlove, who had been performing under the name &quot;Diddy&quot; since 1992—nine years before Combs started using even &quot;P. Diddy&quot;—sought an injunction in the High Court of Justice in London. He accepted an out-of-court settlement of £10,000 in damages and more than £100,000 in costs. Combs can no longer use the name Diddy in the UK, where he is still known as P. Diddy.

In 2007, Gerard Rechnitzer sued Combs for battery, claiming Combs had punched him outside a Hollywood nightclub. Rechnitzer claimed he was attacked after he approached Combs while the rap mogul was talking to his girlfriend. Combs settled the lawsuit on undisclosed terms in March 2008.

In 2009, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; claimed that the Notorious B.I.G. and Combs orchestrated the 1994 robbery and shooting of Tupac, substantiating the claim with supposed FBI documents. The newspaper later retracted the story, acknowledging that the documents had been fabricated. In 2012, Dexter Isaac, an associate of record management executive Jimmy Henchman, confessed that he had shot Tupac on Henchman&#x27;s orders.

In 2015, Combs was arrested for aggravated assault after an altercation with his son&#x27;s football coach at the University of California, Los Angeles. On July 2, 2015, the assault charges were dropped due to lack of evidence.

In 2021, Combs filed a $60 million lawsuit against the new owners of Sean John, claiming the firm used his likeness without his permission and fabricated quotes endorsing their new product line. In 2023, Combs filed a racial discrimination lawsuit against Diageo, claiming that the spirits company deliberately &quot;knee-capped&quot; the marketing and sales of his Cîroc vodka and DeLéon tequila labels. In January 2024, Combs voluntarily withdrew the lawsuit with prejudice, and also severed the business relationship.

On March 4, 2024, music producer Rodney &quot;Lil Rod&quot; Jones, who was already suing Combs for sexual assault, filed a lawsuit against Combs and his son Justin, alleging that they engaged in a &quot;massive&quot; cover-up of their involvement in the shooting of a 30-year-old man at a &quot;writers and producers camp&quot; that was held at Combs&#x27;s Chalice Recording Studio in Los Angeles in September 2022.

On March 25, 2024, former Syracuse University basketball player and Combs associate Brendan Paul was arrested at the Opa Locka Airport in Miami-Dade County, Florida, on two charges of cocaine and controlled substance possession; he was released the next day after posting a $2,500 bond. Lil Rod has accused Paul of being Combs&#x27;s &quot;drug mule&quot; in court documents.

=== Sexual misconduct allegations, lawsuits, and arrest ===

In May 2017, Cindy Rueda, who previously had served as Combs&#x27;s personal chef, filed a lawsuit against Combs in the Los Angeles County Superior Court, claiming, among other things, sexual harassment and retaliation. The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount in February 2019.

Cassie Ventura, with whom Combs had a long-term relationship, filed a lawsuit against him on November 16, 2023, accusing him of rape, sex trafficking, and physical abuse. The lawsuit also suggested that Combs was responsible for blowing up Ventura&#x27;s then-boyfriend Kid Cudi&#x27;s car. Combs and Ventura reached an undisclosed settlement the following day, and the lawsuit was dismissed.

Two further lawsuits were filed against Combs by two additional complainants, alleging sexual assault and revenge porn, on November 23, 2023. One of the lawsuits claimed that in 1990 or 1991, Combs and Aaron Hall had sexually abused a woman, with Combs recording the incident.

On May 17, 2024, CNN released surveillance footage of Combs physically assaulting Ventura at the InterContinental hotel in Century City, Los Angeles, on March 5, 2016. This incident was among the allegations made in the lawsuit. On May 19, 2024, Combs issued a video apology on Instagram and Facebook, stating he was &quot;truly sorry&quot; and that his actions were &quot;inexcusable&quot;. Combs&#x27;s assault of Ventura was stopped by hotel staff, after which Combs allegedly tried to bribe the staff, according to a federal indictment in September 2024.

On October 1, 2024, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that a team of lawyers will be filing as many as 120 more lawsuits, covering assaults that took place during the 2000s and 2010s. Plaintiffs, 25 of whom are minors, are both male and female. Tony Buzbee, one of the attorneys on the team, said most of the alleged assaults took place in New York State. Half of the alleged victims say they reported the assault to police, to a doctor, or to the FBI. Some claim to have been drugged or offered hush money. Additional potential defendants other than Combs are also to be named in the lawsuits: &quot;The names that we&#x27;re going to name, assuming our investigators confirm and corroborate what we&#x27;ve been told, are names that will shock you&quot;, Buzbee commented at a press conference in Houston. &quot;I&#x27;m talking here about not just the cowardly but complicit bystanders, that is those people that we know watched this behavior occur and did nothing. I&#x27;m talking about the people that participated, encouraged it, egged it on. They know who they are.&quot; Buzbee filed the first six of these lawsuits in New York federal court on October 13, 2024. Andrew Van Arsdale of the AVA Law Group, which is working with Buzbee, said they have heard abuse allegations against Combs from some three thousand people, and their team is currently actively examining another hundred potential cases. Erica Wolff, a member of Combs&#x27;s legal team, told the BBC that Combs &quot;looks forward to proving his innocence and vindicating himself in court, where the truth will be established based on evidence, not speculation&quot;.

Combs was arrested and indicted in the Southern District of New York on September 16, 2024, on charges of racketeering, sex trafficking by force, and transportation for purposes of prostitution. He is awaiting trial in federal custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. During a court appearance on October 10, 2024, Judge Arun Subramanian set Combs&#x27;s trial start date as May 5, 2025. On November 27, 2024, a judge denied bail for a third time.

In 2025, Peacock released the documentary movie &quot;Diddy: The Making of a Bad Boy&quot; about Combs&#x27; life and current legal issues, and Investigation Discovery released a four-part docuseries &quot;Fall of Diddy&quot;. On 12 February 2025, Combs&#x27; representatives filed a defamation lawsuit against NBCUniversal, Peacock, and Ample Entertainment alleging &quot;Diddy: The Making of a Bad Boy&quot; contains defamatory statements.

<text>Trans World Airlines (TWA) was a major airline in the United States that operated from 1930 until it was acquired by American Airlines in 2001. It was formed as Transcontinental &amp; Western Air to operate a route from New York City to Los Angeles via St. Louis, Kansas City, and other stops, with Ford Trimotors. With American, United, and Eastern, it was one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; domestic airlines in the United States formed by the Spoils Conference of 1930.

Howard Hughes acquired control of TWA in 1939, and after World War II led the expansion of the airline to serve Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, making TWA a second unofficial flag carrier of the United States after Pan Am. Hughes gave up control in the 1960s, and the new management of TWA acquired Hilton International and Century 21 in an attempt to diversify the company&#x27;s business.

As the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 led to a wave of airline failures, start-ups, and takeovers in the United States, TWA was spun off from its holding company in 1984. Carl Icahn acquired control of TWA and took the company private in a leveraged buyout in 1988. TWA became saddled with debt, sold its London routes, underwent Chapter 11 restructuring in 1992 and 1995, and was further stressed by the crash of TWA Flight 800 in 1996, which would become the third deadliest aviation accident in U.S. history.

TWA was headquartered at one time in Kansas City, Missouri, and planned to make Kansas City International Airport its main domestic and international hub, but abandoned this plan in the 1970s. The airline later developed its largest hub at St. Louis Lambert International Airport. Its main transatlantic hub was the TWA Flight Center at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, an architectural icon designed by Eero Saarinen, and completed in 1962.

In January 2001, TWA filed for a third and final bankruptcy and was acquired by American Airlines. American laid off many former TWA employees in the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks. TWA continued to exist as an LLC under American Airlines until July 1, 2003. American Airlines closed the St. Louis hub in 2009.
==History==
===1930s===
====Founding: TWA====
TWA&#x27;s corporate history dates from July 16, 1930, and the forced merger of Transcontinental Air Transport (TAT), Western Air Express (WAE), Maddux Air Lines, Standard, and Pittsburgh Aviation Industries Corporation (PAIC) to form Transcontinental &amp; Western Air (T&amp;WA) on 1 Oct. 1930. The companies merged at the urging of Postmaster General Walter Folger Brown, who was looking for bigger airlines to give airmail contracts to.

The airline brought high-profile aviation pioneers who would give the airline the panache of being called &quot;The Airman&#x27;s Airline&quot;. TAT had the marquee expertise of Charles Lindbergh and was already offering a 48-hour combination of plane and train trips across the United States. WAE had the expertise of Jack Frye. TWA became known as &quot;The Lindbergh Line&quot;, with the &quot;Shortest Route Coast to Coast&quot;.

On October 25, 1930, the airline offered one of the first all-plane scheduled services from coast to coast. The route took 36 hours, which included an overnight stay in Kansas City. In summer 1931, TWA moved its headquarters from New York to Kansas City, Missouri.

====DC-1, DC-2 and DC-3 ====

On March 31, 1931, the airline suffered after the 1931 Transcontinental &amp; Western Air Fokker F-10 crash near Matfield Green, Kansas. The crash killed all eight on board, including University of Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne. The cause of the crash was linked to the wooden wings, one of which failed in flight. As a consequence, all of the airline&#x27;s Fokker F.10s were grounded and later scrapped. TWA needed a replacement aircraft, but the first sixty modern all-metal Boeing 247s were promised to Boeing&#x27;s sister company United Airlines (both were subsidiaries of United Aircraft and Transport Corporation). TWA was forced to sponsor the development of a new airplane design. Specifications included the ability to fly the high altitude route between Winslow, Arizona, and Albuquerque, New Mexico, with one engine inoperative. Other specifications included the capacity to carry 12 passengers and a range of 1,080 miles.

On September 20, 1932, the development contract was signed with Douglas Aircraft Company and the Douglas DC-1 was delivered to TWA in December 1933, the sole example of its type. On February 18, 1934, Frye (pilot) and Eastern Air Lines&#x27; head Eddie Rickenbacker (co-pilot), flew the DC-1 from Glendale, California, to Newark, New Jersey, setting a transcontinental record of 13 hours and 4 minutes. On April 17, Frye was elected president of TWA. Throughout 1934, Tommy Tomlinson set further load and distance records with the DC-1. At the same time, TWA used its Northrop Gamma as an &quot;experimental Overweather Laboratory&quot;, in a desire to fly at altitudes above the weather.

The DC-1 was followed by the delivery of 32 Douglas DC-2s that started operations in May 1934 on TWA&#x27;s Columbus–Pittsburgh–Newark route. Most were phased out by 1937 as the Douglas DC-3 started service, but several DC-2s would be operational through the early years of World War II. TWA started using the DC-3 on June 1, 1937. The fleet included ten DST sleeper aircraft and eight standard DC-3 day versions.

====Airmail and Hughes====

In 1934, following charges of favouritism in the contracts, the Air Mail scandal erupted, leading to the Air Mail Act of 1934, which dissolved the forced Transcontinental/Western merger and ordered the United States Army Air Service to deliver the mail. However, Transcontinental opted to retain the T&amp;WA name. With the company facing financial hardship, Lehman Brothers and John D. Hertz took over ownership of the company. The Army fliers had a series of crashes, and it was decided to privatize the delivery with the provision that no former companies could bid on the contracts. T&amp;WA added the suffix &quot;Inc.&quot; to its name, thus qualifying it as a different company. It was awarded 60% of its old contracts back in May 1934 and won back the rest within a few years.
On January 29, 1937, TWA contracted with Boeing for five Boeing 307 Stratoliners, which included a pressurized cabin. However, the TWA board refused to authorize the expenditure. Frye then approached another flying enthusiast, Howard Hughes, along with Algur H. Meadows and his business partner Henry W. Peters, to buy stock in 1937. Hughes Tool Company purchased 99,293 shares at $8.25 a share, giving Hughes control, and Noah Dietrich was also placed on the board. Later, Hughes bought another $1,500,000 worth of stock. Paul E. Richter became executive vice president in 1938. A new order for five Stratoliners was placed on September 23, 1939, the first Stratoliner was delivered on May 6, 1940, and TWA initiated coast-to-coast flights on July 8, 1940. The planes could carry 16 night passengers in berths or 33 day passengers. The cabin was pressurized at 12,000 feet, enabling it to fly at an altitude of 20,000 feet, above much of the weather.

===1940s===
====World War II====
TWA contracted its five Stratoliners to the Army Air Force&#x27;s Air Transport Command after Pearl Harbor. Designated as C-75s, they flew 3000 transatlantic flights to Africa and Europe. TWA also contracted to fly its C-54s and Lockheed C-69 Constellations. Hughes and TWA had developed the Constellation in secret with Lockheed, and Hughes purchased 40 for TWA&#x27;s use in 1939, through his Hughes Tool Company. On April 17, 1944, Hughes and Frye flew the TWA Constellation from Burbank, California, to Washington, D.C., in 6 hours 58 minutes. By the war&#x27;s end, 20 Constellations had been built.

====Post-war: The Trans World Airline====
TWA had 10 Constellations by the end of 1945 and acquired international routes. TWA inaugurated its New York-Paris route on February 5, 1946, with the &quot;Star of Paris&quot;. The Italy route was initiated on 2 April and then extended to Cairo. Hughes flew the &quot;Star of California&quot; from Los Angeles to New York on February 15, 1946, in 8 hours and 38 minutes. Hollywood passengers included Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, William Powell, Frank Morgan, Walter Pidgeon, Tyrone Power, Edward G. Robinson. Hence TWA&#x27;s reputation as the &quot;airline of the stars&quot;.

On October 21, 1946, TWA pilots went on strike. The strike finally ended when TWA and the pilots union agreed to binding arbitration on November 15, 1946. Additionally, TWA lost $14.5 million in 1946, owed $4.34 million in short-term debt and $38.9 million in long-term debt. Yet Hughes opposed Frye&#x27;s financing proposals.

====Falling out between Hughes and Frye====
Frye and Hughes had a falling out in 1947. Hughes&#x27;s financial advisor Noah Dietrich wrote that &quot;Frye&#x27;s inept handling of costs, his inefficient operations, his extravagance with new purchases of equipment, all these factors combined to nosedive the TWA stock from 71 at the war&#x27;s end to 9 in 1947&quot;. The airline was losing $20,000,000 a year, was in danger of not being able to acquire fuel for its planes due to being deeply indebted to oil companies, and the pilot&#x27;s union went on strike. Hughes provided $10,000,000 worth of financing, which was later converted to 1,039,000 shares, Frye was removed, and Hughes added 11 members to the board, giving him control. Thus ended the era of &quot;The Airline Run by Flyers&quot;.

LaMotte Cohu took over as president, and TWA ordered 12 Lockheed L-749 Constellations on October 18, 1947. Cohu was replaced by Ralph Damon in 1948. As president of American Airlines (AAL), Damon was a proponent of AAL being in the transatlantic market. Damon approved the mergers of AAL and American Export in 1945 to form American Overseas Airlines (AOA). When C.R. Smith sold AOA to Pan American, Damon became disillusioned with AAL. As a consequence, Hughes was able to hire Damon to run TWA. Damon described air transportation as &quot;a race between technology and bankruptcy.&quot; Over the next 7 years, Damon introduced practices within the industry that became standard, such as multi-class service with first class and economy class. Damon also brought financial stability by eliminating the company deficit, which was reflected in the stock price rising into the 60s. Carter L. Burgess then took over in 1957, but lasted less than a year, unable to work with Hughes&#x27; meddling.

On May 31, 1949, TWA ordered 20 Lockheed 749As. They were operated by TWA for the next 17 years.

===1950s: Trans World Airlines===
On February 22, 1950, TWA signed a contract with the Glenn L. Martin Company for 12 Martin 2-0-2s and 30 Martin 4-0-4s. The first plane was delivered on July 14, 1950. TWA&#x27;s Martin fleet was eventually increased to 53 planes, and they remained operational until 1961. On May 17, 1950, the airline officially changed its name to Trans World Airlines. On December 5, 1950, TWA ordered 10 Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellations, which were delivered in 1952. On October 19, 1953, TWA offered nonstop transcontinental service.
TWA&#x27;s flight operations were based at Kansas City Municipal Airport, while their overhaul base was located at Fairfax Airport. When the Great Flood of 1951 destroyed the facility, the city of Kansas City helped TWA build a new facility on 5000 acres, north of downtown at what became Kansas City International Airport.

On July 10, 1953, TWA ordered 20 Lockheed 1049Es, which was later changed to be 1049Gs. They were put in service on April 1, 1955. On September 25, TWA introduced multiple class services, first and economy. On October 30, they inaugurated their Los Angeles-London route, via New York.
On December 23, 1954, the Hughes Tool Co. ordered 25 Lockheed L-1449 turboprops. On March 29, 1955, this order was changed to piston-powered L-1649As. Hughes transferred the planes to TWA in 1956, after receiving Civil Aeronautics Board approval. The first L-1649A was delivered on May 4, 1957. Fully reclining seats were later added to the airliner.

In February 1956, Hughes Tool Co. placed an order with Pratt &amp; Whitney for 300 jet engines, JT-3s and JT-4s. On March 2, 1956, Hughes Tool Co. placed an order for 8 domestic Boeing 707s, later increased to 15 aircraft on January 10, 1957, and an order for 18 international 707s on 19 March 1956, bringing the total order with Boeing to 33 jet planes. Then on June 7, 1956, Hughes placed an order for 30 Convair 880 Skylarks. TWA suffered from its late entry to the jet age, and Hughes&#x27; 1956 order cost $497 million. The transaction ultimately resulted in Hughes losing control of the airline.

In 1958, TWA became the first major airline to hire an African American flight attendant, hiring Margaret Grant after another African American woman, Dorothy Franklin of Astoria, Queens, New York, filed a lawsuit alleging &quot;that she had been discriminated against &#x27;because of poor complexion ... unattractive teeth&#x27; and legs that were &#x27;not shapely&#x27;&quot;. New York governor W. Averell Harriman praised her hiring, saying the action &quot;would raise American prestige abroad&quot;.

Charles Sparks Thomas became president on July 2, 1958. The inaugural flight of TWA&#x27;s Boeing 707 took place on March 20, 1959.

===1960s===
In 1961, TWA introduced in-flight movies. In 1962, TWA started using Doppler radar on its international flights.

====Charles C. Tillinghast Jr.====

In 1960, Hughes relinquished control of the airline, as the major stockholder, through the financial terms associated with the jet purchase. As a consequence of that deal, Charles C. Tillinghast Jr. took over as president. The battle over Hughes&#x27; control continued in court until 1966 when Hughes was forced to sell his stock. That sale brought Hughes $546,549,771.

Under a plan put together by Dillon, Read &amp; Co., a $165 million loan was raised to fund a 45-jet fleet. The deal was signed on December 30, 1960 by Hughes&#x27; lawyer Raymond Holliday, who constituted one member of a three-person voting trust, with the other two members, Ernest R. Breech and Irving S. Olds, represented the financing institutions. On June 30, 1961, TWA filed a federal suit against Hughes, Hughes Tool Co., and Raymond Holliday. Then on April 18, 1962, TWA filed a Delaware suit against Hughes and Hughes Tool Co. On January 10, 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against TWA in the federal case. However, on May 15, 1986, Delaware ruled in favor of TWA for the state case, eventually awarding TWA $48,346,000.

TWA started operating its Convair 880s on January 12, 1961 but would report a net loss of $38.7 million for 1961. TWA reported a net profit of $19.8 million in 1963, $37 million in 1964, and $50.1 million in 1965. TWA stock went from $7.5 per share in 1962 to $62 in 1965.

Under new management, the Trans World Corporation (TWA&#x27;s holding company) expanded to purchase Hilton Hotels, Hardee&#x27;s, Canteen Corp., and Century 21 Realty. Employment grew to nearly 10,000 employees. In 1964, TWA started a program to assist in the United States export expansion effort that became known as the TWA MarketAir Corporate Logo to promote business passenger air travel and as a marketing tool to be used in air cargo sales. This marketing effort was initiated by the Senior Vice President, of Marketing, Thomas B. McFadden, in collaboration with the Bureau of International Commerce, important U.S. financial institutions, and export expansion entities to offer tools that small and medium-sized U.S. companies could use at low or no cost to expand their exports. Staff management of this program was under the direction of Joseph S. Cooper. A key element of this program was the &quot;MarketAir Newsletter&quot; in a number of languages targeted to American exporters and international travellers.

In 1964, TWA opened its New York office.

====Revolutionary airport design====
TWA was one of the first airlines, after Delta Air Lines, to embrace the spoke-hub distribution paradigm and was one of the first with the Boeing 747. It planned to use the 747 along with the supersonic transport to fly people between the West/Midwest (via Kansas City) and New York City (via John F. Kennedy International Airport) to Europe and other world destinations. As part of this strategy, TWA&#x27;s hub airports were to have gates close to the street. The TWA-style airport design proved impractical when hijackings to Cuba in the late 1960s caused a need for central security checkpoints.

=====John F. Kennedy International Airport=====
In 1962, TWA opened Trans World Flight Center, now Terminal 5 (or simply T5), at New York City&#x27;s JFK Airport and designed by Eero Saarinen. The terminal was expanded in 1969 to accommodate jumbo jets, went dormant in 2001, and underwent renovation and expansion beginning in 2005. A new terminal with a crescent-shaped entry hall and now serving JetBlue opened in 2008—partially encircling the landmark. The headhouse was renovated by Morse Development along with MCR and turned into the TWA Hotel which opened on May 15, 2019.

=====Kansas City International Airport=====
Kansas City approved a $150 million bond issue for the TWA hub there. TWA vetoed plans for a Dulles International Airport–style hub-and-spoke gate structure. Following union strife, the airport ultimately cost $250 million when it opened in 1972, with Vice President Spiro Agnew officiating. TWA&#x27;s gates, which were intended to be within of the street, became obsolete because of security issues. Kansas City refused to rebuild its terminals as Dallas Fort Worth International Airport rebuilt its similar terminals, forcing TWA to look for a new hub. Missouri politicians moved to keep it in the state and in 1982, TWA began a decade-long move to Lambert International Airport in St. Louis.

====All-jet fleet====
On April 7, 1967, TWA became one of the first all-jet airlines in the USA with the retirement of their last Lockheed L-749A Constellation and L-1649 Starliner cargo aircraft. That morning aircraft ground-service personnel placed a booklet on every passenger seat throughout the TWA system titled &quot;Props Are For Boats&quot;.

Between 1967–72, TWA was the world&#x27;s third-largest airline by passenger miles, behind Aeroflot and United. During the mid and late 1960s, the airline extended its reach as far east as Hong Kong from Europe and also introduced service to several destinations in Africa. In 1969, TWA carried the most transatlantic passengers of any airline; until then, Pan American World Airways had always been number one. In the Transpacific Route Case of 1969, TWA was given authority to fly across the Pacific to Hawaii and Taiwan, and for a few years, TWA had a round-the-world network.

In 1969, TWA opened the Breech Academy on a campus in the Kansas City suburb of Overland Park, Kansas to train its flight attendants, ticket agents, and travel agents, as well as to provide flight simulators for its pilots. It became the definitive airline facility, training other airlines&#x27; staff, as well as its own.

The airline continued to expand European operations in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. In 1987, TWA had a transatlantic system reaching from Los Angeles to Bombay, including virtually every major European population center, with 10 American gateways.

===1970s===
TWA introduced the Boeing 747 to its fleet in 1970. After the merger with Hilton International in 1967, TWA&#x27;s holding company, Trans World Corp., continued to diversify, buying Canteen Corp. in 1973, and then the Hardee&#x27;s restaurant franchises. Financial woes in the 1970s included a flight attendants&#x27; strike, higher fuel prices after the Arab Oil Embargo, and airline deregulation. During the early 1970s, the aviation industry faced significant challenges due to a severe economic downturn. TWA, in particular, had difficulties as their Boeing 747s and Lockheed L-1011s flew with very low passenger numbers. TWA had originally purchased these planes not because they needed them for their operations, but rather because Pan Am had ordered a large number of them. Consequently, TWA had to manage excess capacity with a fleet of oversized planes that exceeded their actual requirements. By 1975, the financial obligations of some payrolls could only be fulfilled by promptly selling six Boeing 747 aircraft to the Iranian Air Force. The financial deal involving TWA, in which the jetliners were sold for around one-sixth of their true value, was regrettable. However, the airline was in a state of desperation for immediate liquidity. TWA was experiencing financial losses on its trans-Pacific route. In a significant milestone, TWA&#x27;s network expanded globally for the first time in its corporate history. However, this achievement would be short-lived as subsequent events led to its eventual termination.

In 1975, Trans World Airlines was headquartered in Turtle Bay, in Midtown Manhattan.

The uniforms for the flight attendants during this decade went through three different designers. From 1971–1974, the official TWA uniform was designed by Valentino. From 1974–1978, the official TWA uniform was designed by Stan Herman, and from 1978–2001, the official TWA uniform was designed by Ralph Lauren.

===1980s===

Facing the pressures of deregulation, the airline consolidated its route system around a domestic hub in St. Louis, aided by its purchase of Ozark Air Lines in 1986, and an international gateway in New York. It was able to remain profitable during this time because of its good route positioning and the relatively low costs of adapting its operations.

In 1983, Trans World Corporation spun off the airline. In 1985, TWA&#x27;s board agreed to sell the airline to Frank Lorenzo&#x27;s Texas Air Corporation. Due to Texas Air&#x27;s ownership of non-union carriers Continental Airlines and New York Air, as well as Lorenzo&#x27;s reputation of being a &#x27;union buster&#x27;, TWA&#x27;s unions objected to the sale, and instead supported a takeover deal from Carl Icahn by offering concessions on condition that Icahn&#x27;s deal be accepted by the board. Directors subsequently agreed, and the Texas Air deal was scrapped. Following the sale, Icahn appointed himself as chairman of the airline.

Also in 1985, TWA closed its hub at Pittsburgh International Airport after nearly 20 years as a hub. The following year, TWA acquired Ozark Air Lines, a regional carrier based at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, for $250 million. This transaction increased TWA&#x27;s share of enplanements in St. Louis from 56.6% to 82%.

TWA had pilot bases in many European cities such as Berlin, Frankfurt, Zürich, Rome, and Athens. These bases were used to provide crews for the Boeing 727s which TWA operated in its European route network. Its Boeing 727 aircraft served Cairo, Athens, Rome, London, Paris, Geneva, Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Stuttgart, Zürich, Amsterdam, Oslo, Vienna, and Istanbul.

In 1987, Icahn moved the company&#x27;s main offices from Manhattan to office buildings he owned in Mount Kisco.

TWA earned a profit of $106.2 million in 1987. In September 1988, TWA stockholders approved a plan to take the company private, winning Icahn $469 million in personal profit, but adding $539.7 million in debt to TWA.
TWA&#x27;s zenith as an international carrier occurred in the summer of 1988, when, for the only time, the airline carried more than 50 percent of all transatlantic passengers. Every day, Boeing 747, Lockheed L-1011, and Boeing 767 aircraft departed to more than 30 cities in Europe, fed by a small but effective domestic operation focused on moving U.S. passengers to New York or other gateway cities for wide-body service across the Atlantic, while a similar inter-European operation shuttled non-U.S. passengers to TWA&#x27;s European gateways—London, Paris (which was even considered a European hub by TWA), and Frankfurt—for travel to the United States.

In 1989, TWA decided to replace its fleet of Boeing 727 Series 100 aircraft with the former Ozark Airlines DC-9s. This decision was based on the economics of operating three-crew airplanes (727s) with three engines, versus operating two-crew airplanes (DC-9s) with two engines. Both airplanes had about the same passenger and cargo capacity, so it was decided to replace the Boeing fleet. To prepare for this transition, TWA positioned several million dollars worth of spare parts for the DC-9s in Germany. This was a requirement dictated by the German government. If TWA wanted to use DC-9s in the service of the German population, then TWA had to provide readily available spare parts for its fleet. The airline also sent its senior DC-9 pilots (known as Check Airmen) to Europe to observe the operations in preparation for the changeover of the crews that were to follow. Shortly before the DC-9 airplanes began arriving in Germany, however, the entire plan was cancelled because the leasing contracts that Carl Icahn had created for the former Ozark DC-9s specifically forbade any operations outside the continental limits of the United States.

===1990s===
In 1990, Icahn&#x27;s pressing need for additional capital forced him to sell the airline&#x27;s Heathrow operations to American Airlines about the same time that Pan American World Airways sold its Heathrow operation to United.

====1992 bankruptcy====
Tillinghast&#x27;s analysis overlooked the possible implications of the transpacific industry and the specialized air freight market. Based on available reports, there are allegations that he purportedly articulated the perspective that the Pacific area and the freight business exhibit a deficiency in financial performance. The primary aim of their endeavor was to diminish the scale of the airline to achieve financial sustainability. These two oversights are said to have been the undoing of TWA, in addition to Sandro Andretta&#x27;s resignation in December 1991.

Airline deregulation hit TWA hard in the 1980s. TWA had badly neglected domestic U.S. expansion at a time when the newly deregulated domestic market was growing quickly. TWA&#x27;s holding company, Trans World Corporation, spun off the airline, which then became starved for capital. The airline briefly considered selling itself to renowned corporate raider Frank Lorenzo in the 1980s, but ended up selling to yet another corporate raider, Carl Icahn, in 1985. Under Icahn&#x27;s direction, many of its most profitable assets were sold to competitors, much to the detriment of TWA. Icahn was eventually ousted in 1993, though not before the airline was forced to file for bankruptcy on January 31, 1992.

Negotiations continued until a deal was reached on 24 Aug. 1992. In that deal, Icahn had to pay TWA $150 million, the employees reduced compensation by 15% over the next three years, and the creditors forgave $1 billion in debt. When TWA emerged from bankruptcy in Nov. 1993, employees owned 45% of the company. Jeffrey H. Erickson took over as president in 1994, moved its headquarters to St. Louis, and sponsored the Trans World Dome.

====1995 bankruptcy====
When Carl Icahn left in 1993, he arranged to have TWA give Karabu Corp., an entity he controlled, the rights to buy TWA tickets at 45% off published fares through September 2003. This was named &quot;the Karabu deal&quot;. The ticket program agreement, which began on June 14, 1995, excluded tickets for travel which originated or terminated in St. Louis, Missouri. Tickets were subject to TWA&#x27;s normal seat assignment and boarding pass rules and regulations - they were not assignable to any other carrier and were not endorsable. No commissions were paid to Karabu by TWA for tickets sold under the ticket program agreement.
By agreement dated August 14, 1995, Lowestfare.com LLC, a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of Karabu, was joined as a party to the ticket program agreement. Pursuant to the ticket program agreement, Lowestfare.com could purchase an unlimited number of system tickets. System tickets are tickets for all applicable classes of service which were purchased by Karabu from TWA at a 45% discount from TWA&#x27;s published fare. In addition to system tickets, Lowestfare.com could also purchase domestic consolidator tickets, which are tickets issued at bulk fare rates and were limited to specified origin/destination city markets and did not permit the holder to modify or refund a purchased ticket. Karabu&#x27;s purchase of domestic consolidator tickets was subject to a cap of $70 million per year based on the full retail price of the tickets.

On most TWA flights, Karabu could buy at a heavy discount and then sell a certain portion of all TWA&#x27;s available seats. As a result, TWA was hamstrung by the high proportion of heavily discounted seats that had been sold and was essentially left with no control over its pricing. It could not afford to discount any of its seats, and if TWA wanted to increase revenue on busy routes by putting a larger plane into service, Karabu would only claim more seats. TWA was losing an estimated $150 million a year in revenue due to this deal.

To ameliorate the Karabu deal, TWA went in and out of bankruptcy in 1995.

TWA entered its second bankruptcy on June 30, 1995. When TWA emerged in August 1995, employee ownership was reduced to 30%, but the company was relieved of $0.5 billion of its $1.8 billion debt.

====Short turn-around====

By 1998, TWA had reorganized as a primarily domestic carrier, with routes centered on hubs in St. Louis and New York. Partly in response to TWA Flight 800 and the age of its fleet, TWA announced a major fleet renewal, ordering 125 new aircraft. TWA paid for naming rights for the new Trans World Dome, home of the then St. Louis Rams, in its corporate hometown. In June 1994, its headquarters moved to One City Centre in downtown St. Louis.

TWA&#x27;s fleet-renewal program included adding newer and smaller, more fuel-efficient, longer-range aircraft such as the Boeing 757 and 767 and short-range aircraft such as the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 and Boeing 717. Aircraft such as the Boeing 727 and 747, along with the Lockheed L-1011 and older DC-9s, some from Ozark and the 1960s, were retired. TWA also became one of the early customers for the Airbus A318 through International Lease Finance Corporation. TWA, had it continued operating through 2003, would have been the first U.S. carrier to fly the type.

TWA had international code-share agreements with Royal Jordanian Airlines, Kuwait Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Air Europa, and Air Malta. In 1997, a code-share agreement was signed with Air Ukraine with plans to begin service between Paris and Kyiv by 1999. Domestic code-share with America West Airlines was started, with long-term plans for a merger considered.

The airlines&#x27; routes were also changed; several international destinations were dropped or changed. The focus of the airline became domestic with a few international routes through its St. Louis hub and smaller New York (JFK) and San Juan, Puerto Rico hubs. Domestically, the carrier improved services with redesigned aircraft and new services, including &quot;Pay in Coach, Fly in First&quot;, whereby coach passengers could be upgraded to first class when flying through St. Louis. Internationally, services were cut. European destinations eventually were limited to London and Paris; and in the Middle East, to Cairo, Riyadh and Tel Aviv.

===2000s===
TWA stated that it planned to make Los Angeles a focus city around October 2000, with a partnership with American Eagle Airlines as part of Trans World Connection.

====Acquisition by American Airlines====
Financial problems soon resurfaced and Trans World Airlines Inc. assets were acquired in April 2001 by AMR Corp., the parent company of American Airlines, which quickly formed a new company called TWA Airlines LLC. As part of the deal, TWA declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy (for the third time) the day after it agreed to the purchase. The terms of the deal included a $745 million payment. The bankruptcy court approved the purchase over a rival bid by Jet Acquisition Group, an investment group fronted by Ralph Atkin, founder of SkyWest Airlines. The total value of TWA&#x27;s assets and assumed liabilities was estimated to be $2 billion. American did not claim the naming rights for the Rams&#x27; home, which eventually became the Edward Jones Dome and later The Dome at America&#x27;s Center.

TWA booking ended on November 30, 2001.

TWA Airlines LLC flew its last flight on December 1, 2001, with an MD-83 aircraft painted in a special inverted livery named &quot;Wings of Pride&quot; (N948TW). The ceremonial last flight was Flight 220 from Kansas City to St. Louis, with CEO Captain William Compton at the controls. The final flight before TWA was &#x27;officially&#x27; absorbed by American Airlines was completed between St. Louis and Las Vegas, Nevada, also on December 1, 2001. At 10:00 pm CST on that date, employees began removing all TWA signs and placards from airports around the country, replacing them with American Airlines signs. At midnight, all TWA flights officially became listed as American Airlines flights. Some aircraft carried hybrid American/TWA livery during the transition, with American&#x27;s tricolor stripe on the fuselage and TWA titles on the tail and forward fuselage. Signage still bears the TWA logo in portions of Concourse D at Lambert St. Louis International Airport.

American Airlines acquired some Ambassadors Clubs; other Ambassadors Clubs closed on December 2, 2001.

TWA&#x27;s St. Louis hub shrank after the acquisition, due to its proximity to American&#x27;s larger hub at Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare International Airport. As a result, American initially replaced TWA&#x27;s St. Louis mainline hub with regional jet service (going from over 800 operations a day to just over 200) and downsized TWA&#x27;s maintenance base in Kansas City. In September 2009, American Airlines announced its intent to shut down the St. Louis hub it inherited from TWA and, in October 2009, American Airlines announced its intent to close the Kansas City maintenance base by September 2010.

==Ongoing heritage==

On December 16, 2013, Doug Parker, CEO of American Airlines Group, announced that TWA heritage aircraft would be added in the future, &quot;We will continue that tradition at American, including introducing a TWA aircraft in the future and keeping a US Airways livery aircraft. That also means we will keep a heritage American livery in the fleet&quot;. On November 16, 2015, American painted a 737-823 in the TWA livery (with American titles, as shown to the right). The last of the TWA MD-83s stayed in service until September 2019. This was the last Trans World Airlines, Inc. aircraft in the American Airlines fleet.

An original lighted TWA sign still exists (as of 2019) on the east side of Saarinen&#x27;s TWA Flight Center terminal facing JetBlue&#x27;s Terminal 5. This sign has been incorporated by the TWA Hotel as part of their use of the TWA Flight Center building.

On May 15, 2019, the TWA Hotel opened in the Flight Center&#x27;s headhouse, after four years of restoration work that began in 2015. In addition to replacing and repairing much of the infrastructure of the building, additional buildings were constructed to house the hotel rooms, with the Flight Center&#x27;s interior being used for the lobby, restaurants and exhibition facilities. In addition, a vintage Lockheed Constellation L-1649 Starliner was acquired and fully restored for use as the hotel&#x27;s cocktail bar, being placed on a section of apron in front of the hotel.

TWA had codeshare agreements with the following airlines:
* Air Europa
* Air Malta
* America West Airlines
* American Airlines
* Kuwait Airways
* Royal Air Maroc
* Royal Jordanian

==Fleet==
===Final fleet===
When Trans World Airlines was acquired by American Airlines in 2001, their fleet contained the following aircraft:

===Retired fleet===
Trans World Airlines had previously operated the following aircraft:

TWA, at one time, also held orders for the BAC-Aérospatiale Concorde, Sud Aviation Caravelle, Boeing 2707, and the Airbus A330-300. The remaining A330 orders were eventually converted to A318 orders. TWA, along with Southwest Airlines and USAir, are the only major U.S.-based airlines to never have operated the McDonnell Douglas DC-10.

===Fleet in 1970===
==Accidents and incidents==
Since 1942, TWA was involved in 84 incidents.

One of the first to gain wide press coverage was the crash of NC1946 (a DC-3), operating as Flight 3, which killed Hollywood film star Carole Lombard, her mother, and 20 others.

On July 11, 1946, a TWA Lockheed Constellation, NC86513, operating as TWA Flight 513, a training flight, crashed in Reading, Pennsylvania. Of six crew members, only one survived. The crash was caused by a fire in the cargo hold and grounded all Constellations from July 12 until August 23, 1946.

Another disaster that gained widespread coverage was the collision of a TWA Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation with a United Airlines&#x27; Douglas DC-7 over the Grand Canyon in 1956, which killed all 128 people on board both airliners. This accident led to groundbreaking changes in the regulation of flight operations in the United States.

A similar event occurred in 1960, this time in New York City, when another TWA L-1049 collided with a United Douglas DC-8. The disaster killed 134 people: 84 on board the UAL DC-8, 44 on board the TWA L-1049, and six people on the ground. No one survived from either airliner.

On June 26, 1959, a TWA Lockheed L-1649 Starliner, N7313C, operating as TWA Flight 891, crashed in a violent thunderstorm after it departed from Malpensa Airport, some 25 miles northwest of Milan, at 16.20. The aircraft was struck by lightning while flying at 11,000 feet above the ground, disintegrated with a tremendous explosion, burst into flames and crashed in several charred parts scattered over an area of five miles

===Terrorist target===

From 1969 to 1986, six TWA airliners were terrorist targets for Palestinian &quot;fedayeen&quot;, four of which were hijackings and two were bombings, mainly because the airline had a strong European presence, was a flag carrier for the United States, and flew to Israel.
* In 1969, TWA Flight 840 from Rome to Athens was hijacked and forcibly diverted to Damascus. Nobody was injured, but the aircraft&#x27;s nose was blown up (although replaced and the plane returned to service).
* In 1970, TWA Flight 741 was hijacked after taking off from Frankfurt am Main en route to New York City. It was taken to Dawson&#x27;s Field in Jordan, along with two other hijacked aircraft. All three aircraft were empty of passengers and crew when they were destroyed. A fourth aircraft landed in Cairo and had a similar fate.
* In 1971, three members of the group &quot;Republic of New Afrika&quot; who had murdered a New Mexico State Police officer on November 8 hijacked TWA Flight 106, a Boeing 727, from Albuquerque to Havana. Passengers were released in Tampa, Florida.
* In 1974, TWA Flight 841 from Tel Aviv to New York City crashed into the Ionian Sea shortly after takeoff from Athens en route to Rome after a bomb believed to have been in the cargo hold exploded, killing all 88 on board.
* In 1976, TWA Flight 355 was hijacked by five Croatian separatists as it flew from New York–LaGuardia to O&#x27;Hare International. They ordered the pilot to fly to Montreal, where the plane was refueled, and then made additional refueling stops in Gander and Keflavik; at some of these stops, the hijackers unloaded propaganda pamphlets that they demanded to be dropped over Montreal, Chicago, New York, London, and Paris. At the plane&#x27;s final stop, Paris–Charles de Gaulle, the hijackers surrendered after direct talks with U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Rush, and their explosives were revealed to be fakes.
* In 1985, TWA Flight 847 from Athens to Rome was hijacked first to Beirut, then to Algiers, back to Beirut, back to Algiers, and finally back to Beirut—with some of its fuel being paid for by the Shell credit card of flight attendant Uli Derickson. United States Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Robert Stethem was singled out by Hezbollah as a member of the American military. The hijackers beat and tortured Stethem; Mohammed Ali Hammadi murdered the dying sailor and dumped his body on the tarmac. Robert Stethem was awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star with burial in Arlington National Cemetery. The memory of Robert Dean Stethem is honored by his nation with a namesake U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS&quot; Stethem&quot; (DDG-63).
* In 1986, TWA Flight 840, on approach to Athens, Greece, was attacked with an on-board bomb, causing four Americans (including a nine-month-old infant) to be ejected from the aircraft to their deaths. Five others on the aircraft were injured as the cabin experienced a rapid decompression. The remaining 110 passengers survived the incident, and pilot Richard &quot;Pete&quot; Petersen made an emergency landing in Athens.

===TWA Flight 800===

TWA&#x27;s worst accident occurred on July 17, 1996, when Flight 800, a Boeing 747 en route to Paris, exploded over the Atlantic Ocean near Long Island, killing all 230 people on board. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the most likely cause of the disaster was a center-fuel-tank explosion sparked by exposed wiring. In their subsequent coverage, the media focused heavily on the fact that TWA&#x27;s airline fleet was among the oldest in service (the 747 used for Flight 800 was manufactured in 1971, making it 25 years old at the time of the incident). The flight was under the command of Captain Steven Snyder, a veteran TWA pilot.

==Crew bases==
TWA had crew bases in Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., St. Louis, Kansas City, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Frankfurt. International flight attendants&#x27; crew bases were located in Paris, Rome, Hong Kong, and, at one time, Cairo. Starting in 1996, TWA had a &quot;West Coast Regional Domicile&quot;, in which pilots and flight attendants covered originating flights out of major West Coast U.S. airports from San Diego, California, north to San Francisco.

==Ambassadors Club==
TWA operated Ambassadors Club locations in various airports. American Airlines acquired some clubs, and other clubs closed on December 2, 2001. Before the closure of the clubs, TWA maintained clubs at:

<text>Dave Matthews Band (also known as DMB) is an American rock band from Charlottesville, Virginia. The band&#x27;s lineup consists of Dave Matthews (lead vocals, guitar), Stefan Lessard (bass), Carter Beauford (drums), Tim Reynolds (lead guitar), Rashawn Ross (trumpet, percussion), Jeff Coffin (saxophones), and Buddy Strong (keyboards). Matthews, Lessard, and Beauford formed the band in 1991 with LeRoi Moore (saxophones), Peter Griesar (keyboards), and Boyd Tinsley (violin, backing vocals). After one independent live album, the band was signed by RCA Records and Griesar left the band to pursue a solo career.

The band&#x27;s 1994 debut studio album, &quot;Under the Table and Dreaming&quot;, was certified six times platinum. , the band had sold more than 25 million concert tickets and a combined total of 38 million CDs and DVDs. Their 2018 album, &quot;Come Tomorrow&quot;, debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making DMB the first band to have seven consecutive studio albums debut at the peak. The band won the 1996 Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for &quot;So Much to Say&quot;. Dave Matthews Band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2024.

A jam band, Dave Matthews Band is renowned for its live shows. The band is known for playing songs differently in each performance; this practice has become a staple of their live shows.

==History==
===Formation (1991–1993)===
In November 1990, lead vocalist and guitarist Dave Matthews, who was working as a bartender at Miller&#x27;s Bar in Charlottesville, Virginia, befriended a lawyer named Ross Hoffman. Hoffman convinced Matthews to record a demo of the few songs Matthews had written and encouraged him to approach Carter Beauford, a local drummer on the Charlottesville music scene. Beauford had been in several bands and was then playing on a jazz show on BET.

After hearing Matthews&#x27;s demo, Beauford agreed to spend some time playing the drums, both inside and outside the studio. Matthews also approached LeRoi Moore, another local jazz musician who often performed with the John D&#x27;earth Quintet, to join them. The trio began working on Matthews&#x27;s songs in 1991. Matthews recollects that, &quot;...the reason I went to Carter was &quot;not&quot; because I needed a drummer, but because I thought he was the baddest thing I&#x27;d ever seen and LeRoi, it wasn&#x27;t because I desperately wanted a saxophone, it was because this guy just blew my mind. At this jazz place I used to bartend at Miller&#x27;s, I would just sit back and watch him. I would be serving the musicians fat whiskeys and they&#x27;d be getting more and more hosed, but no matter how much, he used to still blow my mind. And it was the sense that everyone played from their heart. And when we got together and they asked, &#x27;What do you want the music to sound like?&#x27; I said, &#x27;I know this is a song I wrote and I like what you guys play, so I want you to play the way you react to my song.&#x27; There was a lot of breaking of our inhibitions.&quot;

Matthews later said in an interview with Michael Krugman, &quot;In a way, initially it was just the three of us and I approached them with this tape and they said &#x27;Sure,&#x27; cause they had time on their hands. They were both working on other things, but they had some afternoon time.&quot;

The beginning stages of this new band proved to be, in the words of Morgan Delancey, &quot;a time of trial and incubation.&quot; Beauford would later recall that, &quot;It started out as a three-piece thing with Dave and Leroi...working on some of Dave&#x27;s songs. He only had four songs at the time...And it didn&#x27;t work out with the three of us.&quot; Matthews said, &quot;The first time we played together...we were awful. Not just kind of bad, I mean heinously bad. We tried a couple of different songs and they were all terrible...Sometimes it amazes me that we ever had a second rehearsal.&quot;
Their limited instrumentals did not provide the full sound they desired, however, and more musicians were needed. Upon the recommendation of John D&#x27;earth, Director of Jazz Performance at the University of Virginia and another local musician, Stefan Lessard, a junior bassist at the time, joined the band. In 1991, Miller&#x27;s waiter Peter Griesar became the band&#x27;s first keyboardist. Because of other commitments, violinist Boyd Tinsley did not become a full-time member until 1992. Matthews later admitted, &quot;We had no plans of adding a violinist. We just wanted some fiddle tracked on this one song &quot;Tripping Billies&quot;, and Boyd was a friend of LeRoi. He came in and it just clicked. That completely solidified the band, gave it a lot more power.&quot;

The band&#x27;s first in-studio demo was recorded in February or March 1991, before Tinsley joined as a full-time member, and consisted of &quot;Song That Jane Likes&quot;, &quot;Recently&quot;, &quot;Best of What&#x27;s Around&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Back You Up.&quot;

For years, it was believed that the band&#x27;s first public show was April 21, 1991, at Charlottesville&#x27;s Earth Day Festival. On October 9, 2010, Stefan Lessard reported via Twitter the discovery of an earlier show, taped March 14, 1991, at TRAX, a local music venue. The show was a benefit for the Middle East Children&#x27;s Alliance and, according to Lessard, included the following songs: &quot;Typical Situation&quot;, &quot;Best of What&#x27;s Around&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Back You Up&quot;, &quot;Song That Jane Likes&quot;, &quot;Warehouse&quot;, &quot;Cry Freedom&quot;, and &quot;Recently&quot;. The show included only Matthews, Lessard, Beauford, and Moore. Local weekly appearances soon followed, and word of the band&#x27;s sound spread within a short time.

The band considered calling itself &quot;Dumwelah&quot;, which is the Tswana word for &quot;hello&quot;, but there was little enthusiasm for the name and they decided against it. One story is that Moore reportedly telephoned a place they were booked and said to write &quot;Dave Matthews.&quot; The person receiving the call wrote &quot;band&quot; after the name, and the name stayed Dave Matthews Band from that point on. Matthews told Robert Trott of AP, &quot;Boyd [Tinsley], if memory serves, wrote &#x27;Dave Matthews Band&#x27; [on this flyer for the show]. There was no time when we said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s call this band the Dave Matthews Band.&#x27; It just became that, and it sort of was too late to change when we started thinking that this could focus unfairly on me. People sort of made that association, but it&#x27;s really not like that.&quot;

Beauford seemed to agree with Matthews&#x27;s analysis of the band name when he said to &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine that, &quot;As a matter of fact, that&#x27;s one of the things about this band that everybody likes: There isn&#x27;t a leader. Each one of us can express ourselves musically without being choked by a leader. Everybody can offer what they feel is gonna enhance the music. So, yeah, that&#x27;s the main thing that all the guys — especially me — feel make this band happen. It&#x27;s the freedom that we have to speak with our instruments.&quot;

By the summer of 1991, they were playing at Eastern Standard with Charles Newman as their manager for a brief time. They also continued to play at fraternity functions; the last such show was at UVa at the DKE house on September 11, 1992. Thereafter the band began playing a regular Tuesday night show at the popular Charlottesville club Trax. Tapings of shows at Trax are some of the most widely shared among DMB fans. After Newman, Coran Capshaw, owner of the Flood Zone where the band often played, took the helm of the Dave Matthews Band.

For a variety of reasons, like sensing that the band was on the verge of making it big and not wanting to have his life ruled by the grueling schedule that touring musicians often face, difficulties communicating with Matthews, and maintaining the mortgage on his new home, Peter Griesar decided to leave the band after a show at Trax nightclub on March 23, 1993, a night known as &quot;Big League Chew&quot;.

On November 9, 1993, DMB offered its first official release, &quot;Remember Two Things&quot;, on its Bama Rags label. It was re-released by RCA in 1997. Live songs on the album were recorded at Trax in Charlottesville, Virginia The Flood Zone in Richmond, Virginia, and The Muse Music Club on Nantucket Island. The album debuted on college charts as the highest independent entry, and went on to be certified platinum by the RIAA in 2002.

===Breakthrough to stardom (1994–1999)===

The band released their first live EP, &quot;Recently&quot;, in 1994. The album&#x27;s five tracks were taken from shows performed at The Birchmere in Alexandria, Virginia, and from Trax in Charlottesville. &quot;Recently&quot; was re-released by RCA Records in 1997.

On September 27, 1994, DMB released their debut studio album, &quot;Under the Table and Dreaming&quot;, featuring their first commercial hits &quot;What Would You Say&quot; (featuring John Popper of Blues Traveler on harmonica), &quot;Satellite&quot;, and &quot;Ants Marching&quot;. The album was dedicated &quot;In memory of Anne&quot; for Matthews&#x27;s older sister Anne, who was killed by her husband in 1994 in a murder–suicide. &quot;Under the Table and Dreaming&quot; brought the band worldwide fame and was eventually certified six-times platinum.

&quot;Under the Table and Dreaming&quot; and its follow-up album, &quot;Crash&quot;, brought the band a Grammy Award and four additional Grammy nominations. The band won the 1996 Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group for &quot;So Much to Say&quot;, and was nominated for Best Rock Album for &quot;Crash&quot; and the Best Rock Song for &quot;Too Much&quot;. The band had also been nominated in 1995 for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group and Best Music Video, Short Form, for &quot;What Would You Say&quot;. The band achieved hits with &quot;Crash into Me&quot;, &quot;Too Much&quot;, and &quot;Tripping Billies&quot;.

By 1997, DMB reached unparalleled levels of popularity across the United States and, to some degree, the world. On October 28, 1997, the band released their first full-length live album, &quot;Live at Red Rocks 8.15.95&quot;. The album was recorded at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado, and featured popular songs from the band&#x27;s first three albums and longtime collaborator Tim Reynolds on electric guitar.

In late 1997, the band returned to the studio with producer Steve Lillywhite and an array of guest collaborators, including Reynolds, banjoist Béla Fleck, vocalist Alanis Morissette, future touring band member Butch Taylor, Chapman Stick player Greg Howard, and the Kronos Quartet. They composed and recorded &quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot;, their third album with RCA, released on April 28, 1998. The album represented a great change in direction for the band as they did not rely on upbeat hit singles to carry the album. &quot;Stay (Wasting Time)&quot;, an uplifting gospel number, and &quot;Crush&quot;, a love ballad, became popular along with the lead single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Drink the Water&quot;. Before These Crowded Streets was an instant commercial success, with over 900,000 albums sold worldwide in the first week.

The band took part in the Woodstock &#x27;99 concert during the summer. In the fall, it then released a third live album, &quot;Listener Supported&quot;. The album, a live recording, used a show performed at the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey on September 11, 1999, for a PBS television special. The album was also released as the band&#x27;s first DVD. The year also provided two more Grammy nominations. From their recent album, they earned another Best Rock Album nomination for &quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot;, and a Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals nomination for the song &quot;Crush&quot;.

===Early 2000s===

In 2000, DMB set up their own recording studio at a large countryside home outside Charlottesville. With longtime producer Lillywhite at the helm, the band began work on a fourth studio album. The songs were heavily influenced by personal conflicts, notably the death of Matthews&#x27;s uncle from alcoholism.

In October 2000, an energized Matthews began writing with Glen Ballard, most famous for his work with Alanis Morissette. The rest of DMB (along with special guest Carlos Santana) soon joined Matthews in a Los Angeles studio and quickly recorded &quot;Everyday&quot;. While the album gave the band a fresh start, Ballard&#x27;s production, which featured a pop-rock music sound and no songs over 4:43, was very different from the acoustic sound and long jams that the albums produced by Steve Lillywhite featured (only 8 of the 35 tracks on the previous three albums were under 4:43). Carter Beauford has said that the album was a product of Matthews and Ballard and that it did not showcase the rest of the band. The February 27, 2001, release of &quot;Everyday&quot; was a huge commercial success. The singles &quot;I Did It&quot;, &quot;Everyday&quot;, and &quot;The Space Between&quot; all charted on many &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, including the Hot 100.

In March 2001, the Lillywhite studio sessions from the previous year were leaked over the internet. The tracks spread quickly over established channels like Napster. Collectively known as &quot;The Lillywhite Sessions&quot;, the tracks were lauded by both the fan base and the popular press. After critical comparison of the two albums, fans who were less pleased with &quot;Everyday&quot;&#x27;s more electric sound were frustrated with the band&#x27;s decision to scrap the work of &quot;The Lillywhite Sessions&quot;.

Many of the songs from &quot;The Lillywhite Sessions&quot; would, however, eventually be officially released. In response to overwhelming fan support, coupled with a popular and widely publicized online campaign known as the &quot;Release Lillywhite Recordings Campaign&quot;, DMB returned to the studio in 2002 to record &quot;Busted Stuff&quot;. Produced by Stephen Harris, the recording engineer who worked under Lillywhite on previous albums, the resulting album provided new treatments of much of the &quot;Lillywhite Sessions&quot;″ material, along with newly written songs &quot;You Never Know&quot; and the single &quot;Where Are You Going&quot;, which was subsequently used in the movie &quot;Mr. Deeds&quot;. &quot;Busted Stuff&quot; hit the shelves on July 16, 2002.

During these two years the band released two live albums. The first, &quot;Live in Chicago 12.19.98&quot;, features Tim Reynolds on guitar as well as many other special guests such as bassist Victor Wooten, guitarist Mitch Rutman, and saxophonist Maceo Parker. The second, &quot;Live at Folsom Field, Boulder, Colorado&quot;, highlights songs from both &quot;Everyday&quot; and &quot;Busted Stuff&quot; and was released as both a CD and a DVD.

===2004–2007===
&quot;The Gorge&quot;, a combination 2-CD/1-DVD set with highlights from their three-night 2002 tour-closing stand at The Gorge Amphitheatre in George, Washington, was released on June 29, 2004.
On August 8, 2004, DMB was at the center of a controversy when about 800 pounds of human waste was dumped from Tinsley&#x27;s tour bus through the grate in the Kinzie Street Bridge in Chicago and onto passengers aboard a sightseeing boat on the Chicago River below. On March 9, 2005, the band&#x27;s tour bus driver, Stefan Wohl, pleaded guilty to dumping the bus&#x27;s waste tank into the river, and the band donated $50,000 to the Friends of the Chicago River and $50,000 to the Chicago Park District. In April 2005, the band paid $200,000 to settle the civil lawsuit that followed.

In Fall 2004, DMB returned to their studio in Charlottesville, Virginia, with a new producer. The band decided they wanted to take some chances and pursue a funkier side to their music. To help achieve it, A&amp;R rep Bruce Flohr tracked down producer/songwriter Mark Batson. According to Flohr in an interview with HitQuarters, &quot;When the band and him got together it was instant creative karma. Things took off like a bat out of hell.&quot;

The resultant album, &quot;Stand Up&quot;, was released on May 10, 2005, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard charts with sales of 465,000. &quot;Stand Up&quot; spawned the singles &quot;American Baby&quot;, &quot;Dreamgirl&quot;, and &quot;Everybody Wake Up&quot;. The band also released a video for &quot;Dreamgirl&quot;, featuring Julia Roberts, a long-time fan of the band. Another song from the album, &quot;Steady As We Go&quot;, was featured in an episode of Everwood, and was cited by former campaign aide Andrew Young to be a favorite song of John Edwards and Rielle Hunter during their much-publicized affair.

In March 2005, Dave Matthews Band arrived on Australian shores for the first time, playing shows at Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, and Byron Bay East Coast Blues &amp; Roots Music Festival.

The band supported &quot;Stand Up&quot; with a 54 show, summer-long tour culminating in a four-night stand at Colorado&#x27;s Red Rocks Amphitheatre. The 2005 summer tour also marked the first time Rashawn Ross played with the band. DMB also played a 13-show tour in the fall.
The band returned to the studio along with producer Mark Batson in March 2006, with the resultant album slated for release in winter.

The band worked with Reverb, a non-profit environmental organization, for their 2006 summer tour. Their Labor Day concert at The Gorge Amphitheatre drew a crowd of 64,468, the largest ever for that venue.

In early 2007, the band entered the studio with producers Mark Batson and Steven Miller to begin recording their seventh studio album.

According to Billboard magazine, the band&#x27;s new album had been scheduled to be released in July by RCA Records, but in an interview with the Brisbane Times on May 4, 2007, Stefan Lessard stated, &quot;We&#x27;re on a bit of a creative break as far as working in the studio – we&#x27;ve been in pre-production for a long time, but we&#x27;ll get more serious later in the year.&quot;

On July 7, 2007, Dave Matthews Band performed at the American Live Earth concert at Giants Stadium.

On August 1, 2007, the band kicked off their annual summer tour, which ran 37 dates. &quot;A Dream So Real&quot; would only be played once after the 2007 Summer Tour, at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center on June 21, 2008, featuring Matthews playing keyboard. Supporting acts for the tour included Toots and the Maytals, The Roots, and Robert Randolph and the Family Band.

On September 6, 2007, Dave Matthews Band performed a free concert for the Virginia Tech student body and faculty. The show was entitled &quot;A Concert for Virginia Tech&quot; and was held in memory of the mass shooting that took place on April 16, 2007. John Mayer, Phil Vassar, and Nas joined them. Over 50,000 attended. Two days later, they performed a benefit show at Atlanta&#x27;s Piedmont Park with the Allman Brothers Band opening. Though only 65,000 tickets were sold (50,000 originally, then a second block of 15,000) nearly 20,000 people sneaked into the show, making it the largest one-day concert in Atlanta history. The show raised money for the Piedmont Park Conservancy Association. It was released as a CD/DVD called &quot;Live at Piedmont Park&quot;.

===2008 and the death of LeRoi Moore===
On March 6, 2008, it was revealed that the band had been working with Rob Cavallo on their next album, &quot;Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King&quot;. It was also mentioned that guitarist and longtime friend Tim Reynolds would be recording with the band on the new studio album.

On May 27, 2008, three days before the band embarked on their annual summer tour, it was announced that keyboardist Butch Taylor, who had toured with the band since 2001, had decided to leave the band.

Dave Matthews Band played their last show with all five original members on June 28, 2008, at the Nissan Pavilion in Bristow, Virginia. Two days later, saxophonist LeRoi Moore was injured in an ATV accident on his farm near Charlottesville, Virginia. On July 1, 2008, while in Charlottesville, Dave Matthews announced Moore&#x27;s accident. Béla Fleck and the Flecktones saxophonist Jeff Coffin filled in for Moore for the remainder of the tour. Although he was expected to make a full recovery, Moore died suddenly of complications from the accident on August 19, 2008. The band released a statement through their website which read:

The band proceeded with a scheduled show at the Staples Center in Los Angeles that day, where Matthews announced the death of the band&#x27;s &quot;dear friend&quot; to the crowd.

Despite Moore&#x27;s death, the band continued to play the rest of the tour, cancelling only two shows. They concluded the tour with a benefit concert for lung cancer research (Stand Up for a Cure) at Madison Square Garden in New York City on September 10, for which tickets were exclusive to members of the band&#x27;s fan club, Warehouse.

=== &quot;Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King&quot; (2009) ===
The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King&quot;, was released June 2, 2009, coinciding with a supporting summer tour, slated to run through early October. The band named this album in honor of Moore. Moore is said to be the &quot;King&quot; in the album title. Tim Reynolds, Rashawn Ross, and Jeff Coffin performed with the band on both the spring and the summer tours of 2009 and 2010.

The album peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, achieving platinum status. Three singles from the album were released: &quot;Funny The Way It Is&quot;, &quot;Why I Am&quot;, and &quot;You and Me&quot;.

The album was nominated for two 2010 Grammy Awards: Best Rock Album and Album of the Year. It lost to Green Day&#x27;s &quot;21st Century Breakdown&quot; and Taylor Swift&#x27;s &quot;Fearless&quot;, respectively. During the awards telecast, the band played &quot;You and Me&quot; with accompaniment by singers, percussionists, a string section, and an eight-piece horn section made up of teenagers from the Grammy Jazz Ensemble.

===The 2010s===

The year 2011 marked the 20th anniversary of the band. In March 2010, DMB announced that they would not tour in 2011, the first year in 20 without a scheduled show. On January 19, 2011, the band announced on their website, &quot;2011 is our 20th anniversary as a band and we want to celebrate by playing music together. While we are still taking the year off from touring, we have decided to plan four multi-day, multi-artist music events that will take place this summer. We will be sending out save the date emails and announcing more information soon but we wanted to share the news with our fans first.&quot; On February 22, the first show was announced as being at Bader Field in Atlantic City, New Jersey, with David Gray, Ray LaMontagne, The Flaming Lips, O.A.R., and others, and taking place June 26.

The events started in June and ran for 13 shows. On December 16, 2011, the band released one of the concerts as &quot;Live in Atlantic City&quot;.

On February 14, 2012, DMB announced the dates for a summer tour. The next day it was announced that they were recording a new studio album with producer Steve Lillywhite, who worked with them on &quot;Under the Table and Dreaming&quot;, &quot;Crash&quot;, and &quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot;. Dave Matthews Band kicked off their 43-show 2012 summer tour at The Woodlands, Texas.

The band released its eighth studio album, &quot;Away from the World&quot;, on September 11, 2012. The album saw the return of producer Steve Lillywhite, who had not worked with the band since their collaboration on the never-released &quot;Lillywhite Sessions&quot; in 2000. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, their sixth consecutive studio album to do so, a record at the time.

The band kicked off their 15-show 2012 Winter Tour with a two-night stand in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on November 30 and December 1, 2012.

DMB&#x27;s 45-show 2013 summer tour kicked off at the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion in Woodlands, Texas, on May 17. The tour ended with a show in Mountain View, California, on September 8, 2013. In September 2013, the group announced they would be touring in South Africa, the birthplace of Dave Matthews, for the first time. On that tour, DMB would also be going back to South America performing in Brazil, Argentina, and Chile.

In April 2014, DMB performed five shows in Australia, including the West Coast Blues N Roots Festival and the Byron Bay Bluesfest.

After noticeably struggling at shows in Australia, Tinsley revealed via his Twitter page that he had developed arthritis in his right hand. He underwent surgery to correct carpal tunnel syndrome and stated that he would be ready for the coming tour. Tinsley later made a marked improvement and began playing strongly again towards the beginning of the 2014 Summer Tour.

Dave Matthews Band&#x27;s 42-show 2014 summer tour kicked off in The Woodlands, Texas. The band announced in November 2014 that they would be playing their first show ever in Mexico in 2015. On January 13, 2015, the band announced that they would be going on a summer tour and performing two full sets each evening. The North American tour started in Austin, Texas, on May 13 and concluded in Phoenix, Arizona, on September 13. The band also announced an extensive European tour for the fall of 2015. The tour would commence with the band&#x27;s first-ever show in Abu Dhabi on October 8. After this show, the tour included stops in Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Italy (four shows), Germany (four shows), Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, France, and the United Kingdom (three shows) wrapping up in Ireland on November 13. The tour also included a stop in Poland, marking the first time the band had played there.

In 2016, Dave Matthews Band reached its 25th anniversary and announced an anniversary tour. The 2016 tour ran from May 11 to September 4 with 45 shows in the U.S. and one show in Canada.

On September 24, 2017, Dave Matthews Band organized and hosted &quot;A Concert for Charlottesville: An Evening of Music and Unity&quot;, a free concert to raise funds for the victims killed and injured in a right-wing terrorist attack at the Unite the Right rally in August 2017. Other artists who performed included Cage the Elephant, Coldplay, The Roots, Brittany Howard, Pharrell Williams, Chris Stapleton, Ariana Grande, Justin Timberlake, and Stevie Wonder.

On January 16, 2018, Dave Matthews Band announced a summer 2018 tour along with their ninth studio LP. The title of the album was announced, &quot;Come Tomorrow&quot;, as well as the release date of June 8, 2018. &quot;Come Tomorrow&quot; debuted at No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 292,000 album-equivalent units, making it the biggest sales week for a rock album in over four years and the biggest sales week for an album in 2018. It was their best-selling album since &quot;Big Whiskey and The GrooGrux King&quot;, with 4.3 million sold. It is also their seventh consecutive album to achieve the No. 1 spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, breaking their own previous record.

On February 3, 2018, Tinsley announced that he was taking a leave of absence from the band, citing exhaustion and the need to focus on his health and family. On the same day, lawyers for former Crystal Garden band member James Frost-Winn sent Tinsley a demand letter, formally accusing Tinsley of sexually harassing Frost-Winn over a one-year period, and requesting a settlement. On May 17th, Frost-Winn, then age 28, filed suit against Tinsley. On May 18, 2018, the band confirmed that Tinsley was no longer a member, saying &quot;we are shocked by these disturbing allegations&quot;, and &quot;Boyd has been a member of the family since the band began and we want him to focus on his health and get better. We support his decision to do this and we&#x27;re sending positive thoughts his way.&quot; That same day, the band began their summer tour in The Woodlands, Texas, with new keyboardist Buddy Strong taking a permanent place in the band.

The band played a 47-show summer tour in 2018 in support of the new album. They followed up in the fall with a 12-show arena tour, including two-night stops at Madison Square Garden and the John Paul Jones Arena in their birthplace, Charlottesville.

In 2019, the band headed to Europe for an 18-show spring tour, and in late April once again trekked across the U.S. for their annual summer tour.

=== The 2020s ===
On May 4, 2020, the band announced that all of its 2020 summer dates would be moved to 2021 in light of the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Throughout 2020, Matthews performed on various mutual aid livestreams from his homes in Seattle and Charlottesville, seen by over 400,000 live viewers. The band&#x27;s YouTube channel broadcast weekly &quot;DMB Drive-In&quot; livestreams as a virtual summer tour, replaying many concerts from the band&#x27;s history.

The band announced a reshuffled 2021 tour, becoming one of the first acts to confirm dates for 2021 in anticipation of loosening COVID-19 gathering restrictions. Dave Matthews Band made their return to the stage on July 23, 2021, at Coastal Credit Union Music Park.

Just hours before the band was set to begin their annual three-night Labor Day weekend run at The Gorge Amphitheatre on September 3, 2021, the band&#x27;s Twitter account tweeted that due to COVID-19 protocols, the weekend&#x27;s shows would take place in an &quot;alternate format&quot;. Later that evening, Matthews announced onstage that Carter Beauford and Stefan Lessard had tested positive for the virus. The weekend&#x27;s shows were unique, starting with Matthews playing songs solo, before being joined by Tim Reynolds. Later in the set, Buddy Strong, Jeff Coffin, and Rashawn Ross would join, playing songs with no drums or bass. Later in the shows, Strong moved to drums, while the band was joined by a plethora of special guests throughout the weekend, including Tony Hall, Dumpstaphunk, Robert Randolph and the Family Band, and Mavis Staples. Beauford and Lessard returned the following weekend in Irvine, California.

Shortly before the last two shows of 2021, which were to take place at Madison Square Garden with Dumpstaphunk opening for both shows, it was announced that saxophonist Jeff Coffin had tested positive for COVID-19. Ben Golder-Novick, otherwise known as &quot;Ben the Sax Guy&quot; and original saxophonist for Scott Bradlee&#x27;s Postmodern Jukebox, filled in for Coffin for the last two shows. On November 13, 2021, night two of the two-night run, Alex Wasily and Ashlin Parker, horn players for Dumpstaphunk, joined the band for &quot;Corn Bread&quot; and &quot;Jimi Thing&quot;.

The band announced the 2022 Summer Tour on February 1, 2022. The tour kicked off on May 11 at the Moody Center in Austin, Texas. On May 28, the band announced that weekend&#x27;s shows scheduled in West Palm Beach, Florida, were to be postponed due to a band member testing positive for COVID-19. The summer tour was followed by a fall tour starting on November 2 in Vancouver and concluding seventeen days later with two nights at Madison Square Garden.

On January 20, 2023, the band&#x27;s social media accounts posted a teaser video containing 25 seconds of &quot;Madman&#x27;s Eyes&quot;, a song they debuted in November 2021 and played throughout 2022. The video was captioned, &quot;Excited to bring you something new. 1.24.23&quot;, seemingly alluding to the announcement of an upcoming studio album.

On January 24, the band announced their tenth studio album, &quot;Walk Around the Moon&quot;, which was released on May 19, 2023. &quot;Madman&#x27;s Eyes&quot; was released as the first single, and the tracklist was revealed on streaming platforms. At the same time, the band&#x27;s 2023 Summer Tour was announced with 45 dates starting on May 9 at Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City, and ending with their traditional Labor Day weekend three-night stand at The Gorge Amphitheatre. The band will tour in the fall beginning November 7, 2023 in Savannah, Georgia and concluding November 18 at Madison Square Garden, followed by two shows in South Africa in December.

In 2024, Dave Matthews Band was selected for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. They attended the ceremony in Cleveland on October 19, being inducted by Julia Roberts. The band performed a medley of their hits, and Matthews gave a speech acknowledging figures from early in the band&#x27;s career, and past bandmates, including Tinsley. The band then closed the ceremony with a cover of Talking Heads&#x27; &quot;Burning Down the House&quot;.

===Timeline===
==Performances, taping and fans==
A jam band, Dave Matthews Band is known for its tight, engaging live shows. The band has always encouraged fans to record its performances and was one of rock&#x27;s most bootlegged bands. In fact, a direct patch to the soundboard was made available to recordists until 1995, when some of these tapes found their way into less scrupulous, commercial-minded hands who overcharged fans in the band&#x27;s eyes. The band cites college students trading these tapes in the early 1990s as a key reason for their current fame.

The band is known for playing songs differently each performance; this practice has become a staple of their live shows since the early 1990s.

, the band has sold 20 million concert tickets. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote a feature article in 2023 titled &quot;Why Are Dave Matthews Band Fans So Loyal?&quot;, observing the band has toured &quot;relentlessly&quot; every summer since 1992 and fans have loyally followed them around the country ever since. It noted the similarities with the Grateful Dead with fans seeing hundreds of shows and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on tickets and travel over the course of decades, all the while building friendships and community around the band&#x27;s live shows.

==Awards and nominations==
==Philanthropy==
, the band&#x27;s own charity, the Bama Works Fund, has raised over $65 million and made over 6,500 grants. It was founded in 1999 to address the needs of disadvantaged youth, disabled persons, the environment, and arts and humanities in the city of Charlottesville, Virginia area, and surrounding area of Albemarle, Buckingham, Fluvanna, Greene, Louisa, Nelson, and Orange Counties. In addition, BAMA Works Fund has been active in other projects, and often the Dave Matthews Band, both as a whole and individually, have planned charity events and donated their time and resources outside of Charlottesville. Some examples include building a &quot;Village Recovery Fund&quot; after the tsunami that ravaged Sri Lanka, promoting a challenge grant for the Habitat for Humanity Musician&#x27;s Village in New Orleans, multiple appearances to benefit both Farm Aid and the annual Neil Young-sponsored Bridge School Benefits, fundraisers for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, and followed this with donations after the 2010 disaster that leveled many villages in Haiti. The band played benefit concerts to help fund the school system in New York City, and countless other concerns. As a result, the band was awarded the NAACP chairman&#x27;s Award. In Matthews&#x27;s acceptance speech, he spoke for the band as a whole, commenting that of all the achievements they had enjoyed, that the award by the NAACP and Julian Bond, in particular, was by far the highest honor they had bestowed upon them.

The band donated the $1 million raised during a charity concert to homeless and children&#x27;s charities in San Francisco, California. The band has played other charity concerts benefiting Bay Area parks, music education, and AIDS research.

In June 2016, the band announced that a CD set of Dave Matthews&#x27;s 1996 solo performance at Sweet Briar College would be released later in the summer, with all profits donated to the college, which almost closed in 2015.

In September 2017, Dave Matthews Band organized and hosted &quot;A Concert for Charlottesville: An Evening of Music and Unity&quot;, a free benefit concert to raise funds for the victims killed and injured in a terrorist attack at the Unite the Right rally in August 2017. Other artists who performed included Cage the Elephant, Coldplay, The Roots, Brittany Howard, Pharrell Williams, Chris Stapleton, Ariana Grande, Justin Timberlake, and Stevie Wonder. The concert raised nearly $2 million for victim relief and racial-justice causes.

<doc id="152456" wikidata="Q556137" url="?curid=152456" title="Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud">
<text>Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud (; born 2 March 1949) is a member of the Saudi ruling family, a grandson of King Abdulaziz, military officer, and retired diplomat who served as Saudi Arabia&#x27;s ambassador to the United States from 1983 to 2005. From 2005 to 2015, he served as secretary general of the National Security Council and was director general of the Saudi Intelligence Agency from 2012 to 2014. From 2014 to 2015, he was King Abdullah&#x27;s special envoy.

==Early life==
Bandar was born officially on 2 March 1949 in Taif. By his own account, and according to Western think tanks, his actual date of birth is later. He had reportedly altered his birthday (overstated his age) to enter the Royal Saudi Air Force while a teen.

Bandar&#x27;s parents were Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz and his Ethiopian concubine Khiziran. Both of Bandar&#x27;s parents were very young at the time of his birth: his mother Khiziran was just sixteen, and was working as a maid in the palace when she first came in contact with Sultan. The royal family provided Khiziran with a generous monthly pension after Bandar was born, but told her to take her child and live with her own family.

Bandar thus spent his early years in a non-royal milieu, living with his mother and aunt, and had little contact with his father until he was about eight years old. By this time, the royal family relented and invited Khiziran to bring Bandar with her and live in the palace with Prince Sultan&#x27;s widowed mother, Hassa bint Ahmed Al Sudairi. Khiziran died in Riyadh in October 2019.

==Education==
Bandar graduated from the Royal Air Force College Cranwell in 1968. He received additional training at Maxwell Air Force Base and the Industrial College of the Armed Forces. He is a trained pilot and has flown numerous fighter aircraft. Bandar&#x27;s military career ended in 1977 after he crash-landed his jet and suffered a severe back injury. Afterward, he received a master&#x27;s degree in international public policy at the Johns Hopkins University&#x27;s Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies.

One of his classmates in Cranwell was Bandar bin Faisal, son of King Faisal and his future brother-in-law.

==Initial career==

Bandar joined the Royal Saudi Air Force, and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. His diplomatic career began in 1978 when he was appointed the King Khalid&#x27;s personal envoy. He successfully lobbied the United States Congress to approve the sale of F-15s to Saudi Arabia. In the Oval Office, President Carter advised him to win the support of California governor Ronald Reagan. He did and in exchange helped Carter win the support of South Dakota Democratic Senator James Abourezk for the Panama Canal treaty. Crown Prince Fahd made Bandar an emissary to Carter and granted him permission to act independently of the Saudi-U.S. ambassador.

In 1982, King Fahd made him the military attache at the Saudi Embassy, a move which could have ended his diplomatic career. However, in 1983, Fahd appointed Bandar as Saudi Ambassador to the United States.

==Ambassador to the United States (1983–2005)==
On 24 October 1983 Bandar was appointed ambassador to the United States by King Fahd. He replaced Faisal Alhegelan in the post. During his tenure as ambassador and, before that, the king&#x27;s personal envoy to Washington, he dealt with five U.S. presidents, ten secretaries of state, eleven national security advisers, sixteen sessions of Congress, and the media. He had extensive influence in the United States. At the pinnacle of his career, he served both &quot;as the King&#x27;s exclusive messenger and the White House&#x27;s errand boy&quot;. For over three decades, he was the face of the Saudi Arabia lobby. The U.S. is widely seen as one of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s most essential allies, but different members of the royal family feel different mixtures of trust and suspicion of the United States. Therefore, Prince Bandar&#x27;s intimate relationships with U.S. leaders and policy-makers are considered to be both the source of his power base in the kingdom, as well as the cause of suspicions within the royal family that he is too close to U.S. political figures.

===Reagan era===

During the Reagan Era, he secured the purchase of AWACs surveillance aircraft despite opposition from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. The $5.5 billion deal was the beginning of a $200 billion deal for the purchase of American weapons for Saudi Arabia, which included a slush fund that the CIA could direct for its off-the-budget projects. For example, at CIA request, Prince Bandar deposited $10 million in a Vatican bank used to meddle in Italian elections by undermining the Italian Communist Party. The Al-Yamamah arms deal between Britain and Saudi Arabia included diverting hundreds of millions of British pounds stretching over more than a decade to Prince Bandar through a Saudi Arabian government bank account at Riggs Bank, but some of the money was used to fund secret CIA projects off-the-budget. According Robert Lacey these payments to Prince Bandar amounted to more than a billion British pounds. After the United States rejected an arms order, he arranged the delivery of intermediate-range nuclear-warhead-capable missiles from China. This angered the Central Intelligence Agency and the United States Department of State. Pursuant to an understanding with the CIA, Prince Bandar provided $32 million to the U.S.-backed terrorist militants, the Contras, through a Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) account, as part of what later became known as the Iran-Contra scandal. Nancy Reagan used him to relay messages to the Cabinet.

===Clinton era===
Clinton, as governor of Arkansas, had asked him to help pay for the Middle East Studies Center at the University of Arkansas. In the 1990s, he persuaded Libyan president Muammar Gaddafi to turn in two suspects allegedly involved in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. He privately described Gaddafi as &quot;a Jerry Lewis trying to be a Churchill&quot;.

In the first autumn of Clinton&#x27;s presidency, September 1993, Prince Bandar was appointed Dean of the Diplomatic Corps, and he continued the role until the second term of George W. Bush&#x27;s presidency.

===Bush presidencies===
Bandar formed close relationships with several American presidents, notably George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush, his closeness to the latter gaining him the affectionate and controversial nickname &#x27;Bandar Bush&#x27;. His particularly close relationship with the Bush family was highlighted in Michael Moore&#x27;s documentary &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;. He was reportedly so close to George H. W. Bush that he was often described as a member of the former president&#x27;s family. He advocated Saddam Hussein&#x27;s overthrow in Iraq in March 2003. He encouraged military action against Iraq and supported Dick Cheney&#x27;s agenda for &quot;The New Middle East&quot;, which called for pro-democracy programs in both Syria and Iran.

===Resignation===
On 26 June 2005, Bandar submitted his resignation as ambassador to the United States for &quot;personal reasons&quot;. The official end date of his term was 8 September 2005. Bandar returned to Saudi Arabia weeks prior to the death of King Fahd, upon which Bandar&#x27;s father, Sultan bin Abdulaziz, became the nation&#x27;s crown prince. It was rumored that Bandar&#x27;s return was timed in order to secure a position in the new government.

Prince Bandar was succeeded as ambassador by Prince Turki Al Faisal. Nevertheless, even after leaving the ambassadorship, Bandar continued to maintain strong relationships within the Bush administration and to meet with high-ranking White House staff even after Prince Turki took over the post; Turki gave up the ambassador&#x27;s job after only 18 months.

==Secretary General of National Security Council (2005–2015)==
In October 2005, King Abdullah appointed Bandar bin Sultan as secretary-general of the newly created National Security Council.

Bandar secretly met with U.S. officials in 2006 after resigning as ambassador. Seymour Hersh reported in 2007 in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that as Saudi Arabia&#x27;s national security adviser, Bandar continued to meet privately with both President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. At that time Hersh described Bandar as a key architect of the Bush administration policy in Iraq and the Middle East.

On 25 January 2007, Saudi Arabia sent Bandar to Iran for discussions on the crisis in Lebanon and the Kingdom even held talks with Hizballah leaders, whom he had invited for the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. After tensions with Qatar over supplying rebel groups, Saudi Arabia (under Bandar&#x27;s leadership of its Syria policy) switched its efforts from Turkey to Jordan in 2012, using its financial leverage over Jordan to develop training facilities there, with Bandar sending his half-brother and deputy Salman bin Sultan to oversee them.

Bandar&#x27;s tenure as secretary general was extended for four years on 3 September 2009. His term ended on 29 January 2015. The office was also abolished on the same day.

===Disappearance and rumors===
After King Abdullah renewed Bandar&#x27;s post on the National Security Council for an additional 4-year term in September 2009, Bandar failed to make the customary public demonstration of his allegiance to him. This noticeable absence was followed by others: an avid fan of the Dallas Cowboys, Bandar did not appear in his customary seat—next to owner Jerry Jones in Jones&#x27;s skybox—for the home opener of the new Cowboys Stadium. In October 2009, he was not present in King Abdullah&#x27;s delegation for the watershed Damascus visit. Most strikingly, in December 2009, Prince Bandar was not present for the return of his father, Crown Prince Sultan, from Morocco. After that event, journalists began to report on Bandar&#x27;s disappearance, noting that his last appearance in public had been with King Abdullah in Jeddah on 10 December 2008.

Hugh Miles of the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; reported rumors that Bandar was undergoing surgery at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Bandar&#x27;s lawyer denied these rumors; he has no spokesman.

&quot;Le Figaro&quot;&#x27;s Middle East blog reported that Bandar had been in a hospital in France, and was recuperating in Morocco.

Iran&#x27;s Press TV reported that Bandar was under house arrest for an attempted coup. Saudi opposition sources said he was in Dhaban Prison. Some rumors alleged that his coup was exposed by Russian intelligence services because of his frequent trips to Moscow to encourage cooperation against Iran.

In October 2010, Middle East analyst Simon Henderson reported in &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; that Prince Bandar had made his first public appearance in almost two years. Citing official Saudi media, Henderson reported that Bandar had been greeted at the airport by &quot;a virtual who&#x27;s who of Saudi political figures.&quot; Henderson noted that no explanation had been given for the Prince&#x27;s whereabouts for the previous two years—the only detail was that he had returned &quot;from abroad.&quot; Henderson and other analysts viewed this reemergence as a sign of Bandar&#x27;s rehabilitation into the active politics of the kingdom.

In what was perceived as a return to prominence, in March 2011, Bandar was sent to Pakistan, India, Malaysia, and China to gather support for Saudi Arabia&#x27;s military intervention in Bahrain. In April 2011, Bandar was present in meetings when U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates visited King Abdullah and in a separate visit by National Security Advisor Tom Donilon.

The other goal of his late March 2011 visit to Islamabad was to raise the prospect of a return engagement for the Pakistan Army. The goal was achieved, and Pakistan quickly approved the proposal. His visit to China during the same period resulted in the issuing of lucrative contracts in return for political support. Since China was not a friend of the Arab Spring, it was eager for Saudi oil and investment. Bandar secretly negotiated the first big Saudi-Chinese arms deal. Thus, Bandar was the Kingdom&#x27;s premier China expert.

==Director General of Saudi Intelligence Agency (2012–2014)==
Bandar was appointed director general of Saudi Intelligence Agency on 19 July 2012 replacing Muqrin bin Abdulaziz. Although no official reason for the appointment was provided, the appointment occurred after growing tension between Sunnis and Shiites in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. It was also considered as a move of Saudi Arabia to display more aggressive foreign policy given the regional challenges that comes from Iran and Syria. Prince Bandar is also a member of the Military Service Council.

Bandar organised the visit of Manaf Tlass, who defected from Syria on 6 July 2012, to Saudi Arabia in the last week of July 2012.

In 2013 Bandar said that the Saudis would &quot;shift away&quot; from the United States over Syrian and Iranian policy.

According to a number of articles, Bandar, allegedly confronted Vladimir Putin in a bid to break the deadlock over Syria. This included security of winter Olympics in Sochi if there is no accord. &quot;I can give you a guarantee to protect the Winter Olympics next year. The Chechen groups that threaten the security of the games are controlled by us,&quot; he allegedly said. Putin then rejected the proposal furiously by saying &quot;we know that you have supported the Chechen terrorist groups for a decade. And that support, which you have frankly talked about just now, is completely incompatible with the common objectives of fighting global terrorism that you mentioned.&quot;

Bandar had been tasked with managing Saudi policy in the Syrian Civil War, but he was replaced in early 2014 by interior minister Prince Muhammad bin Nayef. Bandar took a confrontational tone with the United States and was called a &quot;problem&quot; privately by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. However, Bandar had also been struggling with poor health stemming from the 1977 plane crash, leading to speculation that this was why he was replaced.

Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki reportedly complained about secret Saudi Arabian support for militant groups saying, &quot;They are attacking Iraq, through Syria and in a direct way, and they announced war on Iraq, as they announced it on Syria, and unfortunately it is on a sectarian and political basis.&quot;

===Assassination rumors===
In July 2012, the rumours of his assassination were reported by DEBKAfile and later published in &quot;Tehran Times&quot;. This news was denied by &quot;Arab News&quot; and the journalist David Ignatius.

In August 2013, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Bandar had been appointed to lead Saudi Arabia&#x27;s efforts to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. According these reports Bandar acted as the lynchpin in arming the jihadis fighting Assad. The US Central Intelligence Agency considered this a sign of how serious Saudi Arabia was about this aim. The &quot;Journal&quot; reported that in late 2012 Saudi intelligence, under Bandar&#x27;s direction, began efforts to convince the US that the Assad government was using chemical weapons.

Bandar was also described as &quot;jetting from covert command centers near the Syrian front lines to the Élysée Palace in Paris and the Kremlin in Moscow, seeking to undermine the Assad regime.&quot; He had a simple message: my kingdom has the money needed to defeat Assad—and we&#x27;re ready to use it.

On 15 April 2014, Bandar was removed from his position &quot;at his own request&quot; according to the announcement in the Saudi state media. He remained as secretary general of the National Security Council until it was abolished in January 2015.

==Views==
Bandar considers himself an American Hamiltonian conservative. Before the 2000 U.S. presidential election was decided, he invited George H. W. Bush to go pheasant shooting on his English estate in a &quot;Desert Storm reunion&quot;. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, in an interview in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he stated, &quot;Bin Laden used to come to us when &quot;America&quot; through the CIA and Saudi Arabia were helping our brother mujahideen in Afghanistan to get rid of the communist secularist Soviet Union forces. Osama bin Laden came and said &#x27;Thank you. Thank you for bringing the Americans to help us.&#x27; At that time, I thought he couldn&#x27;t lead eight ducks across the street.&quot;

Bandar argued some researchers &quot;learn to speak a few words of Arabic and call themselves experts about the affairs of my country.&quot;

==Honours and awards==
Bandar is the recipient of the Order of Abdulaziz Al Saud, the Hawk Flying Medal of Aviation and the King Faisal Medal. In 2001, he was awarded an honorary degree of doctor of law by Howard University. In 2002, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Quincy Jones at a ceremony in Dublin, Ireland.

==Controversy==
Bandar endured controversy over allegations in the book &quot;Plan of Attack&quot; by Bob Woodward that President George W. Bush informed him of the decision to invade Iraq ahead of Secretary of State Colin Powell. 
Bandar helped negotiate the 1985 Al Yamamah deal, a series of massive arms sales by the United Kingdom to Saudi Arabia worth £40 billion, including the sale of more than 100 warplanes. After the deal was signed, British arms manufacturer British Aerospace (now BAE Systems) allegedly funnelled secret payments of at least £1 billion into two Saudi embassy accounts in Washington, in yearly instalments of up to £120 million over at least 10 years. He allegedly took money for personal use out of the accounts, as the purpose of one of the accounts was to pay the operating expenses of his private Airbus A340. According to investigators, there was &quot;no distinction between the accounts of the embassy, or official government accounts [...], and the accounts of the royal family.&quot; The payments were discovered during a Serious Fraud Office investigation, which was stopped in December 2006 by attorney general Lord Goldsmith. In 2009, he hired Louis Freeh as his legal representative for the Al-Yamamah arms scandal.

A court affidavit filed on 3 February 2015 claims that Zacarias Moussaoui was a courier between Osama bin Laden and Turki bin Faisal Al Saud in the late 1990s, and that Turki introduced Moussaoui to Bandar. Zacarias Moussaoui stated on oath and wrote to Judge George B. Daniels that Saudi royal family members, including Prince Bandar, donated to Al-Qaeda and helped finance the 11 September attacks. The Saudi government continues to deny any involvement in the 9/11 plot, and claims there is no evidence to support Moussaoui&#x27;s allegations in spite of numerous previous intense investigations, noting that Moussaoui&#x27;s own lawyers presented evidence of his mental incompetence during his trial. Leaked information from the redacted portion of the 9/11 Commission Report states that two of the 9/11 hijackers&#x27; Saudi handler received $US130,000 in payment from Bandar&#x27;s bank account.

==Personal life==
In 1972, Bandar married Haifa bint Faisal, with whom he had eight children: four sons and four daughters.

His daughter Princess Reema bint Bandar, who was formerly married to Faisal bin Turki bin Nasser Al Saud, is the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the United States, being the first woman to hold such position in the Kingdom. His son Khalid is the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the United Kingdom and is married to Lucy Cuthbert, niece of Ralph Percy, 12th Duke of Northumberland. Another of his sons, Faisal, has been the president of the Saudi Arabian Federation for Electronic and Intellectual Sports (SAFEIS) and the Arab eSports Federation since 2017.

The youngest two (Hussa and Abdulaziz) attended Potomac School in McLean, Virginia, while living in Washington from 2001 to 2005. Abdulaziz also attended Abingdon School from 2008 to 2010.

===Habits and health concerns===
Known for his cigar smoking, he usually wears European clothes, and he likes American colloquialisms and American history. In the mid-1990s, he suffered his first depression. His health problems were reported to have continued into the 2010s, often being treated abroad.

===Property===
He travels frequently on his private Airbus A340. He owned Glympton Park, Oxfordshire, until March 2021 when he sold the property to the King of Bahrain’s family.

Bandar owned an estate with a 32-room house in Aspen, Colorado. He bought the land in 1989 and built the residence in 1991. On 12 July 2006, it was reported that Prince Bandar was seeking to sell his mansion in Aspen, Colorado, for US$135 million. The palatial vacation home, called Hala Ranch, is larger than the White House, is perched on a mountaintop of , and includes 15 bedrooms and 16 bathrooms featuring 24-karat gold fixtures. In December 2006, the mansion was still listed for sale at $135 million. In December 2007, the guesthouse was sold for a reported $36.5 m. The purported reason for the sale is that Bandar was too busy to enjoy the mansion. Finally, he sold his Aspen ranch for $49 million to Starwood Mountain Ranch LLC in June 2012. It is reported that billionaire John Paulson bought Hala Ranch, and Paulson confirmed this.

===Membership===
Bandar is a board member of the Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al Saud Foundation.

===Donations===
In 1990, Bandar donated an unknown amount to finance construction of the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies (OCIS).

<text>Futurebus (IEEE 896) is a computer bus standard designed to replace all local bus connections in a computer, including the CPU, plug-in cards, and even some LAN links between machines. The project started in 1979 and was completed in 1987, but then went through a redesign until 1994. It has seen little real-world use, although custom implementations are still designed.

== History ==
In the late 1970s, VMEbus was faster than the parts plugged into it. It can connect a CPU and RAM to VME on separate cards to build a computer. However, as the speed of the CPUs and RAM rapidly increased, Futurebus created a successor to VMEbus using asynchronous links. Though the ability to have several cards in the system as &quot;masters&quot;, allowing Futurebus to build multiprocessor machines, required some form of &quot;distributed arbitration&quot; to allow the various cards to gain access to the bus at any point, as opposed to VME, which put a single master in slot 0 with overall control.

Typical IEEE standards start with a company building a device, then submitting it to the IEEE for the standardization effort. In the case of Futurebus, the whole system was being designed during the standardization effort. It took eight years before the specification was finally agreed on in 1987. Tektronix did make a few workstations based on Futurebus. It took another four years for the Futurebus+ Standard to be released. The IEEE 896 committee later split from the IEEE Microcomputer Standards Committee and formed the IEEE Bus Architecture Standards Committee (BASC).

Futurebus+ transceivers that meet the IEEE Standard 1194.1-1991 Backplane Transceiver Logic (BTL) standard are still made by Texas Instruments. Futurebus+ was used as the I/O bus in the DEC 4000 AXP and DEC 10000 AXP systems. Futurebus+ FDDI boards are still supported in the OpenVMS operating system.

<text>QuickRing was a gigabit-rate interconnect that combined the functions of a computer bus and a network. It was designed at Apple Computer as a multimedia system to run &quot;on top&quot; of existing local bus systems inside a computer, but was later taken over by National Semiconductor and repositioned as an interconnect for parallel computing. It appears to have seen little use in either role, and is no longer being actively worked on. However it appears to have been an inspiration for other more recent technologies, such as HyperTransport.

== History ==

QuickRing started as an offshoot of the fabled Futurebus project, which started in the late 1970s under the aegis of the IEEE. The Futurebus process quickly bogged down, and concluding it was doomed, several of the main designers left the effort in 1987 to try again on smaller projects, leading to both QuickRing and SCI. In the case of QuickRing the main proponent was Paul Sweazey of National Semiconductor, who had hosted Futurebus&#x27;s cache coherency group. Sweazey left National Semiconductor and moved to Apple Computer&#x27;s Advanced Technology Group, where the new system was developed.

The system was first announced publicly at the 1992 Worldwide Developers Conference, positioned primarily as a secondary bus for computer systems to carry multiple streams of digital video without using the existing backplane bus. Apple was particularly interested in this role due to the limitations of their current NuBus systems in terms of speed. They envisioned various video cards using a second connector located near the top of the card, opposite the NuBus connector on the bottom, to talk to each other. Optionally, one of the cards would produce compressed output, which could be sent over the NuBus for storage or display. Before any commercial use of QuickRing, newer versions of PCI started appearing that offered performance close enough to QuickRing to make its role redundant. Apple switched to an all-PCI based computer lineup starting in 1995, and in one of their general downsizings in the early 90s, Apple dropped their funding for QuickRing.

Sweazey moved back to National Semiconductor, who positioned QuickRing as a high-speed interconnect. Here it had little better luck, competing against SCI on one hand, and ever-faster versions of Ethernet on the other. Efforts were made to standardize QuickRing inside the existing VMEbus system using some redundant pins in response to an industry effort to standardize parallel processing hardware, but nothing ever came of this. The US Navy announced several tenders for QuickRing products for sonar data processing (for which they had originally had Futurebus+ developed), but it is unclear whether or not it was actually used in this role. National eventually lost interest, and the system essentially disappeared in 1996. Similar products, notably SKYconnect and Raceway, were also standardized in this role, but seem to have seen little use as well.

== Description ==

The basic QuickRing system consisted of a number of single-direction 1-bit serial links carrying data, and one extra line carrying a 50 MHz clock signal. Apple&#x27;s implementation consisted of six data lines and the clock line using twisted-pair copper wiring (using LVDS) embedded in a thin plastic strip. National Semiconductor offered a variety of different implementations with up to 32 data lines, as well as the same signals multiplexted using frequency-division multiplexing in a single fibre optic cable for longer links between machines.

The data lines were clocked at seven times the clock signal, so each clock &quot;tick&quot; moved 7 bits of data over each of the bus lines. For the Apple implementation this meant 7 bits times 6 links at 50 million times a second, for a raw data rate of 2.1 Gbit/s. Ten bits of the 42 were used for signalling and control, leaving 32 for data, resulting in a net data transfer rate of 1.6 Gbit/s, or 200 MB/s. This was only slightly faster than contemporary (1993) versions of PCI at ~130 MB/s, but much faster than NuBus of the same era, at about 20 MB/s.

Each QuickRing interface contained two such links, one for &quot;upstream&quot; and one for &quot;downstream&quot; connections in a point-to-point ring. Since the system was not a bus, machines could talk up and downstream at the same time without interfering with other users. The drawback was that each hop over an intervening point added a latency of up to 1.3 μs. Since QuickRing was built in a ring topology there was no need for a dedicated switch or router, potentially making the system lower cost to deploy. Two rings could be connected together by putting the bus IC&#x27;s &quot;back to back&quot; in a switch, allowing for larger networks.

QuickRing routing used a circuit switching system, in which the message path is set up before the data is sent, and once set up the connection is very lightweight. This is as opposed to packet switching, in which every message contains all of the data needed to reach the destination, this is more flexible, but adds overhead. Of the 10 bits of control data, four were used to specify a circuit number, allowing for a total of 16 devices per ring.

<text>Nuclides (or nucleides, from nucleus, also known as nuclear species) are a class of atoms characterized by their number of protons, &quot;Z&quot;, their number of neutrons, &quot;N&quot;, and their nuclear energy state.

The word &quot;nuclide&quot; was coined by the American nuclear physicist Truman P. Kohman in 1947. Kohman defined &quot;nuclide&quot; as a &quot;species of atom characterized by the constitution of its nucleus&quot; containing a certain number of neutrons and protons. The term thus originally focused on the nucleus.

==Nuclides vs isotopes==
A nuclide is a species of an atom with a specific number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus, for example carbon-13 with 6 protons and 7 neutrons. The nuclide concept (referring to individual nuclear species) emphasizes nuclear properties over chemical properties, while the isotope concept (grouping all atoms of each element) emphasizes chemical over nuclear. The neutron number has large effects on nuclear properties, but its effect on chemical reactions is negligible for most elements. Even in the case of the very lightest elements, where the ratio of neutron number to atomic number varies the most between isotopes, it usually has only a small effect, but it matters in some circumstances. For hydrogen, the lightest element, the isotope effect is large enough to affect biological systems strongly. In the case of helium, helium-4 obeys Bose–Einstein statistics, while helium-3 obeys Fermi–Dirac statistics. Since &quot;isotope&quot; is the older term, it is better known than &quot;nuclide&quot;, and is still occasionally used in contexts in which &quot;nuclide&quot; might be more appropriate, such as nuclear technology and nuclear medicine.

==Types of nuclides==

Although the words nuclide and isotope are often used interchangeably, being isotopes is actually only one relation between nuclides. The following table names some other relations.


A set of nuclides with equal proton number (atomic number), i.e., of the same chemical element but different neutron numbers, are called isotopes of the element. Particular nuclides are still often loosely called &quot;isotopes&quot;, but the term &quot;nuclide&quot; is the correct one in general (i.e., when &quot;Z&quot; is not fixed). In similar manner, a set of nuclides with equal mass number &quot;A&quot;, but different atomic number, are called isobars (isobar = equal in weight), and isotones are nuclides of equal neutron number but different proton numbers. Likewise, nuclides with the same neutron excess (&quot;N&quot; − &quot;Z&quot;) are called isodiaphers. The name isotone was derived from the name isotope to emphasize that in the first group of nuclides it is the number of neutrons (n) that is constant, whereas in the second the number of protons (p).

See Isotope#Notation for an explanation of the notation used for different nuclide or isotope types.

Nuclear isomers are members of a set of nuclides with equal proton number and equal mass number (thus making them by definition the same isotope), but different states of excitation. An example is the two states of the single isotope shown among the decay schemes. Each of these two states (technetium-99m and technetium-99) qualifies as a different nuclide, illustrating one way that nuclides may differ from isotopes (an isotope may consist of several different nuclides of different excitation states).

The longest-lived non-ground state nuclear isomer is the nuclide tantalum-180m (), which has a half-life in excess of 1,000 trillion years. This nuclide occurs primordially, and has never been observed to decay to the ground state. (In contrast, the ground state nuclide tantalum-180 does not occur primordially, since it decays with a half life of only 8 hours to 180Hf (86%) or 180W (14%).)

There are 251 nuclides in nature that have never been observed to decay. They occur among the 80 different elements that have one or more stable isotopes. See stable nuclide and primordial nuclide. Unstable nuclides are radioactive and are called radionuclides. Their decay products (&#x27;daughter&#x27; products) are called radiogenic nuclides.

==Origins of naturally occurring radionuclides==
Natural radionuclides may be conveniently subdivided into three types. First, those whose half-lives t1/2 are at least 2% as long as the age of the Earth (for practical purposes, these are difficult to detect with half-lives less than 10% of the age of the Earth) (). These are remnants of nucleosynthesis that occurred in stars before the formation of the Solar System. For example, the isotope (t1/2 = ) of uranium is still fairly abundant in nature, but the shorter-lived isotope (t1/2 = ) is 138 times rarer. About 34 of these nuclides have been discovered (see List of nuclides and Primordial nuclide for details).

The second group of radionuclides that exist naturally consists of radiogenic nuclides such as (t1/2 = ), an isotope of radium, which are formed by radioactive decay. They occur in the decay chains of primordial isotopes of uranium or thorium. Some of these nuclides are very short-lived, such as isotopes of francium. There exist about 51 of these daughter nuclides that have half-lives too short to be primordial, and which exist in nature solely due to decay from longer lived radioactive primordial nuclides.

The third group consists of nuclides that are continuously being made in another fashion that is not simple spontaneous radioactive decay (i.e., only one atom involved with no incoming particle) but instead involves a natural nuclear reaction. These occur when atoms react with natural neutrons (from cosmic rays, spontaneous fission, or other sources), or are bombarded directly with cosmic rays. The latter, if non-primordial, are called cosmogenic nuclides. Other types of natural nuclear reactions produce nuclides that are said to be nucleogenic nuclides.

An example of nuclides made by nuclear reactions, are cosmogenic (radiocarbon) that is made by cosmic ray bombardment of other elements, and nucleogenic which is still being created by neutron bombardment of natural as a result of natural fission in uranium ores. Cosmogenic nuclides may be either stable or radioactive. If they are stable, their existence must be deduced against a background of stable nuclides, since every known stable nuclide is present on Earth primordially.

==Artificially produced nuclides==
Beyond the naturally occurring nuclides, more than 3000 radionuclides of varying half-lives have been artificially produced and characterized.

The known nuclides are shown in Table of nuclides. A list of primordial nuclides is given sorted by element, at List of elements by stability of isotopes. List of nuclides is sorted by half-life, for the 905 nuclides with half-lives longer than one hour.

==Summary table for numbers of each class of nuclides==
This is a summary table for the 905 nuclides with half-lives longer than one hour, given in list of nuclides. Note that numbers are not exact, and may change slightly in the future, if some &quot;stable&quot; nuclides are observed to be radioactive with very long half-lives.

==Nuclear properties and stability ==
Atomic nuclei other than hydrogen have protons and neutrons bound together by the residual strong force. Because protons are positively charged, they repel each other. Neutrons, which are electrically neutral, stabilize the nucleus in two ways. Their copresence pushes protons slightly apart, reducing the electrostatic repulsion between the protons, and they exert the attractive nuclear force on each other and on protons. For this reason, one or more neutrons are necessary for two or more protons to be bound into a nucleus. As the number of protons increases, so does the ratio of neutrons to protons necessary to ensure a stable nucleus (see graph). For example, although the neutron–proton ratio of is 1:2, the neutron–proton ratio of is greater than 3:2. A number of lighter elements have stable nuclides with the ratio 1:1 (). The nuclide (calcium-40) is observationally the heaviest stable nuclide with the same number of neutrons and protons. All stable nuclides heavier than calcium-40 contain more neutrons than protons.

===Even and odd nucleon numbers===
The proton–neutron ratio is not the only factor affecting nuclear stability. It depends also on even or odd parity of its atomic number &quot;Z&quot;, neutron number &quot;N&quot; and, consequently, of their sum, the mass number &quot;A&quot;. Oddness of both &quot;Z&quot; and &quot;N&quot; tends to lower the nuclear binding energy, making odd nuclei, generally, less stable. This remarkable difference of nuclear binding energy between neighbouring nuclei, especially of odd-&quot;A&quot; isobars, has important consequences: unstable isotopes with a nonoptimal number of neutrons or protons decay by beta decay (including positron decay), electron capture or more exotic means, such as spontaneous fission and cluster decay.

The majority of stable nuclides are even-proton–even-neutron, where all numbers &quot;Z&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, and &quot;A&quot; are even. The odd-&quot;A&quot; stable nuclides are divided (roughly evenly) into odd-proton–even-neutron, and even-proton–odd-neutron nuclides. Odd-proton–odd-neutron nuclides (and nuclei) are the least common.

<doc id="152465" wikidata="Q186029" url="?curid=152465" title="Optic nerve">
<text>In neuroanatomy, the optic nerve, also known as the second cranial nerve, nerve of kurnick, cranial nerve II, or simply CN II, is a paired cranial nerve that transmits visual information from the retina to the brain. In humans, the optic nerve is derived from optic stalks during the seventh week of development and is composed of retinal ganglion cell axons and glial cells; it extends from the optic disc to the optic chiasma and continues as the optic tract to the lateral geniculate nucleus, pretectal nuclei, and superior colliculus.

==Structure==
The optic nerve has been classified as the second of twelve paired cranial nerves, but it is technically a myelinated tract of the central nervous system, rather than a classical nerve of the peripheral nervous system because it is derived from an out-pouching of the diencephalon (optic stalks) during embryonic development. As a consequence, the fibers of the optic nerve are covered with myelin produced by oligodendrocytes, rather than Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system, and are encased within the meninges. Peripheral neuropathies like Guillain–Barré syndrome do not affect the optic nerve. However, most typically, the optic nerve is grouped with the other eleven cranial nerves and is considered to be part of the peripheral nervous system.

The optic nerve is ensheathed in all three meningeal layers (dura, arachnoid, and pia mater) rather than the epineurium, perineurium, and endoneurium found in peripheral nerves. Fiber tracts of the mammalian central nervous system have only limited regenerative capabilities compared to the peripheral nervous system. Therefore, in most mammals, optic nerve damage results in irreversible blindness. The fibers from the retina run along the optic nerve to nine primary visual nuclei in the brain, from which a major relay inputs into the primary visual cortex.
The optic nerve is composed of retinal ganglion cell axons and glia. Each human optic nerve contains between 770,000 and 1.7 million nerve fibers, which are axons of the retinal ganglion cells of one retina. In the fovea, which has high acuity, these ganglion cells connect to as few as 5 photoreceptor cells; in other areas of the retina, they connect to thousands of photoreceptors.

The optic nerve leaves the orbit (eye socket) via the optic canal, running postero-medially towards the optic chiasm, where there is a partial decussation (crossing) of fibers from the temporal visual fields (the nasal hemi-retina) of both eyes. The proportion of decussating fibers varies between species, and is correlated with the degree of binocular vision enjoyed by a species. Most of the axons of the optic nerve terminate in the lateral geniculate nucleus from where information is relayed to the visual cortex, while other axons terminate in the pretectal area and are involved in reflexive eye movements. Other axons terminate in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and are involved in regulating the sleep-wake cycle. Its diameter increases from about 1.6 mm within the eye to 3.5 mm in the orbit to 4.5 mm within the cranial space. The optic nerve component lengths are 1 mm in the globe, 24 mm in the orbit, 9 mm in the optic canal, and 16 mm in the cranial space before joining the optic chiasm. There, partial decussation occurs, and about 53% of the fibers cross to form the optic tracts. Most of these fibers terminate in the lateral geniculate body.

Based on this anatomy, the optic nerve may be divided into four parts as indicated in the image at the top of this section (this view is from above as if you were looking into the orbit after the top of the skull had been removed): 1. the optic head (which is where it begins in the eyeball (globe) with fibers from the retina); 2. orbital part (which is the part within the orbit); 3. intracanicular part (which is the part within a bony canal known as the optic canal); and, 4. cranial part (the part within the cranial cavity, which ends at the optic chiasm).

From the lateral geniculate body, fibers of the optic radiation pass to the visual cortex in the occipital lobe of the brain. In more specific terms, fibers carrying information from the contralateral superior visual field traverse Meyer&#x27;s loop to terminate in the lingual gyrus below the calcarine fissure in the occipital lobe, and fibers carrying information from the contralateral inferior visual field terminate more superiorly, to the cuneus.

==Function==
The optic nerve transmits all visual information including brightness perception, color perception and contrast (visual acuity). It also conducts the visual impulses that are responsible for two important neurological reflexes: the light reflex and the accommodation reflex. The light reflex refers to the constriction of both pupils that occurs when light is shone into either eye. The accommodation reflex refers to the swelling of the lens of the eye that occurs when one looks at a near object (for example: when reading, the lens adjusts to near vision).

The eye&#x27;s blind spot is a result of the absence of photoreceptors in the area of the retina where the optic nerve leaves the eye.

==Clinical significance==

===Disease===
Damage to the optic nerve typically causes permanent and potentially severe loss of vision, as well as an abnormal pupillary reflex, which is important for the diagnosis of nerve damage.

The type of visual field loss will depend on which portions of the optic nerve were damaged. In general, the location of the damage in relation to the optic chiasm (see diagram above) will affect the areas of vision loss. Damage to the optic nerve that is anterior, or in front of the optic chiasm (toward the face) causes loss of vision in the eye on the same side as the damage. Damage at the optic chiasm itself typically causes loss of vision laterally in both visual fields or bitemporal hemianopsia (see image to the right). Such damage may occur with large pituitary tumors, such as pituitary adenoma. Finally, damage to the optic tract, which is posterior to, or behind the chiasm, causes loss of the entire visual field from the side opposite the damage, e.g. if the left optic tract were cut, there would be a loss of vision from the entire right visual field.

Injury to the optic nerve can be the result of congenital or inheritable problems like Leber&#x27;s hereditary optic neuropathy, glaucoma, trauma, toxicity, inflammation, ischemia, infection (very rarely), or compression from tumors or aneurysms. By far, the three most common injuries to the optic nerve are from glaucoma; optic neuritis, especially in those younger than 50 years of age; and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, usually in those older than 50.

Glaucoma is a group of diseases involving loss of retinal ganglion cells causing optic neuropathy in a pattern of peripheral vision loss, initially sparing central vision. Glaucoma is frequently associated with increased intraocular pressure that damages the optic nerve as it exits the eyeball. The trabecular meshwork assists the drainage of aqueous humor fluid. The presence of excess aqueous humor, increases IOP, yielding the diagnosis and symptoms of glaucoma.

Optic neuritis is inflammation of the optic nerve. It is associated with a number of diseases, the most notable one being multiple sclerosis. The patient will likely experience varying vision loss and eye pain. The condition tends to be episodic.

Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is commonly known as a &quot;stroke of the optic nerve&quot; and affects the optic nerve head (where the nerve exits the eyeball). There is usually a sudden loss of blood supply and nutrients to the optic nerve head. Vision loss is typically sudden and most commonly occurs upon waking up in the morning. This condition is most common in diabetic patients 40–70 years old.

Other optic nerve problems are less common. Optic nerve hypoplasia is the underdevelopment of the optic nerve resulting in little to no vision in the affected eye. Tumors, especially those of the pituitary gland, can put pressure on the optic nerve causing various forms of visual loss. Similarly, cerebral aneurysms, a swelling of blood vessel(s), can also affect the nerve. Trauma can cause serious injury to the nerve. Direct optic nerve injury can occur from a penetrating injury to the orbit, but the nerve can also be injured by indirect trauma in which severe head impact or movement stretches or even tears the nerve.

Ophthalmologists and optometrists can detect and diagnose some optic nerve diseases but neuro-ophthalmologists are often best suited to diagnose and treat diseases of the optic nerve. The International Foundation for Optic Nerve Diseases (IFOND) sponsors research and provides information on a variety of optic nerve disorders.

<text>Pudsey is a market town in the City of Leeds borough in West Yorkshire, England. It is located midway between Bradford city centre and Leeds city centre. Historically in the West Riding of Yorkshire, it has a population of 25,393.

==History==

The place-name &quot;Pudsey&quot; is first recorded in 1086 in the Domesday Book as &quot;Podechesai(e)&quot;. Its etymology is rather uncertain: it seems most likely to derive from a putative personal name *&quot;Pudoc&quot; and the word &quot;ēg&quot; meaning &#x27;island&#x27; but here presumably referring metaphorically to an &#x27;island&#x27; of good ground in moorland. Thus the name would mean &#x27;Pudoc&#x27;s island&#x27;. Other possibilities have been suggested, however. In the early sixth century the district was in the Kingdom of Elmet, which seems to have retained its Celtic character for perhaps as many as two centuries after other neighbouring kingdoms had adopted the cultural identity of the Angles.

Around 1775, a cache of a 100 silver Roman coins, many predating the time of Julius Caesar, was found by Benjamin Scholfield of Pudsey on Pudsey Common, to the north of the town, at a place traditionally known as &quot;King Alfred&#x27;s Camp&quot;.

The town was famous in the 18th and 19th centuries for wool manufacture, and, from the 19th century, for cricket. Yorkshire and England cricketers Sir Len Hutton, Herbert Sutcliffe, Ray Illingworth and Matthew Hoggard all learned to play in Pudsey. A 19th century Yorkshire cricketer, John Tunnicliffe, was born in Lowtown.

During the Industrial Revolution, Pudsey was one of the most polluted areas of the UK due to its position in a slight valley between the two industrial cities of Leeds and Bradford. As a result, whichever way the wind blew Pudsey became covered in thick soot. The temperature inversion created by the valley led to the soot becoming trapped leading to dense smogs. This is believed to have led to jokes that pigeons in Pudsey Park flew backwards in order to keep the soot out of their eyes.

==Governance==
Formerly within the wapentake of Morley and Calverley Parish, Pudsey Urban District was formed in 1894; it gained municipal borough status . For many years, despite being joined to the Leeds conurbation, it avoided being made part of the County Borough of Leeds. In 1937 the Farsley and Calverley urban districts were added to Pudsey. In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, it became part of the metropolitan borough of the City of Leeds. It sits in the Leeds City Council ward of Pudsey.

Pudsey was part of the old Pudsey parliamentary constituency, along with Farsley, Calverley, Horsforth and Guiseley. The last Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency Stuart Andrew.

Pudsey’s current constituency (as of 2024) is now Leeds West and Pudsey and the MP is Rachel Reeves.

==Present==

There are recreational parks in Pudsey, the largest of which is Pudsey Park. Queens Park is where the Pudsey carnival is held once a year.

Pudsey&#x27;s market operates on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday and has recently been refurbished. Pudsey has a monthly farmers&#x27; market with stalls selling meat, fish, dairy produce, organic fruit and vegetables, delicatessen and craft-ware.

Pudsey town centre has amenities including high street chain stores and independent retailers, and there are several branches of banks and estate agents. Following the closure of Kwik Save supermarkets across the country, Pudsey&#x27;s store was bought by Sainsbury&#x27;s. Until the administration of the group, Pudsey had a Woolworths on Church Lane. It is now a B&amp;M Home Bargains store.

There are three secondary schools situated within Pudsey: Crawshaw Academy, Co-op Academy Priesthorpe and Pudsey Grammar School. The latter has been rebuilt under an extensive redevelopment programme adjacent to the current site. The old grammar school building facing Richardshaw Lane, which opened in 1911 and is a prominent Pudsey landmark, will (unlike the rest of the old school buildings) not be demolished due to its listed building status, but has since been converted into flats. A new Pudsey Sixth Form College is to open in September 2025.

Pudsey Town Hall benefits from a new, energy-efficient lighting project to highlight its most interesting features. The multi-coloured lights can be changed to offer 255 different scenes.

During the Easter weekend 2009, the Pudsey Business Forum launched the Pudsey Shop Local campaign. The campaign is to encourage local residents to shop more in Pudsey Town Centre. As part of this campaign they have launched a directory of all local shops.
&quot;Pudsey in Bloom&quot; was established in 2002.
Pudsey&#x27;s business community introduced a Lottery Scheme, aimed at local shoppers. The lottery scheme, encourages shoppers to purchase tickets from local shops within the scheme. At the end of each month a draw takes place and prizes are paid out in Pudsey Pounds that can be spent in participating shops.

Pudsey has a Masonic community, there are Lodges which meet at Pudsey Masonic Hall on Church Lane. Locally these lodges support activities within the local community.

Next to the Masonic Hall on Church Lane is the former Unitarian Church, now a private residence known as Churchfield House.

==Public transport==

New Pudsey railway station is on the Caldervale Line between Leeds and Bradford Interchange. It was built as a &quot;parkway&quot; station, and is situated over a mile away from the town centre. The frequent no. 16 bus service between Pudsey and Farsley (continuing to Leeds) passes close to the station. The location of the station near to the junction of the main Leeds to Bradford road with the ring road provides easy access for those travelling to the station by car. There is a large car park adjacent to the station.
Pudsey bus station serves the town. The bus station is managed and operated by West Yorkshire Metro. It is situated at Market Place and consists of six stands in total. Services are operated by SquarePeg. TLC Travel, First Leeds and Yorkshire Buses. The original bus station was replaced by a new structure that opened on 14 November 2010. Metro and Leeds City Council re-built it in the style of similar bus stations in West Yorkshire. Buses go from Pudsey to various parts of neighbouring Leeds, such as Armley, Bramley, Chapel Allerton, Cross Gates, Farsley, Horsforth, Headingley, Seacroft (a number of services run from the here to Seacroft bus station) and White Rose Centre, and as far afield as Dewsbury and Bradford.

==Sport==
The England cricket captain Sir Len Hutton was born in nearby Fulneck and was called &quot;the man from Pudsey&quot;. Raymond Illingworth, another former England cricket captain, was born in Pudsey as was the England fast bowler Matthew Hoggard and the snooker player Danny Fowler. For over a hundred years the Yorkshire County Cricket Club had at least one player who came from the old Borough of Pudsey. The England opening batsman Herbert Sutcliffe attended Pudsey School and learnt his cricket with the Pudsey St Lawrence and Pudsey Britannia cricket clubs.

===Cricket clubs===
Pudsey Congs Cricket Club is an English amateur cricket club with a history of cricket in the village dating back to the 1892. The club has been based on the former Pudsey Britannia Cricket Club ground since they purchased it in 1977. Pudsey Congs field three senior teams. Their 1st and 2nd teams are in the Bradford Premier League and their 3rd team in the Dales Council Cricket League. Their junior training section play competitive cricket in the Bradford Junior Cricket League.

Pudsey St Lawrence Cricket Club was founded in 1845 and is based on Tofts Road. The club has a significant success record, with 10 Bradford Premier League championship titles to their name. Pudsey St Lawrence field two senior teams in the Bradford Premier League and a 3rd team in the Dales Council Cricket League. Their junior training section play competitive cricket in the Airedale &amp; Wharfedale Junior Cricket League, a junior girls league with the West Yorkshire Women &amp; Girls Cricket League, and a late summer junior league in the Leeds Cricket League.

==Cultural references==

In &quot;The Meaning of Liff&quot; a Pudsey is defined as &quot;The curious-shaped flat wads of dough left on a kitchen table after someone has been cutting scones out of it.&quot;
Toward the beginning of the Monty Python episode &quot;You&#x27;re No Fun Anymore&quot;, the two characters, Mr and Mrs Samuel Brainsample can be seen walking along the platform of New Pudsey railway station. Pudsey is also mentioned frequently in the Michael Palin TV series Ripping Yarns.

Pudsey has given its name to &quot;Pudsey Bear&quot;, the mascot of the BBC&#x27;s annual fundraising marathon &quot;Children in Need&quot;, as this was where Pudsey logo designer Joanna Lane&#x27;s grandfather was mayor.

In bellringing Pudsey is one of the &quot;Standard Eight&quot; Surprise Major methods, the most commonly rung complex pieces of ringing for eight bells.

<doc id="152472" wikidata="Q109773" url="?curid=152472" title="Teutoburg Forest">
<text>The Teutoburg Forest ( ; ) is a range of low, forested hills in the German states of Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia. Until the 17th century, the official name of the hill ridge was Osning. It was first renamed the &quot;Teutoburg Forest&quot; in 1616 in commemoration of the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD, which most likely took place at Kalkriese instead.

==Geography==
The Teutoburg Forest is a peripheral section in the north of the German Central Uplands, and forms a long narrow range of hills (comprising three ridges) extending from the eastern surroundings of Paderborn in the south to the western surroundings of Osnabrück in the northwest. South of the city centre of Bielefeld, a gap called the Bielefeld Pass bisects the range into the &quot;Northern Teutoburg Forest&quot; (two thirds) and &quot;Southern Teutoburg Forest&quot; (one third). In addition, the northeastern and southwestern ridges are cut by the exits of the longitudinal valleys between the ridges.

The geologically oldest ridge is the northeastern one, which consists of limestone of the Triassic.

Most of the ridges and part of the valley are covered by deciduous forest. Parts of the valley areas are used for agriculture, especially the production of cereals.

The highest elevation in the Southern Teutoburg Forest is the Velmerstot () south of Horn-Bad Meinberg. In the Northern Teutoburg Forest the highest elevation is the Dörenberg () north of Bad Iburg.

The river Ems has its source at the western base of the southernmost portion of the Teutoburg Forest.

The southern half of the range, situated about southwest of the Weser valley, is part of the watershed between the Ems basin in the west and the Weser basin in the east. The drainage towards the Weser is affected by the Werre river. The northwestern half of the range is drained to the river Ems on both sides.

The neighboring landscapes are the Westphalian Lowland in the west, Hase valley in the north, the hilly Ravensberg Basin in the northeast, Lippe Uplands in the east, and Egge Range () in the south.

Except for a short area south of Osnabrück, which belongs to the Bundesland of Lower Saxony, the whole forest is part of North Rhine-Westphalia.

A long-distance hiking trail called &quot;Hermannsweg&quot; runs for along the length of the Teutoburg Forest, from Rheine in Münsterland to Leopoldstal near Horn-Bad Meinberg.

==History==
The Battle of Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD occurred in or near this region, though the exact location is disputed. The Roman historian Cornelius Tacitus identified the location of the battle as &quot;saltus Teutoburgiensis&quot; (&quot;&quot; meaning a forest valley in Latin). Recent excavations suggest that at least the final stages of the battle took place further northwest, at Kalkriese, north of Osnabrück.

The Teutoburg Forest was also the scene of some fighting at the very end of the Second World War. Lieutenant Ralph Elliott of the Manchester Regiment – a noted Australian scholar in later life – was severely wounded in combat in the Teutoburg Forest, and nearly died before being rescued several hours later.

The Teutoburg Forest is composed of two separate nature parks:

* TERRA.vita Nature Park, northwest part between Bielefeld and Osnabrück
* Teutoburg Forest / Egge Hills Nature Park between Bielefeld and river Diemel

== Hermann&#x27;s Memorial and the renaming of the Osning ==

Arminius (also known as Hermann the Cherusker), leader of the Germanic tribes during the battle, became something of a legend for his overwhelming victory over the Romans. During the period of national renaissance in the wake of the Napoleonic wars, German people saw him as an early protagonist of German resistance to foreign rule and a symbol of national unity.

A monumental statue of Arminius commemorating the battle, known as the Hermannsdenkmal (the &quot;Hermann monument&quot;), was erected on the hill of Grotenburg near Detmold, close to the site where the most popular theory of the time placed the battle. Emperor William I, the first &quot;Kaiser&quot; of the unified German Empire, dedicated the monument in 1875. In order to create a national landscape the Osning Hills were given the name &quot;Teutoburg Forest&quot;, &quot;see also Teutonic&quot;. The first to use that name had been historian and geographer Philipp Clüver in 1616, later it became more common when Ferdinand of Fürstenberg used it in his history and had it printed on maps. However, the old name survived among the local population and the part of the ridge around the Ebberg () near Bielefeld is still known as the Osning today.

The composer Johannes Brahms liked to take walks in this forest during his stay in Detmold.

<text>Hartshead is a village in the Kirklees district of West Yorkshire, England, west of Dewsbury and near to Hartshead Moor.

The village has pre-Norman Conquest origins; the Walton Cross is believed to be dated from the 11th century.

The name Hartshead is derived from Herteshevet or Herteshede which is Scandinavian in origin and means Hill of Heort, Heort meaning Hart in modern English.

Patrick Brontë served as curate of St Peter&#x27;s Church in Hartshead between 1811 and 1815, in which time he met his wife, Maria Branwell (although they met in Rawdon, some dozen or so miles away from Hartshead). They were married in Guiseley and became the parents of Anne, Branwell, Charlotte and Emily Brontë.

Kirklees Hall is between Hartshead and the nearby village of Clifton.

Robin Hood is reputed to have been buried near Hartshead or in the grounds of the nearby Kirklees Hall. The exact place is not known, as the gravestone has been moved at least 3 times.

== Governance ==
Hartshead was historically a chapelry in the parish of Dewsbury, becoming a civil parish in 1866. In 1931 the parish had a population of 849. On 1 April 1937 the parish was abolished, with most of the area, including the village, being added to the parish of Liversedge in the urban district of Spenborough (which became a borough in 1955). The remainder was added to Brighouse. Spenborough Urban District was abolished in 1974 when Kirklees was created. No successor parish was created for the borough and it became an unparished area.

<doc id="152474" wikidata="Q2575062" url="?curid=152474" title="Baildon">
<text>Baildon is a town and civil parish in the Bradford Metropolitan Borough in West Yorkshire, England and within the historic boundaries of the West Riding of Yorkshire.

It lies north of Bradford city centre. The town forms a continuous urban area with Shipley and Bradford, and is part of the West Yorkshire Built-up Area. Other nearby suburbs include Shipley to the south and Saltaire to the west. As of the 2011 census, the Baildon ward had a population of 15,360.

== History ==

Cup-and-ring stones on Baildon Moor have shown evidence of Bronze Age inhabitation.

Baildon Moor has a number of gritstone outcrops with numerous prehistoric cup and ring marks. A denuded and mutilated bank represents the remains of an Iron Age settlement known as Soldier&#x27;s Trench, sometimes mistaken for a Bronze Age stone circle.
A Bronze Age cup-marked rock is incorporated in the bank.

Baildon is recorded as &quot;Beldone&quot; and &quot;Beldune&quot; in the Domesday Book. In 1066 it belonged to a Gospatric, son of Arnketil, and had passed to Erneis of Buron by 1086.

Baildon had two manor houses: one on Hall Cliffe, the other in lower Baildon.

During the Industrial Revolution, Baildon developed a woollen industry; Westgate House was built in 1814 by the Ambler family who were prominent in the wool trade and the warehouse part of the building was Feathers Bakery now Nine Café adjacent to the mill which is now the Westgate Bar.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, conditions in Bradford deteriorated and poverty and ill health became widespread; Baildon began developing as a commuter town along with neighbouring Shipley. In the 1960s, the Hall Cliffe manor house was demolished and replaced with the Ian Clough Hall, named after a local mountaineer. In the latter years of the 20th century, the West Riding suffered from economic decline through the gradual closure of its textile and engineering industries. Bradford was particularly affected by this; however, Leeds grew as a major administrative and financial centre and Baildon with its railway links to Leeds has become a strategic commuter town.

=== Gypsy parties ===
Baildon was an important location for the British Gypsy community. A report of 1929 stated that annual Gypsy Parties had started two to three hundred years before – records were said to go back to 1770 when it was reported to be an ancient custom. In 1881, up to 5,000 people are said to have paid for admission. Gradually the event was taken over by local residents, who dressed up as Gypsies and formed &#x27;tribes&#x27;. Proceeds went to the local horticultural society.
After 1897 the tradition died out, apparently because the &#x27;real Gypsies&#x27; had disappeared. However, in 1929 it was revived to raise funds for Baildon Hospital.
A local resident, John Keen, then contacted the so-called King of the Gypsies, Xavier Petulengro, and they re-established large Gypsy gatherings at Baildon, recorded on Pathe News films and shown nationally in cinemas.

The Gypsy Parties ended with the start of the Second World War, and were never revived.

=== Pleasure Grounds ===

In northern Shipley off Prod Lane there was a small fairground with dodgem cars, booths and a historic &quot;Aerial Glide&quot; suspended roller coaster that for a short period had listed building status.
In earlier years the fairground attractions at Shipley Glen were much more extensive.
The fairground closed and is now dismantled and newly built (2015/6) private housing now covers the site.
The only working remnant of the Pleasure Grounds is the Shipley Glen Cable Tramway, a funicular railway carrying passengers from just north of Roberts Park, Saltaire up the hill side through Walker Wood to the location of the Pleasure Grounds at the top of Prod Lane.

== Geography ==
Baildon lies to the north east of Bradford, and is linked to Bradford and Shipley by the B6151. To the north of Baildon lies Baildon Moor, a part of Rombalds Moor, with several quarries and underlying strata of coal. There are the remains of old bell pits for mining the coal.

Across Baildon Moor is the village of Menston, the town of Ilkley and Ilkley Moor. Baildon is situated on a hill to the north of the River Aire and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.

Baildon is from Leeds city centre and from Bradford city centre.

== Governance ==

;History

Baildon was made a local board district in 1852. Elections were held on 16 September 1852, and the first quorate meeting of the local board was held on 9 October 1852. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts with effect from 31 December 1894 under the Local Government Act 1894. It was then administered by Baildon Urban District Council until it was disbanded when Bradford Metropolitan District Council was established in 1974.

;Present day

A group of local residents held an open meeting on 7 May 1997 and as a result the Baildon Community Council came into being on 26 June 1997 as a means of communicating local interest to appropriate authorities.
Residents of Baildon went through the appropriate legal process and as a result Baildon Parish Council was formed which held its first full meeting 14 May 2007.
The civil parish does not cover nearby Esholt, part of the Baildon Ward at District level, but includes the area North of the River Aire along Coach Road and Higher Coach Road (Baildon South West) which is within the Shipley Ward at District level.

On Monday 10 June 2013 Baildon officially became a town when Baildon Parish Council resolved that, in accordance with the Local Government Act 1972 s245, the Parish of Baildon shall have the status of a town.
Consequently, the Parish Council was renamed Baildon &quot;Town&quot; Council.

;Councillors

Baildon ward is represented on Bradford Council by three Conservative councillors, Valerie Townend, Mike Pollard and Debbie Davies.
 indicates seat up for re-election.

== Economy ==

Baildon has a modest town centre with most everyday amenities including independent traders, estate agents and family law solicitors.

There is a Co-op supermarket and a small Tesco on the outskirts.
The centre is home to many independent shops including Pickles Delicatessen, Westgate General Stores, Seasons Home, Finesse Gifts and Baildon Interiors.
There are also several independently owned hair dressers and beauty salons and a variety of restaurants and take-aways.
There are some eight public houses and bars in Baildon.

=== Charlestown ===

Charlestown in south east Baildon is the area of Baildon with the highest concentration of industry.
The area is in the valley bottom between Otley Road and the River Aire, and includes the Acorn Park Industrial Estate and the Butterfield Industrial Estate. Notable companies established in Charlestown include Manor Coating Systems and Denso Marston Radiators.

Further north east in Charlestown there are plans for a &#x27;Baildon Business Park&#x27; and hotel on a green field site near Buck Lane, at a cost of £25 million but there is opposition to the move.
Another industrial area is the Tong Park Industrial Estate off Otley Road in eastern Baildon.

== Landmarks ==
One of the main monuments in Baildon is the Frances Ferrand memorial fountain, known locally as the &#x27;potted meat stick&#x27;.
This was built by Baron Amphlett of Somerset as a memorial to his mother-in-law, Frances Ferrand.
It still stands today to the eastern side of Browgate.
In 1925 the monument was put at threat when plans were produced to replace in with a bus terminus.
In the 1960s the monument was removed and dismantled; however, in 1986 the Mechanics Institute raised funds to take it out of storage and restore it.
To the north of Towngate roundabout in front of Glendale House is a concrete paved open area created in the 1960s containing what remains of the stocks and a sandstone pillar thought to be the remains of a mediaeval cross, both Grade II listed. On Glen Road on the edge of Baildon Moor, close to Shipley Glen, is Bracken Hall Countryside Centre and Museum, a free-to-visit children&#x27;s museum, natural history education centre and nature centre.

Baildon&#x27;s war memorials are situated on Browgate
and in Tong Park.

North of Upper Coach Road in Shipley is Shipley Glen Tramway, a narrow-gauge funicular railway. The railway takes passengers between the valley floor near Titus Salt School to the bottom of Prod Lane, a short walking distance from Shipley Glen.

=== Churches ===

The Church of St. James in Charlestown is a painted tongue and groove timber building, now a grade II listed building.
It was moved to Baildon from Great Warley, Essex in 1905.
The Reverend N. R. Bailey, rector of Great Warley, had property in Baildon and hoped to retire there.
However his obituary was published in November 1900 before he retired.
In 2007/2008 the church was moved again, but only by a few yards.
This allowed the surrounding land to be sold by the Diocese for development.
Rotten timbers were replaced and underground heat pump system installed to make the building more eco-friendly.

The Church of St. John the Evangelist designed by Mallinson &amp; Healey, was built in 1848 though the south tower was not added until 1928.
The east window designed by Powell &amp; Sons was added in 1870.

== Transport ==

The village is served by Baildon railway station on the electrified Wharfedale Line with connections to Bradford Forster Square and Ilkley.
There is however, no service to Leeds owing to its position on the curve between the two lines.
Passengers must instead change at Shipley or the nearby Guiseley (Shipley having more services).
Baildon is served by the West Yorkshire Metro 626, 649, and 656–659 First and Yorkshire Tiger bus services.
The main road through Baildon is the A6038 Otley Road while the B6151 Baildon Road / Brow Gate goes the short distance from Otley Road up to Browgate roundabout.

== Education ==
There were a large number of First and Middle schools in the area, including Ferniehurst First School, Tong Park First School, Belmont Middle School and Ladderbanks Middle School, before the 1998 Bradford Education reform which returned the area to a two-tier school system. Currently, there are four local primary schools: Sandal Primary School to the North on West Lane, Baildon Church of England School to the east off Langley Lane, Hoyle Court Primary school in Charlestown and Baildon Glen Primary School to the south on Thompson Lane.

The nearest secondary school for the area is Titus Salt School on Higher Coach Road, overlooking Roberts Park, Saltaire. There is dispute as to which town the school actually is in, some classing it as Baildon and some as Saltaire.

== Sport and leisure==
Within Baildon there are sports clubs for cricket, football, golf, rugby and running.

Sconce camp site, near to Baildon, is operated by Aire Valley scout district.

== Media ==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Emley Moor TV transmitter and the Idle relay transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Leeds, Heart Yorkshire, Capital Yorkshire, Hits Radio West Yorkshire, and Greatest Hits Radio West Yorkshire. The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Telegraph &amp; Argus&quot;.

== Culture and events ==

For nearly a quarter of a century the August bank holiday weekend saw over 500 Harley-Davidson riders arrive in Baildon as part of the annual UK rally of the Harley-Davidson Riders Club of Great Britain fundraising rally.
The HDRCGB ran the rally up to 2001 when it moved to Berkshire.
In 2003, Harley-Davidson&#x27;s Centenary Year, the HDRCGB hosted the event for the last time in Baildon.
The rally is now organised by the Shipley Harley-Davidson Club.
In 2008 430 riders were given a police escort down Browgate towards Hollins Hill, from where most riders travelled to Harewood House.

<doc id="152475" wikidata="Q201812" url="?curid=152475" title="Huddersfield">
<text>Huddersfield is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees in West Yorkshire, England. It is the administrative centre and largest settlement in the Kirklees district. The town is in the foothills of the Pennines. The River Holme&#x27;s confluence into the similar-sized Colne is to the south of the town centre which then flows into the Calder in the north eastern outskirts of the town.

The rivers around the town provided soft water required for textile treatment in large weaving sheds; this made it a prominent mill town with an economic boom in the early part of the Victorian era Industrial Revolution. The town centre has much neoclassical Victorian architecture. An example is , which is a Grade I listed building described by John Betjeman as &quot;the most splendid station façade in England&quot;. It won the Europa Nostra award for architecture.

Huddersfield hosts the University of Huddersfield and three colleges: Greenhead College, Kirklees College and Huddersfield New College. The town is the birthplace of rugby league with the local team, Huddersfield Giants, playing in the Super League. It also has a professional football team called Huddersfield Town, that currently competes in the , as well as two Rugby Union clubs Huddersfield R.U.F.C. and Huddersfield YM RUFC. Notable people include Labour British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and film star James Mason.

The town has been classed under Yorkshire, the West Riding of Yorkshire and West Yorkshire for statistics throughout its history. The town&#x27;s population in 1961 was 130,652 with an increase to 162,949 at the 2011 census; it is in the West Yorkshire Built-up Area. The town is south-west of Leeds, west of Wakefield, north-west of Sheffield and north-east of Manchester.

==History==
===Iron age and Roman===
Local settlement dates back over 4,000 years. Castle Hill, a major landmark, was the site of an Iron Age hill fort. The remains of a Roman fort were unearthed in the mid 18th century at Slack near Outlane, west of the town.

===Toponymy===
The earliest surviving record of the place name is in the Domesday Book of 1086, &quot;Oderesfelt&quot;. It appears as &quot;Hudresfeld&quot; in a Yorkshire charter from 1121 to 1127, and as &quot;Huderesfeld&quot; in subsidy rolls in 1297. The name meaning has not complicated with the shifts of English, remaining &#x27;Hud(d)er&#x27;s field&#x27;.

The modern name is pronounced without a word-initial /h/ in the local dialect, a trait independently shared by many Norman scribes&#x27; dialects of the Domesday Book era (see Old and modern French).

===Market town and manor===
Huddersfield has been a market town since Anglo-Saxon times. The market cross is on Market Place.

The manor of Huddersfield was owned by long lease by the de Lacy family until its 1322 takeback by the Crown. In 1599, William Ramsden bought it, and the Ramsden family continued to own the manor, which was known as the Ramsden Estate, until 1920. During their ownership they supported the development of the town. Sir John Ramsden, 3rd Baronet built the Huddersfield Cloth Hall in 1766 and his son the fourth baronet was responsible for Huddersfield Broad Canal in 1780. The Ramsdens endorsed the railway in the first wave of national railway building, in the 1840s.

===Industrial Revolution===
Huddersfield was a centre of civil unrest during the Industrial Revolution in which Europe saw frequent wars during and after which, as to those most acutely affecting Britain, cloth trade slumped which could be compounded by local crops failure, many local weavers faced starvation and losing their livelihood due to the new, mechanised weaving sheds. Luddites began destroying the mills, sheds and machinery at such times; one of the most notorious attacks was on Cartwright – a Huddersfield mill-owner who had a reputation for cruelty – and his Rawfolds Mill. Kirkpatrick Sale describes how an army platoon was stationed at Huddersfield to deal with these; at its peak, having about a thousand soldiers and ten thousand civilians. Luddites thus began to focus criminal damage on nearby towns and villages (less well-protected); their most damaging act was to destroy Foster&#x27;s Mill at Horbury – a village about east. The government campaign that crushed the movement was provoked by a murder that took place in Huddersfield. William Horsfall, a mill-owner and a passionate prosecutor of Luddites, was killed in 1812. Although the movement faded out, Parliament began to increase welfare provision for those out of work, and introduce regulations to improve conditions in the mills.

===H. H. Asquith and H. Wilson===
Two Prime Ministers spent part of their childhood in Huddersfield: Harold Wilson, who was born locally and attended Royds Hall School, and H. H. Asquith. Wilson is commemorated by a statue on the (forecourt) to the town&#x27;s station.

===Aristocratic interest discharged===
In 1920, the Corporation bought the Ramsden Estate from that family that had owned much of the town at least as to the reversion of long leases (a minor, overarching interest) since 1599, for £1.3 million. The town became &quot;the town that bought itself&quot;. Most of the keynote central building freeholds belong to the local authority, as in a few towns in Britain such as Basingstoke.

==Governance==

Huddersfield was incorporated as a municipal borough in the ancient West Riding of Yorkshire in 1868. The borough comprised the thus sidelined civil parishes of Almondbury, Dalton, Huddersfield, Lindley-cum-Quarmby and Lockwood, later dissolved. When the West Riding County Council was formed in 1889, Huddersfield became a county borough, exempt from its control.
A more confined Huddersfield seat than the early 20th century scope has been represented by Labour since its creation in 1983 and is, by size of majority and length of tenure, a strongly-Labour leaning seat.

Kirklees was the first part of the country to have a Green or other environmentalist party councillor – Nicholas Harvey – he was instrumental in protesting against the intended closure of the Settle and Carlisle Railway line. The council has councillors of Labour, Conservative Party and Liberal Democrat parties; these retained the deposit, reaching more than 5% of the vote in the last general election (for an MP who serves in the House of Commons).

Huddersfield expanded in 1937, assimilating parts of the Golcar, Linthwaite, and South Crosland urban districts. The county borough was abolished in 1974 and its former area was combined with that of other districts to form the Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees in West Yorkshire.

Council bids to gain support for city status were rejected by the people in a poll held by the &quot;Huddersfield Daily Examiner&quot;; the council did not apply for that status in the 2000 or 2002 competitions.

Huddersfield had a strong Liberal tradition up to the 1950s reflected in several Liberal social clubs. The current Member of Parliament (MP) for the Huddersfield constituency is Harpreet Uppal, a Labour MP.

===Demographic change===
The town&#x27;s population in 1961 had reached 130,652.

Per the United Kingdom Census 2001 the population of the town&#x27;s urban sub-area of the West Yorkshire Urban Area was 146,234, and that of the former extent of the county borough was 121,620. The wider &quot;South Kirklees&quot; had a population of 216,011.
==Geography==
Huddersfield has the merger of the shallow valley floors of the River Colne and the Holme south of the town centre. This is in the eastern foothills of the Pennines which blend into the moorlands of the South Pennines west of the town.

===Climate===
As with all of West Yorkshire a temperate oceanic climate exists, wetter than the low plains rain shadow proper towards East Yorkshire but drier than Cumbria. It is mild for the latitude – overnight frosts are quite frequent in winter yet daytime tends to exceed such temperatures due to onshore breezes from around Britain and as the Gulf Stream moderates temperatures. Summers are usually warm, punctuated by frequent rainy and hot spells. Winters are usually cool and damp, punctuated by frequent cold spells where snow is possible, especially on higher ground. According to the Köppen climate classification, Huddersfield is certified as &quot;Cfb&quot;.


===Divisions and suburbs===
After boundary changes in 2004, Huddersfield now covers eight of the twenty-three electoral wards for Kirklees Council. Neighbouring wards in the Colne Valley, Holme Valley, and Kirkburton are often considered to be part of Huddersfield though they are predominantly semi-rural. The very centre of town forms the Newsome ward of councillors. Eight wards make up Huddersfield proper; these with populations, extent and constituent suburbs (mid-year 2005 estimates) are:

===Green belt===

Huddersfield is within a green belt region that extends into the Kirklees borough and wider surrounding counties. It is in place to reduce urban sprawl, prevent the towns in the West Yorkshire Urban Area conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage brownfield reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas, and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.

The green belt surrounds the Huddersfield built-up area, a much-wooded buffer zone. Larger outlying communities such as Upper Hopton, Grange Moor, Highburton, Farnley Tyas, Netherton, Honley, Outlane, Slaithwaite, Wellhouse are exempt from this. Nearby smaller villages, hamlets and rural areas such as Thurgory, Gawthorpe Green, Bog Green, Upper Heaton, Wilberlee, South Crosland, Rushfield Bridge, and Bank End see their unbuilt land included in the designation. Much semi-rural land on the fringes forms the rest. It was chiefly defined in the 1960s, and across Kirklees covers about 70%, i.e. (2017, excluding the Peak District National Park).

A subsidiary aim is to encourage play, sport and leisure, through woodland, moor, streams, green meadows, fields, small bogs. Features are:
*Castle Hill with Victoria Tower
*Coal Pit Scrog and Hall Wood in Lepton
*Blackmoorfoot reservoir
*Longwood reservoir
*Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Colne
*The Holme (river and paths)
*Storthes Hall
*Kirkheaton cricket ground
*Beaumont Park.

West of Marsden, Meltham and Holmbridge, it borders the north limb of the Peak District National Park.

==Demography==

===Ethnicity===

As of 2021, the town of Huddersfield&#x27;s population was enumerated at 141,692, and its ethnic makeup was 66% White, 20.4% Asian, 5.6% Black, 5.2% Mixed, 2% Other and 1% Arab.

===Religion===
The town has many churches, mosques, temples and synagogues. These include Christian denominations: the Church of England, Baptists, Presbyterians and Congregationalists (sometimes as their main fusion the United Reformed Church), Methodism, Quakers, and the Roman Catholic Church. Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Mormonism and Sikhism all have congregational buildings.

The town&#x27;s religious makeup was 39% Christian, 37.4% No Religion, 20.4% Muslim, and has small Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist and Jewish communities.

==Economy==

=== Industry ===
Huddersfield is a manufacturing town, despite the university being the largest employer. Historically the town produced woollen textiles. This area of business, along with the chemical and engineering industries that emerged to support the manufacture of textiles, was the basis of the town&#x27;s nineteenth and early twentieth century prosperity. The number of people who work in textiles has declined greatly, but the surviving companies produce large quantities of woollen products with little labour. The town is home to textile, chemical and engineering companies, including Brook Motors Ltd founded by Ernest Brook in 1904. Against conventional wisdom, he started making alternating current electric motors, and he did this in one room with two assistants and starting capital of just £300. On its 50th anniversary in 1954 it employed more than 2,000 people and, with Ernest&#x27;s sons Frank and Jack in charge, was the largest exclusive producer of AC motors in the world, and had a turnover of £4,500,000. That same year Brook Motors Ltd operated 10 factories in Huddersfield, its biggest being Empress Works on St Thomas&#x27;s Road, and opened one at Barugh Green, Barnsley.

Other local manufacturers are Cummins Turbo Technologies, founded in 1952 as Holset by Messrs. Holmes and Croset. (turbochargers), David Brown Gear systems (industrial gearing), Huddersfield Fine Worsteds (textiles), Taylor &amp; Lodge (textiles), C &amp; J Antich (textiles), Syngenta AG (agro-chemicals), Pennine Radio Limited (electronics transformers and sheet metalworking) and a large number of niche manufacturers, such as Dual Seal Glass (maker of spandrel glass panels) and Ellis Furniture (producer of kitchen and bathroom furniture). Huddersfield is home to Andrew Jones Pies, a regional award-winning pie-maker, and Mamas and Papas, a manufacturer and retailer of prams, pushchairs and related items and specialist pneumatics supplier Shelley Automation Ltd.

=== Health ===

Huddersfield Royal Infirmary is in Lindley. Medical services are split between there and the Calderdale Royal Hospital at Salterhebble, near Halifax. Kirkwood Hospice provides care for the terminally ill, and is dependent on donations and charitable gifts. Princess Royal Hospital provided maternity facilities until the risks of not being able to get an ambulance to A&amp;E in the event of complications were judged to outweigh the benefits of specialist service provision. It now functions as a day clinic, family planning consultation centre and GUM Clinic. A decision to move most maternity services provided by the Calderdale &amp; Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust to the Calderdale Royal Hospital ended the provision in 2007, despite strong local opposition. The campaign was led by Save Huddersfield NHS which elected a councillor, Dr Jackie Grunsell in the Crosland Moor ward. In January 2016 plans were announced to close the A&amp;E department of Huddersfield Royal Infirmary and have all emergency cases go to Calderdale Royal instead. This sparked uproar in local communities as it would mean journeys from some areas of over 40 minutes to and from the hospital assuming that the main road into Halifax was not congested, as it frequently is.

The former St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital in Crosland Moor mostly provided geriatric and psychiatric care. It closed in 2011 and the land was sold to a developer; this land is now home to Fitzwilliam Grange, a housing estate.

Platform 1 is a charity established in 2018 and provides a space and advice for men struggling with mental health.

===Entertainment===

The Lawrence Batley Theatre, opened in 1994, in what was once the largest Wesleyan Chapel in the world, and presents dance, drama, comedy, music and exhibitions and is the base for Full Body and The Voice, a company concerned with the integration of disabled people into mainstream theatre. Kelly Rowlands also holds the 2003 Line Dancing championship Record.

The John Smith&#x27;s Stadium, (formerly the Galpharm Stadium and Alfred McAlpine Stadium), is a multi-use sports stadium with a gym, swimming pool, spa and offers sporting classes. The stadium is home to Huddersfield Giants and Huddersfield Town football team. Adjacent the stadium is an Odeon cinema (formerly UCI).

There are many pubs, restaurants and night clubs, one of which, Tokyo, which closed in 2019, occupies the former Huddersfield County Court, a 19th-century Grade II listed building. The oldest pub is &quot;The Parish&quot;, trading since 1720.

===Shopping===
Huddersfield has a large and diverse retail shopping area, enclosed within the town&#x27;s ring road, compared with other towns of its size. There are three shopping areas: Kingsgate, The Packhorse Precinct and The Piazza Centre. The Piazza offers an outdoor shopping mall near the public library, with a grassed area, used for relaxation and events throughout the year such as entertainment, international markets and iceskating in winter. Through the adjacent Market Arcade is a covered market hall, which has listed building status, due in part to its distinctive roof formed by hyperbolic paraboloids. It is adjacent to the town hall and public library. An open market trades next to Tesco, on the other side of the town centre.

The town centre is home to several national high street retailers and chain stores. There are also a variety of small specialist and independent shops, many in the three-storey Victorian shopping arcade, Byram Arcade, on street, Westgate.

However over the last decade many shops have closed down causing a general decline of the town centre. Most notability the closure of British Home Stores (BHS) in 2016 left a large shopping unit empty in The Piazza Centre. In 2019 Marks &amp; Spencer announced 17 closures within the UK, one of these was the Huddersfield store.

==Community and culture==
===Music===

Huddersfield Choral Society founded in 1836, claims to be the UK&#x27;s leading choral society. Its history was chronicled in the book&quot; &#x27;And The Glory&quot;&#x27;, written to commemorate the society&#x27;s 150th anniversary in 1986 – its title derived from a chorus in Handel&#x27;s landmark Oratorio &quot;Messiah&quot;.

The annual Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival is held in the town which is also home to the Huddersfield Philharmonic Orchestra and the Huddersfield Singers.

On Christmas Day 1977, the Sex Pistols played their last two British shows, a matinee for the children of striking firefighters, at Ivanhoe&#x27;s nightclub, before embarking on an ill-fated US tour which saw the group&#x27;s acrimonious collapse. An independent record label, Chocolate Fireguard Records, was founded in 2000 by singer Pat Fulgoni who developed a three-stage community music event, Timeless Festival, in Ravensknowle Park, featuring a range of electronica, hip hop and rock music.

There are other annual music festivals held in the town and surrounding area, examples being the Marsden Jazz Festival, Mrs Sunderland, Electric Spring, Janet Beaumont, the Holmfirth Festivals, and the Haydn Wood (Linthwaite). The Haydn Wood (for under 21s) and Mrs Sunderland festival focus on musical and oratorial performance. The Electric Spring festival is an exploration of electronic and experimental music, featuring the 50-channel, 64-loudspeaker Huddersfield Immersive Sound System (HISS). The Mrs Sunderland Music festival is the second oldest in the United Kingdom, started in 1889 lasting for nine days each year. Free music concerts have been put on for the town, including bands such as the Ordinary Boys, the Script and Elliott Minor. There are many local choirs, youth and adult, an example of the latter being the Honley Male Voice Choir. 

Home-grown musical talent of all kinds is complemented by the student intake to the University of Huddersfield&#x27;s music department. &quot;The Sheriff of Huddersfield&quot; is a song by heavy metal band Iron Maiden on the B-side of their 1986 single &quot;Wasted Years&quot;, written about their co-manager Rod Smallwood, leaving his home town of Huddersfield and struggling to settle into life in Los Angeles. Huddersfield is home to thrash metal band Evile, dance rock band Kava Kava, the birthplace of the synthpop musician Billy Currie (of Ultravox and Visage), and the hard rock bassist John McCoy who played with Neo and Gillan.
===Art===

Huddersfield Art Gallery occupies the top floor of the library at Princess Alexandra Walk. It has an extensive collection featuring Francis Bacon, L.S. Lowry and Henry Moore, as well as significant regional artists. It has other halls for its temporary exhibitions for established and emerging artists.

Ian Berry was born in Netherton, Huddersfield and was educated in the town and went to Greenhead College and is internationally renowned for his art using only denim jeans and was named as one of the top 30 artists under 30 in the world in 2013. In 1996 aged 11 he won the &quot;Huddersfield Daily Examiner&quot; 125th Birthday competition that saw his design printed on to mugs, tea towels and posters.

===Festivals===
Huddersfield Festival of Light takes place annually in December, usually in the town centre adjacent to the railway station. Each year there is a performance by a theatre company. The finale is a firework display. The 2007 show was performed by French company Plasticiens Volants, which used large inflatable sea creatures in a parade through the streets as they told the story of &#x27;Pearl&#x27;. The 2005 and 2008 performances were by the Valencian artists Xarxa Teatre.
The 2010 festival featured Belgian company Company Tol and their suspension act – Corazon de Angeles (Angels&#x27; Heart) and ended on 5 December with fireworks in St George&#x27;s Square.

Huddersfield has a long-established Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade on 17 March.

Huddersfield Caribbean Carnival in mid-July, begins with a procession from the Hudawi Cultural Centre in Hillhouse, through the town centre to Greenhead Park where troupes display their costumes on stage. Caribbean food, fairground rides and various stalls and attractions are available. A &quot;young blud&quot; stage presents Hip Hop, UK garage, RnB and bassline.

The Huddersfield Literature Festival is held annually in the town, and features author events, creative writing classes and poetry nights, and sometimes creative writing competitions.

Since 2016 the town has a growing one-day Onwards Festival for music and arts. It celebrates local music, art, food and drink. Its spirit is organisation like a pub crawl, moving between venues to experience different tastes of culture. Its first year saw 10 live music acts, an exhibition and some live art performances, with payment for the later events.

==Landmarks and architecture==
Huddersfield has an abundance of Victorian architecture. The most conspicuous landmark is the Victoria Tower on Castle Hill. Overlooking the town, the tower was constructed to mark Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Year in 1897. A picture of the Victoria Tower features on the New Zealand wine &quot;Castle Hill&quot;.

Huddersfield Town Hall is a municipal building in the town: it seats up to 1,200 people and hosts events ranging from classical to comedy and from choral to community events.

The colonnaded Huddersfield railway station in St George&#x27;s Square was once described as &#x27;a stately home with trains in it&#x27;, and by Sir Nikolaus Pevsner as &quot;one of the best early railway stations in England&quot;. A bronze statue of Huddersfield-born Sir Harold Wilson, Prime Minister 1964–1970 and 1974–1976 stands in front of its entrance.

The George Hotel designed by William Wallen was built by Wallen and Charles Child in 1850. The hotel&#x27;s Italianate façade became Huddersfield&#x27;s adopted architectural style as the town developed over following decade. The hotel was the site of the birthplace of Rugby league in August 1895.

St Peter&#x27;s Church (Huddersfield Parish Church) replaced a church of the 11th century and is adjacent to the town centre, on Byram Street near the Pack Horse Centre. The church was built in 1838. Holy Trinity Church, just outside the town centre was built between 1816 and 1819.

The Pack Horse Centre is a covered pedestrianised shopping area constructed over a cobblestone street, Pack Horse Yard, renamed Pack Horse Walk. Pack horses carried merchandise over pack-horse routes across the Pennines before turnpike roads and railways improved transportation. The pedestrian link passes from Kirkgate, across King Street and along Victoria Lane, by the Shambles, to the Piazza and the distinctive market hall at Queensgate, which was built to replace the old Shambles Market Hall in the early 1970s. Next to the Piazza is the Victorian town hall and the 1930s public library.

Beaumont Park about south of the town centre was bequeathed to the town in the 1880s, by Henry Frederick Beaumont (&quot;Beaumont&#x27;s of Whitley&quot; estate) and was opened on 13 October 1883, by Prince Leopold, fourth son of Queen Victoria, and his wife Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont (Duke and Duchess of Albany). It is a fine example of a Victorian era public park with water cascades, bandstand and woodland.

The former St Paul&#x27;s Church on Queensgate has statutory recognition and protection, used for worship from 1831 to 1956. Sir John Ramsden gave its land and his family helped its extension to be built in 1883. The foundation stone was laid by Lady Guendolen Ramsden. The building is now part of the University of Huddersfield.

The St Paul&#x27;s Street drill hall was designed by Captain William &quot;Willey&quot; Cooper and completed in 1901.

Greenhead Park, west of the town centre, is lined with copses of various trees. A multimillion-pound restoration project, funded by the Heritage Lottery fund was finished in autumn 2012.

Ravensknowle Hall, built in the late-1850s, houses the Tolson (Memorial) Museum. The museum was founded in 1919, and was originally a natural history museum. It now also holds galleries on different historical fields, like transport, textiles and the history of the town.

== Filmography and media ==
The feature films &quot;Between Two Women&quot; and &quot;The Jealous God&quot; were filmed in and around Huddersfield. There is a Serbian film from 2007 called &quot;Hadersfild&quot;, a Serbian phonetic spelling of Huddersfield, where a character is from the town.

==Transport==
===Road===

Huddersfield is connected to the motorway network via the M1 and M62 motorways. The M1 passes about to the east. The M62 passes about to the north, and Huddersfield is linked to it by three junctions: Mount (A640, J23 – limited access), Ainley Top (A629, J24) and between Brighouse and Cooper Bridge (A644, J25).

Huddersfield Corporation built an inner ring road, part of the A62, in the 1970s. The ring road now defines the boundary of the town&#x27;s central business district. Its construction ended congestion within, where many roads are pedestrianised.

Main radial roads are the:
*A62 Leeds Road
*A641 Bradford Road
*A629 Halifax Road, 
*A640 New Hey Road
*A642 Wakefield Road (in east branching into the A629: Penistone Road)
*A62 Manchester Road

===Bus===

A trolleybus network operated from 1933 to 1968. Huddersfield bus station was opened by the Mayor, Councillor Mernagh on 26 March 1974, although it had not been completed. It is the busiest bus station in West Yorkshire with a daily footfall of almost 35,000. Most bus services pass through the bus station. Many services are subsidised by Metro.

Huddersfield&#x27;s bus operators reflect the national situation; local subsidiaries of three dominant national operators provide most services in the area: First Calderdale &amp; Huddersfield provide most local services in Huddersfield and some services outside Kirklees with destinations including Bradford, Brighouse, and Halifax. Stagecoach Manchester also operates the 184 service as part of the Bee Network out of the town to nearby Oldham in Greater Manchester. Arriva Yorkshire provide frequent services to Dewsbury and Leeds, and Team Pennine provide almost all services in the south east of the town. Other smaller operators include Stotts Coaches and Team Pennine. Centrebus Holdings purchased Teamdeck in May 2008, along with Stagecoach Yorkshire&#x27;s Huddersfield depot. In November 2006, a zero-fare town centre bus service, the Free Town Bus, was launched run by K-Line in partnership with Kirklees Council and Metro. Today this is run by Team Pennine.

===Rail===

Some services are subsidised by the public transport coordinator, West Yorkshire Metro. TransPennine Express runs a frequent express service to , Leeds and Manchester and regular services to , , , , , , and . There are local stopping services operated by Northern linking Huddersfield with , , , , , , and .

The Penistone Line passes through mainly rural stations towards Barnsley and Sheffield: , , , , and .

At the station, there are two internet-famous cats: black and white Felix and younger pure black Bolt. They have released merchandise and have published a book.

===Canal===
The Huddersfield Broad Canal, originally the Sir John Ramsden Canal, and the Huddersfield Narrow Canal are both navigable by narrowboat, and the broad canal by wider craft, wind around the south side of town. To the rear of the YMCA in the Turnbridge section is an electrically operated road bridge, which is still in use, to raise the road and allow boat traffic to pass. This bridge originally used a windlass.

==Education==
As well as primary and secondary schools, which cover compulsory and sixth form education for the town&#x27;s population, Huddersfield has two sixth form colleges: Huddersfield New College at Salendine Nook and Greenhead College west of the town centre. Huddersfield Grammar School is the only independent school for secondary education up to age 16. The town has a further education college, Kirklees College formed following the merger of Dewsbury College and Huddersfield Technical College. Its one establishment of higher education is the University of Huddersfield, whose chancellor until 2019 was the Duke of York. The actor Patrick Stewart from Mirfield is emeritus chancellor.

==Sport==

Association and rugby league football codes are the main spectator sports in Huddersfield. The John Smith&#x27;s Stadium is home to both professional clubs in the town. The rugby club left its Fartown home to share the association football club&#x27;s ground at Leeds Road, both clubs then left Leeds Road in 1994 to share the stadium. The town also has Rugby Union clubs and the Huddersfield Rams Aussie Rules club. In May 2022 the town made national and world headlines when its 2 professional sports teams both played in finals in London on the same weekend on the 28/29 May unfortunately both clubs lost their respective finals, The Giants narrowly losing the rugby league challenge cup final to Wigan, while the Terriers also lost narrowly to Nottingham Forest in the football play off promotion final.

=== Association Football ===

Its professional association football team, Huddersfield Town is the town&#x27;s senior association football team, founded in 1908, and most seasons play in the Championship, the second highest league of the sport nationally. In 1926, the club became the first in England to win three successive league titles, a feat only four other clubs have matched.

In 1921–22 Huddersfield won the FA Cup and between 1923 and 1926 became the first club to win the League Championship three times in a row, an achievement matched only by four other teams. After several decades in lower divisions, Huddersfield Town FC returned to top flight football in 2017 when the club entered the Premier League for the first time.

Notable ex-players include Scottish international Denis Law, Ray Wilson, a World Cup winner with England in 1966 and Trevor Cherry, England international.
Herbert Chapman, Bill Shankly, Neil Warnock and Steve Bruce are notable former Huddersfield Town managers.
Also within the town boundaries is Emley A.F.C. who were formed when the original Emley FC left for Wakefield who play in the Northern Counties East Football League and Golcar Utd who also compete in the NCEL league and share the &quot;HD derby&quot; with Emley. Shelley are also within the town&#x27;s boundaries and most recently played in the West Yorkshire Association Football League having previously played alongside Emley and Golcar in the North West Counties Football League Division 1 North.

=== Rugby ===
Rugby was first played in the town in 1848 and the Huddersfield Athletic Club, formed in 1864 and played its first rugby game in 1866. The town was the birthplace of rugby league. On 29 August 1895, 22 northern clubs met in the George Hotel and voted to secede from the Rugby Football Union and set up the &#x27;Northern Rugby Football Union&#x27; which became the Rugby Football League in 1922. The Rugby League Heritage Centre was in the George Hotel&#x27;s basement before the hotel closed in 2013.

==== League ====
Following the split of 1895, Huddersfield became a focus for rugby league. HAC&#x27;s direct successors, the Huddersfield Giants, who played the famous Fartown Ground until 1992 before sharing with the Football club, play in the Super League. It is the top division in Europe. Huddersfield Rugby Union Football Club play in National Division Three North and Huddersfield Y.M.C.A. RUFC play in North 1 East. Huddersfield Giants, the town&#x27;s rugby league club, has won the Rugby Football League Championship seven times, most recently in 1961–62, and the Challenge Cup six times, the last time in 1952–53.

The town is also home to the Huddersfield Underbank Rangers, who play in the Rugby League Conference. The club is based in Holmfirth and formed in 1884. It has launched the careers of many professional players including Harold Wagstaff, Paul Dixon and Eorl Crabtree.

==== Union ====

After 1895 rugby union was played exclusively under the Northern Rugby Football Union until 1909 when Huddersfield Old Boys were formed to play under rugby union rules, playing nomadically at five grounds until buying farmland at Waterloo in 1919 and, in 1946, renaming the club Huddersfield RUFC. In 1969 the club was at the forefront of a revolution in English rugby when it became the first club in the country to organise mini and junior rugby teams. The innovation spread and almost every club in the country has a thriving junior section providing a production-line of home-grown talent. Junior players at Huddersfield number over 200. In 1997 the Waterloo junior grounds were sold and the former Bass Brewery site at Lockwood Park was purchased for its replacement. With the assistance of a £2 million grant from Sport England, the club has transformed it into a major sports complex, conference centre and business park.

=== Aussie rules ===
Huddersfield Rams Aussie Rules is an Australian rules football team, formed in 2008. The club played its first season in 2009 and won the Aussie Rules UK National League – Central Division and took part in the North West Division in 2010.

===Other===
The Huddersfield Cricket League was founded in 1891. Huddersfield has produced multiple Yorkshire CCC cricketers including 14 internationals, such as Alec Coxon, Billy Bates and Chris Balderstone.

Huddersfield has a number of field hockey teams, many of which train at the Lockwood Park sports complex on the all-weather pitch.

Motorcycle speedway racing was staged in Huddersfield in the UK pioneer year of 1928. A venue in the town staged four or five meetings.
James Whitham, is a former &#x27;British Superbike Champion&#x27;. Lepton born Tom Sykes joined the Yamaha Motor Italia World team in the 2009 World Superbike season after spells in British Supersports &amp; British Superbikes in which he finished 4th in the 2009 Season. He won his first race in World Superbikes in one of two wildcard meetings and is the 2013 World Superbike Champion.

On 2 July 1952, in recognition of historic ties and links with the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment (West Riding), the Huddersfield County Borough had conferred on the regiment the Freedom of the Town. This gave the regiment the right to march through the town with &#x27;flags flying, bands playing and bayonets fixed&#x27;. Many of the town and district&#x27;s male residents had served in the regiment during its long history. This right was technically lost when merged with Dewsbury to form Kirklees MBC. On 25 March 1979, the latter gave the Freedom of Kirklees to the 3rd battalion of the Yorkshire Volunteers; this being the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Territorial Army unit.
When the &#x27;Dukes&#x27; were amalgamated with the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own Regiment of Yorkshire and the Green Howards&#x27; to form the Yorkshire Regiment on 6 June 2006 the right to march became extinct. The Regiment requested a resumed right to march. The right given by Kirklees to the 3rd battalion of the Yorkshire Volunteers did not permit any transfer to heirs or successors and effectively ceased when the battalion was amalgamated into the East and West Riding Regiment (since 2006 being the Yorkshire Regiment&#x27;s 4th Battalion). Kirklees Metropolitan Borough Council amended the original &#x27;Freedom&#x27; and transferred it to the Yorkshire Regiment, at a Freedom parade on 25 October 2008.

<text>Robert Fludd, also known as Robertus de Fluctibus (17 January 1574 – 8 September 1637), was a prominent English Paracelsian physician with both scientific and occult interests. He is remembered as an astrologer, mathematician, cosmologist, Qabalist, and Rosicrucian.

Fludd is best known for his compilations in occult philosophy. He had a celebrated exchange of views with Johannes Kepler concerning the scientific and hermetic approaches to knowledge.

==Early life==
He was born at Milgate House, Bearsted, Kent, on 17 January 1573/4. He was the son of Sir Thomas Fludd, a high-ranking governmental official (Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s treasurer for war in Europe), and Member of Parliament. His mother was Elizabeth Andrews Fludd. A collage of 12 Coats of Arms of Fludd ancestors are shown in the painting above his right shoulder. His paternal arms goes back to Rhirid Flaidd whose name originates from Welsh meaning bloody or red .

==Education==
He entered St John&#x27;s College, Oxford as a commoner in 1591, graduating with a B.A. in 1597 and an M.A. in 1598. St John&#x27;s College, Oxford was one of the few in England with any provision for Fellowship (medicine); William Huffman suggests that the presence of a Medical Fellow at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford influenced Fludd&#x27;s interest in studying medicine. During Fludd&#x27;s time at St John&#x27;s College, the Medical Fellow in residence was Matthew Gwinne; Gwinne had previously produced a tract indicating that, while he practiced Galenic medicine, he was also familiar with the main Paracelsian medical work. Fludd may have encountered Gwinne, or his writing, during his time at Oxford, providing an additional influence for his later medical philosophy and practice.

==Career==
Between 1598 and 1604, Fludd studied medicine, chemistry and hermeticism on the European mainland following his graduation. His itinerary is not known in detail. On his own account he spent a winter in the Pyrenees studying theurgy (the practice of rituals) with the Jesuits. Furthermore, he indicated that he travelled throughout Spain, Italy and Germany following his time in France.

Upon returning to England in 1604, Fludd matriculated to Christ Church, Oxford. He intended to take a degree in medicine. The main requirements to obtain this, at the time, included demonstrating that he (the supplicant) had read and understood the required medical texts—primarily those by Galen and Hippocrates. Fludd defended three theses following these texts, and on 14 May 1605, Fludd made his supplication. He graduated with his M.B. and M.D. on 16 May 1605.

After graduating from Christ Church, Fludd moved to London, settling in Fenchurch Street, and making repeated attempts to enter the College of Physicians. Fludd encountered problems with the College examiners, both because of his unconcealed contempt for traditional medical authorities (he had adopted the views of Paracelsus), and because of his attitude to authority—especially those of the ancients like Galen. After at least six failures, he was admitted in September 1609. He became a prosperous London doctor, serving as Censor of the College four times (1618, 1627, 1633, and 1634). He also participated in an inspection of the London apothecaries put on by the College in 1614, and helped to author the &quot;Pharmacopoeia Londinensis&quot; in 1618—a directory of standardized pharmaceutical preparations given by the London College of Physicians. He became such an established figure within the College that he was included in seventeenth-century critiques of the college, including those by Nicholas Culpepper and Peter Coles.

Subsequently, both his career and his standing in the College took a turn very much for the better. He was on good terms with Sir William Paddy. Fludd was one of the first to support in print the theory of the circulation of the blood of the college&#x27;s William Harvey. To what extent Fludd may have actually influenced Harvey is still debated, in the context that Harvey&#x27;s discovery is hard to date precisely. The term &quot;circulation&quot; was certainly ambiguous at that time.

==Occult interest==
While he followed Paracelsus in his medical views rather than the ancient authorities, he was also a believer that real wisdom was to be found in the writings of natural magicians. His view of these mystical authorities was inclined towards the great mathematicians, and he believed, like Pythagoras and his followers, that numbers contained access to great hidden secrets. Certainty in religion could be discovered only through serious study of numbers and ratios. This view later brought Fludd into conflict with Johannes Kepler.

==Mystical theory of nature==

===Tripartite division of matter===
Much of Fludd&#x27;s writing, and his pathology of disease, centered around the sympathies found in nature between man, the terrestrial Earth, and the divine. While Paracelsian in nature, Fludd&#x27;s own theory on the origin of all things posited that, instead of the Tria Prima, all species and things stemmed from first, dark Chaos, then divine Light which acted upon the Chaos, which finally brought forth the waters. This last element was also called the Spirit of the Lord, and it made up the passive matter of all other substances, including all secondary elements and the four qualities of the ancients. Moreover, the Fluddean tripartite theory concluded that Paracelsus&#x27; own conception of the three primary principles—Sulphur, Salt and Mercury—eventually derived from Chaos and Light interacting to create variations of the waters, or Spirit.

The Trinitarian division is important in that it reflects a mystical framework for biology. Fludd was heavily reliant on scripture; in the Bible, the number three represented the &quot;principium formarum&quot;, or the original form. Furthermore, it was the number of the Holy Trinity. Thus, the number three formed the perfect body, paralleling the Trinity. This allowed man and Earth to approach the infinity of God, and created a universality in sympathy and composition between all things.

===Macrocosm–microcosm relationship===
Fludd&#x27;s application of his mystically inclined tripartite theory to his philosophies of medicine and science was best illustrated through his conception of the Macrocosm and microcosm relationship. The divine light (the second of Fludd&#x27;s primary principles) was the &quot;active agent&quot; responsible for creation. This informed the development of the world and the Sun, respectively. Fludd concluded, from a reading of Psalm 19:4—&quot;In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun&quot;—that the Spirit of the Lord was contained literally within the Sun, placing it central to Fludd&#x27;s model of the macrocosm. remained in manuscript. As the Sun was to the Earth, so was the heart to mankind. The Sun conveyed Spirit to the Earth through its rays, which circulated in and about the Earth giving it life. Likewise, the blood of man carried the Spirit of the Lord (the same Spirit provided by the Sun), and circulated through the body of man. This was an application of the sympathies and parallels provided to all of God&#x27;s Creation by Fludd&#x27;s tripartite theory of matter.

The blood was central to Fludd&#x27;s conception of the relationship between the microcosm and macrocosm; the blood and the Spirit it circulated interacted directly with the Spirit conveyed to the macrocosm. The macrocosmal Spirit, carried by the Sun, was influenced by astral bodies and changed in composition through such influence. Comparatively, the astral influences on the macrocosmal Spirit could be transported to the microcosmal Spirit in the blood by the active commerce assumed between the macrocosm and the microcosm. Fludd extended this interaction to his conception of disease: the movement of Spirit between the macrocosm and microcosm could be corrupted and invade the microcosm as disease. Like Paracelsus, Fludd conceived of disease as an external invader, rather than a complexional imbalance.

==Death==
Fludd died on 8 September 1637 in London. He was buried in Holy Cross Church, Bearsted.

==Controversial works==
Fludd&#x27;s works are mainly controversial. In succession he defended the Rosicrucians against Andreas Libavius, debated with Kepler, argued against French natural philosophers including Gassendi, and engaged in the discussion of the weapon-salve.

===Defence of Rosicrucianism===
Fludd was not a member of the Rosicrucians, as often alleged, but he defended their thoughts as expressed in numerous manifestos and pamphlets. He produced a quick work, the &quot;Apologia Compendiaria&quot;, against the claims of Libavius that the Rosicrucians indulged in heresy, diabolical magic and sedition, made in his &quot;Analysis confessionis Fraternitatis de Rosea Cruce&quot; (Analysis of the Confession of the Rosy Cross) of 1615. Fludd returned to the subject at greater length, the following year.

* &quot;Apologia Compendiaria, Fraternitatem de Rosea Cruce suspicionis … maculis aspersam, veritatis quasi Fluctibus abluens&quot;, &amp;c., Leyden, 1616. Against Libavius.
* &quot;Tractatus Apologeticus integritatem Societatis de Rosea Cruce defendens&quot;, &amp;c., Leyden, 1617.
* &quot;Tractatus Theologo-philosophicus&quot;, &amp;c., Oppenheim, 1617. The date is given in a chronogram. This treatise &quot;a Rudolfo Otreb Britanno&quot; (where Rudolf Otreb is an anagram of Robert Floud) is dedicated to the Rosicrucian Fraternity. It consists of three books, &quot;De Vita&quot;, &quot;De Morte&quot;, and &quot;De Resurrectione&quot;. In the third book Fludd contends that those filled with the spirit of Christ may rise before his second coming.

It is now seriously doubted that any formal organisation identifiable as the &quot;Brothers of the Rose Cross&quot; (Rosicrucians) ever actually existed in any extant form. The theological and philosophical claims circulating under this name appear, to these outsiders, to have been more an intellectual fashion that swept Europe at the time of the Counter Reformation. These thinkers suppose that in claiming to be part of a secret cult, scholars of alchemy, the occult, and Hermetic mysticism, merely sought that additional prestige by being able to promote their views while claiming exclusive adherence to some revolutionary pan-European secret society. By this logic, some suppose the society itself to never have existed.

Between 1607 and 1616, two anonymous Rosicrucian manifestos were published by some anonymous person or group, first in Germany and later throughout Europe. These were the &quot;Fama Fraternitatis&quot;, (The Fame of the Brotherhood of RC), and the &quot;Confessio Fraternitatis&quot;, (The Confession of the Brotherhood of RC). The first manifesto was influenced by the work of the respected hermetic philosopher Heinrich Khunrath, of Hamburg, author of the &quot;Amphitheatrum Sapientiae Aeternae&quot; (1609) who himself had borrowed generously from the work of John Dee. It referred favourably to the role played by the Illuminati and it featured a convoluted manufactured history dating back to archaic mysteries of the Middle East, with references to the Kabala and the Persian Magi.

The second manifesto had decidedly anti-Catholic views which were popular at the time of the Counter Reformation. These manifestos were re-issued several times, and were both supported and countered by numerous pamphlets from anonymous authors: about 400 manuscripts and books were published on the subject between 1614 and 1620. The peak of the &quot;Rosicrucianism furore&quot; came in 1622 with mysterious posters appearing on the walls of Paris, and occult philosophers such as Michael Maier, Robert Fludd and Thomas Vaughan interested themselves in the Rosicrucian world view. Others intellectuals and authors later claimed to have published Rosicrucian documents in order to ridicule their views. The furore faded out and the Rosicrucians disappeared from public life until 1710 when the secret cult appears to have been revived as a formal organisation.

It is claimed that the work of John Amos Comenius and Samuel Hartlib on early education in England were strongly influenced by Rosicrucian ideas, but this has not been proven, and it appears unlikely except in the similarity in their anti-Catholic views and emphasis on science education. Rosicrucianism is also said to have been influential at the time when operative Masonry (a guild of artisans) was being transformed to speculative masonry—Freemasonry—which was a social fraternity, that also originally promoted the scientific and educative view of Comenius, Hartlib, Isaac Newton and Francis Bacon.
Rosicrucian literature became the sandbox of theosophists, and charlatans, who claimed to be connected with the mysterious Brotherhood. Robert Fludd led the battle. It is said by some that he was &quot;the great English mystical philosopher of the seventeenth century, a man of immense erudition, of exalted mind, and, to judge by his writings, of extreme personal sanctity&quot;.

It has also been said that what Fludd did was to liberate occultism, both from traditional Aristotelian philosophy, and from the coming (Cartesian) philosophy of his time.

===Against Kepler===
Johannes Kepler criticised Fludd&#x27;s theory of cosmic harmony in an appendix to his &quot;Harmonice Mundi&quot; (1619).
* &quot;Veritatis Proscenium&quot; Frankfort, 1621. Reply to Kepler. In it Fludd argued from a Platonist point of view; and he claims that the hermetic or &quot;chemical&quot; approach is deeper than the mathematical.
* &quot;Monochordon Mundi Symphoniacum&quot; Frankfort, 1622. Reply to Kepler&#x27;s &quot;Mathematice&quot;, 1622.
* &quot;Anatomiæ Amphitheatrum&quot;, Frankfort, 1623. Includes reprint of the &quot;Monochordon&quot;.

===Against the natural philosophers===
According to Brian Copenhaver, &quot;Kepler accused Fludd of being a theosophist, and Kepler was right&quot;. Fludd was well-read in the tradition coming through Francesco Giorgi. Marin Mersenne attacked him in &quot;Quæstiones Celebres in Genesim&quot; (1623).

* &quot;Sophiæ cum Moria Certamen&quot;, Frankfort, 1629. Reply to Mersenne.
* &quot;Summum Bonum&quot;, Frankfort, 1629. Under the name Joachim Frizius, this was a further reply to Mersenne, who had accused Fludd of magic.

Pierre Gassendi took up the controversy in an &quot;Examen Philosophiæ Fluddanæ&quot; (1630). This was at Mersenne&#x27;s request. Gassendi attacked Fludd&#x27;s neo-Platonic position. He rejected the syncretic move that placed alchemy, cabbala and Christian religion on the same footing; and Fludd&#x27;s &quot;anima mundi&quot;. Further he dismissed Fludd&#x27;s biblical exegesis.

Fludd also wrote against &quot;The Tillage of Light&quot; (1623) of Patrick Scot; Scot like Mersenne found the large claims of hermetic alchemy to be objectionable. Fludd defended alchemy against the criticisms of Scot, who took it to be merely allegorical. This work, &quot;Truth&#x27;s Golden Harrow&quot;, remained in manuscript.

===The weapon-salve controversy===
* &quot;Doctor Fludds Answer vnto M. Foster, or, The Sqvesing of Parson Fosters Sponge&quot;, &amp;c., London, 1631, (defence of weapon-salve, against the &quot;Hoplocrisma-Spongus&quot;, 1631, of William Foster, of Hedgerley, Buckinghamshire); an edition in Latin, &quot;Responsum ad Hoplocrisma-Spongum&quot;, &amp;c., Gouda, 1638.

The idea that certain parallel actions could be initiated and linked by &#x27;sympathetic&#x27; mysterious forces was widespread at this time, probably arising mainly from the actions of the magnet, shown by William Gilbert to always point towards some point in the northern sky. The idea owed a lot of the older Aristotelian and neo-Platonic views about soul-like forces.

==Cosmology and other works==
Fludd&#x27;s philosophy is presented in &quot;Utriusque Cosmi, Maioris scilicet et Minoris, metaphysica, physica, atque technica Historia&quot; (&quot;The metaphysical, physical, and technical history of the two worlds, namely the greater and the lesser&quot;, published in Germany between 1617 and 1621); according to Frances Yates, his memory system (which she describes in detail in &quot;The Art of Memory&quot;, pp. 321–341) may reflect the layout of Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe Theatre (&quot;The Art of Memory&quot;, Chapter XVI).

In 1618, Fludd wrote &quot;De Musica Mundana&quot; (&quot;Mundane Music&quot;) which described his theories of music, including his mundane (also known as &quot;divine&quot; or &quot;celestial&quot;) monochord.

In 1630, Fludd proposed many perpetual motion machines. People were trying to patent variations of Fludd&#x27;s machine in the 1870s. Fludd&#x27;s machine worked by by means of a water wheel and Archimedean screw. The device pumps the water back into its own supply tank.
His main works are:
* &quot;Utriusque Cosmi ... metaphysica, physica atque technica Historia&quot;, &amp;c., Oppenheim and Frankfort, 1617–1624. (It has two dedications, first to the Deity, secondly to James I, and copperplates; it was to have been in two volumes, the first containing two treatises, the second three; it was completed as far as the first section of the second treatise of the second volume.)
* &quot;Philosophia Sacra et vere Christiana&quot;, &amp;c., Frankfort, 1626; dedicated to John Williams.
* &quot;Medicina Catholica&quot;, &amp;c., Frankfort, 1629–1631, in five parts; the plan included a second volume, not published.

Posthumous were: 
* &quot;Philosophia Moysaica&quot;, &amp;c., Gouda, 1638; an edition in English, &quot;Mosaicall Philosophy&quot;, &amp;c., London, 1659.
* &quot;Religio Exculpata&quot;, &amp;c. [Ratisbon], 1684 (&quot;Autore Alitophilo Religionis fluctibus dudum immerso, tandem … emerso&quot;; preface signed J. N. J.; assigned to Fludd).
* &quot;Tractatus de Geomantia&quot;, &amp;c. (four books), included in &quot;Fasciculus Geomanticus&quot;, &amp;c., Verona, 1687.

An unpublished manuscript, copied by an amanuensis, and headed &quot;Declaratio breuis&quot;, &amp;c., is in the Royal manuscripts, British Library, 12 C. ii. Fludd&#x27;s &quot;Opera&quot; consist of his folios, not reprinted, but collected and arranged in six volumes in 1638; appended is a &quot;Clavis Philosophiæ et Alchimiæ Fluddanæ&quot;, Frankfort, 1633.

==Reception==

William T. Walker, reviewing two books on Fludd in &quot;The Sixteenth Century Journal&quot; (by Joscelyn Godwin, and William Huffman), writes that &quot;Fludd relied on the Bible, the Cabbala, and the traditions of alchemy and astrology. Many of his contemporaries labelled Fludd a magician and condemned him for his sympathy for the occult.&quot; He cites Godwin&#x27;s book as arguing that Fludd was part of the tradition of Christian esotericism that includes Origen and Meister Eckhart. He finds convincing the argument in Huffman&#x27;s book that Fludd was not a Rosicrucian but was &quot;a leading advocate of Renaissance Christian Neo-Platonism. Fludd&#x27;s advocacy of an intellectual philosophy in decline has done much to assure his general neglect.&quot;
