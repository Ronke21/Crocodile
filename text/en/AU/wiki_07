<text>The Berlin Philharmonic () is a German orchestra based in Berlin. It is one of the most popular, acclaimed and well-respected orchestras in the world.

== History ==

The Berlin Philharmonic was founded in Berlin in 1882 by 54 musicians under the name Frühere Bilsesche Kapelle (literally, &quot;Former Bilse&#x27;s Band&quot;); the group broke away from their previous conductor Benjamin Bilse after he announced his intention of taking the band on a fourth-class train to Warsaw for a concert. The orchestra was renamed and reorganized under the financial management of Hermann Wolff in 1882. Their new conductor was Ludwig von Brenner; in 1887 Hans von Bülow, the conductor of the Meiningen Court Orchestra and one of the most famous piano virtuosos of the time, took over the post. This helped to establish the orchestra&#x27;s international reputation, and guests Hans Richter, Felix von Weingartner, Richard Strauss, Gustav Mahler, Johannes Brahms and Edvard Grieg conducted the orchestra over the next few years. In 1887, the pianist and composer Mary Wurm became the first woman to conduct the orchestra. Programmes of this period show that the orchestra possessed only 46 strings, much less than the Wagnerian ideal of 64.

In 1895, Arthur Nikisch became chief conductor, and was succeeded in 1923 by Wilhelm Furtwängler. Despite several changes in leadership, the orchestra continued to perform throughout World War II. On 20 April 1942, Furtwängler conducted a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony with the Berlin Philharmonic for Hitler&#x27;s birthday. Following the end of the performance, Joseph Goebbels approached the podium to shake Furtwängler&#x27;s hand. This concert led to intense criticism of Furtwängler after the war. After Furtwängler (who was personally opposed to the Nazi regime ) fled to Switzerland to escape arrest by the Gestapo in January 1945, Leo Borchard became chief conductor. The final wartime concert was on 12 April 1945, just before the commencement of the Battle of Berlin. The program included Brünnhilde&#x27;s Immolation Scene, the finale from Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; (&quot;Twilight of the Gods&quot;). Hitler Youth members are reported to have distributed cyanide pills to the audience for those who wished, by death, to escape the imminent arrival of the Red Army. The battle forced the orchestra to close for two months, but it was quickly reopened by the Soviet occupation authorities under the East Berlin commandant General Nikolai Berzarin on 26 May 1945.

Borchard was accidentally shot and killed later in 1945 by the U.S. Army forces occupying West Berlin. Sergiu Celibidache then took over as chief conductor for seven years, from 1945 to 1952. Furtwängler returned as chief conductor in 1952 and held the post until his death in 1954.

The orchestra elected Herbert von Karajan as its next chief conductor. Karajan served in the post from 1955 until his resignation in April 1989, only months before his death. Under him, the orchestra made a vast number of recordings and toured widely, growing and gaining fame. The orchestra hired its first female musician, violinist Madeleine Carruzzo, in 1982. However, Karajan&#x27;s hiring in September 1982 of Sabine Meyer, the first female wind player to the orchestra, led to controversy when the orchestra voted 73 to 4 not to admit her to the orchestra. Meyer subsequently left the orchestra. After Karajan stood down from the orchestra in 1989, the orchestra offered the chief conductorship to Carlos Kleiber, who declined.

In 1989, the orchestra elected Claudio Abbado as its next principal conductor. It was the first time the Philharmonic resorted to democratic voting after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Abbado expanded the orchestra&#x27;s repertoire beyond the core classical and romantic works into more modern 20th-century works. Abbado stepped down from the chief conductorship of the orchestra in 2002. During the post-unification period, the orchestra encountered financial problems resulting from budgetary stress in the city of Berlin. In 2006, the Orchestra Academy of the Berlin Philharmonic established the Claudio Abbado Composition Prize in Abbado&#x27;s honour.

In June 1999, the musicians elected Sir Simon Rattle as their next chief conductor. Rattle made it a condition of his signing with the Berlin Philharmonic that it be turned into a self-governing public foundation, with the power to make its own artistic and financial decisions. This required a change to state law, which was approved in 2001, allowing him to join the organization in 2002. In his first season, he initiated community projects, such as a performance of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Le Sacre du printemps&quot; danced by 250 public school children, documented in &quot;Rhythm Is It!&quot;. Rattle&#x27;s contract with the orchestra was initially until 2012. In April 2008, the BPO musicians voted in favour of retaining Rattle as their chief conductor until 2018. From 2006 to 2010, the general manager of the orchestra was Pamela Rosenberg. In September 2010, Martin Hoffmann became the orchestra&#x27;s new &quot;Intendant&quot;. Hoffmann stood down as its &quot;Intendant&quot; after the close of the 2016/2017 season. Andrea Zietzschmann became &quot;Intendantin&quot; of the orchestra as of the 2017–2018 season. In December 2020, the orchestra announced the extension of Zietzschmann&#x27;s contract as &quot;Intendantin&quot; until 31 August 2025. In February 2024, the orchestra announced a further extension of Zietzschmann&#x27;s contract as &quot;Intendantin&quot; through the summer of 2028.

In 2006, the orchestra announced it would investigate its role during the Nazi regime. In 2007, Misha Aster published &quot;The Reich&#x27;s Orchestra&quot;, his study of the relationship of the Berlin Philharmonic to the rulers of the Third Reich. Also in 2007, the documentary film &quot;The Reichsorchester&quot; by Enrique Sánchez Lansch was released.

UNICEF appointed the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and Rattle as Goodwill Ambassadors in November 2007. On 10 January 2013, the orchestra announced the scheduled end of Rattle&#x27;s tenure as artistic director and chief conductor in 2018. In 2014, the orchestra founded its own label, Berliner Philharmoniker Recordings.

After an abortive first attempt on 11 May 2015, the orchestra on 21 June 2015 elected Kirill Petrenko as its next artistic director and chief conductor. In October 2015, the orchestra announced that Petrenko was to formally commence his contract as chief conductor with the 2019/20 season. A year after this news, in October 2016, the orchestra specified more precisely the start of Petrenko&#x27;s tenure as 19 August 2019.

== Concert halls ==
The orchestra&#x27;s first concert hall, the Philharmonie situated on the Bernburger Straße in Berlin Kreuzberg, was inaugurated in 1882 in a building previously used as a skating rink and converted by the architect Franz Schwechten. In 1899, a smaller concert hall, the Beethovensaal on Köthener Straße, was also inaugurated for chamber music and chamber ensembles. The first Philharmonie was used until British bombers destroyed it on 30 January 1944, the anniversary of Hitler becoming chancellor. The orchestra played until the end of the war in the Staatsoper, Unter den Linden. The Staatsoper was also destroyed on 3 February 1945. In need of a venue, the Berlin Philharmonic played during the years following the war in the Titania-Palast, an old movie theater converted in a concert hall, and still used the Beethovensaal for smaller concerts. During the 1950s the orchestra moved its concerts at the Musikhochschule (today part of the Berlin University of the Arts), in the Joseph-Joachim-Konzertsaal. However, most of the recordings were done at the Jesus-Christus-Kirche in Berlin Dahlem, celebrated for its acoustics.

The need for a new Philharmonie was expressed since 1949, when the &quot;Gesellschaft der Freunde der Berliner Philharmonie e.V. &quot;(Friends of the Berliner Philharmonie Society) was created to gather funds. The building of the new Philharmonie started in 1961, following the design of architect Hans Scharoun, and it was inaugurated on 15 October 1963, with a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, conducted by Herbert von Karajan. Its location made it part of the Kulturforum, and the great hall (2,440 seats) was then complemented by a chamber-music hall, the Kammermusiksaal (1,180 seats), built in 1987, following the design of architect Edgar Wisniewski, after a project by Hans Scharoun.

The Berliner Philharmonie has since been the home of the Berlin Philharmonic, and its symbol. The orchestra&#x27;s logo is based on the pentagon-shape of the concert hall.

On 20 May 2008, a fire broke out at the Philharmonie. One-quarter of the roof underwent considerable damage as firefighters cut openings to reach the flames beneath the roof. The hall interior also sustained water damage, but was otherwise &quot;generally unharmed&quot;. The firefighters limited damage by the use of foam. The orchestra was restricted from use of the hall for concerts until June 2008.

On 18 December 2008, the orchestra announced the official creation of a Digital Concert Hall. This hitherto unique internet platform of the BPO enables persons with computer access all over the world to see and hear the Philharmonic&#x27;s concerts, live or on demand, not only under recent conductors, but even previous concerts conducted, e.g., by Claudio Abbado. Since July 2014, the Digital Concert Hall additionally offers livestreams produced from HD movies of concerts by Herbert von Karajan in the 1960s and early 1970s. Since 2010, selected concerts of the Berlin Philharmonic have been transmitted live to cinemas in Germany and Europe.

<text>The Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) is an American orchestra based in Boston. It is the second-oldest of the five major American symphony orchestras commonly referred to as the &quot;Big Five&quot;. Founded by Henry Lee Higginson in 1881, the BSO performs most of its concerts at Boston&#x27;s Symphony Hall and in the summer performs at Tanglewood.

Since its founding, the orchestra has had 17 music directors, including George Henschel, Serge Koussevitzky, Henri Rabaud, Pierre Monteux, Charles Munch, Erich Leinsdorf, William Steinberg and James Levine. Andris Nelsons is the current music director of the BSO. Seiji Ozawa had held the title of BSO music director laureate. Bernard Haitink had held the title of principal guest conductor of the BSO from 1995 to 2004, then conductor emeritus until his death in 2021. The orchestra has made gramophone recordings since 1917 and has occasionally played on soundtrack recordings for films, including &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;.

==History==

===Early years===

The BSO was founded in 1881 by Henry Lee Higginson. Its first conductor was George Henschel, who was a noted baritone as well as conductor, and a close friend of Johannes Brahms. For the orchestra, Henschel devised innovative orchestral seating charts and sent them to Brahms, who replied approvingly and commented on the issues raised by horn and viola sections in a letter of mid-November 1881. The BSO&#x27;s first concert took place on October 22, 1881. The program consisted of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;The Consecration of the House&quot;, as well as music by Joseph Haydn, Christoph Willibald Gluck, Franz Schubert and Carl Maria von Weber.
The orchestra&#x27;s four subsequent music directors were all trained in Austria, including the seminal and highly influential Hungarian-born conductor Arthur Nikisch, in accordance with the tastes of Higginson. Wilhelm Gericke served twice, from 1884 to 1889 and again from 1898 to 1906. According to Joseph Horowitz&#x27;s review of correspondence, Higginson considered 25 candidates to replace Gericke after receiving notice in 1905. He decided not to offer the position to Gustav Mahler, Fritz Steinbach, and Willem Mengelberg but did not rule out the young Bruno Walter if nobody more senior were to accept. He offered the position to Hans Richter in February 1905, who declined, to Felix Mottl in November, who was previously engaged, and then to previous director Nikisch, who declined; the post was finally offered to Karl Muck, who accepted and began his duties in October 1906. He was conductor until 1908 and again from 1912 to 1918.

The music director 1908–12 was Max Fiedler. He conducted the premiere of Ignacy Jan Paderewski&#x27;s Symphony in B minor &quot;Polonia&quot; in 1909.

Following American entry into World War I, Muck (born in Germany but a Swiss citizen since childhood), was falsely accused by unscrupulous newspaper editor John R. Rathom of knowingly refusing a request to play &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot;. Although Higginson had not told Muck of the request and the BSO always ended future concerts with the American national anthem, Muck was subjected by Rathom to a trial by media anyway and was arrested by Federal agents shortly before a performance of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; in March 1918. Along with 29 of the BSO best musicians, Muck was imprisoned in Fort Oglethorpe, a German-American internment camp in the State of Georgia, without trial or appeal until the summer after the Armistice, when he and his wife agreed that be deported to neutral Denmark. Muck felt deeply insulted by the injustice of these events, vowed never to perform on American soil again, and conducted thereafter only in Europe. 

The BSO&#x27;s next two titled conductors were French: Henri Rabaud, who took over from Muck for a season, and then Pierre Monteux from 1919 to 1924. Monteux, because of a musician&#x27;s strike, was able to replace 30 players, thus changing the orchestra&#x27;s sound; the orchestra developed a reputation for a &quot;French&quot; sound which persists to some degree to this day.

===Koussevitzky and Munch===

The orchestra&#x27;s reputation increased during the 1924–1949 music directorship of Serge Koussevitzky. One million radio listeners tuned in when Koussevitzky and the orchestra were the first to perform a live concert for radio broadcast, which they did on NBC in 1926.

In August 1942, the American Federation of Musicians kicked off the two-year long musician&#x27;s strike, with the goal of musicians receiving more in royalty payments from record companies. Initially, the BSO were the only major performing group in the nation unaffected; the orchestra&#x27;s musicians hadn&#x27;t been unionized since the orchestra&#x27;s founding. By the end of 1942, however, the orchestra joined the AFM, effectively joining the strike, and also kicking off a long series of live radio concerts on CBS with Koussevitzky conducting.

Under Koussevitzky, the orchestra gave regular radio broadcasts and established its summer home at Tanglewood, where Koussevitzky founded the Berkshire Music Center, which is now the Tanglewood Music Center. Those network radio broadcasts ran from 1926 through 1951, and again from 1954 through 1956. The orchestra continues to make regular live radio broadcasts to the present day. The Boston Symphony has been closely involved with Boston&#x27;s WGBH Radio as an outlet for its concerts.

Koussevitzky also commissioned many new pieces from prominent composers, including the Symphony No. 4 of Sergei Prokofiev, George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Second Rhapsody&quot; and the &quot;Symphony of Psalms&quot; by Igor Stravinsky. They also gave the premiere of Béla Bartók&#x27;s Concerto for Orchestra, which had been commissioned by the Koussevitzky Music Foundation at the instigation of Fritz Reiner and Joseph Szigeti.

Koussevitzky started a tradition of commissions that the orchestra continued, including new works by Heitor Villa-Lobos (Symphony No. 11) and Henri Dutilleux for its 75th anniversary, Roger Sessions, and Andrzej Panufnik, for the 100th, and lately for the 125th works by Leon Kirchner, Elliott Carter, and Peter Lieberson. Other BSO commissions have included John Corigliano&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 for the 100th anniversary of Symphony Hall. Hans Werner Henze dedicated his Eighth Symphony to the orchestra.

Although Koussevitsky recommended his protégé Leonard Bernstein to be his successor after he retired in 1949, the BSO awarded the position to the Alsatian maestro Charles Munch, who would lead until 1962. Munch had made his Boston conducting debut in 1946. He led orchestra on its first overseas tour, and also produced their first stereo recording in February 1954 for RCA Victor. In 1952, Munch appointed the first woman to hold a principal chair in a major U.S. orchestra, flutist Doriot Anthony Dwyer, who remained as BSO principal for 38 years.

===Leinsdorf, Steinberg, and Ozawa===
Erich Leinsdorf became music director in 1962 and held the post until 1969. William Steinberg was then music director from 1969 to 1972. Steinberg was &quot;ill and ailing&quot; according to composer/author Jan Swafford, and &quot;for four years he was indisposed much of the time.&quot; After Steinberg&#x27;s retirement, according to BSO trustee John Thorndike (who was on the search committee) the symphony&#x27;s board spoke to Colin Davis and &quot;investigated very thoroughly&quot; his appointment, but Davis&#x27;s commitments to his young family did not allow his moving to Boston from England; instead he accepted the post of BSO principal guest conductor, which he held from 1972 to 1984. As the search continued, Leonard Bernstein met with four board members and recommended Michael Tilson Thomas, who had been Assistant Conductor and Associate Conductor under Steinberg, for the directorship, but the young conductor &quot;did not have sufficient support among the BSO players,&quot; according to journalist Jeremy Eichler. The committee eventually chose Seiji Ozawa, who became Music Director in 1973 and held the post until 2002, the longest tenure of any Boston Symphony conductor. In 1979, he led the Boston Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s visit to the People&#x27;s Republic of China to celebrate the normalization of US-China diplomatic relations, making it the second American orchestra to ever visit the country.

Ozawa&#x27;s tenure involved significant dissension and controversy. One concern was his handling of the Tanglewood Music Center. Greg Sandow wrote in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in December 1998 that Ozawa &quot;had taken control of the school with what many people thought was surprising and abrupt brutality. Members of the faculty, themselves world-famous, had angrily resigned.&quot; The first departure was in the fall of 1996, when Ozawa fired Richard Ortner, the Festival&#x27;s administrator. After a tumultuous season, at the end of summer 1997, pianist Gilbert Kalish resigned from the faculty by sending Ozawa what the pianist/conductor Leon Fleisher later described as &quot;a blistering letter of resignation, and he made it public&quot;; Fleisher, who was also a long-term member of the Tanglewood faculty, wrote, &quot;Most of the faculty felt he was speaking for them.&quot; Ozawa reduced Fleisher&#x27;s role at the Center, offering him instead a &quot;ceremonial puppet role,&quot; and Fleisher resigned, writing to Ozawa that the proposed role was &quot;somewhat akin to having my legs chopped off at the knees, you then gently taking me by the arm and inviting me for a stroll. I must decline the invitation.&quot; By contrast, &quot;Boston Globe&quot; music critic Richard Dyer wrote that:
...not every change was for the better...But there can be no question that Tanglewood is a busier, more adventurous, and more exciting place than it was before Ozawa became music director.

A more basic concern involved perceived shortcomings in Ozawa&#x27;s musical leadership; as Sandow wrote in the 1998 article, &quot;what mattered far more was how badly the BSO plays.&quot; He noted that a group of Boston Symphony musicians had privately published a newsletter, &quot;Counterpoint&quot;, expressing their concerns; in the summer of 1995 concertmaster Malcolm Lowe and principal cellist Jules Eskin wrote that in rehearsal Ozawa gave no &quot;specific leadership in matters of tempo and rhythm,&quot; no &quot;expression of care about sound quality,&quot; and no &quot;distinctly-conveyed conception of the character of each piece the BSO plays.&quot;

The BSO&#x27;s managing director, Mark Volpe, responded that some board members considered Sandow&#x27;s article a &quot;hatchet job,&quot; and some unnamed BSO &quot;observers&quot; were said in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; to believe that Sandow &quot;might be sharpening blades for BSO members with axes to grind&quot;. Sandow called the suggestion &quot;nonsense,&quot; saying, &quot;I found them [players criticizing Ozawa in his article], they didn&#x27;t find me&quot;. André Previn wrote to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; defending Ozawa, and Lowe wrote to the Journal that he was &quot;frustrated and upset to see my name attached to the article since your reporter did not contact me and chose to quote a letter published nearly four years ago in an internal orchestra publication.&quot; Boston Symphony Board of Trustees president Nicholas T. Zervas described Sandow as expressing an &quot;`insulting, reductive, and racist view of [Ozawa] as a samurai kept in place in order to raise Japanese money&quot; – a point Sandow rebutted in a letter to the Journal, saying &quot;These are things I didn&#x27;t say. I&#x27;d heard the charge about Japanese money while I was writing my piece, so I asked Mark Volpe, the BSO&#x27;s General Manager, what he thought of it. Mark refuted it, and I quoted him approvingly.&quot; Critic Lloyd Schwarz defended Sandow in the Boston alternative paper, &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot;

Various current music critics described a decline in the orchestra&#x27;s playing during Ozawa&#x27;s tenure. Jan Swafford wrote:

Now and then he gave a standout performance, usually in the full-throated late-Romantic and 20th-century literature, but most of the time what came out was glittering surfaces with nothing substantial beneath: no discernable concept, no vision.

In a 2013 survey of recordings of &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; by Igor Stravinsky, the composer Russell Platt wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;:

Seiji Ozawa&#x27;s downright depressing account, recorded in 1979: the Boston Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s sonic shine, developed by Ozawa&#x27;s predecessors Monteux and Charles Munch, is audibly dripping away, its dispirited musicians losing their sense of individual responsibility to the score. It is a record of a professional relationship that went on far too long.

On June 22, 1999, the symphony announced Ozawa&#x27;s departure as music director, as of 2002, following the sudden announcement of Ozawa&#x27;s appointment as music director of the Vienna State Opera – a decision the board had heard about only a day earlier, where Volpe said he was &quot;a little surprised at the timing&quot;. He gave his last concert with the orchestra in July 2002.

During Ozawa&#x27;s tenure, Bernard Haitink served as principal guest conductor from 1995 to 2004. Haitink was named conductor emeritus in 2004, and actively served in the post as a returning guest conductor through his retirement in 2019.

===Levine and Nelsons===
In 2004, James Levine became the first American-born music director of the BSO. Levine received critical praise for revitalizing the quality and repertoire since the beginning of his tenure, including championing contemporary composers. During Levine&#x27;s tenure, by February 2009 the BSO had performed 18 world premieres, 12 of them conducted by Levine. To fund the more challenging and expensive of Levine&#x27;s musical projects with the orchestra, the orchestra established an &quot;Artistic Initiative Fund&quot; of about $40 million. (As of March 2013, the Boston Symphony also claimed an endowment of $413 million, the largest of any orchestra in the world.) Levine suffered from recurring injuries and health problems during his BSO tenure, which led to his resignation as BSO music director as of September 1, 2011.

In the wake of Levine&#x27;s resignation, Andris Nelsons made his first guest-conducting appearance with the BSO in March 2011, as an emergency substitute for Levine at Carnegie Hall in Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 9. He subsequently guest-conducted the BSO at Tanglewood in July 2012, and made his first appearance with the BSO at Symphony Hall in January 2013. In May 2013, the BSO named Nelsons as its 15th music director, effective with the 2014–2015 season. His initial contract was for 5 years, with 8–10 weeks of scheduled appearances in the first year of the contract, and 12 weeks in subsequent years. Nelsons held the title of Music Director Designate for the 2013–2014 season. In August 2015, the BSO announced the extension of Nelsons&#x27; contract as music director through the 2021–2022 season, with a new contract of 8 years to replace the initial 5-year contract, and which also contains an evergreen clause for automatic renewal. In October 2020, the BSO announced a further extension of Nelsons&#x27; contract as music director through August 2025, with an evergreen clause for automatic renewal. In January 2024, the BSO announced the conversion of Nelsons&#x27; contract as its music director to a rolling evergreen contract.

In September 2015, the orchestra announced a new artistic collaboration with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, of which Nelsons was appointed as its next Gewandhauskapellmeister, effective with the 2017–2018 season.

====Unequal-pay lawsuit====
On July 2, 2018, BSO principal flautist Elizabeth Rowe filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, claiming pay discrimination on the basis of gender. Rowe said she was paid much less than principal oboist John Ferrillo since 2004 and was seeking more than $200,000 in unpaid compensation from the orchestra. The BSO tried to discredit Rowe&#x27;s claim that she was being discriminated against because of the unequal pay compared to Ferrillo by saying in a court filing that the two wind instruments were not comparable. After mediation, the case was settled out of court in February 2019 for an undisclosed amount.

===Recent history===

In January 2020, the BSO cancelled its planned tour of Asia, the first American orchestra to cancel overseas travel in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak. Subsequent events related to the COVID-19 pandemic included the following:
* Cancellation of the 2020 Tanglewood summer festival season
* Cancellation of its scheduled subscription concerts through November 2020, the first-ever full cancellation of the orchestra&#x27;s autumn subscription concerts in its history
* Staff redundancies effective September 1, 2020
* Reduction in orchestra musician compensation in its latest labour agreement, from August 24, 2020, through August 27, 2023

In succession to Mark Volpe, Gail Samuel became the BSO&#x27;s president and chief executive officer in June 2021, the first woman to be named to the posts in the history of the orchestra. In December 2022, the BSO announced simultaneously the resignation of Samuel as its president and CEO, effective January 3, 2023, and the appointment of Jeffrey D. Dunn as its interim president and CEO, effective January 4, 2023. In May 2023, the BSO announced the appointment of Chad Smith as its next president and chief executive officer, effective in the autumn of 2023.

==Related ensembles==
The Boston Pops, the Boston Symphony Orchestra minus its principal players, was founded in 1885, and plays lighter, more popular classics, and show tunes. Arthur Fiedler was the conductor who did the most to increase the fame of the Boston Pops over his tenure from 1930 to 1979. Film composer John Williams succeeded Fiedler as the conductor of the Pops from 1980 to 1993. Since 1995, conductor Keith Lockhart has led the Boston Pops.

The Boston Symphony Chamber Players were launched in 1964. Today they are the only chamber ensemble composed of principal players from an American symphony orchestra. In addition to regular performances in Boston and Tanglewood, they have performed throughout the United States and Europe. They have also recorded for RCA Victor, Deutsche Grammophon, Philips, and Nonesuch.

Performing with the BSO and Boston Pops for major choral works is the Tanglewood Festival Chorus. Organized in 1970 by its founding director, John Oliver, the Chorus comprises over 300 volunteer singers. Before the creation of the Tanglewood Festival Chorus, and for some time after, the BSO frequently employed the New England Conservatory Chorus conducted by Lorna Cooke DeVaron, Chorus pro Musica, Harvard Glee Club and Radcliffe Choral Society. In February 2017, the BSO announced the appointment of James Burton as the new conductor of the Tanglewood Festival Chorus and as the newly created BSO Choral Director, both with immediate effect. Burton founded the Boston Symphony Children&#x27;s Choir in 2018.

==Recordings==

The Boston Symphony made its first acoustical recordings in 1917 in Camden, New Jersey, for the Victor Talking Machine Company conducted by Karl Muck. Among the first discs recorded was the finale to Tchaikovsky&#x27;s fourth symphony. Under Serge Koussevitzky, the orchestra made its first electrical recordings, also for Victor, in the late 1920s. These electrical recordings included Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot;. Recording sessions took place in Symphony Hall. Koussevitzky&#x27;s final recording with the Boston Symphony was a high fidelity version of Sibelius&#x27; Symphony No. 2, recorded in 1950 and released on LP.

In February 1954, RCA Victor began recording the orchestra in stereo, under the direction of Charles Munch. RCA Victor continued to record Munch and the orchestra through 1962, his final year as music director in Boston (see the Charles Munch discography for a complete list of commercial recordings with the BSO under Charles Munch). During Munch&#x27;s tenure, Pierre Monteux made a series of records with the BSO for RCA Victor (see Pierre Monteux for a complete list of commercial recordings with the BSO).

Erich Leinsdorf, who had already made numerous recordings for RCA Victor, continued his association with the company during his seven years in Boston. These included a critically acclaimed performance of Brahms&#x27; &quot;German Requiem&quot; (see Erich Leinsdorf for a complete list).

Then, the orchestra switched to Deutsche Grammophon (DG) under William Steinberg. RCA Victor recorded several LPs with Steinberg and Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie Fantastique&quot; with Georges Prêtre during the transition to DG (see William Steinberg for a complete list of commercial recordings). Michael Tilson Thomas, who was the assistant conductor and associate conductor under Steinberg, also made several recordings for DG; some of these have been reissued on CD.

Due to Steinberg&#x27;s illness, DG recorded the BSO with Rafael Kubelík in Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 5 (part of his cycle of Beethoven symphonies with nine different orchestras), &quot;Ma Vlast&quot; by Bedřich Smetana and in Béla Bartók&#x27;s Concerto for Orchestra as well as with Eugen Jochum conducting Symphony No. 41 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Franz Schubert&#x27;s Symphony No. 8.

As a guest conductor in the 1960s, Ozawa made several recordings with the BSO for RCA Victor. He continued the BSO relationship with DG while making several other releases for New World Records. Over the course of Ozawa&#x27;s tenure, the BSO diversified its relationships, making recordings under Ozawa with CBS, EMI, Philips Records, RCA, and TELARC.

The BSO also recorded for Philips under Colin Davis. Leonard Bernstein made records for both Columbia and DG with the BSO, including selections from his last concert ever as a conductor on August 19, 1990, at Tanglewood. The BSO has also appeared on Decca with Vladimir Ashkenazy, with Charles Dutoit and André Previn for DG, and on Phillips and Sony Classical with Bernard Haitink.

The BSO has also done recordings for film scores on occasion. Films such as &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (both composed and conducted by John Williams) were recorded by the orchestra at Symphony Hall.

In the James Levine era, the BSO had no standing recording contract with a major label; the Grammy Award-winning recording of Levine conducting the BSO with Lorraine Hunt Lieberson in Peter Lieberson&#x27;s &quot;Neruda Songs&quot;, released on Nonesuch Records, was the only major label recording during Levine&#x27;s tenure. On February 19, 2009, the BSO announced the launch of a new series of recordings on their own label, BSO Classics. Some of the recordings are available only as digital downloads. The initial recordings included live concert performances of William Bolcom&#x27;s 8th Symphony and &quot;Lyric Concerto,&quot; the latter with flutist James Galway, Mahler&#x27;s Sixth Symphony, the Brahms &quot;Ein deutsches Requiem&quot;, and Ravel&#x27;s complete &quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot;, which won the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Orchestral Performance.

In April 2015, the BSO announced a new recording partnership with Deutsche Grammophon that focuses on the music of Dmitri Shostakovich, with Nelsons as conductor. The first recording in the series, of the Tenth Symphony recorded in concert in April 2015, was released on CD in August 2015, and subsequently won the year&#x27;s Grammy award for Best Orchestral Performance. The most recent recording in the series, released in October 2023, concluded the cycle of Shostakovich symphonies, featuring performances of the 2nd, 3rd, 12th, and 13th symphonies.

<text>John Ballance (27 March 1839 – 27 April 1893) was a New Zealand politician who served as the 14th premier of New Zealand from January 1891 until his death in April 1893. He governed as the leader of New Zealand&#x27;s first organised political party, the New Zealand Liberal Party, which was formed shortly after the 1890 election.

Born in Ireland, Ballance emigrated to New Zealand in 1866, where he initially worked as a journalist before entering politics. He represented Whanganui in Parliament, and was known for his progressive and reformist views. Elected leader of the Opposition in 1889, Ballance led liberal factions to victory in the 1890 election. His Liberal Government implemented progressive policies, including land reform, and introduced a land tax influenced by Georgist principles. It also laid the groundwork for women&#x27;s suffrage, achieved shortly after his death.

Ballance emphasised egalitarianism and sought to balance the interests of urban workers and rural farmers. Despite his relatively short tenure, his reforms profoundly influenced the country&#x27;s political landscape. Ballance died in office in 1893. He was succeeded as head of government by Richard Seddon.

==Early life==
The eldest son of Samuel Ballance, a tenant farmer, and Mary McNiece, Ballance was born on 27 March 1839 in Glenavy in County Antrim Ireland (modern-day Northern Ireland). He was educated at a national school, then apprenticed to an ironmonger in Belfast. He later became a clerk in a wholesale ironmonger&#x27;s house in Birmingham, where he married. Ballance was highly interested in literature, and was known for spending vast amounts of time reading books. He also became interested in politics, mostly due to the influence of his parents – his father was active in conservative circles, while his mother was a liberal and a Quaker. It was from his mother that Ballance gained many of the ideas he was later to promote. Having witnessed religious rioting when in Belfast, he became committed to the principle of secularism.
In 1866, Ballance and his wife migrated to New Zealand, intending to start in business as a small jeweller. After settling in Wanganui, however, he took an opportunity to found a newspaper, &quot;The Wanganui Herald&quot;. He became the editor, and remained chief owner for the rest of his life. During the fighting with the Māori chief Titokowaru in 1867, Ballance was involved in the raising of a volunteer cavalry troop, in which he received a commission. He was later deprived of this owing to the appearance in the Herald of articles criticising the management of the campaign. He behaved well in the field, and, in spite of his dismissal, was awarded the New Zealand Medal.

Following the conflict, Ballance&#x27;s status in Wanganui grew. He was respected for his management of the Herald, particularly his forthright and direct approach to reporting. He became increasingly involved in the affairs of the town, establishing a number of societies and associations. Perhaps the least important to Wanganui but among the most important to him was the chess club – he became a skilled player. In 1868 his wife Fanny died of illness, aged only 24. Two years later, he married Ellen Anderson, the daughter of a Wellington merchant.

==Member of Parliament==



Ballance first contemplated moving into national politics in 1872, putting his name forward as a candidate for the seat of Egmont in a parliamentary by-election. However, Ballance withdrew from the ballot before the vote was held. In 1875, Ballance entered Parliament, having won Rangitikei in a by-election. He campaigned on two major issues – the abolition of the provinces (widely regarded as incompetent, petty, and obstructive) and the provision of free education. Ballance soon made his presence felt in Wellington. The abolition of the provinces occurred in 1876 under Julius Vogel—after which Ballance turned his attention to promoting closer land settlement, considering it the main political issue of the day.

===Grey Ministry===
In 1877, Ballance entered the cabinet of Sir George Grey, a former Governor who was then Premier. Grey&#x27;s policies were not closely aligned with those of Ballance, but Ballance believed that he could nevertheless accomplish something worthwhile. He was Minister of Customs, Minister of Education, and later Colonial Treasurer. His appointment to head the treasury was a surprise to most, giving a high office to a relative newcomer on the political stage.

On 6 August 1878, Ballance delivered a financial statement, which was seen as the most significant since the public works announcement by Julius Vogel in 1870. Ballance set about reforming the tariff system by removing duties on basic necessities and introducing a modest though somewhat symbolic land tax, an idea he later revisited. His alliance with Grey ended with a notorious and very painful quarrel. Ballance found Grey far too controlling and authoritarian, resigning his portfolios yet still gave him confidence in the house.

From 1879 Ballance represented Wanganui, but in 1881 he lost by just four votes (393 to 397), and it was reported that seven of his supporters were too late to vote as their carriage broke down. He returned to Parliament for Wanganui in 1884.

===Stout Ministry===

On re-election as an Independent in 1884, Ballance became a minister in the Cabinet of Robert Stout, a fellow liberal. He was Minister of Lands and Immigration, Minister of Defence and Minister of Native Affairs (relations with Māori). In his role as Minister of Lands he encouraged intensive settlement of rural areas, aiming to increase the number of people leaving the cities to &quot;work the land&quot;, which he believed was essential to increase productivity and self-sufficiency. His system of state-aided &quot;village settlements&quot; – small holdings were leased by the Crown to farmers and money lent them to make a beginning of building and cultivation – was generally successful.

Despite this desire for increased settlement of colonist-held land, he strongly supported the rights of Māori to retain the land they still held – many other politicians of his time believed that acquisition of Māori land was essential for increasing settlement. He reduced military presence in areas where strong tensions with Māori existed, and made an attempt to familiarise himself with Māori language and culture. In 1887 Stout&#x27;s government lost the general election, but Ballance remained popular. Illness initially prevented his full participation in politics, but with his recovery in July 1889 he became Leader of the Opposition.

==Premier==
In 1890 Ballance led a loose coalition of liberal politicians to victory in the general election. The more liberal minded candidates at the election fared well as there was public discontent with the sitting administration. The background of the election was filled with strikes and an economic recession. Harry Atkinson, the Premier who had defeated Stout, was forced to resign, but not before stacking the Legislative Council with his supporters. This was a serious problem for Ballance&#x27;s premiership but he was able to overcome it, partly by reducing the life-tenure of legislative councillors to one term of seven years. His successful battle with the Governor over changes to the Legislative Council helped define the relationship between the elected Premier and the appointed Governor, mostly in the Premier&#x27;s favour.

As leader of Parliament&#x27;s liberal faction, he brought his allies and colleagues into the Liberal Party, New Zealand&#x27;s first political party, intended to embody the liberal ideas of Stout, Vogel, and Ballance himself. The next four premiers were from the party, although some (such as Richard Seddon) were more conservative than Ballance. Quiet and unassuming in manner and well read, Ballance always seemed fonder of his books and his chessboard than of public bustle. He has been described as &quot;unassuming and unpretentious&quot;, and was quiet, polite, and extremely patient.

After hand-picking a cabinet of men of considerable talent, Ballance led the government through two difficult years of economic reform. He appointed himself as Treasurer, and in this capacity, in 1891, he implemented new land and progressive income taxes, similar to that of the taxes introduced under Grey, though more radical. Several other notable pieces of legislation were passed by Ballance in this period, such as the Land Act 1892 and the Land for Settlements Act 1892. Despite initial outcry, the tax was seen as equitable by the people, who eventually found themselves better off as a result of such a great decrease in direct taxations. He was widely praised for his handling of the economy, which expanded greatly during his term. 

Ballance was actively involved in the advocacy of women&#x27;s suffrage, declaring to Parliament that he believed in the &quot;absolute equality of the sexes.&quot; This was a cause he had partially inherited from his colleague in the Stout government, Julius Vogel, and in which he was influenced by his politically astute wife.

==Death==

In 1893, at the height of his success and popularity, he died in Wellington of cancer. He was succeeded by Richard Seddon despite supporting Stout as his preferred successor. He was the first New Zealand Prime Minister to die in office.

A statue was erected to his memory in front of Parliament House, Wellington, in front of what is now the parliamentary library – Parliament has since moved to a bigger, adjacent building. Another statue was erected in Moutoa Gardens in Wanganui.

<text>Best-first search is a class of search algorithms which explores a graph by expanding the most promising node chosen according to a specified rule.

Judea Pearl described best-first search as estimating the promise of node &quot;n&quot; by a &quot;heuristic evaluation function formula_1 which, in general, may depend on the description of &quot;n&quot;, the description of the goal, the information gathered by the search up to that point, and most importantly, on any extra knowledge about the problem domain.&quot;

Some authors have used &quot;best-first search&quot; to refer specifically to a search with a heuristic that attempts to predict how close the end of a path is to a solution (or, goal), so that paths which are judged to be closer to a solution (or, goal) are expanded first. This specific type of search is called &quot;greedy best-first search&quot; or &quot;pure heuristic search&quot;.

Efficient selection of the current best candidate for extension is typically implemented using a priority queue.

The A* search algorithm is an example of a best-first search algorithm, as is B*. Best-first algorithms are often used for path finding in combinatorial search. Neither A* nor B* is a greedy best-first search, as they incorporate the distance from the start in addition to estimated distances to the goal.

==Greedy BeFS==

Using a greedy algorithm, expand the first successor of the parent. After a successor is generated:

# If the successor&#x27;s heuristic is better than its parent, the successor is set at the front of the queue (with the parent reinserted directly behind it), and the loop restarts.
# Else, the successor is inserted into the queue (in a location determined by its heuristic value). The procedure will evaluate the remaining successors (if any) of the parent.
Below is a pseudocode example of this algorithm, where queue represents a priority queue which orders nodes based on their heuristic distances from the goal. This implementation keeps track of visited nodes, and can therefore be used for undirected graphs. It can be modified to retrieve the path.
 procedure GBS(start, target) is:
 mark start as visited
 add start to queue
 while queue is not empty do:
 current_node ← vertex of queue with min distance to target
 remove current_node from queue
 foreach neighbor n of current_node do:
 if n not in visited then:
 if n is target:
 return n
 else:
 mark n as visited
 add n to queue
 return failure

<text>Serjeant William Ballantine SL (3 January 1812 – 9 January 1887) was an English Serjeant-at-law, a legal position defunct since the legal reforms of the 1870s.

==Early career==
Born in Howland Street, Tottenham Court Road in Camden, London, the son of a police-magistrate, Ballantine was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School, and called to the Bar in 1834. He joined the Criminal Court and travelled the judicial &#x27;Home Circuit&#x27;, which necessitated him attending courts in Hertfordshire, Kent, Surrey, Sussex and Essex. As a young man he had a wide familiarity with dramatic and literary society, meeting many writers, including Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray and Anthony Trollope, and this background helped to obtain for him a large legal practice, particularly in criminal cases. In the late 1840s, Ballantine became known as a formidable cross-examiner, having become involved in several famous cases, where he was able to display these skills. His great rival at during this period was Serjeant Parry (1816–1880).

==Serjeant-at-Law==

Ballantine became a Serjeant-at-law in 1856, being then entitled to wear the white coif or cap of that rank (see illustration). He was one of the last Serjeants in the courts, that title and position being abolished in the judicial reforms of 1874. During the 1860s, he took on a number of high-profile cases.

===Mordaunt divorce trial===
Ballantine served as Counsel for Sir Charles Mordaunt in the then notorious divorce case against his wife. Lady Mordaunt, who, much younger than her husband, informed him that he was not the father of her child. She admitted to him that she had committed adultery with a number of men, including the Prince of Wales, &#x27;often, and in open day.&#x27;

It became clear that because of these revelations that the Prince of Wales would have to be summoned to court to give evidence in the case. Although he could be subpoenaed, he could not be forced to give evidence; Queen Victoria, his mother, advised him not to attend the court. However, the Prince agreed to attend the court, and to be questioned. After delicate questioning by Lady Mordaunt&#x27;s counsel, the Prince denied that &#x27;any improper familiarity or criminal act&#x27; had taken place between himself and Lady Mordaunt. It was generally believed that by stating this the Prince had perjured himself.

Ballantine, as counsel for Lord Mordaunt, the plaintiff, was entitled to cross-examine the Prince of Wales. Instead, in an attempt to save the Prince from any embarrassment, he declared that he had no questions for His Royal Highness, thus saving the Prince&#x27;s honour. However, Ballantine lost the case because he had failed to convince the jury that Lady Mordaunt was guilty.

==Retirement==
In the early 1880s, Ballantine retired from the law in order to write and travel, publishing several volumes of reminiscences. His interest in the theatre and journalism made him a familiar sight around London. Although he was recognised as an incisive cross-examiner, Ballantine was not regarded by his peers as being &#x27;a model legal mind.&#x27; The &quot;Law Times&quot;, in a brief notice, stated that Ballantine &quot;left behind him scarcely any lesson, even in his own poor biography, which the rising generation could profitably learn.&quot; But in the same issue there is a full obituary with a detailed description of his life and career, ending with &quot;[…] he had an individuality of character which gave him a position almost unique in the estimation of the public. His intimate acquaintance with human nature made him an excellent prosecutor or counsel for the defence in criminal trials. […] He was a skilful cross-examiner, an amusing speaker, and a great adept in the art of penetrating the motives and designs of criminals.&quot;

He died at Margate on 9 January 1887, aged 76 years. 
Ballantine&#x27;s private life was considered Bohemian; and though he earned large sums, he died poor. Barrister and politician Sir Edward Clarke wrote that Ballantine spent the latter part of his life &quot;in exile at Boulogne, only being saved from poverty by the allowance made him by his son, which was generously supplemented by six members of the Bar&quot;.

==Family==
On 4 December 1841, he married Eliza, daughter of Henry Gyles of London. The DNB reports that he left no issue, but a variety of other sources record that he was the father of William Henry Walter Ballantine, an attorney on the South Eastern Circuit and a Member of Parliament.

==Other cases==
Among Ballantine&#x27;s other notable cases were:
*his successful prosecution of Franz Muller for the murder of Mr. Briggs in 1864,
*his successful prosecution of Madame Rachel for fraud in 1868,
*his skilful defence of the Tichborne claimant in 1871, and
*his defence of the Gaekwad (Gaekwar) Maharaja of Baroda in 1875, his fee in this last case being one of the largest ever known at the time.

<text>Robert Michael Ballantyne (24 April 1825 – 8 February 1894) was a Scottish author of juvenile fiction, who wrote more than a hundred books. He was also an accomplished artist: he exhibited some of his water-colours at the Royal Scottish Academy.

==Early life==
Ballantyne was born in Edinburgh on 24 April 1825, the ninth of ten children and the youngest son, of Alexander Thomson Ballantyne (1776–1847) and his wife Anne (1786–1855). Alexander was a newspaper editor and printer in the family firm of &quot;Ballantyne &amp; Co&quot; based at Paul&#x27;s Works on the Canongate, and Robert&#x27;s uncle James Ballantyne (1772–1833) was the printer for Scottish author Sir Walter Scott. In 1832-33 the family is known to have been living at 20 Fettes Row, in the northern New Town of Edinburgh. A UK-wide banking crisis in 1825 resulted in the collapse of the Ballantyne printing business the following year with debts of £130,000, which led to a decline in the family&#x27;s fortunes.

Ballantyne went to Canada aged 16, and spent five years working for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. He traded with the local First Nations and Native Americans for furs, which required him to travel by canoe and sleigh to the areas occupied by the modern-day provinces of Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec, experiences that formed the basis of his novel &quot;The Young Fur Traders&quot; (1856). His longing for family and home during that period impressed him to start writing letters to his mother. Ballantyne recalled in his autobiographical &quot;Personal Reminiscences in Book Making&quot; (1893) that &quot;To this long-letter writing I attribute whatever small amount of facility in composition I may have acquired.&quot;

==Writing career==
In 1847 Ballantyne returned to Scotland to discover that his father had died. He published his first book the following year, &quot;Hudson&#x27;s Bay: or, Life in the Wilds of North America&quot;, and for some time was employed by the publishers Messrs Constable. In 1856, he gave up business to focus on his literary career, and began the series of adventure stories for the young with which his name is popularly associated.

&quot;The Young Fur-Traders&quot; (1856), &quot;The Coral Island&quot; (1857), &quot;The World of Ice&quot; (1859), &quot;Ungava: a Tale of Eskimo Land&quot; (1857), &quot;The Dog Crusoe&quot; (1860), &quot;The Lighthouse&quot; (1865), &quot;Fighting the Whales&quot; (1866), &quot;Deep Down&quot; (1868), &quot;The Pirate City&quot; (1874), &quot;Erling the Bold&quot; (1869), &quot;The Settler and the Savage&quot; (1877), and more than 100 other books followed in regular succession, his rule being to write as far as possible from personal knowledge of the scenes he described. &quot;The Gorilla Hunters. A tale of the wilds of Africa&quot; (1861) shares three characters with &quot;The Coral Island&quot;: Jack Martin, Ralph Rover and Peterkin Gay. Here Ballantyne relied factually on Paul du Chaillu&#x27;s &quot;Exploration in Equatorial Guinea&quot;, which had appeared early in the same year.

&quot;The Coral Island&quot; is the most popular of the Ballantyne novels still read and remembered today, but because of one mistake he made in that book, in which he gave an incorrect thickness of coconut shells, he subsequently attempted to gain first-hand knowledge of his subject matter. For instance, he spent some time living with the lighthouse keepers at the Bell Rock before writing &quot;The Lighthouse&quot;, and while researching for &quot;Deep Down&quot; he spent time with the tin miners of Cornwall.

In 1857–58, Ballantyne wrote several nursery tales under the pseudonym &#x27;Comus&#x27;, including &quot;Three Little Kittens&quot; (1857), &quot;My Mother&quot; (1857), &quot;The Butterfly&#x27;s Ball and the Grasshopper&#x27;s Feast&quot; (1857), &quot;Mister Fox&quot; (1857), and &quot;The Robber Kitten&quot; (1858). They were printed by Thomas Nelson and Sons in illustrated editions with verse versions (in the case of &quot;The Butterfly&#x27;s Ball&quot; by William Roscoe and &quot;My Mother&quot; by Ann Taylor) and musical arrangements for piano and for a duet with a child.

In 1866 Ballantyne married Jane Grant ( – ), with whom he had three sons and three daughters.

==Later life and death==

Ballantyne spent his later years in Harrow, London, before moving to Italy for the sake of his health, possibly suffering from undiagnosed Ménière&#x27;s disease. He died in Rome on 8 February 1894, and was buried in the Protestant Cemetery there.

==Legacy==
A Greater London Council plaque commemorates Ballantyne at &quot;Duneaves&quot; on Mount Park Road in Harrow.

One of the young men influenced by Ballantyne was Robert Louis Stevenson (1850–94). He was so impressed with the story of &quot;The Coral Island&quot; (1857) that he based portions of his famous book &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1881) on themes found in Ballantyne. He honoured Ballantyne in the introduction to &quot;Treasure Island&quot; with the following poem:

<doc id="148279" wikidata="Q2580474" url="?curid=148279" title="Culture of Chile">
<text>The culture of [[Chile]] reflects the population and the geographic isolation of the country in relation to the rest of South America. Since colonial times, the Chilean culture has been a mix of Spanish colonial elements with elements of indigenous (mostly Mapuche) culture, as well as that of other immigrant cultures.

The Huasos of Central Chile and their native or folk music and dance are central to Chilean folk culture. Even though the folk traditions of Central Chile are central to Chilean cultural and national identity, Chile is both geographically and culturally diverse with both the North and the South having their own folk music and dance due to different indigenous peoples and different immigrant groups settling there. Additionally, while some regions of Chile have very strong indigenous heritage, such as Araucanía Region, Easter Island, and Arica y Parinacota Region, some regions lack considerable indigenous communities and a few other regions have noteworthy non-Spanish European immigrant heritage.

== National identity ==
The term &quot;Chilenidad&quot; describes the Chilean National identity.

Hernán Godoy describes the psychological characteristics of the Chilean, and hence part of the Chilean national identity, with following words: roto, madness, sober, serious, prudent, sense of humor, great fear to the ridicule, servile, cruel, and lack of foresight, among other qualities. Jorge Larraín criticized these older descriptions as &quot;overgeneralized abstractions&quot; impossible to apply to a whole nation.

== Cultural expressions ==

=== Music ===

The national dance of Chile is the cueca (short for &quot;Zamacueca&quot;) and first appeared in 1824. Another form of traditional Chilean song, though not a dance, is the &quot;tonada&quot;. Arising
imported by the Spanish colonists, it is distinguished from the cueca by an intermediate melodic section and a more prominent melody. The cueca was promoted by the Pinochet regime in the 1970s and 1980s for political reasons to promote Chilean nationalism, cultural pride and conservative patriotic fervor.

In the period from 1930 to 1970, a rebirth in the interest and popularity in folk music in Chile appeared, carried out initially by groups such as Los Cuatro Huasos, who took folk songs from the Chilean country and arranged them vocally and with musical instruments. They gave several recitals in Chile, and in Latin America that contributed with its diffusion. Later appeared other groups such as Los de Ramon, Los Huasos Quincheros, Los Cuatro Cuartos, and others who continued with this diffusion. Also appeared several Chilean folk composers such as Raul de Ramon, Margot Loyola, Luis Aguirre Pinto, Violeta Parra, Víctor Jara, and others that carried out folk investigation and composed folk music that is still sung up to this day.

In the mid-1960s native musical forms were revitalized by the Parra family with the Nueva Canción Chilena, which became associated with political activism and reformers like Chilean socialist Salvador Allende and his Popular Unity government. Violeta Parra, Víctor Jara, Los Jaivas, Inti-Illimani, Illapu and Quilapayún perform of this music. During the military rule in the 1970s, all forms of public expression contrary to the junta were repressed, and protest songs, which were played and circulated in a clandestine manner. In the late 1980s and after the return of democracy in the 1990s, new musical bands like La Ley, Los Tres and Los Prisioneros, began to appear, and the rise of heavy metal and alternative rock there. Even 1970s Chilean rock bands like the Los Ángeles Negros regained popularity across Latin America. In 2000s, bands like Los Bunkers, Chancho en piedra, Sinergia or 31 Minutos reinvented chilean national rock.

=== Literature ===

Chile&#x27;s most famous contributions to literature have come from Nobel Prize poets Pablo Neruda and Gabriela Mistral, whose homes and birthplaces are now museums that attract literary pilgrims to Chile. The majority of Neruda&#x27;s poetry, as individual books or collections of selected poems, as well as his memoirs, are widely available in English, however Mistral&#x27;s works are harder to find, though collected editions are available.

José Donoso&#x27;s novel &quot;Curfew&quot; recalls the latter days of the recent military dictatorship, while Antonio Skármeta&#x27;s novel &quot;Burning Patience&quot; (drawing on Neruda&#x27;s life as a Chilean icon) was the inspiration for the Oscar-winning Italian film, Il Postino (The Postman).

=== Arts ===

Established in 1849, the Academy of Painting (Santiago, Chile) has helped foster fine painting and inspire young artists. Roberto Matta, a 20th-century painter, is a world known artist who used abstract and surrealist technique in his work. Carlos Sotomayor (1911–1988) is considered one of the main exponents of cubism from South America. Camilo Mori (1896–1973) was the founder of the Group Montparnasse. Claudio Bravo (1936–2011) was a hyper realist who lived and worked in Morocco since 1972.

Sculpture has also been prominent in Chile&#x27;s culture. In the 19th century, sculptor Rebeca Matte (1875–1929) was the first Chilean woman to embrace the art. She was commissioned to produce a piece by the government of Chile as a gift to the government of Brazil which she called &quot;Icarus and Daedalus&quot; (United in Glory and Peace). In 1930, her husband donated a bronze copy to the Museum of Fine Arts in Santiago which is recognized as a leading masterpiece. Matte also created a battle monument as a tribute to the heroes of Concepción. In the 20th century, Marta Colvin (1907–1995) gained international status by exhibiting her work in cities around the world.

In the field of classical music, the International Society for Chilean Music is a non-profit organization committed to a comprehensive mission of promoting and disseminating the artistic efforts of Chilean musicians, both in Chile and around the world. To this end, they have compiled and disseminated a report published in 2022 (translated the following year), which summarizes their efforts, since its inception, to promote the cause of Chilean music and its exponents, both at Chile and abroad.
=== Cuisine ===
Chilean cuisine uses a variety of products due to Chile&#x27;s location and long coastline. The cuisine arose from the fusion of traditional indigenous ingredients with Spanish culture and traditions. Further European immigration also brought various styles and traditions in cooking were heavily influenced by the Italians and the Germans. In the 20th century, French cuisine marked an important turning point influencing culinary methods and creating a type of Criollo style that has been implemented now in Chilean cooking. British cooking influences include the &quot;onces&quot; or tea breaks usually taken in the afternoon among Chileans of all classes and backgrounds. Many Chilean recipes are enhanced and accompanied by wine and Chilean &quot;pisco&quot;, a type of grape brandy produced in Chile, Pisco is also consumed in neighbouring Peru. Throughout Chile each region spanning from north to south contain a variety of culinary recipes special to each location.

=== Television ===
=== Cinema ===

Domestic film production in Chile is still small but dynamic, it has been steadily growing since 1990 and the country now produces about 20 motion pictures annually. The most important filmmakers include Raúl Ruiz (&quot;Palomita Blanca&quot;), Miguel Littín (&quot;El chacal de Nahueltoro&quot;), Silvio Caiozzi (&quot;Julio comienza en julio&quot;), Andrés Wood (&quot;Machuca&quot;), Pablo Larrain (&quot;No&quot;) and Sebastián Lelio (&quot;A Fantastic Woman&quot;). In short animation, Gabriel Osorio (&quot;Bear Story&quot;). Other entertainment includes radio and television with TVN (Television Nacional de Chile) owned but not paid by the government but funding comes from commercial sponsors by private companies and media productions.

Chile&#x27;s small and steadily growing film industry has had some hard time filming compared to countries like the United States. A lot of the most successful films before the 1960s were imported form the U.S., Europe, and other Latin American countries. With Chile&#x27;s film industry really not having as much funding, technology, and education to keep up with some of the bigger filmmakers. Despite the small start, in the recent years Chile&#x27;s filming industry continues to grow. In the early 2000s things started to take a better turn for the industry as a whole. With the Universidad de Valparaíso, Universidad de Chile and Universidad Católica offer careers in cinematography, which means the expansion and establishment of formal instruction in this field after 2004. Also after 2004, Chile&#x27;s film industry stated the use of digital cameras, which lowered the cost of production.

Chilean cinema has won an Academy Award on two occasions, Bear Story for Best Animated Short Film and A Fantastic Woman for Best Foreign Language Film.

=== Sports ===

==== Football (soccer) ====

Football is the most popular sport in Chile, and practiced by Chileans from all economic backgrounds, it is the one sport that appeals to both young and old that is the most accessible. The Federación de Fútbol de Chile is the governing body of &quot;fútbol&quot; in Chile. Practices such as &quot;baby fútbol&quot;, which is a street level scrimmage match, is played on areas made of concrete. Located throughout Chile are football stadiums such as Estadio Nacional de Chile located in Santiago, and where the final of the 1962 FIFA World Cup was held. Chile was banned in FIFA participation in the early 1990s due to a faked player injury on the field during a 1989 playoff game and could not appear in the 1990 and 1994 FIFA World Cup events as a result.

==== Skiing ====
Chile practices a host of sporting events, and because of its geographical location that is situated between the Andes Mountains and the Pacific Ocean, skiing and snowboarding are done in between those two locations. With more than of mountains, Chile is known internationally as one of the world&#x27;s best skiing destinations and the best in South America. This is a very popular sport in Chile among the wealthier classes (considering that this is an expensive sport in this country). This recognition is based on the excellent quality of the slopes, a beautiful landscape, accessibility and proximity to urban centers. Santiago de Chile is interested in hosting the Winter Olympics in the future, destined to be the second site in the southern hemisphere.

The main ski centers are located in Central Chile right in the middle of the Andes, at heights that vary from up to above sea level. These centers are the ones with the biggest skiing surfaces as well as the best supporting infrastructure.

The centers of Southern Chile are located at lower altitudes and most of them are on volcano slopes. The scenery is notable, including scenic forests and panoramic views.

==== Surfing ====

Chile is a great surfing destination, and from the Northern region to the Central region there are many beaches with the right conditions for the sport. It is possible to surf almost all year round except for the middle of the winter (July and August) when weather conditions are non-conducive to surfing. The water temperature fluctuates between .

In northern Chile, the waves are smaller, but very forceful, and between Arica and Iquique, &quot;tubes&quot; are common. The temperature of the water fluctuates between . Due to the difficult conditions of the Atacama Desert, there are many unexplored, quiet beaches in that area. In the Central Region, the water is a little bit colder, and there are steeper shores and bigger waves.

==== Basketball ====
In addition to football (soccer), basketball is particularly popular in southern Chile, where it as an indoor sport can be played all year round despite Southern Chile&#x27;s cold and rainy winters. The &quot;NCBAOC&quot; is the official league. It stands for the National Chile Basketball Association of Chile.

==== Rodeo ====
Rodeo was declared the national sport in 1962. It has since thrived, especially in the more rural areas of the country. Chilean rodeo is different from the rodeo found in North America. In Chilean rodeo, a team (called a &quot;collera&quot;) consisting of two riders (called Huasos) and two horses rides laps around an arena trying to stop a calf, pinning him against massive cushions. Points are earned for every time the steer is properly driven around the corral, with deductions for faults. Rodeos are conducted in a crescent-shaped corral called a medialuna.

Unlike rodeos in other countries, there is no bull riding or using ropes to tie up cattle. And the idea behind the point system in the game is to get a high number of points. Getting these points takes a high amount of skill. Deductions for faults may included, incorrect maneuvering or the cow escaping. Each pair of Huasos start with 13 points then the deduction system comes into play. Every official rodeo is held over two days, normally Saturdays and Sundays, though occasionally it will be held on Chilean Public holidays.

<text>Hosea Ballou D.D. (April 30, 1771 – June 7, 1852) was an American Universalist clergyman and theological writer.

Originally a Baptist, he converted to Universalism in 1789. He preached in a number of towns in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts. From 1817, he was pastor of the Second Universalist Church of Boston. He wrote a number of influential theological works, as well as hymns, essays and sermons, and edited two Universalist journals. Ballou has been called one of the fathers of American Universalism.

==Life and career==
Hosea Ballou was born in Richmond, New Hampshire, to a family of Huguenot origin. The family claimed to be of Anglo-Norman heritage. The son of Maturin Ballou, a Baptist minister, Hosea Ballou was self-educated, and devoted himself early on to the ministry. In 1789 he converted to Universalism, and in 1794 became pastor of a congregation in Dana, Massachusetts. Ballou was also a high-ranking freemason, who attained the position of Junior Grand Warden of the Grand Lodge of New Hampshire in 1811.

Ballou preached at Barnard, Vermont, and surrounding towns in 1801–1807; at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in 1807–1815; at Salem, Massachusetts, in 1815–1817; and, as pastor of the Second Universalist Church of Boston, from December 1817 until his death there. He was buried at the Mount Auburn Cemetery.

He founded and edited &quot;The Universalist Magazine&quot; (1819–later called &quot;The Trumpet&quot;), and &quot;The Universalist Expositor&quot; (1831–later &quot;The Universalist Quarterly Review&quot;), and wrote about 10,000 sermons as well as many hymns, essays and polemic theological works. He is best known for &quot;Notes on the Parables&quot; (1804), &quot;A Treatise on Atonement&quot; (1805) and &quot;Examination of the Doctrine of a Future Retribution&quot; (1834). These works mark him as the principal American expositor of Universalism.

Ballou married Ruth Washburn; children included Maturin Murray Ballou. He is the grand-uncle of Hosea Ballou II, the first president of Tufts University.

==Beliefs==
Ballou has been called the &quot;father of American Universalism,&quot; along with John Murray, who founded the first Universalist church in America. Ballou, sometimes called an &quot;Ultra Universalist,&quot; differed from Murray in that he divested Universalism of every trace of Calvinism, and opposed legalism and trinitarian views. As he wrote, &quot;Real happiness is cheap enough, yet how dearly we pay for its counterfeit.&quot;

Ballou also preached that those forms of Christianity that emphasized God as wrathful in turn hardened the hearts of their believers:
==Hymns==
In 1844 Ballou published &quot;A Collection of Psalms and Hymns for the Use of Universalist Societies and Families.&quot; None of his hymns is included in the Unitarian hymnal &quot;Singing The Living Tradition&quot; (1993), but his thoughts appear in Reading #705.

In 1979, during development of the Motorola 68000 CPU, one of their engineers, Jack Kister, decided to set about creating a standardized bus system for 68000-based systems. The Motorola team brainstormed for days to select the name VERSAbus. VERSAbus cards were large, , and used edge connectors. Only a few products adopted it, including the IBM System 9000 instrument controller and the Automatix robot and machine vision systems.
Kister was later joined by John Black, who refined the specifications and created the &quot;VERSAmodule&quot; product concept. A young engineer working for Black, Julie Keahey designed the first VERSAmodule card, the VERSAbus Adaptor Module, used to run existing cards on the new VERSAbus. Sven Rau and Max Loesel of Motorola-Europe added a mechanical specification to the system, basing it on the Eurocard standard that was then late in the standardization process. The result was first known as VERSAbus-E but was later renamed to &quot;VMEbus&quot;, for &quot;VERSAmodule Eurocard bus&quot; (although some refer to it as &quot;Versa Module Europa&quot;).

At this point, a number of other companies involved in the 68000&#x27;s ecosystem agreed to use the standard, including Signetics, Philips, Thomson, and Mostek. Soon it was officially standardized by the IEC as the IEC 821 VMEbus and by ANSI and IEEE as ANSI/IEEE 1014-1987.

The original standard was a 16-bit bus, designed to fit within the existing Eurocard DIN connectors. However, there have been several updates to the system to allow wider bus widths. The current &quot;VME64&quot; includes a full 64-bit bus in 6U-sized cards and 32-bit in 3U cards. The VME64 protocol has a typical performance of 40 MB/s. Other associated standards have added hot-swapping (plug-and-play) in &quot;VME64x&quot;, smaller &#x27;IP&#x27; cards that plug into a single VMEbus card, and various interconnect standards for linking VME systems together.

In the late 1990s, synchronous protocols proved to be favourable. The research project was called VME320. The VITA Standards Organization called for a new standard for unmodified VME32/64 backplanes. The new 2eSST protocol was approved in ANSI/VITA 1.5 in 1999.

Over the years, many extensions have been added to the VME interface, providing &#x27;sideband&#x27; channels of communication in parallel to VME itself. Some examples are IP Module, RACEway Interlink, SCSA, Gigabit Ethernet on VME64x Backplanes, PCI Express, RapidIO, StarFabric and InfiniBand.

VMEbus was also used to develop closely related standards, VXIbus and VPX.
The VMEbus had a strong influence on many later computer buses such as STEbus.

===VME early years===
The architectural concepts of the VMEbus are based on VERSAbus, developed in the late 1970s by Motorola. This was later renamed &quot;VME&quot;, short for Versa Module European, by Lyman (Lym) Hevle, then a VP with the Motorola Microsystems Operation. (He was later the founder of the VME Marketing Group, itself subsequently renamed to VME International Trade Association, or VITA). 

John Black of Motorola, Craig MacKenna of Mostek and Cecil Kaplinsky of Signetics developed the first draft of the VMEbus specification. In October 1981, at the System &#x27;81 trade show in Munich, West Germany, Motorola, Mostek, Signetics/Philips, and Thomson CSF announced their joint support of the VMEbus. They also placed Revision A of the specification in the public domain. 

In 1985, Aitech developed, under contract for US Army TACOM, the first conduction-cooled 6U VMEbus board. Although electrically providing a compliant VMEbus protocol interface, mechanically, this board was not interchangeable for use in air-cooled lab VMEbus development chassis.

In late 1987, a technical committee was formed under VITA under the direction of IEEE to create the first military, conduction-cooled 6U× 160mm, fully electrically and mechanically compatible, VMEbus board co-chaired by Dale Young (DY4 Systems) and Doug Patterson (Plessey Microsystems, then Radstone Technology). ANSI/IEEE-1101.2-1992 was later ratified and released in 1992 and remains in place as the conduction-cooled, international standard for all 6U VMEbus products.

In 1989, John Peters of Performance Technologies Inc. developed the initial concept of VME64: multiplexing address and data lines (A64/D64) on the VMEbus. The concept was demonstrated the same year and placed in the VITA Technical Committee in 1990 as a performance enhancement to the VMEbus specification.

In 1993, new activities began on the base-VME architecture, involving the implementation of high-speed serial and parallel sub-buses for use as I/O interconnections and data mover subsystems. These architectures can be used as message switches, routers and small multiprocessor parallel architectures.

VITA&#x27;s application for recognition as an accredited standards developer organization of ANSI was granted in June 1993. Numerous other documents ( including mezzanine, P2 and serial bus standards) have been placed with VITA as the Public Domain Administrator of these technologies.

== Description ==
In many ways the VMEbus is equivalent or analogous to the pins of the 68000 run out onto a backplane.

However, one of the key features of the 68000 is a flat 32-bit memory model, free of memory segmentation and other &quot;anti-features&quot;. The result is that, while VME is very 68000-like, the 68000 is generic enough to make this not an issue in most cases.

Like the 68000, VME uses separate 32-bit data and address buses. The 68000 address bus is actually 24-bit and the data bus 16-bit (although it is 32/32 internally) but the designers were already looking towards a full 32-bit implementation.

In order to allow both bus widths, VME uses two different Eurocard connectors, P1 and P2. P1 contains three rows of 32 pins each, implementing the first 24 address bits, 16 data bits and all of the control signals. P2 contains one more row, which includes the remaining 8 address bits and 16 data bits.

A block transfer protocol allows several bus transfers to occur with a single address cycle. In block transfer mode, the first transfer includes an address cycle and subsequent transfers require only data cycles. The slave is responsible for ensuring that these transfers use successive addresses.

Bus masters can release the bus in two ways. With Release When Done (RWD), the master releases the bus when it completes a transfer and must re-arbitrate for the bus before every subsequent transfer. With Release On Request (ROR), the master retains the bus by continuing to assert BBSY* between transfers. ROR allows the master to retain control over the bus until a Bus Clear (BCLR*) is asserted by another master that wishes to arbitrate for the bus. Thus a master that generates bursts of traffic can optimize &quot;its&quot; performance by arbitrating for the bus on only the first transfer of each burst. This decrease in transfer latency comes at the cost of somewhat higher transfer latency for other masters.

Address modifiers are used to divide the VME bus address space into several distinct sub-spaces. The address modifier is a 6 bit wide set of signals on the backplane. Address modifiers specify the number of significant address bits, the privilege mode (to allow processors to distinguish between bus accesses by user-level or system-level software), and whether or not the transfer is a block transfer.
Below is an incomplete table of address modifiers:

On the VME bus, all transfers are DMA and every card is a master or slave. In most bus standards, there is a considerable amount of complexity added in order to support various transfer types and master/slave selection. For instance, with the ISA bus, both of these features had to be added alongside the existing &quot;channels&quot; model, whereby all communications was handled by the host CPU. This makes VME considerably simpler at a conceptual level while being more powerful, though it requires more complex controllers on each card.

==Development tools==
When developing and/or troubleshooting the VME bus, examination of hardware signals can be very important. Logic analyzers and bus analyzers are tools that collect, analyze, decode, store signals so people can view the high-speed waveforms at their leisure.

VITA offers a comprehensive FAQ to assist with the front end design and development of VME systems.

<doc id="148282" wikidata="Q408520" url="?curid=148282" title="Acetylcholine receptor">
<text>An acetylcholine receptor (abbreviated AChR) or a cholinergic receptor is an integral membrane protein that responds to the binding of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter.

==Classification==
Like other transmembrane receptors, acetylcholine receptors are classified according to their &quot;pharmacology,&quot; or according to their relative affinities and sensitivities to different molecules. Although all acetylcholine receptors, by definition, respond to acetylcholine, they respond to other molecules as well.

*Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (&quot;nAChR&quot;, also known as &quot;ionotropic&quot; acetylcholine receptors) are particularly responsive to nicotine. The nicotine ACh receptor is also a Na+, K+ and Ca2+ ion channel.
*Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (&quot;mAChR&quot;, also known as &quot;metabotropic&quot; acetylcholine receptors) are particularly responsive to muscarine.

Nicotinic and muscarinic are two main kinds of &quot;cholinergic&quot; receptors.

==Receptor types==
Molecular biology has shown that the nicotinic and muscarinic receptors belong to distinct protein superfamilies. Nicotinic receptors are of two types: Nm and Nn. Nm is located in the neuromuscular junction which causes the contraction of skeletal muscles by way of end-plate potential (EPPs). Nn causes depolarization in autonomic ganglia resulting in post ganglionic impulse. Nicotinic receptors cause the release of catecholamine from the adrenal medulla, and also site specific excitation or inhibition in brain. Both Nm and Nn receptor types are non-selective cation channels, permeable to sodium and potassium ions, in addition to that, Nn type receptors allow for calcium ion flow.

===nAChR===

The nAChRs are ligand-gated ion channels, and, like other members of the &quot;cys-loop&quot; ligand-gated ion channel superfamily, are composed of five protein subunits symmetrically arranged like staves around a barrel. The subunit composition is highly variable across different tissues. Each subunit contains four regions which span the membrane and consist of approximately 20 amino acids. Region II which sits closest to the pore lumen, forms the pore lining.

Binding of acetylcholine to the N termini of each of the two alpha subunits results in the 15° rotation of all M2 helices. The cytoplasm side of the nAChR receptor has rings of high negative charge that determine the specific cation specificity of the receptor and remove the hydration shell often formed by ions in aqueous solution. In the intermediate region of the receptor, within the pore lumen, valine and leucine residues (Val 255 and Leu 251) define a hydrophobic region through which the dehydrated ion must pass.

The nAChR is found at the edges of junctional folds at the neuromuscular junction on the postsynaptic side; it is activated by acetylcholine release across the synapse. The diffusion of Na+ and K+ across the receptor causes depolarization, the end-plate potential, that opens voltage-gated sodium channels, which allows for firing of the action potential and potentially muscular contraction.

===mAChR===

In contrast, the mAChRs are not ion channels, but belong instead to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors that activate other ionic channels via a second messenger cascade.
The muscarine cholinergic receptor activates a G-protein when bound to extracellular ACh. The alpha subunit of the G-protein activates guanylate cyclase (inhibiting the effects of intracellular cAMP) while the beta-gamma subunit activates the K-channels and therefore hyperpolarize the cell. This causes a decrease in cardiac activity.

== Origin and evolution ==
ACh receptors are related to GABA, glycine, and 5-HT3 receptors and their similar protein sequence and gene structure strongly suggest that they evolved from a common ancestral receptor. In fact, relatively minor mutations, such as a change in 3 amino acids in many of these receptors can convert a cation-selective channel to an anion-selective channel gated by acetylcholine, showing that even fundamental properties can relatively easily change in evolution.

== Pharmacology ==
Acetylcholine receptor modulators can be classified by which receptor subtypes they act on:
==Role in health and disease==
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors can be blocked by curare, hexamethonium and toxins present in the venoms of snakes and shellfishes, like α-bungarotoxin. Drugs such as the neuromuscular blocking agents bind reversibly to the nicotinic receptors in the neuromuscular junction and are used routinely in anaesthesia. Nicotinic receptors are the primary mediator of the effects of nicotine. In myasthenia gravis, the receptor at the neuromuscular junction is targeted by antibodies, leading to muscle weakness.

Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors can be blocked by the drugs atropine and scopolamine.

Congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder caused by defects of several types at the neuromuscular junction. Postsynaptic defects are the most frequent cause of CMS and often result in abnormalities in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The majority of mutations causing CMS are found in the AChR subunits genes.

Out of all mutations associated with CMS, more than half are mutations in one of the four genes encoding the adult acetylcholine receptor subunits. Mutations of the AChR often result in endplate deficiency. Most of the mutations of the AChR are mutations of the CHRNE gene with mutations encoding for the Alpha5 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor cause increased susceptibility to addiction. The CHRNE gene codes for the epsilon subunit of the AChR. Most mutations are autosomal recessive loss-of-function mutations and as a result there is endplate AChR deficiency. CHRNE is associated with changing the kinetic properties of the AChR. One type of mutation of the epsilon subunit of the AChR introduces an Arg into the binding site at the α/ε subunit interface of the receptor. The addition of a cationic Arg into the anionic environment of the AChR binding site greatly reduces the kinetic properties of the receptor. The result of the newly introduced ARG is a 30-fold reduction of agonist affinity, 75-fold reduction of gating efficiency, and an extremely weakened channel opening probability. This type of mutation results in an extremely fatal form of CMS.

<text>The Velvet Revolution () or Gentle Revolution () was a non-violent transition of power in what was then Czechoslovakia, occurring from 17 November to 28 November 1989. Popular demonstrations against the one-party government of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia included students and older dissidents. The result was the end of 41 years of one-party rule in Czechoslovakia, and the subsequent dismantling of the command economy and conversion to a parliamentary republic.

On 17 November 1989 (International Students&#x27; Day), riot police suppressed a student demonstration in Prague. The event marked the 50th anniversary of a violently suppressed demonstration against the Nazi storming of Prague University in 1939 where 1,200 students were arrested and 9 killed (see Origin of International Students&#x27; Day). The 1989 event sparked a series of demonstrations from 17 November to late December and turned into an anti-communist demonstration. On 20 November, the number of protesters assembled in Prague grew from 200,000 the previous day to an estimated 500,000. The entire top leadership of the Communist Party, including General Secretary Miloš Jakeš, resigned on 24 November. On 27 November, a two-hour general strike involving all citizens of Czechoslovakia was held.

In response to the collapse of other Warsaw Pact governments and the increasing street protests, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia announced on 28 November that it would relinquish power and end the one-party state. Two days later, the federal parliament formally deleted the sections of the Constitution giving the Communist Party a monopoly of power. Barbed wire and other obstructions were removed from the border with West Germany and Austria in early December. On 10 December, President Gustáv Husák appointed the first largely non-communist government in Czechoslovakia since 1948, and resigned. Alexander Dubček was elected speaker of the federal parliament on 28 December and Václav Havel the President of Czechoslovakia on 29 December 1989.

In June 1990, Czechoslovakia held its first democratic elections since 1946. On 31 December 1992, Czechoslovakia peacefully split into two countries, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.

The dissolution of Czechoslovakia occurred mainly due to national governance issues between the Slovaks and Czechs (the two major ethnicities comprising the former Czechoslovakia).

==Prior to the revolution==
The Communist Party seized power on 25 February 1948. No official opposition parties operated thereafter. Dissidents (notably Charter 77 and Civic Forum) created Music Clubs (on a limited basis as only allowed NGOs) and published home-made periodicals (samizdat). Charter 77 was quashed by the government and its signed members were persecuted until the fall of the regime in Czechoslovakia. Later, with the advent of the Civic Forum, independence could truly be seen on the horizon. Until Independence Day on 17 November 1989, the populace faced persecution by the authorities from the secret police. Thus, the general public did not openly support the dissidents for fear of dismissal from work or school. Writers or filmmakers could have their books or films banned for a &quot;negative attitude towards the socialist regime&quot;. They also did not allow Czechs and Slovaks to travel to other non-communist countries. Following this they banned music from foreign countries. This blacklisting included children of former entrepreneurs or non-Communist politicians, having family members living in the West, having supported Alexander Dubček during the Prague Spring, opposing Soviet military occupation, promoting religion, boycotting (rigged) parliamentary elections or signing Charter 77 or associating with those who did. These rules were easy to enforce, as all schools, media and businesses belonged to the state. They were under direct supervision and often were used as accusatory weapons against rivals.

The nature of blacklisting changed gradually after the introduction of Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s policies of Glasnost (openness) and Perestroika (restructuring) in 1985. The Czechoslovak Communist leadership verbally supported Perestroika, but made few changes. Speaking about the Prague Spring of 1968 was taboo. The first anti-government demonstrations occurred in 1988 (the Candle Demonstration, for example) and 1989, but these were dispersed and participants were repressed by the police.

By the late 1980s, discontent with living standards and economic inadequacy gave way to popular support for economic reform. Citizens began to challenge the system more openly. By 1989, citizens who had been complacent were willing to openly express their discontent with the regime. Numerous important figures as well as ordinary workers signed petitions in support of Václav Havel during his imprisonment in 1989.

Already in early 1989, the first signs of thawing relations began to appear between Communist Czechoslovakia and Israel, with meetings held on shared issues, including Jewish religious freedom, the memory of the Holocaust and ties of remaining Czechoslovak Jews with the Diaspora, including the strong Jewish community in the United States.

Reform-minded attitudes were also reflected by the many individuals who signed a petition that circulated in the summer of 1989 calling for the end of censorship and the beginning of fundamental political reform.

The immediate impetus for the revolution came from developments in neighbouring countries and in the Czechoslovak capital. From August, East German citizens had occupied the West German Embassy in Prague and demanded exile to West Germany. In the days following 3 November, thousands of East Germans left Prague by train to West Germany. On 9 November, the Berlin Wall fell, removing the need for the detour.

By 16 November, many of Czechoslovakia&#x27;s neighbours were beginning to shed authoritarian rule. The citizens of Czechoslovakia watched these events on TV through both foreign and domestic channels. The Soviet Union also supported a change in the ruling elite of Czechoslovakia, although it did not anticipate the overthrow of the Communist regime.

==Chronology==

===16 November===
On the eve of International Students Day (the 50th anniversary of &quot;Sonderaktion Prag&quot;, the 1939 storming of Prague universities by the Nazis), Slovak high school and university students organised a peaceful demonstration in the centre of Bratislava. The Communist Party of Slovakia had expected trouble, and the mere fact that the demonstration was organised was viewed as a problem by the Party. Armed forces were put on alert before the demonstration. In the end, however, the students moved through the city peacefully and sent a delegation to the Slovak Ministry of Education to discuss their demands.

===17 November===
New movements led by Václav Havel surfaced, invoking the idea of a united society where the state would politically restructure. The Socialist Youth Union (SSM/SZM, proxy of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia) organised a mass demonstration on 17 November to commemorate International Students Day and the fiftieth anniversary of the murder of student Jan Opletal by the Nazi government.

Most members of SSM were privately opposed to the Communist leadership, but were afraid of speaking up for fear of persecution. This demonstration gave average students an opportunity to join others and express their opinions. By 16:00 (4:00 pm), about 15,000 people joined the demonstration. They walked (per the strategy of founders of Stuha movement, Jiří Dienstbier and Šimon Pánek) to Karel Hynek Mácha&#x27;s grave at Vyšehrad Cemetery and – after the official end of the march – continued into the centre of Prague, carrying banners and chanting anti-Communist slogans.

At about 19:30 (7:30pm), the demonstrators were stopped by a cordon of riot police at Národní Street. They blocked all escape routes and attacked the students. Once all the protesters dispersed, one of the participants, secret police agent Ludvík Zifčák, was lying on the street. Zifčák was not physically hurt or pretending to be dead; he simply fainted. Policemen carried his motionless body to an ambulance.

The atmosphere of fear and hopelessness gave birth to a hoax about a dead student named Martin Šmíd. The story was made up by Drahomíra Dražská as she awaited treatment after she was hurt during the riot. Dražská worked at the college and shared her hoax with several people the next day, including the wife of journalist Petr Uhl, a correspondent for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. This incident mobilised the people and triggered the revolution. That same evening, students and theatre actors agreed to go on strike.

===18 November===
Two students visited Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec at his private residence and described to him what happened on Národní Street. The strike at the Realistic Theatre was declared and other theatres quickly followed. The theaters opened their stages only for public discussions.

At the initiative of students from the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague, the students in Prague went on strike. This strike was joined by university students throughout Czechoslovakia. Theatre employees and actors in Prague supported the strike. Instead of going on stage, actors read a proclamation by the students and artists to the audience, calling for a general strike on 27 November.

Home-made posters and proclamations were posted. As all media (radio, TV, newspapers) were strictly controlled by the Communist Party (see Mass media in Communist Czechoslovakia), this was the only way to spread the message.

In the evening, Radio Free Europe reported that a student (named as Martin Šmíd) was killed by the police during the previous day&#x27;s demonstration. Although the report was false, it heightened the feeling of crisis, and persuaded some hesitant citizens to overcome their fear and join the protests.

===19 November===
Theatres in Bratislava, Brno, Ostrava and other towns went on strike. Members of artistic and literary associations as well as organisations and institutions joined the strike.

Members of a civic initiative met with the Prime Minister, who told them he was twice prohibited from resigning his post and that change requires mass demonstrations like those in East Germany (some 250,000 students). He asked them to keep the number of &quot;casualties&quot; during the expected change to a minimum.

About 500 Slovak artists, scientists and leaders met at the Art Forum (Umelecká beseda) in Bratislava at 17:00. They denounced the attack against the students in Prague on 17 November and formed Public Against Violence, which would become the leading force behind the opposition movement in Slovakia. Its founding members included Milan Kňažko, Ján Budaj and others.

Actors and members of the audience in a Prague theatre, together with Václav Havel and other prominent members of Charter 77 and other dissident organisations, established the Civic Forum (Občanské fórum, an equivalent of the Slovak Public Against Violence for the territory of the Czech Republic) as a mass popular movement for reforms. They called for the dismissal of top officials responsible for the violence, and an independent investigation of the incident and the release of all political prisoners.

College students went on strike. On television, government officials called for peace and a return to the city&#x27;s normal business. An interview with Martin Šmíd was broadcast to persuade the public that nobody had been killed, but the quality of the recording was low and rumours continued. It would take several more days to confirm that nobody was killed, and by then the revolution had gained further momentum.

The leaders of the Democratic Initiative presented several demands, including the resignation of the government, effective 25 November, and the formation of a temporary government composed of non-compromised members of the current government.

===20 November===
Students and theatres went on &quot;permanent&quot; strike. Police stopped a demonstration from continuing toward Prague Castle, which would have entered the striking theatres.

Civic Forum representatives negotiated unofficially with Adamec without Havel, and Adamec was sympathetic to the students&#x27; demands. However, he was outvoted in a special cabinet meeting the same day. The government, in an official statement, made no concessions.

Civic Forum added a demand: the abolition of the &quot;ruling position&quot; of the Communist Party from the Constitution. Non-Communist newspapers published information that contradicted the Communist interpretation. The first mass demonstration in Prague (100,000 people) and the first demonstrations in Bratislava occurred.

===21 November===

The first official meeting of the Civic Forum with the Prime Minister took place. The Prime Minister agreed to personally guarantee that no violence would be used against the people; however he would &quot;protect socialism, about which no discussion is possible&quot;. An organised mass demonstration took place in Wenceslas Square in central Prague (demonstrations recurred there throughout the following days). Actors and students travelled to factories inside and outside Prague to gain support for their colleagues in other cities.

A mass demonstration erupted in Hviezdoslav Square in downtown Bratislava (in the following days, it moved to the Square of the Slovak National Uprising). The students presented demands and asked the people to participate in the general strike planned for Monday, 27 November. A separate demonstration demanded the release of the political prisoner Ján Čarnogurský (later Prime Minister of Slovakia) in front of the Palace of Justice. Alexander Dubček addressed this demonstration – his first appearance during the Velvet Revolution. As a result, Čarnogurský was released on 23 November. Further demonstrations followed in all major cities of Czechoslovakia.

Cardinal František Tomášek, the Roman Catholic primate of the Bohemian lands, declared his support for the students and issued a declaration criticising the current government&#x27;s policies. For the first time during the Velvet Revolution, the &quot;radical&quot; demand to abolish the article of the Constitution establishing the &quot;leading role&quot; of the Communist Party was expressed by Ľubomír Feldek at a meeting of Public Against Violence.

In the evening, Miloš Jakeš, the chairman of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, gave a special address on Federal Television. He said that order must be preserved, that socialism was the only alternative for Czechoslovakia, and criticised protest groups. Government officials, especially the Head of the Communist Party Miloš Jakeš, kept their hard-line position. During the night, they had summoned 4,000 members of the &quot;People&#x27;s Militias&quot; (&quot;Lidové milice&quot;, a paramilitary organisation subordinated directly to the Communist Party) to Prague to crush the protests, but called them off.

===22 November===
Civic Forum announced a two-hour general strike for Monday, 27 November. The first live reports from the demonstration in Wenceslas Square appeared on Federal Television (and were quickly cut off, after one of the participants denounced the present government in favour of Alexander Dubček).

Striking students forced the representatives of the Slovak government and of the Communist Party of Slovakia to participate in a dialogue, in which the official representatives were immediately put on the defensive. Employees of the Slovak section of the Federal Television required the leaders of the Federal Television to provide true information on the events in the country; otherwise they would initiate a strike of TV employees. Uncensored live reports from demonstrations in Bratislava began.

===23 November===
The evening news showed factory workers heckling Miroslav Štěpán, the Prague Communist Secretary. The military informed the Communist leadership of its readiness to act (ultimately, it was never used against demonstrators). The military and the Ministry of Defense were preparing for actions against the opposition. Immediately after the meeting, however, the Minister of Defence delivered a TV address announcing that the army would never undertake action against the people and called for an end to demonstrations.

===24 November===
The entire Presidium, including General Secretary Miloš Jakeš, resigned, and Karel Urbánek, a more moderate Communist, was named General Secretary. Federal Television showed pictures from 17 November for the first time and presented the first television address of Václav Havel, dealing mostly with the planned general strike. Czechoslovak TV and Radio announced that they would join the general strike. A discussion with representatives of the opposition was broadcast by the Slovak section of Federal Television. The opposition was represented by Ján Budaj, Fedor Gál and Vladimír Ondruš, while the Communists were represented by Štefan Chudoba (director of Bratislava automotive company), Peter Weiss (secretary of the Institute of Marx-Leninism of the Communist party of Slovakia) and the director of Steelworks Košice. It was the first free discussion on Czechoslovak television since its inception. As a result, the editorial staff of Slovak newspapers started to join the opposition.

===25 November===
The new Communist leadership held a press conference, including Miroslav Štěpán while excluding Ladislav Adamec, but did not address the demands of the demonstrators. Later that day, Štěpán resigned as Prague Secretary. The number of participants in the regular anti-government demonstration in Prague-Letná reached an estimated 800,000 people. Demonstrations in Bratislava peaked at around 100,000 participants.

===26 November===
Prime Minister Adamec met with Havel for the first time. The editorial staff of Slovakia&#x27;s Pravda, the central newspaper of the Communist Party of Slovakia, joined the opposition.

===27 November===
A successful two-hour general strike led by the civic movements strengthened what were at first a set of moderate demands into cries for a new government. The strike took place throughout the country between 12:00 and 14:00, supported by a reported 75% of the population. The Ministry of Culture released anti-Communist literature for public checkouts in libraries, effectively ending decades of censorship. Civic Forum demonstrated its capacity to disrupt the political order and thereby establish itself as the legitimate voice of the nation in negotiations with the state. The civic movements mobilised support for the general strike.

===28 November===
The Federal Assembly deleted the provision in the constitution referring to the &quot;leading role&quot; of the Communist Party, officially ending Communist rule in Czechoslovakia.

===10 December===
President Gustáv Husák swore in the first government in 41 years that was not dominated by the Communist Party. He resigned shortly afterward.

== Aftermath ==
The victory of the revolution was topped off by the election of rebel playwright and human rights activist Václav Havel as President of Czechoslovakia on 29 December 1989. The event was highly choreographed and symbolically significant, including on account of with religious elements, as historian Martin Wein has analyzed in detail.

Within weeks, Havel negotiated the removal of all Soviet troops (approx. 73,500) from Czechoslovakia. As per the agreement, the Soviet troops departed within months. Free elections held in June 1990 legitimised this government and set the stage for addressing the remnants of the Communist party&#x27;s power and the legacy of the Communist period.

The main threat to political stability and the success of Czechoslovakia&#x27;s shift to democracy appeared likely to come from ethnic conflicts between the Czechs and the Slovaks, which resurfaced in the post-Communist period. However, there was a general consensus to move toward a market economy, so in early 1990, the President and his top economic advisers decided to liberalise prices, push de-monopolisation and privatise the economy. The end of Communism meant the end of life-long employment, and a subsequent increase in unemployment. To combat this, the government implemented unemployment benefits and a minimum wage. The outcome of the transition to democracy and a market economy would depend on the extent to which developments outside the country facilitated or hindered the process of change.
A notable development was an increase in freedom of religion, and renewed ties to the Vatican and Israel.

==Naming and categorisation==
The term &quot;Velvet Revolution&quot; was coined by Rita Klímová, the dissidents&#x27; English translator who later became the ambassador to the United States. The term was used internationally to describe the revolution, although the Czechs also used the term internally. After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, Slovakia used the term &quot;Gentle Revolution&quot;, the term that Slovaks used for the revolution from the beginning. The Czech Republic continues to refer to the event as the &quot;Velvet Revolution&quot;.

Theorists of revolutions, such as Jaroslav Krejčí, have argued that the &quot;Velvet Revolution&quot; was not, in fact, a true revolution because a revolution by definition accomplishes change by means of illegitimate violence. Contending theories of revolution argue that the Velvet Revolution is a legitimate revolution because it is a &quot;revolutionary situation&quot; of contested sovereignty that led to a transfer of power (&quot;revolutionary outcome&quot;).

The Velvet Revolution is an early example of &quot;colour revolutions&quot; around the world.

== Ideals of the revolution ==
In the months leading up to and during the revolution, citizens dispersed ideas using flyers distributed en masse. Hundreds of discrete flyers with varying messages were printed, but most shared the same ideals. In the summer of 1989, one of the most widely circulated documents was &quot;The Eight Rules of Dialogue&quot;, which advocated for truth, understanding and empathy, informed and respectful discussion, abstaining from ad hominem attacks, and an open mind. Other documents focused less on communication techniques and more on ideals. Democracy, freedom, nonviolence, fairness, and humanness were prevalent themes, as well as self-organisation, political representation, and improved working conditions.

== External factors ==
The events of November 1989 confirmed that outside factors were significant catalysts for the downfall of Communism in Czechoslovakia. Therefore, the transformations in Poland and Hungary and the collapse of the regime in East Germany, both of which could be traced to the new attitude of the Soviets toward East Europe, encouraged Czechs and Slovaks to take to the streets to win their freedom. However, national factors, including the economic and political crisis and the actions of groups and individuals working towards a transformation, destabilised support for the system.

Relations with the US and Israel began to change in early 1989, with ties warming up, and meetings and negotiations being held on various open issues. All sides involved had a strategic interest in an improvement of ties, and the treatment of Jews and the Jewish heritage and Holocaust memory was one of the litmus tests for the success of the overall rapprochement.

==Pace of change==
The State&#x27;s reaction to the strikes demonstrated that while global isolation produced pressures for political, social, and economic change, the events that followed could not be predetermined. Hardly anyone thought that the Communist State could collapse so quickly. Striking students and theatres did not seem likely to intimidate a state that was able to suppress any sort of demonstration. This &quot;popular&quot; phase of the revolution, was followed by victories made possible by the Civic Forum&#x27;s successful mobilisation for the general strike on 27 November, which established its legitimacy to speak for the nation in negotiations with the state. The mass demonstrations that followed 17 November led to the resignation of the Party leadership of Miloš Jakeš, the removal of the Party from its leading role and the creation of the non-Communist government. Supporters of the revolution had to take instant responsibility for running the government, in addition to establishing essential reforms in political organisation and values, economic structure and policies and foreign policy.

== Jingled keys ==
One element of the demonstrations of the Velvet Revolution was the jingling of keys to signify support. The practice had a double meaning – it symbolized the unlocking of doors and was the demonstrators&#x27; way of telling the Communists, &quot;Goodbye, it&#x27;s time to go home.&quot;

A commemorative 2 Euro coin was issued by Slovakia on 17 November 2009 to mark the 20th anniversary. The coin depicts a bell with a key adjoining the clapper. Ursula K. Le Guin wrote a short story, &quot;Unlocking the Air&quot;, in which the jingling of keys played a central role in the liberation of a fictional country called Orsinia.

<text>Jaime Luciano Balmes y Urpiá (; 28 August 18109 July 1848) was a Spanish philosopher, theologian, Catholic apologist, sociologist and political writer. Familiar with the doctrine of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Balmes was an original philosopher who did not belong to any particular school or stream, and was called by Pius XII the &quot;Prince of Modern Apologetics&quot;.

== Biography ==
Balmes was born at Vic, in the region of Catalonia in Spain and baptized the same day in the cathedral of that city with the name of Jaime Luciano Antonio. He died there as well.

In 1817, Balmes began his studies at the seminary in Vic: three years of Latin grammar, three of Rhetoric and, from 1822, three of Philosophy. In 1825, in Solsona, he received the tonsure from the Bishop of this city, Manuel Benito Tabernero.

From 1825 to 1826, Balmes studied courses of Theology, also in Vic Seminary. He studied four courses of Theology, thanks to a scholarship, in the College of San Carlos at the University of Cervera.

For two years in 1830, because of the closure of the University of Cervera, Balmes continued studying in Vic, on his own. On 8 June 1833 he received his degree in theology.

On 20 September 1834, in the chapel of the episcopal palace of Vic, Balmes was ordained a priest by bishop don Pablo de Jesús Corcuera. He continued his studies in theology and of Canons, again at the University of Cervera. Finally, in 1835, he received the title of Doctor of Theology and Bachelor of Canons.

Balmes then made several attempts to teach in an official way at the University of Barcelona and not get engaged for some time in Vic tutoring. Finally, the City Council appoints him, in 1837, Professor of Mathematics, a position that he held for four years. In 1839, his mother Teresa Urpiá, died. In 1841, he moved to Barcelona.

Then, Balmes began his creative activity and contributed to various newspapers and magazines: &quot;Peace&quot;, &quot;Catholic Madrid&quot;, &quot;Civilization&quot;; and several pamphlets that attract readers&#x27; attention.

From 1841, his creative genius &quot;exploded&quot; and he developed in a few highly active months his writings and his personality, that would be admired throughout Europe.

On 7 September 1844 he wrote and published &quot;The true idea of value, or thoughts on the origin, the nature and variations of the prices&quot; in which he solved the value paradox, clearly introducing the notion of marginal use, Balmes asked himself, &quot;Why a precious stone has a higher value than a piece of bread?&quot;

Having attacked the regent Espartero, he was exiled. On his return, he founded and edited &quot;El Pensamiento de la Nación&quot;, a Catholic and conservative weekly; however, his fame rests principally on &quot;El Protestantismo comparado con el Catolicismo en sus relaciones con la Civilización Europea&quot; (Protestantism and Catholicity compared in their Effects on the Civilization of Europe), an able defence of Catholicism on the ground that it represents the spirit of obedience or order, as opposed to Protestantism, the spirit of revolt or anarchy. The book is often cited as a counter argument to historical accounts that focus on the reputed central role of the Protestant thought to the development of modern society.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition:
:The best of his philosophical works, which are clear expositions of the scholastic system of thought, are the &quot;Filosofia Fundamental&quot; (Basic Philosophy), and the &quot;Curso de Filosofia Elemental&quot; (A Course of Elementary Philosophy), which he translated into Latin for use in seminaries.

Balmes argued in favor of monarchy.

He died from tuberculosis in Vic in 1848.

== Thought ==

Generally the philosophy of Balmes is understood merely as &quot;philosophy of common sense&quot;, when in reality it is something much more complex. Both in &quot; Fundamental Philosophy &quot; and in &quot; Elementary Philosophy &quot; (being this second work more informative) is the subject of certainty.

Balmes divides the truth into three irreducible classes, although we speak of it as if it were only one. These are the subjective truths, the rational truths and the objective truths. The first type of truth, the subjective one, can be understood as a present reality for the subject, which is real but depends on the perception of the speaker. For example, affirming that one is cold or that one is thirsty are subjective truths. The second type, the rational one, is logical and mathematical truth, using any operation of this type as an example. Finally, the objective truth is understood as that which, although perceived by all, does not fall within the category of rational truth: to affirm that the sky is blue, or that there are trees in the forest.

The three types of truth are irreducible, and the methods of recruitment differ from one to the other. Therefore, it is necessary that the philosophy first of all consider what kind of truth we are looking for.

For Balmes there is no possibility of doubting everything: making such statement, we forget that there are a series of rules of thought that we admit as truths in order to be able to doubt. In a similar way to that posed by St Augustine or Descartes, to affirm that we doubt necessarily implies the certainty that we are doubting. In this way, doubt is also a certainty. An authentic radical skeptic is impossible, because there is no universal doubt.

Certainty is natural and intuitive like doubt, and prior to philosophy. Thus, the common and natural certainty also encompasses the Cartesian philosophical certainty. To reach this certainty, the so-called &quot;criteria&quot; are necessary, the means by which we can access the truth. There are a lot of criteria for having, also, several types of truths. However, Balmes prefers to distribute them in three: the criteria of conscience, those of evidence and those of common sense. These are the criteria for accessing the three types of truth. To define the corpus of Balmes&#x27;s thought as &quot;philosophy of common sense&quot; is not so much due to his conception of common sense as inherent in philosophical work, but especially because of his definition of this sense as a criterion for reaching a certainty. At this point, it is worth noting the relationship of subjective truths with criteria of conscience, rational truths with those of evidence and finally, objective truths accessible through the criterion of so-called &quot;common sense&quot;.

Therefore, Balmes argues that metaphysics should not be sustained only on one column, but on three that correspond to the three truths: thus, the principle of Cartesian consciousness, the &quot; cogito ergo sum &quot; is a truth subjective, while the principle of non-contradiction Aristotelian is truly rational. Finally, common sense, the intellectual instinct (perhaps it is &quot;intellectual instinct&quot; a more specific term than &quot;common sense&quot;) presents the so-called objective truth. It is impossible to find a truth common to the three principles.

In this way, Balmes denies the exclusivity of the theories of philosophers: philosophy is the fullness of natural knowledge, and is rooted in being a man. To affirm, for example, that the &quot;cogito&quot; is the foundation of truth and philosophy is not in itself a wrong assertion, because it is true what it affirms, but false what it denies, because besides the &quot;cogito&quot; There are other possibilities of foundation. Balmes does not reduce this idea only to the field of philosophy, and extends it also to general human thought.

In this way, the fundamental thesis of Balmes is that there is no formula from which the universe can be detached. There is no truth from which all others arise. At this point, the three criteria can be defined more thoroughly.

=== Consciousness ===
Consciousness is what you notice on the inside, what you think and experience. Sensations would be useless if they were not experienced in consciousness. This criterion has several characteristics: the first is the subjective nature of consciousness, that is, our perception is that of the phenomenon, not that of reality, although for Balmes, subjectivity does not imply that the certainty achieved is not true. It also has the function of pointing or presenting. Consciousness does not put us in contact with external reality, nor with others (we can not perceive – yes suppose – the existence of consciousness in others), but it presents facts, it is an absolute that dispenses with relationships. Consciousness has no objectivity or light, it is pure presence.

When the language expresses the conscience, it betrays it, because something personal can not be expressed through something universal. Language is incapable of expressing pure consciousness, something that art can do, for example. Likewise, consciousness can not be wrong either, because we are not mistaken about the experience of it, although it can be fallible when it leaves its ground to go outside. There is no error in the internal phenomenon, but perhaps in its correspondence with the outside. Balmes, against the Cartesian animaina machina, defends that the animals also have conscience, but in his case it is reduced to the sensation, and not to the intellectualization of it. Thus, they possess only a direct consciousness, while humans -for our intellective capacity- also possess reflex consciousness, which is the capacity to reflect on the sensations of direct consciousness.

For Balmes, consciousness is the foundation of the other criteria, and all are necessarily born of it.

=== Evidence ===
Unlike consciousness, the evidence is not singular and contingent. The evidence has universality and a logical necessity. Balmes divides between two types of evidence, the immediate and the mediate: the first does not require proof, it is a priori knowledge, such as knowing that every object is equal to itself. On the other hand, mediate evidence requires demonstration.

The evidence does not capture a fact, but captures its relationships. It is captured that the idea of the predicate is in the subject (similar to the analytical judgment of Kant). All evidence is based on the principle of non-contradiction, and is reduced to the analytical. Forget the synthetic judgments that are not exclusively rational, do not consider that the criterion of evidence is accompanied by the senses. Therefore, for Balmes, the analysis of consciousness is better than the analysis of evidence.

=== Intellectual instinct ===
The intellectual instinct gives us the correspondence between the idea and reality, it is not an animal instinct, but a rational instinct. Through this instinct we know that what we see exists, or at least that there is a representation of what we see. These kinds of truths are by definition broader than the intellectual truths of the evidence. The same truth can also be had by means of an intellectual rather than an instinct: to give an example, it can be known whether a business works or not through an economic study or through an intuition of common sense. Thus, in the common sense, there is the unconscious -like the moral truths, or the sensations- or that which through the intellectual instinct we see as evident, for example, the scientific truths. It is also through this instinct that we know demonstrable truths without having to prove them, or we consider truth as probability, that is, the awareness of contingency: to give an example, to be aware of the possibilities we have to win the lottery, or to achieve write something coherent by moving the pen randomly on the paper.

For Balmes, these are the three pillars of metaphysics. To better define this, there is an analysis of the &quot; cogito ergo sum &quot; Cartesian, according to which the affirmation of the &quot;I think, therefore I exist&quot; Cartesian is in principle a truth of conscience, later transformed into an intellectual truth of evidence, a logical syllogism whose reality is understood through intuition. Having founded the &quot; cogito &quot; on something intellectual, Descartes falls into the risk of reducing the &quot; cogito &quot; to something logical and intellectual. For this reason, for Balmes, consciousness is the fundamental pillar of metaphysics, but for him transcends the &quot;cogito&quot; the clear and distinct Cartesian idea: consciousness is the pillar because it is where experience is lived and given sense.

<text>In computer architecture, 64-bit integers, memory addresses, or other data units are those that are 64 bits wide. Also, 64-bit central processing units (CPU) and arithmetic logic units (ALU) are those that are based on processor registers, address buses, or data buses of that size. A computer that uses such a processor is a 64-bit computer.

From the software perspective, 64-bit computing means the use of machine code with 64-bit virtual memory addresses. However, not all 64-bit instruction sets support full 64-bit virtual memory addresses; x86-64 and AArch64 for example, support only 48 bits of virtual address, with the remaining 16 bits of the virtual address required to be all zeros (000...) or all ones (111...), and several 64-bit instruction sets support fewer than 64 bits of physical memory address.

The term &quot;64-bit&quot; also describes a generation of computers in which 64-bit processors are the norm. 64 bits is a word size that defines certain classes of computer architecture, buses, memory, and CPUs and, by extension, the software that runs on them. 64-bit CPUs have been used in supercomputers since the 1970s (Cray-1, 1975) and in reduced instruction set computers (RISC) based workstations and servers since the early 1990s. In 2003, 64-bit CPUs were introduced to the mainstream PC market in the form of x86-64 processors and the PowerPC G5.

A 64-bit register can hold any of 264 (over 18 quintillion or 1.8×1019) different values. The range of integer values that can be stored in 64 bits depends on the integer representation used. With the two most common representations, the range is 0 through 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (equal to 264 − 1) for representation as an (unsigned) binary number, and −9,223,372,036,854,775,808 (−263) through 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (263 − 1) for representation as two&#x27;s complement. Hence, a processor with 64-bit memory addresses can directly access 264 bytes (16 exabytes or EB) of byte-addressable memory.

With no further qualification, a &quot;64-bit computer architecture&quot; generally has integer and addressing registers that are 64 bits wide, allowing direct support for 64-bit data types and addresses. However, a CPU might have external data buses or address buses with different sizes from the registers, even larger (the 32-bit Pentium had a 64-bit data bus, for instance).7003

== Architectural implications ==

Processor registers are typically divided into several groups: &quot;integer&quot;, &quot;floating-point&quot;, &quot;single instruction, multiple data&quot; (SIMD), &quot;control&quot;, and often special registers for address arithmetic which may have various uses and names such as &quot;address&quot;, &quot;index&quot;, or &quot;base registers&quot;. However, in modern designs, these functions are often performed by more general purpose &quot;integer&quot; registers. In most processors, only integer or address-registers can be used to address data in memory; the other types of registers cannot. The size of these registers therefore normally limits the amount of directly addressable memory, even if there are registers, such as floating-point registers, that are wider.

Most high performance 32-bit and 64-bit processors (some notable exceptions are older or embedded ARM architecture (ARM) and 32-bit MIPS architecture (MIPS) CPUs) have integrated floating point hardware, which is often, but not always, based on 64-bit units of data. For example, although the x86/x87 architecture has instructions able to load and store 64-bit (and 32-bit) floating-point values in memory, the internal floating-point data and register format is 80 bits wide, while the general-purpose registers are 32 bits wide. In contrast, the 64-bit Alpha family uses a 64-bit floating-point data and register format, and 64-bit integer registers.

== History ==
Many computer instruction sets are designed so that a single integer register can store the memory address to any location in the computer&#x27;s physical or virtual memory. Therefore, the total number of addresses to memory is often determined by the width of these registers. The IBM System/360 of the 1960s was an early 32-bit computer; it had 32-bit integer registers, although it only used the low order 24 bits of a word for addresses, resulting in a 16 MiB () address space. 32-bit superminicomputers, such as the DEC VAX, became common in the 1970s, and 32-bit microprocessors, such as the Motorola 68000 family and the 32-bit members of the x86 family starting with the Intel 80386, appeared in the mid-1980s, making 32 bits something of a &quot;de facto&quot; consensus as a convenient register size.

A 32-bit address register meant that 232 addresses, or 4 GB of random-access memory (RAM), could be referenced. When these architectures were devised, 4 GB of memory was so far beyond the typical amounts (4 MiB) in installations, that this was considered to be enough &quot;headroom&quot; for addressing. 4.29 billion addresses were considered an appropriate size to work with for another important reason: 4.29 billion integers are enough to assign unique references to most entities in applications like databases.

Some supercomputer architectures of the 1970s and 1980s, such as the Cray-1, used registers up to 64 bits wide, and supported 64-bit integer arithmetic, although they did not support 64-bit addressing. In the mid-1980s, Intel i860 development began culminating in a 1989 release; the i860 had 32-bit integer registers and 32-bit addressing, so it was not a fully 64-bit processor, although its graphics unit supported 64-bit integer arithmetic. However, 32 bits remained the norm until the early 1990s, when the continual reductions in the cost of memory led to installations with amounts of RAM approaching 4 GB, and the use of virtual memory spaces exceeding the 4 GB ceiling became desirable for handling certain types of problems. In response, MIPS and DEC developed 64-bit microprocessor architectures, initially for high-end workstation and server machines. By the mid-1990s, HAL Computer Systems, Sun Microsystems, IBM, Silicon Graphics, and Hewlett-Packard had developed 64-bit architectures for their workstation and server systems. A notable exception to this trend were mainframes from IBM, which then used 32-bit data and 31-bit address sizes; the IBM mainframes did not include 64-bit processors until 2000. During the 1990s, several low-cost 64-bit microprocessors were used in consumer electronics and embedded applications. Notably, the Nintendo 64 and the PlayStation 2 had 64-bit microprocessors before their introduction in personal computers. High-end printers, network equipment, and industrial computers also used 64-bit microprocessors, such as the Quantum Effect Devices R5000. 64-bit computing started to trickle down to the personal computer desktop from 2003 onward, when some models in Apple&#x27;s Macintosh lines switched to PowerPC 970 processors (termed &quot;G5&quot; by Apple), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) released its first 64-bit x86-64 processor. Physical memory eventually caught up with 32 bit limits. In 2023, laptop computers were commonly equipped with 16GB and servers starting from 64 GB of memory, greatly exceeding the 4 GB address capacity of 32 bits.

== Limits of processors ==
In principle, a 64-bit microprocessor can address 16 EB () of memory. However, not all instruction sets, and not all processors implementing those instruction sets, support a full 64-bit virtual or physical address space.

The x86-64 architecture () allows 48 bits for virtual memory and, for any given processor, up to 52 bits for physical memory. These limits allow memory sizes of 256 TB () and 4 PB (), respectively. A PC cannot currently contain 4 petabytes of memory (due to the physical size of the memory chips), but AMD envisioned large servers, shared memory clusters, and other uses of physical address space that might approach this in the foreseeable future. Thus the 52-bit physical address provides ample room for expansion while not incurring the cost of implementing full 64-bit physical addresses. Similarly, the 48-bit virtual address space was designed to provide 65,536 (216) times the 32-bit limit of 4 GB (), allowing room for later expansion and incurring no overhead of translating full 64-bit addresses.

The Power ISA v3.0 allows 64 bits for an effective address, mapped to a segmented address with between 65 and 78 bits allowed, for virtual memory, and, for any given processor, up to 60 bits for physical memory.

The Oracle SPARC Architecture 2015 allows 64 bits for virtual memory and, for any given processor, between 40 and 56 bits for physical memory.

The ARM AArch64 Virtual Memory System Architecture allows from 48 to 56 bits for virtual memory and, for any given processor, from 32 to 56 bits for physical memory.

The DEC Alpha specification requires minimum of 43 bits of virtual memory address space (8 TB) to be supported, and hardware need to check and trap if the remaining unsupported bits are zero (to support compatibility on future processors). Alpha 21064 supported 43 bits of virtual memory address space (8 TB) and 34 bits of physical memory address space (16 GB). Alpha 21164 supported 43 bits of virtual memory address space (8 TB) and 40 bits of physical memory address space (1 TB). Alpha 21264 supported user-configurable 43 or 48 bits of virtual memory address space (8 TB or 256 TB) and 44 bits of physical memory address space (16 TB).

== 64-bit applications ==
=== 32-bit vs 64-bit ===
A change from a 32-bit to a 64-bit architecture is a fundamental alteration, as most operating systems must be extensively modified to take advantage of the new architecture, because that software has to manage the actual memory addressing hardware. Other software must also be ported to use the new abilities; older 32-bit software may be supported either by virtue of the 64-bit instruction set being a superset of the 32-bit instruction set, so that processors that support the 64-bit instruction set can also run code for the 32-bit instruction set, or through software emulation, or by the actual implementation of a 32-bit processor core within the 64-bit processor, as with some Itanium processors from Intel, which included an IA-32 processor core to run 32-bit x86 applications. The operating systems for those 64-bit architectures generally support both 32-bit and 64-bit applications.

One significant exception to this is the IBM AS/400, software for which is compiled into a virtual instruction set architecture (ISA) called &quot;Technology Independent Machine Interface&quot; (TIMI); TIMI code is then translated to native machine code by low-level software before being executed. The translation software is all that must be rewritten to move the full OS and all software to a new platform, as when IBM transitioned the native instruction set for AS/400 from the older 32/48-bit &quot;IMPI&quot; to the newer 64-bit &quot;PowerPC-AS&quot;, codenamed &quot;Amazon&quot;. The IMPI instruction set was quite different from even 32-bit PowerPC, so this transition was even bigger than moving a given instruction set from 32 to 64 bits.

On 64-bit hardware with x86-64 architecture (AMD64), most 32-bit operating systems and applications can run with no compatibility issues. While the larger address space of 64-bit architectures makes working with large data sets in applications such as digital video, scientific computing, and large databases easier, there has been considerable debate on whether they or their 32-bit compatibility modes will be faster than comparably priced 32-bit systems for other tasks.

A compiled Java program can run on a 32- or 64-bit Java virtual machine with no modification. The lengths and precision of all the built-in types, such as codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, codice_5, and codice_6, and the types that can be used as array indices, are specified by the standard and are not dependent on the underlying architecture. Java programs that run on a 64-bit Java virtual machine have access to a larger address space.

Speed is not the only factor to consider in comparing 32-bit and 64-bit processors. Applications such as multi-tasking, stress testing, and clustering – for high-performance computing (HPC) – may be more suited to a 64-bit architecture when deployed appropriately. For this reason, 64-bit clusters have been widely deployed in large organizations, such as IBM, HP, and Microsoft.

Summary:

*A 64-bit processor performs best with 64-bit software.
*A 64-bit processor may have backward compatibility, allowing it to run 32-bit application software for the 32-bit version of its instruction set, and may also support running 32-bit operating systems for the 32-bit version of its instruction set.
*A 32-bit processor is incompatible with 64-bit software.

=== Pros and cons ===
A common misconception is that 64-bit architectures are no better than 32-bit architectures unless the computer has more than 4 GB of random-access memory. This is not entirely true:

* Some operating systems and certain hardware configurations limit the physical memory space to 3 GB on IA-32 systems, due to much of the 3–4 GB region being reserved for hardware addressing; see 3 GB barrier; 64-bit architectures can address far more than 4 GB. However, IA-32 processors from the Pentium Pro onward allow a 36-bit &quot;physical&quot; memory address space, using Physical Address Extension (PAE), which gives a 64 GB physical address range, of which up to 62 GB may be used by main memory; operating systems that support PAE may not be limited to 4 GB of physical memory, even on IA-32 processors. However, drivers and other kernel mode software, more so older versions, may be incompatible with PAE; this has been cited as the reason for 32-bit versions of Microsoft Windows being limited to 4 GB of physical RAM (although the validity of this explanation has been disputed).
* Some operating systems reserve portions of process address space for OS use, effectively reducing the total address space available for mapping memory for user programs. For instance, 32-bit Windows reserves 1 or 2 GB (depending on the settings) of the total address space for the kernel, which leaves only 3 or 2 GB (respectively) of the address space available for user mode. This limit is much higher on 64-bit operating systems.
* Memory-mapped files are becoming more difficult to implement in 32-bit architectures as files of over 4 GB become more common; such large files cannot be memory-mapped easily to 32-bit architectures, as only part of the file can be mapped into the address space at a time, and to access such a file by memory mapping, the parts mapped must be swapped into and out of the address space as needed. This is a problem, as memory mapping, if properly implemented by the OS, is one of the most efficient disk-to-memory methods.
* Some 64-bit programs, such as encoders, decoders and encryption software, can benefit greatly from 64-bit registers, while the performance of other programs, such as 3D graphics-oriented ones, remains unaffected when switching from a 32-bit to a 64-bit environment.
* Some 64-bit architectures, such as x86-64 and AArch64, support more general-purpose registers than their 32-bit counterparts (although this is not due specifically to the word length). This leads to a significant speed increase for tight loops since the processor does not have to fetch data from the cache or main memory if the data can fit in the available registers.
:Example in C:

int a, b, c, d, e;
for (a = 0; a &lt; 100; a++) {
 b = a;
 c = b;
 d = c;
 e = d;

: This code first creates 5 values: a, b, c, d and e; and then puts them in a loop. During the loop, this code changes the value of b to the value of a, the value of c to the value of b, the value of d to the value of c and the value of e to the value of d. This has the same effect as changing all the values to a.
:If a processor can keep only two or three values or variables in registers, it would need to move some values between memory and registers to be able to process variables d and e also; this is a process that takes many CPU cycles. A processor that can hold all values and variables in registers can loop through them with no need to move data between registers and memory for each iteration. This behavior can easily be compared with virtual memory, although any effects are contingent on the compiler.

The main disadvantage of 64-bit architectures is that, relative to 32-bit architectures, the same data occupies more space in memory (due to longer pointers and possibly other types, and alignment padding). This increases the memory requirements of a given process and can have implications for efficient processor cache use. Maintaining a partial 32-bit model is one way to handle this, and is in general reasonably effective. For example, the z/OS operating system takes this approach, requiring program code to reside in 31-bit address spaces (the high order bit is not used in address calculation on the underlying hardware platform) while data objects can optionally reside in 64-bit regions. Not all such applications require a large address space or manipulate 64-bit data items, so these applications do not benefit from these features.

=== Software availability ===
x86-based 64-bit systems sometimes lack equivalents of software that is written for 32-bit architectures. The most severe problem in Microsoft Windows is incompatible device drivers for obsolete hardware. Most 32-bit application software can run on a 64-bit operating system in a compatibility mode, also termed an emulation mode, e.g., Microsoft WoW64 Technology for IA-64 and AMD64. The 64-bit Windows Native Mode driver environment runs atop 64-bit , which cannot call 32-bit Win32 subsystem code (often devices whose actual hardware function is emulated in user mode software, like Winprinters). Because 64-bit drivers for most devices were unavailable until early 2007 (Vista x64), using a 64-bit version of Windows was considered a challenge. However, the trend has since moved toward 64-bit computing, more so as memory prices dropped and the use of more than 4 GB of RAM increased. Most manufacturers started to provide both 32-bit and 64-bit drivers for new devices, so unavailability of 64-bit drivers ceased to be a problem. 64-bit drivers were not provided for many older devices, which could consequently not be used in 64-bit systems.

Driver compatibility was less of a problem with open-source drivers, as 32-bit ones could be modified for 64-bit use. Support for hardware made before early 2007, was problematic for open-source platforms, due to the relatively small number of users.

64-bit versions of Windows cannot run 16-bit software. However, most 32-bit applications will work well. 64-bit users are forced to install a virtual machine of a 16- or 32-bit operating system to run 16-bit applications or use one of the alternatives for NTVDM.

Mac OS X 10.4 &quot;Tiger&quot; and Mac OS X 10.5 &quot;Leopard&quot; had only a 32-bit kernel, but they can run 64-bit user-mode code on 64-bit processors. Mac OS X 10.6 &quot;Snow Leopard&quot; had both 32- and 64-bit kernels, and, on most Macs, used the 32-bit kernel even on 64-bit processors. This allowed those Macs to support 64-bit processes while still supporting 32-bit device drivers; although not 64-bit drivers and performance advantages that can come with them. Mac OS X 10.7 &quot;Lion&quot; ran with a 64-bit kernel on more Macs, and OS X 10.8 &quot;Mountain Lion&quot; and later macOS releases only have a 64-bit kernel. On systems with 64-bit processors, both the 32- and 64-bit macOS kernels can run 32-bit user-mode code, and all versions of macOS up to macOS Mojave (10.14) include 32-bit versions of libraries that 32-bit applications would use, so 32-bit user-mode software for macOS will run on those systems. The 32-bit versions of libraries have been removed by Apple in macOS Catalina (10.15).

Linux and most other Unix-like operating systems, and the C and C++ toolchains for them, have supported 64-bit processors for many years. Many applications and libraries for those platforms are open-source software, written in C and C++, so that if they are 64-bit-safe, they can be compiled into 64-bit versions. This source-based distribution model, with an emphasis on frequent releases, makes availability of application software for those operating systems less of an issue.

== 64-bit data models ==
In 32-bit programs, pointers and data types such as integers generally have the same length. This is not necessarily true on 64-bit machines. Mixing data types in programming languages such as C and its descendants such as C++ and Objective-C may thus work on 32-bit implementations but not on 64-bit implementations.

In many programming environments for C and C-derived languages on 64-bit machines, codice_3 variables are still 32 bits wide, but long integers and pointers are 64 bits wide. These are described as having an &quot;LP64&quot; data model, which is an abbreviation of &quot;Long, Pointer, 64&quot;. Other models are the &quot;ILP64&quot; data model in which all three data types are 64 bits wide, and even the &quot;SILP64&quot; model where &quot;short&quot; integers are also 64 bits wide. However, in most cases the modifications required are relatively minor and straightforward, and many well-written programs can simply be recompiled for the new environment with no changes. Another alternative is the &quot;LLP64&quot; model, which maintains compatibility with 32-bit code by leaving both codice_3 and codice_4 as 32-bit. &quot;LL&quot; refers to the &quot;long long integer&quot; type, which is at least 64 bits on all platforms, including 32-bit environments.

There are also systems with 64-bit processors using an &quot;ILP32&quot; data model, with the addition of 64-bit long long integers; this is also used on many platforms with 32-bit processors. This model reduces code size and the size of data structures containing pointers, at the cost of a much smaller address space, a good choice for some embedded systems. For instruction sets such as x86 and ARM in which the 64-bit version of the instruction set has more registers than does the 32-bit version, it provides access to the additional registers without the space penalty. It is common in 64-bit RISC machines, explored in x86 as x32 ABI, and has recently been used in the Apple Watch Series 4 and 5.

Many 64-bit platforms today use an &quot;LP64&quot; model (including Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, Linux, macOS, BSD, and IBM z/OS). Microsoft Windows uses an &quot;LLP64&quot; model. The disadvantage of the LP64 model is that storing a codice_4 into an codice_3 truncates. On the other hand, converting a pointer to a codice_4 will &quot;work&quot; in LP64. In the LLP64 model, the reverse is true. These are not problems which affect fully standard-compliant code, but code is often written with implicit assumptions about the widths of data types. C code should prefer (codice_13)codice_14 instead of codice_4 when casting pointers into integer objects.

A programming model is a choice made to suit a given compiler, and several can coexist on the same OS. However, the programming model chosen as the primary model for the OS application programming interface (API) typically dominates.

Another consideration is the data model used for device drivers. Drivers make up the majority of the operating system code in most modern operating systems (although many may not be loaded when the operating system is running). Many drivers use pointers heavily to manipulate data, and in some cases have to load pointers of a certain size into the hardware they support for direct memory access (DMA). As an example, a driver for a 32-bit PCI device asking the device to DMA data into upper areas of a 64-bit machine&#x27;s memory could not satisfy requests from the operating system to load data from the device to memory above the 4 gigabyte barrier, because the pointers for those addresses would not fit into the DMA registers of the device. This problem is solved by having the OS take the memory restrictions of the device into account when generating requests to drivers for DMA, or by using an input–output memory management unit (IOMMU).

<text>Henry Balnaves (1512? – February 1570) was a Scottish politician, Lord Justice Clerk, and religious reformer.

==Biography==
Born in Kirkcaldy, Fife, around 1512, he was educated at the University of St Andrews and on the continent, where he adopted Protestant views. Returning to Scotland, he continued his legal studies and in 1538 was appointed a lord of session and Senator of the College of Justice.

He married Christian Scheves and in 1539 was granted the estate of Hall Hill in Fife, after which he is generally named. Before 1540 he was sworn of James V of Scotland&#x27;s privy council, and was known as one of the party in favour of the English alliance and of an ecclesiastical reformation. He is also described as treasurer to James. In January 1543, Regent Arran appointed him secretary in the new government of the infant Queen Mary (January 1543).

He promoted the act permitting the reading of the Scriptures in the vulgar tongue, and was one of the commissioners appointed to arrange a marriage treaty between the little queen and the future Edward VI. In London he was not considered so complaisant as some of the other commissioners, and was not made privy to all the engagements taken by his colleagues. However, David Beaton &quot;loved him worst of all,&quot; and when Arran went over to the priestly party, Balnaves was deprived of his offices and imprisoned in Blackness Castle in November 1543.

He was released by the arrival of Hertford&#x27;s fleet in the following May, and from this time he became a paid agent of the English cause in Scotland, receiving an annuity. He took no part in the murder of Cardinal Beaton at St Andrews Castle, but was one of the most active defenders of the castle during the subsequent siege and was English paymaster of the garrison. In support of Henry VIII&#x27;s Rough Wooing, he drafted the form of an assurance bond for Scots to support the marriage of Prince Edward and Mary. When that castle surrendered to the French in July, Balnaves was taken prisoner to Rouen.

Somerset made vain efforts to procure his release and continued his pension. He made himself useful by giving information to the English government, and even Mary Tudor sent him a reward in June 1554. Balnaves also busied himself in writing what Knox calls &quot;a comfortable treatise of justification,&quot; which was found in manuscript at the house of John Cockburn of Ormiston by Knox&#x27;s secretary Richard Bannatyne and published at Edinburgh in 1584 under the title &quot;The Confession of Faith&quot;.

In August 1555, Balnaves wrote to Mary of Guise from Paris. She had become Regent of Scotland, and Balnaves offered to support her regime with secret legal advice regarding crown incomes. He expressed confidence in her rule and mentioned she had shown kindness to his wife, Christina Scheves;&quot;Your Heighnes&#x27; maist gentill and gracious clemencie schawin to me, undeservit, and to the pure woman my wiff, quha hes no other help bot your grace, and the hope I have in your heighness, compellis me seik and preis forward to your grace&#x27; service, and to pretermit (&quot;avoid&quot;) na thyng, when occasion is gevin to me, that I can do to your contentation and pleasour.&quot;

In February 1557 Balnaves was permitted to return to Scotland and regain his property; probably it was thought that Queen Mary&#x27;s burnings would have cooled the ardour of his English affections, and that in the war threatening between two Catholic countries, Balnaves would serve his own.

The accession of Queen Elizabeth I changed the situation, and Mary of Guise had reasons for accusing him of &quot;practices out of England&quot;. He took, in fact, an active part in the rising of 1559 and was commissioned by the Congregation to solicit the help of the English government through Sir Ralph Sadleir at Berwick. Balnaves was surprised to meet the young Earl of Arran there. He arrived and left secretly by sea from Holy Island. Elizabeth wrote to thank Sir Ralph Sadler and Sir James Croft, Captain of Berwick, personally for their good and diligent service in meeting Balnaves.

He was also selected one of the Scots representatives to negotiate with the Duke of Norfolk in February 1560, arranging the Treaty of Berwick. Balnaves&#x27;s rehabilitation by letter of Mary, Queen of Scots, in May 1562. In 1563 he was restored to his office as lord of session, and was one of those appointed by the General Assembly to revise the &quot;Book of Discipline&quot;. He was one of Bothwell&#x27;s judges for the murder of Darnley in 1567, and in 1568 he accompanied Moray to the York inquiry into Queen Mary&#x27;s guilt.

Balnaves died in 1570 at Leith. He has been claimed as a Scots bard on the strength of one ballad, &quot;O gallandis all, I cry and call,&quot; which is printed in Allan Ramsay&#x27;s &quot;Evergreen&quot; (2 vols. 1724–1727). His position as Senator of the College of Justice was filled by Thomas McCalzean (Lord Cliftonhall).

<text>Hugh de Balsham (or Hugo; died 16 June 1286) was a medieval English bishop.

==Life==
Nothing is known of Balsham&#x27;s background, although during the dispute over his election he was alleged to have been of servile birth, and his name suggests a connection with the Cambridgeshire village of Balsham. He was a Benedictine monk at Ely, and appears first as sub-prior of the cathedral chapter there. On the death of William of Kilkenny in 1256 the monks elected him Bishop of Ely, to the annoyance of King Henry III of England and Boniface of Savoy, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Boniface declared the election invalid, and attempted to install Adam Marsh in the see. Both sides appealed to Rome. The election was confirmed by Pope Alexander IV in 1257.

Balsham was consecrated on 14 October 1257 by the pope. Balsham also promised that he would visit Rome every three years, but he was released from this promise in 1278.

Balsham legislated against the sale of the sacraments. He was present at the Parliament held at London in June 1264 that set up the government of Simon de Montfort. Much of Balsham&#x27;s time was spent in repairing damage done to his diocese by various people, first the royal administrators during the election dispute, and then later some of the baronial supporters who occupied the Isle of Ely in 1265. The bishop issued statues for his diocese, and worked to improve the administration of the diocese. He promoted the cult of Ethelreda, the local saint of Ely. Gifts to the monks of the cathedral chapter as well as to churches in his diocese contributed to his reputation as a good bishop.

Balsham played an important role in the early history of Cambridge University. In 1280, he obtained a charter from the king allowing him to replace the secular brethren residing in the diocesan hospital of St John at Cambridge by &quot;studious scholars&quot;; a second charter four years later entirely differentiated these scholars from the brethren of the hospital, and for them Balsham founded and endowed the college of Peterhouse, the first Cambridge college. He left 200 pounds to the college in his will.

Balsham died on 16 June 1286 at the manor of Doddington on the Isle of Ely. He was buried in Ely Cathedral on 24 June 1286. A monumental brass in the church at Balsham, Cambridgeshire, supposedly depicts the bishop. An unidentified tomb slab now in Ely Cathedral has sometimes been identified as his, but this identification is not secure.

Near the end of the war, Congress charged Deane with financial impropriety, and the British intercepted and published some letters in which he had implied that the American cause was hopeless. After the war, Deane lived in Ghent and London and died under mysterious circumstances while attempting to return to America.

==Early life and family==
Deane was born on in Groton, Connecticut, to blacksmith Silas Deane and his wife Hannah Barker. The younger Silas was able to obtain a full scholarship to Yale and graduated in 1758. In April 1759, he was hired to tutor a young Edward Bancroft in Hartford, Connecticut. In 1761, Deane was admitted to the bar and practiced law for a short time outside of Hartford before moving to Wethersfield, Connecticut, and establishing a thriving business as a merchant. 
Deane married twice, both times to wealthy widows from Wethersfield. In 1763, he married Mehitable (Nott) Webb after assisting her with the settlement of her first husband&#x27;s estate. They had one son, Jesse, born in 1764. Mehitable died in 1767. In 1770, Deane married Elizabeth (Saltonstall) Evards, granddaughter of Connecticut Governor Gurdon Saltonstall of the Massachusetts Saltonstall family. Elizabeth died in 1777 while Silas was in France. Both Mehitable and Elizabeth were buried in the Old Wethersfield Village Cemetery.
==Continental Congress==
In 1768, Deane was elected to the Connecticut House of Representatives; in 1769, he was appointed to the Wethersfield Committee of Correspondence; and from 1774 to 1776, he served as a delegate from Connecticut to the Continental Congress.

While a member of Congress, Deane used his influence to obtain a commission in the Continental Army for his stepson Samuel B. Webb, who had accompanied him to Philadelphia. Deane excelled in the committee work of Congress, helping to coordinate the attack on Fort Ticonderoga and to establish the United States Navy.

A dispute arose between Deane and fellow Connecticut delegate Roger Sherman over the appointment of Israel Putnam as a major general under George Washington&#x27;s command. This dispute led the Connecticut legislature to replace Deane as a delegate to Congress; but instead of returning to Connecticut, Deane remained in Philadelphia to assist Congress.

==France==

On March 2, 1776, Congress appointed Deane as a secret envoy to France with the mission of inducing the French government to grant financial aid to the colonies. He began negotiating with French Foreign Minister Comte de Vergennes as soon as he arrived in Paris. Deane organized the shipment of arms and munitions to the colonies with the assistance of Pierre Beaumarchais, the playwright and outspoken supporter of American independence. Deane also tacitly approved the plot of Scotsman James Aitken (John the Painter) to destroy Royal Navy stores and dockyards in Portsmouth and Plymouth, England, on behalf of the Continental cause.

Deane&#x27;s position was officially recognized after Benjamin Franklin and Arthur Lee arrived in Paris in December 1776, with orders from Congress appointing the trio as the diplomatic delegation to France. Deane recruited the services of several foreign soldiers to the cause, including Marquis de Lafayette, Baron Johann de Kalb, Thomas Conway, Casimir Pulaski, and Baron von Steuben. For a variety of reasons, many of the foreign officers were unpopular in America, and many in Congress blamed Deane for their behavior, leading them to recall him on December 8, 1777.

On February 6, 1778, Deane and the other commissioners signed the Treaties of Amity and Commerce and of Alliance, officially creating the alliance between France and the American colonies.

==Accusations in Congress==
On March 4, 1778, Deane received a letter from James Lovell containing the recall order from Congress. Lovell only mentioned giving a report to Congress about European affairs, and Deane fully expected to be sent back to Paris within a few months. France sent Deane back home aboard a warship. Louis XVI also presented Deane with a portrait framed with diamonds, and both Vergennes and Franklin wrote letters of commendation.

Deane arrived in Philadelphia on July 14, 1778, and was shocked when Congress accused him of financial impropriety on the basis of reports by his fellow commissioner Arthur Lee. Because Deane had left his account books in Paris, he was neither able to properly defend himself nor seek reimbursement for money he had spent procuring supplies in France. (While he waited to address Congress, Deane stayed with Benedict Arnold, who had just been appointed military governor of Philadelphia.)

In a long and bitter dispute over the charges, Deane was defended before Congress by John Jay. He published a public defense in the December 5, 1778, issue of &quot;Pennsylvania Packet&quot; entitled &quot;The Address of Silas Deane to the Free and Virtuous Citizens of America&quot;, in which he attacked Arthur Lee, other members of the Lee family, and their associates. Arthur&#x27;s brothers Richard Henry Lee and Francis Lightfoot Lee both denounced Deane&#x27;s accusations as libelous and injurious to the American cause. On January 14, 1779, Deane replied in the &quot;Pennsylvania Packet,&quot; listing eight ships that had sailed from France with supplies because of his efforts. Congress offered him $10,000 in depreciated Continental currency in compensation, but Deane refused, believing the amount too small. Deane was allowed to return to Paris in 1780 to settle his affairs and attempt to assemble the records in dispute. On arrival, he discovered that he was nearly ruined financially because the value of his investments had plummeted, and some ships carrying his merchandise had been captured by the British.

In March 1781, King George III approved a request from Lord North to bribe Deane in an attempt to recruit him as a spy and to influence Congress. However, in mid-July they cancelled their plan after the king read intercepted letters in which Deane described the military situation of the Colonies as hopeless and suggested a rapprochement with Britain. Deane&#x27;s correspondence was then forwarded to General Henry Clinton, who provided copies to Loyalist James Rivington to publish in his newspaper &quot;Rivington&#x27;s Royal Gazette&quot; in New York City. Deane was then accused of treason by his fellow colonists. Rivington may have been a spy as a member of the Culper Ring, and unbeknownst to Deane, his former secretary in Paris, Edward Bancroft, had been a British spy.

==After the war and death==
In October 1781, Deane moved to Ghent where he could live more cheaply than in Paris. Then in March 1783, he moved to London, hoping to find investors for manufacturing ventures that he planned to pursue after he returned to North America. He toured several manufacturing towns in England in late 1783, considering plans for steam engines that could operate grist mills, even consulting James Watt for advice. He also tried to attract investors for a planned canal linking Lake Champlain and the St. Lawrence River. In 1784, he published a defense of his actions during the war entitled &quot;An Address to the Free and Independent Citizens of the United States of North America&quot;.

In the fall of 1787, Deane became bedridden from an unknown illness and did not fully recover until April 1789. His condition depleted his remaining money and forced him to depend on the charity of friends. In the summer of 1788, a Frenchman named Foulloy approached Thomas Jefferson in Paris with an account book and a letter book dating from Deane&#x27;s diplomatic mission, apparently stolen from Deane during his illness. Foulloy threatened to sell the books to the British government if Jefferson did not purchase them—which Jefferson eventually did after negotiating a greatly reduced price.

In 1789, Deane planned to return to North America in an attempt to recoup his lost fortune and reputation. After boarding the ship &quot;Boston Packet,&quot; he became ill and died on September 23 while the ship was awaiting repairs after turning back following damage from fierce winds. In 1959, historian Julian P. Boyd suggested that Deane might have been poisoned by Bancroft, because Bancroft might have felt threatened by Deane&#x27;s possible testimony to Congress.

==Legacy==

Silas Deane&#x27;s granddaughter Philura (Deane) Alden pressed his case before Congress, and his family was eventually paid $37,000 in 1841 (more than a million dollars in the early 21st century) for the money owed to him, on the grounds that the previous audit by the Continental Congress was &quot;ex parte, erroneous, and a gross injustice to Silas Deane&quot;.

Deane&#x27;s hometown of Wethersfield, Connecticut, has a Silas Deane Middle School and a Silas Deane Highway. A road in Ledyard, Connecticut, is named for him. Deane&#x27;s home in Wethersfield, now the Silas Deane House, has been restored, declared a National Historic Landmark, and opened to the public as a part of the Webb-Deane-Stevens Museum. Dean Street in Brooklyn is named for him.

<doc id="148300" wikidata="Q726681" url="?curid=148300" title="Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes">
<text>Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes (; 29 December 1719 – 13 February 1787) was a French statesman and diplomat. He served as Foreign Minister from 1774 to 1787 during the reign of Louis XVI, notably during the American War of Independence.

Vergennes rose through the ranks of the diplomatic service during postings in Portugal and Germany before receiving the important post of Envoy to the Ottoman Empire in 1755. While there he oversaw complex negotiations that resulted from the Diplomatic Revolution before being recalled in 1768. After assisting a pro-French faction to take power in Sweden, he returned home and was promoted to foreign minister.

Vergennes hoped that by giving French aid to the American revolutionaries he would be able to weaken British dominance of the international stage, in the wake of that kingdom&#x27;s victory over France in the recent Seven Years&#x27; War. Alliance with the revolutionaries produced mixed results for France as, despite helping to defeat Britain and secure American independence, he extracted little material gain from the war and the costs of fighting further damaged the already weakened French royal finances in the years before the French Revolution.

In part as a result of his efforts in crafting the American alliance, Vergennes became a dominant figure in French politics during the 1780s. He died on the eve of the revolution in his own nation.

==Early life==
Charles Gravier was born in Dijon, France, on 29 December 1719. His family were members of the country aristocracy. He spent his youth in a townhouse at Dijon and on the family&#x27;s country estates. He had an elder brother Jean Gravier, marquis de Vergennes, born in 1718, who eventually inherited the family estates. His mother died when he was three, and his father subsequently remarried. Vergennes received his education from Jesuits in Dijon. In 1739, at the age of twenty, he accepted an offer to go to Lisbon as an assistant to Théodore Chevignard de Chavigny, comte de Toulongeon who was mutually referred to as his &quot;uncle&quot;, but was in fact a more distant relative. Chavigny was an experienced diplomat and secret agent who had been made ambassador to Portugal.

==Diplomatic service==

===Portugal and Bavaria===
The objective of Chavigny and Vergennes in Lisbon was to keep Portugal from entering the War of the Austrian Succession on the side of Britain, a task that proved relatively easy as the Portuguese had little interest in joining the war. In 1743 Vergennes accompanied his uncle to the court of Charles VII who was the ruler of Bavaria and also held the title of Holy Roman Emperor. Charles VII was a key ally of the French in the ongoing war against Austria, and they were charged with keeping him in the war by assuaging his concerns which they accomplished successfully. They next were instrumental in the agreement of the Union of Frankfurt, a pact involving several German rulers to uphold Charles VII&#x27;s interests. after Charles VII&#x27;s sudden death in 1745, they strove to help his successor Maximilian III but were unable to prevent him from losing his capital at Munich and making peace with the Austrians at the Treaty of Füssen. In November 1745 Chavigny was relieved of his post, and returned to France accompanied by Vergennes. The following year they returned to Portugal to take up their previous posts there where they remained until 1749, unsuccessfully trying to negotiate a commercial treaty.

===Congress of Hanover===

After their return home, Vergennes and his uncle were now in favour with the French Foreign Minister Puiseulx. When Chavigny met Louis XV at Versailles, he lobbied for Vergennes to be given an appointment. In 1750 Vergennes was appointed as Ambassador to the Electorate of Trier, one of the smaller German electorates. Vergennes faced an immediate challenge, as the British were planning to have an Austrian candidate Archduke Joseph elected as King of the Romans, a position that designated the next Holy Roman Emperor. The Austrians had supplied the Emperor&#x27;s for centuries until 1740, when Charles VII of Bavaria had been elected triggering the War of the Austrian Succession. The title eventually came back under Austrian control, and in 1748 the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was agreed, bringing peace.

The British strategy was directed by the Duke of Newcastle, the Northern Secretary and brother of the Prime Minister. Newcastle hoped the election would prevent a recurrence of the recent war, by guaranteeing continued Austrian dominance in Germany. The French saw the proposal as part of a scheme by the British to boost their own power in Germany. Vergennes appointment was designed to frustrate the British plan, and Trier was considered a good strategic spot for this mission. He worked at getting the ruler of Trier to withhold his vote from Joseph, while mobilising wider resistance.

In 1752 an attempt to settle the matter, Newcastle travelled to Hanover where a special Congress was convened. In April 1752 Vergennes was appointed as envoy to George II of Great Britain in his separate role as Elector of Hanover. His task was to uphold French interests at the Congress, either by delaying the election or preventing it entirely. To enable this, France championed the claims of the French-allied Palatine for payment of money they claimed against Austria and Britain insisting it be settled before the election took place. The British eventually agreed to a settlement, but Austria refused to accept this, creating a rift between the two countries which endangered the Anglo-Austrian Alliance. Newcastle was ultimately forced to dissolve the Congress and abandon the election.

The Congress was regarded as a diplomatic triumph for Vergennes and he received praise from Newcastle for his skills. To counter a last attempt by Austria to get an agreement, Vergennes was sent to the Palatine in January 1753 where he secured confirmation that they would stick to France&#x27;s strategy. He then returned to Trier where he spent fourteen quiet months before he was given his next posting. His time in Germany shaped his views on diplomacy. He was critical of the British tendency of bowing to public opinion because of their democracy, and he was concerned by the rising power of Russia.

===Ottoman Empire===

His successful advocacy of French interests in Germany led him to believe his next posting would be as Ambassador to Bavaria. Instead, he was sent to the Ottoman Empire in 1755, first as minister plenipotentiary, then as full ambassador. The reason for Vergennes&#x27; original lesser rank was that sending a new ambassador was a time-consuming elaborate ceremony, and there was a sense of urgency because of the death of the previous ambassador. Before he left France, he was inducted into the Secret du Roi.

Vergennes arrived in Constantinople as the Seven Years&#x27; War was brewing and Osman III had recently come to the throne. The Ottomans were traditional allies of the French and were a major trading partner, but the weakening of Ottoman power and the growth of Russia threatened the old system. Despite their close ties, the two states had no formal alliance. In his official orders, Vergennes was ordered not to agree any treaty, but he received secret instructions from the king to agree a treaty if it supported the king&#x27;s schemes in Eastern Europe.

Vergennes&#x27;s task was to try to persuade the Ottomans to counter the Russian threat to Poland, working in conjunction with Prussia. The Diplomatic Revolution of 1756 turned that scheme upside down as France became friendly to and then allied to Austria and Russia and an enemy of Prussia, which forced Vergennes to reverse his anti-Russian rhetoric. The Ottoman leadership were angered by the new Franco-Austrian Alliance, which they saw as hostile towards them. Vergennes spent the next few years trying to repair relations and persuade the Turks not to attack Austria or Russia, as they were being urged to do by Prussian envoys.

Towards the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War, Vergennes tackled several new problems. A dramatic reversal of Russian policies following the succession of Peter III forced Vergennes to return to his previous policy of encouraging anti-Russian sentiment, only to change again when Peter was overthrown by his wife, Catherine. Vergennes also had to deal with the consequences of the theft of the Sultan&#x27;s flagship by Christian prisoners, who took it to Malta. The Sultan threatened to build up a large fleet and invade the island, potentially provoking a major war in the Mediterranean in which France would have to defend Malta in spite of the global war that it was already fighting. Eventually, a compromise was agreed in which the French negotiated the return of the ship, but not the prisoners, to the Sultan.

The Treaty of Paris in 1763 brought an end to the war, but France was forced to cede significant territory to the British, easing some of the strains on Vergennes. However, he was left personally disappointed by the decline in French prestige. He was also alarmed by the weakening of French influence in Poland, which, in 1764, elected Stanislas Poniatowski, a Russian-backed candidate, as its king after it became apparent that France was powerless to prevent it. Vergennes&#x27;s efforts to convince the Ottomans to intervene in the election were undermined by a failure to settle on a single French candidate for the throne, and both France and the Ottomans were eventually forced to acknowledge Stanislas as king. As he was a lover of Catherine the Great, it was believed that Poland would become a satellite of Russia or even that the two states might be merged.

===Marriage and recall===
In 1768, he was recalled, ostensibly because he married the widow Anne Duvivier (1730–1798), also known as de Viviers; they previously lived together while she was the ambassador&#x27;s mistress. In addition, Gravier married her without seeking the King&#x27;s consent. She was the widow of Francesco Testa (–1754), a merchant member of one of the oldest and distinguished Latin families of Péra, originally from Genoa. She was widowed at the age of 24, before she met Charles Gravier, and they had two daughters together. The painter Antoine de Favray who was living in Istanbul at this time painted Charles Gravier&#x27;s wife, Annette Duvivier, Comtesse de Vergennes, in an oriental costume, sitting on a divan, shortly before they married.

However, Charles Gravier was more probably recalled because the Duc de Choiseul thought him not competent to provoke a war between Imperial Russia and the Ottomans, which Choiseul hoped for. Choiseul wanted to weaken the power of Russia as he believed they were becoming too strong in the Baltic Sea. Choiseul regarded the best way of doing that as provoking a costly war between them and the Ottomans. Although he thought the strategy unwise, Vergennes continuously advocated war in Constantinople by trying to convince the Ottomans that war was the only way to check Russia&#x27;s rising power.

Vergennes&#x27;s marriage had taken place without the King&#x27;s consent, which was a requirement for French ambassadors. In France Vergennes encountered strong disapproval of his marriage and was aware that he returned home in disgrace. In spite of his doubts, Vergennes was successful in persuading the Ottomans to declare war against Russia, and in 1768 the Russo-Turkish War broke out. It eventually ended in a decisive victory for the Russians, who gained new territory, and further eroded Ottoman power. Despite his opposition to the policy, Vergennes still took credit in France for having fulfilled his orders to provoke a war. During this period Vergennes and Choiseul developed a mutual dislike of each other.

After Choiseul&#x27;s dismissal in 1770, Vergennes was sent to Sweden with instructions to help the pro-French Hats faction with advice and money. The revolution of 1772 by which King Gustav III secured power (19 August 1772) was a major diplomatic triumph for France and brought to an end the Swedish Age of Liberty, which brought back the absolute monarchy in Sweden.

==Foreign minister==

===Appointment===
With the accession of King Louis XVI in 1774, Vergennes became foreign minister. His policy was guided by the conviction that the power of the states on the periphery of Europe, namely Great Britain and Russia, was increasing, and ought to be diminished. When he was appointed to the job, he had spent almost the entirety of the previous thirty five years abroad in diplomatic service. He readily admitted that he had lost touch with developments in France, and was mocked by some political opponents as a &quot;foreigner&quot;. Despite this, or perhaps more because of it, he was able to view France&#x27;s foreign affairs with a more abstract nature, taking in the wider European context.

==American War of Independence==
Vergennes&#x27; rivalry with the British, and his desire to avenge the disasters of the Seven Years&#x27; War, led to his support of the Thirteen Colonies in the American War of Independence. As early as 1765, Vergennes predicted that the loss of the French threat in North America would lead to the Americans &quot;striking off their chains&quot;. In 1775 the first fighting broke out, and in July 1776, the colonists declared independence. Historians believe that, because of financial strains for France, this commitment contributed to the French Revolution of 1789.

===Entry into the war===
Long before France&#x27;s open entry into the war, Vergennes approved of Pierre Beaumarchais&#x27;s plan for secret French assistance. From early 1776, the French gave supplies, arms, ammunition and volunteers to the American rebels. The weakness of the British naval blockade off the American coast allowed large amounts of goods to reach the continent. In 1777, Vergennes informed the Americans&#x27; commissioners that France acknowledged the United States, and was willing to form an offensive and defensive alliance with the new state. In the wake of the Battle of Saratoga, a defeat for the British, Vergennes feared that the British and colonists might reconcile. He hastened to create an alliance with the Americans from fear that they might jointly attack France with the British.

Although Vergennes had long planned for France to enter the war jointly with Spain, Charles III was more interested in mediating the dispute, as he did not want to encourage colonial revolts. Vergennes pressed ahead with his alliance, in agreement with the American envoy Benjamin Franklin, which would almost certainly lead to war with Britain. In the wake of the Franco-American agreement, the Americans rejected British peace offers made by the Carlisle Peace Commission.

===Strategy===

Despite American rebels&#x27; optimism related to France&#x27;s entry into the war, the new forces did not quickly affect the balance of power in North America. A fleet under Admiral d&#x27;Estaing sailed to assist the rebels but failed in attacks on British forces in Rhode Island and Savannah, placing significant strains on Franco-American relations. Vergennes continued to send large amounts of money to keep the war effort afloat, but the British regained the initiative with their Southern Strategy.

In 1779, Spain&#x27;s entry into the war against the British made the Allies&#x27; joint fleet considerably larger than the British Royal Navy, but their attempted invasion of Britain that year miscarried. This seriously undermined Vergennes&#x27; plans, as he had anticipated a swift and simple war against the British. It promised to be considerably more difficult and expensive than he had hoped.

===League of Armed Neutrality===
By a series of negotiations, Vergennes sought to secure the armed neutrality of the Northern European states, which was eventually achieved by Catherine II of Russia. Britain declared war against the Dutch Republic in an attempt to keep the Dutch from joining the League. Vergennes believed the Dutch were most valuable as neutrals, as they could supply France through the British blockade, than as allies. He briefly entertained the hope that the British war against the Dutch would provoke the Russians to enter the war against them, but Catherine declined to act. The Dutch entry into the war placed further strains on the French treasury, as they searched for finances to support the Dutch war effort.

Vergennes acted as an intermediary in the War of the Bavarian Succession between Austria and Prussia, which he feared could trigger a major European war. He did not want his strategy of sending French and Spanish forces against Britain in the Americas to be deflected by troops and resources being diverted to Central Europe. The conflict was ended relatively peacefully by the Treaty of Teschen, of which France was a guarantor. Vergennes&#x27;s strategy to prevent Britain from gaining allies from the European great powers was a success. In sharp contrast to previous wars, the British were forced to fight the entire war without a significant ally.

===Yorktown===
The first French expedition to America under d&#x27;Estaing returned to France in 1779. The following year, another fleet was dispatched under Admiral de Grasse.

The Expédition Particulière, a sizable force of French soldiers under the comte de Rochambeau, arrived in America in July 1780. In October 1781, the French force played a key role in the surrender of a British army at Yorktown. In spite of the large British military presence in the colonies and its continued control of several major cities, in early 1782, the British parliament passed a resolution suspending further offensives against the Americans. This did not apply to their other enemies in other theatres of war.

===1782===
After the success at Yorktown, the French fleet went to the West Indies as part of a plan to invade Britain&#x27;s colony of Jamaica. In April 1782 at the Battle of the Saintes, the French fleet suffered a major defeat and de Grasse was captured by the British. Both France and Britain understood this victory to restore British control of the high seas. Since 1779, Allied forces had laid siege to the British base at Gibraltar. In 1782, a major Franco-Spanish attack on Gibraltar failed, and the fort was relieved shortly afterward. This presented a major problem to Vergennes, as his treaty of alliance with the Spanish had committed the French to keep fighting until Gibraltar was under Spanish control. Failure to gain control of Gibraltar could potentially extend the war indefinitely.

These two defeats undermined the French confidence that had greeted the success at Yorktown. Vergennes grew increasingly pessimistic about allied prospects during the coming year. By this stage, peace negotiations were well underway. During 1782, Vergennes committed French troops to put down a democratic revolution in the Republic of Geneva, which had broken out the previous year.

==Treaty of Paris==

By 1782 Vergennes was growing increasingly frustrated by what he regarded as the inability of the United States to justify its use of the large sums of money which France had given them. He remarked to Lafayette, who had recently returned from America, &quot;I am not marvelously pleased with the country that you have just left. I find it barely active and very demanding.&quot; Although he continued to enjoy a warm relationship with Benjamin Franklin, the American peace commissioners John Jay and John Adams distrusted Vergennes&#x27; motives and began separate peace talks with British envoys.

When Vergennes discovered in November 1782 that the Americans had concluded a separate peace with the British, he felt betrayed, as they had previously agreed that a joint peace would be negotiated between them. In light of the generous terms that Britain had granted to the United States, although they refused to cede Canada, Vergennes remarked, &quot;The English buy peace rather than make it.&quot;

During the negotiations leading up to the Treaty of Paris, Vergennes tried to balance the conflicting interests of France, Spain and the United States. He was largely unsympathetic to the Dutch, believing that their disappointing effort in the war did not justify his championing their goals at the peace table. He played a major role in persuading Spain to accept a peace agreement that did not give them Gibraltar; without their concession, it was likely the war would have been prolonged at least one more year, which French national finances could not afford.

France&#x27;s own peace terms with Britain were completed in January 1783. Worried that another year of war would result in further British victories, Vergennes was keen to reach an agreement. France received Tobago, several trading posts in Africa, and the end of trading restrictions at Dunkirk. Vergennes claimed that France&#x27;s limited gains justified his position that their participation had been ed. He was criticised for this by Marquis de Castries, who believed that most of the war&#x27;s burdens had been on France, while most of the benefits went to her allies.

==Last years==
===Foreign policy===
Despite its claim of victory from the American War of Independence, France&#x27;s foreign situation began to decline rapidly in the years after 1783. French resources were increasingly strained and unable to support the nation&#x27;s traditional role in Europe. During the Dutch Crisis of 1787, France was unable to prevent the intervention of Prussian troops, who crushed the French-allied Patriots in the Dutch Republic. The diplomatic retreat was a contributing factor to the French Revolution.

Vergennes encouraged King Louis to sponsor expeditions to Indochina. These contributed to the French exploration and conquest under the Third French Empire.

===Domestic politics===
In domestic affairs, Vergennes remained conservative, carrying out intrigues to have Jacques Necker removed. He regarded Necker, a foreign Protestant, as a dangerous innovator and secret republican and was wary of his Anglophile views. In 1781, Vergennes became chief of the council of finance, and, in 1783, he supported the nomination of Charles Alexandre de Calonne as Controller-General.

Vergennes died just before the meeting of the Assembly of Notables, which he is said to have suggested to Louis XVI. The opening of the Assembly was delayed several times to accommodate him after he had grown ill from overwork, but on 13 February 1787, he died. When Louis XVI was told the news, he broke down in tears, describing Vergennes as &quot;the only friend I could count on, the one minister who never deceived me.&quot;

After his death in 1787, the French national situation deteriorated, leading to the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789. In January 1793, the rebels executed the King. France was soon at war with many of its neighbours. In The Terror that followed, the government imprisoned and killed many of Vergennes&#x27; contemporaries.

==Legacy and popular culture==
American historians have often portrayed Vergennes as a visionary, because of his support for United States independence. Other historians believe that his support for a republican insurrection and the enormous cost which France incurred in the war, caused the French Revolution, which brought down the French monarchy and the system he served.

The city of Vergennes, Vermont in the United States was named after him, as promulgated by Ethan Allen and suggested by Crèvecoeur.

In 1784, Vergennes was elected an international member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia.

Vergennes was played by Guillaume Gallienne in the film &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (2006), by Jean-Hugues Anglade in the 2008 HBO series &quot;John Adams&quot;, and by Thibault de Montalembert in the 2024 miniseries &quot;Franklin&quot;.

The Gravier family is a family of the surviving French nobility.

<text>Otto von Habsburg (, ; 20 November 1912 4 July 2011) was the last crown prince of Austria-Hungary from 1916 until the dissolution of the empire in November 1918. In 1922, he became the pretender to the former thrones, head of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, and sovereign of the Order of the Golden Fleece, upon the death of his father. He resigned as Sovereign of the Golden Fleece in 2000 and as head of the Imperial House in 2007.

The eldest son of Charles I and IV, the last emperor of Austria and king of Hungary, and his wife, Zita of Bourbon-Parma, Otto was born as &quot;Franz Joseph Otto Robert Maria Anton Karl Max Heinrich Sixtus Xaver Felix Renatus Ludwig Gaetan Pius Ignatius von Habsburg&quot;, third in line to the thrones, as Archduke Otto of Austria, Royal Prince of Hungary, Bohemia, and Croatia. With his father&#x27;s accession to the thrones in 1916, he was likely to become emperor and king. As his father never abdicated, Otto was considered by himself, his family and Austro-Hungarian legitimists to be the rightful emperor-king from his father&#x27;s death in 1922. Otto was active on the Austrian and European political stage from the 1930s, both by promoting the cause of Habsburg restoration and as an early proponent of European integration; he was a fierce opponent of Nazism, nationalism, and communism. He has been described as one of the leaders of the Austrian Resistance. After the 1938 &quot;Anschluss&quot;, he was sentenced to death by the Nazis and fled Europe to the United States.

Otto von Habsburg was Vice President (1957–1973) and President (1973–2004) of the International Paneuropean Union movement. From 1979 to 1999, he served as a Member of the European Parliament for Germany&#x27;s Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CSU). As a newly elected Member of the European Parliament in 1979, Otto took a strong interest in the countries behind the Iron Curtain, and had an empty chair set up in the European Parliament to symbolize their absence. Otto von Habsburg played a notable role in the revolutions of 1989 as a co-initiator of the Pan-European Picnic. Later, he was a strong supporter of the EU membership of Central and Eastern European countries. A noted intellectual, he published several books on historical and political affairs. Otto has been described as one of the &quot;architects of the European idea and of European integration&quot; together with Robert Schuman, Konrad Adenauer, and Alcide De Gasperi.

Otto was exiled in 1919 and grew up mostly in Spain. His devout Catholic mother raised him according to the old curriculum of Austria-Hungary, preparing him to become a Catholic monarch. During his life in exile, he lived in Austria, Belgium, France, Madeira (Portugal), Spain, Switzerland, the United States, and from 1954 until his death, finally in Bavaria (Germany), in the residence Villa Austria. He had been stateless and , and possessed passports of the Order of Malta and Spain. His funeral took place at St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral in Vienna on 16 July 2011; he was entombed in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna and his heart buried in Pannonhalma Archabbey in Hungary.

==Early life==

Otto was born at Villa Wartholz in Reichenau an der Rax, Austria-Hungary, during the reign of his great-granduncle, Franz Joseph I of Austria. He was baptised Franz Joseph Otto Robert Maria Anton Karl Max Heinrich Sixtus Xaver Felix Renatus Ludwig Gaetan Pius Ignatius on 25 November 1912 at Villa Wartholz by Franz Xaver Cardinal Nagl, Prince-Archbishop of Vienna. This name was chosen so that he might reign as &quot;Franz Joseph II&quot; in the future. His godfather was Franz Joseph I, Emperor of Austria (represented by Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria); his godmother was his grandmother Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal.

In November 1916, Otto became Crown Prince of Austria, Hungary, Bohemia and Croatia when his father, Archduke Charles, acceded to the throne. However, in 1918, after the end of the First World War, the monarchies were abolished, the republics of Austria and Hungary were founded in their place, and the family was forced into exile in Madeira. Hungary did become a kingdom again, but Charles was never to regain the throne. Instead, Miklós Horthy ruled as regent until 1944, in a kingdom without a king.

Otto spoke German, Hungarian, Croatian, English, Spanish, French and Latin fluently. In later life, he would write some forty books in German, Hungarian, French and Spanish. His mother made him learn many languages because she believed he one day might rule over many lands.

==Years in exile==
Otto was in the Gödöllő Palace during the Aster Revolution, but quickly evacuated from Hungary at the rise of republican sentiment. Otto&#x27;s family spent the subsequent years in Switzerland, and on the Portuguese island of Madeira, where 34-year-old Charles died in 1922, leaving the nine-year-old Otto pretender to the throne. On his father&#x27;s deathbed, his mother, Empress Dowager Zita, told Otto, &quot;your father is now sleeping the eternal sleep—you are now Emperor and King&quot;. The family eventually relocated to the Basque town of Lekeitio, where forty Spanish grandees bought them a villa.

Meanwhile, the Austrian parliament had officially expelled the Habsburg dynasty and confiscated all the official property via the Habsburg Law of 3 April 1919. Charles was banned from ever returning to Austria again, while Otto and other male members could return only if they renounced all claims to the throne and accepted the status of private citizens.

In 1935, he graduated with a doctorate in Political and Social Sciences from the University of Louvain in Belgium. His thesis was on &quot;the right, born of usage and of the peasant law of inheritance, of the indivisibility of rural land ownership in Austria&quot;. In 1937 he wrote,


He continued to enjoy considerable public support in Austria; from 1931 to 1938, 1,603 Austrian municipalities named Otto an honorary citizen. John Gunther believed that Zita was less popular among Austrians, however, writing in 1936 that &quot;restoration would be a good deal closer if Otto&#x27;s return would not mean also the return of his mother—to say nothing of hundreds of assorted and impoverished Habsburg cousins and aunts, who would flock to Vienna like ants to a keg of syrup&quot;. A greater obstacle, he wrote, was the opposition of Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, which feared that their people might want to rejoin a recreated monarchy.

==World War II==
Otto denounced Nazism, stating:

He strongly opposed the &quot;Anschluss&quot;, and in 1938 requested Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg to resist Nazi Germany. He supported international intervention and offered to return from exile to take over the reins of government to repel the Nazis. According to Gerald Warner, &quot;Austrian Jews were among the strongest supporters of a Habsburg restoration, since they believed the dynasty would give the nation sufficient resolve to stand up to the Third Reich&quot;.

Following the German annexation of Austria, Otto was sentenced to death by the Nazi regime; Rudolf Hess ordered that Otto was to be executed immediately if caught. As ordered by Adolf Hitler, his personal property and that of the House of Habsburg were confiscated. It was not returned after the war. The so-called &quot;Habsburg Law&quot;, which had previously been repealed, was reintroduced by the Nazis. Otto&#x27;s supporters, the leaders of the Austrian legitimist movement, were arrested by the Nazis and largely executed (Stefan Zweig&#x27;s novella &quot;The Royal Game&quot; is based on these events). Otto&#x27;s cousins Max, Duke of Hohenberg, and Prince Ernst of Hohenberg were arrested in Vienna by the Gestapo and sent to Dachau concentration camp where they remained throughout Nazi rule. Otto was involved in helping around 15,000 Austrians, including thousands of Austrian Jews, flee the country at the beginning of the Second World War.

After the German invasion of France in 1940, the family left the French capital and fled to Portugal. On 12 June the Portuguese ruler António Salazar issued instructions to the Portuguese consulates in France to provide Infanta Maria Antónia of Portugal with Portuguese passports which would allow visas for her daughter Empress Zita and grandson Otto without violating Portuguese neutrality. The family resided in Cascais during their exodus. When the German authorities pressed Salazar for Otto&#x27;s extradition from Portugal, Salazar offered to protect Otto, but asked him as a friend to leave the country. Otto left, and lived from 1940 to 1944 in Washington, D.C. In 1941, Hitler personally revoked the citizenship of Otto, his mother and his siblings, and the imperial-royal family found themselves stateless.

Otto was listed on the Nazi Sonderfahndungsliste G.B. (&quot;Special Search List Great Britain&quot;), and was the unofficial head of numerous resistance groups in Central Europe. These groups hated Nazi ideology and saw the resurgence of a Danube confederation as the only way for small states to exist between Germany and Russia. They championed the centuries-old Habsburg principle of &quot;live and let live&quot; among ethnic groups, peoples, minorities, religions, cultures and languages. These imperial resistance groups became embroiled in ferocious partisan warfare against Hitler, who profoundly hated the Habsburg family tradition. Many of these imperial resistance fighters (according to current estimates 4000–4500) were sent directly to concentration camps without trial, and over 800 were executed by the Nazis. Among them was Karl Burian, who was planning to blow up the Gestapo headquarters in Vienna, or Dr. Heinrich Maier, who passed on plans and production facilities for V-2 rockets, Tiger tanks and Messerschmitt airplanes to the Allies. In contrast to many other German resistance groups, the Maier group was informed very early about the mass murder of Jews through its contacts with the Semperit factory near Auschwitz.

During his wartime exile in the United States, Otto and his younger brothers were in direct contact with President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the federal government. His efforts to create an &quot;Austrian Battalion&quot; in the United States Army were delayed and never implemented. However, he successfully convinced the U.S. to halt or limit the bombardment of Austrian cities, especially Vienna; due to this influence, bombardments on Vienna were delayed until 1943. Otto greatly desired Austria to be free, independent and democratic; he expressed concern that after the war the country was in danger of becoming a Soviet satellite state. Otto was commonly known in the U.S. as &quot;Otto of Austria&quot;, and tried to keep his homeland and its neighbors in the minds of the American people by inaugurating a series of stamps (the Overrun Countries series) featuring the German-occupied nations of Europe.

He obtained the support of Winston Churchill for a conservative &quot;Danube Federation&quot;, in effect a restoration of Austria-Hungary, but Joseph Stalin put an end to these plans. Otto lobbied for the recognition of an Austrian government-in-exile, for the rights of the German-speaking population of South Tyrol, against the deportation of the German-speaking inhabitants of Bohemia and eastern Europe, and against letting Stalin rule Eastern Europe.

==After World War II==
At the end of the war, Otto returned to Europe and lived for several years in France and Spain.

As he did not possess a passport and was effectively stateless, he was given a passport of the Principality of Monaco, thanks to the intervention of Charles de Gaulle in 1946. The Sovereign Military Order of Malta, of which he was a knight, also issued him a diplomatic passport. Later, he was also issued a Spanish diplomatic passport.

On 8 May 1956, Otto was recognized as an Austrian citizen by the provincial government of Lower Austria. The Austrian Interior Ministry approved this declaration of citizenship, but on the condition that he accept the name Dr. Otto Habsburg-Lothringen, on 8 February 1957. However, this only entitled him to a passport &quot;valid in every country but Austria&quot;. Otto had already submitted a written statement, on 21 February 1958, that he and his family would renounce all former personal privileges of the House of Habsburg, but this did not satisfy the requirements of the Habsburg Law, which stated that Otto and other descendants of Charles could only return to Austria if they renounced all royal claims and accepted the status of private citizens. He officially declared his loyalty to the Republic of Austria on 5 June 1961, but this statement was ruled insufficient as well.

In a declaration dated 31 May 1961, Otto renounced all claims to the Austrian throne and proclaimed himself &quot;a loyal citizen of the republic&quot;, &quot;for purely practical reasons&quot;. In a 2007 interview on the occasion of his approaching 95th birthday, Otto stated:

The Austrian administrative court found on 24 May 1963 that Otto&#x27;s statement was legally sufficient. Upon his return to Austria, he and his wife were issued a Certified Proof of Citizenship on 20 July 1965. However, several political elements in the country, particularly the Socialists, were ill-disposed to welcoming back the heir of the deposed dynasty. This touched off political infighting and civil unrest that almost precipitated a crisis of state, and later became known as the &quot;Habsburg Crisis&quot;. It was only on 1 June 1966, after the People&#x27;s Party won an outright majority in the national election, that Otto was issued an Austrian passport, and was finally able to visit his home country again on 31 October 1966 for the first time in 48 years. That day, he traveled to Innsbruck to visit the grave of Archduke Eugen of Austria. Later, he visited Vienna on 5 July 1967.

==Political career==
An early advocate of a unified Europe, Otto was president of the International Paneuropean Union from 1973 to 2004. He served from 1979 until 1999 as a Member of the European Parliament for the conservative Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CSU) party, eventually becoming the senior member of the European Parliament. He was also a member of the Mont Pelerin Society. Habsburg was also part of the secretive conservative network Le Cercle during the cold war. He was a major supporter of the expansion of the European Union from the beginning and especially of the acceptance of Hungary, Slovenia and Croatia. During his time in the European Parliament, he was involved in a fracas with fellow MEP Ian Paisley, a unionist Protestant pastor from Northern Ireland. In 1988, Pope John Paul II had just begun a speech to the Parliament when Ian Paisley, a vehement anti-Catholic, shouted and held up a poster reading &quot;Pope John Paul II Antichrist&quot;. While other members threw papers and other objects at Paisley, Otto snatched Paisley&#x27;s banner and, along with other MEPs and security personnel, roughed him up, punched him, tore his shirt, pulled on his tie, and ejected him head-first through the doors of the chamber, as the Pope looked on.

With others, he was instrumental in organising the so-called Pan-European Picnic at the Hungary-Austria border on 19 August 1989. This event is considered a milestone in the collapse of Communist dictatorships in Europe.
In December 2006, he observed that, &quot;The catastrophe of 11 September 2001 struck the United States more profoundly than any of us, whence a certain mutual incomprehension. Until then, the United States felt itself secure, persuaded of its power to bombard any enemy, without anyone being able to strike back. That sentiment vanished in an instant. Americans understand viscerally for the first time the risks they face.&quot; He was known as a supporter of the rights of refugees and displaced people in Europe, notably of the ethnic Germans displaced from Bohemia where he was once the Crown Prince. He was a jury member of the Franz Werfel Human Rights Award. He also held Francisco Franco in a high regard and praised him for helping refugees, stating that he was &quot;a dictator of the South American type, not totalitarian like Hitler or Stalin&quot;.

In 2002, he was named the first-ever honorary member of the European People&#x27;s Party group.

Otto von Habsburg was an early critic of Russian President Putin. In a newspaper interview in 2002 and in two speeches in 2003 and 2005, he warned of Putin as an &quot;international threat&quot; that he was &quot;cruel and oppressive&quot; and a &quot;stone cold technocrat&quot;.

==Criticism and controversy==
At the end of 1998 Habsburg was targeted by criticism and the public prosecutor&#x27;s office in Munich because he compared the allegations and calls for resignation against his son Karl Habsburg in connection with the World Vision donation affair with the Nazi persecution of the Jews:

Karl Habsburg&#x27;s EU election campaign for the ÖVP in 1996 was partly financed - according to Habsburg without his knowledge - with donations from the aid organization World Vision Austria that were embezzled and diverted to the Paneuropean Union.

Otto&#x27;s public advocacy for the weekly Junge Freiheit which was affiliated with the Neue Rechte, and for which he repeatedly made himself available as an interviewee, was met with criticism. As the first to sign two petitions initiated by the editors, he campaigned in 2002 against the background of a legal dispute against the then constitutional protection categorization of the newspaper as &quot;right-wing extremist&quot; and in 2006 against its uninvitation at the Leipzig Book Fair.

In 2002, Habsburg said in an interview with Junge Freiheit that US domestic policy was split in two, namely a Department of Defense &quot;filled with Jews&quot; in key positions, &quot;today a Jewish institution&quot;, on the one hand and one by &quot;blacks, on the other hand&quot;. For example, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice &quot;occupied&quot; State Department. On the other hand, after the Habsburgs, the &quot;Anglo-Saxons, i.e. the white Americans&quot; played &quot;hardly any role&quot;.

In November 2007, the Habsburgs commented on their position on Engelbert Dollfuss&#x27; coup. He &quot;respected Dollfuss infinitely. The man was brave, ready to stand up for Austria to the last consequence. At that time I saw everything from this perspective: We have to preserve Austria&quot;. He also had &quot;no&quot; problem at all with the dissolution of parliament and the ban on parties and trade unions: &quot;When it comes to the country, I&#x27;m ready for anything.&quot;

On the 2008 anniversary of the Anschluss, Otto von Habsburg made a statement as part of his &quot;1938 Remembrance Day&quot; address before Parliament that &quot;there is no country in Europe that has a better claim to be a victim of the Nazis than Austria&quot;. Although his speech received an ovation, this received public protest, media criticism and disapproval voiced by Austrian politicians. Social Democratic Party Defence Minister Norbert Darabos was quoted as saying that the remarks were &quot;unacceptable&quot;, &quot;a veritable democratic-political scandal&quot; and that he had &quot;insulted the victims of National Socialism&quot;. Otto von Habsburg was also quoted as saying that &quot;a discussion as to whether Austria was an accomplice or a victim is an outrage&quot;. Austrian People&#x27;s Party military spokesman Walter Murauer defended Otto&#x27;s statement at the time. 

Murauer claimed that there was &quot;another reality behind the mass of people who listened to Hitler on the Heldenplatz&quot;, meaning the &quot;thousands in the resistance and thousands in prison waiting to be transported to Dachau&quot; near Munich. Murauer also recalled that Engelbert Dollfuß had been the only head of government in Europe to have been murdered by the Nazis. Murauer advised Darabos &quot;to avoid populist pot-shots against an honourable European of the highest calibre&quot;. Otto&#x27;s son, Karl von Habsburg, also defended his father&#x27;s words, in a 2011 statement, stating that &quot;there were guilty parties in practically every country&quot;.

==Death and funeral==

After the death of his wife, Regina, aged 85, in Pöcking on 3 February 2010, Otto stopped appearing in public. He died at the age of 98 on Monday, 4 July 2011, at his home in Pöcking, Germany. His spokeswoman reported that he died &quot;peacefully and without pain in his sleep&quot;. On 5 July, his body was laid in repose in the Church of St. Ulrich near his home in Pöcking, Bavaria, and a massive 13-day period of mourning started in several countries formerly part of Austria-Hungary. Otto&#x27;s coffin was draped with the Habsburg flag decorated with the imperial–royal coats of arms of Austria and Hungary in addition to the Habsburg family coat of arms. In line with the Habsburg family tradition, Otto von Habsburg was buried in the family&#x27;s crypt in Vienna, while his heart was buried in Pannonhalma Archabbey in Hungary.

==Family==
He married Princess Regina of Saxe-Meiningen on 10 May 1951 at the Church of Saint-François-des-Cordeliers in Nancy, capital city of Lorraine. They were fourth cousins as both were descendants of Karl Ludwig, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg and his wife Countess Amalie Henriette of Solms-Baruth. The wedding was attended by his mother, Empress Zita. He returned there with his wife for their golden jubilee in 2001.

<doc id="148313" wikidata="Q76555" url="?curid=148313" title="Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor">
<text>Joseph II (13 March 1741 – 20 February 1790) was Holy Roman Emperor from 18 August 1765 and sole ruler of the Habsburg monarchy from 29 November 1780 until his death. He was the eldest son of Empress Maria Theresa and her husband, Emperor Francis I, and the brother of Marie Antoinette, Leopold II, Maria Carolina of Austria, and Maria Amalia, Duchess of Parma. He was thus the first ruler in the Austrian dominions of the union of the Houses of Habsburg and Lorraine, styled Habsburg-Lorraine.

Joseph was a proponent of enlightened absolutism like his brother Leopold II; however, his commitment to secularizing, liberalizing and modernizing reforms resulted in significant opposition, which resulted in failure to fully implement his programs. Meanwhile, despite making some territorial gains, his reckless foreign policy badly isolated Austria. He has been ranked with Catherine the Great of Russia and Frederick the Great of Prussia as one of the three great Enlightenment monarchs. False but influential letters depict him as a somewhat more radical &quot;philosophe&quot; than he probably was. His policies are now known as Josephinism.

He was a supporter of the arts, particularly of composers such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. He died with no known surviving legitimate offspring and was succeeded by his younger brother Leopold II.

==Early life==
He was baptised under the full name Josephus Benedictus Joannes Antonius Michael Adamus, born an archduke of Austria. Joseph was born in the midst of the early upheavals of the War of the Austrian Succession. His formal education was provided through the writings of David Hume, Edward Gibbon, Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and the &quot;Encyclopédistes&quot;, and by the example of his contemporary (and sometimes rival) King Frederick II of Prussia. His practical training was conferred by government officials, who were directed to instruct him in the mechanical details of the administration of the numerous states composing the Austrian dominions and the Holy Roman Empire.

==Marriages and children==
Joseph married Princess Isabella of Parma in October 1760, a union fashioned to bolster the 1756 defensive pact between France and Austria. (The bride&#x27;s mother, Princess Louise Élisabeth, was the eldest daughter of Louis XV of France and his popular wife, Queen Marie Leczinska. Isabella&#x27;s father was Philip, Duke of Parma.) Joseph loved his bride, Isabella, finding her both stimulating and charming, and she sought with special care to cultivate his favor and affection. Isabella also found a best friend and confidant in her husband&#x27;s sister, Maria Christina, Duchess of Teschen.

The marriage of Joseph and Isabella resulted in the birth of a daughter, Maria Theresa. Isabella was fearful of pregnancy and early death, largely a result of the early loss of her mother. Her own pregnancy proved especially difficult as she suffered symptoms of pain, illness and melancholy both during and afterward, though Joseph attended to her and tried to comfort her. She remained bedridden for six weeks after their daughter&#x27;s birth.

Almost immediately on the back of their newfound parenthood, the couple then endured two consecutive miscarriages—an ordeal particularly hard on Isabella—followed quickly by another pregnancy. Pregnancy was again provoking melancholy, fears and dread in Isabella. In November 1763, while six months pregnant, Isabella fell ill with smallpox and went into premature labor, resulting in the birth of their second child, Archduchess Maria Christina (b.d November 22 1763), who died shortly after being born.

Progressively ill with smallpox and strained by sudden childbirth and tragedy, Isabella died the following week. The loss of his beloved wife and their newborn child was devastating for Joseph, after which he felt keenly reluctant to remarry, though he dearly loved his daughter and remained a devoted father to Maria Theresa.

For political reasons, and under constant pressure, in 1765, he relented and married his second cousin, Princess Maria Josepha of Bavaria, the daughter of Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor, and Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria. This marriage proved extremely unhappy, albeit brief, as it lasted only two years.

Though Maria Josepha loved her husband, she felt timid and inferior in his company. Lacking common interests or pleasures, the relationship offered little for Joseph, who confessed he felt no love (nor attraction) for her in return. He adapted by distancing himself from his wife to the point of near total avoidance, seeing her only at meals and upon retiring to bed. Maria Josepha, in turn, suffered considerable misery in finding herself locked in a cold, loveless union.

Four months after the second anniversary of their wedding, Maria Josepha grew ill and died from smallpox. Joseph neither visited her during her illness nor attended her funeral, though he later expressed regret for not having shown her more kindness, respect, or warmth. One thing the union did provide him was the improved possibility of laying claim to a portion of Bavaria, though this would ultimately lead to the War of the Bavarian Succession.

Joseph never remarried. In 1770, Joseph&#x27;s only surviving child, the seven-year-old Maria Theresa, became ill with pleurisy and died. The loss of his daughter was deeply traumatic for him and left him grief-stricken and scarred. Lacking children, Joseph II was ultimately succeeded by his younger brother, who became Leopold II.

==Co-ruler==
Joseph was made a member of the constituted council of state (&quot;Staatsrat&quot;) and began to draw up minutes for his mother to read. These papers contain the germs of his later policy, and of all the disasters that finally overtook him. He was a friend to religious toleration, anxious to reduce the power of the church, to relieve the peasantry of feudal burdens, and to remove restrictions on trade and knowledge. In these, he did not differ from Frederick, or his own brother and successor Leopold II, all enlightened rulers of the 18th century. He tried to liberate serfs, but that did not last after his death.

Where Joseph differed from great contemporary rulers, and was akin to the Jacobins in the intensity of his belief in the power of the state when directed by reason. As an absolutist ruler, however, he was also convinced of his right to speak for the state uncontrolled by laws, and of the wisdom of his own rule. He had also inherited from his mother the belief of the House of Austria in its &quot;August&quot; quality and its claim to acquire whatever it found desirable for its power or profit. He was unable to understand that his philosophical plans for the moulding of humanity could meet with pardonable opposition.

Joseph was documented by contemporaries as being impressive, but not necessarily likable. In 1760, his arranged consort, the well educated Isabella of Parma, was handed over to him. Joseph appears to have been completely in love with her, but Isabella preferred the companionship of Joseph&#x27;s sister, Marie Christine of Austria. The overweening character of the Emperor was obvious to Frederick II of Prussia, who, after their first interview in 1769, described him as ambitious, and as capable of setting the world on fire. The French minister Vergennes, who met Joseph when he was traveling incognito in 1777, judged him to be &quot;ambitious and despotic&quot;.

After the death of his father in 1765, he became emperor and was made co-regent by his mother in the Austrian dominions. As emperor, he had little true power, and his mother had resolved that neither her husband nor her son should ever deprive her of sovereign control in her hereditary dominions. Joseph, by threatening to resign his place as co-regent, could induce his mother to abate her dislike for religious toleration.

He could and did place a great strain on her patience and temper, as in the case of the First Partition of Poland and the War of the Bavarian Succession of 1778–1779, but in the last resort the empress spoke the final word. Therefore, until the death of his mother in 1780, Joseph was never quite free to follow his own instincts.

During these years, Joseph traveled much. He met Frederick the Great privately at Neisse in 1769 (later painted in &quot;The Meeting of Frederick II and Joseph II in Neisse in 1769&quot;), and again at Mährisch-Neustadt in 1770; the two rulers initially got along well. On the second occasion, he was accompanied by Prince Kaunitz, whose conversation with Frederick may be said to mark the starting point of the First Partition of Poland. To this and to every other measure which promised to extend the dominions of his house, Joseph gave hearty approval. Thus, when Frederick fell severely ill in 1775, Joseph assembled an army in Bohemia which, in the event of Frederick&#x27;s death, was to advance into Prussia and demand Silesia (a territory Frederick had conquered from Maria Theresa in the War of the Austrian Succession). However, Frederick recovered, and thereafter became wary and mistrustful of Joseph.

Joseph was also eager to enforce Austria&#x27;s claim on Bavaria upon the death of the elector Maximilian III in 1777. In April of that year, he paid a visit to his sister the queen of France, Marie Antoinette of Austria, traveling under the name of &quot;Count Falkenstein&quot;. He was well received and much flattered by the Encyclopedists, but his observations led him to predict the approaching downfall of the French monarchy, and he was not impressed favorably by the French army or navy.

In 1778, he commanded the troops collected to oppose Frederick, who supported the rival claimant to Bavaria. This was the War of the Bavarian Succession. Real fighting was averted by the unwillingness of Frederick to embark on a new war and by Maria Theresa&#x27;s determination to maintain peace. However, the war cost Joseph most of his influence over the other German princes, who were wary of his potential designs on their lands, and looked to Frederick as their protector.

As the son of Francis I, Joseph succeeded him as titular Duke of Lorraine and Bar, which had been surrendered to France on his father&#x27;s marriage, and titular King of Jerusalem and Duke of Calabria (as a proxy for the Kingdom of Naples).

==Sole reign==

===Domestic policy===
The death of Maria Theresa on 29 November 1780 left Joseph free to pursue his own policy, and he immediately directed his government on a new course, attempting to realize his ideal of enlightened despotism acting on a definite system for the good of all.

He undertook the spread of education, the secularization of church lands, the reduction of the religious orders and the clergy, in general, to complete submission to the lay state, the issue of the Patent of Toleration (1781) providing limited guarantee of freedom of worship, and the promotion of unity by the compulsory use of the German language (replacing Latin or in some instances local languages)—everything which from the point of view of 18th-century philosophy, the Age of Enlightenment, appeared &quot;reasonable&quot;. He strove for administrative unity with characteristic haste to reach results without preparation. Joseph carried out measures of the emancipation of the peasantry, which his mother had begun, and abolished serfdom in 1781.

In 1789, he decreed that peasants must be paid in cash payments rather than labor obligations. These policies were violently rejected by the nobility, clergy, merchants and the peasants, since their barter economy lacked money. Joseph also abolished the death penalty in 1787, a reform that remained until 1795.

After the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, Joseph sought to help the family of his estranged sister Queen Marie Antoinette of France and her husband King Louis XVI. Joseph kept an eye on the development of the revolution, and became actively involved in the planning of a rescue attempt. These plans failed, however, either due to Marie Antoinette&#x27;s refusal to leave her children behind in favor of a faster carriage or Louis XVI&#x27;s reluctance to become a fugitive king.

Joseph died in 1790, making negotiations with Austria about possible rescue attempts more difficult. It was not until 21 June 1791 that an attempt was made, with the help of Count Fersen, a Swedish general who had been favored at the courts of both Marie Antoinette and Joseph. The attempt failed after the King was recognized from the back of a coin. Marie Antoinette became increasingly desperate for help from her homeland, even giving French military secrets to Austria. Nevertheless, even though Austria was at war with France at the time, it refused to directly help the by now completely estranged French Queen.

===Administrative policies===
When Maria Theresa died, Joseph started issuing edicts, over 6,000 in all, plus 11,000 new laws designed to regulate and reorder every aspect of the empire. The spirit of Josephinism was benevolent and paternal. He intended to make his people happy, but strictly in accordance with his own criteria.

Joseph set about building a rationalized, centralized, and uniform government for his diverse lands, a hierarchy under himself as a supreme autocrat. The personnel of government was expected to be imbued with the same dedicated spirit of service to the state that he himself had. It was recruited without favor for a class or ethnic origins, and promotion was solely by merit. To further uniformity, the emperor made German the compulsory language of official business throughout the Habsburg Monarchy, which affected especially the Kingdom of Hungary. The Diet of Hungary was stripped of its prerogatives, and not even called together.

As privy finance minister, Count Karl von Zinzendorf (1739–1813) introduced a uniform system of accounting for state revenues, expenditures, and debts of the territories of the Austrian crown. Austria was more successful than France in meeting regular expenditures and in gaining credit. However, the events of Joseph II&#x27;s last years also suggest that the government was financially vulnerable to the European wars that ensued after 1792.

The Emperor also attempted to simplify the administration of his dominions, often a patchwork of states united in personal union by the Habsburg monarch. As an example, in 1786 he abolished the separate administration of the Duchy of Mantua, merging it with the neighbouring Duchy of Milan. Local opposition to the change forced his successor Leopold II to reverse this measure and restore the duchy in 1791.

===Legal reform===
The busy Joseph inspired a complete reform of the legal system, abolished brutal punishments and the death penalty in most instances, and imposed the principle of complete equality of treatment for all offenders. He lightened censorship of the press and theatre.

In 1781–1782, he extended full legal freedom to serfs. Rentals paid by peasants were to be regulated by officials of the crown and taxes were levied upon all income derived from land. The landlords, however, found their economic position threatened, and eventually reversed the policy. Indeed, in Hungary and Transylvania, the resistance of the magnates was such that Joseph had to content himself for a while with halfway measures. Of the five million Hungarians, 40,000 were nobles, of whom 4,000 were magnates who owned and ruled the land; most of the remainder were serfs legally tied to particular estates.

After the collapse of the peasant revolt of Horea, 1784–1785, in which over a hundred nobles were killed, the emperor acted. His Imperial Patent of 1785 abolished serfdom but did not give the peasants ownership of the land or freedom from dues owed to the landowning nobles. It did give them personal freedom. Emancipation of the peasants from the Kingdom of Hungary promoted the growth of a new class of taxable landholders, but it did not abolish the deep-seated ills of feudalism and the exploitation of the landless squatters. Feudalism in the Habsburg monarchy finally ended in 1848.

To equalize the incidence of taxation, Joseph caused an appraisal of all the lands of the Habsburg monarchy to be made so that he might impose a single and egalitarian tax on land. The goal was to modernize the relationship of dependence between the landowners and peasantry, relieve some of the tax burden on the peasantry, and increase state revenues. Joseph looked on the tax and land reforms as being interconnected and strove to implement them at the same time.

The various commissions he established to formulate and carry out the reforms met resistance among the nobility, the peasantry, and some officials. Most of the reforms were abrogated shortly before or after Joseph&#x27;s death in 1790; they were doomed to failure from the start because they tried to change too much in too short a time, and tried to radically alter the traditional customs and relationships that the villagers had long depended upon.

In the cities, the new economic principles of the Enlightenment called for the destruction of the autonomous guilds, already weakened during the age of mercantilism. Joseph II&#x27;s tax reforms and the institution of Katastralgemeinde (tax districts for the large estates) served this purpose, and new factory privileges ended guild rights while customs laws aimed at economic unity. Physiocratic influence also led to the inclusion of agriculture in these reforms.

===Education and medicine===
To produce a literate citizenry, elementary education was made compulsory for all boys and girls, and higher education on practical lines was offered for a select few. Joseph created scholarships for talented poor students and allowed the establishment of schools for Jews and other religious minorities. In 1784 he ordered that the country change its language of instruction from Latin to German, a highly controversial step in a multilingual empire.

By the 18th century, centralization was the trend in medicine because more and better-educated doctors were requesting improved facilities. Cities lacked the budgets to fund local hospitals, and the monarchy wanted to end costly epidemics and quarantines. Joseph attempted to centralize medical care in Vienna through the construction of a single, large hospital, the famous Allgemeines Krankenhaus, which opened in 1784. Centralization worsened sanitation problems, causing epidemics and a 20% death rate in the new hospital; the city nevertheless became preeminent in the medical field in the next century.

===Religion===
Joseph&#x27;s policy of religious &quot;toleration&quot; was the most aggressive of any state in Europe. Probably the most unpopular of all his reforms was his attempted modernization of the highly traditional Catholic Church, which in medieval times had helped establish the Holy Roman Empire beginning with Charlemagne. Calling himself the guardian of Catholicism, Joseph II struck vigorously at papal power. He tried to make the Catholic Church in his territories the tool of the state, independent of Rome. Clergymen were deprived of the tithe and ordered to study in seminaries under government supervision, while bishops had to take a formal oath of loyalty to the crown. He financed the large increase in bishoprics, parishes, and secular clergy by extensive sales of monastic lands.

As a man of the Enlightenment he ridiculed the contemplative monastic orders, which he considered unproductive. Accordingly, he suppressed a third of the monasteries (over 700 were closed) and reduced the number of monks and nuns from 65,000 to 27,000. The Church&#x27;s ecclesiastical tribunals were abolished and marriage was defined as a civil contract outside the jurisdiction of the Church.

Joseph sharply cut the number of holy days to be observed in the Habsburg monarchy and ordered ornamentation in churches to be reduced. He forcibly simplified the manner in which the Mass (the central Catholic act of worship) was celebrated. Opponents of the reforms blamed them for revealing Protestant tendencies, with the rise of Enlightenment rationalism and the emergence of a liberal class of bourgeois officials. Anti-clericalism emerged and persisted, while the traditional Catholics were energized in opposition to the emperor.

Joseph&#x27;s Patent of Toleration in 1781 was a major shift away from the inquisitive religious policies of the Counter Reformation that were previously predominant in the monarchy. Limited religious freedom of worship was given to major non-Catholic Christian sects, although conversion from Catholicism was still restricted. This was followed by the Edict of Tolerance in 1782, removing many restrictions and regulations on Jews.

The Secularization Decree issued on 12 January 1782 banned several monastic orders not involved in teaching or healing and liquidated 140 monasteries (home to 1484 monks and 190 nuns). The banned monastic orders: Jesuits, Camaldolese, Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, Carmelites, Carthusians, Poor Clares, Order of Saint Benedict, Cistercians, Dominican Order (Order of Preachers), Franciscans, Pauline Fathers and Premonstratensians, and their wealth was taken over by the Religious Fund.

His anticlerical and liberal innovations induced Pope Pius VI to pay him a visit in March 1782. Joseph received the Pope politely and showed himself a good Catholic, but refused to be influenced. On the other hand, Joseph was very friendly to Freemasonry, as he found it highly compatible with his own Enlightenment philosophy, although he apparently never joined a Lodge himself. Freemasonry attracted many anticlericals and was condemned by the Church.

Joseph&#x27;s feelings towards religion are reflected in a witticism he once spoke in Paris. While being given a tour of the Sorbonne&#x27;s library, the archivist took Joseph to a dark room containing religious documents and lamented the lack of light which prevented Joseph from being able to read them. Joseph put the man at rest by saying &quot;Ah, when it comes to theology, there is never much light.&quot; Thus, Joseph was undoubtedly a much laxer Catholic than his mother.

In 1789 he issued a charter of religious toleration for the Jews of Galicia, a region with a large Yiddish-speaking traditional Jewish population. The charter abolished communal autonomy whereby the Jews controlled their internal affairs; it promoted Germanization and the wearing of non-Jewish clothing.

===Foreign policy===
The Habsburg Empire also had a policy of war, expansion, colonization and trade as well as exporting intellectual influences. While opposing Prussia and Turkey, Austria maintained its defensive alliance with France and was friendly to Russia though trying to remove the Danubian Principalities from Russian influence. Mayer argues that Joseph was an excessively belligerent, expansionist leader, who sought to make the Habsburg monarchy the greatest of the European powers. His main goal was to acquire Bavaria, if necessary in exchange for the Austrian Netherlands, but in 1778 and again in 1785 he was thwarted by King Frederick II of Prussia, whom he feared greatly; on the second occasion, a number of other German princes, wary of Joseph&#x27;s designs on their lands, joined Frederick&#x27;s side.

Joseph&#x27;s travels through Russia in 1780 included a visit with the Russian empress Catherine, which started talks that would later lead to the Austro-Russian Alliance (1781), including an offensive clause to be used against the Ottomans. This was a significant diplomatic development, as it neutralised the previous Russian-Prussian alliance which had threatened the monarchy into peace during the War of the Bavarian Succession. The agreement with Russia would later lead Austria into the expensive and largely futile Austro-Turkish War (1787–1791). Joseph II travelled with only a few servants on horseback as &quot;Count Falkenstein&quot;. He preferred to stop at a regular inn—forcing Catherine II to convert a wing of her palace, cajoling her gardener to act as inn-keeper.

Joseph&#x27;s participation in the Ottoman war was reluctant, attributable not to his usual acquisitiveness, but rather to his close ties to Russia, which he saw as the necessary price to be paid for the security of his people. After initial defeats, the Austrians won a string of victories in 1789, including the capture of Belgrade, a key Turkish fortress in the Balkans. These victories however would not amount to any significant gains for the monarchy. Under the threat of Prussian intervention and with the worrying state of the revolution in France, the Treaty of Sistova of 1791 ended the war with only token gains.

The Balkan policy of both Maria Theresa and Joseph II reflected the Cameralism promoted by Prince Kaunitz, stressing consolidation of the borderlands by reorganization and expansion of the Military Frontier. Transylvania was incorporated into the frontier in 1761 and the frontier regiments became the backbone of the military order, with the regimental commander exercising military and civilian power. &quot;Populationistik&quot; was the prevailing theory of colonization, which measured prosperity in terms of labor. Joseph II also stressed economic development. Habsburg influence was an essential factor in Balkan development in the last half of the 18th century, especially for the Serbs and Croats.

===Reaction===
Multiple interferences with old customs began to produce unrest in all parts of his dominions. Meanwhile, Joseph threw himself into a succession of foreign policies, all aimed at aggrandizement, and all equally calculated to offend his neighbors—all taken up with zeal, and dropped in discouragement. He endeavored to get rid of the Barrier Treaty, which debarred his Flemish subjects from the navigation of the Scheldt. When he was opposed by France, he turned to other schemes of alliance with the Russian Empire for the partition of the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Venice. These plans also had to be given up in the face of the opposition of neighbors, and in particular of France. Then Joseph resumed his attempts to obtain Bavaria—this time by exchanging it for the Austrian Netherlands—and only provoked the formation of the Fürstenbund, organized by Frederick II of Prussia.

Nobility throughout his empire was largely opposed to his policies on taxes and his egalitarian and despotic attitudes. In the Austrian Netherlands and Hungary everyone resented the way he tried to do away with all regional government, and to subordinate everything to his own personal rule in Vienna. The ordinary people were not happy. They loathed the Emperor&#x27;s interference in every detail of their daily lives. As it seems, Joseph was reforming the policies of the Habsburg empire based on his own criteria and personal inclinations rather than for the good of the people. From many of Joseph&#x27;s regulations, enforced by the secret police, it looked to the Austrians as though Joseph were trying to reform their characters as well as their institutions. Only a few weeks before Joseph&#x27;s death, the director of the Imperial Police reported to him: &quot;All classes, and even those who have the greatest respect for the sovereign, are discontented and indignant.&quot;

In Lombardy (in northern Italy), the cautious reforms of Maria Theresa enjoyed support from local reformers. Joseph II, however, by creating a powerful imperial officialdom directed from Vienna, undercut the dominant position of the Milanese principate and the traditions of jurisdiction and administration. In the place of provincial autonomy, he established an unlimited centralism, which reduced Lombardy politically and economically to a fringe area of the Empire. As a reaction to these radical changes, the middle-class reformers shifted away from cooperation to strong resistance. From this basis appeared the beginnings of the later Lombard liberalism.

In 1784, Joseph II attempted to make German an official language in Hungary after he had renamed the Burgtheater in Vienna the German National Theatre in 1776. Ferenc Széchényi responded by convening of a meeting and said there: &quot;We&#x27;ll see whether his patriotism also passes to the Crown.&quot; Julius Keglević responded with a letter in German to Joseph II: &quot;I write German, not because of the instruction, Your Grace, but because I have to do with a German citizen.&quot; The &quot;German citizen&quot; Joseph II let them bring the Holy Crown of Hungary to Vienna, where he gave the keys of the chest in which the Crown was locked to the Crown guards Joseph Keglević and Miklos Nádasdy. Joseph refrained from staging a coronation, that later resulted in him earning the nickname &quot;kalapos király&quot; (&quot;King with a hat&quot;) in Hungary, and Ferenc Széchényi pulled out of politics. The Austrian Civil Code, also called Joseph&#x27;s Civil Code, the predecessor of the Civil Code of Austria, which applied to all citizens equally, was published on 1 November 1786 after 10 years working on it since 1776. § 1: &quot;Every subject expects from the territorial prince security and protection, so it is the duty of the territorial prince, the rights of subjects to determine clearly and to guide the way of the actions how it is needed by universal and special prosperity.&quot; It is a clear distinction between the rights of subjects and the duties of the territorial prince and not vice versa. &quot;Territorial prince&quot; (&quot;Landesfürst&quot;) does not mean &quot;people&#x27;s prince&quot; (&quot;Volksfürst&quot;). In Hungary, there was no codified civil code until 1959. The Crown was brought back to Hungary in 1790, on this occasion the people held a mass celebration. One reason for his refusal to be crowned with the Holy Crown of Hungary might have been that Alcuin had written in a letter to Charlemagne in 798: &quot;And those people should not be listened to who keep saying the voice of the people is the voice of God, since the riotousness of the crowd is always very close to madness.&quot;

By 1790, rebellions had broken out in protest against Joseph&#x27;s reforms in the Austrian Netherlands (the Brabant Revolution) and Hungary, and his other dominions were restive under the burdens of his war with the Ottomans. His empire was threatened with dissolution, and he was forced to sacrifice some of his reform projects. On 30 January 1790, he formally withdrew all his reforms in Hungary except for three: the Patent of Toleration (1781), the abolition of serfdom (1785) and one improving the financial situation of lower-ranking priests.

==Death==
In November 1788, Joseph returned to Vienna with ruined health and was left abandoned. His minister Kaunitz refused to visit his sick-room and did not see him for two years. His brother Leopold remained in Florence. At last, Joseph, worn out and broken-hearted, recognized that his servants could not, or would not, carry out his plans.

Joseph died on 20 February 1790 from Tuberculosis. He is buried in tomb number 42 in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna. He asked that his epitaph read: &quot;Here lies a ruler who, despite his best intentions, was unsuccessful in all of his endeavors.&quot; (&quot;Hier liegt ein Fürst, der trotz der besten Meinung keiner seiner Pläne durchsetzen konnte&quot; in German original).

Joseph was succeeded by his brother Leopold II.

==Memory and legacy==
Biographer Derek Beales ranked Joseph II as one of the three great Enlightenment monarchs with Catherine the Great of Russia and Frederick the Great of Prussia.
The legacy of Josephinism would live on through the Austrian Enlightenment. To an extent, Joseph II&#x27;s enlightenment beliefs were exaggerated by the author of what Beales called the &quot;false Constantinople letters&quot;. Long considered genuine writings of Joseph II, these forged works have erroneously augmented the emperor&#x27;s memory for centuries. These legendary quotations have created a larger-than-life impression of Joseph II as a Voltaire and Diderot-like &quot;philosophe&quot;, more radical than he probably was.

In 1849, the Hungarian Declaration of Independence declared that Joseph II was not a true King of Hungary as he was never crowned, thus any act from his reign was null and void.

In 1888, Hungarian historian Henrik Marczali published a three-volume study of Joseph, the first important modern scholarly work on his reign, and the first to make systematic use of archival research. Marczali was Jewish and a product of the bourgeois-liberal school of historiography in Hungary, and he portrayed Joseph as a Liberal hero. The Russian scholar Pavel Pavlovich Mitrofanov published a thorough biography in 1907 that set the standard for a century after it was translated into German in 1910. The Mitrofanov interpretation was highly damaging to Joseph: he was not a populist emperor and his liberalism was a myth; Joseph was not inspired by the ideas of the Enlightenment but by pure power politics. He was more despot than his mother. Dogmatism and impatience were the reasons for his failures.

P. G. M. Dickson noted that Joseph II rode roughshod over age-old aristocratic privileges, liberties, and prejudices, thereby creating for himself many enemies, and they triumphed in the end. Joseph&#x27;s attempt to reform the Hungarian lands illustrates the weakness of absolutism in the face of well-defended feudal liberties. Behind his numerous reforms lay a comprehensive program influenced by the doctrines of enlightened absolutism, natural law, mercantilism, and physiocracy. With a goal of establishing a uniform legal framework to replace heterogeneous traditional structures, the reforms were guided at least implicitly by the principles of freedom and equality and were based on a conception of the state&#x27;s central legislative authority. Joseph&#x27;s accession marks a major break since the preceding reforms under Maria Theresa had not challenged these structures, but there was no similar break at the end of the Josephinian era. The reforms initiated by Joseph II were continued to varying degrees under his successor Leopold and later successors, and given an absolute and comprehensive &quot;Austrian&quot; form in the Allgemeine Bürgerliche Gesetzbuch of 1811. They have been seen as providing a foundation for subsequent reforms extending into the 20th century, handled by much better politicians than Joseph II.
The Austrian-born American scholar Saul K. Padover reached a wide American public with his colorful &quot;The Revolutionary Emperor: Joseph II of Austria&quot; (1934). Padover celebrated Joseph&#x27;s radicalism, saying his &quot;war against feudal privileges&quot; made him one of the great &quot;liberators of humanity&quot;. Joseph&#x27;s failures were attributed to his impatience and lack of tact, and his unnecessary military adventures, but despite all this Padover claimed the emperor was the greatest of all Enlightenment monarchs. While Padover depicted a sort of New Deal Democrat, Nazi historians in the 1930s made Joseph a precursor of Adolf Hitler.

A new era of historiography began in the 1960s. American Paul Bernard rejected the German national, radical, and anticlerical images of Joseph and instead emphasized long-run continuities. He argued that Joseph&#x27;s reforms were well suited to the needs of the day. Many failed because of economic backwardness and Joseph&#x27;s unfortunate foreign policy. British historian Tim Blanning stressed profound contradictions inherent in his policies that made them a failure. For example, Joseph encouraged small-scale peasant holdings, thus retarding economic modernization that only the large estates could handle. French historian Jean Berenger concludes that despite his many setbacks, Joseph&#x27;s reign &quot;represented a decisive phase in the process of the modernization of the Austrian Monarchy&quot;. The failures came because he &quot;simply wanted to do too much, too fast&quot;. Szabo concludes that by far the most important scholarship on Joseph is by Derek Beales, appearing over three decades and based on exhaustive searches in many archives. Beales looks at the emperor&#x27;s personality, with its arbitrary behavior and mixture of affability and irascibility. Beales shows that Joseph genuinely appreciated Mozart&#x27;s music and greatly admired his operas. Like most other scholars, Beales has a negative view of Joseph&#x27;s foreign policies. Beales finds that Joseph was despotic in the sense of transgressing established constitutions and rejecting sound advice, but not despotic in the sense of any gross abuse of power.

===Popular memory===
Joseph&#x27;s image in popular memory has been varied. After his death there were many monuments to him built by the central government across his lands. The first Czechoslovak Republic tore down the monuments when it became independent in 1918. While the Czechs credited Joseph II with educational reforms, religious toleration, and the easing of censorship, they condemned his policies of centralization and Germanization that they blamed for causing a decline in Czech culture.

The Budapest District of Józsefváros was named for the Emperor in 1777 and bears this name up to the present.

===Patron of the arts===
Like many of the &quot;enlightened despots&quot; of his time, Joseph was a lover and patron of the arts and is remembered as such. He was known as the &quot;Musical King&quot; and steered Austrian high culture towards a more Germanic orientation. He commissioned the German-language opera &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; from Mozart. The young Ludwig van Beethoven was commissioned to write a funeral cantata for him, but it was not performed because of its technical difficulty.

Joseph is prominently featured in Peter Shaffer&#x27;s play &quot;Amadeus&quot; and the movie based upon it. In the film version, he is portrayed by actor Jeffrey Jones as a well-meaning but somewhat befuddled monarch of limited but enthusiastic musical skill, easily manipulated by Salieri; however, Shaffer has made it clear his play is fiction in many respects and not intended to portray historical reality. Joseph was portrayed by Danny Huston in the 2006 film &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot;.

Joseph also converted Vienna&#x27;s defensive glacis into public park. The Linienwall defending Vienna&#x27;s historic center were surrounded by a ditch and glacis about 500m wide, which were kept clear of vegetation and buildings for defensive purposes. Under Joseph the ditch was filled and carriage drives and walkways were built through the glacis, and the area planted with ornamental trees and provided with lanterns and benches. This green public space persisted until the second half of the 19th century, when the Ringstrasse and its associated buildings were built there.

<doc id="148318" wikidata="Q152480" url="?curid=148318" title="Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor">
<text>Joseph I (Joseph Jacob Ignaz Johann Anton Eustachius; 26 July 1678 – 17 April 1711) was Holy Roman Emperor and ruler of the Habsburg monarchy from 1705 until his death in 1711. He was the eldest son of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor from his third wife, Eleonor Magdalene of Neuburg. Joseph was crowned King of Hungary at the age of nine in 1687 and was elected King of the Romans at the age of eleven in 1690. He succeeded to the thrones of Bohemia and the Holy Roman Empire when his father died.

Joseph continued the War of the Spanish Succession, begun by his father against Louis XIV of France, in an attempt to make his younger brother Charles (later Emperor Charles VI) King of Spain. In the process, however, owing to the victories won by his military commander, Prince Eugene of Savoy, he did succeed in establishing Austrian hegemony over Italy. Joseph also had to contend with a protracted revolt in Hungary, fomented by Louis XIV. Neither conflict was resolved until the Treaty of Utrecht, after his death.

His motto was &quot;Amore et Timore&quot; (Latin for &quot;Through Love and Fear&quot;).

==Early life==

Born in Vienna, Joseph was educated strictly by Charles Theodore, Prince of Salm, and became a good linguist. Perhaps due to the influence of his formerly Protestant tutor he was a less devout Catholic than his parents and other relatives and developed into an adherent of the early Age of Enlightenment. He had two great enthusiasms: music and hunting.

Although Joseph was the first son and child born of his parents&#x27; marriage, he was his father&#x27;s third son and seventh child. Previously, Leopold had been married to Infanta Margaret Theresa of Spain, who had given him four children, one of whom survived infancy. He then married Claudia Felicitas of Austria, who gave him two short-lived daughters. Thus, Joseph had six half-siblings. In 1684, the six-year-old Archduke had his first portrait painted by Benjamin Block. At the age of nine, on 9 December 1687, he was crowned King of Hungary; and at the age of eleven, on 23 January 1690, King of the Romans.

==Military service==
In 1702, at the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession, Joseph saw his only military service. He joined the Imperial General, Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden, in the Siege of Landau.

==Holy Roman Emperor==
Prior to his ascension, Joseph had surrounded himself with reform-hungry advisors and the young court of Vienna was ambitious in the elaboration of innovative plans. He was described as a &quot;forward-looking ruler&quot;. The large number of privy councillors was reduced and attempts were made to make the bureaucracy more efficient. Measures were taken to modernize the central bodies and a certain success was achieved in stabilizing the chronically poor Habsburg finances. Joseph also endeavoured to strengthen his position in the Holy Roman Empire – as a means of strengthening Austria’s standing as a great power. When he sought to lay claim to imperial rights in Italy and gain territories for the Habsburgs, he even risked a military conflict with the Pope over the Duchy of Mantua. Joseph I was threatened with excommunication by Pope Clement XI on 16 June 1699.

In Hungary, Joseph had inherited the kuruc rebellion from his father Leopold I: once again, nobles in Transylvania (Siebenbürgen) had risen against Habsburg rule, even advancing for a time as far as Vienna. Although Joseph was compelled to take military action, he refrained – unlike his predecessors – from seeking to teach his subjects a lesson by executing the leaders. Instead, he agreed to a compromise peace, which in the long term facilitated the integration of Hungary into the Habsburg domains. It was his good fortune to govern the Austrian dominions and to be head of the Empire, during the years in which his trusted general, Prince Eugene of Savoy, either acting alone in Italy or with the Duke of Marlborough in Germany and Flanders, was beating the armies of Louis XIV of France. During the whole of his reign, Hungary was disturbed by the conflict with Francis Rákóczi II, who eventually took refuge in the Ottoman Empire. The emperor reversed many of the authoritarian measures of his father, thus helping to placate opponents. He began the attempts to settle the question of the Austrian inheritance by a pragmatic sanction, which was continued by his brother Charles VI.

===Religious and ethnic policies===
During the Rákóczi&#x27;s rebellion (1703–1711) in the Kingdom of Hungary, Joseph&#x27;s government was also faced with various religious and ethnic challenges. Significant portion of Hungarian nobility and people belonged to the Reformed Church (Calvinists). Hoping to gain full religious freedom and equality, Hungarian Calvinists were supportive for the Rákóczi&#x27;s movement, thus forcing the imperial court in Vienna to reexamine some staunch pro-Catholic policies. In the same time, eastern and southern regions of the Kingdom were also inhabited by Eastern Orthodox Christians, mainly Serbs and Romanians. In order to secure their loyalty, Joseph issued (in 1706) official confirmation of religious liberties that were previously granted to Eastern Orthodox subjects by his father, late emperor Leopold I. In 1708, Joseph confirmed the establishment of the Metropolitanate of Krušedol. 

In 1710, Joseph extended his father&#x27;s edict of outlawry against the Romani (Gypsies) in the Habsburg lands. Per Leopold, any Romani who entered the kingdom was to be declared an outlaw by letters patent. If the same person returned to Bohemia a second time, they were to be &quot;treated with all possible severity&quot;. Joseph ordered that in the Kingdom of Bohemia they were to have their right ears cut off; in the Margraviate of Moravia, the left ear was to be cut off; in Austria, they would be branded on the back with a branding iron, representing the gallows. These mutilations were to enable the authorities to identify Romani who had been outlawed and returned. Joseph&#x27;s edict specified &quot;that all adult males were to be hanged without trial, whereas women and young males were to be flogged and banished forever.&quot; Officials who failed to enforce the edict could be fined 100 Reichsthaler. Helping Romani was punishable by a half-year&#x27;s forced labor. &quot;Mass killings&quot; of Romani were reported as a result.

==Death==
During the smallpox epidemic of 1711, which killed Louis, Grand Dauphin and three siblings of the future Emperor Francis I, Joseph became infected. He died on 17 April in the Hofburg palace. He had previously promised his wife to stop having affairs, should he survive.

The Emperor was buried in the Imperial Crypt, resting place of the majority of the Habsburgs. His funeral took place on 20 April, in tomb no. 35 in Karl&#x27;s Vault. His tomb was designed by Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt, decorated with pictures of various battles from the War of Spanish Succession. Josefstadt (the eighth district of Vienna) is named for Joseph.

==Marriage and lack of heirs==
On 24 February 1699, he married Wilhelmine Amalia of Brunswick-Lüneburg in Vienna. They had three children and their only son died of hydrocephalus before his first birthday. Joseph had a passion for love affairs (none of which resulted in illegitimate children) and he caught a sexually transmittable disease, probably syphilis, which he passed on to his wife while they were trying to produce a new heir. This incident rendered her sterile. Their father, who was still alive during these events, made Joseph and his brother Charles sign the Mutual Pact of Succession, under which Joseph&#x27;s daughters would have precedence over Charles&#x27;s daughters, in case neither fathered a son. This ruling, which made no provision for the accession of Charles&#x27;s daughter Maria Theresa, led to the War of Austrian Succession.

<text>Johann Heinrich Zedler (7 January 1706 in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland) – 21 March 1751 in Leipzig) was a bookseller and publisher. His most important achievement was the creation of a German encyclopedia, the &quot;Grosses Universal-Lexicon (Great Universal Lexicon)&quot;, 
the largest and most comprehensive German-language encyclopedia developed in the 18th century.

After training as a bookseller, Zedler founded his own publishing house in 1726. It was initially based in Freiberg, Upper Saxony, and in 1727 moved to the Publishing and Book Trade Center in Leipzig.
His first major publication was an eleven volume edition of the writings of Martin Luther published between 1729 and 1734, with an index volume published in 1740.
As the founding publisher of the &quot;Universal Lexicon&quot;, started in 1731 and during his lifetime growing to a total of 64 volumes, Zedler got into a long-standing legal dispute with the established publishers in Leipzig, whose more specialized products were threatened.

Some time before the spring of 1737, Zedler suffered a financial collapse. His business was bought by the Leipzig businessman Johann Heinrich Wolf. Wolf provided funding for Zedler to continue with the &quot;Universal Lexicon&quot; and other works he had already begun such as the &quot;General Chronicle of States, Wars, Churches and Scholarship&quot; (1733–1754, 22 volumes).
Zedler also published new works such as the trade lexicon &quot;Allgemeine Schatz-Kammer Der Kaufmannschafft&quot; (1741–1743, 4 volumes and 1 supplement volume), stock exchange laws &quot;Corpus Juris Cambialis&quot; (Johann Gottlieb Siegels, 1742, 2 volumes) and the &quot;Historical-Political-Geographical Atlas of the whole world&quot; (1744–1749, 13 volumes), published under the name of the Leipzig bookseller, Johann Samuel Heinsius the Elder.

Zedler died at the age of 45 in 1751, just a year after the conclusion of the alphabetic &quot;Universal-Lexicon&quot;. His name lives on with the colloquial name of the encyclopedia, which is known today as &quot;the Zedler&quot;.

==Early years==
Johann Heinrich Zedler was born in 1706 in Breslau, the son of a shoemaker, and presumably did not have higher secondary education – if he attended school at all.
He was an apprentice with the Breslau booksellers Brachvogel, then moved to the company of the Hamburg bookseller and publisher Theodor Christoph Felginer. In 1726 he moved to the Saxon town of Freiberg, and in September that year married Christiana Dorothea Richter (1695–1755), sister of publisher David Richter and daughter of a reputable merchant in the city, who was eleven years his elder. He used his wife&#x27;s dowry to open a bookshop in Freiberg. Zedler only stayed in Freiberg for a short time since the mining town did not provide a sufficient market for books.

==Independent bookseller and publisher in Leipzig==

===First major publishing project===
In 1727, Zedler and his wife moved to the university and trade fair city of Leipzig. That year his name appeared in a list of sixteen publishing booksellers in Leipzig.
In September, Zedler announced his first published works after moving to Leipzig.
The ad appeared just before the Leipzig Michaelmas Fair in October and was aimed at the many visitors to the city for this event.

Early in 1728 Zedler published a notice of &quot;A new enlarged and revised edition of all the German journals and Works of the Blessed Luther&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NeueZeitungengelehrtenSachen.60/63&quot;&gt;&quot;Neue Zeitungen von gelehrten Sachen&quot;, Januar 1728, S. 60 und 63.&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike the previous work by theologian Johann Gottlieb Pfeiffer, Zedler&#x27;s book did not follow a chronological sequence, but organized the material around themes.
This was the first of seven volumes of work designed for high school use.
The work was financed through Praenumeration, a common practice at the time.
Interested parties would pay for two sections in advance at the Easter Fair in 1728, with a discount, and then receive delivery at the following Michaelmas Fair in early October. Zedler offered a particularly attractive price, making reprint by other booksellers unprofitable.

Since Zedler could not expect to raise enough funds for publication in this way, he also took a loan of 2,665 thalers from his brother-in-law David Richter.
It is clear that this was a time of considerable uncertainty. Although Zedler had committed to publication on October 1728, as a precaution the year 1729 was printed on the title page.
However, he met the deadline and fourteen days before the fair announced that the book was ready and no new subscribers to the Praenumeration plan would be accepted.
Within a year Zedler had built a viable publishing business based on the success of the Luther series.

Each volume in this series, as well as those of later published works, was dedicated by Zedler to high notables according to the practice of the time. The person named in the dedicatory preface and depicted with an engraved portrait often responded with a financial gift or an honorary title. The first such title was given to Zedler by Christian, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, to whom he dedicated the first and third volumes of Luther&#x27;s writings. The Duke was an important supporter of the Protestant church and also a great hunting enthusiast.
Zedler presented the first book to the Duke in person on his birthday.

===Announcement of the Universal Lexicon===

On 26 March 1730 Zedler announced the seventh and eighth volumes of Luther&#x27;s works in the journal &quot;New Learned Works&quot;, and also announced his next project: the &quot;Great Complete Universal Lexicon of Science and Art&quot;, with the first volume to be available through Praenumeration subscriptions.

Zedler intended to summarize many previously available reference works on various fields of knowledge into a single large work of reference. The plan was a challenge to the established publishers of Leipzig.
For example, Johann Friedrich Gleditsch had published a household lexicon in 1704, and with its third edition of 1708 this had become a form of encyclopedia.
Thomas Fritsch had published the &quot;General Historical Lexicon&quot; in 1709, the German-language equivalent of &quot;Le Grand Dictionnaire historique&quot; of Louis Moréri, a multi-volume project with contributions from specialist writers and scientists.
In 1721, Johann Theodor Jablonski published a &quot;General Lexicon of Arts and Science&quot;.
A series of small reference books and dictionaries for the public completed the range.
All these works were now threatened by Zedler&#x27;s project.

The first public reaction from an established Leipzig publisher came five weeks after Zedler&#x27;s notice. Caspar Fritsch, son of Thomas Fritsch (who had died in 1726), was concerned about the effect on sales of the &quot;General Historical Lexicon&quot;, whose third edition was being prepared. He announced special pricing, and stressed the security of subscriptions to his established work.

===Bid for copyright protection===
On 13 September 1730 Zedler requested a Saxon printing privilege to protect the lexicon, which was advertised for the 1731 Easter Fair.
These national privileges typically covered a period of five to ten years, and gave the original printer protection against foreign reprints during this time.
The Leipzig Book Commission, which was responsible for granting such privileges, followed the normal process of posting an explanation of the print project and the privilege request for a week in all the bookstores of the city, during which period objections could be filed with the courts.

Both Caspar Fritsch and Johann Gottlieb Gleditsch, son of Johann Friedrich Gleditsch, raised objections.
Fritsch argued that in 1724 his father had gained the Saxon privilege for the &quot;General Historical Lexicon&quot; with a ten-year term, and said that the Universal Lexicon would not differ in content from this and other existing lexicons apart from paraphrasing.
On 16 October 1730, the Upper Consistory in Dresden agreed with the arguments of Fritsch and Gleditsch, rejected Zedler&#x27;s request, and warned that he would be subject to confiscation and a fine of 300 thalers if he reproduced any material from the &quot;General Historical Lexicon&quot; in his Universal Lexicon.
With this ruling, Zedler lost the first round in his dispute with the competing Leipzig publishers.

===Continuation of the Leipzig &quot;Publishers war&quot;===
Despite the decision of the Dresden court, Zedler continued with his project.
On 19 October 1730 he informed the Leipzig journal &quot;New Learned Works&quot; that he was still accepting further Praenumeration subscriptions, and rejected all accusations of plagiarism.
He said that the Universal-Lexicon was being written by learned and distinguished men who had no need to plagiarize, but could write the material from their own knowledge.

Zedler went on to say that he would not be deterred by envious enemies, but would bring out further important works.
This referred to his latest publishing project, a &quot;General Chronicle of States, Wars, Religion and Scholarship&quot;.
Zedler could rely on the support of Jacob August Franckenstein, a professor of natural and international law at the University of Leipzig, and was a friend of the publisher of &quot;New Learned Works&quot;, Johann Burckhardt Mencke. On 24 October 1730, Zedler sent the Council of the City of Leipzig a preprint of the proposed title page, but this time without the privilege claim.
Again, the local publishers protested, and the Leipzig Book Commission finally ordered Zedler to halt printing of the &quot;Universal Lexicon&quot; and the &quot;Chronicle&quot; and to stop advertising these works. In addition, the court ordered Zedler to print and distribute its verdict or pay a penalty of 100 thalars.
With the &quot;Universal Lexicon&quot; in jeopardy, Zedler shifted production to neighboring Prussia.
In Halle he was in contact with Johann Peter von Ludewig, a lawyer and the local University Chancellor.
Ludewig was also senior staff member of the Council for the orphanage in Halle.
Apparently he caused the orphanage to be assigned to Zedler for printing the Universal-Lexicon.
Before this started, Zedler requested a royal Prussian printing privilege, and at the same time an Imperial privilege.
He received the imperial privilege on 6 April 1731 from Charles VI, and the Prussian royal privilege only four days later.

===Completion and seizure of the first volume of the encyclopedia===
Zedler could not meet the planned Easter 1731 delivery date for the first volume of the Lexicon.
He therefore announced in an advertisement in &quot;New Learned Works&quot; on 15 April 1731 that the work would be ready for the Michaelmas Fair in October. He also announced that he was appointed and protected by the Prussian King and Elector of Brandenburg, Frederick William I.

Jacob August Franckenstein was editor of the first volume, and Johann Peter von Ludewig wrote the preface.
It is only possible to guess at other authors who contributed to this and all subsequent volumes.
Ulrich Johannes Schneider, an expert on Zedler and director of the Leipzig University Library, says that anonymity – at least at this early stage of the enterprise – was a deliberate strategy. Zedler kept the names of his employees secret to protect against lawsuits on theft of intellectual property.
In his preface to the first volume of the lexicon, von Ludewig said that the Lexicon was entirely the work of Zedler&#x27;s &quot;nine muses&quot;, and that their names would be disclosed when the work was complete.
This promise was not subsequently observed, and Schneider considers it highly questionable that there were nine authors.
In any case, Schneider says that the appearance of the first volume was the start of &quot;Europe&#x27;s largest Encyclopedia project of the 18th Century&quot;.

===Compromise, libel, renewed printing ban and exit of Franckenstein===
The local Leipzig publishers were quick to react. During the Michaelmas Fair 1731 the Leipzig Book Commission ordered the seizure of all previously printed and undelivered copies.
Zedler protested against the seizure, but the Commission maintained its verdict.
The publisher turned to the Dresden Upper Consistory and achieved a partial success.
In its decision of 14 December 1731 the court gave him permission to supply his Praenumeration subscribers with books that had been printed outside the Electorate of Saxony. This compromise allowed Zedler to continue book production, although transport added costs.

A pamphlet lampooning the &quot;charlatanism&quot; of the bookstore appeared at this time.
Almost ninety pages long, it takes the form of a dialog between two merchants at the 1731 Leipzig Michaelmas Fair.
The two men talk of the injustices of the book trade, allege that Zedler engaged in sharp practices and fraud, say that he lacks finance and accuse his authors of stupidity.
They say of Johann Peter von Ludewig that nobody knew where he obtained his title and his fortune.
Zedler&#x27;s response to this libel is not known, but on 11 February 1732 Ludewig offered a reward for discovery of the author.

Zedler&#x27;s opponents did not give up. They went back to the Upper Consistory in Dresden, and demanded payment of the penalty of 300 thalers imposed in October 1730.
On 10 March 1732 the court asked for a new report from the Leipzig Book Commission, which responded with an 87-page list of allegations of plagiarism from Zedler&#x27;s opponents. On 24 April the court ruled that Zedler must pay the fine of 300 thalers and banned him from further printing within Saxony.
On 26 October 1732 Zedler suffered another blow. Jacob August Franckenstein publicly announced that he would have no more to do with Zedler&#x27;s publications.
Two months later, on 10 May 1733, Franckenstein died.
After his death, Paul Daniel Longolius assumed the editorship of the &quot;Universal Lexicon&quot;.

===The company falters===
The spring of 1733 was marked by three events that had considerable influence on Zedler&#x27;s fate as an entrepreneur.
In February Zedler launched a monthly paperback magazine called &quot;Open Cabinet of Great Men, or the current status of all kingdoms and countries of the world&quot;.
The new journal was aimed at awakening public interest in news from the political, military and court areas.
It was a success, publishing 25 editions up to 1735, but, according to Zedler&#x27;s biographer Gerd Quedenbaum, in the long run it was not a remarkable source of revenue.
In March 1733, Zedler bought the publishing house of Johann Herbord Kloss, who had died in 1730.
Kloss had a total of 1,014 titles on offer, and in terms of volume was in the first third of the Leipzig booksellers.
However, many of these titles were scarcely marketable.
In mid-April, Zedler announced a new publication in a newspaper advertisement, a Latin-Greek-German lexicon by Andreas Reyher and Christian Juncker, edited by Johann Matthias Gesner.

In March, Zedler had optimistically advertised books from the Johann Herbord Kloss printing house.
By June, he was already preparing a sale of 10,000 bound and unbound books of the acquired inventory, with a high proportion of &quot;junk product&quot;.
The sale was arranged as an auction, held on 27 July.
There were growing indications that Zedler was in financial difficulties and had to rely on short-term gains.
On 5 October the Halle bookseller Johann Gottfried Oertel offered a catalog of books from Zedler for the upcoming Leipzig Michaelmas fair at discounts of up to 50%.

Zedler used these low prices during the first week of the fair to try to obtain cash.
The main problem was the completion of the eleventh and last volume of the Lutheran writings, whose appearance was announced at the same Michaelmas Fair of 1733. This was the end of a solid source of income. Moreover, until now the costs of the last volume had been met by Praenumeration advances on the next volume. Now the bills had to be settled.

In December 1733, Zedler introduced news on the &quot;Current State of War&quot; in his &quot;Cabinet&quot; magazine, increasing sales. But a few months later he faced competition from the Leipzig publisher Moritz Georg Weidmann with a competing magazine on news of the European states.
Just before the start of the Easter Fair of 1734, Zedler again tried to run down his inventory by low offers. At the end of 1734 he ran ads for a magazine project called &quot;News worth reading for the city and the new University of Göttingen&quot;, but it probably was never published.

===Recovery attempt: the book lottery===
In the spring of 1735 Zedler resorted to a new means to convert inventory into cash. In a specially printed brochure, he announced a book lottery. All participants would receive books, with a value equivalent to the amount they had paid, so there would be no losers. They would also get a ticket to a draw of valuable books.
The draw was to be on 18 April 1735 during the Easter fair, and would have brought new publicity to Zedler.
Zedler pledged to donate a portion of the earnings to the Leipzig orphanage.

Zedler&#x27;s opponents, led by Weidmann, opposed the scheme.
They appealed to the Leipzig town council and the Supreme Consistory in Dresden to ban the lottery.
They pointed out that Zedler&#x27;s Universal Lexicon was among the prizes, and reiterated that the ban on sales of works produced in Saxony still applied.
As Zedler received no immediate response from Dresden, he had to let the date for the draw pass.
On 28 May, he was finally told that the lottery was approved, but only on condition that the Universal-Lexicon was removed from the offer. This was probably the most attractive prize.
Added to this, one of Zedler&#x27;s competitors, Johann Christian Martini, failed and flooded the market with its stock of books.
On 3 October 1735, before the Michaelmas Fair Zedler advertised that lots were still available.
Soon after he announced a new auction of 6,521 books and 1121 engravings.

On 8 April 1736, Zedler again advertised his lottery plan through a newspaper ad. This time, however, the lots were offered at a greatly reduced price. Quedenbaum concludes that at this time Zedler was in such great financial distress was that he wanted to sell his stock of book at any price.

===Financial collapse===
The circumstances of Zedler&#x27;s financial collapse are obscure.
It is clear that after a certain point Zedler could no longer meet his payment obligations to creditors.
Albrecht Kirchhoff in his 1892 book reproduced a report dated 10 October 1738 from the Council of the City of Leipzig to the government in Dresden on the subject.
It is not known when exactly Zedler&#x27;s insolvency occurred.
Juntke writes in a paper published in 1956 that the privilege dispute had bankrupted Zedler in the spring of 1735.
Writing in 1962, Blühm agrees, saying formal bankruptcy occurred in spring of 1735.
Quedenbaum considers that the collapse probably did not occur before 1736.
Modern biographical works such as the 2003 article by Winfried Müller in &quot;Saxon biography&quot; avoid the problem by not discussing the exact date and circumstances of Zedler&#x27;s financial collapse in detail.

==Wolf, Zedler, Heinsius==

===Fresh start and the fight against pirated publications===
The financial commitment of the Leipzig businessman Johann Heinrich Wolf gave Zedler a new start.
In the &quot;Universal Lexicon&quot;, Wolf is described as a merchant with a special love of science who likes nothing better than reading good and scholarly books.
Quedenbaum thought Wolf took over further funding of Zedler because he was right in the target audience of the &quot;Universal Lexicon&quot;, and believed in continuing the work rather than in letting it cease.
There are no recorded documents such as a contract between Zedler and Wolf, so the details of the relationship are not known.

On 5 August 1737, Zedler&#x27;s imperial privilege for printing the &quot;Universal Lexicon&quot; was suspended.
Zedler said this was because of failure to deliver copies of his work due to the imperial court.
Quedenbaum considers this unlikely and suggests that the withdrawal of the imperial printing privilege was due to the influence of the book printer and publisher Johann Ernst Schultze, of the Bavarian court.
Schultze was aware of Zedler&#x27;s financial collapse, since he had been involved in printing previous volumes.
Also, Schultze had found a suitable editor with Paul Daniel Longolius, who in 1735 had been appointed rector of the school at Hof. As a former employee of Zedler, Longolius had the experience needed for publication of further volumes of the Encyclopedia. After Zedler lost the privilege he had been granted in January 1735, Schultze requested an imperial privilege in his own name, which was issued on 11 June 1738.

Schultze printed 17th and 18th volumes of the Universal-Lexicon and tried to sell them in Leipzig. To this end, he sent the imperial notary Bernhard Christian Groot from Offenbach with two journeymen printers as witnesses to the Leipzig Book Commission. The Book Commission accepted Groot but the Leipzig Council threw him out of town.
In a letter dated 10 October 1738 the council explained their decision to the State Government in Dresden, rejecting the validity of Groot&#x27;s imperial authority to publish in the city.

For Zedler this document restricting the scope of the imperial privilege was a godsend, because it secured the continuation of his lexicon. The philosophy professor Carl Günther Ludovici, a classmate of Longolius, took over as editor of the &quot;Universal Lexicon&quot; from Volume 19. Schultze stopped printing further volumes of the Universal Lexicon&#x27;s in 1745 because of financial difficulties.

===Temporary retirement===
Zedler was increasingly marginalized after the financial takeover of his publishing house by Wolf, and after Carl Günther Ludovici took over the direction of the 19th and subsequent volumes of the &quot;Universal Lexicon&quot;.
Ludovici made the bibliography at the end of each article more complete, made articles much longer and introduced biographies of living people.
Zedler seems to have also given up his own bookstore, because an advertisement for the Easter Fair of 1739, published in the &quot;New Learned Papers&quot;, said that the two most recent encyclopedia volumes were available from &quot;Wolf&#x27;s vault, Auerbach court&quot;.

Zedler began to return to private life. The article on Zedler published in 1749 in the 61st volume of the &quot;Universal Lexicon&quot; remarks that Zedler had decided on forms of employment he preferred to the trade after the acquisition of the publishing business by Wolf.
Zedler owned property in Wolfshain, one of five villages that Moritz, Duke of Saxony had given Leipzig University in 1544.
Quedenbaum characterized Zedler as &quot;impetuous&quot;, and suggested that he retired to peace in Wolfshain in order to plan new publishing projects.
However, he needed to publish under a new name to avoid past associations.

===New publishing projects with Heinsius===
In 1740 a number of Zedler&#x27;s products appeared under the name of the Leipzig bookseller and publisher Johann Samuel Heinsius.
This began with a relaunch of Zedler&#x27;s Cabinet magazine, under a slightly altered title. It is not known how successful the new magazine was, or why Heinsius included it in his publishing program since from 1739 he already had a similar monthly magazine under the title of &quot;Genealogical and historical messages of the principal events of the European courts&quot;.

In 1741 there followed the first volume of the &quot;General Treasure Chamber&quot;, a four volume commercial lexicon translated by Ludovici from the &quot;Dictionnaire Universel de Commerce (General Commercial Dictionary)&quot; by Jacques Savary des Brûlons.
The fourth volume was delivered as early as 1742, covering the letters &quot;S&quot; to &quot;Z&quot;.
A year later, a supplementary volume was produced with additions and an index.
A final part of the work advertised under the title &quot;Merchants now living in and outside Germany&quot; did not appear.

Zedler&#x27;s next publishing project was the &quot;Corpus Juris Cambialis (Stock Exchange Laws)&quot; of Johann Gottlieb Siegel.
Heinsius advertised the two-volume publication in the newspapers in April 1742, seeking Praenumeration subscribers. Both volumes were ready in time for the Leipzig Michaelmas Fair that year, as were the 33rd and 34th volumes of the &quot;Universal Lexicon&quot;. The 12th volume of the &quot;General state, War, Church and Scholarly History&quot; under the auspices of Wolf also appeared at this, with content up to 1700.

After the &quot;Treasury Board&quot; and the &quot;Corpus Juris Cambialis&quot;, Zedler again began a major publishing project.
The basis for Heinsius&#x27;s &quot;Historical and Political-Geographic Atlas of the whole world&quot; was a translation of the &quot;Grand Dictionnaire Géographique Et Critique&quot; of Antoine-Augustin Bruzen de La Martinière. The German version ran to 13 volumes, published by Heinsius between 1744 and 1749.

==Last years and death==
Zedler probably created, or at least initiated further work. The &quot;Universal Lexicon&quot; article on Zedler published in 1749 says &quot;he has several large works that are already being printed and should still come out&quot;.
The influence of Zedler on further publishing projects is no longer detectable.
In the years up to 1751 the work of Wolf appears under or with the name of Heinsius.
For each Easter and Michaelmas Fair the firm published two volumes of the &quot;Universal Lexicon&quot;, and at each of the Easter Fairs it published a volume of the &quot;General state, war, religious and scholarly chronicle&quot;.
The alphabetical volumes of the &quot;Universal Lexicon&quot; up to 1750 were completed in this way.
Ludovici later expanded the &quot;Universal Lexicon&quot; by four supplementary volumes.

Zedler spent most of his last years on his estate near Leipzig.
The &quot;Universal Lexicon&quot; article on Zedler said that nevertheless he continued to provide useful advice to the firm.
Zedler&#x27;s sponsor Johann Peter von Ludewig had died in September 1743. Heinsius died in December 1750, and his company became known as &quot;Johann Samuel Heinsius heirs&quot;. On 21 March 1751 Zedler also died, as recorded in the grave register of Leipzig.
His widow Christiana Dorothea left Leipzig in 1754 and moved back to Freiberg. She died soon after on 18 November 1755.
Her marriage to Zedler remained childless.

<doc id="148328" wikidata="Q173637" url="?curid=148328" title="Ice Cube">
<text>O&#x27;Shea Jackson Sr. (born June 15, 1969), known as Ice Cube, is an American rapper, songwriter, actor, and film producer. His lyrics on N.W.A&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; contributed to gangsta rap&#x27;s widespread popularity, and his political rap solo albums &quot;AmeriKKKa&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; (1990), &quot;Death Certificate&quot; (1991), and &quot;The Predator&quot; (1992) were all critically and commercially successful. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of N.W.A in 2016.

A native of Los Angeles, Ice Cube formed his first rap group called C.I.A. in 1986. In 1987, with Eazy-E and Dr. Dre, he formed the gangsta rap group N.W.A. As its lead rapper, he wrote some of Dre&#x27;s and most of Eazy&#x27;s lyrics on &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;, a landmark album that shaped West Coast hip hop&#x27;s early identity and helped differentiate it from East Coast rap. N.W.A was also known for their violent lyrics, threatening to attack abusive police which stirred controversy. After a monetary dispute over the group&#x27;s management by Eazy-E and Jerry Heller, Cube left N.W.A in late 1989, teaming with New York artists and launching a solo rap career.

Ice Cube has also had an active film career since the early 1990s. He entered cinema by playing Doughboy in director John Singleton&#x27;s feature debut &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot;, a 1991 drama named after a 1987 rap song that Ice Cube wrote. He also co-wrote and starred in the 1995 comedy film &quot;Friday&quot;, which spawned a successful franchise and reshaped his public image into a bankable movie star. He made his directorial debut with the 1998 film &quot;The Players Club&quot;, and also produced and curated the film&#x27;s accompanying soundtrack. As of 2020, he has appeared in about 40 films, including the 1999 war comedy &quot;Three Kings&quot;, family comedies like the &quot;Barbershop&quot; series, and buddy cop comedies &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;, &quot;22 Jump Street&quot;, and &quot;Ride Along&quot;. He was an executive producer of many of these films, as well as of the 2015 biopic &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;.

==Early life==

O&#x27;Shea Jackson was born in Los Angeles on June 15, 1969, to hospital clerk and custodian Doris and machinist and UCLA groundskeeper Hosea Jackson. He has an older brother, and they had a half-sister who was murdered when Cube was 12. He is a cousin of fellow rappers Del tha Funky Homosapien and Kam. He grew up on Van Wick Street in the Westmont section of South Los Angeles. In ninth grade at George Washington Preparatory High School in Los Angeles, Cube began writing raps after being challenged by his friend &quot;Kiddo&quot; in typewriting class. Kiddo lost. He has said that his stage name came from his older brother, who &quot;threatened to slam [him] into a freezer and pull [him] out when [he] was an ice cube&quot;.

Cube also attended William Howard Taft High School in the Woodland Hills area of Los Angeles. He was bused to the suburban school from his home in a high-crime neighborhood. In the fall of 1987, soon after he wrote and recorded a few locally successful rap songs with N.W.A, he enrolled at the Phoenix Institute of Technology Phoenix, Arizona. In 1988, with a diploma in architectural drafting, he returned to Los Angeles and rejoined N.W.A, but kept a career in architecture drafting as a backup plan.

==Music career==
===Early work===
In 1986, at the age of 16, Ice Cube began rapping in the trio C.I.A. but soon joined the newly formed rap group N.W.A. He was N.W.A&#x27;s lead rapper and main ghostwriter on its official debut album, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;. Due to a financial dispute, he left the group by the start of 1990. During 1990, his debut solo album, &quot;AmeriKKKa&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, found him also leading a featured rap group, Da Lench Mob. Meanwhile, he helped develop the rapper Yo Yo.

===1986: C.I.A.===
With friend Sir Jinx, Ice Cube formed the rap group C.I.A., and performed at parties hosted by Dr. Dre. Since 1984, Dre was a member of a popular DJ crew, the World Class Wreckin&#x27; Cru, which by 1985 was also performing and recording electro rap. Dre had Cube help write the Wreckin Cru&#x27;s hit song &quot;Cabbage Patch&quot;. Dre also joined Cube on a side project, a duo called Stereo Crew, which made a 12-inch record, &quot;She&#x27;s a Skag&quot;, released on Epic Records in 1986.

In 1987, C.I.A. released the Dr. Dre-produced single &quot;My Posse&quot;. Meanwhile, the Wreckin&#x27; Cru&#x27;s home base was the Eve After Dark nightclub, about a quarter of a mile outside of the city of Compton in Los Angeles County. While Dre was on the turntable, Ice Cube would rap, often parodying other artists&#x27; songs. In one instance, Cube&#x27;s rendition was &quot;My Penis&quot;, parodying Run-DMC&#x27;s &quot;My Adidas&quot;. In 2015, the nightclub&#x27;s co-owner and Wreckin&#x27; leader Alonzo Williams would recall feeling his reputation damaged by this and asking it not to be repeated.

===1986–1989: N.W.A.===
At 16, Cube sold his first song to Eric Wright, soon dubbed Eazy-E, who was forming Ruthless Records and the musical team N.W.A, based in Compton, California. Himself from South Central Los Angeles, Cube would be N.W.A&#x27;s only core member not born in Compton.

Upon the success of the song &quot;Boyz-n-the-Hood&quot;—written by Cube, produced by Dre, and rapped by Eazy-E, helping establish gangsta rap in California—Eazy focused on developing N.W.A, which soon gained MC Ren. Cube wrote some of Dre&#x27;s and nearly all of Eazy&#x27;s lyrics on N.W.A&#x27;s official debut album, &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;, released in January 1989. Yet by the end of the year, Cube questioned his compensation and N.W.A&#x27;s management by Jerry Heller.

Cube also wrote most of Eazy-E&#x27;s debut album &quot;Eazy-Duz-It&quot;. He received a total pay of $32,000, and the contract that Heller presented in 1989 did not confirm that he was officially an N.W.A member. After leaving the group and its label in December, Cube sued Heller, and the lawsuit was later settled out of court. In response, N.W.A members attacked Cube on the 1990 EP &quot;100 Miles and Runnin&#x27;&quot;, and on N.W.A&#x27;s next and final album, &quot;Niggaz4Life&quot;, in 1991.

===1989–1993: Early solo career, &quot;AmeriKKKa&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, &quot;Death Certificate&quot;, and &quot;The Predator&quot;===
In early 1990, Ice Cube recorded his debut solo album, &quot;AmeriKKKa&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, in New York with iconic rap group Public Enemy&#x27;s production team, the Bomb Squad. Arriving in May 1990, it was an instant hit, further swelling rap&#x27;s mainstream integration. Controversial nonetheless, it drew accusations of misogyny and racism. The album introduces Ice Cube&#x27;s affirmation of black nationalism and ideology of black struggle.

Cube appointed Yo-Yo, a female rapper and guest on the album, to be the head of his record label, and helped produce her debut album, &quot;Make Way for the Motherlode&quot;. Also in 1990, Cube followed up with an EP—&quot;Kill At Will&quot;—critically acclaimed, and rap&#x27;s first EP certified Platinum.

His second album &quot;Death Certificate&quot; was released in 1991. The album was thought to be more focused, yet even more controversial, triggering accusations of anti-white, antisemitic, and misogynistic content. The album was split into two themes: the Death Side, &quot;a vision of where we are today&quot;, and the Life Side, &quot;a vision of where we need to go&quot;. The track &quot;No Vaseline&quot; scathingly retorts insults directed at him by N.W.A&#x27;s 1990 EP and 1991 album, which call him a traitor. Besides calling for hanging Eazy-E as a &quot;house nigga&quot;, the track blames N.W.A&#x27;s manager Jerry Heller for exploiting the group, mentions that he is a Jew, and calls for his murder. Ice Cube contended that he mentioned Heller&#x27;s ethnicity merely incidentally, not to premise attack, but as news media mention nonwhite assailants&#x27; races. The track &quot;Black Korea&quot;, also deemed racist, was also thought as foreseeing the 1992 Los Angeles riots. While controversial, &quot;Death Certificate&quot; broadened his audience; he toured with Lollapalooza in 1992.
Cube&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Predator&quot;, was released in November 1992. Referring to the 1992 Los Angeles riots, the song &quot;Wicked&quot; opens, &quot;April 29 was power to the people, and we might just see a sequel.&quot; &quot;The Predator&quot; was the first album ever to debut at No. 1 on both the R&amp;B/hip-hop and pop charts. Singles include &quot;It Was a Good Day&quot; and &quot;Check Yo Self&quot;, songs having a &quot;two-part&quot; music video. Generally drawing critical praise, the album is his most successful commercially, over three million copies sold in the US. After this album, Cube&#x27;s rap audience severely diminished, and never regained the prominence of his first three albums.

During this time, Cube began to have numerous features on other artists&#x27; songs. In 1992, Cube appeared on Del the Funky Homosapien&#x27;s debut album &quot;I Wish My Brother George Was Here&quot;, on Da Lench Mob&#x27;s debut &quot;Guerillas in tha Mist&quot;, which he also produced, and on the Kool G Rap and DJ Polo song &quot;Two to the Head&quot;. In 1993, he worked on Kam&#x27;s debut album, and collaborated with Ice-T on the track &quot;Last Wordz&quot; on 2Pac&#x27;s album &quot;Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.&quot;.

===1993–1998: &quot;Lethal Injection&quot; and forming Westside Connection===
Cube&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Lethal Injection&quot;, came out in late 1993. Here, Cube borrowed from the then-popular G-funk popularized by Dr. Dre. Although not received well by critics, the album brought successful singles, including &quot;Really Doe&quot;, &quot;Bop Gun (One Nation)&quot;, &quot;You Know How We Do It&quot;, and &quot;What Can I Do?&quot; After this album, Ice Cube effectively lost his rap audience.

Following &quot;Lethal Injection&quot;, Cube focused on films and producing albums of other rappers, including Da Lench Mob, Mack 10, Mr. Short Khop, and Kausion. In 1994, Cube teamed with onetime N.W.A groupmate Dr. Dre, who was then leading rap&#x27;s G-funk subgenre, for the first time since Cube had left the group, and which had disbanded upon Dre&#x27;s 1991 departure. The result was the Cube and Dre song &quot;Natural Born Killaz&quot;, on the &quot;Murder Was The Case&quot; soundtrack, released by Dre&#x27;s then-new label, Death Row Records.

In 1995, Cube joined Mack 10 and WC in forming a side trio, the Westside Connection. Feeling neglected by East Coast media, a longstanding issue in rap&#x27;s bicoastal rivalry, the group aimed to reinforce West pride and resonate with the undervalued. The Westside Connection&#x27;s first album, &quot;Bow Down&quot; (1996), featured tracks like &quot;Bow Down&quot; and &quot;Gangstas Make the World Go &#x27;Round&quot; that reflected the group&#x27;s objectives. The album was certified Platinum by year&#x27;s end. Interpreting rapper Common&#x27;s song &quot;I Used to Love H.E.R.&quot; as a diss of West Coast rap, Cube and the Westside Connection briefly feuded with him, but they resolved amicably in 1997.

It was also at this time that Cube began collaborating outside the rap genre. In 1997, he worked with David Bowie and Nine Inch Nails singer Trent Reznor on a remix of Bowie&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Americans&quot;. In 1998, Cube was featured on the band Korn&#x27;s song &quot;Children of the Korn&quot;, and joined them on their Family Values Tour 1998.

===1998–2006: &quot;War &amp; Peace Vol. 1 &amp; 2&quot; and Westside Connection reunion===
In November 1998, Cube released his long-awaited fifth solo album &quot;War &amp; Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc)&quot;. The delayed sixth album, &quot;Volume 2&quot;, arrived in 2000. These albums feature the Westside Connection and a reunion with his old N.W.A members Dr. Dre and MC Ren. Cube also received a return favor from Korn, as they appeared on his song &quot;Fuck Dying&quot; from &quot;Vol. 1&quot;. Many fans maintained that these two albums, especially the second, were lesser in quality to his earlier work. In 2000, Cube also joined Dr. Dre, Eminem, and Snoop Dogg for the Up in Smoke Tour.

In 2002, Cube appeared on British DJ Paul Oakenfold&#x27;s solo debut album, &quot;Bunkka&quot;, on the track &quot;Get Em Up&quot;.

Released in 2003, Westside Connection&#x27;s second album, &quot;Terrorist Threats&quot;, fared well critically, but saw lesser sales. &quot;Gangsta Nation&quot; (featuring Nate Dogg), the only single released, was a radio hit. After a rift between Cube and Mack 10 about Cube&#x27;s film work minimizing the group&#x27;s touring, the Westside Connection disbanded in 2005.

In 2004, Cube featured on the song &quot;Real Nigga Roll Call&quot; by Lil Jon &amp; the East Side Boyz, the then leaders of rap&#x27;s crunk subgenre.

===2006–2012: &quot;Laugh Now, Cry Later&quot;, &quot;Raw Footage&quot;, and &quot;I Am the West&quot;===
In 2006, Cube released his seventh solo album, &quot;Laugh Now, Cry Later&quot;, selling 144,000 units in the first week. Lil Jon and Scott Storch produced the lead single, &quot;Why We Thugs&quot;. In October, Ice Cube was honored at VH1&#x27;s Annual Hip Hop Honors, and performed it and also the track &quot;Go to Church&quot;. Cube soon toured globally in the Straight Outta Compton Tour—accompanied by rapper WC from the Westside Connection—playing in America, Europe, Australia, and Japan.

Amid Cube&#x27;s many features and brief collaborations, September 2007 brought &quot;In the Movies&quot;, a compilation album of Ice Cube songs on soundtracks.

Cube&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Raw Footage&quot;, arrived on August 19, 2008, yielding the singles &quot;Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It&quot; and &quot;Do Ya Thang&quot;. Also in 2008, Cube helped on Tech N9ne&#x27;s song &quot;Blackboy&quot;, and was featured on The Game&#x27;s song &quot;State of Emergency&quot;.

As a fan of the NFL football team the Raiders, Cube released in October 2009 a tribute song, &quot;Raider Nation&quot;. In 2009, Ice Cube performed at the Gathering of the Juggalos, and returned to perform at the 2011 festival.
On September 28, 2010, his ninth solo album, &quot;I Am the West&quot;, arrived with, Cube says, a direction different from any one of his other albums. Its producers include West Coast veterans like DJ Quik, Dr. Dre, E-A-Ski, and, after nearly 20 years, again Cube&#x27;s onetime C.I.A groupmate Sir Jinx. Offering the single &quot;I Rep That West&quot;, the album debuted at #22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold 22,000 copies in its first week. Also in 2010, Cube signed up-and-coming recording artist named 7Tre The Ghost, deemed likely to be either skipped or given the cookie-cutter treatment by most record companies.

In 2011, Cube featured on Daz Dillinger&#x27;s song &quot;Iz You Ready to Die&quot; and on DJ Quik&#x27;s song &quot;Boogie Till You Conk Out&quot;.

In 2012, Ice Cube recorded a verse for a remix of the Insane Clown Posse song &quot;Chris Benoit&quot;, from ICP&#x27;s &quot;The Mighty Death Pop!&quot; album, appearing on the album &quot;Mike E. Clark&#x27;s Extra Pop Emporium&quot;.

In September 2012, during Pepsi&#x27;s NFL Anthems campaign, Cube released his second Raiders anthem &quot;Come and Get It&quot;.

===2012–present: &quot;Everythang&#x27;s Corrupt&quot;, Mount Westmore and &quot;Man Down&quot;===
In November 2012, Cube released more details on his forthcoming, tenth studio album, &quot;Everythang&#x27;s Corrupt&quot;. Releasing its title track near the 2012 elections, he added, &quot;You know, this record is for the political heads.&quot; But the album&#x27;s release was delayed. On February 10, 2014, iTunes brought another single from it, &quot;Sic Them Youngins on &#x27;Em&quot;, and a music video followed the next day. Despite a couple of more song releases, the album&#x27;s release was delayed even beyond Cube&#x27;s work on the 2015 film &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;. After a statement setting release to 2017, the album finally arrived on December 7, 2018.

In 2014, Cube appeared on MC Ren&#x27;s remix &quot;Rebel Music&quot;, their first collaboration since the N.W.A reunion in 2000.

In 2020, Cube joined rappers Snoop Dogg, E-40, Too Short and formed the supergroup Mt. Westmore. The group&#x27;s debut album was released on June 7, 2022.

Throughout early 2024, Ice Cube is set to tour across Canada as part of his Straight Into Canada tour.

Ice Cube&#x27;s eleventh studio album and his first new album in six years, &quot;Man Down&quot;, was released on November 22, 2024. The album was preceded by the singles &quot;It&#x27;s My Ego&quot;, &quot;Ego Maniacs (featuring Busta Rhymes and Killer Mike)&quot; and &quot;So Sensitive&quot;.

==Film and television career==
Since 1991, Ice Cube has acted in nearly 40 films, several of which are highly regarded. Some of them, such as the 1992 thriller &quot;Trespass&quot; and the 1999 war comedy &quot;Three Kings&quot;, highlight action. Yet most are comedies, including a few adult-oriented ones, like the &quot;Friday&quot; franchise, whereas most of these are family-friendly, like the &quot;Barbershop&quot; franchise.

===Narrative===
John Singleton&#x27;s seminal film &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot;, released in July 1991, debuted the actor Ice Cube playing Doughboy, a persona that Cube played convincingly. Later, Cube starred with Ice-T and Bill Paxton in Walter Hill&#x27;s 1992 thriller film &quot;Trespass&quot;, and in Charles Burnett&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;The Glass Shield&quot;. Meanwhile, Cube declined to costar with Janet Jackson in Singleton&#x27;s 1993 romance &quot;Poetic Justice&quot;, a role that Tupac Shakur then played.

Cube starred as the university student Fudge in Singleton&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Higher Learning&quot;. Singleton, encouraging Cube, had reportedly told him, &quot;If you can write a record, you can write a movie.&quot; Cube cowrote the screenplay for the 1995 comedy &quot;Friday&quot;, based on adult themes, and starred in it with comedian Chris Tucker. Made with $3.5 million, &quot;Friday&quot; drew $28 million worldwide. Two sequels, &quot;Next Friday&quot; and &quot;Friday After Next&quot;, were respectively released in 2000 and 2002.

In 1997, playing a South African exiled to America who returns 15 years later, Cube starred in the action thriller &quot;Dangerous Ground&quot;, and had a supporting role in &quot;Anaconda&quot;. In 1998, writing again, the director Ice Cube debuted in &quot;The Players Club&quot;. In 1999, he starred alongside George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg as a staff sergeant in &quot;Three Kings&quot;, set in the immediate aftermath of the Gulf War, whereby the United States attacked Iraq in 1990, an &quot;intelligent&quot; war comedy critically acclaimed. In 2002, Cube starred in Kevin Bray&#x27;s &quot;All About the Benjamins&quot;, and in Tim Story&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Barbershop&quot;.

In 2004, Cube played in &quot;Barbershop 2&quot; and &quot;Torque&quot;. The next year, he replaced Vin Diesel in the second installment of the &quot;XXX&quot; film series, &quot;&quot;, as the main protagonist, which he reprises the character in the third installment and reunited with Diesel 12 years later, &quot;&quot;. He also appeared in the family comedy &quot;Are We There Yet?&quot;, which premised his role in its 2007 sequel &quot;Are We Done Yet?&quot;. In 2012, Cube appeared in &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;. He also appeared in its sequel, &quot;22 Jump Street&quot;, in 2014. That year, and then to return in 2016, he played alongside comedian Kevin Hart in two more Tim Story films, &quot;Ride Along&quot; and &quot;Ride Along 2&quot;. Also in 2016, Cube returned for the . And in 2017, Cube starred with Charlie Day in the comedy &quot;Fist Fight&quot;.

In October 2021, Ice Cube was set to star in the comedy film &quot;Oh Hell No&quot; (now titled &quot;Stepdude&quot;) alongside Jack Black, but left the project after refusing to get vaccinated for COVID-19. The project would have paid him $9 million.

===Documentary===
In late 2005, Ice Cube and R. J. Cutler co-created the six-part documentary series &quot;Black. White.&quot;, carried by cable network FX.

Ice Cube and basketball star LeBron James paired up to pitch a one-hour special to ABC based on James&#x27;s life.

On May 11, 2010, ESPN aired Cube&#x27;s directed documentary &quot;Straight Outta L.A.&quot;, examining the interplay of Los Angeles sociopolitics, hip hop, and the Raiders during the 1980s into the 1990s.

===Serial television===
Ice Cube&#x27;s &quot;Are We There Yet?&quot; series premiered on TBS on June 2, 2010. It revolves around a family adjusting to the matriarch&#x27;s new husband, played by Terry Crews. On August 16, the show was renewed for 90 more episodes, amounting to six seasons. Cube also credits Tyler Perry for his entrée to TBS. In front of the television cameras, rather, Cube appeared with Elmo as a 2014 guest on the PBS children&#x27;s show &quot;Sesame Street.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1990, a musical associate in the rap group Public Enemy introduced Cube to the Nation of Islam (NOI). He converted to Islam, though he denied membership in the NOI, whose ideology against white people and especially Jews led to its categorization as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. However, he readily adopted the group&#x27;s ideology of black nationalism, a concept familiar to the hip hop community. He nevertheless has claimed to listen to his own conscience as a &quot;natural Muslim&quot;, claiming to do so because &quot;it&#x27;s just [him] and God&quot;. In 2012, he expressed support for same-sex marriage. In 2017, he said that he thinks &quot;religion is stupid&quot; in part and explained, &quot;I&#x27;m gonna live a long life, and I might change religions three or four times before I die. I&#x27;m on the Islam tip—but I&#x27;m on the Christian tip, too. I&#x27;m on the Buddhist tip as well. Everyone has something to offer to the world.&quot;

Ice Cube has been married to Kimberly Woodruff since April 26, 1992. They have four children together; their oldest son O&#x27;Shea Jackson Jr. (born 1991) portrayed him in the film &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;. When asked about the balance between his music and parenting in 2005, Cube discussed teaching his children to question the value of violence depicted in all media, not just song lyrics. Through his son O&#x27;Shea Jackson Jr. Ice Cube is a grandfather.

In 2017, he launched Big3, a 3-on-3 basketball league starring former NBA players. Ice Cube is a notable fan of the Las Vegas Raiders, originally supporting the team during their tenure in Los Angeles from 1982 to 1994. NWA&#x27;s use of Raiders&#x27; memorabilia in conjunction with the team&#x27;s historically intimidating presence, helped to further popularized an image for the team in hip-hop culture for years to come. Ice Cube is also a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers of the MLB, performing a pregame show before game 2 of the 2024 World Series and later at the team&#x27;s World Series win celebration at Dodger Stadium, and has equally been a devout fan of the Los Angeles Lakers.

=== Conspiracy theories and antisemitism ===
At a 1991 press conference promoting his album &quot;Death Certificate&quot;, Cube endorsed the Nation of Islam&#x27;s pseudo-scholarly book &quot;The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews&quot;, which falsely claims that European Jews dominated the Atlantic slave trade. &quot;Death Certificate&quot; also contains the song &quot;No Vaseline&quot;, which uses racial slurs against the other former members of N.W.A and refers to the group&#x27;s manager Jerry Heller as &quot;&quot; and &quot;cracker&quot;.

In response to accusations of racism and anti-Semitism, Cube said in 2008, &quot;I ain&#x27;t got time to be fuckin&#x27; anti-Semitic, anti-this, anti-that, anti-Korean. I ain&#x27;t got time for that shit. I&#x27;m too busy bein&#x27; pro-black, you know what I&#x27;m saying?&quot; In 2015, Cube expressed regret at including the word &quot;Jew&quot; in the lyrics of &quot;No Vaseline&quot; and explained that he intended to attack only Heller and not &quot;the whole Jewish race&quot;.

In 2020, Marlow Stern wrote an article in the &quot;Daily Beast&quot; addressing Cube&#x27;s &quot;long, disturbing history&quot; of anti-Semitism. The article was a response to Cube&#x27;s day-long Twitter posting spree the day before, during which he promoted Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. He also shared various disproven anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. Again calling himself &quot;just pro-black&quot; and not &quot;anti-anybody&quot;, he dismissed &quot;the hype&quot; and professed that he was just &quot;telling [his] truth&quot;.

<doc id="148341" wikidata="Q819016" url="?curid=148341" title="Carlos Santana">
<text>Carlos Humberto Santana Barragán (; born July 20, 1947) is an American guitarist, best known as a founding member of the rock band Santana. Born and raised in Mexico where he developed his musical background, he rose to fame in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the United States with Santana, which pioneered a fusion of rock and roll and Latin American jazz. Its sound featured his melodic, blues-based lines set against Latin American and African rhythms played on percussion instruments not generally heard in rock, such as timbales and congas. He experienced a resurgence of popularity and critical acclaim in the late 1990s.

In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine listed Santana at No. 20 on their list of the 100 greatest guitarists. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named him the 11th greatest guitarist of all time. He has won 10 Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards, and was inducted along with his namesake band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Santana was born in Autlán de Navarro in Jalisco, Mexico on July 20, 1947. He learned to play the violin at age five and the guitar at age eight, under the tutelage of his father, who was a mariachi musician. His younger brother, Jorge, also became a professional guitarist.

The family moved from Autlán to Tijuana, on the border with the United States. Carlos&#x27; rock and roll career started in the city park: &quot;Parque Teniente Guerrero&quot;, his mother took him to see the Tj&#x27;s, the pioneer rock and roll band from the city. TJ (tee jay) is a nickname for Tijuana. They were formed by Javier Bátiz. At the age of 12, Carlos became a roadie and eventually he would join them as a bass player, bass because Bátiz was playing guitar. He later left so he could play guitar in another bar band. The Tj&#x27;s and Bátiz turned Carlos on to blues music, especially that of T-Bone Walker, Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Chuck Berry, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, and James Brown.

The Santanas then moved to San Francisco, where his father had steady work. In October 1966, Santana started the Santana Blues Band. By 1968, the band had begun to incorporate different types of influences into their electric blues. Santana later said, &quot;If I would go to some cat&#x27;s room, he&#x27;d be listening to Sly [Stone] and Jimi Hendrix; another guy to the Stones and the Beatles. Another guy&#x27;d be listening to Tito Puente and Mongo Santamaría. Another guy&#x27;d be listening to Miles [Davis] and [John] Coltrane... To me it was like being at a university.&quot;

Around the age of eight, Santana fell under the influence of blues performers like B.B. King, Javier Bátiz, Mike Bloomfield, and John Lee Hooker. Gábor Szabó&#x27;s mid-1960s jazz guitar work also strongly influenced Santana&#x27;s playing. Indeed, Szabó&#x27;s composition &quot;Gypsy Queen&quot; was used as the second part of Santana&#x27;s 1970 treatment of Peter Green&#x27;s composition &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot;, almost down to identical guitar licks. Santana&#x27;s 2012 instrumental album &quot;Shape Shifter&quot; includes a song called &quot;Mr. Szabo&quot;, played in tribute in the style of Szabó. Santana also credits Hendrix, Bloomfield, Hank Marvin, and Peter Green as important influences; he considered Bloomfield a direct mentor, writing of a key meeting with Bloomfield in San Francisco in the foreword he wrote to a 2000 biography of Bloomfield, &quot;Michael Bloomfield: If You Love These Blues – An Oral History&quot;. Between the ages of 10 and 12, he was sexually abused by an American man who brought him across the border. Santana lived in the Mission District, graduated from James Lick Middle School, and left Mission High School in 1965. He was accepted at California State University, Northridge and Humboldt State University, but chose not to attend college.

=== Early career ===
Santana was influenced by popular artists of the 1950s such as B.B. King, T-Bone Walker, Javier Batiz, and John Lee Hooker. Soon after he began playing guitar, he joined local bands along the &quot;Tijuana Strip&quot;, where he was able to begin developing his own sound. He was also introduced to a variety of new musical influences, including jazz and folk music, and witnessed the growing hippie movement centered in San Francisco in the 1960s. After several years spent working as a dishwasher at Tic Tock Drive-In No2 and busking to pay for a Gibson SG, replacing a destroyed Gibson Melody Maker, Santana decided to become a full-time musician. In 1966, he was chosen along with other musicians to form an ad hoc band to substitute for that of an intoxicated Paul Butterfield to play a Sunday matinee set at Bill Graham&#x27;s Fillmore Auditorium. Graham selected the substitutes from musicians he knew primarily through his connections with the Butterfield Blues Band, Grateful Dead, and Jefferson Airplane. Santana&#x27;s guitar playing caught the attention of both the audience and Graham.

During the same year he and fellow street musicians David Brown (bass guitar), Marcus Malone (percussion) and Gregg Rolie (lead vocals, Hammond Organ B3), formed the Santana Blues Band.

=== Record deal, Woodstock breakthrough, and height of success: 1969–1972 ===
Santana&#x27;s band was signed by Columbia Records, which shortened its name to simply &quot;Santana&quot;. It went into the studio to record its first album in January 1969, finally laying down tracks in May that became its first album. Members were not satisfied with the release, dismissed drummer Bob Livingston, and added Mike Shrieve, who had a strong background in both jazz and rock. Then the band lost percussionist Marcus Malone, who was charged with involuntary manslaughter. Michael Carabello was re-enlisted in his place, bringing with him experienced Nicaraguan percussionist José Chepito Areas.

Major rock music promoter Bill Graham, a Latin music aficionado who had been a fan of Santana from its inception, arranged for the band to appear at the Woodstock Music and Art Festival before its debut album was even released. Its set was one of the surprises of the festival, highlighted by an eleven-minute performance of a throbbing instrumental, &quot;Soul Sacrifice&quot;. Its inclusion in the &quot;Woodstock&quot; film and soundtrack album vastly increased the band&#x27;s popularity. Graham also suggested Santana record the Willie Bobo song &quot;Evil Ways&quot;, as he felt it would get radio airplay. The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Santana&quot;, was released in August 1969 and became a hit, reaching No. 4 on the U.S. Billboard 200.

The band&#x27;s performance at Woodstock and the follow-up sound track and movie introduced them to an international audience and garnered critical acclaim. The sudden success which followed put pressure on the group, highlighting the different musical directions in which Rolie and Santana were starting to go. Rolie, along with some of the other band members, wanted to emphasize a basic hard rock sound which had been a key component in establishing the band from the start. Santana, however, was increasingly interested in moving beyond his love of blues and rock and wanted more jazzy, ethereal elements in the music. He became fascinated with Gábor Szabó, Miles Davis, Pharoah Sanders, and John Coltrane, as well as developing a growing interest in spirituality. Although Davis and Santana were longtime friends, they only recorded together once, in 1990 for Rustichelli. Santana&#x27;s band has also included many musicians who also played with Davis. At the same time, Chepito Areas was stricken with a near-fatal brain hemorrhage, and Santana hoped to continue by finding a temporary replacement (first Willie Bobo, then Coke Escovedo), while others in the band, especially Michael Carabello, felt it was wrong to perform publicly without Areas. Cliques formed and the band started to disintegrate.

Consolidating the interest generated by their first album, and their highly acclaimed live performance at the Woodstock Festival in August 1969, the band followed up with their second album, &quot;Abraxas&quot;, in September 1970. The album&#x27;s mix of rock, blues, jazz, salsa and other influences was very well received, showing a musical maturation from their first album and refining the band&#x27;s early sound. &quot;Abraxas&quot; included two of Santana&#x27;s most enduring and well-known hits, &quot;Oye Como Va&quot;, and &quot;Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen&quot;. &quot;Abraxas&quot; spent six weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard chart at the end of 1970. The album remained on the charts for 88 weeks and was certified 4× platinum in 1986. In 2003, the album was ranked number 205 on Rolling Stone magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

Teenage San Francisco Bay Area guitar prodigy Neal Schon joined the Santana band in 1971, in time to complete the third album, &quot;Santana III&quot;. The band now boasted a powerful dual-lead-guitar act that gave the album a tougher sound. The sound of the band was also helped by the return of a recuperated Chepito Areas and the assistance of Coke Escovedo in the percussion section. Enhancing the band&#x27;s sound further was the support of popular Bay Area group Tower of Power&#x27;s horn section, Luis Gasca of Malo, and other session musicians which added to both percussion and vocals, injecting more energy to the proceedings. &quot;Santana III&quot; was another success, reaching No. 1 on the album charts, selling two million copies, and yielding the hit &quot;No One to Depend On&quot;.

Tension between members of the band continued, however. Along with musical differences, drug use became a problem, and Santana was deeply worried that it was affecting the band&#x27;s performance. Coke Escovedo encouraged Santana to take more control of the band&#x27;s musical direction, much to the dismay of some of the others who thought that the band and its sound was a collective effort. Also, financial irregularities were exposed while under the management of Stan Marcum, whom Bill Graham criticized as being incompetent. Growing resentments between Santana and Michael Carabello over lifestyle issues resulted in his departure on bad terms. James Mingo Lewis was hired at the last minute as a replacement at a concert in New York City. David Brown later left due to substance abuse problems. A South American tour was cut short in Lima, Peru due to unruly fans and student protests against U.S. governmental policies.

In January 1972, Santana, Schon, Escovedo, and Lewis joined former Band of Gypsys drummer Buddy Miles for a concert at Hawaii&#x27;s Diamond Head Crater, which was recorded for the album &quot;Carlos Santana &amp; Buddy Miles! Live!&quot;, which became a gold record.

=== &quot;Caravanserai&quot; ===
In early 1972, Santana and the remaining members of the band started working on their fourth album, &quot;Caravanserai&quot;. During the studio sessions, Santana and Michael Shrieve brought in other musicians: percussionists James Mingo Lewis and Latin-Jazz veteran, Armando Peraza replacing Michael Carabello, and bassists Tom Rutley and Doug Rauch replacing David Brown. Also assisting on keyboards were Wendy Haas and Tom Coster. With the unsettling influx of new players in the studio, Gregg Rolie and Neal Schon decided that it was time to leave after the completion of the album, even though both contributed to the session. Rolie returned home to Seattle; later, he and Schon became founding members of Journey.

When &quot;Caravanserai&quot; did emerge in 1972, it marked a strong change in musical direction towards jazz fusion. The album received critical praise, but CBS executive Clive Davis warned Santana and the band that it would sabotage the band&#x27;s position as a &quot;Top 40&quot; act. Nevertheless, over the years, the album achieved platinum status. The difficulties Santana and the band went through during this period were chronicled in Ben Fong-Torres&#x27; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; 1972 cover story &quot;The Resurrection of Carlos Santana&quot;.

=== Shifting styles and spirituality: 1972–1979 ===
In 1972, Santana became interested in the pioneering fusion band the Mahavishnu Orchestra and its guitarist, John McLaughlin. Aware of Santana&#x27;s interest in meditation, McLaughlin introduced Santana and his wife Deborah to his guru Sri Chinmoy. Chinmoy accepted them as disciples in 1973. Santana was given the name Devadip, meaning &quot;The lamp, light and eye of God&quot;. Santana and McLaughlin recorded an album together, &quot;Love, Devotion, Surrender&quot; (1973) with members of Santana and the Mahavishnu Orchestra, along with percussionist Don Alias and organist Larry Young, both of whom had made appearances, along with McLaughlin, on Miles Davis&#x27; classic 1970 album &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;.

In 1973, Santana, having obtained legal rights to the band&#x27;s name, &quot;Santana&quot;, formed a new version of the band with Armando Peraza and Chepito Areas on percussion, Doug Rauch on bass, Michael Shrieve on drums, and Tom Coster and Richard Kermode on keyboards. Santana later was able to recruit jazz vocalist Leon Thomas for the tour supporting &quot;Caravanserai&quot; in Japan on July 3 and 4, 1973, which was recorded for the 1974 live, sprawling, high-energy triple vinyl LP fusion album &quot;Lotus&quot;. CBS records would not allow its release unless the material was condensed. Santana did not agree to those terms, and &quot;Lotus&quot; was available in the U.S. only as an expensive, imported, three-record set. The group later went into the studio and recorded &quot;Welcome&quot; (1973), which further reflected Santana&#x27;s interests in jazz fusion and his increasing commitment to the spiritual life of Sri Chinmoy.

A collaboration with John Coltrane&#x27;s widow, Alice Coltrane, &quot;Illuminations&quot; (1974), followed. The album delved into avant-garde esoteric free jazz, Eastern Indian and classical influences with other ex-Miles Davis sidemen Jack DeJohnette and Dave Holland. Soon after, Santana replaced his band members again. This time Kermode, Thomas and Rauch departed from the group and were replaced by vocalist Leon Patillo (later a successful Contemporary Christian artist) and returning bassist David Brown. He also recruited soprano saxophonist Jules Broussard for the lineup. The band recorded one studio album &quot;Borboletta&quot;, which was released in 1974. Drummer Leon &quot;Ndugu&quot; Chancler later joined the band as a replacement for Michael Shrieve, who left to pursue a solo career.

By this time Bill Graham&#x27;s management company had assumed responsibility for the affairs of the group. Graham was critical of Santana&#x27;s move into jazz and felt he needed to concentrate on getting &quot;Santana&quot; back into the charts with the edgy, streetwise ethnic sound that had made them famous. Santana himself was seeing that the group&#x27;s direction was alienating many fans. Although the albums and performances were given good reviews by critics in jazz and jazz fusion circles, sales had plummeted.

Santana, along with Tom Coster, producer David Rubinson, and Chancler, formed yet another version of &quot;Santana&quot;, adding vocalist Greg Walker. The 1976 album &quot;Amigos&quot;, which featured the songs &quot;Dance, Sister, Dance&quot; and &quot;Let It Shine&quot;, had a strong funk and Latin sound. The album received considerable airplay on FM album-oriented rock stations with the instrumental &quot;Europa (Earth&#x27;s Cry Heaven&#x27;s Smile)&quot; and re-introduced &quot;Santana&quot; to the charts. In 1976, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ran a second cover story on &quot;Santana&quot; entitled &quot;Santana Comes Home&quot;. In February 1976, Santana was presented with fifteen gold discs in Australia, representing sales in excess of 244,000.

The albums conceived through the late 1970s followed the same formula, although with several lineup changes. Among the new personnel who joined was current percussionist Raul Rekow, who joined in early 1977. Most notable of the band&#x27;s commercial efforts of this era was a version of the 1960s Zombies hit, &quot;She&#x27;s Not There&quot;, on the 1977 double album &quot;Moonflower&quot;.

Santana recorded two solo projects in this time: &quot;Oneness: Silver Dreams – Golden Reality&quot;, in 1979 and &quot;The Swing of Delight&quot; in 1980, which featured Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter, and Tony Williams.

The pressures and temptations of being a high-profile rock musician and requirements of the spiritual lifestyle which guru Sri Chinmoy and his followers demanded were in conflict, and imposed considerable stress upon Santana&#x27;s lifestyle and marriage. He was becoming increasingly disillusioned with what he thought were the unreasonable rules that Chinmoy imposed on his life, and in particular with his refusal to allow Santana and Deborah to start a family. He felt too that his fame was being used to increase the guru&#x27;s visibility. Santana and Deborah eventually ended their relationship with Chinmoy in 1982.

=== 1980s and early 1990s ===

More radio-friendly singles followed from Santana and the band. &quot;Winning&quot; in 1981 (from &quot;Zebop!&quot;) and &quot;Hold On&quot; (a remake of the Canadian artist Ian Thomas&#x27; song) in 1982 both reached the top twenty. After his break with Sri Chinmoy, Santana went into the studio to record another solo album with Keith Olson and legendary R&amp;B producer Jerry Wexler. The 1983 album &quot;Havana Moon&quot; revisited Santana&#x27;s early musical experiences in Tijuana with Bo Diddley&#x27;s &quot;Who Do You Love&quot; and the title cut, Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Havana Moon&quot;. The album&#x27;s guests included Booker T. Jones, the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Willie Nelson, and even Santana&#x27;s father&#x27;s mariachi orchestra. Santana again paid tribute to his early rock roots by doing the film score to &quot;La Bamba&quot;, which was based on the life of rock and roll legend Ritchie Valens and starred Lou Diamond Phillips.

The band &quot;Santana&quot; returned in 1985 with a new album, &quot;Beyond Appearances&quot;, and two years later with &quot;Freedom&quot;. &quot;Freedom&quot; is the fifteenth studio album by Santana. By this recording, Santana had nine members, some of whom had returned after being with the band in previous versions, including lead singer on the album Buddy Miles. Freedom moved away from the more poppy sound of the previous album &quot;Beyond Appearances&quot; and back to the band&#x27;s original Latin rock.

Growing weary of trying to appease record company executives with formulaic hit records, Santana took great pleasure in jamming and making guest appearances with notables such as the jazz fusion group Weather Report, jazz pianist McCoy Tyner, Blues legend John Lee Hooker, Frank Franklin, Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid, and West African singer Salif Keita. He and Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead later recorded and performed with Nigerian drummer Babatunde Olatunji, who conceived one of Santana&#x27;s famous 1960s drum jams, &quot;Jingo&quot;. In 1988, Santana organized a reunion with past members from the Santana band for a series of concert dates. CBS records released a 20-year retrospective of the band&#x27;s accomplishments with &quot;Viva Santana!&quot;, a double CD compilation. That same year, Santana formed an all-instrumental group featuring jazz legend Wayne Shorter on tenor and soprano saxophone. The group also included Patrice Rushen on keyboards, Alphonso Johnson on bass, Armando Peraza and Chepito Areas on percussion, and Leon &quot;Ndugu&quot; Chancler on drums. They toured briefly and received much acclaim from the music press, who compared the effort with the era of &quot;Caravanserai&quot; (1972). Santana released another solo record, &quot;Blues for Salvador&quot; (1987), which won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.

In 1990, Santana left Columbia Records after twenty-two years and signed with Polygram. The following year he made a guest appearance on Ottmar Liebert&#x27;s album, &quot;Solo Para Ti&quot; (1991), on the songs &quot;Reaching out 2 U&quot; and on a cover of his own song, &quot;Samba Pa Ti&quot;. In 1992, Santana hired the jam band Phish as his opening act. On his 1992 tour, Santana regularly invited some or all of the members of Phish to jam with his band during his headlining performances. Phish also toured with Santana in Europe in 1996.

=== Return to commercial success ===
Santana kicked off the 1990s with a new album &quot;Spirits Dancing in the Flesh&quot; in 1990. This was followed by &quot;Milagro&quot; in 1992, a live album &quot;Sacred Fire&quot; in 1993 and &quot;Brothers&quot; (a collaboration with his brother Jorge and nephew Carlos Hernandez) in 1994, but sales were relatively poor. Santana toured widely over the next few years but there were no further new album releases, and eventually he was even without a recording contract. However, Arista Records&#x27; Clive Davis, who had worked with Santana at Columbia Records, signed him and encouraged him to record a star-studded album with mostly younger artists. The result was 1999&#x27;s &quot;Supernatural&quot;, which included collaborations with Everlast, Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty, Eric Clapton, Lauryn Hill, Wyclef Jean, CeeLo Green, Maná, Dave Matthews, KC Porter, J. B. Eckl, and others.

However, the lead single was what grabbed the attention of both fans and the music industry. &quot;Smooth&quot;, a dynamic cha-cha stop-start number co-written and sung by Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty, is laced throughout with Santana&#x27;s guitar fills and runs. The track&#x27;s energy was immediately apparent on radio, and it was played on a wide variety of station formats. &quot;Smooth&quot; spent twelve weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming in the process the last No. 1 single of the 1990s. The music video, set on a hot barrio street, was also very popular. &quot;Supernatural&quot; reached number one on the US album charts and the follow-up single, &quot;Maria Maria&quot;, featuring the R&amp;B duo the Product G&amp;B, also hit number one, spending ten weeks there in the spring of 2000. &quot;Supernatural&quot; eventually shipped over 15 million copies in the United States, and won eight Grammy Awards including Album of the Year, making it Santana&#x27;s most successful album.

Carlos Santana, alongside the classic &quot;Santana&quot; lineup of their first two albums, was inducted as an individual into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. During the ceremony he performed &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot; with the writer of the song, Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s founder Peter Green. Green was inducted the same night.

In 2000, &quot;Supernatural&quot; won nine Grammy Awards (eight for Santana personally), including Album of the Year, Record of the Year for &quot;Smooth&quot;, and Song of the Year for its writers Thomas and Itaal Shur. Santana&#x27;s acceptance speeches described his feelings about music&#x27;s place in one&#x27;s spiritual existence. Later in the same year at the Latin Grammy Awards, he won three awards including Record of the Year. In 2001, Santana&#x27;s guitar skills were featured in Michael Jackson&#x27;s song &quot;Whatever Happens&quot; from the album &quot;Invincible&quot;.

In 2002, Santana released &quot;Shaman&quot;, revisiting the &quot;Supernatural&quot; format of guest artists including Citizen Cope, P.O.D., and Seal. Although the album was not the runaway success its predecessor had been, it produced two radio-friendly hits. &quot;The Game of Love&quot; featuring Michelle Branch rose to number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and spent many weeks at the top of the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, and &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You &amp; I&quot;, written by and featuring Chad Kroeger from the group Nickelback (the original and a remix with Alex Band from the group the Calling were combined towards chart performance), reached number eight on the Billboard Hot 100. &quot;The Game of Love&quot; went on to win the Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. In the same year, he was inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame.

In early August 2003, Santana was named fifteenth on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;. In 2004, Santana was honored as the Person of the Year by the Latin Recording Academy.

On April 21, 2005, Santana was honored as a BMI Icon at the 12th annual BMI Latin Awards. Santana was the first songwriter designated a BMI Icon at the company&#x27;s Latin Awards. The honor is given to a creator who has been &quot;a unique and indelible influence on generations of music makers&quot;.

In 2005, Herbie Hancock approached Santana to collaborate on an album again using the &quot;Supernatural&quot; formula. &quot;Possibilities&quot; was released on August 30, 2005, featuring Carlos Santana and Angélique Kidjo on &quot;Safiatou&quot;. Also in 2005, fellow Latin star Shakira invited Santana to play the soft rock guitar ballad &quot;Illegal&quot; on her second English-language studio album &quot;Oral Fixation, Vol. 2&quot;.

Santana&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;All That I Am&quot; consists primarily of collaborations with other artists. The first single, the peppy &quot;I&#x27;m Feeling You&quot;, again featured Michelle Branch and the Wreckers. Other musicians joining this time included Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, Kirk Hammett from Metallica, hip-hop artist/songwriter/producer will.i.am, guitarist/songwriter/producer George Pajon, hip-hop/reggae star Sean Paul, and R&amp;B singer Joss Stone. In April and May 2006, Santana toured Europe, where he promoted his son Salvador Santana&#x27;s band as his opening act.

In 2007, Santana appeared, along with Sheila E. and José Feliciano, on Gloria Estefan&#x27;s album &quot;90 Millas,&quot; on the single &quot;No Llores&quot;. He also teamed again with Chad Kroeger for the hit single &quot;Into the Night&quot;. He also played guitar in Eros Ramazzotti&#x27;s hit &quot;Fuoco nel fuoco&quot; from the album &quot;e²&quot;.

In 2008, Santana was reported to be working with his longtime friend, Marcelo Vieira, on his solo album &quot;Acoustic Demos&quot;, which was released at the end of the year. It features tracks such as &quot;For Flavia&quot; and &quot;Across the Grave&quot;, the latter said to feature heavy melodic riffs by Santana.

Santana performed at the 2009 American Idol Finale with the top 13 finalists, which starred many acts such as KISS, Queen and Rod Stewart. On July 8, 2009, Santana appeared at the Athens Olympic Stadium in Athens with his 10-member all-star band as part of his &quot;Supernatural Santana – A Trip through the Hits&quot; European tour. On July 10, 2009, he also appeared at Philip II Stadium in Skopje. With a 2.5-hour long concert and 20,000 people, Santana appeared for the first time in that region. &quot;Supernatural Santana – A Trip through the Hits&quot; was played through 2011 at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas.

Santana is featured as a playable character in the music video game Guitar Hero 5. A live recording of his song &quot;No One to Depend On&quot; is included in the game, which was released on September 1, 2009. More recently in 2011, three Santana songs were offered as downloadable content (DLC) for guitar learning software Rocksmith: &quot;Oye Como Va&quot;, &quot;Smooth&quot;, and &quot;Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen&quot;. In the same year, Santana received the Billboard Latin Music Lifetime Achievement Award.

In 2007 Santana along with chef Roberto Santibañez.opened a chain of upscale Mexican restaurants called &quot;Maria Maria&quot;. The restaurants were located in Tempe, Arizona, Mill Valley, Walnut Creek, Danville, San Diego, Austin, Texas, and Boca Raton, Florida. As of 2021, the only open location is in Walnut Creek.

In 2012, Santana released an album &quot;Shape Shifter&quot; consisting of mostly instrumental tracks. On February 23, 2013, there was a public announcement on ultimateclassicrock.com about a reunion of the surviving members (minus Jose &quot;Chepito&quot; Areas) of the Santana band that recorded &quot;Santana III&quot; in 1971. The next album was titled &quot;Santana IV&quot;. On May 6, 2014, his first-ever Spanish-language album &quot;Corazón&quot; was released.

On September 12, 2015, Santana appeared as a member of Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh&#x27;s band Phil Lesh and Friends at the third annual Lockn&#x27; Festival. He has continued to act as a mentor to a younger generation of jam acts, like Derek Trucks and Robert Randolph.

In 2016, Carlos Santana reunited with past Santana band members Gregg Rolie, Michael Carabello, Michael Shrieve, and Neil Schon, releasing the album &quot;Santana IV&quot; and embarking with the band on a brief tour. A full set from this lineup was filmed at the House of Blues in Las Vegas and released as a live album and DVD titled &quot;Live at the House of Blues Las Vegas&quot;.

In 2017, Santana collaborated with the Isley Brothers to release the album &quot;The Power of Peace&quot; on July 28, 2017.

In December 2018, Santana published a guitar lesson on YouTube as part of the online education series MasterClass.

In October 2019, Santana was featured on the American rapper Tyga&#x27;s song &quot;Mamacita&quot; alongside American rapper YG. The song&#x27;s music video premiered on YouTube on 25 October.

In March 2020, Santana&#x27;s &quot;Miraculous World Tour&quot; was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In August 2021, Santana signed a new global record deal with BMG to release his new full-length studio album &quot;Blessings and Miracles&quot;. In the same month, he performed in New York&#x27;s Central Park along with Rob Thomas and Wyclef Jean.

In August 2023, Santana received some controversy regarding statements he made about trans people, stating &quot;...a woman is a woman and a man is a man&quot;. He would apologize a day later for his remarks.

== Equipment ==

=== Guitars and effects ===
Santana played a red Gibson SG Special with P-90 pickups at the Woodstock festival (1969). During 1970–1972, between the release of &quot;Abraxas&quot; (1970) and &quot;Santana III&quot; 1971, he used different Gibson Les Pauls and a black Gibson SG Special. In 1974, he played and endorsed the Gibson L6-S Custom. This can be heard on the album &quot;Borboletta&quot; (1974). From 1976 until 1982, his main guitar was a Yamaha SG 175B, and sometimes a white Gibson SG Custom with three open-coil pick-ups. In 1982, he started to use a custom-made PRS Custom 24 guitar. In 1988, PRS Guitars began making Santana signature model guitars, which Santana has played through their various iterations ever since (see below).

Santana currently uses a Santana II model guitar fitted with PRS Santana III nickel-covered pickups, a tremolo bar, and .009–.042 gauge D&#x27;Addario strings. He also plays a PRS Santana MD &quot;The Multidimensional&quot; guitar. The Santana guitars feature necks made of a single piece of mahogany topped with rosewood fretboard; some feature highly sought-after Brazilian rosewood.

Santana Signature models:

* PRS Santana I &quot;The Yellow&quot; guitar (1988)
* PRS Santana II &quot;Supernatural&quot; guitar (1999)
* PRS Santana III guitar (2001)
* PRS Santana SE guitar (2001)
* PRS Santana SE II guitar (2003)
* PRS Santana Shaman SE-Limited Edition guitar (2003)
* PRS Santana MD &quot;The Multidimensional&quot; guitar (2008)
* PRS Santana 25th Anniversary guitar (2009)
* PRS Santana Abraxas SE-Limited Edition guitar (2009)
* PRS Santana SE &quot;The Multidimensional&quot; guitar (2011)
* PRS Santana Retro guitar (2017)
* PRS Santana Yellow SE guitar (2017)
Santana also uses a classical guitar, the Alvarez Yairi CY127CE with Alvarez tension nylon strings, and in recent years (from 2009) he uses custom-made, semi-hollow Toru Nittono&#x27;s &quot;Model-T&quot; Jazz Electric Nylon.

Santana does not use many effects pedals. His PRS guitar is connected to a Mu-Tron Wah-wah pedal (or, more recently, a Dunlop 535Q wah and a T-Rex Replica delay pedal, then through a customized Jim Dunlop amp switcher which in turn is connected to the different amps or cabinets.

Previous setups include an Ibanez Tube Screamer right after the guitar. He is also known to have used an Electro-Harmonix Big Muff distortion for his famous sustain. In the song &quot;Stand Up&quot; from the album &quot;Marathon&quot; (1979), Santana uses a Heil talk box in the guitar solo. He has also used the Audiotech Guitar Products 1x6 Rack Mount Audio Switcher in rehearsals for the 2008 &quot;Live Your Light&quot; tour.

Santana uses two different guitar picks: the large triangular Dunlop he has used for many years, and the V-Pick Freakishly Large Round.

=== Amplifiers ===
Santana&#x27;s distinctive guitar tone is produced by PRS Santana signature guitars plugged into multiple amplifiers. The amps consist of a Mesa Boogie Mark I, Dumble Overdrive Reverb and more recently a Bludotone amplifier. Santana compares the tonal qualities of each amplifier to that of a singer producing head/nasal tones, chest tones, and belly tones. A three-way amp switcher is employed on Carlos&#x27;s pedal board to enable him to switch between amps. Often the unique tones of each amplifier are blended together, complementing each other producing a richer tone.

He also put the &quot;Boogie&quot; in Mesa Boogie. Santana is credited with coining the popular Mesa amplifier name when he tried one and exclaimed, &quot;That little thing really Boogies!&quot;

Specifically, Santana combines a Mesa/Boogie Mark I head running through a Boogie cabinet with Altec 417-8H (or recently JBL E120s) speakers, and a Dumble Overdrive Reverb and/or a Dumble Overdrive Special running through a Brown or Marshall 4x12 cabinet with Celestion G12M &quot;Greenback&quot; speakers, depending on the desired sound. Shure KSM-32 microphones are used to pick up the sound, going to the PA. Additionally, a Fender Cyber-Twin Amp is mostly used at home.

During his early career, Santana used a GMT transistor amplifier stack and a silverface Fender Twin. The GMT 226A rig was used at the Woodstock concert as well as during recording Santana&#x27;s debut album. During this era, Santana also began to use the Fender Twin, which was also used on the debut and later at the recording sessions of Abraxas.

== Personal life ==
In 1965, Santana became a naturalized U.S. citizen.

After discovering Chinmoy and Yogananda in 1972, Santana quit marijuana until 1981. In 2020, Santana launched his own brand of cannabis named Mirayo that honours &quot;the spiritual and ancient Latin heritage of the plant.&quot;

From 1973 to 2007, he was married to Deborah King, daughter of blues musician Saunders King. They have three children, Salvador, Stella, and Angelica, and co-founded the Milagro (Miracle) Foundation, a non-profit organization which provides financial aid for educational, medical, and other needs. He stated in 2000 that he communicates with the angel Metatron. In 2007, King filed for divorce after 34 years of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences. On July 9, 2010, Santana proposed to his touring drummer Cindy Blackman on stage during a concert at Tinley Park, Illinois. The two were married in December 2010 and currently live in Las Vegas.

Santana underwent heart surgery in December 2021. He suffered an undisclosed medical emergency on stage at a concert at Pine Knob Music Theatre in Michigan on July 5, 2022, but was able to gain consciousness while being helped off the stage. A statement from his publicist later announced that he had collapsed from heat and dehydration, but was being observed at the local hospital and would recover soon. His show scheduled for the day after was postponed. On July 8, 2022, Santana&#x27;s management company said that he would postpone his next six concerts out of an &quot;abundance of caution for the artist&#x27;s health&quot;.

In an interview with Rolling Stone in 2000, Santana spoke of his Christian faith and how it helped to guide him through some of the most troubling times in his life.

<doc id="148342" wikidata="Q1124620" url="?curid=148342" title="Condorito">
<text>Condorito (&quot;Little Condor&quot; in Spanish) is a Chilean comic book and comic strip series that features an anthropomorphic condor living in a fictitious town named Pelotillehue, a typical small Chilean provincial town. He is meant to be a representation of the Chilean people.

Condorito was first published on August 6, 1949, created by the Chilean cartoonist René Ríos, known as &quot;Pepo&quot;. Condorito is very popular throughout Latin America, where the character is considered part of the general popular culture. Condorito and his friends appear in a daily comic strip.

By 2012, Condorito was in 105 Spanish-language newspapers distributed in 19 countries, including Canada, United States, Italy, and Japan. 1,369 million of its comic strips are published annually, being together with Mafalda the most relevant Hispanic comic book character in the world.

== Characteristics ==
One peculiar characteristic of &quot;Condorito&quot; is that the character, after going through an embarrassing moment or being the butt of the joke in a given strip, almost always falls backwards to the floor (legs visible or out of frame) in the final panel, although new comic strips have now put the victim of the joke looking at the reader instead. This classic comic strip &quot;flop take&quot; is accompanied by a free-fall onomatopoeic sound (usually &quot;¡Plop!&quot;). From time to time, this is replaced by the victim of the joke saying &quot;¡Exijo una explicación!&quot; (&quot;I demand an explanation!&quot;), usually as a twist or downbeat ending. Another catchphrase, usual for Condorito, but used with almost all the characters, is &quot;Reflauta&quot;, to show frustration or other emotions.

The comic styles that predominate in Condorito are white humor and satire. The edition is very careful so that profanity or obscenities do not appear. White humor is generated from situations that are resolved in a ridiculous or extraordinary way.

In order for readers in other Spanish-speaking countries to understand the jokes, many of them had to be modified: excessively marked Chileanisms were removed and certain references to Chile were stopped.

Over the years, Condorito character has grown, being now older than in his beginnings, and even with a bigger belly.

According to Alberto Montt, manager of the World Editors company:

=== Comic traits ===
In Condorito, stereotypes for characters and situations are regularly used, although in general the humor is white, they reflect the mentality and habitual humor of past decades: jokes about the crazy or insane, stupid, drunk, infidelity, machismo, ethnic, medical and sick, usurers, peasants recently arrived in the city, etc.

Generally, when kiosks are drawn, apart from the newspaper &quot;El Hocicón&quot;, they display various magazines that parody well-known international magazines in their names. Thus we have: &quot;Vanidosa&quot; by &quot;Vanidades&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolita&quot; by &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Bad Housekeeping&quot; by &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, &quot;Unpopular Mechanics by Popular Mechanics&quot;, &quot;FeoMundo&quot; by &quot;GeoMundo&quot;, &quot;Ideas para robar&quot; by &quot;Ideas para su hogar&quot;, &quot;Yo&quot; by &quot;Tú&quot;, &quot;Spicnik&quot; by &quot;Sputnik&quot;, &quot;Sinlecciones&quot; by &quot;Selecciones&quot;, &quot;Conozca Menos&quot; by &quot;Conozca Más&quot;, &quot;Vago&quot; por &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Nada Interesante&quot; by &quot;Muy Interesante&quot;, &quot;El Humorista&quot; by &quot;El Economista&quot;, &quot;Casos&quot; by &quot;Cosas&quot;, among other. Likewise, they usually also sell magazines supposedly for adults since a half-naked woman almost always appears on their covers.

On the other hand, and depending on the situation, Condorito himself appears represented as belonging to different races or cultures: although he is white, he frequently appears as black or oriental. In addition, colloquial language is used to reinforce the verbal abuse of which the characters are victims (&quot;gross huaso&quot;, &quot;roto marginal&quot;, &quot;peeled&quot;, etc.).

== Cartoonists and collaborators ==
As the frequency of publication of the Condorito magazine increased, Pepo had to form a team of cartoonists and collaborators. Among the first were Renato Andrade Alarcón &quot;Nato&quot; (1921-2006), Jorge Carvallo Muñoz &quot;Jorcar&quot; (1932-2017), Ricardo González Paredes &quot;Ric&quot; (1936-2011) and Eduardo de la Barra (cartoonist) (1942-2013), Hernán Vidal &quot;Hervi&quot; (b. 1943) and Guillermo Durán Castro &quot;Guidu&quot; (b. 1946). Later, Alberto Vivanco Ortiz (b. 1939) also collaborated and Víctor Hugo Aguirre Abarca &quot;Tom&quot; (b. 1944). Other people who joined the Condorito team between the 50s and 60s were Jorge Délano Concha (b. 1958), Daniel Fernández, Marta García, Luis Peñaloza, Nelson Pérez (lyricist), Sergio Nawrath, Samuel &quot;Sam&quot; Gana Godoy (1932-2016), Dino Gnecco Zavallia (1935-2014), Edmundo Pezoa Cartagena (b. 1943), Christian Pardow Smith (1945-2002) and Luis Osses Asenjo (1947-2018).

==Characters==
* Condorito: The main character, Condorito is a lower class anthropomorphic condor, lackadaisical and unambitious, but also kind, loyal, friendly and ingenious.

* Don Chuma: Condorito&#x27;s best, most loyal friend, he is a tall, thin, kind man who helps Condorito to solve some of his problems.
* Pepe Cortisona: Condorito&#x27;s nemesis, especially when it comes to courting Yayita.

* Don Máximo Tacaño (&quot;Mr. Maximum Stingy&quot;): A humorous miser who would rather die than part with his money. Originally, there was a stereotypical and amoral Jewish moneylender in his place (variably called Don Jacoibo or Don Salomón), but this character was replaced due to complaints.
* Padre Venancio: Pelotillehue&#x27;s Roman Catholic priest.
* Tomate (&quot;Tomato&quot;): Short, fat, shy and bald, his head resembles a tomato, since his face is permanently red due to his shyness.

* Condor Otto and Huevo Fritz: Variations on Condorito and Huevoduro, but characters in their own right. They are German or German-descended characters usually used to tell jokes with obvious puns or very dumb punchlines.
* Emiliano: A very poor worker, he is frequently seen wanting a raise and stretching his hand under the door of the boss, usually being ignored.
* San Guchito: Although not generally a character, he is the patron saint of Pelotillehue. He is usually shown in benediction, holding a sandwich in his left hand. 
* Don Sata: Satan himself. Normally he tries to corrupt Condorito and friends by offering them power, riches, etc.

==Publishing trajectory==
===Origins===
In 1942, the Walt Disney Company created the animated film &quot;Saludos Amigos&quot; depicting Donald Duck and a cast of anthropomorphic characters representing various nations of the Americas: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. In the film, while the Disney characters are represented as humorous versions of &quot;charros&quot;, &quot;gauchos&quot;, etc., Chile was represented as Pedro, a small airplane engaged in his very first flight, whose attempt to fly over the Andes to pick up air mail from Mendoza is humorously depicted. Pepo created &quot;Condorito&quot; in response to what he perceived as a slight to the image of Chile.

The first publication of a Condorito comic strip was in the first issue of &quot;Okey&quot; magazine, owned by Zig-Zag, on August 6, 1949. In it, Condorito appeared as a thief of occasional chickens, who later regrets eating them. and tries to return it to the chicken coop but is stopped by a police officer and imprisoned. In the Condorito prison, he imagined the policeman eating the tasty chicken. The comic strip was two full pages long.

Condorito&#x27;s following publications were based on a character who came from the countryside driven by the rural-urban migration that lived in Chile during the 1950s; Condorito&#x27;s personality was that of a joker, witty and mischievous. According to screenwriter Jorge Montealegre, «Condorito&#x27;s profile in the first cartoons is focused on the Chilean roto [...] where very Chilean institutions are addressed, such as the &quot;compadrazgo&quot; with Don Chuma and the &quot;huacherío&quot; through Coné».

During the Okey magazine editions, Condorito was given a real context in a fictitious town, Pelotillehue, along with family members and situations closer to people.

By 1955, the year of the appearance of the first collection of Condorito jokes, the character already had its definitive appearance. As a publication, &quot;Condorito&quot; appeared on December 21 of that year. The comic strip &quot;Condorito&quot; has a characteristic format by which it has been published from its origins in a specific range of colors that only include red, brown, pink, black, white, gray and, from time to time, the green.

One of the only surviving cartoonists who worked with Pepo at the beginning of Condorito is the cartoonist Hernán Vidal (Hervi) who, at just 13 years old, became Pepo&#x27;s assistant.

=== Popularization ===
In 1961, &quot;Condorito&quot; began to be published twice a year. From number 7 to number 82 they were called «&quot;Condoritos&quot; numerados» (Numbered &quot;Condoritos&quot;) because they had their prominent numbering on the cover. Condorito&#x27;s book number 9, which came out in 1962, was dedicated to the Soccer World Cup held that same year in Chile. From 1965 to 1982, it was published irregularly; however, it began to be published regularly on a quarterly basis starting in 1970, and did so until the last issue of 1979.

=== Internationalization ===
In 1974 the first products related to Condorito came out in coloring books. In February 1975, the first Condorito compilation came out, called &quot;Especial Condorito: Clásicos de la historieta&quot; &quot;(Condorito Special: Comic Classics)&quot;. For Christmas 1975, the first Condorito toys came out: some Condorito and Coné dolls. In 1976 the international rights to Condorito were acquired by Editors Press Service, a subsidiary of the &quot;Evening Post Publishing Company&quot;. In Argentina in 1977, the first international edition of Condorito came out. Also in 1977, Editorial América and Bloque Dearmas began publishing the magazine in Colombia and Venezuela. In 1979 the last Condorito comics where he smokes appeared.

The 1980s were the best time for Condorito: Starting with the first edition of the 1980s, Condorito became a bimonthly publication.3 In February 1979, the first of a series of extraordinary editions went on sale of excellent quality and in giant size with hard covers and dimensions of 32 × 21.5 cm, except for one, (&quot;Condorito Campeón&quot;) of dimensions 26 × 18 cm. The collection was titled Selección de Oro de la revista Condorito (Gold Selection of Condorito magazine), and consisted of the following eleven numbers, each of them 64 pages:

In 1982, Condorito came out nine times a year. That same year, the first non-Hispanic edition of Condorito appeared, published in Brazil. In October 1982, &quot;Coné el Travieso&quot; &quot;(Coné the Naughty)&quot; came out for the first time, a pocket-sized magazine that appeared monthly with jokes about Condorito&#x27;s naughty nephew that appeared in number 22 of 1967. &quot;Coné el Travieso&quot;, in addition to the usual Coné and Yuyito, new characters were added, such as Huevito, Genito, Fonolita, Tacañito and Gargantita. In 1983 &quot;Condorito&quot; was published regularly in a monthly magazine format, and it did so until 1989. In 1986 the first special editions came out. In 1987 the first &quot;Libro de Oro (Golden Book)&quot; in Mexico was published, which, from 2004, became the &quot;Libro Gigante de Oro (Golden Giant Book)&quot; and since 2006 includes puzzles to solve called Condoripuzzles. In 1988, &quot;Juegos Condorito (Condorito Games)&quot; appeared, a quarterly publication. Between 1989 and 2019, Condorito magazine was published every fortnight.

==Condorito and politics==
&quot;Condorito&quot; through the 1960s and 1970s held to a conservative perspective on Chile and its society, poking fun at both the new left-wing poets and the hippies. At the first age of the comic, the jokes usually have a very basic context and themes, like African people always represented as primitive cannibals, women as bad drivers or as a jealous wife waiting for her husband to come back from a party, etc.

After the military coup of 1973, some Chilean cartoonists were censored by the military regime, yet unlike other publications (such as the Argentinian Mafalda), which combined criticism of society with humor, &quot;Condorito&quot;, which lacked the former, continued to be published. Since that time, many Chilean comics with a political view on society (&quot;e.g.&quot; Hervi&#x27;s &quot;Super Cifuentes&quot;) have been forgotten. &quot;Condorito&quot; remains the best-known Chilean comic book character.

==Film==

In commemoration of its 66th anniversary of the launch of the comic strip, an animated film adaptation was released on October 12, 2017 in Latin America, by 20th Century Fox and in the United States on January 12, 2018, by Pantelion Films.

<doc id="148343" wikidata="Q1211606" url="?curid=148343" title="Condor">
<text>Condor is the common name for two species of New World vultures, each in a monotypic genus. The name derives from the Quechua &quot;kuntur&quot;. They are the largest flying land birds in the Western Hemisphere.

One species, the Andean condor (&quot;Vultur gryphus&quot;), inhabits the Andean mountains. The other, the California condor (&quot;Gymnogyps californianus&quot;), is currently restricted to the western coastal mountains of the contiguous United States and Mexico, as well as the northern desert mountains of Arizona.

==Taxonomy==

Condors are part of the family Cathartidae, which contains the New World vultures, whereas the 15 species of Old World vultures are in the family Accipitridae, which also includes hawks, eagles, and kites. The New World and Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors. They both are carrion-eaters and the two groups are similar in appearance due to convergent evolution.

==Description==

Condors are very large, broad-winged soaring birds, the Andean condor being to shorter (beak to tail) on average than the northern species, but heavier and larger in wingspan. The Andean condor has a wingspan of and even up to about and a weight of 8–15 kg, with males ranging from to and females . Meanwhile the California condor has a weight of 8–14 kg and wingspan of about 109 inches, or 2.77 meters. California condors are North America&#x27;s largest flying land birds. Among all living flying birds, the Andean condor is the third heaviest after the Kori bustard and great bustard (up to ), and second only to the wandering albatross (up to ) in wingspan. Measurements are usually taken from specimens reared in captivity.

The adult plumage is uniformly black, except for a frill of white feathers nearly surrounding the base of the neck, which are meticulously kept clean by the bird. As an adaptation for hygiene, the condor&#x27;s head and neck have few feathers, which exposes the skin to the sterilizing effects of dehydration and solar ultraviolet light at high altitudes. The head is much flattened above. In the male, it is crowned with a caruncle or comb, while the skin of the neck lies in folds, forming a wattle. The head and neck skin can flush noticeably in response to the emotional state and transmitted between individuals. In Andean condors, specifically males, there is typically an extra group of skin, much like that of a turkey. Alternatively, Andean condors often have a white feather collar at the base of their head. Most California condors are without an extra plumage and display a longer neck than that of the Andean.


The middle toe is greatly elongated, the hind one is slightly developed, and the nails of all the toes are comparatively straight and blunt. The feet are thus more adapted to walking (as in their closely related storks) and of little use as weapons or organs of prehension (as in birds of prey and Old World vultures). Contrary to the usual rule among birds of prey, the female is smaller than the male.

California condors&#x27; skin on the neck varies in color, depending on the age of the birds. During the breeding season, adult birds&#x27; skin color can be cream, pink, yellow, or orange. Most commonly, Andean tend to utilize white or black skin tones, while the California condor leans towards pink.

==Fossil record==

Fossils of both extinct and extant condor species from the Pleistocene era have been found in various parts of North America, including New York and Florida, leading scientists to hypothesize that California condors (as well as their ancestors and relatives) once lived on the west coast of North America as well as to the eastern coast, until their eventual extinction/extirpation. Some scientists also have found that an ancient relative of the condor, &quot;Argentavis magnificens&quot; from South America, may have been the largest flying bird ever with a wingspan of up to twenty-four feet.

==Behavior==

Sexual maturity and breeding behavior do not appear in the condor until 5 or 6 years of age. Condors are monogamous creatures and will mate for life. They may live for 50 years or more and the world&#x27;s oldest condor died at 100 in the Jardin d&#x27;Essai du Hamma in Algiers. Condors nest with one chick at a time, laying one egg every year to year and a half. Due to their size, condors require lots of care and nutrition very early on in their chick stage.

These birds tend to be more social than other birds of prey. They often clump in smaller groups and socialize and rest together. They will often revisit the same locations for daily activities and seasonal roosts. 

The young are covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as their parents. They can fly after six months but continue to roost and hunt with their parents until age two, when they are displaced by a new clutch. There is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors; a recent study showed the &#x27;pecking order&#x27; is determined by age group and, within age groups, by sex (which contradicts previous findings).

The lack of a large sternum to anchor correspondingly large flight muscles identifies it physiologically as a primary soarer. The birds flap their wings on rising from the ground, but after attaining a moderate elevation, they seem to sail on the air, transiting from one upstream to the next, often without flapping their wings. One Andean condor was recording maintaining such flight for , for over five hours. Because of their size, these birds tend to rely on strong thermal currents to propel them higher into wind currents. 

Wild condors inhabit large territories, often traveling a day in search of carrion. With such a large wingspan these birds can sometimes can get by with one single wing flap over an hour. They prefer large carcasses, such as deer or cattle, which they spot by looking for other scavengers. However, these rival species cannot rip through the tougher hides of these larger animals with the efficiency of a larger condor. In the wild, they are intermittent eaters, often going for a few days without eating, then gorging themselves on several kilograms (pounds) at once, sometimes to the point of being unable to lift off the ground.

== Habitat ==
Each condor inhabits a very different set of locations. The Andean condor naturally resides in South America, particularly the Western coast. They range from the entirety of the coast, but tend to live towards the Andes and Patagonia mountain chains. California condors make up a different global location. As the name implies, these condors tend to live in California and the Southwest United States. Occasionally, the California condor will take up residence in Northwest Mexico. Both species tend to prefer high altitudes, roughly 16,000 feet, for habitat creation. Most commonly these species will reside on the caves or cliffsides of mountains at this altitude range. Occasionally, California condors will also nest in large redwood tree cavities. Condors instinctively choose locations that naturally protect their young from predators, like golden eagles, given the elevation and isolation. A unique component of Andean condor habitat is their

== Threats ==
Both species of condor have significant threats facing their livelihood. The IUCN defines the Andean condor as a near threatened species, while the California condor is considered endangered despite recovery programs. Human threats are currently the more dire to both species. Andean condors tend to be purposefully shot or poisoned because of prejudice or assumed connections between condors and eating cattle. Another threat to Andean condors is local belief in medicinal properties in the bones and organs of the birds, leading to hunting. Human threats are more indirect to California condors, human use of lead in bullets and other items, have become an unintentional part of the condor diet, leading to a dramatic drop in their population over the years. Currently, California has instated a breeding program to aid in recovery, and all the current wild condors are from a subset of twenty-two bred in captivity. Such efforts have led to a rise to much higher numbers for the birds. In South America similar programs have begun for the Andean condor but its success is not as vital to maintain population numbers. 

==Other==

The Moche people of ancient Peru worshiped nature. They emphasized animals and often depicted condors in their art. In Andean mythology, the Andean condor was representative of a sun deity, and often was perceived as ruling part of the higher world. Even now the bird continues to be considered a symbol of power and health.

<text>A chatbot (originally chatterbot) is a software application or web interface designed to have textual or spoken conversations. Modern chatbots are typically online and use generative artificial intelligence systems that are capable of maintaining a conversation with a user in natural language and simulating the way a human would behave as a conversational partner. Such chatbots often use deep learning and natural language processing, but simpler chatbots have existed for decades.

Although chatbots have existed since the late 1960s, the field gained widespread attention in the early 2020s due to the popularity of OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT, followed by alternatives such as Microsoft&#x27;s Copilot and Google&#x27;s Gemini. Such examples reflect the recent practice of basing such products upon broad foundational large language models, such as GPT-4 or the Gemini language model, that get fine-tuned so as to target specific tasks or applications (i.e., simulating human conversation, in the case of chatbots). Chatbots can also be designed or customized to further target even more specific situations and/or particular subject-matter domains.

A major area where chatbots have long been used is in customer service and support, with various sorts of virtual assistants. Companies spanning a wide range of industries have begun using the latest generative artificial intelligence technologies to power more advanced developments in such areas.

== History ==

=== Turing test ===
In 1950, Alan Turing&#x27;s famous article &quot;Computing Machinery and Intelligence&quot; was published, which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence. This criterion depends on the ability of a computer program to impersonate a human in a real-time written conversation with a human judge to the extent that the judge is unable to distinguish reliably—on the basis of the conversational content alone—between the program and a real human.

=== Eliza ===
The notoriety of Turing&#x27;s proposed test stimulated great interest in Joseph Weizenbaum&#x27;s program ELIZA, published in 1966, which seemed to be able to fool users into believing that they were conversing with a real human. However Weizenbaum himself did not claim that ELIZA was genuinely intelligent, and the introduction to his paper presented it more as a debunking exercise:In artificial intelligence, machines are made to behave in wondrous ways, often sufficient to dazzle even the most experienced observer. But once a particular program is unmasked, once its inner workings are explained, its magic crumbles away; it stands revealed as a mere collection of procedures. The observer says to himself &quot;I could have written that&quot;. With that thought, he moves the program in question from the shelf marked &quot;intelligent&quot;, to that reserved for curios. The object of this paper is to cause just such a re-evaluation of the program about to be &quot;explained&quot;. Few programs ever needed it more.ELIZA&#x27;s key method of operation involves the recognition of clue words or phrases in the input, and the output of the corresponding pre-prepared or pre-programmed responses that can move the conversation forward in an apparently meaningful way (e.g. by responding to any input that contains the word &#x27;MOTHER&#x27; with &#x27;TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY&#x27;). Thus an illusion of understanding is generated, even though the processing involved has been merely superficial. ELIZA showed that such an illusion is surprisingly easy to generate because human judges are ready to give the benefit of the doubt when conversational responses are &quot;capable of being interpreted&quot; as &quot;intelligent&quot;.

Interface designers have come to appreciate that humans&#x27; readiness to interpret computer output as genuinely conversational—even when it is actually based on rather simple pattern-matching—can be exploited for useful purposes. Most people prefer to engage with programs that are human-like, and this gives chatbot-style techniques a potentially useful role in interactive systems that need to elicit information from users, as long as that information is relatively straightforward and falls into predictable categories. Thus, for example, online help systems can usefully employ chatbot techniques to identify the area of help that users require, potentially providing a &quot;friendlier&quot; interface than a more formal search or menu system. This sort of usage holds the prospect of moving chatbot technology from Weizenbaum&#x27;s &quot;shelf ... reserved for curios&quot; to that marked &quot;genuinely useful computational methods&quot;.

=== Early chatbots ===
Among the most notable early chatbots are ELIZA (1966) and PARRY (1972). More recent notable programs include A.L.I.C.E., Jabberwacky and D.U.D.E (Agence Nationale de la Recherche and CNRS 2006). While ELIZA and PARRY were used exclusively to simulate typed conversation, many chatbots now include other functional features, such as games and web searching abilities. In 1984, a book called &quot;The Policeman&#x27;s Beard is Half Constructed&quot; was published, allegedly written by the chatbot Racter (though the program as released would not have been capable of doing so).

From 1978 to some time after 1983, the CYRUS project led by Janet Kolodner constructed a chatbot simulating Cyrus Vance (57th United States Secretary of State). It used case-based reasoning, and updated its database daily by parsing wire news from United Press International. The program was unable to process the news items subsequent to the surprise resignation of Cyrus Vance in April 1980, and the team constructed another chatbot simulating his successor, Edmund Muskie.

One pertinent field of AI research is natural-language processing. Usually, weak AI fields employ specialized software or programming languages created specifically for the narrow function required. For example, A.L.I.C.E. uses a markup language called AIML, which is specific to its function as a conversational agent, and has since been adopted by various other developers of, so-called, Alicebots. Nevertheless, A.L.I.C.E. is still purely based on pattern matching techniques without any reasoning capabilities, the same technique ELIZA was using back in 1966. This is not strong AI, which would require sapience and logical reasoning abilities.

Jabberwacky learns new responses and context based on real-time user interactions, rather than being driven from a static database. Some more recent chatbots also combine real-time learning with evolutionary algorithms that optimize their ability to communicate based on each conversation held.

Chatbot competitions focus on the Turing test or more specific goals. Two such annual contests are the Loebner Prize and The Chatterbox Challenge (the latter has been offline since 2015, however, materials can still be found from web archives).

DBpedia created a chatbot during the GSoC of 2017. It can communicate through Facebook Messenger (see Master of Code Global article).

=== Modern chatbots based on large language models ===
Modern chatbots like ChatGPT are often based on large language models called generative pre-trained transformers (GPT). They are based on a deep learning architecture called the transformer, which contains artificial neural networks. They learn how to generate text by being trained on a large text corpus, which provides a solid foundation for the model to perform well on downstream tasks with limited amounts of task-specific data. Despite criticism of its accuracy and tendency to &quot;hallucinate&quot;—that is, to confidently output false information and even cite non-existent sources—ChatGPT has gained attention for its detailed responses and historical knowledge. Another example is BioGPT, developed by Microsoft, which focuses on answering biomedical questions. In November 2023, Amazon announced a new chatbot, called Q, for people to use at work.

== Application ==

=== Messaging apps ===
Many companies&#x27; chatbots run on messaging apps or simply via SMS. They are used for B2C customer service, sales and marketing.

In 2016, Facebook Messenger allowed developers to place chatbots on their platform. There were 30,000 bots created for Messenger in the first six months, rising to 100,000 by September 2017.

Since September 2017, this has also been as part of a pilot program on WhatsApp. Airlines KLM and Aeroméxico both announced their participation in the testing; both airlines had previously launched customer services on the Facebook Messenger platform. 

The bots usually appear as one of the user&#x27;s contacts, but can sometimes act as participants in a group chat.

Many banks, insurers, media companies, e-commerce companies, airlines, hotel chains, retailers, health care providers, government entities, and restaurant chains have used chatbots to answer simple questions, increase customer engagement, for promotion, and to offer additional ways to order from them. Chatbots are also used in market research to collect short survey responses.

A 2017 study showed 4% of companies used chatbots. In a 2016 study, 80% of businesses said they intended to have one by 2020.

==== As part of company apps and websites ====

Previous generations of chatbots were present on company websites, e.g. Ask Jenn from Alaska Airlines which debuted in 2008 or Expedia&#x27;s virtual customer service agent which launched in 2011. The newer generation of chatbots includes IBM Watson-powered &quot;Rocky&quot;, introduced in February 2017 by the New York City-based e-commerce company Rare Carat to provide information to prospective diamond buyers.

==== Chatbot sequences ====
Used by marketers to script sequences of messages, very similar to an autoresponder sequence. Such sequences can be triggered by user opt-in or the use of keywords within user interactions. After a trigger occurs a sequence of messages is delivered until the next anticipated user response. Each user response is used in the decision tree to help the chatbot navigate the response sequences to deliver the correct response message.

=== Company internal platforms ===
Companies have used chatbots for customer support, human resources, or in Internet-of-Things (IoT) projects. Overstock.com, for one, has reportedly launched a chatbot named Mila to attempt to automate certain processes when customer service employees request sick leave. Other large companies such as Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Renault and Citroën are now using chatbots instead of call centres with humans to provide a first point of contact. In large companies, like in hospitals and aviation organizations, chatbots are also used to share information within organizations, and to assist and replace service desks.

=== Customer service ===
Chatbots have been proposed as a replacement for customer service departments. 

Deep learning techniques can be incorporated into chatbot applications to allow them to map conversations between users and customer service agents, especially in social media.

In 2019, Gartner predicted that by 2021, 15% of all customer service interactions globally will be handled completely by AI. A study by Juniper Research in 2019 estimates retail sales resulting from chatbot-based interactions will reach $112 billion by 2023.

In 2016, Russia-based Tochka Bank launched a chatbot on Facebook for a range of financial services, including a possibility of making payments. In July 2016, Barclays Africa also launched a Facebook chatbot.

In 2023, US-based National Eating Disorders Association replaced its human helpline staff with a chatbot but had to take it offline after users reported receiving harmful advice from it.

=== Healthcare ===
Chatbots are also appearing in the healthcare industry. A study suggested that physicians in the United States believed that chatbots would be most beneficial for scheduling doctor appointments, locating health clinics, or providing medication information.

ChatGPT is able to answer user queries related to health promotion and disease prevention such as screening and vaccination. WhatsApp has teamed up with the World Health Organization (WHO) to make a chatbot service that answers users&#x27; questions on COVID-19.

In 2020, the Government of India launched a chatbot called MyGov Corona Helpdesk, that worked through WhatsApp and helped people access information about the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

Certain patient groups are still reluctant to use chatbots. A mixed-methods 2019 study showed that people are still hesitant to use chatbots for their healthcare due to poor understanding of the technological complexity, the lack of empathy, and concerns about cyber-security. The analysis showed that while 6% had heard of a health chatbot and 3% had experience of using it, 67% perceived themselves as likely to use one within 12 months. The majority of participants would use a health chatbot for seeking general health information (78%), booking a medical appointment (78%), and looking for local health services (80%). However, a health chatbot was perceived as less suitable for seeking results of medical tests and seeking specialist advice such as sexual health.

The analysis of attitudinal variables showed that most participants reported their preference for discussing their health with doctors (73%) and having access to reliable and accurate health information (93%). While 80% were curious about new technologies that could improve their health, 66% reported only seeking a doctor when experiencing a health problem and 65% thought that a chatbot was a good idea. 30% reported dislike about talking to computers, 41% felt it would be strange to discuss health matters with a chatbot and about half were unsure if they could trust the advice given by a chatbot. Therefore, perceived trustworthiness, individual attitudes towards bots, and dislike for talking to computers are the main barriers to health chatbots.

=== Politics ===
In New Zealand, the chatbot SAM – short for Semantic Analysis Machine – has been developed by Nick Gerritsen of Touchtech. It is designed to share its political thoughts, for example on topics such as climate change, healthcare and education, etc. It talks to people through Facebook Messenger.

In 2022, the chatbot &quot;Leader Lars&quot; or &quot;Leder Lars&quot; was nominated for The Synthetic Party to run in the Danish parliamentary election, and was built by the artist collective Computer Lars. Leader Lars differed from earlier virtual politicians by leading a political party and by not pretending to be an objective candidate. This chatbot engaged in critical discussions on politics with users from around the world.

In India, the state government has launched a chatbot for its Aaple Sarkar platform, which provides conversational access to information regarding public services managed.

=== Toys ===
Chatbots have also been incorporated into devices not primarily meant for computing, such as toys.

&quot;Hello Barbie&quot; is an Internet-connected version of the doll that uses a chatbot provided by the company ToyTalk, which previously used the chatbot for a range of smartphone-based characters for children. These characters&#x27; behaviors are constrained by a set of rules that in effect emulate a particular character and produce a storyline.

The My Friend Cayla doll was marketed as a line of dolls which uses speech recognition technology in conjunction with an Android or iOS mobile app to recognize the child&#x27;s speech and have a conversation. Like the Hello Barbie doll, it attracted controversy due to vulnerabilities with the doll&#x27;s Bluetooth stack and its use of data collected from the child&#x27;s speech.

IBM&#x27;s Watson computer has been used as the basis for chatbot-based educational toys for companies such as &quot;CogniToys,&quot; intended to interact with children for educational purposes.

=== Malicious use ===
Malicious chatbots are frequently used to fill chat rooms with spam and advertisements by mimicking human behavior and conversations or to entice people into revealing personal information, such as bank account numbers. They were commonly found on Yahoo! Messenger, Windows Live Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger and other instant messaging protocols. There has also been a published report of a chatbot used in a fake personal ad on a dating service&#x27;s website.

Tay, an AI chatbot designed to learn from previous interaction, caused major controversy due to it being targeted by internet trolls on Twitter. Soon after its launch, the bot was exploited, and with its &quot;repeat after me&quot; capability, it started releasing racist, sexist, and controversial responses to Twitter users. This suggests that although the bot learned effectively from experience, adequate protection was not put in place to prevent misuse.

If a text-sending algorithm can pass itself off as a human instead of a chatbot, its message would be more credible. Therefore, human-seeming chatbots with well-crafted online identities could start scattering fake news that seems plausible, for instance making false claims during an election. With enough chatbots, it might be even possible to achieve artificial social proof.

=== Data security ===
Data security is one of the major concerns of chatbot technologies. Security threats and system vulnerabilities are weaknesses that are often exploited by malicious users. Storage of user data and past communication, that is highly valuable for training and development of chatbots, can also give rise to security threats. Chatbots operating on third-party networks may be subject to various security issues if owners of the third-party applications have policies regarding user data that differ from those of the chatbot. Security threats can be reduced or prevented by incorporating protective mechanisms. User authentication, chat End-to-end encryption, and self-destructing messages are some effective solutions to resist potential security threats.

== Limitations of chatbots ==

Chatbots have difficulty managing non-linear conversations that must go back and forth on a topic with a user.

Large language models are more versatile, but require a large amount of conversational data to train. These modeles generate new responses word by word based on user input, are usually trained on a large dataset of natural-language phrases. They sometimes provide plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers. They can make up names, dates, historical events, and even simple math problems. When large language models produce coherent-sounding but inaccurate or fabricated content, this is referred to as &quot;hallucinations&quot;. When humans use and apply chatbot content contaminated with hallucinations, this results in &quot;botshit&quot;. Given the increasing adoption and use of chatbots for generating content, there are concerns that this technology will significantly reduce the cost it takes humans to generate misinformation.

== Impact on jobs ==
Chatbots and technology in general used to automate repetitive tasks. But advanced chatbots like ChatGPT are also targeting high-paying, creative, and knowledge-based jobs, raising concerns about workforce disruption and quality trade-offs in favor of cost-cutting.

Chatbots are increasingly used by small and medium enterprises, to handle customer interactions efficiently, reducing reliance on large call centers and lowering operational costs.

Prompt engineering, the task of designing and refining prompts (inputs) leading to desired AI-generated responses has quickly gained significant demand with the advent of large language models, although the viability of this job is questioned due to new techniques for automating prompt engineering.

== Impact on the environment ==
Generative AI uses a high amount of electric power. Due to reliance on fossil fuels in its generation, this increases air pollution, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. In 2023, a question to ChatGPT consumed on average 10 times as much energy as a Google search. Data centres in general, and those used for AI tasks specifically, consume significant amounts of water for cooling.

<text>William Clark Styron Jr. (June 11, 1925 – November 1, 2006) was an American novelist and essayist who won major literary awards for his work.

==Early life==
Styron was born in the Hilton Village historic district of Newport News, Virginia, the son of Pauline Margaret (Abraham) and William Clark Styron. His birthplace was less than a hundred miles from the site of Nat Turner&#x27;s slave rebellion, the inspiration for Styron&#x27;s most famous and controversial novel.

Styron&#x27;s mother was from the North while his father was a Southern liberal, laying out broad racial perspectives in the household. Styron&#x27;s father, a shipyard engineer, suffered clinical depression, as would later Styron himself. In 1939, at age 14, Styron lost his mother after her decade-long battle with breast cancer.

Styron attended public school in Warwick County, first at Hilton School and then at Morrison High School (now known as Warwick High School) for two years, until his father sent him to Christchurch School, an Episcopal college-preparatory school in the Tidewater region of Virginia. Styron once said &quot;of all the schools I attended ... only Christchurch ever commanded something more than mere respect—which is to say, my true and abiding affection.&quot;

On graduation, Styron enrolled in Davidson College and joined Phi Delta Theta. By age eighteen he was reading the writers who would have a lasting influence on his own work, especially Thomas Wolfe. Styron transferred to Duke University in 1943 as a part of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps V-12 program aimed at fast-tracking officer candidates by enrolling them simultaneously in basic training and bachelor&#x27;s degree programs. There he published his first fiction, a short story heavily influenced by William Faulkner, in an anthology of student work . Styron published several short stories in the university literary magazine, &quot;The Archive&quot;, between 1944 and 1946. Though Styron was made a lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps, the Japanese surrendered before his ship left San Francisco. After the war, he returned to full-time studies at Duke and completed his Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in English in 1947.

==Career==
After graduation, Styron took an editing position with McGraw-Hill in New York City. Styron later recalled the misery of this work in an autobiographical passage of &quot;Sophie’s Choice&quot;. After provoking his employers into firing him, he set about writing his first novel in earnest. Three years later, he published the novel, &quot;Lie Down in Darkness&quot; (1951), the story of a dysfunctional Virginia family. The novel received overwhelming critical acclaim. For this novel, Styron received the Rome Prize, awarded by the American Academy in Rome and the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

===Military service===
His recall into the military due to the Korean War prevented him from immediately accepting the Rome Prize. Styron joined the Marine Corps, but was discharged in 1952 for eye problems. However, he was to transform his experience at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina into his short novel, &quot;The Long March&quot;, published serially the following year. This was adapted for the &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; episode &quot;The Long March&quot; in 1958.

===Travels in Europe===
Styron spent an extended period in Europe. In Paris, he became friends with writers Romain Gary, George Plimpton, Peter Matthiessen, James Baldwin, James Jones and Irwin Shaw, among others. In 1953, the group founded the magazine &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, which became a celebrated literary journal.

The year 1953 was eventful for Styron in another way. Finally able to take advantage of his Rome Prize, he traveled to Italy, where he became friends with Truman Capote. At the American Academy, he renewed an acquaintance with a young Baltimore poet, Rose Burgunder, to whom he had been introduced the previous fall at Johns Hopkins University. They were married in Rome in the spring of 1953.

Some of Styron&#x27;s experiences during this period inspired his third published book &quot;Set This House on Fire&quot; (1960), a novel about intellectual American expatriates on the Amalfi coast of Italy. The novel received mixed reviews in the United States, although its publisher considered it successful in terms of sales. In Europe its translation into French achieved best-seller status, far outselling the American edition.

==Nat Turner controversy==
Styron&#x27;s next two novels, published between 1967 and 1979, sparked much controversy. Feeling wounded by his first truly harsh reviews for &quot;Set This House on Fire&quot;, Styron spent the years after its publication researching and writing his next novel, the fictitious memoirs of the historical Nathaniel &quot;Nat&quot; Turner, a slave who led a slave rebellion in 1831.

During the 1960s, Styron became an eyewitness to another time of rebellion in the United States, living and writing at the heart of that turbulent decade, a time highlighted by the counterculture revolution with its political struggle, civil unrest, and racial tension. The public response to this social upheaval was furious and intense: battle lines were being drawn. In 1968, Styron signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, a vow refusing to pay taxes as a protest against the Vietnam War.

In this atmosphere of dissent, many had criticized Styron&#x27;s friend James Baldwin for his novel &quot;Another Country&quot;, published in 1962. Among the criticisms was outrage over a black author choosing a white woman as the protagonist in a story that tells of her involvement with a black man. Baldwin was Styron&#x27;s house guest for several months following the critical storm generated by &quot;Another Country&quot;. During that time, he read early drafts of Styron&#x27;s new novel, and predicted that Styron&#x27;s book would face even harsher scrutiny than &quot;Another Country&quot;. &quot;Bill&#x27;s going to catch it from both sides&quot;, he told an interviewer immediately following the 1967 publication of &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot;.

Baldwin&#x27;s prediction was correct, and despite public defenses of Styron by leading artists of the time, including Baldwin and Ralph Ellison, numerous other black critics reviled Styron&#x27;s portrayal of Turner as racist stereotyping. The historian and critic John Henrik Clarke edited and contributed to a polemical anthology, &quot;William Styron&#x27;s Nat Turner: Ten Black Writers Respond&quot;, published in 1968 by Beacon Press. Particularly controversial was a passage in which Turner fantasizes about raping a white woman. Several critics pointed to this as a dangerous perpetuation of a traditional Southern justification for lynching. Styron also writes of a situation where Turner and another slave boy have a homosexual encounter while alone in the woods. Despite the controversy, the novel was a runaway critical and financial success, and won both the 1968 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the William Dean Howells Medal in 1970.

== Benjamin Reid controversy ==
In the early 1960s, Styron became a mentor to prisoner Benjamin Reid, who in 1957 had beaten a woman to death with a hammer in a botched robbery attempt. Through his writings and advocacy, Styron successfully helped to have Reid&#x27;s death sentence commuted in 1962. In 1970, Reid escaped prison before his scheduled parole and kidnapped and raped a woman.

==&quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot;==
Styron&#x27;s next novel, &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1979),
also generated significant controversy, in part due to Styron&#x27;s decision to portray a non-Jewish victim of Nazism and in part due to its explicit sexuality and profanity. It was banned in South Africa, censored in the Soviet Union, and banned in Poland for &quot;its unflinching portrait of Polish anti-Semitism.&quot; It has also been banned in some high schools in the United States.

The novel tells the story of Sophie (a Polish Roman Catholic who survives Auschwitz), Nathan (her brilliant Jewish lover who has paranoid schizophrenia), and Stingo (a Southern transplant in post-World War II-Brooklyn who falls in love with Sophie). It won the 1980 National Book Award and was a nationwide bestseller. A 1982 film version was nominated for five Academy Awards, with Meryl Streep winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Sophie. Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol played Nathan and Stingo, respectively.

==&quot;Darkness Visible&quot;==
Styron&#x27;s readership expanded with the publication of &quot;Darkness Visible&quot; in 1990. This memoir, which began as a magazine article, chronicles the author&#x27;s descent into depression and his near-fatal night of &quot;despair beyond despair&quot;. It is a first-hand account of a major depressive episode and challenged the modern taboo on acknowledging such issues. The memoir&#x27;s goals included increasing knowledge and decreasing stigmatization of major depressive disorders and suicide. It explored the phenomenology of the disease among those with depression, their loved ones, and the general public as well. 

Earlier, in December 1989, Styron had written an op-ed for &quot;The New York Times&quot; responding to the disappointment and mystification among scholars about the apparent suicide of Primo Levi, the remarkable Italian writer who survived the Nazi death camps, but apparently had depression in his final years. Reportedly, it was the public&#x27;s unsympathetic response to Levi&#x27;s death that impelled Styron to take a more active role as an advocate for educating the public about the nature of depression and the role it played in mental health and suicide. 

Styron noted in an article for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; thatthe pain of severe depression is quite unimaginable to those who have not suffered it, and it kills in many instances because its anguish can no longer be borne. The prevention of many suicides will continue to be hindered until there is a general awareness of the nature of this pain. Through the healing process of time—and through medical intervention or hospitalization in many cases—most people survive depression, which may be its only blessing; but to the tragic legion who are compelled to destroy themselves there should be no more reproof attached than to the victims of terminal cancer.

==Later work and acclaim==

Styron was awarded the St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates.

Styron was awarded the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca in 1985.

His short story &quot;Shadrach&quot; was filmed in 1998, under the same title. It was co-directed by his daughter Susanna Styron.

Other works published during his lifetime include the play &quot;In the Clap Shack&quot; (1973), and a collection of his nonfiction, &quot;This Quiet Dust&quot; (1982).

French president François Mitterrand invited Styron to his first Presidential inauguration, and later made him a Commander of the Legion of Honor. In 1993, Styron was awarded the National Medal of Arts.

In 2002 an opera by Nicholas Maw based on &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot; premièred at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, London. Maw wrote the libretto and composed the music. He had approached Styron about writing the libretto, but Styron declined. Later the opera received a new production by stage director Markus Bothe at the Deutsche Oper Berlin and the Volksoper Wien, and had its North American premiere at the Washington National Opera in October 2006.

A collection of Styron&#x27;s papers and records is housed at the Rubenstein Library, Duke University.

In 1996 William Styron received the 1st Fitzgerald Award on the centenary of F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s birth. The F. Scott Fitzgerald Award for Achievement in American Literature award is given annually in Rockville Maryland, the city where Fitzgerald, his wife, and his daughter are buried, as part of the F. Scott Fitzgerald Literary Festival. In 1988 he was awarded the Edward MacDowell Medal.

He was a Charter member of the Fellowship of Southern Writers.

===Port Warwick street names===
The Port Warwick neighborhood of Newport News, Virginia, was named after the fictional city in Styron&#x27;s &quot;Lie Down in Darkness&quot;. The neighborhood describes itself as a &quot;mixed-use new urbanism development.&quot; The most prominent feature of Port Warwick is William Styron Square along with its two main boulevards, Loftis Boulevard and Nat Turner Boulevard, named after characters in Styron&#x27;s novels. Styron himself was appointed to design a naming system for Port Warwick, deciding to &quot;honor great American writers&quot;, resulting in Philip Roth Street, Thomas Wolfe Street, Flannery O&#x27;Connor Street, Herman Melville Avenue and others.

==Personal life and death==
In 1985, he had his first serious bout with depression. Once he recovered from his illness, Styron was able to write the memoir &quot;Darkness Visible&quot; (1990), the work for which he became best known during the last two decades of his life.

While doing a fellowship at the American Academy in Rome, Styron renewed a passing acquaintance with young Baltimore poet Rose Burgunder. They married in Rome in the spring of 1953. Together, they had four children: daughter Susanna Styron is a film director; daughter Paola is an internationally acclaimed modern dancer; daughter Alexandra is a writer, known for the 2001 novel &quot;All The Finest Girls&quot; and 2011 memoir &quot;Reading My Father: A Memoir&quot;; and son Thomas is a professor of clinical psychology at Yale University.

Styron died from pneumonia on November 1, 2006, at age 81, on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. He is buried at West Chop Cemetery in Vineyard Haven, Dukes County, Massachusetts.

<text>Gottfried Keller (19 July 1819 – 15 July 1890) was a Swiss poet and writer of German literature. Best known for his novel &quot;Green Henry&quot; (German: &quot;Der grüne Heinrich&quot;) and his cycle of novellas called &quot;Seldwyla Folks&quot; (&quot;Die Leute von Seldwyla&quot;), he became one of the most popular narrators of literary realism in the late 19th century.

==Early life==
His father was Rudolf Keller (1791–1824), a lathe-worker from Glattfelden; his mother was a woman named Elisabeth Scheuchzer (1787–1864). The couple had six children, four of whom died, meaning Keller only had his sister Regula (*1822) left. After his father died of tuberculosis, Keller&#x27;s family lived in constant poverty, and, because of Keller&#x27;s difficulties with his teachers, in continual disagreement with school authorities. Keller later gave a good rendering of his experiences in this period in his long novel, &quot;Der grüne Heinrich&quot; (1850–55; 2nd version, 1879). His mother seems to have brought him up in as carefree a condition as possible, sparing for him from her scanty meals, and allowing him the greatest possible liberty in the disposition of his time, the choice of a calling, etc. With some changes, a treatment of her relations to him may be found in his short story, “Frau Regel Amrain und ihr jüngster” (in the collection &quot;Die Leute von Seldwyla&quot;).

==Career==
Keller&#x27;s first true passion was painting. Expelled in a political mix-up from the &quot;Industrieschule&quot; in Zürich, he became an apprentice in 1834 to the landscape painter Steiger and in 1837 to the watercolourist Rudolf Meyer (1803–1857). In 1840, he went to Munich (Bavaria) to study art for a time at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts.

Keller returned to Zürich in 1842 and, although possessing artistic talent, took up writing. He published his first poems, &quot;Gedichte&quot;, in 1846. Jacob Wittmer Hartmann characterizes these six years at Zürich (1842–48) as a time of almost total inactivity, when Keller inclined strongly toward radicalism in politics, and was also subject to too much temptation and indulged himself. From 1848 to 1850 he studied at the University of Heidelberg. There he came under the influence of the philosopher Feuerbach, and extended his radicalism also to matters of religion.

From 1850 to 1856, he worked in Berlin. Hartmann claims it was chiefly this stay in Berlin which molded Keller&#x27;s character into its final shape, toned down his rather bitter pessimism to a more moderate form, and prepared him (not without the privations of hunger), in the whirl of a large city, for an enjoyment of the more restricted pleasures of his native Zürich. It was in Berlin that he turned definitely away from other pursuits and took up literature as a career.

In this period, Keller published the semi-autobiographical novel &quot;Der grüne Heinrich&quot; (&quot;Green Henry&quot;). It is the most personal of all his works. Under the influence of Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s doctrine of a return to nature, this book was at first intended to be a short narrative of the collapse of the life of a young artist. It expanded as its composition progressed into a huge work drawing on Keller&#x27;s youth and career (or more precisely &quot;non-career&quot;) as a painter up to 1842. Its reception by the literary world was cool, but the second version of 1879 is a rounded and satisfying artistic product.
He also published his first collection of short stories, &quot;Seldwyla Folks&quot; (). It contains five stories averaging 60 pages each: “Pankraz der Schmoller,” “Frau Regel Amrain und ihr jüngster,” “Die drei gerechten Kammacher,” “Romeo und Julia auf dem Dorfe,” and “Spiegel das Kätzchen.” Hartmann characterizes two of the stories in &quot;Seldwyla Folks&quot; as immortal: “Die drei gerechten Kammacher” he views as the most satyric and scorching attack on the sordid petit bourgeois morality ever penned by any writer, and “Romeo und Julia auf dem Dorfe” as one of the most pathetic tales in literature (Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; plot in a Swiss village setting).

Keller returned again to Zürich and became the &quot;First Official Secretary&quot; of the Canton of Zürich (&quot;Erster Zürcher Staatsschreiber&quot;) in 1861. The routine duties of this position were a sort of fixed point about which his artistic activities could revolve, but Hartmann opines that he produced little of permanent value in these years. In 1872, Keller published &quot;Seven Legends&quot; (&quot;Sieben Legenden&quot;), which dealt with the early Christian era. After 15 years at this post, he was retired in 1876, and began a period of literary activity that was to last to his death, living the life of an old bachelor with his sister Regula as his housekeeper. In spite of his often unsympathetic manner, his extreme reserve and idiosyncrasy in dealing with others, he had gained the affection of his fellow townspeople and an almost universal reputation before his death.

==Evaluation==
Hartmann bases Keller&#x27;s fame chiefly on 15 short stories, the five mentioned above; the five contained in the second volume of &quot;Seldwyla Folks&quot; (1874): “Die missbrauchten Liebesbriefe,” “Der Schmied seines Glücks,” “Dietegen,” “Kleider machen Leute,” and “Das verlorene Lachen”; and five in &quot;Züricher Novellen&quot; (1878): “Hadlaub,” “Der Narr auf Manegg,” “Der Landvogt von Greifensee,” “Das Fähnlein der sieben Aufrechten,” and “Ursula.” The milieu is always that of an orderly bourgeois existence, within which the most manifold human destinies, the most humorous relations develop, the most peculiar and hardy types of endurance and reticence are manifested. Some of the stories contained a note that was new in German literature and that endeared them particularly to Germans as embodying an ideal as yet unrealized in their own country: they narrate the development of character under the relatively free conditions of little Switzerland, portraying an unbureaucratic civic life and an independence of business initiative.

Also, noteworthy are his &quot;Collected Poetry&quot; (&quot;Gesammelte Gedichte&quot;) (1883), and the novel &quot;Martin Salander&quot; (1886).

==Gottfried Keller Foundation==
In 1890, shortly before the end of her tragic life, Lydia Escher (1858–1891) invested the Escher fortune in a foundation which she named after Gottfried Keller, to whom her father gave consistent support. With her remaining substantial asset – Villa Belvoir including swing and marketable securities totaling nominally 4 million Swiss Francs – Lydia Escher established the foundation&#x27;s base. According to the will of Lydia Escher, the foundation was established on 6 June 1890, and was managed by the Swiss Federal Council, thus, Lydia Escher wished to accomplish a &quot;patriotic work&quot;. The foundation should also promote the &quot;independent work of women, at least in the field of the applied Arts,&quot; according to the original intention of the founder. This purpose was adopted but at the urging of Emil Welti not in the deed of the foundation. The Gottfried Keller Foundation became though an important collection institution for art, but the feminist concerns of Lydia Escher were not met.
 The foundation, as of today based in Winterthur, is listed as a Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance.
The 200th anniversary of Keller&#x27;s birth was celebrated in 2019 with a substantial biography by Ulrich Kittstein.

<text>Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears (also known as &quot;BS&amp;T&quot;) is an American jazz rock music group founded in New York City in 1967, noted for a combination of brass with rock instrumentation. BS&amp;T has gone through numerous iterations with varying personnel and has encompassed a wide range of musical styles. Their sound has merged rock, pop and R&amp;B/soul music with big band jazz.

The group&#x27;s self-titled second album spent seven weeks atop the U.S. charts in 1969 and won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1970. It contained the hit recordings &quot;And When I Die&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Made Me So Very Happy&quot;, and &quot;Spinning Wheel&quot;. All of these peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The follow-up album, &quot;Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears 3&quot;, also reached number one in the U.S.

In addition to original music, the group is known for arrangements of popular songs by Laura Nyro, James Taylor, Carole King, the Band, the Rolling Stones, Billie Holiday and many others. The group has also adapted music from Erik Satie, Thelonious Monk and Sergei Prokofiev into their arrangements.

The group was inspired by the &quot;brass-rock&quot; of the Buckinghams and their producer, James William Guercio, as well as the Maynard Ferguson Orchestra. BS&amp;T&#x27;s success paralleled that of similarly configured ensembles such as Chicago (another group produced by Guercio) and the Electric Flag, but by the mid-1970s the group&#x27;s popularity had declined.

== History ==

=== Al Kooper era ===
Al Kooper (keyboards, vocals), Bobby Colomby (drums), Steve Katz (guitar, vocals), and Jim Fielder (bass) played at the Village Theatre (later renamed Fillmore East) in New York City on September 16, 1967, with James Cotton Blues Band opening. Kooper was the initial singer and musical director, having insisted on that position based on his work with the Blues Project, his previous band with Katz.

Fred Lipsius (alto sax, piano) joined the others a month later. A few more shows were played before Lipsius recruited horn players Dick Halligan, Randy Brecker, and Jerry Weiss. The octet debuted at the Cafe Au Go Go on November 17–19, 1967, then played The Scene the following week. Audiences were impressed with the innovative fusion of contemporary styles. After signing to Columbia Records, the group released &quot;Child Is Father to the Man&quot; which reached number 47 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart in the United States.

Artistic differences quickly developed. Colomby and Katz wanted to hire a stronger lead vocalist. This led to the departure of Kooper in April 1968. Prior to leaving Kooper had already arranged some songs that would be on the second BS&amp;T album. He was soon hired as a record producer at Columbia. Trumpeters Randy Brecker and Jerry Weiss also left and were replaced by Lew Soloff and Chuck Winfield. Brecker joined Horace Silver&#x27;s band. Jerry Weiss went on to start the similarly styled group Ambergris.

=== David Clayton-Thomas era ===
Colomby and Katz looked for a new vocalist and considered Alex Chilton, Stephen Stills, and Laura Nyro, before deciding on David Clayton-Thomas, a Canadian from Toronto. Trombonist Halligan moved to organ and Jerry Hyman was added on trombone. The new nine-member band debuted at New York&#x27;s Cafe Au Go Go on June 18, 1968, beginning a two-week residency.

The self-titled second album, &quot;Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears&quot;, was produced by Guercio and much of the album was arranged by Lipsius. It featured fewer original songs but greater chart success. It included Nyro&#x27;s &quot;And When I Die&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Made Me So Very Happy&quot; by Berry Gordy and Brenda Holloway, and Clayton-Thomas&#x27; &quot;Spinning Wheel&quot;. The band enjoyed headliner status at the Woodstock Festival in August 1969. A film crew caught a few songs, but the band&#x27;s manager Bennett Glotzer ordered the crew to turn off the cameras and leave the stage since the band had not agreed nor been paid for filming.

The band went on a United States Department of State-sponsored tour of Eastern Europe in May/June 1970. Voluntary association with the U.S. government was highly unpopular with &quot;underground&quot; rock fans at the time, some of whom engaged in radical politics. The band was criticized for allowing itself to be co-opted. It is now known that the State Department subtly pressured the group into the tour in exchange for a U.S. residency permit to Clayton-Thomas, who had a criminal record in Canada, and had been deported from the U.S. after overstaying his visa. The tour and its aftermath is the focus of a 2023 feature-length documentary titled &quot;What the Hell Happened to Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears?&quot;

After returning to the U.S., the group released &quot;Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears 3&quot; in June 1970, produced by Roy Halee and Colomby. The album was another success, spawning hit singles with Carole King&#x27;s &quot;Hi-De-Ho&quot; and another Clayton-Thomas composition, &quot;Lucretia MacEvil&quot;. The group recreated the formula with more arrangements by Lipsius. Reviews sometimes focused solely upon the band&#x27;s work with the U.S. State Department, without discussing the music. Compounding the image problem was a decision to play a lucrative engagement at Caesars Palace on the Las Vegas Strip. This was unpopular with young underground rock fans who identified Las Vegas entertainers with the music of their parents&#x27; generation.

In late 1970, the band produced soundtrack music for the film comedy &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat &quot;, which starred Barbra Streisand and George Segal.

The group reconvened in San Francisco in January 1971 with jazz writer/saxophonist Don Heckman serving as producer. With Dave Bargeron replacing Jerry Hyman, they recorded the fourth album, &quot;BS&amp;T 4&quot;, released in June 1971. Notable tracks included David Clayton-Thomas&#x27; &quot;Go Down Gamblin&#x27;&quot; and Al Kooper&#x27;s &quot;Holy John (John the Baptist)&quot;. &quot;BS&amp;T 4&quot; earned the group a gold record, however, none of the singles reached the Top 30. During this period the group&#x27;s popular and commercial success began to decline.

After a final show at Anaheim Convention Center on December 31, 1971, Clayton-Thomas left in early January 1972 to pursue a solo career. Columbia issued a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album in February 1972. This album contained edited single versions of some songs, rather than the full-length album versions. It earned a gold record award in the US, the last BS&amp;T album to do so.

=== Jerry Fisher era ===

Clayton-Thomas was briefly replaced by Bobby Doyle and then Jerry Fisher. Fred Lipsius left as well and was briefly replaced by Joe Henderson, before Lou Marini settled into the new lineup. Founding member Halligan also departed, replaced by jazz pianist Larry Willis (from the Cannonball Adderley Quintet), and Swedish guitarist Georg Wadenius, from the popular Swedish outfit Made in Sweden, joined as lead guitarist around the same time.

BS&amp;T released &quot;New Blood&quot; in September 1972, which found the group moving into a more overtly jazz-fusion direction. The album reached the top 40 on the Billboard chart and spawned a hit single &quot;So Long Dixie&quot;, which peaked at number 44. Also included was a version of Herbie Hancock&#x27;s &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot;, featuring Wadenius. In January 1973 Katz left to pursue a career as a producer. In March, Winfield departed as well and was replaced by Tom Malone.

The next album, &quot;No Sweat&quot; (June 1973), featured horn work from Tom Malone. He soon left to make way for trumpeter John Madrid. But Madrid was likewise short-lived and he never recorded with the band. Both Madrid and Soloff left in late 1973, making way for new horn player/arranger Tony Klatka on the next release, &quot;Mirror Image&quot; (July 1974), which also saw the addition of vocalist/saxophonist Jerry LaCroix (formerly of Edgar Winter&#x27;s White Trash), sax player Bill Tillman, bassist Ron McClure and the exodus of original bass player Jim Fielder. This album shows the influences of Philly Soul, Herbie Hancock&#x27;s Head Hunters, and Chick Corea&#x27;s group Return to Forever.

Jerry LaCroix left BS&amp;T to join Rare Earth after playing a final show at Wollman Rink in New York&#x27;s Central Park on July 27, 1974. Luther Kent, a blues singer from New Orleans replaced LaCroix.

=== Reformations ===

By the close of 1974 Jerry Fisher was tired of BS&amp;T&#x27;s heavy touring schedule. Colomby and manager Fred Heller engineered the return of Clayton-Thomas in the hope of restoring the band&#x27;s former success. Clayton-Thomas met the group in Milwaukee while Jerry Fisher and Luther Kent were still with the band. All three singers appeared on stage before a wildly enthusiastic crowd.

The album &quot;New City&quot;, in April 1975, featured Clayton-Thomas along with new horn player Joe Giorgianni. It reached number 47 on the US Billboard album chart. The album has half original material along with songs from Janis Ian, Randy Newman, and Blues Image. The highest-charting song was the Beatles’ “Got to Get You into My Life&quot; which peaked at number 62.
In the summer of 1975, BS&amp;T recorded a live album that was released in Europe and Japan the following year as &quot;In Concert&quot;. The album was released in the US as &quot;Live and Improvised&quot; in May 1991. The album featured different guitarists on different nights: Wadenius, Steve Khan and Mike Stern, the last who took over permanently for a time (Jeff Richman filled in for Stern in mid-1976). Jazz percussionist Don Alias was also present for the live album. After recording, Giorgianni left and was replaced by Forrest Buchtel (formerly of Woody Herman&#x27;s band).

Around the same time, Colomby discovered a talented bass player by the name of Jaco Pastorius in Florida. He produced Pastorius&#x27; first solo album which was released in the spring of 1976. In late 1975, Pastorius toured with BS&amp;T subbing for Ron McClure and when McClure left in early 1976, Colomby arranged for Pastorius to join the band, though he stayed for only about three months. On April 1, 1976, Pastorius joined Weather Report. Pastorius was briefly succeeded by Keith Jones before Danny Trifan stepped in.

In 1975 the group was offered a slot at the Newport Jazz Festival in Newport, Rhode Island. The city government was concerned that a &quot;rock band&quot; would attract a rowdy audience; it threatened to revoke the concert permit if BS&amp;T was not removed from the program. Ultimately, concert organizers were able to force the event forward via judicial injunction. The litigation reached the United States Supreme Court.

In July 1976 &quot;More Than Ever&quot;, produced by Bob James and featuring guest vocals by Patti Austin and appearances by a host of NYC session players, including pianist Richard Tee, guitarists Eric Gale and Hugh McCracken, trumpeter Jon Faddis and Eric Weissberg (banjo, dobro), was released but sold disappointingly. After it stalled at US No. 165, Columbia Records dropped the band. At this time Colomby, BS&amp;T&#x27;s sole remaining original member, stopped touring with the group and Don Alias assumed sole percussion duties before leaving as well to make way for Roy McCurdy.

In 1977, BS&amp;T signed with ABC Records and began working on &quot;Brand New Day&quot; (November 1977). The album was co-produced by Colomby, but his direct involvement with the group ceased after this release. Colomby was by this point the sole owner of the BS&amp;T trademark name. &quot;Brand New Day&quot; garnered positive reviews but slow sales. At this same time BS&amp;T were said to be recording tracks for an instrumental album with a personnel of Tony Klatka, Forrest Buchtel, Dave Bargeron, Bill Tillman, Larry Willis, Danny Trifan, Roy McCurdy and Mike Stern, but the album never appeared.

During 1977 the BS&amp;T lineup was again in flux. Stern, Trifan, McCurdy, Buchtel and Tillman all departed to be succeeded respectively by Randy Bernsen, Neil Stubenhaus, Michael Lawrence and Gregory Herbert. Barry Finnerty then took over guitar and Chris Albert trumpet when Bernsen and Lawrence left at the close of the year.

In January 1978, the group undertook a European tour that ended abruptly after 31-year-old saxophonist Gregory Herbert died of a drug overdose in Amsterdam on January 31, 1978. Rocked by the event, the group returned home.

In 1979, with the encouragement of longtime BS&amp;T manager Fred Heller, who had numerous requests for the band to play more shows, Clayton-Thomas decided to continue Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears with an entirely new lineup that consisted of himself and other Canadian musicians (Kenny Marco – guitar, David Piltch – bass, Joe Sealy – keyboards, Bruce Cassidy – trumpet, flugelhorn, Earl Seymour – sax, flute, Steve Kennedy – sax, flute and Sally Chappis – drums, with Harvey Kogan soon replacing Kennedy and Jack Scarangella succeeding Chappis).

The group signed to Avenue Records subsidiary label LAX (MCA Records), with a slightly altered lineup of: David Clayton-Thomas (vocals, guitar), Robert Piltch (guitar), David Piltch (bass), Richard Martinez (keyboards), Bruce Cassidy (trumpet, flugelhorn), Earl Seymour (sax, flute), Vernon Dorge (sax, flute) and a returning Bobby Economou on drums, and with producer and arranger Jerry Goldstein, recorded the album &quot;Nuclear Blues&quot; (March 1980). The album was yet another attempt to reinvent the group, showcasing the band in a funk sound environment that recalled such acts as Tower of Power and LAX labelmates War (with whom BS&amp;T did several shows in 1980). The album was regarded by many Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears fans as uncharacteristic of the group&#x27;s best work.

During this period, another live album was recorded at The Street Scene in Los Angeles, California on October 12, 1980 (this was eventually released as &quot;Live&quot; in February 1995). Robert and David Piltch left shortly before this concert, as did Richard Martinez. They were replaced by Wayne Pedzwiatr on bass, Peter Harris on guitar and Lou Pomanti on keyboards. And Mic Gillette (from Tower of Power) replaced Cassidy on trumpet at the tail end of 1980. Following more touring, including Australia, this incarnation of the group disbanded in 1981.

Since he did not own the rights to the Blood Sweat &amp; Tears name, Clayton-Thomas attempted to restart his solo career in 1983 after taking some time off. This caused complications on the road when promoters would book Clayton-Thomas&#x27; group and use the Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears name on the marquee. Consequently, his manager Larry Dorr negotiated a licensing deal with Colomby in 1984 for rights to tour with the BS&amp;T name.

For 20 years afterwards, Clayton-Thomas toured the concert circuit with a constantly changing roster of players (see roster below) as &quot;Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears&quot; until his final departure in November 2004. Clayton-Thomas, now residing back in Canada, continues his solo career and does occasional shows using only his name.

In 1998, to celebrate thirty years after he first joined the group, David Clayton-Thomas began work on a solo CD titled &quot;Bloodlines&quot; that featured a dozen former members of Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, (Tony Klatka, Fred Lipsius, Lew Soloff, Dave Bargeron, Randy Brecker and others) performing on the album and providing arrangements to some of the songs. Released in 1999, it was first only available at Clayton-Thomas&#x27; concerts but made more widely available in 2001.

BS&amp;T continued without Clayton-Thomas. Dorr has been manager (and much more) for over 30 years now, and the band is still a popular touring act. At last count, the overall number of BS&amp;T members since the beginning is up around 165 total people (see roster below).

On March 12 and 13, 1993, Al Kooper organized two shows at the Bottom Line in NYC that were advertised as &quot;A Silver Anniversary Celebration of the Classic Album The Child Is Father to the Man&quot;, which featured Kooper, Randy Brecker, Jim Fielder, Steve Katz and Fred Lipsius playing together for the first time in 25 years, accompanied by Anton Fig, Tom Malone, Lew Soloff, John Simon and Jimmy Vivino, as well as a two-woman chorus and string section.

The following year, in early February 1994, Kooper returned to the Bottom Line for his 50th birthday celebration, in which he played with members of his new band plus the Blues Project &amp; BS&amp;T. The BS&amp;T lineup at this show was the same as the 1993 Silver Anniversary show, with the exception of Will Lee sitting in for Fielder and John Sebastian (ex-Loving Spoonful) contributing harmonica. Colomby would not allow Kooper to use the name Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, so the two reunions were billed as &quot;Child Is Father To The Man&quot;. This second show appeared as the CD &quot;Soul of a Man&quot; in 1995. According to page 20 of the CD&#x27;s liner notes, Steve Katz elected not to allow his performances onto the CD, which were digitally replaced by Jimmy Vivino. Bassist Jim Fielder is said to have added some parts to the CD as well.

Since late 2005, the band resumed touring with a refreshed line up. The band&#x27;s first world tour in a decade took place in 2007. From 2008 through 2010, Katz returned to appear at BS&amp;T&#x27;s shows as a special guest. BS&amp;T and Chicago co-headlined a Jazz festival in Stuttgart, Germany on July 9, 2011, and they also appeared on the same bill together again at Gretna Heritage Festival in Gretna, Louisiana on October 5, 2013.

From 2013 until 2018, Blood Sweat and Tears was fronted by Bo Bice, who was the runner-up against Carrie Underwood in the fourth season of &quot;American Idol&quot;.

In 2018 the group decided to replace Bice with former Tower of Power singer Tom Bowes, who had previously done a brief stint with BS&amp;T back in July through November 2012. In 2019 Keith Paluso, from the reality TV show &quot;The Voice&quot;, was chosen as BS&amp;T&#x27;s new singer

In March 2022 original bassist Jim Fielder guested with the group at a series of shows in Florida.

Under the direction of Dorr and Colomby, the band has enjoyed something of a resurgence. Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears donated money through its &quot;Elsie Monica Colomby&quot; music scholarship fund to deserving schools and students who need help in prolonging their musical education, such as the victims of Hurricane Katrina.

<text>Ancient Greek (, ; ) includes the forms of the Greek language used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around 1500 BC to 300 BC. It is often roughly divided into the following periods: Mycenaean Greek (), Dark Ages (), the Archaic or Homeric period (), and the Classical period ().

Ancient Greek was the language of Homer and of fifth-century Athenian historians, playwrights, and philosophers. It has contributed many words to English vocabulary and has been a standard subject of study in educational institutions of the Western world since the Renaissance. This article primarily contains information about the Epic and Classical periods of the language, which are the best-attested periods and considered most typical of Ancient Greek.

From the Hellenistic period (), Ancient Greek was followed by Koine Greek, which is regarded as a separate historical stage, though its earliest form closely resembles Attic Greek, and its latest form approaches Medieval Greek, and Koine may be classified as Ancient Greek in a wider sense. There were several regional dialects of Ancient Greek; Attic Greek developed into Koine.

==Dialects==

Ancient Greek was a pluricentric language, divided into many dialects. The main dialect groups are Attic and Ionic, Aeolic, Arcadocypriot, and Doric, many of them with several subdivisions. Some dialects are found in standardized literary forms in literature, while others are attested only in inscriptions.

There are also several historical forms. Homeric Greek is a literary form of Archaic Greek (derived primarily from Ionic and Aeolic) used in the epic poems, the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and in later poems by other authors. Homeric Greek had significant differences in grammar and pronunciation from Classical Attic and other Classical-era dialects.

===History===
The origins, early form and development of the Hellenic language family are not well understood because of a lack of contemporaneous evidence. Several theories exist about what Hellenic dialect groups may have existed between the divergence of early Greek-like speech from the common Proto-Indo-European language and the Classical period. They have the same general outline but differ in some of the detail. The only attested dialect from this period is Mycenaean Greek, but its relationship to the historical dialects and the historical circumstances of the times imply that the overall groups already existed in some form.

Scholars assume that major Ancient Greek period dialect groups developed not later than 1120 BC, at the time of the Dorian invasions—and that their first appearances as precise alphabetic writing began in the 8th century BC. The invasion would not be &quot;Dorian&quot; unless the invaders had some cultural relationship to the historical Dorians. The invasion is known to have displaced population to the later Attic-Ionic regions, who regarded themselves as descendants of the population displaced by or contending with the Dorians.

The Greeks of this period believed there were three major divisions of all Greek people – Dorians, Aeolians, and Ionians (including Athenians), each with their own defining and distinctive dialects. Allowing for their oversight of Arcadian, an obscure mountain dialect, and Cypriot, far from the center of Greek scholarship, this division of people and language is quite similar to the results of modern archaeological-linguistic investigation.

One standard formulation for the dialects is:

* West Group
** Northwest Greek
** Doric
* Aeolic Group
** Aegean/Asiatic Aeolic
** Thessalian
** Boeotian
* Ionic-Attic Group
** Attic
** Ionic
*** Euboean and colonies in Italy
*** Cycladic
*** Asiatic Ionic
* Arcadocypriot Greek
** Arcadian
** Cypriot
West vs. non-West Greek is the strongest-marked and earliest division, with non-West in subsets of Ionic-Attic (or Attic-Ionic) and Aeolic vs. Arcadocypriot, or Aeolic and Arcado-Cypriot vs. Ionic-Attic. Often non-West is called &#x27;East Greek&#x27;.

Arcadocypriot apparently descended more closely from the Mycenaean Greek of the Bronze Age.

Boeotian Greek had come under a strong Northwest Greek influence, and can in some respects be considered a transitional dialect, as exemplified in the poems of the Boeotian poet Pindar who wrote in Doric with a small Aeolic admixture. Thessalian likewise had come under Northwest Greek influence, though to a lesser degree.

Pamphylian Greek, spoken in a small area on the southwestern coast of Anatolia and little preserved in inscriptions, may be either a fifth major dialect group, or it is Mycenaean Greek overlaid by Doric, with a non-Greek native influence. 

Regarding the speech of the ancient Macedonians diverse theories have been put forward, but the epigraphic activity and the archaeological discoveries in the Greek region of Macedonia during the last decades has brought to light documents, among which the first texts written in Macedonian, such as the Pella curse tablet, as Hatzopoulos and other scholars note. Based on the conclusions drawn by several studies and findings such as Pella curse tablet, Emilio Crespo and other scholars suggest that ancient Macedonian was a Northwest Doric dialect, which shares isoglosses with its neighboring Thessalian dialects spoken in northeastern Thessaly. Some have also suggested an Aeolic Greek classification.

The Lesbian dialect was Aeolic. For example, fragments of the works of the poet Sappho from the island of Lesbos are in Aeolian.

Most of the dialect sub-groups listed above had further subdivisions, generally equivalent to a city-state and its surrounding territory, or to an island. Doric notably had several intermediate divisions as well, into Island Doric (including Cretan Doric), Southern Peloponnesus Doric (including Laconian, the dialect of Sparta), and Northern Peloponnesus Doric (including Corinthian).

All the groups were represented by colonies beyond Greece proper as well, and these colonies generally developed local characteristics, often under the influence of settlers or neighbors speaking different Greek dialects.

After the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late 4th century BC, a new international dialect known as Koine or Common Greek developed, largely based on Attic Greek, but with influence from other dialects. This dialect slowly replaced most of the older dialects, although the Doric dialect has survived in the Tsakonian language, which is spoken in the region of modern Sparta. Doric has also passed down its aorist terminations into most verbs of Demotic Greek. By about the 6th century AD, the Koine had slowly metamorphosed into Medieval Greek.

===Related languages===
Phrygian is an extinct Indo-European language of West and Central Anatolia, which is considered by some linguists to have been closely related to Greek. Among Indo-European branches with living descendants, Greek is often argued to have the closest genetic ties with Armenian (see also Graeco-Armenian) and Indo-Iranian languages (see Graeco-Aryan).

==Phonology==

===Differences from Proto-Indo-European===

Ancient Greek differs from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) and other Indo-European languages in certain ways. In phonotactics, ancient Greek words could end only in a vowel or ; final stops were lost, as in &quot;milk&quot;, compared with &quot;of milk&quot; (genitive). Ancient Greek of the classical period also differed in both the inventory and distribution of original PIE phonemes due to numerous sound changes, notably the following:
* PIE became at the beginning of a word (debuccalization): Latin &quot;&quot;, English &quot;six&quot;, ancient Greek .
* PIE was elided between vowels after an intermediate step of debuccalization: Sanskrit &#x27;, Latin &#x27; (where &quot;s&quot; &gt; &quot;r&quot; by rhotacism), Greek * &gt; * &gt; ancient Greek (), Attic () &quot;of a kind&quot;.
* PIE became (debuccalization) or (fortition): Sanskrit &#x27;, ancient Greek &quot;who&quot; (relative pronoun); Latin &#x27;, English &quot;yoke&quot;, ancient Greek .
* PIE , which occurred in Mycenaean and some non-Attic dialects, was lost: early Doric , English &quot;work&quot;, Attic Greek .
* PIE and Mycenaean labiovelars changed to plain stops (labials, dentals, and velars) in the later Greek dialects: for instance, PIE became or in Attic: Attic Greek &quot;where?&quot;, Latin &#x27;; Attic Greek , Latin &#x27; &quot;who?&quot;.
* PIE &quot;voiced aspirated&quot; stops were devoiced and became the aspirated stops in ancient Greek.

===Phonemic inventory===

The pronunciation of Ancient Greek was very different from that of Modern Greek. Ancient Greek had long and short vowels; many diphthongs; double and single consonants; voiced, voiceless, and aspirated stops; and a pitch accent. In Modern Greek, all vowels and consonants are short. Many vowels and diphthongs once pronounced distinctly are pronounced as (iotacism). Some of the stops and glides in diphthongs have become fricatives, and the pitch accent has changed to a stress accent. Many of the changes took place in the Koine Greek period. The writing system of Modern Greek, however, does not reflect all pronunciation changes.

The examples below represent Attic Greek in the 5th century BC. Ancient pronunciation cannot be reconstructed with certainty, but Greek from the period is well documented, and there is little disagreement among linguists as to the general nature of the sounds that the letters represent.

====Consonants====
:1 occurred as an allophone of that was used before velars and as an allophone of before nasals.
:2 was assimilated to before voiced consonants.
:3 was earlier written , but when the same letter (eta) was co-opted to stand for a vowel, was dropped from writing, to be restored later in the form of a diacritic, the rough breathing.
:4 was probably a voiceless when word-initially and geminated (written and ).

====Vowels====
 raised to , probably by the 4th century BC.

==Morphology==

Greek, like all of the older Indo-European languages, is highly inflected. It is highly archaic in its preservation of Proto-Indo-European forms. In ancient Greek, nouns (including proper nouns) have five cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and vocative), three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), and three numbers (singular, dual, and plural). Verbs have four moods (indicative, imperative, subjunctive, and optative) and three voices (active, middle, and passive), as well as three persons (first, second, and third) and various other forms. 

Verbs are conjugated through seven combinations of tenses and aspect (generally simply called &quot;tenses&quot;): the present, future, and imperfect are imperfective in aspect; the aorist, present perfect, pluperfect and future perfect are perfective in aspect. Most tenses display all four moods and three voices, although there is no future subjunctive or imperative. Also, there is no imperfect subjunctive, optative or imperative. The infinitives and participles correspond to the finite combinations of tense, aspect, and voice.

===Augment===
The indicative of past tenses adds (conceptually, at least) a prefix /e-/, called the augment. This was probably originally a separate word, meaning something like &quot;then&quot;, added because tenses in PIE had primarily aspectual meaning. The augment is added to the indicative of the aorist, imperfect, and pluperfect, but not to any of the other forms of the aorist (no other forms of the imperfect and pluperfect exist).

The two kinds of augment in Greek are syllabic and quantitative. The syllabic augment is added to stems beginning with consonants, and simply prefixes &quot;e&quot; (stems beginning with &quot;r&quot;, however, add &quot;er&quot;). The quantitative augment is added to stems beginning with vowels, and involves lengthening the vowel:
* a, ā, e, ē → ē
* i, ī → ī
* o, ō → ō
* u, ū → ū
* ai → ēi
* ei → ēi or ei
* oi → ōi
* au → ēu or au
* eu → ēu or eu
* ou → ou

Some verbs augment irregularly; the most common variation is &quot;e&quot; → &quot;ei&quot;. The irregularity can be explained diachronically by the loss of &quot;s&quot; between vowels, or that of the letter &quot;w&quot;, which affected the augment when it was word-initial.
In verbs with a preposition as a prefix, the augment is placed not at the start of the word, but between the preposition and the original verb. For example, (I attack) goes to in the aorist. However compound verbs consisting of a prefix that is not a preposition retain the augment at the start of the word: goes to in the aorist.

Following Homer&#x27;s practice, the augment is sometimes not made in poetry, especially epic poetry.

The augment sometimes substitutes for reduplication; see below.

===Reduplication===
Almost all forms of the perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect reduplicate the initial syllable of the verb stem. (A few irregular forms of perfect do not reduplicate, whereas a handful of irregular aorists reduplicate.) The three types of reduplication are:
* Syllabic reduplication: Most verbs beginning with a single consonant, or a cluster of a stop with a sonorant, add a syllable consisting of the initial consonant followed by &quot;e&quot;. An aspirated consonant, however, reduplicates in its unaspirated equivalent (see Grassmann&#x27;s law).
* Augment: Verbs beginning with a vowel, as well as those beginning with a cluster other than those indicated previously (and occasionally for a few other verbs) reduplicate in the same fashion as the augment. This remains in all forms of the perfect, not just the indicative.
* Attic reduplication: Some verbs beginning with an &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot; or &quot;o&quot;, followed by a sonorant (or occasionally &quot;d&quot; or &quot;g&quot;), reduplicate by adding a syllable consisting of the initial vowel and following consonant, and lengthening the following vowel. Hence &quot;er&quot; → &quot;erēr&quot;, &quot;an&quot; → &quot;anēn&quot;, &quot;ol&quot; → &quot;olōl&quot;, &quot;ed&quot; → &quot;edēd&quot;. This is not specific to Attic Greek, despite its name, but it was generalized in Attic. This originally involved reduplicating a cluster consisting of a laryngeal and sonorant, hence with normal Greek development of laryngeals. (Forms with a stop were analogous.)

Irregular duplication can be understood diachronically. For example, (root ) has the perfect stem (not *) because it was originally , with perfect , becoming through compensatory lengthening.

Reduplication is also visible in the present tense stems of certain verbs. These stems add a syllable consisting of the root&#x27;s initial consonant followed by &quot;i&quot;. A nasal stop appears after the reduplication in some verbs.

==Writing system==

The earliest extant examples of ancient Greek writing () are in the syllabic script Linear B. Beginning in the 8th century BC, however, the Greek alphabet became standard, albeit with some variation among dialects. Early texts are written in boustrophedon style, but left-to-right became standard during the classic period. Modern editions of ancient Greek texts are usually written with accents and breathing marks, interword spacing, modern punctuation, and sometimes mixed case, but these were all introduced later.

==Sample texts==
The beginning of Homer&#x27;s Iliad exemplifies the Archaic period of ancient Greek (see Homeric Greek for more details):
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

The beginning of Apology by Plato exemplifies Attic Greek from the Classical period of ancient Greek. (The second line is the IPA, the third is transliterated into the Latin alphabet using a modern version of the Erasmian scheme.)

==Modern use==
===In education===
The study of Ancient Greek in European countries in addition to Latin occupied an important place in the syllabus from the Renaissance until the beginning of the 20th century. This was true as well in the United States, where many of the nation&#x27;s Founders received a classically based education.
Latin was emphasized in American colleges, but Greek also was required in the Colonial and Early National eras, and the study of ancient Greece became increasingly popular in the mid-to-late Nineteenth Century, the age of American philhellenism. In particular, female intellectuals of the era designated the mastering of ancient Greek as essential in becoming a &quot;woman of letters.&quot;
Ancient Greek is still taught as a compulsory or optional subject especially at traditional or elite schools throughout Europe, such as public schools and grammar schools in the United Kingdom. It is compulsory in the liceo classico in Italy, in the in the Netherlands, in some classes in Austria, in (grammar school – orientation: classical languages) in Croatia, in classical studies in ASO in Belgium and it is optional in the humanities-oriented &quot;gymnasium&quot; in Germany, usually as a third language after Latin and English, from the age of 14 to 18. In 2006/07, 15,000 pupils studied ancient Greek in Germany according to the Federal Statistical Office of Germany, and 280,000 pupils studied it in Italy. 

It is a compulsory subject alongside Latin in the humanities branch of the Spanish Baccalaureate. Ancient Greek is taught at most major universities worldwide, often combined with Latin as part of the study of classics. In 2010 it was offered in three primary schools in the UK, to boost children&#x27;s language skills, and was one of seven foreign languages which primary schools could teach 2014 as part of a major drive to boost education standards.

Ancient Greek is taught as a compulsory subject in all gymnasiums and lyceums in Greece. Starting in 2001, an annual international competition () was run for upper secondary students through the Greek Ministry of National Education and Religious Affairs, with Greek language and cultural organisations as co-organisers. It appears to have ceased in , having failed to gain the recognition and acceptance of teachers.

===Modern real-world usage===
Modern authors rarely write in ancient Greek, though Jan Křesadlo wrote some poetry and prose in the language, and &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, some volumes of Asterix, and &quot;The Adventures of Alix&quot; have been translated into ancient Greek. (&quot;Onomata Kechiasmena&quot;) is the first magazine of crosswords and puzzles in ancient Greek. Its first issue appeared in April 2015 as an annex to &quot;Hebdomada Aenigmatum&quot;. Alfred Rahlfs included a preface, a short history of the Septuagint text, and other front matter translated into ancient Greek in his 1935 edition of the Septuagint; Robert Hanhart also included the introductory remarks to the 2006 revised Rahlfs–Hanhart edition in the language as well. Akropolis World News reports weekly a summary of the most important news in ancient Greek.

Ancient Greek is also used by organizations and individuals, mainly Greek, who wish to denote their respect, admiration or preference for the use of this language. This use is sometimes considered graphical, nationalistic or humorous. In any case, the fact that modern Greeks can still wholly or partly understand texts written in non-archaic forms of ancient Greek shows the affinity of the modern Greek language to its ancestral predecessor.

Ancient Greek is often used in the coinage of modern technical terms in the European languages: see English words of Greek origin. Latinized forms of ancient Greek roots are used in many of the scientific names of species and in scientific terminology.

<text>A dendritic cell (DC) is an antigen-presenting cell (also known as an &quot;accessory cell&quot;) of the mammalian immune system. A DC&#x27;s main function is to process antigen material and present it on the cell surface to the T cells of the immune system. They act as messengers between the innate and adaptive immune systems.

Dendritic cells are present in tissues that are in contact with the body&#x27;s external environment, such as the skin (where there is a specialized dendritic cell type called the Langerhans cell), and the inner lining of the nose, lungs, stomach and intestines. They can also be found in an immature and mature state in the blood. Once activated, they migrate to the lymph nodes, where they interact with T cells and B cells to initiate and shape the adaptive immune response. At certain development stages they grow branched projections, the &quot;dendrites,&quot; that give the cell its name (δένδρον or déndron being Greek for &#x27;tree&#x27;). While similar in appearance to the dendrites of neurons, these are structures distinct from them. Immature dendritic cells are also called veiled cells, as they possess large cytoplasmic &#x27;veils&#x27; rather than dendrites.

==History==
Dendritic cells were first described by Paul Langerhans (hence &quot;Langerhans cells&quot;) in the late nineteenth century. The term &quot;dendritic cells&quot; was coined in 1973 by Ralph M. Steinman and Zanvil A. Cohn. For discovering the central role of dendritic cells in the adaptive immune response, Steinman was awarded the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 2007 and the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2011.

==Types==
The morphology of dendritic cells results in a very large surface-to-volume ratio. That is, the dendritic cell has a very large surface area compared to the overall cell volume.

===&quot;In vivo&quot; – primate===

The most common division of dendritic cells is conventional dendritic cells (a.k.a. myeloid dendritic cells) vs. plasmacytoid dendritic cell (most likely of lymphoid lineage) as described in the table below:

The markers BDCA-2, BDCA-3, and BDCA-4 can be used to discriminate among the types.

Lymphoid and myeloid DCs evolve from lymphoid and myeloid precursors, respectively, and thus are of hematopoietic origin. By contrast, follicular dendritic cells (FDC) are probably of mesenchymal rather than hematopoietic origin and do not express MHC class II, but are so named because they are located in lymphoid follicles and have long &quot;dendritic&quot; processes.

===In blood===
The blood DCs are typically identified and enumerated in flow cytometry. Three types of DCs have been defined in human blood: the CD1c+ myeloid DCs, the CD141+ myeloid DCs and the CD303+ plasmacytoid DCs. This represents the nomenclature proposed by the nomenclature committee of the International Union of Immunological Societies.
Dendritic cells that circulate in blood do not have all the typical features of their counterparts in tissue, i.e. they are less mature and have no dendrites. Still, they can perform complex functions including chemokine-production (in CD1c+ myeloid DCs), cross-presentation (in CD141+ myeloid DCs), and IFNalpha production (in CD303+ plasmacytoid DCs).

===&quot;In vitro&quot;===
In some respects, dendritic cells cultured in vitro do not show the same behaviour or capability as dendritic cells isolated &quot;ex vivo&quot;. Nonetheless, they are often used for research as they are still much more readily available than genuine DCs.

* HP-DC refers to cells derived from hematopoietic progenitor cells.

==Development and life cycle==

===Formation of immature cells and their maturation===

Dendritic cells are derived from hematopoietic bone marrow progenitor cells (HSC). These progenitor cells initially transform into immature dendritic cells. These cells are characterized by high endocytic activity and low T-cell activation potential. Immature dendritic cells constantly sample the surrounding environment for pathogens such as viruses and bacteria. This is done through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as the toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs recognize specific chemical signatures found on subsets of pathogens. Immature dendritic cells may also phagocytose small quantities of membrane from live own cells, in a process called nibbling. Once they have come into contact with a presentable antigen, they become activated into mature dendritic cells and begin to migrate to a lymph node. Immature dendritic cells phagocytose pathogens and degrade their proteins into small pieces and upon maturation present those fragments at their cell surface using MHC molecules. Simultaneously, they upregulate cell-surface receptors that act as co-receptors in T-cell activation such as CD80 (B7.1), CD86 (B7.2), and CD40 greatly enhancing their ability to activate T-cells. They also upregulate CCR7, a chemotactic receptor that induces the dendritic cell to travel through the blood stream to the spleen or through the lymphatic system to a lymph node. Here they act as antigen-presenting cells: they activate helper T-cells and killer T-cells as well as B-cells by presenting them with antigens derived from the pathogen, alongside non-antigen specific costimulatory signals. Dendritic cells can also induce T-cell tolerance (unresponsiveness). Certain C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) on the surface of dendritic cells, some functioning as PRRs, help instruct dendritic cells as to when it is appropriate to induce immune tolerance rather than lymphocyte activation.

Every helper T-cell is specific to one particular antigen. Only professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs: macrophages, B lymphocytes, and dendritic cells) are able to activate a resting helper T-cell when the matching antigen is presented. However, in non-lymphoid organs, macrophages and B cells can only activate memory T cells whereas dendritic cells can activate both memory and naive T cells, and are the most potent of all the antigen-presenting cells. In the lymph node and secondary lymphoid organs, all three APCs can activate naive T cells. Whereas mature dendritic cells are able to activate antigen-specific naive CD8+ T cells, the formation of CD8+ memory T cells requires the interaction of dendritic cells with CD4+ helper T cells. This help from CD4+ T cells additionally activates the matured dendritic cells and licenses (empowers) them to efficiently induce CD8+ memory T cells, which are also able to be expanded a second time. For this activation of CD8+, concurrent interaction of all three cell types, namely CD4+ T helper cells, CD8+ T cells and dendritic cells, seems to be required.

As mentioned above, mDC probably arise from monocytes, white blood cells which circulate in the body and, depending on the right signal, can turn into either dendritic cells or macrophages. The monocytes in turn are formed from stem cells in the bone marrow.
Monocyte-derived dendritic cells can be generated in vitro from peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs). Plating of PBMCs in a tissue culture flask permits adherence of monocytes. Treatment of these monocytes with interleukin 4 (IL-4) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) leads to differentiation to immature dendritic cells (iDCs) in about a week. Subsequent treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) further differentiates the iDCs into mature dendritic cells. Monocytes can be induced to differentiate into dendritic cells by a self-peptide Ep1.B derived from apolipoprotein E. These are primarily tolerogenic plasmacytoid dendritic cells.

===Life span===
In mice, it has been estimated that dendritic cells are replenished from the blood at a rate of 4000 cells per hour, and undergo a limited number of divisions during their residence in the spleen over 10 to 14 days.

===Research challenges===
The exact genesis and development of the different types and subsets of dendritic cells and their interrelationship is only marginally understood at the moment, as dendritic cells are so rare and difficult to isolate that only in recent years they have become subject of focused research. Distinct surface antigens that characterize dendritic cells have only become known from 2000 on; before that, researchers had to work with a &#x27;cocktail&#x27; of several antigens which, used in combination, result in isolation of cells with characteristics unique to DCs.

== Cytokines ==
The dendritic cells are constantly in communication with other cells in the body. This communication can take the form of direct cell–cell contact based on the interaction of cell-surface proteins. An example of this includes the interaction of the membrane proteins of the B7 family of the dendritic cell with CD28 present on the lymphocyte. However, the cell–cell interaction can also take place at a distance via cytokines.

For example, stimulating dendritic cells &quot;in vivo&quot; with microbial extracts causes the dendritic cells to rapidly begin producing IL-12. IL-12 is a signal that helps send naive CD4 T cells towards a Th1 phenotype. The ultimate consequence is priming and activation of the immune system for attack against the antigens which the dendritic cell presents on its surface. However, there are differences in the cytokines produced depending on the type of dendritic cell. The plasmacytoid DC has the ability to produce huge amounts of type-1 IFNs, which recruit more activated macrophages to allow phagocytosis.

== Disease ==

=== Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm ===
Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is a rare type of myeloid cancer in which malignant pDCs infiltrate the skin, bone marrow, central nervous system, and other tissues. Typically, the disease presents with skin lesions (e.g. nodules, tumors, papules, bruise-like patches, and/or ulcers) that most often occur on the head, face, and upper torso. This presentation may be accompanied by cPC infiltrations into other tissues to result in swollen lymph nodes, enlarged liver, enlarged spleen, symptoms of central nervous system dysfunction, and similar abnormalities in breasts, eyes, kidneys, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, bone, sinuses, ears, and/or testes. The disease may also present as a pDC leukemia, i.e. increased levels of malignant pDC in blood (i.e. &gt;2% of nucleated cells) and bone marrow and evidence (i.e. cytopenias) of bone marrow failure. Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm has a high rate of recurrence following initial treatments with various chemotherapy regimens. In consequence, the disease has a poor overall prognosis and newer chemotherapeutic and novel non-chemotherapeutic drug regimens to improve the situation are under study.

=== Viral infection ===
HIV, which causes AIDS, can bind to dendritic cells via various receptors expressed on the cell. The best studied example is DC-SIGN (usually on MDC subset 1, but also on other subsets under certain conditions; since not all dendritic cell subsets express DC-SIGN, its exact role in sexual HIV-1 transmission is not clear). When the dendritic cell takes up HIV and then travels to the lymph node, the virus can be transferred to helper CD4+ T-cells, contributing to the developing infection. This infection of dendritic cells by HIV explains one mechanism by which the virus could persist after prolonged HAART.

Many other viruses, such as the SARS virus, seem to use DC-SIGN to &#x27;hitchhike&#x27; to its target cells. However, most work with virus binding to DC-SIGN expressing cells has been conducted using in vitro derived cells such as moDCs. The physiological role of DC-SIGN in vivo is more difficult to ascertain.

=== Cancer ===
Dendritic cells are usually not abundant at tumor sites, but increased densities of populations of dendritic cells have been associated with better clinical outcome, suggesting that these cells can participate in controlling cancer progression. Lung cancers have been found to include four different subsets of dendritic cells: three classical dendritic cell subsets and one plasmacytoid dendritic cell subset. At least some of these dendritic cell subsets can activate CD4+ helper T cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, which are immune cells that can also suppress tumor growth. However, dendritic cell activity is commonly supressed by regulatory T cells and multiple other factors. Dendritic cell stimulating treatments, such as dendritic cell based vaccinations, have been emerging as a treatment with varying success. In experimental models, dendritic cells have also been shown to contribute to the success of cancer immunotherapies, for example with the immune checkpoint blocker anti-PD-1.

=== Autoimmunity ===
Altered function of dendritic cells is also known to play a major or even key role in allergy and autoimmune diseases like lupus erythematosus and inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis).

==Other animals==
The above applies to humans. In other organisms, the function of dendritic cells can differ slightly. However, the principal function of dendritic cells as known to date is always to act as an immune sentinel. They survey the body and collect information relevant to the immune system, they are then able to instruct and direct the adaptive arms to respond to challenges.

In addition, an immediate precursor to myeloid and lymphoid dendritic cells of the spleen has been identified. This precursor, termed pre-DC, lacks MHC class II surface expression, and is distinct from monocytes, which primarily give rise to DCs in non-lymphoid tissues.

Dendritic cells have also been found in turtles.

Dendritic cells have been found in rainbow trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;) and zebrafish (&quot;Danio rerio&quot;) but their role is still not fully understood

<text>Live &#x27;84 is an album released by Black Flag in 1984 on SST Records. It is a live recording of a show played in 1984 and features mostly tracks from &quot;My War&quot; and &quot;Slip It In&quot;. A video was shot simultaneously and was briefly available through SST; the now-out-of-print video has been widely bootlegged.

The album was originally issued as a cassette-only release, almost simultaneously with &quot;Slip It In&quot;. In 1998, Greg Ginn remixed the album for CD reissue.

==Recording==
The album was recorded at the Stone nightclub in San Francisco, CA.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Maximum Rocknroll&quot; called the album &quot;a superior quality live tape showcasing an evening with a seminal, legendary, masochistic, poignant, chaotic beast of an outfit who have not lost one iota of aggro.&quot; &quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that &quot;Black Flag concerts were typically an utter mess, which suits the songs perfectly, making this chaotic explosion naturally one of their best releases.&quot; The &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; deemed it &quot;tolerable until the lounge-core latter half of side two.&quot;

<text>Loose Nut is the fifth studio album by American band Black Flag, released in 1985 on SST Records.

==Reception==

&quot;Spin&quot; wrote, &quot;Henry Rollins&#x27; manic ravings make mascaraed posturers seem pale. This band goes off, takes a lot of chances, and when you hear this, you have a lot of fun. Who knows when radio programmers will catch up to them? Black Flag really deserves to be, like, bigger than &quot;Thriller&quot;.&quot;

==Track listing==

==Personnel==
*Henry Rollins – lead vocals
*Greg Ginn – guitars
*Kira Roessler – bass, backing vocals
*Bill Stevenson – drums
*Raymond Pettibon – artwork

<text>The Process of Weeding Out is the fifth EP by American band Black Flag. One of the most potent realizations of guitarist Greg Ginn&#x27;s fascination with the avant-garde, &quot;The Process of Weeding Out&quot; is described by critic Chris True of AllMusic as &quot;an interesting document of Greg Ginn&#x27;s development from high-speed guitar &#x27;sculptor&#x27; to one of the few punk artists to embrace 12-tone experimental music.&quot; Because of the jazz influences by Ginn, all of the tracks are instrumental.

The back cover has a quote from Ginn, reading, in part:
&quot;...even though this record may communicate certain feelings, emotions, and ideas to some, I have faith that cop-types with their strictly linear minds and stick-to-the-rules mentality don&#x27;t have the ability to decipher the intuitive contents of this record.&quot;

==Reception==

Robert Palmer of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the album as &quot;what jazz-rock could have become if the best of the musicians who first crossbred jazz improvising with rock&#x27;s sonic fire power had followed their most creative impulses.&quot;

Byron Coley at &quot;Spin&quot; said, &quot;An all-instrumental album, it’s the last to feature the drums of Bill Stevenson (who offers an uncharacteristically jazzy touch at times), and with its release, Greg Ginn heralds the fourth stage of his ascension to heaven via strings. A hypnotically churning stew pot of murk, riff, and raff.&quot;

==Track listing==
All songs by Greg Ginn, except where noted.

Side one
#&quot;Your Last Affront&quot; – 9:39
#&quot;Screw the Law&quot; – 2:24

<text>Minuteflag was an experimental jam band collaboration between members of the American punk bands Minutemen and Black Flag. Their only release, an EP, consists entirely of instrumentals with the exception of &quot;Fetch the Water&quot; which features D. Boon on lead vocals.

Recording took place in March 1985, while Black Flag was in the process of writing and recording &quot;Loose Nut&quot; at Total Access Studio in Redondo Beach, CA; Minutemen had just completed their &quot;Project: Mersh&quot; 12&quot; EP at the same studio the month before. The members involved initially agreed that the material recorded during the Minuteflag sessions would not be released until at least one of the bands had disbanded. A 12&quot; EP on SST Records as SST 050 came out over a year afterward, by which time Minutemen had disbanded after the car crash death of guitarist/vocalist D. Boon; Black Flag themselves split up later in 1986.

==Track listing==
#&quot;Fetch the Water&quot; – 3:49
#&quot;Power Failure&quot; – 3:43
#&quot;Friends&quot; – 5:12
#&quot;Candy Rush&quot; – 1:49

==Personnel==
*D. Boon – lead and backing vocals, lyrics (track 1), guitar
*Greg Ginn – guitar
*George Hurley – bongo drum (tracks 1 and 2), bean can (tracks 3 and 4)
*Kira Roessler – backing vocals (track 1), bass
*Henry Rollins – lead and backing vocals (track 1)
*Bill Stevenson – drums
*Mike Watt – bass
