<text>Bright Victory is a 1951 American drama romance war film directed by Mark Robson, and starring Arthur Kennedy and Peggy Dow.

==Plot==
During World War II, American sergeant Larry Nevins is blinded by a German sniper while fighting in North Africa. He is taken to a Pennsylvania hospital for other blinded soldiers, where he struggles to accept and come to terms with his disability.

Though initially despondent, Larry is taught to orient himself and walk through the grounds and in town by memorization and with use of a cane. He befriends Joe Morgan, another blinded veteran, and Judy, a local bank teller who volunteers by socializing with disabled soldiers.

One day, Larry, unaware that Joe is black, utters a racial slur, causing a rift between Larry and the others. Meanwhile, he progresses well in his recovery, passing a crucial test to see how well he can handle himself on the street. He is cleared for furlough, so Judy takes him to spend a weekend at her sister&#x27;s nearby cabin, where he goes fishing and is entertained by her family.

From Judy&#x27;s brother-in-law, Larry learns of a very successful blind lawyer, giving him hope for the future. After dinner, Judy reveals her love for him. Larry tells her that he needs more security and family support and already has a fiancée in his Florida hometown. Somewhat dispirited, he goes home and has a rough time dealing with the racial attitudes of his Southern parents and friends. His fiancée&#x27;s family is having doubts about his fitness as a son-in-law, and his parents are downcast because of his disability.

Larry is happy to see his fiancée Chris, though he still thinks of Judy. After a bad experience at his homecoming party, he tells Chris the difficulties that they can expect with his disability, and that he wants to relocate rather than be patronized with the menial local job that her successful father has offered him. After some thought, Chris tells Larry that she does not feel strong enough to marry and move far away with him while he struggles to make a new life for both of them.

Returning to the hospital, Larry takes a side trip to Philadelphia and meets the successful blind lawyer played by Frank Wilcox. The lawyer tells him that life is difficult but worth it and that his wife was an invaluable helper to him in his career.

At the train station en route to begin a more advanced rehabilitation course, Larry is unexpectedly reunited with Judy. They joyfully declare their love.

Boarding the train, he hears Joe Morgan&#x27;s name called. He catches Joe&#x27;s arm, apologizes for all the hurt he has caused and asks if they can be friends; Joe accepts the apology. They board and sit together as the train pulls out of the station.

==Awards==
&quot;Bright Victory&quot; was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Arthur Kennedy) and Best Sound Recording (Leslie I. Carey). The film was also entered into the 1951 Cannes Film Festival.

==Filming locations==
Part of the film was made at Valley Forge General Army Hospital in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, and the town&#x27;s name is mentioned in the film. Scenes were also shot in downtown Phoenixville, Kimberton, and at Broad Street Station in Philadelphia.
==Reception==
Robson called it &quot;a very good film&quot; although he admitted &quot;it was a disaster financially.&quot;

The &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; complimented the film as &quot;one of the year&#x27;s most important pictures, from several angles. It is important first because it is a finely made, absorbing film, and second because it deals with a current problem that is everybody&#x27;s concern—the blinded war veteran. But it is also terrifically important because Arthur Kennedy, the star, gives a performance in this Universal-International picture that would be outstanding in any year, and will probably hold its place among all competitors for many years to come.&quot;

R. Maurice Moss, then associate executive director of the Urban League, described the film as “&quot;a powerful picture in every way….exceedingly well cast….It is excellent also from the standpoint of teaching how to treat those handicapped by blindness—of heart, eye, and soul.&quot;

The &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; wrote: &quot;The picture&#x27;s outstanding feature is the adept performance of Arthur Kennedy as the blinded World War II veteran….&#x27;Bright Victory&#x27;s&#x27; next most notable quality lies in the realistic treatment of the rehabilitation sequences….Actually, we felt that good performances by most of the cast, plus the…direction, did more to make a success out of &#x27;Bright Victory&#x27; than the script, which belabored certain obvious problems in too stereotype a manner. An example in this connection was the love affair between Kennedy and Peggy Dow. There never was any doubt about the outcome. Every scene following their meeting seemed to telegraph the course of events. &#x27;Bright Victory&#x27; also eases in a carefully treated side-plot about the Negro problem, which it solves easily—perhaps too easily. However, James Edwards…handles his chore with proper effect. Miss Dow…is warm and charming. She doesn&#x27;t go overboard in the tear-jerking scenes and handles the straight stuff with ability.&quot;

<doc id="156618" wikidata="Q844908" url="?curid=156618" title="Crawley">
<text>Crawley () is a town and borough in West Sussex, England. It is south of London, north of Brighton and Hove, and north-east of the county town of Chichester. Crawley covers an area of and had a population of 118,493 at the time of the 2021 Census. Southern parts of the borough lie immediately next to the High Weald National Landscape.

The area has been inhabited since the Stone Age, and was a centre of ironworking in the Iron Age and Roman times. The area was probably used by the kings of Sussex for hunting. Initially a clearing in the vast forest of the Weald, Crawley began as a settlement on the boundary of two of the sub-regions particular to Sussex, known as Rapes, the Rape of Bramber and the Rape of Lewes. Becoming a market town in 1202, Crawley developed slowly, serving the surrounding villages in the Weald. In the medieval period, its location on the main road from London to the port of Shoreham helped the town to grow and when Brighton became a fashionable seaside town in the 17th century this brought passing trade, which encouraged the development of coaching inns. A rail link to London and Brighton opened in 1841, encouraged further development.

After the Second World War, the British Government planned to move large numbers of people and jobs out of London and into new towns around South East England. The New Towns Act 1946 (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 6. c. 68) designated Crawley as the site of one of these. A master plan was developed for the establishment of new residential, commercial, industrial and civic areas, and rapid development greatly increased the size and population of the town over a few decades.

The town expanded further in 1974, to include Gatwick Airport, Britain&#x27;s 2nd busiest international airport and in 2024, the 10th largest in Europe. The town contains 14 residential neighbourhoods radiating out from the core of the old market town, and separated by main roads and railway lines. The nearby communities of Ifield, Pound Hill and Three Bridges were absorbed into the new town at various stages in its development. Established in 2019, the south-western suburb of Kilnwood Vale lies outside of the borough boundary in the neighbouring district of Horsham.
Economically, the town has developed into the main centre of industry and employment between London and the coast at Brighton. Its large industrial area supports manufacturing and service companies, many of them connected with the airport. The commercial and retail sectors continue to expand.

In the late 20th century and early 21st century, the town has attracted a diverse and multicultural population. It is home to about two-thirds of the UK&#x27;s population of Chagossians.

==History==
===Origins===
The area may have been settled during the Mesolithic period: locally manufactured flints of the Horsham Culture type have been found to the southwest of the town. Tools and burial mounds from the Neolithic period, and burial mounds and a sword from the Bronze Age, have also been discovered. Crawley is on the western edge of the High Weald, which produced iron for more than 2,000 years from the Iron Age onwards. Goffs Park—now a recreational area in the south of the town—was the site of two late Iron Age furnaces. Ironworking and mineral extraction continued throughout Roman times, particularly in the Broadfield area where many furnaces were built.
In the 5th century, Saxon settlers named the area Crow&#x27;s Leah—meaning a crow-infested clearing, or Crow&#x27;s Wood. This name evolved over time, and the present spelling appeared by the early 14th century. By this time, nearby settlements were more established: the Saxon church at Worth, for example, dates from between 950 and 1050 AD.

Although Crawley itself is not mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, the nearby settlements of Ifield and Worth are recorded. Crawley&#x27;s High Street was built on part of the route from London to the port of New Shoreham, a major port in the 12th and 13th centuries that was on the most direct route between London and Normandy, used by the king and his knights and soldiers. The first written record of Crawley dates from 1202, when King John issued a licence for a weekly market on Wednesdays. As a small market town, Crawley grew slowly in importance over the next few centuries and as the Wealden iron industry declined, Crawley became an important centre for smuggling between the Sussex coast and London. Later in the 18th century, Crawley was boosted by the construction of the turnpike road between London and Brighton. When this was completed in 1770, travel between the newly fashionable seaside resort of Brighton and London became safer and quicker, and Crawley (located approximately halfway between the two) prospered as a coaching halt. By 1839 it offered almost an hourly service to both destinations. A timber-framed house on the High Street dating from the 15th century expanded to become a large coaching inn later known as Originally known as the George Hotel, taking over adjacent buildings and at one stage includedan annexe in the middle of the wide High Street that survived until the 1930s.

Crawley&#x27;s oldest church is St John the Baptist&#x27;s, between the High Street and the Broadway. It is said to have 13th-century origins, but there has been much rebuilding (especially in the 19th century) and the oldest part remaining is the south wall of the nave, which is believed to be 14th century. The church has a 15th-century tower (rebuilt in 1804) which originally contained four bells cast in 1724. Two were replaced by Thomas Lester of London in 1742; but in 1880 a new set of eight bells were cast and installed by the Croydon-based firm Gillett, Bland &amp; Company.

===Railway age and Victorian era===

The Brighton Main Line was the first railway line to serve the Crawley area. A station was opened at Three Bridges (originally known as East Crawley) in the summer of 1841. Crawley railway station, at the southern end of the High Street, was built in 1848 when the Horsham branch was opened from Three Bridges to Horsham. A line was built eastwards from Three Bridges to East Grinstead in 1855. Three Bridges had become the hub of transport in the area by this stage: one-quarter of its population was employed in railway jobs by 1861 (mainly at the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway&#x27;s railway works near the station). The Longley company—one of South East England&#x27;s largest building firms in the late 19th century, responsible for buildings including Christ&#x27;s Hospital school and King Edward VII Sanatorium in Midhurst—moved to a site next to Crawley station in 1881. In 1898 more than 700 people were employed at the site.

There was a major expansion in house building in the late 19th century. An area known as &quot;New Town&quot; (unrelated to the postwar developments) was created around the railway level crossing and down the Brighton Road; the West Green area, west of the High Street on the way to Ifield, was built up; and housing spread south of the Horsham line for the first time, into what is now Southgate. The population reached 4,433 in 1901, compared to 1,357 a century earlier. In 1891, a racecourse was opened on farmland at Gatwick. Built to replace a steeplechase course at Waddon near Croydon in Surrey, it was used for both steeplechase and flat racing, and held the Grand National during the years of the First World War. The course had its own railway station on the Brighton Main Line.

In the early 20th century, many of the large country estates in the area, with their mansions and associated grounds and outbuildings, were split up into smaller plots of land, attracting haphazard housing development and small farms. By the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 Crawley had grown into a small but prosperous town, serving a wide rural area and those passing through on the A23 London–Brighton road. Three-quarters of the population had piped water supplies, all businesses and homes had electricity, and piped gas and street lighting had been in place for 50 years. An airfield was opened in 1930 on land near the racecourse. This was a private concern until the Second World War when it was claimed by the Royal Air Force.

===New Town===
In May 1946, the New Towns Act of 1946 identified Crawley as a suitable location for a New Town; but it was not officially designated as such until . The of land set aside for the new town were split across the county borders between East Sussex, West Sussex and Surrey. Architect Thomas Bennett was appointed chairman of Crawley Development Corporation. Members of the working group developing a master Plan included Lawrence Neal, Alwyn Sheppard Fidler, Caroline Haslett, Molly Bolton, Sir Edward Gillett, Eric Walter Pasold and Alderman James Marshall. A court challenge to the designation order meant that plans were not officially confirmed until December 1947. By this time, an initial plan for the development of the area had been drawn up by Anthony Minoprio. This proposed filling in the gaps between the villages of Crawley, Ifield and Three Bridges. Bennett estimated that planning, designing and building the town, and increasing its population from the existing 9,500 to 40,000, would take 15 years.

Work began almost immediately to prepare for the expansion of the town. A full master plan was in place by 1949. This envisaged an increase in the population of the town to 50,000, residential properties in nine neighbourhoods radiating from the town centre, and a separate industrial area to the north. The neighbourhoods would consist mainly of three-bedroom family homes, with a number of smaller and larger properties. Each would be built around a centre with shops, a church, a public house, a primary school and a community centre. Secondary education was to be provided at campuses at Ifield Green, Three Bridges and Tilgate. Later, a fourth campus, in Southgate, was added to the plans.

At first, little development took place in the town centre, and residents relied on the shops and services in the existing high street. The earliest progress was in West Green, where new residents moved in during the late 1940s. In 1950 the town was visited by the then heir to the throne, Princess Elizabeth, when she officially opened the Manor Royal industrial area. Building work continued throughout the 1950s in West Green, Northgate and Three Bridges, and later in Langley Green, Pound Hill and Ifield. In 1956, land at &quot;Tilgate East&quot; was allocated for housing use, eventually becoming the new neighbourhood of Furnace Green.

Expectations of the eventual population of the town were revised upwards several times. The 1949 master plan had allowed for 50,000 people, but this was amended to 55,000 in 1956 after the Development Corporation had successfully resisted pressure from the Minister for Town and Country Planning to accommodate 60,000. Nevertheless, plans dated 1961 anticipated growth to 70,000 by 1980, and by 1969 consideration was given to an eventual expansion of up to 120,000.
Extended shopping facilities to the east of the existing high street were provided. The first stage to open was The Broadwalk in 1954, following by the opening of the Queen&#x27;s Square development by Her Majesty The Queen in 1958. Crawley railway station was moved eastwards towards the new development.
By April 1960, when Thomas Bennett made his last presentation as chairman of the Development Corporation, the town&#x27;s population had reached 51,700; of the factory and other industrial space had been provided; 21,800 people were employed, nearly 60% of whom worked in manufacturing industries, and only seventy people were registered as unemployed. The corporation had built 10,254 houses, and private builders provided around 1,500 more. Tenants were by then permitted to buy their houses and 440 householders had chosen to do so by April 1960.

A new plan was put forward by West Sussex County Council in 1961. This proposed new neighbourhoods at Broadfield and Bewbush, both of which extended outside the administrative area of the then Urban District Council. Detailed plans were made for Broadfield in the late 1960s; by the early 1970s building work had begun. Further expansion at Bewbush was begun in 1974, although development there was slow. The two neighbourhoods were both larger than the original nine: together, their proposed population was 23,000. Work also took place in the area now known as Ifield West on the western fringes of the town.

By 1980, the council identified land at Maidenbower, south of the Pound Hill neighbourhood, as being suitable for another new neighbourhood, and work began in 1986. However, all of this development was undertaken privately, unlike the earlier neighbourhoods in which most of the housing was owned by the council.

In 1999, plans were announced to develop the 14th neighbourhood on land at Tinsley Green to the northeast of the town; this was given the go ahead in 2011 and is officially the town&#x27;s 14th neighbourhood, named Forge Wood after the ancient woodland that is enclosed within the development. After a temporary halt to the proposals when a possible expansion at Gatwick Airport was announced, construction started in 2015. Forge Wood is to have a maximum of 1900 homes. Development of another neighbourhood began in 2012 on the western side of Crawley in the Horsham district, named Kilnwood Vale. A plan for a new railway station fell through.

== Governance ==
=== Local government ===

The borough is part of a two-tier arrangement, with service provision shared with West Sussex County Council. Since 2018 the borough has partnered with other local authorities as part of the Greater Brighton City Region. The authority is divided into 13 wards, each of which is represented by two or three local councillors, forming a total council of 36 members. Most wards are coterminous with the borough&#x27;s neighbourhoods, but three neighbourhoods are divided: Broadfield, Northgate, and Pound Hill into &quot;Pound Hill North and Forge Wood&quot; and &quot;Pound Hill South and Worth&quot;. The council is elected in thirds. Crawley Borough Council has had a Labour majority since 2022.

Crawley became a parish in the sixteenth century, having previously been a chapelry in the parish of Slaugham. Crawley&#x27;s position straddling the Rapes of Bramber and Lewes with the High Street, London Road and Brighton Road forming the boundary, led to the town being divided, falling under the administration of both East Sussex County Council and West Sussex County Council when administrative counties were first formed in 1889. When district and parish councils were established under the Local Government Act 1894, Crawley was given a parish council; it was included in the Horsham Rural District and was administered by West Sussex County Council. The parish was significantly enlarged in 1933, when it absorbed the neighbouring parish of Ifield.

Following the designation as a New Town in 1947, the parish of Crawley was enlarged in 1953 to take in territory to the east, from the parishes of Slaugham and Worth. Three years later, on 1 April 1956, the parish of Crawley was made an urban district, making it independent from Horsham Rural District. The Local Government Act 1972 led to the district being reformed as a borough in April 1974, gaining a mayor for the first time. The new borough in 1974 also saw its boundaries enlarged, gaining other areas which had been included in the designated area of the New Town as well as the area north of the town including Gatwick Airport, which had previously been in Surrey.

The Urban District Council received its coat of arms from the College of Heralds in 1957. After the change to borough status a modified coat of arms, based on the original, was awarded in 1976 and presented to the council on 24 March 1977. It features a central cross on a shield, representing the town&#x27;s location at the meeting point of north–south and east–west roads. The shield bears nine martlets representing both the county of Sussex and the new town&#x27;s original nine neighbourhoods. Supporters, of an eagle and a winged lion, relate to the significance of the airport to the locality. The motto featured is &quot;I Grow and I Rejoice&quot;—a translation of a phrase from the &quot;Epistulae&quot; of Seneca the Younger. Despite a petition to save it, the old Crawley Town Hall, which was built in 1964, was demolished in 2020 and a new Crawley Town Hall was completed in 2023.

Initially, the district (and then borough) council worked with the Commission for New Towns on many aspects of development; but in 1978 many of the commission&#x27;s assets, such as housing and parks, were surrendered to the council. The authority&#x27;s boundaries were extended in 1983 to accommodate the Bewbush and Broadfield neighbourhoods.

=== United Kingdom government ===
Crawley has had its own MP since 1983, and the parliamentary constituency of Crawley shares the same boundaries as the borough. Peter Lamb of the Labour Party won the seat at the 2024 general election, replacing Conservative Henry Smith who was MP from 2010 to 2024. Previously, Laura Moffatt, a member of the Labour Party, had been the MP for Crawley from 1997 to 2010; she was the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Health, Alan Johnson. In the 2005 general election, the winning margin was the slimmest of any UK constituency: Moffatt won by just 37 votes. Crawley was previously in the constituencies of Horsham and Crawley (1974-1983) and before that Horsham (to 1918, 1945-1974) and Horsham and Worthing (1918-1945)

Two immigration detention centres – Brook House and Tinsley House – are situated within the grounds of Gatwick Airport in Crawley.

== Geography ==
At (51.1092, −0.1872), Crawley is in the north-east of West Sussex in South East England, south of London and north of Brighton and Hove. The borough of Crawley is bordered by the districts of Mid Sussex and Horsham in West Sussex as well as the districts of Mole Valley and Tandridge and the borough of Reigate and Banstead in Surrey. Nearby towns include Horsham, Haywards Heath, Burgess Hill and East Grinstead as well as the Surrey towns of Horley, Redhill, Reigate, Oxted and Dorking, 

Crawley lies in the Low Weald, on the edge of the High Weald between the North and South Downs. The town centre lies on a gentle slope above sea level where the High Street meets Kilnmead, rising to above sea level where the High Street meets the railway line. The highest point in the borough is above sea level This forms part of the Forest Ridge of the High Weald, which extends eastwards through the north of Sussex into Tunbridge Wells and Cranbrook in Kent. Two beds of sedimentary rock meet beneath the town: the eastern neighbourhoods and the town centre lie largely on the sandstone Hastings Beds, while the rest of the town is based on Weald Clay. A geological fault running from east to west has left an area of Weald Clay (with a ridge of limestone) jutting into the Hastings Beds around Tilgate. The town has no major waterways, although the River Mole rises near Rusper. meeting the Ifield Stream in the north of Crawley, and the Gatwick Stream near Gatwick Airport, before continuing northwards to the River Thames at Hampton Court Palace. There are several lakes at Tilgate Park and a mill pond at Ifield which was stopped to feed the Ifield Water Mill. To the south-west of the town lies St Leonards Forest, including Buchan Country Park; to the south-east is Tilgate Forest, originally part of Worth Forest. This area forms part of the Weald to Waves wildlife corridor, providing a key link between Knepp Wildland and Ashdown Forest, which connects further to coast via the Rivers Adur, Arun and Ouse.

In 1822 Gideon Mantell, an amateur fossil collector and palaeontologist, discovered teeth, bones and other remains of what he described as &quot;an animal of the lizard tribe of enormous magnitude&quot;, in Tilgate Forest on the edge of Crawley. He announced his discovery in an 1825 scientific paper, giving the creature the name Iguanodon. In 1832 he discovered and named the Hylaeosaurus genus of dinosaurs after finding a fossil in the same forest.

=== Climate ===
Crawley lies within the Sussex Weald, an area of highly variable terrain so that many microclimates of frost hollows, sun traps and windswept hilltops will be encountered over a short distance. During calm, clear periods of weather this allows for some interesting temperature variations, although most of the time, when mobile westerly airstreams persist, the weather is typically Oceanic like the rest of the British Isles. Gatwick is the nearest weather station that publishes long-term averages that give an accurate description of the climate of the Crawley area, although more recently the Met Office has also published data for its nearby weather station at Charlwood. Both weather stations are about 3 miles north of Crawley town centre and at similar altitudes.

Generally, Crawley&#x27;s inland and southerly position within the UK means temperatures in summer are amongst the highest in the British Isles, Charlwood recording 36.3C (97.3F) and Gatwick recording 36.4C (97.5F) on 19 July 2006, just 0.2C and 0.1C lower, respectively, than the UK monthly record for that day set at Wisley, 20 miles to the west. The overall maximum stands at 36.5C (97.7F) at Charlwood, set on 10 August 2003. The absolute record for Gatwick is the aforementioned 36.4C. Before this, the highest temperature recorded at Gatwick was 35.6C (96.1F), also in August 2003. The maximum temperature was 25.1C (77.2F) or higher on 15.9 days of the year on average (1971–00) and the warmest day will typically rise to 29.4C (84.9F).

The overall minimum for Gatwick Airport for the period from 1960 is −16.7C (1.9F), set in January 1963. More recently, Charlwood fell to −11.2C (11.8F) and Gatwick −11.1C (12.0F) on 20 December 2010. Typically the coldest night at Gatwick will fall to −8.9C (16.0F). Air frost is recorded on 58.2 nights at Gatwick (1971–00)

Sunshine totals in Crawley are higher than many inland areas due to its southerly location: Gatwick averaged 1,574 hours per year over 1961–90. No data is available for 1971 to 2000, but given increases at comparable sites nearby, annual averages are likely to be over 1,600 hours.

Snowfall is often heavier in the Sussex Weald than in many other low-lying parts of central and southern England due to the proximity of moisture-laden southerly tracking low-pressure systems bringing easterly winds and snow to areas from South London southwards. However, again due to the southerly location of the area, with warmer air from the nearby English Channel, the snow is often temporary as low-pressure systems track north bringing in milder air; areas immediately north of London tend to have less accumulation, but lying for a longer duration.

Rainfall is lower than the English average, but higher than many other areas of the South East. 1mm of rain or more falls on 116.7 days of the year.

=== Neighbourhoods and areas ===


There are 14 residential neighbourhoods, each with a variety of housing types: terraced, semi-detached and detached houses, low-rise flats and bungalows. There are no residential tower blocks, apart from the 8-storey Milton Mount Flats at the North end of Pound Hill. Many houses have their own gardens and are set back from roads. The hub of each neighbourhood is a shopping parade, community centre and church, and each has a school and recreational open spaces as well. Crawley Development Corporation&#x27;s intention was for neighbourhood shops to cater only to basic needs, and for the town centre to be used for most shopping requirements. The number of shop units provided in the neighbourhood parades reflected this: despite the master plan making provision for at least 20 shops in each neighbourhood, the number actually built ranged from 19 in the outlying Langley Green neighbourhood to just seven in West Green, close to the town centre.

Each of the 14 residential neighbourhoods is identified by a colour, which is shown on street name signs in a standard format throughout the town: below the street name, the neighbourhood name is shown in white text on a coloured background.

There are areas which are not defined as neighbourhoods but which are closely associated with Crawley:
* The Manor Royal industrial estate is in the north of the town. Although it is part of the Northgate ward, it is allocated a colour: its street name signs feature the word &quot;Industrial&quot; on a black background.
* Crawley&#x27;s town centre is in the southernmost part of Northgate. Its street name signs do not follow the standard format of the neighbourhood signs but display only the street name.
* Gatwick Airport was built on the site of a manor house, Gatwick Manor, close to the village of Lowfield Heath. Most of the village was demolished when the airport expanded, but the Grade II*-listed St Michael and All Angels Church, remains. The site of Lowfield Heath village, now occupied by warehouses and light industrial units, is on the airport&#x27;s southern boundary, between the perimeter road and the A23 close to Manor Royal.
* Worth was originally a village with its own civil parish, lying just beyond the eastern edge of the Crawley urban area and borough boundary; but the development of the Pound Hill and Maidenbower neighbourhoods has filled in the gaps, and the borough boundary has been extended to include the whole of the village. The civil parish of Worth remains, albeit reduced in size, as part of the Mid Sussex district.
* Tinsley Green, a hamlet in Worth parish, is now within the Forge Wood neighbourhood. Its houses, farms and public house, the Greyhound (at which the British and World Marbles Championship has been held annually since 1932), lie on or around an east–west minor road running from the main Balcombe–Horley road to the Manor Royal estate.
* The hamlet of Fernhill is east of Gatwick Airport and the same distance south of Horley. It has been wholly within the borough since 1990, when the borough and county boundary was moved eastwards to align exactly with the M23 motorway. Until then, its houses and farms straddled the boundary. Fernhill was the site of a fatal aeroplane crash in 1969: 50 people (including two residents) died when Ariana Afghan Airlines Flight 701 crashed into a house on Fernhill Road.

== Demography ==
At the census in 2011 the population of Crawley was recorded as 106,597. The 2001 census data showed that population then accounted for 13.2% of the population of the county of West Sussex. The growth in population of the new town (around 1,000% between 1951 and 2001) has outstripped that of most similar-sized settlements. For example, in the same period, the population of the neighbouring district of Horsham grew by just 99%.

According to the 2021 census, Crawley&#x27;s population had grown to 118,493. White people made up 73.4% of the population, of those 61.8% identified as White British, a decrease from 84.5% in 2001, while those who identified as &quot;Other White&quot; were 10.5%. Asians made up 15.4% of the population, with Indians and Pakistanis making up 6.2% and 5.2% of the population respectively, while Sri Lankans (mostly of Tamil descent/background) make up the majority of &quot;Other Asian&quot; write-ins. Those of Black descent made up 4.5% of the population. Crawley also has a noticeable Mauritian minority, made up of people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds.

Those who recorded their main language as English made up 84.3% of the population. Other languages were Romanian (2.1%), Polish (1.7%), Portuguese (1.4%), Tamil (1.3), Gujarati (1.1%) and Hindustani (Hindi/Urdu) (1.1%). There is also a Tamil learning centre.

Many Chagossians expelled from the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean settled in Crawley in the 1960s and 1970s, and it was reported in 2016 that the town&#x27;s Chagossian community numbered approximately 3,000 people. Former Crawley MP Henry Smith stated that Crawley &quot;is home to perhaps the largest Chagossian population in the world&quot;.

The town has a population density of around 2,635 persons per square kilometre, making it the second most densely populated district in West Sussex, after Worthing. In 2021, around 28.6% were in managerial, administrative or professional occupations, although this varied by ward, with just 19.5% in Broadfield West, compared to 45.7% in Maidenbower.

The proportion of people in the town with higher education qualifications is lower than the national average. Around 27.5% have a qualification at level 4 or above, compared to 33.9% nationally.

=== Religion ===
The largest religious affiliation was Christianity at 42.6%, followed by those with no religion at 35.1%, Islam at 9.7%, Hinduism at 5.1%, Sikhism at 0.7%, Buddhism at 0.4%, Judaism at 0.1% and any other religion at 0.5%.

Like the rest of Sussex, Crawley&#x27;s Church of England churches fall within the Diocese of Chichester. These churches include St John the Baptist&#x27;s Church&#x27;s in Crawley town centre and St Margaret&#x27;s Church, both of which dates from the 13th century. Parts of St Nicholas Church in Worth date to the 10th century. Ifield Friends Meeting House dates from 1676 and is one of the oldest purpose-built Friends meeting houses in the world.

Crawley is home to three mosque A Gurjar Hindu community became established in Crawley in 1968 and opened a mandir (temple) and community centre in a building in West Green in 1998. A Hindu temple in Ifield opened in 2010, the largest such temple in South East England, at , with a community centre, offices, gardens and sports facilities.

== Economy ==
Crawley traded as a market town. The Development Corporation intended to develop it as a centre for manufacturing and light engineering, with an industrial zone. The rapid growth of Gatwick Airport provided opportunities for businesses in the aviation, transport, warehousing and distribution industries. The significance of the airport to local employment and enterprise was reflected by the formation of the Gatwick Diamond partnership. This venture, supported by local businesses, local government and SEEDA, South East England&#x27;s Regional Development Agency, aims to maintain and improve the Crawley and Gatwick area&#x27;s status as a region of national and international economic importance.

Since the Second World War, unemployment in Crawley has been low: the rate was 1.47% of the working-age population in 2003. During the boom of the 1980s the town boasted the lowest level of unemployment in the UK. Continuous growth and investment have made Crawley one of the most important business and employment centres in the South East England region.

In April 2020, the Centre for Cities thinktank identified Crawley as the place in Britain at the highest risk of widespread job losses due to the coronavirus&#x27; effect on the economy; classing 56% of jobs in the town as either vulnerable or very vulnerable of being furloughed or lost.

=== Manufacturing industry ===
Crawley was already a modest industrial centre by the end of the Second World War. Building was an important trade: 800 people were employed by building and joinery firms, and two—Longley&#x27;s and Cook&#x27;s—were large enough to have their own factories. In 1949, 1,529 people worked in manufacturing: the main industries were light and precision engineering and aircraft repair. Many of the jobs in these industries were highly skilled.

Industrial development had to take place relatively soon after the new town was established because part of the corporation&#x27;s remit was to move people and jobs out of an overcrowded and war-damaged London. Industrial jobs were needed as well as houses and shops to create a balanced community where people could settle. The Development Corporation wanted the new town to support a large and mixed industrial base, with factories and other buildings based in a single zone rather than spread throughout the town. A site in the northeastern part of the development area was chosen. Its advantages included flat land with no existing development; proximity to the London–Brighton railway line, the A23 and the planned M23; space for railway sidings (which were eventually built on a much smaller scale than envisaged); and an adjacent site reserved for future expansion, on the other side of the railway line (again, not used for this purpose in the end). Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) opened the first part of the industrial area on 25 January 1950; its main road was named Manor Royal, and this name eventually came to refer to the whole estate.

The Corporation stipulated that several manufacturing industries should be developed, rather than allowing one sector or firm to dominate. It did not seek to attract companies by offering financial or other incentives; instead, it set out to create the ideal conditions for industrial development to arise naturally, by providing large plots of land with room for expansion, allowing firms to build their own premises or rent ready-made buildings, and constructing a wide range of building types and sizes.

Despite the lack of direct incentives, many firms applied to move to the Manor Royal estate: it was considered such an attractive place to relocate to that the Development Corporation was able to choose between applicants to achieve the ideal mix of firms, and little advertising or promotion had to be undertaken. One year after Manor Royal was opened, eighteen firms were trading there, including four with more than 100 employees and one with more than 1,000. By 1964, businesses which had moved to the town since 1950 employed 16,000 people; the master plan had anticipated between 8,000 and 8,500. In 1978 there were 105 such firms, employing nearly 20,000 people.

Thales Group opened a new manufacturing and office complex in Crawley in 2009. The site consolidated manufacturing and offices in the Crawley area and the south-east of England.

=== Service industry and commerce ===

While most of the jobs created in the new town&#x27;s early years were in manufacturing, the tertiary sector developed strongly from the 1960s. The Manor Royal estate, with its space, proximity to Gatwick Airport and good transport links, attracted airport-related services such as logistics, catering, distribution and warehousing; and the corporation and private companies built offices throughout the town. Office floorspace in the town increased from in 1965 to a conservative estimate of in 1984. Major schemes during that period included premises for the Westminster Bank, British Caledonian and The Office of the Paymaster-General. The five-storey Overline House above the railway station, completed in 1968, is used by Crawley&#x27;s NHS primary care trust and various other companies.

Companies headquartered in Crawley include Doosan Babcock Energy, WesternGeco, Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Atlantic&#x27;s associated travel agency Virgin Holidays, William Reed Business Media, Dualit and the Office of the Paymaster-General. Danish company Novo Nordisk, which manufactures much of the world&#x27;s insulin supply, has its UK headquarters at the Broadfield Business Park, and BDO Global has an office in Crawley. The UK headquarters of Nestlé is in the Manor Royal area of Crawley. In addition the registered offices of TUI UK and Thomson Airways are located in Crawley.

British Airways took over British Caledonian&#x27;s former headquarters near the Manor Royal estate, renamed it &quot;Astral Towers&quot; and based its British Airways Holidays and Air Miles divisions there. Other companies formerly headquartered in Crawley include Astraeus Airlines, British United Airways, CityFlyer Express, CP Ships, First Choice Airways, GB Airways, Laker Airways, Tradewinds Airways, and Air Europe.

Crawley has numerous hotels, including The George Hotel, dated to 1615. It is reputedly haunted.
=== Shopping and retail ===
Even before the new town was planned, Crawley was a retail centre for the surrounding area: there were 177 shops in the town in 1948, 99 of which were on the High Street. Early new town residents relied on these shopping facilities until the Corporation implemented the master plan&#x27;s designs for a new shopping area on the mostly undeveloped land east of the High Street and north of the railway line. The Broadwalk and its 23 shops were built in 1954, followed by the Queen&#x27;s Square complex and surrounding streets in the mid-1950s. Queen&#x27;s Square, a pedestrianised plaza surrounded by large shops and linked to the High Street by The Broadwalk, was officially opened in 1958 by Queen Elizabeth II. The town centre was completed by 1960, by which time Crawley was already recognised as an important regional, rather than merely local, shopping centre.

In the 1960s and 1970s, large branches of Tesco, Sainsbury&#x27;s and Marks &amp; Spencer were opened (the Tesco superstore was the largest in Britain at the time). The shopping area was also expanded southeastwards from Queen&#x27;s Square: although the original plans of 1975 were not implemented fully, several large shop units were built and a new pedestrianised link—The Martlets—was provided between Queen&#x27;s Square and Haslett Avenue, the main road to Three Bridges. The remaining land between this area and the railway line was sold for private development by 1982; in 1992 a shopping centre named County Mall and anchored by an Owen Owen department store was opened there. Its stores includes major retailers such as The Entertainer, Boots, WHSmith and Superdry as well as over 80 smaller outlets. The town&#x27;s main bus station was redesigned, roads including the main A2220 Haslett Avenue were rerouted, and some buildings at the south end of The Martlets were demolished to accommodate the mall.

A regeneration strategy for the town centre, &quot;Centre Vision 2000&quot;, was produced in 1993. Changes brought about by the scheme have included of additional retail space in Queen&#x27;s Square and The Martlets, and a mixed-use development at the southern end of the High Street on land formerly occupied by Robinson Road (which was demolished) and Spencers Road (shortened and severed at one end). An ASDA superstore, opened in September 2003, forms the centrepiece. Robinson Road, previously named Church Road, had been at the heart of the old Crawley: a century before its demolition, its buildings included two chapels, a school, a hospital and a post office.

== Public services ==

Policing in Crawley is provided by Sussex Police; the British Transport Police are responsible for the rail network. The borough is the police headquarters for the West Sussex division, and is itself divided into three areas for the purposes of neighbourhood policing: Crawley East, Crawley West, and Crawley Town Centre. A separate division covers Gatwick Airport. There is a police station in the town centre; it is open 24 hours a day, and the front desk is staffed for 16 hours each day except Christmas Day. Statutory emergency fire and rescue services are provided by the West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service which operates a fire station in the town centre. The South East Coast Ambulance Service is responsible for ambulance and paramedic services.

Crawley Hospital in West Green is operated by West Sussex Primary Care Trust. Some services are provided by the Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, including a 24-hour Urgent Treatment Centre for semi-life-threatening injuries. The Surrey and Sussex was judged as &quot;weak&quot; by the Healthcare Commission in 2008, however in 2015 both the hospital and the Surrey and Sussex Trust were rated good by the Care Quality Commission.

Thames Water is responsible for all waste water and sewerage provision. Residents in most parts of Crawley receive their drinking water from Southern Water; areas in the north of the town around Gatwick Airport are provided by Sutton &amp; East Surrey Water; and South East Water supplies Maidenbower.

UK Power Networks is the distribution network operator responsible for electricity. Gas is supplied by Southern Gas Networks who own and manage the South East Local Distribution Zone.

The provision of public services was made in co-operation with the local authorities as the town grew in the 1950s and 1960s. They oversaw the opening of a fire station in 1958, the telephone exchange, police station and town centre health clinic in 1961 and an ambulance station in 1963. Plans for a new hospital on land at The Hawth were abandoned, however, and the existing hospital in West Green was redeveloped instead. Gas was piped from Croydon, away, and a gasworks at Redhill, while the town&#x27;s water supply came from the Weir Wood reservoir south of East Grinstead and another at Pease Pottage.

In December 2008, a new three-storey library was opened in new buildings at Southgate Avenue, replacing the considerably undersized establishment formerly at County Buildings.

The Civil Aviation Authority Regulation Safety Group is in the Aviation House in Gatwick Airport in Crawley.

== Transport ==
Crawley&#x27;s development as a market town was helped by its location on the London–Brighton turnpike. The area was joined to the railway network in the mid-19th century; and since the creation of the new town, there have been major road upgrades (including a motorway link), a guided bus transit system and the establishment of an airport which has become one of Britain&#x27;s largest and busiest.

=== Road ===

The London–Brighton turnpike ran through the centre of Crawley, forming the High Street and Station Road. When Britain&#x27;s major roads were classified by the British government&#x27;s Ministry of Transport between 1919 and 1923, it was given the number A23. It was bypassed by a new dual carriageway in 1938 (which forms the A23&#x27;s current route through the town), and then later to the east side of the town by the M23 motorway, which was opened in 1975. This connects London&#x27;s orbital motorway, the M25, to the A23 at Pease Pottage, at the southern edge of Crawley&#x27;s built-up area. The original single-carriageway A23 became the A2219.

The M23 has junctions in the Crawley area at the A2011/A264 (Junction 10) and Maidenbower (area of Crawley) (Junction 10A). The end of the motorway at Pease Pottage is Junction 11. The A2011, another dual-carriageway, joins the A23 in West Green and provides a link, via the A2004, to the town centre. The A2220 follows the former route of the A264 through the town, linking the A23 directly to the A264 at Copthorne, from where it then runs to East Grinstead.

=== Rail ===
The first railway line in the area was the Brighton Main Line, which opened as far as Haywards Heath on 12 July 1841 and reached Brighton on 21 September 1841. It ran through Three Bridges, which was then a small village east of Crawley, and a station was built to serve it.

A line to Horsham, now part of the Arun Valley Line, was opened on 14 February 1848. A station was provided next to Crawley High Street from that date. A new station was constructed slightly to the east, in conjunction with the Overline House commercial development, and replaced the original station which closed on 28 July 1968. The ticket office and Up (London-bound) platform waiting areas form the ground floor of the office building.

The urban area of Crawley is served by a total of three rail stations including Ifield railway station. Due to Crawley&#x27;s expansion this station is now surrounded by the town&#x27;s western areas. Opened as &quot;Lyons Crossing Halt&quot; on 1 June 1907 to serve the village of Ifield, it was soon renamed &quot;Ifield Halt&quot;, dropping the &quot;Halt&quot; suffix in 1930.

Regular train services run from Crawley, and also Ifield, to London Victoria and London Bridge stations, Gatwick Airport, East Croydon, Horsham, Bognor Regis, Chichester, Portsmouth and Southampton. Three Bridges has direct Thameslink trains to Bedford and Brighton.

=== Bus and Fastway ===

Crawley was one of several towns where the boundaries of Southdown Motor Services and London Transport bus services met. In 1958 the companies reached an agreement which allowed them both to provide services in all parts of the town. When the National Bus Company was formed in 1969, its London Country Bus Services subsidiary took responsibility for many routes, including Green Line Coaches cross-London services which operated to distant destinations such as Watford, Luton and Amersham. A coach station was opened by Southdown in 1931 on the A23 at County Oak, near Lowfield Heath: it was a regular stopping point for express coaches between London and towns on the Sussex coast. This traffic started to serve Gatwick when the airport began to grow, however. When the National Bus Company was broken up, local services were provided by the new South West division of London Country Bus Services, which later became part of the Arriva group. Metrobus acquired these routes from Arriva in March 2001, and is now Crawley&#x27;s main operator. It provides local services between the neighbourhoods and town centre, and longer-distance routes to Horsham, Redhill, Tunbridge Wells, Worthing and Brighton.

In September 2003 a guided bus service, Fastway, began operating between Bewbush and Gatwick Airport. A second route, from Broadfield to the Langshott area of Horley, north of Gatwick Airport, was added on 27 August 2005.

=== Gatwick Airport ===
Gatwick Airport was licensed as a private airfield in August 1930. It was used during the Second World War as an RAF base, and returned to civil use in 1946. There were proposals to close the airport in the late 1940s, but in 1950 the government announced that it was to be developed as London&#x27;s second airport. It was closed between 1956 and 1958 for rebuilding. Her Majesty The Queen reopened it on 9 June 1958. A second terminal, the North Terminal, was built in 1988.
An agreement existed between BAA and West Sussex County Council preventing the building of a second runway before 2019. Nevertheless, consultations were launched in 2002 by the Department for Transport, at which proposals for additional facilities and runways were considered. It was agreed that there would be no further expansion at Gatwick unless it became impossible to meet growth targets at London Heathrow Airport within existing pollution limits.

== Sport and leisure ==

Crawley Town F.C. is Crawley&#x27;s main football team. Formed in 1896, it moved in 1949 to a ground at Town Mead adjacent to the West Green playing fields. Demand for land near the town centre led to the club moving in 1997 to the new Broadfield Stadium, now owned by the borough council. As of the 2024/25 season, Crawley Town F.C. are playing in League One, the third tier of English football. Since 2018, Broadfield Stadium has also been home to Women&#x27;s Super League team Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.

Three Bridges F.C. play in the Isthmian League South East Division, the eighth tier of English football, while other lower-league clubs include Oakwood F.C. and Ifield Galaxy F.C. Crawley Rugby Club is based in Ifield, and a golf course was constructed in 1982 at Tilgate Park. Crawley Hockey Club plays their home matches at Hazelwick School, Three Bridges. Cricket has been played in Ifield since 1721, and Ifield Cricket Club was formed in 1804. Three Bridges Cricket Club is a founding member of the Sussex Cricket League and in 2018 were promoted back to the Premier Division.

The new town&#x27;s original leisure centre was in Haslett Avenue in the Three Bridges neighbourhood. Building work started in the early 1960s, and a large swimming pool opened in 1964. The site was extended to include an athletics arena by 1967, and an additional large sports hall was opened by the town mayor, Councillor Ben Clay and Prime Minister Harold Wilson in 1974. However, the facilities became insufficient for the growing town, even though an annexe was opened in Bewbush in 1984. Athlete Zola Budd had been asked to take part in a 1,500-metre race as part of the opening celebrations, but her invitation was withdrawn at short notice because of concerns raised by council members about possible &quot;political connotations and anti-apartheid demonstrators&quot;.

In 2005, Crawley Leisure Centre was closed and replaced by a new facility, the K2 Leisure Centre, on the campus of Thomas Bennett Community College near the Broadfield Stadium. Opened to the public on 14 November 2005, and officially by Lord Coe on 24 January 2006, the centre includes the only Olympic-sized swimming pool in South East England. In March 2008 the centre was named as a training site for the 2012 Olympics in London.

Crawley Development Corporation made little provision for the arts in the plans for the new town, and a proposed arts venue in the town centre was never built. Neighbourhood community centres and the Tilgate Forest Recreational Centre were used for some cultural activities, but it was not until 1988 that the town had a dedicated theatre and arts venue, at the Hawth Theatre. Crawley&#x27;s earliest cinema, the Imperial Picture House on Brighton Road, lasted from 1909 until the 1940s; the Embassy Cinema on the High Street (opened in 1938) replaced it. A large Cineworld cinema has since opened in the Crawley Leisure Park, which itself also includes ten-pin bowling, various restaurants and bars and a fitness centre. The Moka nightclub on Station Way opened in October 2012 and closed in 2019.
Crawley is home to No6 detachment of the Sussex Army Cadet Force, a volunteer youth organisation, sponsored by the Ministry of Defence, which accepts cadets aged between 12 and 18 years of age.

Each neighbourhood has self-contained recreational areas, and there are other larger parks throughout the town. The Memorial Gardens, on the eastern side of Queen&#x27;s Square, feature art displays, children&#x27;s play areas and lawns, and a plaque commemorating those who died in two Second World War bombing incidents in 1943 and 1944. Goffs Park in Southgate covers , and has lakes, boating ponds, a model railway and many other features. Tilgate Park and Nature Centre has walled gardens, lakes, large areas of woodland with footpaths and bridleways, a golfing area and a collection of animals and birds.

== Heritage ==
Crawley Museum is based in the town centre. Stone Age and Bronze Age remains discovered in the area are on display, as well as more recent artefacts including parts of Vine Cottage, an old timber-framed building on the High Street which was once home to former &quot;Punch&quot; editor Mark Lemon and which was demolished when the ASDA development was built.

Crawley has three Grade I listed buildings (the parish church of St Margaret in Ifield, the parish church of St Nicholas, Worth, and the Friends Meeting House in Langley Lane, Ifield), 12 Grade II* listed buildings and 85 Grade II listed buildings. The borough council has also awarded locally listed building status to 58 buildings.

The high street becomes an annual focus of motoring heritage in November as one of the official stops on the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run.

== Education ==

Maintained primary and secondary schools were reorganised in 2004 following the Local Education Authority&#x27;s decision to change the town&#x27;s three-tier system of first, middle and secondary schools to a more standard primary/secondary divide. Since the restructuring, Crawley has had 17 primary schools (including two Church of England and two Roman Catholic) and four pairs of infant and junior Schools. Most of these were opened in 2004; others changed their status at this date (for example, from a middle to a junior school). Secondary education is provided at one of six secondary schools:
* Ifield Community College
* Hazelwick School
* Holy Trinity Church of England School
* Oriel High School
* St Wilfrid&#x27;s Catholic School
* Thomas Bennett Community College
All six of these have a sixth form, the newest opening at Oriel High in September 2008.

There is also a primary / secondary School called The Gatwick School, which is a Free School that opened in 2014. It currently has 4 years, R, 1, 7 and 8. The schools at Ifield and Thomas Bennett are also bases for the Local Authority&#x27;s adult education programmes.
Pupils with special needs are educated at the two special schools in the town, each of which covers the full spectrum of needs: Manor Green Primary School and Manor Green College.

Desmond Anderson, based in Tilgate converted to Academy status in February 2017 and is now part of the University of Brighton Academies Trust. The Atelier 21 Future School for up to 120 pupils aged 4 to 14 years, based in Broadfield House, opened on 24 August 2020.

Further education is provided by Central Sussex College. Opened in 1958 as Crawley Technical College, it merged with other local colleges to form the new institute in August 2005. The college also provides higher education courses in partnership with the universities at Chichester and Sussex. In 2004, a proposal was made for an additional campus of the University of Sussex to be created in Crawley, but as of 2008 no conclusion has been reached.

== Media ==
Crawley has three local newspapers, of which two have a long history in the area. The &quot;Crawley Observer&quot; began life in 1881 as &quot;Simmins Weekly Advertiser&quot;, became the &quot;Sussex &amp; Surrey Courier&quot; and then the &quot;Crawley and District Observer&quot;, and took its current name in 1983. The newspaper is now owned by Johnston Press. The &quot;Crawley News&quot; was first published in 1979, and later took over the operations of the older &quot;Crawley Advertiser&quot; which closed in 1982. The newspaper was taken over by the Trinity Mirror group in 2015 as part of the purchase of Local World but its last edition was published on 26 October 2016. In September 2008 Johnston Press launched a new weekly broadsheet newspaper called the &quot;Crawley Times&quot; based on the companies paper produced in Horsham, the &quot;West Sussex County Times&quot;.

Crawley is served by the London regional versions of BBC and ITV television from the Crystal Palace or Reigate transmitters. Alternatively the town is also well served by BBC South East and ITV Meridian on the Heathfield transmitter and Freesat. This means the town is served by news and television programmes from both London and Tunbridge Wells (where the BBC South East Today studios are situated).

Radio Mercury began broadcasting on 20 October 1984 from Broadfield House in Broadfield. The station, now owned by Global Radio, broadcasts as Heart South from Brighton, with the studios in Kelvin Way in Crawley closed in August 2010. On 1 February 2011, the local Gold transmitter on 1521 AM closed and listeners were advised to retune to 1548 AM (Gold London) or 1323 AM (Gold Sussex). Local BBC radio was provided by BBC Radio Sussex from 1983; this became part of BBC Southern Counties Radio following a merger with BBC Radio Surrey in 1994. From March 2009, BBC Southern Counties Radio became BBC Sussex on 104.5FM and BBC Surrey on 104FM. Due to the positioning of their transmitters, when broadcasting separately both stations cover Crawley stories.

<text>Death of a Salesman is a 1949 stage play written by the American playwright Arthur Miller. The play premiered on Broadway in February 1949, running for 742 performances. It is a two-act tragedy set in late 1940s Brooklyn told through a montage of memories, dreams, and arguments of the protagonist Willy Loman, a travelling salesman who is despondent with his life and appears to be slipping into senility. The play addresses a variety of themes, such as the American Dream, the anatomy of truth, and infidelity. It won the 1949 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and Tony Award for Best Play. It is considered by some critics to be one of the greatest plays of the 20th century. The play is included in numerous anthologies. 

Since its premiere, the play has been revived on Broadway five times, winning three Tony Awards for Best Revival. It has been adapted for the cinema on ten occasions, including a 1951 version by screenwriter Stanley Roberts, starring Fredric March. In 1999, &quot;New Yorker&quot; drama critic John Lahr said that with 11 million copies sold, it was &quot;probably the most successful modern play ever published.&quot;

== Background ==
The genesis of the play was a chance encounter between Miller and his uncle Manny Newman, a salesman, whom he met in 1947 in the lobby of a Boston theater that was playing &quot;All My Sons&quot;. Writing in a critical study of the play, author Brenda Murphy observed that Manny &quot;lodged in his imagination and created a dramatic problem that he felt compelled to solve.&quot;

Miller later recounted that when he saw Manny at the theater, &quot;I could see the grim hotel room behind him, the long trip up from New York in his little car, the hopeless hope of the day&#x27;s business.&quot; Without acknowledging Miller&#x27;s greeting or congratulating him on the play, Manny said &quot;Buddy is doing very well.&quot; Buddy was Manny&#x27;s son, and Manny saw Miller and his older brother as &quot;running neck and neck&quot; with his two sons &quot;in some race that never stopped in his mind.&quot; When visiting Manny as a youth, Miller felt &quot;gangling and unhandsome&quot; and usually heard &quot;some kind of insinuation of my entire life&#x27;s probable failure.&quot; Seeing him again in Boston, Manny seemed to the playwright to be &quot;so absurd, so completely isolated from the ordinary laws of gravity, so elaborate in his fantastic inventions,&quot; yet so much in love with fame and fortune that &quot;he possessed my imagination.&quot; Manny died by suicide soon after, which was the cause of death of two other salesmen Miller had known. One of Manny&#x27;s sons told Miller that Manny had always wanted to create a business for his two sons. Learning that transformed Manny, in Miller&#x27;s mind, to &quot;a man with a purpose.&quot;

Miller had been thinking about a play about a salesman for years. He also had new interest in the simultaneousness of the past and present that was evident at their meeting, as it was plain that he and his cousins were viewed by Manny as they were when they were adolescents, many years earlier. Miller sought to &quot;do a play without any transitions at all, dialogue that would simply leap from bone to bone of a skeleton that would not for an instant cease being added to, an organism as strictly economic as a leaf, as trim as an ant.&quot;

In creating Willy and the other characters, Miller also drew on his relationship with his father as well as another salesman. Miller was himself the model of the young Bernard.

== Plot ==
The play takes place in 1949. The setting is the Loman home in Brooklyn, located amidst a typical row of urban apartment buildings.

Willy Loman suddenly returns home exhausted after a failed business trip to Boston. Worried over Willy&#x27;s rapidly declining state of mind and a recent near fatal car accident, his wife Linda suggests that he ask his boss, Howard, to allow him to work in his home city so he will no longer have to travel. Willy complains to Linda about their son, Biff, who is 34 years old and has yet to do something meaningful with his life. Despite Biff having a promising football career in high school with many scholarship offers, he failed in mathematics and was therefore unable to enter a university.

Biff and his younger brother, Happy, who is temporarily staying with Willy and Linda after Biff&#x27;s unexpected return from the West, reminisce about their childhood together. They discuss their father&#x27;s mental degeneration, which they have witnessed in the form of his constant indecisiveness and daydreaming about the boys&#x27; high school years. Eventually, Willy walks in, angry that the two boys have never amounted to anything. In an effort to pacify their father, Biff and Happy tell him that Biff plans to make an ambitious business proposition the next day.

The next day, Willy goes to Howard’s office for a job in town while Biff goes to make a business proposition, but they both fail. Howard refuses to give Willy a New York job, despite his desperate pleas. Willy then loses his temper and ends up getting fired when Howard tells him that he needs a long rest and is no longer allowed to represent the Wagner Company. On the other hand, Biff waits hours to see a former employer named Bill Oliver who does not remember him and turns him down. In response Biff, feeling crushed, impulsively steals a fountain pen. Willy then goes to the business office of his neighbor Charley, where he runs into Charley&#x27;s son Bernard, who is now a successful lawyer about to argue a case in front of the Supreme Court and is happily married and has two children of his own. Bernard tells him that Biff originally wanted to go to summer school to make up for failing math, but something happened in Boston when Biff went to visit his father that changed his mind. Charley then offers Willy a stable do-nothing job, but Willy vehemently refuses despite losing his job. Charley, who feels insulted, reluctantly gives the now-unemployed Willy money to pay off his life-insurance premium, and Willy shocks Charley by remarking that ultimately, a man is &quot;worth more dead than alive.&quot;

Happy, Biff, and Willy meet for dinner at a restaurant, but Willy refuses to hear the bad news from Biff. Happy tries to coax Biff to lie to their father. He tries to tell him what happened as Willy gets angry and slips into a flashback of what happened in Boston the day Biff came to see him: Biff had come to Boston to ask Willy to convince his teacher to curve his failing math grade, so he could graduate. However, Willy was in the middle of an extramarital affair with a receptionist named Miss Francis when Biff arrived unexpectedly, and saw the half-dressed woman with him. Biff did not accept his father&#x27;s cover-up story for her presence, and angrily dismissed him as a liar and a fake before storming out. From that moment, Biff&#x27;s views of his father changed and set him adrift.

Biff leaves the restaurant in frustration, followed by Happy flanked by a pair of attractive women named Miss Forsythe and Letta, leaving a confused and devastated Willy behind. When they later return home, Linda berates them for abandoning their father while Willy remains outside, talking to himself. Biff tries to reconcile with Willy, but the discussion quickly escalates into emotional conflict. Biff conveys plainly to his father that he is not meant for anything great, insisting that both of them are simply ordinary men meant to lead ordinary lives. The argument reaches an apparent climax as Biff hugs Willy and begins to cry as he tries to get Willy to let go of his unrealistic expectations. Rather than listen to what Biff actually says, Willy appears to believe his son has forgiven him and will follow in his footsteps, and after Linda goes upstairs to bed, lapses one final time into a hallucination, thinking he is talking to his long-dead wealthy brother Ben. In Willy&#x27;s mind, Ben &quot;approves&quot; of the scheme Willy has dreamed up to take his own life in order to give Biff his life insurance money to help him start a business and that his funeral will be well attended with all his admirers which will leave Biff feeling “thunderstruck”. Willy then promptly exits the house, and Biff and Linda cry out in despair as the sound of Willy&#x27;s car blares up and fades out. The car crashes and Willy instantly dies.

The final scene takes place at Willy&#x27;s funeral. Linda and Happy stand in surprise after Willy’s funeral is sparsely attended only by his family, Charley, and Bernard (who does not speak during the scene). Biff upholds his belief that he is no longer interested in becoming a businessman like his father. Happy, on the other hand, chooses to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps. Linda who is liberated from her financial burdens begins to sob, repeating “We’re free. . . .” All exit, and the curtain falls.

== Characters and cast ==
Notable casts
* William &quot;Willy&quot; Loman: The titular salesman. The product he is selling is never disclosed and is likely up to the imagination of the audience. He is 63 years old, unstable, insecure, and self-deluded. He vacillates between different eras of his life throughout the play, and re-imagines them as if they were the present. Willy&#x27;s age and deteriorating mental state make him appear childlike. His first name, Willy, reflects this childlike aspect as well as sounding like the question &quot;Will he?&quot;
* Linda Loman: Willy&#x27;s loyal and loving wife. Linda is supportive and docile when Willy talks unrealistically about hopes for the future, although she seems to have a good knowledge of what is really going on. She chides her sons, particularly Biff, for not helping their father, and supports Willy even though Willy treats her poorly. She is the first to realize that Willy is contemplating suicide at the beginning of the play.
* Biff Loman: Willy&#x27;s elder son. Biff had a promising high school football career but failed math his senior year and dropped out of summer school when he saw Willy with another woman. He wavers between going home to try to fulfill Willy&#x27;s dream for him as a businessman or ignoring his father by going West to be a farmhand where he feels happy. Biff steals because he wants evidence of success, even if it is false evidence.
* Harold &quot;Happy&quot; Loman: Willy&#x27;s younger son. He has lived in the shadow of his older brother Biff, but he still tries to be supportive toward his family. He has a restless lifestyle as a womanizer and ambitions of career advancement. He takes bribes at work. He yearns for approval from his parents, but he rarely gets any. He makes things up for attention, such as repeatedly telling his parents he is going to get married. His relationship with Linda is turbulent; she looks down on him for his lifestyle.
* Charley: Willy&#x27;s wisecracking yet kind neighbor. He frequently lends Willy money and plays cards with him, although Willy treats him poorly. Willy is envious of him because his son is more successful than Willy&#x27;s. Charley offers Willy a stable do-nothing job, but Willy declines every time.
* Bernard: Charley&#x27;s son. In Willy&#x27;s flashbacks, he is a nerd, and Willy forces him to give Biff test answers. Later, he is a successful lawyer, married, and expecting a second son – the same successes that Willy wants for his sons.
* Ben: Willy&#x27;s deceased older brother, a diamond tycoon. Though long dead, Willy frequently “speaks” to him in his hallucinations. He represents Willy&#x27;s idea of the American Dream success story, and is shown visiting the Lomans&#x27; house while on business trips to share stories.
* The Woman: A woman, whom Willy calls &quot;Miss Francis&quot;, with whom Willy cheated on Linda.
* Howard Wagner: Willy&#x27;s boss and the owner of the Wagner Company. Willy worked originally for Howard&#x27;s father Frank whom Willy had immense respect for and claims to have suggested the name Howard for his newborn son. After Howard’s father passed away, Howard inherited the company. In contrast to his father, Howard, ingnoring the fact that Willy has devoted 34 years to the firm, sees Willy as nothing but a liability for the company and eventually fires him when Willy loses his temper over Howard refusing to give Willy a New York job. Howard is extremely proud of his wealth, which is manifested in his new wire recorder, and of his family.
* Jenny: Charley&#x27;s secretary.
* Stanley: A waiter at the restaurant Frank’s Chop House who seems to be friends or acquainted with Happy.
* Miss Forsythe: A girl whom Happy picks up at the restaurant. She is attractive and claims to have had her picture on several magazine covers even though she is actually a prostitutite. Happy lies to her, portraying himself and Biff as important and successful individuals by saying that Biff is a star quarterback for the New York Giants and he is a successful champagne salesman.
* Letta: Miss Forsythe&#x27;s friend.

== Themes ==
=== Reality and illusion ===
Reality and illusion are prominent themes in &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;. The play uses flashbacks to present Willy&#x27;s memories, but it is unclear whether they are accurate. He makes up lies about his and Biff&#x27;s success. The more he indulges in the illusion, the harder it is for him to face reality. Biff realizes the problem and wants to face the truth. In this conflict, the play shows how the American Dream could be a lie.

=== Tragedy ===
In several statements, Miller compared the play&#x27;s characters to Greek tragedy. Miller wanted to show that the common man and those with status had much in common.

Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1999, journalist John Tierney argued that the play was not constructed like a classical tragedy. He observed that the mental illness suffered by Loman was a &quot;biochemical abnormality&quot; that was &quot;not the sort of tragic flaw that makes a classic play.&quot; But he noted that &quot;Willy&#x27;s fate is supposed to be partly a result of his own moral failings, in particular the adulterous affair [...], he is haunted by the memory of his infidelity and by the fear that it ruined his son&#x27;s life.&quot;

== Reception ==
=== In the United States ===
&quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; first opened on February 10, 1949, to great success. Drama critic John Gassner wrote that &quot;the ecstatic reception accorded &quot;Death of Salesman&quot; has been reverberating for some time wherever there is an ear for theatre, and it is undoubtedly the best American play since &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;.&quot; Eric Bentley saw the play as &quot;a potential tragedy deflected from its true course by Marxist sympathies.&quot;

=== In the United Kingdom ===
The play opened in London on July 28, 1949. British responses were mixed, but mostly favorable. &quot;The Times&quot; criticized it, saying that &quot;the strongest play of New York theatrical season should be transferred to London in the deadest week of the year.&quot; Eric Keown, theatre critic of &quot;Punch&quot;, praised the production for its &quot;imagination and good theatre-sense&quot;, noting that &quot;Mr. Elia Kazan makes a complicated production seem extraordinarily natural.&quot;

=== In Germany ===
The play was hailed as &quot;the most important and successful night&quot; in Hebbel Theater in Berlin . It was said that &quot;it was impossible to get the audience to leave the theatre&quot; at the end of the performance.

=== In India ===
Compared to Tennessee Williams and Samuel Beckett, Arthur Miller and his &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; were less influential. Rajinder Paul said that &quot;&quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; has only an indirect influence on Indian theatre.&quot; However, it was translated and produced in Bengali as &quot;″Pheriwalar Mrityu″&quot; by the theater group Nandikar. Director Feroz Khan adapted the play in Hindi and English by the name &quot;Salesman Ramlal&quot; played by Satish Kaushik, the son was portrayed by Kishore Kadam.

=== In China ===
Arthur Miller directed the play himself in China, stating that it was easier for the Chinese public to understand the relationship between father and son because &quot;One thing about the play that is very Chinese is the way Willy tries to make his sons successful.&quot; Many traditional Chinese fathers want their sons to be &#x27;dragons.&#x27;

The title role was performed at the Playhouse Theatre (Perth) in March 1979 by Warren Mitchell under the direction of Stephen Barry. In September 1979, Mitchell reprised the role for the Royal National Theatre in London. &quot;It was a performance that won him both an Evening Standard Award and an Olivier and was highly praised by Peter Hall (director), while Arthur Miller reportedly described the turn as one of the best interpretations of the part he had ever seen.&quot;

Christopher Lloyd portrayed Willy Loman in a 2010 production by the Weston Playhouse in Weston, Vermont, which toured several New England venues.

Antony Sher played Willy Loman in the first Royal Shakespeare Company production of the play directed by Gregory Doran in Stratford-upon-Avon in the spring of 2015, with Harriet Walter as Linda Loman.

<doc id="156625" wikidata="Q780350" url="?curid=156625" title="Viva Zapata!">
<text>Viva Zapata! is a 1952 American biographical Western film directed by Elia Kazan, dramatizing the life of Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata from his peasant upbringing through his rise to power in the early 1900s and his death in 1919. It stars Marlon Brando as the title character, and features Jean Peters as his wife Josefa and Anthony Quinn as his brother Eufemio. The screenplay was written by John Steinbeck, using Edgcumb Pinchon&#x27;s 1941 book &quot;Zapata the Unconquerable&quot; as a guide.

To make the film as authentic as possible, Kazan and producer Darryl F. Zanuck studied the numerous photographs that were taken during the revolutionary years, the period between 1909 and 1919, when Zapata led the fight to restore land taken from common people during the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz. Kazan was especially impressed with the Agustín Casasola collection of photographs, and he attempted to duplicate their visual style in the film. Kazan also acknowledged the influence of Roberto Rossellini&#x27;s &quot;Paisan&quot; (1946).

The film was released by 20th Century Fox on February 13, 1952. It received generally positive reviews from critics and was nominated for five Academy Awards, with Anthony Quinn winning for Best Supporting Actor.

==Plot==
Emiliano Zapata is part of a delegation sent to complain about injustices to corrupt longtime president Porfirio Díaz, but Díaz dismisses their concerns, driving Zapata to open rebellion, along with his brother Eufemio. He unites with Pancho Villa under the leadership of naive reformer Francisco Madero.

Díaz is finally toppled and Madero takes his place, but Zapata is dismayed to find that nothing is changing. Madero offers Zapata land of his own while failing to take action to distribute land to the &quot;campesinos&quot; who fought to end the dictatorship and break up the estates of the elites. Zapata rejects the offer and seeks no personal gain. Meanwhile, the ineffectual but well-meaning Madero puts his trust in treacherous general Victoriano Huerta. Huerta first takes Madero captive and then has him murdered.

As it becomes clear that each new regime is no less corrupt and self-serving than the one it replaced, Zapata remains guided by his desire to return to the peasants their recently robbed lands while forsaking his personal interests. His brother sets himself up as a petty dictator, taking what he wants without regard for the law, but Zapata remains a rebel leader of high integrity. Although he is able to defeat Huerta after Madero&#x27;s assassination, as a result of his integrity, Zapata loses his brother and his position.

Although in the end Zapata himself is lured into an ambush and killed, the film suggests that the resistance of the &quot;campesinos&quot; does not end. Rumors begin that Zapata never died, but is instead continuing to fight from the hills, feeding the &quot;campesinos&quot; a sense of hope. As several scenes suggest, over the years, the &quot;campesinos&quot; have learned to lead themselves rather than looking to others to lead them.

==Cast==
==Production==
Filming took place in locations around the American Southwest, including Durango, Colorado, Roma, Texas, San Ygnacio, Texas in Zapata County, and New Mexico.

The screenplay was written by John Steinbeck based on Edgcomb Pinchon&#x27;s 1941 book &quot;Zapata the Unconquerable&quot;. Steinbeck&#x27;s screenplay has been published as a book along with a narrative of Zapata&#x27;s life that Steinbeck also wrote.

Barbara Leaming writes in her biography of Marilyn Monroe that Monroe tried to obtain a part in the film, but failed, presumably because of Darryl F. Zanuck&#x27;s lack of faith in her ability, both as an actress and as a box-office draw.
==Reception==
&quot;Viva Zapata!&quot; received generally positive to mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that of 19 reviews, 58% of critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 6.2/10.

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote a highly favorable review and commented that the film &quot;... throbs with a rare vitality, and a masterful picture of a nation in revolutionary torment has been got by Director Elia Kazan.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot;, however, criticized the direction and script: &quot;Elia Kazan&#x27;s direction strives for a personal intimacy but neither he nor the John Steinbeck scripting achieves in enough measure.&quot;

Senator John McCain listed &quot;Viva Zapata!&quot; as his favorite film of all time.

<text>The Bad and the Beautiful is a 1952 American melodrama film that tells the story of a film producer who alienates everyone around him. The film was directed by Vincente Minnelli, written by George Bradshaw and Charles Schnee, and stars Lana Turner, Kirk Douglas, Walter Pidgeon, Dick Powell, Barry Sullivan, Gloria Grahame and Gilbert Roland. &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; won five Academy Awards out of six nominations in 1952 (including Gloria Grahame winning Best Supporting Actress), a record for the most awards for a movie that was not nominated for Best Picture or for Best Director.

In 2002, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film &quot;culturally significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. The theme song, &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot;, penned by David Raksin, became a jazz standard and has been cited as an example of an excellent movie theme.

&quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; was created by the same team that later worked on another film about the seedy film business, &quot;Two Weeks in Another Town&quot; (1962): director (Vincente Minnelli), producer (John Houseman), screenwriter (Charles Schnee), composer (David Raksin), male star (Kirk Douglas), and studio (MGM). Both films also feature performances of the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Blame Me&quot;, by Leslie Uggams in &quot;Two Weeks&quot; and by Peggy King in &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot;. In one scene of &quot;Two Weeks in Another Town&quot;, the cast watches clips from &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; in a screening room, presented as a film that Douglas&#x27;s character in &quot;Two Weeks&quot;, Jack Andrus, had starred in. &quot;Two Weeks&quot; is not a sequel, however, as the characters in the two stories are unrelated.

==Plot==
In Hollywood, director Fred Amiel (Sullivan), movie star Georgia Lorrison (Turner), and screenwriter James Lee Bartlow (Powell) each refuse to speak by phone to Jonathan Shields (Douglas) in Paris. Movie producer Harry Pebbel (Pidgeon) gathers them in his office and explains that Shields has a new film idea and he wants the three of them for the project. Shields cannot get financing on his own, but with their names attached, there would be no problem. Pebbel asks the three to allow him to get Shields on the phone before they give their final answer.


As they await Shields&#x27; call, Pebbel assures the three that he understands why they refused to speak to Shields. Their involvement with Shields then unfolds in a series of flashbacks. Shields is the son of a notorious former studio head who had been dumped by the industry. The elder Shields was so unpopular that his son had to hire extras to attend his funeral. Despite the ill feelings toward him because of his father, the younger Shields is determined to make it in Hollywood.

Shields partners with aspiring director Amiel, whom he meets at the funeral. Shields intentionally loses money he does not have in a poker game to film executive Pebbel so he can talk Pebbel into letting him work off the debt as a line producer. Shields and Amiel learn their respective trades making B movies for Pebbel. When one of their films becomes a hit, Amiel decides they are ready to take on a more significant project he has been nursing along, and Shields pitches it to the studio. Shields gets a $1 million budget to produce the film, but betrays Amiel by allowing someone with an established reputation to direct. The film&#x27;s success allows Shields to start his own studio, and Pebbel goes to work for him. Amiel becomes an Oscar-winning director.

Shields next encounters alcoholic small-time actress Lorrison, the daughter of a famous actor Shields admired. He builds up her confidence and gives her the leading role in one of his movies over everyone else&#x27;s objections. When she falls in love with him, he lets her think that he feels the same way so that she does not self-destruct and he gets the performance he needs. After the premiere makes her a star overnight, she finds him with a bit player named Lila. He tells her that he will never allow anyone to have that much control over him. Crushed, Lorrison walks out on her contract. Rather than suing her, Shields lets her go to another studio. She becomes a top Hollywood star.

Finally, Bartlow is a contented professor at a small college who has written a bestselling book for which Shields has purchased the film rights. Shields wants Bartlow himself to write the script. Bartlow is not interested, but his shallow Southern belle wife Rosemary is, so he gives in. They go to Hollywood, where her constant distractions keep him from his work. Shields gets his suave actor friend Victor &quot;Gaucho&quot; Ribera to keep her occupied. Freed from interruption, Bartlow makes excellent progress on the script. Rosemary, however, runs away with Gaucho; they are killed in a plane crash. When the script is completed, Shields has the distraught Bartlow remain in Hollywood to help with the production, while Shields takes over directing duties. A first-time director, Shields botches the job, which leads to his bankruptcy. Then Shields lets slip his part in Rosemary&#x27;s involvement with Gaucho, so Bartlow walks out on him. Bartlow goes on to write a novel based upon his wife (something Shields had encouraged him to do) and wins a Pulitzer Prize.

After each flashback, Pebbel sarcastically agrees that Shields &quot;ruined&quot; their lives; each of the three is now at the top of their respective professions, thanks largely to Shields. At last, Shields&#x27;s call comes through and Pebbel asks the three if they will work with Shields just one more time; all three say no. As they leave, Pebbel is still talking to Shields. The three eavesdrop on an extension phone as Shields describes his new idea; they become more and more interested.

==Production==

The film was based on a 1949 magazine story &quot;Of Good and Evil&quot; by George Bradshaw, which was expanded into a longer version called &quot;Memorial to a Bad Man&quot;. It concerned the will and testament of a New York theatre producer who tried to explain his bad behavior to three people he had hurt: a writer, actor and director. MGM bought the film rights and originally Dan Hartman was to produce it. Hartman left for Paramount.

Dore Schary offered the project to John Houseman; it was to be called &quot;Memo to a Bad Man&quot;. Houseman decided to change the milieu from New York theatre to Hollywood because he felt after &quot;All About Eve&quot; that a Hollywood setting would have more novelty.

&quot;I liked it&quot;, said Houseman. &quot;I said, &#x27;I&#x27;ll do it, but not as a Broadway picture.&#x27; I was sick to death of Broadway pictures. I said, &#x27;I wouldn&#x27;t know how to add anything to the stuff that&#x27;s been done, but if you&#x27;ll let me do it as a Hollywood picture, I&#x27;d love to make it.&#x27; &quot;

Clark Gable was originally attached to star; then Spencer Tracy. Eventually Kirk Douglas signed to play the lead. Vincente Minnelli was to direct.

&quot;People who read the script asked me why I wanted to do it&quot;, said Vincente Minnelli. &quot;It was against Hollywood, etc. I told them I didn&#x27;t see the man as an unregenerate heel—first because we find out he has a weakness, which makes him human, and second, because he&#x27;s tough on himself as he is on everyone else, which makes him honest. That&#x27;s the complex, wonderful thing about human beings—whether they&#x27;re in Hollywood, in the automobile business, or in neckties.&quot;

Douglas later recalled being on set with Francis X. Bushman, who had a small part as the paid eulogist of Hugo Shields. He says Bushman told him his career faded away because &quot;at the height of his fame, he inadvertently offended the all-powerful Louis B. Mayer by keeping him waiting a few minutes. Mayer, in turn, banned him from MGM and blackballed him in the industry. This was his first time on the lot in 25 years. Bushman&#x27;s story gave me some useful insight into the ruthless, selfish character I was playing—still another tough-guy antihero. I was doing well with these roles.&quot;

An uncredited Lucy Knoch plays the blonde dancing with Gaucho; she is frequently assumed by modern audiences to be Kim Novak because of the resemblance.

===Relation to real-life personalities===

There has been much debate as to which real-life Hollywood legends are represented by the film&#x27;s characters. At the time of the film&#x27;s release, stories about its basis caused David O. Selznick—whose real life paralleled in some respects that of the &quot;father-obsessed independent producer&quot; Jonathan Shields—to have his lawyer view the film and determine whether it contained any libelous material. Shields is thought to be a blending of Selznick, Orson Welles and Val Lewton. Dore Schary, head of MGM at the time, said Shields was a combination of &quot;David O. Selznick and as yet unknown David Merrick.&quot;

Lewton&#x27;s &quot;Cat People&quot; is clearly the inspiration behind the early Shields–Amiel film &quot;Doom of the Cat Men&quot;.

The Georgia Lorrison character is the daughter of a &quot;Great Profile&quot; actor like John Barrymore (Diana Barrymore&#x27;s career was in fact launched the same year as her father&#x27;s death), but it can also be argued that Lorrison includes elements of Minnelli&#x27;s ex-wife Judy Garland.

Gilbert Roland&#x27;s Gaucho may almost be seen as self-parody, as he had recently starred in a series of Cisco Kid pictures, though the character&#x27;s name, Ribera, would seem to give a nod also to famed Hollywood seducer Porfirio Rubirosa. The casting of Roland as Gaucho may also be a reference to his long-term, real-life affair with actress Norma Talmadge, then the wife of producer Joseph M. Schenck, during the waning years of the silent film era and the early years of the talkies.

The director Henry Whitfield (Leo G. Carroll) is a &quot;difficult&quot; director modeled on Alfred Hitchcock, and his assistant Miss March (Kathleen Freeman) is modeled on Hitchcock&#x27;s wife Alma Reville. The other director, von Ellstein, may be modeled after Erich von Stroheim and Josef von Sternberg.

The James Lee Bartlow character may have been inspired by Paul Eliot Green, the University of North Carolina academic-turned-screenwriter of &quot;The Cabin in the Cotton&quot;. But Bartlow also resembles novelist William Faulkner, who worked on many of Hollywood&#x27;s best movies—and had an easier relationship with the industry than he did with his wife. She, like her movie counterpart, was a difficult, often-demanding ex-Southern belle.

Houseman later said, &quot;The producer was thought to be Selznick, and of course it largely is, but—well, is &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; Hearst? Yes, it is Hearst, but also Pulitzer and a lot of other legendary people. So it was Selznick, Zanuck, and all others. Just as the foreign director could be Stroheim or Fritz Lang. When you start to work in a legendary world, you get legendary figures.&quot;

==Release==
The film was shot as &quot;Tribute to a Bad Man&quot; but the studio worried it would be mistaken for a western. The title was changed to &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; at the suggestion of MGM&#x27;s head of publicity Howard Dietz who took it from F. Scott Fitzgerald. Houseman admitted he thought it was a &quot;dreadful title, it&#x27;s a loathsome, cheap, vulgar, title&quot; but then when the film became successful 
&quot;it seemed like one of the greatest titles ever thought of. It&#x27;s certainly been imitated enough: any time anybody&#x27;s really hard up for a title, they just take two adjectives and string them together with an &quot;and&quot; in between.&quot;

==Reception==
According to MGM records, the film earned $2,367,000 in the US and Canada and $1,006,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $484,000. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 80% from 49 reviews with the consensus: &quot;Melodrama at its most confident, &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; is an ode to moviemaking that offers unblinking insight into the ugly egos that have shaped Hollywood history.&quot;

===Accolades===
At the 1953 ceremony, actress Gloria Grahame&#x27;s performance as Rosemary Bartlow, which occupied only just 9 minutes and 32 seconds of screen time, was at the time the shortest performance to ever win an Academy Award, a record she held until the 1977 ceremony when Beatrice Straight won Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Network&quot; and set a new record of 5 minutes and 2 seconds.

==Theme song==

David Raksin wrote the theme song &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; (originally called &quot;Love is For the Very Young&quot;) for the film. Upon first hearing the song, Minnelli and Houseman nearly rejected it, but were convinced to keep it by Adolph Green and Betty Comden. After the film&#x27;s release, the song became a hit and a jazz standard, and has been widely covered.

A number of film music experts and composers, including Stephen Sondheim, have highly praised the theme. In a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; article about the theme entitled &quot;Anatomy of a Great Movie Theme&quot;, critic Michael Phillips wrote, &quot;Its hypnotic way of combining dissonance with resolutions that never quite resolve when, or how, you expect them to, keeps a listener perpetually intrigued. The bittersweet quality proves elusive and addictive. It&#x27;s perfect for the Douglas character, and for what Minnelli called the Hollywood-insider script&#x27;s alternately &#x27;affectionate and cynical&#x27; air.&quot;

==Home media==
&quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; was released to DVD by Warner Home Video on February 5, 2002, as a Region 1 fullscreen DVD. It was released on Blu-ray from Warner Archive on November 19, 2019.

<text>A crescent shape (, ) is a symbol or emblem used to represent the lunar phase (as it appears in the northern hemisphere) in the first quarter (the &quot;sickle moon&quot;), or by extension a symbol representing the Moon itself.

In Hindu Iconography, Shiva is often shown wearing a crescent moon on his head, symbolising his control over time, as well as his attributes of both creation and destruction.

It is used as the astrological symbol for the Moon, and hence as the alchemical symbol for silver. It was also the emblem of Diana/Artemis, and hence represented virginity. In veneration of Mary in the Catholic Church, it is associated with Mary, mother of Jesus.

From its use as roof finial in Ottoman mosques, it has also become associated with Islam, and the crescent was introduced as chaplain badge for Muslim United States military chaplains in 1993.

==Symbolism==

The crescent symbol is primarily used to represent the Moon, not necessarily in a particular lunar phase.
When used to represent a waxing or waning lunar phase, &quot;crescent&quot; or &quot;increscent&quot; refers to the waxing first quarter, while the symbol representing the waning final quarter is called &quot;decrescent&quot;.

The crescent symbol was long used as a symbol of the Moon in astrology, and by extension of Silver (as the corresponding metal) in alchemy. The astrological use of the symbol is attested in early Greek papyri containing horoscopes.
In the 2nd-century &quot;Bianchini&#x27;s planisphere&quot;, the personification of the Moon is shown with a crescent attached to her headdress.

Its ancient association with Ishtar/Astarte and Diana is preserved in the Moon (as symbolised by a crescent) representing the female principle (as juxtaposed with the Sun representing the male principle), and (Artemis-Diana being a virgin goddess) especially virginity and female chastity.
In Christian symbolism, the crescent entered Marian iconography, by the association of Mary with the Woman of the Apocalypse (described with &quot;the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars&quot; in Revelation)
The most well known representation of Mary as the Woman of the Apocalypse is the Virgin of Guadalupe.
==Shape==
The crescent shape is a type of lune, the latter consisting of a circular disk with a portion of another disk removed from it, so that what remains is a shape enclosed by two circular arcs which intersect at two points. In a crescent, the enclosed shape does not include the center of the original disk.

The tapered regions towards the points of intersection of the two arcs are known as the &quot;horns&quot; of the crescent. The classical crescent shape has its horns pointing upward (and is often worn as horns when worn as a crown or diadem, e.g. in depictions of the lunar goddess, or in the headdress of Persian kings, etc.

The word &quot;&quot; is derived etymologically from the present participle of the Latin verb &quot;&quot; &quot;to grow&quot;, technically denoting the waxing moon (). As seen from the northern hemisphere, the waxing Moon tends to appear with its horns pointing towards the left, and conversely the waning Moon with its horns pointing towards the right; the English word &quot;crescent&quot; may however refer to the shape regardless of its orientation, except for the technical language of blazoning used in heraldry, where the word &quot;increscent&quot; refers to a crescent shape with its horns to the left, and &quot;decrescent&quot; refers to one with its horns to the right, while the word &quot;crescent&quot; on its own denotes a crescent shape with horns pointing upward.

The shape of the lit side of a spherical body (most notably the Moon) that appears to be less than half illuminated by the Sun as seen by the viewer appears in a different shape from what is generally termed a crescent in planar geometry: 
Assuming the terminator lies on a great circle, the crescent Moon will actually appear as the figure bounded by a half-ellipse and a half-circle, with the major axis of the ellipse coinciding with a diameter of the semicircle.

Unicode encodes a crescent (increscent) at U+263D (☽) and a decrescent at U+263E (☾).

==History==
===Early history===

The crescent shape is used to represent the Moon, and the Moon deity Nanna/Sin from an early time, visible in Akkadian cylinder seals as early as 2300 BC.

The Egyptian logograph representing the Moon also had a crescent shape N11 (Gardiner N11, &quot;moon&quot; (with increscent and decrescent variants); variant N12 N12). In addition, there is a 19th-dynasty hieroglyph representing the &quot;moon with its lower half obscured (N9 N9 , with a variant with a crescent shape N10 N10).

The crescent was well used in the iconography of the ancient Near East and was used by the Phoenicians in the 8th century BC as far as Carthage and Numidia in modern Tunisia and Algeria. The crescent and star also appears on pre-Islamic coins of South Arabia.

The combination of star and crescent also arises in the ancient Near East, representing the Moon and Ishtar (the planet Venus), often combined into a triad with the solar disk. It was inherited both in Sassanian and Hellenistic iconography.

===Classical antiquity===
Selene, the moon goddess, was depicted with a crescent upon her head, often referred to as her horns, and a major identifying feature of hers in ancient works of art.

In the iconography of the Hellenistic period, the crescent became the symbol of Artemis-Diana, the virgin hunter goddess associated with the Moon. Numerous depictions show Artemis-Diana wearing the crescent Moon as part of her headdress.
The related symbol of the star and crescent was the emblem of the Mithradates dynasty in the Kingdom of Pontus and was also used as the emblem of Byzantium.

===Middle Ages===



The crescent remained in use as an emblem in the Sasanian Empire, used as a Zoroastrian regal or astrological symbol. In the Crusades it came to be associated with the Orient (the Byzantine Empire, the Levant and Outremer in general) and was widely used (often alongside a star) in Crusader seals and coins. It was used as a heraldic charge by the later 13th century. Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus, the claimant to the Byzantine Empire who ruled Cyprus until overthrown by the crusading King Richard I of England, used arms with &quot;a crescent of gold on a shade of azure, with a blazing star of eight points&quot;. Later, King Richard granted the same as the coat of arms of the city of Portsmouth, in recognition of the significant involvement of soldiers, sailors, and vessels from Portsmouth in the conquest of Cyprus. This remains Portsmouth&#x27;s coat of arms up to the present.

Anna Notaras, daughter of the last &quot;megas doux&quot; of the Byzantine Empire Loukas Notaras, after the fall of Constantinople and her emigration to Italy, made a seal with her coat of arms which included &quot;two lions holding above the crescent a cross or a sword&quot;.

From its use in the Sasanian Empire, the crescent also found its way into Islamic iconography after the Muslim conquest of Persia. Umar is said to have hung two crescent-shaped ornaments captured from the Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon in the Kaaba.
The crescent also became the symbol of the Umayyad Caliphate. The crescent appears to have been adopted as an emblem on military flags by the Islamic armies from at least the 13th century, although the scholarly consensus holds that the widespread use of the crescent in Islam develops later, during the 14th to 15th century.
The use of such flags is reflected in the 14th-century &quot;Libro del Conoscimiento&quot; and the Catalan Atlas.
Examples include the flags attributed to Gabes, Tlemcen, Tunis and Buda, Nubia/Dongola (documented by Angelino Dulcert in 1339) and the Mamluks of Egypt.

The Roman Catholic fashion of depicting Madonna standing or sitting on a crescent develops in the 15th century.

===Early modern and modern===
The goddess Diana was associated with the Moon in classical mythology. In reference to this, feminine jewelry representing crescents, especially diadems, became popular in the early modern period. The tarot card of the &quot;Popess&quot; also wears a crescent on her head.

Conrad Grünenberg in his &quot;Pilgrimage to the Holy Land&quot; (1486) consistently depicts cities in the Holy Land with crescent finials.
Flags with crescents appear to have been used on Ottoman vessels since at least the 16th century.

Prints depicting the Battle of Lepanto (1571), including the print by Agostino Barberigo of Rome made just a few weeks after the battle, and the Martino Rota of Venice in the following year, show the Ottoman vessels displaying flags with one or several crescents in various orientations (as do the monumental paintings commissioned later based on these prints). Rota also shows numerous crescent finials, both on ships and on fortresses depicted in the background, as well as some finials with stars or suns radiant, and in some cases a sun radiant combined with a crescent in the star-and-crescent configuration.

The official adoption of star and crescent as the Ottoman state symbol started during the reign of Sultan Mustafa III (1757–1774) and its use became well-established during Sultan Abdul Hamid I (1774–1789) and Sultan Selim III (1789–1807) periods. A &quot;&quot; (decree) from 1793 states that the ships in the Ottoman navy have that flag.

Muhammad Ali, who became Pasha of Egypt in 1805, introduced the first national flag of Egypt, red with three white crescents, each accompanied by a white star.

The association of the crescent with the Ottoman Empire appears to have resulted in a gradual association of the crescent shape with Islam in the 20th century. A Red Crescent appears to have been used as a replacement of the Red Cross as early as in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877/8, and it was officially adopted in 1929.

While some Islamic organisations since the 1970s have embraced the crescent as their logo or emblem (e.g. &quot;Crescent International&quot; magazine, established 1980), some Muslim publications tend to emphasize that the interpretation of the crescent, historically used on the banners of Muslim armies, as a &quot;religious symbol&quot; of Islam was an error made by the &quot;Christians of Europe&quot;. The identification of the crescent as an &quot;Islamic symbol&quot; is mentioned by James Hastings as a &quot;common error&quot; to which &quot;even approved writers on Oriental subjects&quot; are prone as early as 1928.

The crescent was used on a flag of the American Revolutionary War and was called the Liberty (or Moultrie) Flag.

The symbol of the Triple Goddess is a circle flanked by a left facing and right facing crescent, which represents a maiden, mother and crone archetype. The biohazard symbol bears peculiar resemblance to it.

==Heraldry==
The crescent has been used as a heraldic charge since the 13th century. 
In heraldic terminology, the term &quot;crescent&quot; when used alone refers to a crescent with the horns pointing upward. A crescent with the horns pointing left (&quot;dexter&quot;) is called &quot;a crescent increscent&quot; (or simply &quot;an increscent&quot;), and when the horns are pointing right (&quot;sinister&quot;), it is called &quot;a crescent decrescent&quot; (or &quot;a decrescent&quot;). A crescent with horns pointing down is called &quot;a crescent reversed&quot;. Two crescents with horns pointing away from each other are called &quot;addorsed&quot;.
&quot;Siebmachers Wappenbuch&quot; (1605) has 48 coats of arms with one or more crescents, for example:
*&quot;Azure, a crescent moon argent pierced by an arrow fesswise Or all between in chief three mullets of six points and in base two mullets of six points argent&quot; (von Hagen, p. 176);
*&quot;Azure, an increscent and a decrescent addorsed Or&quot; (von Stoternheim, p. 146);
*&quot;Per pale Or and sable, a crescent moon and in chief three mullets of six points counterchanged&quot; (von Bodenstein, p. 182).
In English heraldry, the crescent is used as a difference denoting a second son.

==Contemporary use==
The crescent remains in use as astrological symbol and astronomical symbol representing the Moon. 
Use of a standalone crescent in flags is less common than the star and crescent combination. Crescents without stars are found in the South Carolina state flag (1861), All India Muslim League (1906-1947), the flag of Maldives (1965), the 
flag of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (1981) and the flag of the Arab League.

New Orleans is nicknamed &quot;the Crescent City&quot;, and a crescent (or crescent and star) is used to represent the city in official emblems.

Crescents, often with faces, are found on numerous modern municipal coats of arms in Europe, e.g.
Germany: Bönnigheim, Dettighofen, Dogern, Jesenwang, Karstädt, Michelfeld (Angelbachtal), Waldbronn; 
Switzerland: Boswil, Dättlikon, Neerach (from the 16th-century Neuamt coat of arms);
France: Katzenthal, Mortcerf;
Malta: Qormi;
Sweden: Trosa.

The crescent printed on military ration boxes is the US Department of Defense symbol for subsistence items. The symbol is used on packaged foodstuffs but not on fresh produce or on items intended for resale.

Since 1993, the crescent has also been in use as chaplain badge for Muslim chaplains in the US military.

==Other things called &quot;crescent&quot;==
The term &quot;crescent&quot; may also refer to objects with a shape reminiscent of the crescent shape, such as houses forming an arc, a type of solitaire game, Crescent Nebula, glomerular crescent (crescent shaped scar of the glomeruli of the kidney), the Fertile Crescent (the fertile area of land between Mesopotamia and Egypt roughly forming a crescent shape), and the &quot;croissant&quot; (the French form of the word) for the crescent-shaped pastry.

<doc id="156632" wikidata="Q1168531" url="?curid=156632" title="The Lavender Hill Mob">
<text>The Lavender Hill Mob is a 1951 British comedy film from Ealing Studios, written by T. E. B. Clarke, directed by Charles Crichton, starring Alec Guinness and Stanley Holloway and featuring Sid James and Alfie Bass. The title refers to Lavender Hill, a street in Battersea, a district in London SW11, near to Clapham Junction railway station.

The British Film Institute ranked &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot; the 17th greatest British film of all time. The original film was digitally restored and re-released to UK cinemas on 29 July 2011 to celebrate its 60th anniversary. It is one of fifteen films listed in the category &quot;Art&quot; on the Vatican film list.

==Plot==
Henry Holland lives the life of luxury in Rio de Janeiro, and spends an evening dining out with a British visitor. During their meal, he narrates a story concerning how he changed his life by instigating an intricate gold bullion robbery. One year ago, Holland served as an unambitious London bank clerk, who for twenty years was in charge of gold bullion deliveries. Although dedicated to his job with a reputation for fussing over details, he had begun to devise a scheme to steal a consignment of gold bullion. His plan was missing a way to sell the gold, as the black market in Britain would be too risky, and he did not yet know how to smuggle it abroad.

One evening at his boarding house in Lavender Hill, he meets with artist Alfred Pendlebury, who has taken up lodgings in the building. He learns that Pendlebury owns a foundry that makes presents and souvenirs that are sold in holiday destinations, one of which is Paris.

Realizing that Pendlebury is the key to his plan&#x27;s success, Holland explains his scheme to the artist who agrees to help. When the clerk discovers he is due to be transferred to another bank department, the pair put their plan into immediate action, recruiting the aid of petty thieves Lackery Wood and Shorty Fisher. On the day of the robbery, Wood and Fisher hijack the bullion van and switch the gold to one of Pendlebury&#x27;s works vans. Holland then assumes the role of an unfortunate victim who is hailed as a hero for raising the alarm, after nearly drowning by accident. As his associates melt down the gold bullion and recast it as Eiffel Tower paperweights to be exported abroad, Holland gives false statements and misleading clues to the police, led by Inspector Farrow. The group soon toast to their success, despite Wood and Fisher being unable or unwilling to travel to Paris to collect their share in person, entrusting the other two to provide it.

The day after their last consignment of stolen gold is sent to Paris, Holland and Pendlebury head to France to retrieve them from a souvenir kiosk atop the Eiffel Tower supplied by Pendlebury&#x27;s firm. They are horrified when they find one of the boxes containing the golden paperweights has been opened by mistake and six have been sold to a group of English schoolgirls. The pair make a wild chase to pursue them back to Britain, manage to track down the schoolgirls, but only get back five of the paperweights. The girl holding the sixth one refuses, intending it as a gift to a policeman she is friends with. Holland and Pendlebury pursue the girl, and watch in horror as the paperweight is brought to an exhibition of police history and methods at Hendon Police College. Holland&#x27;s worst fears come true when Farrow, having begun to realize the truth, spots the paperweight and orders a chemical test on it.

Left with no choice, Holland snatches it, and he and Pendlebury make their escape in a stolen police car. A confusing pursuit begins across London, as Holland uses the car&#x27;s radio to feed false, misleading information to the officers pursuing the pair. They find themselves forced to offer a passing police officer a lift, causing them to be discovered. As Pendlebury becomes trapped, Holland escapes with the six golden paperweights, which leave him with a tidy sum to enjoy a new life. Back in Rio, after finishing his tale to his visitor, Holland admits that the money is now all gone. As the pair walk out, it is revealed that Holland is handcuffed to the man and has been arrested for his crime.

==Cast==
==Cast notes==

Audrey Hepburn makes an early film appearance in a small role as Chiquita near the start of the film. Robert Shaw also made his first film appearance, playing a police laboratory technician towards the end of the film. English actress Patricia Garwood made her first film appearance in this movie at the age of nine.

==Production==
Charles Crichton says the origin of the film came with the success of &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot;. Michael Balcon, head of Ealing, got screenwriter Clarke to come up with ideas for a follow-up.

Clarke is said to have come up with the idea of a clerk robbing his own bank while doing research for the film &quot;Pool of London&quot; (1951), a crime thriller surrounding a jewel theft. He consulted the Bank of England on the project and it set up a special committee to advise on how best the robbery could take place.

Extensive location filming was made in both London and Paris. The scenes show a London still marked by bomb sites from the Second World War.

;London
* Bank Underground Station
* Bank of England, Threadneedle Street
* Bramley Arms Pub, Bramley Road, Notting Hill (finale: end of the chase)
* Cheapside
* Carlton Road, Ealing (zebra crossing on way to police exhibition)
* Gunnersbury Park (police exhibition)
* Queen Victoria Street, Blackfriars (scene of bullion robbery)
* RAF Northolt, Ruislip (airport)

;Paris
* River Seine
* Eiffel Tower

The scene where Holland and Pendlebury run down the Eiffel Tower&#x27;s spiral staircase and become increasingly dizzy and erratic, as does the camera work, presages James Stewart&#x27;s condition in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Vertigo&quot;, made seven years later. A film montage of sensational newspaper headlines marks the crime as taking place in August 1950, whilst posters for the Hendon exhibition state that it marks the centenary of the death of Sir Robert Peel, which occurred on 2 July 1850. In the car chase scene at the end of the film, an officer uses a police box to report seeing a police car being driven by a man in a top hat. In fact, the driver is a modern-day police officer from the exhibition wearing the uniform of the police as originally set up in 1829 by Peel, known as &quot;Bobbies&quot; or &quot;Peelers&quot; after him.

==Reception==
&quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot; had its charity world premiere at the Marble Arch Odeon cinema in London on 28 June 1951. The film was popular at the British box office. It had rentals of $580,000 at the U.S. box office.
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a positive review, writing &quot;Charles Crichton has directed the whole thing with a touch of polite and gentile mockery applied to wholehearted farce: that Mr. Guinness and Mr. Holloway are deliciously adroit in their roles.&quot;

Reviewing the film on its sixtieth anniversary, Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;tremendously good fun, though lighter in tone than Ealing&#x27;s two scabrous masterpieces Kind Hearts and Coronets and The Ladykillers, and not quite matching their elegant perfection&quot; noting that the superb setup is not quite matched by the aftermath of the heist. Kim Newman writing for Empire magazine gave it 4 out of 5, &quot;Guinness is masterful as the apparently unassuming Mr. Holland&quot;.

== Accolades ==
The film won the Academy Award for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay. Guinness was nominated for the award of Best Actor in a Leading Role. The film also won the BAFTA Award for Best British Film.

== Stage adaptation ==
A stage adaptation of the film written by Phil Porter and directed by Jeremy Sams opened in October 2022 at the Everyman Theatre, Cheltenham before touring the UK, starring Miles Jupp as Henry Holland and Justin Edwards as Alfred Pendlebury.

<doc id="156635" wikidata="Q2540262" url="?curid=156635" title="Glossophobia">
<text>Glossophobia or speech anxiety is the fear of public speaking. The word &quot;glossophobia&quot; derives from the Greek γλῶσσα &quot;glossa&quot; (tongue) and φόβος &quot;phobos&quot; (fear or dread.) The causes of glossophobia are uncertain but explanations include communibiology and the illusion of transparency. Further explanations range from nervousness produced by a lack of preparation to, one of the most common psychiatric disorders, social anxiety disorder (SAD).

Its symptoms include one or more of physiological changes, mental disruptions, and detrimental speech performance. There are several ways to overcome glossophobia, which include preparation and rehearsing, deconstructing beliefs, engaging in positive self-talk, visualizing optimal performance, practicing mindfulness, breathing exercises, creating an anxiety hierarchy, using virtual reality, computerized coaches and medications such as beta-blockers.

== Causes ==
Considerable research has been conducted into the causes of glossophobia, with a number of potential causes being suggested. One proposed explanation is that these anxieties are a specific symptom of social anxiety produced by fearfulness related to the fight-or-flight response, which is produced by a perceived threat; this triggers an elevated defense reaction in the sympathetic nervous system to be alert, to run, hide or freeze. It is linked to the psychiatric condition known as social anxiety disorder (SAD) which is a mental predisposition to believe that social interactions will result in harsh negative judgement from others and poor outcomes because of such judgement; thus, before the social interaction occurs such as a public speech, the individual creates negative thoughts of failure, dread and the idea of being incapable, producing negative feelings and physiological responses.

Individuals who suffer from SAD engage in negative visualization and self-talk which halt their attention and ability to stay focused and drain their cognitive power and physical energy. People suffering from SAD believe they are just not good at public speaking, setting a belief as a fact and falling victim to a popular psychological phenomenon known as self-fulfilling prophecy. Moreover, individuals with SAD add more mental pressure because they commonly expect others to like them or accept them, measure their self-worth by their social interaction performance, and believe that showing emotions is the same as showing weakness.

A study with 59 individuals diagnosed with SAD and 63 non-anxious individuals in which they were engaged in an unexpected public speech, received standardized positive or neutral feedback and were asked to recall their positive feedback five minutes later and one week after their unexpected performance. Individuals suffering from SAD recalled their feedback less positively than what it had been, whereas some non-anxious individuals even recalled their feedback more positively suggesting a self-protective drive to maintain their self-esteem.

In addition, other key causes of this anxiety have been identified as the novelty of the experience, the characteristics of the audience, the illusion of transparency and the degree to which the speaker identifies public speaking as a performance as opposed to an act of communication.

== Symptoms ==
The more specific symptoms of speech anxiety can be grouped into three categories: physical, verbal, and non-verbal. Physical symptoms include: shaking, sweating, butterflies in the stomach, dry mouth, and rapid heartbeats. As Garcia-Lopez (2013) has noted, symptoms can include acute hearing, increased heart rate and blood pressure, dilated pupils, increased perspiration and oxygen intake, stiffening of neck/upper back muscles, and dry mouth. Uncontrollable shaking is also common and often occurs prior to the phobia-eliciting stimulus. Verbal symptoms include (but are not limited to) a tense or quivering voice, and vocalized pauses known as vocal fillers or speech disfluency.  Nonverbal symptoms could include going blank during the speech, and remaining dependent on note cards.

== Help and relief ==

Training courses in public speaking and/or organizations such as Australian Rostrum, Toastmasters International, POWERtalk International, and Association of Speakers Clubs or cultural activities at school level can help people to reduce their fear of public speaking to manageable levels. To temporarily treat their phobia, some affected people have turned to certain types of medications, typically beta blockers.

In some cases, anxiety can be mitigated by a speaker not attempting to resist their anxiety, thus fortifying the anxiety/fight-or-flight loop. Other strategies involve using one&#x27;s nervousness to enliven an otherwise fearful speech presentation.

Traditional advice has been to urge fearful speakers not to take themselves too seriously, and to be reminded that mistakes are often unnoticed by audiences. Gaining experience in public speaking often results in it becoming less anxiety-provoking over time. Recent studies suggest that there is a close link between fear of public speaking and self-efficacy and that attempts to help presenters improve their self-efficacy will also reduce this fear.

Loosening up a &quot;tough crowd&quot; by asking questions promotes audience participation. A speaker may also find this exercise to be helpful when their mind &quot;goes blank&quot;, as it gives them time to regain their train of thought.

New treatments for glossophobia are starting to emerge through the medium of Virtual reality where environments with sufficient realism can evoke a response in the user allowing for a virtual form of exposure therapy known as VRET. These self-administered treatments have been shown to be effective, but it is a relatively new field and more research is needed.

<doc id="156637" wikidata="Q2066396" url="?curid=156637" title="Reigate and Banstead">
<text>Reigate and Banstead is a local government district with borough status in Surrey, England. Its council is based in Reigate and the borough also includes the towns of Banstead, Horley and Redhill. Parts of the borough are within the Surrey Hills, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Northern parts of the borough, including Banstead, lie inside the M25 motorway which encircles London.

The neighbouring districts are Tandridge, Crawley, Mole Valley, Epsom and Ewell, Sutton and Croydon, the latter two being London boroughs.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole of two former districts and part of a third, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Banstead Urban District
*Dorking and Horley Rural District (Horley and Salfords and Sidlow parishes only, rest went to Mole Valley except area of Gatwick Airport which went to Crawley)
*Reigate Municipal Borough (which included Redhill)
The new district was named Reigate and Banstead after two of the former districts.

The district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==
Reigate and Banstead Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Surrey County Council, which is also based in Reigate, having its headquarters at Woodhatch Place. In the south of the borough are two civil parishes at Horley and Salfords and Sidlow, which form a third tier of local government for their areas.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since March 2024, being led by a Conservative minority administration.

The first elections to the council were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Reigate and Banstead. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2003 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election and a subsequent change of allegiance later in May 2024, the composition of the council was:
The two residents&#x27; associations and the independent councillor sit together as a group. The next election is due in May 2026.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2019 the council has comprised 45 councillors representing 15 wards, with each ward electing three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four, with a third of the council (one councillor for each ward) being elected each time for a four-year term of office. Surrey County Council elections are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no borough council elections.

===Premises===
The council is based at Reigate Town Hall on Castlefield Road, which had been completed in 1901 for the old Reigate Borough Council.

==Geography==
The northern third of the borough is on the North Downs or its upper slopes. Commanding viewpoints exist in several locations in this area with the southern aspects of Colley Hill and Reigate Hill noteworthy enough to have had a major memorial and a picnic area with large café respectively. Historically much of this third was named &quot;Walton Heath&quot; and &quot;Banstead Heath&quot;.

The softer Greensand Ridge which is parallel to the south breaks up in the middle of the borough, forming the Redhill basin and various mounds around Reigate before continuing in both directions at higher elevations, see the Greensand Way. The Mole forms a section of the western border of the borough down to Wonham Mill at the western extreme of Flanchford in the Reigate post town, itself at a millpond at the foot of the wooded &quot;Snag Brook&quot; a tributary which rises near the A25 Dorking Road. Much of the borough is Metropolitan Green Belt.

There are significant areas of forest and heath management, including five reserves within the national wildlife trust scheme: see Surrey Wildlife Trust.

==Settlements and parishes==

There are only two civil parishes in the borough, being Horley, and Salfords and Sidlow. The parish council for Horley has declared its parish to be a town, allowing it to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. The pre-1974 borough of Reigate and urban district of Banstead form an unparished area.

Settlements and suburbs in the borough include:

*Banstead
*Burgh Heath
*Chipstead
*Earlswood
*Epsom Downs (part)
*Gatton
*Hooley
*Horley
*Kingswood
*Lower Kingswood
*Margery
*Meadvale
*Merstham
*Mogador
*Netherne-on-the-Hill
*Nork 
*Redhill
*Reigate
*Salfords 
*Sidlow
*Tadworth
*Tattenham Corner
*Walton-on-the-Hill
*Whitebushes
*Woodhatch
*Woodmansterne
==Economy==
The economy is diverse, with a strong local service sector, city workers as most locations are easily within the London Commuter Belt, trades, a developed public/education sector and several farms concentrated towards cereal and root vegetable agriculture. There is an extent of woodland management. Several employers with an international renown are found in force in and around the two most commercial towns centres of Reigate and Redhill: including Willis Towers Watson, Just, Kimberly Clark, Travelers Group (insurance), AXA Insurance breakdown, Black &amp; Veatch and Esure. Pfizer UK headquarters is by the M25 motorway in Walton-on-the-Hill. Notably Sutton and East Surrey Water is headquartered in Redhill and SGN in Horley. A choice of hotels exists in and around Horley including its adjacent neighbourhood, sometimes named independently by businesses and residents, &quot;Hookwood&quot;, on the east and north outskirts of London Gatwick Airport respectively.

In the late 20th century the airline Dan-Air had its head office in the Newman House in Horley, and Air Europe had its head office in Reigate.

==Transport==
===Roads===
The M25 motorway passes from the middle of the east of the borough to just south of the tripoint with Epsom and Ewell and Mole Valley and has two junctions, one for the M23 motorway that passes through the eastern side of the borough north–south and starts in the northeast of the borough, the other at Reigate Hill. The A23 road from London splits into the ongoing A23 from the south and the M23 at Hooley.

The A217 road is a second London road starting in Reigate via Banstead and Sutton and on to London. Two traditional, mostly up to county distance alternatives inspired the names of the north–south/east-west motorway: the low A25 between Godstone/Guildford and the A23, the latter being used for the London to Brighton events.

===Rail===

The main train operator in the borough is Southern, with other services being operated by Thameslink and Great Western Railway. Through routes are the North Downs Line and the more heavily used London to Brighton line that has several operators plus several branch service routes operating to London (the destination in the borough of one such service is Reigate). Although these are the main railways for long and short-distance travel, two branch lines cut through lower parts of the North Downs plateau in the north (to Tattenham Corner via Kingswood and to Epsom Downs via Banstead, all four stations being in the borough).

==Twinning==
The borough is twinned with:
* Eschweiler in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany since 1985
* Brunoy in Essonne, France since 1991

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms is a combination of the elements of the Reigate shield, the device of Banstead and symbols of the parishes of Horley and Salfords and Sidlow.

The shield has a background of blue and yellow chequers taken from the arms of the de Warenne family. William de Warenne accompanied William the Conqueror from Normandy and was the first Earl of Surrey and the builder of Reigate Castle. Against this pattern is the Reigate Castle Gate and oak tree.

The top of the shield has a black background as in the original Reigate arms but on which is a gold woolpack between two sprigs of oak. The woolpack or woolsack refers to the former importance of sheep rearing and wool production in Banstead. The oak sprigs represent the two parishes of Horley and Salfords and Sidlow.

Above the shield is a helmet with a wreath and draped cloth also in the blue and gold of the de Warennes. On top of the helmet is a pilgrim referring to the ancient route along the escarpment of the North Downs by Banstead and Reigate, the Pilgrims Way.

On either side of the shield is a white lion and a white horse. The lion comes from the arms of the de Mowbray family who were briefly Lords of the Manor of Banstead in the 12th century. The horse refers to the tradition of horse racing on Banstead Downs in the 17th century and immortalised in the Oaks race of Epsom Derby Friday. On the necks of the animals are wreaths again in the blue and yellow. On the shoulders are roundels of blue and white waves indicating the River Mole in Horley and Sidlow.

The roundel on the lion has a tanner&#x27;s (or flaying) knife, the emblem of St Bartholomew, the patron of Horley, who is said to have been flayed or skinned before he was crucified. The roundel on the shoulder of the horse has a sallow leaf, a reference to Salfords, which is derived from Sallow Ford. The Sallow tree is commonly known as Pussy Willow.

The motto &quot;Never Wonne ne never shall&quot; is taken from an ancient couplet and refers to the defeat of the Danes by King Alfred in a battle in the Vale of Holmesdale in the 9th century, now remembered in the name Battlebridge. Reigate Castle has also been known as Holmesdale Castle. A translation is &quot;Never conquered nor never shall&quot;.

==Freedom of the Borough==
The following people and military units have received the Freedom of the Borough of Reigate and Banstead.

===Individuals===
* Ernest A. Crowe (1988)
* Norman C. Smith (1995)
* Dr. Michael &quot;Mike&quot; Ormerod (2007)

<text>Alexandre Dumas (; 27 July 1824 – 27 November 1895) was a French author and playwright, best known for the romantic novel &quot;La Dame aux Camélias&quot; (&quot;The Lady of the Camellias&quot;, usually titled &quot;Camille&quot; in English-language versions), published in 1848, which was adapted into Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s 1853 opera &quot;La traviata&quot; (&quot;The Fallen Woman&quot;), as well as numerous stage and film productions.

Dumas (French for &quot;son&quot;) was the son of Alexandre Dumas (&quot;father&quot;), also a well-known playwright and author of classic works such as &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;. Dumas was admitted to the (French Academy) in 1874 and awarded the Legion of Honour in 1894.

==Biography==


Dumas was born in Paris, France, the illegitimate child of (1794–1868), a dressmaker, and novelist Alexandre Dumas. In 1831 his father legally recognized him and ensured that the young Dumas received the best education possible at the &quot;Collège Bourbon&quot;. At that time, the law allowed the elder Dumas to take the child away from his mother. Her agony inspired the younger Dumas to write about tragic female characters. In almost all of his writings, he emphasized the moral purpose of literature; in his play (1858) he espoused the belief that if a man fathers an illegitimate child, then he has an obligation to legitimize the child and marry the woman (see Illegitimacy in fiction). At boarding schools, he was constantly taunted by his classmates because of his family situation. These issues profoundly influenced his thoughts, behaviour, and writing.

Dumas&#x27; paternal great-grandparents were Marquis Alexandre-Antoine Davy de la Pailleterie, a Saint Dominican nobleman and &quot;Général commissaire&quot; in the Artillery in the colony of Saint-Domingue—now Haiti—and Marie-Cessette Dumas, an African woman enslaved by the Marquis. Their son Thomas-Alexandre Dumas became a high-ranking general of Revolutionary France.

In 1844, Dumas moved to Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near Paris, to live with his father. There he met Marie Duplessis, a young courtesan who would be the inspiration for the character Marguerite Gauthier in his romantic novel &quot;La Dame aux camélias&quot; (&quot;The Lady of the Camellias&quot;). Adapted into a play, it was titled &quot;Camille&quot; in English and became the basis for Verdi&#x27;s 1853 opera, &quot;La traviata&quot;, Duplessis undergoing yet another name change, this time to Violetta Valéry.

Although he admitted that he had done the adaptation because he needed the money, he had great success with the play, which started his career as a dramatist. He was not only more renowned than his father during his lifetime, but also dominated the serious French stage for most of the second half of the 19th century. After this, he virtually abandoned writing novels, though his semi-autobiographical &quot;Affaire Clémenceau&quot; (1866) achieved some solid success.

On 31 December 1864, in Moscow, Dumas married (1826–April 1895), daughter of Johan Reinhold von Knorring and widow of Alexander Grigorievich Narishkin. The couple had two daughters: (born 20 November 1860), who married Maurice Lippmann and was the mother of Serge Napoléon Lippmann (1886–1975) and Auguste Alexandre Lippmann (1881–1960); and Jeanine Dumas (3 May 1867–1943), who married Ernest Lecourt d&#x27;Hauterive (1864–1957), son of George Lecourt d&#x27;Hauterive and his wife, Léontine de Leusse. After Nadezhda&#x27;s death, Dumas married Henriette Régnier de La Brière (1851–1934) in June 1895, without issue.

In 1874, he was admitted to the Académie française and in 1894 he was awarded the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;.

Dumas died at Marly-le-Roi, Yvelines, on 27 November 1895, and was interred in the Montmartre Cemetery in Paris. His grave is some away from that of Marie Duplessis.

<text>Stalag 17 is a 1953 American war film directed by Billy Wilder. It tells the story of a group of American airmen confined with 40,000 prisoners in a World War II German prisoner-of-war camp &quot;somewhere on the Danube&quot;. Their compound holds 630 sergeants representing many different aircrew positions, but the film focuses on one particular barracks, where the men come to suspect that one of their number is an informant. The film was directed and produced by Billy Wilder, who with Edwin Blum adapted the screenplay from the Broadway play of the same name. The play was written by Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski on the basis of their experiences as prisoners in Stalag 17B in Austria.

The film stars William Holden in an Oscar-winning performance, along with Don Taylor, Robert Strauss, Harvey Lembeck, Peter Graves, Neville Brand, Richard Erdman, Michael Moore, Sig Ruman, and Otto Preminger. Strauss and Lembeck appeared in the original Broadway production.

==Plot==

In a German prisoner-of-war camp named &quot;Stalag 17&quot;, one of its compounds holds 630 American airmen (all of whom are sergeants), and is overseen by camp warden Oberst von Scherbach.

In December 1944, the men of Barracks 4—led by appointed barracks chief &quot;Hoffy&quot; Hoffman, and security officer Frank Price—arrange for the escape of fellow airmen Manfredi and Johnson. The pair are shot dead in the attempt, and the men believe they were betrayed by an informant. Suspicion falls on J. J. Sefton, an enterprising cynic who barters openly with the German guards for various luxuries. He also creates profitable ventures that distract from the mundanity of camp life: from organizing rat races for gambling, to an improvised distillery for brewing alcohol, to a makeshift telescope to spy on the Russian women from a neighboring compound. Clarence &quot;Cookie&quot; Cook, who narrates the story, serves as Sefton&#x27;s naive and loyal aide.

The men of Barracks 4 do their best to keep sane, which includes enduring the antics of barracks clowns &quot;Animal&quot; Kuzawa and Harry Shapiro, and listening for war news on a smuggled radio. Their jovial guard, Feldwebel Schulz, secretly retrieves hidden messages from a hollow black queen on the chessboard, and straightens the looped cord of a dangling light bulb, which serves as a signal between himself and the informant. Just before Christmas, a recently captured Lieutenant Dunbar is assigned to Barracks 4 until he can be sent to an officers camp. Sgt. Bagradian, who accompanies Dunbar, reveals that Dunbar rigged a time bomb in transit and blew up a munitions train. Sefton recognizes Dunbar from officers school, and believes that he only passed because of his rich family, creating tension between them.

Schulz announces that an inspector from the Geneva Convention will arrive, and Sefton bribes the guards to let him spend the day with the Russian women. The radio is later confiscated by Schulz. Concluding that Sefton was rewarded for revealing the radio, the men confront him when he returns, but Sefton denies he was responsible. Von Scherbach interrupts to arrest Dunbar as a saboteur; the men blame Sefton again and brutally beat him.

The next day, the inspector from Geneva arrives with Red Cross parcels—including 2,000 ping-pong balls, which the prisoners use to create smoke bombs. The inspector is then told about Dunbar&#x27;s removal, and he warns von Scherbach that Dunbar cannot be convicted without proof, lest there be war crime trials. Von Scherbach hands Schulz a black queen to be delivered to the informant. During the Christmas Eve celebrations, Price steathily switches out the black queen, reads the hidden message, and then resets the signal. Sefton, recovering from his beating, notices the signal afterwards and becomes suspicious. Price gets Bagradian to reveal the recipe of Dunbar&#x27;s time bomb: a lit cigarette tucked into a matchbook. That night, an air raid siren forces the men to evacuate. Sefton hides and witnesses Price speaking German to Schulz, and demonstrating the time bomb as evidence against Dunbar.

On Christmas Day, the SS arrive to take Dunbar to Berlin. While Hoffy has Price guard Sefton (who is still believed to be the informant), he gathers the men to rescue Dunbar. A riot and an ignited smoke bomb distracts the guards, and Dunbar is taken to hide in a latrine&#x27;s water tower until nightfall. After von Scherbach threatens to raze the camp, the men of Barracks 4 decide that one of them must help Dunbar escape. Price volunteers, and Sefton finally accuses him of being a German spy. Sefton interrogates Price and reveals the messaging system he used; the men are convinced and Price tries to flee, but he is quickly restrained.

Anticipating a generous reward, Sefton decides to rescue Dunbar. He retrieves the Lieutenant, and the prisoners throw Price out of the barracks with cans tied to his leg. Price attracts the spotlights of every guard tower and is gunned down; Sefton and Dunbar escape amidst the chaos. The prisoners return to their bunks, and Cookie whistles &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot;.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Original Broadway production===
The film was adapted by Wilder and Edwin Blum from the Broadway play by Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski, which was based on their experiences as prisoners in Stalag 17B in Austria. Trzcinski appears in the film as a prisoner. The Sefton character was loosely based on Joe Palazzo, a flyer in Trzcinski&#x27;s prisoner-of-war barracks.

The play was produced and directed by José Ferrer. It was first presented at the Edwin Burke Memorial Theater of The Lambs, a theatrical club, on March 11, 1951 (staged by the authors). It began its Broadway run on May 8, 1951, at the 48th Street Theatre and continued for 472 performances, closing on June 21, 1952. Among the notable actors in the cast, John Ericson made his Broadway debut as Sefton, as did Mark Roberts as Dunbar and Allan Melvin as Reed. Robert Strauss, Harvey Lembeck, and William Pierson performed the same roles in the play that they later portrayed in the film.

===Casting===
Both Charlton Heston and Kirk Douglas were considered for the role of Sefton.

===Location===
The prison camp set was built on the John Show Ranch in Woodland Hills, on the southwestern edge of the San Fernando Valley. The shoot began in February 1952, during the rainy season in California, providing plenty of mud for the camp compound. It is now the location of a meetinghouse of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

===Filming and release===
The film was shot in chronological order, an unusual practice because that method is usually much more expensive and time-consuming. In a featurette released later, members of the cast said that they themselves did not know the identity of the informant until the last three days of shooting.

Peter Graves recalled that the film was held back from release for over a year because Paramount Pictures did not believe that anyone would be interested in seeing a film about prisoners of war. The 1953 release of American POWs from the Korean War led Paramount to release it on an exploitation angle.

==Reception==
===Box office===
By January 1954, &quot;Stalag 17&quot; had earned $3.3 million in theatrical rentals in the United States and Canada.

===Critical reaction===
Bosley Crowther praised the film, calling it &quot;cracker-jack movie entertainment&quot;. He praised Wilder and Edwin Blum for having improved the play, and applauded William Holden&#x27;s performance. &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote, &quot;Thanks to the brilliant handling of the subject matter by producer-director Billy Wilder, and to the fine acting of the entire cast, the picture has been fashioned into a first-rate entertainment&quot;. William Brogdon of &quot;Variety&quot; felt &quot;The raucous flavor will set well with male viewers and even the distaffers should find it acceptable entertainment most of the time. William Holden&#x27;s name heads the good cast...although the lengthy two-hour running time makes for a booking awkwardness when it reaches the regular dual-bill situations in the general runs.&quot; Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote Wilder &quot;preserved [the] essential humor and tragedy with no dulling of its corrosive edges, though he has cleaned it up in both language and situations. Lustiness has pretty much replaced bawdiness, and while the fun may not yet be all in the &quot;good clean&quot; class, it is at least expressed in the accepted and more palatable Hollywood medium of hard-boiled comedy.&quot;

In 2006, film critic James Berardinelli stated, &quot;among the 20th-century directors, few were more versatile than Billy Wilder&quot;. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 91% rating based on 74 reviews, with an average rating of 8.40/10. The website&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Stalag 17&quot; survives the jump from stage to screen with flying colors, thanks to Billy Wilder&#x27;s typically sterling direction and a darkly funny script.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 84% based on reviews from 15 critics.

===Accolades===
William Holden won the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. His acceptance speech is one of the shortest on record (&quot;thank you, thank you&quot;); the TV broadcast had a strict cutoff time, which forced Holden&#x27;s quick remarks. The frustrated Holden personally paid for advertisements in the Hollywood trade publications to thank everyone he wanted to on Oscar night. He also remarked that he felt that either Burt Lancaster or Montgomery Clift should have won the Best Actor Oscar for &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; instead of him. He is said to have felt he was given the award as consolation for not having previously won it for &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;.

==In popular culture==
* The television series &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; (CBS, 1965–71) is based on a similar &quot;Stalag&quot;. Richard Erdman, who played Hoffy in &quot;Stalag 17&quot;, guest-starred on &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; as Walter Hobson, a reporter, who with Hogan&#x27;s crew, is freed in the episode &quot;No Names Please&quot;. Erdman is the only star of the movie to have guest-starred on &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;.
* &quot;Stalag 17&quot; is a 1973 reggae riddim, composed by Ansell Collins and named after the film.
*Jay Lawrence, who played amateur impressionist Sgt. Bagradian, reprised his Clark Gable impression when he played Gable as Rhett Butler in the 1975 pop musical &quot;Train Ride to Hollywood,&quot; starring the R&amp;B band Bloodstone. He used the exact same line - &quot;I gave you kisses for breakfast, kisses for lunch, and kisses for supper . . . and now I find that you&#x27;re eating out&quot; - in the Bloodstone movie. 
* The film is parodied in the &quot;Ripping Yarns&quot; episode &quot;Escape from Stalag Luft 112B&quot; (1977).
* An uncredited William Holden reprised the character of a cigar-chewing POW in the 1979 war movie &quot;Escape to Athena&quot;. Since he is seen only briefly, &quot;Sefton&quot; presumably made another successful escape while no one was looking.
* The episode &quot;Did You See The Sunrise?&quot; (1982), of the television series &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, opens with &quot;Stalag 17&quot; playing on the TV, as the main character, Thomas Magnum, is watching and remembering his childhood, and the enjoyment he had with the movie, only to grow up and experience his own wartime imprisonment.
* In a 1995, season-three &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; episode entitled &quot;Torah! Torah! Torah!&quot;, &quot;Stalag 17&quot; was mentioned.
* In the 2008–2015 television series &quot;The Penguins of Madagascar&quot;, two penguins named Manfredi and Johnson are referenced throughout the show, typically for the nature of their demise or a mistake they made. They actually appear alive in &quot;The Penguin who Loved Me&quot;.

<text>Die Another Day is a 2002 spy film and the twentieth film in the &quot;James Bond&quot; series produced by Eon Productions. It was directed by Lee Tamahori, produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, and written by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. The fourth and final film starring Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond, it was also the only film to feature John Cleese as Q, and the last with Samantha Bond as Miss Moneypenny. It is also the first film since &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973) not to feature Desmond Llewelyn as Q as he died three years earlier. Halle Berry co-stars as Bond girl and NSA agent Jinx. In the film, Bond attempts to locate a traitor in British intelligence who betrayed him and a British billionaire who is later revealed to be connected to a North Korean operative who Bond seemingly killed. It is an original story, although it takes influence from Bond creator Ian Fleming&#x27;s novels &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1955) and &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; (1965), as well as Kingsley Amis&#x27;s novel, &quot;Colonel Sun&quot;. The title song was performed by Madonna.

&quot;Die Another Day&quot; released on 20 November 2002 internationally by 20th Century Fox and 22 November 2002 in the United States by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. It marked the &quot;James Bond&quot; franchise&#x27;s 40th anniversary. The film includes references to each of the preceding films. It received mixed reviews; some critics praised Tamahori&#x27;s direction, but others criticised the reliance on CGI, product placement, the story and the villain. Nevertheless, the film was a box-office success with it grossing $432 million worldwide, becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2002. The next film in the series, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, was released in 2006, which also served as a reboot of the franchise with Daniel Craig playing Bond.

==Plot==

MI6 agent James Bond infiltrates a North Korean military base where Colonel Tan-Sun Moon is trading weapons for African conflict diamonds. After Moon&#x27;s right-hand man Zao receives notification of Bond&#x27;s real identity, Moon attempts to kill Bond and a hovercraft chase ensues, ending with Moon&#x27;s craft tumbling over a waterfall. Bond is captured by North Korean soldiers and imprisoned by the Colonel&#x27;s father, General Moon. After fourteen months of captivity and torture at the hands of the Korean People&#x27;s Army, Bond is traded for Zao in a prisoner exchange across the Bridge of No Return. He is sedated and taken to meet M, who informs him that his status as a 00 Agent has been suspended under suspicion of having leaked information under duress to the North Koreans. Bond is convinced that he has been set up by a double agent in the British government. After escaping MI6 custody, he finds himself in Hong Kong, where he learns from Chang, a Chinese agent and old colleague, that Zao is in Cuba.

In Havana, Bond meets with NSA agent Giacinta &quot;Jinx&quot; Johnson and follows her to a gene therapy clinic, where patients can have their appearances altered through DNA restructuring. Jinx kills Dr. Alvarez, the leader of the therapy, while Bond locates Zao inside the clinic and fights him. Zao escapes, leaving behind a pendant which leads Bond to a cache of conflict diamonds bearing the crest of the company owned by British billionaire Gustav Graves. Bond learns that Graves only appeared a year prior, apparently discovering a vein of diamonds in Iceland leading to his current wealth and celebrity. At Blades Club in London, Bond meets Graves along with his assistant Miranda Frost, who is also an undercover MI6 agent. After a fencing match that escalates into a claymore duel, Graves invites Bond to Iceland for a scientific demonstration. M restores Bond&#x27;s Double-0 status, and Q issues him an Aston Martin V12 Vanquish with active camouflage.
At his ice palace in Iceland, Graves unveils a new orbital mirror satellite Icarus, which is able to focus solar energy on a small area and provide year-round sunshine for agriculture. Frost seduces Bond and Jinx infiltrates Graves&#x27; command centre but is captured by Graves and Zao. Bond rescues her and discovers that Graves is Colonel Moon, who has used the gene therapy technology to change his appearance and amassed his fortune from conflict diamonds as a cover. Bond confronts Graves, but Frost arrives to reveal herself as the traitor who betrayed him in North Korea, forcing Bond to escape from Graves&#x27; facility. He returns in his Vanquish to rescue Jinx, who has been recaptured in the palace. As Graves uses Icarus to melt the ice palace, Zao pursues Bond into the palace using his Jaguar XKR. Bond kills Zao by causing an ice chandelier to fall onto him and revives Jinx after she has almost drowned.

Bond and Jinx pursue Graves and Frost to the Korean peninsula and stow away on Graves&#x27; An-124 cargo plane. Graves reveals his identity to his father, and the true purpose of the Icarus satellite: to cut a path through the Korean Demilitarised Zone with concentrated sunlight, allowing North Korean troops to invade South Korea and unite the peninsula. Horrified, General Moon rejects the plan, but Graves murders him. Bond attempts to shoot Graves, but is prevented by a soldier. In their struggle, a gunshot pierces the fuselage, causing the plane to decompress and descend rapidly. Bond and Graves engage in a fistfight, and Jinx attempts to regain control of the plane. Frost attacks Jinx, forcing her to defend herself in a sword duel. After the plane passes through the Icarus beam and is further damaged, Jinx kills Frost. Graves attempts to escape by parachute, but Bond opens the parachute, pulling Graves out of the plane and into one of its engines, disabling the Icarus beam. Bond and Jinx escape from the disintegrating plane in a helicopter from the cargo hold, with Graves&#x27; stash of diamonds. Later, they spend a romantic evening at a Buddhist temple.

==Production==
After the success of &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson asked the director Michael Apted to return to direct. Although Apted accepted, they rescinded the offer in order to ask Tony Scott and John Woo, who both declined. Scott claims to have suggested Quentin Tarantino as director, although Wilson denies that any formal negotiations were held with him. Pierce Brosnan suggested John McTiernan, Ang Lee and Martin Scorsese as potential choices, and informally discussed the idea of directing a Bond film with Scorsese on a flight. Brett Ratner, Stephen Hopkins and Stuart Baird were later in negotiations to direct, before Lee Tamahori was hired.

Tamahori confirmed to &quot;Total Film&quot; in 2002, having pitched a scene where Brosnan&#x27;s 007 meets an older, former 007 in Scotland played by Sean Connery but was advised it was &quot;too dangerous&quot; to have two 007s in one movie.

===Filming===

Principal photography of &quot;Die Another Day&quot; began on 11 January 2002 at Pinewood Studios. The film was shot primarily in the United Kingdom, Iceland and Cádiz, Spain. Other locations included Pinewood Studios&#x27; 007 Stage and Maui, Hawaii, in December 2001.
Laird Hamilton, Dave Kalama and Darrick Doerner performed the pre-title surfing scene at the surf break known as &quot;Jaws&quot; in Peahi, Maui, while the shore shots were taken near Cádiz and Newquay, Cornwall. Scenes inside Graves&#x27; diamond mine were also filmed in Cornwall, at the Eden Project. The scenes involving the Cuban locations of Havana and the fictional Isla de Los Organos were filmed at La Caleta, Spain.

The scenes featuring Berry in a bikini (designed to resemble Ursula Andress&#x27; swimming costume in &quot;Dr. No&quot;) were shot in Cádiz. The location was cold and windy, and footage has been released of Berry wrapped in thick towels between takes to avoid catching a chill. Berry was injured during filming when debris from a smoke grenade flew into her eye. The debris was removed in a 30-minute operation. Brosnan also sustained a knee injury during the shooting of an action scene in Cornwall.

Gadgets and other props from every previous &quot;Bond&quot; film and stored in Eon Productions&#x27; archives appear in Q&#x27;s warehouse in the London Underground. Examples include the jetpack in &quot;Thunderball&quot; and Rosa Klebb&#x27;s poison-tipped shoe in &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;. Q mentions that the watch he issues Bond is &quot;your 20th, I believe&quot;, a reference to &quot;Die Another Day&quot; being the 20th Eon-produced Bond film. In London, the Reform Club was used to shoot several places in the film, including the lobby and gallery at the Blades Club, MI6 Headquarters, Buckingham Palace, Green Park and Westminster. Jökulsárlón, Iceland was used for the car chase on the ice. Four Aston Martins and four Jaguars, all converted to four-wheel drive, were used (and wrecked) filming the sequence. A temporary dam was constructed at the mouth of the narrow inlet to keep the salty ocean water out and allow the lagoon to freeze. Additional chase footage was filmed at Svalbard, Norway, Jostedalsbreen National Park, Norway, and RAF Little Rissington, Gloucestershire. Manston Airport in Kent was used for the scenes involving the Antonov cargo plane scenes. The scene in which Bond surfs the wave created by Icarus when Graves was attempting to kill Bond was shot on the blue screen. The waves, along with all the glaciers in the scene, are computer-generated.

The hangar interior of the US Air Base in South Korea, shown crowded with Chinook helicopters, was filmed at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, UK, as were the helicopter interior shots during the Switchblade sequence. These latter scenes, though portrayed in the air, were actually filmed entirely on the ground with the sky background being added in post-production using blue screen techniques. Although the base is portrayed in the film as a US base, all the aircraft and personnel in the scene are British in real life. In the film, Switchblades (one-person gliders resembling fighter jets in shape) are flown by Bond and Jinx to stealthily enter North Korea. The Switchblade was based on a workable model called &quot;PHASST&quot; (Programmable High Altitude Single Soldier Transport). Kinetic Aerospace Inc.&#x27;s lead designer, Jack McCornack was impressed by director Lee Tamahori&#x27;s way of conducting the Switchblade scene and commented: &quot;It&#x27;s brief, but realistic. The good guys get in unobserved, thanks to a fast cruise, good glide performance, and minimal radar signature. It&#x27;s a wonderful promotion for the PHASST.&quot;

The satellite attack at the end of the film was at first written to take place in Manhattan, but after the September 11 attacks, it was moved to the Korean Demilitarized Zone.

===Music===

The soundtrack was composed by David Arnold and released on Warner Bros. Records. He again made use of electronic rhythm elements in his score, and included two of the new themes created for &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;. The first, originally used as Renard&#x27;s theme, is heard during the mammoth &quot;Antonov&quot; cue on the recording, and is written for piano. The second new theme, used in the &quot;Christmas in Turkey&quot; track of &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, is reused in the &quot;Going Down Together&quot; track.

The title song for &quot;Die Another Day&quot; was co-written and co-produced by Mirwais Ahmadzai and performed by Madonna, who also had a cameo in the film as Verity, a fencing instructor. The concept of the title sequence is to represent Bond trying to survive 14 months of torture at the hands of the North Koreans. Critics&#x27; opinions of the song were sharply divided; it was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Song and the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording, but also for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song of 2002 (while Madonna herself won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress for her cameo). In a MORI poll for the Channel 4 programme &quot;James Bond&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, the song was voted 9th out of 22, and also came in as an &quot;overwhelming number one&quot; favourite among those under the age of 24.

==Marketing==
Reportedly, twenty companies paying $70 million had their products featured in the film, a record at the time, although &quot;USA Today&quot; reported that number to be as high as $100 million.

The eleventh-generation Ford Thunderbird was featured in the film as Jinx&#x27;s car, with a coral colour paying homage to a paint option for the original model, and matching her bikini. Ford produced a limited-edition &quot;007&quot;-branded 2003 Thunderbird as a tie-in for the film, featuring a similar paint job.

Revlon produced &quot;&quot;007&quot; Colour Collection&quot; makeup inspired by Jinx. Bond Barbie dolls inspired by the franchise were also produced, featuring a red shawl and an evening dress designed by Lindy Hemming, and sold in a gift set with Ken posing as Bond in formal wear designed by the Italian fashion house Brioni.

==Release==
&quot;Die Another Day&quot; had its world premiere on 18 November 2002 at the 56th Royal Film Performance, a fundraising event held in aid of The Film and TV Charity. The event took place at the Royal Albert Hall in London and Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were guests of honour. The Royal Albert Hall had a makeover for the screening and had been transformed into an ice palace. Proceeds from the premiere, about £500,000, were donated to The Film and Television Charity, of which the Queen was patron.

&quot;Die Another Day&quot; was controversial in the Korean Peninsula. The North Korean government disliked the portrayal of their state as brutal and war-hungry. The South Koreans boycotted 145 theatres where it was released on 31 December 2002, as they were offended by the scene in which an American officer issues orders to the South Korean army in the defence of their homeland, and by a lovemaking scene near a statue of the Buddha. The Jogye Buddhist Order issued a statement that the film was &quot;disrespectful to our religion and does not reflect our values and ethics&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported growing resentment in the nation towards the United States. An official of the South Korean Ministry of Culture and Tourism said that &quot;Die Another Day&quot; was &quot;the wrong film at the wrong time.&quot;

===Home media===
&quot;Die Another Day&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on 3 June 2003. It was released on Blu-ray on 21 October 2008. It was released digital in 4K on 15 September 2015.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
On the first day of release, ticket sales reached £1.2 million at the UK box office. &quot;Die Another Day&quot; grossed $47 million on its opening weekend in the US and Canada and was ranked number one at the box office. The film competed against &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; and &quot;The Santa Clause 2&quot; during the Thanksgiving weekend. Moreover, all three films were able to defeat the underperforming animated film &quot;Treasure Planet&quot;. Later on, &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; and &quot;Die Another Day&quot; would simultaneously reclaim the number one spot at the box office. For six months, they were both the latest films to return to the top spot at the box office, until &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; joined the group in June 2003. The film earned $160.9 million in the US and Canada, and $432 million worldwide, becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2002. Not adjusting for inflation, &quot;Die Another Day&quot; was the highest-grossing &quot;James Bond&quot; film until the release of the next &quot;James Bond&quot; movie, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, in 2006.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 56% based on 220 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Its action may be a bit too over-the-top for some, but &quot;Die Another Day&quot; is lavishly crafted and succeeds in evoking classic Bond themes from the franchise&#x27;s earlier installments.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100 based on 43 critics, indicating &quot;mixed and average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;A−&quot; on scale of A to F.

Michael Dequina of &quot;Film Threat&quot; praised the film as the best of the series to star Pierce Brosnan and &quot;the most satisfying installment of the franchise in recent memory.&quot; Larry Carroll of CountingDown.com praised Lee Tamahori for having &quot;magnificently balanced the film so that it keeps true to the Bond legend, makes reference to the classic films that preceded it, but also injects a new zest to it all.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazine also gave a positive reaction, saying that Tamahori, &quot;a true filmmaker&quot;, has re-established the series&#x27; pop sensuality. A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film the best of the &quot;James Bond&quot; series since &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, who gave the film three stars out of four, stated: &quot;This movie has the usual impossible stunts ... But it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie&quot;. Kyle Bell of Movie Freaks 365 stated in his review that the &quot;first half of &quot;Die Another Day&quot; is classic Bond&quot;, but that &quot;things start to go downhill when the ice palace gets introduced.&quot;

Several reviewers felt the film relied too heavily on gadgets and special effects, with the plot being neglected. James Berardinelli of &quot;ReelViews&quot; said: &quot;This is a train wreck of an action film—a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed James Bond into the mindless &quot;XXX&quot; mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs.&quot; Of the action sequences, he said: &quot;&quot;Die Another Day&quot; is an exercise in loud explosions and excruciatingly bad special effects. The CGI work in this movie is an order of magnitude worse than anything I have seen in a major motion picture. Coupled with lousy production design, &quot;Die Another Day&quot; looks like it was done on the cheap.&quot; Gary Brown of the &quot;Houston Community Newspapers&quot; also described the weak point of the film as &quot;the seemingly non-stop action sequences and loud explosions that appear to take centre stage while the Bond character is almost relegated to second string.&quot; Roger Moore, who played Bond in earlier films, said: &quot;I thought it just went too far—and that&#x27;s from me, the first Bond in space! Invisible cars and dodgy CGI footage? Please!&quot;

The amount of product placement in &quot;Die Another Day&quot; had been a contemporaneous point of criticism, with the BBC, &quot;Time&quot; and Reuters referring mockingly to the film using the title &quot;Buy Another Day&quot;. The producers subsequently chose to limit the number of companies involved in product placement to eight for the next Bond film, &quot;Casino Royale,&quot; in 2006.

=== Retrospective ===
Despite favour from fans who prefer Bond&#x27;s more &quot;camp&quot; films, a comment piece in 2020 stated that it is &quot;considered by many to be the worst entry in James Bond&#x27;s canon&quot; and compares unfavourably to &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; (released months earlier), which &quot;ushered in a new era of violent, gritty action-espionage movies&quot; and gave rise to the &quot;stripped-down, no-nonsense&quot; Bond of Daniel Craig.
It often occupies a low rank on Bond-related lists, and the title song has also received mixed reactions. In a 2021 Yahoo! survey consisting of 2200 experts and superfans, &quot;Die Another Day&quot; was ranked as the third-worst installment after &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; and &quot;Spectre&quot;. The authors of the study did, however, specify that &quot;every Bond film...is always someone&#x27;s favourite&quot;. 

==Media==
&quot;Die Another Day&quot; was novelised by the then-official James Bond writer, Raymond Benson, based on the screenplay by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. An effort is made to depict some of the film&#x27;s more outlandish elements with more believability, in the style of Fleming&#x27;s original novels&#x27; use of cutting-edge technology. So, for example, the non-bodywork elements of the Aston Martin with its &#x27;cloaking&#x27; function (the glass windows and rubber tyres) are described as having retractable covers to achieve the invisibility effect. Fan reaction to it was above average. After its publication, Benson retired as the official James Bond novelist; a new series featuring the secret agent&#x27;s adventures as a teenager, by Charlie Higson, was launched in 2005.

&quot;007 Legends&quot;, released in 2012, features Daniel Craig&#x27;s James Bond in a &quot;Die Another Day&quot; level.

==Cancelled spin-off==
Speculation arose in 2003 of a spin-off film concentrating on Jinx, which was scheduled for a November/December 2004 release. It was originally reported that MGM was keen to set up a film series that would be a &quot;Winter Olympics&quot; alternative to the main series. In the late 1990s, MGM had originally considered developing a spin-off film based on Michelle Yeoh&#x27;s character, Wai Lin, in 1997&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;. The spin-off &quot;Jinx&quot; was announced in December 2002. Lee Tamahori initially wanted to direct, but Stephen Frears was ultimately hired. Berry and Michael Madsen were originally going to reprise their roles as Jinx and Falco, while Jinx&#x27;s lover was going to be played by Javier Bardem. Bardem would later play villain Raoul Silva in &quot;Skyfall&quot; (2012). The film would have revolved around Jinx&#x27;s entry into the NSA, revealing that she had been adopted by Falco after being orphaned in a bombing and being hired by him from the RAND Corporation to do a job at the NSA as a favour. Wade described the film as &quot;a very atmospheric, Euro thriller, a Bourne-type movie.&quot; However, despite much speculation of an imminent movie, on 26 October 2003, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that MGM had cancelled the project. MGM instead decided to reboot the James Bond franchise with the next film, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, with Daniel Craig portraying the role of the titular character. In 2020, Berry revealed that the film was cancelled over its $80 million budget, saying: &quot;Nobody was ready to sink that kind of money into a black female action star.&quot; Purvis and Wade said that this decision was influenced by the failure of several action films with female stars, including &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot; and &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life&quot;, in 2003.

<text>A district is a type of administrative division that in some countries is managed by the local government. Across the world, areas known as &quot;districts&quot; vary greatly in size, spanning regions or counties, several municipalities, subdivisions of municipalities, school district, or political district.

== By country or territory ==
===Afghanistan===
In Afghanistan, a district (Persian ) is a subdivision of a province. There are almost 400 districts in the country.
===Australia===
Electoral districts are used in state elections. Districts were also used in several states as cadastral units for land titles. Some were used as squatting districts. New South Wales had several different types of districts used in the 21st century.

===Austria===
In Austria, the word is used with different meanings in three different contexts:

* Some of the tasks of the administrative branch of the national and regional governments are fulfilled by the 95 district administrative offices (). The area a district administrative office is responsible for is often, although informally, called a district (). A number of statutory cities, currently 15, are not served by any district administrative office. Their respective municipal bureaucracies handle the tasks normally performed by the district administrative office.
* The cities of Vienna and Graz are divided into municipal districts (), assisting the respective municipal governments. In Vienna, the constituents of each district elect a district council (); the district council in turn elects a district chairperson (). Although the city vests its districts with a limited amount of budgetary autonomy, district councils and chairpersons have little real responsibility. In particular, they do not legislate. Most of the districts of Vienna were independent municipalities at some point; district councils and chairpersons symbolize the town councils and mayors they used to have.
* From the point of view of the judiciary of Austria, the country is subdivided into 115 judicial districts (), each corresponding to one of the country&#x27;s 115 lowest-level trial courts.

===Azerbaijan===
Azerbaijan is administratively divided into the following subdivisions:

*59 districts (; sing.– ),
*11 cities (; sing.– ),
*1 autonomous republic (), which itself contains:
**7 districts
**1 city

The rayons are further divided into municipalities ().

Additionally, Azerbaijan is subdivided into 9 (economic) regions (; sing.– ). This is not an administrative division. Each region contains a number of districts. The Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic forms a separate, 10th economic region.

1. Absheron
2. Ganja-Qazakh
3. Shaki-Zaqatala
4. Lankaran
5. Quba-Khachmaz 
6. Aran
7. Upper Karabakh
8. Kalbajar-Lachin
9. Daglig-Shirvan
10. Nakhchivan

===Bangladesh===
Bangladeshi districts are local administrative units. In all, there are 64 districts in Bangladesh. Originally, there were 21 greater districts with several subdivisions in each district. In 1984, the government made all these subdivisions into districts. Each district has several sub-districts called Upazila in Bengali with a total 493 Upzillas.

===Belgium===
In Belgian municipalities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, on the initiative of the local council, sub-municipal administrative entities with elected councils may be created. As such, only Antwerp, having over 460,000 inhabitants, became subdivided into nine districts ().

The Belgian arrondissements (also in French as well as in Dutch), an administrative level between province (or the capital region) and municipality, or the lowest judicial level, are in English, sometimes called districts as well.

===Bhutan===
Bhutanese districts () are local administrative units consisting of village blocks called . Some have subdistricts called .

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, a district is a self-governing administrative unit.

====Brčko District====
Brčko District in northeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina is formally part of both the Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Assembly of the Brčko District has 29 seats.

=== Botswana ===

Districts are the first-level administrative divisions of Botswana, alongside town councils and city councils. Each of the ten districts have their own district councils.

===Brazil===
Brazilian municipalities are subdivided into districts. Small municipalities usually have only one urban district, which contains the city itself, consisting of the seat of the local government, where the municipality&#x27;s and (City Hall and City Council, respectively, the Executive and Legislative local bodies) are located. The rural districts and groups of urban districts (mainly in large cities) may also present a sub local Executive body, named .

===Brunei===
A district is known locally as and it is the first-level administrative division of Brunei. There are four districts in the country, namely Brunei-Muara, Tutong, Belait and Temburong. Each district is administered by a (District Office), which is headed by a (District Officer). All district offices are government departments under the Ministry of Home Affairs ().

===Canada===
====Alberta====
In Alberta, the municipal districts and improvement districts are types of rural municipalities. They are recognized as census subdivisions by Statistics Canada, which form parts of census divisions.

====British Columbia====
In the province of British Columbia, there are several kinds of administrative districts by that name. The usual usage is a reference to &quot;district municipalities&quot;, which are a class of municipality in the same hierarchy as city, town, or village. Most are styled, e.g., &quot;District of Mission&quot; or &quot;District of Wells&quot;, though some are styled, e.g., &quot;Corporation of Delta&quot; or &quot;Township of Langley&quot;.

Within the area of municipal powers, &quot;regional districts&quot; – which are somewhat analogous to counties in other jurisdictions, a number of municipalities, and unincorporated areas – are always referred to as &quot;regional districts&quot; to distinguish them from district municipalities and other kinds of district.

Other kinds of districts in British Columbia are:

* Electoral districts (some early ridings, as electoral districts are commonly known, included &quot;district&quot; in their title, e.g. New Westminster District)
* Forest districts, which are a set of administrative regions of the British Columbia Ministry of Forests
* Land districts, which are the underlying cadastral survey system for the province and are the primary locational reference used in government databases and references. The primary use of &quot;district&quot; in combinations such as the Lillooet District or New Westminster District was a reference to the land district, though sometimes to mining divisions.
* School districts, also often referred to simply as &quot;districts&quot;, when in context.
* Other types of regional subdivision, according to the ministry or agency, are generally styled &quot;region&quot; or &quot;area&quot;. These include as Ministry of Environment regions, health regions, and regional management planning areas such as the Muskwa-Kechika Management Planning Area.

====Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki====
Situated across the Atlantic provinces and the Maritimes provinces, the traditional country of the Mi&#x27;kmaw Nation organizes itself into historically 7 or 8 districts. These districts are Epekwitk and Piktuk, Eske&#x27;kewa&#x27;ki, Kespe&#x27;kewa&#x27;ki, Kespukwitk, Sikniktewa&#x27;ki, their central fire or capital district Unama&#x27;ki, and Ktaqamkuk. Although Canada and the provinces hardly recognize the legitimacy of Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki, the nation remains and still retains functions as a Wabanaki country.

====New Brunswick====
New Brunswick has numerous local service districts, 7 school districts, 10 federal electoral districts and 55 provincial electoral districts.

====Northwest Territories====
In western and northern Canada, the federal government created districts as subdivisions of the Northwest Territories 1870–1905, partly on the model of the districts created in the Province of Canada. The first district created was the District of Keewatin in 1876 followed by four more districts in 1882. Gradually, these districts became separate territories (such as Yukon), separate provinces (such as Alberta and Saskatchewan) or were absorbed into other provinces.

====Ontario====
In Ontario, a district is a statutory subdivision of the province, but, unlike a county, a district is not incorporated. Most districts are composed of unincorporated lands, mostly Crown land. Originally present-day Southern Ontario (then part of the Province of Quebec and after 1791, Upper Canada) was divided into districts in 1788 . Districts continued to operation until 1849 when they were replaced by counties by the Province of Canada.

The current Ontario districts such as Algoma and Nipissing were first created by the Province of Canada in 1858 prior to Confederation for the delivery of judicial and provincial government services to sparsely populated areas from the district seat (e.g. Sault Ste. Marie). Some districts may have District Social Service Administration Boards, which are designed to provide certain social services. The boundaries of a federal census division may correspond to those of a district.

====Quebec====
In Quebec, districts are municipal electoral subdivisions of boroughs, which are subdivisions of cities. They function in a similar manner to what is elsewhere known as a ward.

===Chile===
===China===
==== Hong Kong ====
Hong Kong is divided into eighteen districts, each with a district council.

==== Macao ====

==== Mainland China ====
On Mainland China, the district () is a subdivision of any of various city administrative units, including direct-administered municipalities, sub-provincial municipalities, and prefecture-level cities. Districts have county-level status.

Modern districts are a recent innovation. In the context of pre-modern China, the English translation &quot;district&quot; is typically associated with (), another Chinese administrative division. The is translated as &quot;county&quot; in the context of modern China.

===Colombia===
In Colombia, a district is one of ten special administrative units:

===Czechia===
A &quot;district&quot; in Czechia is an (plural ). After a reform in 2002, the districts lost administrative power to regions () and selected towns () and became statistical zones.

===France===
French districts were the first subdivision of the from the 4 March 1790 to the (17 February 1800). Then, in the 20th century, districts were a type of intercommunity, they&#x27;ve been replaced by and after 1999.

===Germany===
* In Germany, a district () is an administrative unit between the (German federal states) and the local / municipal levels (Gemeinden). As of 2011, most of the 402 German districts are , rural districts. 107 larger cities (usually with more than 100,000 inhabitants) that do not belong to a district are considered as urban districts ( or ).
** A local subdistrict is called a , and is mostly a smaller rural area (with similar concepts in Austria and Switzerland). A is usually associated with and named after a central town or village. Areas in such subdistricts and their usage are documented in central registries (German: ) and have been historically used for taxation.
* In some states, there is additional level of administration between the and the called (&quot;government district&quot;).
* District () was also an administrative subdivision of the German Democratic Republic from 1952. &quot;See Administrative division of the German Democratic Republic&quot;
* City district ( or ) is the primary subdivision category of many .

===Hungary===
175 districts were established on January 1, 2013. The existing 19 counties are subdivided into 6–18 districts per county. The capital city of Budapest does not belong to any counties and is already divided to 23 districts.

===India===


India&#x27;s districts are local administrative units inherited from the British Raj. They generally form the tier of local government immediately below that of India&#x27;s subnational states and territories. Where warranted, districts may further be grouped into administrative divisions, which form an intermediate level between the district and the subnational state (or union territory).

A district is headed by a Deputy Commissioner/ Collector, who is responsible for the overall administration and the maintenance of law and order. The district collector may belong to IAS (Indian Administrative Service). Other key responsibilities include the collection of revenue, land management, co-ordination and disaster management. Usually, the Deputy Commissioner/District Collector is granted magisterial powers under section 20 of Criminal Procedure Code, and designated as the District Magistrate. The official designations are &quot;Collector and District Magistrate&quot; or &quot;Deputy Commissioner and District Magistrate&quot;.

Districts are most frequently further sub-divided into smaller administrative units, called either or or , depending on the region. These units have specific local responsibilities, including in particular coordinating revenue collection.
An intermediate level (the sub-division) between district and tehsil/taluka may be formed by grouping these units under the oversight of Assistant Commissioners, Sub-collectors or Sub-divisional magistrate. Each district includes one or two cities (or large towns), a few smaller towns and dozens of villages. Most of the Indian districts have the same name as their main town or city.

As of April 2016, the National Informatics Centre of the Government of India, lists a total of 664 districts in India, more than the number of parliamentary constituencies (545). This number went up to a total of 723 districts in 2019.

===Indonesia===
In Western New Guinea, one of the seven regions of Indonesia, a is a subdivision of a regency or a city. Formerly it was called a . In translations of most official documents, itself is translated into English as &quot;district&quot;, but some other documents (especially from older era) translated it to &quot;subdistrict&quot;, which is equivalent to a in recent translations. This translation ambiguity has caused confusions among foreigners. or do not have legal autonomy to govern themselves, because they are only administrative extensions of a regency or a city.

===Iran===
Iran is subdivided into thirty one provinces (Persian: ), each governed from a local center, usually the largest local city, which is called the capital (Persian: ) of that province. The provinces of Iran further subdivided into counties called ( ), an area inside an , and consists of a city center, few () and many villages around them. There are usually a few cities ( ) and rural agglomerations ( ) in each county. Rural agglomerations are a collection of a number of villages. One of the cities of the county is appointed as the capital of the county. The word comes from the Persian words and , which mean &quot;city&quot; (or &quot;town&quot;) and &quot;province&quot;, respectively. The nearest equivalent of in English would be sub-province or county. Each has a governmental office known as which coordinates different events and governmental offices. The , or the head of , is the governor of the which is the highest governmental authority in the division.

===Iraq===
In Iraq, they use the word for districts. There are over a hundred districts, each district being within one of 18 Iraqi governorates, sometimes known as provinces. The district generally (but not always) bears the name of a city within that district, usually the capital of that district.

===Japan===
A is a local administrative unit comprising towns and villages but not cities. See districts of Japan for a more complete description. In 1923, its administrative role was abolished although it is still in use for addressing purposes. &quot;District&quot; is also a translation of , defined by Japan&#x27;s planning law.

===Kenya===
In Kenya, a district () is a subdivision of a Province and is headed by a District Officer (DO).

===Malawi===
Malawi is divided into 28 districts within three regions. Each district is headed by a District Commissioner.

===Malaysia===
A district is known as in Malay. A district governed directly by the federal government is known as a Federal Territory, and they are Kuala Lumpur, Labuan, and Putrajaya.

In East Malaysia, a district is a subdivision within a division of a state. For example, Tuaran is a district within the West Coast Division of Sabah. A district is usually named after the main town or its administrative capital, for example, Sandakan town is the capital of the district of Sandakan, as well the capital of Sandakan Division (note: Sandakan district is a sub-division of Sandakan Division).

In Peninsular Malaysia, a district is a division of a state. A is a subdivision of a district. The , is however, of less importance with respect to the administration of local government.

In Malaysia, each district will have a District Office, headed by a district officer, and is administered by a local government either being a District Council, Municipal Council, or a City Council. In some highly urbanized districts, there may be further subdivisions. For example, the district of Petaling in Selangor is administered by 3 local governments: Shah Alam City Council, Petaling Jaya City Council, and Subang Jaya Municipal Council. Another example is the district of Johor Bahru in Johor, which has 3 subdivisions: Johor Bahru City Council, Iskandar Puteri City Council, and Pasir Gudang Municipal Council. Conversely, there may be one local government administering more than one district, for example, Seberang Perai Municipal Council administers the districts of Central Seberang Perai, North Seberang Perai, and South Seberang Perai; as well as Kuala Terengganu City Council, which administers the districts of Kuala Terengganu and Kuala Nerus.

An administrative district border and an electoral district border (constituency) transcend each other and do not correspond with each other in most instances.

===Malta===
Malta holds 13 Electoral Divisions for the unicameral (single-assembly) parliament. Each consists of a number of localities (although there is no requirement that electoral boundaries follow the boundaries of localities).

===Mauritius===
The districts of the Republic of Mauritius are the second-order administrative divisions after the Outer islands of the country. Mauritius is divided into nine districts which consist of 2 cities, 4 towns and 130 villages, the capital is Port Louis.

The island of Rodrigues used to be the tenth district of Mauritius but it gained autonomous status in 2002.

===Myanmar===
===Nauru===
The districts of Nauru are the only subdivisions of the whole state.

===Nepal===
Nepal is divided into 77 districts. Each district acts as an independent administrative unit. A district consists of two types of units like Rural Municipalities and Municipalities. Official documents like citizenship cards and passports are issued by the Chief of District Office (CDO). Constituencies for elections are also constructed according to the population distribution within the district.

===New Zealand===
A district in New Zealand is a territorial authority (second-tier local government unit) that has not gained the distinction of being proclaimed a city. Districts tend to be less urbanized, tend to cover more than one population center and a larger amount of rural area, and tend to have a smaller population than cities. While cities and districts are generally considered to be two different types of territorial authority, the area covered by a city is often known as its district—for example the term &quot;district plan&quot; is used equally in districts and cities. The Chatham Islands Territory is neither a district nor a city.

A district is not always a simple division of a region: several districts lie within two regions, and the Taupo District lies in four.

===Northern Cyprus===
===Norway===
===Pakistan===
Districts of Pakistan are local administrative units inherited from the British Raj. They form third-level Administrative Division in Pakistan after Provinces and Divisions. Districts were generally grouped into administrative divisions, which in turn formed provinces. Pakistan has 160 districts (including ten in Azad Jammu and Kashmir). They are known as in Urdu. They comprise villages, towns, and cities. A district is headed by a district (mayor), who is an elected official (in local body elections) and the local controller of the district level officers of all the departments under provincial government, while Deputy Commissioner is the executive head of the District usually Grade-18 officer from Pakistan Administrative Service. Deputy Commissioner is entrusted with overall responsibility of law &amp; order, implementation of government schemes and is also authorized to hear revenue cases pertaining to the district. The district mayor () heads an elected district council composed of councilors, who represent various district-level constituencies. The councils have a constitutional requirement to be composed of a minimum of 33% women or more than that.

===Peru===
===Philippines===
The usage of the term &#x27;district&#x27; () in the Philippines has similarities to that in the United States.

====Legislative====
=====National=====
A constituency with a representative in the lower house of Congress is a congressional district. However, the term congressional district has become synonymous in local parlance with &#x27;representative district,&#x27; because, just like in the US, the word &#x27;congress&#x27; () has come to refer specifically to the lower house (the House of Representatives).

A legislative district, which has an average population of about 250,000 to 500,000, may be composed of:

(a.) an entire province,
(b.) within a province, a group of municipalities and cities (sometimes even including independent and highly urbanized cities geographically located in the province),
(c.) a single city,
(d.) a group of geographically adjacent independent cities and independent municipalities (currently the only example is the Pateros-Taguig, or
(e.) a group of barangays within a city.

Each province is guaranteed at least one representative to the lower house, even though it may not come close to having the same population as other legislative districts. Only voters within each district are allowed to vote in the election for the member of the House of Representatives from that district.

From 1916 to 1935, the Philippines were divided into 12 senatorial districts, of which 11 elected two members each, for a total of 22 out of the 24 members of the upper house of Congress (the Senate). Since 1935 senators have been elected at large.

=====Regional=====
In addition, each congressional district that falls under the jurisdiction of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (a total of 8) elects three members each to the country&#x27;s only subnational legislative assembly.

=====Provincial=====
There are provincial districts for the purpose of electing (Provincial Council) members, which follow the congressional district arrangement, except that independent and highly urbanized cities whose charters prevent them from electing provincial officials are excluded. Also, provinces that comprise a lone congressional district are divided into at least two provincial districts.

=====City=====
There are also city councilor districts for the purpose of electing (City Council) members, which follow the congressional district arrangement. In cases where the city does not form two or more congressional districts by itself, it is divided into at least two city council districts.

====Administrative====
=====Current=====
Districts exist as administrative entities only in local government, with limited powers or responsibilities. Certain cities, such as Manila, Iloilo and Davao, for administrative purposes, formally divide their jurisdictions into city districts composed of several barangays, but the extent of these district-level administrative powers vary. Several barangays (the lowest level of government) also have the word &#x27;district&#x27; in their names – examples are those in Jala-jala and Zamboanga City. However, this is solely for the purpose of nomenclature, and does not imply a higher level of local government.

=====Historical=====
During Spanish and early American colonial rule, certain areas of the Philippines were designated as &#x27;districts,&#x27; mainly those that had not been formally organized into provinces or incorporated into existing ones.
In the American era, cities and municipalities were divided into city and municipal districts, which served as the lowest level of government before the creation of the .

====Special-purpose districts====
Special-purpose districts also exist in the Philippines, created for government departments and agencies. Examples are school districts for the Department of Education (DepEd), engineering districts for the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), and coast guard districts for the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG).

====Informal districts====
Some cities and municipalities also extend the usage of the word &#x27;district&#x27; to refer to certain areas, even without having any formal administrative purposes. Examples are the central business districts in Naga, Camarines Sur, and Makati.

===Poland===
The second-level unit of local government and administration in Poland, equivalent to a county, district or prefecture (LAU-1) in other countries is called a . As of 2008, there are 379 powiat-level entities in Poland: 314 land counties and 65 city counties. For a complete alphabetical listing, see list of counties in Poland.

===Portugal===
Districts () are administrative divisions of Portugal. They were mainly used as the jurisdiction areas for the civil governors, the government officials that represented locally the Central Government. However, in 2011, the role of the civil governor was &quot;de facto&quot; extinct (although not &quot;de jure&quot;), with the decision taken by the Government not to appoint new civil governors and to transfer its functions to other bodies. The district areas are now only used as the regional jurisdiction areas of some public bodies (like the Public Security Police district commands) and some private entities (like the district associations and championships of football).

===Russia===
In Russia, districts are administrative and municipal divisions of the federal subjects, as well as administrative divisions of larger cities (&quot;city districts&quot;) which are commonly referenced as () and () respectively.
The term &quot;district&quot; is also used to refer to the type of administrative division of the Sakha Republic— (; ). The Sakha Republic is administratively divided into five cities under the Republic&#x27;s jurisdiction and 33 &quot;uluses&quot;. The law of the Sakha Republic establishes that the terms and &quot;district&quot; are equivalent.

In historical context (for the Russian Empire), the term &quot;district&quot; is often used to refer to .

===Serbia===
Serbia is divided into twenty-nine districts () and the city of Belgrade, each of which is further divided into municipalities ()

===Slovakia===
In Slovakia, a district () is a local administrative unit.

===Slovenia===
===South Africa===


In South Africa, the district municipality forms the layer of government below the provinces. A district municipality is in turn divided into several local municipalities.

This structure varies in the eight largest urban areas:

# Bloemfontein (seat of the Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality),
# Cape Town (City of Cape Town Metropolitan Municipality),
# Durban (seat of the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality),
# East London / King Williams Town (seat of the Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality),
# East Rand (seat of the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality),
# Johannesburg (City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality),
# Port Elizabeth incl. Uitenhage (seat of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality) and
# Pretoria (seat of the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality),
where a metropolitan municipality replaces both a district and a local municipality.

===South Korea===
A district () is a subdivision of larger cities in South Korea. Smaller cities have no districts, whereas districts in Seoul and six Metropolitan Cities are treated as a city in their own right.

===Sri Lanka===
For purposes of local government, the country of Sri Lanka is divided into nine provinces: Western, Central, Southern, Northern, Eastern, North Western, North Central, Uva, and Sabaragamuwa. (The Northern and Eastern Provinces have however, technically been jointly administered since 1988.)

Each of the districts is divided into divisions. These were originally based on the feudal counties, the and . They were formerly known as &#x27;D.R.O. Divisions&#x27; after the &#x27;Divisional Revenue Officer&#x27;. Later the D.R.O.s became &#x27;Assistant Government Agents&#x27; and the Divisions were known as &#x27;A.G.A. Divisions&#x27;. Currently, the Divisions are administered by a &#x27;Divisional Secretary&#x27;, and are known as a &#x27;D.S. Divisions&#x27;. Rural D.S. Divisions are also administered by a &#x27;Pradeshiya Sabha&#x27; (Sinhala for &#x27;Regional Council&#x27;), which is elected.

===Sweden===
Some municipalities in the Kingdom of Sweden have divided their territory into smaller areas, which often are assigned an administrative board responsible for certain elements of municipal governance within their district. These areas take a variety of different Swedish names; however, &quot;district&quot; is usually the official English term for them. The term &quot;borough&quot; is sometimes used in unofficial contexts.

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, some cantons organize themselves into districts, while others dispense with districts and govern themselves at the (constituency or electoral district) level.

===Taiwan===
In the Republic of China on Taiwan, the district () is the 3rd level of the administrative division. It is a division of special municipality and provincial city of Taiwan Province. Currently, there are 157 districts in total from 5 special municipalities and 3 provincial cities.

===Thailand===
A district () is a subdivision of a province () in Thailand. Some provinces also contain minor districts (), which are smaller than the average district.

===Turkey===
In Turkey, a district () is an administrative subdivision of a province (). They are governed by a district governor/official (Kaymakam) appointed by the Ministry of the Interior, and a by the local population elected Mayor. See also Districts of Turkey.

===Uganda===
===Ukraine===
In Ukraine, districts (raions) second level of administrative division of Ukraine and are primarily the most common division of Ukrainian regions, as well as administrative divisions of larger cities (&quot;city districts&quot;).

===United Kingdom===
==== England ====
Districts are the most recognizable form of local government in large parts of England. For those areas that retain two-tier local government, districts usually form the lower tier of that arrangement, with counties forming the upper tier. Districts tend to have responsibility for a number of areas including:

*Tax collection (Council Tax and non-domestic rates)
*Leisure services
*Refuse collection
*Housing
*Planning
*Arts and entertainment
*Environmental health

Each district raises taxes from residents on behalf of itself, and the upper-tier authority through the Council Tax. It also raises income from business through the non-domestic rates system, which is coordinated nationally.

==== Northern Ireland ====
Northern Ireland is divided into 11 districts for local government purposes. The councils do not carry out the same range of functions as those in the rest of the United Kingdom; for example, they have no responsibility for education, road-building or housing (although they do nominate members to the advisory Northern Ireland Housing Council).

Their functions include waste and recycling services, leisure and community services, building control and local economic and cultural development. They are not planning authorities, but are consulted on some planning applications. The collection of rates (local tax) is handled by the Rate Collection Agency.

==== Scotland ====

Districts of Scotland were local government areas between 1975 and 1996.

Between 1930 and 1975, districts were subdivisions of counties, formed under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929. See List of local government areas in Scotland 1930–75. Scotland, since 1996, has been divided into 32 unitary council areas, and districts are no longer used.

Scotland has had other kinds of administrative areas which might be described as districts:

* Shires of Scotland, until 1975
* Subdivisions of Scotland, councils or unitary authorities, from 1996, pursuant to the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994
* Committee areas, from 1996, within larger unitary authorities

==== Wales ====
There is no official use of the word &quot;district&quot; in Wales. The country is broken up into 22 unitary authorities. However, &quot;district&quot; may be used informally for a whole or unofficial part of a ward in a city.

===United States===


There are several types of districts in the United States.

====Federal District====
The District of Columbia is the only part of the United States, excluding territories, that is not located within any of the fifty states.

====Legislative constituencies====
A constituency with a representative in Congress is a congressional district. Each state is organized into one or more such districts; the exact number within each state is based on the most recent census. Only voters within each district are allowed to vote in the election for the member of the House of Representatives from that district. Overall, there are 435 congressional districts in the United States; each has roughly 760,000 people, with some variance.

A constituency with a representative in a state legislature is a &quot;legislative district&quot;.

City councils that are not elected at-large may have constituencies called districts or wards.

====Federal judicial districts====
The territory over which a federal court has jurisdiction is a federal judicial district. In more than half of the states, a federal judicial district is coextensive with the state. In other states there is more than one such district.

====Single-purpose districts====
The United States also has many types of special-purpose districts with limited powers of local government. School districts are the most common, but other types of districts include community college districts, hospital districts, utility districts, irrigation districts, port districts, and public transit districts.

Many cities in the late 20th century adopted names for non-governmental districts as a way of increasing the recognition and identity of these distinct areas and neighborhoods. Perhaps most apparently in Los Angeles, various areas and neighborhoods within the city are specified as districts. For instance, Hollywood is a district of Los Angeles, whereas Beverly Hills and West Hollywood are independent incorporated cities, with their own governments and police departments. This can be confusing, as the difference between districts and neighboring cities is usually not readily apparent, for they all make up the Greater Los Angeles area. Typically, districts may or may not be distinguished at the boundary of the district with a &quot;district sign&quot; with the city&#x27;s insignia; whereas at a city boundary, a city limit sign would usually be placed on the street with the city&#x27;s name and population, at a minimum, but also often includes its elevation. The important distinction is that areas classified as districts are still part of the parent city and governed by the laws and ordinances of that city.

Various federal, regional, and local agencies such as the National Register of Historic Places recognized historic districts.

====Municipalities====
From the late 18th century until the Philadelphia Act of Consolidation in 1854, districts were politically independent municipalities made up of densely populated neighborhoods adjacent to but outside the legal boundaries of the City of Philadelphia. Northern Liberties, Southwark, and Spring Garden were among the ten largest municipalities by population in the United States.

====Municipal utility districts====
A municipal utility district is a special-purpose district or other jurisdiction that provides services (such as electricity, natural gas, sewage treatment, waste collection/management, wholesale telecommunications, and water) to district residents. Local residents may vote to establish a municipal utility district, which is represented by a board of directors elected by constituents. Municipal utilities are nonprofit government entities that serve at either the local or state level.

In the United States, public utility districts (PUD) have similar functions to municipal utility districts, but are created by a local government body such as a city or county, and have no authority to levy taxes. They provide public utilities to the residents of that district.

PUDs are created by a local government body, such as a city, county, or metropolitan service area (two or more communities joining together for public utility purposes). Normally the districts are non-profit. PUDs are often governed by a commission, which may be appointed or elected.

===Vietnam===
The term &quot;district&quot; in Vietnam refers to the second-level administrative unit, below provinces () and municipalities (). This second level unit is called a (counties) in rural areas, while in urban areas districts are either (subdivisions of municipalities), (provincial cities) or (towns). Vietnam had 707 &quot;districts&quot; including 77 provincial cities, 52 towns, 49 urban subdivisions, and 529 rural districts/counties (including 12 island districts/counties).

Vietnamese districts vary significantly in both population and area. Excluding the island districts, the most populous is Biên Hoà (provincial city) with 1,099,943 people; the least populous is the town of Mường Lay (12,125). Similarly, the largest district is Tương Dương (2,812.07 km2) while the smallest is Cồn Cỏ with an area of only 2.3 km2.

<text>The Irish Oath of Allegiance () was a controversial provision in the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, which Irish TDs (members of the Lower House of the Irish Parliament) and Senators were required to swear before taking their seats in Dáil Éireann (Chamber of Deputies) and Seanad Éireann (Irish Senate) before the Constitution (Removal of Oath) Act 1933 was passed on 3 May 1933. The controversy surrounding the Oath was one of the principal issues that led to the Irish Civil War of 1922–23 between supporters and opponents of the Treaty.

==Text of the Oath==

The Oath was included in Article 17 of the Irish Free State&#x27;s 1922 Constitution. It read:

The words &quot;allegiance to the Constitution of the Irish Free State&quot; were taken from De Valera&#x27;s preferred version, which read: &quot;I (name) do solemnly swear true faith and allegiance to the constitution of the Irish Free State, to the Treaty of Association, and to recognise the King of Great Britain as Head of Associated States.&quot;

The Oath had to be taken in front of the Governor-General of the Irish Free State or some other person authorised by him.

==Reaction==

The oath was largely the work of Michael Collins, based in its open lines on a draft oath suggested by the President of the Republic, Éamon de Valera, and also on the oath of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. In fact, Collins cleared the oath with the IRB &quot;before&quot; proposing it during the treaty negotiations. By the standards of the oaths of allegiance to be found in other British Commonwealth Dominions, it was quite mild, with no &quot;direct&quot; personal Oath to the monarch, only an indirect oath of fidelity by virtue of the King&#x27;s role in the treaty settlement as &quot;King in Ireland&quot;, a figurehead position. The public perception among those who were hostile to the treaty was that it was an offensive oath due to its inclusion of the British monarch. In their view:

* The oath was an acceptance of a common citizenship between Ireland and Britain under King George and therefore was in total contravention to the oath to the Irish Republic which they had previously taken.
* They rebutted the argument that it was simply an oath to the constitution by pointing out that the constitution itself made the King head of state and it was therefore the same as an oath of allegiance to him directly.
* They felt that the people had voted for a party which claimed it would fight for a full Republic and they could not accept something lesser without a fresh mandate from the people.

In contrast to this Pro-treaty campaigners declared that:

* The Oath of Allegiance was actually &quot;true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the Irish Free State&quot; (a line drafted by de Valera in his own proposed oath). The reference to the King involved a promise of &quot;fidelity&quot;, not an Oath of &quot;Allegiance&quot;.
* The fidelity to the King was not to him as &quot;British&quot; monarch but &quot;in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland with Great Britain and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of nations&quot;, in other words, in his role as the &quot;symbol&quot; of the Treaty settlement, &quot;not&quot; as British &quot;King&quot;.

The Collins 22 Society later said of the anti-treaty position, the idea that the oath &quot;was a direct oath to the Crown [was] a fact demonstrably incorrect by an examination of its wording. But in 1922 Ireland and beyond, it was the perception, not the reality, which influenced public debate on the issue.&quot;

As the Oath was effectively to the elected government in the Irish Free State, it was also described as the &quot;Crown in Ireland&quot;. Opposition to this was based on the fact that it was not fully discussed and explained before the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed in December 1921, and that many of the members of the second Dáil Éireann, elected without opposition in May 1921, had already sworn an Oath to uphold an Irish Republic.

==De Valera and abolition==

When de Valera founded Fianna Fáil as the Republican Party in 1926, he and his party, though agreeing to contest elections, refused to take the Oath. However, the assassination of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, Kevin O&#x27;Higgins, led the Cumann na nGaedheal government under W. T. Cosgrave to introduce a law requiring all Dáil &quot;candidates&quot; to pledge that they would take the oath, otherwise they could not contest the election. In these circumstances, de Valera took the Oath, declaring that he was simply signing a piece of paper to be admitted to the Dáil. In May 1933, de Valera amended the Free State&#x27;s constitution [at the time, amendable by simple majority in the Dáil], firstly to allow him to introduce any constitutional amendments irrespective of whether they clashed with the Anglo-Irish Treaty, then amended the constitution to remove Article 17 of the constitution which required the taking of the Oath. Robert Rowlette, who was elected in October 1933, was the first TD who did not have to take the Oath.

==Historical oaths of allegiance==

An oath of allegiance to the English crown was required by the Irish Act of Supremacy since the time of King Henry VIII (1537). This oath was extended under King William and Mary to peers, members of the House of Commons, bishops, barristers and attorneys. Under Queen Anne holders of many civil and Military offices were required to take oaths of allegiance, supremacy, and abjuration, to attend an Anglican Church of Ireland eucharist service and to declare against the Roman Catholic beliefs in transubstantiation. These oaths were gradually changed over the years.

Under British rule, an oath of allegiance to the King was required for (prospective) barristers in Ireland who were called to the Bar. This excluded from the Bar a number of Nationalists who were not prepared to swear such an oath. For Catholics, the wording of this and other oaths required by the British administration proved difficult since they were denouncing the Pope.

===Relief Act 1782===

Following the Relief Act 1782, which gave Catholic schools a legal footing, teachers were required to take an oath of allegiance to the British Crown. The oath was of a similar wording to that which was used by Catholics who served in the British military since 1774, previous oaths contained a profession of fidelity to the British Crown with a rejection of Papal authority.

===Trinity College Dublin===

The Roman Catholic Relief Act 1793 enacted by the Irish Parliament (which followed the British Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791), allowed Catholics to take degrees at Trinity College Dublin, by taking an oath of allegiance to the King but not supremacy which would negate their Catholic faith. It also affected Non-conformists who refused to accept the authority of the Crown and Anglican church.

===Maynooth College===

On the foundation in 1795 of St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth trustees, students and staff were required to swear an oath of allegiance to the King of Great Britain, since the college was in receipt of funding from the British Government. As a result, a number of clerics chose to study for the priesthood elsewhere. The Oath was compulsory until 1862 although it was common for students to ignore the oath by non-attendance at the ceremony.

===Confederate Oath of 1642===

The Confederate Oath of Association was an oath of loyalty to Charles I of England, made at a time when the jurors were mostly engaged in a war with the royal &quot;English Army for Ireland&quot;.

===City corporations===

There was an oath of allegiance required by members of the city corporations; this was an oath to the English monarch and accepted its supremacy.

===United Kingdom House of Commons===

The Oath of Allegiance was a barrier to Catholics in Ireland sitting in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom following the Acts of Union 1800. In 1828, following his victory in the election in County Clare, Daniel O&#x27;Connell refused to take the Oath of Allegiance to the British Crown. Following the passage of the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, O&#x27;Connell took his seat in 1830 and was the first Irish Catholic to do so since 1689.

, this oath of allegiance remains required before elected members of the House of Commons may take their seats and is one of the reasons for the abstentionist policy of Sinn Féin and other Nationalists in Northern Ireland.

<text>Wiktionary (, ; , ; rhyming with &quot;dictionary&quot;) is a multilingual, web-based project to create a free content dictionary of terms (including words, phrases, proverbs, linguistic reconstructions, etc.) in all natural languages and in a number of artificial languages. These entries may contain definitions, images for illustration, pronunciations, etymologies, inflections, usage examples, quotations, related terms, and translations of terms into other languages, among other features. It is collaboratively edited via a wiki. Its name is a portmanteau of the words &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. It is available in languages and in Simple English. Like its sister project Wikipedia, Wiktionary is run by the Wikimedia Foundation, and is written collaboratively by volunteers, dubbed &quot;Wiktionarians&quot;. Its wiki software, MediaWiki, allows almost anyone with access to the website to create and edit entries.

Because Wiktionary is not limited by print space considerations, most of Wiktionary&#x27;s language editions provide definitions and translations of terms from many languages, and some editions offer additional information typically found in thesauri.

Wiktionary&#x27;s data is frequently used in various natural language processing tasks.

== History and development ==
Wiktionary was brought online on December 12, 2002, following a proposal by Daniel Alston and an idea by Larry Sanger, co-founder of Wikipedia. On March 28, 2004, the first non-English Wiktionaries were initiated in French and Polish. Wiktionaries in numerous other languages have since been started. Wiktionary was hosted on a temporary domain name (wiktionary.wikipedia.org) until May 1, 2004, when it switched to the current domain name. , Wiktionary features over 30 million articles (and even more entries) across its editions. The largest of the language editions is the English Wiktionary, with over 7.5 million entries, followed by the French Wiktionary with over 4.7 million and the Malagasy Wiktionary with over 3.5 million entries. Forty-three Wiktionary language editions contain over 100,000 entries each.

Many of the definitions at the project&#x27;s largest language editions were created by bots that found creative ways to generate entries or (rarely) automatically imported thousands of entries from previously published dictionaries. Seven of the 18 bots registered at the English Wiktionary in 2007 created 163,000 of the entries there.

Another of these bots, &quot;&quot;, was responsible for the addition of a number of third-person conjugations that would not have received their own entries in standard dictionaries; for instance, it defined &quot;&quot; as the &quot;third-person singular simple present form of .&quot; Of the 1,269,938 definitions the English Wiktionary provides for 996,450 English words, 478,068 are &quot;form of&quot; definitions of this kind. This means that even without such entries, its coverage of English is significantly larger than that of major monolingual print dictionaries. &quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged&quot;, for instance, has 475,000 entries (with many additional embedded headwords); the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; has 615,000 headwords, but includes Middle English as well, for which the English Wiktionary has an additional 
34,234 gloss definitions. Detailed exist to show how many entries of various kinds exist.

The English Wiktionary does not rely on bots to the extent that some other editions do. The French and Vietnamese Wiktionaries, for example, imported large sections of the Free Vietnamese Dictionary Project (FVDP), which provides free content bilingual dictionaries to and from Vietnamese. These imported entries make up virtually all of the Vietnamese edition&#x27;s contents. Like the English edition, the French Wiktionary has imported approximately 20,000 entries from the Unihan database of Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Indian characters. The French Wiktionary grew rapidly in 2006 thanks in a large part to bots copying many entries from old, freely licensed dictionaries, such as the eighth edition of the (1935, around 35,000 words), and using bots to add words from other Wiktionary editions with French translations. The Russian edition grew by nearly 80,000 entries as &quot;LXbot&quot; added boilerplate entries (with headings, but without definitions) for words in English and German.

As of July 2021, the English Wiktionary has over 791,870 gloss definitions and over 1,269,938 total definitions (including different forms) for English entries alone, with a total of over 9,928,056 definitions across all languages.

===Logos===

Wiktionary has historically lacked a uniform logo across its numerous language editions. Some editions use logos that depict a dictionary entry about the term &quot;Wiktionary&quot;, based on the previous English Wiktionary logo, which was designed by Brooke Vibber, a MediaWiki developer. Because a purely textual logo must vary considerably from language to language, a four-phase contest to adopt a uniform logo was held at the Wikimedia Meta-Wiki from September to October 2006. Some communities adopted the winning entry by &quot;&quot;, a 3×3 grid of wooden tiles, each bearing a character from a different writing system. However, the poll did not see as much participation from the Wiktionary community as some community members had hoped, and a number of the larger wikis ultimately kept their textual logos.

In April 2009, the issue was resurrected with a new contest. This time, a depiction by &quot;AAEngelman&quot; of an open hardbound dictionary won a head-to-head vote against the 2006 logo, but the process to refine and adopt the new logo then stalled. In the following years, some wikis replaced their textual logos with one of the two newer logos. In 2012, 55 wikis that had been using the English Wiktionary logo received localized versions of the 2006 design by &quot;Smurrayinchester&quot;. In July 2016, the English Wiktionary adopted a variant of this logo. , 135 wikis, representing 61% of Wiktionary&#x27;s entries, use a logo based on the 2006 design by &quot;Smurrayinchester&quot;, 33 wikis (36%) use a textual logo, and three wikis (3%) use the 2009 design by &quot;AAEngelman&quot;.

== Multi-lingual ==
As of 2025, there are Wiktionary sites for languages of which are active and are closed. The active sites have articles, and the closed sites have articles. There are registered users of which are recently active.

== Critical reception ==
Critical reception of Wiktionary has been mixed. In 2006, Jill Lepore wrote in the article &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; for &quot;The New Yorker,&quot;

There&#x27;s no show of hands at &quot;Wiktionary&quot;. There&#x27;s not even an editorial staff. &quot;Be your own lexicographer!&quot;, might be &quot;Wiktionary&#x27;s&quot; motto. Who needs experts? Why pay good money for a dictionary written by lexicographers when we could cobble one together ourselves?

&quot;Wiktionary&quot; isn&#x27;t so much republican or democratic as Maoist. And it&#x27;s only as good as the copyright-expired books from which it pilfers.

Keir Graff&#x27;s review for &quot;Booklist&quot; was less critical:

Is there a place for Wiktionary? Undoubtedly. The industry and enthusiasm of its many creators are proof that there&#x27;s a market. And it&#x27;s wonderful to have another strong source to use when searching the odd terms that pop up in today&#x27;s fast-changing world and the online environment. But as with so many Web sources (including this column), it&#x27;s best used by sophisticated users in conjunction with more reputable sources.

References in other publications are fleeting and part of larger discussions of Wikipedia, not progressing beyond a definition, although David Brooks in &quot;The Nashua Telegraph&quot; described it as &quot;wild and woolly&quot;. One of the impediments to independent coverage of Wiktionary is the continuing confusion that it is merely an extension of Wikipedia.

The measure of correctness of the inflections for a subset of the Polish words in the English Wiktionary showed that this grammatical data is very stable (a study showed that only 131 out of 4,748 Polish words have had their inflection data corrected).

, Wiktionary has seen growing use in academia.

== Wiktionary data in natural language processing==
Wiktionary has semi-structured data. Wiktionary lexicographic data can be converted to machine-readable format in order to be used in natural language processing tasks.

Wiktionary&#x27;s data mining is a complex task. There are the following difficulties:
*(1) the constant and frequent changes to data and schemata
*(2) the heterogeneity in Wiktionary language edition schemata and
*(3) the human-centric nature of a wiki.

There are several parsers for different Wiktionary language editions:

* DBpedia Wiktionary : a subproject of DBpedia, the data are extracted from English, French, German, and Russian Wiktionaries; the data includes language, parts of speech, definitions, semantic relations and translations. The declarative description of the page schema, regular expressions and finite state transducer are used in order to extract information.
* JWKTL (Java Wiktionary Library) : provides access to English Wiktionary and German Wiktionary dumps via a Java Wiktionary API. The data includes language, parts of speech, definitions, quotations, semantic relations, etymologies and translations. JWKTL is distributed under the Apache License.
* wikokit : the parser of English Wiktionary and Russian Wiktionary. The parsed data includes language, parts of speech, definitions, quotations, semantic relations and translations. This is a multi-licensed open-source software.
* Etymological entries have been parsed in the Etymological WordNet project.

Examples of natural language processing tasks which have been solved with the help of Wiktionary data include:

* Rule-based machine translation between Dutch language and Afrikaans; data of English Wiktionary, Dutch Wiktionary and Wikipedia were used with the Apertium machine translation platform.
* Construction of machine-readable dictionary by the parser NULEX, which integrates open linguistic resources: English Wiktionary, WordNet, and VerbNet. The parser NULEX scrapes English Wiktionary for tense information (verbs), plural form and parts of speech (nouns).
* Speech recognition and synthesis, where Wiktionary was used to automatically create pronunciation dictionaries. Word-pronunciation pairs were retrieved from 6 Wiktionary language editions (Czech, English, French, Spanish, Polish, and German). Pronunciations are in terms of the International Phonetic Alphabet. The ASR system based on English Wiktionary has the highest word error rate, where each third phoneme has to be changed.
* Ontology engineering and semantic network constructing.
* Ontology matching.
* Text simplification. Medero &amp; Ostendorf assessed vocabulary difficulty (reading level detection) with the help of Wiktionary data. Properties of words extracted from Wiktionary entries (definition length and POS, sense, and translation counts) were investigated. Medero &amp; Ostendorf expected that
**(1) very common words will be more likely to have multiple parts of speech,
**(2) common words will be more likely to have multiple senses,
**(3) common words will be more likely to have been translated into multiple languages. These features extracted from Wiktionary entries were useful in distinguishing word types that appear in Simple English Wikipedia articles from words that only appear in the Standard English comparable articles.
* Part-of-speech tagging. Li et al. (2012) built multilingual POS-taggers for eight resource-poor languages on the basis of English Wiktionary and hidden Markov models.
* Sentiment analysis.

&quot;Wikidata:Lexicographical data&quot; was started in 2018 to provide structured data support to Wiktionaries. It stores word data of all languages in a machine readable data model, under a dedicated &quot;Lexeme&quot; namespace in Wikidata. As of October 2021, the project has amassed over 600,000 lexeme entries of various languages.

<text>An announcer is a voice artist who relays information to the audience of a broadcast media programme or live event.

==Television and other media==
Some announcers work in television production, radio or filmmaking, usually providing narrations, news updates, station identification, or an introduction of a product in television commercials or a guest on a talk show. Music television announcers were also called video jockeys (VJ).

Announcers are often voice actors who read prepared scripts, but in some cases, they have to ad-lib commentary on the air when presenting news, sports, weather, time, and television commercials. Occasionally, announcers are also involved in writing the screenplay or scripts when one is required. Sometimes announcers also interview guests and moderate panels or discussions. Some provide commentary for the audience during sporting events (known as sports announcers), parades, and other events.

Announcers perform a variety of tasks including presenting news, sports, weather, traffic, and music. Other duties include interviewing guests, making public appearances at promotional events, announcing station programming information. Announcers are also sometimes responsible for operating studio equipment and producing/selling advertisements. Television and radio announcers generally have a bachelor&#x27;s degree in communications, broadcasting, or journalism. Some announcers cross &quot;fields&quot; by working in multiple media, such as television, radio, and commercials. For example, Bob Eubanks was in radio then became a television game show host, occasionally doing both jobs at the same time, and Townsend Coleman III started in radio then became a free-lance voice-over announcer and went on to voice cartoons.

==Radio==
===The role of the announcer in radio stations on air===
In some radio stations (mainly news), the announcers must have special skill, dexterity and agility when transmitting information.

An example of this is the news station Radio Reloj, where the pages of two voices must have between 15 and 16 lines written, and those of one voice, between 13 and 15. If the information meets that requirement and the announcer from the beginning reads at an appropriate pace, must conclude at the exact minute. However, it may happen that some minutes the editors leave them a little long. Faced with this situation, the speaker accelerates the pace of his reading, in order to finish the text on time. Sometimes when the news is short, the announcer completes it with the so-called queues, which are important ephemeris, curious facts, congratulations to personalities. It may also be the case that information has the lines, in correspondence with its format, but has several points and followed. This implies that the announcer pauses, and has to speed up the reading rhythm to finish on the exact minute. In fact Mauricio Lomonte, an announcer for this station, said:

===Others===
Radio announcers are often known as disc jockeys (DJs). While some read from scripts, others completely ad-lib. These DJs&#x27; tasks consist of on-air interviewing, taking/responding to listener requests, running contests, and making remarks about various subjects like the weather, traffic, sports, and other news. Most radio announcers announce the artists and titles of songs, but don&#x27;t necessarily choose what song airs on the radio. Many stations have a management teams who select the songs ahead of time. Today radio stations have DJs update the station&#x27;s website with music, guest interviews, show schedules, and photos. Radio announcers are also known radio jockeys (RJ).

==Live events==

Public address (PA) announcers work in physical locations, including sporting venues. They will give the attendees information about performing acts, speakers, players, score (such as a goal or touchdown), infractions, or the results of the event.

Announcers may be specialized according to sport; for instance, a horse race announcer provides a rapid-fire second-by-second account of the race (as well as introducing the entries before the race), while a horse show announcer is the &quot;voice of management&quot; and helps keep the show moving, plays select music and makes announcements during the show. A baseball announcer may simply introduce the next batter or recap the previous half-inning. Public address announcers may be notable due to their longevity, or tenure with a popular team or venue. Some announcers, particularly in horse racing, may also be known for television or radio work.

<doc id="156661" wikidata="Q322148" url="?curid=156661" title="Council Tax">
<text>Council Tax is a local taxation system used in England, Scotland and Wales. It is a tax on domestic property, which was introduced in 1993 by the Local Government Finance Act 1992, replacing the short-lived Community Charge (also known as &quot;poll tax&quot;), which in turn replaced the domestic rates. Each property is assigned one of eight bands in England and Scotland (A to H), or nine bands in Wales (A to I), based on property value, and the tax is set as a fixed amount for each band. The higher the band, the higher the tax. Some property is exempt from the tax, and some people are exempt from the tax, while some get a discount.

In 2011, the average annual levy on a property in England was £1,196 (). In 2014–15, the tax raised enough money to cover 24.3% of council expenditure.

Council Tax is difficult to avoid or evade and therefore has one of the highest collection rates of any tax, with in-year collection rates of 97.0% in 2014–15.

== Organisation ==
Council Tax is collected by the local authority (known as the &quot;collecting authority&quot;). However, it may consist of components (precepts) levied and redistributed to other agencies or authorities (each known as a &quot;precepting authority&quot;).

=== The nature of the Council Tax ===
The Valuation Tribunal Service has cleared up many previous doubts regarding the exact nature of Council Tax and states that:

At the bottom and middle end of the market, Council Tax is a progressive tax based on the value of the property; the higher the value of the property, the higher the amount of tax levied irrespective of the number of inhabitants at the property (except the reduction allowed for single tenancy). However, there is only one band for properties valued (in 1991 or, for those built later, the value they would have had then) above £320,000, and so the tax stops increasing after this point. Therefore, the tax has been criticised for being disproportionate, with those in more expensive houses not paying as much as those in smaller houses as a proportion of the value of the house, and has therefore been called a &quot;new poll tax for the poor&quot;.

The valuation of the property is carried out by the Valuation Office Agency in England and Wales and by Scottish Assessors in Scotland.

===Council Tax arrears===

An area that is facing growing attention is the number of households that are falling into arrears with their Council Tax payments. The ordinary route for councils to chase unpaid debts is to apply to a magistrates&#x27; court for a liability order. If a liability order is granted, the council can undertake enforcement action. In 2014–15, the court and administration costs in relation to Council Tax debt increased by 17%.

===Collecting authorities===
The collecting authorities are the councils of the districts of England, principal areas of Wales and council areas of Scotland, i.e. the lowest tier of local government aside from parishes and communities.

===Precepting authorities===

The precepting authorities are councils from other levels of local government such as county or parish councils and other agencies. In metropolitan counties where there is no county council, the joint boards are precepting authorities. There may be precepting authorities for special purposes that cover an area as small as a few streets or as large as an entire county.

These all set their precepts independently. Each of the levying authorities sets a precept (total amount) to be collected for households in their area. This is then divided by the number of &quot;nominal Band D&quot; properties in the authority&#x27;s area (county, district, national park, etc.) to reach the Band D amount.

=== Liability for Council Tax ===
In general terms: The occupiers of a property are liable, regardless of tenure, or the owners if the property is unoccupied, except if the property is a house in multiple occupation, in which case the landlord is liable for paying the Council Tax.

==Calculation==
Each dwelling is allocated to one of eight bands coded by letters A to H (A to I in Wales) on the basis of its assumed capital value (as at 1 April 1991 in England and Scotland, 1 April 2003 in Wales). Newly constructed properties are also assigned a nominal 1991 (2003 for Wales) value.

Each local authority sets a tax rate expressed as the annual levy on a Band D property inhabited by two liable adults. This decision automatically sets the amounts levied on all types of households and dwellings. The &quot;nominal Band D&quot; property total is calculated by adding together the number of properties in each band and multiplying by the band ratio. So 100 Band D properties will count as 100 &quot;nominal Band D&quot; properties, whereas 100 Band C properties will count as 89 &quot;nominal Band D&quot; properties. Each collecting authority then adds together the Band D amounts for their area (or subdivisions of their area in the case, for example, of civil parish council precepts) to reach a total Band D Council Tax bill.

To calculate the Council Tax for a particular property, a ratio is then applied. A Band D property will pay the full amount, whereas a Band H property will pay twice that. Note there is no upper limit for band H. This means that in reality, someone who lives in a multimillion-pound mansion will pay three times more than someone in a bedsit, which falls into Band A.

===Revaluation===
The government had planned to revalue all properties in England in 2007, which would have been the first revaluation since 1993, but in September 2005, it was announced that the revaluation in England would be postponed until &quot;after the next election&quot;. At the same time, the terms of reference of the Lyons Inquiry were extended and the report date pushed out to December 2006 (subsequently extended to 2007).

In Wales, tax bills based on the property revaluations use 2003 prices issued in 2005. Because of the surge in house prices over the late 1990s and early 2000s, more than a third of properties in Wales found themselves in a band higher than under the 1991 valuation. Some properties were moved up three or even four bands with consequent large increases in the amount of Council Tax demanded. Some properties were moved into new Band I at the top of the price range. Only 8% of properties were moved down in bands.

However, a large shift of properties between bands will cause a shift in the allocation of the charge between bands, and the tax levied for each particular band will then drop, as the total amount collected will remain the same for each authority (see &quot;calculation of amount&quot; above).

Between the wholesale revaluations, a major change to a property (such as an extension, or some major blight causing loss of value) can trigger a revaluation to a new estimate of the value the property would have reached if sold in 1991. If such a change would result in an increase in value, then re-banding will only take effect when the property is sold or otherwise transferred.

===Current bands===
====England====
In England, the Council Tax bands are as follows:

====Wales====
In Wales, the bands were re-set on 1 April 2005 by the then National Assembly for Wales, based on 2003 valuations. In addition to revising the band boundaries upwards, an extra band was added.

====Scotland====
In Scotland, the current bands are

===Rates===

====Geographic variation====

Due to the different make-up of each council area, Council Tax rates can vary quite a bit between different local authorities. This is less noticeable in parts of the country like Scotland, where band D rates in 2011 varied from a low of £1,024 (in the Western Isles) to a high of £1,230 (in Aberdeen), but the effect can be more pronounced in parts of England. For example, the 2018 rates in London had this sort of distribution:

====Variation over time====

Under the Labour government of Tony Blair, average Council Tax rates rose dramatically above inflation.

The subsequent Coalition government made an effort to get councils to freeze Council Tax rates, gradually eroding the above inflation increases via ordinary inflation. This was achieved by offering councils large grants in return for freezing their Council Tax rate; for example, in some years these grants were equal to the amount that would have been gained by a 1% Council Tax rise.

In addition, the law has been changed, so that councils cannot increase Council Tax by an amount higher than a cap specified by the government (currently 3%), without holding a local referendum to approve the change; so far only one council has invoked such a referendum, but many have raised Council Tax as close to the cap as they can get without passing it (for example, by 2.99%). This limit, combined with falling grants from central government due to austerity policy, has led councils to have a real-terms cut in spending power of more than 10% in 2021–22 compared to 2009–10, which has inevitably led to service reductions and cuts.

Although local government policy is a devolved matter, the Barnett Formula leads the Scottish Government to acquire funding somewhat in accordance with central government priorities. Subsequently, by 2013, the Scottish Government froze Council Tax rates for the fourth time.

==Reductions==

===Exemptions===

Some dwellings are automatically exempt from Council Tax liability; these are officially organised into a number of distinct classes. Most of these exemption classes only apply when the property is completely unoccupied; these are as follows:

The remaining exemption classes apply not only when the property is unoccupied, but also when certain categories of people are living there:

Other classes existed historically and are no longer mandatory. Councils may still offer 100% discount; some discount or no discount at all at their discretion. Once a property has been vacant for over 2 years, they have the right to levy a surcharge of up to an additional 50% on the standard Council Tax rate for the property.

All persons normally resident in a property are counted for Council Tax liability. However, certain classes of person are treated as &#x27;disregarded persons&#x27;. Such persons do not count towards occupancy. If a property is occupied entirely by disregarded persons then it is taxed as an empty property (50% discount) unless it otherwise qualifies for total exemption.

A person is disregarded if they are:
* aged 17 or under (but S above may apply).
* aged 18 and someone is entitled to draw child benefit for them.
* a school or college leaver aged under 20 who left after 30 April in any year (disregarded until 1 November in the same year even if employed and counts toward exemption N above).
* a full-time student on a qualifying course of education (but N above may apply).
* a foreign language assistant on the official British Council programme (but N above may apply as this counts as being a student).
* a spouse, partner or dependent of either of the above two classes who is not a British citizen and is prohibited from working or claiming benefit by the immigration rules (but N above may apply).
* a young person on a government training scheme or in certain kinds of apprenticeship.
* a prisoner or someone who has been detained for deportation or detained under the Mental Health Act.
* someone who is severely mentally impaired (but U above may apply).
* a long-term patient in a hospital or resident in a care home.
* living in a hostel which provides care or treatment because of old-age; physical or mental disability; past or present alcohol or drug dependence; past or present mental illness.
* living in a bail or probation hostel.
* a live-in carer (exemption J may apply to their original home).
* staying in a hostel or night shelter.
* a member of any religious community.
* a member of a visiting armed force.
* a dependent of a member of a visiting armed force.

===Statutory discounts===

====Low occupancy====

A fixed discount, currently set at 25%, is available when there are fewer than two residents; this is known as the &quot;Single Person Discount&quot;. Though it is often concluded that the full Council Tax charge must, therefore, be based on two or more adults being resident at a property, this is not strictly true.

Some people are automatically disregarded when counting the number of residents for this purpose, such as full-time students. The legislation also provides that, to count as a resident of a property, an individual should have the property as their sole or main residence; case law has established that no single test may be used to determine whether this condition is met.

As part of the National Fraud Initiative, every other year, the Audit Commission analyses metadata deriving from Council Tax accounts together with the full electoral register to produce lists of people it believes should be subjected to an investigation on the basis that there is a risk that a discount is being received when an adult who does not fail to be disregarded is actually resident in the dwelling.

====Disabled occupancy====

If a property has been adapted to meet the needs of a disabled occupant, then, after applying in writing, and provided the adaptations are of a certain extent, the property will be rebanded to the band immediately below its normal Council Tax band. If the property was in the lowest Council Tax band, it will be placed into a Band Z (the band below A).

===Discretionary reductions===

Under the Welfare Reform Act 2012, local councils were given powers to create new deduction rules for their Council Tax. As these rules replace the former statutory rebate schemes, the Act has also restricted the councils from increasing, by more than a certain amount, the net Council Tax bill for any individual who previously received a rebate.

Since 2013, explicit Council Tax discounts have been provided, now officially known as &quot;Council Tax Reduction&quot; schemes, though many councils market them to residents as &quot;Council Tax Support&quot;; the choice to market the rules as a tax cut, rather than a benefit, may be an ideological one..

Many local authorities choose to use similar or identical rules to the former statutory rebate schemes, while others took the opportunity to levy a small level of tax on people with low incomes. In particular people in receipt of the &quot;Guarantee Credit&quot; element of Pension Credit (or who would meet the same qualifying rules) must continue to receive a 100% discount (that is, a Council Tax bill of £0).

==Former statutory rebates==
Historically, a number of statutory Council Tax rebates existed. These were applied to the Council Tax account in advance of the bill being delivered to the claimant, effectively creating a discount. However, the schemes were administered by the local authority responsible for producing the relevant Council Tax bill. Though the funding was provided by central government, the Council Tax bill it rebated was paid to the local authority.

Originally using paper application forms, local authorities began to use a telephone-based application process, in the last few years of the rebate schemes. Under these latter application schemes, claimants would often contact the responsible central government department (for example, by making a benefit claim), who would then forward the details to the local authority.

===Second Adult Rebate===

Many individuals share their dwelling with members of separate households, who would ordinarily be expected to pay a share of the Council Tax bill. However, in some cases, it would not be reasonable to expect those other residents to be able to pay a full share; to assist individuals sharing with those residents, a rebate (&quot;Second Adult Rebate&quot;) was available, as follows:
* 25%, if each of the second adults are in receipt of one of
**Income-Based Jobseekers Allowance, or
**Income Support, or
**Income-Related Employment and Support Allowance, or
**Pension Credit
*otherwise, it is based on the combined gross weekly income of all the second adults:
**15%, if under £175
**7.5%, if between £175 and £227.99
**nothing, if £228 or above

===Council Tax Benefit===
&quot;Council Tax Benefit&quot; was a means-tested rebate that potentially rebated 100% of a claimant&#x27;s Council Tax bill. The rebate would be reduced by a fifth of any qualifying income above a certain level; benefits did not qualify for this calculation, but most other income did. In effect, Council Tax Benefit was a rebate for people with low incomes.

The claimant could not be awarded both Council Tax Benefit and Second Adult Rebate; only the higher of the two, in relation to the claimant&#x27;s circumstances, would be awarded.

====Non-dependant deductions====

A &quot;non-dependant&quot; is a person that the claimant is sharing accommodation with but is not a member of their own household (that is, not a partner, dependant, etc.), such as lodgers or joint tenants. Since it would be reasonable to expect non-dependants to contribute towards the Council Tax bill, Council Tax Benefit was reduced so that it only covered the claimant&#x27;s hypothetical portion of the Council Tax bill.

However, no reduction was imposed if the claimant or their partner needed substantial care; this qualification was met if, and only if, the claimant was:
*Registered blind, or
*In receipt of
**the Care Component (any rate) of Disability Living Allowance, or
**Severe Disablement Allowance, or
**Exceptionally Severe Disablement Allowance

No contribution was expected from non-dependants who would themselves qualify for Council Tax benefit, were not counted towards the number of residents liable for Council Tax (for example, due to being a student), were normally resident elsewhere, or were not adults. But the remaining non-dependants were each hypothetically expected to contribute the following amounts:
*£2.30 if in part-time work, otherwise
*£2.30 if weekly income is under £178
*£4.60 if weekly income is between £178 and £305.99
*£5.80 if weekly income is between £306 and £381.99
*£6.95 if weekly income is over £382

Council Tax Benefit was therefore reduced by an amount equal to these hypothetically expected contributions.

==Criticisms==
Council tax has been criticised as regressive, as it is not based upon the occupants ability to pay, and for placing a higher burden on lower earners. Therefore, income scaled alternatives have been proposed, such as the progressive &quot;Scottish Service Tax&quot; proposed by the Scottish Socialist Party, which is scaled into various tax rate bands depending on household income. In 2021, academics and thinktanks from across the political spectrum referred to council tax as a &quot;wealth tax&quot; on the poorer parts of Britain. The groups and academics stated that council tax needed reform based on homeowners’ ability to pay. As part of a letter sent to then chancellor Rishi Sunak the groups stated that council tax put the &quot;heaviest burden on the young, low-earners, and those living in less prosperous parts of the country, who typically reside in modest properties&quot; and that it should be reformed.

===London===

A report from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), funded by Trust for London, called for significant reform of the Council Tax system in London. The report called for Council Tax to be devolved to London, for exemptions for second and empty homes to be brought to an end and for Council Tax to be replaced with a property tax which is proportional to the present-day value of homes.

===Collection of unpaid tax===

====Scotland====
In Scotland, criticism has been levied not so much at the principle of the tax, but at its debt collection arrangements: Council Tax debts can be pursued up to 40 years later – few people will have conserved their payment receipts for such a long time and as such are unable to prove that they paid. Under Scots law, it is the responsibility of the tax payer to prove that the tax has been paid, not for the council to prove that it has not.

John Wilson MSP presented an Enforcement of Local Tax Arrears (Scotland) Bill on 19 March 2010 in order to try to reduce this collection time from 20 to 5 years. Although Wilson&#x27;s bill has not made any progress (), a Bill was introduced in the Scottish Parliament, the Community Charge Debt (Scotland) Bill, to stop Councils pursuing debts from the older Community Charge. The Bill received royal assent on 25 March 2015, and as detailed in section 1 of the Act, all Community Charge and associated liabilities were extinguished in Scotland as of 1 February 2015.

====England and Wales====
The ability to collect Council Tax debt, in line with other debts, expires six years after the amount became due unless a liability order has been granted by a magistrates&#x27; court. This six-year limit is specifically included in legislation via regulation 34(3) of the Council Tax (Administration and Enforcement) Regulations 1992. Once a liability order has been granted, then, unlike Scotland, there is no limit in legislation as to how long the Council Tax arrears remain outstanding. This allows a local authority to chase debts many years after the original liability order was granted. Councils can garnish wages, send bailiffs to seize property, and imprison people for three months.

===Allocation to wrong tax band===

An edition of the current affairs programme &quot;Tonight with Trevor McDonald&quot; on 26 January 2007 investigated whether millions of homes had been placed in the wrong band in the original 1991 valuation. It was shown that the banding valuations were often done by &#x27;second gear valuations&#x27;; in other words, valuations were often done by driving past homes and allocating bands via a cursory external valuation. The programme followed case studies of a system devised by the presenter Martin Lewis, published on his website in October 2006, who had received thousands back in back payments after appealing their band allocations. This &quot;Council Tax Cashback&quot; system was said to have the potential to reach millions and received widespread publicity, likely to encourage people to challenge the system. There had been no information published on how many have been successful in obtaining a reduced banding until 22 November 2008 when the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, in a news article about the campaign by Martin Lewis, stated that in the past year 97,563 properties in England and Wales had been rebanded, with 69,695 of those down-graded.

<text>The Uppsala Astronomical Observatory (UAO), Astronomiska observatoriet i Uppsala) is the oldest astronomical observatory in Sweden. It was founded in 1741, though there was a professorial chair of astronomy at the University of Uppsala from 1593 and the university archives include lecture notes in astronomy from the 1480s.

In the 18th century, Anders Celsius performed his research there and built the first observatory proper in 1741. Celsius got the university to buy a large stone house of medieval origin in central Uppsala, where he had an observatory constructed on the rooftop. Celsius both worked and had his personal living quarters in the house. This observatory remained in use until the new observatory, now known as the &quot;old observatory&quot;, was built in 1853. The Celsius house itself remains as one of few older buildings on a modern shopping street, but the observatory on the roof was demolished in 1857.

In the 19th century Anders Jonas Ångström was keeper of the observatory and conducted his experiments in astronomy, physics and optics there. His son, Knut Ångström, also conducted research on solar radiation at the observatory.

In 2000 the observatory merged with the Institute of Space Physics to form the Department of Astronomy and Space Physics and moved to the Ångström Laboratory. In 2008, another merger resulted in the Department of Physics and Astronomy, Astronomy and Space Physics becoming one of its divisions.

In addition to facilities in Uppsala, the observatory maintains the Kvistaberg Observatory in Sweden and the Uppsala Southern Station at the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia.

Research at the observatory over the years includes stellar parallaxes, stellar statistics, galactic structure, external galaxies, stellar atmospheres and Solar System research.

<doc id="156666" wikidata="Q208083" url="?curid=156666" title="List of Hungarian monarchs">
<text>This is a list of Hungarian monarchs; it includes the grand princes (895–1000) and the kings and ruling queens of Hungary (1000–1918).

The Hungarian Grand Principality was established around 895, following the 9th-century Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin. The Kingdom of Hungary existed from 1000–1001 with the coronation of King Saint Stephen. The Árpád dynasty, the male-line descendants of Grand Prince Árpád, ruled Hungary continuously from 895 to 1301. Christianity was adopted as the state religion for the Kingdom of Hungary by King Saint Stephen and the kings of the Árpád dynasty used the title of the apostolic king. The descendants of the dynasty gave the world the highest number of saints and blesseds from one family. Therefore, since the 13th century the dynasty has often been referred to as the &quot;Kindred of the Holy Kings&quot;. The Árpád dynasty ruled the Carpathian Basin for four hundred years, influencing almost all of Europe through its extensive dynastic connections. The paternal lineage of the Árpád dynasty came to end in 1301 with the death of King Andrew III of Hungary, and all of the subsequent kings of Hungary (with the exception of King Matthias Corvinus) were cognatic descendants of the Árpád dynasty. In 1918, after World War I, King Charles IV &quot;renounced participation&quot; in state affairs, but did not abdicate. The Kingdom of Hungary existed as a country from 1920 to 1946, and officially represented the Hungarian monarchy, but in reality there was no king.

==Chieftains before the Conquest==

==Grand Princes of Hungary==

===House of Árpád===
&quot;The king-list for the first half of the 10th century is often disputed, as the Hungarian nation consisted of several tribes led by various leaders. The most frequently proposed list is:&quot;

==Kings of Hungary==

=== House of Árpád (1000–1301) ===

===House of Přemyslid (1301–1305)===
=== House of Wittelsbach (1305–1307) ===
===House of Anjou (1308–1395)===
===House of Luxembourg (1387–1437)===
===House of Habsburg (1437–1457)===
=== House of Jagiellon (1440–1444) ===
=== House of Hunyadi (1458–1490) ===
===House of Jagiellon (1490–1526)===

King Louis II of Hungary died at Battle of Mohács in 1526. After the death of the Hungarian king, both the Hungarian noble Zápolya family and the Austrian Habsburg family claimed the whole kingdom. King John I of Hungary ruled the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom, and the Habsburgs ruled the western part of Hungary.

===House of Zápolya (1526–1540)===
=== House of Habsburg (1526–1564) ===
=== House of Zápolya (1540–1570) ===

The Habsburgs tried several times to unite all Hungary under their rule, but the Ottoman Empire prevented that by supporting the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom. King John I died in 1540, the Habsburg forces besieged Buda the Hungarian capital in 1541, Sultan Suleiman led a relief force and defeated the Habsburgs, the Ottomans captured the city by a trick during the Siege of Buda and the south central and central areas of the kingdom came under the authority of the Ottoman Empire, therefore Hungary was divided into three parts&quot;.&quot; The north-western rim of the Hungarian kingdom remained unconquered and recognised members of the House of Habsburg as Kings of Hungary, giving it the name &quot;Royal Hungary&quot;. The Eastern Hungarian Kingdom is the predecessor of the Principality of Transylvania, which was established by the Treaty of Speyer in 1570 and the Eastern Hungarian King became the first Prince of Transylvania. The Principality of Transylvania was a semi-independent state, and a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire, it continued to be part of the Kingdom of Hungary in the sense of public law, John Sigismund&#x27;s possessions belonged to the Holy Crown of Hungary, and was a symbol of the survival of Hungarian statehood.

<text>Ehlers–Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of 13 genetic connective-tissue disorders. Symptoms often include loose joints, joint pain, stretchy velvety skin, and abnormal scar formation. These may be noticed at birth or in early childhood. Complications may include aortic dissection, joint dislocations, scoliosis, chronic pain, or early osteoarthritis. The existing classification was last updated in 2017, when a number of rarer forms of EDS were added.
EDS occurs due to mutations in one or more particular genes—there are 19 genes that can contribute to the condition. The specific gene affected determines the type of EDS, though the genetic causes of hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome are still unknown. Some cases result from a new variation occurring during early development, while others are inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive manner. Typically, these variations result in defects in the structure or processing of the protein collagen or tenascin.
Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and confirmed by genetic testing or skin biopsy, particularly with hypermobile EDS (hEDS), but people may initially be misdiagnosed with hypochondriasis, depression, or myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. Genetic testing can be used to confirm all other types of EDS.
A cure is not yet known, and treatment is supportive in nature. Physical therapy and bracing may help strengthen muscles and support joints. Several medications can help alleviate symptoms of EDS such as pain and blood pressure drugs, which reduce joint pain and complications caused by blood vessel weakness. Some forms of EDS result in a normal life expectancy, but those that affect blood vessels generally decrease it. All forms of EDS can result in fatal outcomes for some patients.
While hEDS affects at least one in 5,000 people globally, other types occur at lower frequencies. The prognosis depends on the specific disorder. Excess mobility was first described by Hippocrates in 400 BC. The syndromes are named after two physicians, Edvard Ehlers and Henri-Alexandre Danlos, who described them at the turn of the 20th century.
== Types ==
In 2017, 13 subtypes of EDS were classified using specific diagnostic criteria. According to the Ehlers–Danlos Society, the syndromes can also be grouped by the symptoms determined by specific gene mutations. Group A disorders are those that affect primary collagen structure and processing. Group B disorders affect collagen folding and crosslinking. Group C are disorders of structure and function of myomatrix. Group D disorders are those that affect glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. Group E disorders are characterized by defects in the complement pathway. Group F are disorders of intracellular processes, and Group G is considered to be unresolved forms of EDS.

===Classical===
Classical EDS is characterized by extremely elastic skin that is fragile and bruises easily and hypermobility of the joints. Molluscoid pseudotumors (calcified hematomas that occur over pressure points) and spheroids (cysts that contain fat occurring over forearms and shins) are also often seen. A side complication of the hyperelasticity presented in many EDS cases makes wounds closing on their own more difficult. Sometimes, motor development is delayed and hypotonia occurs. The variation causing this type of EDS is in the genes &quot;COL5A2, COL5A1,&quot; and less frequently &quot;COL1A1&quot;. It involves the skin more than hEDS. In classical EDS, large variation in symptom presentation is seen. Because of this variance, EDS has often been underdiagnosed. Without genetic testing, healthcare professionals may be able to provide a provisional diagnosis based on careful examination of the mouth, skin, and bones, as well as by neurological assessment.

A good way to begin the diagnostic process is by reviewing a person&#x27;s family history. EDS is an autosomal dominant condition, so is often inherited from parents. Genetic testing remains the most reliable way to diagnose EDS. No cure for type 1 EDS has been found, but a course of non-weight-bearing exercise can help with muscular tension, which can help correct some EDS symptoms. Anti-inflammatory drugs and lifestyle changes can help with joint pain. Lifestyle choices should also be made with children who have EDS to try to prevent wounds to the skin. Protective garments can help with this. In a wound, deep stitches are often used and left in place for longer than normal.

===Classical-like===
Classical-like EDS (clEDS) is characterized by skin hyperextensibility with velvety skin texture and absence of atrophic scarring, generalized joint hypermobility with or without recurrent dislocations (most often shoulder and ankle), and easily bruised skin or spontaneous ecchymoses (discolorations of the skin resulting from bleeding underneath). It can be caused by variations in the &quot;TNXB&quot; gene.

===Arthrochalasia===
Arthrochalasia EDS (aEDS; formerly categorized as types 7A and B) is characterized by severe joint hypermobility and congenital hip dislocation. Other common features include fragile, elastic skin with easy bruising, hypotonia, kyphoscoliosis (kyphosis and scoliosis), and mild osteopenia. Type-I collagen is usually affected. It is very rare, with about 30 cases reported. It is more severe than the hypermobility type. Variations in the genes&quot; COL1A1&quot; and &quot;COL1A2 &quot;cause it.

===Brittle-cornea syndrome===
Brittle-cornea syndrome (BCS) is characterized by the progressive thinning of the cornea, early-onset progressive keratoglobus or keratoconus, nearsightedness, hearing loss, and blue sclerae. Classic symptoms, such as hypermobile joints and hyperelastic skin, are also seen often. It has two types. Type 1 occurs due to variations in the &quot;ZNF469&quot; gene. Type 2 is due to variations in the &quot;PRDM5&quot; gene.

===Cardiac-valvular===
Cardiac-valvular EDS (cvEDS) is characterized by three major criteria: severe progressive cardiac-valvular problems (affecting aortic and mitral valves), skin problems such as hyperextensibility, atrophic scarring, thin skin, and easy bruising, and joint hypermobility (generalized or restricted to small joints). Four minor criteria may aid in the diagnosis of cvEDS. cvEDS is an autosomal recessive disorder, inherited through variation in both alleles of the gene &quot;COL1A2.&quot;

===Dermatosparaxis===
Dermatosparaxis EDS (dEDS; formerly categorized as type 7C) is associated with extremely fragile skin leading to severe bruising and scarring; saggy, redundant skin, especially on the face; hypermobility ranging from mild to serious; and hernias. Variations in the &quot;ADAMTS2&quot; gene cause it. It is extremely rare, with around 11 cases reported worldwide.

===Hypermobile ===
Hypermobile EDS (hEDS, formerly categorized as type 3) is mainly characterized by hypermobility that affects both large and small joints. It may lead to frequent joint subluxations (partial dislocations) and dislocations. In general, people with this variant have skin that is soft, smooth, and velvety and bruises easily, and may have chronic muscle or bone pain. It affects the skin less than other forms. It has no available genetic test. hEDS is the most common of the 19 types of connective tissue disorders. Since no genetic test exists, providers have to diagnose hEDS based on what they know about the condition and the patient&#x27;s physical attributes. Other than the general signs, attributes can include faulty connective tissues throughout the body, musculoskeletal issues, and family history. Along with these general signs and side effects, patients can have trouble healing.

Pregnant individuals who have hEDS are at an increased risk for complications. Some possible complications are pre-labor rupture of membranes, a drop in blood pressure with anesthesia, precipitated birth (very fast, active labor), malposition of the fetus, and increased bleeding. Individuals with hEDS may run the risk of falling, postpartum depression (more than the general population), and slow healing from the birthing process.

The Medical University of South Carolina discovered a gene variant common with hEDS patients.

====Genetics====

While 12 of the 13 subtypes of EDS have genetic variations that can be tested for by genetic testing, there is no known genetic cause of hEDS. Recently, several labs and research initiatives have been attempting to uncover a potential hEDS gene. In 2018, the Ehlers–Danlos Society began the Hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos Genetic Evaluation (HEDGE) study. The ongoing study has screened over 1,000 people who have been diagnosed with hEDS by the 2017 criteria to evaluate their genome for a common mutation. To date, 200 people with hEDS have had whole genome sequencing, and 500 have had whole exome sequencing; this study aims to increase those numbers significantly.

Promising outcomes of this increased screening have been reported by the Norris Lab, led by Russell Norris, in the Department of Regenerative Medicine and Cell Biology at Medical University of South Carolina. Using CRISPR Cas-9 mediated genome editing on mouse models of the disease, the lab has recently identified a &quot;very strong candidate gene&quot; for hEDS. This finding, and a greater understanding of cardiac complications associated with the majority of EDS subtypes, has led to the development of multiple druggable pathways involved in aortic and mitral valve diseases. While this candidate gene has not been publicly identified, the Norris lab has conducted several studies involving small population genome sequencing and come up with a working list of possible hEDS genes. A mutation in &quot;COL3A1&quot; in a single family with autosomal dominant hEDS phenotype was found to cause reduced collagen secretion and an over-modification of collagen. In 35 families, copy number alterations in &quot;TPSAB1&quot;, encoding alpha-tryptase, were associated with increased basal serum tryptase levels, associated with autonomic dysfunction, gastrointestinal disorders, allergic and cutaneous symptoms, and connective tissue abnormalities, all concurrent with hEDS phenotype. An unknown number of people diagnosed with hEDS may have a reduced Tenascin X,and/or mutations in the TNXB gene.

Another way the Norris lab is attempting to find this gene is by looking at genes involved in the formation of the aorta and mitral valves, as these valves are often prolapsed or malformed as a symptom of EDS. Because hEDS is such a complex, multi-organ disease, focusing on one hallmark trait has proven successful. One gene found this way is &quot;DZIP1&quot;, which regulates cardiac valve development in mammals through a CBY1-beta-catenin mechanism. Mutations at this gene affect the beta-catenin cascade involved in development, causing malformation of the extracellular matrix, resulting in loss of collagen. A lack of collagen here is consistent with hEDS and explains the &quot;floppy&quot; mitral and aortic valve heart defects. A second genetic study specific to mitral valve prolapse focused on the PDGF signaling pathway, which is involved in growth factor ligands and receptor isoforms. Mutations in this pathway affect the ability to localize cilia in various cell types, including cardiac cells. With the resulting ciliopathies, structures such as the cardiac outflow tract, heart tube assembly, and cardiac fusion are limited and/or damaged.

===Kyphoscoliosis===
Kyphoscoliosis EDS (kEDS; formerly categorized as type 6) is associated with severe hypotonia at birth, delayed motor development, progressive scoliosis (present from birth), and scleral fragility. People may also have easy bruising, fragile arteries that are prone to rupture, unusually small corneas, and osteopenia (low bone density). Other common features include a &quot;marfanoid habitus&quot; characterized by long, slender fingers (arachnodactyly), unusually long limbs, and a sunken chest (pectus excavatum) or protruding chest (pectus carinatum). It can be caused by variations in the gene &quot;PLOD1&quot;, or rarely, in the &quot;FKBP14&quot; gene.

===Musculocontractural===
Musculocontractural EDS (mcEDS) is characterized by congenital multiple contractures, characteristically adduction-flexion contractures and/or talipes equinovarus (clubfoot), characteristic craniofacial features, which are evident at birth or in early infancy, and skin features such as skin hyperextensibility, bruising, skin fragility with atrophic scars, and increased palmar wrinkling. It can be caused by variations in the &quot;CHST14&quot; gene. Some other cases can be caused by variations in the &quot;DSE&quot; gene.

As of 2021, 48 individuals have been reported to have mcEDS-CHST14, while 8 individuals have mcEDS-DSE.

===Myopathic===
Bethlem myopathy 2, formally known as Myopathic EDS (mEDS), is characterized by three major criteria: congenital muscle hypotonia and/or muscle atrophy that improves with age, proximal joint contractures of the knee, hip, and elbow, and hypermobility of distal joints (ankles, wrists, feet, and hands). Four minor criteria may also contribute to a diagnosis of mEDS. This disorder can be inherited through either an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive pattern. Molecular testing must be completed to verify that mutations in the &quot;COL12A1&quot; gene are present; if not, other collagen-type myopathies should be considered.

===Periodontal===
Periodontal EDS (pEDS) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by four major criteria of severe and intractable periodontitis of early-onset (childhood or adolescence), lack of attached gingiva, pretibial plaques, and family history of a first-degree relative who meets clinical criteria. Eight minor criteria may also contribute to the diagnosis of pEDS. Molecular testing may reveal mutations in &quot;C1R&quot; or &quot;C1S&quot; genes affecting the C1r protein.

===Spondylodysplastic===
Spondylodysplastic EDS (spEDS) is characterized by short stature (progressive in childhood), muscle hypotonia (ranging from severe congenital to mild later-onset), and bowing of limbs. It can be caused by variations in both copies of the &quot;B4GALT7&quot; gene. Other cases can be caused by variations in the &quot;B3GALT6&quot; gene. People with variations in this gene can have kyphoscoliosis, tapered fingers, osteoporosis, aortic aneurysms, and problems with the lungs. Other cases can be caused by the &quot;SLC39A13&quot; gene. Those with variations in this gene have protuberant eyes, wrinkled palms of the hands, tapering fingers, and distal joint hypermobility.

===Vascular===
Vascular EDS (vEDS; formerly categorized as type 4) is identified by skin that is thin, translucent, extremely fragile, and bruises easily. It is also characterized by fragile blood vessels and organs that can easily rupture. Affected people are frequently short, and have thin scalp hair. It also has characteristic facial features, including large eyes, an undersized chin, sunken cheeks, a thin nose and lips, and ears without lobes. Joint hypermobility is present, but generally confined to the small joints (fingers, toes). Other common features include club foot, tendon and/or muscle rupture, acrogeria (premature aging of the skin of the hands and feet), early-onset varicose veins, pneumothorax (collapse of a lung), the recession of the gums, and a decreased amount of fat under the skin. It can be caused by the variations in the &quot;COL3A1&quot; gene. Rarely, &quot;COL1A1&quot; variations can also cause it.

==Signs and symptoms==
This group of disorders affects connective tissues across the body, with symptoms most typically present in the joints, skin, and blood vessels. However, as connective tissue is found throughout the body, EDS may result in an array of unexpected impacts with any degree of severity, and the condition is not limited to joints, skin, and blood vessels. Effects may range from mildly loose joints to life-threatening cardiovascular complications. Due to the diversity of subtypes within the EDS family, symptoms may vary widely between individuals diagnosed with EDS.

=== Musculoskeletal ===
Musculoskeletal symptoms include hyperflexible joints that are unstable and prone to sprain, dislocation, subluxation, and hyperextension. As a result of frequent tissue injury, there can be an early onset of advanced osteoarthritis, chronic degenerative joint disease, swan-neck deformity of the fingers, and Boutonniere deformity of the fingers. Tendon and ligament laxity offer minuscule protection from tearing in muscles and tendons, but these problems still persist.

Deformities of the spine, such as scoliosis (curvature of the spine), kyphosis (a thoracic hump), tethered spinal cord syndrome, craniocervical instability (CCI), and atlantoaxial instability may also be present. Osteoporosis and osteopenia are also associated with EDS and symptomatic joint hypermobility

There can also be myalgia (muscle pain) and arthralgia (joint pain), which may be severe and disabling. Trendelenburg&#x27;s sign is often seen, which means that when standing on one leg, the pelvis drops on the other side. Osgood–Schlatter disease, a painful lump on the knee, is common as well. In infants, walking can be delayed (beyond 18 months of age), and bottom-shuffling instead of crawling occurs.

===Skin===
The weak connective tissue causes abnormal skin. This may present as stretchy or in other types simply be velvet soft. In all types, some increased fragility occurs, but the degree varies depending on the underlying subtype. The skin may tear and bruise easily, and may heal with abnormal atrophic scars; atrophic scars that look like cigarette paper are a sign seen including in those whose skin might appear otherwise normal. In some subtypes, though not the hypermobile subtype, redundant skin folds occur, especially on the eyelids. Redundant skin folds are areas of excess skin lying in folds.

Other skin symptoms include molluscoid pseudotumors, especially on pressure points, petechiae, subcutaneous spheroids, livedo reticularis; piezogenic papules are less common. In vascular EDS, skin can also be thin and translucent. In dermatosparaxis EDS, the skin is extremely fragile and saggy.
===Cardiovascular===
Although cardiovascular involvement depends significantly on the diagnosed subtype of EDS, a number of co-morbidities and symptoms are closely linked to the disorder as a whole. Some studies suggest that structural abnormalities are not the root cause of the vast majority of cardiac symptoms, but rather, dysautonomia is the primary culprit. Associated symptoms can include but are not limited to palpitations, near-syncope and syncope, heat intolerance, and difficulty managing blood pressure and heart rate. One study published in 2013 showed that patients with EDS were more likely to also be diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, more commonly known as POTS.

Weak connective tissues in the heart can cause problems with valve structure and function as well. Mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation and aortic root dilation are found more commonly in EDS patients and others with similar connective tissue disorders. In some cases, EDS manifests within the vasculature as well. Major artery aneurisms and dissections are sometimes seen as a result of faulty structural integrity.

* Thoracic outlet syndrome
* Arterial rupture
* Valvular heart disease, such as mitral valve prolapse, creates an increased risk for infective endocarditis during surgery. This may progress to a life-threatening degree. Heart conduction abnormalities have been found in those with hypermobility form of EDS.
* Dilation or rupture (aneurysm) of ascending aorta
* Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction such as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome
* Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon
* Varicose veins
* Heart murmur
* Heart conduction abnormalities

=== Urogynaecological ===
Weakened connective tissues can lead to pelvic organ prolapse in female patients with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. Patients may also experience voiding difficulties, frequent urinary tract infections, and incontinence due to structural abnormalities. Pelvic girdle pain is also frequently reported.

Menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia are common symptoms associated with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome and are often mistaken for endometriosis. Excessive menstrual bleeding can sometimes be attributed to inappropriate platelet aggregation, but faulty collagen leads to weakened capillary walls which increase the likelihood of hemorrhage.

In cases of pregnancy, patients with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome are more likely to experience complications during parturition. Post-partum hemorrhage and maternal injury such as sporadic pelvic displacement, hip dislocation, torn and stretched ligaments, and skin tearing can all be linked to altered structure of connective tissues.

=== Gastrointestinal ===
Research suggests a correlation between connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers–Danlos syndrome and both structural and functional problems within the gastrointestinal tract.

==== Inflammatory problems ====
High incidences of coexisting inflammatory disorders suggest a correlation between connective tissue disorders and the development of such aforementioned conditions. Inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn&#x27;s disease, ulcerative colitis and celiac disease are more common in EDS patients when compared to control groups. Of note, patients who are already diagnosed with an inflammatory bowel disorder are not necessarily likely to develop symptoms of a connective tissue disorder, as the two have separate but not totally confounding etiologies. Eosinophilic esophagitis, an inflammatory condition characterized by allergic-type reactions to various foods and chemicals and extensive esophageal remodeling, is eight times more likely in patients with connective tissue disorders when compared to patients without.

==== Functional problems ====
Functionally, small bowel dysmotility, delayed gastric emptying and delayed colonic transit are commonly related to EDS. These changes in transit speeds within the gastrointestinal system can cause a host of symptoms, including but not limited to abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, reflux symptoms, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea.

Some studies also suggest problems with the liver, which is in large part responsible for bilirubin conjugation. Although research in this area is sparse, patients with joint hypermobility were found to have higher rates of indirect hyperbilirubinemia than control groups.

==== Structural problems ====
Structurally, changes within the musculature in the intestine such as increased elastin, can lead to increased frequency of herniation. Laxity of the phreno-esophageal and gastro-hepatic ligaments can lead to hiatal hernia, which in turn can lead to commonly reported symptoms such as acid reflux, abdominal pain, early satiety, and bloating. Internal organ prolapses and intestinal intussusceptions occur with greater frequency in patients with weakened connective tissues.

==== Autonomic problems ====
Although neurogastroenterological manifestations in connective tissue disorders are common, their root cause is not yet known. Splanchnic circulation, small fiber neuropathy and altered vascular compliance have all been named as potential contributors to gastrointestinal complaints, particularly for patients who have a known, comorbid autonomic condition.

=== Neurological ===
Chronic headaches are common in patients with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, whether related to dysautonomia, TMJ, muscle tension, or craniocervical instability. Craniocervical instability is caused by trauma(s) to the head and neck areas such as concussion and whiplash. Ligaments in the neck are unable to heal properly, so the neck structure cannot support the skull, which can then sink into the brain stem, blocking the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, which in turn causes autonomic dysfunction.

Arnold–Chiari malformation is also more frequently found in patients with EDS because of the instability at the juncture between skull and spine. This causes herniation of the posterior fossa below the foramen magnum. Increased pressure created by the malformation can lead to a flattened pituitary gland, hormone changes, sudden severe headaches, ataxia, and poor proprioception.

Ophthalmological manifestations include nearsightedness, retinal tearing and retinal detachment, keratoconus, blue sclera, dry eye, Sjogren&#x27;s syndrome, lens subluxation, angioid streaks, epicanthal folds, strabismus, corneal scarring, brittle cornea syndrome, cataracts, carotid-cavernous sinus fistulas, and macular degeneration.

Otological complications may also occur. Hearing loss is common, both conductive and sensorineural, and is most often bilateral. Otosclerosis and instability of the bones in the inner ear may also contribute to hearing loss.

=== Other manifestations ===
* Hiatal hernia
* Gastroesophageal reflux
* Poor gastrointestinal motility
* Dysautonomia
* Gorlin&#x27;s sign (touch tongue to nose)
* Anal prolapse
* Flat feet
* Tracheobronchomalacia / tracheal collapse
* Collapsed lung (spontaneous pneumothorax)
* Nerve disorders (carpal tunnel syndrome, acroparesthesia, neuropathy, including small fiber neuropathy)
* Insensitivity to local anesthetics
* Dental problems including gum disease and enamel hypoplasia
* Platelet aggregation failure (platelets do not clump together properly)
* Mast cell disorders (including mast cell activation syndrome and mastocytosis)
* Pregnancy complications: increased pain, mild to moderate peripartum bleeding, cervical insufficiency, uterine tearing, or premature rupture of membranes
* Hearing loss may occur in some types
* There is some evidence that EDS may be associated with greater than expected frequencies of neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other learning, communication and motor issues, including autism spectrum conditions and Tourette syndrome.

Because it is often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed in childhood, some instances of EDS have been mischaracterized as child abuse. The pain may also be misdiagnosed as a behavior disorder or Munchausen by proxy.

The pain associated with EDS ranges from mild to debilitating.

== Causes ==

Every type of EDS except the hypermobile type (which affects the vast majority of people with EDS) can be positively tied to specific genetic variation.

Variations in these genes can cause EDS:
* Collagen primary structure and collagen processing: &quot;ADAMTS2&quot;, &quot;COL1A1&quot;, &quot;COL1A2&quot;, &quot;COL3A1&quot;, &quot;COL5A1&quot;, &quot;COL5A2&quot;
* Collagen folding and collagen cross-linking: &quot;PLOD1&quot;, &quot;FKBP14&quot;
* Structure and function of myomatrix: &quot;TNXB&quot;, &quot;COL12A1&quot;
* Glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis: &quot;B4GALT7&quot;, &quot;B3GALT6&quot;, &quot;CHST14&quot;, &quot;DSE&quot;
* Complement pathway: &quot;C1R&quot;, &quot;C1S&quot;
* Intracellular processes: &quot;SLC39A13&quot;, &quot;ZNF469&quot;, &quot;PRDM5&quot;

Variations in these genes usually alter the structure, production, or processing of collagen or proteins that interact with collagen. Collagen provides structure and strength to connective tissue. A defect in collagen can weaken connective tissue in the skin, bones, blood vessels, and organs, resulting in the features of the disorder. Inheritance patterns depend on the specific syndrome.

Most forms of EDS are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means only one of the two copies of the gene in question must be altered to cause a disorder. A few are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene must be altered for a person to be affected. It can also be an individual (&quot;de novo&quot; or &quot;sporadic&quot;) variation. Sporadic variations occur without any inheritance.

== Diagnosis ==
A diagnosis can be made by an evaluation of medical history and clinical observation. The Beighton criteria are widely used to assess the degree of joint hypermobility. DNA and biochemical studies can help identify affected people. Diagnostic tests include collagen gene-variant testing, collagen typing via skin biopsy, echocardiogram, and lysyl hydroxylase or oxidase activity, but these tests are not able to confirm all cases, especially in instances of an unmapped variation, so clinical evaluation remains important. If multiple members of a family are affected, prenatal diagnosis may be possible using a DNA information technique known as a linkage study. Knowledge about EDS among all kinds of practitioners is poor. Research is ongoing to identify genetic markers for all types.

=== Diagnosing hEDS ===
Because no single gene has been identified as the sole cause of the most common type of EDS, hypermobile type, obtaining a diagnosis is often difficult. The 2017 diagnostic criteria are as follows:

* Criterion 1: Generalized joint hypermobility, as measured by the Beighton score
* Criterion 2: Minimum two of the following must be met:
** Symptoms that suggest a difference in connective tissue structure
*** Unusually soft or velvety skin 
*** Mild skin hyperextensibility 
*** Unexplained striae distensae or rubae at the back, groins, thighs, breasts, and/or abdomen in adolescents, men, or pre-pubertal women without a history of significant gain or loss of body fat or weight 
*** Bilateral piezogenic papules of the heel 
*** Recurrent or multiple abdominal hernia(s) 
*** Atrophic scarring involving at least two sites and without the formation of truly papyraceous and/or hemosideric scars as seen in classical EDS 
*** Pelvic floor, rectal, and/or uterine prolapse in children, men, or nulliparous women without a history of morbid obesity or other known predisposing medical condition 
*** Dental crowding and high or narrow palate 
*** Arachnodactyly
*** Arm span-to-height ratio ≥1.05 
*** Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) mild or greater based on strict echocardiographic criteria 
*** Aortic root dilatation with Z-score &gt;+2
** Positive family history
** Proof that these symptoms interfere with daily life
*** Musculoskeletal pain in two or more limbs, recurring daily for at least 3 months 
*** Chronic, widespread pain for ≥3 months 
*** Recurrent joint dislocations or frank joint instability, in the absence of trauma
* Criterion 3: Exclusion of all other possible connective tissue disorders that may be the root cause of symptoms.

In such cases where all criteria are met, a patient can be diagnosed with hEDS according to The International Consortium on Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes and Hypermobility Spectrum Disorders

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Several disorders share some characteristics with EDS. For example, in cutis laxa, the skin is loose, hanging, and wrinkled. In EDS, the skin can be pulled away from the body, but is elastic and returns to normal when let go. In Marfan syndrome, the joints are very mobile, and similar cardiovascular complications occur. People with a &quot;marfanoid&quot; appearance are often tall and thin with long arms and legs and &quot;spidery&quot; fingers while EDS phenotypes vary considerably. Certain subtypes of EDS may involve short stature, large eyes, and the appearance of a small mouth and chin, due to a small palate. The palate can have a high arch, causing dental crowding. Blood vessels can sometimes be easily seen through translucent skin, especially on the chest. The genetic connective tissue disorder Loeys–Dietz syndrome also has symptoms that overlap with EDS.

In the past, Menkes disease, a copper metabolism disorder, was thought to be a form of EDS. People are commonly misdiagnosed with fibromyalgia, bleeding disorders, or other disorders that can mimic EDS symptoms. Because of these similar disorders and complications that can arise from an unmonitored case of EDS, a correct diagnosis is important. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is worth consideration in diagnosis.

== Management ==
No cure for Ehlers–Danlos syndrome is known, and treatment is supportive. Close monitoring of the cardiovascular system, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and orthopedic instruments (e.g., wheelchairs, bracing, casting) may be helpful. This can help stabilize the joints and prevent injury. Orthopedic instruments are helpful for the prevention of further joint damage, especially for long distances. People should avoid activities that cause the joint to lock or overextend.

A physician may prescribe casting to stabilize joints. Physicians may refer a person to an orthotist for orthotic treatment (bracing). Physicians may also consult a physical and/or occupational therapist to help strengthen muscles and teach people how to properly use and preserve their joints.

Aquatic therapy promotes muscular development and coordination. With manual therapy, the joint is gently mobilized within the range of motion and/or manipulations. If conservative therapy is not helpful, surgical joint repair may be necessary. Medication to decrease pain or manage cardiac, digestive, or other related conditions may be prescribed. To decrease bruising and improve wound healing, some people have responded to vitamin C. Medical care workers often take special precautions because of the sheer number of complications that tend to arise in people with EDS. In vascular EDS, signs of chest or abdominal pain are considered trauma situations.

Cannabinoids and medical marijuana have shown some efficacy in reducing pain levels.

In general, medical intervention is limited to symptomatic therapy. Before pregnancy, people with EDS may be recommended to have genetic counseling and to familiarize themselves with the risks pregnancy poses. Children with EDS should be given information about the disorder so they can understand why they should avoid contact sports and other physically stressful activities. Children should be taught that they should not demonstrate the unusual positions they can maintain due to loose joints, as this may cause early degeneration of the joints. Emotional support along with behavioral and psychological therapy can be useful. Support groups can be immensely helpful for people dealing with major lifestyle changes and poor health. Family members, teachers, and friends should be informed about EDS so they can accept and assist the child.

=== Pain management ===
Successful treatment of chronic pain in EDS requires a multidisciplinary team. The ways to manage pain can be to modify pain management techniques used in the normal population. Pain is classified into several types. One is nociceptive, which is caused by an injury sustained to tissues. Another is neuropathic pain, caused by abnormal signals by the nervous system. In many cases, the pain individuals experience is an unequal mix of the two. Physiotherapy (exercise rehabilitation) can be helpful, especially in stabilizing the core and the joints. Stretching exercises must be reduced to slow and gentle stretching to reduce the risks of dislocations or subluxations. Usable methods may include posture reeducation, muscle release, joint mobilization, trunk stabilization, and manual therapy for overworked muscles. Cognitive behavioural therapy is used in many chronic pain patients, especially those who have severe, chronic, life-controlling pain that is unresponsive to treatment. It has not been checked for efficiency in clinical trials. The state of pain management with EDS is considered insufficient.

==== Medications ====
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help if the pain is caused by inflammation. However, long-term use of NSAIDs is often a risk factor for gastrointestinal, renal, and blood-related side effects. It can worsen symptoms of mast cell activation syndrome, a disease that may be associated with EDS. Acetaminophen can be used to avoid the bleeding-related side effects of NSAIDs.

Lidocaine can be applied topically after subluxations and painful gums. It can also be injected into painful areas in the case of musculoskeletal pain.

If the pain is neuropathic in origin, tricyclic antidepressants in low doses, anticonvulsants, and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors can be used.

====Dislocation and subluxation management====
When a dislocation or subluxation does occur, muscle spasms and stress tend to occur, increasing pain and reducing the chances of the dislocation/subluxation naturally relieving. Methods to support a joint after such an incident include the usage of a sling to hold the joint in place and allow it to relax. Orthopedic casts are not advised as there could be pain if unrelaxed muscles are still trying to spasm out against the cast. Other solutions to promote relaxation are heat, gentle massaging, and mental distractions.

=== Surgery ===
The instability of joints, leading to subluxations and joint pain, often requires surgical intervention in people with EDS. Instability of almost all joints can happen, but appears most often in the lower and upper extremities, with the wrist, fingers, shoulder, knee, hip, and ankle being most common.

Common surgical procedures are joint debridement, tendon replacements, capsulorrhaphy, and arthroplasty. Aortic dissection and other such complications of vascular EDS will mandate surgical intervention. After surgery, the degree of stabilization, pain reduction, and people&#x27;s satisfaction can improve, but surgery does not guarantee an optimal result; affected people and surgeons report being dissatisfied with the results. The consensus is that conservative treatment is more effective than surgery, particularly since people have extra risks of surgical complications due to the disease. Three basic surgical problems arise due to EDS – the strength of the tissues is decreased, which makes the tissue less suitable for surgery; the fragility of the blood vessels can cause problems during surgery; and wound healing is often delayed or incomplete. If considering surgical intervention, seeking care from a surgeon with extensive knowledge and experience in treating people with EDS and joint hypermobility issues would be prudent.

Local anesthetics, arterial catheters, and central venous catheters cause a higher risk of bruise formation in people with EDS. Some people with EDS also show a resistance to local anaesthetics. Resistance to lidocaine and bupivacaine is not uncommon, and mepivacaine tends to work better in people with EDS. Special recommendations for anesthesia are given for people with EDS. Detailed recommendations for anesthesia and perioperative care of people with EDS should be used to improve safety.

Surgery in people with EDS requires careful tissue handling and a longer immobilization afterward.

== Prognosis ==
The outcome for individuals with EDS depends on the specific type of EDS they have. Symptoms vary in severity, even in the same disorder, and the frequency of complications varies. Some people have negligible symptoms, while others are severely restricted in daily life. Extreme joint instability, chronic musculoskeletal pain, degenerative joint disease, frequent injuries, and spinal deformities may limit mobility. Severe spinal deformities may affect breathing. In the case of extreme joint instability, dislocations may result from simple tasks such as rolling over in bed or turning a doorknob. Secondary conditions such as autonomic dysfunction or cardiovascular problems, occurring in any type, can affect prognosis and quality of life. Severe mobility-related disability is seen more often in hEDS than in classical EDS or vascular EDS.

Although all types of EDS are potentially life-threatening, most people have a normal lifespan. Those with blood vessel fragility, though, have a high risk of fatal complications, including spontaneous arterial rupture, which is the most common cause of sudden death. The median life expectancy in the population with vascular EDS is 48 years.

=== Complications ===
==== Vascular ====
* Pseudoaneurysm
* Vascular lesions (nature is disputed) due to tears in the lining of the arteries or deterioration of congenitally thin and fragile tissue
* Enlarged arteries

==== Gastrointestinal ====
* A 50% risk of colonic perforation exists in vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.

==== Obstetric ====
* Pregnancy increases the likelihood of uterine rupture.
* Maternal mortality is around 12% for the vascular type.
* Uterine hemorrhage can occur during the postpartum recovery.

== Epidemiology ==
Ehlers–Danlos syndromes are estimated to occur in about one in 5,000 births worldwide. Initially, prevalence estimates ranged from one in 250,000 to 500,000 people, but these were soon found to be low, as medical professionals became more adept at diagnosis. EDS may be far more common than the currently accepted estimate due to the wide range of severities with which the disorder presents.

The prevalence of the disorders differs dramatically. The most common is hypermobile EDS, followed by classical EDS. The others are very rare. For example, fewer than 10 infants and children with dermatosparaxis EDS have been described worldwide.

Some types of EDS are more common in Ashkenazi Jews. For example, the chance of being a carrier for dermatosparaxis EDS is one in 2,000 in the general population but one in 248 among Ashkenazi Jews.

Some recent studies have found that EDS is significantly more prevalent in people who identify as transgender or gender-diverse, or who suffer from gender dysphoria. One review, of a pediatric EDS clinic in the American Midwest between 2020 and 2022, found that 17% of patients identified as trans or gender-diverse, 89% of whom were assigned female at birth. By comparison, roughly 1-2% of adolescents identify as trans or gender-diverse in the US overall. Meanwhile, a 2020 analysis found that among adults undergoing gender-affirming surgery, 2.6% had a diagnosis of EDS—130 times the highest reported prevalence of EDS in the general population.

== History ==
Until 1997, the classification system for EDS included ten specific types and acknowledged that other rarer types existed. At this time, the classification system underwent an overhaul and was reduced to six major types using descriptive titles. Genetic specialists recognize that other types of this condition exist but have only been documented in single families. Except for hypermobility (type 3), the most common type of all ten types, some of the specific variations involved have been identified, and they can be precisely identified by genetic testing; this is valuable due to a great deal of variation in individual cases. Negative genetic test results do not rule out the diagnosis since not all variations have been discovered; therefore, the clinical presentation is crucial.

Forms of EDS in this category may present with soft, mildly stretchable skin, shortened bones, chronic diarrhea, joint hypermobility and dislocation, bladder rupture, or poor wound healing. Inheritance patterns in this group include X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive. Examples of types of related syndromes other than those above reported in the medical literature include:
* : type 5
* : type 8 – unspecified gene, locus 12p13
* : type 10 – unspecified gene, locus 2q34
* : Beasley–Cohen type
* : progeroid form – &quot;B4GALT7&quot;
* : type unspecified
* : &quot;D4ST1&quot;-deficient Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (adducted thumb-clubfoot syndrome) &quot;CHST14&quot;

== Society and culture ==

EDS may have contributed to the virtuoso violinist Niccolò Paganini&#x27;s skill, as he was able to play wider fingerings than a typical violinist.

Many sideshow performers have EDS. Several of them were billed as the Elastic Skin Man, the India Rubber Man, and Frog Boy. They included such well-known individuals (in their time) as Felix Wehrle, James Morris, and Avery Childs. Two performers with EDS currently hold world records. Contortionist Daniel Browning Smith has hypermobile EDS and holds the current Guinness World Record for the most flexible man as of 2018, while Gary &quot;Stretch&quot; Turner, sideshow performer in the Circus Of Horrors, has held the current Guinness World Record for the most elastic skin since 1999, for his ability to stretch the skin on his stomach 6.25 inches.

=== Notable cases ===

* Actress Cherylee Houston has hypermobile EDS. She uses a wheelchair and was the first full-time disabled actress on &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.
* Drag queen and winner of the 11th season of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; Yvie Oddly
* Eric the Actor, a regular caller to &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;
* Actress and activist Jameela Jamil
* Writer and actress Lena Dunham
* Australian singer Sia
* Singer Halsey
* YouTuber and disability rights activist Annie Elainey
* Miss America 2020 Camille Schrier
* Baroque flautist, musicologist and broadcast classical music presenter Hannah French
* Deaf singer/songwriter Mandy Harvey
* YouTuber and disability rights activist Jessica Kellgren-Fozard
* Singer-songwriter, author and artist Martha Marlow
* Pornographic actor and writer Lorelei Lee
* Reality show contestant Trevor Jones, dead from the vascular form of the disorder
* Scrunchie creator Rommy Hunt Revson, dead from a ruptured aorta
* Japanese voice actress and singer Tomori Kusunoki

===Representation in media===
====Literature====
The fantasy novel &quot;Fourth Wing&quot; by Rebecca Yarros presents a main character, Violet Sorrengail, who has an unnamed chronic condition that aligns closely with EDS symptoms. When asked about this connection Rebecca Yarros agrees with the connection but says EDS goes unnamed due to the level of medical knowledge present in her story&#x27;s world. Yarros has EDS and included it as a representation of her condition.

====Television====
&quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, a long-running TV series, approached the topic of EDS in their 13th season. In the episode &quot;Falling Slowly&quot;, the show&#x27;s doctors are confronted with confusion when met with diagnosing a patient. Due to complex and contradicting symptoms presented by the patient, the show&#x27;s doctors ultimately give the diagnosis of EDS. This episode was based on conversations held by producers who talked with a patient and doctor who have EDS.

== Other species ==
Ehlers–Danlos–like syndromes are hereditary in Himalayan cats, some domestic shorthair cats, and certain breeds of cattle. It is seen as a sporadic condition in domestic dogs, with higher frequency in English Springers. It has a similar treatment and prognosis. Animals with the condition should not be bred, as the condition can be inherited.

Degenerative suspensory ligament desmitis is a similar condition seen in many breeds of horses. It was originally notated in the Peruvian Paso and thought to be a condition of overwork and older age, but it is being recognized in all age groups and all activity levels. It has been noted in newborn foals.

<doc id="156671" wikidata="Q1850533" url="?curid=156671" title="List of presidents of Portugal">
<text>The complete list of presidents of the Portuguese Republic consists of the 20 heads of state in the history of Portugal since the 5 October 1910 revolution that installed a republican regime. 

This list includes not only those persons who were sworn into office as President of Portugal but also those who &quot;de facto&quot; served as head of state since 1910. This is the case of Teófilo Braga who served as President of the Provisional Government after the republican &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. Also Sidónio Pais, Mendes Cabeçadas, Gomes da Costa, as well as Canto e Castro and Óscar Carmona in their early months, were not sworn into office as presidents of the Republic, usually being prime ministers, but &quot;de facto&quot; accumulated this function, thus combining in practice head of state and head of government in one person. 

See the notes for more information.

==Election terms==
The numbering reflects the uninterrupted terms in office served by a single man. For example, Jorge Sampaio served two consecutive terms and is counted as the 19th president (not the 19th and 20th). Teófilo Braga served as the first and sole president of the Provisional Government, and therefore is not considered to be the first president, although he would serve again as head of state and be the second president after the resignation of Manuel de Arriaga. 

However, Bernardino Machado served two non-consecutive terms, and he is counted as both the third and the eighth presidents. Because of this, the list below contains 20 presidencies, but only 19 presidents.

Under the Constitution of Portugal adopted in 1976, in the wake of the 1974 Carnation Revolution, the president is elected to a five-year term with the possibility of running for a second consecutive term; there is no limit to the number of terms a president may serve, but a president who serves two consecutive terms may not serve again in the next five years after the second term finishes.

The official residence of the president of Portugal is the Belém Palace.

The current president of the Portuguese Republic is Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, the winner of the 2016 presidential election and re-elected in the 2021 presidential election.

<doc id="156674" wikidata="Q315509" url="?curid=156674" title="Philip Sidney">
<text>Sir Philip Sidney (30 November 1554 – 17 October 1586) was an English poet, courtier, scholar and soldier who is remembered as one of the most prominent figures of the Elizabethan age. 

His works include a sonnet sequence, &quot;Astrophil and Stella&quot;, a treatise, &quot;The Defence of Poesy&quot; (also known as &quot;The Defence of Poesie&quot; or &quot;An Apology for Poetrie&quot;) and a pastoral romance, &quot;The Countess of Pembroke&#x27;s Arcadia&quot;. He died fighting the Spanish in the Netherlands, age 31, and his funeral procession in London was one of the most lavish ever seen.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born at Penshurst Place, Kent, of an aristocratic family, he was educated at Shrewsbury School and Christ Church, Oxford. He was the eldest son of Sir Henry Sidney and Lady Mary Dudley. His mother was the eldest daughter of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, and the sister of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester.
His sister, Mary, was a writer, translator and literary patron, and married Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke. Sidney dedicated his longest work, the &quot;Arcadia&quot;, to her. After her brother&#x27;s death, Mary reworked the &quot;Arcadia&quot;, which became known as &quot;The Countess of Pembroke&#x27;s Arcadia&quot;.
His brother Robert Sidney was a statesman and patron of the arts, and was created Earl of Leicester in 1618.

===Politics and marriage===
In 1572, at the age of 18, he travelled to France as part of the embassy to negotiate a marriage between Elizabeth I and the Duc D&#x27;Alençon. He spent the next several years in mainland Europe, moving through Germany, Italy, Poland, the Kingdom of Hungary and Austria. On these travels, he met a number of prominent European intellectuals and politicians.

Returning to England in 1575, Sidney met Penelope Devereux (who would later marry Robert Rich, 1st Earl of Warwick). Although much younger, she inspired his famous sonnet sequence of the 1580s, &quot;Astrophel and Stella.&quot; Her father, Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex, was said to have planned to marry his daughter to Sidney, but Walter died in 1576 and this did not occur. In England, Sidney occupied himself with politics and art. He defended his father&#x27;s administration of Ireland in a lengthy document.

More seriously, he quarrelled with Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, probably because of Sidney&#x27;s opposition to the French marriage of Elizabeth to the much younger Alençon, which de Vere championed. In the aftermath of this episode, Sidney challenged de Vere to a duel, which Elizabeth forbade. He then wrote a lengthy letter to the Queen detailing the foolishness of the French marriage. Characteristically, Elizabeth bristled at his presumption, and Sidney prudently retired from court.

During a 1577 diplomatic visit to Prague, Sidney secretly visited the exiled Jesuit priest Edmund Campion.
Sidney had returned to court by the middle of 1581. In the latter year he was elected to fill vacant seats in the Parliament of England for both Ludlow and Shrewsbury, choosing to sit for the latter, and in 1584 was MP for Kent. That same year Penelope Devereux was married, apparently against her will, to Lord Rich. Sidney was knighted in 1583. An early arrangement to marry Anne Cecil, daughter of Sir William Cecil and eventual wife of de Vere, had fallen through in 1571. In 1583, he married Frances, the 16-year-old daughter of Sir Francis Walsingham. In the same year, he made a visit to Oxford University with Giordano Bruno, the polymath known for his cosmological theories, who subsequently dedicated two books to Sidney.

In 1585 the couple had one daughter, Elizabeth, who later married Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland, in March 1599 and died without issue in 1612.

===Literary writings===
Like the best of the Elizabethans, Sidney was successful in more than one branch of literature, but none of his work was published during his lifetime. However, it circulated in manuscript. His finest achievement was a sequence of 108 love sonnets. These owe much to Petrarch and Pierre de Ronsard in tone and style, and place Sidney as the greatest Elizabethan sonneteer after Shakespeare. Written to his mistress, Lady Penelope Rich, though dedicated to his wife, they reveal true lyric emotion couched in a language delicately archaic. In form Sidney usually adopts the Petrarchan octave (ABBAABBA), with variations in the sestet that include the English final couplet. His artistic contacts were more peaceful and significant for his lasting fame. During his absence from court, he wrote &quot;Astrophel and Stella&quot; (1591) and the first draft of &quot;The Arcadia&quot; and &quot;The Defence of Poesy&quot;. Somewhat earlier, he had met Edmund Spenser, who dedicated &quot;The Shepheardes Calender&quot; to him. Other literary contacts included membership, along with his friends and fellow poets Fulke Greville, Edward Dyer, Edmund Spenser and Gabriel Harvey, of the (possibly fictitious) &quot;Areopagus&quot;, a humanist endeavour to classicise English verse. 

===Military activity===
Sidney played a brilliant part in the military/literary/courtly life common to the young nobles of the time. Both his family heritage and his personal experience (he was in Walsingham&#x27;s house in Paris during the Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre), confirmed him as a keenly militant Protestant. 

In the 1570s, he persuaded John Casimir to consider proposals for a united Protestant effort against the Catholic Church and Spain. In the winter of 1575-76 he fought in Ireland while his father was Lord Deputy there. In the early 1580s, he argued fruitlessly for an assault on Spain itself. Promoted General of Horse in 1583, his enthusiasm for the Protestant struggle was given free rein when he was appointed governor of Flushing in the Netherlands in 1585. Whilst in the Netherlands, he consistently urged boldness on his superior, his uncle the Earl of Leicester. He carried out a successful raid on Spanish forces near Axel in July 1586.

===Injury and death===

Later that year, he joined Sir John Norris in the Battle of Zutphen, fighting for the Protestant cause against the Spanish. During the battle, he was shot in the thigh and died of gangrene 26 days later, at the age of 31. One account says this death was avoidable and heroic. Sidney noticed that one of his men was not fully armoured. He took off his thigh armour on the grounds that it would be wrong to be better armored than his men. As he lay dying, Sidney composed a song to be sung by his deathbed. According to the story, while lying wounded he gave his water to another wounded soldier, saying, &quot;Thy necessity is yet greater than mine&quot;. This became possibly the most famous story about Sir Philip, intended to illustrate his noble and gallant character.
Sidney&#x27;s body was returned to London and interred in Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on 16 February 1587. The grave and monument were destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. A modern monument in the crypt lists his among the important graves lost.

Already during his own lifetime, but even more after his death, he had become for many English people the very epitome of a Castiglione courtier: learned and politic, but at the same time generous, brave, and impulsive. The funeral procession was one of the most elaborate ever staged, so much so that his father-in-law, Francis Walsingham, almost went bankrupt. As Sidney was a brother of the Worshipful Company of Grocers, the procession included 120 of his company brethren.

Never more than a marginal figure in the politics of his time, he was memorialised as the flower of English manhood in Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;Astrophel&quot;, one of the greatest English Renaissance elegies.

An early biography of Sidney was written by his devoted friend and schoolfellow, Fulke Greville. While Sidney was traditionally depicted as a staunch and unwavering Protestant, recent biographers such as Katherine Duncan-Jones have suggested that his religious loyalties were more ambiguous. He was known to be friendly and sympathetic towards individual Catholics.

*&quot;Astrophil and Stella&quot; – The first of the famous English sonnet sequences, &quot;Astrophil and Stella&quot; was probably composed in the early 1580s. The sonnets were well-circulated in manuscript before the first (apparently pirated) edition was printed in 1591; only in 1598 did an authorised edition reach the press. The sequence was a watershed in English Renaissance poetry. In it, Sidney partially nativised the key features of his Italian model, Petrarch: variation of emotion from poem to poem, with the attendant sense of an ongoing, but partly obscure, narrative; the philosophical trappings; the musings on the act of poetic creation itself. His experiments with rhyme scheme were no less notable; they served to free the English sonnet from the strict rhyming requirements of the Italian form.
*&quot;The Countess of Pembroke&#x27;s Arcadia&quot; – The &quot;Arcadia&quot;, by far Sidney&#x27;s most ambitious work, was as significant in its own way as his sonnets. The work is a romance that combines pastoral elements with a mood derived from the Hellenistic model of Heliodorus. In the work, that is, a highly idealised version of the shepherd&#x27;s life adjoins (not always naturally) with stories of jousts, political treachery, kidnappings, battles, and rapes. As published in the sixteenth century, the narrative follows the Greek model: stories are nested within each other, and different storylines are intertwined. The work enjoyed great popularity for more than a century after its publication. William Shakespeare borrowed from it for the Gloucester subplot of &quot;King Lear&quot;; parts of it were also dramatised by John Day and James Shirley. According to a widely told story, King Charles I quoted lines from the book as he mounted the scaffold to be executed; Samuel Richardson named the heroine of his first novel &quot;Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded&quot; after Sidney&#x27;s Pamela. &quot;Arcadia&quot; exists in two significantly different versions. Sidney wrote an early version (the &quot;Old Arcadia&quot;) during a stay at Mary Herbert&#x27;s house; this version is narrated in a straightforward, sequential manner. Later, Sidney began to revise the work on a more ambitious plan, with much more backstory about the princes, and a much more complicated story-line, with many more characters. He completed most of the first three books, but the project was unfinished at the time of his death – the third book breaks off in the middle of a sword fight. There were several early editions of the book. Fulke Greville published the revised version alone, in 1590. The Countess of Pembroke, Sidney&#x27;s sister, published a version in 1593, which pasted the last two books of the first version onto the first three books of the revision. In the 1621 version, Sir William Alexander provided a bridge to bring the two stories back into agreement. It was known in this cobbled-together fashion until the discovery, in the early twentieth century, of the earlier version.
*&quot;An Apology for Poetry&quot; (also known as &quot;A Defence of Poesie&quot; and &quot;The Defence of Poetry&quot;) – Sidney wrote &quot;Defence of Poetry&quot; before 1583. It has taken its place among the great critical essays in English. It is generally believed that he was at least partly motivated by Stephen Gosson, a former playwright who dedicated his attack on the English stage, &quot;The School of Abuse&quot;, to Sidney in 1579, but Sidney primarily addresses more general objections to poetry, such as those of Plato. In his essay, Sidney integrates a number of classical and Italian precepts on fiction. The essence of his defence is that poetry, by combining the liveliness of history with the ethical focus of philosophy, is more effective than either history or philosophy in rousing its readers to virtue. The work also offers important comments on Edmund Spenser and the Elizabethan stage.
*&quot;The Sidney Psalms&quot; – These English translations of the Psalms were completed in 1599 by Philip Sidney&#x27;s sister Mary.

==In popular culture==
A memorial, erected in 1986 at the location in Zutphen where he was mortally wounded by the Spanish, can be found at the entrance of a footpath (&quot; &#x27;t Gallee&quot;) located in front of the petrol station at the Warnsveldseweg 170.

In Arnhem, in front of the house in the Bakkerstraat 68, an inscription on the ground reads: &quot;IN THIS HOUSE DIED ON THE 17 OCTOBER 1586 * SIR PHILIP SIDNEY * ENGLISH POET, DIPLOMAT AND SOLDIER, FROM HIS WOUNDS SUFFERED AT THE BATTLE OF ZUTPHEN. HE GAVE HIS LIFE FOR OUR FREEDOM&quot;. The inscription was unveiled on 17 October 2011, exactly 425 years after his death, in the presence of Philip Sidney, 2nd Viscount De L&#x27;Isle, a descendant of the brother of Philip Sidney.

The city of Sidney, Ohio, in the United States and a street in Zutphen, Netherlands, have been named after Sir Philip. A statue of him can be found in the park at the Coehoornsingel where, in the harsh winter of 1795, English and Hanoverian soldiers were buried who had died while retreating from advancing French troops.

Another statue of Sidney, by Arthur George Walker, forms the centrepiece of the Old Salopians Memorial at Shrewsbury School to alumni who died serving in World War I (unveiled 1924).

Philip Sidney appears as a young man in Elizabeth Goudge&#x27;s third novel, &quot;Towers in the Mist&quot; (Duckworth, 1937), visiting Oxford around the time Queen Elizabeth also visited Oxford. (Goudge admitted to slightly advancing the time of Sidney&#x27;s arrival in Oxford, for the sake of her larger story.)

In the &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; sketches &quot;Tudor Jobs Agency&quot;, &quot;Pornographic Bookshop&quot; and &quot;Elizabethan Pornography Smugglers&quot; (Season 3, episode 10), Superintendent Gaskell, a vice squad policeman, is transported back to the Elizabethan age and assumes Sir Philip Sidney&#x27;s identity.

An epitaph of Sir Philip Sidney: 
&quot;England has his body, for she it fed;
Netherlands his blood, in her defence shed;
The Heavens have his soul,
The Arts have his fame,
The soldier his grief,
The world his good name.&quot;

<doc id="156681" wikidata="Q175514" url="?curid=156681" title="King's X">
<text>King&#x27;s X is an American rock band formed in Springfield, Missouri, in 1979. They were first called the Edge and later became Sneak Preview before settling on their current name in 1985. The band&#x27;s current lineup has remained intact for more than four decades, consisting of vocalist and bassist Doug Pinnick, drummer Jerry Gaskill and guitarist Ty Tabor. Their music combines progressive metal, funk and soul with vocal arrangements influenced by gospel, blues, and British Invasion rock groups. Despite a largely underground reputation as the &quot;musician&#x27;s musicians&quot;, King&#x27;s X was pivotal in the early development of progressive metal, and produced a series of early records considered essential within the genre. The band&#x27;s lyrics are largely based on the members&#x27; struggles with religion and self-acceptance. King&#x27;s X was ranked No. 83 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;.

King&#x27;s X has released thirteen studio albums, two official live albums, and several independent releases. After signing to both Atlantic and Megaforce Records in 1987, they broke into the mainstream with their first six albums, including their only top 100 charting albums &quot;Faith Hope Love&quot; (1990) and &quot;Dogman&quot; (1994). The band&#x27;s most recent studio album, &quot;Three Sides of One&quot;, was released in 2022 on the InsideOut Music label. Since leaving Atlantic Records, following the release of &quot;Ear Candy&quot; in 1996, King&#x27;s X has released albums through Metal Blade Records, InsideOut Music and independently, respectively. Each member of the group has recorded several solo albums and has made numerous guest appearances on other artists&#x27; albums, as well as participated in numerous compilation projects. Pinnick and Tabor also have many albums released with side bands in which they participate.

The spiritual nature of the band&#x27;s lyrics, particularly on their first four albums, has often led to them being labeled a Christian rock band, a label that the members have rejected.

==History==
===Early years (1979–1984)===
The group traces its beginnings to 1979 in Springfield, Missouri, when bassist Doug Pinnick and drummer Jerry Gaskill were brought together to take part in a musical project coordinated by Greg X. Volz of the Christian rock band Petra. Within a month of Pinnick&#x27;s arrival from Illinois, the project folded and he and Gaskill were left without a band. They soon landed a job as rhythm section for guitarist Phil Keaggy&#x27;s live band. The two toured the country for several months in support of Keaggy&#x27;s album &quot;Ph&#x27;lip Side&quot;. During the group&#x27;s show in Springfield, Gaskill was approached by Ty Tabor who was a member of the opening band that night. The drummer for Tabor&#x27;s band had quit the night before the show and Tabor had volunteered to take over on drums for the gig. However, seeing as he had no drums, he was forced to ask Gaskill if he could borrow his kit for the show. Gaskill obliged and the show went on.

When the tour ended, Pinnick and Gaskill returned to Springfield and set about looking for more work. Gaskill landed a job doing demo work for the Tracy Zinn Band that happened to include Ty Tabor on guitar. The two became friends and were involved off and on together in different musical projects.

In early 1980, Pinnick attended a music show at Evangel College and watched a set by another of Tabor&#x27;s bands. Pinnick was impressed with Tabor&#x27;s skills and the two soon began collaborating musically.

Eventually Gaskill, Pinnick, and Tabor decided to pool their talents into a single outlet. Calling themselves the Edge, they initially were a four-piece with the inclusion of Dan McCollam on rhythm guitar. McCollam quit after only a brief time and was replaced by Kirk Henderson, who was a friend of Tabor&#x27;s from Jackson, Mississippi. The group performed extensively on the Springfield bar and club circuit specializing in classic rock and Top 40 covers at the time.

By 1983, Henderson had quit the band and Pinnick, Tabor, and Gaskill decided to continue on as a trio. They also decided to change the name of the band, and settled on calling themselves Sneak Preview.

The group had been writing and recording many original songs up to this point. They chose ten of these songs to record for an independently released self-titled album in 1983. After the album&#x27;s release, the band continued to tour and hone their songwriting skills.

===Move to Houston (1985–1987)===
By 1985, the group had made connections at Star Song Records based in Houston, Texas and were encouraged to move the band there. The first order of business for the three was to become part of a touring band for CCM artist Morgan Cryar. Tabor and Pinnick are also credited for co-writing several songs on Cryar&#x27;s second album &quot;Fuel on the Fire&quot; in 1986. Tabor also performed some guitar parts on the album and both he and Pinnick are credited with background vocals.

However, when it came to signing Sneak Preview to a recording contract with Star Song, negotiations broke down and the deal came to a halt.

===Megaforce era (1988–1991)===
The group released its debut album as King&#x27;s X, &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;, in 1988. Despite being hailed by music critics, the album did not fare well commercially, peaking at No. 144 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts. The songs &quot;King&quot; and &quot;Shot of Love&quot; were released as singles, but failed to garner much attention. The album derives its name from the C. S. Lewis novel &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;. This appears to be the band&#x27;s first of multiple references to the British author. King&#x27;s X promoted &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; with its first major tour, playing with the likes of Cheap Trick, Blue Öyster Cult, Robert Plant and Hurricane, as well as Megaforce labelmates Anthrax, Testament, M.O.D., and Overkill.

In 1989, the band released &quot;Gretchen Goes to Nebraska&quot;. Considered by many fans to be their landmark album and most creative period, the album fared only slightly better from a commercial standpoint than &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;. The band played with a wide variety of acts while touring in support of it, including Anthrax, Suicidal Tendencies, M.O.D., Living Colour, Billy Squier and Blue Murder. The album contains many fan favorites such as &quot;Summerland&quot;, &quot;Mission&quot;, and &quot;The Burning Down&quot;. The song &quot;The Difference (In the Garden of St. Anne&#x27;s-on-the-Hill)&quot; appears to be another C.S. Lewis reference, this time to a scene in the book &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot;, third and final installment of the &quot;science-fiction&quot; trilogy begun by &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;. The song &quot;Pleiades&quot; is credited by Ty Tabor as being the genesis of the King&#x27;s X sound when he presented the demo to the other band members a few years earlier. Significantly, the song &quot;Over My Head&quot; received moderate airplay on MTV and radio.

The increase in exposure would prove beneficial when the band released their third album, &quot;Faith Hope Love&quot;, in late 1990. It was the group&#x27;s first album to crack the U.S. Top 100, with the help of the successful single &quot;It&#x27;s Love&quot;. Another track, the funk-rock &quot;We Were Born to Be Loved&quot;, enjoyed a long life on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; as a commercial bumper instrumental favorite of Paul Shaffer&#x27;s CBS Orchestra. King&#x27;s X was featured in the February 1991 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (RS598). Still, with major mainstream success continuously eluding them, King&#x27;s X began questioning Sam Taylor&#x27;s management vision for the group.

The band landed the opening slot for Iron Maiden in Europe on their &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot; tour in late 1990, and AC/DC on their &quot;Razors Edge&quot; tour in the U.S. and Europe for the first half of 1991. In the middle of that year, their song &quot;Junior&#x27;s Gone Wild&quot; appeared on the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot;.

===Atlantic era (1992–1997)===
The band was moved up to Megaforce&#x27;s parent label Atlantic Records for the release of their fourth album, &quot;King&#x27;s X&quot;, in early 1992. However, rising tensions with Taylor led the band to eschew the upbeat approach of previous albums and turn out a darker, more introspective effort. Unfortunately, despite critical praise, their new style did not translate well among the record-buying public, thus garnering fewer sales than &quot;Faith, Hope, Love&quot;. &quot;Black Flag&quot;, the album&#x27;s lone single, received only moderate airplay on MTV and radio. Not long after the release of &quot;King&#x27;s X&quot;, the band parted ways with Taylor. The details of the split were not made public, but it was believed to be rather bitter. Taylor would admit in 1996 that his company Wilde Silas MusicWorks was growing and, as a result, he was no longer giving King&#x27;s X, whom he considered &quot;the top dogs,&quot; the attention they deserved. In the aftermath, King&#x27;s X took over a year off to consider their collective future together. The band members followed other, non-musical pursuits; most notably, guitarist Ty Tabor took up semi-professional motocross motorcycle racing.

With grunge at the peak of its popularity, and Pearl Jam&#x27;s bassist Jeff Ament declaring that &quot;King&#x27;s X invented grunge&quot; (despite the group&#x27;s trademark sound being very different from that of the commercially successful grunge acts), the band went looking for a new sound upon their return. They enlisted veteran producer Brendan O&#x27;Brien, who had recently produced albums for Stone Temple Pilots and Pearl Jam. The resulting album, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Dogman&quot;, showcased a much more muscular and heavy sound from the group, with Pinnick now handling all lead vocals and the lyrics becoming less abstract and spiritual. The record received a heavier promotional push from Atlantic including a compilation promotional CD entitled: &quot;Building Blox&quot;, as King&#x27;s X enjoyed a successful tour, capped by an appearance at the Woodstock &#x27;94 festival in August. They also toured with bands such as the Scorpions, Pearl Jam, Mötley Crüe and Type O Negative, but despite a return to the Top 100 for King&#x27;s X, the album failed to sell as well as Atlantic had hoped, and the label&#x27;s support for the group quickly faded.

The band&#x27;s third release under Atlantic, 1996&#x27;s &quot;Ear Candy&quot;, would also be their last for the label (not including a subsequent &quot;Best of King&#x27;s X&quot; compilation). Although it sold to the band&#x27;s sizeable core following, it lacked the relative mainstream success of previous efforts. The record was soon out of print, and it seemed that the group&#x27;s chance for commercial success had come and gone.

===Metal Blade era (1998–2004)===
The group moved to Metal Blade Records in 1998. Their first album under the label, &quot;Tape Head&quot;, signaled a new era for the band. They modified their creative methods by writing and recording the album together in the studio, rather than coming together to record songs that the individual members had written separately. They also elected not to hire an outside producer and recorded the album at Pinnick&#x27;s Hound Pound and Tabor&#x27;s Alien Beans Studios, thus cutting production costs. Their next two albums, &quot;Please Come Home... Mr. Bulbous&quot; (2000) and &quot;Manic Moonlight&quot; (2001), were more or less created in the same way.

&quot;Manic Moonlight&quot; featured the band experimenting with electronic drum loops and other sounds for the first time on a record. The new direction, along with the relatively short length of the album, was generally not well received by longtime fans, but did get some positive critical reviews.

For their next album, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Black Like Sunday&quot;, the group arranged and recorded an album of original songs that the band had regularly performed during &quot;The Edge&quot; and &quot;Sneak Preview&quot; days of the early 1980s. The cover art for this album was selected from artwork submitted by fans in an online contest.

The double-disc set &quot;Live All Over the Place&quot; (2004) was the band&#x27;s final album for Metal Blade Records, and their first official live release.

===Inside Out era (2005–present)===

In 2005, King&#x27;s X signed to InsideOut Music, the label that had previously released some of Tabor&#x27;s side projects. The album &quot;Ogre Tones&quot; was released in September 2005 and was described by many as a return to a more &quot;classic&quot; King&#x27;s X sound. It was produced by famed rock producer Michael Wagener (Dokken, Extreme, Stryper, White Lion, Skid Row) and recorded at Wageners Wire-World Studios in Nashville, Tennessee. The tour for &quot;Ogre Tones&quot; featured the band playing every song from the album during shows.

King&#x27;s X again worked with Michael Wagener on its second album for InsideOut Music titled &quot;XV&quot;, released in May 2008. They spent mid-2008 touring with the band &quot;Extreme&quot; as part of a travelling version of the Rock &#x27;n Roll Fantasy Camp. Live dates in the U.S. in December 2008 were followed by the band&#x27;s first European tour in several years in early 2009.

Molken Music, an independent label started by Wally Farkas (ex- Galactic Cowboys) in 2005, has released several titles by King&#x27;s X and its members. &quot;Live &amp; Live Some More&quot;, a live concert recorded during the &quot;Dogman&quot; tour, is available there as well as demo compilations, rehearsal tapes, and other items. The label released the band&#x27;s first live DVD, &quot;Gretchen Goes to London&quot; in November 2008. It was a live concert filmed in London in 1990. On January 22, 2009, their concert at the Electric Ballroom in Camden, London, was filmed and released as a live DVD and CD entitled &quot;Live Love in London&quot;.

On February 26, 2012, the 55-year-old Jerry Gaskill suffered a major heart attack, temporarily stopping the band&#x27;s touring schedule. He was on a ventilator for several days while also suffering from pneumonia. In response, King&#x27;s X compiled an exclusive live release from their archives entitled &quot;Burning Down Boston: Live at The Channel 6.12.91&quot;. The proceeds from the release went directly to Gaskill to help him offset his medical expenses. Gaskill posted a video message on Facebook on April 4, 2012, thanking everyone who had supported him during his illness.

The band went back to touring until Gaskill suffered another heart attack while recovering from a &quot;scheduled minor procedure&quot; on September 12, 2014, requiring him to undergo double-bypass surgery. King&#x27;s X subsequently canceled all scheduled concerts, and announced an indefinite hiatus.

In mid-2015, the band was back on tour, playing numerous dates on the east coast. They also played shows for July in Texas. In June 2015, Doug Pinnick announced that King&#x27;s X were committed to begin work on a new studio album, their first since 2008&#x27;s &quot;XV&quot;. The band signed a world-wide record deal on October 8, 2018, with Australian independent record label, Golden Robot Records, who had planned to release their new album in the U.S, Australia and Europe sometime in 2019; however, the project&#x27;s release had faced myriad delays within the next few years, due to COVID-related manufacturing issues as well as the slow progress of the band working on the album, which had been mastered by April 2022. A month later, it was announced that King&#x27;s X had signed again to Inside Out/Sony Music and their new album would be released on September 2, 2022. The band revealed &quot;Three Sides of One&quot; as the album&#x27;s title on June 24, 2022; released on September 2 of that year, three singles were released to support &quot;Three Sides of One&quot;: &quot;Let It Rain&quot;, &quot;Give It Up&quot;, and &quot;All God&#x27;s Children&quot;.

Although Pinnick initially stated that &quot;Three Side of One&quot; could be King&#x27;s X&#x27;s final studio album, he mentioned in an August 2022 interview that there are numerous songs that did not make the cut and could be used for the band&#x27;s next album: &quot;Ty came in with four, Jerry came in with three, and I came in with 27.&quot; He added, &quot;We would play one of mine, one of Ty&#x27;s, and one of Jerry&#x27;s, then do another round. Ty wanted to keep going until they ran out. We needed more songs, so we played more of mine. We recorded ten of my songs, and only some of them got on the record. We knew some of those weren&#x27;t quite ready, and we had enough songs. Maybe we&#x27;ll put them on the next record. I still have about 30 songs. I know Ty and Jerry both have some more songs to use on the next record.&quot; In an October 2024 interview with Bravewords.com, Pinnick said that he has &quot;submitted a handful of new songs&quot; and &quot;Ty and Jerry have both said they have a bunch of tunes&quot; for the next King&#x27;s X album, adding, &quot;So, the next thing is to finally figure out when we want to get together and the whole thing you have to go through to make a record – because we live in three different parts of the country. So, sooner or later we&#x27;ll get serious. We haven&#x27;t yet really, but we talk about it – so that&#x27;s a good thing.&quot;

An authorized biography by Greg Prato, &quot;King&#x27;s X: The Oral History&quot;, via Jawbone Press was released in February 2019. In addition to extensive interviews with all three band members, the book included interviews with such rock musicians as Jeff Ament, Andy Summers, Mick Mars, Billy Corgan, and Eddie Trunk among others, and featured a foreword by Scott Ian.

==Legacy==
The band&#x27;s influence has been described as wide and diverse given &quot;the impossible-to-categorize&quot; nature of the genres and subgenres explored within King X&#x27;s material, with the American popular culture publication &quot;D Magazine&quot; remarking in 2013 that &quot;[t]heir fan base today is a mixture of prog-rock nerds and headbangers&quot; while labeling the group itself as both &quot;[f]ringe&quot; and &quot;[l]egends&quot;. The band has a particularly positive reputation among professional musicians. For instance, the performer Jeff Ament of groups such as Pearl Jam openly declared King&#x27;s X as the true inventor of &quot;grunge&quot;, as was mentioned above. In a retrospective interview with the news-magazine &quot;Billboard&quot;, Pinnick described an emotional, face-to-face moment with Dimebag Darrell, then of Pantera, in which the latter performer remarked &quot;[d]ude, you know I love you&quot; and &quot;we love you&quot; after the record industry controversy caused by Pinnick&#x27;s coming out. Gaskill has stated that &quot;I think I&#x27;ve come to realize that musicians do seem to be drawn to us,&quot; with him adding that he&#x27;s &quot;honored by it&quot; and thinks that &quot;it&#x27;ll keep us around, because there&#x27;s always going to be musicians.&quot; Other bands who have cited King&#x27;s X as an inspiration or influence include Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, The Smashing Pumpkins, Dream Theater, Skillet, Devin Townsend and Soil.

During multiple decades of touring, King&#x27;s X has performed with a number of prominent hard rock and heavy metal artists. Examples include past live efforts with opening slots for Sammy Hagar as well as a full touring bill with Krokus. They have also opened for bands like Cheap Trick, Iron Maiden, AC/DC, Scorpions, Pearl Jam and Mötley Crüe, and performed the first date of the Woodstock &#x27;94 festival.

==Solo and side projects==
The members of King&#x27;s X have been musically prolific since their release from Atlantic in 1997, releasing a number of solo albums and participating in side bands.

===Doug Pinnick===

Pinnick recorded two solo albums under the name of Poundhound, &quot;Massive Grooves...&quot; (1997) and &quot;Pineappleskunk&quot; (2001), while his subsequent releases &quot;Emotional Animal&quot; (2005), &quot;Strum Sum Up&quot; (2007) and &quot;Naked&quot; (2013) were credited as &quot;dUg Pinnick&quot;.

He has also been a member of several bands outside of King&#x27;s X:

* Supershine featuring guitarist Bruce Franklin and drummer Jeff Olson both from the band Trouble. They released one self-titled album in 2000.
* The Mob featuring Reb Beach from Winger, Kelly Keagy from Night Ranger, and keyboardist Timothy Drury. They released a self-titled album in 2006.
* Razr13 is a project with members of the King&#x27;s X road crew who released the album &quot;Reflections&quot; in 2009.
* Tres Mtns. with Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam and drummer Richard Stuverud released an album in 2011.

Pinnick has also made numerous guest appearances on albums by bands including Dream Theater, 24-7 Spyz, Steve Stevens, Metal Allegiance and others. Beyond that he has appeared on several tribute albums to the likes of Metallica, AC/DC, Van Halen and more.

In August 2006, Pinnick stood in for lead singer Corey Glover on Living Colour&#x27;s European tour.

===Jerry Gaskill===

Gaskill released a solo album in 2004 titled &quot;Come Somewhere&quot; which was produced by Ty Tabor.

He released his second solo album, &quot;Love and Scars&quot;, on October 30, 2015, which was produced by DA Karkos.

He also played drums on the entire &quot;Let It Go&quot; album by Galactic Cowboys in 2000.

===Ty Tabor===

Tabor has released seven solo albums to date: &quot;Naomi&#x27;s Solar Pumpkin&quot; (1997), &quot;Moonflower Lane&quot; (1998), &quot;Safety&quot; (2002), &quot;Rock Garden&quot; (2006), &quot;Balance&quot; (2008), &quot;Something&#x27;s Coming&quot; (2010), &quot;Trip Magnet EP&quot; (2010), &quot;Nobody Wins When Nobody Plays&quot; (2013), &quot;Alien Beans&quot; (2018), &quot;Angry Monk&quot; (2020), and &quot;Shades&quot; (2022).

Other bands Ty Tabor has been a member of are:

* Platypus, with Rod Morgenstein, Derek Sherinian, and John Myung, released &quot;When Pus Comes to Shove&quot; in 1998 and &quot;Ice Cycles&quot; in 2000.
* The Jelly Jam is an ongoing project with Rod Morgenstein and John Myung. They released &quot;The Jelly Jam&quot; in 2002, &quot;The Jelly Jam 2&quot; in 2004, &quot;Shall We Descend&quot; in 2011, and &quot;Profit&quot; in May 2016.
* Jughead featuring two-time David Lee Roth drummer Gregg Bissonette, keyboardist Derek Sherinian, and singer and bassist Matt Bissonette released one album in 2004.
* Xenuphobe is an electronic/ambient project with former Galactic Cowboys member Wally Farkas. So far the pair have released the albums &quot;1.0&quot; in 2006, &quot;2.0 Electrolux&quot; 2007, and &quot;Drone&quot; in 2015.

Like Doug Pinnick, Tabor has appeared on several albums as a guest performer by bands such as Ayreon, Lillian Axe, Queensrÿche and others.

==Religious views==
All three members of King&#x27;s X came from a background in Christianity and Christian rock (and, in Pinnick&#x27;s case, church gospel singing) and have frequently been associated with the genre. This assumption has been reinforced by the Christian associations of the band&#x27;s name, by the fact that King&#x27;s X signed to Christian labels early in their career and because the &quot;Faith Hope Love&quot; CD insert contained an entire chapter of the Bible. However, the band have persistently resisted being identified or pigeonholed as a Christian rock or Christian metal band.

While many of their early lyrics have a clear spiritual influence, this came from the individual faith of the members rather than an explicit attempt to tap into the contemporary Christian music market in the way groups such as Petra did. Initially, many King&#x27;s X albums were marketed through Christian book stores, but most of these stores refused to sell them following Pinnick&#x27;s 1998 announcement of his homosexuality. Even at the time, the band welcomed this development as an opportunity to get away from the Christian rock &quot;stigma&quot;.

A former Protestant, Pinnick has since openly discussed his agnosticism and his belief that Jesus Christ was not truly the Son of God. Gaskill has also disassociated himself from Christianity. During interviews in the early 2000s, Tabor continued to identify as a Christian, but referred to the Christian music industry as &quot;vile&quot;.

In an interview in late 2021, Pinnick stated &quot;For some reason, King&#x27;s X [was considered] a Christian band. Maybe because that was our faith at the time; none of us are any more.&quot;

<text>The Jacobethan ( ) architectural style, also known as Jacobean Revival, is the mixed national Renaissance revival style that was made popular in England from the late 1820s, which derived most of its inspiration and its repertory from the English Renaissance (1550–1625), with elements of Elizabethan and Jacobean. 
John Betjeman coined the term &quot;Jacobethan&quot; in 1933, and described it as follows:
The style in which the Gothic predominates may be called, inaccurately enough, Elizabethan, and the style in which the classical predominates over the Gothic, equally inaccurately, may be called Jacobean. To save the time of those who do not wish to distinguish between these periods of architectural uncertainty, I will henceforward use the term &quot;Jacobethan&quot;.

The term caught on with art historians. Timothy Mowl asserts in &quot;The Elizabethan and Jacobean Style&quot; (2001) that the Jacobethan style represents the last outpouring of an authentically native genius that was stifled by slavish adherence to European baroque taste.

==Style==

In architecture the style&#x27;s main characteristics are flattened, cusped &quot;Tudor&quot; arches, lighter stone trims around windows and doors, carved brick detailing, steep roof gables, often terra-cotta brickwork, balustrades and parapets, pillars supporting porches and high chimneys as in the Elizabethan style. Examples of this style are Harlaxton Manor in Lincolnshire (&quot;illustration&quot;), Mentmore Towers in Buckinghamshire and Sandringham House in Norfolk, England.

In June 1835, when the competition was announced for designs for new Houses of Parliament, the terms asked for designs either in the Gothic or the Elizabethan style. The seal was set on the Gothic Revival as a national style, even for the grandest projects on the largest scale; at the same time, the competition introduced the possibility of an &quot;Elizabethan&quot; revival. Of the ninety-seven designs submitted, six were in a self-described &quot;Elizabethan&quot; style.

In 1838, with the Gothic revival well under way in Britain, Joseph Nash, trained in A. W. N. Pugin&#x27;s office designing Gothic details, struck out on his own with a lithographed album &quot;Architecture of the Middle Ages: Drawn from Nature and on Stone&quot; in 1838. Casting about for a follow-up, Nash extended the range of antiquarian interests forward in time with his next series of lithographs &quot;The Mansions of England in the Olden Time&quot; 1839–1849, which accurately illustrated Tudor and Jacobean great houses, interiors as well as exteriors, made lively with furnishings and peopled by inhabitants in ruffs and farthingales, the quintessence of &quot;Merrie Olde England&quot;. A volume of text accompanied the fourth and last volume of plates in 1849, but it was Nash&#x27;s picturesque illustrations that popularised the style and created a demand for the variations on the English Renaissance styles that was the essence of the newly revived &quot;Jacobethan&quot; vocabulary.

Two young architects already providing Jacobethan buildings were James Pennethorne and Anthony Salvin, both later knighted. Salvin&#x27;s Jacobethan Harlaxton Manor, near Grantham, Lincolnshire, its first sections completed in 1837, is the great example that defines the style.
The &quot;Jacobethan&quot; Revival survived the late 19th century and became a part of the commercial builder&#x27;s repertory through the first 20 years of the 20th century. Apart from its origins in the United Kingdom, the style became popular both in Canada and throughout the United States during those periods, for sturdy &quot;baronial&quot; dwellings in a free Renaissance style. A key exponent of the style in Britain was T. G. Jackson. Some examples can also be found in buildings in the former British Empire, such as Rashtrapati Niwas, the former Viceregal Lodge at Shimla in India.

Excellent examples of the style in the United States are Coxe Hall, Williams Hall, and Medbury Hall, which define the West and North sides of the quadrangle of Hobart College in Geneva, NY.

<text>Dominick George &quot;Don&quot; Pardo Jr. (February 22, 1918 – August 18, 2014) was an American radio and television announcer whose career spanned more than seven decades.

A member of the Television Hall of Fame, Pardo was noted for his 70-year tenure with NBC, working as the announcer for early incarnations of such notable shows as &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, &quot;Jackpot&quot;, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, &quot;Three on a Match&quot;, &quot;Winning Streak&quot; and &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;. His longest, and best-known, announcing job was for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, a job he held for 38 seasons, from the show&#x27;s debut in 1975 til the end of the 6th season in 1981 and again from the season 8 premiere in 1982 until his death in 2014.

==Early and personal life==
Pardo was born in Westfield, Massachusetts, to Dominick George Pardo Sr. and Valeria &quot;Viola&quot; Rominak-Pardo, who were Polish immigrants who owned a bakery. He spent his childhood in Norwich, Connecticut, and Providence, Rhode Island, and graduated from Emerson College in 1942. Pardo was married to Catherine Lyons from 1938 until her death in 1995 and had five children: Donna, Karen, Paula, David and Michael.

==Career==
===Radio===
Pardo was hired for his first radio position at NBC affiliate WJAR in Providence in 1938.

He joined NBC full-time as an in-house announcer in 1944, remaining on the network staff for 60 years. The radio programs on which he worked as an announcer include &quot;Barrie Craig, Confidential Investigator&quot;, the sci-fi shows &quot;X Minus One&quot; and &quot;Dimension X&quot;.

During World War II, Pardo worked as a war reporter for NBC Radio.

For most of 30 years, Pardo&#x27;s recorded voice was one of the announcer introduction inserts for &quot;Ten at Ten&quot;, the KFOG San Francisco radio show appearing at 10 a.m., and in syndication with Dave Morey on KFOG HD Radio, although a few years featured Monty Hall and Larry &quot;Bud&quot; Melman.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate/14419139&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
In the early 1950s, he served as announcer for many of RCA&#x27;s and NBC&#x27;s closed-circuit color television demonstrations.

Pardo made his mark on game shows for NBC in 1952 as the announcer on &quot;Winner Take All&quot;, and as the voice of the original &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; from 1956 until it moved to ABC in 1963. Pardo&#x27;s next show was &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, which he announced from 1964 until the original version of the series ended in 1975. Pardo also announced New York-based NBC game shows such as &quot;Three on a Match&quot;, &quot;Winning Streak&quot;, and &quot;Jackpot!&quot;, all three of which were Bob Stewart productions.

Pardo squeezed in many other assignments at NBC, including the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade (until 1999), WNBC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Live at Five&quot; and &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;.

Pardo was the on-duty live booth announcer for WNBC-TV in New York and the NBC network on November 22, 1963, and he was the first to announce to NBC viewers that President John F. Kennedy had been shot in Dallas, Texas.

His best-known announcing work was for the television series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. His was the fourth voice heard on the show&#x27;s premiere episode in 1975, after the first cold open sketch featuring Michael O&#x27;Donoghue, John Belushi and Chevy Chase. Pardo remained the program&#x27;s announcer except for one season (1981–1982), when it was announced by Mel Brandt or Bill Hanrahan. After &quot;Live from New York, it&#x27;s Saturday Night!&quot;, which is cried out at the end of the cold open, Pardo announces the show&#x27;s title, then names the cast members and musical guests in a voice-over during the opening montage. According to Pardo, his &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; announcing booth during his tenure at Studio 8-H was almost exactly where Arturo Toscanini stood when conducting the NBC Symphony Orchestra in Rockefeller Center from 1937 to 1950.

In December 1976, Pardo participated in a musical performance by Frank Zappa, reciting a verse of the song &quot;I&#x27;m the Slime&quot;. Pardo reprised this role on the live-recorded version of the song for the &quot;Zappa in New York&quot; album (it was not featured on the first release in 1978, but it appears on the 1993 CD re-release). He also provided narration for the songs &quot;The Illinois Enema Bandit&quot; and &quot;Punky&#x27;s Whips&quot;. A business dispute between Zappa and his record company of the time led to &quot;Punky&#x27;s Whips&quot; being removed from the 1978 album, but the song was reinstated on the 1993 CD.

Pardo appeared in the &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic song &quot;I Lost on Jeopardy&quot;, from his second album, &quot;&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic in 3-D&quot;, a parody of &quot;Jeopardy&quot; by The Greg Kihn Band, and its refrain &quot;Our love&#x27;s in jeopardy.&quot; The song became the fourth music video released by Yankovic, and featured a number of cameo appearances including Kihn, original &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; host Art Fleming, Yankovic&#x27;s mentor Dr. Demento, Pardo, and Yankovic&#x27;s parents. 

In 2009, he appeared in an episode of &quot;30 Rock&quot; (&quot;Cutbacks&quot;) as Sid, TGS&#x27;s announcer.

==Last years==
Pardo nominally retired from NBC in 2004. However, he continued to announce for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; at the behest of executive producer Lorne Michaels, initially under the assumption that a permanent replacement would be found quickly. In 2006, he began pre-recording his announcements from a studio in his Arizona home. That arrangement lasted only a few episodes before producers insisted that they needed him in Studio 8H, and he resumed weekly flights to New York. On Saturday, February 23, 2008, Pardo appeared at the closing of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; to blow out the candles on his 90th birthday cake. During this period, Pardo missed about five episodes due to illness; cast member Darrell Hammond (who would succeed Pardo after his death) filled in for him but was uncredited.

Upon his induction into the Rhode Island Radio Hall of Fame on May 14, 2009, Pardo suggested that the May 16, 2009, episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; would be his last. However, he subsequently returned for the show&#x27;s 35th season. Starting with the 36th season, Pardo once again began pre-recording his parts from his home in Arizona instead of performing live in New York City.

In 2010, Pardo was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.

Pardo died in his sleep on August 18, 2014, in Tucson, Arizona, at the age of 96.

<text>Dalgety Bay () is a coastal town and parish in Fife, Scotland, on the north shore of the Firth of Forth, 9 miles from Edinburgh city centre. The civil parish is the 8th largest in Fife with a population of 10,777 (2011)

Dalgety bay was named after the original village of Dalgety, evident by the ruins of the 12th century St Bridget&#x27;s Kirk. The root of the place-name Dalgety is the Scottish Gaelic word &quot;dealg&quot;, &#x27;thorn&#x27;, and the full name originally meant &#x27;the place of the thorn[-bushes]&#x27;. The new town, of which building started in 1965, takes its name from the main bay it adjoins, but the town stretches over many bays and coves including Donibristle Bay and St David&#x27;s Bay.

Dalgety Bay is a commuter town and around 30% of the towns&#x27; workers work in Edinburgh. While the architecture of the town reflects construction by volume housebuilders, the town is a regular winner of the Best Kept Small Town title. Dalgety Bay contains 9 Listed Buildings or structures by Historic Scotland, and features on the Fife Coastal Path.

== History ==
Dalgety Bay began as the village of Dalgety, which was built on the site of the 12th century St Bridget&#x27;s Kirk.The land surrounding the town was part of the estate owned by the Earls of Moray who built Donibristle House as their residence. In 1592 James Stewart, 2nd Earl of Moray was murdered on the seashore near Donibristle by his rival George Gordon, Earl of Huntly, which is remembered in the popular ballad The Bonnie Earl O&#x27; Moray. 

Towards the end of the 18th century, the village was destroyed by order of the Earls of Moray. and the inhabitants dispersed. During the First World War Morton Gray Stuart, 17th Earl of Moray donated a portion of his land to the Crown, which built an airfield there in 1917 as a base for the Royal Naval Air Service. The town also sent 30 men into the First World War, with only eight returning unharmed. The Royal Naval Air Service improved and expanded the aerodrome during the Second World War as HMS &quot;Merlin&quot;, an air station, and constructed an extensive aircraft maintenance facility there.

Construction of the modern town of Dalgety Bay as Scotland&#x27;s first &quot;enterprise town&quot; began around 1965 on the site of RNAS Donibristle and much of the remaining ground of the Earls of Moray family seat, Donibristle House. The town stretches across several bays and coves of the northern coast of the Firth of Forth including Donibristle Bay and St David&#x27;s Bay.

==Education==
There are two primary schools in Dalgety Bay: Dalgety Bay Primary School and Donibristle Primary School. Dalgety Bay sits within the catchment area for Inverkeithing High School.

==Radioactive objects==
A series of radioactive objects have been found on the shoreline of Dalgety Bay since the 1990s. The objects come from an eroded landfill that contains debris from Second World War aircraft that originally had radium dials. One found in 2011 measured 10 MBq. Since 1990, more than 2,500 radioactive hotspots have been found on the Dalgety Bay foreshore, one-third of them since September 2011. On 25 April 2012, the Ministry of Defence and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency agreed a joint survey of the problem. As of 2012, the MoD was conducting a 12-month investigation of the contamination to try to avoid Dalgety Bay &quot;becoming the first place in the UK to be legally designated as radioactive contaminated land&quot;. In 2013, SEPA found that the MoD was solely responsible for the contamination. In early 2014 the MoD made four proposals regarding how to deal with the contamination, ranging from erecting fences to keep the public out, to sealing it in with concrete.

In September 2023, SEPA announced that the operation to remove the contamination had been successfully completed and that the relevant stretch of shoreline was now safe for public access for the first time since 2011. Some 6,500 radioactive particles, mostly of low activity, had been removed, with a purpose-built scanner being used to detect the particles. The project had previously been reported to cost £10.5 million.

<doc id="156692" wikidata="Q852435" url="?curid=156692" title="Steely Dan">
<text>Steely Dan is an American rock band formed in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, in 1971 by Walter Becker (guitars, bass, backing vocals) and Donald Fagen (keyboards, lead vocals). Originally having a full band lineup, Becker and Fagen chose to stop performing live by the end of 1974 and continued Steely Dan as a studio-only duo, utilizing a revolving cast of session musicians. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; has called them &quot;the perfect musical antiheroes for the seventies&quot;.

Becker and Fagen played together in a variety of bands from their time together studying at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson. They later moved to Los Angeles, gathered a band of musicians and began recording albums. Their first, &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy a Thrill&quot; (1972), established a template for their career, blending elements of rock, jazz, Latin music, R&amp;B, blues and sophisticated studio production with cryptic and ironic lyrics. The band enjoyed critical and commercial success with seven studio albums, peaking with their top-selling album &quot;Aja&quot;, released in 1977. 

After Steely Dan disbanded in 1981, Becker and Fagen worked sporadically on solo projects through the 1980s, although a cult following remained devoted to the group&#x27;s work. Since reuniting in 1993, Steely Dan has toured steadily and released two albums of new material, the first of which, &quot;Two Against Nature&quot; (2000), earned a Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the 43rd Grammy Awards. Their final album of new studio material was 2003&#x27;s &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; and the band has continued to release compilations, box sets and live albums on a regular basis. After Becker&#x27;s death in 2017, Fagen reluctantly continued the group with himself as the sole official member.

Steely Dan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001 and have sold more than 40 million albums worldwide. VH1 ranked Steely Dan at No. 82 on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Musical Artists of All Time&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked them No. 15 on its list of the &quot;20 Greatest Duos of All Time&quot;.

==History==

===Formative and early years (1967–1972)===
Becker and Fagen met in 1967 at Bard College, in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. As Fagen passed by The Red Balloon café, he heard Becker practicing the electric guitar. In an interview, Fagen recounted the experience: &quot;I hear this guy practicing, and it sounded very professional and contemporary. It sounded like, you know, like a black person, really.&quot; He introduced himself to Becker and asked, &quot;Do you want to be in a band?&quot; Discovering that they enjoyed similar music, the two began writing songs together.

Becker and Fagen began playing in local groups. One such group—known as the Don Fagen Jazz Trio, the Bad Rock Group and later the Leather Canary—included future comedy star Chevy Chase on drums. They played covers of songs by The Rolling Stones (&quot;Dandelion&quot;), Moby Grape (&quot;Hey Grandma&quot;), and Willie Dixon (&quot;Spoonful&quot;), as well as some original compositions. Terence Boylan, another Bard musician, remembered that Fagen took readily to the beatnik life while attending college: &quot;They never came out of their room, they stayed up all night. They looked like ghosts—black turtlenecks and skin so white that it looked like yogurt. Absolutely no activity, chain-smoking Lucky Strikes and dope.&quot;

After Fagen graduated in 1969, the two moved to Brooklyn and tried to peddle their tunes in the Brill Building in midtown Manhattan. Kenny Vance (of Jay and the Americans), who had a production office in the building, took an interest in their music, which led to work on the soundtrack of the low-budget film (featuring Richard Pryor and Robert Downey Sr.) &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Walk It Like You Talk It or You&#x27;ll Lose That Beat&quot;. Becker later said bluntly, &quot;We did it for the money.&quot; A series of demos from 1968 to 1971 are available in multiple different releases, not authorized by Becker and Fagen. This collection features approximately 25 tracks and is notable for its sparse arrangements (Fagen plays solo piano on many songs) and lo-fi production, a contrast with Steely Dan&#x27;s later work. Although some of these songs (&quot;Caves of Altamira&quot;, &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, &quot;Barrytown&quot;) were re-recorded for Steely Dan albums, most were never officially released.

In 1970, Gary Katz produced an album by singer Linda Hoover, &quot;I Mean to Shine&quot;, featuring Fagen, Becker, and Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter, and including five Becker/Fagen songs. The album was shelved over songwriting licensing issues, but was finally released 52 years later, in 2022.

Becker and Fagen joined the touring band of Jay and the Americans for about a year and a half. They were at first paid $100 per show, but partway through their tenure the band&#x27;s tour manager cut their salaries in half. The group&#x27;s lead singer, Jay Black, dubbed Becker and Fagen &quot;the Manson and Starkweather of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;, referring to cult leader Charles Manson and spree killer Charles Starkweather.

They had little success after moving to Brooklyn, although Barbra Streisand recorded their song &quot;I Mean to Shine&quot; on her 1971 &quot;Barbra Joan Streisand&quot; album. Their fortunes changed when one of Vance&#x27;s associates, Gary Katz, moved to Los Angeles to become a staff producer for ABC Records. He hired Becker and Fagen as staff songwriters; they flew to California. Katz would produce all their 1970s albums in collaboration with engineer Roger Nichols. Nichols would win six Grammy Awards for his work with the band from the 1970s to 2001.

Realizing that ABC artists could not handle the complexity of their songs, Becker and Fagen (at Katz&#x27;s suggestion) formed their own band with guitarists Denny Dias and Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter, drummer Jim Hodder and singer David Palmer, and Katz signed them to ABC as recording artists. Fans of Beat Generation literature, Fagen and Becker named the band after a &quot;revolutionary&quot; steam-powered dildo mentioned in the William S. Burroughs novel &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;. Palmer joined as a second lead vocalist because of Fagen&#x27;s occasional stage fright, his reluctance to sing in front of an audience, and because the label believed that his voice was not &quot;commercial&quot; enough.

In 1972, ABC issued Steely Dan&#x27;s first single, &quot;Dallas&quot;, backed with &quot;Sail the Waterway&quot;. Distribution of &quot;stock&quot; copies available to the general public was apparently extremely limited; the single sold so poorly that promotional copies are much more readily available than stock copies in today&#x27;s collectors market. As of 2015, &quot;Dallas&quot; and &quot;Sail the Waterway&quot; are the only officially released Steely Dan tracks that have not been reissued on cassette or compact disc. In a 1995 interview, Becker and Fagen called the songs &quot;stinko&quot;. &quot;Dallas&quot; was later covered by Poco on their &quot;Head Over Heels&quot; album.

===&quot;Can&#x27;t Buy a Thrill&quot; and &quot;Countdown to Ecstasy&quot; (1972–1973)===
&quot;Can&#x27;t Buy a Thrill&quot;, Steely Dan&#x27;s debut album, was released in 1972. Its hit singles &quot;Do It Again&quot; and &quot;Reelin&#x27; In the Years&quot; reached No. 6 and No. 11 respectively on the Billboard singles chart. Along with &quot;Dirty Work&quot; (sung by David Palmer), the songs became staples on radio.

Because of Fagen&#x27;s reluctance to sing live, Palmer handled most of the vocal duties on stage. During the first tour, however, Katz and Becker decided that they preferred Fagen&#x27;s interpretations of the band&#x27;s songs, persuading him to take over. Palmer quietly left the group while it recorded its second album; he later co-wrote the No. 2 hit &quot;Jazzman&quot; (1974) with Carole King. &quot;Village Voice&quot; rock critic Robert Christgau was pleased with the elevation of Fagen, noting that Palmer &quot;fit in like a cheerleader at a crap game.&quot;

Sometime after recording &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy a Thrill&quot;, Steely Dan wrote and recorded a jingle for Schlitz Beer that was rejected and never aired. Long considered lost, it was rediscovered in July 2023 by Cimcie Nichols in the archive of her late father Roger Nichols. The 1 minute and 50 second jingle has a distinct Steely Dan sound with layered vocals by Fagen, after a spoken word introduction in Spanish by Baxter (in a squeaky inhaled helium voice), with Fagen speaking an English translation. Recording took place in Studio A at The Village in Los Angeles. At the session, a photo was taken of Fagen in reindeer sweater and Dias in overalls and sombrero while holding a tank of helium that subsequently appeared on the back cover of &quot;Katy Lied&quot;. 

Released in 1973, &quot;Countdown to Ecstasy&quot; was not as commercially successful as Steely Dan&#x27;s first album. Becker and Fagen were unhappy with some of the performances on the record and believed that it sold poorly because it had been recorded hastily on tour. The album&#x27;s singles were &quot;Show Biz Kids&quot; and &quot;My Old School&quot;, both of which stayed in the lower half of the Billboard charts, although &quot;My Old School&quot;, and to a lesser extent, &quot;Bodhisattva&quot;, became FM Rock staples in time.

=== &quot;Pretzel Logic&quot; and &quot;Katy Lied&quot; (1974–1976) ===

&quot;Pretzel Logic &quot;was released in early 1974. A diverse set, it includes the group&#x27;s most successful single, &quot;Rikki Don&#x27;t Lose That Number&quot; (No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100), and a rendition of Duke Ellington and James &quot;Bubber&quot; Miley&#x27;s &quot;East St. Louis Toodle-Oo&quot;.

During the previous album&#x27;s tour, the band had added vocalist-percussionist Royce Jones, vocalist-keyboardist Michael McDonald, and session drummer Jeff Porcaro. Porcaro played the sole drum track on one song, &quot;Night By Night&quot; on &quot;Pretzel Logic&quot; (Jim Gordon played drums on all the remaining tracks, and he and Porcaro both played on &quot;Parker&#x27;s Band&quot;), reflecting Steely Dan&#x27;s increasing reliance on session musicians (including Dean Parks and Rick Derringer). Jeff Porcaro and &quot;Katy Lied&quot; pianist David Paich would go on to form Toto. Striving for perfection, Becker and Fagen sometimes asked musicians to record as many as forty takes of each track.

&quot;Pretzel Logic&quot; was the first Steely Dan album to feature Walter Becker on guitar. &quot;Once I met [session musician] Chuck Rainey&quot;, he explained, &quot;I felt there really was no need for me to be bringing my bass guitar to the studio anymore&quot;.

A rift began growing between Becker-Fagen and Steely Dan&#x27;s other members (particularly Baxter and Hodder), who wanted to tour. Becker and Fagen disliked constant touring and wanted to concentrate solely on writing and recording. The other members gradually left the band, discouraged by this and by their diminishing roles in the studio. However, Dias remained with the group until 1980&#x27;s &quot;Gaucho&quot; and Michael McDonald contributed vocals until the group&#x27;s twenty-year hiatus after &quot;Gaucho&quot;. Baxter and McDonald went on to join The Doobie Brothers. Steely Dan&#x27;s last tour performance was on July 5, 1974, a concert at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in California.

Becker and Fagen recruited a diverse group of session players for &quot;Katy Lied&quot; (1975), including Porcaro, Paich, and McDonald, as well as guitarist Elliott Randall, jazz saxophonist Phil Woods, saxophonist/bassist Wilton Felder, percussionist/vibraphonist/keyboardist Victor Feldman, keyboardist (and later producer) Michael Omartian, and guitarist Larry Carlton—Dias, Becker, and Fagen being Steely Dan&#x27;s only original members. The album went gold on the strength of &quot;Black Friday&quot; and &quot;Bad Sneakers&quot;, but the band members were dissatisfied with the album&#x27;s sound (compromised by a faulty DBX noise reduction system). &quot;Katy Lied&quot; also included &quot;Doctor Wu&quot; and &quot;Chain Lightning&quot;.

===&quot;The Royal Scam&quot; and &quot;Aja&quot; (1976–1978)===
&quot;The Royal Scam&quot; was released in May 1976. Partly because of Carlton&#x27;s prominent contributions, it is the band&#x27;s most guitar-oriented album. It also features performances by session drummer Bernard Purdie. The album sold well in the United States, though without the strength of a hit single. In the UK the single &quot;Haitian Divorce&quot; (Top 20) drove album sales, becoming Steely Dan&#x27;s first major hit there.
Steely Dan&#x27;s sixth album, the jazz-influenced &quot;Aja, &quot; was released in September 1977. &quot;Aja&quot; reached the Top Five in the U.S. charts within three weeks, winning the Grammy award for &quot;Engineer—Best Engineered Recording—Non-Classical.&quot; It was also one of the first American LPs to be certified &#x27;platinum&#x27; for sales of over 1 million albums.

Featuring Michael McDonald&#x27;s backing vocals, &quot;Peg&quot; (No. 11) was the album&#x27;s first single, followed by &quot;Josie&quot; (No. 26) and &quot;Deacon Blues&quot; (No. 19). &quot;Aja&quot; solidified Becker&#x27;s and Fagen&#x27;s reputations as songwriters and studio perfectionists. It features such jazz and fusion luminaries as guitarists Larry Carlton and Lee Ritenour; bassist Chuck Rainey; saxophonists Wayne Shorter, Pete Christlieb, and Tom Scott; drummers Steve Gadd, Rick Marotta and Bernard Purdie; pianist Joe Sample and ex-Miles Davis pianist/vibraphonist Victor Feldman and Grammy award-winning producer/arranger Michael Omartian (piano).

Planning to tour in support of &quot;Aja&quot;, Steely Dan assembled a live band. Rehearsal ended and the tour was canceled when backing musicians began comparing pay. The album&#x27;s history was documented in an episode of the TV and DVD series &quot;Classic Albums&quot;.

After &quot;Aja&#x27;s &quot;success, Becker and Fagen were asked to write the title track for the movie &quot;FM&quot;. The movie was a box-office disaster, but the song was a hit, earning Steely Dan another engineering Grammy award. It was a minor hit in the UK and barely missed the Top 20 in the U.S.A.

===&quot;Gaucho&quot; and breakup (1978–1981)===

Becker and Fagen took a break from songwriting for most of 1978 before starting work on &quot;Gaucho&quot;. The project would not go smoothly: technical, legal, and personal setbacks delayed the album&#x27;s release and subsequently led Becker and Fagen to suspend their partnership for over a decade.

Misfortune struck early when an assistant engineer accidentally erased most of &quot;The Second Arrangement&quot;, a favorite track of Katz and Nichols, which remained lost until a recording was discovered in 2020. More trouble—this time legal—followed. In March 1979, MCA Records bought ABC, and for much of the next two years Steely Dan could not release an album. Becker and Fagen had planned on leaving ABC for Warner Bros. Records, but MCA claimed ownership of their music, preventing them from changing labels.

Turmoil in Becker&#x27;s personal life also interfered. His girlfriend died of a drug overdose in their Upper West Side apartment, and he was sued for $17 million. Becker settled out of court, but he was shocked by the accusations and by the tabloid press coverage that followed. Soon after, Becker was struck by a taxi while crossing a Manhattan street, shattering his right leg in several places. He was left hospitalized as work on the album&#x27;s final mix was just beginning, and he was only able to collaborate with Fagen and Katz via telephone.

More legal trouble were to come. Jazz composer Keith Jarrett sued Steely Dan for copyright infringement, claiming that they had based &quot;Gaucho&quot;&#x27;s title track on one of his compositions, &quot;Long As You Know You&#x27;re Living Yours&quot;. Fagen later admitted that he&#x27;d loved the song and that it had been a strong influence.

&quot;Gaucho&quot; was finally released in November 1980. Despite its tortured history, it was another major success. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Hey Nineteen&quot;, reached No. 10 on the pop chart in early 1981, and &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; (featuring guitarist Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits) was a moderate hit in the spring. &quot;My Rival&quot; was featured in John Huston&#x27;s 1980 film &quot;Phobia&quot;. Roger Nichols won a third engineering Grammy award for his work on the album.

===Time off (1981–1993)===
Steely Dan disbanded in June 1981. Becker moved to Maui, where he became an &quot;avocado rancher and self-styled critic of the contemporary scene.&quot; He stopped using drugs, which he had used for most of his career. Meanwhile, Fagen released a solo album, &quot;The Nightfly &quot;(1982), which went platinum in both the U.S. and the UK and yielded the Top-20 hit &quot;I.G.Y. (What a Beautiful World)&quot;. In 1988 Fagen wrote the score of &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot; and a song for its soundtrack, but otherwise recorded little. He occasionally did production work for other artists, as did Becker. The most prominent of these were two albums Becker produced for the British sophisti-pop group China Crisis, who were strongly influenced by Steely Dan. Becker is listed as an official member of China Crisis on the first of these albums, 1985&#x27;s &quot;Flaunt the Imperfection&quot;. For the second of the two albums, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Diary of a Hollow Horse&quot;, Becker is only listed as a producer and not as a band member.

In 1986 Becker and Fagen performed on &quot;Zazu&quot;, an album by former model Rosie Vela produced by Gary Katz. The two rekindled their friendship and held songwriting sessions between 1986 and 1987, leaving the results unfinished. On October 23, 1991, Becker attended a concert by New York Rock and Soul Revue, co-founded by Fagen and producer/singer Libby Titus (who was for many years the partner of Levon Helm of The Band and would later become Fagen&#x27;s wife), and spontaneously performed with the group.

Becker produced Fagen&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Kamakiriad&quot;, in 1993. Fagen conceived the album as a sequel to &quot;The Nightfly&quot;.

===Reunion, &quot;Alive in America&quot; (1993–2000)===

Becker and Fagen reunited for an American tour to support &quot;Kamakiriad&quot;, which sold poorly despite a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. With Becker playing lead and rhythm guitar, the pair assembled a band that included a second keyboard player, second lead guitarist, bassist, drummer, vibraphonist, three female backing singers, and four-piece saxophone section. Among the musicians from the live band, several would continue to work with Steely Dan over the next decade, including bassist Tom Barney and saxophone players Cornelius Bumpus and Chris Potter. During this tour, Fagen introduced himself as &quot;Rick Strauss&quot; and Becker as &quot;Frank Poulenc&quot;.

Later that year, MCA released &quot;Citizen Steely Dan&quot;, a boxed set featuring their entire catalog (except their debut single &quot;Dallas&quot;/&quot;Sail The Waterway&quot;) on four CDs, plus four extra tracks: &quot;Here at the Western World&quot; (originally released on 1978&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;), &quot;FM&quot; (1978 single), a 1971 demo of &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Gone to the Movies&quot; and &quot;Bodhisattva (live)&quot;, the latter recorded on a cassette in 1974 and released as a B-side in 1980. In 1994, Becker released his debut solo album, &quot;11 Tracks of Whack&quot;, which Fagen co-produced.

Steely Dan toured again in 1994 in support of the boxed set and &quot;Tracks&quot;. In 1995 they released a live CD, &quot;Alive in America&quot;, compiled from recordings of several 1993 and 1994 concerts. The Art Crimes Tour followed in 1996, including dates in the United States, Japan, and their first European shows in 22 years. After this activity, Becker and Fagen returned to the studio to begin work on a new album, which would be recorded between 1997 and 1999.

===&quot;Two Against Nature&quot; and &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; (2000–2003)===
In 2000 Steely Dan released their first studio album in 20 years: &quot;Two Against Nature&quot;. It won four Grammy Awards: Best Engineered Album – Non-Classical, Best Pop Vocal Album, Best Pop Performance by Duo or Group with Vocal (&quot;Cousin Dupree&quot;), and Album of the Year (despite competition in this category from Eminem&#x27;s &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; and Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Kid A&quot;). In the summer of 2000, they began another American tour, followed by an international tour later that year. The tour featured guitarist Jon Herington, who would go on to play with the band over the next two decades. The group released the &quot;Plush TV Jazz-Rock Party&quot; DVD, documenting a live-in-the-studio concert performance of popular songs from throughout Steely Dan&#x27;s career. In March 2001, Steely Dan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, at the ceremony playing &quot;Black Friday&quot; and teaming with Brian May to perform &quot;Do It Again&quot;.

In 2002 during the recording of &quot;Everything Must Go&quot;, Becker and Fagen fired their engineer Roger Nichols, who had worked with them for 30 years, without explanation or notification, according to band biographer Brian Sweet&#x27;s 2018 revision of his book &quot;Reelin&#x27; in the Years.&quot;

In 2003 Steely Dan released &quot;Everything Must Go&quot;. In contrast to their earlier work, they had tried to write music that captured a live feel. Becker sang lead vocals on a Steely Dan studio album for the first time (&quot;Slang of Ages&quot;—he had sung lead on his own &quot;Book of Liars&quot; on &quot;Alive in America&quot;). Fewer session musicians played on &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; than had become typical of Steely Dan albums: Becker played bass on every track and lead guitar on five tracks; Fagen added piano, electric piano, organ, synthesizers, and percussion on top of his vocals; touring drummer Keith Carlock played on every track.

===Touring, solo activity (2003–2017)===
To complete his &quot;Nightfly&quot; trilogy, Fagen issued &quot;Morph the Cat&quot; in 2006. Steely Dan returned to annual touring that year with the Steelyard &quot;Sugartooth&quot; McDan and The Fab-Originees.com Tour. Despite much fluctuation in membership, the live band featured mainstays Herington, Carlock, bassist Freddie Washington, the horn section of Michael Leonhart, Jim Pugh, Roger Rosenberg, and Walt Weiskopf, and backing vocalists Carolyn Leonhart and Cindy Mizelle. The 2007 Heavy Rollers Tour included dates in North America, Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, making it their most expansive tour.

The smaller Think Fast Tour followed in 2008, with keyboardist Jim Beard joining the live band. That year Becker released a second album, &quot;Circus Money&quot;, produced by Larry Klein and inspired by Jamaican music. In 2009 Steely Dan toured Europe and America extensively in their Left Bank Holiday and Rent Party Tour, alternating between standard one-date concerts at large venues and multi-night theater shows that featured performances of &quot;The Royal Scam&quot;, &quot;Aja&quot;, or &quot;Gaucho&quot; in their entirety on certain nights. The following year, Fagen formed the touring supergroup Dukes of September Rhythm Revue with McDonald, Boz Scaggs, and members of Steely Dan&#x27;s live band, whose repertoire included songs by all three songwriters. Longtime studio engineer Roger Nichols died of pancreatic cancer on April 10, 2011. Steely Dan&#x27;s Shuffle Diplomacy Tour that year included an expanded set list and dates in Australia and New Zealand. Fagen released his fourth album, &quot;Sunken Condos&quot;, in 2012. It was his first solo release unrelated to the &quot;Nightfly&quot; trilogy.

The Mood Swings: 8 Miles to Pancake Day Tour began in July 2013 and featured an eight-night run at the Beacon Theatre in New York City. Jamalot Ever After, their 2014 United States tour, ran from July 2 in Portland, Oregon, to September 20 in Port Chester, New York. 2015&#x27;s Rockabye Gollie Angel Tour included opening act Elvis Costello and the Imposters and dates at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The Dan Who Knew Too Much tour followed in 2016, with Steve Winwood opening. Steely Dan also performed at The Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles with an accompanying orchestra.

The band played its final shows with Becker in 2017. In April, they played the 12-date Reelin&#x27; In the Chips residency in Las Vegas and Southern California. Becker&#x27;s final performance came on May 27 at the Greenwich Town Party in Greenwich, Connecticut. Due to illness, Becker did not play Steely Dan&#x27;s two Classics East and West concerts at Dodger Stadium and Citi Field in July. Fagen embarked on a tour that summer with a new backing band, The Nightflyers.

===After Becker&#x27;s death (since 2017)===
Becker died from complications of esophageal cancer on September 3, 2017. In a note released to the media, Fagen remembered his longtime friend and bandmate, and promised to &quot;keep the music we created together alive as long as I can with the Steely Dan band.&quot; After Becker&#x27;s death, Steely Dan honored commitments to perform a short North American tour in October 2017 and three concert dates in the United Kingdom and Ireland for Bluesfest on a double bill with the Doobie Brothers. The band played its first concert following Becker&#x27;s death in Thackerville, Oklahoma, on October 13. In tribute to Becker, they performed his solo song &quot;Book of Liars&quot;, with Fagen singing the lead vocals, at several concerts on the tour.

Becker&#x27;s widow and estate sued Fagen later that year, arguing that the estate should control 50% of the band&#x27;s shares. Fagen filed a counter suit, arguing that the band had drawn up plans in 1972 stating that band members leaving the band or dying relinquish shares of the band&#x27;s output to the surviving members. In December, Fagen said that he would rather have retired the Steely Dan name after Becker&#x27;s death, and would instead have toured with the current iteration of the group under another name, but was persuaded not to by promoters for commercial reasons.

In 2018, Steely Dan performed on a summer tour of the United States with The Doobie Brothers as co-headliners. The band also played a nine-show residency at the Beacon Theatre in New York City that October. In February 2019, the band embarked on a tour of Great Britain with Steve Winwood. Guitarist Connor Kennedy of The Nightflyers joined the live band, beginning with a nine-night residency at The Venetian Resort in Las Vegas in April 2019.

As of September 2021, the legal battle over the band&#x27;s royalties was still ongoing, with Fagen speculating during an interview that &quot;thousands of lawyers&quot; were probably involved in the dispute. In July 2023, the Eagles announced Steely Dan would be the special guest of their The Long Farewell tour running from September to November 2023. In October 2023, Steely Dan was forced to cancel dates in Denver and Indianapolis after Fagen was hospitalized with an undisclosed illness. Sheryl Crow replaced the band in Denver and the Steve Miller Band in Indianapolis. The situation endured on November dates, as Tedeschi Trucks opened the Atlanta shows, and The Doobie Brothers performed the opening acts in Charlotte, Raleigh, Lexington and St. Paul. By January 2024, Steely Dan rejoined the Eagles in Los Angeles.

==Musical and lyrical style==
===Music===
====Overall sound====
Steely Dan&#x27;s albums are notable for the characteristically &#x27;warm&#x27; and &#x27;dry&#x27; production sound, and the sparing use of echo and reverberation.

====Backing vocals====
Becker and Fagen favored a distinctly soul-influenced style of backing vocals, which after the first few albums were almost always performed by a female chorus (although Michael McDonald features prominently on several tracks, including the 1975 song &quot;Black Friday&quot; and the 1977 song &quot;Peg&quot;). Venetta Fields, Sherlie Matthews and Clydie King were the preferred trio for backing vocals on the group&#x27;s late 1970s albums. Other backing vocalists include Timothy B. Schmit, Tawatha Agee, Carolyn Leonhart, Janice Pendarvis, Catherine Russell, Patti Austin and Valerie Simpson.

====Horns====
Horn arrangements have been used on songs from all Steely Dan albums. They typically feature instruments such as trumpets, trombones and saxophones, although they have also used other instruments, such as flutes and clarinets. On their earlier albums Steely Dan featured guest arrangers and on their later albums the arrangement work is credited to Fagen.

====Composition and chord use====
Steely Dan use the add 2 chord, a type of added tone chord, which they nicknamed the &quot;mu major&quot;. The mu major chord differs from a suspended second (sus2) chord, as suspended chords do not contain the major (or minor) third. In a 1989 interview, Walter Becker explained that the use of the chord developed from trying to enrich the sound of a major chord without making it into a &quot;jazz chord&quot;. In the &quot;Steely Dan Songbook&quot;, Becker and Donald Fagen state that &quot;inversions of the mu major may be formed in the usual manner with one caveat: the voicing of the second and third scale tones, which is the essence of the chord&#x27;s appeal, should always occur as a whole tone dissonance.&quot;

===Lyrics===

Steely Dan&#x27;s lyrical subjects are diverse, but in their basic approach they often create fictional personae that participate in a narrative or situation. The duo have said that in retrospect, most of their albums have a &quot;feel&quot; of either Los Angeles or New York City, the two main cities where Becker and Fagen lived and worked. Characters appear in their songs that evoke these cities, such as Aja in the song of the same name, which in the opinion of Alex Pappademas, co-author of &quot;Quantum Criminals,&quot; is a personification of Los Angeles.

Steely Dan&#x27;s lyrics are often puzzling to the listener, with the true meaning of the song &quot;uncoded&quot; through repeated listening, and a richer understanding of the references within the lyrics. In the song &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Gone to the Movies&quot;, the line &quot;I know you&#x27;re used to 16 or more, sorry we only have eight&quot; refers not to the count of some article, but to 8 mm film, which was lower quality than 16 mm or larger formats and often used for pornography, underscoring the illicitness of Mr. LaPage&#x27;s movie parties. 

Steely Dan lyrics are often about impulsive people in denial. Some have argued that Steely Dan never wrote a genuine love song, instead dealing with personal passion in the guise of a destructive obsession. Many of their songs concern love, but typical of Steely Dan songs is an ironic or disturbing twist in the lyrics that reveals a darker reality. For example, expressed &quot;love&quot; is actually about prostitution (&quot;Pearl of the Quarter&quot;), incest (&quot;Cousin Dupree&quot;), pornography (&quot;Everyone&#x27;s Gone to the Movies&quot;), or some other socially unacceptable subject. However, some of their demo-era recordings show Fagen and Becker expressing romance, including &quot;This Seat&#x27;s Been Taken&quot;, &quot;Oh, Wow, It&#x27;s You&quot; and &quot;Come Back Baby&quot;.

Steely Dan&#x27;s lyrics contain subtle and encoded references, unusual (and sometimes original) slang expressions, a wide variety of &quot;word games&quot;. The obscure and sometimes teasing lyrics have given rise to considerable efforts by fans to explain the &quot;inner meaning&quot; of certain songs. Jazz is a recurring theme, and there are numerous other film, television and literary references and allusions, such as &quot;Home at Last&quot; (from &quot;Aja&quot;), which was inspired by Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

<text>A hillfort is a type of fortified refuge or defended settlement located to exploit a rise in elevation for defensive advantage. They are typical of the late European Bronze Age and Iron Age. Some were used in the post-Roman period. The fortification usually follows the contours of a hill and consists of one or more lines of earthworks or stone ramparts, with stockades or defensive walls, and external ditches. If enemies were approaching, the civilians would spot them from a distance.

Prehistoric Europe saw a growing population. It has been estimated that in about 5000 BC during the Neolithic between 2 million and 5 million lived in Europe; in the Late Iron Age it had an estimated population of around 15 to 30 million. Outside Greece and Italy, which were more densely populated, the vast majority of settlements in the Iron Age were small, with perhaps no more than 50 inhabitants. Hillforts were the exception, and were the home of up to 1,000 people. With the emergence of &quot;oppida&quot; in the Late Iron Age, settlements could reach as large as 10,000 inhabitants. As the population increased so did the complexity of prehistoric societies. Around 1100 BC hillforts emerged and in the following centuries spread through Europe. They served a range of purposes and were variously tribal centres, defended places, foci of ritual activity, and places of production.

Hillforts were frequently occupied by conquering armies, but on other occasions the forts were destroyed, the local people forcibly evicted, and the forts left derelict. For example, Solsbury Hill was sacked and deserted during the Belgic invasions of southern Britain in the 1st century BC. Abandoned forts were sometimes reoccupied and refortified under renewed threat of foreign invasion, such as the Dukes&#x27; Wars in Lithuania, and the successive invasions of Britain by Romans, Saxons and Vikings.

== Celtic hillforts ==
Celtic hillforts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly the start of the first millennium BC, and were used in many Celtic areas of central and western Europe until the Roman conquest. They are most common during later periods:
* The Proto-Celtic Urnfield culture and Atlantic Bronze Age (Bronze Age, c. 1300 BC – 750 BC)
* Hallstatt culture ( early Iron Age, c. 1200 BC – 500 BC)
* La Tène culture (late Iron Age, c. 600 BC – 50 AD)

The Hallstatt culture and La Tène culture originated in what is now southern Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The predominant form of rampart construction was &quot;pfostenschlitzmauer&quot;, or &quot;Kelheim-style&quot;. During the Hallstatt C period, hillforts became the dominant settlement type in the west of Hungary. Julius Caesar described the large late Iron Age hillforts he encountered during his campaigns in Gaul as oppida. By this time the larger ones had become more like cities than fortresses and many were assimilated as Roman towns.

=== Great Britain ===

The reason for the emergence of hillforts in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view, since the 1960s, has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze and, as a result, trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Power passed into the hands of a new group of people. Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated &quot;[the forts] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [of an increasing population] burst out into open warfare. But I wouldn&#x27;t see them as having been built because there was a state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction&quot;.

Hillforts in Britain are known from the Bronze Age, but the great period of hillfort construction was during the Celtic Iron Age, between 700 BC and the Roman conquest of Britain in 43 AD. The Romans occupied some forts, such as the military garrison at Hod Hill, and the temple at Brean Down, but others were destroyed and abandoned. Partially articulated remains of between 28 and 40 men, women and children at Cadbury Castle were thought by the excavator to implicate the Cadbury population in a revolt in the 70&#x27;s AD (roughly contemporary with that of Boudicca in the East of England), although this has been questioned by subsequent researchers. However, the presence of barracks on the hilltop in the decades following the conquest suggest an ongoing struggle to suppress local dissent.

Maiden Castle in Dorset is the largest hillfort in England. Where Roman influence was less strong, such as uninvaded Ireland and unsubdued northern Scotland, hillforts were still built and used for several more centuries.

There are over 2,000 Iron Age hillforts known in Britain of which nearly 600 are in Wales. Danebury in Hampshire, is the most thoroughly investigated Iron Age hillfort in Britain, as well as the most extensively published.

Cadbury Castle, Somerset is the largest amongst forts reoccupied following the end of Roman rule, to defend against pirate raids, and the Anglo-Saxon invasions. The cemetery outside Poundbury Hill contains east-facing Christian burials of the 4th century CE. In Wales, the hillfort at Dinas Powys was a late Iron Age hillfort reoccupied from the 5th-6th centuries CE; similarly at Castell Dinas Brân a hillfort of was reused in the Middle Ages, with a stone castle built there in the 13th century CE.

Some Iron Age hillforts were also incorporated into medieval frontier earthworks. For example Offa&#x27;s Dyke, a linear earthwork generally dated to the 9th century CE, makes use of the west and south-west ramparts of Llanymynech hillfort. Similarly the hillfort at Old Oswestry was incorporated into the early medieval Wat&#x27;s Dyke. The Wansdyke was a new linear earthwork connected to the existing hillfort at Maes Knoll, which defined the Celtic-Saxon border in south-west England during the period 577–652 CE.

Some hillforts were re-occupied by the Anglo-Saxons during the period of Viking raids. King Alfred established a network of coastal hillforts and lookout posts in Wessex, linked by a &quot;Herepath&quot;, or military road, which enabled his armies to cover Viking movements at sea. For example, see Daw&#x27;s Castle and Battle of Cynwit.

It has been suggested on reasonable evidence that many so-called hillforts were just used to pen in cattle, horses, or other domesticated animals. The large sprawling examples at Bindon Hill and Bathampton Down are more than . Even those that were defensive settlements in the Iron Age were sometimes used for corralling animals in later periods. For example, see Coney&#x27;s Castle, Dolebury Warren and Pilsdon Pen. However, it is difficult to prove that people definitely did not dwell there, as lack of evidence is not proof of absence.

=== Ireland ===

Bronze Age and Iron Age hillforts are widely found in Ireland, with more than 500 identifed in Ireland and Northern Ireland. They are large circular structures between 1 and 40 acres (most commonly 5–10 acres) in size, enclosed by a stone wall or earthen rampart or both. These would have been important tribal centres where the chief or king of the area would live with his extended family and support themselves by farming and renting cattle to their underlings.

About 12 are multivallate as distinguished by multiple ramparts, or a large counterscarp (outer bank). The imposing example at Mooghaun is defended by multiple stone walls.

One must be careful to not confuse a hill-fort with a &#x27;ringfort&#x27;—a medieval settlement—a common archaeological feature across the whole island of Ireland, of which over 40,000 examples are known; one source claims there may be 10,000 undiscovered ringforts.

== Other Hillforts in Europe ==

=== Iberian Peninsula ===


In Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, Basque Country, province of Ávila and Northern Portugal a &quot;castro&quot; is a fortified pre-Roman Iron Age village, usually located on a hill or some naturally easy defendable place. The larger hillforts are also called , or (English: &quot;cities&quot;).
They were located on hilltops, which allowed tactical control over the surrounding countryside and provided natural defences. They usually had access to a spring or small creek to provide water; some even had large reservoirs to use during sieges. Typically, a castro had one to five stone and earth walls, which complemented the natural defences of the hill. The buildings inside, most of them circular in shape, some rectangular, were about long; they were made out of stone with thatch roofs resting on a wood column in the centre of the building. In the major oppida there were regular streets, suggesting some form of central organization. Castros vary in area from less than a hectare to some 50 hectare ones, and most were abandoned after the Roman conquest of the territory.

Many castros were already established during the Atlantic Bronze Age period, pre-dating the Hallstatt culture.

Many of the megaliths from the Bronze Age such as menhirs and dolmens, which are frequently located near the castros, also pre-date the Celts in Portugal, Asturias and Galicia as well as in Atlantic France, Britain and Ireland. These megaliths were probably reused in syncretic rituals by the Celtic Druids.

The Celtiberian people occupied an inland region in central northern Spain, straddling the upper valleys of the Ebro, Douro and Tajo. They built hillforts, fortified hilltop towns and oppida, including Numantia.

=== Migration Period Germany ===
During the period of Late Antiquity or Migration Period a large number of hilltop settlements were established both on the Roman imperial territory and on Germanic soil. However, the term embraces a wide range of very different settlements in high locations. At least a few of the Germanic settlements were protected by fortifications. Unlike the Romans, however, the Germanii did not use mortar at that time for their construction. Among the best known hill settlements in Germany are the Runder Berg near Bad Urach and the Gelbe Bürg near Dittenheim.

=== Sweden===
In Sweden, hillforts are fortifications from the Iron Age which may have had several functions. They are usually located on the crests of hills and mountains making use of precipices and marshes which worked as natural defences. The crests&#x27; more accessible parts were defended with walls of stone and outer walls in the slopes beneath are common. Round and closed, so-called &quot;ring forts&quot; are common even on flat ground. The walls often have remaining parts of stone, which were probably the support of pales. They often have well delineated gateways, the gates of which were probably of wood. Hillforts with strong walls are often located beside old trade routes and have an offensive character, whereas others are reclusive and were weakly fortified, probably only for hiding during raids.

Many forts, located centrally in densely populated areas, were permanently settled strongholds and can show traces of settlements both inside and outside. Older place names containing the element &quot;sten&quot;/&quot;stein&quot; were usually hillforts.

In Sweden, there are 1,100 known hillforts with a strong concentration on the northern west coast and in eastern Svealand. In Södermanland there are 300, in Uppland 150, Östergötland 130, and 90 to 100 in each of Bohuslän and Gotland.

===Norway===
Norway has about 400 hillforts.

===Denmark===
Denmark has 26 hillforts.

=== Finland ===

The Finnish word for &quot;hillfort&quot; is (plural ), meaning &quot;fort hill&quot; or &quot;castle hill&quot;, or alternatively &#x27; meaning &quot;ancient fort&quot;, as opposed to bare &#x27; which refers to medieval or later fortifications.

One special feature about the Finnish hillforts that while most of them are located these days within some distance from the sea, but earlier many of the forts were located by the sea, due to post-glacial rebound.

Finland has around 100 hillforts verified by excavations, and about 200 more suspected sites. The largest hillfort in Finland is the Rapola Castle, other notable are the Old Castle of Lieto and the Sulkava hillfort.

=== Estonia ===
The Estonian word for &quot;hillfort&quot; is (plural ), meaning &quot;hillfort&quot; or &quot;hillburgh&quot;. There are several hundred hillforts or presumed ancient hillfort sites all over Estonia. Some of them, like Toompea in Tallinn or Toomemägi in Tartu, are governance centres used since ancient times up until today. Some others, like Varbola are historical sites nowadays.

Most likely the Estonian hillforts were in pre-Christian times administrative, economic and military centres of Estonian tribes. Although some of them were probably used only during times of crisis and stood empty in peacetime (for example Soontagana in Koonga parish, Pärnu county).

 contains a common list of castles, fortresses, forts, an hillforts.

=== Latvia ===
The Latvian word for &quot;hillfort&quot; is (plural: ), from &#x27; (castle) and &#x27; (hill).

Hillforts in Latvia offered not only military and administrative functions but they were also cultural and economic centres of some regions. Latvian hillforts generally were a part of a complex consisting of the main fortress, the settlement around it, one or more burial fields and nearby ritual sites. The first hillforts in Latvia, such as Daugmale hillfort, appeared during the Bronze Age. Some were continuously inhabited until the late Iron Age.

During the Roman Iron Age, some of the Latvian hillforts (like Ķivutkalns) were abandoned or became sparsely populated. A new period in hillfort development started during the 5th–8th centuries AD, when many new hillforts appeared, in most cases, along the main trades routes—rivers. During the 10th–11th centuries, some of the hillforts became military fortresses with strong fortifications (like hillforts in Tērvete, Talsi, Mežotne). Some of them are considered important political centres of the local peoples, who in this period were subjects of serious social political changes. That period was known for unrest and military activities, as well as power struggles between local aristocracy. Most of the Latvian hillforts were destroyed or abandoned during the Livonian Crusade in the 13th century, but some were still used in the 14th century. In total, there are about 470 hillforts in Latvia.

=== Lithuania ===


The Lithuanian word for &quot;hillfort&quot; is (plural ), from &#x27; (=castle) and &#x27; (=mountain, hill).

Lithuania has hillforts dating from the Bronze Age in the 1st millennium BC. The earliest examples in present-day Lithuania are found in the east of the country. Most of these forts were built or expanded between the fifth and fifteenth centuries, when they were used in the Dukes&#x27; Wars, and against the invasion of Teutonic Knights from the west. Most forts were located on the banks of a river, or a confluence where two rivers met. These fortifications were typically wooden, although some had additional stone or brick walls. The hill was usually sculpted for defensive purposes, with the top flattened and the natural slopes made steeper for defence.

During the early years of Grand Duchy of Lithuania played a major role in conflicts with the Livonian Order and the Teutonic Knights. During this period the number of &quot;piliakalniai&quot; in use decreased, but those that remained had stronger fortifications. Two main defence lines developed: one along the Neman River (against the Teutonic Order) and another along the border with Livonia. Two other lines started to form, but did not fully develop. One was to protect Vilnius, the capital, and the other line in Samogitia, was a major target for both orders. This territory separated the two Orders and prevented joint action between them and Pagan Lithuania.

, according to the &quot;Atlas of Lithuanian Hillforts&quot;, there were 921 objects in Lithuania identified as &quot;&quot;. Most are located near rivers and are endangered by erosion: many have partly collapsed as the flooded river has washed out the base of the hill. Now around 80 percent of &quot;piliakalniai&quot; are covered by forests and are hardly accessible to visitors.

=== Eastern European gords ===
In Russia, Belarus and Poland Iron Age and Early Medieval hillforts are called gords. They were the residence of local rulers, and provided for refuge in times of war.

==Hillforts elsewhere in the world==
Similar structures can be found elsewhere in the world, such as the Hill Forts of Rajasthan.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, the Ivatan people of the Batanes Islands built &quot;ijang&quot;—fortified villages on top of natural hills and raised landforms near the coastlines. These were terraced into defensive ramparts with limited access points. Artifacts recovered from an ijang on the town of Savidug in Sabtang has been dated to around 1200 CE. These high rocky formations served as a refuge against attacking enemies. Ijang were first described by the English freebooter Captain William Dampier when he visited the island of Ivuhos in 1687. During the Spanish colonial era, ijang were abandoned during the &quot;Reducciones&quot; as the Ivatan population were moved into centralized towns in the lowlands.

===New Zealand===
Among the Māori people, villages called pā were often built on raised ground, like volcanic hills, headlands, and small islands (including artificial islands). The slopes were terraced into defensive ramparts that were usually further protected by palisades. Traditional pā took a variety of designs, ranging from a simple terraced hill, to complex fortified structures that include multiple rows of palisades and underground defensive and ambush points. Māori pā differed from European hillforts in that they also prominently incorporate food storage pits and often, water sources. They survived until the colonial era and later types of pā were designed specifically for fighting with guns.

<doc id="156694" wikidata="Q715723" url="?curid=156694" title="Urusei Yatsura">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Rumiko Takahashi. It was serialized in Shogakukan&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; from September 1978 to February 1987. Its 366 individual chapters were collected in 34 &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes. It tells the story of Ataru Moroboshi, and the alien Lum, who believes she is Ataru&#x27;s wife after he accidentally proposes to her. The series makes heavy use of Japanese mythology, culture, and puns. It was adapted into two anime television series that aired on Fuji TV affiliates.

The manga series was republished in different formats in Japan. Viz Media released the series in North America in the 1990s under the names &quot;Lum * Urusei Yatsura&quot; and &quot;The Return of Lum&quot;, but dropped it after nine volumes. They re-licensed the manga and released an omnibus edition under its original title with new translations from 2019 to 2023. The first television series, produced by Kitty Films, was broadcast from October 1981 to March 1986, with 194 half-hour episodes. Twelve OVAs and six theatrical films followed, and the series was released on various home video formats. A second anime television series adaptation of 46 episodes produced by David Production aired on the Noitamina programming block from October 2022 to June 2024. It is licensed by Sentai Filmworks and is streamed on Hidive.

The original television series, OVAs, and five of the films were released in North America with English subtitles, as well as a dub for the films by AnimEigo. They provided extensive notes on the series to allow people to understand the many cultural references and jokes in the series that would not normally be understood by non-Japanese. The remaining film, &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot;, was released bilingually by Central Park Media. Five of the films, as well as the OVAs, are available from MVM Films in the United Kingdom. The series was released on television in Southeast Asia as &quot;Lamu the Invader Girl&quot;. The series and films have been license rescued by Discotek Media for a Blu-ray release.

&quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; launched Takahashi&#x27;s career and received positive reception in and out of Japan from fans and critics alike. The manga has over 35 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. In 1980, it received the 26th Shogakukan Manga Award in the &quot;shōnen&quot; category, as well as the 18th Seiun Award for the Best Comic category in 1987.

==Plot==

An alien race known as the Oni arrive on Earth to invade the planet. Instead of taking over the planet by force, the Oni give humans a chance to fight for the rights to the planet by taking part in a competition. The competition is a variant of the game of tag (known as &quot;the game of the Oni&quot; in Japanese), in which the human player must touch the horns on the head of the Oni player within one week. The computer-selected human player is Ataru Moroboshi, a lecherous, unlucky and academically unsuccessful high school student from the fictional in Nerima, Japan, and the Oni player is Lum, daughter of the leader of the alien invaders. Despite his initial reluctance to take part in the competition, Ataru becomes interested in the game when he meets Lum. When the competition begins, Lum surprises everyone by flying away and Ataru finds himself unable to catch her. Before the last day of the competition, Ataru&#x27;s girlfriend Shinobu Miyake encourages Ataru by pledging to marry him if he wins. On the final day of the competition, Ataru wins the game by stealing Lum&#x27;s bikini top, which prevents her from protecting her horns in favor of protecting her modesty. In celebrating his victory, Ataru expresses his joy at being able to get married; however, Lum misinterprets this as a proposal from Ataru and accepts on the competition&#x27;s worldwide live television broadcast. Despite the misunderstanding, Lum falls in love with Ataru and moves into his house.

Despite Ataru&#x27;s lack of interest in Lum and attempts to rekindle his relationship with Shinobu, Lum frequently interferes and Shinobu loses interest in Ataru. Still, Ataru&#x27;s flirtatious nature persists despite Lum&#x27;s attention. Lum attempts to stop him from flirting, which results in Ataru receiving powerful electric shock attacks from Lum as punishment. Two characteristics of Ataru are particularly strong: his pervertedness and his bad luck that draws to him all bizarre residents of the planet, the spirit world and even the galaxy. Later Lum begins attending the same school as Ataru despite his objections. Lum develops a fan base of admirers among the boys of the school, including Shutaro Mendo, the rich and handsome heir to a large corporation that all the girls from Tomobiki have a crush on. Despite their romantic interest, none of Lum&#x27;s admirers will risk upsetting Lum by trying to force her and Ataru apart, although this does not stop them from trying to get Ataru punished due to his bad behavior, and interfering every time the two get close.

==Production==
In 1977, Rumiko Takahashi created the short story &quot;Those Selfish Aliens&quot; that was nominated for Shogakukan&#x27;s Best New Comic Artist award. This would serve as the basis for creating &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; which was first published a year later when Takahashi was 20 years old. The series was her first major work, having previously only published short stories, and is a combination of romantic comedy, science fiction, suburban life, and Japanese folktales. The title of the series is an untranslatable pun on the word , meaning &quot;noisy&quot; or &quot;obnoxious&quot;, but written with the Chinese character for &quot;planet&quot;; the title can be translated roughly into English as &quot;Those Obnoxious Aliens&quot;. The series first appeared in Shogakukan&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shonen Sunday&quot; in September 1978. At the start of the series it was only scheduled to run for 5 chapters. Ataru was the central character and each chapter would feature a different strange character. The character of Lum was only going to appear in the first chapter and was not in the second chapter; however, Takahashi decided to re-include her in the third chapter. The series was not an instant success and chapters were initially published sporadically. Between May and September 1978 she simultaneously worked on a series called &quot;Dust Spot&quot;; however, the increasing popularity of &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; caused her to focus on &quot;Urusei&quot; and the series became a regular serialization from the middle of 1979.

Takahashi said that she had been dreaming about the overall universe of &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; since she was very young. She said that the series &quot;really includes everything I ever wanted to do. I love science fiction because sci-fi has tremendous flexibility. I adopted the science fiction-style for the series because then I could write any way I wanted to&quot;. She wanted the reader to be completely surprised by the next panel and used slapstick comedy to create a reaction in the reader. When Takahashi ran out of ideas she would create new characters. Takahashi shared a small 150-square-foot apartment with her assistants, and slept in a closet due to a lack of space. While writing &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; she also began work on &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; and used this experience as well as her university experience as the basis for the setting of that series. Character names often carry extra meanings used to describe a characters personality or other traits. For example, the name Ataru Moroboshi refers to being hit by a star, a reference to the aliens and other people who gather around him. The name Shinobu suggests a patient character; however, this in contrast to the character&#x27;s actual personality. In a similar way, the setting for the series is &quot;Tomobiki&quot;, which means &quot;friend taking&quot;. Tomobiki is also the name of a superstitious day in the old Japanese calendar system considered to have &quot;no winners or losers&quot; and occurred on every sixth day. Funerals rarely took place on this day as it was believed more deaths would soon follow. Lum was named after Agnes Lum, a bikini model during the 1970s. Lum&#x27;s use of the English word &quot;Darling&quot; in reference to Ataru was to emphasize her status as a foreigner, as well as a play on the name Darrin, the husband figure from &quot;Bewitched&quot;.

The characters of Megane, Perm, Kakugari and Chibi are recurring characters throughout the first anime adaptation; however, in the manga they are nameless fans of Lum who appear less after Mendo is introduced. In contrast the character Kosuke Shirai plays a large role in the manga, but does not appear in the first anime series. His role is often performed by Perm. The second half of the first anime adaptation is closer to the manga than the first half. In 2022, Takahashi said that &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; ended because she saw that Shinobu was happy after the character Inaba had been introduced. Takahashi has stated that she will not produce any more content for the series.

===Manga===

Written and illustrated by Rumiko Takahashi, &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; began sporadic serialization on September 24, 1978, in that year&#x27;s 39th issue of Shogakukan&#x27;s anthology magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; until the middle of 1979 when it became a regular serialization. It ended in 1987&#x27;s eighth issue on February 4, after publishing 366 chapters and almost 6,000 pages. A total of 34 individual volumes with 11 chapters each were released in &quot;tankōbon&quot; format between 1980 and March 1987. After the tenth anniversary of start of the series, it was printed in 15 &quot;wideban&quot; editions between July 1989 and August 1990. Each volume contained around 25 chapters, and were printed on higher-quality paper, with new inserts. A &quot;bunkoban&quot; edition of the series was released over 17 volumes between August 1998 and December 1999. Each volume contains forewords by other manga creators discussing the influence the series had on them. A &quot;My First Big&quot; edition was printed between July 2000 and September 2004. This edition was similar to the &quot;tankōbon&quot; but used low-quality paper and were sold at a low price. A &quot;shinsoban&quot; edition over 34 volumes was released between November 17, 2006, and March 18, 2008. This edition was also similar to the &quot;tankōbon&quot; but used new cover artwork and included a section that displayed artwork from current manga artists.

After requests from fans, Viz Media licensed the series for release in English across North America under the title of &quot;Lum * Urusei Yatsura&quot;. Despite a strong start, the series was dropped after eight issues. The series was then reintroduced in the monthly Viz publication &quot;Animerica&quot; and because of the long gap the series was retitled &quot;The Return of Lum&quot;. To start, chapters were published monthly in &quot;Animerica&quot;; however, due to reader feedback and an increased popularity of the series it was decided to release it as an individual monthly publication. The English release finished in 1998 and is now out of print. The first 11 volumes of the Japanese release were covered, but several chapters were excluded and a total nine English volumes of the series were released.

On July 19, 2018, Viz announced that they re-licensed the manga with plans to release it in a 2-in-1 omnibus edition with new translations. Based on the Japanese &quot;shinsoban&quot;, the first volume was published on February 19, 2019, and the seventeenth and last on February 19, 2023.

===Anime===

The series was adapted by Kitty Films into an animated television series that aired on Fuji TV from October 14, 1981, to March 19, 1986. The first season episodes would often consist of two fifteen-minute stories per episode, making a total of 194 episodes with 213 stories. The first 106 episodes were directed by Mamoru Oshii and the remainder by Kazuo Yamazaki. Six opening theme songs and nine closing themes were used during the series.

On December 10, 1983, the first VHS release of the series was made available in Japan. The series was also released on fifty LaserDiscs. Another VHS release across fifty cassettes began on March 17, 1998, and concluded on April 19, 2000. Two DVD box sets of the series were released between December 8, 2000, and March 9, 2001. These were followed by fifty individual volumes between August 24, 2001, and August 23, 2002. To celebrate the 35th anniversary of the anime a new HD transfer was created and released on Blu-ray in Japan. The first Blu-ray box set of the series was released on March 27, 2013, with the fourth box set released on March 26, 2014. To promote the Blu-ray, the anime was rebroadcast in high definition on Kids Station.

During 1992, the series was licensed for a North American release by AnimEigo. Their VHS release began in October of the same year and was among the first anime titles to receive a subtitled North American release. However, the release schedule was erratic. The episodes were also released on LaserDisc in 1993. The first two episodes were released with an English dub on March 29, 1995, as &quot;Those Obnoxious Aliens&quot;. Anime Projects released the series in the United Kingdom from April 25, 1994. AnimEigo later released the series on DVD. The series was available in box set format as well as individual releases. A total of 10 box sets and 50 individual DVDs were released between March 27, 2001, and June 20, 2006. Each DVD and VHS contained Liner notes explaining the cultural references and puns from the series. A fan group known as &quot;Lum&#x27;s Stormtroopers&quot; convinced the Californian public television station KTEH to broadcast subtitled episodes of the series in 1998. AnimeEigo&#x27;s license later expired, and has confirmed that the series is out of print as of September 2011. An improvisational dub of the first and third episodes was broadcast on BBC Choice in 2000 as part of a &quot;Japan Night&quot; special as &quot;Lum the Invader Girl&quot;. During their panel at Otakon 2022, Discotek Media announced that they licensed the anime series.

On January 1, 2022, a second television series adaptation was announced and premiered on Fuji TV&#x27;s Noitamina programming block on October 14, 2022. The series is produced by David Production and directed by Takahiro Komei, Hideya Takahashi and Yasuhiro Kimura, with scripts written by Yūko Kakihara, character designs and chief animation direction by Naoyuki Asano and Masaru Yokoyama composing the music. The series was announced for 46 full-length episodes of four cours split up into two seasons, with the first two-cour season aired from October 2022 to March 2023, and the second two-cour season aired from January to June 2024. Sentai Filmworks has licensed the series in North America, Europe, Oceania, and selected Latin American and Asian territories.

===Films===
During the television run of the first series, four theatrical films were produced. &quot;Urusei Yatsura: Only You&quot; was directed by Mamoru Oshii and began showing in Japanese cinemas on March 11, 1983. &quot;Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer&quot; was directed by Mamoru Oshii and was released on February 11, 1984. &quot;Urusei Yatsura 3: Remember My Love&quot; was directed by Kazuo Yamazaki and released on January 26, 1985. &quot;Urusei Yatsura 4: Lum the Forever&quot; was directed again by Kazuo Yamazaki and released on February 22, 1986.

After the conclusion of the first television series, two more films were produced. A year after the television series finished, &quot;Urusei Yatsura: The Final Chapter&quot; was directed by Satoshi Dezaki and was released on February 6, 1988, as a tenth-anniversary celebration. It was shown as a double bill with a &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; film.

==Reception==
By November 2020, &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; had over 35 million copies in circulation. In 1985, the franchise generated () in merchandise sales. The manga won the 26th Shogakukan Manga Award in the &quot;shōnen&quot; category in 1980. It was awarded the &quot;Best Comic&quot; category at the 18th Seiun Award in 1987. On TV Asahi&#x27;s Manga Sōsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150,000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; ranked 61st.

===Critical reception===
In &quot;&quot;, Jason Thompson referred to &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; as &quot;A slapstick combination of sci-fi, fairy-tale and ghost-story elements with plenty of cute girls.&quot; He also noted that Lum is &quot;the original otaku dream girl.&quot; He awarded the series four stars out of four. Graham Higgins of &quot;The Independent&quot; praised the series. He further wrote that the experience of reading &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; is &quot;a bit like channel-hopping between &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, &quot;Neighbours&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek&quot;.&quot; In an interview with Ex.org, Fred Schodt expressed surprise at the popularity of the original English release of the manga as he believed the cultural differences would be a problem. Reviewing the 2019 English release of the manga, Arpad Lep of &quot;Comics Beat&quot; called &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; an impressive, essential debut by a living legend of comics, where &quot;many themes and archetypes integral to her whole body of writing emerge already very well-developed.&quot; He compared its story to those by Shigeru Mizuki and its art, which he had strong praise for and noted gets better in just the first two volumes alone, to that of Go Nagai. Lep said Takahashi nails the many gags and physical comedy, with the series&#x27; stability from the never-changing sitcom elements of &quot;Disappointed parents. Put-upon girlfriend. Insatiable yokai. Weird uncle. And our hero, a total loser&quot; being fun and always staying fresh.

&quot;RightStuf&quot; wrote that Takahashi excels at creating characters who play off of each other perfectly and &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;″s normally &quot;calm [and] innocent&quot;, but hot-tempered, Lum serves as a wonderful foil to the &quot;idiotic, lecherous, and lazy&quot; Ataru. Nick Benefield of &quot;Operation Rainfall&quot; enjoyed that each chapter stands on its own and can largely be read in any order, as well as the manga&#x27;s &quot;heavy-handed usage&quot; of puns, visual gags, and parodies of other works. He took issue with some of Viz&#x27;s English translation decisions, not enjoying the amount of American slang used and feeling that terms such as &quot;Oni&quot; and &quot;Karasutengu&quot; should have been left untranslated, but acknowledged its improvement over their original 1990s translation. In a critical review of the first volume, Elias Rosner of &quot;Multiversity Comics&quot; praised her clear artwork, facial expressions and comedic timing for slapstick comedy, and stated &quot;In spite of Takahashi’s always lively artwork and sharp eye for slapstick, &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; is not for everyone. Volume 1 does a brilliant job of introducing the absurdity of the world and the endearing obnoxiousness of its characters. Considering this work debuted over 40 years ago, the ways in which it has remained strong should be commended and fans of Takahashi’s works will enjoy seeing her journey as a storyteller, which has only begun in here&quot;.

==Influence and legacy==
The series has been credited by Jonathan Clements in &quot;Schoolgirl Milky Crisis: Adventures in the Anime and Manga Trade&quot; as influencing multiple other &quot;geek gets girl&quot; works including &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; and &quot;Love Hina&quot;. Tokyo Movie Shinsha produced the series &quot;Galaxy High School&quot; for CBS as an attempt to create a similar series for the American market. The school scenario is reversed to be based around humans attending a high school for aliens.

In 1993, a band from Glasgow formed under the name &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; as a tribute. A life-size bronze statue of Lum was erected at Ōizumi-gakuen Station in 2015.

==Use of Japanese culture==
The series is considered an excellent source for references to Japanese culture and mythology. The manga makes heavy use of Japanese literature, folklore, history and pop culture. Examples of literature and folklore include &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; and Urashima Tarō. Many of the characters in the series are derived from mythological creatures. In some cases the creatures themselves appeared, and in other cases a character was designed to incorporate the characteristics of a mythological creature.

Stories and situations made use of these mythological elements to create jokes and draw comparisons with the original mythology. For example, the Oni choose tag to decide their contest with Earth because the Japanese word for Tag, &quot;Onigokko&quot;, means &quot;game of the Oni&quot;. When Ataru grabs Lum&#x27;s horns during their contest and she misunderstands his statement that he can get married, it is a reference to the myth that grabbing the horns of an Oni will make your dream come true.

<text>Robert D. Van Valin Jr. (born February 1, 1952) is an American linguist and the principal researcher behind the development of Role and Reference Grammar, a functional theory of grammar encompassing syntax, semantics, and discourse pragmatics. His 1997 book (with Randy J. LaPolla) &quot;Syntax: structure, meaning and function&quot; is an attempt to provide a model for syntactic analysis which is just as relevant for languages like Dyirbal and Lakhota as it is for more commonly studied Indo-European languages.

Instead of positing a rich innate and universal syntactic structure (see Universal Grammar), Van Valin suggests that the only truly universal parts of a sentence are its nucleus, housing a predicating element such as a verb or adjective, and the core of the clause, containing the arguments, normally noun phrases, or adpositional phrases, that the predicate in the nucleus requires. Van Valin also departs from Chomskyan syntactic theory by not allowing abstract underlying forms or transformational rules and derivations.

==Biography==

Van Valin received a BA in Linguistics from UC San Diego (1973) and a PhD in Linguistics from UC Berkeley (1977). He has taught at the University of Arizona, Temple University, UC Davis, and the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, where he served as department chair for 15 years. He is currently on leave from Buffalo and is Professor of General Linguistics at the Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf, Germany. He has been a visiting researcher at the Australian National University and at the Max Planck Institutes for Psycholinguistics and for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences. He has been awarded a NSF Graduate Fellowship, a Research Award for Outstanding Scholars from Outside of Germany from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (2006) and a Max Planck Fellowship at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics (2008–2013). He has been an Assistant Editor for Language (1991–1993) and has served on the LSA Program Committee (1994–1996), chairing the committee in 1996 and taught at the LSA Summer Institutes at UC Berkeley in 2009 and at University of Colorado in 2011.

He has also been a visiting faculty member at Stanford University, the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Sonora, and the University of Zagreb.

==Work==

Van Valin&#x27;s research areas are syntactic theory, (neuro) cognitive aspects of language, including acquisition and sentence processing, and language typology. He has done research on two American Indian languages, Lakhota (Siouan) and Yateé Zapotec (Oto-Manguean), and has supervised research on a number of endangered languages. These themes are woven together in his work in Role and Reference Grammar. He had an NSF-funded research project with Daniel Everett on information structure in Amazonian languages from 2003–2006. Currently, he is project director and co-project director on two projects (B01, D04) in Cooperative Research Center 991 The structure of representations in language, cognition and science funded by the German Science Foundation (2015–2019).

He has published eight books: 
Functional Syntax and Universal Grammar, 
Advances in Role and Reference Grammar, 
Syntax: Structure, Meaning and Function, 
An Introduction to Syntax, 
Exploring the Syntax-Semantics Interface, 
Investigations of the Syntax-Semantics-Pragmatics Interface,
Information Structuring of Spoken Language from a Cross-Linguistic Perspective, Nominal anchoring: Specificity, definiteness and article systems across languages,
and, The Cambridge Handbook of Role and Reference Grammar, 

He has more than 100 publications. He is the general editor of the Oxford Surveys in Syntax and Morphology series (Oxford UP) and serves on numerous editorial and advisory boards.

<text>New Musical Express (NME) is a British music, film, gaming, and culture website and brand. Founded as a newspaper in 1952, with the publication being referred to as a &quot;rock inkie&quot;, the &quot;NME&quot; would become a magazine that ended up as a free publication, before becoming an online brand which includes its website and radio stations.

As a &quot;rock inkie&quot;, &quot;NME&quot; was the first British newspaper to include a singles chart, adding that feature in the edition of 14 November 1952. In the 1970s, it became the best-selling British music newspaper. From 1972 to 1976, it was particularly associated with gonzo journalism then became closely associated with punk rock through the writings of Julie Burchill, Paul Morley, and Tony Parsons. It started as a music newspaper, and gradually moved toward a magazine format during the 1980s and 1990s, changing from newsprint in 1998.

The magazine&#x27;s website NME.com was launched in 1996, and became the world&#x27;s biggest standalone music site, with over sixteen million users per month. With newsstand sales falling across the UK magazine sector in the early 21st century, the magazine&#x27;s paid circulation in the first half of 2014 was 15,830. In September 2015, the &quot;NME&quot; magazine was relaunched to be distributed nationally as a free publication. The first average circulation published in February 2016 of 307,217 copies per week was the highest in the brand&#x27;s history, beating the previous best of 306,881, recorded in 1964 at the height of the Beatles&#x27; fame. By December 2017, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, average distribution of &quot;NME&quot; had fallen to 289,432 copies a week, although its then-publisher Time Inc. UK claimed to have more than 13 million global unique users per month, including 3 million in the UK. In March 2018, the publisher announced that the print edition of &quot;NME&quot; would cease publication after 66 years and become an online-only publication. However, this decision was reversed in 2023, with &quot;NME&quot; announcing that it would revive its print magazine as a bimonthly release.

&quot;NME&quot; was acquired in 2019 by Singaporean music company BandLab Technologies, which put all of its music publications under the NME Networks brand in December 2021, when the company was restructured.

==History==
The paper was established in 1952. The &quot;Accordion Times and Musical Express&quot; was bought by London music promoter Maurice Kinn for £1,000, just 15 minutes before it was due to be officially closed. It was relaunched as the &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, and was initially published in a non-glossy tabloid format on standard newsprint. Under the editorship of Ray Sonin, the paper began publishing artist interviews, industry gossip and, on 14 November 1952, taking its cue from the US magazine &quot;Billboard&quot;, it created the first UK Singles Chart, a list of the Top Twelve best-selling singles. Sales of the magazine jumped by 50%. The first of these singles charts was, in contrast to more recent charts, a top twelve sourced by the magazine itself from sales in regional stores around the UK. The first number one was &quot;Here in My Heart&quot; by Al Martino.

===1960s===
During the 1960s, the paper championed the new British groups emerging at the time. The &quot;NME&quot; circulation peaked under Andy Gray (editor 1957–1972) with a figure of 306,881 for the period from January to June 1964. The Beatles and the Rolling Stones were frequently featured on the front cover. These and other artists also appeared at the NME Poll Winners&#x27; Concert, an awards event that featured artists voted as most popular by the paper&#x27;s readers. The concert also featured a ceremony where the poll winners would collect their awards. The NME Poll Winners&#x27; Concerts took place between 1959 and 1972. From 1964 onwards, they were filmed, edited, and transmitted on British television a few weeks after they had taken place.

In the mid-1960s, the &quot;NME&quot; was primarily dedicated to pop while its older rival, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, was known for its more serious coverage of music. Other competing titles included &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, which led the way in championing American rhythm and blues, and &quot;Disc&quot;, which focused on chart news. The latter part of the decade the paper charted the rise of psychedelia and the continued dominance of British groups of the time. During this period some sections of pop music began to be designated as rock. The paper became engaged in a sometimes tense rivalry with &quot;Melody Maker&quot;; however, &quot;NME&quot; sales were healthy, with the paper selling as many as 200,000 issues per week, making it one of the UK&#x27;s biggest sellers at the time.

===1970s===
By the early 1970s, &quot;NME&quot; had lost ground to &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, as its coverage of music had failed to keep pace with the development of rock music, particularly during the early years of psychedelia and progressive rock. In early 1972, the paper was on the verge of closure by its owner IPC (which had bought the paper from Kinn in 1963). According to Nick Kent (soon to play a prominent part in the paper&#x27;s revival):

After sales had plummeted to 60,000 and a review of guitar instrumentalist Duane Eddy had been printed which began with the words &quot;On this, his 35th album, we find Duane in as good voice as ever,&quot; the &quot;NME&quot; had been told to rethink its policies or die on the vine.

Alan Smith was made editor in 1972, and was told by IPC to turn things around quickly or face closure. To achieve this, Smith and his assistant editor Nick Logan raided the underground press for writers such as Charles Shaar Murray and Nick Kent, and recruited other writers such as Tony Tyler, Ian MacDonald and Californian Danny Holloway. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; &quot;started to champion underground, up-and-coming music...NME became the gateway to a more rebellious world. First came glamrock, and bands such as T. Rex, and then came punk...by 1977 it had become the place to keep in touch with a cultural revolution that was enthralling the nation&#x27;s listless youth. Bands such as Sex Pistols, X-Ray Spex and Generation X were regular cover stars, eulogised by writers such as Julie Burchill and Tony Parsons, whose nihilistic tone narrated the punk years perfectly.&quot; By the time Smith handed the editor&#x27;s chair to Logan in mid-1973, the paper was selling nearly 300,000 copies per week and was outstripping &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;Disc&quot;, &quot;Record Mirror&quot; and &quot;Sounds&quot;.

According to MacDonald:

I think all the other papers knew by 1974 that &quot;NME&quot; had become the best music paper in Britain. We had most of the best writers and photographers, the best layouts, that sense of style of humour and a feeling of real adventure. We also set out to beat &quot;Melody Maker&quot; on its strong suit: being the serious, responsible journal of record. We did Looking Back and Consumer Guide features that beat the competition out of sight, and we did this not just to surpass our rivals but because we reckoned that rock had finished its first wind around 1969/70 and deserved to be treated as history, as a canon of work. We wanted to see where we&#x27;d got to, sort out this huge amount of stuff that had poured out since the mid &#x27;60s. Everyone on the paper was into this.

Led Zeppelin topped the &quot;&quot;NME&quot; Pop Poll&quot; for three consecutive years (1974–76) under the category of the best &quot;Vocal Group&quot;.

In 1976, &quot;NME&quot; lambasted German pioneer electronic band Kraftwerk with this title: &quot;This is what your fathers fought to save you from ...&quot; The article said that the &quot;electronic melodies flowed as slowly as a piece of garbage floating down the polluted Rhine&quot;. The same year also saw punk rock arrive on what some people perceived to be a stagnant music scene. The &quot;NME&quot; gave the Sex Pistols their first music press coverage in a live review of their performance at the Marquee in February that year, but overall it was slow to cover this new phenomenon in comparison to &quot;Sounds&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, where Jonh Ingham and Caroline Coon respectively were early champions of punk. Although articles by the likes of Mick Farren (whose article &quot;The Titanic Sails at Dawn&quot; called for a new street-led rock movement in response to stadium rock) were published by the &quot;NME&quot; that summer, it was felt that younger writing was needed to credibly cover the emerging punk movement, and the paper advertised for a pair of &quot;hip young gunslingers&quot; to join their editorial staff. This resulted in the recruitment of Tony Parsons and Julie Burchill. The pair rapidly became champions of the punk scene and created a new tone for the paper. Parsons&#x27; time at NME is reflected in his 2005 novel &quot;Stories We Could Tell&quot;, about the misadventures of three young music-paper journalists on the night of 16 August 1977 – the night Elvis Presley died.

In 1978, Logan moved on, and his deputy Neil Spencer was made editor. One of his earliest tasks was to oversee a redesign of the paper by Barney Bubbles, which included the logo still used on the paper&#x27;s masthead today (albeit in a modified form) – this made its first appearance towards the end of 1978. Spencer&#x27;s time as editor also coincided with the emergence of post-punk acts such as Joy Division and Gang of Four. This development was reflected in the writing of Ian Penman and Paul Morley. Danny Baker, who began as an &quot;NME&quot; writer around this time, had a more straightforward and populist style.

The paper also became more openly political during the time of punk. Its cover would sometimes feature youth-orientated issues rather than a musical act. It took an editorial stance against political parties like the National Front. With the election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979, the paper took a broadly socialist stance for much of the following decade.

===1980s===
In the 1980s, the &quot;NME&quot; became the most important music paper in the country. It released the influential &quot;C81&quot; in 1981, in conjunction with Rough Trade Records, available to readers by mail order at a low price. The tape featured a number of then up-and-coming bands, including Duran Duran, Aztec Camera, Orange Juice, Linx, and Scritti Politti, as well as a number of more established artists such as Robert Wyatt, Pere Ubu, the Buzzcocks and Ian Dury. A second tape titled &quot;C86&quot; was released in 1986. From 1981 to 1988 the magazine released 36 cassette compilations.

The &quot;NME&quot; responded to the Thatcher era by espousing socialism through movements such as Red Wedge. In the week of the 1987 election, the paper featured an interview with the leader of the Labour Party, Neil Kinnock, who appeared on the paper&#x27;s cover. He had appeared on the cover once two years before, in April 1985.

Writers at this time included Mat Snow, Chris Bohn (known in his later years at the paper as &#x27;Biba Kopf&#x27;), Antonella Gambotto-Burke (known by her pseudonyms Antonella Black and, because of her then-dyed orange hair, Ginger Meggs), Barney Hoskyns, Paolo Hewitt, Don Watson, Danny Kelly, Steven Wells, and David Quantick.

However, sales were dropping, and by the mid-1980s, &quot;NME&quot; had hit a rough patch and was in danger of closing. During this period (now under the editorship of Ian Pye, who replaced Neil Spencer in 1985), they were split between those who wanted to write about hip hop, a genre that was relatively new to the UK, and those who wanted to stick to rock music. Sales were apparently lower when photos of hip hop artists appeared on the front and this led to the paper suffering as the lack of direction became even more apparent to readers. A number of features entirely unrelated to music appeared on the cover in this era, including a piece by William Leith on computer crime and articles by Stuart Cosgrove on such subjects as the politics of sport and the presence of American troops in Britain, with Elvis Presley appearing on the cover not for musical reasons but as a political symbol.

The &quot;NME&quot; was generally thought to be rudderless at this time, with staff pulling simultaneously in a number of directions in what came to be known as the &quot;hip-hop wars&quot;. It was haemorrhaging readers who were deserting &quot;NME&quot; in favour of Nick Logan&#x27;s two creations &quot;The Face&quot; and &quot;Smash Hits&quot;. This was brought to a head when the paper was about to publish a poster of an insert contained in the Dead Kennedys&#x27; album &quot;Frankenchrist&quot;, consisting of a painting by H.R. Giger called Penis Landscape, then a subject of an obscenity lawsuit in the US. In the summer and autumn of 1987, three senior editorial staff were sacked, including Pye, media editor Stuart Cosgrove, and art editor Joe Ewart. Former &quot;Sounds&quot; editor Alan Lewis was brought in to rescue the paper, mirroring Alan Smith&#x27;s revival a decade and a half before.

Some commented at this time that the &quot;NME&quot; had become less intellectual in its writing style and less inventive musically. Initially, &quot;NME&quot; writers themselves were ill at ease with the new regime, with most signing a letter of no confidence in Lewis shortly after he took over. However, this new direction for the &quot;NME&quot; proved to be a commercial success and the paper brought in new writers such as Andrew Collins, Andrew Harrison, Stuart Maconie, Mary Anne Hobbs and Steve Lamacq to give it a stronger identity and sense of direction. Lewis prioritised readership over editorial independence, and Mark Sinker left in 1988 after Lewis refused to print his unfavourable review of U2&#x27;s &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; (&quot;the worst album by a major band in years&quot;), replacing it with a glowing Stuart Baillie review intended to be more acceptable to readers. Initially many of the bands on the C86 tape were championed as well as the rise of gothic rock bands but new bands such as the Happy Mondays and the Stone Roses were coming out of Manchester. One scene over these years was Acid house which spawned &quot;Madchester&quot; which helped give the paper a new lease of life. By the end of the decade, Danny Kelly had replaced Lewis as editor.

===1990s===
By the end of 1990, the Madchester scene was dying off, and &quot;NME&quot; had started to report on new bands coming from the US, mainly from Seattle. These bands would form a new movement called grunge, and by far the most popular bands were Nirvana and Pearl Jam. The &quot;NME&quot; took to grunge very slowly (&quot;Sounds&quot; was the first British music paper to write about grunge with John Robb being the first to interview Nirvana. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; was more enthusiastic early on, largely through the efforts of Everett True, who had previously written for &quot;NME&quot; under the name &quot;The Legend!&quot;). For the most part, &quot;NME&quot; only became interested in grunge after &quot;Nevermind&quot; became popular. Although it still supported new British bands, the paper was dominated by American bands, as was the music scene in general.

Although the period from 1991 to 1993 was dominated by American bands like Nirvana, British bands were not ignored. The &quot;NME&quot; still covered the indie scene and was involved with a war of words with a new band called Manic Street Preachers, who were criticising the &quot;NME&quot; for what they saw as an elitist view of bands they would champion. This came to a head in 1991, when, during an interview with Steve Lamacq, Richey Edwards would confirm the band&#x27;s position by carving &quot;4real&quot; into his arm with a razor blade.

By 1992, the Madchester scene had died and along with the Manics, some new British bands were beginning to appear. Suede were quickly hailed by the paper as an alternative to the heavy grunge sound and hailed as the start of a new British music scene. Grunge, however, was still the dominant force, but the rise of new British bands would become something the paper would focus on more and more.

In 1992, the &quot;NME&quot; also had a very public dispute with Morrissey due to allegations by &quot;NME&quot;″s Dele Fadele that Morrissey had used racist lyrics and imagery. This erupted after a concert at Finsbury Park where Morrissey was seen to drape himself in a Union Jack. The series of articles (starting with Fadele&#x27;s one) which followed in the next edition of &quot;NME&quot; (featuring the story on the front cover) soured Morrissey&#x27;s relationship with the paper, and this led to Morrissey not speaking to the paper again for the next 12 years (i.e., until 2004).

Later in 1992, Steve Sutherland, previously an assistant editor of &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, was brought in as the &quot;NME&quot;″s editor to replace Danny Kelly. Andrew Collins, Stuart Maconie, Steve Lamacq, and Mary Anne Hobbs all left the &quot;NME&quot; in protest, and moved to &quot;Select&quot;; Collins, Maconie and Lamacq would all also write for &quot;Q&quot;, while Lamacq would join &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in 1997. Kelly, Collins, Maconie, Lamacq and Hobbs would all subsequently become prominent broadcasters with BBC Radio 1 as it reinvented itself under Matthew Bannister.

In April 1994, Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was found dead, a story which affected not only his fans and readers of the &quot;NME&quot;, but would see a massive change in British music. Grunge was about to be replaced by Britpop, a new genre influenced by 1960s British music and culture. The term was coined by &quot;NME&quot; after the band Blur released their album &quot;Parklife&quot; in the month of Cobain&#x27;s death. Britpop began to fill the musical and cultural void left after Cobain&#x27;s demise, and with Blur&#x27;s success and the rise of a new group from Manchester called Oasis, Britpop would continue its rise for the rest of 1994. By the end of the year, Blur and Oasis were the two biggest bands in the UK, and sales of the &quot;NME&quot; were increasing thanks to the Britpop effect. In 1995, &quot;NME&quot; covered these new bands, many of whom played the &quot;NME Stage&quot; at that year&#x27;s Glastonbury Festival, where the paper had been sponsoring the second stage at the festival since 1993. This would be its last year sponsoring the stage; subsequently, the stage would be known as the &#x27;Other Stage&#x27;.

In August 1995, Blur and Oasis planned to release singles on the same day in a mass of media publicity. Steve Sutherland put the story on the front page of the paper, and was criticised for playing up the duel between the bands. Blur won the &quot;race&quot; for the top of the charts, and the resulting fallout from the publicity led to the paper enjoying increased sales during the 1990s as Britpop became the dominant genre. After this peak, the paper experienced a slow decline as Britpop burned itself out fairly rapidly over the next few years. This left the paper directionless again, and attempts to embrace the rise of DJ culture in the late 1990s only led to the paper being criticised for not supporting rock or indie music. The paper did attempt to return to its highly politicised 1980s incarnation by running a cover story in March 1998 condemning Tony Blair, who had previously associated himself with Britpop bands such as Oasis, and this received a certain level of attention in the wider media.

Sutherland did attempt to cover newer bands, but a 1998 cover feature on the Canadian post-rock band Godspeed You! Black Emperor saw the paper dip to a sales low, and Sutherland later stated in his weekly editorial that he regretted putting them on the cover. For many, this was seen as an affront to the principles of the paper, and sales reached a low point at the turn of the millennium. From the issue of 21 March 1999, the paper was no longer printed on newsprint, and more recently, it has shifted to tabloid size with glossy colour covers.

===2000s===
In 2000, Steve Sutherland left to become brand director of the &quot;NME&quot;, and was replaced as editor by 26-year-old &quot;Melody Maker&quot; writer Ben Knowles. In the same year, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; officially merged with the &quot;NME&quot;, and many speculated the &quot;NME&quot; would be next to close, as the weekly music-magazine market was shrinking - the monthly magazine &quot;Select&quot;, which had thrived especially during the Britpop era, was closed down within a week of &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. In the early 2000s, the &quot;NME&quot; also attempted somewhat to broaden its coverage again, running cover stories on hip-hop acts such as Jay-Z and Missy Elliott, electronic musician Aphex Twin, &quot;Popstars&quot; winners Hear&#x27;say, and R&amp;B groups such as Destiny&#x27;s Child. However, as in the 1980s, these proved unpopular with much of the paper&#x27;s readership, and were soon dropped. In 2001, the &quot;NME&quot; reasserted its position as an influence in new music, and helped to introduce bands including the Strokes, the Vines, and the White Stripes.

In 2002, Conor McNicholas was appointed editor, with a new wave of photographers including Dean Chalkley, Andrew Kendall, James Looker, and Pieter Van Hattem, and a high turnover of young writers. It focused on new British bands such as the Libertines, Franz Ferdinand, Bloc Party, and the Kaiser Chiefs, which had emerged as indie music continued to grow in commercial success. Later, Arctic Monkeys became the standard-bearers of the post-Libertines crop of indie bands, being both successfully championed by the &quot;NME&quot; and receiving widespread commercial and critical success.

In December 2005, accusations were made that the &quot;NME&quot; end-of-year poll had been edited for commercial and political reasons. These criticisms were rebutted by McNicholas, who claimed that webzine Londonist.com had got hold of an early draft of the poll.

In October 2006, &quot;NME&quot; launched an Irish version of the magazine called &quot;NME Ireland&quot;. This coincided with the launch of Club NME in Dublin. Dublin-based band Humanzi was first to appear on the cover of NME Ireland. The Irish edition of the magazine could not compete with local competitors such as &quot;Hot Press&quot; therefore it was discontinued after its fourth issue in February 2007.

After the 2008 NME Award nominations, Caroline Sullivan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; criticised the magazine&#x27;s lack of diversity, saying:

In May 2008, the magazine received a redesign aimed at an older readership with a more authoritative tone. The first issue of the redesign featured a free seven-inch Coldplay vinyl single.

===2010s===
Krissi Murison was appointed editor in June 2009, launching a new redesigned NME in April 2010. The issue had 10 different covers, highlighting the broader range of music the magazine would cover, and featured Jack White, Florence and the Machine, LCD Soundsystem, Rihanna, Kasabian, Laura Marling, Foals, M.I.A., Biffy Clyro and Magnetic Man.

Murison was replaced as editor in July 2012 by Mike Williams, who had previously been the magazine&#x27;s deputy. Williams is now Editor in Chief, with full responsibility for NME&#x27;s cross platform output. Under Williams, NME has launched the NME Daily app, a new career focussed event called Lifehacks, and successfully relaunched both the &quot;NME&quot; magazine and NME&#x27;s website, NME.com.

In 2013, &quot;NME&#x27;s The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; was criticized by the media. &quot;The Guardian&quot; pointed out that Features Editor Laura Snapes included, in her top 5 &quot;greatest albums of all time&quot;, four albums from the same band which was The National. Consequence of Sound similarly observed that &quot;if Laura Snapes had her wish, the top four would all be The National albums&quot;.

===Free title===
In February 2015, it was reported that the &quot;NME&quot; was in discussions about removing the cover price and becoming a free publication. This was confirmed in July 2015.

The free NME launched on 18 September 2015, with Rihanna on the cover. Distributed nationwide via universities, retail stores and the transport network, the first circulation numbers published in February 2016 of 307, 217 copies per week were the highest in the brand&#x27;s history. Since relaunch the magazine has featured a number of high-profile international pop stars on the cover such as Coldplay, Taylor Swift, Lana Del Rey, Kanye West and Green Day alongside emerging talent like Zara Larsson, Years &amp; Years, Lady Leshurr and Christine and the Queens.

The free, pop-oriented &quot;NME&quot; magazine was praised for reconnecting NME with its target audience, and was awarded a silver at the 2016 Professional Publishers Association Awards for its historic first-ever cover as a free title, featuring Rihanna. Editor in Chief Mike Williams received the Editor Of The Year Award at the BSME Awards 2016, the judges stating that under Williams&#x27; leadership, NME had &quot;bounced back from an uncertain future and established itself confidently and creatively in a new market.&quot;

In March 2018, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that the NME was to cease publication in print after 66 years. The online publication would continue.

In 2019, TI Media, the successor to IPC, sold &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Uncut&quot; to Singaporean company BandLab Technologies.

===2020s===
In 2021, the &quot;NME&quot; became the main brand for the music publishing division of Caldecott Music Group, when BandLab Technologies was reorganised. As well as publishing print magazines in the United Kingdom and Australia, NME Networks is responsible for a trio of online music publications and the main NME.com website, which now also has an area devoted to the Asian music scene and acts such as 
The Itchyworms, SEVENTEEN, Voice Of Baceprot, Sponge Cola and I Belong To The Zoo from countries such as South Korea, the Philippines and Indonesia.

On 20 July 2023, &quot;NME&quot; announced that it would be relaunching its print magazine that summer. Starting with a July/August issue featuring D4vd, each bimonthly issue will showcase a rising musical talent. NME Networks&#x27; chief operating and commercial officer Holly Bishop explained that the company was &quot;inspired by the resurgence we&#x27;ve seen in vinyl and cassette tapes&quot; to bring a physical edition back for music fans.

==NME Australia==
In December 2018, BandLab Technologies announced the launch of NME Australia. Initially a website only, new interviews were given covers and numbered as issues, with Amyl &amp; The Sniffers on the inaugural cover. At the time BandLab announced the Australian edition would not have a local editor, and would instead be controlled by a team in London and Singapore, with content from Australian contributors.

A print edition was announced in April 2020, beginning with issue #5, following their online covers numbering. Tash Sultana became the first cover artist for the print edition, which have gone on to feature artists such as The Avalanches, Jaguar Jonze, Tkay Maidza, and Lorde on future covers.

The magazine publishes six issues each year, with new content added to the website regularly.

==NME.com==

In 1996, the &quot;NME&quot; launched its website NME.com under the stewardship of editor Steve Sutherland and publisher Robert Tame. Its first editor was Brendan Fitzgerald. Eewei Chen was the first designer of the website. Later, Anthony Thornton redesigned the site, focusing on music news. In November 1999, the site hosted the UK&#x27;s first webcast, of Suede &quot;Live in Japan&quot;. In 2001, the site gave away a free MP3 of the Strokes&#x27; single &quot;Last Nite&quot; a week before its release.

The website was awarded Online Magazine of the Year in 1999 and 2001; Anthony Thornton was awarded Website Editor of the Year on three occasions – 2001 and 2002 (British Society of Magazine Editors) and 2002 (Periodical Publishers Association).

In 2004, Ben Perreau joined NME.com as the website&#x27;s third editor. He relaunched and redeveloped the title in September 2005 and the focus was migrated towards video, audio and the wider music community. It was awarded Best Music Website at the Record of the Day awards in October 2005. In 2006, it was awarded the BT Digital Music Award for Best Music Magazine and the first chairman&#x27;s Award from the Association of Online Publishers awarded by the chairman Simon Waldman in recognition of its pioneering role in its 10-year history.

In 2007, NME.com was launched in the US with additional staff.

In October 2007, David Moynihan joined as the website&#x27;s fourth editor. In 2008, the site won the BT Digital Music Award for Best Music Magazine, plus the Association of Online Publishers&#x27; Best Editorial Team Award, the British Society of Magazine Editors Website Editor of the Year and the Record of the Day Award for Best Music Website. In June 2009, NME.com won the Periodical Publishers Association (PPA) award for Interactive Consumer Magazine of the Year. In 2010, it won both the AOP and PPA website of the year award. That same year, NME.com expanded its coverage to include movies and TV as well as music.

Luke Lewis took over as editor of NME.com in March 2011, bringing a new focus on video content and user engagement, bringing comments to the fore and introducing user ratings on reviews. In 2011, NME.com had over seven million monthly unique users (source: Omniture SiteCatalyst, 2011).

In May 2011, NME.com launched NMEVideo.com, a sister site dedicated to video, and released the NME Festivals smartphone app. Sponsored by BlackBerry, it featured line-ups, stage times, photo galleries and backstage video interviews, and was downloaded 30,000 times. The following month, NME launched its first iPad app, dedicated to Jack White.

In September 2011, NME.com organised and live-blogged a real-time Twitter listening party of Nirvana&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Nevermind&quot; to mark that album&#x27;s 20th anniversary. The site also launched a new series of self-produced band documentary films, entitled The Ultimate Guide.

In October 2011, the site celebrated its 15th birthday by publishing a list of the 150 best tracks of NME.com&#x27;s lifetime. The number one song was Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;.

In 2015, NME appointed Charlotte Gunn as digital editor, replacing Greg Cochrane. Under Gunn, NME.com doubled in size and with a focus on social and video built a sustainable future as an online only brand. Gunn was appointed Editor in March 2018, after the closure of the weekly print magazine, and left the post in February 2020.

In 2020, NME.com began its Gaming channel. NME Networks&#x27; Chief Operating and Commercial Officer Holly Bishop stated that it would include &quot;long reads, hero content, franchises, reviews and interactive streams&quot;.

==NME covers==
==NME Awards==

NME Awards is an awards show held every year to celebrate the best new music of the past year. The nominations and eventual winners are voted for by the readers of the magazine. The 2022 ceremony, branded as the BandLab NME Awards 2022, took place on 2 March 2022 at the O2 Academy Brixton.

==NME Tours==

NME sponsors a tour of the United Kingdom by up-and-coming bands each year.

==NME Originals==
In 2002, the &quot;NME&quot; started publishing a series of themed magazines reprinting vintage articles, interviews and reviews from its archives. The magazine special editions were called &quot;NME Originals&quot;, with some featuring articles from other music titles owned by IPC, including &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;Rave&quot; and &quot;Uncut&quot; magazines. Notable issues so far have featured Arctic Monkeys, Radiohead, the Beatles, punk rock, gothic rock, Britpop, the Rolling Stones, mod, Nirvana, and the solo years of the Beatles. The series has had several editors, the most prominent of whom have been Steve Sutherland and Chris Hunt. The most recent issue of NME Originals was published in 2005, as these themed archive magazines have been issued under the &quot;Uncut&quot; associated titles &quot;The Ultimate Music Guide&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Genre Guide&quot; instead.

==NME Networks==
In December 2021, BandLab Technologies became Caldecott Music Group (CMG) with the publisher&#x27;s former name now being used for CMG&#x27;s music technology division. The &quot;NME&quot; brand was put under a new division called NME Networks, which also includes Guitar.com, and &quot;MusicTech&quot;. It also formerly included &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine, until this was sold in 2023.

In 2022, NME Networks hired Jeremy Abbott as Managing Editor, a role in which he would be &quot;responsible for leading the day-to-day editorial operations for all titles such as NME, NME Asia, NME Australia, Guitar.com and MusicTech, with the aim of building and maintaining a world-class music and pop culture new media group.&quot; He departed NME Networks in 2023.

<text>A communication channel refers either to a physical transmission medium such as a wire, or to a logical connection over a multiplexed medium such as a radio channel in telecommunications and computer networking. A channel is used for information transfer of, for example, a digital bit stream, from one or several &quot;senders&quot; to one or several &quot;receivers&quot;. A channel has a certain capacity for transmitting information, often measured by its bandwidth in Hz or its data rate in bits per second.

Communicating an information signal across distance requires some form of pathway or medium. These pathways, called communication channels, use two types of media: Transmission line-based telecommunications cable (e.g. twisted-pair, coaxial, and fiber-optic cable) and broadcast (e.g. microwave, satellite, radio, and infrared).

In information theory, a channel refers to a theoretical &quot;channel model&quot; with certain error characteristics. In this more general view, a storage device is also a communication channel, which can be sent to (written) and received from (reading) and allows communication of an information signal across time.

==Examples==
Examples of communications channels include:

# A connection between initiating and terminating communication endpoints of a telecommunication circuit.
# A single path provided by a transmission medium via either
#* physical separation, such as by multipair cable or
#* separation, such as by frequency-division or time-division multiplexing.
# A path for conveying electrical or electromagnetic signals, usually distinguished from other parallel paths.
#* A data storage device which can communicate a message over time.
#* The portion of a storage medium, such as a track or band, that is accessible to a given reading or writing station or head.
#* A buffer from which messages can be &quot;put&quot; and &quot;got&quot;.
# In a communications system, the physical or logical link that connects a data source to a data sink.
# A specific radio frequency, pair or band of frequencies, usually named with a letter, number, or codeword, and often allocated by international agreement, for example:
#* Marine VHF radio uses some 88 channels in the VHF band for two-way FM voice communication. Channel 16, for example, is 156.800 MHz. In the US, seven additional channels, WX1 - WX7, are allocated for weather broadcasts.
#* Television channels such as North American TV Channel 2 at 55.25 MHz, Channel 13 at 211.25 MHz. Each channel is 6 MHz wide. This was based on the bandwidth required by analog television signals. Since 2006, television broadcasting has switched to digital modulation (digital television) which uses image compression to transmit a television signal in a much smaller bandwidth, so each of these &quot;physical channels&quot; has been divided into multiple &quot;virtual channels&quot; each carrying a DTV channel.
#* Original Wi-Fi uses 13 channels in the ISM bands from 2412 MHz to 2484 MHz in 5 MHz steps.
#* The radio channel between an amateur radio repeater and an amateur radio operator uses two frequencies often 600 kHz (0.6 MHz) apart. For example, a repeater that transmits on 146.94 MHz typically listens for a ham transmitting on 146.34 MHz.

All of these communication channels share the property that they transfer information. The information is carried through the channel by a signal.

==Channel models==
Mathematical models of the channel can be made to describe how the input (the transmitted signal) is mapped to the output (the received signal). There exist many types and uses of channel models specific to the field of communication. In particular, separate models are formulated to describe each layer of a communication system.

A channel can be modeled physically by trying to calculate the physical processes which modify the transmitted signal. For example, in wireless communications, the channel can be modeled by calculating the reflection from every object in the environment. A sequence of random numbers might also be added to simulate external interference or electronic noise in the receiver.

Statistically, a communication channel is usually modeled as a tuple consisting of an input alphabet, an output alphabet, and for each pair &quot;(i, o)&quot; of input and output elements, a transition probability &quot;p(i, o)&quot;. Semantically, the transition probability is the probability that the symbol &quot;o&quot; is received given that &quot;i&quot; was transmitted over the channel.

Statistical and physical modeling can be combined. For example, in wireless communications the channel is often modeled by a random attenuation (known as fading) of the transmitted signal, followed by additive noise. The attenuation term is a simplification of the underlying physical processes and captures the change in signal power over the course of the transmission. The noise in the model captures external interference or electronic noise in the receiver. If the attenuation term is complex it also describes the relative time a signal takes to get through the channel. The statistical properties of the attenuation in the model are determined by previous measurements or physical simulations.

Communication channels are also studied in discrete-alphabet modulation schemes. The mathematical model consists of a transition probability that specifies an output distribution for each possible sequence of channel inputs. In information theory, it is common to start with memoryless channels in which the output probability distribution only depends on the current channel input.

A channel model may either be digital or analog.

===Digital channel models===
In a digital channel model, the transmitted message is modeled as a digital signal at a certain protocol layer. Underlying protocol layers are replaced by a simplified model. The model may reflect channel performance measures such as bit rate, bit errors, delay, delay variation, etc. Examples of digital channel models include:
* Binary symmetric channel (BSC), a discrete memoryless channel with a certain bit error probability
* Binary asymmetric channel (BAC), similar to BSC but the probability of a flip from 0 to 1 and vice-versa is unequal
* Binary bursty bit error channel model, a channel &quot;with memory&quot;
* Binary erasure channel (BEC), a discrete channel with a certain bit error detection (erasure) probability
* Packet erasure channel, where packets are lost with a certain packet loss probability or packet error rate
* Arbitrarily varying channel (AVC), where the behavior and state of the channel can change randomly

===Analog channel models===
In an analog channel model, the transmitted message is modeled as an analog signal. The model can be a linear or non-linear, time-continuous or time-discrete (sampled), memoryless or dynamic (resulting in burst errors), time-invariant or time-variant (also resulting in burst errors), baseband, passband (RF signal model), real-valued or complex-valued signal model. The model may reflect the following channel impairments:
* Noise model, for example
** Additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, a linear continuous memoryless model
** Phase noise model
* Interference model, for example crosstalk (co-channel interference) and intersymbol interference (ISI)
* Distortion model, for example a non-linear channel model causing intermodulation distortion (IMD)
* Frequency response model, including attenuation and phase-shift
* Group delay model
* Modelling of underlying physical layer transmission techniques, for example a complex-valued equivalent baseband model of modulation and frequency response
* Radio frequency propagation model, for example
** Log-distance path loss model
** Fading model, for example Rayleigh fading, Ricean fading, log-normal shadow fading and frequency selective (dispersive) fading
** Doppler shift model, which combined with fading results in a time-variant system
** Ray tracing models, which attempt to model the signal propagation and distortions for specified transmitter-receiver geometries, terrain types, and antennas
** Propagation graph, models signal dispersion by representing the radio propagation environment by a graph. 
** Mobility models, which also causes a time-variant system

==Types==
* Digital (discrete) or analog (continuous) channel
* Transmission medium, for example a fiber-optic cable
* Multiplexed channel
* Computer network virtual channel
* Simplex communication, duplex communication or half-duplex communication channel
* Return channel
* Uplink or downlink (upstream or downstream channel)
* Broadcast channel, unicast channel or multicast channel

==Channel performance measures==
These are examples of commonly used channel capacity and performance measures:
* Spectral bandwidth in Hertz
* Symbol rate in baud, symbols/s
* Digital bandwidth in bit/s measures: gross bit rate (signalling rate), net bit rate (information rate), channel capacity, and maximum throughput
* Channel utilization
* Spectral efficiency
* Signal-to-noise ratio in decibel measures: signal-to-interference ratio, Eb/N0
* Bit error rate (BER), packet error rate (PER)
* Latency in seconds: propagation time, transmission time, round-trip delay, end-to-end delay
* Packet delay variation
* Eye pattern

==Multi-terminal channels, with application to cellular systems==
In networks, as opposed to point-to-point communication, the communication media can be shared between multiple communication endpoints (terminals). Depending on the type of communication, different terminals can cooperate or interfere with each other. In general, any complex multi-terminal network can be considered as a combination of simplified multi-terminal channels. The following channels are the principal multi-terminal channels first introduced in the field of information theory:
* A point-to-multipoint channel, also known as broadcasting medium (not to be confused with broadcasting channel): In this channel, a single sender transmits multiple messages to different destination nodes. All wireless channels except directional links can be considered as broadcasting media, but may not always provide broadcasting service. The downlink of a cellular system can be considered as a point-to-multipoint channel, if only one cell is considered and inter-cell co-channel interference is neglected. However, the communication service of a phone call is unicasting.
* Multiple access channel: In this channel, multiple senders transmit multiple possible different messages over a shared physical medium to one or several destination nodes. This requires a channel access scheme, including a media access control (MAC) protocol combined with a multiplexing scheme. This channel model has applications in the uplink of cellular networks.
* Relay channel: In this channel, one or several intermediate nodes (called relay, repeater or gap filler nodes) cooperate with a sender to send the message to an ultimate destination node.
* Interference channel: In this channel, two different senders transmit their data to different destination nodes. Hence, the different senders can have a possible crosstalk or co-channel interference on the signal of each other. The inter-cell interference in cellular wireless communications is an example of an interference channel. In spread-spectrum systems like 3G, interference also occurs inside the cell if non-orthogonal codes are used.
* A unicast channel is a channel that provides a unicast service, i.e. that sends data addressed to one specific user. An established phone call is an example.
* A broadcast channel is a channel that provides a broadcasting service, i.e. that sends data addressed to all users in the network. Cellular network examples are the paging service as well as the Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service.
* A multicast channel is a channel where data is addressed to a group of subscribing users. LTE examples are the physical multicast channel (PMCH) and multicast broadcast single frequency network (MBSFN).

<text>An extended play (EP) is a musical recording that contains more tracks than a single but fewer than an album. Contemporary EPs generally contain up to eight tracks and have a playing time of 15 to 30 minutes. An EP is usually less cohesive than an album and more &quot;non-committal&quot;. 

An extended play (EP) originally referred to a specific type of 45 rpm phonograph record other than 78 rpm standard play (SP) and 33 rpm long play (LP), but , also applies to mid-length CDs and downloads. EPs are considered &quot;less expensive and time-consuming&quot; for an artist to produce than an album, and have long been popular with punk and indie bands. In K-pop and J-pop, they are usually referred to as mini-albums.

==Background==
===History===
EPs were released in various sizes in different eras. The earliest multi-track records, issued around 1919 by Grey Gull Records, were vertically cut 78 rpm discs known as &quot;2-in-1&quot; records. These had finer grooves than usual, like Edison Disc Records. By 1949, when the 45 rpm single and 33 rpm LP were competing formats, 7-inch 45 rpm singles had a maximum playing time of only about four minutes per side.

Partly as an attempt to compete with the LP introduced in 1948 by rival Columbia, RCA Victor introduced &quot;Extended Play&quot; 45s during 1952. Their narrower grooves, achieved by lowering the cutting levels and sound compression optionally, enabled them to hold up to 7.5 minutes per side—but still be played by a standard 45 rpm phonograph. In the early era, record companies released the entire content of LPs as 45 rpm EPs. These were usually 10-inch (25-cm) LPs (released until the mid-1950s) split onto two 7-inch EPs or 12-inch (30-cm) LPs split onto three 7-inch EPs, either sold separately or together in gatefold covers. This practice became much less common with the advent of triple-speed-available phonographs.
Introduced by RCA in the US in 1952, EMI issued the first EPs in Britain in April 1954. EPs were typically compilations of singles or album samplers and were played at 45 rpm on 7-inch (18-cm) discs, with two songs on each side.
The manufacturing price of an EP was a little more than that of a single. Thus, they were a bargain for those who did not own the LPs from which the tracks were taken.

RCA had success in the format with Elvis Presley, issuing 28 EPs between 1956 and 1967, many of which topped the separate &quot;Billboard&quot; EP chart during its brief existence. Other than those published by RCA, EPs were relatively uncommon in the United States and Canada, but they were widely sold in the United Kingdom, and in some other European countries, during the 1950s and 1960s. In Sweden, the EP was a popular record format, with as much as 85% of the market in the late 1950s consisting of EPs.

&quot;Billboard&quot; introduced a weekly EP chart in October 1957, noting that &quot;the teen-age market apparently dominates the EP business, with seven out of the top 10 best-selling EPs featuring artists with powerful teen-age appeal — four sets by Elvis Presley, two by Pat Boone and one by Little Richard&quot;. Other publications such as &quot;Record Retailer&quot;, &quot;New Musical Express&quot; (&quot;NME&quot;), &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;Disc and Music Echo&quot; and the &quot;Record Mirror&quot; also printed EP charts. 

The popularity of EPs in the US had declined in the early 1960s in favor of LPs. In the UK, Cliff Richard and the Shadows, both individually and collectively, and the Beatles were the most prolific artists issuing EPs in the 1960s, many of them highly successful releases. The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; outsold most singles for some weeks in 1963. The success of the EP in Britain lasted until around 1967, but it later had a strong revival with punk rock in the late 1970s and the adaptation of the format for 12-inch and CD singles. The British band Cocteau Twins made prolific use of the EP format, releasing ten EPs between 1982 and 1995. Typically used for the CD Single, some bands like The Locust made use of the 8cm/3&quot; CD format to release EPs, including their 1997 self-titled EP. 

In the Philippines, seven-inch EPs marketed as &quot;mini-LPs&quot; (but distinctly different from the mini-LPs of the 1980s) were introduced in 1970, with tracks selected from an album and packaging resembling the album they were taken from. This mini-LP format also became popular in America in the early 1970s for promotional releases, and also for use in jukeboxes.

In 2010, Warner Bros. Records revived the format with their &quot;Six-Pak&quot; offering of six songs on a compact disc.

===EPs in the digital and streaming era===
Due to the increased popularity of music downloads and music streaming beginning in the late 2000s, EPs have become a common marketing strategy for pop musicians wishing to remain relevant and deliver music in more consistent timeframes leading to or following full studio albums. In the late 2000s to early 2010s, reissues of studio albums with expanded track listings were common, with the new music often being released as stand-alone EPs. In October 2010, a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article regarding the trend noted post-album EPs as &quot;the next step in extending albums&#x27; shelf lives, following the &quot;deluxe&quot; editions that populated stores during the past few holiday seasons—add a few tracks to the back end of an album and release one of them to radio, slap on a new coat of paint, and—voila!—a stocking stuffer is born.&quot; Examples of such releases include Lady Gaga&#x27;s &quot;The Fame Monster&quot; (2009) following her debut album &quot;The Fame&quot; (2008), and Kesha&#x27;s &quot;Cannibal&quot; (2010) following her debut album &quot;Animal&quot; (2010).

A 2019 article in &quot;Forbes&quot; discussing Miley Cyrus&#x27; plan to release her then-upcoming seventh studio album as a trilogy of EPs, beginning with &quot;She Is Coming&quot;, stated: &quot;By delivering a trio of EPs throughout a period of several months, Miley is giving her fans more of what they want, only in smaller doses. When an artist drops an album, they run the risk of it being forgotten in a few weeks, at which point they need to start work on the follow-up, while still promoting and touring their recent effort. Miley is doing her best to game the system by recording an album and delivering it to fans in pieces.&quot; However, this release strategy was later scrapped in favor of the conventional album release of &quot;Plastic Hearts&quot;. Major-label pop musicians who had previously employed such release strategies include Colbie Caillat with her fifth album &quot;Gypsy Heart&quot; (2014) being released following an EP of the album&#x27;s first five tracks known as &quot;Gypsy Heart: Side A&quot; three months prior to the full album; and Jessie J&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;R.O.S.E.&quot; (2018) which was released as four EPs in as many days entitled &quot;R (Realisations)&quot;, &quot;O (Obsessions)&quot;, &quot;S (Sex)&quot; and &quot;E (Empowerment)&quot;.

==Definition==
The first EPs were seven-inch vinyl records with more tracks than a normal single (typically four of them). Although they shared size and speed with singles, they were a recognizably different format than the seven-inch single. Although they could be named after a lead track, they were generally given a different title. Examples include the Beatles&#x27; &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Hits&quot; EP from 1963, and the Troggs&#x27; &quot;Troggs Tops&quot; EP from 1966, both of which collected previously released tracks. The playing time was generally between 10 and 15 minutes. In the UK they came in cardboard picture sleeves at a time when singles were usually issued in paper company sleeves. EPs tended to be album samplers or collections of singles. EPs of all original material began to appear in the 1950s. Examples are Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; from 1956 and &quot;Just for You&quot;, &quot;Peace in the Valley&quot; and &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; from 1957, and the Kinks&#x27; &quot;Kinksize Session&quot; from 1964.

Twelve-inch EPs were similar, but generally had between three and five tracks and a length of over 12 minutes. Like seven-inch EPs, these were given titles. EP releases were also issued in cassette and 10-inch vinyl formats. With the advent of the compact disc (CD), more music was often included on &quot;single&quot; releases, with four or five tracks being common, and playing times of up to 25 minutes. These extended-length singles became known as maxi singles and while commensurate in length to an EP were distinguished by being designed to feature a single song, with the remaining songs considered B-sides, whereas an EP was designed not to feature a single song, instead resembling a mini album.

EPs of original material regained popularity in the punk rock era, when they were commonly used for the release of new material, e.g. Buzzcocks&#x27; &quot;Spiral Scratch&quot; EP.

Ricardo Baca of &quot;The Denver Post&quot; said in 2010, &quot;EPs—originally extended-play &#x27;single&#x27; releases that are shorter than traditional albums—have long been popular with punk and indie bands.&quot;

Contemporary EPs generally contain up to eight tracks.

In the United States, the Recording Industry Association of America, the organization that declares releases &quot;gold&quot; or &quot;platinum&quot; based on numbers of sales, defines an EP as containing three to five songs or under 30 minutes. On the other hand, The Recording Academy&#x27;s rules for Grammy Awards state that any release with five or more different songs and a running time of over 15 minutes is considered an album, with no mention of EP.

In the United Kingdom, an EP can appear either on the album or the single chart. The Official Chart Company classifies any record with more than four tracks (not counting alternative versions of featured songs, if present) or with a playing time of more than 25 minutes as an album for sales-chart purposes. If priced as a single, they will not qualify for the main album chart but can appear in the separate Budget Albums chart.

An intermediate format between EPs and full-length LPs is the mini-LP, which was a common album format in the 1980s. These generally contained 20–30 minutes of music and about seven tracks.

==Double EPs==

A double extended play is a name typically given to vinyl records or compact discs released as a set of two discs, each of which would normally qualify as an EP. The name is thus analogous to double album. As vinyl records, the most common format for the double EP, they consist of a pair of 7-inch discs recorded at 45 or 33 rpm, or two 12-inch discs recorded at 45 rpm. The format is useful when an album&#x27;s worth of material is being pressed by a small plant geared for the production of singles rather than albums and may have novelty value which can be turned to advantage for publicity purposes. Double EPs are rare, since the amount of material record-able on a double EP could usually be more economically and sensibly recorded on a single vinyl LP.

In the 1950s, Capitol Records had released a number of double EPs by its more popular artists, including Les Paul. The pair of double EPs (EBF 1–577, sides 1 to 8) were described on the original covers as &quot;parts ... of a four-part album&quot;. In 1960, Joe Meek released four tracks from his planned &quot;I Hear a New World&quot; LP on an EP that was marked &quot;Part 1&quot;. A second EP was planned, but never appeared; only the sleeve was printed. The first double EP released in Britain was the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; film soundtrack. Released in December 1967 on EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label, it contained six songs spread over two 7-inch discs and was packaged with a lavish color booklet. In the United States and some other countries, the songs were augmented by the band&#x27;s single A- and B-sides from 1967 to create a full LP –a practice that was common in the US but considered exploitative in the UK. The Style Council album &quot;The Cost of Loving&quot; was originally issued as two 12-inch EPs.

It is more common for artists to release two 12-inch 45s rather than a single 12-inch LP. Though there are 11 songs that total about 40 minutes, enough for one LP, the songs are spread across two 12&quot; 45 rpm discs. Also, the vinyl pressing of &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; by Radiohead uses this practice but is considered to be a full-length album. In 1982 Cabaret Voltaire released their studio album &quot;2x45&quot; on the UK-based label Rough Trade, featuring extended tracks over four sides of two 12-inch 45 rpm discs, with graphics by artist Neville Brody. The band subsequently released a further album in this format, 1985&#x27;s &quot;Drinking Gasoline&quot;, on the Virgin Records label.

Double EPs can also contain the work of multiple artists split across different sides, akin to split albums. An example of this is the &quot;Dunedin Double&quot; EP, which contains tracks by four different bands. Using a double EP in this instance allowed each band to have its tracks occupying a different side. In addition, the groove on the physical record could be wider and thus allow for a louder album.

==Jukebox EP==

In the 1960s and 1970s, record companies released EP versions of long-play (LP) albums for use in jukeboxes. These were commonly known as &quot;compact 33s&quot; or &quot;little LPs&quot;. The jukebox EP was played at 33 rpm, was pressed on seven-inch vinyl and frequently had as many as six songs. What made it EP-like was that some songs were omitted for time purposes, and the most popular tracks were left on. Unlike most EPs before them, and most seven-inch vinyl in general (pre-1970s), these were issued in stereo.

<text>A numbers station is a shortwave radio station characterized by broadcasts of formatted numbers, which are believed to be addressed to intelligence officers operating in foreign countries. Most identified stations use speech synthesis to vocalize numbers, although digital modes such as phase-shift keying and frequency-shift keying, as well as Morse code transmissions, are not uncommon. Most stations have set time schedules, or schedule patterns; however, some appear to have no discernible pattern and broadcast at random times. Stations may have set frequencies in the high-frequency band.

Numbers stations have been reported since at least the start of World War I and continue in use today. Amongst amateur radio enthusiasts there is an interest in monitoring and classifying numbers stations, with many being given nicknames to represent their quirks or origins.

==History==
According to the notes of &quot;The Conet Project&quot;, which has compiled recordings of these transmissions, number stations have been reported since with the numbers transmitted in Morse code. It is reported that Archduke Anton of Austria in his youth during World War I used to listen in to their transmissions, writing them down and passing them on to the Austrian military intelligence.

Numbers stations were most abundant during the Cold War era. According to an internal Cold War-era report of the Polish Ministry of the Interior, numbers stations DCF37 (3.370 MHz) and DFD21 (4.010 MHz) were transmitted from West Germany beginning in the early 1950s.

Many stations from this era continue to broadcast and some long-time stations may have been taken over by different operators. The Czech Ministry of the Interior and the Swedish Security Service have both acknowledged the use of numbers stations by Czechoslovakia for espionage, with declassified documents proving the same. Few QSL responses have been received from numbers stations by shortwave listeners who sent reception reports to stations that identified themselves or to entities the listeners believed responsible for the broadcasts, which is the expected behaviour of a non-clandestine station.

One well-known numbers station was the E03 &quot;Lincolnshire Poacher&quot;, which is thought to have been run by the British Secret Intelligence Service. It was first broadcast from Bletchley Park in the mid-1970s but later was broadcast from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus. It ceased broadcasting in 2008.

In 2001, the United States tried the Cuban Five on the charge of spying for Cuba. The group had received and decoded messages that had been broadcast from the &quot;Atención&quot; number station in Cuba.

=== Atención spy case ===
The &quot;Atención&quot; station of Cuba became the world&#x27;s first numbers station to be officially and publicly accused of transmitting to spies. It was the centerpiece of a United States federal court espionage trial, following the arrest of the Wasp Network of Cuban spies in 1998. The U.S. prosecutors claimed the accused were writing down number codes received from Atención, using Sony hand-held shortwave receivers, and typing the numbers into laptop computers to decode spying instructions. The FBI testified that they had entered a spy&#x27;s apartment in 1995, and copied the computer decryption program for the Atención numbers code. They used it to decode Atención spy messages, which the prosecutors unveiled in court.

The United States government&#x27;s evidence included the following three examples of decoded Atención messages.

* &quot;prioritize and continue to strengthen friendship with Joe and Dennis&quot;
* &quot;Under no circumstances should [agents] German nor Castor fly with BTTR or another organization on days 24, 25, 26 and 27.&quot; (BTTR is the anti-Castro airborne group Brothers to the Rescue)
* &quot;Congratulate all the female comrades for International Day of the Woman.&quot;

The moderator of an e-mail list for global numbers station hobbyists claimed that &quot;Someone on the Spooks list had already cracked the code for a repeated transmission [from Havana to Miami] if it was received garbled.&quot; Such code-breaking may be possible if a one-time pad decoding key is used more than once. If used properly, however, the code cannot be broken.

=== Recent cases ===
In 2001, Ana Belén Montes, a senior US Defense Intelligence Agency analyst, was arrested and charged with espionage. The federal prosecutors alleged that Montes was able to communicate with the Cuban Intelligence Directorate through encoded messages, with instructions being received through &quot;encrypted shortwave transmissions from Cuba&quot;.

In 2006, Carlos Alvarez and his wife, Elsa, were arrested and charged with espionage. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida stated that &quot;defendants would receive assignments via shortwave radio transmissions&quot;.

In June 2009, the United States similarly charged Walter Kendall Myers with conspiracy to spy for Cuba, and receiving and decoding messages broadcast from a numbers station operated by the Cuban Intelligence Directorate to further that conspiracy. As discovered by the FBI up to 2010, one way that Russian agents of the Illegals Program were receiving instructions was via coded messages on shortwave radio.
It has been reported that the United States has used number stations to communicate encoded information to persons in other countries. There are also claims that State Department-operated stations, such as KKN50 and KKN44, used to broadcast similar &quot;numbers&quot; messages or related traffic, although these radio stations have been off the air for many years.

North Korea revived number broadcasts in July 2016 after a hiatus of sixteen years, a move which some analysts speculated was psychological war; sixteen such broadcasts occurred in 2017, including unusually timed transmissions in April.

== Suspected use for espionage ==

It has long been speculated, and was argued in one court case, that these stations operate as a simple and fool-proof method for government agencies to communicate with spies working undercover. According to this hypothesis, the messages must have been encrypted with a one-time pad to avoid any risk of decryption by the enemy. Writing in 2008, Wallace &amp; Melton described how numbers stations could be used in this way for espionage:

:The one-way voice link (OWVL) described a covert communications system that transmitted messages to an agent&#x27;s unmodified shortwave radio using the high-frequency shortwave bands between at a predetermined time, date, and frequency contained in their communications plan.
: The transmissions were contained in a series of repeated random number sequences and could only be deciphered using the agent&#x27;s one-time pad. If proper tradecraft was practised and instructions were precisely followed, an OWVL transmission was considered unbreakable. As long as the agent&#x27;s cover could justify possessing a shortwave radio and he was not under technical surveillance, high-frequency OWVL was a secure and preferred system for the CIA during the Cold War.

Evidence to support this theory includes the fact that numbers stations have changed details of their broadcasts or produced special, nonscheduled broadcasts coincident with extraordinary political events, such as the attempted coup of August 1991 in the Soviet Union.

A 1998 article in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; quoted a spokesperson for the Department of Trade and Industry (the government department that, at that time, regulated radio broadcasting in the United Kingdom) as saying
: &quot;These [numbers stations] are what you suppose they are. People shouldn&#x27;t be mystified by them. They are not for, shall we say, public consumption.&quot;

== Formats ==

Generally, numbers stations follow a basic format, although there are many differences in details between stations. Transmissions usually begin on the hour or half-hour.

The prelude, introduction, or call-up of a transmission (from which stations&#x27; informal nicknames are often derived) includes some kind of identifier, for the station itself, the intended recipient, or both. This can take the form of numeric or radio-alphabet &quot;code names&quot; (e.g. &quot;Charlie India Oscar&quot;, &quot;250 250 250&quot;, &quot;Six-Niner-Zero-Oblique-Five-Four&quot;), characteristic phrases (e.g. &quot;¡Atención!&quot;, &quot;Achtung!&quot;, &quot;Ready? Ready?&quot;, &quot;1234567890&quot;), and sometimes musical or electronic sounds (e.g. &quot;The Lincolnshire Poacher&quot;, &quot;Magnetic Fields&quot;). Sometimes, as in the case of radio-alphabet stations, the prelude can also signify the nature or priority of the message to follow (e.g., it may indicate that no message follows). Often the prelude repeats for a period before the body of the message begins.

After the prelude, there is usually an announcement of the number of number-groups in the message, the page to be used from the one-time pad, or other pertinent information. The groups are then recited. Groups are usually either four or five digits or radio-alphabet letters. The groups are typically repeated, either by reading each group twice or by repeating the entire message as a whole.

Some stations send more than one message during a transmission. In this case, some or all of the above process is repeated, with different contents.

Finally, after all the messages have been sent, the station will sign off in some characteristic fashion. Usually, it will simply be some form of the word &quot;end&quot; in whatever language the station uses (e.g., &quot;End of message; End of transmission&quot;, &quot;Ende&quot;, &quot;Fini&quot;, &quot;Final&quot;, &quot;конец&quot;). Some stations, especially those thought to originate from the former Soviet Union, end with a series of zeros, e.g., &quot;00000&quot; &quot;000 000&quot;; others end with music or other sounds.

Because of the secretive nature of the messages, the cryptographic function employed by particular stations is not publicly known, except in one (or possibly two) cases. It is assumed that most stations use a one-time pad that would make the contents of these number groups indistinguishable from randomly generated numbers or digits. In one confirmed case, West Germany did use a one-time pad for numbers transmissions.

== Transmission technology ==
High-frequency radio signals transmitted at relatively low power can travel around the world under ideal propagation conditions – which are affected by local RF noise levels, weather, season, and sunspots – and can then be best received with a properly tuned antenna (of adequate, possibly conspicuous size) and a good receiver.

Although few numbers stations have been tracked down by location, the technology used to transmit the numbers has historically been clear—stock shortwave transmitters using powers from 10kW to 100kW.

Amplitude modulated (AM) transmitters with optionally–variable frequency, using class-C power output stages with plate modulation, are the workhorses of international shortwave broadcasting, including numbers stations.

Application of spectrum analysis to numbers station signals has revealed the presence of data bursts, radioteletype-modulated subcarriers, phase-shifted carriers, and other unusual transmitter modulations like polytones. (RTTY-modulated subcarriers were also present on some U.S. commercial radio transmissions during the Cold War.)
The frequently reported use of high-tech modulations like data bursts, in combination or in sequence with spoken numbers, suggests varying transmissions for differing intelligence operations.

Those receiving the signals often have to work only with available hand-held receivers, sometimes under difficult local conditions, and in all reception conditions (such as sunspot cycles and seasonal static). However, in the field low-tech spoken number transmissions continue to have advantages even in the 21st century. High-tech data-receiving equipment can be difficult to obtain and even a non-standard civilian shortwave radio can be difficult to obtain in a totalitarian state. Being caught with just a shortwave radio has a degree of plausible deniability, for example, that no spying is being conducted.

== Interference ==

=== Interfering with other broadcasts ===
The North Korean foreign language service Voice of Korea began to broadcast on the E03 Lincolnshire Poacher&#x27;s former frequency, 11545 kHz, in 2006, possibly to deliberately interfere with its propagation. However, Lincolnshire Poacher broadcasts on three different frequencies, and the remaining two have not been interfered with. The apparent target zone for the Lincolnshire Poacher signals originating in Cyprus was the Middle East, not the Far East, which is covered by its sister station, E03a Cherry Ripe.

On 27 September 2006, amateur radio transmissions in the 30 m band were affected by an S06 &quot;Russian Man&quot; numbers station at 17:40 UTC.

In October 1990, it was reported that a numbers station had been interfering with communications on 6577 kHz, a frequency used by air traffic in the Caribbean. The interference was such that on at least one monitored transmission, it blocked the channel entirely and forced the air traffic controller to switch the pilot to an alternative frequency.

A BBC frequency, 7325 kHz, has also been used. This prompted a letter to the BBC from a listener in Andorra. She wrote to the World Service &quot;Waveguide&quot; programme in 1983 complaining that her listening had been spoiled by a female voice reading out numbers in English and asked the announcer what this interference was. The BBC presenter laughed at the suggestion of spy activity. He had consulted the experts at Bush House (BBC World Service headquarters), who declared that the voice was reading out nothing more sinister than snowfall figures for the ski slopes near the listener&#x27;s home. After more research into this case, shortwave enthusiasts are fairly certain that this was a numbers station being broadcast on a random frequency.

The Cuban numbers station &quot;HM01&quot; has been known to interfere with shortwave broadcaster Voice of Welt on 11530 kHz.

=== Attempted jamming ===
Numbers station transmissions have often been the target of intentional jamming attempts. Despite this targeting, many numbers stations continue to broadcast unhindered. Historical examples of jamming include the E10 (a station thought to originate from Israel&#x27;s Mossad intelligence agency) being jammed by the &quot;Chinese Music Station&quot; (thought to originate from the People&#x27;s Republic of China and usually used to jam &quot;Sound of Hope&quot; radio broadcasts which are anti-CCP in nature).

== Identification and classification ==
Monitoring and chronicling transmissions from numbers stations has been a hobby for shortwave and ham radio enthusiasts from as early as the 1970s. Numbers stations are often given nicknames by enthusiasts, often reflecting some distinctive element of the station such as the interval signal. For example, the &quot;Lincolnshire Poacher&quot; station played the first two bars of the folk song &quot;The Lincolnshire Poacher&quot; before each string of numbers. Sometimes these traits have helped to uncover the broadcast location of a station. The &quot;Atención&quot; station was thought to be from Cuba, because a supposed error allowed Radio Havana Cuba to be carried on the frequency.

Although many numbers stations have nicknames which usually describe some aspect of the station itself, these nicknames have sometimes led to confusion among listeners, particularly when discussing stations with similar traits. M. Gauffman of the ENIGMA numbers stations monitoring group originally assigned a code to each known station.

Portions of the original ENIGMA group moved on to other interests in 2000 and the classification of numbers stations was continued by the follow-on group ENIGMA 2000. The document containing the description of each station and its code designation was called the &quot;ENIGMA Control List&quot; until 2016, after which it was incorporated into the &quot;ENIGMA 2000 Active Station List&quot;; the latest edition of the list was published in September 2017. This classification scheme takes the form of a letter followed by a number (or, in the case of some &quot;X&quot; stations, more numbers). The letter indicates the language used by the station in question:
* E indicates a station broadcasting in English.
* G indicates a station broadcasting in German.
* S indicates a station broadcasting in a Slavic language.
* V indicates all other languages.
* M is a station broadcasting in Morse code.
* X indicates all other transmissions, such as polytones, in addition to some unexplained broadcasts which may not actually be numbers stations.

There are also a few other stations with a specific classification:
* SK: Digital mode
* HM: Hybrid mode
* DP: Digital-pseudo polytone

Some stations have also been stripped of their designation when they were discovered not to be a numbers station. This was the case for E22, which was discovered in 2005 to be test transmissions for All India Radio.
