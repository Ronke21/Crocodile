<text>La Toya Yvonne Jackson (born May 29, 1956) is an American singer and television personality. The fifth child and middle daughter of the Jackson family, Jackson first gained recognition on the family&#x27;s variety television series, &quot;The Jacksons&quot;, on CBS between 1976 and 1977. Thereafter, she saw success as a solo recording artist under multiple record labels in the 1980s and 1990s, including Polydor, Sony Music and RCA, where she released nine studio albums over the course of 15 years. Her most successful releases in the United States were her self-titled debut album (1980) and the 1984 single &quot;Heart Don&#x27;t Lie&quot;. Jackson&#x27;s other songs include &quot;If You Feel the Funk&quot;, &quot;Bet&#x27;cha Gonna Need My Lovin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Hot Potato&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Get Rocked!&quot;, and &quot;Sexbox&quot;. Another one of Jackson&#x27;s songs, &quot;Just Say No&quot; from her fifth album was composed for US first lady Nancy Reagan and Reagan administration&#x27;s anti-drug campaign.

She is a two time New York Times best-selling author. Jackson posed for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine in 1989 and again in 1991 to promote her book &quot;La Toya: Growing Up in the Jackson Family&quot;. In 1992, Jackson signed a contract with the Moulin Rouge to star in the successful Paris revue, Formidable. 
Despite subsequent musical success, Jackson&#x27;s recording career began its decline in the 1990s as a result of her controversial marriage to entertainment manager Jack Gordon, whom she divorced in 1997. After a period of public seclusion, she returned to the music industry in 2004 with the singles &quot;Just Wanna Dance&quot;, &quot;Home&quot;, and &quot;Free the World&quot;, which saw success on the Hot Dance Club Play chart in the United States. In 2011, she was a contestant on the fourth installment of &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot; and released an extended play, &quot;Starting Over&quot;, which is her most recent release to date and was released alongside her best-selling autobiography.

From 2013 to 2014, Jackson appeared in her own reality television series on the Oprah Winfrey Network, &quot;Life with La Toya&quot;, which aired for two seasons.

==Life and career==
===1956–1979: Early life and &quot;The Jacksons&quot;===

Born on her sister Rebbie&#x27;s 6th birthday on May 29, 1956, at St Mary&#x27;s Mercy Hospital in Gary, Indiana, La Toya Jackson is the fifth of ten children born to Joe and Katherine Jackson and the middle female child between Rebbie and Janet. Growing up, La Toya tended to be shy. After her mother became a member of the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in 1966, La Toya, along with the rest of her siblings followed. She would spend some of her time alongside her mother preaching door-to-door. &quot;Every morning, Michael and I witnessed, knocking on doors around Los Angeles, spreading the word of Jehovah.&quot; By 1974, at seventeen, La Toya joined her brothers in the spotlight with a tap dancing routine when her father arranged for them to perform shows in Las Vegas, among other cities. La Toya attended the California Prep school in Encino, Los Angeles, California, and aspired to be an attorney specializing in business law. She attended college for a short time before her father insisted that she pursue a career in show business like the rest of the family.

In 1976 and 1977, La Toya and her sisters Rebbie and Janet appeared in all twelve episodes of &quot;The Jacksons&quot;—a CBS-TV variety program, with their brothers Jackie, Tito, Marlon, Michael, and Randy. Along with their brothers (sans Jermaine, who stayed at Motown and left the family group when his brothers moved to Epic Records), La Toya and her sisters sang, danced, and performed skits. In 1977, during the filming of &quot;The Wiz&quot;, La Toya traveled with her brother Michael (who was cast as the Scarecrow), to New York. Sharing an apartment, it was the first time either of them had lived elsewhere as adults. Close siblings, Michael and La Toya, would not move out of the family&#x27;s Encino home until they were 29 and 31 respectively. Her dates during this period included Diana Ross&#x27; brother Chico and a young David Gest. Jackson also dated Bobby DeBarge and was the inspiration for Switch&#x27;s 1979 hit &quot;I Call Your Name&quot;.

Under Joe Jackson&#x27;s tutelage, Rebbie, La Toya and Janet formed a short-lived musical group. However, they never performed live and soon separated because of creative differences about the act&#x27;s future direction. Consequently, no related material was ever released by the trio. The next year, La Toya began work on her first solo album.

===1980–1987: Solo debut and follow-up albums===
In 1980, Jackson released her self-titled debut album. In order to distinguish herself from her famous brothers, The Jacksons, La Toya only wanted her first name on the album. &quot;I begged just to have it &#x27;La Toya&#x27;. But my father said, &#x27;It&#x27;s your last name. You got to use it.&#x27; But I wanted to see what I could do as an individual.&quot; The first single &quot;If You Feel the Funk&quot;, became a modest hit, climbing into the Top 40 of the US R&amp;B chart. Her second single, &quot;Night Time Lover&quot;, was produced by younger brother Michael, who provided backing vocals and co-wrote the song with La Toya. In turn, she provided the opening scream on her brothers&#x27;, The Jacksons, 1980 hit, &quot;This Place Hotel&quot; as well as backing vocals on brother Michael&#x27;s 1983 solo hit &quot;P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)&quot;. The &quot;La Toya Jackson&quot; album peaked at #116 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, #26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B album chart, and #178 on the UK Top 200, making it her highest placing album.

In 1981, Jackson released a follow-up album, &quot;My Special Love&quot;, which generated two singles, &quot;Stay the Night&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want You to Go&quot;.

1984 saw the release of Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Heart Don&#x27;t Lie.&quot; Jackson scored her biggest &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hit with the title track, which peaked at number 56. Other singles from this album were &quot;Bet&#x27;cha Gonna Need My Lovin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Hot Potato&quot;, and a cover of Prince&#x27;s &quot;Private Joy.&quot; Jackson and Amir Bayyan co-wrote &quot;Reggae Night&quot; for &quot;Heart Don&#x27;t Lie&quot; but the track did not make the cut. Jimmy Cliff&#x27;s recording of the song was a hit and was nominated for a Grammy. Cliff commissioned Jackson to write two more songs: &quot;Brown Eyes&quot; and &quot;American Sweet.&quot;

In 1984, Jackson licensed her name to a fashion line; &quot;David Laurenz for La Toya.&quot; Apparel in the collection included Jackson&#x27;s signature leather headbands. Jackson starred in television and print advertisements for Nikon cameras and the following year she became the spokesmodel for cosmetics firm Mahogany Image and launched her own eponymous fragrance, &quot;La Toya&quot;.

In 1985, Jackson participated on the single &quot;We Are the World&quot;, an appeal for famine relief in Ethiopia. That same year Jackson featured in anti-drug music video &quot;Stop the Madness&quot;. Her 1985 single &quot;Baby Sister&quot; received one of five Outstanding Song Awards at the sixteenth annual World Popular Song Festival in Japan. &quot;Baby Sister&quot; was included on the 1986 album &quot;Imagination&quot;, released just before Jackson&#x27;s record label, Private-I, went bankrupt resulting in poor promotion. Jackson went on to record two duets; &quot;Oops, Oh No!&quot; with Cerrone, and &quot;Yes, I&#x27;m Ready&quot; with artist Jed. In 1987 Jackson was featured as a special guest at Minako Honda&#x27;s &quot;DISPA (Disco Party)&quot; concert, joining in for the song, &quot;Funkytown&quot;.

=== 1988–1991: Public notoriety, abuse and exile from the Jackson family ===
In 1987, Jack Gordon was hired to co-manage La Toya by her father, Joseph. He later took over her management completely. Under Gordon&#x27;s management, Jackson&#x27;s public image became increasingly sexualized. Katherine Jackson recalled her shock seeing La Toya dance in a suggestive manner in 1988 for the first time in her autobiography &quot;My Family, The Jacksons&quot;: &quot;she&#x27;d been so conservative that she&#x27;d once dropped a friend who had begun wearing low-cut tops and skirts with slits in them.&quot; Katherine believed that Gordon was distancing La Toya from her family so he could &quot;become the dominating influence in her life.&quot; Around this time Jackson was disfellowshipped by the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. Defying her father, Jackson made a stormy exit from the family&#x27;s Encino compound to take up residence in New York City. In late 1988, Jackson released the album &quot;La Toya&quot;, which featured the singles &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Get Rocked!&quot; and &quot;(Ain&#x27;t Nobody Loves You) Like I Do&quot;. The album also included a track titled &quot;Just Say No&quot;, which was written for the Reagan administration&#x27;s anti-drug campaign. The album included four tracks produced by Full Force, and three by Stock Aitken Waterman. 

In March 1989, Jackson posed topless for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. Jackson saw the pictorial as a declaration of independence from her conservative upbringing and &quot;to show my parents they couldn&#x27;t dictate to me any more—that I control my life.&quot; In 1989, Jackson began recording her sixth album &quot;Bad Girl&quot;. That year Jackson staged a live pay-per-view concert, &quot;A Sizzling Spectacular!&quot;, from Bally&#x27;s theatre in Reno. The show featured special guest star Edgar Winter. 

On September 5, 1989, after her &quot;Sizzling Spectacular&quot; concert in Nevada, Gordon and Jackson were married. Jackson later claimed she had been forcibly married, with Gordon claiming it was for her own protection against kidnapping by her family. La Toya Jackson states that this was both unplanned and against her wishes. According to Jackson, &quot;I told him, &#x27;No way, Jack! I can&#x27;t marry you. You know what marriage means to me. I&#x27;ve never been in love; I don&#x27;t even date... It&#x27;s not right. I don&#x27;t love you. I don&#x27;t have feelings for you.&#x27;&quot; Jackson told &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine the marriage was &quot;strictly in name only. It has never been consummated.&quot; Six months into the marriage, Jackson asked Gordon for an annulment when in Rome, Italy. In response, Gordon repeatedly bashed her head against the corner of the hotel room table saying that he would never let her go. Paparazzi subsequently photographed Jackson with black eyes, which Gordon claimed were caused by an intruder. From this point forward, Jackson lost all contact with her family and wrote an autobiography, &quot;La Toya: Growing Up in the Jackson Family&quot;, which accused her father of physical abuse. She posed again in &quot;Playboy&quot; in November 1991 to promote the autobiography. She later said that she initially refused to pose for the second spread, however, Gordon beat her into submission.

For roughly the next decade Gordon controlled Jackson with threats, lies, and routine domestic violence. According to Jackson, &quot;When he hit me, the first time I was in shock, I just recalled my ear ringing, just ringing so hard.&quot; Gordon confiscated Jackson&#x27;s passport, transferred her bank accounts into his name, hired bodyguards to watch La Toya constantly and banned her from speaking to or seeing her family, monitoring her every phone call. La Toya&#x27;s father Joseph stated in his book &quot;The Jacksons&quot; that he believed Gordon brainwashed La Toya and made her fearful of her own family. Katherine also believed that La Toya had been brainwashed while Gordon claimed that Katherine had tried to kill her daughter. Sister Janet concurred with her parents saying at the time, &quot;I think this guy who is with her has brainwashed her and made her like this... He keeps her away from the family, and now he&#x27;s brainwashed her so much she keeps herself away from us.&quot;

In 1990, Jackson participated in the Sanremo Music Festival, entering &quot;You and Me&quot; an English-language version of &quot;Verso l&#x27;ignoto&quot; by siblings Marcella and Gianni Bella. While &quot;You and Me&quot; did not win Best Song, it entered Italy&#x27;s hit parade, peaking at number twenty-eight. That year Jackson signed on with German-based BCM Records and released the single &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Want My Love?&quot; Jackson recorded other material with BCM, but the label went bankrupt and album plans were scrapped. Jackson signed with Dino Records quickly thereafter. 1991 saw the release of &quot;No Relations&quot;, an album with strong house and funk influences. This album featured Jackson&#x27;s top twenty-five Netherlands hit &quot;Sexbox&quot;.

=== 1992–2002: Further noriety, financial difficulties, and escape ===
In 1992, Jackson signed a contract with the Moulin Rouge in Paris to star in her own revue, &quot;Formidable&quot;. Jackson was to perform two shows a night, six nights a week. Jackson was the highest-paid performer in the cabaret&#x27;s history, earning a reported $5 million. Though &quot;Formidable&quot; was successful, selling out on most nights, Jackson departed half-way into her year-long contract owing the nightclub $550,000 in damages. In October 1992, while taping an &quot;Exotic Club Tour&quot; in Minneapolis Jackson approached sister Janet Jackson, also in town recording her fifth studio album with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, to ask for help in escaping Gordon. Janet struck La Toya, accusing her elder sister of recording their conversation.

In 1993 in their New York home, Gordon beat Jackson repeatedly with a heavy brass dining room chair, leaving Jackson with black eyes, swollen lip and chin &quot;the size of a clenched fist&quot;, cuts requiring 12 mouth stitches and contusions on her face, arms, legs and back. Jackson lost consciousness during the beating, leading Gordon to believe she was dead. She recalled, &quot;He called his friends and said, &#x27;She&#x27;s dead. I killed her,&#x27; because I was lying in a puddle of blood and I was out.&quot; Gordon was arrested but then released, claiming he beat Jackson in self-defense.
In December 1993, Gordon hastily arranged a press conference in Tel Aviv, where he had Jackson read a statement claiming to believe the sex abuse allegation against her younger brother Michael might be true. This was an abrupt reversal of her previous defense of Michael against the charges. Gordon claimed La Toya had proof which she was prepared to disclose for a fee of $500,000. A bidding war between US and UK tabloids began, but fell through when they realized that her revelations were not what she had claimed them to be. According to La Toya, Gordon threatened to have siblings Michael and Janet killed if she didn&#x27;t follow his orders. In 1993, Jackson claims her father sexually abused her and her sister as a child while the mother enabled it. Rebbie called the police on her father over the sexual abuse, and the mother told the police nothing happened.

Under Gordon&#x27;s management, Jackson&#x27;s career declined with his booking of disreputable jobs such as spokesperson for the Psychic Friends Network. By the mid-1990s, Jackson&#x27;s finances were in disarray and she was forced to file for bankruptcy in order to stave off claims of $550,000 in damages to the Moulin Rouge for ending her contract early. In 1993 Jackson held a concert at Poland&#x27;s Sopot International Song Festival and released a step aerobics exercise video, &quot;Step-Up Workout&quot;. In 1994, Jackson again worked for Playboy Entertainment, becoming one of the first celebrities to have a Celebrity Centerfold video. &quot;Playboy Celebrity Centerfold: La Toya Jackson&quot; was released in the first quarter of 1994 and sold roughly 50,000 copies. She later said that the video was filmed under duress by Gordon. Jackson later released two albums, one of country music, &quot;From Nashville to You&quot;, and another of Motown hits, &quot;Stop in the Name of Love&quot;, in the mid-1990s.

When Jackson became aware that Gordon was planning to feature her in a pornographic film, Jackson phoned brother Randy who flew to New York to help her escape while Gordon was out. Days later, La Toya filed for divorce in Las Vegas and sued Gordon in civil court for years of abuse under the Violence Against Women Act. She changed her name from La Toya Jackson-Gordon to La Toya Jackson, thus dropping use of her former middle name Yvonne. La Toya Jackson ended her estrangement with the entire Jackson family and returned home to Hayvenhurst. Jackson forgave her parents for her stifled upbringing reasoning, &quot;I&#x27;ve come to realize that as we get older, we grow and learn a lot more. And I think that my father and my mother, they raised children the best way they know how.&quot; According to La Toya, Michael knew that she was forced to attack him in the press against her will and he did not blame her. Jackson&#x27;s last single of the 1990s was &quot;Don&#x27;t Break My Heart&quot;.

After separating from Gordon, Jackson cloistered herself in her home and lived alone for the first time. Weary after her years of public scorn, she was afraid to perform again and struggled to rebuild her confidence. After this time she started to perform in Europe and South America occasionally to start making money to pay off the huge debts which Gordon had accumulated in her name while they were married. In the wake of the September 11 attacks Jackson was moved to compose &quot;Free the World&quot;. She performed the song for friends to a positive reception and began working on further material.

=== 2003–2011: Return to music and &quot;Starting Over&quot; ===
Jackson publicly re-emerged on Larry King Live on March 9, 2003. Her appearance caused CNN&#x27;s phone lines to stay busy for hours and was King&#x27;s highest-rated show in three years. Jackson announced her first musical project in six years, &quot;Startin&#x27; Over&quot;. &quot;Startin&#x27; Over&quot;&#x27;s lead single was 2004&#x27;s &quot;Just Wanna Dance&quot;, released independently through Ja-Tail Records. The song was released under her pseudonymous nickname &quot;Toy&quot; in order to avoid any prejudices DJs might hold against La Toya Jackson&#x27;s name. &quot;Just Wanna Dance&quot; reached #13 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance chart. &quot;Free the World&quot; was released the following year. In February 2005, Ja-Tail Records secured a deal with Bungalo Records to distribute the project, but it was delayed for several years.

After Jack Gordon&#x27;s death in 2005, Jackson was free to speak more openly about the control he had exerted over her life. She sent a security expert to eyewitness that Gordon had not faked his death a second time. In 2005 she appeared on ABC News to recant her previous allegations and defend brother Michael against new charges of child abuse.
On January 10, 2007, the reality TV show &quot;Armed &amp; Famous&quot; premiered on CBS starring Jackson and other celebrities. The program documented Jackson&#x27;s basic training and service as a reserve police officer with the Muncie Police Department. The show was eventually removed from the CBS lineup, due to its inability to compete with &quot;American Idol&quot;. VH1 subsequently aired the remaining episodes. She released the promotional single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Play That&quot; on January 29, 2007. 

In January 2009, Jackson was paid £103,000 to appear as a contestant on the British television program &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 6&quot;, which she placed 7th. Jackson released &quot;Home&quot; on July 28, 2009, with all proceeds going to AIDS Project Los Angeles. In 2010, Jackson launched the hand cream &quot;Dream Cream&quot; with German cosmetics firm Alessandro International. 

Jackson&#x27;s second memoir, &quot;Starting Over&quot;, was released in the United States on June 21, 2011, through Gallery Books, an imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster. Following numerous delays, Jackson&#x27;s intended eleventh studio album was instead released as an EP, also called &quot;Starting Over&quot;, on the same day. In 2011, Jackson appeared in NBC&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Apprentice.&quot; Jackson also served as a guest judge on &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; and on the 17th season of &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;.

=== 2012–present: Reality television ===
In 2013, Jackson started her own reality series called &quot;Life With La Toya&quot; on the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN). Also in 2013, Jackson rejoined the newest cast for &quot;The All-Star Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, lasting until the 3rd episode of the season. During the series, Jackson accused fellow contestant Omarosa Manigault of causing the death of her fiancé Michael Clarke Duncan. Manigault threatened a lawsuit in response.

In September 2013, Jackson made her stage debut in a week-long engagement in the off-Broadway musical &quot;Newsical&quot;.
In 2013, she and business partner Jeffre Phillips were executive producers of the documentary &quot;Dancing in Jaffa&quot;, which followed 150 young Jewish and Palestinian Israelis as they dance together in unity by putting their cultural differences aside.

In 2016, she collaborated with Iranian-Armenian pop star Andy on the single &quot;Tehran&quot;, sung in Farsi.

In 2018, Jackson participated in a celebrity edition of Food Network&#x27;s &quot;Worst Cooks in America&quot;. Coached by celebrity chef Tyler Florence, she advanced to the final and beat out Ian Ziering to win the season; $25,000 was awarded to the charity Race to Erase MS in Jackson&#x27;s name.

In 2019, Jackson was revealed to be &quot;Alien&quot; on the FOX reality series &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; during its first season. In 2021, Jackson competed as the Menina (Girl) in the Spanish edition &quot;Mask Singer: Adivina Quién Canta&quot;. In 2023, she appeared for a third time in the franchise, as Burger Gal in the 5th season of the Australian edition of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;.

== Vocal style and influences ==
La Toya Jackson has a three-octave vocal range reaching up to E6 in her single, &quot;Bet&#x27;cha Gonna Need My Lovin&#x27;.&quot; &quot;The Evening Independent&quot; says that she has an &quot;attractive, pleasant voice that is matured and controlled.&quot; Andrew Hamilton of &quot;AllMusic&quot; describes her voice as a light, wispy &quot;sexy whisper&quot;. Like her siblings, Michael and Janet, she is mainly a pop, R&amp;B, and dance music performer but she has also dabbled in rock as heard in her song, &quot;No More Drama&quot; and reggae in her signature song &quot;Heart Don&#x27;t Lie&quot;, as well as country music.

Like many other Jacksons, most notably Michael, she cites James Brown as a &quot;major influence&quot;. When Jackson headlined the Moulin Rouge she paid homage to La Goulue and cited Josephine Baker as an influence. &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot; hailed Jackson as &quot;the new Josephine Baker.&quot; According to academic Bennetta Jules-Rosette, &quot;Through careful planning, she was able to model a successful part of her career abroad on the master tropes of a Baker-like image. Jackson exemplifies Baudrillard&#x27;s notion that neither the message nor the content count as much as the referentiality of the signifier in postmodern performative discourse.&quot;

==Personal life==
Jackson is reportedly vegetarian as of October 2023.
In early December 2013, USWeekly and others reported that Jackson had married her business partner Jeffré Phillips in Los Angeles on December 6, 2013. Entertainment media outlet TMZ reported that La Toya and Jeffre stated that they have not married, which they reaffirmed in an appearance on &quot;&quot;. The confusion appeared to result from Phillips proposing to Jackson publicly in a recently aired episode of Jackson&#x27;s reality series &quot;Life with La Toya&quot;. Phillips&#x27; decision to propose to La Toya purportedly was prompted by their friend Brenda Harvey Richie, who had noted that they had been best friends for 15 years, after Phillips became La Toya&#x27;s business partner; per Jackson, Phillips&#x27; proposal was made with the blessing of La Toya&#x27;s father. As of February 2015, Jackson and Phillips have annulled their engagement.

<text>Virginia Dare (born August 18, 1587; date of death unknown) was the first English child born in an American English colony.

What became of Virginia and the other colonists remains a mystery. The fact of her birth is known because John White, Virginia&#x27;s grandfather and the governor of the colony, returned to England in 1587 to seek fresh supplies. When White eventually returned three years later, the colonists were gone.

During the past four hundred years, Virginia Dare has become a prominent figure in American myth and folklore, symbolizing different things to different groups of people. She has been featured as a main character in books, poems, songs, comic books, television programs, and films. Her name has been used to sell different types of goods, from vanilla products to soft drinks, as well as wine and spirits. Many places in North Carolina and elsewhere in the Southern United States have been named in her honor.

==Biography==

Virginia Dare was born in the Roanoke Colony in what is now North Carolina in August 1587, the first child born in the New World to English parents. &quot;Elenora, daughter to the governor of the city and wife to Ananias Dare, one of the assistants, was delivered of a daughter in Roanoke&quot;.

Little is known of the lives of either of her parents. Her mother Eleanor was born in London around 1568 and was the daughter of John White, the governor of the ill-fated Roanoke Colony. Eleanor married Ananias Dare (born c. 1560), a London tiler and bricklayer, at St Bride&#x27;s Church on Fleet Street in the City of London. He, too, was part of the Roanoke expedition. Virginia Dare was one of two infants born to the colonists in 1587 and the only female child known to have been born to the settlers.

Nothing else is known of Virginia Dare&#x27;s life, as the Roanoke Colony did not endure. Virginia&#x27;s grandfather John White sailed for England for fresh supplies at the end of 1587, having established his colony. Because England&#x27;s war with Spain brought about a pressing need for ships to defend against the Spanish Armada, he was unable to return to Roanoke until August 18, 1590, by which time he found that the settlement had been long deserted. The buildings had collapsed and &quot;the houses [were] taken down&quot;. Worse, White was unable to find any trace of his daughter or granddaughter, or indeed any of the 80 men, 17 women, and 11 children who made up the &quot;Lost Colony&quot;.

==Mystery of the &quot;Lost Colony&quot; (Roanoke)==
Nothing is known for certain of the fate of Virginia Dare or her fellow colonists. Governor White found no sign of a struggle or battle. The only clue to the colonists&#x27; fate was the word &quot;Croatoan&quot; carved into a post of the fort, and the letters &quot;Cro&quot; carved into a nearby tree. All the houses and fortifications had been dismantled, suggesting that their departure had not been hurried. Before he had left the colony, White had instructed them that, if anything happened to them, they should carve a Maltese cross on a tree nearby, indicating that their disappearance had been forced. There was no cross, and White took this to mean that they had moved to Croatoan Island (now known as Hatteras Island), but he was unable to conduct a search.

There are a number of theories regarding the fate of the colonists, the most widely accepted one being that they sought shelter with local Indian tribes, and either intermarried with the natives or were killed. In 1607, John Smith and other members of the successful Jamestown Colony sought information about the fate of the Roanoke colonists. One report indicated that the survivors had taken refuge with friendly Chesapeake Indians, but Chief Powhatan claimed that his tribe had attacked the group and killed most of the colonists. Powhatan showed Smith certain artifacts that he said had belonged to the colonists, including a musket barrel and a brass mortar and pestle. However, no archaeological evidence exists to support this claim. The Jamestown Colony received reports of some survivors of the Lost Colony and sent out search parties, but none were successful. Eventually they determined that all survivors had died.

William Strachey, a secretary of the Jamestown Colony, wrote in &quot;The Historie of Travaile Into Virginia Britannia&quot; in 1612 that there were reportedly two-story houses with stone walls at the Indian settlements of Peccarecanick and Ochanahoen. The Indians supposedly learned how to build them from the Roanoke settlers. There were also reported sightings of European captives at various Indian settlements during the same time period. Strachey also wrote that four English men, two boys, and one maid had been sighted at the Eno settlement of Ritanoc, under the protection of a chief called Eyanoco. The captives were forced to beat copper. The captives, he reported, had escaped the attack on the other colonists and fled up the Chaonoke river, the present-day Chowan River in Bertie County, North Carolina.

==Modern legacy==

Virginia Dare has become a prominent figure in American myth and folklore in the more than four hundred years since her birth, representing different things to different people. A 2000 article in the Piedmont (North Carolina) Triad &quot;News and Record&quot; noted that she symbolizes innocence and purity for many Americans (particularly Southerners), &quot;new beginnings, promise, and hope&quot; as well as &quot;adventure and bravery&quot; in a new land. She also symbolizes mystery because of her mysterious fate.

Virginia Dare has been adopted as an icon by white supremacists since at least the 19th century. For some white residents of North Carolina, she has been a symbol of the state itself, and symbolizes a desire to keep it predominantly of European descent. In the 1920s, a group in Raleigh that opposed suffrage for women feared that black women would get the vote, urging &quot;that North Carolina remain white ... in the name of Virginia Dare&quot;. Today, Virginia Dare&#x27;s name serves as the inspiration for the VDARE website which is associated with white supremacy, white nationalism, and the alt-right.

Some see Dare as a symbol of women&#x27;s rights. In the 1980s, feminists in North Carolina called for state residents to approve the Equal Rights Amendment and &quot;Honor Virginia Dare.&quot;

There is a memorial to Virginia Dare in St Bride&#x27;s Church, Fleet Street in the City of London, where her parents were married prior to their journey to Roanoke. The bronze sculpture was created by Clare Waterhouse in 1999. It replaced a marble sculpture of Dare carved by Marjorie Meggit in 1957, which was stolen in 1999 and never recovered.

===Eleanor Dare stones===

Virginia&#x27;s death and the fate of the other colonists were purportedly described in a series of inscribed stones written by Eleanor Dare and others. Most of these were later revealed to be forgeries, with the authenticity of one remaining in dispute.

===1937 Roanoke commemorative coin===

In 1937, the United States Mint issued a half-dollar commemorative coin that depicted Virginia Dare as the first English child born in the New World. This was also the first time that a child was depicted on United States currency.

===Literary and cultural references===

Virginia Dare quickly entered into folklore as the first white child born in British America. The fate of Virginia Dare and the Lost Colony has been the subject of many literary, film, and television adaptations, all of which have added to her myth:
* One of the first was Cornelia Tuthill&#x27;s 1840 novel &quot;Virginia Dare, or the Colony of Roanoke&quot;, in which Virginia marries a Jamestown settler. Virginia Dare met the Indian princess Pocahontas in E.A.B. Shackleford&#x27;s 1892 novel &quot;Virginia Dare: A Romance of the Sixteenth Century&quot;. Virginia Dare was the main character in Sallie Southall Cotten&#x27;s 1901 book in verse &quot;The White Doe: The Fate of Virginia Dare&quot;. In the book, she is turned into a white doe by an Indian witch doctor after she rejects his advances. When her true love, an Indian warrior, shoots her with a silver arrow, she turns back into a woman just before she dies in his arms. Cotten has asserted, however, that the tale of Dare as the White Doe had survived for some three centuries as part of colonial folklore. In the 1908 novel &quot;The Daughter of Virginia Dare&quot;, author Mary Virginia Wall made Pocahontas the daughter of Virginia Dare. In Herbert Bouldin Hawes&#x27; 1930 novel &quot;The Daughter of the Blood&quot;, Virginia Dare is involved in a romantic triangle with John Smith and Pocahontas.
* Neil Gaiman has extended this story in his comic book series &quot;1602&quot;, where a Native American named Rojhaz meets Virginia Dare when she is about twelve, and an artifact of his travels causes her to transform into a series of white creatures whenever she is in danger. The storyline ends when Peter Parquagh and Virginia Dare head home to her father to plot the rescue of those left in England. In later stories in the &quot;1602&quot; universe (much like the figure of legend), when attempting to flee in the form of a white doe, she is shot by Master Norman Osborne and reverts to human form in front of Peter before dying.
* In Margaret Peterson Haddix&#x27;s novel &quot;Sabotaged&quot;, a girl finds out that she herself is actually Virginia Dare. In Philip José Farmer&#x27;s 1965 novel &quot;Dare&quot;, Virginia and the other Lost Colonists are abducted by aliens and settled on a planet called Dare.
* In 1969, Steve Cannon wrote &quot;Groove, Bang and Jive Around&quot;, in which Virginia Dare is one of two stewardesses aboard the Statecraft One who engages in a wild orgy with Annette, the foxy adolescent girl from New Orleans, and Estavanico, &quot;Little Stevie&quot; to some, the flight engineer. Near the end, in the land of Oobladee, she is eventually magically transformed into a frail, old woman with a cane, who explains the reasons for which she was left to explore much darker horizons, sexually. Ultimately, she falls to the floor as a pile of ashes.
* Virginia Dare appears in Mark Chadbourn&#x27;s fantasy trilogy Kingdom of the Serpent, encompassing the novels &quot;Jack of Ravens&quot;, &quot;The Burning Man&quot;, and &quot;Destroyer of Worlds&quot;. She is kidnapped along with the other Roanoke colonists and taken to the Celtic Otherworld, the home of all myth and legend. She plays a key role in the final volume of the trilogy.
* A woman named Virginia Dare appears in Gregory Keyes&#x27; fantasy novel &quot;The Briar King&quot;. Keyes uses several hints and word clues to indicate this character is meant to be the historical figure.
* In Volume I of &quot;Tales of the Slayer&quot;, a horror story collection set in the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; universe, Virginia Dare appears as the vampire slayer &quot;White Doe&quot;, an English girl adopted by the Croatoan Indians. She is turned into a white doe by a wizard of the tribe when she rejects his advances. Her true love, Seal of the Ocean, finds her but later kills her because he does not recognize her as a deer.
* Dare is the main villain in the short-lived television show &quot;FreakyLinks&quot;. Inspired by &quot;The X-Files&quot; and &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;, it follows a young man who takes over his twin brother&#x27;s paranormal website, &quot;Freakylinks&quot;, after his death. It is later found that his brother&#x27;s death was related to his investigations into the lost colony of Roanoke. It is implied that Virginia Dare was a demon who destroyed the colonists, either directly or indirectly. However, the show was canceled before the end of the first season, and the mystery was never resolved.
* In the 2007 made-for-TV movie on the SciFi Channel, &quot;Wraiths of Roanoke&quot;, Virginia Dare is the sole survivor after the colony is wiped out by Old Norse ghosts, or wraiths, who had died on the island centuries earlier but failed to achieve transit to Valhalla. In the movie the infant Virginia, whose innocence is needed by the wraiths, is used by her father to lure the wraiths onto a flaming raft set adrift for a Viking funeral. The last act of Ananias is to cast Virginia away from the raft in a wicker basket. She is found and adopted by the mainland Indians the next day.
* In &quot;The Necromancer&quot;, the fourth book in Michael Scott&#x27;s &quot;Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel&quot; series, Virginia Dare was introduced as an immortal who disables her enemies with charms from a magic flute. It is later revealed in the story that her father is the one who carved the word &quot;Croatoan&quot; onto the fence post and part of the tree.
* In &quot;Sabotaged&quot;, the third book of the &quot;Missing Series&quot; by Margaret Peterson Haddix, Virginia Dare is a missing child from history who had been kidnapped by one of the evil villains when she was a child, but then accidentally landed in the twenty-first century. The main characters, Jonah and Katherine, are sent back into time, again, to return her to the colony. However, Andrea (also called Virginia) is tricked by a mysterious character named Second to sabotage the mission. The book takes place in Roanoke Island and they eventually travel to Croatoan Island.
* In the 2011 faux-Southern Gothic show &quot;The Heart, She Holler&quot; the town matriarch, commonly referred to as &quot;Meemaw&quot;, is named Virginia Dare. In Season 3 it is confirmed that she is the actual Virginia Dare, &quot;the first white person born on this continent&quot;. Her birth so offended the gods of the indigenous peoples that she was &quot;cursed&quot; with immortality and various psychic powers including but not limited to telekinesis, extrasensory perception, and unexplained reality bending powers.
* She is a character in the novel &quot;The Last American Vampire&quot; written by Seth Grahame-Smith.
* She is mentioned in the &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; season 1 episode &quot;John Doe&quot;, which features the lost Roanoke colony.

===Tourism and advertising===

Virginia Dare&#x27;s name has become a tourist attraction for North Carolina. Many locations are named after her, including Dare County, North Carolina; the Virginia Dare Trail, a section of NC 12; Virginia Dare Memorial Bridge, the second, newest, and widest bridge spanning the Croatan Sound connecting Roanoke Island to Manns Harbor, carrying US 64. Residents of Roanoke Island celebrate Virginia Dare&#x27;s birthday each year with an Elizabethan Renaissance fair. A statue of Virginia as a grown woman, nude and wrapped in a fishnet, is on display in the Elizabethan Gardens on the island. At Smith Mountain Lake, a reservoir in Virginia created by damming the Roanoke River, there is an active tour boat named Virginia Dare.

Virginia Dare&#x27;s name has also been used to sell a number of products. Virginia Dare was the name of the first commercial wine to sell after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933. The Virginia Dare Extract Company, a maker of vanilla products, sells its products with a symbol of Virginia as a fresh-faced, blonde girl wearing a white ruffled mob cap. The company&#x27;s website notes that Virginia Dare symbolizes &quot;wholesomeness and purity&quot;. In Rancho Cucamonga, California, a now-defunct winery called Virginia Dare is on the corner of Haven Avenue and Foothill Boulevard (U.S. Route 66).

== Ships named after her ==
*SS &quot;Virginia Dare&quot; was a Liberty ship built in the United States during World War II.
*Schooner &quot;Virginia Dare&quot;, 89.41 tons, built in 1883 in Essex and owned by &quot;Pool, Gardner &amp; Co.&quot; of Gloucester.

<text>The Avon River is a river in Perth County, Ontario, Canada. The river was named after the River Avon in England when the town of Stratford was founded on its banks in 1832. The Avon River rises northeast of Stratford and flows southwest, flowing into the North Thames River near St. Marys. It was originally known as the Little Thames River.

==Course==

The river begins in a field northeast of the community of Shakespeare in Perth East. It flows west to the north of the community, south of Brocksden, and into Lake Victoria, a seasonal reservoir created by the Thomas Orr Dam, in Stratford. The Avon River continues west through the community of Avonton in Perth South, and heads south through the community of Avonbank. It then empties into the North Thames River, as a left tributary, between the community of Motherwell to the north and the town of St. Marys to the south.

<text>The Avon River is a small river in central Nova Scotia, Canada.

A northerly flowing river, the Avon River&#x27;s flow rises at an elevation of 145 metres (475 ft.) at Card and Bag Lakes on the South Mountain, a distance of approximately 29 kilometres (18 miles) southwest of the town of Windsor. Its meander length is . At Windsor Forks, the West Branch Avon River (the main tributary) and the Southwest Branch Avon add their flow to the Avon. The West Branch Avon River rises at an elevation of 175 metres (574 ft.) at Black River Lake. Both the flows of the Avon and the West Branch have been impeded by hydropower developments in the early twentieth century. Near the rural community of Martock, the river enters a broad glacial river valley forming a ria where it becomes tidal, creating an estuary for its remaining route to the Minas Basin at Kempt Shore, several kilometres downriver from the town of Hantsport. Another tributary, the St. Croix River joins just below Windsor creating a total watershed of 1,306 square kilometres.

Rivers flowing into the Avon include the Halfway, Herbert, Cogmagun, Kennetcook and St. Croix.

The Avon River is evident on many very early maps of the region and by 1686 is shown, along with its drainage basin, on Jean-Baptiste-Louis Franquelin&#x27;s map in great detail.

==Causeway and controversy==

In 1970 the Avon River was completely obstructed by a rock and earth fill causeway immediately downstream from Windsor at its junction with the St. Croix River as part of the development of a controlled access expressway called Highway 101.

The Avon River Causeway replaced an existing road bridge upriver from town and also resulted in the rerouting of the Dominion Atlantic Railway&#x27;s Halifax-Yarmouth main line which used to run through Windsor&#x27;s downtown, crossing the river on a bridge parallel to the road bridge immediately upriver from the town.

The causeway controls the Avon River&#x27;s discharge and the incoming tidal waters of the Minas Basin through a series of flood control gates which are intended to regulate the river&#x27;s flowage to prevent flooding of agricultural lands upriver near Martock. The section of the Avon River upriver of the causeway along the Windsor waterfront is now a &#x27;man-made&#x27; freshwater, Lake Pesaquid.

The construction of the causeway has dramatically affected the Avon River downstream from Windsor, with large parts of the once-navigable river now being obstructed by large mud flats and vegetation, owing to the lack of tidal exchange and freshwater discharge. The nature writer Harry Thurston has noted, &quot;Almost before the last stone was put in place, sediment began to accumulate to an alarming rate - 5 to 14 centimetres per month. Within seven years, a four metre high island of silt formed on the seaward side of the causeway; and the effects were felt 20 kilometres downstream, where two metres of mud impaired navigation at Hantsport.&quot;

Dr. Michael Risk of the University of Guelph, researching the build-up of a new mud flat on the seaward side of the causeway, &quot;estimated that the bottom-dwelling creatures at Windsor were experiencing a two-thirds mortality rate&quot;, which led him to state the new formation was a &quot;biological desert&quot;. The onset of the mud flat formation left the sediments in an initial state which were too soft to support organisms. The need to monitor and assess the impacts of such changes gave impetus to a greater interest in Bay of Fundy ecosystem and the ultimate establishment of the Acadia Centre for Estuarine Research (ACER) in Wolfville. Contrasting the initial decline of bottom-dwelling creatures, Dr. Graham Daborn of ACER found that zoo-plankton &quot;are more abundant than previously thought. They appear to be able to thrive on non-living organic matter...&quot; and that this &quot;abundance of creatures at the lower end of the food chain suggests a considerable nursery role for the inner Bay.&quot; This notion is supported by research work completed by Dr. Sherman Bleakney of Acadia University.

Recently announced plans for the expansion of Highway 101 between the Halifax Regional Municipality and the eastern end of the Annapolis Valley have raised concerns about maintaining the Avon River causeway. An environmental lobby group, Friends of the Avon River (FAR), has called upon the Federal Fisheries Ministers to instigate a Comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment Study (CEIA) of the complete Avon River Watershed in order to protect the Endangered Atlantic Salmon, the COSWIC listed American Eel and their &#x27;critical habitats&#x27;. The Avon River Causeway has &#x27;zero&#x27; fish passageway. Thus, impeding all fish species needing to migrate to their freshwater habitats, in order to complete their lifecycles. FAR reviewed and supported a report to have a more indepth study regarding the protection of fish species before the expansion of gypsum quarries within the river&#x27;s watershed because of threats to river life, citing the use de-watering runoff from the quarries.

A decision in August 2007 by the New Brunswick government to remove a similar causeway (constructed in 1968) blocking the Petitcodiac River, another tributary of the Bay of Fundy, to avoid facing charges under the federal &quot;Fisheries Act&quot;, is expected to have ramifications for the Avon River causeway.

<text>The Avon River is a river in Western Australia. A tributary of the Swan River, the Avon flows from source to mouth, with a catchment area of .

==Avon catchment area==
Lake Yealering in the Shire of Wickepin is the point of origin for the upper Avon River, and the catchment size above the confluence with the Salt River at Yenyening Lakes is .

The basin covers much of the Western Australian wheatbelt and extends beyond that in some areas near almost-always-dry Lake Moore in the northeast, water is received regularly from only the extreme western edge of the basin. Indeed, until an abnormally wet year in 1963 it was not realised that the northeastern part of the basin beyond Wongan Hills ever drained water into the river. Under present climatic conditions, it is almost impossible to produce runoff from anywhere outside the extreme west of the basin because the amount of rain required to fall before runoff would begin is as high or higher than the mean annual rainfall. The river has three main sub-catchments: catchments for the Mortlock, Yilgarn, and Lockhart rivers.

The river flows past County Peak, creating a picturesque view from the top.

===Course and features===
Thirty creeks and rivers flow into the Avon; some of the larger tributaries include the Dale River, Brockman River, Mortlock River and the Mackie River. Most of these watercourses are ephemeral and only flow after rain in winter and spring.

Some permanent pools exist along the course of the river including Burlong Pool, Robins Pool, Long Pool, Cobblers Pool and Jimperding Pool.

The Avon River Valley is the third and final route for the Eastern Railway line through the Darling Scarp between Midland and Northam, having been constructed in the 1960s.

It is the site of an annual whitewater boating event, the Avon Descent.

==Soils==
Due to the extraordinary age of the soils in the basin (which is on the extremely ancient Yilgarn Craton), the rooting density of native flora is very high and its average specific discharge is probably the lowest of any basin of comparable size in the world. The extreme age of the soils also means that, at least after clearing for agriculture, almost all rivers in the basin have salinities above 0.3% (one-tenth that of the oceans and eight times that necessary to qualify as &quot;fresh&quot; water) and some much more than that.

Passing through some of the oldest settled European agricultural areas in Western Australia, the catchment area has extensive soil salinity issues, which have attracted governmental programmes to alleviate the loss of agricultural lands. Catchment groups that oversee projects in the tributary parts of the river have had considerable support and funding from commercial and non-governmental sources as well.

<doc id="152318" wikidata="Q7295300" url="?curid=152318" title="Rastrick">
<text>Rastrick is a village in the county of West Yorkshire, England, between Halifax, 5 miles (8 km) north-west and Huddersfield, 4 miles (7 km) south.

The population of the Calderdale Civil Ward at the 2011 census was 11,351. It is perhaps best known for its association, along with its neighbour Brighouse, 1 mile (2 km) north-east, with the Brighouse and Rastrick Brass Band. 
Along with Brighouse, it is part of Calderdale, but shares a Huddersfield postcode and phone number.

Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, the village is on an incline facing north-east, the Parish Church, is vertically in the middle.
The area around the Parish Church is known as &quot;Top o&#x27; t&#x27;Town&quot; and the area around the Junction public house is known as &quot;Bottom o&#x27; t&#x27;Town&quot;, this reflects the days when Rastrick had its own governance in the form of a Town Board whose Offices and lock-up were situated halfway between the two, on Ogden Lane.

Remains of a fort have been found at Castle Hill, just below Top o&#x27; Town.

==History==
The name Rastrick is thought to be Viking in origin, with the &quot;..ick&quot; formation being common to many Norwegian Viking placenames, including &quot;Jorvick&quot;, the Viking name for York.

Rastrick is well known for its pubs and the &quot;Rastrick Run&quot; is a popular pub crawl.

Rastrick, and the variation Raistrick are English surnames, originating from the area of the town.

==Governance==
Rastrick is a village and a ward of Calderdale, a metropolitan borough within the ceremonial county of West Yorkshire in England. Rastrick was recorded on 1 July 1837 as part of the Halifax Registration District. Rastrick was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Halifax, in 1866 Rastrick became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1915 the parish was abolished and merged with Brighouse. In 1911 the parish had a population of 8786. On 1 April 1938 Brighouse borough was transferred to the neighbouring registration district of &#x27;Calder&#x27; and in 1974 it was abolished as part of the creation of Calderdale. Rastrick became a ward of Calderdale, with boundaries similar to those of the original parish.

==Geography==
The ward of Rastrick is bordered to the north by the River Calder, which separates it from the ward of Brighouse. To the east and south the border with the Kirklees ward of Ashbrow roughly follows the M62 motorway. The traditional north western boundary between Elland and Rastrick was the edge of the escarpment, but the Elland Ward boundary is further east, encompassing parts of the old parish of Rastrick as far as Dewsbury Road and the crossroads with New Hey Road.
The village is neighboured by the towns of Brighouse to the north and Elland to the west. The village of Fixby is to the south east and Ainley Top is to the south west.

==Community facilities==
Rastrick has its own library which can be found on Crowtrees Lane and a doctors surgery at Rastrick Health Centre which is on Chapel Croft. A second doctors surgery is situated at the junction of Castle Avenue and Field Top Road.

==Landmarks==
The highest point in the village is Round Hill which is adjacent to the grounds of Rastrick Cricket Club. This appears to be man made but is thought to be of natural origin. The Clough House Inn, on Clough Lane, is easily seen from the nearby M62. It was originally the White Lion Inn which was built in 1824, and is named as such on the 1835 and 1850 maps.

==Transport==
The local railway station is named Brighouse but is in fact in Rastrick. An extensive bus service is provided by several operators, including First West Yorkshire, Team Pennine and South Pennine Community Transport, under the guidance of the West Yorkshire Combined Authority (brand name Metro).

==Education==
Rastrick has several primary schools, including Carr Green Junior, Infant and Nursery School, Field Lane Primary School, Longroyde Primary School, and Woodhouse Primary School. Rastrick High School is the secondary school for the area. Highbury School is a specialist school on Lower Edge Road, and The William Henry Smith School is a non-maintained residential school located on Boothroyd Lane.

Rastrick Independent School was a private school located in the village that closed in 2019.

==Religious sites==

There are two Anglican churches in the village. St Matthew&#x27;s Church, which is used jointly by the Anglicans and the Methodists and is situated on Church Street. Across the road from this Church is Rastrick Parish Centre, the church hall for St Matthew&#x27;s Church. The Church of St John the Divine is located off Gooder Lane close to Brighouse railway station and was designed by Nicholson and Corlette in 1913. Both St Matthew&#x27;s and St John&#x27;s share the same Church of England vicar.

The non-denominational New Road Family Church is located on New Hey Road and operated as a church from 1837 until 2021. It began as a Sunday school, and continued to accommodate a school until 1912. In 1872 a Band of Hope Society was formed, and operated intermittently until the 1980s. During the Second World War the church housed a British Restaurant. Declining congregations in the 21st century, saw the church close in 2021. A book entitled The History of New Road Sunday School was written in 2012 by local historian Andrew Eccles and covers the entire history from 1837-2012.

Upper Edge Baptist Church is located on Dewsbury Road. The church traces its history to &quot;Rossendale Church&quot;, which consisted of many Independent congregations located across the Rossendale Valley. Individual congregations became separate churches by about 1720. In 1837 a non-sectarian Sunday School was founded at Elland Edge, and the first school was built in 1841. The Upper Edge Church as founded on 19 October 1863.

==Sport==
The cricket club in Rastrick, Rastrick Cricket Club, is found next to Round Hill, the highest point in Rastrick. Round Hill is a popular playing area for children in the area. A second cricket club, Badger Hill Cricket Club, formerly New Road Cricket Club, played on the field off New Hey Road.

Rastrick Bowling Club is situated at the bottom of Toothill Bank which has many local bowling teams and entertainment nights, and is also a good venue for parties. Rastrick Constitutional Club (also known as Top Club) has been situated on Church Street since 1886 and is known for its snooker teams.

==Notable people==
Rastrick was the birthplace of religious writer Margaret Barber who wrote under the pseudonym Michael Fairless, and of the eccentric inventor Wilf Lunn.

<text>Riddlesden is a suburb of Keighley (historically a separate village) in the county of West Yorkshire, England and on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.

The village lies east of Keighley town centre and is on the B6265 road between Keighley and Bingley. The part of the village by the canal is at a height of above sea level.

==History==
Riddlesden is mentioned in the Domesday Book as belonging to William the Conqueror and being in the Wapentake of Skyrack. The name of the village appears throughout history as &quot;Redlesden&quot; and as &quot;Redelesden&quot; and it derives from the name of a wooded vale (or farm) of &quot;Rœd&quot; or &quot;Redwulf&quot;.

The village was historically in the parish of Bingley, but it is currently in the civil parish of Keighley. There have been proposals in 2010 and 2012 for Riddlesden to have a separate parish which includes nearby Stockbridge and Sandbeds. The ecclesiastical parish is known as Riddlesden St Mary, which is the name of the church in the village. The Diocese of Leeds estimates the ecclesiastical parish to have a population of 4,500. The village lies in the Ward of Keighley East for the purposes of census data.

In 1773, the Bingley to Skipton section of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal was opened. Riddlesden had several wharves which allowed for the exportation of coal from the nearby collieries. Coal was mined at Riddlesden between 1700 and the early 1920s.

The manor of Riddlesden, incorporating both houses (East and West Riddlesden Halls), was the breeding place of the Airedale Heifer, a legendary heavy cow similar in stature to the Craven Heifer. A pub called the &quot;Airedale Heifer&quot; is located in nearby Sandbeds, just to the east.

==Landmarks==

East Riddlesden Hall is in the care of the National Trust. It was built in 1642 by a wealthy Halifax clothier, James Murgatroyd. There is a medieval tithebarn in the grounds.

East Riddlesden Hall was featured on an episode of the paranormal themed reality television programme &quot;Most Haunted&quot;.

A lot of walkers and campers and various clubs, e.g. Scouts, are attracted to the village because of its sights, such as the peculiarly shaped cliff known as &quot;turtle rock&quot; to locals.

==Amenities==

The school for Riddlesden is St. Mary&#x27;s Church of England Primary School and Nursery. The village has a large grocery shop and two pubs. Walks in the area are centred on the towpath of the canal, which is also designated as National Cycle Route 69.

Between 1927 and 2017, Riddlesden had a golf course to the west of the village overlooking the canal. The site closed due to dwindling numbers and has been converted into a scout activity centre. Just past the former golf course is Low Wood Nature Reserve, which is run by the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust.

==Notable people==
*Denis Healey - Labour MP, later &quot;Baron Healey, of Riddlesden in the County of West Yorkshire&quot;, was brought up in the village from the age of eight.

<doc id="152323" wikidata="Q506274" url="?curid=152323" title="Babylonian cuneiform numerals">
<text>Babylonian cuneiform numerals, also used in Assyria and Chaldea, were written in cuneiform, using a wedge-tipped reed stylus to print a mark on a soft clay tablet which would be exposed in the sun to harden to create a permanent record.

The Babylonians, who were famous for their astronomical observations, as well as their calculations (aided by their invention of the abacus), used a sexagesimal (base-60) positional numeral system inherited from either the Sumerian or the Akkadian civilizations. Neither of the predecessors was a positional system (having a convention for which &#x27;end&#x27; of the numeral represented the units).

==Origin==
This system first appeared around 2000 BC; its structure reflects the decimal lexical numerals of Semitic languages rather than Sumerian lexical numbers. However, the use of a special Sumerian sign for 60 (beside two Semitic signs for the same number) attests to a relation with the Sumerian system.
==Symbols==
The Babylonian system is credited as being the first known positional numeral system, in which the value of a particular digit depends both on the digit itself and its position within the number. This was an extremely important development because non-place-value systems require unique symbols to represent each power of a base (ten, one hundred, one thousand, and so forth), which can make calculations more difficult.

Only two symbols (𒁹 to count units and 𒌋 to count tens) were used to notate the 59 non-zero digits. These symbols and their values were combined to form a digit in a sign-value notation quite similar to that of Roman numerals; for example, the combination 𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹 represented the digit for 23 (see table of digits above). 

These digits were used to represent larger numbers in the base 60 (sexagesimal) positional system. For example, 𒁹𒁹 𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹 𒁹𒁹𒁹 would represent 2×602+23×60+3 = 8583.

A space was left to indicate a place without value, similar to the modern-day zero. Babylonians later devised a sign to represent this empty place. They lacked a symbol to serve the function of radix point, so the place of the units had to be inferred from context: 𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹 could have represented 23, 23×60 (𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹␣), 23×60×60 (𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹␣␣), or 23/60, etc.

Their system clearly used internal decimal to represent digits, but it was not really a mixed-radix system of bases 10 and 6, since the ten sub-base was used merely to facilitate the representation of the large set of digits needed, while the place-values in a digit string were consistently 60-based and the arithmetic needed to work with these digit strings was correspondingly sexagesimal.

The legacy of sexagesimal still survives to this day, in the form of degrees (360° in a circle or 60° in an angle of an equilateral triangle), arcminutes, and arcseconds in trigonometry and the measurement of time, although both of these systems are actually mixed radix.

A common theory is that 60, a superior highly composite number (the previous and next in the series being 12 and 120), was chosen due to its prime factorization: 2×2×3×5, which makes it divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60. Integers and fractions were represented identically—a radix point was not written but rather made clear by context.

===Zero===
The Babylonians did not technically have a digit for, nor a concept of, the number zero. Although they understood the idea of nothingness, it was not seen as a number—merely the lack of a number. Later Babylonian texts used a placeholder () to represent zero, but only in the medial positions, and not on the right-hand side of the number, as we do in numbers like .

<text>Ripponden is a village and civil parish on the River Ryburn near Halifax in West Yorkshire, England. Historically it was part of the West Riding of Yorkshire. Its population was 6,412 at the time of the 2001 Census, and 7,421 in 2011.

Ripponden is the main settlement in a small group of villages (Barkisland, Ripponden, Rishworth and Soyland) whose citizens are represented on Ripponden Parish Council. The area is a substantial part of the Ryburn Ward, itself part of Calderdale metropolitan borough.

Ripponden and its villages were formerly served by the Rishworth branch line from Sowerby Bridge; Ripponden and Barkisland railway station closed to passengers in 1929 and the line was closed completely in 1958.

The area is of archaeological note as it is rich in neolithic and Bronze Age remains. At nearby Ringstone Edge can be found a small stone circle.

Ripponden is the terminus of the annual Sowerby Bridge Rushbearing Festival.

The village is on the route of the Calderdale Way, a circular walk around the hills and valleys of Calderdale.

Ripponden Junior &amp; Infant School has a capacity of 240 children ages 4 - 11.

The Old Bridge Inn in the village is the home of an annual pork pie competition. The Old Bridge Inn is a Grade II listed building and is one of the oldest pubs in Yorkshire; its construction is dated to 1307. The Old Bridge, or Waterloo Bridge, near the Inn is on the old packhorse road through the village and is also known as the Packhorse Bridge.

On 6 July 2014, Stage 2 of the 2014 Tour de France, from York to Sheffield, passed through the village. On leaving Ripponden at the point, riders undertook the third climb of the stage, the Category 3 Côte de Ripponden. It was long with an average gradient of 8.6%. The first rider over the top to claim two points in the King of the Mountains competition was Cyril Lemoine of Cofidis. The other point available was claimed by David De La Cruz Melgarejo.

==Notable people==
* James Walton, inventor and industrialist, born in Ripponden in 1803.
* Sir Norman Howard Bottomley, Air Chief Marshal of the RAF and Commander-in-Chief of RAF Bomber Command in 1945, was born in Ripponden in 1891.
* Nobel Prize–winning American physicist Prof Richard Feynman was a regular visitor to the village in the 1960s–1980s, with his third wife Gweneth Hogarth, who was born locally. He also spent significant time in nearby Mill Bank.

==Sport==
The village has a football team Ryburn United FC, they are a Charter Standard Community football club, and provide football for all ages, their grounds are on Ripponden Wood Playing Fields. Stones Cricket Club play near the village and are members of the Halifax Cricket League.

<text>Rothwell is a town in the south-east of the City of Leeds metropolitan borough in West Yorkshire, England, situated between Leeds and Wakefield. It is located in the eponymous Rothwell ward of Leeds City Council and Elmet and Rothwell parliamentary constituency, and is part of the West Yorkshire Urban Area.

At the 2011 census the ward had a population of 20,354. As of the 2021 census, Rothwell has a population of 20,600. The town is close to the A1/M1 link road and the Stourton park and ride. The nearest railway station is Woodlesford.

==History==

=== Early history ===
Rothwell was mentioned in the Domesday Book, an 11th-century landholding survey commissioned by King William the Conqueror, as &quot;Rodewelle&quot;.

One of the royal lodge’s documented owners was John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, who is supposed to have killed the last wild boar in England while hunting nearby; hence, a boar’s head formed part of the arms of the former Rothwell Urban District Council.

The parish church (Church Street) is dedicated to the Holy Trinity and is on the site of an Anglo-Saxon predecessor. The current church, which has a ring of eight bells, is of medieval origins but was substantially rebuilt in the 19th century: the tower retains medieval fabric believed to be from the 15th century. John Blenkinsop (1783–1831), a pioneer in the use of steam locomotives on the nearby Middleton Railway, is buried at the church.
The town was granted the rights of a market town in the 15th century and a twice-yearly fair. The tradition of a fair is maintained by the annual carnival which is organised by the Rothwell Entertainments Committee. May Day is celebrated beside the stone cross and on the Pastures on the first Monday Bank Holiday in May, while Rothwell Carnival is held in Springhead Park on the second Saturday of July every year. Rothwell Town Hall was completed in 1895.

A notable landmark of the town is an arch made of whale jawbones, which has marked the northern boundary by the junction with Wood Lane and the A61 road for over 100 years.

Rothwell is part of the historic Rhubarb Triangle, with the town and surrounding areas famed for having once produced 90% of the world’s winter forced rhubarb from the forcing sheds that were common across the fields there.

===20th century===
St George&#x27;s Hospital was situated off Wood Lane where now exists Castle Lodge Avenue and associated houses. It was built in 1903 to a design by Leeds architect Edward J. Dodgshun by the Rothwell, Methley and Hunslet Joint Isolation Hospital Committee which was formed under the Isolation Hospitals Act 1893 by an order of the West Riding County Council 10 January 1900. When first constructed it was known as the New Union Workhouse and Infirmary for the Hunslet Union. On being taken over by the Leeds Public Assistance Committee in 1934, it was renamed St George’s Hospital. In 1934 it was transferred to the Leeds Health Committee. In 1948 the hospital was managed by the Leeds Group B Hospital Management Committee. After local government reorganisation in 1974, it was transferred to the Leeds Eastern District and soon after to the Leeds Western District, and was closed in December 1991. From 1934 the hospital provided accommodation for the elderly ill, patients with chronic and acute mental illness, persons with learning disabilities, a maternity ward and a separate isolation ward. The site was developed for housing at the start of the 21st century, but the original tall clock tower remains.

Rothwell Temperance Band is a Championship section brass band founded in Rothwell in 1984. Although they do not rehearse in Rothwell itself, instead rehearsing in Wakefield, they have strong connections with the town and hold many concerts for the local community. The closest Champion Section Brass Band is the Yorkshire Imperial Urquhart Travel Band, formerly of the Yorkshire Imperial Copperworks based in Stourton, from which the band is named. In 2000, the Wallace Arnold (Rothwell) Band merged with the Yorkshire Imperial Urquhart Travel Band, which became for some time the Yorkshire Imperial DUT (Rothwell) Band.
Rothwell has a long history of coal mining. It was a site of early mining, using a system known as bell pits. Coal mining has been carried out in the area for over 600 years. There were many local pits including the Fanny, the Rose and Rothwell Water Haigh. As the reserves as Rothwell Haigh Colliery were exhausted, production ended on 9 December 1983, with the majority of the 650 men employed transferring to the new Selby Coalfield. Whereas some mineworkers moved house closer to Selby, many commuted daily from Rothwell to Selby for years. After closure, the old coking plant site at Haigh Colliery remained within the Coal Products Division of the NCB until privatisation in 1994, at which point former employees banded together to buy the site and later sold the site to a housing developer. In 1995, Leeds City Council and Leeds Groundwork formed a partnership which, together with local residents and community groups, transformed the former colliery site into a 124-acre country park with a sculpture trail, a pond trail, and a habitat for various forms of flora and fauna.

===21st century===

The introduction of Leeds Valley Park in the early 21st century and its subsequent expansions have caused concerns for residents due to the parking problems caused on neighbouring Wood Lane. This is despite numerous efforts by local councillors, and the community, to include further parking restrictions.

===Administrative history===
Rothwell was an ancient parish, comprising five townships: Lofthouse with Carlton, Middleton, Oulton with Woodlesford, Thorpe and a Rothwell township covering the old village itself and adjoining areas (the latter township also being known as &quot;Rothwell with Rothwell Haigh and Royds Green&quot;). All such townships also became civil parishes in 1866.

The Rothwell township was made a local government district in 1872, governed by a local board. The district was enlarged in 1892 to also include the townships of Lofthouse with Carlton and Thorpe. Such districts were converted into urban districts in 1894. Shortly afterwards, Rothwell Urban District Council built itself new council offices on Marsh Street in 1895/6.

The Rothwell Urban District was enlarged in 1937, absorbing Oulton with Woodlesford from the abolished Hunslet Rural District, and Methley, which had been a separate urban district. Rothwell Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, with the area becoming part of the metropolitan borough of the City of Leeds. As the 1972 Act went through parliament there was a local campaign to have Rothwell included in the Wakefield district instead of Leeds. This was accepted as an amendment to the bill in the House of Commons but was overturned in the House of Lords.

== Town centre ==

The town centre contains a variety of high street chains, independent shops, restaurants and bars, and pubs.

In 2007, the town centre experienced major redevelopments to respect the local area&#x27;s conservation status, pedestrianising and restoring the original route of Commercial Street.

A new bus interchange funded by the West Yorkshire combined authority, was due to be constructed in 2022 within Marsh street car park with provision of driver restrooms and infrastructure for future electric buses. However, as of 2024, this was paused until funding becomes available.

<doc id="152328" wikidata="Q241504" url="?curid=152328" title="Rocky III">
<text>Rocky III is a 1982 American sports drama film written, directed by, and starring Sylvester Stallone. The film is the sequel to &quot;Rocky II&quot; (1979) and the third installment in the &quot;Rocky&quot; film series. It also stars Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, and Burgess Meredith. In the film, Rocky Balboa (Stallone) faces stiff competition from Clubber Lang (Mr. T), a powerful new contender, and turns to his old adversary Apollo Creed (Weathers) to help him train.

Development of the film began soon after the release of its predecessor. Stallone began a strict diet and workout regimen in preparation for &quot;Rocky III&quot;. Despite the returns of the original cast being secured quickly, casting for Lang proved difficult, with real boxers Joe Frazier and Ernie Shavers attached to the project at various points. Mr. T was hired in 1981 after appearing on the television series &quot;Games People Play&quot; and the film is considered his breakthrough role. &quot;Rocky III&quot; is the first film in the franchise not solely distributed by United Artists, due to the company&#x27;s merger with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1981.

&quot;Rocky III&quot; was released in the United States on May 28, 1982, by MGM/UA Entertainment Co. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its action sequences and music but criticism for its screenplay, with some critics deeming the film unnecessary. Retrospective reviews have been more positive and the movie gained a strong cult following. &quot;Rocky III&quot; grossed $270 million worldwide, surpassing its predecessors to become the then-highest grossing film in the franchise, and the fourth highest grossing film at the domestic box office and the second highest grossing film of 1982 worldwide. Its theme song, &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot;, became a hit single and received a nomination for Best Original Song at the 55th Academy Awards. The sequel, &quot;Rocky IV&quot;, was released in 1985.

==Plot==
In 1981, five years after winning the world heavyweight championship against Apollo Creed, Rocky Balboa has had a string of ten successful title defenses and his fame, wealth, and celebrity profile have increased. Rocky&#x27;s manager, Mickey Goldmill, worriedly eyes a young and powerful contender rapidly rising through the ranks, James &quot;Clubber&quot; Lang. While unveiling a statue of himself at the stairway by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Rocky begins to announce his retirement but is cut short when Lang, now the number-one contender, publicly challenges him. Lang accuses Rocky of intentionally accepting challenges from lesser opponents and goads Rocky into accepting his fight for the title.

Mickey initially wants no part of it; pressed by Rocky, Mickey confesses that he handpicked the opponents for Rocky&#x27;s title defenses to spare him from another beating of the kind that Creed gave him in their rematch. He explains that Lang is young, powerful, and &quot;hungry&quot;; by contrast, Rocky is &quot;civilized&quot; and no longer has the stamina and strength to fight a boxer of Lang&#x27;s caliber. Rocky, shattered by the realization that all of his fights have been stacked in his favor, convinces Mickey to work with him for one last fight. Despite his promise to Mickey to &quot;live in the gym&quot;, Rocky insists on allowing the public to watch him train in a crowded hotel ballroom filled with distractions. In contrast, Lang trains alone with ruthless determination and vigor.

Lang and Rocky meet at Philadelphia&#x27;s Spectrum on August 15, 1981. Pandemonium erupts backstage as Mickey is violently shoved by Lang, resulting in a heart attack (Mickey had a heart issue earlier in the film during Rocky&#x27;s charity fight with pro wrestler Thunderlips). Distraught, Rocky wants to call the match off, but Mickey urges him on while he receives medical care in the dressing room. Rocky&#x27;s lack of preparation is worsened by his concern for Mickey, preventing him from fully concentrating on the fight. The match begins with Rocky pounding Lang with several huge blows, looking for an early knockout, but Lang quickly recovers and takes charge, dominating Rocky and finishing him off with a haymaker left hook in the second round, winning the world heavyweight championship. After the match, Rocky tells a dying Mickey that the match ended in a second-round knockout without saying who the victor was. Mickey tells Rocky, &quot;I love ya, kid&quot;, and dies. Rocky, lapsing into severe depression, mourns over Mickey&#x27;s death.

Stopping by Mickey&#x27;s closed gym, the forlorn Rocky encounters his former rival, Apollo Creed, who witnessed the match as a guest analyst. Apollo offers to help train Rocky for a rematch against Lang in exchange for a future favor, which Rocky accepts. Apollo then takes Rocky to the gym where he once trained, Tough Gym in Los Angeles. Apollo becomes frustrated by Rocky&#x27;s lack of effort, as the latter is still haunted by nightmares of Lang and unable to train without Mickey by his side. However, Rocky regains his focus after Adrian helps him come to terms with Mickey&#x27;s death. Apollo and his manager, Tony &quot;Duke&quot; Evers, infuse Rocky&#x27;s undisciplined brawling style with more of Apollo&#x27;s trademark footwork, skill, and speed, rebuilding him into a more complete fighter. During the training process, Apollo and Rocky become close friends.

After months of training, the rematch takes place at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Apollo lends Rocky the American flag trunks that he wore during their first match. At the outset of the match, Rocky sprints from his corner, battering Lang with a level of skill and spirit that no one ever expected. Rocky completely dominates the first round, leaving Lang enraged and bewildered after the bell. Lang gains the upper hand in the second round, and Rocky adopts an entirely different strategy that angers and confuses Apollo by intentionally taking a beating from Lang, even getting knocked down twice, all the while taunting Lang that he cannot knock him out. By the third round, Lang, who is used to winning matches swiftly with knockouts in the early rounds, loses his temper and starts throwing punches wildly as Rocky taunts him, gradually running out of stamina. With Lang rattled and vulnerable, Rocky strikes back with a flurry of punches, culminating in a brutal knockout to reclaim the heavyweight championship.

Afterward, Rocky fulfills Apollo&#x27;s favor: a third, private rematch with him at Mighty Mick&#x27;s Gym. The film concludes without showing the result, but freezes into an oil painting of two boxers simultaneously throwing the first punch, showing two equally skilled athletes facing each other not as rivals, but as friends.

==Cast==
* Sylvester Stallone as Robert &quot;Rocky&quot; Balboa, &quot;The Italian Stallion&quot;: the heavyweight champion of the world who continues to defend his title against other fighters. When Lang challenges Rocky and wins, the public cries for a rematch. As Rocky is reluctant following Mickey&#x27;s death, former rival, Apollo Creed, befriends and trains The Italian Stallion in his preparation to take on Clubber Lang.
* Talia Shire as Adrian Pennino Balboa: Rocky&#x27;s wife and supporter throughout his boxing career.
* Burt Young as Paulie Pennino: Rocky&#x27;s best friend and brother-in-law.
* Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed: The former Heavyweight Champion and Rocky&#x27;s former arch-rival, who agrees to train him after the death of Mickey. In the process, the two become very close friends.
* Burgess Meredith as Michael &quot;Mickey&quot; Goldmill: Rocky&#x27;s friend, manager, and trainer, who unexpectedly dies; a former bantamweight fighter from the 1920s and the owner of the boxing gym where Rocky trained for his first fight against Apollo.
* Tony Burton as Tony &quot;Duke&quot; Evers: Apollo Creed&#x27;s father figure, friend, trainer, and manager, who helps Apollo train Rocky.
* Mr. T as James &quot;Clubber&quot; Lang: The underdog challenger who beats Rocky in a championship fight, amidst the unexpected death of Mickey. The public&#x27;s general dislike and lack of respect for him as the Heavyweight Champion of the World leads to a rematch with Rocky. Orphaned at an early age, Lang spent most of his childhood on the streets of Chicago&#x27;s South Side as well as spending time in orphanages and juvenile facilities. As an adult, Clubber was sent to prison for five years for one count of a felony and/or assault charge. While serving his sentence, he discovered his talent as a boxer. Boxing was a way to let out his frustration, which led to the events of &quot;Rocky III&quot;.
* Ina Fried as Robert &quot;Rocky&quot; Balboa, Jr.: Rocky and Adrian&#x27;s only child.
* Hulk Hogan as &quot;Thunderlips&quot;: The current world wrestling champion, who fights Rocky in an exhibition charity event.

In addition to the main cast several others had cameo appearances. Bill Baldwin and Stu Nahan returned as the fight commentators for the two Rocky-Lang fights. Veteran ring announcer Jimmy Lennon was the ring announcer for the first Lang fight, while boxing judge Marty Denkin was the referee. Lou Filippo returned for his third appearance as a referee during the second Lang fight. Dennis James (&quot;Price Is Right&quot;) and Jim Healy appeared as the commentators for the Rocky–Thunderlips match, while LeRoy Neiman was the guest ring announcer. Jim Hill was a TV announcer. A then-unknown Morgan Freeman auditioned unsuccessfully for the role of Lang&#x27;s trainer. Footage of Stallone&#x27;s guest appearance on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; was incorporated in the opening sequence, with Jim Henson dubbing Kermit the Frog&#x27;s announcement that the episode&#x27;s guest was Rocky Balboa, rather than Stallone.

==Production==
===Development and writing===

For the role of Clubber Lang, two real world-class heavyweight boxers were first considered: Joe Frazier and Earnie Shavers. Both were about the same height as Sylvester Stallone and had the powerful physique he was looking for, but, according to casting director Rhonda Young, Frazier had a stuttering problem, while Shavers had a high-pitched voice which would have undermined the character&#x27;s menacing presence. After looking far and wide (even going to prisons in the hope of finding a suitable antagonist), Rhonda Young stumbled upon a television program on NBC, &quot;America&#x27;s Toughest Bouncer&quot;, showcasing a sports competition, and was mesmerized by the winner&#x27;s physical prowess as well as his charisma. She then called the producer, Don Ohlmeyer, to ask him about &quot;the man with the mohawk&quot;. It turned out that not only was Mr. T a perfect fit, but he also proved tremendously determined to give the best possible performance right from the first screen test, for what would be his breakout role.

In preparation for the film, Stallone claims to have got his body fat percentage down to his all-time low of 2.6% and weighed . He stated that he ate only ten egg whites and a piece of toast a day, having a fruit every third day. His training consisted of a two-mile jog in the morning followed by two hours of weight training, a nap during the afternoon followed by 18 rounds of sparring, another weight training session, and finishing the day with a swim.

====Chart positions====
==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Rocky III&quot; was an enormous box office success and surpassed the gross of its predecessor. The film grossed $16,015,408 in its opening weekend. It was dropped to second place behind &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; during its second weekend and it was dropped to third place behind &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; and &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; during its third weekend and earned $125,049,125 during its North American theatrical run, becoming the fourth highest-grossing film of 1982; its worldwide box-office earnings stand at around $270 million. Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel attributed the film&#x27;s success to the positive reaction from critics and audiences towards &quot;Rocky II&quot; and the production team&#x27;s &quot;quality control&quot; of that film. Siskel stated, &quot;If you want a hugely successful series, then make sure that the second one is a winner.&quot;

===Critical response===
&quot;Rocky III&quot; holds a score of 67% rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 44 reviews, with an average of 5.7/10. The film&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;It&#x27;s noticeably subject to the law of diminishing returns, but &quot;Rocky III&quot; still has enough brawny spectacle to stand in the ring with the franchise&#x27;s better entries&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100 based on reviews from 10 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. The film is one of the few which has received the rare A+ grade from audiences surveyed by CinemaScore.

Gene Siskel gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, &quot;Sorry to say this, but there&#x27;s not anything new in &quot;Rocky III&quot;, and we sit there wondering why it exists.&quot; He added that &quot;we see nothing new about Rocky&#x27;s character, except that the tender side of his soul, which made him so appealing, is now virtually missing. Rocky Balboa in &quot;Rocky III&quot; is no longer likable.&quot; Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; stated, &quot;The first &quot;Rocky&quot; was primitive in a relatively innocent way. This picture is primitive, but it&#x27;s also shrewd and empty and inept.&quot; Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Somehow, Sylvester Stallone has kicked life into what you might imagine is a pretty tired Rocky Balboa and has gotten him up on his feet again ... &quot;Rocky III&quot; works, possibly even better than numbers &quot;I&quot; and &quot;II&quot;.&quot; Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;as much fun as ever, a ground-meat-and-potatoes movie, with guys beating hell out of each other to a disco beat.&quot; Tom Milne of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;Starting off with a replay of our hero&#x27;s second miraculous return from the dead to win the championship back at the end of &quot;Rocky II&quot;—itself a virtual repeat from the original &quot;Rocky&quot;—&quot;Rocky III&quot; soon demonstrates that it has nothing to offer but more of the same ... There are fleeting moments, thanks chiefly to a personable performance from Carl Weathers, but the time has surely come for Rocky Balboa to take the final count.&quot;

===Accolades===
===Year-end lists===
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2004: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:

==Other media==
===Sequel===

A sequel titled &quot;Rocky IV&quot;, was released in November 1985.

===&quot;Rocky&quot; statue in Philadelphia===

A bronze statue of Rocky, called &quot;ROCKY&quot;, was commissioned by Sylvester Stallone and created by A. Thomas Schomberg in 1981. Three statues were created, and one was placed on the top of the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art for the filming of &quot;Rocky III&quot;. After filming was complete, a furious debate erupted in Philadelphia between the Art Museum and the City&#x27;s Art Commission over the meaning of &quot;art&quot;. Claiming the statue was not &quot;art&quot; but rather a &quot;movie prop&quot; the city considered various alternative locations and settled upon the front of the Spectrum in South Philadelphia. It was later returned to the Art Museum where it was used in the filming of &quot;Rocky V&quot;, as well as &quot;Mannequin&quot; and &quot;Philadelphia&quot;. Afterward, it was again moved to the front of the Spectrum. The statue was returned to the bottom of the museum&#x27;s stairs on 8 September 2006. The steps leading to the east entrance of the Philadelphia Museum of Art are also known as “The Rocky Steps.” A similar statue is located in Žitište, Serbia.

===Novelization===
A novelization by Robert E. Hoban was published by Ballantine Books in 1982.

===Video game===
A video game based on the film was released in 1983, titled &quot;Rocky Super Action Boxing&quot;, designed by Coleco and released for ColecoVision. Players can play as either Rocky Balboa or Clubber Lang either against the computer in a one-player game, or against each other in a &quot;Head to Head&quot; two-player mode. In 1987, &quot;Rocky&quot;, based on the first four &quot;Rocky&quot; films, was released. In 2002, &quot;Rocky&quot; was released, based on the first five &quot;Rocky&quot; films. In 2004, &quot;Rocky Legends&quot;, based on the first four &quot;Rocky&quot; films, was released.

<text>Saltaire is a Victorian model village near Shipley, West Yorkshire, England, situated between the River Aire, the railway, and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. Salts Mill and the houses were built by Titus Salt between 1851 and 1871 to allow his workers to live in better conditions than the slums of Bradford. The mill ceased production in 1986, and was converted into a multifunctional location with an art gallery, restaurants, and the headquarters of a technology company. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and on the European Route of Industrial Heritage.

== History ==
Saltaire was commissioned in 1851 by Sir Titus Salt, a leading industrialist in the Yorkshire woollen industry. The name of the village is a combination of the founder&#x27;s surname and the name of the river. Salt moved his business (five separate mills) from Bradford to this site near Shipley to arrange his workers and to site his large textile mill by the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the railway. Salt employed the local architects Francis Lockwood and William Mawson.

Similar, but considerably smaller, projects had also been started around the same time by Edward Akroyd at Copley and by Henry Ripley at Ripley Ville. The cotton mill village of New Lanark, which is also a World Heritage site, was founded by David Dale in 1786.

Salt built neat stone houses for his workers (much better than the slums of Bradford), wash-houses with tap water, bath-houses, a hospital and an institute for recreation and education, with a library, a reading room, a concert hall, billiard room, science laboratory and a gymnasium. The village had a school for the children of the workers, almshouses, allotments, a park and a boathouse. Recreational initiatives were also encouraged such as the establishment of a drum and fife band for school age boys and a brass band, precursor of today&#x27;s Hammonds Saltaire Band, for men of the village.

With the combination of quality housing, employment, recreation, educational facilities and social services the model town represented a landmark example of enlightened 19th century urban planning. The building phase was nearing completion in 1871. The census from that year shows that Saltaire had 800 dwellings (755 houses and 45 almshouses), which contained 4,389 people. In October 1872, Saltaire, along with Dean Clough Mill in Halifax, were featured highlights of the Japanese Government&#x27;s Iwakura Mission tour of modern industrial Britain.

Sir Titus died in 1876 and was interred in the mausoleum adjacent to the Congregational church. When Sir Titus Salt&#x27;s son, Titus Salt Junior, died, Saltaire was taken over by a partnership which included Sir James Roberts from Haworth.

Roberts had worked in wool mills since the age of eleven. He had significant business interests in Russia, and spoke Russian fluently. Roberts came to own Saltaire, but chose to invest his money heavily in Russia, losing some of his fortune in the Russian Revolution. He endowed a chair of Russian at Leeds University and bought the Brontës&#x27; Haworth Parsonage for the nation. He is mentioned in T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;. Roberts is buried at Fairlight, East Sussex. His legacy can still be seen in Saltaire: he named Roberts Park, to the north of the river, after his son when he gave it to Bradford Council in 1920.

Saltaire village remained under the ownership of the Mill until it was sold by Messrs. Salts (Saltaire) Ltd. to the Bradford Property Trust Ltd. on 31 July 1933. In October 1933, the new owners came to an arrangement with Shipley Urban District Council to carry out improvements, including the renewal of gas services, provision of mains electricity, along with sewerage and sanitary improvements. This included &quot;a comprehensive scheme to eliminate the waste water lavatories and the old type of coal store, and to erect new in their places.&quot; The full scheme included the removal of 43 houses to open out certain parts of the village.

== Saltaire today ==

In December 2001, Saltaire was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. This means that the government has a duty to protect the site. The buildings belonging to the model village are individually listed, with the highest level of protection given to the Congregational church (since 1972 Saltaire United Reformed Church) which is listed grade I. The village has survived remarkably complete, but further protection is needed as the village is blighted by traffic through the Aire Valley, an important east-west route. A bypass is proposed to relieve traffic pressure. Roberts Park, on the north side of the river, suffered from neglect and vandalism but has been restored by Bradford Council. In July 2014 it was announced that planning officers had compiled a list of replacement front doors that were deemed to be &quot;not in keeping with the buildings&#x27; historic status.&quot;
Saltaire is a conservation area. Victoria Hall (originally the Saltaire Institute) is used for meetings, community events and concerts, and houses a Wurlitzer theatre pipe organ. The village is served by Saltaire railway station.

The Saltaire Festival, which first took place in 2003 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the foundation of Saltaire, is held every year over 11 days in September. The Saltaire Arts Trail is a visual arts festival that takes place each May. Its public events include art exhibitions, children&#x27;s activities, a Makers Fair, and Open Houses where residents open their homes which become temporary art galleries.

Politically, Saltaire is part of the Shipley electoral ward of the City of Bradford, of the Saltaire and Hirstwood ward of Shipley Town Council, and part of the parliamentary constituency of Shipley, currently represented by Anna Dixon of the Labour Party. From 1999 to 2005, parliamentarians from three chambers, Chris Leslie MP in the House of Commons, Lord Wallace of Saltaire in the House of Lords and Richard Corbett MEP in the European Parliament, all lived in Saltaire.

== Proposed bypass ==

Saltaire is surrounded by a buffer zone established to protect the context of the World Heritage Site. Concerns have been raised over plans announced by Bradford Council and Action Airedale to site a bypass through the buffer zone to either side of the World Heritage Site and to tunnel beneath the village. Within sight of the mill, the tunnel would follow the line of the railway and exit behind the United Reformed Church. As it would pass alongside the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, it could impact on this Conservation Area. The route would impact on an ancient semi-natural woodland and the Woodland Garden of Remembrance at Nab Wood Cemetery.

No progress on a bypass for Saltaire has been made as it has been described as &quot;financially unviable&quot;. Instead Bradford Council are focussing on the Shipley Eastern Relief Road, which will feed traffic into Bradford along the existing Canal Road Corridor.

== Salts Mill today ==
Salts Mill closed as a textile mill in February 1986, and Jonathan Silver bought it the following year and began renovating it. Today, it houses a mixture of business, commerce, leisure, and residential use. In the main mill building are:
* The 1853 art gallery: several large rooms given over to the works of the Bradford-born artist David Hockney: including paintings, drawings, photomontages, and stage sets.
* Industrial companies including the electronics manufacturer ARRIS International plc (formerly Pace plc).
* Various shops. In 2006, there are shops selling books, art supplies, jewellery, outdoor wear, antiques, suits, bicycles, and housewares; the last includes pieces by internationally known designers such as Alvar Aalto and Philippe Starck.
* Restaurants and cafes.

The &quot;New Mill&quot;, on the other side of the canal, is divided between offices for the local National Health Service Trusts and residential flats.

== Media ==
Film footage of Saltaire and the nearby Shipley Glen Tramway in 1914 is held by the Yorkshire Film Archive. A two-minute short clip showing workers leaving Salts Mill on 24 July 1900 is held by the British Film Institute.

<text>Copley is a village in the metropolitan borough of Calderdale, in the county of West Yorkshire, England, south of Halifax and east of Sowerby Bridge. It is situated by the River Calder and the Calder and Hebble Navigation canal.

==Facilities==

It was served by Copley railway station from 1856 to 1931.

Today the village has a hairdressers, a health spa, a garage, Land Rover and Camper Van dealerships and one pub, The Volunteer Arms. St Stephens Church, built in 1861-1865 by Colonel Edward Akroyd for the workers at his textile mill is an early work of the local architect William Henry Crossland.

The village has two sports clubs, Copley Cricket Club who play in the Halifax Cricket League and the Old Rishworthian rugby team. Both clubs are well established and Old Rishworthians currently play in Yorkshire 1 (level 7) of the RFU National League structure. Both clubs are located in picturesque settings with the Calder and Hebble Navigation to the north and the River Calder to the south. The main Leeds to Manchester railway line is near both grounds. Sporting events are held at both locations, as well as various other special functions throughout the year.

One of the key computer data centres for Lloyds Banking Group is located a few miles outside the village. This was formerly the main data centre for HBOS before the merger between Lloyds and HBOS.

==Education==
Copley Primary School is situated on Wakefield Road in Copley which sits within the catchment area for Ryburn Valley High School.

<doc id="152333" wikidata="Q83116" url="?curid=152333" title="Provinces of Belgium">
<text>The Kingdom of Belgium is divided into three regions. Two of these regions, Flanders and Wallonia, are each subdivided into five provinces. The third region, Brussels, does not belong to any province, nor is it subdivided into provinces. Instead, it has amalgamated both regional and provincial functions into a single &quot;Capital Region&quot; administration. 

Most of the provinces take their name from earlier duchies and counties of similar location, while their territory is mostly based on the departments installed during French annexation. At the time of the creation of Belgium in 1830, only nine provinces existed, including the province of Brabant, which held the City of Brussels. In 1995, Brabant was split into three areas: Flemish Brabant, which became a part of the region of Flanders; Walloon Brabant, which became part of the region of Wallonia; and the Brussels-Capital Region, which became a third region. These divisions reflected political tensions between the French-speaking Walloons and the Dutch-speaking Flemish; the Brussels-Capital Region is officially bilingual.

The division into provinces is fixed by Article 5 of the Belgian Constitution. The provinces and Brussels are subdivided into 43 administrative arrondissements, and further into 581 municipalities.

==List==

==History==

The medieval Low Countries, including present-day Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, as well as parts of modern Germany and France, comprised a number of rival and independent feudal states of varying sizes. These each had their own identities and governments, though in the early modern period almost all the Belgian states became part of larger entities (the Seventeen Provinces (1549–1581) and the Southern Netherlands (after 1581)). Prominent early states in the area of modern Belgium included the Duchy of Brabant, the County of Flanders, the Prince-Bishopric of Liège and the Duchy of Luxembourg; smaller ones included the County of Hainaut, the Duchy of Limburg and the County of Namur, though there were other small states as well.
When these territories were annexed by France in 1795, they were reorganised into &quot;départments&quot;; the borders were redrawn and the historical names were replaced by names of geographical features (generally the main river of the area).
At the end of French rule and the creation of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815, the departmental territories were generally retained but were renamed into provinces and the historical names returned. At the time of the independence of Belgium from the Netherlands in 1830, Belgium&#x27;s territory simply consisted of the existing nine southern provinces. The first article of the Belgian Constitution said: &quot;Belgium is divided into provinces. These provinces are Antwerp, Brabant, West Flanders, East Flanders, Hainaut, Liège, Limburg, Luxembourg, Namur, except for the relations of Luxembourg with the German Confederation.&quot; As such, each of the modern provinces of Belgium (with the exception of Antwerp) takes its name from one of the medieval predecessors, whereas the borders largely correspond to those of the French departments, which in most cases differ substantially from the historical entities.

In 1839, as part of the Treaty of London, half of the province of Limburg became part of the Netherlands, which consequently has its own province of Limburg.

In 1920, following the First World War, Belgium annexed the Eupen-Malmedy territory, which became part of Liège Province.

During the second half of the 20th century, Belgium transitioned from a unitary state to a federal state with three Communities and three Regions. As part of the state reforms, the (bilingual) province of Brabant was split in 1995 three ways: into two (unilingual) provinces (Flemish Brabant and Walloon Brabant) and into the (bilingual) Brussels-Capital Region. (The Brussels-Capital Region does not belong to any province, is not a province, and does not contain any provinces.) The two new Brabant provinces became part of the Flemish Region and the Walloon Region respectively. The remaining eight provinces became part of these regions as well, so the Flemish Region and the Walloon Region each contain five provinces.

===Schematic overview===
The following table presents a simplified overview of the evolution of the French departments into the present-day Belgian provinces.

==Provincial governments==
The provincial government consists of three main branches: the &quot;Provincial Council&quot;, which is the legislative body, the &quot;Deputation&quot; or &quot;Provincial College&quot;, which is the executive body, and the &quot;Governor&quot;, who is appointed by the regional government (i.e. the Flemish or Walloon Government).

The Provincial Councils (; ) are the representative bodies of the population of the provinces. This is the equivalent of the States-Provincial in the Netherlands. The numbers of seats in the Provincial Councils are proportional to the population of the province; the numbers were reduced in both Flanders and Wallonia, starting 2013 (following the 2012 elections). They are directly elected each six years, at the same time of the municipal elections. Before 1994, the provincial elections instead coincided with the national elections. Until then, the provincial councils also appointed Provincial Senators to the Belgian Senate. The last elections were held on 14 October 2018.

The executive branch was previously called the &quot;Permanent Deputation&quot;. In the Flemish Region it is now simply called the Deputation () and it consists of the Governor and six Deputies elected by the Provincial Council from among its members. Following the next 2018 election, there will be one Deputy less, i.e. five Deputies. In the Walloon Region it is called the Provincial College () which consists of the Governor and four to five Deputies (depending on the number of inhabitants of the province) elected by the Provincial Council from among its members.

In Flemish Brabant, there is also a Deputy Governor (). The Deputy Governor is appointed by the Flemish Government on the unanimous advice of the Federal Council of Ministers and must have a considerable knowledge of both the Dutch and the French language. He is responsible for ensuring that the language legislation is observed in the municipalities in the Brussels Periphery.

Following the Fifth State Reform, the responsibility for the provincial institutions was devolved to the Regions. The Regions have the power to amend or replace the existing legislation on the provincial institutions, most notably the Provincial Law of 30 April 1836. In the Flemish Region, the Provincial Decree of 9 December 2005 applies. In the Walloon Region, the Code of Local Democracy and Decentralisation applies. The legal framework in these Regions is still very similar, but that could change in the future. Although the Regions are responsible for the provincial institutions, the Federal State has retained its responsibility over the provinces in certain cases. For instance, the Regions are responsible for the appointment of the Provincial Governors, but only after the unanimous advice of the Federal Council of Ministers. Legislation regarding the Governor and Vice-Governor of Brussels-Capital, and the Deputy Governor of Flemish Brabant, has also remained a federal competency.

==Absence of any province in the Brussels Capital Region==

The Brussels Capital Region does not belong to any province, nor does it contain any. The extraprovincial status of Brussels has existed since 1995, when the former province of Brabant, which had Brussels as its capital, was divided into the Dutch-speaking province of Flemish Brabant and the French-speaking province of Walloon Brabant.

Within this mainly French speaking region, nearly all former provincial competencies are assumed by its regional institutions and by the French Community Commission, the Flemish Community Commission or the Common Community Commission. However, the Arrondissement of Brussels-Capital has two commissioners of the Federal Government who are called &quot;Governor of the Brussels-Capital Region&quot; and &quot;Vice-Governor&quot;. The Governor exercises most of the few remaining powers elsewhere exercised by a provincial governor, particularly in the field of public order, as far as no (federal) law, (regional) decree, ordinance or decision states otherwise.

The Governor is appointed by the cabinet of the Brussels Capital Region on the unanimous advice of the Federal Council of Ministers. The regional government also appoints the Vice-Governor, who must have a considerable knowledge of both French and Dutch and who must ensure that the legislation regarding the use of the two languages is observed in Brussels.

==Proposed additional province==

Because the German-speaking Community is located entirely within Liège Province, it has been proposed on multiple occasions to create an eleventh province, the province of Eupen-Sankt Vith, which would comprise the nine municipalities of the German-speaking Community. Most of the functions carried out by provincial organs would then be exercised by the organs of the German-speaking Community.

However, the community is small in area () and has only about 76,000 inhabitants, which would make it the smallest and by far the least populated province.

==Early life==
Whitman was born on June 9, 1988 in Los Angeles, California, United States, the only child of voice actor Pat Musick and personal manager and set construction coordinator Jeffrey Whitman. She attended Ribet Academy.

==Career ==
===Early roles===
Whitman started her career at age two in a voice-over for a Tyson Chicken commercial. Because she could not read, acting coach Andrew Magarian helped her memorize lines. At age five, Whitman made her film debut alongside Meg Ryan in &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot; (1994), playing Ryan&#x27;s youngest daughter, Casey Green. She was chosen for the role over 700 other girls who auditioned. In 1996, Whitman appeared in two films: &quot;Independence Day&quot;, playing Bill Pullman&#x27;s daughter Patricia Whitmore, and &quot;One Fine Day&quot;, as George Clooney&#x27;s daughter Maggie Taylor. The same year, Whitman guest starred in the season three episode of &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;The One Where Rachel Quits&quot;. Between 1996 and 1998, she starred in 17 episodes of the David E. Kelley medical drama Chicago Hope. Later, she played Sandra Bullock&#x27;s daughter, Bernice Pruitt, in &quot;Hope Floats&quot;. Whitman played the role of Chloe Madison on &quot;JAG&quot; In several guest appearances from 1998 to 2001 before starring in the Fox Family series &quot;State of Grace&quot;. In that series, she portrayed Grace, a girl from a Catholic background who befriends Hannah (Alia Shawkat), a Jewish girl.

=== 2000s ===
From 2004 to 2006, Whitman had a recurring role on &quot;Arrested Development&quot;. She also voiced Katara on &quot;&quot; from 2005 to 2008. Whitman appeared in the 2006 series &quot;Thief&quot; for FX Networks, playing the stepdaughter of Nick Atwater (Andre Braugher). Whitman made several high-profile guest appearances in 2006 and 2007. She also appeared on &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; in the episode &quot;Nice She Ain&#x27;t&quot; as Sarah, an unscrupulous friend of Julie Mayer (Andrea Bowen). Whitman also had a recurring role on &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; (1994–2000), playing the daughter of Dr. Kate Austin (Christine Lahti), in the series&#x27; later years.

Whitman was initially cast in the 2007 series remake of &quot;Bionic Woman&quot;, playing the deaf younger sister of the title character. On June 27, 2007, &quot;TV Guide&quot; reported that Whitman was being replaced in the role of Jaime&#x27;s sister and Lucy Hale was cast as Whitman&#x27;s replacement the following July. An NBC spokesperson confirmed this, stating &quot;The decision was purely creatively driven. It is very common to change storylines, characters, actors after the initial pilot is shot.&quot; The sister character&#x27;s hearing was restored after this recasting at the request of an NBC executive.

She also appeared in the 2008 episode &quot;Streetwise&quot; of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; as an on-the-street-mother who adopts street children and testifies against her husband after her adopted daughter is murdered. She appeared in the HBO series &quot;In Treatment&quot; as the supporting character Rosie.

Whitman voiced the character Tinker Bell in the Disney &quot;eponymous film series&quot;. As part of a deal to promote the production of the first &quot;Tinker Bell&quot; film, the UK&#x27;s speaking clock started to use her voice at 0100GMT on October 26, 2008. Furthermore, she voiced Rose in &quot;American Dragon: Jake Long&quot;, and played Cynder in &quot;The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night&quot;.

=== 2010s ===

In 2009, Whitman landed a regular role in NBC&#x27;s version of the Ron Howard classic &quot;Parenthood&quot;, which premiered in 2010. She played Amber Holt, &quot;a rebellious and willful teen whose only interest at present is her wannabe rock star boyfriend.&quot; Whitman played evil ex Roxy Richter in Edgar Wright&#x27;s &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot;, a film adaptation of the Bryan Lee O&#x27;Malley indie comic series &quot;Scott Pilgrim&quot;, which also starred her former &quot;Arrested Development&quot; co-star Michael Cera in the title role. Whitman appeared on &quot;Family Guy&quot; in 2010. She had a large role in the 2012 film &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot; opposite Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller.

Whitman has recorded &quot;I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day&quot; and &quot;You Make Christmas Feel So Good&quot; for &quot;School&#x27;s Out! Christmas&quot;, and has sung guest vocals on a number of tracks from indie-punk band Fake Problems&#x27; 2010 album &quot;Real Ghosts Caught on Tape&quot;. Whitman has also been featured on her show &quot;Parenthood&quot; in the song &quot;Gardenia&quot; on the season two episode &quot;The Booth Job&quot; along with Landon Pigg. Whitman appears in the music videos for &quot;I Was a Fool&quot; and &quot;Boyfriend&quot; by Tegan and Sara. She performed a small speaking part in the rapper DVS&#x27; track &quot;Charlie Chaplin&quot; where she plays the part of what DVS sees as the stereotypical hipster expressing distaste with music and television to appear special.

In 2013, she reprised her role as Ann Veal in &quot;Arrested Development&quot;″s season four, six years after the series was canceled. She appeared alongside Darren Criss in three episodes of season three of Lisa Kudrow&#x27;s &quot;Web Therapy&quot;, playing his girlfriend. In 2015, Whitman played the lead role in the comedy &quot;The DUFF&quot;. She also started filming &quot;Operator&quot; alongside Martin Starr in June. She voiced Batgirl in DC&#x27;s &quot;Super Hero Girls&quot; series debuting on September 10, 2016. According to co-writer and director Roland Emmerich, Whitman did not reprise her role as the President&#x27;s daughter in &quot;Independence Day: Resurgence&quot;, the sequel to the 1996 blockbuster hit &quot;Independence Day&quot;, because she did not want to read for the part.

Whitman has expressed her feelings on being typecast as an outsider in various roles in television and films. She has talked about being a child actor and her relatable experiences such as being bullied in high school for being &quot;weird.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Bello Mag&quot;, Whitman explains that the entertainment industry constantly tells actors what they are &quot;not&quot; and felt her choosing of these roles was her &quot;trying to communicate to everyone&quot; who may go through similar situations, that it&#x27;s okay to be who they are. One of Whitman&#x27;s more notable quotes is, &quot;People should recognize who you are and how you can act rather than how famous you are.&quot;

In 2018, Whitman was cast alongside Retta and her &quot;Tinker Bell&quot; co-star Christina Hendricks on the NBC dramedy &quot;Good Girls&quot;. The show was renewed for a fourth season on May 15, 2020. In June 2021, the series was canceled after four seasons.

=== 2020s ===
Whitman appears in the 2020 musical film &quot;Valley Girl&quot;, a remake of the 1983 film of the same name. From 2020 to 2023, she voiced Amity Blight in &quot;The Owl House&quot;. She played a leading role in the Hulu original series &quot;Up Here&quot; in 2023, which was cancelled after one season.

== Personal life ==
On August 16, 2021, shortly after the airing of &quot;The Owl House&quot; episode &quot;Knock, Knock, Knocking on Hooty&#x27;s Door&quot;, Whitman came out as pansexual via Twitter, saying she knows she can &quot;fall in love with people of all genders&quot; and that she wished there were characters representing people like her when she was growing up. She is also open about her struggle with endometriosis, which went undiagnosed for 15 years. 

On May 12, 2024, Whitman announced she was pregnant with her first child. She gave birth to a son on August 28, 2024.

<text>Anderlecht (; ) is one of the 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region, Belgium. Located in the south-western part of the region, it is bordered by the City of Brussels, Forest, Molenbeek-Saint-Jean, and Saint-Gilles, as well as the Flemish municipalities of Dilbeek and Sint-Pieters-Leeuw. In common with all of Brussels&#x27; municipalities, it is legally bilingual (French–Dutch).

There are several historically and architecturally distinct districts within Anderlecht. , the municipality had a population of 126,581 inhabitants. The total area is , which gives a population density of . Its upper area is greener and less densely populated.

==History==

===Origins and medieval times===
The first traces of human activity on the right bank of the Senne date from the Stone Age and Bronze Age. The remnants of a Roman villa and of a Frankish necropolis were also found on the territory of Anderlecht. The first mention of the name &quot;Anderlecht&quot;, however, dates only from 1047 under the forms &quot;Anrelech&quot;, then &quot;Andrelet&quot; (1111), &quot;Andreler&quot; (1148), and &quot;Anderlech&quot; (1186). At that time, this community was already home to a chapter of canons and to two feudal manors, those of the powerful lords of Aa and of Anderlecht.

In 1356, the Count of Flanders, Louis II, fought against Brussels on the territory of Anderlecht, in the so-called &quot;Battle of Scheut&quot;, supposedly over a monetary matter. Although he defeated his sister-in-law, the Duchess of Brabant, Joanna, and briefly took her title, she regained it the following year with the help of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles IV. In 1393, Joanna&#x27;s charter made Anderlecht a part of Brussels. It is also around this time that the church of Saint Guy was rebuilt in Brabantine Gothic style above an earlier Romanesque crypt.

===15th–18th centuries===
The village of Anderlecht became a beacon of culture in the 15th and 16th centuries. In 1521, the Dutch humanist writer and theologian Erasmus of Rotterdam lived in the canons&#x27; house for a few months. Charles, Duke of Aumale and Grand Veneur of France also had a residence there.

The 17th and 18th centuries were marked by the wars between the Low Countries and France. During the Nine Years&#x27; War, it is from the high ground of Scheut, in the northern part of Anderlecht, that the bombardment of Brussels of 1695 took place. Together with the resulting fire, it was the most destructive event in the entire history of Brussels. On 13 November 1792, right after the Battle of Jemappes, General Dumouriez and the French Revolutionary army routed the Austrians there once again. Among the consequences were the disbanding of the canons and Anderlecht being proclaimed an independent municipality by the French.

By the end of the 18th century, Anderlecht including its dependencies, which extended to Brussels&#x27; city walls, counted around 2,000 inhabitants. In Scheut, on the site of the Carthusian Monastery, stood a chapel called Our Lady of Scheut, whose pleasant location, in the middle of a grove, made this place very popular at the time.

===19th century and later===
The 19th century saw a remarkable population growth, mainly because of the proximity to a rapidly expanding Brussels. The / was laid out in 1828, through the former property of the Carthusians. The population multiplied by ten between 1830 and 1890 and doubled again between 1890 and 1910. Along the / and the Brussels–Charleroi Canal, a series of industrial and working-class districts connected the centre of Anderlecht to Cureghem.

Remarkable new urban developments and garden cities such as La Roue/Het Rad, Moortebeek and / were built at the beginning of the 20th century to house the influx of newcomers. Following World War II, some remaining green parts of the municipality also made way for large-scale urban renewal following the modernist Athens Charter and Park system, such as the housing projects Scherdemael, Peterbos and Marius Renard in the upper town, and Aurore near the canal.
In recent years, Anderlecht has gained international attention thanks to its very successful football club.

==Geography==

===Location===
Anderlecht is located in the north-central part of Belgium, about from the Belgian coast and about from Belgium&#x27;s southern tip. It is located in the heartland of the Brabantian Plateau, about south of Antwerp (Flanders), and north of Charleroi (Wallonia). It is the westernmost municipality in the Brussels-Capital Region and is an important crossing point for the Brussels–Charleroi Canal, which cuts the municipality in two from the west. With an area of , it is also the third largest municipality in the region after the City of Brussels and Uccle. It is bordered by the City of Brussels, Forest, Molenbeek-Saint-Jean, and Saint-Gilles, as well as the Flemish municipalities of Dilbeek and Sint-Pieters-Leeuw.

===Climate===
Anderlecht, in common with the rest of Brussels, experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) with warm summers and cool winters. Proximity to coastal areas influences the area&#x27;s climate by sending marine air masses from the Atlantic Ocean. Nearby wetlands also ensure a maritime temperate climate. On average (based on measurements in the period 1981–2010), there are approximately 135 days of rain per year in the region. Snowfall is infrequent, averaging 24 days per year. It also often experiences violent thunderstorms in summer months.

The Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium (IRM/KMI) is located in Uccle, in the south of Brussels. The meteorological records which are carried out there are similar to those which could be carried out in Anderlecht.

==Districts==
The territory of Anderlecht is very heterogeneous and is characterised by a mixture of larger districts including smaller residential and (formerly) industrial neighbourhoods. The area along the canal is currently experiencing a large revitalisation programme, as part of the of the Brussels-Capital Region.

===Historical centre===
The historical centre of Anderlecht is the municipality&#x27;s central district. Formerly known as &quot;Rinck&quot;, it is divided into several sectors: 
* The / district, also called the / district, is the meeting point for those who hail to the heart of Anderlecht. It is also where the Place de la Vaillance/Dapperheidsplein (Anderlecht&#x27;s central square), the Church of St. Guido, the /, as well as Anderlecht&#x27;s main schools are located. The / is the municipality&#x27;s main shopping street. It is centred on the / and some neighbouring streets. 
* The smaller Aumale district in its northern part mainly comprises the / and its surrounding streets. It includes the Erasmus House (a museum devoted to the Dutch humanist writer and theologian Erasmus of Rotterdam), the old beguinage (a late medieval lay convent, now a museum dedicated to religious community life), as well as the &quot;Bibliothèque de l&#x27;Espace Maurice Carême&quot; French-language public library.

===Cureghem/Kuregem===
Located in the east of Anderlecht, Cureghem/Kuregem is one of the municipality&#x27;s largest and most populated districts. It developed during the Industrial Revolution along the Brussels–Charleroi Canal and is currently in a fragile social and economic situation due to the decline of its economy and the poor quality of some of its housing. Between 1836 and 1991, the district housed the Royal School of Veterinary Medicine, now moved to Liège but often still referred to as &quot;Cureghem&quot;. The old campus, listed as protected heritage, is currently undergoing a large rehabilitation process.

Three listed buildings—the former Atlas Brewery, the old power station, and the former Moulart Mill—are testaments to the old industrial activities next to the waterway. The Municipal Hall of Anderlecht is located on the /, at the heart of this district. In its lower part, bordering the City of Brussels, are the Square de l&#x27;Aviation/Luchtvaartsquare and the /.

===La Roue/Het Rad===

Located in the south of Anderlecht, La Roue/Het Rad (&quot;The Wheel&quot;) is one of the municipality&#x27;s largest districts and one of Brussels&#x27; main garden cities. Built in the 1920s, with its modest and picturesque houses, it offers a great vision of an early 20th-century working class neighbourhood. It is also home to one of the largest agribusiness industry campuses in Belgium: the Food and Chemical Industries Education and Research Center (CERIA/COOVI), as well as popular department stores.

===Scheut===
Located in the north of Anderlecht, Scheut is bounded by the border with the municipality of Molenbeek-Saint-Jean to the north, the historical centre of Anderlecht to the south, the Birmingham district to the east, the Scheutveld district to the west and the semi-natural site of the Scheutbos to the north-west.

It is in this district, on the /, that lay the foundations of the Scheutveld College, on 28 April 1863, by the Catholic priest Theophile Verbist. The congregation of Scheut Missionaries went on to evangelise China, Mongolia, the Philippines, as well as the Congo Free State/Belgian Congo (modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo).

==Main sights==
Anderlecht has a rich cultural and architectural heritage. Some of the main points of interest include:
* The Municipal Hall of Anderlecht, located on the /, designed in neo-Flemish Renaissance style by the architect , which was opened in 1879.
* The Collegiate Church of St. Peter and St. Guido, located in the municipality&#x27;s historical centre, on the northern side of the Place de la Vaillance/Dapperheidsplein, its main square. Its Romanesque crypt dates from the 10th century and is one of the oldest in Belgium. It contains a very old tombstone considered to be the grave of the 11th-century Saint Guy. Most of the church, however, dates from around 1350 and later, with most of the currently visible architecture representing the Ogee style (15th–16th centuries). Construction of the tower started in 1517 but ceased with the square part up to the balcony, and was not completed until 1898.
* The Erasmus House, built between 1460 and 1515, with its medicinal and philosophical gardens, which can be visited nearby. Right next to the church, the old beguinage is home to a local history museum. Both institutions are now managed jointly as the Erasmus House and Beguinage Museums.
* The Synagogue of Anderlecht, an Orthodox synagogue designed in Art Deco style by the architect and completed in 1933.
* The National Memorial to the Jewish Martyrs of Belgium, a monument commemorating the 24,600 Belgian Jewish martyrs of World War II, designed by the architects André Godart and Odon Dupire, and completed in 1970. It is located in the centre of the /, which was created for the occasion.
* The National Museum of the Resistance, which traces the history of the Belgian Resistance and German occupation of Belgium during World War II.
* The Museum of China – Scheut, which houses documents and pieces brought back to Europe by the congregation of Scheut Missionaries, including a 15th-century bronze Buddha.
* The Maurice Carême Museum, in the where the Belgian poet lived and wrote.
* The &quot;Luizenmolen&quot; in Neerpede, a replica of an old windmill which once stood on the site.
* The &quot;Cureghem Cellars&quot; (French: , Dutch: ), a subterranean complex of handmade brick caves with vaults, pillars, and arches, originally the site of a cattle market covered by a forged iron roof in the 1890s. The cellars were simply a foundation for the upper structure until the 1930s, when the city council decided to make better use of them. It proved more profitable to grow mushrooms in the dark and damp underground spaces for local consumption. It fell into disuse as a cattle market but, in 1984, the hall was officially listed as a Belgian monument. Due to its characteristic architecture and unique layout, it was refurbished and transformed by a private company, Abattoir SA. Since 1992, it has served as an event site. One of these was the anatomic exposition &quot;Body Worlds&quot; () by Gunther Von Hagens, which ran in the cellars between 2008 and 2009 and attracted over 500,000 visitors.
* The Cantillon Brewery, a gueuze museum established in an actual working brewery.
* The Museum of Medicine, located on the &quot;Erasme&quot;/&quot;Erasmus&quot; campus of the Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB).
* The Jean-Claude Van Damme statue located on the /, near the Westland Shopping Center.

<doc id="152339" wikidata="Q192859" url="?curid=152339" title="Etterbeek">
<text>Etterbeek (; ) is one of the 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region, Belgium. Located in the eastern part of the region, it is bordered by the municipalities of Auderghem, the City of Brussels, Ixelles, Schaerbeek, Woluwe-Saint-Lambert and Woluwe-Saint-Pierre. In common with all of Brussels&#x27; municipalities, it is legally bilingual (French–Dutch).

==History==

===Origins and etymology===
According to legend, Saint Gertrude of Nivelles, daughter of Pippin of Landen, founded a chapel there in the 8th century. A document by Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor, dated 966, mentions the church of &quot;Iatrebache&quot;. The name &quot;Ietrebecca&quot;—possibly from the Celtic root &quot;ett&quot; meaning &quot;rapid movement&quot; and the Dutch word &quot;beek&quot; meaning &quot;stream&quot;—is found for the first time in a document dated 1127. The current spelling appears eleven years later in 1138, around which time a newer and larger church was built.

===Middle Ages===
In the Middle Ages, Etterbeek was a rural hamlet mostly independent of Brussels, aside from taxation rights on beer given to Brussels around 1300 by John II, Duke of Brabant. The following two centuries counted several grievous moments: in 1489, Albert III, Duke of Saxony, ravaged Etterbeek in his pursuit of the rebels who fought against Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian; in 1580, the village was destroyed again, this time by iconoclasts during the Wars of Religion. Peace returned under the reigns of the Archdukes Albert VII and Isabella.

===Barony and municipality===
In 1673, Etterbeek gained its independence from neighbouring Sint-Genesius-Rode, when King Charles II of Spain promoted it into a barony. The first baron was Don Diego-Henriquez de Castro, general treasurer of the Spanish Netherlands armies. The Barony House was sold in 1767 and can still be seen today as Etterbeek&#x27;s oldest building.

Under the French regime, Etterbeek was made into a commune, within the canton of Sint-Stevens-Woluwe. From then on, and especially after the Belgian Revolution of 1830 and the development of Brussels as a capital city, the population of Etterbeek grew quickly. In 1876, there were more than 10,000 inhabitants, in 1900 more than 20,000, and in 1910 more than 33,000. In the 1900s (decade), during the reign of King Leopold II, construction boomed and changed the town&#x27;s character with the addition of the broad avenues and residential areas that exist today.

==Main sights==
Etterbeek has a rich cultural and architectural heritage. Some of the main points of interest include:
* The Church of St. Anthony of Padua, a Catholic church, designed in neo-Gothic style and built between 1905 and 1935, which has been listed as a protected monument since 2004.
* The Church of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, located on the /, a neo-Romanesque building completed in 1954.
* A third church—the Church of St. Gertrude—was demolished in 1993, as it was in danger of collapsing.
* The Cauchie House, a town house built in 1905 by the Art Nouveau architect, painter, and designer Paul Cauchie. Its facade is remarkable for its allegorical sgraffiti.
* Of a completely different character, the Barony House dates from 1680 and is the oldest building in the municipality.
* The &quot;Fondation René Carcan&quot;, a foundation and museum in the engraver and sculptor René Carcan&#x27;s old studio, was located in Etterbeek.
* The / has, since 27 September 2014, featured a series of large scale &quot;Le Chat&quot; drawings by the cartoonist Philippe Geluck, who was born and raised in this neighbourhood. The 24 drawings extend over a total length of .
* Etterbeek has a few green areas, including Jean-Félix Hap Garden. The better known Parc du Cinquantenaire/Jubelpark lies on the territory of both the City of Brussels and Etterbeek, and Leopold Park borders the municipality&#x27;s territory.

The main university campus of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) is called &quot;Campus Etterbeek&quot;, although it is geographically not within Etterbeek but in the adjacent Ixelles.

==Demographics==
Etterbeek has a large immigrant population, with both the EU and non-European migrant communities outnumbering the native Belgians. Akin to neighbouring Ixelles and Schaerbeek, Etterbeek also has a large Muslim population, mainly of North African origin.

==Transport==
Etterbeek is served by Etterbeek railway station but, like the neighbouring campus of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), it is also located in Ixelles. Etterbeek currently has one railway station (Merode) and three metro stations (Merode, Thieffry and Pétillon).

==Sports==
* Etterbeek hosts two football clubs (R.R.C. Etterbeek and Armenia) playing in Belgian Provincial leagues at the Guy Thys Stadium, thus named after the famous Belgian manager since 2003. He led the Belgium national football team to fourth place at the 1986 FIFA World Cup.
* In the summer of 1996, the municipal swimming pool burnt down. It has now been rebuilt and is again open to the public.

==Proposed redevelopment &quot;Les Jardins de la Chasse&quot;==

A project is currently proposed to redevelop an area of Etterbeek near the /. This project would result in the Municipal Hall and police station being relocated to new buildings in a central administrative centre on this site. The new site is being called the &quot;Jardins de la Chasse&quot; in French or &quot;Tuinen van de Jacht&quot; in Dutch. Demolition of the former CPAS building on the site started in 2014, and building of houses on the site started in 2016, with construction of the new Municipal Hall awaiting administrative approval. Municipal offices are forecast to move to the new location in summer 2018. The site of the current Municipal Hall may in the future be used for further residential development.

==Events==

Etterbeek hosts an annual medieval market. Previously held at the end of May on the / in the south of the municipality, in recent years, it has taken place at the Cinquantenaire.

<text>Evere (; ) is one of the 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region (Belgium). , the municipality had a population of 43,608 inhabitants. The total area is , which gives a population density of . In common with all of Brussels&#x27; municipalities, it is legally bilingual (French–Dutch).

==History==
Evere&#x27;s character was essentially rural until the end of the First World War. It was famous for its market gardeners, pioneers in the cultivation of chicory (, ). It was also the centre of the history of aviation in Belgium between 1914 and 1945 welcoming, among others, on the neighbouring town of Haren, the &quot;Société Anonyme Belge de Constructions Aéronautiques&quot; (SABCA) and &quot;Societé Anonyme Belge d&#x27;Exploitation de la Navigation Aérienne&quot; (SABENA). Charles Lindbergh flew the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; to Evere airfield after his historic 1927 transatlantic flight to Paris. He was welcomed by a crowd of over 25,000.

After the Second World War, the explosion of population and the scarcity of free building plots in the Brussels region accelerated the disappearance of agricultural land in Evere in favor of urbanisation. From 1968 onwards, the arrival of the NATO headquarters on the disused site of the old aerodrome in Haren, also brought about the arrival of a number of companies of the tertiary sector.

==Main sights==
* Brussels Cemetery is partly in Evere and partly in the municipality of Zaventem in Flemish Brabant.
* In September 2008, a former windmill in Evere, originally built in 1841, was opened as the &#x27;Brussels Mill and Food Museum&#x27; (&quot;Musée bruxellois du Moulin et de l&#x27;Alimentation&quot;).
* The NATO headquarters are located near Evere in Haren (part of the City of Brussels). Besides, several major international companies have set up their headquarters near Evere, notably KPMG in Haren, Deloitte in Zaventem (previously in Diegem), and Ernst &amp; Young in Diegem.

==Sport==
Evere is home to BUC Saint Josse Rugby Club, former Belgian Champions who currently play in the Belgian Elite League

==Transportation==
Evere is served by Evere railway station on line 26 (which goes from Halle to Vilvoorde). Bordet railway station, on the same line, is also in the municipality.

<text>Jette (; ) is one of the 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region, Belgium. Located in the north-western part of the region, it is bordered by the City of Brussels, Ganshoren, Koekelberg, and Molenbeek-Saint-Jean, as well as the Flemish municipalities of Asse and Wemmel. In common with all of Brussels&#x27; municipalities, it is legally bilingual (French–Dutch).

, the municipality had a population of 54,107 inhabitants. The total area is , which gives a population density of .

==History==

===Origins to Middle Ages===
Neolithic tools and remains of a Gallo-Roman villa have been found on the territory of Jette, proving the old age of the first settlements in this area. The fact that its first church was dedicated to Saint Peter also indicates early Christianisation. During the Middle Ages, parts of the territory were feudal dependencies of the Duchy of Brabant. Under the duke&#x27;s protection, Dieleghem Abbey was founded in 1095 by the Bishop of Cambrai and administered by Augustinian canons. In 1140, the Abbey&#x27;s monks switched to the rules of the Premonstratensian order. In the 13th century, the Abbey possessed half of the municipality&#x27;s territory and played an important social and economic role until the French Revolution.

===17th to 20th century===
During the Ancien Régime, Jette was part of the town of Merchtem, located in modern-day Flemish Brabant. In the 17th century, during the period of the Spanish Netherlands, the Finance Minister under Archdukes Albert and Isabella acquired and refurbished the old 12th-century Rivieren Castle in the village of Ganshoren, near Jette. In 1654, the minister&#x27;s son made this estate into a barony, then five years later, into a county, which included Jette and several neighbouring villages.

In the 1790s, the regime that was put in power by the French Revolution curtailed the religious freedoms drastically. The monks were expelled from the Abbey in 1796, and most of the buildings demolished the following year. Only the abbot&#x27;s house was kept as a leisure house. In 1841, Ganshoren split from Jette. During the following decades, what remained of Jette gradually lost its rural character to become a suburb of Brussels. Its population, which was of around 10,000 in 1900 grew to more than 40,000 in 1971.

==Main sights==
Jette has a rich cultural and architectural heritage. Some of the main points of interest include:
* The Municipal Hall of Jette, by the architect Jules Van Ysendyck, dates from the beginning of the 20th century.
* The abbot&#x27;s mansion, the only extant building of Dieleghem Abbey, has been converted into a mostly historical museum.
* Jette has kept a few of its old pubs and breweries, as well as a blacksmith&#x27;s workshop that still operated until 1960.
* The René Magritte Museum was set up in the house where the famous painter lived and worked for twenty-four years.
* The Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), the Dutch-speaking university of Brussels has built its hospital and medical campus in Jette, while its other buildings are in the so-called Etterbeek campus actually located in Ixelles.
* Jette railway station, which opened in 1892, and is located on the /, south of King Baudouin Park.

<doc id="152348" wikidata="Q180775" url="?curid=152348" title="Molenbeek-Saint-Jean">
<text>&#x27; (French, ) or &#x27; (Dutch, ), often simply called Molenbeek, is one of the 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region, Belgium. Located in the western part of the region, it is bordered by the City of Brussels, from which it is separated by the Brussels–Charleroi Canal, as well as by the municipalities of Anderlecht, Berchem-Sainte-Agathe, Dilbeek, Jette, and Koekelberg. The Molenbeek brook, from which it takes its name, flows through the municipality. In common with all of Brussels&#x27; municipalities, it is legally bilingual (French–Dutch).

From its origins in the Middle Ages until the 18th century, Molenbeek was a rural village on the edge of Brussels, but around the turn of the 19th century, it experienced major growth brought on by a boom in commerce and manufacturing during the Industrial Revolution. Its prosperity declined after the Second World War, owing to deindustrialisation, leading to extensive investment and regeneration. Experiencing a strong movement of immigration, mainly Moroccan, from the 1950s and 1960s, Molenbeek became increasingly multicultural with a minority Muslim population. In the 2010s, it gained international attention as the base for Islamist terrorists who carried out attacks in both Paris and Brussels.

Molenbeek is a mostly residential municipality consisting of several historically and architecturally distinct districts. , the municipality had a population of 98,365 inhabitants. The total area is , which gives a population density of , twice the average of Brussels. Its upper area is greener and less densely populated.

==Toponymy==

===Etymology===
The name &quot;Molenbeek&quot; derives from two Dutch words: &#x27;, meaning &quot;mill&quot;, and &#x27;, meaning &quot;brook&quot;; and could be literally translated as &quot;Millbrook&quot; in English. It is a very common name for brooks in the Netherlands and Belgium, such as the Molenbeek (Erpe-Mere Bovenschelde), as well as the Molenbeek-Ter Erpenbeek, both in the Denderstreek, Belgium.

Although first applied to the brook that flowed through the village, the name &quot;Molenbeek&quot; (originally spelled &quot;Molembecca&quot;) eventually came to be used to designate the village itself, around the year 985. The suffix in French or in Dutch, meaning &quot;Saint John&quot;, refers to the parish&#x27;s patron saint, Saint John the Baptist, though it is seldom used in everyday speech, today&#x27;s inhabitants—whether French or Dutch speaking—usually shortening the name to simply &quot;Molenbeek&quot;.

===Pronunciation===
In French, is pronounced , and in Dutch, is pronounced (in both languages, the &quot;-beek&quot; is pronounced like &quot;bake&quot; in English). Inhabitants of Molenbeek are known in French as (pronounced ) and in Dutch as (pronounced ). In France, the pronunciations (&quot;-beek&quot; like &quot;beck&quot; in English) and (for ) are often heard, but are rather rare in Belgium. The dialectal forms &quot;Muilebeik&quot; and &quot;Meulebeik&quot; are still used by older adults of Belgian ancestry, whilst the abbreviations &quot;Molen&quot; and &quot;Molem&quot; are common among younger speakers.

==History==

===Rural beginnings===
As early as the 9th century, Molenbeek was the site of a church dedicated to Saint John the Baptist. The parish boundaries of St. John&#x27;s Church were much greater than today, reaching as far as the river Senne, and from the end of the 12th century, included a chapel dedicated to Saint Catherine. This chapel was split off from the rest of the parish following the construction of Brussels&#x27; second city walls and gradually became the current St. Catherine&#x27;s Church in the / neighbourhood of Brussels. The first documented mention of Molenbeek was made on 9 April 1174 in a papal bull by Pope Alexander III listing the property of the chapter of the Collegiate Church of St. Michael and St. Gudula (now a cathedral) in Brussels, which included St. John&#x27;s Church, as well as other property. The Brussels Beguinage, founded before 1247 outside the city walls, also depended on Molenbeek.

In the early Middle Ages, Molenbeek was known for its miraculous spring of Saint Gertrude of Nivelles, the mythical founder of Nivelles Abbey, which attracted thousands of pilgrims. According to legend, she visited Molenbeek and offered the land on which the village&#x27;s first church was built, and allegedly caused this sacred spring to spur out by ramming her abbess&#x27;s crosier into the ground near the church. Later, the tradition of a special pilgrimage for patients with epilepsy developed around St. John&#x27;s Church. On St. John&#x27;s Day (24 June), a dancing procession took place, in which epileptics could be freed from their illness for a year if they crossed a bridge over the Molenbeek brook towards the church without their feet touching the ground. A painting by Pieter Brueghel the Younger, dating from 1592, illustrates this procession.

Molenbeek was made part of Brussels in the 13th century. As a result, the agricultural village lost a lot of its land to its more powerful neighbour. In addition, St. John&#x27;s Church was dismantled in 1578 during the Calvinist Republic of Brussels, which lasted from 1577 to 1585, leading to further decline, though it was later rebuilt on the same spot. The town&#x27;s aspect remained mostly rural until the 18th century.

===Industrialisation===
At the end of the 18th century, the Industrial Revolution brought prosperity back to Molenbeek through commerce and manufacturing. In 1795, under the French regime, the town regained its status as an independent municipality. Around that time, Molenbeek experienced its first wave of urbanisation with the development of a neighbourhood, known as the &quot;Faubourg Saint-Martin&quot;, around a number of streets to the immediate west of the City of Brussels, as well as another, the &quot;Faubourg de Flandre&quot;, a little more to the north.

During the first quarter of the 19th century, several hundred workers were employed in Molenbeek&#x27;s chemical and textile industries. In total, there were fifty companies in Molenbeek in 1829. The opening of the Brussels–Charleroi Canal in 1832 greatly increased the traffic of coal and thus the mechanisation of industry, which led to the development of foundries, engineering and metalworking companies in the municipality. Attracted by the industrial opportunities, many workers moved in, first from the other Belgian provinces (mainly rural residents from Flanders) and France, then from Southern European, and more recently from Eastern European and African countries.

The growth of the community continued unabated throughout the 19th century, leading to cramped living conditions, especially near the canal. In that period, Molenbeek was dubbed the &quot;Little Manchester&quot; (, ) or the &quot;Belgian Manchester&quot; (, ), in reference to the Northern English city that led the history of industrialisation. On 5 May 1835, Molenbeek was the departure site of the first passenger train in continental Europe. At the end of the 19th century, part of the industry, namely the port area, was lost by Molenbeek when Brussels annexed and reintegrated the canal area within its new port.

===20th century===
Until the early 20th century, Molenbeek was a booming suburb which attracted a large working-class population. Remarkable new urban developments and garden cities such as the Cité Diongre were built at the beginning of the century to house the influx of newcomers. The Church of St. John the Baptist was also rebuilt between 1930 and 1932 in Art Deco style to accommodate this growing populace. The industrial decline, however, which had already started before World War I, accelerated after the Great Depression and World War II.

Following the industrial decline after the war, the old districts bordering the City of Brussels began to decrease in population. Much of the original Belgian working-class population, when its financial means allowed it, left the lower Molenbeek for Brussels&#x27; newly developing suburbs. In this lower part of the town, new immigrant populations moved in, leading to the present-day urban fabric. The depopulation was not addressed until the 1960s through the construction of new residential areas in the then-rural west of the municipality. In the 1990s, this expansion was halted, leaving some woods and meadows in Molenbeek, such as the semi-natural site of the Scheutbos.

Where Molenbeek was once a centre of intense industrial activity, concentrated around the canal and the railway, most of those industries have disappeared to make way for large-scale urban renewal following the modernist Athens Charter, such as the Tour L&#x27;Écluse along the / in the upper town and the Tour Brunfaut near the canal. In addition, clearance work for the extension of the metro in the 1970s and 1980s led to further destruction. In spite of this, Molenbeek has maintained its character to this day. This industrial past is still remembered in Brussels&#x27; Museum of Industry and Labour, a museum of social and industrial history built on the site of the former foundry of the &quot;Compagnie des Bronzes de Bruxelles&quot;.

===21st century===
In some areas of Molenbeek, the ensuing poverty left its mark on the urban landscape and scarred the social life of the community, leading to rising crime rates and pervading cultural intolerance. Various local revitalisation programmes are currently under way, aiming at relieving the municipality&#x27;s most impoverished districts. Currently, the local economy is renewing itself, but it is &quot;dominated&quot; by the administrative sector. Alongside large companies such as KBC Bank and the distribution company Delhaize, there are administrations such as that of the Ministry of the French Community and numerous businesses.

Attempts at revitalising the municipality have, however, not always been successful. In June 2011, the multinational company BBDO, citing over 150 attacks on their staff by locals, posted an open letter to then-mayor Philippe Moureaux, announcing its withdrawal from the municipality. As a result, serious questions were raised about governance, security and the administration of Moureaux. Following a general decrease in crime, the company finally decided to remain in Molenbeek.

====Terrorism====
According to &quot;Le Monde&quot;, the assassins who killed anti-Taliban commander Ahmed Shah Massoud both came from Molenbeek. Hassan el-Haski, one of the 2004 Madrid terror bombers, came from Molenbeek. The perpetrator of the Jewish Museum of Belgium shooting, Mehdi Nemmouche, lived in Molenbeek for a time. Ayoub El Khazzani, the perpetrator of the 2015 Thalys train attack, stayed with his sister in Molenbeek. French police believe the weapons used in the Porte de Vincennes siege two days after the &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; shooting were sourced from Molenbeek. The bombers of the November 2015 Paris attacks were also traced to Molenbeek; during the Molenbeek capture of Salah Abdeslam, an accomplice of the Paris bombers, protesters &quot;threw stones and bottles at police and press during the arrest&quot;, stated the then-Interior Minister of Belgium, Jan Jambon. Oussama Zariouh, the bomber of Brussels Central Station in June 2017, lived in Molenbeek.

=====November 2015 Paris attacks=====
At least four of the terrorists in the November 2015 Paris attacks—the brothers Brahim and Salah Abdeslam, alleged accomplice Mohamed Abrini, and the alleged mastermind Abdelhamid Abaaoud—grew up and lived in Molenbeek. According to former French President François Hollande, that was also where they organised the attacks. On 18 March 2016, Salah Abdeslam, a suspected accomplice in those attacks, was captured in two anti-terrorist raids in Molenbeek that killed another suspect and injured two others. At least one other suspect remains at large. Ibrahim (born 9 October 1986 in Brussels) was involved in the attempted robbery of a currency exchange office in January 2010, where he shot at police with a Kalashnikov rifle. The then-mayor of Brussels, Freddy Thielemans, and the then-mayor of Molenbeek, Philippe Moureaux, described the shooting as a &quot;&quot; (a small daily news item) and &quot;normal in a large city&quot;, causing controversy.

=====Police investigation=====
Since several of the attackers in the Brussels and Paris terrorist attacks had connections to the area, Belgian police started door-to-door checks in which a quarter of Molenbeek&#x27;s inhabitants were investigated, a total of 22,668. This operation resulted in that of the 1,600 organisations investigated, 102 were found to be involved with crime and a further 52 were involved with terrorism. 72 individuals were found to have a terrorist connection and were subject to future surveillance.

==Geography==

===Location===
Molenbeek is located in the north-central part of Belgium, about from the Belgian coast and about from Belgium&#x27;s southern tip. It is located in the heartland of the Brabantian Plateau, about south of Antwerp (Flanders), and north of Charleroi (Wallonia). It is the third westernmost municipality in the Brussels-Capital Region after Anderlecht and Berchem-Sainte-Agathe and is an important crossing point for the Brussels–Charleroi Canal, which borders the municipality to the east. With an area of , it is also a relatively small municipality in the region, ranking eleventh out of nineteen. It is bordered by the Brussels municipalities of Anderlecht, Berchem-Sainte-Agathe, Jette and Koekelberg, as well as the Flemish municipality of Dilbeek.

===Climate===
Molenbeek, in common with the rest of Brussels, experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) with warm summers and cool winters. Proximity to coastal areas influences the area&#x27;s climate by sending marine air masses from the Atlantic Ocean. Nearby wetlands also ensure a maritime temperate climate. On average (based on measurements in the period 1981–2010), there are approximately 135 days of rain per year in the region. Snowfall is infrequent, averaging 24 days per year. It also often experiences violent thunderstorms in summer months.

The Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium (IRM/KMI) is located in Uccle, in the south of Brussels. The meteorological records which are carried out there are similar to those which could be carried out in Molenbeek.

==Districts==
There are two distinct areas in Molenbeek: a lower area and an upper area. The lower area, next to the canal, consists of working-class, predominantly migrant, communities, mostly of Moroccan (mainly Riffian and Berber) descent, with many being second- and third-generation. The upper area, close to the Greater Ring (Brussels&#x27; second ring road), features newer construction and is mostly middle-class and residential.

The territory of Molenbeek is very heterogeneous and is characterised by a mixture of larger districts including smaller residential and (formerly) industrial neighbourhoods. The area along the canal is currently experiencing a large revitalisation programme, as part of the of the Brussels-Capital Region.

===Lower Molenbeek===

====Historical centre====
The historical centre of Molenbeek is the municipality&#x27;s central district. It developed during the Industrial Revolution along the Brussels–Charleroi Canal and is currently in a fragile social and economic situation due to the decline of its economy and the poor quality of some of its housing. The Municipal Hall of Molenbeek is located on the / (&quot;Municipal Square&quot;), at the heart of this district.

====Duchesse (Quatre-vents)====
Located to the south of the historical centre of Molenbeek, this district is centred on the /. The square was created in 1847 on the grounds of the &quot;Hospices de Bruxelles&quot;, of which only the neoclassical facade remains. The hospice buildings now house a primary school (municipal school no. 5). In 1869, the Church of St. Barbara was erected there for the Catholic worship of the new parish. The /, the /, the /, the / and the / also end there.

====Heyvaert====
Located in the south-east of Molenbeek, near the Abattoirs of Anderlecht (the main slaughterhouse in Brussels) and along the Charleroi Canal, Heyvaert is part of the larger Cureghem/Kuregem district and is bounded by the /, the Rue de Birmingham, the Place de la Duchesse de Brabant, the Rue Isidoor Teirlinck, the /, and the / (formerly the /, because of its proximity to the canal lock; meaning &quot;lock&quot; in French).

====Maritime====
Located in the north of Molenbeek, the Maritime district was born, around 1900, from the implementation of the Port of Brussels and the Maritime Station (, ), a freight station on the Tour &amp; Taxis site. A number of customs agencies and handling activities mingled with homes have given the neighbourhood a diverse character. The residents, historically made up of workers, as well as of the small and large bourgeoisie, were also from the outset of great diversity.

===Upper Molenbeek===

====Karreveld====
Located in the north of the upper part of Molenbeek, Karreveld Park and its surrounding district are named after the former domain of Karreveld Castle, which now covers . Today, it is a mostly residential neighbourhood between the /, the / and the railroad.

====Korenbeek====
Located in the north-east of Molenbeek, Korenbeek is home to Molenbeek Cemetery between the Chaussée de Gand and the /. This cemetery was inaugurated on 16 August 1864 to replace the old parish cemetery around the Church of St. John the Baptist, which had become too small, and whose last remains were cleared in 1932.

====Machtens (Marie-José)====
Located in the upper part of Molenbeek, this district is located in the valley of the Maalbeek (or Molenbeek) that gave the municipality its name. Originally, the area was part of the former Oostendaal estate. In 1920, it was purchased by the municipality and partly turned into two parks, Albert Park and Marie-José Park, in the triangle formed by the /, the / and the /. They were designed by the architect and urban planner Louis Van der Swaelmen, and are named after King Albert I and his daughter, Princess Marie-José, the last Queen of Italy.

====Osseghem/Ossegem====
/ is centrally located in the upper part of Molenbeek, west of the municipality&#x27;s historical centre. The neighbourhood used to be a rural hamlet. The name is of Germanic (Frankish) origin and is composed of &quot;Odso&quot; + &quot;-inga&quot; + &quot;heim&quot;, meaning &quot;residence/domain of the family of Odso&quot;. An old country road, today&#x27;s /, which led to the Chaussée de Gand near the current Osseghem/Ossegem metro station, connected the hamlet to Molenbeek and Brussels.

====Scheutbos (Mettewie)====
Located in the extreme west of Molenbeek, near the Boulevard Louis Mettewie, the Scheutbos (or Scheutbosch) is the municipality&#x27;s remaining &quot;green&quot; area, home to the likewise named semi-natural site of the Scheutbos.

==Main sights==
Molenbeek-Saint-Jean has a rich cultural and architectural heritage. Some of the main points of interest include:
* The Municipal Hall of Molenbeek, located on the /, designed in eclectic style by the architect Jean-Baptiste Janssens, which was opened in 1889.
* The Church of St. John the Baptist, a Catholic parish church designed in Art Deco style by the architect and built in 1931–32, which has been listed as a protected monument since 1984.
* The Church of St. Remigius, located on the /, a neo-Gothic building completed in 1907.
* The Church of St. Barbara, located on the /, another neo-Gothic building completed in 1894 and listed since 1998.
* Molenbeek Cemetery, which contains remarkable monuments, including funerary galleries and a columbarium built in 1880.
* Karreveld Castle and its surrounding park, which are used for cultural events and meetings of the municipal council. At the beginning of the 20th century, it was one of the birthplaces of Belgian Cinema. At the request of Charles Pathé (Pathé Cinéma), the director Alfred Machin commissioned the first film studio in the country, together with a workshop for the construction of film sets and a mini zoological garden for exotic animals, such as bears, camels and panthers used as &#x27;extras&#x27; in films. Several films, including the first two Belgian feature films &quot;La Fille de Delft&quot; and the sadly prophetic &quot;Maudite soit la guerre&quot; (in hand-painted colours) were shot by Alfred Machin in the studio of Karreveld Castle. Since 1999, the castle hosts from mid-July to September the , a theatre festival open to other performing arts (i.e. magic, music, circus, etc.).
* The Municipal Museum of Molenbeek (MoMuse), housed in the prestigious building of the Academy of Drawing and Visual Arts.
* The &quot;Vaartkapoen&quot; statue, on the /.

Moreover, several rundown industrial buildings have been renovated and converted into prime real estate and other community functions. Examples include:
* The &quot;Fonderie&quot;, a former smelter of the &quot;Compagnie des Bronzes de Bruxelles&quot;, operational from 1854 to 1979, now home to Brussels&#x27; Museum of Industry and Labour. The museum focuses on the industry, coupled with the social history of Molenbeek, and the impact of industrialisation on the development of the municipality.
* The &quot;Raffinerie&quot;, a former sugar refinery, now the site of a cultural and modern dance complex.
* The &quot;Bottelarij&quot;, a bottling plant that housed the Royal Flemish Theatre during its renovation in the centre of Brussels.
* The Millennium Iconoclast Museum of Art (MIMA), a museum dedicated to culture 2.0 and to urban art opened in April 2016, in the former buildings of the Belle-Vue brewery, and is the first of the kind in Europe.
* The impressive buildings of the former goods station of Tour &amp; Taxis and the surrounding area bordering the municipality, which are being turned into residences, as well as commercial enterprises.
* Brussels&#x27; Circus School, installed in the buildings of Tour &amp; Taxis.

==Demographics==

===Historical population===
Historically, the population of Molenbeek was quite low. The municipality counted 690 inhabitants in 1707 and fewer than 2,000 inhabitants at the beginning of the 19th century. However, following the Industrial Revolution, the population underwent a remarkable growth, peaking at 72,783 in 1910. From then, it began to decrease slightly during the first half of the 20th century to a low of 63,528 in 1961, before increasing again rapidly in recent years.

, the population was 98,365. The area is , making the density . The population is relatively young—the average age is 35 years—with nearly 29% under 18 years old, and fewer than 12% over 65. This population, while already impoverished and overcrowded, further increased by 24.5% between 2005 and 2015.
* 

===Foreign population===
The population has been described as &quot;mainly Muslim&quot; in the media; however, actual figures are estimated to range between 25% and 40%, depending on the catchment area. Belgium does not collect statistics by religious beliefs, so exact figures are unknown, but the Muslim minority in the community is visibly significant.

, there is one main minority group in Molenbeek, Belgian Moroccans (mainly Riffian and other Berbers). That year, Françoise Schepmans, then-mayor of Molenbeek, stated that the lack of diversity in the foreign population of Molenbeek and the fact they are all clustered in the same area is a problem. Nearly 40% of young people in Molenbeek are unemployed. The municipality lies in a semi-circle of neighbourhoods in Brussels often referred to as the &quot;poor croissant&quot;.

, taking into account the nationality of birth of the parents, 69.16% of Molenbeek&#x27;s population is of non-European origin (predominantly Moroccan and Syrian), 17.49% of European origin other than Belgian (mainly Romanian, Spanish, French, Italian, and Polish), while 13.31% is solely of native Belgian ancestry. Among all major migrant groups from outside the EU, a majority of the permanent residents have acquired Belgian nationality.

==Politics==
Molenbeek is governed by an elected municipal council and an executive college of the mayor and aldermen. The longtime mayor from 1992 to 2012 was Philippe Moureaux (PS). Following the Belgian local elections, 2012, an alternative majority was formed headed by then-mayor Françoise Schepmans (MR) and consisting of MR (15 seats), CDH-CD&amp;V (6 seats) and Ecolo-Groen (4 seats). The Socialist Party (16 seats) became the opposition next to the Workers&#x27; Party of Belgium (PTB), Democratic Federalist Independent (DéFI), the ISLAM party and the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), each having one seat.

The 2018 local elections saw PS return to the majority, with a coalition between the aforementioned and MR being agreed upon. The current mayor is .

<text>Saint-Josse-ten-Noode (French, ) or Sint-Joost-ten-Node (Dutch, ), often simply called Saint-Josse in French or Sint-Joost in Dutch, is one of the 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region, Belgium. Located in the north-eastern part of the region, it is bordered by the City of Brussels and Schaerbeek.

, the municipality had a total population of 26,965. The total area is , which gives a population density of . From a total of 581 municipalities in Belgium, Saint-Josse is both the smallest in area size and the most densely populated. In common with all of Brussels&#x27; municipalities, it is legally bilingual (French–Dutch).

==History==
Named after Saint Judoc, Saint-Josse was originally a farming village on the outskirts of Brussels. In the centuries before the dismantling of the ramparts encircling Brussels, Saint-Josse was also the place where noblemen built country estates, the most notable amongst them the Castle of the Dukes of Brabant built by Philip the Good in 1456. The area surrounding that castle was planted with wine groves, which explains the presence of the bushel of grapes in the municipality&#x27;s coat of arms.

After the demolition of the ramparts, Saint-Josse was one of the first areas outside Brussels to urbanise. The rich built houses around the new boulevards and higher parts of the municipality, while industries and workman&#x27;s cottages were built in the lower lying part close to the river Senne. In 1855, 58% of the land area of Saint-Joose was annexed by the municipality of the City of Brussels to make way for the /, the /, the / and the / of the newly created Leopold Quarter (now the European Quarter).

According to an inventory of architecture commissioned by the Brussels Region, Saint-Josse has on average the oldest buildings of all 19 Brussels municipalities.

==Demographics==
While foreigners were a majority in 1995, in 2007 most of the population had Belgian citizenship, which has resulted in a sharp increase of municipal councillors with a foreign background, benefitting from the open proportional electoral system: from none in 1988 to two (from Morocco) in 1994, a near majority of 13 (seven from Morocco, five from Turkey) out of 27 in 2000 (including three aldermen) and a majority of 20 out of 27 in 2007 (including six aldermen out of seven, the seventh is a member of the Flemish minority).

<text>Cleckheaton is a town in the metropolitan borough of Kirklees, West Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is situated south of Bradford, east of Brighouse, west of Batley and south-west of Leeds. It is at the centre of the Spen Valley and was the major town in the former borough of Spenborough.
Cleckheaton has a history as a mill town and forms part of the Heavy Woollen District.

==History==

===Early history===

The Spen Valley was once heavily wooded. Evidence of human habitation in Mesolithic and Neolithic times has been found in the area. Roman remains have been found in the valley and it is thought that roads from York to Chester, and from settlements in Halifax and Wakefield, passed through Cleckheaton.

Cleckheaton was in the ancient parish of Birstall. A chapel of ease, known as the White Chapel (later Whitechapel) was established.

===Textile working===
The area was very disorganised for a long time after the Norman Conquest and the richest townships at that time were still the richest 300 years later as the Poll Tax returns of 1379 show. They also demonstrate the lack of administration as only the richest four of the 227 families living in the Spen Valley were made to pay more than the 4d (approx. 2p) minimum tax. These tax returns also show the recent deviation from the traditional sources of wealth in the area (i.e. farming and allied trades). These were centred on textiles and included dyeing, weaving and fulling (common names in the area nowadays still recall these early trades: Lister- dyer, Webster- weaver, Walker- fuller).

After the Reformation, Kirklees Priory was largely destroyed, many families were driven from the area and new non-aristocratic lords of the manor who were sympathetic to Protestantism were introduced by Elizabeth I, as was a puritan clergyman who was installed at Birstall Church. By 1570, at the time of the Rising of the Northern Earls, the last of the old Norman noble families had been swept away. Sir John Neville went into exile and forfeited his estate and Thomas Hussey (heir to the de Tilly family of Oakwell Hall) was imprisoned in the Tower of London for some time before being pardoned.

By the 17th century land-owning farmers were finding it increasingly difficult as were their landlords and some payments were still in kind as farmers had no money to pay their debts. Meanwhile, the textile workers were becoming more and more prosperous and paid less and less attention to their hard up and increasingly impotent landlords. During the English Civil War the clothiers were on one side and the landlords on the other. Lords of the area were made Royalist officers and made some progress such as at the Battle of Adwalton Moor about a mile east of Birkenshaw and the siege of Bradford, before the Parliamentarians took control of the area.

===Nonconformity===

After the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Anglicanism was reintroduced. However, many people had found Puritan teachings more to their taste, and it took many years to re-install an Anglican vicar to Whitechapel. Despite the draconian nonconformist laws, there were many nonconformist meeting houses and nonconformity flourished; a fifth of the population of the Birstall Parish was estimated to be nonconformist. Quakers were widespread, and even now a number of 17th and 18th century Quaker burial grounds remain in the area. In the 18th century, Presbyterianism was widespread, but then it lost a large minority of its flock to Unitarianism and to the Baptist church. Methodism also flourished from the 1740s after visits from John Wesley and Charles Wesley, as did the Moravian Church. Indeed, John Wesley visited Birstall some 40 times.

In spite of the religious strength in the valley, the inhabitants were somewhat unconventional and still went to astrologers, quack doctors and prophets. Local religious leaders included people like Eli Collins, the &quot;Wizard of Wyke&quot;, and Alvery Newsome, the &quot;Wise Man of Heckmondwike&quot;.

===Industrial Revolution===

In 1804 the Reverend Hammond Roberson, annoyed that the administration of Liversedge was disorganised, promoted a system of reform (the select vestry) which quickly spread to Cleckheaton and Heckmondwike. In 1810, after his wife&#x27;s death, Roberson turned his attention to church building in the area. In 1818 Parliament voted £1 million for the building of new churches in the country, and Roberson was able to secure funding to build Cleckheaton Church: St John the Evangelist in Church Street.

===Spen Valley===
By the mid 19th century the Spen Valley entered its golden era. In 1800 children were paid starvation wages for putting staples into leather for carding wool, but by 1838 there were eleven carding factories in Cleckheaton and by 1893 the town was recognised as the carding capital of the world.

===20th century===
Around 1900, many large and expensive buildings were erected and became symbols of the area&#x27;s wealth; massive chapels and a new grammar school were built in Cleckheaton, and to mark the new urban district and the fact that it was the centre of it, Cleckheaton built a town hall in 1892, paid for in part by public subscription.

In 1903, Lion Confectionery began making &quot;Midget Gems&quot; in Cleckheaton, and 1904 saw the opening of the Phelon &amp; Moore (Panther) motorcycle factory in the town, soon followed by a car factory. BBA (formerly British Belting &amp; Asbestos), the large asbestos, friction material, and conveyor belting firm, built its headquarters at Moorend, where they manufactured automotive disc brake pads under the Mintex banner. A tourist industry developed to serve visitors to the area aware of its connection to Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s novel &quot;Shirley&quot; and Luddite attacks. The philanthropic Mowatt family paid for Cleckheaton Library.

====Cleckheaton railway station====

The railway station closed to passenger traffic in 1965 and to goods four years later. In 1972, a singular case was heard at Wakefield Crown Court. A Dewsbury man was accused of, as counsel for the prosecution put it, effectively stealing the station. British Rail had contracted for the clearing of the site; part of the deal was that the contractors would sell and retain the proceeds from disposal of the materials and scrap. On arrival, they discovered that the station and most of the material were already gone. It transpired that the defendant had been contracted by another firm to clear the site, had been advanced a sum for hire of plant, and had spent three weeks clearing the site. Subsequent efforts to trace the second firm failed, and the court found the man not guilty, deciding that he had been duped and left significantly out of pocket.

====Cleckheaton bus station====
Cleckheaton has a bus station in the town centre. It has six stands, and the main operator is Arriva Yorkshire. However, there is a regular service to Bradford Interchange with different operators and a school bus also operated here. It is owned and maintained by West Yorkshire Metro, who rebuilt it in April 2005, replacing the previous site owned by Arriva Yorkshire.

==Government==

===Local government===

Cleckheaton was formerly a township in the parish of Birstall, in 1866 Cleckheaton became a separate civil parish. Cleckheaton adopted the Local Government Act 1858 in 1864 and a local board was formed. The Local Government Act 1894 reconstituted the area of the local board as Cleckheaton Urban District. There were at this time attempts to involve all the local authorities in the valley in joint projects such as installation of sewers and water. In 1915, the three urban districts of Cleckheaton, Liversedge and Gomersal were amalgamated to form Spenborough Urban District. In 1937, a county review order enlarged the urban district to include Birkenshaw, Hunsworth and Hartshead. Spenborough (which included all the Spen Valley except for Heckmondwike) was granted a charter of incorporation and became a municipal borough on 23 May 1955. The borough used the coat of arms which bore the motto &quot;Industry Enriches&quot; which it had been granted in 1949. In 1951 the parish had a population of 13,440. On 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished.

On 1 April 1974, the Local Government Act 1972 reorganised administration throughout England and Wales. The borough of Spenborough was abolished, and its area combined with that of ten other local authorities to form the Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees, one of five metropolitan boroughs of West Yorkshire.
Cleckheaton is a ward of Kirklees and is unparished. The population of the ward at the 2011 Census was 16,622. It elects three of the borough council&#x27;s 69 councillors. In 2007 all three councillors were members of the Liberal Democrats. Under the borough council&#x27;s decentralisation scheme, Cleckheaton&#x27;s councillors and those from Heckmondwike and Liversedge and Gomersal form the Spen Valley Area Committee. In August 2014, it was announced that Cleckheaton councillor Kath Pinnock was to be elevated to the House of Lords as a life peer.

===Parliamentary representation===
In 1885, Cleckheaton and the three neighbouring townships, Gomersal, Heckmondwike and Liversedge, were grouped to form the Parliamentary county constituency of Spen Valley and remained in that constituency until 1950. The seat was held at various times by the Liberal, National Liberal and Labour parties. From 1950 to 1983, Cleckheaton was included in the borough constituency of Brighouse and Spenborough. It was a marginal seat, changing hands between the Conservative and Labour parties on six occasions. Cleckheaton is now in the Batley and Spen constituency, created in 1983. It was represented by a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) from 1983 to 1997, then by Labour MP Mike Wood until 2015, when Wood retired and was succeeded by Jo Cox (Labour). After Jo Cox was murdered in 2016, she was replaced in a by-election (which was uncontested by the other major parties) by Tracy Brabin, who retained the seat in 2017 and 2019. When she became Mayor of West Yorkshire in 2021, there was another by-election which was won by Kim Leadbeater, from the Labour Party.

Cleckheaton is at the centre of a number of villages in the Spen Valley: Oakenshaw, East Bierley, Hunsworth, Birkenshaw, Drub, Gomersal, Little Gomersal, Littletown, Millsbridge, Liversedge, Roberttown, Hartshead, Clifton, Hightown, Heckmondwike and Scholes. The town is made up of Moorend, Whitechapel, Whitcliffe, Moorbottom, Moorside, the Marsh and Rawfolds.

Cleckheaton is about four miles north-west of Dewsbury and six miles north-west of Huddersfield. A mile to the north is the M62 motorway accessed at Junction 32, Chain Bar. 

Cleckheaton was on a railway line that connected Bradford via Mirfield to Huddersfield. It closed in the 1960s but its trackbed between Low Moor, south of Bradford, and Ravensthorpe, between Dewsbury and Mirfield, is a cycleway known as the Spen Valley Greenway.

<doc id="152352" wikidata="Q242393" url="?curid=152352" title="Woluwe-Saint-Pierre">
<text>Woluwe-Saint-Pierre (French, ) or Sint-Pieters-Woluwe (Dutch, ) is one of the 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region, Belgium. Located in the eastern part of the region, it is bordered by Etterbeek, Auderghem and Woluwe-Saint-Lambert, as well as the Flemish municipalities of Kraainem and Tervuren. In common with all of Brussels&#x27; municipalities, it is legally bilingual (French–Dutch).

, the municipality had a population of 42,216 inhabitants. The total area is , which gives a population density of . It is mostly a well-to-do residential area, which includes the wide, park-lined, Avenue de Tervueren/Tervurenlaan, and the numerous embassies located near Marshal Montgomery Square. Of the three streams that once crossed the municipality, only the Woluwe, a tributary of the Senne, can still largely be seen today.

==History==

===Middle Ages to 17th century===
The first appearance of the name &quot;Wolewe&quot; dates from 1117 and can be found in a charter from Forest. At that time, the original hamlet and its farms were dependencies of the Park Abbey near Leuven. The onset of difficulties can be traced to the middle of the 16th century, with the hostilities waged by Philip II of Spain against the heretical Protestants and the ensuing poverty and famine took their toll on the entire population. Safety and prosperity returned under the reigns of Archdukes Albert VII and Isabella at the beginning of the 17th century. The first grand alley linking Tervuren to Brussels, then known as the &quot;Street of the Duke&quot;, dates from that period.

===18th century until today===
The French Revolution was also a troubled period for Woluwe-Saint-Pierre. The roads became insecure, the religious freedoms were drastically curtailed, much of the local wild life was exterminated for food, and the lack of coal and wood forced people to use peat for heating. The local administration gained its independence from Brussels, obtained its first mayor on 26 May and its first municipal council in 1819. The commercial opportunities that opened up to the new municipality marked the start of a new era of wealth. The municipality did not expand very quickly, however, until the last two decades of the 19th century. New roads, such as the Avenue de Tervueren/Tervurenlaan, a new train track, imposing mansions, such as the Stoclet Palace, and Woluwe Park, were all built or designed between 1880 and 1910. An important race track, now demolished, was built in 1906. The residential areas came into being right after the First World War and further urbanisation took place after the Second World War. Nowadays, agriculture and fisheries, common before 1918, have completely disappeared. The area now depends nearly exclusively on the service sector of the economy.

==Sights==
* The extensive Woluwe Park includes giant sequoias, cypresses, and a variety of birds such as mute swans, gulls, and grey herons.
* The imposing modern Municipal Hall is open to visitors.
* The municipality&#x27;s main church (Saint Peter) was erected in 1755 on the site of a much older building and perpendicular to it, with funds from Forest Abbey. Traces of the older building can still be seen on the left of the current church.
* Several turn-of-the-century houses and manors can still be seen today, such as the Stoclet Palace, which was built between 1905 and 1909 on a design by the Austrian architect Josef Hoffmann for the Belgian financier Adolphe Stoclet, and contains mosaics and paintings by Gustav Klimt.
* The Bibliotheca Wittockiana houses one of the most prestigious bookbinding collections in the world.
* The memorial on the / to the Belgian Volunteer Corps for Korea, the force sent by Belgium to aid South Korea during the Korean War (1950–1953).
* The Brussels Tram Museum displays a collection of trams and buses of different ages.

<text>Keighley ( ) is a market town and a civil parish
in the City of Bradford Borough of West Yorkshire, England. It is the second largest settlement in the borough, after Bradford.

Keighley is north-west of Bradford, north-west of Bingley, north of Halifax and south-east of Skipton. It is governed by Keighley Town Council and Bradford City Council. Keighley is located in West Yorkshire, close to the borders of North Yorkshire and Lancashire. Historically in the West Riding of Yorkshire, it lies between Airedale and Keighley Moors. At the 2011 census, Keighley had a population of 56,348.

== History ==
=== Toponymy ===
The name Keighley, which has gone through many changes of spelling throughout its history, means &quot;Cyhha&#x27;s farm or clearing&quot;, and was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086: &quot;In Cichhelai, Ulchel, and Thole, and Ravensuar, and William had six carucates to be taxed.&quot;

=== Town charter ===
Henry de Keighley, a Lancashire knight, was granted a charter to hold a market in Keighley on 17 October 1305 by King Edward I. The poll tax records of 1379 show that the population of Keighley, in the wapentake of Staincliffe in the West Riding of Yorkshire, was 109 people (47 couples and 15 single people).

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
From 1753, the Union stage coach departed on the Keighley and Kendal Turnpike from what was the Devonshire Arms coaching inn on the corner of Church Street and High Street. Rebuilt about 1789, this public house has a classical style pedimented doorcase with engaged Tuscan columns in the high fashion of that age. The original route towards Skipton was Spring Gardens Lane – Hollins Lane – Hollins Bank Lane. Keighley was to become an intersection with other turnpikes, including the Two-Laws to Keighley branch of the Toller Lane – Blue Bell turnpike (1755) from Bradford to Colne, the Bradford to Keighley turnpike (1814), and the Keighley—Halifax turnpike.

The 1842 Leeds Directory description of Keighley reads, &quot;Its parish had no dependent townships though it is about long and broad, and comprises of land (including a peaty moor of about ) and a population which amounted, in the year 1801, to 5,745.&quot;

==== Christopher Ingham ====
Utley Cemetery contains the grave of Christopher Ingham, a veteran of the conflict against Napoleon. He was a member of the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s elite 95th Rifle Regiment and fought in ten battles against the French in Spain, France and Belgium, including the Spanish Peninsula War and the Battle of Waterloo, for which he was awarded several medals, including the Peninsula Medal. He died in 1866. Some local historians believe Mr Ingham&#x27;s heroism may have inspired the author Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s saga about Major Richard Sharpe. The TV series episode &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Justice&quot;, which focuses on the roots of the title character, is set in and around Keighley.

=== Hindenburg parcel ===
On 22 May 1936, the Zeppelin Hindenburg crossed Yorkshire in a diversion of her normal route between the United States and Germany. As the airship passed over the town, a parcel was dropped and landed in the High Street, where two boys, Jack Gerrard and Alfred Butler, picked it up. The parcel contained a bunch of carnations, a small silver and jet crucifix, some postage stamps, a picture postcard and some Hindenburg notepaper.

The note was written by John P Schulte, who called himself the first flying priest. The note requested that the carnations and crucifix be placed on the grave of his brother, Lieutenant Franz Schulte, who had died of Spanish flu, during the deadly influenza pandemic of 1918, as a Prisoner of War at Raikeswood Prisoner of War Camp, Skipton, originally built as a training camp for the Bradford Pals, in 1915. Schulte was, at that time, buried at Morton Cemetery, east of Keighley (though the letter stated that he was buried at Skipton, which was incorrect).

The carnations were placed on the grave and the two boys kept the postage stamps and the postcard. The crucifix was placed in St Anne&#x27;s Church to avoid it being stolen.

== Governance ==
=== Constituency ===
Keighley is represented in the House of Commons by Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Robbie Moore, who won the seat by defeating his predecessor John Grogan at the 2019 general election. Grogan had a majority of just 249 over the previous incumbent, Conservative Kris Hopkins.

In 2015, Hopkins won the seat at the 2015 general election – securing a second term. Hopkins increased the Conservatives vote share in the area from 41.9% in 2010 to 44.3% in 2015. The Conservatives won the seat in 2010, taking over from Ann Cryer, who had been in office since 1997.

Keighley was contested by the British National Party (BNP) in the May 2005 general election, when the party&#x27;s leader Nick Griffin stood for Parliament. He was defeated by Ann Cryer, one of a small number of Labour MPs with an increased majority. In March 2006, the town&#x27;s mayoress, Rose Thompson, announced she had joined the BNP and was immediately dismissed by the mayor Tony Wright.

=== Parish ===

The town was incorporated as a municipal borough on 28 July 1882 under the provisions of the Municipal Corporations Act 1882 in the West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1938, the boundaries of the borough and civil parish of Keighley were expanded to include the former urban districts and civil parishes of Haworth, Oakworth and Oxenhope, along with the parish of Morton from the abolished Keighley Rural District and a small part of the Bingley urban district.

On 1 April 1974, Keighley borough became part of the City of Bradford Metropolitan District in accordance with the Local Government Act 1972 in the newly formed county of West Yorkshire. The merger caused a lot of bitterness among Keighley people, who resented being &#x27;taken over&#x27; by Bradford and accused the city&#x27;s council of neglecting the town. Civil parish status was restored to Keighley in 2002, providing it with its own town council.

The council&#x27;s 30 members elect a mayor from amongst their number once a year. The parish boundaries are based on but not identical to the pre-1938 borough boundaries. In June 2006, the leader of Bradford District Council, Conservative Councillor Kris Hopkins, was quoted in the &quot;Craven Herald &amp; Pioneer&quot; as suggesting it might be a good idea for Keighley to become an independent authority once again. The town has a local history society, Keighley and District Local History Society, and a family history society, Keighley and District Family History Society.

== Geography ==

Keighley lies at the confluence of the rivers Worth and Aire in Airedale, in the South Pennines. It benefits from an electrified railway service with connections to Leeds, Bradford, Shipley, Bingley, Skipton, Carlisle and Morecambe.

The post town of Keighley&#x27;s northern boundary is with Bradley and its southern limit is the edge of Oxenhope. To the west, the town advances up the hill to the suburb of Black Hill, and in the east it terminates at the residential neighbourhoods of Long Lee and Thwaites Brow. The outlying north-eastern suburb of Riddlesden is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a separate village but is part of the town.

Past Black Hill and via Braithwaite Edge Road lies Braithwaite village, which leads to Laycock, which was also mentioned in the Domesday Book. Laycock is a conservation area which overlooks the hamlet of Goose Eye.

The River Aire passes through north-eastern Keighley, dividing the neighbourhood of Stockbridge and running roughly parallel to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The Worth links up with the Aire in Stockbridge and runs south-westerly, dividing eastern Keighley from central and western districts of the town. The Worth is lined with abandoned, semi-derelict industrial sites and tracts of waste ground dating from the period when Keighley thrived as a major textile centre.

Parts of Keighley are prone to flooding, and the town was particularly badly hit by floods in 2000. Since then, millions have been spent on strengthening flood defences.

Other outlying villages around the town are Oakworth, Cross Roads, Haworth, Stanbury and Oxenhope. The two main settlements to the north are Silsden and Steeton. Although these villages are often referred to as separate places, they are part of the wider Keighley area. These areas add a total of 22,669 people to the Keighley area, taking the population of the wider Keighley area up to 74,098 (2001 Census).

To the north-east is Rombalds Moor, which contains many signs of Stone Age and Bronze Age occupation, including cup and ring marks; as it drops back down into Wharfedale and the town of Ilkley, approximately five miles away, it becomes the more famous Ilkley Moor.

== Demography ==

† The 1939 population is estimated from the National Registration Act figures. The 1941 census did not take place because of the Second World War.

== Economy ==

The town&#x27;s industries have typically been in textiles, particularly wool and cotton processing. In addition to the manufacture of textiles, there were several large factories making textile machinery. These included Dean, Smith &amp; Grace, George Hattersley &amp; Son, and Prince, Smith &amp; Stell. The first of these operated as a manufacturer of CNC machine tools, particularly precision lathes, until 2008.

Keighley is home to Timothy Taylor Brewery, the makers of CAMRA, Champion Beer of Britain award-winning ales Landlord and Boltmaker (previously known as &#x27;Best Bitter&#x27;). They also brew Ram Tam, Golden Best, Dark Mild, Knowle Spring and a new French style blonde ale, Le Champion, which was first brewed for the Tour de France in 2014 and has been brewed for the Tour de Yorkshire in 2015 and 2016. They also own many pubs in the area, including the Albert Hotel, Boltmakers Arms, Lord Rodney, Royal Oak and The Fleece Inn in Haworth.

== Community and culture ==

&quot;On-street trading took place in Keighley, around the Church Green area, for 500 years before the establishment of a formal market in 1833. The market was situated at the west end of Low Street. This area was redeveloped in the late 1960s and a purpose-built covered market hall was constructed...The new building was opened by Keighley town mayor Sydney Bancroft in June, 1971.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;keighleynews/17813952&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the town centre has been pedestrianised. Keighley has Keighley Market Hall, four large supermarkets, Morrisons, Sainsbury&#x27;s, Aldi and Asda. There are several budget supermarkets situated in small retail parks around the town.

The Airedale shopping centre is a large indoor shopping precinct which houses most of the town&#x27;s high street retail chains. The Airedale Shopping Centre housed the statue of the giant Rombald holding a boulder above his head. It was moved to a different part of the centre when a glass ceiling was added to the whole complex. A public consultation favoured placing the statue on the Beechcliffe roundabout on the A650 road approaching Keighley from the east. According to local legend, the giant Rombald threw a giant rock at his enemies (or in some versions of the tale his wife) killing them. The rock is the &quot;calf&quot; of &quot;cow and calf&quot; rock fame, which can be seen today at the top of Rombald&#x27;s Moor on Ilkley Moor.

Keighley has one cinema, The Picture House on North Street. It opened in 1913, making it one of the oldest in Britain. A brief closure in the mid-1990s prevented it from being listed as one of the oldest in continuous operation – a record that goes to the Curzon Cinema, which opened in Clevedon, Somerset, in 1911. It was restored from its derelict condition in 1996 by Northern Morris Associated Cinemas and operates to this day.

Keighley has a popular local music scene. There have been various venues where local bands play. Most notable was the now-defunct CJ&#x27;s bar (also known as Chrome, VW&#x27;s, Cheese and Trumpet) that played host to many popular touring bands. Examples of local bands are the Sailmakers, the Undecided, Foxes Faux, Random Hand, the Get Guns, Eyesore Angels and Dead Message, who recently parted ways after 9 years. The British rock bands Skeletal Family and Terrorvision were also originally formed in Keighley.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the local TV transmitter. Keighley&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Radio Leeds on 102.7 FM, Heart Yorkshire on 107.6 FM, Capital Yorkshire on 105.6 FM, Hits Radio West Yorkshire on 97.5 FM, Greatest Hits Radio West Yorkshire on 96.3 FM, and Rombalds Radio, a community based radio station that broadcast online. Local newspapers are the &quot;Keighley News&quot; and &quot;Telegraph &amp; Argus&quot;.

=== Town twinning ===

Keighley has the unique record of having the first recorded town twinning agreement in the world, having entered into an agreement with Poix-du-Nord, France in 1920. This actually followed an even earlier sister city arrangement with two communes on the outskirts of Paris, France – Suresnes and Puteaux – starting in 1905.

== Landmarks ==
=== Architecture ===
Like many other British towns and cities, Keighley was extensively remodelled in the 1960s and lost many historic buildings. However, the town managed to retain some of its heritage and has many Victorian buildings. The local millstone grit gives many of the buildings a distinctive look.

East Riddlesden Hall, Cliffe Castle Museum and Whinburn Mansion are fine country houses. There are large townhouses along Skipton Road, which contrast with the rows of smaller terraces in the streets behind them, although many of these larger buildings have since been converted into flats and bedsits.

The town&#x27;s central library was the first Carnegie library in England, opened in 1904 with a grant of £10,000 from Andrew Carnegie. The library has undergone refurbishment, which was completed in 2007. Many of the town&#x27;s former mill buildings are still intact.

The town centre contains modern buildings, such as Leeds City College, and examples of Victorian commercial architecture, including the long terrace of Cavendish Street with its ornamental canopy. There is a bus station which opened in 2002 near the Airedale Shopping Centre. There are several tower blocks in Parkwood Rise, Holycroft and Ingrow and a central multi-storey car park.

Amongst the modern houses in Laycock, outside Keighley town centre, is a 17th-century, three-storey manor house (which is said to be the former wing of a much bigger property), converted barns and 18th-century cottages.

=== Attractions ===
On the outskirts of town is Cliffe Hall, also known as Cliffe Castle, now Keighley Museum.
The Keighley and Worth Valley railway is a heritage steam railway, which links the town with Haworth, Oakworth, Oxenhope and the Bronte Country. Keighley is the location of the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway, a heritage railway that passes through Haworth (part of the Brontë Country, home of Anne, Charlotte and Emily Brontë) and terminates at Oxenhope. At Ingrow is the Museum of Rail Travel.

Top Withens and the Brontë Waterfall are within walking distance of Stanbury, a mile and a half from Haworth. East Riddlesden Hall is in Riddlesden. Keighley Police Museum is in the Keighley Civic Centre opposite the Town Square. The old police station has many pieces of police memorabilia, including a Victorian horse-drawn Black Mariah.

== Education ==
Local high schools are Carlton Keighley in Utley, Beckfoot Oakbank, Parkside School in Cullingworth and the Holy Family Catholic School.

Keighley College, formerly the local campus of Leeds City College, itself formerly known as Park Lane College, is situated near Keighley railway station on Bradford Road. In 2010, the college opened this new £30 million campus, moving away from the former site on Cavendish Street, which was in need of repair and has since been demolished. The college includes an Industrial Centre of Excellence and a nationally acclaimed Star Centre facility, designed to encourage more young people to study STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). This features a mock mission control centre, a planetarium, a simulated rocky planet surface and many other space-related items.

== Religion ==
Keighley has a parish church, Keighley Shared Church, and is home to many Christian denominations. It has churches and places of worship for Anglicans, Methodists, United Reformed, Mormons, Quakers, Salvation Army and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. Keighley has a significant Roman Catholic, minority re-established following the repeal of the penal laws. The Catholic population was boosted in the mid-19th century with the arrival of Irish immigrants escaping the 1840s Great Famine, who came to work in the textile and weaving industries. Keighley has two Roman Catholic churches (St Anne&#x27;s – 1840 and St Joseph&#x27;s – 1934) and four Roman Catholic schools (St Anne&#x27;s – 1857, St Joseph&#x27;s – 1922, Our Lady of Victories – 1960 and Holy Family – 1964).

The first spiritualist church in Britain was founded at Keighley in 1853 by David Richmond, who, although not originally from the town, stayed for many years and helped to establish the movement throughout the country. Spiritualism was at its height during Victorian times and Keighley Spiritualist church remains open.

Muslims make up the second-largest religious group in the town. According to the 2011 census, there were more than 12,400 Muslims in Keighley in March of that year. Most had started coming to Britain in the 1960s from the Mirpur region of Azad Kashmir, in Pakistan, and the Sylhet region of Bangladesh. As of 2013, there were eight mosques in Keighley, including the purpose-built Markazi Jamia Masjid (&#x27;Central Community Mosque&#x27;) in Emily Street and the purpose-built Jamia Masjid Ghosiyah (Ghosiyah Community Mosque – named after the saint Abdul Qadir Jilani), on Skipton Road. The rest are buildings which have been converted into Mosques, with the oldest being the Shahjalal Jami Masjid and Jamiah Quraniah (ShahJalal Community Mosque and Quran Teaching School – named after the saint Shah Jalal), on Temple Row, which was previously the Wesleyan Methodist Church, 1845–46.

There is a Buddhist centre on Lawkholme Crescent, in the town centre. The Keighley Kadampa Buddhist Centre is used by lay and ordained Buddhist practitioners and also runs day and evening classes for newcomers to the faith.

== Sport ==
Keighley Cougars are a semi-professional rugby league team based at Royd Ings Avenue. The ground&#x27;s historical name is Lawkholme Lane but has been known as Cougar Park since 1992.
Keighley RUFC rugby union team are based at Rose Cottage, Utley, and play in the amateur Yorkshire Second Division.

Keighley Central F.C., was a football club that won the Yorkshire Football League Division 3 title in 1964.

On 6 July 2014, Stage 2 of the 2014 Tour de France from York to Sheffield, passed through the town. It was also the location of the stage&#x27;s intermediate sprint after . The 20 points for the Points jersey was claimed by Blel Kadri of AG2R La Mondiale.

== Filmography ==

=== Film ===
Keighley was the setting for the film &quot;Blow Dry&quot;, starring Josh Hartnett, Alan Rickman and Bill Nighy. &quot;Blow Dry&quot; opens with the announcement that the small town of Keighley will host the year 2000 British Hair Championships. Keighley&#x27;s mayor (Warren Clarke) is thrilled about the news, but when he announces it to the town&#x27;s press, they all yawn disapprovingly. The film, although set in Keighley, was shot in several locations.

Most of the 2004 film &quot;Yasmin&quot; was shot in Keighley. Written by Simon Beaufoy and mostly filmed in Lawkholme, it tells the story of a British Muslim woman who has her life disrupted by the impact of the September 11 attacks on America. Beaufoy said the film was originally set in Oldham, but &quot;worked its way across the Pennines&quot;.

The Keighley and Worth Valley Railway (KWVR), running steam trains from Keighley to Haworth and Oxenhope, has been used in several films, including &quot;The Railway Children&quot;, &quot;Yanks&quot;, the film of the Pink Floyd musical &quot;The Wall&quot; and an episode of the long-running situation comedy, &quot;The Last of the Summer Wine&quot;. &quot;A Touch of Frost&quot;, starring David Jason, was also filmed at the railway line close to Ingrow West.

The 1950s set British feature film &quot;Between Two Women&quot; (2000) was filmed extensively in and around Keighley and its mills, in particular around the railway and close to the main town railway station. The same director&#x27;s next film, &quot;The Jealous God&quot;, (2005) also featured Keighley railway station and nearby streets.

The film God&#x27;s Own Country about the young life of a sheep farmer was filmed in Laycock and also at Keighley bus station

=== Television ===
The 2004 documentary &quot;Edge of the City&quot;, about the City of Bradford Social Services, and the people and problems they deal with, was partly filmed in Keighley, and concerned sexual abuse of underage white girls by some Asian men.

A great part of the 2004 BBC television drama &quot;North and South&quot; was shot on Keighley, with Dalton Mills being one of the serial&#x27;s main locations.

The Keighley and Worth Valley Railway depot was featured in an episode of &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; which aired in 2023.

<text>Kirkburton is a village, civil parish and ward in Kirklees in West Yorkshire, England. It is south-east of Huddersfield. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, the township comprised the villages of Kirkburton and Highburton and several hamlets, including Thunder Bridge, Thorncliffe, Storthes Hall and Linfit. According to the 2011 census the civil parish had a population of 26,439, while the village had a population of 4,299.

==History==

The area was populated in the Iron Age when a settlement was believed to have been built on the site of the church. A Saxon fort is also believed to have stood on that site. The village is recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as Bertone in Wachefeld. The entry reads (translated):

&quot;In Wakefield, with 9 Berewicks... are 60 carucates of land 3 bovates and the third part of 1 bovate to the geld. 30 ploughs could plough this land. This manor was in the demesne of King Edward; now, in the king&#x27;s hand, there are 4 villans, and 3 priests and 2 churches, and 7 sokemen and 16 bordars. Together, they have 7 ploughs. [There is] woodland pasture 6 leagues long and 4 leagues broad. The whole [is] 6 leagues long and 6 leagues broad... To this manor belongs the soke of these lands... Kirkburton, 3 carucates... in all, there are 30 carucates to the geld, which 20 ploughs could plough. Now they are waste&quot;
After the Norman Conquest the village grew from the waste recorded in 1086. Kirkburton was named after the church was built in 1190 and Highburton was built on the hill. In the Middle Ages the township was part of the Manor of Wakefield and Kirkburton church was at the head of a parish, that extended to the Holme Valley.

During the First English Civil War the villagers supported the Parliamentary cause. The priest, Gamaliel Whitaker, angered his parishioners by supporting the Royalists. He was denounced to the government forces who went to arrest him in 1644. During the struggle the soldiers shot his wife, Hester, in the ensuing confusion. Legend has it that her ghost haunts the old vicarage.
The population of the township increased with the growth of the textile trades. By 1800 the population was about 1,400; 60 years later, it was approaching 3,700. After this, there was a general decline and for nearly a century the figure was around 3,000. In 1971 there were 2,800 inhabitants, but following housing developments at Highburton the population is nearer 5,000.

The Huddersfield–Kirkburton Branch Line opened in 1867, serving two terminal railway stations as well as , , Fenay Bridge and Lepton. It was unusual in that it was operated by the London and North Western Railway company in an area where the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway company had a virtual monopoly. Plans to extend the line to Barnsley never materialised and Kirkburton remained at the end of the line which was primarily used for goods traffic, although passenger services ran until 1930. The line continued as a transport goods until the 1960s, when a combination of road haulage and a decline in industry lead to closure of the railway station in 1965. Evidence of the railway remains in the area around Northwood Park, a housing development built on the old route. Parts of the railway station still remain, albeit in ruined state, and the bricked-up tunnel can be seen when travelling into the village centre from the Penistone Road.

A psychiatric hospital operated at Storthes Hall from 1904–1991. It was founded as an asylum, the Storthes Hall Mental Hospital (1929–1938), the West Riding Mental Hospital (1939–1948) and Storthes Hall Hospital (1949–1991). After the hospital closed the land was sold to the University of Huddersfield and halls of residence were built. Most of the site is the Storthes Hall Park Student Village, and the remaining area due for further development as a retirement village.

Kirkburton&#x27;s major industries were the woollen industry and coal. The village has a small shopping centre in Kirkburton but Highburton has become the residential centre.

===Industry===
The manufacture of woollen cloth was well established here by the time of Queen Elizabeth I. It expanded rapidly after the late 18th century. The first textile mill was built at Dogley in about 1787 and used waterpower to prepare wool for spinning and for fulling the finished cloth. In about 1800 another mill opened at Linfit, which used steam power. Both mills gradually took on other processes and developed into substantial businesses under the Kenyon and Hey families. By 1880 there were eight mills at work in the township.

Leather tanning and the exploitation of coal seams made valuable contributions to the economy of Kirkburton for several centuries. The last tannery closed in the 1830s. Coal mining grew in importance with the increased use of steam for pumping water and by 1850 there were 20 small pits in the township. The remains of a number of mines and bell pits can be seen, including the former St Helen&#x27;s Colliery on Moor Lane in Highburton. In the latter half of the 19th century there were more than 30 pits operating around Kirkburton, employing more than 300 men. The last colliery closed about 70 years ago. One old-established industry, which has moved from the village, was the manufacture of edge tools and shovels, which was introduced in the mid-18th century. The last factory, Carter&#x27;s, moved to new premises a few years ago.

In 2006 Shepley Spring Ltd acquired the former Whitley Willows Textile site in Kirkburton and set up a volume bottled water plant, exploiting the vast high-quality ground water sources in this area. Known as Shepley Spring Brookfield, the site operates 24 hours a day and produces tens of millions of bottles for UK supermarkets and wholesalers.

== Governance ==
Historically in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the township and ecclesiastical parish covered a large area centred on Kirkburton. Kirkburton Urban District was created in 1894 and on 1 April 1938 it was enlarged by the addition of Shelley, Shepley, Whitley Upper and parts of Kirkheaton, Lepton, Thurstonland and Farnley Tyas. The urban district was abolished in 1974 when it became part of Kirklees. 

Kirkburton became a civil parish in 1974. Its parish council represents the village and other places within its boundaries including Farnley Tyas, Flockton, Grange Moor, Highburton, Kirkheaton, Lepton, Shelley, Shepley and Thurstonland. In 2011 the civil parish had a population of 26,439.

==Sport==
Kirkburton AFC play in the 1st Division of the West Riding County Amateur Football League at the Gregory Playing Fields on Hallas Road. Kirkburton Junior Football Club train at the artificial pitches at Kirkburton Middle School. The village is home to Stafflex Arena which was the former training ground for Huddersfield Town and is now the home of Shelley C.F.C., Huddersfield Town Ladies and Collegians FC.

Kirkburton Cricket Club was founded at the Rose and Crown Inn on 25 February 1860. The public house, at the bottom of Slant Gate, is now a private residence. The club played at Turnshaws before moving to Riley in 1878. The club was a founding member of the Huddersfield and District Alliance in 1893. Former England cricketer Phillip DeFreitas played for the club in 1995.

The Gregory Fields Tennis Club, formerly the Fenay Bridge Tennis Club, was built on Burton Acres Lane with lottery assistance in 2000. The club has changing facilities and three floodlit macadam courts.

==Other information==

Kirkburton is the home to Kirkburton First School and Kirkburton Middle School. The Adult Education Centre and Special School on Turnshaw Avenue closed in 2006. The village has a masonic hall, six public houses, a purpose-built health centre (opened October 2005), a dental surgery, and a partially staffed police station. The largest housing areas can be found in the areas occupying Riley, Low Town, Brickfields and Turnshaws. North Road and George Street form the main road through the village and houses the majority of shops and businesses.

Kirkburton and Highburton have a community association that meet at the Burton Village Hall, the former Highburton First School, Northfield Lane, Highburton.

Kirkburton has a rapier dance team, who perform traditional longsword dances each New Year&#x27;s Day at pubs in the villages of Kirkburton and Highburton in addition to their numerous appearances at festivals elsewhere in the country. Rapier dancing was a tradition in the village up to the beginning of the 20th century, and was revived in 1974. The team adhere to what is largely believed to be the original dress of clogs, blue waistcoats and trousers with ribbons down the side. The final tradition, that of blackened faces, is only adopted during the New Year performances.

Part of Kirkburton&#x27;s community for a number of years, the Kirkburton Uniformed Group meet at the HQ on Hallas Road. Affiliated with the All Hallows Church in Kirkburton, the Uniformed Group have nearly 100 young members, both Scouts and Guides.

==Religion==
Kirkburton Church is dedicated to All Hallows. It was built in 1190, and is a Grade I listed building. Most of the structure is 13th century although parts have been rebuilt. The tower was added in the 15th century. Inside the church is a late-medieval nave ceiling, large wooden pulpit, stone font and Elizabethan and Jacobean pews. A small window in the chancel may have opened from the cell of a hermit. A restored 10th-century stone crucifix can be found inside, supporting the belief that another church or Christian settlement may have existed on this site. The church has undergone extensive restoration. The churchyard has also undergone landscaping and is a designated wildlife sanctuary.

The Salvation Army Corps was established in the village in 1885. Its present headquarters were opened in 1964. The Salvation Army left the village in 2005 and the premises are owned by the Denby Dale Centre, a registered charity.

The Methodist Chapel was built at Ponty in 1816 but moved to North Road in 1845 on the hill just off the main road that runs behind the old library. The chapel closed in 1987 and is now a private residence.

The Primitive Methodist Chapel was built at the top of Slant Gate, Highburton in 1832. A school, now demolished, was built in 1899 and the chapel was enlarged in 1926. Like the Methodist chapel in Kirkburton it closed, this time in 1973, and is now a private house.

==Places of interest==
The Masonic Hall is opposite the police station and All Hallows&#x27; Church on George Street. It was built in 1889 in a mock-Tudor style as a meeting hall for the local Freemasons. The Beaumont Lodge has met in the building ever since.

The George Inn, the oldest public house in the village, was built in the 18th century. It is on George Street, next to the old blacksmith&#x27;s overlooked by All Hallows&#x27; Church. In 1777 commissioners met there to agree on the creation of the Halifax to Penistone Turnpike, the forerunner of Penistone Road. The Royal Hotel is a Victorian public house built in stone in 1870 was the second largest pub in the village. It has been converted into a Co-operative store.

Springfield Mill dates from about 1820. The owners built Springfield House in the 1830s. It was bought by Kirkburton Urban District Council in 1935 and as re-opened it as the local town hall three years later. The council sold it in 1982. Now known as Kirkburton Hall, it is a Grade II listed building (1978).

The Foxglove public house was built in 1868 in a mock-Tudor style at the same time as the branch line. It was hoped that Kirkburton would become a junction on an extended line to Barnsley, hence its original name, the Railway Junction, but this never materialised. It was known locally as the Three Owls until 2000, when it adopted its new name. An extension was built in 2001 which is now the hotel part of the building.

Manor Mill at Linfit is one of three former corn mills in the township, the others were at Dogley Bar and Smithy Hill. Dating from about 1832, this mill had one of the largest water wheels in the country, with a diameter of 50 feet: it was removed for scrap during the Second World War.

Recent archaeological excavations at Myers Wood have uncovered the most complete iron-working site in the North of England. The Cistercian monastic site was in operation from the 12th to the 14th century, using advanced techniques and water power for smelting and smithing iron.

<doc id="152358" wikidata="Q918975" url="?curid=152358" title="Kirklees">
<text>Kirklees is a metropolitan borough of West Yorkshire, England. The borough comprises the ten towns of Batley, Birstall, Cleckheaton, Dewsbury, Heckmondwike, Holmfirth, Huddersfield, Meltham, Mirfield and Slaithwaite. It is governed by Kirklees Council. Kirklees had a population of 422,500 in 2011; it is the third-largest metropolitan district in England by area, behind Doncaster and Leeds.

==History==
The borough was formed on 1 April 1974 by the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972 as part of a reform of local government in England. Eleven former local government districts were merged: the county boroughs of Huddersfield and Dewsbury, the municipal boroughs of Batley and Spenborough and the urban districts of Colne Valley, Denby Dale, Heckmondwike, Holmfirth, Kirkburton, Meltham and Mirfield.

The name &quot;Kirklees&quot; was chosen by the merging councils from more than fifty suggestions, including &quot;Upper Agbrigg&quot;, &quot;Brigantia&quot; and &quot;Wooldale&quot;. It was named after Kirklees Priory, which is claimed to be site of Robin Hood&#x27;s death, situated midway between Huddersfield and Dewsbury. The priory was located within the present-day Kirklees Park estate, most of which actually lies in the neighbouring borough of Calderdale.

Under the original draft of the Act, the district would have included Ossett, part of the Dewsbury Parliamentary constituency at that time. It was eventually decided that Ossett was too remote to be governed from Huddersfield and the town was included within the Wakefield district instead.

==Geography==

Kirklees sits in quite a central position to all the other surrounding unitary boroughs of West Yorkshire, with people living in the northern parts commuting to Leeds and York for work and education. People living in the western parts commute to Bradford, Halifax and Huddersfield for education and work. People living in the southern and eastern parts commute to Wakefield, Barnsley, Sheffield and Manchester for work and education. The largest towns and principal districts in the borough are Huddersfield, Dewsbury, Batley, Heckmondwike and Cleckheaton.

The principal settlements of Kirklees are mill towns in the Colne Valley, Holme Valley, Calder Valley and Spen Valley. Those areas of the district with a more urban character bound Calderdale to the west, Bradford to the north-west, Leeds to the north-east and Wakefield to the east.

The district also includes several rural villages, with the largest rural area extending from the south of Huddersfield. The Pennine countryside to the south-west of Meltham and Holme lies within the Peak District National Park. This moorland area mostly bounds Saddleworth, a traditional part of Yorkshire but now locally governed from Oldham, Greater Manchester. There is also a relatively short border with the High Peak district of Derbyshire, running across the summit of Black Hill, and the main border to the south of Kirklees is with Barnsley.

The inclusion of two county boroughs resulted in a district without an obvious centre. Over the years there have been suggestions of splitting the district into two, administered from Huddersfield and Dewsbury. Graham Riddick, as MP for Colne Valley, campaigned for a split in the early 1990s. A similar ambition was mentioned by Elizabeth Peacock, MP for Batley and Spen in 1991. The boundaries of metropolitan boroughs were outside the remit of the Banham Commission appointed to review local government structures in 1992 or its successors, and only minor boundary changes were made with neighbouring districts in 1994.

The district includes parts of three postcode areas. Huddersfield and the rural areas to the south have HD postcodes, Birkenshaw, Cleckheaton and Gomersal have BD postcodes, and the rest of the Heavy Woollen area has WF postcodes. Similarly the district is split between several telephone dialling codes, with most residents in the 01484 (Huddersfield), 01274 (Bradford) and 01924 (Wakefield) codes. A small number of residents in Birchencliffe and Birkenshaw villages fall within the 01422 (Halifax) and 0113 (Leeds) codes respectively.

== Transport ==
Public transport information is provided by Metro, as is the case across West Yorkshire.

=== Rail ===
Kirklees lies along the core Huddersfield line of the TransPennine Express network, with services calling at Huddersfield and Dewsbury. Direct Grand Central services to London King&#x27;s Cross call at Mirfield. Other railway stations in the district on these routes and on the Penistone line have local Northern Trains services. Some towns in Kirklees have not been served by rail transport since the Beeching cuts. Dewsbury and Batley are served by the Calder Valley Line and the TransPennine Express lines. These serve an important urban area around Leeds and Kirklees with services to further away stations including Manchester Victoria and Liverpool Lime Street.

=== Bus ===
Most bus services in the Huddersfield area are operated by Team Pennine and First West Yorkshire, and most bus services in the Heavy Woollen area are operated by Arriva Yorkshire.

=== Road ===
The urban areas of Kirklees are served by the M62 and M1 motorways. Parts of the local road network are considered to require improvement, such as the main route from Huddersfield to the southbound M1 which narrows as it passes through Flockton.

=== Bicycle ===
Kirklees Council has developed a number of traffic-free cycle paths called Greenways in partnership with Sustrans.

==Tourism==
Tourism in Kirklees is based around the area&#x27;s countryside and industrial heritage:

* All Saints&#x27; Church, Batley

Kirklees Council closed Dewsbury Museum and Red House Museum at the end of 2016, claiming it could not afford to continue running them following cuts to its budget.

Tourist information in Kirklees can be obtained from major libraries.

== Sport ==
Huddersfield Town play football in the EFL Championship as of the 2022–23 season. They were the first English club to win three successive league titles.
There are also 3 semi professional football teams within Kirklees, Liversedge, Emley and Golcar United.

The birthplace of rugby league was at the George Hotel, Huddersfield; local clubs include Super League side Huddersfield Giants, alongside Batley Bulldogs and Dewsbury Rams who both play in the Championship.

==Media==
Kirkless is served by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire broadcasting from the Emley Moor transmitter which is situated near the village of Emley, in Huddersfield.

*Capital Yorkshire on 105.1 FM
*Pulse 1 on 102.5 FM
*Greatest Hits Radio West Yorkshire on 96.3 FM
*Branch FM on 101.8 FM (for Dewsbury)

==Governance==

===Council===

Kirklees Council is the local authority of the district. The council is composed of 69 councillors, three for each of the borough&#x27;s 23 wards. Elections are held three years out of four, on the first Thursday of May. One third of the councillors are elected, for a four-year term, in each election. The council is currently led by a Labour executive.

===Borough status and mayoralty===
The shadow Kirklees District Council petitioned the privy council for a royal charter under section 245 of the Local Government Act 1972 granting the status of a borough from 1 April 1974. The grant of borough status entitled the chairman of the council to the title of &quot;mayor&quot;, effectively continuing the mayoralties of the former boroughs of Dewsbury (1862), Huddersfield (1898), Batley (1869) and Spenborough (1955). The mayor is elected from among the councillors for a one-year term (the &quot;civic year&quot;) at the council&#x27;s annual meeting.

Kirklees is the most populated borough or district in England not to have city status. In 2001 it was announced that a grant of city status was to be made to an English town to mark the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, and Kirklees council indicated that it was considering applying on behalf of Huddersfield. An unofficial telephone poll by the Huddersfield Examiner found a slim majority against the proposal, and the council did not proceed with the application.

====Freedom of the borough====

Borough status also allows the council to confer the freedom of the borough on &quot;persons of distinction&quot;. Since its formation Kirklees Council has granted this right to two individuals and two groups:
* 3rd Battalion Yorkshire Volunteers - (25 March 1979) On 25 March 1979, Kirklees Metropolitan Borough Council gave the Freedom of Kirklees to the 3rd Battalion of the Yorkshire Volunteers. The 3rd Battalion was at that time the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment (West Riding) Territorial Army unit. However the freedom given by Kirklees to the 3rd battalion of the Yorkshire Volunteers did not permit any transfer to heirs or successors and effectively that freedom ceased when the battalion was amalgamated into the East and West Riding Regiment on 1 July 1999. The East and West Riding Regiment ceased to exist on 6 June 2006, having been merged into the Yorkshire Regiment as its 4th Battalion. The Yorkshire Regiment requested the freedom to march to be transferred to them. On 25 October 2008 Kirklees Council transferred the Freedom of Huddersfield to the Yorkshire Regiment at a freedom parade held by the 3rd Battalion, formerly the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment (West Riding).
* Sir William Mallalieu MP (27 January 1980)
* The Rt Hon Betty Boothroyd MP (20 November 1992)
* Citizens of Besançon, France (7 October 2005)
* The Yorkshire Regiment (25 October 2008)
* Simon Armitage (20 March 2024)
* Sir Patrick Stewart (20 March 2024)
===Twin towns===
Kirklees is twinned with:

* Besançon, France
* Kostanay, Kazakhstan 1989
* Bielsko-Biała, Poland 1997
* Kreis Unna, Germany 1967
===Coat of arms===
Kirklees Borough Council was granted armorial bearings by the College of Arms by letters patent dated 24 June 1974. the blazon of the arms is as follows:
Vert on a bend Argent a bendlet wavy azure on a chief Or a pale between two cog-wheels azure on the pale a Paschal Lamb supporting a staff of the fourth flying therefrom a forked pennon argent charged with a cross gules; &quot;and for a Crest&quot;, On a wreath of the colours a ram&#x27;s head affronty couped argent armed Or gorged with a mural crown sable masoned argent.
&quot;Supporters&quot;: On either side a lion guardant purpure resting the inner hind leg on a cross crosslet Or embellished in each of the four angles with a fleur de lis azure. &quot;Badge or device&quot;: A roundel purpure charged with a Lacy Knot Or all within a circle of eleven roses argent barbed and seeded proper.
The green colouring of the shield represents the fields, woods and moorland of the borough. The white stripe or &quot;bend&quot; represents the M62 motorway, while the blue wave upon it is for the many waterways of the area. On the &quot;chief&quot; or upper third of the shield is a paschal lamb, symbol of St John the Baptist. John was the patron saint of woolworkers, and the inclusion of the emblem represents the historic woollen industry. The cogwheels are for the modern engineering industries. The crest is a ram&#x27;s head, found in the arms of the County Borough of Huddersfield and the Mirfield Urban District Council. The black mural crown stands for the district&#x27;s status as a borough, recalling a city wall. The supporters are purple lions from the arms of the de Laci family, medieval lords of Huddersfield. For heraldic &quot;difference&quot; from other lion supporters a distinctive cross has been placed below their inner feet. This device, combining the symbols of Christ and the Virgin Mary, represents the priory from which the borough took its name.

===Parish and town councils===
In five areas of the borough there is a second tier of local government: the civil parish. Parish or town councils have limited powers of a purely local character, such as owning or maintaining allotments, burial grounds, footpaths and war memorials. Four of the parishes were formed as successor parishes to urban districts abolished in 1974. The fifth was formed in 1988. The five town or parish councils are:

The remainder of the borough is unparished, with the borough council exercising parish powers.

===Parliamentary representation===

====1997 to date====
Since 1997 Kirklees has been divided into five constituencies: four being entirely within the borough, while one ward (Wakefield) is included in the Wakefield Council borough.

The boundaries of two of the Colne Valley and Huddersfield constituencies were virtually unchanged from those defined in 1983. Denby Dale and Kirkburton wards were transferred from Dewsbury to Wakefield, with the former constituency receiving Heckmondwike ward from Batley and Spen.

The constituencies were first used at the 1997 general election, when the Labour Party came to power in a landslide, gaining all the seats in the borough. The party held the seats at the subsequent elections of 2001 and 2005. The incumbent MP for Batley and Spen, Jo Cox, was murdered on 16 June 2016. A constituency by-election took place on 20 October 2016 and Tracy Brabin was elected. A further by-election will be held in the constituency on 1 July 2021, after Brabin&#x27;s resignation, following her election as Mayor of West Yorkshire.

====1983 to 1997====
The 1983 general election was the first at which constituencies based on the administrative areas created in 1974 were used. Kirklees was divided into four constituencies. The Conservative Party polled well in the 1983 election, and took two of the borough&#x27;s constituencies. Labour held Huddersfield, while the Liberals, running in an alliance with the Social Democrats, held Colne Valley. In the following election in 1987 the Labour vote increased slightly, and they gained Dewsbury from the Conservatives. At the same time the Alliance vote fell, and the Conservatives took Colne Valley. The four MPs elected in 1992 were all returned in 1997.

====1974 to 1983====
Parliamentary constituencies in England and Wales continued to be defined in terms of the boroughs and districts abolished in 1974 until a general redistribution of seats in 1983. Accordingly, Kirklees was divided between seven constituencies, which had first been used in the 1950 general election.

<text>Kirkstall is a north-western suburb of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, on the eastern side of the River Aire. The area sits in the Kirkstall ward of Leeds City Council and Leeds Central and Headingley parliamentary constituency, represented by Alex Sobel. The population of the ward at the 2011 Census was 21,709.

To the west is Bramley, to the east is Headingley, and to the north are Hawksworth and West Park. Kirkstall is around from the city centre and is close to the University of Leeds and Leeds Metropolitan University. Its main visitor attraction is Kirkstall Abbey. Another landmark is St. Stephen&#x27;s Church designed by the architect Robert Dennis Chantrell. Richard Oastler, a reformer and fighter for children&#x27;s rights, is buried in a crypt under the church&#x27;s east end.

In the 12th century Cistercian monks founded Kirkstall Abbey, a daughter house of Fountains Abbey in North Yorkshire. The Abbey House Museum opposite the abbey tells the story of the community and the town. Henry De Lacey, Baron of Pontefract, gave the land for the foundation of the abbey, and Kirkstall has a few roads named in his memory. The Abbey Light Railway, which connected the grounds of the abbey with the Bridge Road commercial area, was closed down in 2012.

==History==

The name of Kirkstall comes from a Northern dialect of Old English word &#x27;Kirk&#x27; (&#x27;church&#x27;) and Old English &quot;stall&quot; (&#x27;place&#x27;) and means &#x27;site of a church&#x27;. The traveller John Leland spelt the name as &quot;Christal&quot; in his writings of 1536.

During the English Civil War, the bridge over the Aire at Kirkstall (referred to in a contemporaneous account as &#x27;Churchstall&#x27;) was destroyed by Royalist troops from Leeds. After discovering this, a Parliamentary force led by Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron – from Otley – had to cross the river upstream at Apperley Bridge before retaking Leeds in January 1643.

Kirkstall was historically an important centre of industry. Kirkstall Forge lays claim to being the longest continually used industrial site in Britain founded in the 13th century by the Cistercian monks of the abbey, and a number of printers. The earliest known activity on the site was a medieval mill race which supplied water to power the corn mill at Kirkstall Abbey. Iron production took place at the forge from the 1580s onwards. During the late 18th century the reconstruction of the upper and lower forges allowed &#x27;shovel and spade production&#x27; to commence. A railway was built at the forge in 1830 and sustained growth at the plant. The First World War brought about large scale growth, providing axles for military vehicles and by 1930 most lorries and buses made in the UK had a Kirkstall back axle casing. In 2002 the owners of the site, the Dana Holding Corporation announced the closure of the works, shifting production to India and Spain. The site is undergoing major redevelopment, as is the old Waide&#x27;s Printers &amp; Kwik Save site. Printing has, like iron-founding, suffered a decline, several printing companies remain.
Until 1976 when it was closed, Kirkstall was dominated by a coal fired power station. It was replaced by larger power stations away from town at Ferrybridge, Eggborough and Drax. The power station was demolished in the early 1980s.

===Kirkstall Abbey===

Kirkstall Abbey is a ruined Cistercian monastery set in grounds which are now a public park on the north bank of the River Aire. It was founded in about 1152 and took over 75 years to construct. It was closed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries under the auspices of Henry VIII. The ruins have been painted by artists such as J. M. W. Turner and Thomas Girtin.

==Amenities==

Kirkstall&#x27;s amenities are stretched along Kirkstall Road and Abbey Road. There are several pubs, a supermarket and several other shops around it on the site of the former Waddingtons factory.The Kirkstall Bridge Shopping complex contains many stores. A small shopping precinct is situated adjacent to the A65 and Kirkstall Lane has become dilapidated in recent years, soon to be rebuilt on with houses and shops.

St Stephen&#x27;s C of E (VA) Primary School has a coat of arms that reflects Kirkstall&#x27;s rich history.

Kirkstall is situated on the A65 road which links it to Leeds city centre, Guiseley, Yeadon and Ilkley. This is crossed in the town centre by the B6157 road between Stanningley and Moortown. The latter crosses the River Aire on the Grade II listed Kirkstall Bridge.

There are two railway lines: The Bradford line passes along the Aire Valley and has a railway station at Kirkstall Forge which opened in June 2016. The Harrogate line passes near Kirkstall and Headingley station is a few minutes walk from the centre of Kirkstall. The former Leeds tramway ran through Kirkstall until it was dismantled in 1959, a substation used by the tramway is still visible on Abbey Road. There are many bus routes through Kirkstall. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal also passes through Kirkstall close to the river and its tow path provides walking, running and cycling routes to Leeds and also west to Rodley and Shipley. 
==Notable events==
The Kirkstall Brewery site was converted into a large hall of residence for students of Leeds Metropolitan University. Other developments in Kirkstall include the Morrisons shopping complex, off the A65 road, by the river.

Filming of &quot;The Beiderbecke Affair&quot; took place partly in Kirkstall, using houses around Abbeydale Oval with other scenes shot throughout the area and Moor Grange.

The Kirkstall Festival takes place every year in the grounds of the abbey on the second Saturday in July since 1981. It is a festival of music, local arts and crafts, and is organised by volunteers of the KVCA (Kirkstall Valley Community Association).

Kirkstall Art Trail takes place every year, on the third weekend of July, since it began in 2015. The event attracted over 100 artists, workshops and activities in 2024. The variety of venues used include private houses, Kirkstall Abbey, Hollybush Conservation Centre, cafes and retail. It is organised by a small committee made up of volunteers. During the COVID-19 pandemic the Art Trail was put on hold, and they created a Living Advent Trail during the winter of 2020, which now takes place every year.

==Landmarks==

Kirkstall is rich in historic sites and monuments. St. Stephen&#x27;s churchyard has fine 19th century grave markers. Other landmarks include an elegant early 19th century stone monument on the A65 road near the Kirkstall Forge site. A plaque on the monument indicates that Kirkstall is 200 miles from London and 200 miles from Edinburgh.

The re-located 19th century drinking fountain near the demolished police station at the junction of Abbey Road and Bradford Road proclaims &#x27;Drink and be Grateful&#x27;. The fountain&#x27;s little garden had been neglected for many a year until local community gardening group Kirkstall-in-Bloom made it their initial project in 2012.

Hollybush Conservation Centre (part of The Conservation Volunteers) is located on the site of a former farm. The building dates back to at least 1700. A trade directory of the 1870s lists &#x27;Joseph Whitwell Gentleman Rhubarb farmer of Hollybush House&#x27;. Hollybush Farm, under Whitwell, poineered forced rhubarb, he was known as the largest commercial grower in the area. This led to the creation of the rhubarb triangle.

== 2015 Boxing Day Floods ==
In 2015 Kirkstall was subject to major flooding, affecting over 3,000 properties. The River Aire banks broke leaving vast areas of Kirkstall under deep water, reaching record levels according to the Environment Agency.

During the floods which reached national news, two local men were pictured at a pub the ‘Kirkstall Bridge Inn’ in the beer garden submerged in water drinking pints, the image has since become viral.

<text>Ledsham is a village and civil parish north of Castleford and east of Leeds in the county of West Yorkshire, England. The village is in the City of Leeds metropolitan borough and near to the A1(M) motorway. It had a population of 162 at the 2001 Census, increasing to 181 at the 2011 Census.

== History ==
Ledsham is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Ledesha&quot;, as belonging to Ilbert of Lacy and having six villagers, three ploughlands, and of meadow. However, it was recorded in a charter from 1030 as &quot;Ledesham&quot;. Like nearby Ledston, the name seems to refer to Leeds (or the Old English precursor of this name, &quot;Loidis&quot;, which denoted a region rather than a town); the second element is the Old English word &quot;hām&quot; (&#x27;homestead, farm&#x27;). The name thus meant &#x27;the farm belonging to the region of Loidis&#x27;.

Ledsham was an ancient parish in the wapentake of Barkston Ash in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The parish included the townships of Fairburn and Ledston, which became separate civil parishes in 1866.

==Geography==
To the east is Selby Fork junction, which is also partly in South Milford, in North Yorkshire, but previously in the West Riding; in the early 1960s, the M62 motorway was planned to have its eastern terminus at Ledsham, possibly at the Selby Fork junction.

==Characteristics==
There is a late seventh-century Anglo-Saxon church (the oldest church and the oldest building standing in West Yorkshire), and nearby Ledston Hall. The village school, like schools in Collingham and Thorp Arch, was named after Lady Elizabeth Hastings. The school is now located in the nearby village of Ledston, which was rated as &quot;good&quot; by OFSTED in 2018.

Ledsham has a cricket team, which currently plays in the York league. 

== Governance ==
Since 1974 Ledsham has been a part of the metropolitan borough of the City of Leeds, in the county of West Yorkshire. It is its own civil parish, and is in the Kippax and Methley ward for local affairs, and is in the Elmet and Rothwell Constituency for national level politics.

<text>Jean-Andoche Junot, Duke of Abrantes (; 25 September 1771 – 29 July 1813) was a French military officer who served in the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. He is best known for leading the French invasion of Portugal in 1807.

==Early life==

Junot was born into a bourgeois family in Bussy-le-Grand, Burgundy, on 25 September 1771. He was the fifth son of Michel Junot (1739–1814) and Marie Antoinette Bienaymé (1735–1806). He first attended school in Montbard, then in Châtillon, where be befriended Auguste de Marmont, then studied law in Dijon. At the start of the French Revolution, he was working as a law clerk in Chaumont. Junot embraced the revolutionary cause, and was present at the &quot;Fête de la Fédération&quot; in Paris on 14 July 1790.

==Early career==
On 9 July 1791, Junot was one of the founding members of his hometown&#x27;s National Guard, serving as captain of its 1st company. Later that year he enlisted as a grenadier in the 2nd Battalion of Volunteers of Côte-d&#x27;Or. At the start of the War of the First Coalition, Junot was sent to the Army of the North, receiving the first of many battle wounds at on 11 June 1792. He was soon promoted to sergeant, and was again injured on 16 May 1793 while serving in the Army of the Rhine. During this time, Junot&#x27;s comrades gave him the nickname &quot;the Tempest&quot; (&quot;la Tempête&quot;).

Junot first met then-captain Napoleon Bonaparte at the Siege of Toulon, in late 1793: Bonaparte required a man with good handwriting to write a letter for him, which Junot volunteered to do, and made a lasting impression with his witty jokes after being narrowly missed by a cannonball. After the siege, Bonaparte was made a general and Junot joined him as his aide-de-camp. However, due to his connections to Augustin Robespierre, Bonaparte lost his position and was briefly placed under house arrest. Junot and Auguste de Marmont offered to break him out, which the general declined, but went to them for assistance after his release. Junot, Marmont and Bonaparte, all temporarily unemployed, lived together in a rented room in Paris. In 1795 Junot participated in the suppression of the Royalist revolt of 13 Vendémiaire under Bonaparte, then followed him to the Army of Italy. Junot served in the Montenotte campaign of April 1796, distinguishing himself at the Battle of Millesimo, for which he received the rank of colonel and the honor of delivering to the Directory the first standards captured in the Italian campaigns. He again distinguished himself at Battle of Lonato, where he killed six enemy soldiers in hand-to-hand fighting and suffered three sabre cuts to the head.

==Egyptian campaign==

Junot was one of the first to be informed of Bonaparte&#x27;s planned expedition to Egypt. In May 1798, he left for Egypt along with Bonaparte aboard the expedition&#x27;s flagship, &quot;l&#x27;Orient&quot;, and took part in the capture of Malta. Junot fought at the Battle of the Pyramids on 21 July 1798, as a &quot;chef de brigade&quot;, and was promoted to brigade general on 9 January 1799.

On 8 April 1799, during the ultimately unsuccessful Siege of Acre, Junot distinguished himself leading the vanguard of Kléber&#x27;s division against an Ottoman relief force five times larger, near the town of Nazareth, retreating only after capturing five enemy standards. His actions prevented the Ottomans from reaching the city and earned Junot recognition within the army. However, he was badly injured shortly afterwards in a duel with General François Lanusse, initiated by Junot after Lanusse insulted Bonaparte. In October 1799 he was captured by a British ship while returning to France, and met Horatio Nelson.

== Consulate and early Empire ==
Junot only arrived in France on 14 June 1800, the day of Bonaparte&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Marengo. That year, Junot married Laure Martin de Permond, a long-time friend of the Bonapartes. Napoleon paid for most of the wedding expenses, provided a dowry for Laure, and gave lavish gifts to the young couple. Under the consulate, Junot was known for his excesses, throwing money out of his windows and eating three hundred oysters a day.

Junot was made a general of division on 20 November 1801. From 1803 to 1804 he served as Military Governor of Paris, then briefly as ambassador to Portugal before rapidly hurrying back to serve under Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz (2 December 1805). Junot was then sent to Parma to put down an insurrection. On his return to Paris he was again appointed Military Governor, serving from 1806 to 1807. 
==Invasion of Portugal==

Junot&#x27;s major command came on 29 July 1807, when Napoleon appointed him commander-in-chief of the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Corps d&#x27;observation de la Gironde&quot;), which was destined for an invasion of Portugal. The army assembled in Bayonne over the next two months, and was later reinforced with a Spanish contingent under the terms of the Treaty of Fontainebleau (27 October 1807). Departing on 17 October at the head of about 26,500 soldiers, Junot led his troops on an arduous march through Spain, finally crossing into Portugal at Segura on 19 November.

Facing little to no resistance, Junot&#x27;s army advanced towards Lisbon, seizing Castelo Branco on 20 November and Abrantes two days later. On 24 November, he was informed that the country&#x27;s regent, Prince João (the future King João VI) was preparing to flee to Brazil along with his mother, Queen Maria I, and the court. Junot entered Lisbon without a fight on 30 November, three days after the royal family&#x27;s departure.

French and Spanish troops soon occupied the rest of Portugal. For his success, Junot was granted the victory title of Duke of Abrantes (&quot;Duc d&#x27;Abrantès&quot;) by Napoleon, though he was not made a Marshal of the Empire as he expected. He set up his headquarters at the Quintela Palace in Lisbon, as the head of the military administration in Portugal. From late December 1807 to March 1808, Junot enacted far-reaching measures, such as the disbandment of the Portuguese Army (with around 9,000 soldiers joining the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;&#x27;s Portuguese Legion) and local militias, the proclamation of the dethronement of the House of Braganza, and the confiscation of royal assets.

In January 1808, initial incidents of Portuguese resistance to the occupation occurred. Additionally, after the Dos de Mayo Uprising in Madrid, all Spanish troops withdrew from Portugal, and by June, popular revolts had spread throughout the country. On 1 August 1808, a British expeditionary force landed at the mouth of the Mondego river. After a French defeat at Roliça, Junot himself was beaten at the Battle of Vimeiro on 21 August 1808, and he was cut off from France.

Only the signing of the advantageous Convention of Cintra with the British allowed him to avoid capture, taking with him &quot;the weapons and baggages&quot; and the loot the army had managed to gather—an expression that later became famous in Portuguese usage. He went back to France in October. The terms of the Convention caused widespread outrage in Britain.

==Later career==
Upon his return, Junot was appointed commander of the III Corps and sent to Spain, where he fought at the Second Siege of Zaragoza. In 1809, he served in the Grande Armée during the War of the Fifth Coalition, but held no major command. He was defeated at Gefrees in this war. Junot returned to the Iberian Peninsula in 1810 in command of the VIII Corps, under Marshal André Masséna, and in 1811 was shot in the face, causing serious damage and requiring surgery. Complications related to this injury were blamed for his later mental decline.

At the beginning of 1812 Junot was on leave to restore his ill health, but at the announcement of the infamous Russian campaign he rejoined the army with hopes of regaining Napoleon&#x27;s favour. He was blamed for allowing the Russian army to retreat following the Battle of Smolensk (17 August), but at the Battle of Borodino (7 September 1812) he commanded the VIII Corps competently. Junot&#x27;s performance at Smolensk led to his removal from command, and infuriated Napoleon to the point that he vowed never to grant Junot a marshal&#x27;s baton. However, Junot himself declared that, due to various complications, it had been impossible for him to attack at Smolensk, and claimed that his rival Joachim Murat had put the blame on him.

In May 1813, Junot was made Governor of the Illyrian Provinces. His mental state rapidly deteriorated there, and on one infamous occasion he attended a ball, held by Auguste de Marmont in Ragusa, fully nude except for his dancing shoes and decorations. On another occasion he burnt down his residence and ran away to live with a madman. Some time later, Junot suffered a sudden attack of inflammation to the brain, most likely a long term consequence of his numerous head injuries, leaving him incapacitated. He was then relieved of his position and sent to his father&#x27;s house in Burgundy, where he was cared for by his father, sisters and brother-in-law Albert. In a fit of distress, Junot defenestrated himself, breaking both of his legs. He became convinced that his legs needed to be amputated, and when briefly left alone he mutilated himself with a pair of scissors. Junot died of an infection days later on 29 July 1813, in Montbard.

He is buried in Montbard cemetery, where a monument was erected in his honour in 1898.
==Family and relations==
He had two daughters and three sons:
* Othello (Egypt, c. 1799), the child of an Abyssinian slave named Xraxarane born during the French campaign in Egypt. Junot ordered for Othello to be brought to France, but he never arrived.
* Joséphine Junot d&#x27;Abrantès (Paris, 2 January 1802 – Paris, 15 October 1888), married in November 1841 to Jacques-Louis Amet, and had issue
* Constance Junot d&#x27;Abrantès (Paris, 12 May 1803 – 1881), married in 1829 Louis &quot;Antoine&quot; Aubert (1799–1882), and had issue
* Louis &quot;Napoléon&quot; Andoche Junot, 2nd Duc d&#x27;Abrantès (Paris, 25 September 1807 – Neuilly, 20 February 1851), who died unmarried and without issue
* Andoche &quot;Alfred&quot; Michel Junot, 3rd Duc d&#x27;Abrantès (Ciudad Rodrigo, 25 November 1810 – killed in action at Solferino, 24 June 1859), married firstly on 2 April 1845 Marie Céline &quot;Elise&quot; Lepic (9 October 1824 – 6 June 1847), and married secondly on 10 January 1853 Marie Louise &quot;Léonie&quot; Lepic (19 July 1829 – 17 August 1868), both sisters, daughters of Joachim Lepic, 1st Baron Lepic, and wife Anne-Marguerite Pasquier, and had:
** Jeanne Joséphine Marguerite Junot d&#x27;Abrantès (Paris, 22 May 1847 – Lasray, 21 March 1934), married in Paris, 16 September 1869 Xavier Eugène &quot;Maurice&quot; Le Ray (Sèvres, 15 July 1846 – Paris, 1 December 1900), who was created 4th Duc d&#x27;Abrantès in 1869, and had issue extinct in male line in 1982
** Jérôme Napoléon Andoche Junot d&#x27;Abrantès (Paris, 16 June 1854 – Paris, 10 March 1857)
** Marguerite Louise Elisabeth Junot d&#x27;Abrantès (Paris, 25 January 1856 – 1919), married in Paris, 11 November 1883 César Elzéar &quot;Léon&quot; Vicomte Arthaud de La Ferrière (1853–1924).

During the peninsular war, he allegedly had a relationship with Juliana de Almeida e Oyenhausen, daughter of Leonor de Almeida Portugal, 4th Marquise of Alorna.

As Governor of Paris in 1806–07, he had an affair with Caroline Murat, wife of Joachim Murat and sister of Napoleon Bonaparte. According to Laure Junot, her husband broke off the affair with Caroline after she supported the idea of him duelling Murat.

Through his sister Louise, Junot was the great-great-uncle of French poet and author Pierre Louÿs.

<text>Ledston (historically also spelt Ledstone) is a village in the Leeds metropolitan borough, in the county of West Yorkshire, England. It is north of Castleford and east of Leeds. The parish had a population of 400 in 2001, which decreased slightly to 394 at the 2011 Census.

== History ==
Ledston is first mentioned in 1086, and on through the Middle Ages, in forms like &quot;Ledestun(e)&quot;, &quot;Ledestona&quot;. The name seems to refer to Leeds (or the Old English precursor of this name, &quot;Loidis&quot;, which denoted a region rather than a town), meaning the &quot;tūn&quot; (&#x27;settlement, estate&#x27;) belonging to Leeds.

Mary Pannal of Ledston was executed in 1603 as an accused witch.

Ledston was historically a township in the ancient parish of Ledsham in the wapentake of Barkston Ash in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The township became a separate civil parish in 1866. In 1974 Ledston was transferred to the City of Leeds in the new county of West Yorkshire. On 1 April 2023 the civil parish was abolished.

==Ledston Hall==

Ledston or Ledstone Hall was the home of Lady Elizabeth Hastings, daughter of the 7th Earl of Huntingdon, known as &quot;Lady Betty&quot;. The hall was originally a grange and chapel built by the monks of Pontefract Priory. It is a grade I listed building, and several associated buildings and garden features are also listed.

Ledston Hall featured in the television show &quot;Most Haunted:Live&quot; on 27 October 2007, but was called &quot;Wheler Priory&quot; for security reasons at the time (Wheler being the surname of the last family owning the hall).

Ledston is also home to the Ledston Equine Centre located in the stables of Ledston Hall.

Ledston lies to the east of the A656 road, and there was a railway station named after the village on the Castleford to Garforth line, though this station was actually adjacent to Allerton Bywater Colliery. The village also had a colliery named after it, Ledston Luck, which was connected to the railway via a narrow gauge railway line up to Peckfield Colliery in Micklefield. The colliery, like the railway station, was some distance away from the village from which it took its name, being actually only east of Kippax. Ledston Luck Colliery closed in 1986 and the site is now a local nature reserve.

== White Horse Inn ==
The White Horse Inn is a 15th-century public house. It was 2019 regional winner of North East Pubs in Bloom, and supports various local activities such as the Ledston in Bloom, a village scarecrow competition. and the Ledston christmas light switch on.

<doc id="152368" wikidata="Q5110399" url="?curid=152368" title="Christian views on magic">
<text>Christian views on magic vary widely among Christian denominations and among individuals. Many Christians actively condemn magic as satanic, holding that it opens the way for demonic possession. Some Christians simply view it as entertainment. Conversely, some branches of esoteric Christianity actively engage in magical practices.

==Biblical references==

There are several references to witchcraft in the Bible that strongly condemn such practices. For example, condemns anyone who &quot;casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord, and because of these detestable practices the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you&quot;, and states &quot;Do not allow a sorceress to live&quot; (or in the King James Bible &quot;thou shalt not suffer a witch to live&quot;). It has also been suggested that the word &quot;witch&quot; (Heb. מְכַשֵּׁפָ֖ה &quot;məḵaššêp̄āh&quot;) might be a mistranslation of &quot;poisoner.&quot;

Others point to a primitive idealist belief in a relation between bewitching and coveting, reflected in the occasional translation of the Tenth Commandment as &#x27;Thou shalt not covet&#x27;. This may suggest that the prohibition related specifically to sorcery or the casting of spells to unnaturally possess something.

Some adherents of near-east religions acted as mediums, channeling messages from the dead or from a familiar spirit. The Bible sometimes is translated as referring to &quot;necromancer&quot; and &quot;necromancy&quot; (). However, some lexicographers, including James Strong and Spiros Zodhiates, disagree. These scholars say that the Hebrew word &quot;kashaph&quot; (כשפ), used in Exodus 22:18 and 5 other places in the Tanakh comes from a root meaning &quot;to whisper&quot;. Strong, therefore, concludes that the word means &quot;to whisper a spell, &quot;i.e.&quot; to incant or practice magic&quot;. The Contemporary English Version translates as referring to &quot;any kind of magic&quot;.

At the very least, older biblical prohibitions included those against &#x27;sorcery&#x27; to obtain something unnaturally; &#x27;necromancy&#x27; as the practice of magic or divination through demons or the dead, and any forms of malevolent &#x27;bewitchery&#x27;.

==Early Paulian Christianity==
The Apostle Paul&#x27;s Epistle to the Galatians includes sorcery in a list of &quot;works of the flesh&quot;. This disapproval is echoed in the &quot;Didache&quot;, a very early book of church discipline which dates from the mid-late first century.

==Medieval views==

During the Early Middle Ages, the Christian Churches did not conduct witch trials. The Germanic Council of Paderborn in 785 explicitly outlawed the very belief in witches, and the Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne later confirmed the law. Among Eastern Orthodox Christians concentrated in the Byzantine Empire, belief in witchcraft was widely regarded as &quot;deisidaimonia&quot;—superstition—and by the 9th and 10th centuries in the Latin Christian West, belief in witchcraft had begun to be seen as heresy.

Towards the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the early modern period (post-Reformation), belief in witchcraft became more popular and witches were seen as directly in league with the Devil. This marked the beginning of a period of witch hunts among early Protestants which lasted about 200 years, and in some countries, particularly in North-Western Europe, tens of thousands of people were accused of witchcraft and sentenced to death.

The Inquisition within the Roman Catholic Church had conducted trials against supposed witches in the 13th century, but these trials were to punish heresy, of which belief in witchcraft was merely one variety. Inquisitorial courts only became systematically involved in the witch-hunt during the 15th century: in the case of the Madonna Oriente, the Inquisition of Milan was not sure what to do with two women who in 1384 and in 1390 confessed to have participated in a type of white magic.

Not all Inquisitorial courts acknowledged witchcraft. For example, in 1610 as the result of a witch-hunting craze the Suprema (the ruling council of the Spanish Inquisition) gave everybody an Edict of Grace (during which confessing witches were &quot;not&quot; to be punished) and put the only dissenting inquisitor, Alonso de Salazar Frías, in charge of the subsequent investigation. The results of Salazar&#x27;s investigation was that the Spanish Inquisition did not bother witches ever again though they still went after heretics and Crypto-Jews.

===Martin Luther===
Martin Luther shared some of the views about witchcraft that were common in his time. When interpreting Exodus 22:18, he stated that, with the help of the devil, witches could steal milk merely by thinking of a cow. In his Small Catechism, he taught that witchcraft was a sin against the second commandment and prescribed the Biblical penalty for it in a &quot;table talk&quot;:

On 25 August 1538 there was much discussion about witches and sorceresses who poisoned chicken eggs in the nests, or poisoned milk and butter. Doctor Luther said: &quot;One should show no mercy to these [women]; I would burn them myself, for we read in the Law that the priests were the ones to begin the stoning of criminals.&quot;

Luther&#x27;s view of practitioners of magic as quasi-demons was at odds with the Catholic view that emphasized choice and repentance. He also argued that one of the most serious perversions wrought by magic was the threatened degeneration of traditional female roles in the family.

==Renaissance views==
In the era of the Inquisition and anti-witchcraft sentiment, there was a more acceptable form of &quot;purely natural&quot; occult and pagan study, the study of &quot;natural&quot; phenomena in general with no evil or irreligious intent whatsoever.

Renaissance humanism (15th and 16th century) saw a resurgence in hermeticism and Neo-Platonic varieties of ceremonial magic. Both bourgeoisie and nobility of that era showed great fascination with these arts, which exerted an exotic charm by their ascription to Arabic, Jewish, Romani, and Egyptian sources. There was great uncertainty in distinguishing practices of vain superstition, blasphemous occultism, and perfectly sound scholarly knowledge or pious ritual. The people during this time found that the existence of magic was something that could answer the questions that they could not explain through science. To them it was suggesting that while science may explain reason, magic could explain &quot;unreason&quot;.

Marsilio Ficino advocated the existence of spiritual beings and spirits in general, though many such theories ran counter to the ideas of the later Age of Enlightenment, and were treated with hostility by the Roman Catholic Church. Ficino however theorised a &quot;purely natural&quot; magic that did not require the invocation of spirits, malevolent or malicious. Benedictine abbot Johannes Trithemius reportedly created incantations of his own related to beneficial communication with spirits. His works, including the &quot;Steganographia&quot;, were immediately placed on the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot;. However these works were later revealed to be concerned with cryptography and steganography, and the &quot;magical&quot; formulae were cover texts for cryptographic content. Behind their methods however, is an underlying theological motive for their contrivance. The preface to the &quot;Polygraphia&quot; establishes the everyday practicability of Trithemian cryptography as a &quot;secular consequent of the ability of a soul specially empowered by God to reach, by magical means, from earth to Heaven&quot;.

Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa (1486–1535), a German magician, occult writer, theologian, astrologer, and alchemist, wrote the influential &quot;Three Books of Occult Philosophy&quot;, incorporating Kabbalah in its theory and practice of Western magic. It contributed strongly to the Renaissance view of ritual magic&#x27;s relationship with Christianity. Giambattista della Porta expanded on many of these ideas in his &quot;Magia Naturalis&quot;. Giovanni Pico della Mirandola promoted a syncretic worldview combining Platonism, Neoplatonism, Aristotelianism, Hermeticism, and Kabbalah.

Pico&#x27;s Hermetic syncretism was further developed by Athanasius Kircher, a Jesuit priest, hermeticist, and polymath, who wrote extensively on the subject in 1652, bringing further elements such as Orphism and Egyptian mythology to the mix.
Lutheran Bishop James Heiser recently evaluated the writings of Marsilio Ficino and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola as an attempted &quot;Hermetic Reformation&quot;.

===John Dee===

John Dee was an intense Christian, but his religiosity was influenced by Hermetic and Renaissance Neo-Platonism and pervasive Pythagorean doctrines. From Hermeticism he drew a belief that man had the potential for divine power that could be exercised through mathematics. He immersed himself in magic, astrology, and Hermetic philosophy. Much effort in his last 30 years went into trying to commune with angels, so as to learn the universal language of creation and achieve a pre-apocalyptic unity of mankind. His goal was to help bring forth a unified world religion through the healing of the breach of the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches and the recapture of the pure theology of the ancients.

==Modern views==
During the Age of Enlightenment, belief in the powers of witches and sorcerers to harm began to die out in the West. But the reasons for disbelief differed from those of early Christians. For the early Christians the reason was theological—that Christ had already defeated the powers of evil. For the post-Enlightenment Christians in West and North Europe, the disbelief was based on a belief in rationalism and empiricism.

It was at this time, however, that Western Christianity began expanding to parts of Africa and Asia where premodern worldviews still held sway, and where belief in the power of witches and sorcerers to harm was, if anything, stronger than it had been in Northern Europe. Many African Independent Churches developed their own responses to witchcraft and sorcery.

The situation was further complicated by the rise of new religious movements that considered witchcraft to be a religion. These perspectives do not claim that witches actually consciously enter into a pact with Satan because Satan is not normally believed to exist in Wicca or other modern neo-pagan witchcraft practices.

===Christian opposition to witchcraft===
Several Christian groups believe in witchcraft and view it as a negative force. Many fundamentalist Christians believe that witchcraft is a danger to children. The 2006 documentary &quot;Jesus Camp&quot;, which depicts the life of young children attending Becky Fischer&#x27;s summer camp, shows Fischer condemning the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; novels and telling the students that &quot;Warlocks are enemies of God&quot;. While Fischer&#x27;s summer camp has sometimes been identified as Pentecostal, Fischer is most closely associated with the neo-Pentecostal movement known as the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR).

Among Christian organizations, the NAR is especially aggressive in spiritual warfare efforts to counter alleged acts of witchcraft; the NAR&#x27;s globally distributed &quot;Transformations&quot; documentaries by filmmaker George Otis Jr. show charismatic Christians creating mini-utopias by using spiritual mapping to locate and drive off territorial spirits and by banishing accused witches. During the 2008 United States presidential election, footage surfaced from a 2005 church ceremony in which an NAR apostle, Kenyan bishop Thomas Muthee, laid hands on Sarah Palin and called upon God to protect her from &quot;every form of witchcraft&quot;.

===Magic in literature===

Magic in literature, while condemned by some Christians, is often viewed by Christians as non-evil. The key distinction would be between real-life magic and pretend magic. This view holds that in real life, the practice of supernatural abilities (i.e. magic) must have a supernatural power source or origin, which would be either holy or evil. Thus born of Holy Spirit or of demons. (See Spiritual gift and Christian demonology for details on these teachings.) Thus, magic in the Biblical context would be viewed as only an act of evil, whereas in literature, pretend magic is a morally neutral tool available to conduct both good and bad behaviors.

In literature, magical abilities have many different power sources. Technological ability (science) can appear as magic. Often, wielding magic is accomplished by imposing one&#x27;s will by concentration and/or use of devices to control an external magical force. This explanation is offered for the Force in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, magic in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, and magic in &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

The latter two works are by notable Christians, C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, respectively. In the first book in &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;, Lewis specifically explains that magic is a power readily available in some other worlds, less so on Earth. The Empress Jadis (later, the White Witch) was tempted to use magic for selfish reasons to retain control of her world Charn, which ultimately led to the destruction of life there. Lewis related questions of the morality of magic to the same category as the morality of technology, including whether it is real, represents an &#x27;unhealthy interest&#x27;, or contravenes the basic divine plan for our universe.

Tolkien, a devout Catholic, had strict rules imposed by the ruling powers, angels who had assumed the &#x27;raiment of the earth&#x27;, for the use of magic by their servants. These included a general discouragement of magic in all but exceptional circumstances, and also prohibitions against use of magic to control others, to set the self up as a political power, or to create a world that violates the natural order. He did however allow his wizard character to entertain children with magical fireworks.

<doc id="152370" wikidata="Q1760747" url="?curid=152370" title="Marsden, West Yorkshire">
<text>Marsden is a large village in the Colne Valley, in the metropolitan borough of Kirklees, West Yorkshire, England. It is in the South Pennines close to the Peak District which lies to the south. The village is west of Huddersfield at the confluence of the River Colne and Wessenden Brook. It was an important centre for the production of woollen cloth. In 2020, the village had an estimated population of 3,768.

==History==

Marsden grew wealthy in the 19th century from the production of woollen cloth. It is still home to Bank Bottom Mill, later known as Marsden Mill, and to John Edward Crowther Ltd, formerly one of the largest mills in Yorkshire. The Crowthers moved to Marsden in 1876, beginning a long and profitable association with cloth manufacturing in the town.

During the 1930s, Bank Bottom Mill covered an area of , employed 680 looms and provided employment for 1,900 workers.

The Church of St Bartholomew was completed in 1899, although the nave and aisle had been in use from 1895, when the previous chapel was demolished. The tower was built in 1911 and the Parochial Hall in 1924 (with an extension in 1978). The church has a peal of 10 bells.

Production of woollen cloth at Bank Bottom Mill ceased in 2003, with the loss of 244 jobs.

=== Governance ===
Marsden was formerly a township and chapelry in the parishes of Almondbury and Huddersfield. On 26 March 1898 Marsden became a civil parish formed from &quot;Marsden in Almondbury&quot; and &quot;Marsden in Huddersfield&quot;, on 1 April 1937 the parish was abolished to form Colne Valley Urban District. In 1931 the parish had a population of 5,723.

==Geography==

Marsden is the last significant settlement on the West Yorkshire side of the Standedge Pennine crossing into Greater Manchester. The village is in the southern edge of the South Pennines, with the boundary of the Peak District National Park to the south. It is surrounded on three sides by the moorland of Marsden and Meltham Moors with Saddleworth Moor nearby. Marsden has low level access only from the east along the Colne Valley.

The Marsden Moor Estate, which surrounds Marsden to the west and south, includes several reservoirs; it is in the care of the National Trust, which is developing techniques to rehabilitate the moor. Butterley Reservoir with its distinctive spillway is near Marsden inside the Peak District National Park. The Peak District Boundary Walk runs across the moors and into Marsden.

In chronostratigraphy, the British sub-stage of the Carboniferous period, the Marsdenian derives its name from Marsden.

==Transport==
===Road===

Several generations of tracks and roads have crossed the moors near Marsden. Mellor Bridge and Close Gate Bridge are both packhorse bridges. 

The A62 road between Huddersfield and Oldham passes through the village and the Standedge cutting some 2.5 miles (4 km) to the west. The road between Oldham and Huddersfield, especially the stretch between Marsden and Diggle, was named the fourth most dangerous road in Britain in 2003-2005.

===Railway===
Marsden railway station is sited on the Huddersfield line. Services are operated by TransPennine Express to locations including Huddersfield, Manchester Piccadilly, Leeds and Hull.

===Buses===
Local bus services are operated primarily by First West Yorkshire. Routes run to Huddersfield, Honley, Slaithwaite, Saddleworth and Oldham.

There was a tram service from Huddersfield to Marsden between 1914 and 1938 and a trolley bus service from 1938 to 1963. After the Second World War, extremely cheap fares (1d. return) allowed school children from Huddersfield access to the moors around Marsden during summer holidays.

===Canal===

The Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Huddersfield-Manchester railway enter the parallel rail and canal Standedge Tunnels about half a mile (0.8 km) to the west of the village centre.

==Mountain rescue==
The Holme Valley Mountain Rescue Team has its headquarters at Marsden Fire Station from where the volunteer team provides rescue cover for surrounding moorland areas and assists West Yorkshire Police with searches for missing people. The team was founded in 1965 and was based in Meltham before relocating in 2005.

In its centenary year the 1st team were promoted from the West Riding County Amateur League Division 1, and played in the West Riding County Amateur Premier Division for the 2008–09 season. They are currently members of the Yorkshire Amateur Football League

Above the village at Hemplow, on Mount Road is a sports ground that hosts Marsden&#x27;s cricket, golf and tennis clubs, as well as Hemplow Bowling Club. Marsden golf course was created in 1920 and was designed by the legendary Alister MacKenzie who also designed the famous Augusta National, home of the Masters, and possibly the most famous golf course in the world. The cricket club, formed in 1865, runs two teams in the Drake&#x27;s Huddersfield Cricket League and teams in five age groups in the Huddersfield Junior Cricket League.

In 2010 Marsden gained Walkers are Welcome status in recognition of its well-maintained footpaths, facilities and information for walkers and ramblers.

==Culture==
Marsden Silver Prize Band is the local silver band. The village hosts festivals and cultural events throughout the year. Marsden Cuckoo Day, a day-long festival held annually in Spring (April), holds clog dancing, a duck race, music, a procession and a &quot;cuckoo walk&quot;. The Marsden Jazz Festival is held every October, and the winter Imbolc Festival, in which the &#x27;triumph of the Green Man&#x27; (who represents the coming spring), over Jack Frost (the winter) is celebrated with fire juggling and giant puppets. Marsden is the home of Mikron Theatre Company, the world&#x27;s only professional theatre company to tour by Narrowboat.

Marsden&#x27;s &#x27;Cuckoo Day festival&#x27; is named after a local legend of the Marsden Cuckoo:

:&quot;Many years ago the people of Marsden were aware that when the cuckoo arrived, so did the Spring and sunshine. They tried to keep Spring forever, by building a tower around the Cuckoo. Unfortunately, as the last stones were about to be laid, away flew the cuckoo. If only they&#x27;d built the tower one layer higher. As the legend says, it &#x27;were nobbut just wun course too low&#x27;.&quot;

<text>Meltham is a town and civil parish within the Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees, in West Yorkshire, England. It lies in the Holme Valley, below Wessenden Moor, south-west of Huddersfield on the edge of the Peak District National Park.

== Arts ==

===Music===
Meltham is home to the Meltham and Meltham Mills Band, which was established in 1846 as a brass band. They became the first band to win the British Open Title for three consecutive years, a feat only matched by 5 others.

===Television===
Meltham has been used as part of the location for several television projects. The third episode in 1995&#x27;s &quot;Coogan&#x27;s Run&quot; was set in and around Meltham Parish Church Hall. In addition scenes of long-running BBC sitcom &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; and ITV drama &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; used some Meltham houses as character&#x27;s homes. The scout hut has also been used as well as streets for shooting outdoor scenes.

== Industrial history ==

===Brook(e) family===

Meltham Mills was the former site of Jonas Brook and Brothers, a silk mill complex that employed over 1,000 workers during the late 19th century. The Brook family originally came from New House Hall in Sheepridge, moving to Thickhollins towards the end of the 18th century. William Brook married Martha Smith at Bradford Parish Church – the daughter of a prominent Mirfield banker. Their sons Jonas, James and Joseph established their business in Meltham Mills, using a goat&#x27;s head – the crest from the Brook&#x27;s coat of arms – as their brand. The goat&#x27;s head can still be seen on the old office building to the mill complex and their arms are emblazoned in St. James&#x27; Church, in Meltham Mills (which the family built) – a hawkes lure: motto &quot;en dieu ma foy&quot; (in God my trust). Meltham Mills Band also carry the Brook family coat of arms as their official logo. Edward Brook died in 1904 at Hoddom Castle, the house near Ecclefechan, south-west Scotland, which he had purchased in 1878. The Brook family were philanthropists and built housing in Meltham Mills for their employees, including the convalescent home. They also built Meltham Hall, Meltham Town Hall and Helme Church and owned an estate at Enderby in Leicestershire. William Brook is buried with his wife Martha in Meltham Church, but his descendants are buried in the crypt underneath St. James Church, Meltham Mills.

Jonas Brook and Brothers became United Threads in 1890 and Sir Hildred Carlile of Ponsonby Hall, Hertfordshire was a Director of the business. United Threads was closed in 1939 – the business was transferred to Paisley as part of J &amp; P Coats – now Coats Group. The factory site was taken over by David Brown Tractors.

John Charles Brooke, who originated from the Silkstone branch of the Newhouse Hall family was Somerset Herald during the 18th century. He was crushed to death at the Haymarket Theatre in London following the crowd&#x27;s clamour to see King George III in 1794. He is buried in St Benet Paul&#x27;s Wharf in London.

===Tractor factory===
Meltham Mills was also the former base of the David Brown Tractors factory opening in 1939 and closing operations on the site in 1988. The various building have now been converted into a diverse number of industrial units, one housing a Tractor museum and other large sections containing an indoor Kart racing track (now closed down). 

Durker Roods, the former home of Sir David Brown was converted into a hotel and the grounds were sold for private housing. The hotel closed in 2021, and is currently falling into disrepair.

The town has its own joint Scouting and Guides Association buildings.

==Notable people from Meltham==
Meltham was the birthplace of Lance Sergeant James Taylor (25B/82) E Company 2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment (2nd Warwickshire), who fought at, and survived, the battle at Rorke&#x27;s Drift in the Zulu war. Although born in the village, to parents William Dyson Taylor and Sarah Taylor of Helms Lane, both of whom were also born there, he grew up in Manchester and died in Wales, but can still be regarded as a native of Meltham.

Albert Craig, dubbed the Surrey Poet, was also born and raised in Meltham. His ditties mostly related to cricket and football.

Australian textile magnate Godfrey Hirst was born at Royd Edge, Meltham in 1857. In 1890 he founded the Godfrey Hirst Woollen Mills at Geelong, Victoria, which in the early 20th century became the largest manufacturer of textiles in Australia. The company still operates, as Godfrey Hirst Carpets. Hirst died in 1917.

Dora Thewlis, who gained brief national notoriety as a young suffragette when a photograph of her arrest appeared on the front page of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, was born on Shady Row, Meltham Mills, in May 1890. Within a few years of her birth, the residents of the row had successfully petitioned to have the boundary redrawn so that the entirety of Meltham Mills was within the township of Meltham.

<text>Morley is a market town and a civil parish within the City of Leeds metropolitan borough, in West Yorkshire, England. Morley is the largest town in the borough after Leeds itself. Morley forms part of the Heavy Woollen District.

It lies approximately south-west of Leeds city centre. It was built on seven hills: Scatcherd Hill, Dawson Hill, Daisy Hill, Chapel Hill, Hunger Hill, Troy Hill and Banks Hill. In 2011, the town and civil parish had populations of 44,440 and 27,738 respectively.

The town is split between the Morley North and Morley South wards (containing the town centre) of Leeds City Council, both making up part of the Leeds South West and Morley parliamentary constituency.

==History==

Morley was mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086 as &quot;Morelege&quot;, &quot;Morelei&quot; and &quot;Moreleia&quot;. Morley means &quot;open ground by a moor&quot;, from Old English &quot;mōr&quot; &quot;moor, clearing, pasture&quot; + &quot;lēah&quot; &quot;open ground, clearing&quot;. It gave its name to &quot;Morelei Wapentac&quot;, a wapentake which probably met at Tingley.

Howley Hall was built during the 1580s by Sir John Savile, a member of the great Yorkshire landowners, the Savile family. The house was besieged during the English Civil War in 1643 before the Battle of Adwalton Moor but appears to have sustained no serious damage. It continued to be occupied during the 17th century but fell into disrepair. The hall was demolished in 1730 but ruins exist including the cellars of its great hall.

The town became famous for its textile industry, notably the cloth, shoddy, which was worn by both sides in the American Civil War.

It was a significant coal mining area. On 7 October 1872, 34 people were killed in an explosion at the Morley Main Colliery.

==Governance==
Historically, Morley was the centre of one of two divisions of the wapentake of Agbrigg and Morley. Morley became a Municipal Borough in 1889 and under the Local Government Act 1972, was incorporated into the City of Leeds Metropolitan District. Morley is represented on Leeds City Council by three wards (namely Morley North, Morley South and Ardsley and Robin Hood) each with three councillors. At the 2010 general election, Morley and Outwood was won by Ed Balls of the Labour Party, who had been MP for Normanton since 2005, and served as Labour&#x27;s Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2011 until 2015. Balls narrowly lost the seat at the 2015 general election to Conservative Andrea Jenkyns. In the 2024 General Election, Mark Sewards won a majority and ousted Andrea Jenkyns from the MP position after the constituency boundaries were redrawn to change Morley and Outwood to Leeds South West and Morley.

A town council was established in 2000, though it does not cover Drighlington, Gildersome, Tingley and East and West Ardsley – areas formerly part of the municipal borough.

Following a review of parliamentary representation in West Yorkshire, the Morley and Rothwell parliamentary constituency was abolished at the 2010 election and replaced by the Morley and Outwood constituency. 

The town&#x27;s coat of arms featured the symbolic principal industries of the municipal borough: textile manufacturing, coal mining and quarrying.

==Geography==
==Present==


Morley Town Hall is sometimes used for music recordings. Television programmes, &quot;Heartbeat&quot; and &quot;Emmerdale&quot; have used its disused magistrates court and a cobblestoned street to one side. It hosts concerts by local schools and performances by the Morley Amateur Operatic Society, whose pantomimes have taken place at the Alexandra Hall for many years.

<text>Oulton is a village in the City of Leeds metropolitan borough, West Yorkshire, England, between Leeds and Wakefield. It is at the junction of the A639 and A642 roads. Though now adjoining the village of Woodlesford, it was once quite separate.

The village formed part of the Rothwell Urban District until its merger into the City of Leeds Metropolitan District in 1974. Today, it sits in the Rothwell ward of Leeds City Council. It is also in the Wakefield and Rothwell parliamentary constituency.

Oulton Hall was built in 1850 and is now a hotel and conference centre.

==Sport==
The Oulton Raiders rugby league club was founded in 1962 as Oulton Miners Welfare. In 2018 the team reached the third round of the Challenge Cup. The women&#x27;s team, the Oulton Raidettes, was established in 2012. In 2022, the Raidettes won the Grand Final in the Championship and reached the quarter-finals of the Women&#x27;s Challenge Cup.

<text>John Law (pronounced in French in the traditional approximation of &quot;Laws&quot;, the colloquial Scottish form of the name; 21 April 1671 – 21 March 1729) was a Scottish-French economist and financier. He served as Controller General of Finances under Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, who was regent for the juvenile Louis XV of France, and promoted a novel financial scheme for French public finances known as Law&#x27;s System () with two institutions at its core, John Law&#x27;s Bank and John Law&#x27;s Company.

Whereas Law&#x27;s System unquestionably ended in failure as a monetary framework, it had lasting influence as an early experiment in fiat money. Its soundness remains debated, with some analysts maintaining that it was not fundamentally flawed. Whereas the Mississippi company ended in bankruptcy, whether the collapse of Law&#x27;s System represented an episode of sovereign default is ambiguous, given that France&#x27;s debt situation was largely unchanged.

==Early years==

Law was born into a family of Lowland Scots bankers and goldsmiths from Fife; his father, William, had purchased Lauriston Castle, a landed estate at Cramond on the Firth of Forth and was known as Law of Lauriston. On leaving the High School of Edinburgh, Law joined the family business at the age of 14 and studied the banking business until his father died in 1688. He subsequently neglected the firm in favour of extravagant pursuits and travelled to London, where he lost large sums by gambling.

On 9 April 1694, John Law fought a duel with another British dandy, Edward &quot;Beau&quot; Wilson, in Bloomsbury Square, London. Wilson had challenged Law over the affections of Elizabeth Villiers. Law killed Wilson with a single pass and thrust of his sword. He was arrested and charged with murder and stood trial at the Old Bailey. He appeared before the infamously sadistic &quot;hanging judge&quot; Salathiel Lovell and was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. He was initially incarcerated in Newgate Prison to await execution. His sentence was later commuted to a fine, on the grounds that the killing only amounted to manslaughter. Wilson&#x27;s brother appealed and had Law imprisoned, but he managed to escape to Amsterdam.

==Economic theoretician==

Law urged the establishment of a national bank to create and increase instruments of credit and the issue of banknotes backed by land, gold, or silver. The first manifestation of Law&#x27;s System came when he had returned to Scotland and contributed to the debates leading to the Treaty of Union 1707. He wrote a pamphlet entitled &quot;Two Overtures Humbly Offered to His Grace John Duke of Argyll, Her Majesties High Commissioner, and the Right Honourable the Estates of Parliament&quot; (1705) which foreshadowed the ideas he would propose for establishing new systems of finance, paper money and refinancing the national debt in a subsequent tract entitled &quot;Money and Trade Considered: with a Proposal for Supplying the Nation with Money&quot; (1705). Law&#x27;s propositions of creating a national bank in Scotland were ultimately rejected, and he left to pursue his ambitions abroad.

Law spent ten years moving between France and the Netherlands, dealing in financial speculations. He had the idea of abolishing minor monopolies and private farming of taxes. He would create a bank for national finance and a state company for commerce, ultimately to exclude all private revenue. This would create a huge monopoly of finance and trade run by the state, and its profits would pay off the national debt. 

==Law&#x27;s System==

John Law&#x27;s system, first endorsed by the Regent Philippe d&#x27;Orléans in May 1716 and developed from then in increasing ambitious stages until 1720, rested on the expansion of monetary supply through the creation of fiat money and a complete overhaul of the French state&#x27;s revenue collection, coinage and borrowing, all of which were centralized in Law&#x27;s Company. Along the way, Law&#x27;s Company absorbed all French colonial trading companies which had developed in fits and starts over the previous century, and started an unprecedented colonization of its own in Louisiana with the foundation of New Orleans in 1718. It was renamed the &quot;Compagnie des Indes&quot; (Indies Company) in 1719, and in February 1720 absorbed the bank that Law had initially established in May 1716.

The Regent appointed Law as Controller General of Finances in early 1720, effectively giving him control over external and internal commerce. As Controller General, Law instituted many reforms, some of which had lasting effect, while others were soon abolished. He tried to break up large land-holdings to benefit the peasants; he abolished internal road and canal tolls; he encouraged the building of new roads, the starting of new industries (even importing artisans but mostly by offering low-interest loans), and the revival of overseas commerce — and indeed industry increased by 60 per cent in two years, and the number of French ships engaged in export went from 16 to 300.

The system started to unravel in 1720 as price inflation started to surge. Law sought to hold the Indies Company&#x27;s share price at 9,000 livres in March 1720, and then on 21 May 1720 to engineer a controlled reduction in the value of both notes and the shares, a measure that was itself reversed six days later. As the public rushed to convert banknotes to coin, Law was forced to close the Banque Générale for ten days, then limit the transaction size once the bank reopened. But the queues grew longer, the Indies Company&#x27;s stock price continued to fall, and food prices soared by as much as 60 per cent. At the end of 1720, the Regent eventually dismissed Law as Controller General and as head of the Indies Company.

==Properties and titles==

Law made his home in Place Louis-le-Grand, now place Vendôme, in the where he hosted and entertained various Parisian nobles. On he purchased the from Nicolas Desmarets, and on , the Château de Tancarville from Louis Henri de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, comte d&#x27;Evreux. That latter day Law also purchased the &quot;Hôtel Langlée&quot; on rue des Petits-Champs in Paris. In subsequent years, he went on to purchase numerous estates and properties throughout France, including Toucy, Valençay and in the second half of 1719, and Orcher, , Guermantes and in the course of 1720.

==Later years and death==

Law moved to Brussels on 22 December 1720 in impoverished circumstances when his properties in France were voluntarily confiscated. He spent the next few years gambling in Rome, Copenhagen and Venice but never regained his former prosperity. Law realised he would never return to France when Orléans died suddenly in 1723 and Law was granted permission to return to London, having been pardoned in 1719. He lived in London for four years and then moved to Venice, where he contracted pneumonia and died poor in 1729. His gravestone is in the San Moisè, Venice.

==Legacy and assessment==
Law had lasting influence as a monetary theorist. He held that money creation stimulated an economy, paper money was preferable to metal, and dividend-paying shares a superior form of money. He propounded ideas such as the scarcity theory of value and the real bills doctrine. 

The chaotic collapse of Law&#x27;s System has been compared to the 17th-century tulip mania parable in Holland. The Mississippi bubble coincided with the South Sea bubble in England, which allegedly took ideas from it. 

Henry Thornton explained why Law&#x27;s scheme failed: &quot;He forgot that there might be no bounds to the demand for paper; that the increasing quantity would contribute to the rise of commodities: and the price of commodities require, and seem to justify, a still further increase.&quot;

Law&#x27;s nephew, Jean Law de Lauriston, was later Governor-General of Pondicherry.

The term &quot;millionaire&quot; was coined for beneficiaries of Law&#x27;s scheme.

==Cultural references==
Sharon Condie and Richard Condie&#x27;s 1978 National Film Board of Canada (NFB) animated short &quot;John Law and the Mississippi Bubble&quot; is a humorous interpretation. The film was produced by the NFB at its newly opened Winnipeg studio. It opened in Canadian cinemas starting in September 1979 and was sold to international broadcasters. The film received an award at the Tampere Film Festival.

In 1864 William Harrison Ainsworth published the novel &quot;John Law&quot; based on his career.
John Law is the focus of Rafael Sabatini&#x27;s 1949 novel &quot;The Gamester&quot;.

John Law is referenced in Voltaire&#x27;s &#x27;Dictionnaire Philosophique&#x27;, as part of the entry on reason.

John Law is the subject of the section entitled &quot;Fragment d&#x27;un ancien mythologiste&quot; in &quot;Lettre CXLII&quot; of Montesquieu&#x27;s epistolary novel &quot;Lettres Persanes&quot; published in 1721.

Among the works written for Brain is Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings&quot; (1944). Other composers who wrote for him include Malcolm Arnold, Lennox Berkeley, Alan Bush, Gordon Jacob, Humphrey Searle and Mátyás Seiber.

Brain was killed in a car crash at the age of 36.

==Life and career==
===Early years===

Brain was born in Hammersmith, London on 17 May 1921 to a musical family. His mother, Marion, &quot;née&quot; Beeley (1887–1954), was a singer at Covent Garden and his father, Aubrey Harold Brain, was first horn of the London Symphony Orchestra and regarded as &quot;the leading exponent of the instrument in Britain at that time&quot;. Aubrey&#x27;s father, Alfred Edwin Brain, Sr., and elder brother, Alfred Edwin Brain Jr., had been prominent horn players in Britain, and in the latter&#x27;s case the US. Brain&#x27;s elder brother, Leonard (1915–1975), became a leading player of the oboe and cor anglais, principal of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.
Brain was educated at Richmond Hill Preparatory School and then St Paul&#x27;s School, London. Although it was assumed that he would become a horn player, his father kept him largely away from the instrument as a boy, in the belief that it should not be played until the adult teeth developed. Brain was allowed to blow a few notes on his father&#x27;s horn every Saturday morning, to maintain his interest, but his first musical studies were piano and organ.

In 1936 Brain was admitted to the Royal Academy of Music (RAM) to study horn under his father, who was a professor of the instrument there. He also studied piano with Max Pirani, organ with G. D. Cunningham and harmony with Montague Phillips. His professional début was on 6 October 1938 when he played in Bach&#x27;s Brandenburg Concerto no. 1 (which features two concertante horn parts) as second horn to his father in the Queen&#x27;s Hall, London, under the baton of Adolf Busch. The music critic of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote:

The following month Brain and his brother were soloists in a concert featuring Mozart&#x27;s Horn Quintet (K. 407) and Oboe Quintet (K. 370). He appeared with ensembles including the Griller and Busch quartets and made broadcasts for the BBC, the first of which, in February 1939, featured Mozart&#x27;s Divertimento in D (K334) with Aubrey as first horn and Dennis as second. In the same month father and son recorded the work for Columbia with the Léner Quartet.

===RAF and wartime===
At the start of the Second World War Brain and his brother joined the armed forces. Unlike Germany and Italy, Britain did not exempt musicians from conscription, but the conductor of the Central Band of the Royal Air Force, Wing Commander Rudolph O&#x27;Donnell, made considerable, and largely successful, efforts to ensure that, as Walter Legge put it, &quot;every exceptionally able young instrumentalist knew that a place would be found for him in the RAF Band&quot;. The band became what &quot;The Independent&quot; described as &quot;a legendary ensemble&quot;, and an RAF Symphony Orchestra was a spin-off. With them, Brain made a three-month tour of the US in 1944–45, and played during the Potsdam Conference in 1945.

Players in the RAF ensemble were allowed to perform for civilian managements when not required for official duties. Brain made 26 solo appearances in the wartime National Gallery concerts organised by Myra Hess, in a range of works including the Mozart Horn Quintet (K407) and the Brahms Trio for Horn, Violin and Piano (Op. 40), which became, as his biographer Tim Barringer writes, &quot;his signature works in later years&quot;. For the BBC he made more than 20 broadcasts during the war for the home or forces networks, mostly of chamber music, but on one occasion playing the Mozart Horn Concerto K495 with the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir Adrian Boult.

In mid-1942 Brain met the composer Benjamin Britten; the latter was writing incidental music, played by the RAF orchestra, for a series of BBC radio commentaries on war-time Britain which were being broadcast weekly to the US. Britten immediately recognised Brain&#x27;s exceptional skill, and took little persuading to write a concert work for him. This was the Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings, premiered at the Wigmore Hall in October 1944 with Brain and Peter Pears as soloists. Britten acknowledged Brain&#x27;s help during the composition of the work:
===Later years===
By 1945, Brain, at 24 years of age, was the most sought-after horn player in England. His father injured himself in a fall, and retired from the BBC Symphony Orchestra, although he remained professor at the RAM until his death ten years later. After the war, Legge and Sir Thomas Beecham founded the Philharmonia and the Royal Philharmonic orchestras, respectively. Brain was principal horn in both, playing for Beecham alongside the woodwind players dubbed &quot;the Royal Family&quot; – Jack Brymer (clarinet), Gwydion Brooke (bassoon), Terence MacDonagh (oboe), and Gerald Jackson (flute). Later, he found that he did not have enough time to fill both positions and resigned from the Royal Philharmonic.

Brain originally played a French instrument, a Raoux piston-valve horn, similar to that used by his father. This type of instrument has a particularly fluid tone and a fine legato, but a less robust sound than the German-made instruments which were becoming common. In 1951 he switched to an Alexander single B instrument. It had a custom lead pipe which was narrower than the usual, and offered a sound which, if not comparable to the Raoux, at least gave a nod in the direction of the lighter French instrument.

Pursuing his interest in chamber music, Brain formed a wind quintet with his brother in 1946. He also established a trio with the pianist Wilfrid Parry and violinist Jean Pougnet. Briefly, Brain put together a chamber ensemble consisting of his friends so that he could conduct. From 1945 he played with Karl Haas&#x27;s London Baroque Ensemble, both on recordings and in concert. Showing his humorous style, Brain performed a Leopold Mozart horn concerto on a rubber hose pipe at a Gerard Hoffnung music festival in 1956, trimming the hose with garden shears to achieve the correct tuning.

In November 1953, under the direction of Herbert von Karajan, and accompanied by the Philharmonia, Brain recorded the four Mozart Horn Concertos for Columbia. In the same month, together with Sidney Sutcliffe (oboe), Bernard Walton (clarinet) and Cecil James (bassoon), he recorded Mozart&#x27;s Sinfonia Concertante for Four Winds. In July 1954, again conducted by Karajan, Brain played the organ part in a recording of the Easter hymn from Pietro Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;. With Sutcliffe, Walton, James and the pianist Walter Gieseking he recorded Mozart&#x27;s Quintet for Piano and Winds, K452, in April 1955. Of Brain&#x27;s other recordings, Legge singled out his playing in the four Brahms Symphonies conducted by Otto Klemperer, Mozart&#x27;s B flat Divertimento with Karajan and Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;, &quot;the horn-player&#x27;s opera &quot;par excellence&quot;!&quot;
Brain was a keen motorist. His brother called him &quot;the finest driver I have ever ridden with&quot;. Barringer writes that Brain bought

On 1 September 1957, at the age of 36, Brain was killed driving home to London after performing the Tchaikovsky Symphony No. 6, &quot;Pathetique&quot; with the Philharmonia under Eugene Ormandy at the Edinburgh Festival. He had driven his Triumph TR2 sports car off the road and into a tree on the A1 road opposite the north gate of the De Havilland Aircraft factory at Hatfield.

Brain was interred at Hampstead Cemetery in London. His headstone is engraved with a passage from the &quot;Declamation&quot; section of Hindemith&#x27;s Horn Concerto:
&lt;poem&gt;
 My call transforms
 The hall to autumn-tinted groves
 What is into what
 Has been...&lt;/poem&gt;

One of Brain&#x27;s favourite horns (by Alexander of Mainz: a single B-flat horn with an F extension as a tuning slide) was badly damaged in his fatal crash. It has since been restored by Paxman Brothers of London and is on public display in the York Gate Collections at the RAM.

==New works and commemorations==
As well as the Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings, Britten wrote Canticle III: &quot;Still falls the rain&quot; with Brain in mind; Brain and Pears, accompanied by the composer, gave the first performance at a concert in 1955 in which Brain also premiered two pieces by Alan Bush. Other composers who wrote for Brain were Malcolm Arnold (Horn Concerto No. 2), Lennox Berkeley (Trio for Horn, Violin and Piano), York Bowen (Concerto for Horn, Strings and Timpani), Hindemith (Concerto for Horn and Orchestra), Gordon Jacob (Concerto for Horn and String Orchestra), Elisabeth Lutyens (Horn Concerto), Humphrey Searle (&quot;Aubade&quot; for Horn and Strings), Mátyás Seiber (&quot;Notturno&quot; for Horn and Strings), and Ernest Tomlinson (&quot;Rhapsody and Rondo&quot; for Horn and Orchestra, &quot;Romance and Rondo&quot; for Horn and Orchestra).

Francis Poulenc wrote &quot;Élégie for Horn and Piano&quot; to commemorate Brain&#x27;s death. It was premiered by the BBC in a broadcast on 17 February 1958, played by Neill Sanders with Poulenc at the piano.

In its obituary notice, &quot;The Times&quot; said of Brain:

<doc id="152388" wikidata="Q7332642" url="?curid=152388" title="Riders of the Purple Wage">
<text>Riders of the Purple Wage (1967) is a science fiction novella by American writer Philip José Farmer. It appeared in &quot;Dangerous Visions&quot;, the New Wave science fiction anthology compiled by Harlan Ellison and won the Hugo Award for best novella in 1968, jointly with &quot;Weyr Search&quot; by Anne McCaffrey.
The title of the story is a take-off on &quot;Riders of the Purple Sage&quot; (1912), a Western novel by the American author Zane Grey. The novella contains multiple stylistic and literary allusions to James Joyce and his works; as with &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1922), it includes canonic references, journal entries, poem pieces, and standard prose, and the main character&#x27;s surname is Winnegan, an allusion to &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; (1939).

==Plot introduction==
&quot;Riders of the Purple Wage&quot; is an extrapolation of the mid-twentieth century&#x27;s tendency towards state supervision and consumer-oriented economic planning. In the story, all citizens receive a basic income (the &quot;purple wage&quot;) from the government, to which everyone is entitled just by being born. The population is self-segregated into relatively small communities, with a controlled environment. It keeps in contact with the rest of the world through the &quot;Fido&quot;, a combination of television and videophone. The typical dwelling is an egg-shaped house, outside of which is a realistic simulation of an open environment with sky, sun, and moon. In reality, each community is on one level of a multi-level arcology. For those who dislike this lifestyle, there are wildlife reserves where they can join &quot;tribes&quot; of Native Americans and like-minded Anglos living closer to nature for a while. Some choose this lifestyle permanently.

Art (and art appreciation) are prominently displayed in this society. Artists receive press coverage comparable to that of today&#x27;s movie stars. The art critics are hardly glamorous, each of whom has a pet theory about art. A critic also acts as an agent and manager, promoting the work of one or more artists, especially if their work seems to support his ideas. The story revolves around one of these pampered artists, who sometimes finds himself uninspired, due to the lack of major conflicts in society.

Sexual relations and sexual orientation are portrayed as absolutely free from prejudice. The main character is bisexual, and it is implied that most of his acquaintances have had at least experimental relations with members of both sexes. Several forms of birth control are also commonplace, encouraged by the government, and freely discussed.

For people who do not want to bother with social interaction, there is the &quot;fornixator&quot;, a device that supplies sexual pleasure on demand by direct stimulation of the brain&#x27;s pleasure centers. The fornixator is technically illegal, but tolerated by the government because its users are happy, never demand anything else, and usually do not procreate.

Two new sets of customs have arisen which profoundly influence the story. By tradition, everyone has a Naming Day when they are grown, at which point they select a name which reflects their outlook on life, their chosen profession, or the way they want others to see them. The second change derives from the so-called &quot;Panamorite&quot; religion, which features total sexual freedom including oral sex between parents and their children. One source of frustration for the main character is his mother&#x27;s decision to &quot;cut him off&quot; from intimate physical contact, a situation made worse by her becoming morbidly obese, which is not unusual in this society.

==Plot summary==
The story revolves around the relationship between a young artist, who has taken the name Chibiabos Elgreco Winnegan, and the man he calls &quot;Grandpa Winnegan&quot; (actually his mother&#x27;s great-great-grandfather), who hides inside the apartments that &quot;Chib&quot; shares with his mother in the community of Ellay. Grandpa is in hiding from the government, and most people think of him as having pulled off some huge swindle in the past. In fact, he was a successful businessman whose workers were highly paid and very content, much more so than the average recipient of the &quot;purple wage&quot;. The resentment which this caused motivated the &quot;gummint&quot; to close down his business, whereupon he managed to steal twenty billion dollars, which has never been found, and (apparently) died. A Federal Agent calling himself &quot;Falco Accipiter&quot; has resolved to hunt down the money at all costs, and is harassing Chib.

Throughout the narrative we are treated to extracts from Grandpa&#x27;s unpublished manuscript, &quot;How I Screwed Uncle Sam &amp; Other Private Ejaculations&quot;. In these writings, he describes society and muses on human foibles. He seems particularly fond of James Joyce, and this is a clue to the story&#x27;s resolution.

Chib is preparing for a new art show. He needs to win a grant to continue painting, otherwise he will have to take forced migration and live in another society, a practice by governments to prevent populations from becoming insular. Chib&#x27;s own community is host to forcibly migrated Arabs, who belong to the strict Wahhabi sect of Islam. Chib wants to woo the daughter of one of these families, much to the disgust of her relatives.

Standing between Chib and the grant is the one-eyed critic Rex Luscus, who took his name from &quot;Inter caecos regnat luscus&quot;, better known as &quot;In the country of the blind, the one-eyed man is King&quot;. The price of Rex&#x27;s approval, which will make Chib famous, is sexual favors. Chib&#x27;s art is controversial. He depicts religious scenes using a three-dimensional technique which presents different views, some of which are blasphemous comments on religion and humanity.

Like most young people, Chib and his friends enjoy rebellion for its own sake. They pretend to plot terrorist attacks when they know they are under surveillance. Such talk is so common that the listening authorities treat it with contempt. The police are laughable by 20th century standards. Dressed in fur-like characters from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; they use electric tricycles no faster than golf carts, which nonetheless are equipped with sirens &quot;to warn the bad guys they are coming&quot;. They have shock-sticks and guns which fire &quot;choke-gas pellets&quot;.

Chib&#x27;s exhibition dissolves into violence as his friend Omar Runic declaims an improvised poem in tribute to Chib&#x27;s latest work. This is also common, particularly as the &quot;fido&quot; reporters are always keen to stir up trouble, and the artists hate the critics. One artist, a science fiction writer named Huga Wells-Erb Heinsturbury, starts the riot by attacking a reporter from &quot;Time&quot; magazine, now a government-run news agency which has kept the attitudes of the original corporation, including a deep hatred of science fiction. Chib smashes his painting, a blasphemous Nativity scene, into Rex Luscus&#x27;s stomach. Suddenly he receives a message from Grandpa. Falco Accipiter has broken into the apartment and found his hiding place.

Grandpa is dead by the time Chib reaches home. He apparently died of shock. In his hand is the last of his &quot;Private Ejaculations&quot;. A devout Catholic himself, according to this last note he comforts himself in an atheist world with the thought that profound hatred of religion means that people still believe God exists, otherwise they would not hate him so.

Chib and his mother attend a reverse funeral, where the coffin which supposedly contained Grandpa&#x27;s body is dug up. As it is opened, there is an explosion, which scatters the stolen billions into the air and sends up a banner announcing &quot;Winnegan&#x27;s Fake!&quot;. Grandpa has cocked a final snook at the &quot;gummint&quot; from beyond the grave.

Chib is handed a note by a man acting for Grandpa&#x27;s estate. The note simply says that Chib must abandon Ellay, leave his mother, and break free so he can paint from love, not out of hatred.

==Characters==
* Chibiabos Elgreco Winnegan, a young artist and confidant of Grandpa Winnegan. In the poem Hiawatha, &quot;the gentle Chibiabos&quot; is Hiawatha&#x27;s close friend.
* Grandpa Winnegan, whose original name was Finnegan. He claimed to be a descendant of the &quot;Tim Finnegan&quot; whose death and resurrection are celebrated in the song Finnegan&#x27;s Wake. He is the last bastion of individual enterprise in the mechanized nanny-state. His adopted last name is a pun on &quot;Win again&quot;.
* Mama Winnegan, Chib&#x27;s mother who spends her life drinking, eating, and playing poker with disreputable friends. She may know that Grandpa is hiding in their apartments, but pretends not to.
* Falco Accipter, a &quot;gummint&quot; agent who is determined to track down Grandpa&#x27;s stolen money, and perhaps Grandpa himself.
* Rex Luscus, one-eyed art critic whose eye is mostly on Chib&#x27;s body. He could have his other eye replaced, but he claims that no art he sees makes it worth his while to have binocular vision.
* The &quot;Young Radishes&quot;, Chib&#x27;s circle of friends who play at plotting revolution and defying authority through their art. Their name is a pun on &quot;radical&quot;, meaning either a root (as in root vegetable or radish) or a person who advocates drastic change in society.
** Omar Bacchylides Runic, a poet with a talent for extemporizing, and Chib&#x27;s occasional lover. His improvised poems tend to inflame people to riot.
** Benedictine Serinus Melba, a singer who claims to be pregnant by Chib. Thanks to an incident with a can of spermicide, Chib finds this hard to believe.
** Rousseau Red Hawk, who affects the persona of a &quot;Red Indian&quot; even though he is a Jewish philosopher who feels intellectually deprived in the nature reserves.
** Huga Wells-Erb Heinsturbury, a science fiction writer whose unwieldy adopted name is derived from the names Hugo Gernsback, H. G. Wells, Edgar Rice Burroughs (E.R.B), Robert A. Heinlein, Theodore Sturgeon and Ray Bradbury.
* Dionysus Gobrinus and Madame Trismegista, owners and proprietors of &quot;The Private Universe&quot;, where Chib and his friends hang out. Gobrinus is a former mathematician. Madame Trismegista is a fortune teller, but Gobrinus somehow believes that she controls fate through the stars via the cards she reads.
* Pinkerton Legrand, a gummint agent monitoring the Young Radishes.

==Influences==
In his afterword to the story, Farmer mentions the Triple Revolution memo, a document sent to United States President Lyndon Johnson in 1964, with policy suggestions for the future of the nation in the face of &quot;three separate and mutually reinforcing revolutions.&quot; These were identified as &quot;The Cybernation Revolution,&quot; (massive automatic production, requiring progressively less human labor), &quot;The Weaponry Revolution&quot; (the development of new forms of weaponry which can obliterate civilization), and &quot;The Human Rights Revolution&quot; (a universal demand for human rights).

The source of Rex Luscus&#x27; name is described in the story as the quote, &quot;In the country of the blind, the one-eyed man is King&quot;. The original phrase is &quot;In regione caecorum, rex est luscus,&quot; from Desiderius Erasmus Roterodamus&#x27; Collecteana Adagiorum. This is likely to also be a reference to the early SF writer H. G. Wells&#x27; story, &quot;The Country of the Blind&quot; (1904) in which a sighted man finds himself in a literal country of the blind, plots to use his advantage to rule them, but fails because his ability is not appreciated by the population.

==Reception==
&quot;Riders of the Purple Wage&quot; is viewed as an example of modernism in New Wave fiction involving Joycean stream-of-consciousness. Critic Algis Budrys asserted that the work demonstrates how to &quot;write more and more about less and less. Farmer can show you how to pile it higher and higher... [an] exercise in self-indulgence&quot;.

==Related works==
A short story called &quot;The Oögenesis of Bird City&quot; (1971) describes an earlier time when the arcologies and the egg-houses were being introduced to society. Of particular interest is a mention in the story that &quot;integration&quot; of communities was a failure and the technology could be used to allow people to dwell &quot;among their own kind&quot;.

<doc id="152389" wikidata="Q367700" url="?curid=152389" title="Ciclosporin">
<text>Ciclosporin, also spelled cyclosporine and cyclosporin, is a calcineurin inhibitor, used as an immunosuppressant medication. It is taken orally or intravenously for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn&#x27;s disease, nephrotic syndrome, eczema, and in organ transplants to prevent rejection. It is also used as eye drops for keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes).
Common side effects include high blood pressure, headache, kidney problems, increased hair growth, and vomiting. Other severe side effects include an increased risk of infection, liver problems, and an increased risk of lymphoma. Blood levels of the medication should be checked to decrease the risk of side effects. Use during pregnancy may result in preterm birth; however, ciclosporin does not appear to cause birth defects.
Ciclosporin is believed to work by decreasing the function of lymphocytes. It does this by forming a complex with cyclophilin to block the phosphatase activity of calcineurin, which in turn decreases the production of inflammatory cytokines by T-lymphocytes.
Ciclosporin was isolated in 1971 from the fungus &quot;Tolypocladium inflatum&quot; and came into medical use in 1983. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 185th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medication.

== Medical uses ==
Ciclosporin is indicated to treat and prevent graft-versus-host disease in bone marrow transplantation and to prevent rejection of kidney, heart, and liver transplants. It is also approved in the US for treating of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, persistent nummular keratitis following adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis, and as eye drops for treating dry eyes caused by Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome and meibomian gland dysfunction.

In addition to these indications, ciclosporin is also used in severe atopic dermatitis, It has been used in severe rheumatoid arthritis and related diseases.

Ciclosporin has also been used in people with acute severe ulcerative colitis and hives that do not respond to treatment with steroids.

== Side effects ==

Side effects of ciclosporin can include gum enlargement, increased hair growth, convulsions, peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, increased cholesterol, trouble breathing, numbness and tingling (particularly of the lips), itchiness, high blood pressure, potassium retention (possibly leading to hyperkalemia), kidney and liver dysfunction, burning sensations at finger tips, and an increased vulnerability to opportunistic fungal and viral infections. Ciclosporin causes hypertension by inducing vasoconstriction in the kidneys and increasing sodium reabsorption. The increase in blood pressure can cause cardiovascular events; it is thus recommended that the lowest effective dose for people requiring long-term treatment be used.

Ciclosporin use after a kidney transplantation is associated with increased levels of uric acid in the blood and, in some cases, gout.

Ciclosporin is listed as an IARC Group 1 carcinogen (i.e. there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans), specifically leading to squamous cell skin cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

== Pharmacology ==
=== Mechanism of action ===

Ciclosporin&#x27;s main effect is to lower the activity of T-cells; it does so by inhibiting calcineurin in the calcineurin–phosphatase pathway and preventing the mitochondrial permeability transition pore from opening. Ciclosporin binds to the cytosolic protein cyclophilin (immunophilin) of lymphocytes, especially of T cells. This cyclosporin—cyclophilin complex inhibits calcineurin, which is normally responsible for activating the transcription of interleukin 2. In T-cells, activation of the T-cell receptor normally increases intracellular calcium, which acts via calmodulin to activate calcineurin. Calcineurin then dephosphorylates the transcription factor NF-AT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells), which moves to the T-cell nucleus and increases the transcription of genes for IL-2 and related cytokines. Ciclosporin, by preventing the dephosphorylation of NF-AT, leads to reduced effector T-cell function; it does not affect cytostatic activity.

Ciclosporin also binds to the cyclophilin D protein that constitutes part of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), thus preventing MPTP opening. The MPTP is found in the mitochondrial membrane of cardiac muscle cells. MPTP opening signifies a sudden change in the inner mitochondrial membrane permeability, allowing protons and other ions and solutes of a size up to ~1.5 kDa to go through the inner membrane. This change of permeability is considered a cellular catastrophe, leading to cell death. However, brief mitochondrial permeability transition pore openings play an essential physiological role in maintaining healthy mitochondrial homeostasis.

Ciclosporin can induce a remission of proteinuria caused by such diseases as MCD and FSGS. Ciclosporin blocks the calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of synaptopodin, a regulator of Rho GTPases in podocytes, thereby preserving the phosphorylation-dependent synaptopodin-14-3-3 beta interaction. Preservation of this interaction, in turn, protects synaptopodin from cathepsin L-mediated degradation. Altogether, the antiproteinuric effect of Ciclosporin results, at least in part, from the maintenance of synaptopodin protein abundance in podocytes, which, in turn, is sufficient to maintain the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier and to safeguard against proteinuria.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===

Ciclosporin is a cyclic peptide of 11 amino acids; it contains a single -amino acid, which is rarely encountered in nature. Unlike most peptides, ciclosporin is not synthesized by ribosomes.

Ciclosporin is highly metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme in humans and animals after ingestion. The metabolites, which include cyclosporin B, C, D, E, H, and L, have less than 10% of ciclosporin&#x27;s immunosuppressant activity and are associated with higher kidney toxicity.

== Biosynthesis ==

Cyclosporin is synthesized by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, cyclosporin synthetase. The enzyme contains an adenylation domain, a thiolation domain, a condensation domain, and an N-methyltransferase domain. The adenylation domain is responsible for substrate recognition and activation, whereas the thiolation domain covalently binds the adenylated amino acids to phosphopantetheine, and the condensation domain elongates the peptide chain. Cyclosporin synthetase substrates include L-valine, L-leucine, L-alanine, glycine, 2-aminobutyric acid, 4-methylthreonine, and D-alanine, which is the starting amino acid in the biosynthetic process. With the adenylation domain, cyclosporin synthetase generates the acyl-adenylated amino acids, then covalently binds the amino acid to phosphopantetheine through a thioester linkage. Some of the amino acid substrates become N-methylated by S-adenosyl methionine. The cyclization step releases cyclosporin from the enzyme. Amino acids such as D-Ala and butenyl-methyl-L-threonine (Bmt) indicate cyclosporin synthetase requires the action of other enzymes. The racemization of L-Ala to D-Ala by alanine racemase is pyridoxal phosphate-dependent. The formation of butenyl-methyl-L-threonine is performed by a Bmt polyketide synthase that uses acetate/malonate as its starting material.

=== Gene cluster ===
&quot;Tolypocladium inflatum&quot;, the species currently used for mass production of Cyclosporin, has the biosynthetic genes arranged into a 12-gene cluster. Of these 12 genes, SimA () is the cyclosporin synthetase, SimB () is the alanine racemase, and SimG (similar to ) is the polyketide synthase. These genes are associated with an active retrotransposon. Although these sequences are poorly-annotated on GenBank and other databases, 90% similar sequences can be found for the Cyclosporin-producing &quot;Beauveria felina&quot; (or &quot;Amphichorda ~&quot;). SimB has two paralogs in the same organism with different but overlapping functions thanks to their low specificity.

== History ==

In 1970, new strains of fungi were isolated from soil samples taken from Norway and from Wisconsin in the US by employees of Sandoz (now Novartis) in Basel, Switzerland. Both strains produced a family of natural products called cyclosporins. Two related components that had antifungal activity were isolated from extracts from these fungi. The Norwegian strain, &quot;Tolypocladium inflatum Gams&quot;, was later used for the large scale fermentation of ciclosporin.

The immunosuppressive effect of the natural product ciclosporin was discovered on 31 January 1972 in a screening test on immune suppression designed and implemented by Hartmann F. Stähelin at Sandoz. The chemical structure of cyclosporin was determined in 1976, also at Sandoz. The success of the drug candidate ciclosporin in preventing organ rejection was shown in kidney transplants by R.Y. Calne and colleagues at the University of Cambridge, and in liver transplants performed by Thomas Starzl at the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Pittsburgh. The first patient, on 9 March 1980, was a 28-year-old woman. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ciclosporin for clinical use in 1983.

Thomas Starzl&#x27;s 1992 memoir explains through the eyes of a transplant surgeon that ciclosporin was an epoch-making drug for solid organ allotransplantation. It greatly expanded the clinical applicability of such transplantation by substantially advancing the antirejection pharmacotherapy component. Put simply, the biggest limits of applying such transplantation more widely were not cost or surgical skill (as formidable as those are) but rather the problem of allograft rejection and the scarcity of donor organs. Ciclopsporin was a major advancement against the rejection part of the challenge.

==Society and culture==

=== Legal status ===
In July 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Vevizye, intended for the treatment of dry eye disease. The applicant for this medicinal product is Novaliq GmbH. Vevizye was authorized for medical use in the European Union in September 2024.

=== Names ===

The natural product was named cyclosporin by the German-speaking scientists who first isolated it and cyclosporine when translated into English. Per International Nonproprietary Name (INN) guidelines for drugs, the &quot;y&quot; was replaced with &quot;i&quot; so that the INN for the medication is spelled ciclosporin.

Ciclosporin is the INN and the British Approved Name (BAN), while cyclosporine is the United States Adopted Name (USAN) and cyclosporin is a former BAN.

=== Available forms ===

Ciclosporin exhibits very poor solubility in water, and, as a consequence, suspension and emulsion forms of the medication have been developed for oral administration and for injection. Ciclosporin was originally brought to market by Sandoz (now Novartis), under the brand name Sandimmune, which is available as soft gelatin capsules, an oral solution, and a formulation for intravenous administration. These are all nonaqueous compositions. A newer microemulsion, orally-administered formulation, Neoral, is available as a solution and as soft gelatin capsules. Compositions of Neoral are designed to form microemulsions in contact with water.

Generic ciclosporin preparations have been marketed under various brand names, including Cicloral (by Sandoz/Hexal), Gengraf (by Abbott) and Deximune (by Dexcel Pharma). Since 2002, a topical emulsion of ciclosporin for treating inflammation caused by keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome) has been marketed under the brand name Restasis. Ikervis is a similar formulation with a concentration of 0.1%. Inhaled ciclosporin formulations are in clinical development, and include a solution in propylene glycol and liposome dispersions.

== Research ==

=== Neuroprotection ===

Ciclosporin is in a phase II/III (adaptive) clinical study in Europe to determine its ability to ameliorate neuronal cellular damage and reperfusion injury (phase III) in traumatic brain injury. This multi-center study is being organized by NeuroVive Pharma and the European Brain Injury Consortium using NeuroVive&#x27;s formulation of ciclosporin called Neurostat (also known by its cardioprotection brand name of Ciclomulsion). This formulation uses a lipid emulsion base instead of cremophor and ethanol. NeuroSTAT was compared to Sandimmune in a phase I study and found to be bioequivalent. In this study, NeuroSTAT did not exhibit the anaphylactic and hypersensitivity reactions found in cremophor- and ethanol-based products.

Ciclosporin has been investigated as a possible neuroprotective agent in conditions such as traumatic brain injury, and has been shown in animal experiments to reduce brain damage associated with injury. Ciclosporin blocks the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which has been found to cause much of the damage associated with head injury and neurodegenerative diseases. Ciclosporin&#x27;s neuroprotective properties were first discovered in the early 1990s when two researchers (Eskil Elmér and Hiroyuki Uchino) were conducting experiments in cell transplantation. An unintended finding was that cyclosporin A was strongly neuroprotective when it crossed the blood–brain barrier. This same process of mitochondrial destruction through the opening of the MPT pore is implicated in making traumatic brain injuries much worse.

=== Cardiac disease ===

Ciclosporin has been used experimentally to treat cardiac hypertrophy (an increase in cell volume).

Inappropriate opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) manifests in ischemia (blood flow restriction to tissue) and reperfusion injury (damage occurring after ischemia when blood flow returns to tissue), after myocardial infarction (heart attack) and when mutations in mitochondrial DNA polymerase occur. The heart attempts to compensate for disease state by increasing the intracellular to increase the contractility cycling rates. Constitutively high levels of mitochondrial cause inappropriate MPTP opening leading to a decrease in the cardiac range of function, leading to cardiac hypertrophy as an attempt to compensate for the problem.

Cyclosporin A has been shown to decrease cardiac hypertrophy by affecting cardiac myocytes in many ways. Cyclosporin A binds to cyclophilin D to block the opening of MPTP, and thus decreases the release of protein cytochrome C, which can cause programmed cell death. CypD is a protein within the MPTP that acts as a gate; binding by cyclosporin A decreases the amount of inappropriate opening of MPTP, which decreases the intramitochondrial . Decreasing intramitochondrial allows for reversal of cardiac hypertrophy caused in the original cardiac response. Decreasing the release of cytochrome C caused decreased cell death during injury and disease. Cyclosporin A also inhibits the phosphatase calcineurin pathway (14). Inhibition of this pathway has been shown to decrease myocardial hypertrophy.

== Veterinary use ==

The medication is approved in the United States for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs. Unlike the human form of the medication, the lower doses used in dogs mean the drug acts as an immunomodulator and has fewer side effects than in humans. The benefits of using this product include the reduced need for concurrent therapies to bring the condition under control. It is available as an ophthalmic ointment for dogs called Optimmune, manufactured by Intervet, which is part of Merck. It is also used to treat sebaceous adenitis (immune response against the sebaceous glands), pemphigus foliaceus (autoimmune blistering skin disease), Inflammatory bowel disease, anal furunculosis (anal inflammatory disease), and myasthenia gravis (a neuromuscular disease).

<text>The bulbuls are members of a family, Pycnonotidae, of medium-sized passerine songbirds, which also includes greenbuls, brownbuls, leafloves, and bristlebills. The family is distributed across most of Africa and into the Middle East, tropical Asia to Indonesia, and north as far as Japan. A few insular species occur on the tropical islands of the Indian Ocean. There are 166 species in 32 genera. While different species are found in a wide range of habitats, the African species are predominantly found in rainforest, whereas Asian bulbuls are predominantly found in more open areas.

==Taxonomy==
The family Pycnonotidae was introduced by the English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1840 as a subfamily Pycnonotinae of the thrush family Turdidae.

The Arabic word &quot;bulbul&quot; (بلبل) is sometimes used to refer to the &quot;nightingale&quot; as well as the bulbul, but the English word &quot;bulbul&quot; refers to the birds discussed in this article.

A few species that were previously considered to be members of the Pycnonotidae have been moved to other families. Several Malagasy species that were formerly placed in the genus &quot;Phyllastrephus&quot; are now placed in the family Bernieridae. In addition, the genus &quot;Nicator&quot; containing three African species is now placed in a separate family Nicatoridae.

A study published in 2007 by Ulf Johansson and colleagues using three nuclear markers found that the genus &quot;Andropadus&quot; was non-monophyletic. In the subsequent revision, species were moved to three resurrected genera: &quot;Arizelocichla&quot;, &quot;Stelgidillas&quot; and &quot;Eurillas&quot;. Only the sombre greenbul (&quot;Andropadus importunus&quot;), was retained in &quot;Andropadus&quot;. A study by Subir Shakya and Frederick Shelden published in 2017 found that species in the large genus &quot; Pycnonotus&quot; formed several deeply divergent clades. The genus was split and six genera were resurrected to accommodate these clades.

The family forms two main clades. One clade contains species that are only found in Africa; many of these have greenbul in the common name. The second clade contains mostly Asian species but includes a few species that are found in Africa.

===List of genera===

Currently, there are 167 recognized species in 32 genera:

* Genus &quot;Andropadus&quot; – sombre greenbul (formerly contained many species)

* Genus &quot;Euptilotus&quot; – puff-backed bulbul (formerly in &quot;Pycnonotus&quot;)
* Genus &quot;Microtarsus&quot; – black-and-white bulbul (formerly in &quot;Pycnonotus&quot;)
* Genus &quot;Poliolophus &quot; – yellow-wattled bulbul (formerly in &quot;Pycnonotus&quot;)

* Genus &quot;Pycnonotus&quot; – 34 species (substantially reduced from earlier classification)

===Cladogram===
==Description==
Bulbuls are short-necked slender passerines. The tails are long and the wings short and rounded. In almost all species the bill is slightly elongated and slightly hooked at the end. They vary in length from 13 cm and for the tiny greenbul to 29 cm and in the straw-headed bulbul. Overall the sexes are alike, although the females tend to be slightly smaller. In a few species the differences are so great that they have been described as functionally different species. The soft plumage of some species is colorful with yellow, red or orange vents, cheeks, throat or supercilia, but most are drab, with uniform olive-brown to black plumage. Species with dull coloured eyes often sport contrasting eyerings. Some have very distinct crests. Bulbuls are highly vocal, with the calls of most species being described as nasal or gravelly. One author described the song of the brown-eared bulbul as &quot;one of the most unattractive noises made by any bird&quot;.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
The bulbuls are generally monogamous. One unusual exception is the yellow-whiskered greenbul which at least over part of its range appears to be polygamous and engage in a lekking system. Some species also have alloparenting arrangements, where non-breeders, usually the young from earlier clutches, help raise the young of a dominant breeding pair. Up to five speckled eggs are laid in open tree nests and incubated by the female. Incubation usually lasts between 11 and 14 days, and chicks fledge after 12–16 days.

===Feeding===
Bulbuls eat a wide range of foods, ranging from fruit to seeds, nectar, small insects and other arthropods and even small vertebrates. The majority of species are frugivorous and supplement their diet with some insects, although there is a significant minority of specialists, particularly in Africa. Open country species in particular are generalists. Bulbuls in the genus &quot;Criniger&quot; and bristlebills in the genus &quot;Bleda&quot; will join mixed-species feeding flocks.

==Relationship to humans==
The red-whiskered bulbuls and red-vented bulbuls have been captured for the pet trade in great numbers and have been widely introduced to tropical and subtropical areas, for example, southern Florida, Fiji, Australia and Hawaii. Some species are regarded as crop pests, particularly in orchards.

In general, bulbuls and greenbuls are resistant to human pressures on the environment and are tolerant of disturbed habitat. Around 13 species are considered threatened by human activities, mostly specialised forest species that are threatened by habitat loss.

<text>Shelley is a given name and surname. In many baby name books, &quot;Shelley&quot; is listed as meaning &#x27;meadow&#x27;s edge&#x27; or &#x27;clearing on a bank&#x27;. It is Old English in origin. As with many other names (Courtney, Ashley, etc.), Shelley is today a name given almost exclusively to girls after historically being male. It is commonly used as a nickname for &quot;Michelle&quot; (and formerly as a variant of &quot;Shirley&quot;). Shelley is also a transferred surname used by those in Essex, Suffolk and Yorkshire, particularly in settlements where a wood/clearing was beside a ledge or hillside. &quot;Shelly&quot; is a common alternative spelling. It is featured in tile on the ceiling of the Library of Congress in Washington D.C.

<text>Shibden is a small dispersed community in Calderdale, West Yorkshire, England. Shibden Hall has a north-west driveway to its lake, café and miniature railway; an adjoining driveway runs up a landscaped garden to the hall which hosts the West Yorkshire Folk Museum. The land sits on a north–south rise (gentle escarpment) between deep brooks, shared with more populous Southowram to the south.

==History==
===Name and economy===
The name of this valley and village is a simplification and Great Vowel Shift sound shift from &quot;s(h)cep(e) den(e)&quot; (sheep dene). A brief mention in Edward III of England&#x27;s Calendar of Close Rolls has the place as &quot;Shipen&quot;. It has, as manorial records equally attest, long been farmed. In the many centuries of the main English wool trade the manor prospered from wool production, with incident (largely subsistence) crop farming and offshoot lamb and mutton meat produce.

Halifax&#x27;s own, chief, highly skilled manufacture of wool products began in 1414 ascribed to the settlement of certain emigrants from the Spanish Netherlands, who sought refuge from the persecutions under the government of the Duke of Alva. At this time there were about 13 houses in Halifax, but it soon began to increase in extent and population; in 1540 it contained 520 houses, and it has progressively advanced to its 18th century and early 19th century level of importance, as one of the main global sites of woollen manufacture (woollen-cloths, kerseymeres, shags, coatings, baizes, carpets, shalloons, tammies, corduroys, calimancoes, everlastings, moreens, crapes, bombasines, and damasks).

Under the manor park passes an early 19th century-built regular line rail tunnel. At a similar time parts of the wider manorial land were dug for underlying coal seams, which after some stealing from the owner were successfully tapped by contractors appointed by landowner, entrepreneur and private diarist Anne Lister (1791–1841) of Shibden Hall, after whom a local nickname of the time &quot;Gentleman Jack&quot; arose. Then in the 21st century a prominent book and a BBC six-part drama (&quot;Gentleman Jack&quot;) of that name were made, after an earlier two-part drama featuring Maxine Peake (&quot;The Secret Diaries of Miss Anne Lister&quot;), with associated modern folk song.

In 1600 a house with lands straddling Northowram and Shibden passed from Richard Northend to his kinsmen of the same surname (with usual fines being paid to the Crown).

Ecclesiastically in the Church of England it remains an eastern manor (with hamlet) in parishes of Halifax, which Minster church is the place of worship for the northern corners of the park and few adjoining buildings, including petrol service station which proliferate beyond Shibden Brook to the east, but which marks the western limit of Northowram (but not of Southowram to the south, being on the Shibden side of that powerful brook). Most of the buildings are today in the Halifax daughter parish of St Anne-in-the-Grove, Halifax, the church of which is in Southowram. The brook has been dammed and tapped much further north for a reservoir.

===Local government===
The land was part of the County Borough of Halifax (formed 1889) until its 1974 abolition.

==Landmarks==
Scout Hall, a subinfeudated manor house, was built in 1681. Shibden Hall, the parent manor house, was built in the 15th century. The Hall hosts the West Yorkshire Folk Museum and has a lakeside café and miniature railway.

<text>Shipley is a historic market town and civil parish in the City of Bradford, West Yorkshire, England.

Located on the River Aire and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, Shipley is directly north of the city of Bradford. The population of Shipley at the 2011 Census was 15,483.

Until 1974, Shipley was an urban district in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The town forms a continuous urban area with Bradford.

== History ==

===Toponymy===

The place-name &quot;Shipley&quot; derives from two words: the Old English (&#x27;sheep&#x27;, a Northumbrian dialect form, contrasting with the Anglian dialect form which underlies modern English &quot;sheep&quot;) and meaning either &#x27;a forest, wood, glade, clearing&#x27; or, later, &#x27;a pasture, meadow&#x27;. It has therefore been variously defined as &#x27;forest clearing used for sheep&#x27; or &#x27;sheep field&#x27;.

===Early history===

Shipley appears to have first been settled in the late Bronze Age and is mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086, in the form .

Its early history relies on the records of a succession of Lords of the Manor, not all of whom were in permanent residence. The rolls of the manor court have been missing since the 18th century, leaving the records incomplete. In the 12th century, &#x27;Adam, son of Peter&#x27;, an early Lord of the Manor, granted grazing and iron ore mining rights to the monks of Rievaulx Abbey. Through the Middle Ages the Lords were the &#x27;Earls of Ormande&#x27; (sic), possibly the Irish Earls of Ormond, followed by the Gascoigne family. In 1495, Rosamund Gascoigne, a daughter of one of the William Gascoignes who held the title, married Robert Rawson, thought to be related to the Rawson family of Bradford, after whom one of the city&#x27;s markets is named. Their son, William, married a cousin, Agnes Gascoigne, and through the marriage the Rawson family inherited the manor in 1570.

The Rawsons lived at Over Hall known as the Manor House, on the site of the current town hall. The manor estates extended to Northcliff, to the south of Shipley. The family had interests in Halifax and moved there in the early 18th century, retaining their Shipley estates until the last male heir died in 1745.

By the 19th century the Rawson estates and those of the Fields, another prominent land-owning family, had become the property of the Earl of Rosse who had extensive holdings in Heaton. His legacy has endured in the name of a public house on the main Bradford to Keighley road, and Rossefield School in Heaton. Of the lower orders at this time not much is known, but there was relief housing offered at the town&#x27;s expense near Crowghyll.

===Industrial Revolution===

Shipley was shaped largely by the Industrial Revolution and, in particular, the growth of the textile industry. Textile manufacture dates from pre-industrial times. As the place name indicates, Shipley had a history as sheep grazing land, so wool was plentiful, and the River Aire was a ready source of water for powering water mills and cleaning processes. There was a fulling mill in Shipley by 1500 and two more by 1559. Another mill was built by the Dixon family on the banks of the Aire in 1635. New Mill on the far side of Hirst Wood was built in the 1740s and by the late 18th century between 9,000 and 10,000 pieces of broadcloth were being fulled annually at Shipley&#x27;s mills. Much work was undertaken in workers&#x27; cottages which had &#x27;loom shops&#x27; for spinning yarn. Home workshops were once a common sight along the River Aire and often had external flights of steps. Examples can be seen in the cottages at Jane Hills along the canal in Saltaire.

The industrial era ended cottage industry. Providence Mill, one of the first steam-driven mills was built for Denby Bros. in 1796. Other spinning mills followed, including Ashley Mill, Prospect Mill, Red Beck Mill on Heaton Beck (c. 1815), Well Croft Mill (c. 1840s) and Whiting Mill on Briggate.

The smaller mills gave way to larger premises which could combine all the processes of worsted production on one site. The first was Joseph Hargreaves&#x27; Airedale Mills (demolished 1970s), Salts Mill (built 1853 and now a gallery and restaurant complex), an enlarged Well Croft Mill (demolished 1950s) and Victoria Mills near the canal... Hargreaves employed 1,250, Salt initially 2,500 and by 1876 total employment in the mills was 6,900.

The growth in textile production stimulated the growth of associated supply industries. Other local employers included loom makers, Lee and Crabtree, WP Butterfield&#x27;s galvanised containers and J. Parkinson and Sons machine tool makers.

The other major effect of industrialisation was the vast expansion in housing stock. Titus Salt&#x27;s Saltaire is an example of a model village, and Hargreaves had cottages built for his workers around the town centre and his mill. He built 92 back-to-back houses along Market Street and Central Avenue in an area which came to be called &quot;Hargreaves Square&quot; or &quot;The Square&quot;. The houses were built by filling in the old courtyards. The population of the township grew from 1,214 in 1822 to just over 3,000 in 1851 to 10,000 by 1869.

It was then the landowning families—the Rosses, the Crompton-Stansfields and the Wainmans—took advantage of the demand for housing by selling their less productive land on Low Moor and High Moor. Houses for the better off were built in Sunny Bank and Hall Royd in the 1840s, 1850s and 1860s. Kirkgate was lined with villas from the 1860s, some of which still stand. Middle-class houses were built in the Nab Wood and Moorhead districts In 1870 a tranche of land in Moorhead was sold by the Countess of Rosse to build five streets of terraces. The public house on Saltaire roundabout that bears her name dates from that time.

===Post-war redevelopment===
The decline of the textile industry saw the demolition of many mills, only Salts Mill and Victoria Mills remain and have been converted to other uses.

Of more concern in the immediate post-war period was the deteriorating housing stock. In the 1950s, the back-to-backs of Hargreaves Square were condemned as slums and the site redeveloped. The redevelopment removed several historic buildings – Shipley Old Hall (1593), at the junction of Kirkgate and Manor Lane and of which a few fragments of roof drainage and a roof truss survive in Crowgill Park (formerly Crowghyll Park), Shipley Hall (1734), which stood at the junction of Market Street and Otley Road became the headquarters of Windhill Cooperative Society and possibly Hudson Fold House (1629). Of the major Victorian town centre buildings, only the Old Bradford Bank (now Barclays) and Sun Hotel remain. The slums were replaced with low-rise modern retail outlets, a central square serves as an outdoor market and an underground indoor market is situated beneath a tall, brutalist market hall tower which is a visible landmark for many miles around. Until recently the tower had a &#x27;man&#x27; striking a bell to mark the hours.

A second phase of clearance in 1978 saw the construction of a library, swimming pool and health centre, with Asda added in 1985. Croft House (1729), a stone built farmhouse which was converted to a school and then subsequently used as the Labour Party headquarters, was a casualty of this development. By 1970 2,900 slum houses had been demolished.

The Otley and Leeds Roads were widened in the early 1970s, at the expense of the Fox and Hounds Hotel after which Shipley&#x27;s main road junction, Fox Corner, was named.

==Geography==

Shipley is located at an important crossing of the River Aire, where the route from Otley to Bradford crosses the route from Skipton to Leeds. It is sheltered by the millstone crags of Wrose and Windhill to the east, and to the north by Baildon and Hawksworth Moors.

Early development in Shipley was centred on the crossroads, locally known today as Fox Corner after the former Fox and Hounds pub that stood there. Here, as today, the route from Otley to Bradford crossed the route from Skipton to Leeds at an important crossing of the River Aire. The present Kirkgate and Manor Lane (then known as Sower Lane) were probably no more than tracks.

In medieval times, Shipley consisted of the settlement around the crossroads, and the unenclosed fields at Shipley Fields and the Hirst which were collectively farmed. Beyond these lay the Low Moor, which ran from the Crowghyll to the former Saltaire roundabout (now a junction on the Bradford to Keighley road), in the approximate area of modern day Wycliffe, and the wasteland of High Moor (from Saltaire roundabout, through Moorhead, as far as New Brighton and Noon Nick). These areas were steep, rocky land, unsuitable for farming. By 1600 at the latest, the open fields had been enclosed and given way to individual farms. The town was bounded to the north by the River Aire, to the east by Bradford Beck, with Cottingley and Heaton lying beyond its western and southern boundaries.

Outlying districts, such as Windhill, were not part of Shipley until the 19th century. Saltaire became part of Shipley after its foundation in the 1860s, while Windhill, which had previously been part of Idle, became part of the Shipley Urban District in 1894.

==Governance==
Shipley was historically a township and chapelry in the large ancient parish of Bradford. Shipley Local Board was formed in 1853. Originally the board met at the Sun Hotel near the market. In 1880, it moved to the old Manor House, until it was demolished in 1915. Shipley became a separate civil parish in 1866. In 1894, Shipley Urban District Council was constituted with 15 councillors, and Shipley incorporated the Windhill district, formerly part of Idle. An attempt was made to gain borough status in 1898, but failed. Shipley Town Hall was built in 1932, as part of a scheme to relieve high unemployment during the Great Depression and was opened by the Earl of Harewood. It became the seat of Shipley&#x27;s administration for the next four decades.

For many years, Shipley opposed joining Bradford for local government purposes whenever it was proposed. A large protest march marked the third attempt in 1937. In 1974 after local government reorganisation, merger into Bradford seemed inevitable, and no resistance was offered.

The Shipley parliamentary constituency was created in 1885, and its first MP was Joseph Craven.

A campaign for Shipley to have a Town Council was launched in 2018, resulting in the creation of Shipley Town Council in January 2020.

===Commercial and retail===

Shipley is dominantly residential in character serving as a commuter suburb of larger urban employment centres in Bradford and Leeds. Manufacturing activity includes information technology specialist ARRIS located in the Salts Mill complex. Marlin Windows, HC Slingsby and the offices of the Bradford Health Authority also feature among the larger employers in the town.

The town has one large scale supermarket, Asda in the town centre, but also supports smaller scale supermarkets and convenience shops. An open air market is a feature of the main commercial centre of the town as well as a covered market hall known for its landmark clock tower and 1960s brutalist architecture. Other shops in the same precinct include an Arndale Centre, retailers such as Boots. A pedestrian precinct with some shops and leisure businesses links Asda and its multi-storey free car park with Market Square. This area also includes the Shipley Library and the Kirkgate Centre, the town&#x27;s main cultural focus offering regular a range of community activities in addition to holding cultural events such as live music, a regular alternative market and world cinema.

The town&#x27;s secondary commercial centre, Gordon Terrace, part of the historic Saltaire Village development, features independent food and fashion retailers, as well as numerous restaurants and cafes. The town has a large volume of through vehicle traffic as it is on two of the main routes between Bradford, Leeds and the Aire Valley towns of Bingley, Keighley, and Skipton.

===Visitor attractions===
The village of Saltaire located in Shipley is a UNESCO designated World Heritage Site incorporating the Victorian era Salts Mill and associated residential district. Located by the River Aire and Leeds and Liverpool Canal the model village was planned by industrialist Sir Titus Salt as a processing facility for alpaca woollen cloth and as residential accommodation for his workforce. Salts Mill is no longer used for textile production, but now contains the 1853 Gallery, housing many works by the artist David Hockney, a variety of shops, restaurants and local businesses, including Pace Micro Technology (now Arris). Salts Mill is accessed via the nearby Saltaire railway station and together with the stone built terraced houses, ornate Victorian era civic buildings and Roberts Park, draws significant numbers of tourists to the area.

To the north across the River Aire, is Shipley Glen (&quot;glen&quot; refers to the little valley beneath a ridge). It has long been a popular beauty spot, and in 1895 the Shipley Glen Tramway was built to carry visitors up to the top. The tramway has weathered periods of neglect and closure, but in 2012 it ran most weekends through the summer, staffed by volunteers.
===Parks and gardens===

Crowghyll Park was once a quarry and the town&#x27;s refuse dump. The land was given to church wardens in lieu of common rights when Shipley Common was enclosed and in 1889 it was landscaped. A public playground was opened by Mrs Titus Salt in 1890. A larger recreation area with playing fields, allotments, woods, and a private golf club is situated on the hill at Northcliffe. The woods and playing fields were opened to the public by Norman Rae MP and the playing fields are named after him. In the village of Saltaire is Roberts Park, built by Sir Titus Salt for his workers&#x27; recreation.

===Theatre and cinema===

The Victoria Hall in Saltaire is a concert venue, hosting bands such as Fairport Convention. However, there were once a number of entertainment establishments within the district:
* &quot;Queen&#x27;s Palace&quot; – Formerly a temperance coffee house, an institution called Queens&#x27; Palace Theatre was sited on Briggate around the turn of the 20th century. It held twice nightly variety shows at 7 pm and 9 pm. In December 1915 it became Shipley Picture House and remained as a cinema until August 1932. The building was demolished following a fire in 1960.
* &quot;Glen Royal&quot; – The same fate met its successor, the Glen Royal Cinema, which was sited slightly further along Briggate. This 1,200 seat &quot;showpiece super-cinema&quot; opened with a showing of Emma on 5 September 1932 and was Shipley&#x27;s premier cinema during the Golden Age of Hollywood. A Hammond organ was installed in 1936 and it became the first cinema in the area after the Ritz in Bradford to show 3D film. In 1963 it followed the path of many former cinemas, by becoming a casino and bingo hall, and later part of it became a snooker club. In time, it became derelict, before being destroyed by fire like its predecessor in 2013.
* &quot;Saltaire Picture House&quot; – Saltaire Picture House was on a site opposite the Old Tramshed and opened in 1922, seated 1,500. It later became the Gaumont. The cinema closed in 1957 and the building was demolished soon after.
* &quot;Pavilion&quot; – The Pavilion Cinema or Pavilion de Luxe on Commercial Street was built in 1912 and known as the &#x27;Bug Ole&#x27; or &#x27;Bug Run&#x27;. It opened on 2 April 1914. The small seating capacity, 630, gave rise to the motto &#x27;the little theatre with the big reputation&#x27;. It closed in November 1956.
* &quot;Prince&#x27;s Hall&quot; – Prince&#x27;s Hall Cinema opened on 24 June 1911 and like the rest of Shipley&#x27;s cinemas had an organ. It survived for many years, called Unit Four, with half the capacity of the old Prince&#x27;s Hall It was the last remaining cinema in Shipley until it closed at the turn of the 21st century.

Shipley Film Society was established in 2010 to bring cinema back to Shipley, and runs a programme of independent and world cinema between September and May each year.

===Libraries===

The library on Well Croft in the town centre is a branch library of Bradford Central Library. A Carnegie Library on Briggate built with a £3,000 donation by Andrew Carnegie now stands empty but the name persists in Carnegie Drive and the Carnegie Clinic.

===Industry===
Shipley used to house the Naylor Cars, Ltd., that produced the Naylor TF 1700, an MG TF replica.
Industrial businesses with a presence in Shipley include Denso Marsten, Manor Coatings, Produmax, Teledyne and HC Slingsby.

==Religion==
Traditionally, non-conformist churches have predominated in Shipley and this is still the case to some extent today. There are four Methodist churches, which feature Victorian architecture. These are: Northcliffe on the site of a &#x27;tin chapel&#x27;, Crag Road, Saltaire and Christ Church at Windhill. Saltaire United Reformed Church was built in the Italianate style at the behest of Sir Titus Salt in 1859. It is a Grade I listed building.

The first place of worship in Shipley was the Bethel Baptist Chapel in 1758, it was rebuilt in 1836 and demolished in the early 1970s and only part of the graveyard survives. A second Baptist chapel was built at Rosse Street near the town centre in 1865 and is still in use. There is a Victorian Salvation Army Citadel on Rhodes Place.

Historically, Shipley was part of the parish of Bradford and did not have a church until well into the 19th century. The first Anglican church was the Gothic St Paul&#x27;s on Kirkgate, consecrated by Edward Harcourt, Archbishop of York in 1826. It was built at a cost of £7,687.19s.3d, a gift of the nation under the Million Act, on land donated by John Wilmer Field, from the Shipley land-owning family. The parish of Shipley cum Heaton was created on 30 May 1828 by an order in council of King George IV. St Paul&#x27;s is one of an identical pair of churches with Wilsden Church. A graveyard was added in 1860, but by 1895 this was full and additional land at Hirst Wood was consecrated. The church seated 1,488 and has an organ built by Binns of Bramley in 1892.

Other Anglican churches in the town are St Margaret&#x27;s, Frizinghall and St Peter&#x27;s in Moorhead Lane. The later was commissioned in 1888 as a daughter church for St Paul&#x27;s and consecrated in 1909 by the Bishop of Ripon. The Roman Catholic Church of St Theresa Benedicta and St Walburga, usually referred to as St Walburga&#x27;s is situated on Kirkgate.

== Transport ==

===Road===

The Bradford to Bingley Road was constructed in the 1820s and with Otley Road and Saltaire Road form a triangle framing Shipley centre. They connect the town to Bradford, Leeds and the Airedale towns. In September 2022, a clean air zone was launched in Bradford and Shipley. This means any non-private cars entering the city centre and the Canal Road corridor towards Shipley, will be charged dependent on the size of the vehicle and the commercial reason for entering. Exemptions apply for greener vehicles such as low-emission or electric.

There is a small bus station in Shipley Market Place.

===Rail===

The Midland Railway&#x27;s Leeds and Bradford line opened on 2 July 1846 and was extended to Keighley by March 1847. The Guiseley branch opened on 4 December 1876 and in the same year completion of the Settle-Carlisle Line put Shipley on the London to Scotland route. In 1885, the old Midland Railway station was replaced, and by 1900, 400 trains were passing through Shipley each month, carrying 50,000 passengers.

Shipley railway station has an unusual triangular layout, serving trains on the Skipton to Leeds line, the Leeds to Bradford Forster Square line, and the Bradford to Skipton/Ilkley lines. Saltaire railway station, reopened in 1984 on the Settle-Carlisle Line, serves the heritage village of Saltaire. Long-distance trains run south to London King&#x27;s Cross and north to Carlisle, while local trains connect the town with Leeds, Bradford and Skipton.

===Canals===

The Leeds and Liverpool Canal was once an important navigation linking Shipley to the wider world. The Skipton to Shipley section was completed in 1773 and in 1774 a branch was extended to Bradford. Wharves were established on the north side of Briggate. The Bradford branch was filled in during the 1920s. The canal is used for pleasure cruising.

===Trams===

Trams ran along Bradford Road to the south and Saltaire Road to the north and between Baildon Bridge and the Branch. The intersection of these lines led to the main road junction of Fox&#x27;s Corner being given the alternative name of &quot;Cobweb Square&quot;. The legacy of trams is the terminal building on Saltaire Roundabout, now a public house named &quot;Salt Bar &amp; Kitchen&quot;. There was a second tram shed off the roundabout at the foot of Moorhead Lane.

Saltaire shed was converted for trolleybuses in 1939 until Bradford scrapped trolleybuses in the 1970s.

==Newspapers==

The town&#x27;s first newspaper was the &quot;Shipley Times &amp; Express&quot; run by stationer and printer, Johnny Walker. The paper was based in premises at Shipley crossroads, and the junction was sometimes called Johnny Walker&#x27;s Corner as well as Fox Corner. In 1922, Walker sold out to printer/stationer, Osbaldiston, and the building still stands under his name. The building is now a scuba diving centre called Duck and Dive. The paper closed in 1981.

Shipley is in the distribution area of the Bradford-based &quot;Telegraph &amp; Argus&quot;. The &quot;Telegraph &amp; Argus&quot; produced a free newspaper for the district, the &quot;Aire Valley (or Shipley) Target&quot;, which was then produced as one of four local editions of the &quot;Bradford &amp; District Advertiser&quot;. This no longer prints.

The Saltaire Review was launched by Festival Publications in October 2014. It is published bi-monthly and covers community issues and events, with an estimated readership of over 18,000.

<text>Slaithwaite ( , ; Old Norse for &quot;timber-fell thwaite/clearing&quot;) is a town in the Kirklees district of West Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is in the Colne Valley and on the Huddersfield Narrow Canal, south-west of Huddersfield.

==History==
Between 1195 and 1205, Roger de Laci, Constable of Chester, gave the manor of Slaithwaite to Henry Teutonicus (Lord Tyas). It remained in the Tyas family until the end of the 14th century when it came into the Kaye family. It eventually joined the estates of the Earl of Dartmouth, a descendant of the Kayes, and was part of the upper division of the wapentake of Agbrigg. It included the township of &quot;Lingarths&quot; (Lingards) and constituted the Chapelry of Slaithwaite, in the Patronage of the Vicar of Huddersfield.

In the early 19th century, a local spring was discovered to contain sulphurous properties and minerals, similar to those found in Harrogate. Sometime after 1820 a bathing facility was built, along with a gardens and pleasure ground, with some visitor cottages. A free school was founded in 1721 and rebuilt twice: first in 1744, and again in 1842.

In the 1848 edition of &quot;A Topographical Dictionary of England&quot;, Samuel Lewis (the editor) wrote:
&quot;the lands are in meadow and pasture, with a small portion of arable; the scenery is bold and romantic. In the quarries of the district are found vegetable fossils, especially firs and other mountain trees. The town is beautifully seated in the valley of the river Colne; the inhabitants are mostly employed in the woollen manufacture, in the spinning of cotton and silk, and in silk-weaving&quot;

Slaithwaite Hall, (dated by dendrochronology to 1452), is located on a nearby hillside. It is one of a number of cruck-framed buildings clustered in this area of West Yorkshire. After many years divided into cottages, the building has been extensively restored and is now a single dwelling.

Legend has it that local smugglers caught by the excise men tried to explain their nocturnal activities as &#x27;raking the moon from the canal&#x27; and definitely not as &#x27;fishing out smuggled brandy&#x27;. A &quot;Moonraker&quot; is now the nickname for a native of the town. There are similar stories and nicknames for the neighbouring settlements of Golcar (&quot;Lillies&quot;), Marsden (&quot;Cuckoos&quot;) and Linthwaite (&quot;Leadboilers&quot;). The legend is also known in Wiltshire, where the locals are also known as &#x27;Moonrakers&#x27;.

Slaithwaite Town Hall in Lewisham Road served as the municipal headquarters of successive local authorities in the area until the abolition of Colne Valley Urban District Council in 1974.

=== Civil parish ===
Slaithwaite was formerly a township and chapelry. From 1866, Slaithwaite was a civil parish in its own right. On 1 April 1937, the parish was abolished to form Colne Valley. In 1931, the parish had a population of 5,183.

==Economy==
Recent projects have seen a major restoration of the canal. That required a full re-excavation and new lock gates. Following the emergence of the railway network they were little used and closed down then filled in during 1956.

There are several significant local employers, including Thornton &amp; Ross (a pharmaceuticals manufacturer), Shaw Pallets and Spectrum Yarns – one of a small number of remaining textiles businesses in the Colne Valley, once a major centre for wool and yarn.

==Churches==
The church of St James in Slaithwaite is the Anglican parish church; it is grouped with St Bartholomew&#x27;s in Marsden and the mission church at Shred. The present church stands on high ground and was constructed c. 1789 to replace the original church which had suffered from flooding. There is also a Methodist church.

==Commerce==

There are many independent shops, a post office, cafes in the centre of Slaithwaite. Shops include the community-owned cooperative the &#x27;Green Valley Grocer&#x27;, the workers&#x27; cooperative the &#x27;Handmade Bakery,&#x27; and the Mystical Moments &#x27;magic wand shop&#x27;.

There are several traditional public houses in Slaithwaite, including the &#x27;Silent Woman&#x27; which came to the attention of the world media on 23 September 2007, when Christopher Hawkins walked into the pub and ordered a pint of beer a few minutes after he had murdered his son and attacked his daughter with a knife. The town is included as one of the stops in the Transpennine Real Ale Trail.

==Transport==

There are direct trains to Huddersfield and Manchester from Slaithwaite railway station. The Colne Valley defines local geography by channelling the railway line, the canal and the A62: each of which has at one time been the primary means of transport across the Pennines. The small humpback bridge over the canal is called &#x27;Tim Brig&#x27;; it is said to be named after a local innkeeper who used the bridge during smuggling operations with the narrowboats passing through.

There are bus links from Slaithwaite to several places in the Huddersfield area. Services run by First West Yorkshire and First Manchester go from Slaithwaite to Marsden, Oldham and Manchester and to Huddersfield. Other bus services are to Holmfirth, Blackmoorfoot and surrounding villages.

==Culture==
In February, on alternate years, Slaithwaite celebrates a 19th-century legend of Moonraking with the Slaithwaite Moonraking Festival, with a week of lantern making and a programme of storytelling. The week-long celebration, which always takes place during the school half term week, ends with a parade of lanterns around the town, and a festival finale by the canal in the centre of the town. A heritage lottery funded project &#x27;Wild about Wool&#x27;, that is collating memories of the industrial heritage of the Colne Valley, is linked to the festival. &#x27;Wool&#x27; was also the theme of the festival held in February 2011.

Slaithwaite is also home to the annual &amp;Piano Music Festival, a classical chamber music festival started in 2018, that focuses on showcasing professional musicians with a connection to the North of England.

The Slaithwaite Philharmonic Orchestra was founded here in 1891. An 80-strong amateur orchestra, the orchestra also plays an annual season of concerts in Huddersfield.

Slaithwaite Brass Band have been making music here since 1892. They perform at many concerts and events throughout the year and have had many successes over the years including being the first band to gain the Grand Shield twice.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes is provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Emley Moor TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter situated west of the town. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Leeds on 92.4 FM, Heart Yorkshire on 106.2 FM, Capital Yorkshire on 105.1 FM, Hits Radio West Yorkshire on 102.5 FM and Greatest Hits Radio West Yorkshire on 96.3 FM. 

The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Huddersfield Daily Examiner&quot;.

==Sport==
Cricket is popular in the town. Slaithwaite Cricket &amp; Bowling Club, situated on Hill Top, during the summer becomes the heart of the community. It is a thriving club with many successful teams including winning Second XI Premiership Championship in the 2010 season. The town also has its own running club named Slaithwaite Striders, which has a mixture of all abilities, meeting weekly to run and enjoy the surrounding roads, paths and of course the views.

<text>Sowerby Bridge ( ) is a market town in the Upper Calder Valley in Calderdale in West Yorkshire, England. The Calderdale Council ward population at the 2011 census was 11,703.

==History==

The town was originally a fording point over the once much-wider River Calder where it is joined by the River Ryburn. The town takes its name from the historic bridge which spans the river in the town centre. Before the Industrial Revolution the area was divided between the parishes of Sowerby, Norland, Skircoat and Warley. The boundaries between them being the rivers Calder and Ryburn and Warley Clough, which is now largely culverted. Textiles and engineering industry grew up around the bridge. Sowerby Bridge Town Hall, which accommodated the offices of the local board, was completed in 1857.
===19th century ===
The Anglican parish church, Christ Church, situated on Wharf Street, is a Grade II listed building. It was built in 1819 by John Oates. The chancel was rebuilt in 1873–74 and the church was re-roofed 1894. The church is still active and the vicar is Revd. Tommy Daglish. The church&#x27;s first organ was installed in 1825 and replaced in 1865. The organ and much of the church was destroyed in a 1894 fire. A larger organ, built by Abbott and Smith, was installed, and next repaired in 1979. The current organ was installed in 1983, moved from a nearby closed church.

By the mid-19th century the population had grown and the settlement became an urban district in the West Riding of Yorkshire in 1894.

===20th century ===
From 1892 to 1930 Pollit &amp; Wigzell manufactured stationary steam engines for the cotton and woollen mills of Yorkshire, Lancashire and India. Wood Brothers, an engineering and millwright company, also produced engines from its Valley Iron Works. The Markfield Beam Engine in north London is an example of its work.
===21st century ===
In January 2019, it was announced that the council buildings on Hollins Mill Lane, which include the former offices of Sowerby Bridge Urban District Council, the old swimming pool and old fire station will be transferred to a community group, Sowerby Bridge Fire and Water, and will be renovated for community use.

==Governance==
The town is part of the Sowerby Bridge ward of the Metropolitan borough of Calderdale, in West Yorkshire.

<text>Stanbury is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Haworth and Stanbury, in the metropolitan borough of the City of Bradford in West Yorkshire, England. In 1931 the parish had a population of 453.
The name Stanbury translates as &quot;Stone Fort&quot; from Old English.

== Geography ==

The village is situated approximately west from Haworth, south-west from Keighley, and east from Colne in Lancashire. Less than half a mile north-east is the hamlet of Lumbfoot.
Stanbury is Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire. The River Worth is immediately north of the village and Sladen Beck is just to the south.
Two paths pass through the village; The Brontë Way and The Pennine way.

== Landmarks ==

The surrounding countryside is mainly moors and farmland. Ponden Reservoir was built in the 1870s and a reservoir was approved to be built at Lower Laithe on Sladen Beck in 1869, but it was not started until 1911.
Due to the nation being involved in the First World War, the reservoir was not completed until 1925.
Its completion necessitated the abandonment of the hamlet of Smith Bank.
The village is close to the Brontë Waterfall and Top Withens tourist landmarks.
Emily Brontë is reputed to have used Top Withens as the model for the location of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, and nearby Ponden Hall (half a mile from the edge of Stanbury) has been considered the model for &#x27;Thrushcross Grange&#x27; in the same book.
It has also been theorized that Ponden Hall is actually the setting for Top Withens as its size is smaller than that of Thrushcross Grange as described in the book.
There are also additional theories that the hall is the model for Wildfell Hall in Anne Brontë&#x27;s The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.
There is an Anglican church in Stanbury built in 1848. In 1998, it was named St Gabriels, after spending the previous 150 years without a name. The school caters for primary school age children.
There are two public houses: The Friendly and the Wuthering Heights which dates from 1763 and was formerly and locally known as &#x27;The Cross&#x27;.
The Old Silent Inn (formerly The Eagle) is a public house and guest house close to the village which is over 400 years old.

== Governance ==
Stanbury became a civil parish on 31 December 1894 being formed from part of Haworth, on 1 April 1938 the parish was abolished and merged with Keighley.

It borders (clockwise from the North) the Dutch province of Zeeland and the Flemish province of Antwerp, Flemish Brabant, Hainaut and West Flanders. It has an area of , divided into six administrative districts containing 60 municipalities, and a population of over 1.57 million as of January 2024. The capital is Ghent, home to the Ghent University and the Port of Ghent.

== History ==
During the short-lived Napoleonic Empire, most of the area of the modern province was part of the Department of Escaut, named after the River Scheldt. Following the defeat of Napoleon, the entity was renamed after its geographical location in the eastern part of the historic County of Flanders (now in the western portion of the current Flemish Region).

The provincial flag has a black lion with red tongue and claws, on a background of horizontal white and green stripes. This is a recent adaptation; formerly, East Flanders used the Flemish flag, a black lion on a yellow background, as in the current coat of arms. The old flag is still publicly used, e.g. for road signs.

== Geography ==
The province has several geographic or tourist regions:
* Denderstreek
* Meetjesland
* Waasland
* Flemish Ardennes

Important rivers are the Scheldt and the Leie which merge in Ghent. The Dender merges into the Scheldt in the city of Dendermonde.

=== Subdivisions ===
East Flanders is divided into 6 administrative arrondissements (districts), subdivided into a total of 60 municipalities. In addition, there are 3 judicial and 3 electoral arrondissements.

The capital and biggest city is Ghent, also the second largest city in the Flemish Region. Other smaller cities are Aalst, Sint-Niklaas and Dendermonde in the east of the province. The eastern part of the province, part of the Flemish Diamond, is more densely populated than the western part.

== Economy ==
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 56.4 billion € in 2018. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 33,000 € or 109% of the EU27 average in the same year.

== Government ==
The provincial council (&quot;provincieraad&quot;) consists of 36 members which were last elected in the 2018 elections. Previously it consisted of 72 members. The council currently consists of the following political parties:

Four people chosen by and from the council form the daily government, called the deputation (&quot;deputatie&quot;). The deputation of East Flanders is a coalition of the N-VA, CD&amp;V, and Groen.
