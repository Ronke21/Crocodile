<text>A homograph (from the , &quot;homós&quot; &#x27;same&#x27; and γράφω, &quot;gráphō&quot; &#x27;write&#x27;) is a word that shares the same written form as another word but has a different meaning. However, some dictionaries insist that the words must also be pronounced differently, while the Oxford English Dictionary says that the words should also be of &quot;different origin&quot;. In this vein, &quot;The Oxford Guide to Practical Lexicography&quot; lists various types of homographs, including those in which the words are discriminated by being in a different &quot;word class&quot;, such as &quot;hit&quot;, the verb &quot;to strike&quot;, and &quot;hit&quot;, the noun &quot;a strike&quot;.

If, when spoken, the meanings may be distinguished by different pronunciations, the words are also heteronyms. Words with the same writing &quot;and&quot; pronunciation (i.e. are both homographs and homophones) are considered homonyms. However, in a broader sense the term &quot;homonym&quot; may be applied to words with the same writing &quot;or&quot; pronunciation. Homograph disambiguation is critically important in speech synthesis, natural language processing and other fields. Identically written different senses of what is judged to be fundamentally the &quot;same&quot; word are called polysemes; for example, &quot;wood&quot; (substance) and &quot;wood&quot; (area covered with trees).

==In English==
Examples:
*&quot;sow&quot; (verb) – to plant seed
:&quot;sow&quot; (noun) – female pig
where the words are heteronyms, spelt identically but pronounced differently. Here confusion is not possible in spoken language but could occur in written language.

*&quot;bear&quot; (verb) – to support or carry
:&quot;bear&quot; (noun) – the animal
where the words are homonyms, identical in spelling and pronunciation (), but different in meaning and grammatical function.

The above examples are of etymologically unrelated words. Some homographs are also etymological doublets, meaning they come from the same source and are spelt the same way in Modern English, but their distinct meanings are tied to their distinct pronunciations:
*&quot;&quot; – of the Dominican Order or the Dominican Republic (fully anglicized, based on the Latin pronunciation of &quot;&quot; , named for Saint Dominic)
:&quot;Dominican&quot; – of Dominica (slightly modified from the Spanish pronunciation of &quot;Dominica&quot; , named for Latin &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;the Lord&#x27;s Day&quot; or &quot;Sunday&quot;)
Both words ultimately come from Latin &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;of the Lord.&quot;

*&quot;&quot; – viol player
:&quot;&quot; – viola player
Both &quot;viol&quot; and &quot;viola&quot; come from Latin &quot;&quot;.

===More examples===


==In Chinese==
Many Chinese varieties have homographs, called () or (), ().

===Old Chinese===
Modern study of Old Chinese has found patterns that suggest a system of affixes. One pattern is the addition of the prefix , which turns transitive verbs into intransitive or passives in some cases:

Another pattern is the use of a suffix, which seems to create nouns from verbs or verbs from nouns:
===Middle Chinese===
Many homographs in Old Chinese also exist in Middle Chinese. Examples of homographs in Middle Chinese are:
===Modern Chinese===
Many homographs in Old Chinese and Middle Chinese also exist in modern Chinese varieties. Homographs which did not exist in Old Chinese or Middle Chinese often come into existence due to differences between literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters. Other homographs may have been created due to merging two different characters into the same glyph during script reform (See Simplified Chinese characters and Shinjitai).

Some examples of homographs in Cantonese from Middle Chinese are:

<text>A homophone () is a word that is pronounced the same as another word but differs in meaning or in spelling. The two words may be spelled the same, for example &quot;rose&quot; (flower) and &quot;rose&quot; (past tense of &quot;rise&quot;), or spelled differently, as in &quot;rain&quot;, &quot;reign&quot;, and &quot;rein&quot;. The term &quot;homophone&quot; sometimes applies to units longer or shorter than words, for example a phrase, letter, or groups of letters which are pronounced the same as a counterpart. Any unit with this property is said to be &quot;homophonous&quot; ().

Homophones that are spelled the same are both homographs and homonyms. For example, the word &quot;read&quot;, in &quot;He is well &quot;read&quot;&quot; and in &quot;Yesterday, I &quot;read&quot; that book&quot;.

Homophones that are spelled differently are also called heterographs, e.g. &quot;to&quot;, &quot;too&quot;, and &quot;two&quot;.
==Etymology==
&quot;Homophone&quot; derives from Greek &quot;homo-&quot; (ὁμο‑), &quot;same&quot;, and &quot;phōnḗ&quot; (φωνή), &quot;voice, utterance&quot;.

==Wordplay and games==
Homophones are often used to create puns and to deceive the reader (as in crossword puzzles) or to suggest multiple meanings. The last usage is common in poetry and creative literature. An example of this is seen in Dylan Thomas&#x27;s radio play &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;: &quot;The shops in mourning&quot; where &quot;mourning&quot; can be heard as &quot;mourning&quot; or &quot;morning&quot;. Another vivid example is Thomas Hood&#x27;s use of &quot;birth&quot; and &quot;berth&quot; as well as &quot;told&quot; and &quot;toll&#x27;d&quot; (tolled) in his poem &quot;Faithless Sally Brown&quot;:

: His death, which happen&#x27;d in his &quot;berth&quot;,
: At forty-odd befell:
: They went and &quot;told&quot; the sexton, and
: The sexton &quot;toll&#x27;d&quot; the bell.

In some accents, various sounds have merged in that they are no longer distinctive, and thus words that differ only by those sounds in an accent that maintains the distinction (a minimal pair) are homophonous in the accent with the merger. Some examples from English are:

* &quot;pin&quot; and &quot;pen&quot; in many southern American accents 
* &quot;by&quot; and &quot;buy&quot; 
* &quot;merry&quot;, &quot;marry&quot;, and &quot;Mary&quot; in most American accents 
* The pairs &quot;do&quot; and &quot;due&quot; as well as &quot;forward&quot; and &quot;foreword&quot; are homophonous in most American accents but not in most English accents 
* The pairs &quot;talk&quot; and &quot;torque&quot; as well as &quot;court&quot; and &quot;caught&quot; are distinguished in rhotic accents, such as Scottish English, and most dialects of American English, but are homophones in some non-rhotic accents, such as British Received Pronunciation 

Wordplay is particularly common in English because the multiplicity of linguistic influences offers considerable complication in spelling and meaning and pronunciation compared with other languages.

Malapropisms, which often create a similar comic effect, are usually near-homophones. See also Eggcorn.

===Same-sounding phrases===
During the 1980s, an attempt was made to promote a distinctive term for same-sounding multiple words or phrases, by referring to them as &quot;oronyms&quot;,
but the term oronym was already well established in linguistics as an onomastic designation for a class of toponymic features (names of mountains, hills, etc.), the alternative use of the same term was not well accepted in scholarly literature.

==In various languages==

===English===
There are online lists of multinyms. In English, concerning groups of homophones (excluding proper nouns), there are approximately 88 triplets, 24 quadruplets, 2 quintuplets, 1 sextet, 1 septet, and 1 questionable octet (possibly a second septet). The questionable octet is:

: &quot;raise&quot;, &quot;rays&quot;, &quot;rase&quot;, &quot;raze&quot;, &quot;rehs&quot;, &quot;res&quot;, &quot;reais&quot;, [&quot;race&quot;]

Other than the common words &quot;raise&quot;, &quot;rays&quot;, and &quot;race&quot; this octet includes

* &quot;raze&quot; – a verb meaning &quot;to demolish, level to the ground&quot; or &quot;to scrape as if with a razor&quot;
* &quot;rase&quot; – an archaic verb meaning &quot;to erase&quot;
* &quot;rehs&quot; – the plural of &quot;reh&quot;, a mixture of sodium salts found as an efflorescence in India
* &quot;res&quot; – the plural of &quot;re&quot;, a name for one step of the musical scale; obsolete legal term for &quot;the matter&quot; or &quot;incident&quot;
* &quot;reais&quot; – the plural of real, the currency unit of Brazil

The inclusion of &quot;race&quot; in the octet above is questionable, since its pronunciation differs from the other words on the list (ending with /s/ instead of /z/).

If proper names are included, then a possible nonet would be:
* &quot;Ayr&quot; – a town in Scotland
* &quot;Aire&quot; – a river in Yorkshire
* &quot;Eyre&quot; – legal term and various geographic locations 
* &quot;heir&quot; – one who inherits
* &quot;air&quot; – the ubiquitous atmospheric gas that people breathe; a type of musical tune
* &quot;err&quot; – to make an error 
* &quot;ere&quot; – poetic / archaic &quot;before&quot; 
* &quot;e&#x27;er&quot; – poetic &quot;ever&quot; (some speakers)
* &quot;are&quot; – a defunct, small, metric unit of area

Certain word pairs that were historically variant spellings of the same words, but eventually standardized as distinct homophonous words by mere spelling, include:
*&quot;flour&quot; and &quot;flower&quot;: &quot;flour&quot; is the older spelling used for the later meaning (&quot;wheat powder,&quot; supposedly the &quot;finest&quot; part, the &quot;bloom&quot; of a meal; compare French &quot;&quot;, literally &quot;flower of flour&quot;); &quot;flower&quot; is the later spelling used for the original meaning (&quot;bloom&quot;). The verb &quot;flourish&quot; (&quot;blossom&quot;) is spelt more similarly to the noun &quot;flour&quot; (&quot;wheat powder&quot;).
*&quot;discrete&quot; and &quot;discreet&quot;: &quot;discrete&quot; maintains the original meaning (&quot;separate&quot;); &quot;discreet&quot; is used for the later meaning (&quot;prudent&quot;), although the noun &quot;discretion&quot; (&quot;prudence&quot;) looks more similar to &quot;discrete&quot;. The split in spelling occurred after during the late 16th century when &quot;discreet&quot; was favored for the popular meaning of &quot;prudent,&quot; while &quot;discrete&quot; is favored in academic contexts.
*&quot;passed&quot; and &quot;past&quot;: &quot;past&quot; was one of the many variants of the past participle &quot;passed&quot; of the Middle English verb &quot;&quot; (whence Modern English &quot;pass&quot;). During the 14th century, &quot;past&quot; was used specifically as an adjective and prepostion, and during the 15th century as a noun by ellipsis with the earlier adjective. Compare the Romance cognates, French &quot;&quot;, Italian &quot;&quot;, Portuguese &quot;&quot; and Spanish &quot;&quot;, all of which function as past participles, adjectives and nouns.
*&quot;born&quot; and &quot;borne&quot;: these were variant spellings of the same past participle of &quot;bear&quot;, whose general meaning is &quot;carry&quot;, but with one specific derived meaning, &quot;birth&quot;. The distinction between &quot;born&quot; for &quot;birthed&quot; and &quot;borne&quot; for &quot;carried&quot; came to be sometime during the 17th century. Compare &quot;sworne&quot;, &quot;torne&quot; and &quot;worne&quot;, variants of &quot;sworn&quot;, &quot;torn&quot; and &quot;worn&quot;, that did not survive into present-day English.

&quot;Its&quot; was merely the genitive form of &quot;it&quot; and derived by adding the apostrophe and &quot;s&quot;, thus originally spelt &quot;it&#x27;s&quot;, making it also a homograph of &quot;it&#x27;s&quot; (contraction of &quot;it is/has&quot;). The genitive &quot;it&#x27;s&quot; was retained even toward the early 19th century. The spelling of &quot;aisle&quot; (from Middle French &quot;&quot;, Old French &quot;&quot;, Latin &quot;&quot;) was altered with the silent letter &quot;s&quot; due to its historical homophony with &quot;isle&quot; (Old French &quot;&quot;, Latin &quot;&quot;) in both French and English. Spelling alteration (often based on etymology) can also obscure homophony, such as the case of &quot;&quot;, which prevailed over the historical variant &quot;coronel&quot; by the late Modern English period, but which is now still pronounced identically to &quot;kernel&quot; as if the &quot;r&quot; were still there in the spelling. The &quot;ye&quot; in &quot;dye&quot; is purposefully retained in its forms, especially its present participle &quot;dyeing&quot;, in order to distinguish it from the homophonous &quot;dying&quot;, which is the present participle of &quot;die&quot;.

Homophony (and even homography) can arise due to confusion between similar-, but not identical-, sounding words, which end up sounding identical. &quot;&quot; (&quot;way of management&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;insurance contract&quot;) come from two distinct Greek words that ended up homophonous in English, &quot;&quot; (whence Latin &quot;&quot; and French &quot;polic(i)e&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (whence Latin &quot;&quot;, Italian &quot;&quot; and French &quot;police&quot;).

Many words were historically heterophonous, but after historical sound changes, including the Great Vowel Shift and various vowel mergers, they became homophonous. For example, &quot;ail&quot; and &quot;ale&quot;, both pronounced in Modern English, were respectively &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; in Middle English before the Great Vowel Shift. The verbs &quot;lie&quot; (past tense and past participle &quot;lied&quot;) and &quot;lie&quot; (past tense &quot;lay&quot;, past participle &quot;lain&quot;) used to be &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; in Old English; while &quot;will&quot; (past tense &quot;would&quot;) and &quot;will&quot; (past tense and past participle &quot;willed&quot;) used to be &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; .

&quot;Ax(e)&quot; (Middle English &quot;&quot;, Old English &quot;/&quot;), an obsolescent variant of &quot;ask&quot; (Middle English &quot;&quot;, Old English &quot;&quot;), is homophonous with &quot;ax(e)&quot; (cutting tool) in some Scottish accents, but with &quot;arcs&quot; in some English accents such as Multicultural London English.

Epenthesis, which often occurs at the boundary between a nasal and a fricative, can cause some words that are phonemically distinct to become phonetically homophonous. For example, &quot;assistance&quot; may be pronounced , with an additional &quot;t&quot; like in &quot;assistants&quot;.

=== Brazilian Portuguese ===
The Portuguese language has one of the highest numbers of homophones and consequently homographs in the world. Homophonic words include: &quot;Jogo&quot; - I throw, &quot;Jogo&quot; - I play, &quot;Jogo&quot; - Match (Sports), and &quot;Jogo&quot; - Game (This last one is controversial, with dialects like Paulistano considering it non-homophonic, while dialects like Caipira consider it only homophonic, noting that these are two Brazilian dialects.)

For example, &quot;Cinto&quot; is a homophone for 9 other words, totalizing 10.(Oxford Languages)

Although they are homophones, most of them are also homographs.

# Cinto - a strip of varying width made of fabric, leather, or other material, worn around the waist and tied with a bow or fastened with a buckle or other closure.
# Cinto - any strap or band that encircles the waist or trunk for safety purposes.
# Cinto - synonymous with &quot;CÓS&quot; (waistband).
# Cinto - that which surrounds and/or limits a space; fence.
# Cinto - a ring that encircles something; belt.
# Cinto - &quot;A metal cinto reinforces the columns.&quot;
# Cinto - synonymous with &quot;ANILHA&quot; (ring).
# Cinto - a long, narrow bag that travelers attach to the waist or carry over the shoulder.
# Sinto - to touch and feel the texture.
# Sinto - to become sensitive to something

===German===
There are many homophones in present-day standard German. As in other languages, however, there exists regional and/or individual variation in certain groups of words or in single words, so that the number of homophones varies accordingly. Regional variation is especially common in words that exhibit the long vowels &quot;ä&quot; and &quot;e&quot;. According to the well-known dictionary Duden, these vowels should be distinguished as /ɛ:/ and /e:/, but this is not always the case, so that words like &quot;Ähre&quot; (ear of corn) and &quot;Ehre&quot; (honor) may or may not be homophones.
Individual variation is shown by a pair like &quot;Gäste&quot; (guests) – &quot;Geste&quot; (gesture), the latter of which varies between /ˈɡe:stə/ and /ˈɡɛstə/ and by a pair like &quot;Stiel&quot; (handle, stalk) – &quot;Stil&quot; (style), the latter of which varies between /ʃtiːl/ and /stiːl/.

Besides websites that offer extensive lists of German homophones, there are others which provide numerous sentences with various types of homophones. In the German language homophones occur in more than 200 instances. Of these, a few are triples like
* &quot;Waagen&quot; (weighing scales) – &quot;Wagen&quot; (cart) – &quot;wagen&quot; (to dare)
* &quot;Waise&quot; (orphan) – &quot;Weise&quot; (way, manner) – &quot;weise&quot; (wise)
Most are couples like &quot;lehren&quot; (to teach) – &quot;leeren&quot; (to empty).

=== Spanish ===
Although Spanish has far fewer homophones than English, they are far from being non-existent. Some are homonyms, such as &quot;basta&quot;, which can either mean &#x27;enough&#x27; or &#x27;coarse&#x27;, and some exist because of homophonous letters. For example, the letters &quot;b&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are pronounced exactly alike, so the words &quot;basta&quot; (coarse) and &quot;vasta&quot; (vast) are pronounced identically. 

Other homonyms are spelled the same, but mean different things in different genders. For example, the masculine noun &quot;el capital&quot; means &#x27;capital&#x27; as in &#x27;money&#x27;, but the feminine noun &quot;la capital&quot; means &#x27;capital city&#x27;.

===Japanese===
There are many homophones in Japanese, due to the use of Sino-Japanese vocabulary, where borrowed words and morphemes from Chinese are widely used in Japanese, but many phonemic contrasts, such as the original words&#x27; tones, are lost.

An extreme example is the pronunciation which, accounting for the &quot;flat&quot; pitch accent, is used for the following words:

* (organization / mechanism)
* (travelogue)
* (rare)
* (horseback riding)
* (outstanding achievement)
* (draft)
* (eccentricity)
* (contrivance)
* (stopping at port)
* (returning to school)
* (breathing exercise, qigong)
* (contribute an article / a written piece)
* (armor, e.g. of a tank)
* (homeward voyage)
* (remarkable effect)
* (season / climate)
* (stoma)
* (setting to work)
* (climate)
* (returning to port)
Upon adoption from Middle Chinese into Early Middle Japanese, certain sounds were modified or simplified to match Japanese phonology, causing homophony. For example, in the above list, , , , , , and may have been pronounced in Middle Chinese, but in Japanese. Furthermore, there were vowel fusions and mergers during Late Middle Japanese which furthered even more homophony. For example, , , and were once pronounced distinctly as , but now all as .

===Korean===
The Korean language contains a combination of words that strictly belong to Korean and words that are loanwords from Chinese. Due to Chinese being pronounced with varying tones and Korean&#x27;s removal of those tones, and because the modern Korean writing system, Hangeul, has a more finite number of phonemes than, for example, Latin-derived alphabets such as that of English, there are many homonyms with both the same spelling and pronunciation.
For example
* &quot;: &#x27;to put on makeup&#x27; vs. &quot;: &#x27;to cremate&#x27;
* &quot;: &#x27;inheritance&#x27; vs. &quot;: &#x27;miscarriage&#x27;
* &quot;: &#x27;fart&#x27; vs. &quot;: &#x27;guard&#x27;
* &#x27;밤[밤ː]&#x27;: &#x27;chestnut&#x27; vs. &#x27;밤&#x27;: &#x27;night&#x27;

There are heterographs, but far fewer, contrary to the tendency in English. For example,
* &#x27;학문(學問)&#x27;: &#x27;learning&#x27; vs. &#x27;항문(肛門)&#x27;: &#x27;anus&#x27;.
Using hanja (), which are Chinese characters, such words are written differently.

As in other languages, Korean homonyms can be used to make puns. The context in which the word is used indicates which meaning is intended by the speaker or writer.

=== Mandarin Chinese ===
Due to phonological constraints in Mandarin syllables (as Mandarin only allows for an initial consonant, a vowel, and a nasal or retroflex consonant in respective order), there are only a little over 400 possible unique syllables that can be produced, compared to over 15,831 in the English language.

Chinese has an entire genre of poems taking advantage of the large amount of homophones called one-syllable articles, or poems where every single word in the poem is pronounced as the same syllable if tones are disregarded. An example is the &quot;Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den.&quot;

Like all Chinese languages, Mandarin uses phonemic tones to distinguish homophonic syllables; Mandarin has five tones. A famous example,
* &quot;mā&quot; (妈) means &quot;mother&quot;
* &quot;má&quot; (麻) means &quot;hemp&quot;
* &quot;mă&quot; (马) means &quot;horse&quot;
* &quot;mà&quot; (骂) means &quot;scold&quot;
* &quot;ma&quot; (吗) is a yes / no question particle

Although all these words consist of the same string of consonants and vowels, the only way to distinguish each of these words audibly is by listening to which tone the word has, and as shown above, saying a consonant-vowel string using a different tone can produce an entirely different word altogether. If tones are included, the number of unique syllables in Mandarin increases to at least 1,522.

However, even with tones, Mandarin retains a very large amount of homophones. &quot;Yì&quot;, for example, has at least 125 homophones, and it is the pronunciation used for Chinese characters such as 义, 意, 易, 亿, 议, 一, and 已.

There are even place names in China that have identical pronunciations, aside for the difference in tone. For example, there are two neighboring provinces with nearly identical names, Shanxi (山西) and Shaanxi (陕西) Province. The only difference in pronunciation between the two names are the tone in the first syllable (Shanxi is pronounced &quot;Shānxī&quot; whereas Shaanxi is pronounced &quot;Shǎnxī&quot;)&quot;.&quot; As most languages exclude the tone diacritics when transcribing Chinese place names into their own languages, the only way to visually distinguish the two names is to write Shaanxi in Gwoyeu Romatzyh romanization. Otherwise, nearly all other spellings of placenames in mainland China are spelled using Hanyu Pinyin romanization.

Many scholars believe that the Chinese language did not always have such a large number of homophones and that the phonological structure of Chinese syllables was once more complex, which allowed for a larger amount of possible syllables so that words sounded more distinct from each other.

Scholars also believe that Old Chinese had no phonemic tones, but tones emerged in Middle Chinese to replace sounds that were lost from Old Chinese. Since words in Old Chinese sounded more distinct from each other at this time, it explains why many words in Classical Chinese consisted of only one syllable. For example, the Standard Mandarin word 狮子(&quot;shīzi&quot;, meaning &quot;lion&quot;) was simply 狮 (&quot;shī&quot;) in Classical Chinese, and the Standard Mandarin word 教育 (&quot;jiàoyù,&quot; &quot;education&quot;) was simply 教 (&quot;jiào&quot;) in Classical Chinese.

Since many Chinese words became homophonic over the centuries, it became difficult to distinguish words when listening to documents written in Classical Chinese being read aloud. One-syllable articles like those mentioned above are evidence for this. For this reason, many one-syllable words from Classical Chinese became two-syllable words, like the words mentioned in the previous paragraph.

Even with the existence of two- or two-syllable words, however, there are even multisyllabic homophones. And there are also a lot of harmonic words. The cultural phenomenon brought about by such linguistic characteristics is that from ancient times to the present day, people have been keen to play games and jokes with homophonic and harmonic words. In modern life, the influence of homophones can be seen everywhere, from CCTV evening sketch programmes, folk art performances and popular folk life. In recent years, receiving the influence of Internet pop culture, young people have invented more new and popular homophones. Homophones even play a major role in daily life throughout China, including Spring Festival traditions, which gifts to give (and not give), political criticism, texting, and many other aspects of people&#x27;s lives.

Another complication that arises within the Chinese language is that in non-rap songs, tones are disregarded in favor of maintaining melody in the song. While in most cases, the lack of phonemic tones in music does not cause confusion among native speakers, there are instances where puns may arise.

Subtitles in Chinese characters are usually displayed on music videos and in songs sung on movies and TV shows to disambiguate the song&#x27;s lyrics.

=== Russian ===
The presence of homophones in the Russian language is associated in some cases with the phenomenon of devoicing of consonants at the end of words and before another consonant sound, in other cases with the reduction of vowels in an unstressed position. Examples include: порог — порок — парок, луг — лук, плод — плот, туш — тушь, падёж — падёшь, бал — балл, косный — костный, предать — придать, компания — кампания, косатка — касатка, привидение — приведение, кот — код, прут — пруд, титрация — тетрация, комплимент — комплемент.

Also, the infinitive and the present (or simple future) tense of the third person of the same verb are often pronounced the same way (in writing they differ in the presence or absence of the letter Ь (soft sign) before the postfix -ся): (надо) решиться — (он) решится, (хочу) строиться — (дом) строится, (металл может) гнуться — (деревья) гнутся, (должен) вернуться — (они) вернутся. This often leads to incorrect spelling of reflexive verbs ending with -ться/-тся: in some cases, Ь is mistakenly placed before -ся in the present tense of the third person, while in others, on the contrary, Ь before -ся is missing in the infinitive form.

=== Vietnamese ===
It is estimated that there are approximately 4,500 to 4,800 possible syllables in Vietnamese, depending on the dialect. The exact number is difficult to calculate because there are significant differences in pronunciation among the dialects. For example, the graphemes and digraphs &quot;d&quot;, &quot;gi&quot;, and &quot;r&quot; are all pronounced /z/ in the Hanoi dialect, so the words &quot;dao&quot; (knife), &quot;giao&quot; (delivery), and &quot;rao&quot; (advertise) are all pronounced /zaw˧/. In Saigon dialect, however, the graphemes and digraphs &quot;d&quot;, &quot;gi&quot;, and &quot;v&quot; are all pronounced /j/, so the words &quot;dao&quot; (knife), &quot;giao&quot; (delivery), and &quot;vao&quot; (enter) are all pronounced /jaw˧/.

Pairs of words that are homophones in one dialect may not be homophones in the other. For example, the words &quot;sắc&quot; (sharp) and &quot;xắc&quot; (dice) are both pronounced /săk˧˥/ in Hanoi dialect, but pronounced /ʂăk˧˥/ and /săk˧˥/ in Saigon dialect respectively.
==Psychological research==

===Pseudo-homophones===
Pseudo-homophones are pseudowords that are phonetically identical to a word. For example, groan/grone and crane/crain are pseudo-homophone pairs, whereas plane/plain is a homophone pair since both letter strings are recognised words. Both types of pairs are used in lexical decision tasks to investigate word recognition.

===Use as ambiguous information===
Homophones, specifically heterographs, where one spelling is of a threatening nature and one is not (&quot;e.g.&quot; slay/sleigh, war/wore) have been used in studies of anxiety as a test of cognitive models that those with high anxiety tend to interpret ambiguous information in a threatening manner.

<text>Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. ( ) is a commercial U.S. airline, headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii and a subsidiary of Alaska Air Group. 
It is the largest operator of commercial flights to and from the island state of Hawaii, and the tenth largest commercial airline in the United States by passengers carried.

The airline operates its main hub at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport on the island of Oʻahu and a secondary hub out of Kahului Airport on the island of Maui. The airline also maintained a crew base at Los Angeles International Airport.

The airline operates flights to Asia, American Samoa, Australia, French Polynesia, Hawaii, New Zealand, Alaska, Canada, and the Contiguous United States.

Hawaiian is the oldest American carrier that has never had a fatal accident or a hull loss throughout its history, and frequently tops the on-time carrier list in the United States, as well as the fewest cancellations, oversales, and baggage handling issues.

On December 3, 2023, Alaska Air Group announced that it planned to purchase Hawaiian Airlines, pending regulatory approval. On August 19, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice declined to file a lawsuit to block the acquisition. The U.S. Department of Transportation subsequently cleared the two parties on September 17, 2024, for completing the merger. On September 18, 2024, the merger was completed.

== History ==
=== Early years (1929–1984) ===

Inter-Island Airways (Hawaiian: &quot;&quot;), the forerunner of the airline which is now known as Hawaiian Airlines, was incorporated on January 30, 1929. Inter-Island Airways, a subsidiary of Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company, began operations on October 6, 1929, with a Bellanca CH-300 Pacemaker, providing short sightseeing flights over Oʻahu. Scheduled service began a month later on November 11 using Sikorsky S-38s with a flight from Honolulu to Hilo, via intermediary stops on Molokaʻi and Maui.

On October 1, 1941, the name was changed to Hawaiian Airlines when the company phased out the older Sikorsky S-38 and Sikorsky S-43 flying boats. The first Douglas DC-3s were added to the fleet in August 1941, some examples remaining in operation until final retirement in November 1968.

Modern pressurized equipment was introduced in 1952 in the form of the Convair 340. Further Convair 440s were added in 1959 to 1960, most of the Convairs being converted to turbine propeller power in 1965 to 1967. The last were sold in 1974.

Hawaiian Airlines started to offer jet service in 1966 with the acquisition of Douglas DC-9-10 aircraft, which cut travel times in half on most of its routes.

From 1973 on, the airline&#x27;s logo featured the face of Miss Hawaii 1964, Leina&#x27;ala Drummond, who had been a flight attendant with the airline.

===Hawaiian Air Cargo===
From 1976 to 1977 and again from 1978 to 1980, Hawaiian had a mainland air cargo division called Hawaiian Air Cargo based in Macon, Georgia, focused on the United States Air Force Logair domestic cargo program. Hawaiian used Lockheed L-188 Electra freighter aircraft. The airline won an Air Force contract for 1976–1977, but then lost the lease of the aircraft it was using and was unable to bid for 1977–1978. In 1978 Hawaiian tried once more with a new batch of aircraft. Hawaiian Air Cargo operated again 1978–1980, when Hawaiian sold the operation to Zantop International Airlines.

=== Growth outside Hawaii (1984–1994) ===
Hawaiian Airlines began to expand its footprint throughout the 1980s, as the result of intense competition on inter-island routes created by the entrance of Mid Pacific Air into the market. In 1985, the company began its first foray outside the inter-island market through charter services to the South Pacific and then throughout the rest of the Pacific using Douglas DC-8 aircraft. Despite the early successes of this new business, Hawaiian was forced to curtail its charter services when the Federal Government banned all DC-8 and B707 aircraft without hush kits from operating within the US. Hawaiian did, however, manage to gain a short exemption for its South Pacific services.

Soon after, in early 1985, the company received the first two of its leased Lockheed L-1011 TriStars. One aircraft was used to launch Hawaiian&#x27;s first scheduled operation out of Hawaiʻi: daily Honolulu-Los Angeles services. This new service put Hawaiian in direct competition with the major US air carriers for the first time in its history. Throughout 1985 and 1986, Hawaiian Airlines added additional L-1011s to its fleet and used them to open up services to other West Coast gateway cities such as San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Las Vegas, and Anchorage, which placed Hawaiian in further competition against the major US airlines.

Hawaiian Airlines also entered the new international markets of Australia and New Zealand in 1986 with one-stop services through Pago Pago International Airport. Hawaiian also aggressively grew its international charter business and pursued military transport contracts. This led to a large growth in the company&#x27;s revenues and caused its inter-island service&#x27;s share of revenues to shrink to just about a third of the company&#x27;s total.

During the 1980s, Hawaiian also embarked on the development and construction of Kapalua Airport on the west side of Maui. Opened in 1987, the airport was designed with a , which constrained its ability to handle large aircraft. As a result, when the airport first opened, Hawaiian Airlines was the only inter-island carrier with aircraft capable of serving the airport. With its de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7 turboprops, Hawaiian had a distinct competitive advantage in the Maui market.

Heading into the 1990s, Hawaiian Airlines faced financial difficulties, racking up millions of dollars in losses throughout the previous three years. Due to the airline&#x27;s increasingly unprofitable operations, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September 1993. During this time, the company reduced many of its costs: reorganizing its debt, wrestling concessions from employees, cutting overcapacity, and streamlining its fleet by disposing of many of the planes it had added to its fleet just a few years earlier.

As part of Hawaiian&#x27;s restructuring, it sold Kapalua Airport to the State of Hawaii in 1993. Hawaiian soon after discontinued service to the airport as it retired its Dash 7 fleet. The retirement of the Dash 7 in 1994 also resulted in the airline operating a more streamlined all-jet fleet as it exited bankruptcy in September 1994.

=== All jet fleet (1994–2003) ===
To replace its retired DC-8s and L-1011s, Hawaiian Airlines leased six DC-10s from American Airlines, who continued to provide maintenance on the aircraft. An agreement with American also included participation in American&#x27;s SABRE reservation system and participation in American Airlines&#x27; AAdvantage frequent flyer program. The DC-10s were subsequently retired between 2002 and 2003. The company replaced these leased DC-10s with 14 leased Boeing 767 aircraft during a fleet modernization program that also replaced its DC-9s with new Boeing 717 aircraft. The Boeing aircraft featured an updated rendition of the company&#x27;s &quot;Pualani&quot; tail art, which had appeared on its Douglas aircraft since the 1970s. A new design was updated by a local artist Mauriel Morejon. Pualani, which means &quot;flower of the sky,&quot; the key icon of Hawaiian&#x27;s brand for more than four decades, continues to feature on the tail of the aircraft; beneath her, a silver maile lei with woven pakalana flower wraps around the fuselage.

In October 2002, Hawaiian began service to Phoenix Sky Harbor airport with its Boeing 767–300 aircraft.

=== Second bankruptcy and reorganization (2003–2005) ===
In March 2003, Hawaiian Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in its history. The airline continued its normal operations, and at the time was overdue for $4.5 million worth of payments to the pilots&#x27; pension plan. Within the company, it was suggested that the plan be terminated. As of May 2005, Hawaiian Airlines had received court approval for its reorganization plan. The company emerged from bankruptcy protection on June 2, 2005, with reduced operating costs through renegotiated contracts with its union work groups; restructured aircraft leases; and investment from RC Aviation, a unit of San Diego–based Ranch Capital, which bought a majority share in parent company Hawaiian Holdings Inc in 2004.

=== Post-bankruptcy (2005–2012) ===
On September 28, 2005, Hawaiian Airlines began nonstop daily flights from Honolulu to San Jose, California. This made San Jose the fifth gateway city in California to be serviced by Hawaiian; the others were Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento, and San Francisco.

On May 4, 2006, Hawaiian Airlines expanded service between the US mainland and Hawaii in anticipation of the induction of four additional Boeing 767–300 aircraft, primarily focused on expanding non-stop service to Kahului Airport from San Diego, Seattle, and Portland. Additional flights were also added between Honolulu and the cities of Sacramento, Seattle, and Los Angeles. In 2006, Hawaiian Airlines was rated as the best carrier serving Hawaii by &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot;, Zagat and &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot;.

On July 24, 2007, Hawaiian Airlines and Air New Zealand signed a $45 million contract for Air New Zealand to perform heavy maintenance on Hawaiian&#x27;s Boeing 767 aircraft. This contract lasted for five years. Air New Zealand stated that this opportunity will also give a chance for them to build their expertise working on 767s. In August 2007, the Seattle Seahawks became the second sports team to begin using Hawaiian Airlines to travel to games. The Las Vegas Raiders, also of the NFL, have been flying Hawaiian Airlines since the 1990s. The two teams formerly flew on Hawaiian&#x27;s Boeing 767s to and from all their games, but now travel on Hawaiian&#x27;s Airbus A330s. Several of Hawaiian&#x27;s Boeing 767 and A330 aircraft have been fitted with decals of logos of the Raiders.

In March 2008, the airline launched nonstop flights to Manila, capital of Philippines, in the airline&#x27;s first major international expansion since it emerged from bankruptcy protection in June 2005. In response to the closure of ATA Airlines and Aloha Airlines, the airline began flights to Oakland on May 1, 2008.

On February 16, 2010, Hawaiian Airlines sought approval from the United States Department of Transportation to begin nonstop flights from its hub at Honolulu to Tokyo-Haneda sometime in 2010. The airline was one of five US carriers – the others being Delta Air Lines, Continental Airlines, United Airlines and American Airlines — seeking approval to serve Haneda as part of the U.S.-Japan OpenSkies agreement. Approval was granted from USDOT to begin nonstop service to Haneda, Japan. The flight began service on November 18, 2010. In addition, the airline is planning to establish a codeshare agreement with All Nippon Airways.

On January 12, 2011, Hawaiian Airlines began nonstop service to Seoul-Incheon, South Korea. On March 31, 2011, Hawaiian announced that they will be renovating the check-in lobby of the inter-island terminal at the Honolulu International Airport (Hawaiian&#x27;s main hub). Hawaiian, the only occupant of the inter-island terminal, will be removing the traditional check-in counter, to install six circular check-in islands in the middle of the lobbies. Those check-in islands can be used for inter-island, mainland, and international flights. On July 12, 2011, Hawaiian added Osaka, Japan to its network. On November 17, 2011, Hawaiian ordered five additional Airbus A330-200 aircraft.

On June 4, 2012, Hawaiian expanded to the east coast with daily flights to New York&#x27;s John F. Kennedy International Airport. On August 30, 2012, Hawaiian filed an application with the U.S. Department of Transportation for a nonstop route between Kona and Tokyo-Haneda. This would fill a void that Japan Airlines left when it ceased service to Kona nearly two years earlier. However, the US Department of Transportation rejected the airline&#x27;s application to begin service. On December 3, 2012, the airline unveiled plans to begin flights to Taipei, Taiwan, beginning July 9, 2013, as part of its aggressive expansion plans.

=== Further expansion and new subsidiary carrier (2013–2023) ===
On February 11, 2013, the airline announced a new venture in the turboprop interisland business, &quot;’Ohana by Hawaiian”. The service is operated by Empire Airlines using ATR 42–500 turboprop airplanes. The service began on March 11, 2014, to Molokaʻi and Lānaʻi. The airline expanded more &quot;ʻOhana by Hawaiian&quot; routes between Kahului, Kailua-Kona and Hilo during the summer of 2014. On April 10, 2013, the airline announced its first destination in China, with service to Beijing expected to start on April 16, 2014, pending government approval. At the same time, the airline announced that it would end service to Manila capital of the Philippines on July 31, 2013. On July 11, 2013, the airline signed a codeshare agreement with China Airlines.

On March 12, 2014, Hawaiian announced that it would begin daily service between Kahului and Los Angeles on May 2, adding a second flight from June 30 to September 8 in response to passenger demand. It would also begin nonstop summer service between Los Angeles and both Līhuʻe, Kauaʻi, and Kona, Hawaiʻi.
On August 14, 2014, the airline announced direct service between Kahului and San Francisco beginning in November.

On January 5, 2015, Hawaiian refiled its previously rejected application with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) for the Kona-Haneda route with service, if approved, to begin in June. The request was prompted by a DOT decision in December 2014 to review the public interest in Delta Air Lines&#x27; Seattle-Tokyo route after Delta reduced the frequency of those flights from daily to seasonal. On March 31, DOT again denied the request, opting instead to allow Delta to continue operating the route, with American Airlines taking over if Delta&#x27;s planned service continued to fail.

On May 1, 2017, the airline revealed a new logo and livery for its aircraft.

On March 6, 2018, the airline announced an order for 10 Boeing 787–9 Dreamliners with options for an additional ten; selecting GE GEnx engines. An order for an additional two 787-9 aircraft was announced on January 4, 2023.

Due to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hawaiian Airlines reported a net loss of over $100 million for the Q2 of 2020.

Fourteen-day travel quarantines, which were reinstated for August 2020 have also contributed to Hawaiian Airlines&#x27; plans to downsize the company by 15–25% by summer 2021.

On May 27, 2021, Hawaiian announced that it would discontinue the ʻOhana by Hawaiian brand and its cargo and passenger services after the pandemic and resulting quarantine significantly impacted interisland travel. The interruptions in service forced the airline to reconsider the viability of the operation and determine it was no longer feasible. The carrier&#x27;s ATR fleet would be moved to the mainland and be prepared for sale.

On April 25, 2022, Hawaiian Airlines announced they will become the first major air carrier to offer the SpaceX Starlink service on all Transpacific flights. The service will be offered free to passengers beginning in 2023. In September 2024, Hawaiian announced it had installed Starlink on its Airbus fleet. 

On May 15, 2023, Hawaiian Airlines has introduced the new &quot;Leihōkū Suites&quot; on their Boeing 787–9 Dreamliner aircraft. These suites offer a space with fully lie-flat seating, an 18-inch in-flight entertainment screen, personal outlets, wireless charging, and direct aisle access. The design elements are said to be evoking Hawaiʻi&#x27;s natural world.

===Acquisition by Alaska Air Group (2023–2024)===
In December 2023, Alaska Airlines announced that it would merge with Hawaiian Airlines by purchasing it for $1.9 billion in cash along with an assumption of approximately $900 million in outstanding debt. Airline industry analysts had promoted the merger for years which would create a combined carrier focused on the western United States. The merger would provide Alaska, which is primarily a domestic carrier with narrowbody aircraft, with Hawaiian&#x27;s widebody jets, pilots, and international networks.

The merger would retain both Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines as separate brands; Hawaiian Airlines would also become a Oneworld member. The two airlines intend to operate a combined frequent-flier program, with Alaska&#x27;s Mileage Plan likely to replace HawaiianMiles unless the companies opt for an all-new program. The proposed merger was approved by shareholders of Hawaiian Airlines in April 2024, following earlier approval from both Alaska Air Group and Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.

Under President Biden, the U.S. Department of Justice has worked to prevent further consolidation in the airline industry but it was initially unclear whether the department would file suit against the merger, with analysts noting differences between the proposal and prior proposals opposed by the administration. The main area of regulatory concern is likely to be that the deal would put about 40% of the traffic between Hawaii and the mainland U.S. in one company&#x27;s hands. When the deal was announced, company executives expected approval from the Justice Department to take between a year and 18 months. On August 19, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice completed its regulatory antitrust review of the proposed acquisition and declined to attempt to block the merger in court. On September 17, 2024, the regulator from the U.S. Department of Transportation approved the merger, with conditions including the one-to-one exchange rate for airline points, maintenance of &quot;robust levels&quot; of inter-island passenger and cargo flights, continued service to rural Hawaiian communities, the permission for children under the age of thirteen to sit next to accompanying adults regardless of their tickets, as well as lowered costs for military members and their families.

At the time, the companies overlapped on 12 nonstop routes which they described as minimal. Alaska Airlines emphasized its experience operating an intra-Alaska network including service to 16 destinations not reachable by road while pledging to maintain a robust interisland schedule in Hawaii to neighbor islands. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; speculated that consolidation would lead to higher prices for consumers on flights to Hawaii although this was disputed by the companies.

When the merger was announced, Gov. Josh Green (HI) promised that he and the attorney general Anne Lopez would monitor the merger &quot;very closely&quot; adding that both &quot;are very high-quality companies, but ultimately, I will be watching to make sure all of our state&#x27;s needs are met and all of our workers are cared for.&quot; As part of its effort to garner local support for the merger, Alaska Airlines made three key promises to Hawaii residents to maintain the Hawaiian Airlines brand, keep all front-line union employees, and protect neighbor island flights. In February 2024, Richard Bissen (mayor of Maui County), Rick Blangiardi (mayor of the City and County of Honolulu), Derek Kawakami (mayor of Kauai County), and Mitch Roth (mayor of Hawaiʻi County) published an open letter in the &quot;Honolulu Star-Advertiser&quot; declaring their support for the merger as &quot;good for Hawaiʻi&quot; and enhance service to neighbor islands.

Alaska Airlines has confirmed that miles held in Hawaiian&#x27;s HawaiianMiles frequent flyer program would be converted to the Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan scheme at a 1:1 ratio.

On September 18, 2024, Alaska Air Group completed the acquisition of Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.

== Fleet ==
, Hawaiian Airlines operates the following aircraft:

The airline names its Boeing 717 aircraft after birds found in Polynesia, its Airbus A330 aircraft after Polynesian constellations historically used to navigate to the Hawaiian islands, and its Airbus A321neo fleet after plants and forests within the Hawaiian islands.

=== Inter-island fleet ===
==== Boeing 717 ====
Hawaiian began operating the Boeing 717 on its interisland network in March 2001. On June 4, 2008, the airline announced that it had agreed to lease an additional four 717 airplanes to meet demand due to the shutdown of Aloha Airlines&#x27; passenger operations and the closing of ATA Airlines, with deliveries between September and the end of 2008.

=== Medium and long-haul fleet ===
==== Airbus A321neo ====

In January 2013, Hawaiian signed a memorandum of understanding with Airbus for an order of 16 A321neo aircraft plus up to 9 options. The aircraft is operated in a 2-class, 189-seat configuration. Following the completion of labor agreements relating to the operation of the aircraft with the airline&#x27;s pilot and flight attendant unions, the airline finalized the order in March 2013. In December 2016, Hawaiian announced their intention of leasing two additional A321neo aircraft, bringing their total fleet of the type to 18. The first flight took place on January 17, 2018, from Kahului to Oakland, California.

==== Airbus A330-200 ====

On November 27, 2007, Hawaiian Airlines signed a memorandum of understanding with Airbus for 24 long-range jets priced at $4.4 billion. The order included six Airbus A330-200s with a further six purchase rights and six Airbus A350-800s with a further six purchase rights. Plans to fly to Paris and London were discussed. Deliveries for the A330s began in 2010 while the first A350 was to be delivered in 2017. Upon the cancellation of A350-800 development, Hawaiian opted for six A330-800s instead.

On October 27, 2008, Hawaiian announced that, prior to the arrival of its new A330s, it would lease two additional Airbus A330-200 aircraft, beginning in 2011, at the same time extending the leases of two Boeing 767-300ER aircraft to 2011 (to be withdrawn from service coincident with the delivery of the A330s). Two weeks later, the airline announced the lease of an additional A330-200 for delivery in the second quarter of 2010, and negotiated for delivery of one aircraft from the earlier lease agreement to be moved up to the same quarter. In December 2010, Hawaiian ordered an additional six A330-200 aircraft, bringing the fleet total to 15. Further lease agreements were signed with Air Lease Corporation (one aircraft), and three aircraft each from Hong Kong Aviation Capital and Jackson Square Aviation, bringing the A330-200 fleet to twenty-two. In July 2015, Hawaiian announced the lease of an A330-200 from Air Lease Corporation. The purchase of another A330-200 was announced in December 2016.

==== Boeing 787-9 ====
In February 2018, Hawaiian was rumored to be cancelling its order for six A330-800s and replacing them with 787-9s. It was reported that Boeing priced the aircraft at less than $115 million, and possibly less than $100 million, each; the production cost of a 787-9 is between $80 million and $90 million. Boeing Capital also released Hawaiian from three 767-300ER leases in advance; these aircraft were to be transferred to United Airlines. Initially, Hawaiian refuted it cancelled its A330-800 order, but did not dismiss a new deal with Boeing. However, on March 6, 2018, Hawaiian Airlines confirmed the cancellation of the A330-800 order and the signing of a Letter of Intent with Boeing to purchase ten 787-9 aircraft, with options for an additional ten planes; the deal was finalized at the Farnborough Air Show in July 2018. Hawaiian announced on January 4, 2023, that two additional 787-9 aircraft would be added to its order (for a total of 12 787-9 aircraft on order) as part of a deal with Boeing to defer deliveries. Following multiple delays, Hawaiian received its first 787-9 in January 2024 with initial deployment flying to the West Coast. Previously, Hawaiian had been expecting deliveries to start in November 2023.

=== Historical fleet ===
Throughout its history, Hawaiian Airlines has operated a diverse range of aircraft including the following:

== Services ==
=== In-flight services ===
==== Catering ====
Hawaiian provides complimentary and paid beverage service on all of its flights. Meals are not provided on interisland flights because of their short length (30–45 minutes). On its U.S. mainland flights, Hawaiian is one of the only major U.S. airlines to provide complimentary meals in its main cabin (coach class); each meal is made with no preservatives and with all-natural ingredients and is packaged with recyclable materials. In 2009, Hawaiian introduced premium meals in its main cabin, giving passengers the option of having the complimentary meal or paying to upgrade to a premium meal. The premium meals consisted of a variety of high-end Asian cuisine but were later discontinued.

In March 2007, Hawaiian introduced a &quot;tasting menu&quot; or &quot;tapas menu&quot; for its first-class passengers on its U.S. mainland and international flights. The menu consists of twenty entrees set on a rotation, with five available on any given flight. Passengers are provided information on the available entrees for their flight when they board or shortly after takeoff and may choose up to three entrees as part of their inflight meal.

In August 2012, Hawaiian announced an upgrade to its economy class in-flight U.S. mainland service. Among the upgrades were a new menu, a complimentary glass of wine on lunch or dinner flights, and a free tropical cocktail before landing on breakfast flights. This was in contrast to other airlines, which cut back on meal service. According to Hawaiian&#x27;s then-CEO Mark Dunkerley:

&quot;In today&#x27;s competitive world you cannot justify providing complimentary meals on a traditional business model. It simply does not pay for itself... which explains why essentially everybody has taken all that free food off the airplane. We&#x27;re being illogical by actually investing heavily in this area...It&#x27;s part of who we are, and it&#x27;s what makes us different from everybody else.&quot;
Starting December 1, 2017, guests in the main cabin on Hawaiian flights between Hawaiʻi and western U.S. gateway cities will be treated to complimentary meal service exclusively created for the airline&#x27;s new &quot;Pau Hāna Café&quot; brand. &quot;The Pau Hāna Café&quot;, named after the Hawaiian term for &quot;finished work&quot;, is a branded continental breakfast box for brunch and a hot sandwich and side for lunch.

On December 20, 2017, a partnership was announced with Mana Up, the Hawaiian-based accelerator for local consumer packaged goods, to increase the diversity and volume of locally made products served on board.

In February 2024, the airline announced it would offer free in-flight Wi-Fi provided by SpaceX&#x27;s Starlink, making it the first major US airline to offer the satellite-based service. Costs were not disclosed. It came at a time when other airlines were increasing their high-speed offerings. It follows an agreement signed in April 2022 to use the Starlink network that allowed the company to offer inflight wi-fi for the first time.


== Accidents and incidents ==
* On December 23, 2000, a Hawaiian Airlines McDonnell Douglas DC-10 operating HA481 experienced a runway overrun at Faa&#x27;a International Airport in Papeete. An investigation determined that the incident was due to improper spoiler configuration and the flight crew&#x27;s decision to land in a thunderstorm. There were no fatalities.
* On May 1, 2015, a Hawaiian Airlines Boeing 767 operating flight HA24 from Kahului Airport to Oakland, California, returned to the airport because of smoke in the cabin. The passengers were evacuated via the emergency slides. There were two minor injuries.
* On May 15, 2015, a Hawaiian Airlines Boeing 717 operating flight HA118 from Daniel K. Inouye International Airport to Kona International Airport started emitting smoke from one of its engines. It diverted to Kahului Airport, where it was met by fire engines that extinguished the fire. There were no fatalities and no evacuation was ordered.
* On August 13, 2018, a Hawaiian Airlines Airbus A321neo operating flight HA56 experienced a tailstrike upon landing at Los Angeles, causing substantial damage to the aircraft yet no injuries among the 197 passengers and crew members.

<doc id="151848" wikidata="Q1538117" url="?curid=151848" title="Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)">
<text>Human intelligence (HUMINT, pronounced ) is intelligence-gathering by means of human sources and interpersonal communication. It is distinct from more technical intelligence-gathering disciplines, such as signals intelligence (SIGINT), imagery intelligence (IMINT), and measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT). HUMINT can be conducted in a variety of ways, including via espionage, reconnaissance, interrogation, witness interviews, or torture. Although associated with military and intelligence agencies, HUMINT can also apply in various civilian sectors such as law enforcement.

==Overview==

NATO defines HUMINT as &quot;a category of intelligence derived from information collected and provided by human sources.&quot; A typical HUMINT activity consists of interrogations and conversations with persons having access to information. 

As the name suggests, human intelligence is mostly collected by people and is commonly provided via espionage or some other form of covert surveillance. However, there are also overt methods of collection, such as via interrogation of subjects or simply through interviews.

The manner in which HUMINT operations are conducted is dictated by both official protocol and the nature of the source of the information. Within the context of the United States Armed Forces&#x27; military intelligence, HUMINT activity may involve clandestine activities, however these operations are more closely associated with CIA projects. Both counterintelligence and HUMINT include clandestine human intelligence and its associated operational techniques.

== Sources of HUMINT ==
Typically, sources of HUMINT generally include:

* Advisors or foreign internal defense personnel working with host nation forces or populations
* Diplomatic reporting by accredited diplomats
* Espionage clandestine reporting, access agents, couriers, cutouts
* Military attachés
* Non-governmental organizations
* Prisoners of war or detainees
* Refugees
* Routine patrolling (military police, patrols, etc.)
* Special reconnaissance
* Traveler debriefing
The first steps for recruiting HUMINT sources is spotting and assessing a target. Surveillance of targets (e.g., military or other establishments, open source or compromised reference documents) sometimes reveals people with potential access to information, but no clear means of approaching them. With this group, a secondary survey is in order. Headquarters may be able to suggest an approach, perhaps through a third party or through resources not known to the field station.

==Notable HUMINT examples==

* Oleg Penkovsky was a Soviet GRU colonel who served as a source to the United Kingdom and the United States by informing them of the precise knowledge necessary to address rapidly developing military tensions with the Soviet Union.

<doc id="151851" wikidata="Q798993" url="?curid=151851" title="Badfinger">
<text>Badfinger were a Welsh rock band formed in Swansea in 1961. Their best-known lineup consisted of Pete Ham (guitar), Mike Gibbins (drums), Tom Evans (bass), and Joey Molland (guitar). They are recognised for their influence on the 1970s power pop genre. It is estimated that the band sold 14 million records.

Initially known as the Iveys, the band renamed themselves Badfinger, after the working title for the Beatles&#x27; 1967 song &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot; (&quot;Bad Finger Boogie&quot;). From 1968 to 1973, Badfinger recorded five albums for Apple Records and toured extensively, before they became embroiled in the chaos of Apple&#x27;s dissolution.

Badfinger had four consecutive worldwide hits from 1970 to 1972: &quot;Come and Get It&quot; (written and produced by Paul McCartney, 1970), &quot;No Matter What&quot; (produced by Mal Evans, 1970), &quot;Day After Day&quot; (produced by George Harrison, 1971), and &quot;Baby Blue&quot; (produced by Todd Rundgren, 1972). Their song &quot;Without You&quot; (1970) has been recorded many times, and became a US and UK number-one hit for Harry Nilsson in 1972 and a UK number-one for Mariah Carey in 1994.

After Apple Records folded in 1973, Badfinger struggled with a host of legal, managerial, and financial problems mostly due to their fraudulent manager Stan Polley, leading to Ham&#x27;s suicide in 1975. The surviving members struggled to rebuild their personal and professional lives against a backdrop of lawsuits which tied up the songwriters&#x27; royalty payments for years. Their subsequent albums floundered, as Molland and Evans alternated between co-operation and conflict in their attempts to revive and capitalise on the Badfinger legacy. Evans died by suicide in 1983 and Gibbins died from a brain aneurysm in 2005, leaving Molland as the classic line-up&#x27;s only surviving member.

==1961–1969: The Iveys==
===Early days===
The Iveys formed in 1961 in Swansea, Wales from the Panthers, whose line-up consisted of Pete Ham (lead guitar), Ronald &quot;Ron&quot; Griffiths (bass guitar) (b. Ronald Llewellyn Griffiths, 2 October 1946, Swansea), David &quot;Dai&quot; Jenkins (rhythm guitar) (b. David Owen Jenkins, 30 October 1945, Swansea), and Roy Anderson (drums). After playing under various names, including the Black Velvets and the Wild Ones, by 1964 they had settled on the Iveys, after a street in Swansea called Ivey Place.

In March 1965, drummer Mike Gibbins joined the Iveys. The group secured concerts around the Swansea area, opening for prominent British bands such as the Spencer Davis Group, the Who, the Moody Blues, and the Yardbirds.

By June 1966, Bill Collins (the father of actor Lewis Collins) had started to manage the group. In December 1966, the group moved into Collins&#x27;s home at 7 Park Avenue, Golders Green, London, sharing space with an act called the Mojos. The house was terminally overcrowded, so the only place to find any privacy was in a room equipped with a two-track recording machine.

The group performed a wide range of cover tunes on the London circuit, from Motown, blues, and soul to Top 40, psychedelia, and Beatles hits, which garnered interest from record labels. Ray Davies of the Kinks auditioned to produce them, recording three of their songs at a four-track demo studio in London&#x27;s Old Kent Road on 15 January 1967: &quot;Taxi&quot; and &quot;Sausage And Eggs&quot;, songs by Ham; and Griffiths&#x27;s &quot;I Believe in You Girl&quot;. On 8 December 1966, Collins and the group signed a five-year contract giving Collins a 20% share of net receipts, the same as the individual group members, but only after managerial expenses had been deducted. Collins said at the time, &quot;Look, I can&#x27;t promise you lads anything, except blood, sweat and tears.&quot; The group performed occasional concerts backing David Garrick while performing as the Iveys across the United Kingdom throughout the rest of the decade.

In August 1967, Dai Jenkins was asked to leave the group, and was replaced by Liverpudlian guitarist Tom Evans, formerly of Them Calderstones (b. Thomas Evans Jr., 5 June 1947, Liverpool, d. 19 November 1983). Jenkins&#x27;s departure was remembered by Griffiths as being &quot;politely asked if he would step down,&quot; as Jenkins seemed more interested in girls than the music.

===Signing to Apple===
After receiving an invitation from Collins, Beatles roadie/assistant Mal Evans and Apple Records A&amp;R head Peter Asher saw the Iveys perform at the Marquee Club, London, on 25 January 1968. Evans subsequently pushed their demo tapes to every Beatle until he gained approval from all four to sign the group. The demos were accomplished using a mono &quot;sound-on-sound&quot; tape recorder: two individual tracks bouncing each overdub on top of the last. When Evans signed the Iveys to Apple on 23 July 1968, they became the first non-Beatle recording artists on the label. Each of the Iveys were also signed to Apple Corps publishing contracts. The early Iveys sessions for Apple were produced by either Tony Visconti or Evans.

The group&#x27;s first single, &quot;Maybe Tomorrow&quot;, produced by Visconti, was released worldwide on 15 November 1968. It reached the Top Ten in several European countries and Japan, but only #67 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and failed to chart in the UK. The US manager of Apple Records, Ken Mansfield, ordered 400,000 copies of the single—considered to be a bold move at the time in the music business—and pushed for automatic airplay and reviews from newspapers, which he secured. Nevertheless, Mansfield remembered the problems: &quot;We had a great group. We had a great record. We were missing just one thing ... the ability to go out and pick up people, and convince them to put their money on the counter.&quot; A second Tom Evans composition, &quot;Storm in a Teacup&quot;, was included on an Apple EP promoting Wall&#x27;s Ice Cream, along with songs by Apple artists such as James Taylor, Mary Hopkin, and Jackie Lomax. The chart success of &quot;Maybe Tomorrow&quot; in Europe and Japan led to a follow-up single release in those markets in July 1969: Griffiths&#x27;s &quot;Dear Angie&quot;, also produced by Visconti. An LP containing both singles and titled &quot;Maybe Tomorrow&quot; was released only in Italy, Germany, and Japan. This limited release strategy was thought to be the work of Apple Corps president Allen Klein: an Apple Corps press officer, Tony Bramwell, remembered: &quot;[Klein] was saying, &#x27;We&#x27;re not going to issue any more records until I sort out this [Apple Corps] mess.

After the unexpectedly limited releases of &quot;Dear Angie&quot; and &quot;Maybe Tomorrow&quot;, Griffiths complained about Apple&#x27;s handling of the Iveys in an interview for the &quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot; magazine, saying: &quot;We do feel a bit neglected. We keep writing songs for a new single and submitting them to Apple, but they keep sending them back, saying they&#x27;re not good enough.&quot; Paul McCartney read the interview and offered the song &quot;Come and Get It&quot; to the group, although he had written the song for the soundtrack of &quot;The Magic Christian&quot;. Before the recording on Saturday, 2 August 1969, Griffiths remembered the whole group being so excited they couldn&#x27;t sleep. Producing the track in under one hour, McCartney made sure that they copied his own demo note-for-note: &quot;They were a young band ... they said, &#x27;We want to do it a bit different, wanna get our own thing in&#x27;. I said &quot;&#x27;No&quot;, this has gotta be &quot;exactly&quot; like this [McCartney&#x27;s demo], &#x27;cos this is the hit.

McCartney had been commissioned to contribute two other songs to the film&#x27;s soundtrack. After &quot;Come and Get It&quot; was successfully recorded, he offered to produce two of the Iveys&#x27; original compositions to fulfill those commissions, for which he selected &quot;Carry On Till Tomorrow&quot; (commissioned as the main title theme for the film) and &quot;Rock of All Ages&quot; (commissioned as background music for a party scene). All three tracks appeared both in the movie and on its soundtrack album. McCartney then recruited George Martin to provide the string arrangement for &quot;Carry On Till Tomorrow&quot;. As Griffiths fell ill midway through these sessions, Evans played bass on &quot;Rock of All Ages&quot;, &quot;Midnight Sun&quot;, and &quot;Crimson Ship&quot;.

===Name change===
Pending the release of &quot;Come and Get It&quot;, the band and Apple agreed that the band&#x27;s name was too trite for the prevailing music scene, plus the Iveys were sometimes confused with the Ivy League, so a name change was needed. Suggestions were put forward, including the Glass Onion, the Prix, the Cagneys, and Home. Apple Corps&#x27; Neil Aspinall proposed &quot;Badfinger&quot;, in reference to &quot;Bad Finger Boogie&quot;, an early working title of Lennon–McCartney&#x27;s &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;, as John Lennon had hurt his forefinger on a piano and was using only one finger. In December 1969, the band agreed on Badfinger.

Harrison would later state that the band was named after Helga Fabdinger, a stripper the Beatles had known in Hamburg.

==1969–1972: Badfinger==
===Departure of Griffiths and hiring of Molland===
At the end of October 1969, Griffiths, who was the sole married occupant of the communal group&#x27;s home and also was raising a child (b. December 1968), left the group. His responsibilities created friction, mainly between Griffiths&#x27;s wife, Evans, and manager Collins. Griffiths later said: &quot;Tommy [Evans] created the bad blood. He&#x27;d convinced the others that [I was] not one of the boys anymore.&quot; Drummer Gibbins remembered that he wasn&#x27;t even consulted about the decision: &quot;I was considered a nothing head at that point. I wasn&#x27;t even worth conversing with.&quot;

As the release date of &quot;Come and Get It&quot; was approaching, the Iveys looked for a replacement for Griffiths. After unsuccessfully auditioning a number of bassists, they hired guitarist Joey Molland, who was previously with Gary Walker &amp; the Rain, the Masterminds, and the Fruit-Eating Bears. His addition required Evans to shift from rhythm guitar to bass.

===Initial success===
&quot;Come and Get It&quot; was released as a single in December 1969 in the UK, and January 1970 in the US. Selling more than a million copies worldwide, it reached Top Ten throughout the world: #7 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; chart on 18 April 1970, and #4 in the UK. Because the Iveys&#x27; &quot;Maybe Tomorrow&quot; album had been released in only a few markets, the band&#x27;s three songs from &quot;The Magic Christian&quot; soundtrack album were combined with other, older Iveys tracks (including both of the Iveys&#x27; singles and five other songs from &quot;Maybe Tomorrow&quot;) and then released as Badfinger&#x27;s first album &quot;Magic Christian Music&quot; (1970). The album peaked at #55 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart in the US. In addition, Derek Taylor commissioned Les Smithers to photograph the band in March 1970. His photograph has been acquired by the National Portrait Gallery.

New recording sessions for Badfinger also commenced in March 1970, with Mal Evans producing. Two songs were completed, including &quot;No Matter What&quot;, which was rejected by Apple as a potential single. Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick then took over as producer and the band completed its second album in July 1970. During the recordings, the band were sent to Hawaii on 4 June, to appear at a Capitol/Apple Records convention, and then flew to Italy to play concerts in Rome. &quot;No Dice&quot; was released in the US in late 1970, peaking at #28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. The Mal Evans-produced track &quot;No Matter What&quot;, as re-mixed by Emerick, was finally released as a single, and reached numerous Top Ten charts around the world—peaking at #8 in the US and #5 in the UK. An Emerick-produced album track from &quot;No Dice&quot; titled &quot;Without You&quot; became even more successful after Harry Nilsson covered the song in 1972; his version became an international hit, reaching #1 on &quot;Billboard&quot; in the US, and also spending five weeks at the top of the UK chart. The song began as a merger of two separate songs, with the verses penned by Ham and the chorus penned by Evans. The song won Ham and Evans the 1972 Ivor Novello award for &quot;Song of the Year&quot;.

===Signing with Stan Polley===
In April 1970, while in the US scouting prospects for a tour, Collins was introduced to New York businessman Stan Polley, who signed Badfinger to a business management contract in November 1970. Polley established Badfinger Enterprises, Inc., with Stan Poses as vice-president. It bound the band members to various contracts dictating that income from touring, recording, publishing, and even songwriter performance royalties would be directed into holding companies controlled by Polley. It led to a salary arrangement for the band, which various members later complained was inadequate compared to their gross earnings. Gibbins said: &quot;My first impression was, Stan [Polley] is a powerful guy,&quot; while Molland thought that Polley seemed more of a father-figure. At the same time, Polley was also managing Al Kooper, of Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, and Lou Christie.

Although Polley&#x27;s professional reputation was admired, his dubious financial practices eventually contributed to the band&#x27;s downfall. A financial statement prepared by Polley&#x27;s accountants, Sigmund Balaban &amp; Co., for the period from 8 December 1970 to 31 October 1971, showed Polley&#x27;s income from the band: &quot;Salaries and advances to client, $8,339 (Joey Molland), $6,861 (Mike Gibbins), $6,211 (Tom Evans), $5,959 (Pete Ham). Net corporation profit, $24,569. Management commission, $75,744 (Stan Polley)&quot;. Although it is not known if the band members saw the statement, Collins certainly had, as his handwriting was on the document.

Badfinger toured the US for three months in late 1970 and were generally well-received, although the band was already weary of persistent comparisons to the Beatles. &quot;The thing that impressed me so much was how similar their voices were to The Beatles,&quot; Tony Visconti (producer, &quot;Maybe Tomorrow&quot;) said; &quot;I sometimes had to look over the control board down into the studio to make sure John and Paul weren&#x27;t singing lead vocals ...&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Mike Saunders opined in a rave review of &quot;No Dice&quot; in 1970: &quot;It&#x27;s as if John, Paul, George, and Ringo had been reincarnated as Joey, Pete, Tom, and Mike of Badfinger.&quot; Media comparisons between them and the Beatles would continue throughout Badfinger&#x27;s career.

===Apple session work===
Various members of Badfinger also participated in sessions for fellow Apple Records labelmates, most notably playing acoustic guitar and percussion on much of Harrison&#x27;s &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; triple album (1970), including the hit singles &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Pity&quot;, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;. and &quot;What Is Life&quot;. Ham and Evans also provided backing vocals on Ringo Starr&#x27;s Harrison-produced single, &quot;It Don&#x27;t Come Easy&quot;. Evans and Molland then performed on Lennon&#x27;s album &quot;Imagine&quot; (1971), although Molland has said that their tracks were not used. Most famously, on 26 July 1971, all four members of Badfinger arrived at New York&#x27;s John F. Kennedy International Airport, to rehearse for Harrison&#x27;s Concert for Bangladesh, which took place on 1 August 1971. Ham duetted on acoustic guitar with Harrison on &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; during the concert.

===&quot;Straight Up&quot;===

In 1971, the group rented Clearwell Castle, in Gloucestershire, living and recording there. They finished recording their third album, again with Emerick as a producer, but the tapes were once again rejected by Apple, because Apple felt that Badfinger needed a producer who could bring a more polished sound to the recordings. Thus, George Harrison himself took over as producer in spring of 1971, including Leon Russell and Klaus Voormann in the sessions as well. Commenting on the recording of the dual slide guitars on &quot;Day After Day&quot;, Molland remembered: &quot;Pete and I had done the backing track, and George came in the studio and asked if we&#x27;d mind if he played ... It took hours, and hours, and hours, to get those two guitars in sync&quot;. However, Harrison stopped the sessions after recording just four songs because of his commitments to The Concert for Bangladesh, which Harrison included Badfinger in as well. After the concert, Harrison was tied up with producing the tapes from that concert, and so was unable to resume with Badfinger. Instead, the Badfinger album was completed by Todd Rundgren, who mixed the tapes from the Harrison sessions, re-recorded the songs from the Emerick sessions, and also produced some newer, previously unrecorded songs.

The album, ultimately titled &quot;Straight Up&quot;, was released in the US in December 1971, and spawned two successful singles: &quot;Day After Day&quot; (&quot;Billboard&quot; number four), which sold over a million worldwide, and &quot;Baby Blue&quot; (US number 14). The album reached number 31 on the US charts. However, the disintegration of Apple Records in Britain led to &quot;Baby Blue&quot; never being released as a UK single, although a release number and date had already been assigned to it.

The band embarked on a US tour in 1972, but after problems with Evans, Gibbins left and was replaced for the tour by drummer Rob Stawinsky, who was described as Badfinger&#x27;s &quot;solid, new drummer&quot;. Stawinsky was not used after the tour, though, and Gibbins rejoined the band in September.

==1972–1984: Decline and struggles==
===End of Apple===
At the start of 1972, Badfinger were contracted for one last album with Apple Records. Despite Badfinger&#x27;s success, Apple was facing troubled times and its operations were being cut back by Klein. According to Molland, Polley told the band that Klein wanted to cut Badfinger&#x27;s royalty rate and make them pay for their own studio time. By this time, manager Polley was openly suspected of financial mismanagement by his other clients, Christie and music arranger Charlie Calello. A series of allegations also represented Polley as a one-time &quot;bagman&quot; for the Mafia.

Sessions for Badfinger&#x27;s fourth and final album for Apple, &quot;Ass&quot;, had begun as far back as early 1972 and would continue at five recording studios over the next year. Rundgren was originally hired to produce but quit in a financial dispute during the first week. The band then produced itself, but Apple rejected their version of the album. Finally, Badfinger hired Chris Thomas to co-produce and complete the project. In the meanwhile, Polley negotiated a deal with Warner Bros. Records, that required a new album from the band every six months over a three-year period. By this time Evans had become suspicious of Polley&#x27;s oversight, but the band nevertheless signed the deal. Released in 1973, the &quot;Ass&quot; front cover featured Evans&#x27;s idea: a jackass staring at a huge dangling carrot. The &quot;Ass&quot; release was further stalled because of legal wrangling, with Polley using Molland&#x27;s unsigned song publishing as a negotiating ploy. Attempting to sweep discrepancies under the carpet to secure the LP&#x27;s release Apple attributed the songwriting credits to &quot;Badfinger&quot;. But both &quot;Ass&quot; (US number 122), and its accompanying lead single, &quot;Apple of My Eye&quot;, fell short of reaching the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

===Move to Warner Bros. Records===

After the Apple contract had been fulfilled, Polley signed the band to a management contract demanding two albums a year. Poses, as vice-president of Badfinger Enterprises Inc., repeatedly told the band not to sign the contract. Polley organised a $3 million recording contract with Warner Bros., telling the band, &quot;You&#x27;re all millionaires!&quot; The deal gave the band 12% of retail in the US—the price Warner Brothers received from record outlets—and 8.5% for the rest of the world, with a $225,000 advance for every album delivered.

Only six weeks after the &quot;Ass&quot; sessions had been completed, Badfinger re-entered the studio to begin recording material for its first Warner Bros. release, &quot;Badfinger&quot; (the intended title, &quot;For Love or Money,&quot; was omitted from the album pressings). The album was produced by Thomas, even though the songs were being written in the studio as they recorded. &quot;Ass&quot; and &quot;Badfinger&quot; were released almost simultaneously, and the accompanying singles from &quot;Badfinger&quot;, &quot;Love Is Easy&quot; (UK) and &quot;I Miss You&quot; (US), were unsuccessful. Badfinger did manage to retain some US fan support as a result of their touring schedule. A March 1974 concert at the Cleveland Agora was recorded on 16-track tape for a possible live album release, even though the performance was deemed unsatisfactory at the time.

Following the American tours, Badfinger recorded &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; at the Caribou Ranch recording studio in Colorado, and at George Martin&#x27;s AIR Studios in London. The album was well received by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and other periodicals upon its release in October 1974. However, over the previous year, Warner Brothers&#x27; publishing arm had become increasingly troubled by a lack of communication from Polley regarding the status of an escrow account of advance funds. Per their contract, Polley was to deposit $250,000 into a mutually accessible account for safekeeping, which both Warner Publishing and the band could potentially access. But Polley did not reveal the account&#x27;s whereabouts to Warner Publishing, and he reportedly ignored Warner&#x27;s demands to do so. As a result, in a letter dated 30 April 1974, WB&#x27;s publishing arm terminated its relationship with Badfinger, but, other than having the group sign some new contracts, Polley took no action to resolve Warner&#x27;s publishing issue. Consistent with the termination notice, on 14 August 1974, Warner&#x27;s publishing arm refused to accept the tapes of &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, but the album was later released anyway.

===Turmoil and personnel changes===
Crises in band management, money, and band leadership were creating growing frictions within Badfinger. Molland&#x27;s wife, Kathie, had been taking a more assertive role in the band&#x27;s politics, which did not endear her to the rest of the band, particularly Ham. She remembered complaining that even though the band had hit records, they &quot;still didn&#x27;t have a fridge, and didn&#x27;t have a TV&quot;. However, one of the band&#x27;s assistants said, &quot;Kathie was a wishful Linda McCartney. If she had her way, she would have ended up part of the band.&quot; Just before the start of rehearsals for an October 1974 UK tour, Ham suddenly quit Badfinger during a management meeting, standing up and shouting &quot;I don&#x27;t want Kathie managing the band! I&#x27;m leaving&quot;. He found a cottage in Wales, where he hoped to build a studio. He was quickly replaced by guitarist/keyboardist Bob Jackson, who was then idle after previous involvement with the Fortunes. During Ham&#x27;s three-week hiatus from the band, Polley tried to interest record companies in Ham as a solo act, but under pressure from Warner Brothers, Ham rejoined the band in time for the tour, as the company made it clear that it would have little to no interest in promoting Badfinger if Ham was not a part of it. Jackson remained as full-time keyboardist, making the band a quintet. After the UK tour, Molland quit of his own accord to pursue a solo career in December 1974.
With the Warner situation becoming increasingly unstable, Polley&#x27;s next ploy was to press the band to pass up a US tour to go back into Apple Recording Studios to record its third album under the Warner Brothers contract. Because Thomas, the producer of Badfinger&#x27;s last three albums, thought that the band was rushing into the studio too quickly, Polley hired Kiss producers Kenny Kerner and Richie Wise to produce the album. Over only 11 days at the Apple studios, tracks were recorded for the &quot;Head First&quot; album (eventually released in 2000), and rough mixes were distributed to the musicians and Warner Brothers Records in America. However, because Warner&#x27;s publishing arm had already filed a lawsuit against Polley and Badfinger in the L.A. Superior Court on 10 December 1974, the album tapes could not be formally accepted by Warner Bros. – and Warner executives also thought the rough tapes sounded &quot;thrown together in a hurry&quot; in &quot;an obvious attempt [to] extract further advances from us&quot;. The legal action also led to the company stopping the promotion of &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; after seven weeks, and ending its distribution worldwide, thus completely halting Badfinger&#x27;s career.

===Ham&#x27;s suicide and break-up===
With their current album suddenly withdrawn and their follow-up rejected, Badfinger spent the early months of 1975 trying to figure out how to proceed under the unclear legal situation. Their March 1975 salary cheques did not clear, and the April cheques never arrived. Panic set in, especially for Ham, who had recently bought a £30,000 house in Woking, Surrey, and whose girlfriend was expecting a child. According to Jackson, the band tried to continue without Polley&#x27;s involvement by contacting booking agents and prospective managers throughout London, but they were routinely declined because of their restrictive contracts with Polley and impending legal actions. Ham reportedly tried on many occasions to contact Polley by telephone during the early months of 1975, but was never able to reach him.

On the night of 23 April 1975, Ham received a phone call from the United States, telling him that all his money had disappeared. Later that night he met Tom Evans and they went to The White Hart Pub in Surrey together, where Ham drank ten whiskies. Evans drove him home at three o&#x27;clock on the morning of 24 April 1975. Ham hanged himself in his garage studio in Woking later that morning. His suicide note—addressed to his girlfriend, Anne Herriot, and her son, Blair—blamed Polley for much of his despair and inability to cope with his disappointments in life. The note read: &quot;Anne, I love you. Blair, I love you. I will not be allowed to love and trust everybody. This is better. Pete. P.S. Stan Polley is a soulless bastard. I will take him with me&quot;. Ham died at the age of 27. He had shown growing signs of mental illness over the past months, with Gibbins remembering Ham burning cigarettes on his hands and arms. He was cremated at the Morriston Crematorium, Swansea; his ashes were spread in the memorial gardens. Ham&#x27;s daughter, Petera, was born one month after his death. In May, Warner Bros terminated its contract with Badfinger, and Badfinger dissolved. Around that time, Apple also deleted all of Badfinger&#x27;s albums from its catalogue.

===Post-Badfinger===
Gibbins joined the Flying Aces, and performed session drumming for various Welsh acts, including Bonnie Tyler&#x27;s international hit &quot;It&#x27;s a Heartache&quot;. Evans and Jackson became part of a group called the Dodgers. They released three British singles on Island Records in 1976. &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Be Wrong&quot; was the act&#x27;s only US release, but failed to chart. Subsequently, the management of the Dodgers fired Evans in 1977 for insubordination and deleted all his performances from the group&#x27;s subsequent album recordings (later released as &quot;Love on the Rebound&quot;). The group finally broke up in 1978, after which Jackson joined the Searchers and the David Byron Band. Molland started a band in 1975 with Colosseum&#x27;s Mark Clarke and Humble Pie&#x27;s Jerry Shirley using the moniker Natural Gas. They performed a few concerts as the opening act for Peter Frampton in 1976. Natural Gas released a self-titled album and three singles, but none managed to chart.

By 1977, both Molland and Evans were out of the music business. Molland later described his dire economic circumstances: &quot;Thank God I had guitars and I was able to sell some of that stuff. We were flat broke, and that&#x27;s happened to me three times, where my wife and I have had to sell off everything and go and stay with her parents or do whatever. I installed carpeting for a while in Los Angeles and stuff like that. You do what you&#x27;ve got to do to survive.&quot; In London, Evans briefly had jobs insulating pipes, and driving a taxi. Collins was having trouble paying the lease on the group&#x27;s two-room rehearsal studio at No. 6 Denmark Street, London. After advertising for new occupants, he was contacted by Malcolm McLaren, manager of the Sex Pistols, who gave Collins £650 () and a Fender Rhodes piano as down payment.

===A reunion, another break-up, and Evans&#x27;s suicide===
Later in 1977, United States–based drummer Kenny Harck and guitarist Joe Tansin recruited Molland to start a new band. When they needed a bass player, Molland suggested Evans, who joined after a visit to California in 1978. Encouragement from the Elektra record company led to the decision to rename the new band Badfinger. Their &quot;comeback&quot; album, &quot;Airwaves&quot;, was released in 1979. Harck was fired from the band during the sessions and Tansin left the band immediately after the album was completed. To promote the album Molland and Evans recruited Tony Kaye (ex-Yes) on keyboards, and Peter Clarke on drums from Stealers Wheel. The single &quot;Love is Gonna Come at Last&quot; from &quot;Airwaves&quot; reached No. 69 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. With Glenn Sherba added on second guitar and Richard Bryans (from the band Aviary) replacing Clarke on drums, Badfinger released their second post-Ham album, &quot;Say No More&quot;, in 1981, with the album being distributed by Radio Records. The second single, &quot;Hold On&quot;, reached number 56 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

The Warner Brothers lawsuit against Polley lasted four years, with Polley finally being forced to pay a &quot;substantial sum&quot; back to the company in late 1978. However, Polley managed to retain approximately half of the original $100,000 escrow payment, representing about three albums&#x27; worth of payments. In 1987, detective John Hansen, working for the Riverside District Attorney&#x27;s office, started an investigation into fraudulent bank dealings by Polley.

After the failure of &quot;Say No More&quot;, Molland and Evans operated rival touring bands, each using the name &quot;Badfinger&quot;, during 1982 and 1983, which created even more personal and professional conflict. In 1982, Evans teamed with pre-1975 Badfinger members Jackson and Gibbins, first adding guitarist Adam Allen, and then, in the fall of 1982, adding guitarists Reed Kailing of the Grass Roots and (Chicago&#x27;s) Donnie Dacus.

In 1983 Evans and Jackson were joined by post-1975 Badfinger members Kaye and Sherba, with drummer Lenny Campanaro. Meanwhile, for his Badfinger concerts, Molland had teamed with post-1975 member Tansin. Evans and Jackson signed a management contract with Milwaukee businessman John Cass, which led to a disastrous tour and a $5 million lawsuit, which was finally settled on 21 October 1985, in Cass&#x27;s favour, although both musicians argued that their responsibilities of the contract could not be enforced because certain management obligations had not been performed. Early in 1983, Evans and Jackson, with assistance from new member Al Wodtke, completed four demos in Minneapolis, under the name &quot;Badfinger&quot;. The demos included Jackson&#x27;s &quot;I Won&#x27;t Forget You&quot;, a tribute to Ham. The songs were briefly promoted but failed to generate strong interest, despite the involvement of Don Powell, who was a manager for musicians such as David Bowie and Stevie Wonder.

On the night of 18 November 1983, Evans and Molland had an extensive and heated argument on the telephone regarding past Badfinger income still in escrow from the Apple era, and the &quot;Without You&quot; songwriting royalties Evans was now receiving, which Molland, former manager Collins and Gibbins all wanted a share of. Following this argument, Evans hanged himself in the garden at his home in New Haw, Surrey, on the morning of 19 November 1983. He was cremated at the Woking Crematorium, Surrey, on 25 November 1983.

==Since 1984==
In 1984, Molland, Gibbins and Jackson reunited as Badfinger, along with Al Wodtke and Randy Anderson, playing 31 dates as part of a &quot;20th Anniversary of the British Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Tour&quot;, which included Gerry and the Pacemakers, the Troggs, Billy J. Kramer and Herman&#x27;s Hermits. In 1986, Molland and Gibbins resumed sporadic touring as Badfinger, with Randy Anderson on guitar and either Mark Healey or A. J. Nicholas on bass. Gibbins left for good in February 1990 following appearances at three auto shows in Columbus, Ohio, West Allis, Wisconsin, and Flint, Michigan.

All four Badfinger albums on Apple, which were deleted from release in 1975, have been reissued twice; first in the early 1990s as part of a revival of the Apple catalogue and again in 2010, when the albums were available individually or as part of the 17-disc Apple Box Set. The sole Iveys&#x27; album &quot;Maybe Tomorrow&quot; was also reissued in the early 1990s but was not part of the 2010 campaign.

Badfinger&#x27;s first collection titled &quot;Shine On&quot;, spanning their two Warner Brothers albums, was released in the UK in 1989. In 1990, Rhino Records released another Warner Brothers-era compilation, &quot;The Best of Badfinger, Vol. 2&quot;, including material from both &quot;Airwaves&quot; and the previously unreleased &quot;Head First&quot;. A greatest hits collection taken from Badfinger&#x27;s four albums on Apple, &quot;Come and Get It: The Best of Badfinger&quot;, appeared in 1995 on the EMI/Apple/Capitol label, which was the band&#x27;s first release since 1973&#x27;s &quot;Ass&quot; to be assigned a standard Apple catalogue number: SAPCOR 28. A more comprehensive collection, with tracks from both record labels, was the 2000s &quot;The Very Best of Badfinger&quot;. In 2013, a new compilation titled &quot;Timeless&quot; was issued by EMI/Universal both to capitalise on the use of &quot;Baby Blue&quot; in the finale of &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; and to include the 2010 remastered versions of Badfinger&#x27;s songs on a greatest-hits album.

In 1990, Rykodisc released &quot;Day After Day: Live&quot;, billed as a Badfinger live recording from 1974. The album underwent substantial re-recording, and a rearranged track order by the album&#x27;s producer, Molland, and had a mixed critical reaction. The album&#x27;s release then sparked a lawsuit filed by Molland. The band&#x27;s accounting firm, collecting for a 1985 court order settlement, had re-adjusted against Molland&#x27;s Apple royalty income by deducting away the percentage amounts of that court order, then reimbursing those amounts to the other Badfinger parties. The Rykodisc contract did not include artist royalty payments, because Molland had advised Rykodisc he would take care of that distribution himself under another company name. Molland subsequently sued the other members and their estates to recoup his expenses plus a producer&#x27;s royalty. He was awarded a partial settlement, as the judge stated the evidence against Molland was insufficient to justify a severe penalty, also noting that since both parties had conceded the original tapes were of poor quality, Molland&#x27;s salvaging of them to a commercial level merited consideration.

After the success of Mariah Carey&#x27;s recording of &quot;Without You&quot; in 1994, Molland and Gibbins collected an award from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) in 1995, incurring the anger of the Ham and Evans families.

While in a 1988 readers poll for &quot;Goldmine&quot; magazine, &quot;Straight Up&quot; (1971) ranked as the most-requested CD release among out-of-print albums, the album made it to CD only in 1993. In 1995, Molland was paid to re-record the 10 most popular Badfinger songs. These recordings were variously packaged in the market, often showing the original 1970s line-up of the band with little or no disclaiming information, despite Molland being the only original member of Badfinger who performed. A detailed biography of Badfinger by Dan Matovina was published in 1998, titled &quot;Without You: The Tragic Story of Badfinger&quot;. The 2000 update of the book was accompanied by a CD of rare material and interviews.

In 2000, a rough mix version of &quot;Head First&quot; (taken from an open-reel tape prepared by Apple engineer Phil McDonald in December 1974) was released on CD. (According to Dan Matovina, Warner Brothers could not locate the original master tapes for remixing at that time, but they were eventually found about 10 years later.) In 2002, Gibbins released a two-disc set of a Badfinger performance recorded in Indiana, on 19 October 1982, which had been captured on a basic cassette recorder, which was initially (and inaccurately) titled &quot;Live 83 – DBA-BFR&quot;. The band at that time had consisted of Evans, Gibbins, Jackson, Kailing and Dacus.

In 2003, and again in 2006, two separate CDs of related Apple Publishing music, &quot;94 Baker Street&quot;, and &quot;An Apple a Day&quot;, were released. The CDs contain nine songs by the Iveys. In 2008, another CD of Apple-related songs, &quot;Treacle Toffee World: Further Adventures into the Pop Psych Sounds from the Apple Era 1967–1969&quot;, included two more Iveys demos.

By 2013, the issue of royalty payments had been resolved in court. The main songwriter receives 32 percent of publishing royalties and 25 percent of ASCAP royalties. The other band members and Collins share the rest. Revenue from album sales is shared equally with 20% going to each member as well as Collins. In 1994, the year in which Mariah Carey covered the song &quot;Without You&quot;, the royalties for Ham&#x27;s estate spiked up to US$500,000.

==Post-Badfinger solo activities==

Following the demise of Badfinger, each of the three living former members (Joey Molland, Bob Jackson, and Mike Gibbins) continued to record and play new music. Molland has released five solo albums, &quot;After the Pearl&quot; (1983), &quot;The Pilgrim&quot; (1992), &quot;This Way Up&quot; (2001), &quot;Return to Memphis&quot; (2013), and &quot;Be True To Yourself&quot; (2020). In 1998 he released a collection of demos called &quot;Demos Old and New&quot; on his own label, Independent Artists. In 1995, Jackson re-joined the Fortunes, where he sang lead, and they consistently performed Badfinger songs in their set. In 1996, Gibbins contributed two songs to the compilation album, &quot;Young Savage Florida&quot; (1996). He later released four solo albums through Exile Music: &quot;A Place in Time&quot; in 1998, &quot;More Annoying Songs&quot; (featuring ex-Iveys member Griffiths singing on 2 tracks) in 2002, &quot;Archeology&quot; (Griffiths on 1 track) in 2005, and &quot;In the Meantime&quot;, also in 2005. The latter included different re-recordings of both the Badfinger hit &quot;Come and Get It&quot; and Gibbins&#x27;s &quot;In the Meantime&quot;, originally from the &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; album in 1974.

Also, posthumous collections were released for both Pete Ham and Tom Evans. In both 1997 and 1999, two collections of Ham&#x27;s home recordings were released: &quot;7 Park Avenue&quot; (1997), and &quot;Golders Green&quot; (1999), with extra instruments added by Jackson and Griffiths.&lt;ref name=&quot;BIGO/MatthewLewis&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, a posthumous Evans album was released, &quot;Over You: The Final Tracks&quot;, which was produced by Evans&#x27;s friend and songwriting partner Rod Roach.

Former manager Bill Collins died in August 2002, aged 89, and on 4 October 2005, Mike Gibbins died in his sleep at his home in Oviedo, Florida from a brain aneurysm. He was 56, had been married twice and had three sons.

In June 2006, a Badfinger convention took place in Swansea, featuring a performance by Bob Jackson. The event brought together Bob Jackson, Ron Griffiths, and some members of the Ham, Evans and Gibbins families. On 1 January 2008, BBC Wales broadcast a one-hour documentary about Badfinger.

On 27 April 2013 an official blue plaque was unveiled by the Swansea City Council to honour Pete Ham in his home town of Swansea. The public event was also attended by two former members of the original Badfinger band, the Iveys, Ron Griffiths and Dai Jenkins, plus former Badfinger member, Bob Jackson. The plaque honored Pete and all the Iveys and Badfinger members of Pete Ham&#x27;s lifetime. A concert followed the unveiling of the plaque featuring former Badfinger members Bob Jackson and Al Wodtke.

Joey Molland&#x27;s wife, Kathie Molland, died on 24 March 2009, and Stan Polley died on 20 July 2009 in California.

Former member Joey Molland continues to tour under the name Joey Molland&#x27;s Badfinger in the United States. In 2015, former member Bob Jackson formed his own version of Badfinger with current members Andy Nixon, Michael Healey, and Ted Duggan to honour the memory of Pete Ham, Tom Evans, and Mike Gibbins and undertook a 23 date UK theatre tour, playing to over 20,000 people. In 2016 the band continued to play UK shows.

<text>Benjamin Charles Harper (born October 28, 1969) is an American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. Harper plays an eclectic mix of blues, folk, soul, reggae, and rock music, and he is known for his guitar-playing skills, vocals, live performances, and activism. He has released twelve studio albums, mostly through Virgin Records, and has toured internationally.

Harper is a three-time Grammy Award winner and seven-time nominee, with awards for Best Pop Instrumental Performance and Best Traditional Soul Gospel Album in 2004 and Best Blues Album in 2013.

At the 40th Blues Music Awards ceremony, Harper&#x27;s joint composition with Charlie Musselwhite, &quot;No Mercy in This Land&quot;, was named Song of the Year.

==Early life==
Harper was born in Pomona, California. His late father, Leonard Harper, was of African-American ancestry, and his mother, Ellen Harper Verdries ( Chase), is Jewish. His maternal great-grandmother was a Russian-Lithuanian Jew. His parents divorced when he was five years old, and he grew up with his mother&#x27;s family. Harper has two younger brothers, Joel and Peter Harper.

Harper began playing guitar as a child. His maternal grandparents&#x27; music store, the Folk Music Center and Museum (Claremont, CA), laid a foundation of folk and blues for the artist, complemented by regular patrons Leonard Cohen, Taj Mahal, John Darnielle, and David Lindley and quotes of William Shakespeare and Robert Frost made often by his grandfather.

In 1978, at the age of 9, Harper attended Bob Marley&#x27;s performance in Burbank, California, where Marley was joined by former bandmate Peter Tosh for the encore. It was, according to Harper, an important influence.

==Career==
At the age of twelve, Harper played his first gig. During the 1980s, in his teen years, Harper began to play the slide guitar, mimicking the style of Robert Johnson. Harper refined his style, taking up the Weissenborn slide guitar. Harper was offered an invitation by Taj Mahal to tour with the artist. They recorded Taj Mahal&#x27;s album &quot;Follow the Drinking Gourd&quot;, released in November 1990, and toured Hawaii.

In 1992, Harper recorded the LP &quot;Pleasure and Pain&quot; with folk multi-instrumentalist Tom Freund. After this limited-edition record, Harper secured a lifetime record deal with Virgin Records. In 1993, he toured venues in California and France with his band, Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals, and performed with Taj Majal at Austin City Limits.

In 1994, Harper released his debut album, &quot;Welcome to the Cruel World&quot; and toured the US and Canada with the Innocent Criminals. In November of the same year, he performed two solo shows in Spain.

He released his second album, &quot;Fight For Your Mind&quot;, in 1995, with Juan Nelson on bass, which became a college radio favorite and included several songs that Harper has played live throughout his career. The same year, the band expanded their reach to Europe and performed in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Canada, and a handful of US dates. His music received a great deal of airplay and critical acclaim in Europe and was widely played in Australia (first on Triple J radio).

In 1999, at the Santa Barbara Bowl, Harper met Jack Johnson and sent a demo tape of Johnson&#x27;s songs to his producer, J. P. Plunier, who then produced Johnson&#x27;s first album, &quot;Brushfire Fairytales&quot;, in December 2000. Jack Johnson became the opening act in late February 2001 for the last 23 cities of Ben Harper&#x27;s “Innocent Criminals” tour of the United States.
In 2002, Harper was one of the featured singers covering Motown hits by Marvin Gaye in the documentary, &quot;Standing in the Shadows of Motown&quot; (a history of The Funk Brothers). Harper was featured on the album &quot;True Love&quot; by Toots and the Maytals, which won the Grammy Award in 2004 for Best Reggae Album, and showcased many notable musicians including Willie Nelson, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Trey Anastasio, Gwen Stefani / No Doubt, Bonnie Raitt, Manu Chao, The Roots, Ryan Adams, Keith Richards, Toots Hibbert, Paul Douglas, Jackie Jackson, Ken Boothe, and The Skatalites. In 2003, Harper was French &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Artist of the Year (&quot;Artiste De L&#x27;Année&quot;), and his Australian tour that year for &quot;Diamonds on the Inside&quot; was highly successful with record sales. On April 3, 2004, Harper and Jack Johnson performed with Toots and the Maytals on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (season 29, episode 16), a show hosted by Donald Trump.

In October 2004, Harper participated in the Vote for Change concert tour organized to benefit Moveon.org and encourage people in the swing states to vote during the 2004 U.S. presidential election. In the same month, Harper contributed a live recording of the song &quot;Oppression&quot; to &quot;For The Lady&quot;, a benefit album for jailed Nobel Peace Prize winner and Burmese pro-democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi. In 2006, Harper released the double album &quot;Both Sides of the Gun&quot; which debuted at number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Though uncredited, he appears briefly in the 2006 David Lynch film &quot;Inland Empire&quot;, alongside his wife Laura Dern.

Harper is part of the No Nukes group, which is against the expansion of nuclear power. In 2007 the group recorded a music video of a version of the Buffalo Springfield song &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot;. Harper&#x27;s collaboration &quot;Boa Sorte/Good Luck&quot; with Brazilian singer Vanessa da Mata peaked at #1 in Brazil and Portugal. In Brazil it also won a highly coveted Prêmio Multishow for &quot;Best Song&quot; in 2008. Also in 2008, Harper participated in the benefit album &quot;Songs for Tibet&quot;.

On August 27, 2010, it was reported that Harper had formed a band called Fistful of Mercy with Dhani Harrison and Joseph Arthur. Fistful of Mercy released their debut record, &quot;As I Call You Down&quot;, on October 5, 2010.

On October 1, 2012, an album from Harper with Charlie Musselwhite was announced titled &quot;Get Up!&quot; on Stax Records / Concord Music Group. The official release date for the album was January 29, 2013. &quot;Get Up!&quot; was recorded in Los Angeles and produced by Harper. It is Harper&#x27;s 12th studio album and first recording since 2011&#x27;s &quot;Give Till It&#x27;s Gone&quot; (Virgin).

In December 2012, it was announced that Harper had co-produced lead vocalist Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks first solo rock album &quot;Mother&quot;. It was released on May 7, 2013.

On March 20, 2019, Mavis Staples announced the album &quot;We Get By&quot;, featuring eleven tracks written and produced by Harper. The title track, which features Harper on vocals and in the music video, was released on May 15, 2019.

In 2020 Harper released &quot;Winter Is for Lovers&quot;, an album recorded with solo Monteleone lap steel songs. &quot;It started out as an exploration of steel guitar,&quot; Harper told &quot;Acoustic Guitar&quot; magazine in a 2020 interview, &quot;&quot;Winter Is for Lovers&quot; is written as one piece of music; let&#x27;s define that in the way that the old classical guitarists would have, on a single guitar (the Monteleone lap steel).&quot;

On June 9, 2021, Harper&#x27;s longtime bassist, collaborator, and Innocent Criminals member, Juan Nelson, died at the age 62. Harper paid tribute to him, stating on Twitter: &quot;Beloved husband, father, musical genius, BHIC band member of 27 years, and the finest man I&#x27;ve ever known. It&#x27;s near impossible for me to put words to this pain and loss. Rest in Glory our beloved Reverend Juan.&quot; No cause of death has been confirmed.

<doc id="151855" wikidata="Q44200" url="?curid=151855" title="Billy the Kid">
<text>Henry McCarty (September 17 or November 23, 1859July 14, 1881), alias William H. Bonney, better known as Billy the Kid, was an American outlaw and gunfighter of the Old West who was linked to nine murders: four for which he was solely responsible, and five in which he may have played a role alongside others. He is also noted for his involvement in New Mexico&#x27;s Lincoln County War.

McCarty was orphaned at the age of 15. His first arrest was for stealing food at the age of 16 in 1875. Ten days later, he robbed a Chinese laundry and was arrested again but escaped shortly afterwards. He fled from New Mexico Territory into neighboring Arizona Territory, making himself both an outlaw and a federal fugitive. In 1877, he began to call himself &quot;William H. Bonney&quot;.

After killing a blacksmith during an altercation in August 1877, Bonney became a wanted man in Arizona and returned to New Mexico, where he joined a group of cattle rustlers. He became well known in the region when he joined the Regulators and took part in the Lincoln County War of 1878. He and two other Regulators were later charged with killing three men, including Lincoln County Sheriff William J. Brady and one of his deputies.

Bonney&#x27;s notoriety grew in December 1880 when the &quot;Las Vegas Gazette&quot;, in Las Vegas, New Mexico, and &quot;The Sun&quot;, in New York City, carried stories about his crimes. Sheriff Pat Garrett captured Bonney later that month. In April 1881, Bonney was tried for and convicted of Brady&#x27;s murder, and was sentenced to hang in May of that year. He escaped from jail on April 28, killing two sheriff&#x27;s deputies in the process, and evaded capture for more than two months. Garrett shot and killed Bonney, by then aged 21, in Fort Sumner on July 14, 1881.

During the decades following his death, legends grew that Bonney had survived, and a number of men claimed to be him. Billy the Kid remains one of the most notorious figures from the era, whose life and likeness have been frequently dramatized in Western popular culture.
He has been a feature of more than 50 movies and several television series.

==Early life==
Henry McCarty was born to parents of Irish Catholic ancestry, Catherine () and Patrick McCarty, in New York City. While his birth year has been confirmed as 1859, the exact date of his birth has been disputed as either September 17 or November 23 of that year. There is uncertainty among historians about the exact place and date of McCarty&#x27;s birth. Census records indicate that his younger brother Joseph McCarty was born in 1863.

Following the death of her husband, Catherine McCarty and her sons moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, where she met William Henry Harrison Antrim. The McCarty family moved with Antrim to Wichita, Kansas in 1870. After moving again a few years later, Catherine married Antrim on March 1, 1873, at the First Presbyterian Church in Santa Fe, New Mexico Territory, and the McCarty boys served as witnesses. Shortly afterward, the family moved from Santa Fe to Silver City, New Mexico and Joseph adopted Antrim&#x27;s surname. Shortly before McCarty&#x27;s mother died of tuberculosis on September 16, 1874, William Antrim abandoned the McCarty boys, leaving them orphans.

===First crimes===

McCarty was 14 years old when his mother died. Sarah Brown, the owner of a boarding house, gave him room and board in exchange for work. On September 16, 1875, McCarty was caught stealing food. Ten days later, McCarty and George Schaefer robbed a Chinese laundry, stealing clothing and two pistols. McCarty was charged with theft and was jailed. He escaped two days later and became a fugitive, as reported in the &quot;Silver City Herald&quot; the next day, the first story published about him. McCarty located his stepfather and stayed with him until Antrim threw him out; McCarty stole clothing and guns from him. It was the last time the two saw each other.

After leaving Antrim, McCarty traveled to southeastern Arizona Territory, where he worked as a ranch hand and gambled his wages in nearby gaming houses. In 1876, he was hired as a ranch hand by well-known rancher Henry Hooker. During this time, McCarty became acquainted with John R. Mackie, a Scottish-born criminal and former U.S. Cavalry private who, following his discharge, remained near the U.S. Army post at Camp Grant in Arizona. The two men soon began stealing horses from local soldiers. McCarty became known as &quot;Kid Antrim&quot; because of his youth, slight build, clean-shaven appearance, and personality.

At some point in 1877, McCarty began to refer to himself by the name &quot;William H. Bonney&quot;. On August 17, 1877, Bonney was at a saloon in the village of Bonita when he got into an argument with Francis P. &quot;Windy&quot; Cahill, a blacksmith who reportedly had bullied him and on more than one occasion called him a &quot;pimp&quot;. Bonney in turn called Cahill a &quot;son of a bitch&quot;, whereupon Cahill threw Bonney to the floor and the two struggled for Bonney&#x27;s revolver. Bonney shot and mortally wounded Cahill. A witness said, &quot;[Billy] had no choice; he had to use his equalizer.&quot; Cahill died the following day. Bonney fled but returned a few days later and was apprehended by Miles Wood, the local justice of the peace. He was detained and held in the Camp Grant guardhouse but escaped before law enforcement could arrive.

Bonney stole a horse and fled Arizona Territory for New Mexico Territory, but Apaches took the horse from him, leaving him to walk many miles to the nearest settlement. At Fort Stanton, starving and near death, he went to the home of friend and Seven Rivers Warriors gang member John Jones, whose mother Barbara nursed him back to health. After regaining his health, Bonney went to Apache Tejo, a former army post, where he joined a band of rustlers who raided herds owned by cattle magnate John Chisum in Lincoln County. After he was spotted in Silver City, his involvement with the gang was mentioned in a local newspaper.

==Lincoln County War==
===Prelude===

After returning to New Mexico, Bonney worked as a cowboy for English businessman and rancher John Henry Tunstall (1853–1878), near the Rio Felix, a tributary of the Pecos River, in Lincoln County (now in Chaves County). Tunstall and his business partner and lawyer Alexander McSween were opponents of an alliance formed by Irish-American businessmen Lawrence Murphy, James Dolan, and John Riley. The three men had wielded an economic and political hold over Lincoln County since the early 1870s, due in part to their ownership of a beef contract with nearby Fort Stanton and a well-patronized dry goods store in the town of Lincoln.

By February 1878, McSween owed $8,000 to Dolan, who obtained a court order and asked Lincoln County Sheriff William J. Brady to attach nearly $40,000 worth of Tunstall&#x27;s property and livestock. Tunstall put Bonney in charge of nine prime horses and told him to relocate them to his ranch for safekeeping. Meanwhile, Sheriff Brady assembled a large posse to seize Tunstall&#x27;s cattle.

On February 18, 1878, Tunstall learned of the posse&#x27;s presence on his land and rode out to intervene. During the encounter, one member of the posse shot Tunstall in the chest, knocking him off his horse. Another posse member took Tunstall&#x27;s gun and killed him with a shot to the back of his head. Tunstall&#x27;s murder ignited the conflict between the two factions that became known as the Lincoln County War.

===Build-up===

After Tunstall was killed, Bonney and Dick Brewer swore affidavits against Brady and those in his posse, and obtained murder warrants from Lincoln County justice of the peace John B. Wilson. On February 20, 1878, while attempting to arrest Brady, the sheriff and his deputies found and arrested Bonney and two other men riding with him. Deputy U.S. Marshal Robert Widenmann, a friend of Bonney, and a detachment of soldiers captured Sheriff Brady&#x27;s jail guards, put them behind bars, and released Bonney and Brewer.

Bonney then joined the Lincoln County Regulators; on March 9 they captured Frank Baker and William Morton, both of whom were accused of killing Tunstall. Baker and Morton were killed while allegedly trying to escape.

On April 1, the Regulators ambushed Sheriff Brady and his deputies; Bonney was wounded in the thigh during the battle. Brady and Deputy Sheriff George W. Hindman were killed. On the morning of April 4, 1878, Buckshot Roberts and Dick Brewer were killed during a shootout at Blazer&#x27;s Mill. Warrants were issued for several participants on both sides, and Bonney and two others were charged with killing Brady, Hindman and Roberts.

==== Battle of Lincoln (1878) ====

On the night of Sunday, July 14, McSween and the Regulators—now a group of fifty or sixty men—went to Lincoln and stationed themselves in the town among several buildings. At the McSween residence were Bonney, Florencio Chavez, Jose Chavez y Chavez, Jim French, Harvey Morris, Tom O&#x27;Folliard, and Yginio Salazar, among others. Another group led by Marin Chavez and Doc Scurlock positioned themselves on the roof of a saloon. Henry Newton Brown, Dick Smith, and George Coe defended a nearby adobe bunkhouse.

On Tuesday, July 16, newly appointed sheriff George Peppin sent sharpshooters to kill the McSween defenders at the saloon. Peppin&#x27;s men retreated when one of the snipers, Charles Crawford, was killed by Fernando Herrera. Peppin then sent a request for assistance to Colonel Nathan Dudley, commandant of nearby Fort Stanton. In a reply to Peppin, Dudley refused to intervene but later arrived in Lincoln with troops, turning the battle in favor of the Murphy-Dolan faction.

A gunfight broke out on Friday, July 19. McSween&#x27;s supporters gathered inside his house; when Buck Powell and Deputy Sheriff Jack Long set fire to the building, the occupants began shooting. Bonney and the other men fled the building when all rooms but one were burning. During the confusion, McSween was shot and killed by Robert W. Beckwith, who was then shot and killed by Bonney.

==Outlaw==

Bonney and three other survivors of the Battle of Lincoln were near the Mescalero Indian Agency when the agency bookkeeper, Morris Bernstein, was murdered on August 5, 1878. All four were indicted for the murder, despite conflicting evidence that Bernstein had been killed by Constable Atanacio Martinez. All of the indictments, except Bonney&#x27;s, were later quashed.

On October 5, 1878, U.S. Marshal John Sherman informed newly appointed Territorial Governor and former Union Army general Lew Wallace that he held warrants for several men, including &quot;William H. Antrim, alias Kid, alias Bonny&quot; but was unable to execute them &quot;owing to the disturbed condition of affairs in that county, resulting from the acts of a desperate class of men&quot;. Wallace issued an amnesty proclamation on November 13, 1878, which pardoned anyone involved in the Lincoln County War since Tunstall&#x27;s murder. It specifically excluded persons who had been convicted of or indicted for a crime, and therefore excluded Bonney.

On February 18, 1879, Bonney and friend Tom O&#x27;Folliard were in Lincoln and watched as attorney Huston Chapman was shot and his corpse set on fire. According to eyewitnesses, the pair were innocent bystanders forced at gunpoint by Jesse Evans to witness the murder. Bonney wrote to Governor Wallace on March 13, 1879, with an offer to provide information on the Chapman murder in exchange for amnesty. On March 15, Governor Wallace replied, agreeing to a secret meeting to discuss the situation. He met with Wallace in Lincoln on March 17, 1879. During the meeting and in subsequent correspondence, Wallace promised Bonney protection from his enemies and clemency if he would offer his testimony to a grand jury.

On March 20, Wallace wrote to Bonney, &quot;to remove all suspicion of understanding, I think it better to put the arresting party in charge of Sheriff Kimbrell [sic] who shall be instructed to see that no violence is used.&quot; Bonney responded on the same day, agreeing to testify and confirming Wallace&#x27;s proposal for his arrest and detention in a local jail to assure his safety. On March 21, he let himself be captured by a posse led by Sheriff George Kimball of Lincoln County. As agreed, Bonney provided a statement about Chapman&#x27;s murder and testified in court. However, after his testimony, the local district attorney refused to set him free. Still in custody several weeks later, Bonney began to suspect Wallace had used subterfuge and would never grant him amnesty. He escaped from the Lincoln County jail on June 17, 1879.

Bonney avoided further violence until January 10, 1880, when he shot and killed Joe Grant, a newcomer to the area, at Hargrove&#x27;s Saloon in Fort Sumner, New Mexico. The &quot;Santa Fe Weekly New Mexican&quot; reported, &quot;Billy Bonney, more extensively known as &#x27;the Kid&#x27;, shot and killed Joe Grant. The origin of the difficulty was not learned.&quot; According to other contemporary sources, Bonney had been warned Grant intended to kill him. He walked up to Grant, told him he admired his revolver, and asked to examine it. Grant handed it over. Before returning the pistol, which he noticed contained only three cartridges, Bonney positioned the cylinder so the next hammer fall would land on an empty chamber. Grant suddenly pointed his pistol at Bonney&#x27;s face and pulled the trigger. When it failed to fire, he drew his own weapon and shot Grant in the head. A reporter for the &quot;Las Vegas Optic&quot; quoted Bonney as saying the encounter &quot;was a game of two and I got there first&quot;.

In 1880, Bonney formed a friendship with a rancher named Jim Greathouse, who later introduced him to Dave Rudabaugh. On November 29, 1880, Bonney, Rudabaugh, and Billy Wilson ran from a posse led by sheriff&#x27;s deputy James Carlysle. Cornered at Greathouse&#x27;s ranch, he told the posse they were holding Greathouse as a hostage. Carlysle offered to exchange places with Greathouse, and Bonney accepted the offer. Carlysle later attempted to escape by jumping through a window but he was shot three times and killed. The shootout ended in a standoff; the posse withdrew and Bonney, Rudabaugh, and Wilson rode away.

A few weeks after the Greathouse incident, Bonney, Rudabaugh, Wilson, O&#x27;Folliard, Charlie Bowdre, and Tom Pickett rode into Fort Sumner. Unbeknownst to Bonney and his companions, a posse led by Pat Garrett was waiting for them. The posse opened fire, killing O&#x27;Folliard; the rest of the outlaws escaped unharmed.

===Capture and escape===

On December 13, 1880, Governor Wallace posted a $500 bounty for Bonney&#x27;s capture. Pat Garrett continued his search for Bonney; on December 23, following the siege in which Bowdre was killed, Garrett and his posse captured Bonney along with Pickett, Rudabaugh, and Wilson at Stinking Springs. The prisoners, including Bonney, were shackled and taken to Fort Sumner, then later to Las Vegas, New Mexico. When they arrived on December 26, they were met by crowds of curious onlookers.

The following day, an armed mob gathered at the train depot before the prisoners, who were already on board the train with Garrett, departed for Santa Fe. Deputy Sheriff Romero, backed by the angry group of men, demanded custody of Dave Rudabaugh, who during an unsuccessful escape attempt on April 5, 1880 shot and killed deputy Antonio Lino Valdez in the process. Garrett refused to surrender the prisoner, and a tense confrontation ensued until he agreed to let the sheriff and two other men accompany the party to Santa Fe, where they would petition the governor to release Rudabaugh to them. In a later interview with a reporter, Bonney said he was unafraid during the incident, saying, &quot;if I only had my Winchester I&#x27;d lick the whole crowd.&quot; The &quot;Las Vegas Gazette&quot; ran a story from a jailhouse interview following Bonney&#x27;s capture; when the reporter said Bonney appeared relaxed, he replied, &quot;What&#x27;s the use of looking on the gloomy side of everything? The laugh&#x27;s on me this time.&quot; During his short career as an outlaw, Bonney was the subject of numerous U.S. newspaper articles, some as far away as New York.

After arriving in Santa Fe, Bonney, seeking clemency, sent Governor Wallace four letters over the next three months. Wallace refused to intervene, and he went to trial in April 1881 in Mesilla, New Mexico. Following two days of testimony, Bonney was found guilty of Sheriff Brady&#x27;s murder; it was the only conviction secured against any of the combatants in the Lincoln County War. On April 13, Judge Warren Bristol sentenced him to hang, with his execution scheduled for May 13, 1881. Poet and journalist Arthur Chapman wrote in an essay that upon sentencing, the judge told Bonney he was going to hang until he was &quot;dead, dead, dead&quot;, and his response was, &quot;you can go to hell, hell, hell.&quot; Although this fabricated story eventually entered legend, according to the historical record, he did not speak after the reading of his sentence.
Following his sentencing, Bonney was moved to Lincoln, where he was held under guard on the top floor of the town courthouse. On the evening of April 28, 1881, while Garrett was in White Oaks collecting taxes, Deputy Bob Olinger took five other prisoners across the street for a meal, leaving James Bell, another deputy, alone with Bonney at the jail. He asked to be taken outside to use the outhouse behind the courthouse; on their return to the jail, Bonney—who was walking ahead of Bell up the stairs to his cell—hid around a blind corner, slipped out of his handcuffs, and beat Bell with the loose end of the cuffs. During the ensuing scuffle, Bonney grabbed Bell&#x27;s revolver and fatally shot him in the back as Bell tried to get away.

Bonney, with his legs still shackled, broke into Garrett&#x27;s office and took a loaded shotgun left behind by Olinger. He waited at the upstairs window for Olinger to respond to the gunshot that killed Bell and called out to him, &quot;Look up, old boy, and see what you get.&quot; When Olinger looked up, Bonney shot and killed him. After about an hour, Bonney freed himself from the leg irons with an axe. He obtained a horse and rode out of town; according to some stories he was singing as he left Lincoln.

===Recapture and death===
While Bonney was on the run, Governor Wallace placed a new $500 bounty on the fugitive&#x27;s head. Almost three months after his escape, Garrett, responding to rumors that Bonney was in the vicinity of Fort Sumner, left Lincoln with two deputies on July 14, 1881, to question resident Pete Maxwell, a friend of Bonney&#x27;s. Maxwell, son of land baron Lucien Maxwell, spoke with Garrett the same day for several hours. Around midnight, the pair were sitting in Maxwell&#x27;s darkened bedroom when Bonney unexpectedly entered.

Accounts vary as to the course of events. According to the canonical version, as he entered the room, Bonney failed to recognize Garrett due to the poor lighting. Drawing his revolver and backing away, Bonney asked &quot;¿Quién es? ¿Quién es?&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Who is it? Who is it?&quot;). Recognizing Bonney&#x27;s voice, Garrett drew his revolver and fired twice. The first bullet struck Bonney in the chest just above his heart, while the second missed. Garrett&#x27;s account leaves it unclear whether Bonney was killed instantly or took some time to die.

A few hours after the shooting, a local justice of the peace assembled a coroner&#x27;s jury of six people. The jury members interviewed Maxwell and Garrett, and Bonney&#x27;s body and the location of the shooting were examined. The jury certified the body as Bonney&#x27;s and, according to a local newspaper, the jury foreman said, &quot;It was the Kid&#x27;s body that we examined.&quot; Bonney was given a wake by candlelight; he was buried the next day and his grave was denoted with a wooden marker.

Five days after Bonney&#x27;s killing, Garrett traveled to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to collect the $500 reward offered by Governor Lew Wallace for his capture, dead or alive. William G. Ritch, the acting New Mexico governor, refused to pay the reward. Over the next few weeks, the residents of Las Vegas, Mesilla, Santa Fe, White Oaks, and other New Mexico cities raised over $7,000 in reward money for Garrett. A year and four days after Bonney&#x27;s death, the New Mexico territorial legislature passed a special act to grant Garrett the $500 bounty reward promised by Governor Wallace.

Because people had begun to claim Garrett unfairly ambushed Bonney, Garrett felt the need to tell his side of the story and called upon his friend, journalist Marshall Upson, to ghostwrite a book for him. The book, &quot;The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid&quot;, was first published in April 1882. Although only a few copies sold following its release, in time, it became a reference for later historians who wrote about Bonney&#x27;s life.

==Rumors of survival==
Over time, legends grew claiming that Bonney was not killed, and that Garrett staged the incident and death out of friendship so that Bonney could evade the law. During the next 50 years, a number of men claimed they were Billy the Kid. Most of these claims were easily disproven, but two have remained topics of discussion and debate.

In 1948, a central Texas man, Ollie P. Roberts, also known as Brushy Bill Roberts, began claiming he was Billy the Kid and went before New Mexico Governor Thomas J. Mabry seeking a pardon. Mabry dismissed Roberts&#x27; claims, and Roberts died shortly afterward. Nevertheless, Hico, Texas, Roberts&#x27; town of residence, capitalized on his claim by opening a Billy the Kid museum.

John Miller, an Arizona man, also claimed he was Bonney. This was unsupported by his family until 1938, some time after his death. Miller&#x27;s body was buried in the state-owned Arizona Pioneers&#x27; Home Cemetery in Prescott, Arizona; in May 2005, Miller&#x27;s teeth and bones were exhumed and examined, without permission from the state. DNA samples from the remains were sent to a laboratory in Dallas and tested to compare Miller&#x27;s DNA with blood samples obtained from floorboards in the old Lincoln County courthouse and a bench where Bonney&#x27;s body allegedly was placed after he was shot. According to a July 2015 article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the lab results were &quot;useless&quot;.

In 2004, researchers sought to exhume the remains of Catherine Antrim, Bonney&#x27;s mother, whose DNA would be tested and compared with that of the body buried in William Bonney&#x27;s grave. , her body had not been exhumed.

In 2007, author and amateur historian Gale Cooper filed a lawsuit against the Lincoln County Sheriff&#x27;s Office under the state Inspection of Public Records Act to produce records of the results of the 2006 DNA tests and other forensic evidence collected in the Billy the Kid investigations. In April 2012, 133 pages of documents were provided; they offered no conclusive evidence confirming or disproving the generally accepted story of Garrett&#x27;s killing of Bonney, but confirmed the records&#x27; existence, and that they could have been produced earlier. In 2014, Cooper was awarded $100,000 in punitive damages but the decision was later overturned by the New Mexico Court of Appeals. The lawsuit ultimately cost Lincoln County nearly $300,000.

In February 2015, historian Robert Stahl petitioned a district court in Fort Sumner asking the state of New Mexico to issue a death certificate for Bonney. In July 2015, Stahl filed suit in the New Mexico Supreme Court. The suit asked the court to order the state&#x27;s Office of the Medical Investigator to officially certify Bonney&#x27;s death under New Mexico state law.

==Photographs==
, only one authenticated photograph showing Billy exists; others thought to depict him are disputed.

===Dedrick ferrotype===

One of the few remaining artifacts of Bonney&#x27;s life is a ferrotype photograph of him, attributed to photographer Ben Wittick in late 1879 or early 1880. The image shows Bonney wearing a vest under a sweater, a slouch hat and a bandana, while holding an 1873 Winchester rifle with its butt resting on the floor. For years, this was the only photograph of Bonney accepted by scholars and historians. The original ferrotype survived because Bonney&#x27;s friend Dan Dedrick kept it after the outlaw&#x27;s death. It was passed down through Dedrick&#x27;s family, and was copied several times, appearing in numerous publications during the 20th century. In June 2011, the original plate was bought at auction for $2.3 million by businessman William Koch.

The image shows Bonney wearing his holstered Colt revolver on his left side. This led to the belief that he was left-handed, without taking into account that the ferrotype process produces reversed images. In 1954, western historians James D. Horan and Paul Sann wrote that Bonney was right-handed and carried his pistol on his right hip. The opinion was confirmed by Clyde Jeavons, a former curator of the National Film and Television Archive. Several historians have written that Bonney was ambidextrous.

===Croquet tintype===

A ferrotype purchased at a memorabilia shop in Fresno, California, in 2010 has been claimed to show Bonney and members of the Regulators playing croquet. If authentic, it is the only known photo of Billy the Kid and the Regulators together and the only image to feature their wives and female companions. Collector RobertG. McCubbin and outlaw historian John Boessenecker concluded in 2013 that the photograph does not show Bonney. Whitny Braun, a professor and researcher, located an advertisement for croquet sets sold at Chapman&#x27;s General Store in Las Vegas, New Mexico, dated to June 1878. Kent Gibson, a forensic video and still image expert, offered the services of his facial recognition software, and stated that Bonney is indeed one of the individuals in the image.

In August 2015, Lincoln State Monument officials and the New Mexico Department of Cultural Affairs said that despite the new research, they could not confirm that the image showed Bonney or others from the Lincoln County War era, according to Monument manager Gary Cozzens. A photograph curator at the Palace of the Governors archives, Daniel Kosharek, said the image is &quot;problematic on a lot of fronts&quot;, including the small size of the figures and the lack of resemblance of the background landscape to Lincoln County or the state in general. Editors from the &quot;True West Magazine&quot; staff said, &quot;no one in our office thinks this photo is of the Kid [and the Regulators].&quot;

In early October 2015, Kagin&#x27;s, Inc., a numismatic authentication firm, said the image was authentic after a number of experts, including those associated with a recent National Geographic Channel program,
examined it.

==Posthumous pardon request==
In 2010, New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson turned down a request for a posthumous pardon of Bonney for the murder of Sheriff William Brady. The pardon was considered to fulfill Governor Lew Wallace&#x27;s 1879 promise to Bonney. Richardson&#x27;s decision, citing &quot;historical ambiguity&quot;, was announced on December 31, 2010, his last day in office.

==Grave markers==
In 1931, CharlesW.Foor, an unofficial tour guide at Fort Sumner Cemetery, campaigned to raise funds for a permanent marker for the graves of Bonney, O&#x27;Folliard, and Bowdre. As a result of his efforts, a stone memorial marked with the names of the three men and their death dates beneath the word &quot;Pals&quot; was erected in the center of the burial area.

In 1940, stone cutter James N. Warner of Salida, Colorado, made and donated to the cemetery a new marker for Bonney&#x27;s grave. It was stolen on February 8, 1981, but recovered days later in Huntington Beach, California. New Mexico Governor Bruce King arranged for the county sheriff to fly to California to return it to Fort Sumner, where it was reinstalled in May 1981. Although both markers are behind iron fencing, a group of vandals entered the enclosure at night in June 2012 and tipped the stone over.

==In literature and the arts==

The life and likeness of Billy the Kid have been frequently represented in comics, literature, film, music, theater, radio, television, and video games.

Holiday was making his seventh defence of the title since winning the then vacant title in 1995. It took place at the Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut, and was the first time Mosley was scheduled to box 12 rounds. The fight went the full 12 round distance as Mosley took Holiday&#x27;s IBF title via a unanimous decision. The three judges scored the fight 116-113, 117-111, 115-114 all in favor of Mosley.

This was Mosley&#x27;s sixth defense of his IBF world title. As the fight progressed, Leija was knocked down in rounds 6, 7 and 9. The fight was stopped when Leija couldn&#x27;t answer the bell for round 10, rewarding Mosley with a deserved victory. Mosley was leading by scores of 89-78, 89-78 and 88-79 at the time of the stoppage. Leija took the fight with 3 weeks notice.

Mosley took only two months out returning to the ring to defend his title in January 1999 against American Golden Johnson (15-2-2, 10 KOs) at the Civic Center in Pensacola, Florida.

====Mosley vs. De La Hoya====

On June 17, 2000, Mosley met De La Hoya in Los Angeles for the WBC, IBA &amp; vacant lineal welterweight titles. This was the first boxing event to take place at the newly built Staples Center.

During the fight, neither man was in danger of going down, but both had badly swollen faces at the end and De La Hoya was bleeding from the nose for several rounds. Mosley earned a minimum of $15 million, while De La Hoya was guaranteed $35 million. Judges Lou Filippo and Pat Russell scored the fight 116-112, and 115-113, respectively for Mosley whilst judge Marty Sammon had it 113-115 for De La Hoya. The fight was named &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine Event of the Year for 2000.

====Mosley vs. Diaz, Taylor====

On March 10, 2001, Mosley was scheduled to fight unbeaten Australian Shannan Taylor (28-0-1, 18KOs) at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Shannan was knocked down once in the first round. He was losing all rounds, up until the end of the fifth round. Taylor lost the fight when he decided not to return for round 6.

====Mosley vs. Stone====
On July 21, 2001, Mosley easily beat IBO World super welterweight champion Adrian Stone (30-3-2, 23 KOs) knocking him out in round 3. The fight took place at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Stone moved down to welterweight for the first time in three years to challenge Mosley and was losing the first 2-round before being stopped. Following the win, Mosley said he would like to have a rematch with De La Hoya in a split 50/50 fight or a unification fight against unbeaten Vernon Forrest.

====Mosley vs. Forrest I, II====

It was finally announced that Mosley would be defending his WBC and Lineal welterweight titles against Vernon Forrest (33-0, 26 KOs). The fight took place at the Madison Square Garden Theater in New York City on January 26, 2002. The Ring Magazine welterweight title was also at stake. Mosley was knocked down twice in the second round as he went on to lose a unanimous decision, his first loss in his professional career. In round 2, Mosley suffered a cut at the hairline from an accidental clash of heads. The final scorecards read 115-110, 117-108 and 118-108 all in favor of Forrest.

Mosley and Forrest met in an immediate rematch on July 20, 2002, at the Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. Forrest being the &#x27;A&#x27; side, received $3.42 million compared to Mosley&#x27;s $2.8 million. The fight was also known at the time for its attendance of 15,775 which was the largest boxing crowd ever in Indiana. The fight went the full 12 round distance. The scorecards were closer than the first fight, however still had Forrest as the winner (117-111, 116-112, 115-113) unanimously. USA Today scored it 115-113 in favor of Forrest. Forrest kept on the outside using his height and reach as an advantage.

===Light middleweight===
Mosley&#x27;s first fight at light middleweight was scheduled to take place on February 8, 2003, against former IBF light-middleweight title holder Raúl Márquez at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Paradise, Nevada. The fight ended in a no contest when Mosley accidentally head butted Marquez twice in round three, which caused two very bad cuts above the eyes of Marquez. Mosley earned a $2 million purse for the fight.

====Mosley vs. De La Hoya II====

Mosley and De La Hoya faced each other for the second time on September 13, this time with De La Hoya&#x27;s &quot;The Ring&quot;, WBC, WBA and lineal light middleweight championships on the line. Mosley defeated De La Hoya by a controversial 12 round unanimous decision and joined the exclusive group of world boxing champions that have reigned in three or more divisions. Many fans had Oscar easily beating Mosley in this rematch but judges scored it differently regardless of De La Hoya landing over 100 more punches. Mosley testified in 2003 that he injected himself with the notorious doping agent EPO as he prepared for his light-middleweight title fight against Oscar De La Hoya, according to grand jury transcripts and doping calendars.

====Mosley vs. Wright====

Mosley made the first defense of his unified WBC, WBA Super and The Ring Magazine world light middleweight titles on March 13, 2004, against IBF champion Ronald Wright (46-3, 25 KOs) at the Mandalay Bay Resort &amp; Casino in Las Vegas. Prior to taking this bout, Mosley turned down an offer to fight Félix Trinidad in a bout that would have seen him receive $10 million. Wright, who was a 5-to-2 underdog, won the fight via a unanimous decision. Judges Dave Moretti and Chuck Giampa scored it 117-111, while Paul Smith had it 116-112 all in Wright&#x27;s favor. In the fast-paced bout, Mosley was unable to get on the inside. Wright&#x27;s southpaw stance made it difficult for him, as he threw jabs and straight left to both the face and body of Mosley. CompuBox stats shows that Wright out-landed Mosley landing 250 punches to 166 from Mosley. In the post-fight interview, Mosley said about the Trinidad fight being in jeopardy, &quot;It was not a mistake. I have no regrets. I wanted to find out who was the best in our division. I was fighting for history.&quot; Mosley earned $2.1 million, while Wright was paid $750,000.

====Mosley vs. Wright II====

Instead of the big money fight against Félix Trinidad, Mosley fought Ronald Wright in a rematch on November 20, 2004, at the Mandalay Bay Resort &amp; Casino. The fight was for the WBC, WBA Super and The Ring Magazine world title. Wright was stripped of the IBF title on April 19, 2004, because he agreed to have a rematch with Mosley instead of defending the title against the mandatory challenger Kassim Ouma. The fight aired live on HBO. The fight went the 12 round distance. Both fighters were tired during the last round and clinched for most of it. After the final bell rang, both fighters showed respect to each other and embraced in the ring. One judge had it had it 114-114 even, whilst the other two scored it 115-113 in favor of Wright, meaning he scored back to back victories over Mosley. Wright landed 119 punches more than Mosley.

====Mosley vs. Estrada====
Following his consecutive losses to Wright, Mosley was on a comeback trail to rebuild and once again challenge for a world title. His next fight took place at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas on April 23, 2005, against David Estrada (18-1, 9 KOs) in a scheduled 10 round bout. The fight went the distance as Mosley was announced the victor. There were two wide scores of 99-91 and 98-93 and a closer margin score of 97–93. The fight wasn&#x27;t focused on if Mosley won, but more how dominant he would be in doing so. Mosley received $500,000 for the fight.

Mosley next fought five months later in September against undefeated former Mexico welterweight champion Jose Luis Cruz (33-0-2, 28 KOs) in 10 round bout. Much like the Estrada fight, Mosley won a unanimous decision with scores of 96-94, 97-93, and 98-92.

====Mosley vs. Vargas I, II====
In November 2005, negotiations were complete and a fight between Mosley and former light middleweight champion Fernando Vargas (26-2, 22 KOs) was confirmed as a WBA light middleweight title eliminator. The fight was scheduled to take place on February 25, 2006, live on HBO PPV at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. Mosley was guaranteed $3 million from the fight plus percentages of the PPV revenue. Mosley won the bout via 10th-round technical knockout after Vargas&#x27; left eye was completely closed. Vargas claimed the cut and closure of his eye was not due to a punch, but because of clash of heads. At the time of stoppage, two judges had Mosley was ahead on two cards at 86-85, 86-85 and the third judge had Vargas ahead 86-85. The fight exceeded financial expectations generating 415,000 buys and $18.6 million in revenue.

A rematch was made to take place on July 15 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. Mosley was to earn $4 million plus a percentage and Vargas had a base purse of $3 million plus upside on the pay-per-view. Mosley floored Vargas with a left hook in the sixth and Vargas had a very hard time in getting up. Referee Kenny Bayless stopped the fight moments later. At the time of the stoppage, Mosley had won every round on all three judges&#x27; cards. Mosley was quicker than Vargas, easily winning rounds with his speed and combinations. At the time of stoppage, the scorecards were much more close than the first fight with Mosley winning 5 rounds to non on all three scorecards. The attendance for the bout was 9,722. After the fight Mosley said, &quot;When I was in the ring I remembered watching Oscar fight Vargas, and he threw that perfect left hook. I was bouncing around and I saw the opportunity and I threw the perfect left hook.&quot; Mosley also talked about moving back down to welterweight. HBO confirmed the bout did 350,000 buys, generating $17.5 million in revenue.

===Return to welterweight===

====Mosley vs. Collazo====
Despite being in position to challenge for the WBA light middleweight title, Mosley decided to return to the welterweight division. In January 2007, Mosley and former WBA welterweight champion Lus Collazo (27-2, 13 KOs) announced that they would meet on February 10, 2007, at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada in a fight billed as &quot;Battle at the Bay&quot;. The interim WBC welterweight title was at stake because then full WBC champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. had planned to move up to light middleweight to challenge Oscar De La Hoya. There was no confirmation as to whether Mayweather would stay at 154 or return to 147 after that bout. Mosley knocked Collazo down in round 11 with a right hook and went on to win a fairly one-sided fight with judges scoring the fight 119-108, 118-109 and 118-109. Mosley was guaranteed $1 million for the fight.

====Mosley vs. Cotto====
It was announced on August 15, 2007, that Mosley would challenge undefeated Miguel Cotto (30-0, 25 KOs) for his WBA welterweight title. The fight, being billed as &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; was announced to take place at the Madison Square Garden in New York on HBO PPV.

On fight night the attendance was 17,135. Cotto landed the better shots in round one and most of round two, however, Mosley landed some good rights at the end of the second. Both landed big shots in round three with Cotto momentarily rocked by a right hand. The two fighters then had some good exchanges in the fourth. Round five was close, but Cotto appeared to be taking control in the sixth. Mosley adjusted and tried boxing from the outside in the seventh round. The boxing continued in the eighth as Mosley moved and Cotto pursued. Mosley hurt Cotto in the ninth round but Cotto fought back gamely at the end of the round. Mosley dominated the first half of the tenth, but Cotto rallied in the second half. Mosley pressed in the eleventh, but Cotto landed some great counter-punches to win the round. Possibly thinking he had the fight won, Cotto stayed out of range in the final round. Two judges scored the fight 115-113 and the third judge had it 116-113 all in favor of Cotto, who retained his WBA title and gave Mosley his fifth professional loss. Both fighters landed 248 punches with Cotto having the better connect rate due to throwing 101 fewer punches. Mosley showed his professionalism, saying &quot;Good luck champ. You&#x27;re a real warrior&quot; to Cotto, on his way out of the ring. Mosley earned a purse of $2 million and the fight garnered 400,000 PPV buys.

===Return to light middleweight===

====Mosley vs. Mayorga====
In August 2008, it was announced that Mosley would fight at light middleweight against former world champion Ricardo Mayorga (28-6-1, 22 KO&#x27;s). The fight was to take place at Home Depot Center in California on September 27, 2008. The first time since 2000 that Mosley would fight in his home state. The fight was for the vacant WBA Inter-Continental light middleweight title. Mosley was guaranteed $1 million. During the first three rounds of the bout, the harder puncher appeared to be Mayorga, who landed right hands from long range. Mayorga&#x27;s roughhousing mixed with his usual showboating antics seemed to bother Mosley, who appeared more uncomfortable and agitated. In recklessly lunging in with wild power shots of his own Mosley wound up falling into more clinches and getting caught with punches he should have avoided. Mosley settled down and found the distance in the fourth round and took the next three rounds by timing Mayorga with overhand rights that landed and occasionally following up with short hooks and single body shots. Mosley continued with right hands in the seventh and eighth rounds. Mosley was able to land single power shots in the late rounds, but threw very few combinations. At times Mayorga beat Mosley to the punch with lead right hands. Near the end of the eleventh round, Mosley landed a right hand that splattered blood from Mayorga&#x27;s mouth. With less than a minute left in the bout, Mosley knocked Mayorga down to his hands and knees. Mayorga got up on unsteady legs; Mosley stepped in with a short, lead left hook that put Mayorga flat on his back at the bell, resulting in the referee waving the bout off. At the time of stoppage, two judges had Mosley ahead with scored of 107-102 and 105-104, whilst the third judge had Mayorga ahead 105-104. Had the fight gone to scorecards, Mosley would have won via unanimous decision due to the last round being a 10-7.

===Second return at welterweight===
====Mosley vs. Margarito====

Prior to one of the biggest fights of his career, Mosley began training with Naazim Richardson. Mosley regained the WBA (Super) welterweight title from Antonio Margarito on January 24, 2009, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Mosley, now 37 years old, came into the fight as a 4–1 underdog with the bookies after Margarito had spectacularly stopped Cotto 6 months earlier. Prior to the bout, very few gave Mosley a chance of prevailing, with the prevailing view that Margarito was too strong and young for Mosley. The conventional wisdom was that this was a mismatch, which would end in a brutal retirement-forcing stoppage for &quot;Sugar&quot; Shane. A comparison of their last fights; the aforementioned destruction of Cotto by Margarito and a last-gasp knockout by Mosley in a hard twelve-round struggle against Mayorga did not bode well for Mosley. Some predicted a massacre. And it was – only it was Margarito that was ruthlessly clubbed about the ring, unable to land any meaningful shots.

Mosley eventually TKO&#x27;d Margarito in the ninth round, after appearing to win every round up until then, in a massive upset. Sugar Shane utterly dominated Margarito, using his superior hand speed, pinpoint accuracy, consistent body punching, countless huge right hands to the jaw and tying up when Margarito backed him into the ropes, to wear Margarito down and stop him—something that many seasoned boxing observers thought was nigh-on impossible. After knocking him down with a series of heavy overhand rights at the end of the eighth round, Margarito was unable to avoid punches during a heavy barrage from Mosley early on in the ninth, forcing the referee to step in as Margarito slumped to the canvas a second time. Margarito had never previously been stopped. It was a sensational win for Sugar Shane and propelled him back to the upper echelons of the welterweight division and the sport of Boxing, in addition to further cementing his legacy as one of the best fighters in his era.

The fight was marred in a controversy after Mosley&#x27;s trainer, Naazim Richardson diligently spotted a gauze knuckle pad accessory in Margarito&#x27;s hand wraps. California State Athletic Commission officials had Margarito re-wrap his hands and took the pad for testing: a state laboratory likened the substance to plaster of Paris. Margarito and trainer Javier Capetillo would be suspended for a year by CSAC: this effectively banned them from boxing across the United States, as suspensions in one state are usually also enforced by other commissions. Later investigations determined that Margarito was likely loading his gloves for several other fights as well, including his title win over Miguel Cotto.

The fight was for Margarito&#x27;s WBA title and the vacant Lineal welterweight championship of &quot;Cyber Boxing Zone (CBZ)&quot;. &quot;The Ring&quot; did not recognize this bout for its vacant welterweight championship despite the fact it pitted &quot;The Ring&quot; #1 ranked welterweight, Antonio Margarito, vs. &quot;The Ring&quot; #3 ranked welterweight, Shane Mosley. Coming in the bout, Margarito had just TKO&#x27;d the previous &quot;The Ring&quot; #1 ranked welterweight and current &quot;The Ring&quot; #2 ranked welterweight, Miguel Cotto. After the fight, Mosley was named &quot;The Ring&quot;&#x27;s #1 ranked welterweight.

====Mosley vs. Mayweather====

It was announced that on May 1, 2010, Mosley would fight undefeated Floyd Mayweather Jr. Boxing purists had called for the fight for over ten years. Mosley was scheduled to fight WBC champion Andre Berto in a unification fight, but Berto had to pull out after an Earthquake in Haiti killed some of his family members. Mosley&#x27;s WBA title was not on the line because Mayweather refused to pay WBA sanctioning fees. On the fight night, Mosley stunned Mayweather with two right-hand shots in the second round. Mayweather recovered well and dominated the remainder of the fight with superior reflexes and his effective counter-punching style, eventually beating Mosley in a wide decision 119–109, 119–109, and 118–110 on the scorecards to win Mosley&#x27;s &quot;lineal&quot; welterweight championship.

On May 22, 2010, Mosley was stripped of his WBA (Super) welterweight title, due to not making a mandatory defense, which in turn made WBA Champion Vyacheslav Senchenko the sole WBA titlist in the welterweight division.

===Second return at light middleweight===

====Mosley vs Mora====
On June 30, 2010, it was announced Mosley would next fight former WBC light middleweight champion Sergio Mora (22-1-1, 6KOs) at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on September 18. An official press conference took place at the end of August. The bout ended up being a highly disputed split draw, where many people thought that Mosley narrowly won the closely contested bout (boxing analyst website Boxrec had it 114-112 for Mosley). The judges scored the bout: Mora 115–113, Mosley 116–112 and 114–114. Punch stats showed that Mosley landed 161 of 522 punches (31%) compared to 93 of 508 thrown (18%) by Mora. The result was booed by the crowd, who began chanting &quot;Canelo! Canelo!&quot; Mosley felt the decision was fair, &quot;We both fought hard. It was good fight, a good decision.&quot;

===Third return at welterweight===

====Mosley vs. Pacquiao====

On May 7, 2011, Mosley lost the fight to Manny Pacquiao for the WBO welterweight title at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Rapper LL Cool J performed as Mosley first entered the arena, while vocalist Jimi Jamison of the rock band Survivor sang &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot; as Pacquiao approached the ring. Pacquiao knocked Mosley down in the third round using a one-two capped with a left straight. Mosley was left dazed by the knockdown but managed to stand up. Mosley floored Pacquiao in the tenth round with a push, but referee Kenny Bayless inexplicably ruled it a knockdown. None of the judges seemed to have bought it judging from the scores. Replays showed that Pacquiao was throwing a punch off balance, had his right foot stepped on by Mosley&#x27;s left foot and went down with a little help from Mosley&#x27;s right hand. Bayless apologized to Pacquiao after the fight for the mistake. Pacquiao gained one-sided verdicts from all three judges (119–108, 120–108, and 120–107). Due to Mosley&#x27;s defeat, Pacquiao looked at a November 12, 2011, match-up, a third fight with Juan Manuel Márquez.

===Third return at light middleweight, and first retirement===

====Mosley vs. Álvarez====
In February 2012 it was announced that Mosley would fight 21 year old, highly regarded light middleweight champion Saul &quot;Canelo&quot; Álvarez (39-0-1, 29 KOs) on the Mayweather Jr.–Cotto PPV undercard on May 5 for the WBC light middleweight title at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Mosely entered with a record of 2-3-1 in his previous six bouts dating back to November 2007. At 40, Mosley was 19 years older than Álvarez. Álvarez was guaranteed $2 million whilst Mosley took the smaller amount of $650,000. Among those in attendance were Sugar Ray Leonard, Thomas Hearns, Bernard Hopkins, and Oscar De La Hoya.

The fight went to scorecards with Álvarez winning a one-sided decision with scores of 119–109, 119–109 and 118–110. ESPN scored the fight wide 118–110 for Álvarez. Álvarez landed more than half the punches he threw (348 of 673). According to CompuBox, it was the most an opponent had landed on Mosley in the 34 fights that they have tracked from his career. Álvarez paid respect to Mosley in the post-fight interview through a translator, &quot;This was a great experience. I felt really good and I want to thank Shane for giving me this experience. He&#x27;s a great fighter, a true veteran. I tried to knock him out. He took a lot of punches, but it didn&#x27;t work.&quot; Mosley landed 183 of 745 punches (25%). Mosley spoke about stepping back from boxing, &quot;His defense was really good and he was really fast. He can go a long ways. When the kids start to beat you, you might need to start going to promoting. I didn&#x27;t expect him to be that fast or that good.

Mosley officially retired after this bout, ending his career with a record of 46-8-1, 39 KO&#x27;s. He went 0-3-1 in his last 4 fights.

===Comeback===

====Mosley vs. Cano, Mundine====
On March 19, 2013, Mosley announced he was coming out of retirement to fight 23-year-old Pablo Cesar Cano (26-2-1, 20 KOs) in Cancún, Mexico. The fight was set to take place on May 18, 2013. Mosley won the fight via unanimous decision with all three judges scoring the bout 115-113. Cano was able to win the first few rounds but Mosley took control of the later rounds and pounded Cano until the final bell. With the win, Mosley won the vacant WBC International welterweight champion, picking up his first professional win since 2009.

Mosley fought Australian former professional rugby league footballer Anthony Mundine (44-5, 26 KOs) on November 27, 2013, at Allphones Arena in Sydney, Australia. The fight was due to take place on October 23, but Mosley dropped out due to contractual demands not being met, according to his promoter Richard Schaeffer. In the contract, it stated that the remaining $700,000 of Mosley&#x27;s $1 million purse was due to be paid by 5pm. Mosley lost the fight after Mundine scored a technical knockout during round 6. Before the seventh round, Mosley retiring due to back spasms giving Mundine the victory via TKO. In the post-fight, Mundine praised Mosley, &quot;I was in killer mode, but my heart goes out to Shane, I know he&#x27;s a winner. He&#x27;s not one to pull out for nothing. He&#x27;s one of the greatest fighters to have ever lived.&quot; Mosley stated he would decide his future upon returning to the United States.

===Second retirement===

Mosley announced his second retirement on December 7, 2013. He stated that he plans to become a trainer, to train his son, Shane Jr., and other young fighters. In an interview with World Boxing News, when asked if he had any desire to lace up his gloves and return to the ring professionally, he said he would only consider a return to the sport against the very top welterweights in the world. He specifically named Floyd Mayweather Jr., Manny Pacquiao, and Juan Manuel Márquez. He also said in another interview in early 2015 that he was not sure if he would fight again, but that he wanted to come back and face a fighter of similar age and specifically named Juan Manuel Márquez.

===Final comeback in 2015===

====Mosley vs. Mayorga II====
On July 9, 2015, Mosley made a comeback announcement declaring he would fight former rival Ricardo Mayorga (31-8-1, 25 KOs) at a catchweight of 154 pounds on August 29 at The Forum in Los Angeles. On August 14, Don King filed a lawsuit, which stated that Mayorga still had a promotional contract with him dating back to 2009. Mayorga made a return to boxing in 2014. Legal documents showed that Mayorga, upon his return in 2014, signed a Memorandum of Understanding, confirming that his contract with King still stands. The contracted weight was changed to 158 pounds. At the weigh in, Mayorga came in 7.4 pounds heavier than the limit. Mosley also came in overweight. In the end, Mayorga weighed 165.4 pounds with Mosley much lighter at 159.8 pounds. During the face-off, Mosley&#x27;s girlfriend, who was also helping promote the fight, soaked Mayorga, emptying a water bottle over his head. Mayorga did not react, although later appeared to slap her backside. Mosley immediately erupted, putting his hands on Mayorga&#x27;s throat. Many outlets, including the WBC claimed it was all staged, to which Mosley&#x27;s camp called the WBC appalling. The fight went ahead as planned. Mosley won the fight via 6th-round TKO following a body shot, which dropped Mayorga to his knees. The referee began the count, to which Mayorga did not beat. He later complained it was a low blow, but replays showed it was a legal blow. The time of stoppage was 2:59 on round 6.

====Negotiations with Liam Smith====
In October 2015, there were talks regarding Mosley challenging WBO light middleweight champion Liam Smith (21-0-1, 11 KOs) to take place later in December, in a fight which would see Mosley making his UK debut at the age of 44. Mosley was said to be excited about the potential fight and told World Boxing News, &quot;I might take the fight with Liam Smith, but they say we must have a rematch clause.&quot; He went on to say that if Smith wanted a rematch, he would have to take it within eight weeks or after October 2016, due to plans already made for early 2016. By the end of October, Mosley pulled out of the negotiations as he would not accept the rematch clause. In a statement he said, &quot;There&#x27;s no way I should have taken that fight for less than a million and I took it damn near for free, but they blew it over an immediate [rematch]. It&#x27;s strange.&quot; Mosley believed Smith should have been more grateful in fighting him.

====Mosley vs. Lopez, Avanesyan====
On December 2, 2015, it was announced that Mosley would next fight 37 year old Venezuelan veteran Patrick López (23-6, 14 KOs) at the Roberto Durán Arena in Panama City, Panama for the WBA Continental super welterweight title on December 17, in a scheduled 10 round bout. Both boxers came in at around the welterweight limit, with Mosley slightly heavier and López fighting for the first time in 13 months. López was knocked down in the 2nd round following a left hook and a further three times in the last round, which put an end to the fight. Mosley improved his ledger to 49 victories, with 41 of those victories coming inside the distance. At the time of stoppage, the three judges&#x27; had the fight 87-83, 86-84, 88-83 in favour of Mosley.

On March 28, 2016, it was announced that Mosley would challenge WBA Interim welterweight champion David Avanesyan (21-1-1, 11 KOs) at the Gila River Arena in Glendale, Arizona. on May 28. The winner would then be the mandatory for the winner of the Thurman-Porter fight. Prior to the fight being announced, legendary hall of famer Roberto Durán became Mosley&#x27;s trainer. This also marked the first time Avanesyan would fight in the United States. At the time of the fight, Mosley was ranked number 3 by the WBA. Mosley lost the fight after going the distance. Avanesyan won all three judges&#x27; scorecards (117-110 twice, 114-113). Mosley started off the fight quick as the aggressor. As the middle rounds passed, Avanesyan began to take over. Despite the two wide scorecards, the fight was seen as being much closer and competitive.

====Cancelled Kurbanov fight====
In March 2017, Mosley announced that he would fight on against unbeaten Russian prospect Magomed Kurbanov (10-0, 8 KOs) at DIVS in Ekaterinburg on May 5, 2017. The fight would take place at light middleweight in a 10-round bout and contested for the vacant WBO Inter-Continental title. In April, RCC Boxing Promotion revealed that Mosley had picked up a hand injury whilst training. The fight was pushed back to take place on September 9, 2017, instead. On June 29, 2017, it was reported that Mosley had an unsuccessful surgery in his back, which required him to undergo another surgery. The fight was pushed back again to December 2017; however, because Mosley could not guarantee he would be fully recovered, the fight was called off.

===Final retirement===
On August 16, 2017, Mosley announced his retirement after being a professional for 24 years. Speaking to ESPN, he said his body was no longer in a state where he could get through training due to a botched elbow surgery. In a statement, he said, 

He retired with 61 fights in the paid ranks. He won 49, with 41 coming inside the distance, 10 losses, having only been stopped once, 1 draw and a no contest.

==BALCO scandal==
In August 2002 federal agents initiated investigations into BALCO, a California-based laboratory suspected of selling banned performance-enhancing drugs to top athletes. Shane Mosley was among those named as a BALCO client, and he testified before a grand jury that he injected himself with the energy-boosting drug EPO and used undetectable steroids known as &quot;the cream&quot; and &quot;the clear&quot;, acquired from BALCO, prior to his 2003 rematch with Oscar De La Hoya, which Mosley won by a unanimous decision. Mosley insisted that he did not knowingly take banned substances, and thought they were vitamins. He said he believed &quot;the cream&quot; was flaxseed oil, but under questioning he admitted it was probably something else. In 2008 Mosley launched a $12 million defamation lawsuit against BALCO founder Victor Conte, who claimed that Mosley knowingly took performance-enhancing drugs. The suit was dismissed with prejudice in November 2010.

==Personal life==
In November 2002, Mosley married Jin Sheehan. The couple had three children before divorcing in 2010. He has a son, Shane Mosley Jr., from a previous relationship. Mosley Jr. made his professional debut in 2014.

<doc id="151864" wikidata="Q338886" url="?curid=151864" title="Divergence theorem">
<text>In vector calculus, the divergence theorem, also known as Gauss&#x27;s theorem or Ostrogradsky&#x27;s theorem, is a theorem relating the &quot;flux&quot; of a vector field through a closed surface to the &quot;divergence&quot; of the field in the volume enclosed.

More precisely, the divergence theorem states that the surface integral of a vector field over a closed surface, which is called the &quot;flux&quot; through the surface, is equal to the volume integral of the divergence over the region enclosed by the surface. Intuitively, it states that &quot;the sum of all sources of the field in a region (with sinks regarded as negative sources) gives the net flux out of the region&quot;.

The divergence theorem is an important result for the mathematics of physics and engineering, particularly in electrostatics and fluid dynamics. In these fields, it is usually applied in three dimensions. However, it generalizes to any number of dimensions. In one dimension, it is equivalent to the fundamental theorem of calculus. In two dimensions, it is equivalent to Green&#x27;s theorem.

== Explanation using liquid flow ==

Vector fields are often illustrated using the example of the velocity field of a fluid, such as a gas or liquid. A moving liquid has a velocity—a speed and a direction—at each point, which can be represented by a vector, so that the velocity of the liquid at any moment forms a vector field. Consider an imaginary closed surface &quot;S&quot; inside a body of liquid, enclosing a volume of liquid. The flux of liquid out of the volume at any time is equal to the volume rate of fluid crossing this surface, i.e., the surface integral of the velocity over the surface.

Since liquids are incompressible, the amount of liquid inside a closed volume is constant; if there are no sources or sinks inside the volume then the flux of liquid out of &quot;S&quot; is zero. If the liquid is moving, it may flow into the volume at some points on the surface &quot;S&quot; and out of the volume at other points, but the amounts flowing in and out at any moment are equal, so the &quot;net&quot; flux of liquid out of the volume is zero.

However if a &quot;source&quot; of liquid is inside the closed surface, such as a pipe through which liquid is introduced, the additional liquid will exert pressure on the surrounding liquid, causing an outward flow in all directions. This will cause a net outward flow through the surface &quot;S&quot;. The flux outward through &quot;S&quot; equals the volume rate of flow of fluid into &quot;S&quot; from the pipe. Similarly if there is a &quot;sink&quot; or drain inside &quot;S&quot;, such as a pipe which drains the liquid off, the external pressure of the liquid will cause a velocity throughout the liquid directed inward toward the location of the drain. The volume rate of flow of liquid inward through the surface &quot;S&quot; equals the rate of liquid removed by the sink.

If there are multiple sources and sinks of liquid inside &quot;S&quot;, the flux through the surface can be calculated by adding up the volume rate of liquid added by the sources and subtracting the rate of liquid drained off by the sinks. The volume rate of flow of liquid through a source or sink (with the flow through a sink given a negative sign) is equal to the &quot;divergence&quot; of the velocity field at the pipe mouth, so adding up (integrating) the divergence of the liquid throughout the volume enclosed by &quot;S&quot; equals the volume rate of flux through &quot;S&quot;. This is the divergence theorem.

The divergence theorem is employed in any conservation law which states that the total volume of all sinks and sources, that is the volume integral of the divergence, is equal to the net flow across the volume&#x27;s boundary.

==Mathematical statement==
Suppose is a subset of formula_1 (in the case of represents a volume in three-dimensional space) which is compact and has a piecewise smooth boundary (also indicated with formula_2). If is a continuously differentiable vector field defined on a neighborhood of , then:
:)\,\mathrm{d}S .&lt;/math&gt;
The left side is a volume integral over the volume , and the right side is the surface integral over the boundary of the volume . The closed, measurable set formula_3 is oriented by outward-pointing normals, and formula_4 is the outward pointing unit normal at almost each point on the boundary formula_3. (formula_6 may be used as a shorthand for formula_7.) In terms of the intuitive description above, the left-hand side of the equation represents the total of the sources in the volume , and the right-hand side represents the total flow across the boundary .
==Informal derivation==
The divergence theorem follows from the fact that if a volume is partitioned into separate parts, the flux out of the original volume is equal to the algebraic sum of the flux out of each component volume. This is true despite the fact that the new subvolumes have surfaces that were not part of the original volume&#x27;s surface, because these surfaces are just partitions between two of the subvolumes and the flux through them just passes from one volume to the other and so cancels out when the flux out of the subvolumes is summed.
See the diagram. A closed, bounded volume is divided into two volumes and by a surface &quot;(green)&quot;. The flux out of each component region is equal to the sum of the flux through its two faces, so the sum of the flux out of the two parts is

:formula_8

where and are the flux out of surfaces and , is the flux through out of volume 1, and is the flux through out of volume 2. The point is that surface is part of the surface of both volumes. The &quot;outward&quot; direction of the normal vector formula_9 is opposite for each volume, so the flux out of one through is equal to the negative of the flux out of the other so these two fluxes cancel in the sum.

:formula_10

Therefore:
:formula_11
Since the union of surfaces and is 
:formula_12


This principle applies to a volume divided into any number of parts, as shown in the diagram. Since the integral over each internal partition &quot;(green surfaces)&quot; appears with opposite signs in the flux of the two adjacent volumes they cancel out, and the only contribution to the flux is the integral over the external surfaces &quot;(grey)&quot;. Since the external surfaces of all the component volumes equal the original surface.
:formula_13

The flux out of each volume is the surface integral of the vector field over the surface

:formula_14

The goal is to divide the original volume into infinitely many infinitesimal volumes. As the volume is divided into smaller and smaller parts, the surface integral on the right, the flux out of each subvolume, approaches zero because the surface area approaches zero. However, from the definition of divergence, the ratio of flux to volume, formula_15

As formula_16 approaches zero volume, it becomes the infinitesimal , the part in parentheses becomes the divergence, and the sum becomes a volume integral over 

Since this derivation is coordinate free, it shows that the divergence does not depend on the coordinates used.

==Proofs==
===For bounded open subsets of Euclidean space===
We are going to prove the following:
Proof of Theorem.

 \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}u_{x_i}(x)\,dx_i\,dx&#x27; = 0&lt;/math&gt; by the fundamental theorem of calculus, and formula_17 since formula_18 vanishes on a neighborhood of formula_19. Thus the theorem holds for formula_18 with compact support in formula_21. Thus we have reduced to the case where formula_18 has compact support in some formula_23.

| 3 = So assume formula_18 has compact support in some formula_23. The last step now is to show that the theorem is true by direct computation. Change notation to formula_26, and bring in the notation from (2) used to describe formula_27. Note that this means that we have rotated and translated formula_21. This is a valid reduction since the theorem is invariant under rotations and translations of coordinates. Since formula_29 for formula_30 and for formula_31, we have for each formula_32 that
formula_33
For formula_34 we have by the fundamental theorem of calculus that
formula_35
Now fix formula_36. Note that
formula_37
Define formula_38 by formula_39. By the chain rule,
formula_40
But since formula_41 has compact support, we can integrate out formula_42 first to deduce that
formula_43
Thus
formula_44
In summary, with formula_45 we have
formula_46
Recall that the outward unit normal to the graph formula_47 of formula_48 at a point formula_49 is formula_50 and that the surface element formula_51 is given by formula_52. Thus
formula_53
This completes the proof.

===For compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary===
We are going to prove the following:
Proof of Theorem.

We use the Einstein summation convention. By using a partition of unity, we may assume that formula_18 and formula_55 have compact support in a coordinate patch formula_56. First consider the case where the patch is disjoint from formula_19. Then formula_58 is identified with an open subset of formula_1 and integration by parts produces no boundary terms:
formula_60
In the last equality we used the Voss-Weyl coordinate formula for the divergence, although the preceding identity could be used to define formula_61 as the formal adjoint of formula_62. Now suppose formula_58 intersects formula_19. Then formula_58 is identified with an open set in formula_66. We zero extend formula_18 and formula_55 to formula_69 and perform integration by parts to obtain
formula_70
where formula_71.
By a variant of the straightening theorem for vector fields, we may choose formula_58 so that formula_73 is the inward unit normal formula_74 at formula_19. In this case formula_76 is the volume element on formula_19 and the above formula reads
formula_78
This completes the proof.

==Corollaries==
By replacing in the divergence theorem with specific forms, other useful identities can be derived (cf. vector identities).

* With formula_79 for a scalar function and a vector field ,

:A special case of this is formula_80, in which case the theorem is the basis for Green&#x27;s identities.

* With formula_81 for two vector fields and , where formula_82 denotes a cross product,

* With formula_83 for two vector fields and , where formula_84 denotes a dot product,

* With formula_85 for a scalar function and vector field c:
:The last term on the right vanishes for constant formula_86 or any divergence free (solenoidal) vector field, e.g. Incompressible flows without sources or sinks such as phase change or chemical reactions etc. In particular, taking formula_86 to be constant:

* With formula_88 for vector field and constant vector c:

: By reordering the triple product on the right hand side and taking out the constant vector of the integral,

: Hence,

== Example ==

Suppose we wish to evaluate

where is the unit sphere defined by

:formula_89

and is the vector field

:formula_90

The direct computation of this integral is quite difficult, but we can simplify the derivation of the result using the divergence theorem, because the divergence theorem says that the integral is equal to:

:formula_91

where is the unit ball:

:formula_92

Since the function is positive in one hemisphere of and negative in the other, in an equal and opposite way, its total integral over is zero. The same is true for :

:formula_93

Therefore,

because the unit ball has volume .

==Applications==

===Differential and integral forms of physical laws===

As a result of the divergence theorem, a host of physical laws can be written in both a differential form (where one quantity is the divergence of another) and an integral form (where the flux of one quantity through a closed surface is equal to another quantity). Three examples are Gauss&#x27;s law (in electrostatics), Gauss&#x27;s law for magnetism, and Gauss&#x27;s law for gravity.

====Continuity equations====
Continuity equations offer more examples of laws with both differential and integral forms, related to each other by the divergence theorem. In fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, relativity theory, and a number of other fields, there are continuity equations that describe the conservation of mass, momentum, energy, probability, or other quantities. Generically, these equations state that the divergence of the flow of the conserved quantity is equal to the distribution of &quot;sources&quot; or &quot;sinks&quot; of that quantity. The divergence theorem states that any such continuity equation can be written in a differential form (in terms of a divergence) and an integral form (in terms of a flux).

===Inverse-square laws===
Any &quot;inverse-square law&quot; can instead be written in a &quot;Gauss&#x27;s law&quot;-type form (with a differential and integral form, as described above). Two examples are Gauss&#x27;s law (in electrostatics), which follows from the inverse-square Coulomb&#x27;s law, and Gauss&#x27;s law for gravity, which follows from the inverse-square Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation. The derivation of the Gauss&#x27;s law-type equation from the inverse-square formulation or vice versa is exactly the same in both cases; see either of those articles for details.

== History ==
Joseph-Louis Lagrange introduced the notion of surface integrals in 1760 and again in more general terms in 1811, in the second edition of his &quot;Mécanique Analytique.&quot; Lagrange employed surface integrals in his work on fluid mechanics. He discovered the divergence theorem in 1762.

Carl Friedrich Gauss was also using surface integrals while working on the gravitational attraction of an elliptical spheroid in 1813, when he proved special cases of the divergence theorem. He proved additional special cases in 1833 and 1839. But it was Mikhail Ostrogradsky, who gave the first proof of the general theorem, in 1826, as part of his investigation of heat flow. Special cases were proven by George Green in 1828 in &quot;An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism&quot;, Siméon Denis Poisson in 1824 in a paper on elasticity, and Frédéric Sarrus in 1828 in his work on floating bodies.

== Worked examples ==

=== Example 1 ===
To verify the planar variant of the divergence theorem for a region formula_94:

:formula_95

and the vector field:

:formula_96

The boundary of formula_94 is the unit circle, formula_98, that can be represented parametrically by:

:formula_99

such that formula_100 where formula_101 units is the length arc from the point formula_102 to the point formula_103 on formula_98. Then a vector equation of formula_98 is

:formula_106

At a point formula_103 on formula_98:

:formula_109

Therefore,

:formula_110

Because formula_111, we can evaluate and because formula_112. Thus

:formula_113

===Example 2===

Let&#x27;s say we wanted to evaluate the flux of the following vector field defined by formula_114 bounded by the following inequalities:

:formula_115

By the divergence theorem,

We now need to determine the divergence of formula_116. If formula_117 is a three-dimensional vector field, then the divergence of formula_116 is given by formula_119.

Thus, we can set up the following flux integral 
as follows:
:formula_120

Now that we have set up the integral, we can evaluate it.

:formula_121

==Generalizations==

===Multiple dimensions===
One can use the generalised Stokes&#x27; theorem to equate the -dimensional volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a region to the -dimensional surface integral of over the boundary of :

:formula_122

This equation is also known as the divergence theorem.

When , this is equivalent to Green&#x27;s theorem.

When , it reduces to the fundamental theorem of calculus, part 2.

===Tensor fields===
Writing the theorem in Einstein notation:

suggestively, replacing the vector field with a rank- tensor field , this can be generalized to:

:{\partial x_{i_q}} \mathrm{d}V=&lt;/math&gt;
| intsubscpt = formula_123
| integrand = formula_124

where on each side, tensor contraction occurs for at least one index. This form of the theorem is still in 3d, each index takes values 1, 2, and 3. It can be generalized further still to higher (or lower) dimensions (for example to 4d spacetime in general relativity).

<text>Pomaks (; Macedonian: Помаци ; ) are Bulgarian-speaking Muslims inhabiting Bulgaria, northwestern Turkey, and northeastern Greece. The strong ethno-confessional minority in Bulgaria is recognized officially as Bulgarian Muslims by the government. The term has also been used as a wider designation, including also the Slavic Muslim populations of North Macedonia and Albania.

Most Pomaks today live in Turkey, where they have settled as muhacirs as a result of escaping previous ethnic cleansing in Bulgaria.

Bulgaria recognizes their language as a Bulgarian dialect whereas in Greece and Turkey they self-declare their language as the Pomak language. The community in Greece is commonly fluent in Greek, and in Turkey, Turkish, while the communities in these two countries, especially in Turkey, are increasingly adopting Turkish as their first language as a result of education and family links with the Turkish people.

They are not officially recognized as one people with the ethnonym of &quot;Pomaks&quot;. The term is widely used colloquially for Eastern South Slavic Muslims, considered derogatory. However, in Greece and Turkey the practice for declaring the ethnic group at census has been abolished for decades. Different members of the group today declare a variety of ethnic identities: Bulgarian, Pomak, ethnic Muslims, Turkish and other.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Pomak&quot; first appeared in the Bulgarian Christian-heretical language surroundings of North Bulgaria (the regions of Loveč, Teteven, Lukovit, Bjala Slatina). According to one theory, it comes from the expression &quot;по-ямак&quot; (&quot;more than a Yemek&quot;, &quot;more important than a Yamak&quot;, similar to &quot;пó юнак&quot;, i.e. &quot;more than a hero&quot;). It has also been argued that the name comes from the dialectal words &quot;помáкан, омáкан, омáчен, помáчен&quot; (pomákan, omákan, omáčeen, pomáčen), meaning &quot;tormented, tortured&quot;.

== Origins ==
Their precise origin has been interpreted differently by Bulgarian, Greek and Turkish historians, but it is generally considered they are descendants of native Eastern Orthodox Bulgarians, and Paulicians who also previously converted to Orthodoxy and Catholicism, who converted to Islam during the Ottoman rule of the Balkans. Information through Ottoman and Catholic missionaries reports supports this theory.

=== Genetic studies ===
A specific DNA mutation, HbO, which emerged about 2,000 years ago on a rare haplotype is characteristic of the Greek Pomaks. Its frequency increased as a consequence of high genetic drift within this population. This indicates that the Greek Pomaks are an isolated population with limited contacts with their neighbours. A 2014 study also confirmed high homozygosity and according to MDS analysis the Greek Pomaks cluster among European populations, near the general Greek population.

== History ==
Pomaks are today usually considered descendants of native Orthodox Bulgarians and Paulicians who converted to Islam during the Ottoman rule of the Balkans. They started to become Muslim gradually, from the Ottoman occupation (early 15th century) to the end of the 18th century. Subsequently, these people became part of the Muslim community of the millet system. At that time people were bound to their millets by their religious affiliations (or their confessional communities), rather than their ethnic origins, according to the &quot;millet&quot; concept.

A monk Pachomios Roussanos (1508–1553), who visited the mountain area of Xanthi, mentioned that around 1550 only 6 or 9 villages had turned to Islam. Furthermore the documents show that not only Islam has been spread in the area at that time, but that the Pomaks participated in Ottoman military operations voluntarily as is the case with the village of Shahin (Echinos).

In North Central Bulgaria (the regions of Lovech, Teteven, Lukovit, Byala Slatina) the Ottoman authorities requested in 1689, after the Chiprovtsi Uprising, for military reasons Bulgarian Paulicians (heterodox Christian sect) to convert to one of the officially recognized religions in the Ottoman Empire. One part of them became the &quot;Bulgarian-Christians&quot; by converting to Ottoman recognized Christian denominations, either the Eastern Orthodox Christian Church or the Roman Catholic Church, while the other part converted to Islam and began to be called &quot;Pomaks&quot;. So, in North Central Bulgaria Pomaks became those of Bulgarian Christian heretics, for which it was unacceptable or impossible to convert to the Eastern Orthodox Christian because of dogmatic, economic, family or other reasons.
The mass turn to Islam in the Central Rhodope Mountains happened between the 16th and the 17th century. According to the Codes of Bishop of Philippoupolis and the Czech historian and slavicist Konstantin Josef Jireček in the middle of the 17th century, some Bulgarian provosts agreed to become Muslim en masse. They visited the Ottoman local administrator to announce their decision, but he sent them to the Greek bishop of Philippoupolis Gabriel (1636–1672). The bishop could not change their mind. According to the verbal tradition of the Greeks of Philippoupolis, a large ceremony of mass circumcision took place in front of the old mosque of the city, near the Government House. After that, the villagers became Muslim, too. According to the verbal tradition of the Bulgarians, Grand Vizier Köprülü Mehmed Pasha (1656–1661) threatened the Bulgarians of Chepino Valley that he would execute them if they didn&#x27;t turn to Islam. In 1656, Ottoman military troops entered the Chepino valley and arrested the local Bulgarian provosts, in order to transfer them in the local Ottoman administrator. There, they converted to Islam. Grand Vizier Mehmed Köprülü, after the mass Islamization, destroyed 218 churches and 336 chapels in these areas. A lot of Bulgarians preferred to die instead of becoming Muslim. According to recent investigations the theory of forced conversion to Islam, supported by some scientists, has no solid grounds with all or most evidence being faked or misinterpreted. At the same time, the sincerity of the convert is a subject to suspicion and interrogation. Some authors for example, explain the mass conversions that occurred in the 17th century with the tenfold increase of the Jizya tax. Muslim communities prospered under the Ottoman Empire, as the Sultan was also the Caliph. Ottoman law did not recognize such notions as ethnicity or citizenship; thus, a Muslim of any ethnic background enjoyed precisely the same rights and privileges.
Meanwhile, the perception of the &quot;millet&quot; concept was altered during the 19th century and rise of nationalism within the Ottoman Empire begun. After the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), Pomaks in the Vacha valley, apprehensive of retribution for their role in the bloody suppression of the April Uprising two years earlier, rebelled against Eastern Rumelia and established an autonomous state, called Republic of Tamrash. In 1886 the Ottoman government accepted the Bulgarian rule over Eastern Rumelia and that was the end of the free Pomak state. During the Balkan Wars, at 16 August 1913, an Islamic revolt begun in the Eastern Rhodopes and Western Thrace. On 1 September 1913, the &quot;Provisional Government of Western Thrace&quot; (Garbi Trakya Hukumet i Muvakkatesi) was established in Komotini. The Ottoman administration didn&#x27;t support the rebels and finally under the neutrality of Greek and Ottoman governments, Bulgaria took over the lands on 30 October 1913. The rebels requested support by the Greek state and put Greek major in Alexandroupoli. Bulgaria, after a brief period of control over the area, passed the sovereignty of Western Thrace at the end of World War I. The Provisional Government was revived between 1919 and 1920 under French protectorate (France had annexed the region from Bulgaria in 1918) before Greece took over in June 1920.

After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire following the First World War, the religious &quot;millet&quot; system disappeared and the members of the Pomak groups today declare a variety of ethnic identities, depending predominantly on the country they live in.

== Language ==

There is no specific Pomak dialect of the Bulgarian language. Within Bulgaria, the Pomaks speak almost the same dialects as those spoken by the Christian Bulgarians with which they live side by side and Pomaks living in different regions speak different dialects. In Bulgaria there is a trend for dialects to give way to the standard Bulgarian language and this is also affecting the dialects spoken by the Pomaks and their usage is now rare in urban areas and among younger people. As part of the wider Pomak community, the Torbeshi and Gorani in North Macedonia, Albania and Kosovo speak Macedonian or Torlakian dialects (incl. the Gora dialect), which are sometimes also considered to be part of the &quot;wider Bulgarian dialect continuum&quot;.

Most Pomaks speak some of the Eastern Bulgarian dialects, mainly the Rup dialects in Southern Bulgaria and the Balkan dialects in Northern Bulgaria. The Pomaks living in the Bulgarian part of the Rhodopes speak the Rhodope (especially the Smolyan, Chepino, Hvoyna and Zlatograd subdialects) and Western Rup (especially the Babyak and Gotse Delchev sub-dialects) dialects. The Smolyan dialect is also spoken by the Pomaks living in the Western Thrace region of Greece. The Pomaks living in the region of Teteven in Northern Bulgaria speak the Balkan dialect, specifically the Transitional Balkan sub-dialect. The Rup dialects of the Bulgarian language spoken in Western Thrace are called in Greece Pomak language (Pomaktsou). Similar to Paulician dialect, it has words and resemblance to the grammatical forms of the Armenian language

The Pomak language is taught at primary school level (using the Greek alphabet) in the Pomak regions of Greece, which are primarily in the Rhodope Mountains. The Pomaks of Thrace were, together with Turks and Roma, exempted from the population exchanges provided by the Lausanne Treaty (1923). The treaty made no mention of their language, but declared that their languages of education should be Turkish and Greek. The main school manual used for the teaching the language is &#x27;Pomaktsou&#x27; by Moimin Aidin and Omer Hamdi, Komotini 1997. There is also a Pomak-Greek dictionary by Ritvan Karahodja, 1996. The Pomak dialects are on the Eastern side of the Yat isogloss of Bulgarian, yet many pockets of western Bulgarian speakers remain. A large number of them no longer transmit it; they have adopted Turkish as a first language and Greek as a second language. Recently the Community of the Pomaks of Xanthi, has announced its request to be treated equally and therefore to have the right of education in Greek schools without the obligation of learning the Turkish language.

== Population ==

=== Bulgaria ===

The Pomaks in Bulgaria are referred to as &quot;Bulgarian Muslims&quot; (българи-мюсюлмани &quot;Balgari-Myusyulmani&quot;), and under the locally used names &quot;Ahryani&quot; (pejorative, meaning &quot;infidels&quot;), Pogantsi, Poturani, Poturnatsi, Eruli, Charaklii, etc. They mainly inhabit the Rhodope Mountains in Smolyan Province, Kardzhali Province, Pazardzhik Province and Blagoevgrad Province. There are Pomaks in other parts of Bulgaria as well. There are a few Pomak villages in Burgas Province, Lovech Province, Veliko Tarnovo Province and Ruse Province. Officially no ethnic Pomaks are recorded, while 67,000 declared Muslim and ethnic Bulgarian identity, down from 131,000 who declared Muslim Bulgarian identity at the 2001 census. Unofficially, there may be between 150,000 and 250,000 Pomaks in Bulgaria, though maybe not in the ethnic sense as one part declare Bulgarian, another part – Turkish ethnic identity. During the 20th century the Pomaks in Bulgaria were the subject of three state-sponsored forced assimilation campaigns – in 1912, the 1940s and the 1960s and 1970s which included the change of their Turkish-Arabic names to ethnic Bulgarian Christian Orthodox ones and in the first campaign conversions from Islam to Eastern Orthodoxy. The first two campaigns were abandoned after a few years, while the third was reversed in 1989. The campaigns were carried out under the pretext that the Pomaks as ancestral Christian Bulgarians who had been converted to Islam and who therefore needed to be repatriated back to the national domain. These attempts were met with stiff resistance by many Pomaks.

=== Turkey ===
Pomaks in Turkey community is present mostly in Eastern Thrace and to a lesser extent in Anatolia, where they are called in Turkish &quot;Pomaklar&quot;, and their speech, &quot;Pomakça&quot;. The Pomak community in Turkey is unofficially estimated to be between 300,000 and 600,000.

=== Greece ===
Today the Pomaks () in Greece inhabit the region of East Macedonia and Thrace in Northern Greece, particularly the eastern regional units of Xanthi, Rhodope and Evros. Their estimated population is 50,000, only in Western Thrace. Until the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922) and the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923 did Pomaks inhabit a part of the regions of Moglena – Almopia (Karadjova), Kastoria and some other parts of Greek Macedonia and North Macedonia. German sightseer Adolf Struck in 1898 describes Konstantia (in Moglena) as a big village with 300 houses and two panes, inhabited exclusively by Pomaks. Greek nationalist scholars and government officials frequently refer to the Pomaks as &quot;slavicised&quot; Greek Muslims, to give the impression and support Greek narratives that they are the descendants of Ottoman-era Greek converts to Islam like the Vallahades of Greek Macedonia.

=== North Macedonia ===
The Macedonian Muslims (or &quot;Torbeši&quot;), are also referred to as Pomaks, especially in historical context. They are a minority religious group in North Macedonia, although not all espouse a Macedonian national identity and are linguistically distinct from the larger Muslim ethnic groups in the country, Albanians and Turks. However the estimated 100,000 Pomaks in North Macedonia maintain a strong affiliation to the Turkish identity.

=== Albania ===
Slavic-speaking Muslims, sometimes referred to as &quot;Pomaks&quot;, live also in the Albanian region of Golloborda. However these people are also referred to as &quot;Torbeš&quot;. Within Macedonian academia, their language has been regarded as Macedonian, while within Bulgarian academia, their dialect is considered as part of the Bulgarian language. Part of this people still self-identify as Bulgarians.

=== Kosovo ===
The Gorani occasionally are also referred to as Pomaks in historical context. They are people who inhabit the Gora region, located between Albania, Kosovo and North Macedonia. The general view is that they should be treated as a distinct minority group. Part of these people are already albanised. By the last censuses at the end of the 20th century in Yugoslavia they had declared themselves to be ethnic Muslims, like Bosniaks.

<text>The Czechs (, ; singular Czech, masculine: &quot;Čech&quot; , singular feminine: &quot;Češka&quot; ), or the Czech people (), are a West Slavic ethnic group and a nation native to the Czech Republic in Central Europe, who share a common ancestry, culture, history, and the Czech language.

Ethnic Czechs were called Bohemians in English until the early 20th century, referring to the former name of their country, Bohemia, which in turn was adapted from the late Iron Age tribe of Celtic Boii. During the Migration Period, West Slavic tribes settled in the area, &quot;assimilated the remaining Celtic and Germanic populations&quot;, and formed a principality in the 9th century, which was initially part of Great Moravia, in form of Duchy of Bohemia and later Kingdom of Bohemia, the predecessors of the modern republic.

The Czech diaspora is found in notable numbers in the United States, Germany, Canada, Slovakia, Austria, the United Kingdom, Argentina, Australia, Switzerland, France, Russia, Italy, Israel, Brazil, and Romania among others.

== Ethnology ==
The Czech ethnic group is part of the West Slavic subgroup of the larger Slavic ethno-linguistical group. The West Slavs have their origin in early Slavic tribes which settled in Central Europe after East Germanic tribes had left this area during the migration period. The West Slavic tribe of Czechs settled in the area of Bohemia during the migration period, and assimilated the remaining Celtic and Germanic populations. In the 9th century the Duchy of Bohemia, under the Přemyslid dynasty, was formed, which had been part of Great Moravia under Svatopluk I. According to mythology, the founding father of the Czech people was Forefather Čech, who according to legend brought the tribe of Czechs into its land.

The Czechs are closely related to the neighbouring Slovaks (with whom they constituted Czechoslovakia 1918–1939, 1945-1992). The Czech–Slovak languages form a dialect continuum rather than being two clearly distinct languages. Czech cultural influence in Slovak culture is noted as having been much higher than the other way around. Czech (Slavic) people have a long history of coexistence with the Germanic people. In the 17th century, German replaced Czech in central and local administration; upper classes in Bohemia and Moravia were Germanized, and espoused a political identity (&quot;&quot;), while Czech ethnic identity survived among the lower and lower-middle classes. The Czech National Revival took place in the 18th and 19th centuries aiming to revive Czech language, culture and national identity. The Czechs were the initiators of Pan-Slavism.

The Czech ethnonym (archaic &quot;&quot;) was the name of a Slavic tribe in central Bohemia that subdued the surrounding tribes in the late 9th century and created the Czech/Bohemian state. The origin of the name of the tribe itself is unknown. According to legend, it comes from their leader Čech, who brought them to Bohemia. The exact etymology of &quot;Čech&quot; is uncertain, with most common derivation relating it to the root &quot;čel-&quot; (member of the people, kinsman). The Czech ethnonym was adopted by the Moravians in the 19th century.

== Genetics ==

Czechs, like most Europeans, largely descend from three distinct lineages: Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, descended from a Cro-Magnon population that arrived in Europe about 45,000 years ago, Neolithic farmers who migrated from Anatolia during the Neolithic Revolution 9,000 years ago, and Yamnaya steppe pastoralists who expanded into Europe from the Pontic–Caspian steppe in the context of Indo-European migrations 5000 years ago.

The population of the Czech lands has been influenced by different human migrations that wide-crossed Europe over time. In their Y-DNA haplogroups, which are inherited along the male line, Czechs have shown a mix of Eastern and Western European traits. Studies on 1750 and 257 samples found out frequenices of R1a (34.2-36.94%), R1b (24.78%-28.0%), I2 (11.3%), I1 (8.33%), E (5.1-6.63%), G (5.1%), J2 (3.5%), J1 (0-2%), and N (1.6%). The haplogroup R1a is predominantly represented by its more Western Slavic clade R1a-M458 (&gt;30%) as more Eastern Slavic clade R-M558 is in a small minority (&lt;6%). Based on haplotype similarity, Czechs are most similar to neighboring Slovaks, but although &quot;a sharp genetic border was found between Poland and Germany, the frequency distribution of haplotypes in the Czech Republic and its neighbours resembles far more a smooth cline than a sharp border&quot;. A mtDNA study of 179 individuals from Western Bohemia showed that 3% had East Eurasian lineages that perhaps entered the gene pool through admixture with Central Asian nomadic tribes in the early Middle Ages.

== History ==
The population of the Czech Republic descends from diverse peoples of Slavic, Celtic and Germanic origin. Presence of West Slavs in the 6th century during the Migration Period has been documented on the Czech territory. Slavs settled in Bohemia, Moravia and Austria sometime during the 6th or 7th centuries, and &quot;assimilated the remaining Celtic and Germanic populations&quot;. According to a popular myth, the Slavs came with Forefather Čech who settled at the Říp Mountain.

During the 7th century, the Frankish merchant Samo, supporting the Slavs fighting against nearby settled Avars, became the ruler of the first known Slav state in Central Europe, Samo&#x27;s Empire. The principality Great Moravia, controlled by the Moymir dynasty, arose in the 8th century and reached its zenith in the 9th (during the reign of Svatopluk I of Moravia) when it held off the influence of the Franks. Great Moravia was Christianized, the crucial role played Byzantine mission of Cyril and Methodius. The Duchy of Bohemia emerged in the late 9th century. In 880, Prague Castle was constructed by Prince Bořivoj, founder of the Přemyslid dynasty and the city of Prague was established. Vratislav II was the first Czech king in 1085 and the duchy was raised to a hereditary kingdom under Ottokar I in 1198.

The second half of the 13th century was a period of advancing German immigration into the Czech lands. The number of Czechs who have at least partly German ancestry today probably runs into hundreds of thousands. The Habsburg Monarchy focused much of its power on religious wars against the Protestants. While these religious wars were taking place, the Czech estates revolted against Habsburg from 1546 to 1547 but were ultimately defeated.
Defenestrations of Prague in 1618, signaled an open revolt by the Bohemian estates against the Habsburgs and started the Thirty Years&#x27; War. After the Battle of White Mountain in 1620, all Czech lands were declared hereditary property of the Habsburg family. The German language was made equal to the Czech language.

Czech patriotic authors tend to call the following period, from 1620 to 1648 until the late 18th century, the &quot;Dark Age&quot;. It is characterized by devastation by foreign troops; Germanization; and economic and political decline. It is estimated that the population of the Czech lands declined by a third.

The 18th and 19th century is characterized by the Czech National Revival, focusing to revive Czech culture and national identity.

Since the turn of the 20th century, Chicago is the city with the third largest Czech population, after Prague and Vienna.

During World War I, Czechoslovak Legions fought in France, Italy and Russia against the Central Powers. In 1918 the independent state of Czechoslovakia was proclaimed. Czechs formed the leading class in the new state emerging from the remnants of the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy.

After 1933, Czechoslovakia remained the only democracy in central and eastern Europe. However, in 1938 the Munich Agreement severed the Sudetenland, with a considerable Czech minority, from Czechoslovakia, and in 1939 the German Nazi regime established the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia for &quot;Resttschechei&quot; (the rump Czech state). Emil Hácha became president of the protectorate under Nazi domination, which only allowed pro-Nazi Czech associations and tended to stress ties of the Czechs with the Bohemian Germans and other parts of the German people, in order to facilitate assimilation by Germanization. In Lidice, Ležáky and Javoříčko the Nazi authorities committed war crimes against the local Czech population. On 2 May 1945, the Prague Uprising reached its peak, supported by the Russian Liberation Army. The post-war expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia and the immediate reprisals against Germans and Nazi collaborators by Czech resistance and the Czechoslovak state authorities, made Czechs—especially in the early 1950s—settle alongside Slovaks and Romani people in the former lands of the Sudeten Germans, who had been deported to East Germany, West Germany and Austria according to the Potsdam Conference and Yalta Conference.

The Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 was followed by a wave of emigration, unseen before and stopped shortly after in 1969 (estimate: 70,000 immediately, 300,000 in total), typically of highly qualified people.

Tens of thousands of Czechs had repatriated from Volhynia and Banat after World War II. Since the 1990s, the Czech Republic has been working to repatriate Romania and Kazakhstan&#x27;s ethnic Czechs.

Following the Czech Republic&#x27;s entry into the European Union in May 2004, Czechs gradually gained the right to work in EU countries without a work permit.

=== The arts ===
==== Music ====

Czech music had its first significant pieces created in the 11th century. The great progress of Czech artificial music began with the end of the Renaissance and the early Baroque era, concretely in works of Adam Václav Michna z Otradovic, where the specific character of Czech music was rising up by using the influence of genuine folk music. This tradition determined the development of Czech music and has remained the main sign in the works of great Czech composers of almost all eras – Jan Dismas Zelenka and Josef Mysliveček in Baroque, Bedřich Smetana and Antonín Dvořák in Romanticism, Leoš Janáček, Bohuslav Martinů and Josef Suk in modern classical or Petr Eben and Miloslav Kabeláč in contemporary classical music.

Czech musicians also played an important role in the development of European music. Jan Václav Antonín Stamic in 18th-century contributed to the creation of Classicism in music by innovations of compositional forms and the founding of the Mannheim school. Similarly, Antonín Rejcha&#x27;s experiments prefigured new compositional techniques in the 19th century. The influence of Czech musicians expanded beyond the borders of the European continent, when Antonín Dvořák created a new American classical music style, using the richness of ethnic music of that country during his mission in the US. The contribution of Alois Hába to microtonal music in the 20th century must be also mentioned.

Czech music reached as far as Qing China. Karel Slavíček was a Jesuit missionary, scientist and sinologist who was introduced to the Kangxi Emperor on 3 February 1717, in Beijing. The emperor favored him and employed him as court musician. (Slavíček was a Spinet player).

Some notable modern Czech musicians are US-based composer and guitarist Ivan Král, musician and composer Jan Hammer and the rock band The Plastic People of the Universe which played an important part in the underground movement during the communist regime.

Czech culture involves many saints, most notably St. Wenceslaus (Václav), patron of the Czech nation, St. John of Nepomuk (Jan Nepomucký), St. Adalbert (Vojtěch), Saint Procopius or St. Agnes of Bohemia (Anežka Česká). Although not a Christian, rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel of Prague, a 16th Century scholar and one of the most influential figures of Jewish history, is considered to be part of the country&#x27;s religious legacy as well.

=== Natives ===
The modern Czech nation was formed through the process of the Czech national revival. Through this was created the linguistic concept of the Czech nation (particularly promoted by Jungmann), i.e. &quot;a Czech = one who has the Czech language as their first language: naturally or by choice.&quot; (That is why Slovaks who have chosen Czech as their literary language, such as Ján Kollár or Pavel Jozef Šafařík, are often considered to be Czechs.) Like other nations, Czechs also speak of two alternative concepts: the landed concept (a Czech is someone who was born in the historic Czech territory), which in Jungmann&#x27;s time primarily denoted nobility, and the ethnic concept. Definition by territory is still discussed alternative, from time to time is indicated for Czechs number of natives (speaking mostly German, English or otherwise) – these include US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, film director Karel Reisz, actor Herbert Lom, the founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud, the founder of genetics Gregor Mendel, logician and mathematician Kurt Gödel, the philosopher Edmund Husserl, scientists Gerty Cori, Carl Cori and Peter Grünberg (all Nobel Prize winners) and Ernst Mach, economists Joseph Schumpeter and Eugen Böhm von Bawerk, philosophers Bernard Bolzano, Ernest Gellner, Vilém Flusser and Herbert Feigl, Marxist theoretician Karl Kautsky, astronomer Johann Palisa, legal theorist Hans Kelsen, inventors Alois Senefelder and Viktor Kaplan, automotive designer Ferdinand Porsche, psychologist Max Wertheimer, a geologist Karl von Terzaghi, musicologists Eduard Hanslick and Guido Adler, chemist Johann Josef Loschmidt, biologists Heinrich Wilhelm Schott and Georg Joseph Kamel, the founder of the dermatology Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra, peace activist Bertha von Suttner (Nobel Peace Prize), the composers Gustav Mahler, Heinrich Biber, Viktor Ullmann, Ervin Schulhoff, Pavel Haas, Erich Wolfgang Korngold and Ralph Benatzky, writers Franz Kafka, Reiner Maria Rilke, Max Brod, Karl Kraus, Franz Werfel, Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach, Leo Perutz, Tom Stoppard and Egon Erwin Kisch, painters Anton Raphael Mengs and Emil Orlik, architects Adolf Loos, Peter Parler, Josef Hoffmann, Jan Santini Aichel and Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer, cellist David Popper, violist Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst, pianists Alice Herz-Sommer and Rudolf Serkin, president of Austria Karl Renner, Prime Minister of Poland Jerzy Buzek, industrialist Oskar Schindler, or chess player Wilhelm Steinitz.

== Geography ==
The Czechs live in three historical lands: Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia; these regions make up the modern Czech Republic. However, the country is now divided into 14 administrative regions. The local culture varies somewhat in each of the historical regions. Moravians are usually more nationalistic regional patriots of Moravia, but they also speak Czech. Local dialects (such as Central Bohemian, the Chod dialect, Moravian dialects, Cieszyn Silesian, etc.) are found in various parts of the country.

== Czech language ==

The Czech language is spoken by approximately 12 million people around the world, but the vast majority are in the Czech Republic. It developed from the Proto-Slavic language in the 10th century and is mutually intelligible with the Slovak language.

== Religion ==
In 1977, Richard Felix Staar described Czechs as &quot;tolerant and even indifferent towards religion as a rule&quot;.

After the Bohemian Reformation, most Czechs (about 85%) became followers of Jan Hus, Petr Chelčický and other regional Protestant Reformers. Bohemian Estates&#x27; defeat in the Battle of White Mountain brought radical religious changes and started a series of intense actions taken by the Habsburgs in order to bring the Czech population back to the Roman Catholic Church. After the Habsburgs regained control of Bohemia, Czech people were forcibly converted to Roman Catholicism. All kinds of Protestant communities including the various branches of Hussites, Lutherans and Reformed were either expelled, killed, or converted to Catholicism. The Catholic Church lost the bulk of its adherents during the Communist era.

As of 2015, Pew Research Center found in that 72% of the population of Czech Republic declared to be irreligious, a category which includes atheists, agnostics and those who describe their religion as &quot;nothing in particular&quot;, 26% were Christians (vast majority Catholics), while 2% belonged to other faiths.

== Demographics ==
In the Czech Republic, the nation state of the Czech people, 6,732,104 (63.7%) declared as ethnic Czech according to the 2011 census. Notably, another 2,742,669 (26%) were undeclared, and 522,474 (4.9%) declared as Moravians. There is a large Czech diaspora, which includes 1,703,930 Americans of Czech/Czechoslovak ancestry, 94,805 Canadians of Czech ancestry, an estimated 45,000 Czech-born residents in the United Kingdom, and ca. 31,000 in Australia. There are smaller communities throughout Europe. Number of Israelis of Czech-Jewish ancestry is estimated to be about 50,000 to 100,000.

<doc id="151874" wikidata="Q2265203" url="?curid=151874" title="Jefferson Starship">
<text>Jefferson Starship is an American rock band from San Francisco, California, formed in 1974 by a group of musicians including former members of Jefferson Airplane. Between 1974 and 1984, they released eight gold or platinum-selling studio albums, and one gold-selling compilation. The album &quot;Red Octopus&quot; went double-platinum, reaching No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in 1975. The band went through several major changes in personnel and genres through the years while retaining the Jefferson Starship name. The band name was retired in 1984, but it was picked up again in 1992 by a revival of the group led by Paul Kantner, which has continued since his death in 2016.

The group was formed by former Jefferson Airplane members Kantner and Grace Slick, and evolved from several solo albums they had recorded. They were joined by David Freiberg, Craig Chaquico, John Barbata, Pete Sears, and Papa John Creach. Former Airplane frontman Marty Balin subsequently joined the group in 1975, and the following year&#x27;s album &quot;Spitfire&quot; was a top five hit. Slick and Balin both left the group in 1978, leaving the remaining members to recruit Mickey Thomas as their replacement. In 1981 Slick rejoined the group, which continued with minor chart success. Kantner quit in 1984 and took legal action towards using the name; the remaining members became Starship. Kantner reformed the group as Jefferson Starship: The Next Generation in 1992, which toured regularly throughout that decade and into the 21st century. After Kantner&#x27;s death, the group continued with new members. Craig Chaquico filed a lawsuit against them in 2016 for continuing to use the name, and the suit was consequently settled.

==History==
===1970–1974: Origins===
In 1970, while Jefferson Airplane was on break from touring, singer-guitarist Paul Kantner recorded &quot;Blows Against the Empire&quot;. This was a concept album featuring an ad hoc group of musicians (centered on Kantner, Grace Slick, Joey Covington, and Jack Casady of Jefferson Airplane; David Crosby and Graham Nash; and Grateful Dead members Jerry Garcia, Mickey Hart, and Bill Kreutzmann) credited on the LP as Paul Kantner and &quot;Jefferson Starship&quot;, marking the first use of that name. This agglomeration was informally known as the Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra, a moniker later used on a Kantner album in the early 1980s.

On &quot;Blows Against the Empire&quot;, Kantner and Slick sang about a group of people escaping Earth in a hijacked starship. In 1971, the album was nominated for the prestigious science fiction prize, the Hugo Award, a rare honor for a musical recording. Kantner and Slick were a couple during this period. Slick was pregnant during the recording of the album. Their daughter, China, was born shortly thereafter.

Kantner and Slick with the Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra released two follow-up albums: &quot;Sunfighter&quot;, an environmentalism-tinged album released in 1971 to celebrate China&#x27;s birth, and 1973&#x27;s &quot;Baron von Tollbooth &amp; the Chrome Nun&quot;, titled after the nicknames David Crosby had given to the couple. Bassist/keyboardist/vocalist David Freiberg was given equal billing alongside Kantner and Slick on the latter album. A founding member of Quicksilver Messenger Service, Freiberg had known and played with Kantner on the folk circuit in the early 1960s and sang background vocals on &quot;Blows Against the Empire&quot;. Following a marijuana arrest that resulted in his departure from Quicksilver in 1971, he joined Jefferson Airplane as a vocalist for their 1972 tour, documented on the live album &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Winterland&quot; (1973).

Kantner was introduced to the teenage guitarist Craig Chaquico through his friend and fellow musician, Jack Traylor, during this time. Chaquico, a high school English student of Traylor&#x27;s and a member in his band Steelwind, played guitar on the song &quot;Earth Mother&quot; from &quot;Sunfighter&quot;. Chaquico would go on to perform with Kantner and Slick on their subsequent album collaborations, then with Jefferson Starship, and finally with Starship until 1990.

Early in 1974, Slick released &quot;Manhole&quot;, her first solo album. Appearing along with Slick on &quot;Manhole&quot; were Kantner, Freiberg, Chaquico, Jack Casady, David Crosby, and the London Symphony Orchestra. It was on that album that Kantner, Slick, and Freiberg next worked with bassist and keyboard player Pete Sears (who had first played on Papa John Creach&#x27;s first solo album). Sears, was co-producing a Kathi McDonald album in the same studio. Sears wrote the music to Slick&#x27;s lyrics for the song &quot;Better Lying Down,&quot; and also played bass on the song &quot;Epic #38&quot;. It was during this session at Wally Heider studios in San Francisco that Kantner and Slick first approached Sears about playing in what would eventually become Jefferson Starship. Sears would eventually join Jefferson Starship in June 1974, replacing Peter Kaukonen.

In early 1974, with guitarist Jorma Kaukonen and bass player Jack Casady having moved on to their band Hot Tuna full-time, Kantner decided to put together a touring band without them. The musicians on &quot;Baron von Tollbooth &amp; the Chrome Nun&quot; formed the core of a new lineup that was formally reborn as Jefferson Starship. They appropriated the name from Kantner&#x27;s &quot;Blows Against the Empire&quot;, with manager Bill Thompson convincing the group that keeping the connection to Jefferson Airplane made sense from a business standpoint. It included the other five remaining members of Jefferson Airplane, including Kantner on rhythm guitar and vocals; Slick on vocals and percussion, David Freiberg on vocals and keyboards, John Barbata, who had played with the Turtles and Crosby, Stills and Nash, on drums and Papa John Creach, from Hot Tuna, on electric violin. Jorma Kaukonen&#x27;s brother, Peter (who had appeared on the albums &quot;Blows Against the Empire&quot; and &quot;Sunfighter&quot;), was on bass. On lead guitar was Craig Chaquico who had played on three of Kantner and Slick&#x27;s solo albums, as well as in the band Steelwind. The band began rehearsals in January 1974 and opened its first tour in Chicago on March 19. By April, it was decided that the band would go into the studio to record an album. British veteran Pete Sears, who had worked on Slick&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Manhole&quot;, and played with Rod Stewart, was selected to replace Peter Kaukonen as the band&#x27;s bass player.

===1974–1978: Balin on board and commercial apogee===

In 1974, after touring as &quot;Jefferson Starship,&quot; Kantner, Slick, Freiberg, Chaquico, Pete Sears, Papa John Creach, and John Barbata recorded the album &quot;Dragon Fly&quot;. Jorma Kaukonen&#x27;s brother Peter had played bass during the group&#x27;s spring tour in 1974, but was replaced by Pete Sears who, like Freiberg, played bass and keyboards. Kantner collaborated with Marty Balin on the song &quot;Caroline&quot; during the recording sessions, for which Balin sang vocals on the album. &quot;Dragon Fly&quot; was certified gold, and included the single &quot;Ride the Tiger&quot; (#84 US Billboard) and its B-side &quot;Hyperdrive&quot;. Balin then appeared on-stage with the band to perform the song &quot;Caroline&quot; for a show at the Winterland ballroom in November 1974.
Their followup album, 1975&#x27;s &quot;Red Octopus&quot;, had even greater success. Marty Balin, who had contributed and sung the ballad &quot;Caroline&quot; on the previous album, officially returned to the Jefferson fold as a full-time member in January 1975 and stayed with the group for nearly the remainder of the decade. The Balin penned single &quot;Miracles” peaked at No. 3 on the chart, and along with the single “Play on Love” (#49 US Billboard Chart), helped to propel the album to eventual multiple-platinum status and topping the Billboard 200 chart. It would be the biggest selling album of the band&#x27;s career. Creach quietly left the group soon after in August 1975 to pursue a solo career.

The next album, &quot;Spitfire&quot;, was released in June 1976 and went platinum. It spent six weeks at No. 3 on the Billboard charts, and included the singles &quot;With Your Love&quot; (#12 US Billboard Chart) and &quot;St. Charles&quot; (#64 US Billboard Chart). Regardless of this success, the band considered the album&#x27;s sales to be relatively disappointing compared to its predecessor and requested an audit from RCA Records, distributor of their Grunt label. RCA subsequently put a reported $500,000 into the next Jefferson Starship project. &quot;Earth&quot; was released in February 1978 and also went platinum. The album featured the singles &quot;Count on Me&quot; (No. 8 US Billboard Chart), &quot;Runaway&quot; (No. 12 US Billboard Chart), and &quot;Crazy Feelin&#x27;&quot; (No. 54 US Billboard Chart). Tours of the U.S. and Europe would soon follow.

Balin&#x27;s reluctance to tour had kept the band off the road for over a year, and Slick&#x27;s alcoholism increasingly became a problem, which led to two consecutive nights of disastrous concerts in West Germany in June 1978. On the first night, the band was scheduled to play at the Loreley Amphitheatre, on the bill with Leo Kottke and the Atlanta Rhythm Section, but Slick was unable to perform and the show was cancelled. The show was rescheduled for July 2, but the audience were unhappy with this and began rioting, destroying or stealing some of the band&#x27;s gear. The band acquired replacement gear for the following day&#x27;s show in Hamburg, which was marred by a drunken Slick continually swearing and insulting the audience throughout the show. She repeatedly asked &quot;Who won the war?&quot;, and implied that all Germans were responsible for the wartime atrocities. Slick later described her behavior as a deliberate provocation to force her departure. Kantner subsequently asked for Slick&#x27;s resignation from the band, and she left the group at this time.

Towards the end of 1978, a Jefferson Starship that was now without Grace Slick but still including Marty Balin recorded the single &quot;Light the Sky on Fire&quot; (No. 66 US Billboard Chart) for television&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot;. It was released as a promotional tie-in to the special (backed with &quot;Hyperdrive&quot; from &quot;Dragon Fly&quot;), and was also included as a bonus with their greatest hits album &quot;Gold&quot; (1979), which highlighted their work from 1974&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Fly&quot; to 1978&#x27;s &quot;Earth&quot;. In October 1978, Marty Balin left the group, leaving the band without a lead singer. That same month, John Barbata was seriously injured in a car accident that forced him to drop out of the group.

===1979–1984: Changing personnel and sound===

In early 1979, the band regrouped. Barbata was replaced on drums by Aynsley Dunbar, who had previously played with Journey, in January 1979. Mickey Thomas (who had sung lead on Elvin Bishop&#x27;s &quot;Fooled Around and Fell in Love&quot;) was invited to audition and then joined the group in April 1979. 
In 1979, the band released their first album without Marty Balin or Grace Slick, the gold-selling &quot;Freedom at Point Zero&quot;. The album was produced by Ron Nevison, who would also produce two of the band&#x27;s following three albums. The single &quot;Jane&quot; (Freiberg, McPherson, Chaquico and Kantner) peaked at No. 14 on the &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot; and spent three weeks at No. 6 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 100.[3] The new lineup toured, augmented by saxophonist Steve Schuster. Schuster, along with horn player David Farey, had previously played on Jefferson Starship&#x27;s 1978 tour, and he had also appeared on &quot;Freedom at Point Zero&quot;.

In early 1981, Grace Slick returned to the band, rejoining in time to sing on one song, &quot;Stranger,&quot; (No. 48 on the &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot; chart), on the group&#x27;s next album, &quot;Modern Times&quot; (1981). &quot;Modern Times&quot;, which also went gold, included the song &quot;Find Your Way Back&quot; (No. 29), as well as the humorous &quot;Stairway to Cleveland&quot;, in which the band defended the numerous changes it had undergone in its musical style, personnel, and even name. &quot;Modern Times&quot; also featured the promo single, &quot;Save Your Love&quot;, (No. 104). Slick remained in the band for Jefferson Starship&#x27;s next album, &quot;Winds of Change&quot; (1982), which was certified gold. &quot;Winds of Change&quot; featured the singles &quot;Be My Lady,&quot; which reached No. 26 in the US, and &quot;Winds of Change&quot; (No. 38). By August 1982, after the recording of &quot;Winds of Change&quot; but prior to the supporting tour, Dunbar was replaced by Donny Baldwin, who had performed with Thomas in the Elvin Bishop Group. Paul Kantner&#x27;s 1983 solo album, &quot;Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra&quot;, included the track &quot;Circle of Fire&quot;, which had been recorded by Jefferson Starship during the &quot;Winds of Change&quot; sessions in 1982. Other members of the band also appeared on additional tracks on this effort.

Around this time, the band began enthusiastically embracing the rock-video age, making elaborate videos typical of the era&#x27;s superstar bands. They would appear frequently on MTV and other music-oriented television shows such as &quot;Solid Gold&quot;, and 1984&#x27;s &quot;Super Night of Rock and Roll&quot;, giving the band a high visibility in the MTV era. Their next album, &quot;Nuclear Furniture&quot; (1984), reached No. 28 and was also certified gold. It featured the singles &quot;No Way Out&quot; (a Top 40 hit, reaching No. 23), &quot;Layin&#x27; It On the Line&quot; (No. 66), and &quot;Sorry Me, Sorry You&quot;.

===1984-1985: Kantner departs and transition to Starship===
While Balin and Slick had come and gone over the years, in June 1984, after the release of &quot;Nuclear Furniture&quot;, Kantner, the last remaining founding member of Jefferson Airplane, left the band due to disputes over the group&#x27;s artistic direction. &quot;I think we would be terrible failures trying to write pop songs all the time. … The band became more mundane and not quite as challenging and not quite as much of a thing to be proud of,&quot; said Kantner.

In October 1984, Kantner took legal action over money he claimed he was owed and to prevent the remaining members from continuing to use the name Jefferson Starship. The lawsuit was settled in March 1985. Kantner received a cash settlement, the name Jefferson Starship became the property of Grace Slick (51%) and Bill Thompson (49%), and all parties agreed to not use the name &quot;Jefferson&quot; going forward. The remaining members renamed themselves Starship, and continued to tour and record music. David Freiberg was dismissed from the band shortly after the lawsuit was settled. Pete Sears departed in 1987. Grace Slick left Starship in early 1988, going on to join the reformed Jefferson Airplane for an album and tour in 1989. Craig Chaquico departed in 1990. The band has been billed as &quot;Starship featuring Mickey Thomas&quot; since 1992.

Shortly after leaving Jefferson Starship, Kantner formed the KBC Band with (among others) his former bandmates Marty Balin and Jack Casady. They released an eponymous album in 1986, but soon broke up after Balin lost interest. In 1988, Kantner toured with Casady in Hot Tuna. This led to a full Jefferson Airplane reunion in 1989, which also resulted in an eponymous album and subsequent tour. In 1991, Kantner toured with an acoustic ensemble called &quot;Paul Kantner&#x27;s Wooden Ships,&quot; a trio that included Slick Aguilar and Tim Gorman from the KBC Band.

===1992–2016: Revival===

Paul Kantner reestablished the band as &quot;Jefferson Starship: The Next Generation&quot; in January 1992, for which Kantner recruited Jack Casady, Papa John Creach, Slick Aguilar, Tim Gorman, former Tubes drummer Prairie Prince, and former World Entertainment War vocalist Darby Gould. In 1993, Balin joined. Creach died in February 1994, weeks after touring Europe. Concurrently, vocalist Diana Mangano joined the group (after a brief spell by original Jefferson Airplane singer Signe Toly Anderson) as Gould&#x27;s replacement.

After the first couple of years, the band dropped the use of &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, and began to perform as simply Jefferson Starship. In 1995 they released &quot;Deep Space / Virgin Sky&quot;, a live album recorded at the House of Blues in West Hollywood, California on January 21, 1995. The album featured eight new and seven classic tunes. Grace Slick joined the band for five songs, &quot;Lawman&quot;, &quot;Wooden Ships&quot;, &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; and &quot;White Rabbit&quot; and &quot;Volunteers&quot;. In 1999 Jefferson Starship released the studio album &quot;Windows of Heaven&quot;, which featured Slick on background vocals on one song, &quot;I&#x27;m On Fire&quot;.

Balin continued as a full-time member of the reunited band until 2003 and continued to occasionally join them in concert up until 2008. Casady remained a member until 2000 and has also (since 1983) played with Jorma Kaukonen in a reunited Hot Tuna. Gorman left in 1995 and was replaced by Gary Cambra (from The Tubes), Barry Flast and then T Lavitz, who stayed with the band for the recording of &quot;Windows of Heaven&quot; but was replaced by former Supremes keyboardist Chris Smith before the album&#x27;s release. In 2005, twenty years after leaving, David Freiberg rejoined the group. Freiberg had apologized to Kantner for not departing the group with him back in 1984, ending their estrangement. Jefferson Starship played three songs on NBC&#x27;s The Today Show on June 30, 2007.

In 2007, Jefferson Starship began working with corporate sponsors. The owners of the name Jefferson Starship, Grace Slick along with manager Bill Thompson, objected. They sued Kantner for the sponsorship and for touring under the Jefferson Starship name, citing their initial separation agreement in 1985. All parties later agreed that Kantner could go forward, after paying Slick and Thompson an undisclosed fee.

Mangano was replaced by vocalist Cathy Richardson in early 2008, and Prince was replaced by the reinstated Baldwin.

In March and May 2008, tracks were recorded for the new studio album released on September 2, 2008, &quot;Jefferson&#x27;s Tree of Liberty&quot;. In addition to the current members, Grace Slick made contributions to the bonus track on the album, and Marty Balin and Jack Casady appear on a recording originally made for &quot;Windows of Heaven&quot;.

In July and August 2008, they played a two-part UK tour, including three nights at the 100 Club in London and an appearance at the Rhythm Festival.

In 2009 they toured as part of the Heroes of Woodstock tour with Jeff Pevar (Jazz Is Dead, Crosby, Pevar &amp; Raymond) on bass. Other musicians included in this tour were Canned Heat, Ten Years After, Country Joe McDonald, Tom Constanten, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Melanie, John Sebastian, Mountain, Quicksilver Messenger Service and Levon Helm Band, although not all artists appeared at every show. On July 3, 2009, Jefferson Starship (Kantner, Freiberg, Baldwin, Aguilar, Smith, and Richardson) performed at the Roswell UFO Parade and Festival, along with guest musicians Tom Constanten, Jack Traylor, Barry Sless, plus former band members Pete Sears and Darby Gould. A four disc live album of this concert, &quot;Tales From the Mothership&quot;, was released in November 2012.

On June 5, 2011, Jefferson Starship (Kantner, Freiberg, Richardson and Smith) performed with the Contemporary Youth Orchestra at Jacobs Pavilion at Nautica in Cleveland, Ohio. The show was broadcast live on HDNet for the HDNet Concert Series.

In 2012, longtime guitarist Slick Aguilar departed the band due to falling ill with Hepatitis C, and was replaced by Jude Gold. In November 2015, a new lead vocalist, Rachel Rose, was phased in to replace the departing Cathy Richardson; sharing the stage with one-time Jefferson Starship vocalist Darby Gould until Richardson announced her return to the band in March 2016. The band has featured guest musicians such as Balin, Gould, Gorman, Jeff Pevar, Tony Morley, Richard Newman, and former Jefferson Starship bassist and keyboardist Pete Sears.

Paul Kantner died from multiple organ failure and septic shock at the age of 74 on January 28, 2016. Signe Toly Anderson, a member of both the initial Jefferson Airplane lineup and the revived Jefferson Starship in the 1990s, also died on January 28, 2016, at age 74.

===2016–present: Post-Kantner era===

Following Paul Kantner&#x27;s death, the band received the approval of both Kantner&#x27;s family and Grace Slick to keep performing. Jefferson Starship has continued to tour with a line-up consisting of remaining members David Freiberg (vocals, guitar), Donny Baldwin (drums), Chris Smith (keyboards), Jude Gold (lead guitar), and Cathy Richardson (vocals, guitar). When Jefferson Starship announced the &#x27;Carry the Fire&#x27; tour in March 2017, Richardson stated that the band&#x27;s continuation is a tribute to both Kantner and Grace Slick, and noted that Slick had granted the current members a lifetime license to use the name Jefferson Starship after Kantner&#x27;s death.

In April 2017, former Jefferson Starship member Craig Chaquico filed a lawsuit against the five individual members (Freiberg, Baldwin, Smith, Gold, and Richardson) currently performing as Jefferson Starship for breaching the 1985 contract and for using Chaquico&#x27;s name and likeness in their promotional materials. About this, Chaquico has said he had only given permission to Paul Kantner to use the name, and by this point, &quot;Freiberg and Baldwin are performing with others who have no connection to the original group, using the name in violation of that agreement. If any of the members who signed the &#x27;85 agreement want to use the name, they need the permission of all the other members who signed the agreement and Freiberg and Baldwin do not have my permission.&quot; On August 11, 2017, U.S. Magistrate Judge Maria-Elena James said the guitarist Craig Chaquico may pursue a breach of contract claim against David Freiberg, Donny Baldwin and the other musicians for performances and merchandising since January 2016, but dismissed Chaquico&#x27;s claims of earlier alleged contract breaches and a trademark claim over the use of his likeness. On August 16, 2018, Judge Maria-Elena James denied Chaquico&#x27;s motion to strike the counter-claims by the current Jefferson Starship band members of intentional interference to gain a potential economic advantage and defamation. The defendants alleged that the plaintiff caused economic harm and attempted to prevent the band from operating by actions such as Chaquico posting statements on his website that they were a &quot;fake band,&quot; they created &quot;fake recordings,&quot; they were a &quot;lesser cover band,&quot; and the members were &quot;lesser artists.&quot; On December 4, 2018, the lawsuit concerning the use of the name Jefferson Starship was dismissed after an undisclosed settlement was reached between Chaquico and the current members of the band.

In July 2018, Jefferson Starship announced plans to release a new album in 2019 that will include their new song &quot;What Are We Waiting For.&quot; Marty Balin died on September 27, 2018, at the age of 76. On February 1, 2019, Rhino Entertainment acquired the catalogues of Jefferson Starship, Starship, Grace Slick and Hot Tuna for albums released between the years of 1972 and 1991. On August 21, 2020, Jefferson Starship released the new studio album &quot;Mother of the Sun&quot;. The first single from the album, &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot;, was co-written by Jude Gold, Cathy Richardson and former vocalist Grace Slick. &quot;Mother of the Sun&quot; features former bassist Pete Sears on three songs, and the album includes both a song written by former singer Marty Balin and a live version of the Jefferson Airplane song &quot;Embryonic Journey&quot;.

In November 2024, Jefferson Starship announced a 50th anniversary tour that will run from Feb. 11 to May 3, 2025.

<text>Bulgarians (, ) are a nation and South Slavic ethnic group native to Bulgaria and its neighbouring region, who share a common Bulgarian ancestry, culture, history and language. They form the majority of the population in Bulgaria, while in North Macedonia, Ukraine, Moldova, Serbia, Albania, Romania, Hungary and Greece they exist as historical communities.

==Etymology==

Bulgarians derive their ethnonym from the Bulgars. Their name is not completely understood and difficult to trace back earlier than the 4th century AD, but it is possibly derived from the Proto-Turkic word &quot;*bulģha&quot; (&quot;to mix&quot;, &quot;shake&quot;, &quot;stir&quot;) and its derivative &quot;*bulgak&quot; (&quot;revolt&quot;, &quot;disorder&quot;). Alternative etymologies include derivation from a compound of Proto-Turkic (Oghuric) &quot;*bel&quot; (&quot;five&quot;) and &quot;*gur&quot; (&quot;arrow&quot; in the sense of &quot;tribe&quot;), a proposed division within the Utigurs or Onogurs (&quot;ten tribes&quot;).

==Citizenship==
According to art. 25(1) of Constitution of Bulgaria, a Bulgarian citizen shall be anyone born to at least one parent holding a Bulgarian citizenship, or born on the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria, should they not be entitled to any other citizenship by virtue of origin. Bulgarian citizenship shall further be acquirable through naturalization. About 85% of Bulgaria&#x27;s population identified themselves as ethnic Bulgarians in 2021 Bulgarian census, the rest being mostly Turks (8%) and Roma (4%).

==Ethnogenesis==
Modern-day Bulgarians descend from peoples of vastly different origins and numbers, and are thus the result of a &quot;melting pot&quot; effect.
The main ethnic elements which blended to produce the modern Bulgarian ethnicity are:
* Thracians – a native ancient Balkan Indo-European people who left a cultural and genetic legacy. Approximately 55% of Bulgarian autosomal genetic legacy is of Paleo-Balkan and Mediterranean origin and can be attributed to Thracian and other indigenous Balkan populations predating Slavs and Bulgars;
* Early Slavs – an Indo-European group of tribes that migrated from Eastern Europe into the Balkans in the 6th–7th century CE and imposed their language and culture on the local Thracian, Roman and Greek communities. Approximately 40% of Bulgarian autosomal make-up comes from a northeastern European population that admixed with the native population in the period between 400 and 1000 CE;
* Bulgars – a semi-nomadic tribal federation, possibly from Central Asia, which settled in the northeast of the Balkans in the 7th century CE, federated with the local Slavic and Slavicized population, organised early-medieval Bulgarian statehood and bequeathed their ethnonym to the modern Bulgarian ethnicity, while eventually assimilating into the Slavic population. Approximately 2.3% of Bulgarian genes originate in Central Asia, corresponding to Asian tribes such as the Bulgars, with admixture peaking in the 9th century CE;

The indigenous Thracians left a cultural and genetic legacy. Other pre-Slavic Indo-European peoples, including Dacians (if distinct from Thracians), Celts, Goths, Romans, ancient Greeks, Sarmatians, Paeonians and Illyrians also settled in what later became the Bulgarian lands. The Thracian language was still spoken in the 6th century, probably becoming extinct afterwards, In a later period the Bulgarians replaced long-established Greek/Latin toponyms with Thracian ones, which might suggest that Thracian had not been completely obliterated then. Some pre-Slavic linguistic and cultural traces might have been preserved among modern Bulgarians (and Macedonians). Scythia Minor and Moesia Inferior appear to have been Romanized, although the region became a focus of barbarian re-settlements (various Goths and Huns) during the 4th and early 5th centuries AD, before a further &quot;Romanization&quot; episode during the early 6th century. According to archeological evidence from the late periods of Roman rule, the Romans did not decrease the number of Thracians significantly in major cities. By the 4th century the major city of Serdica had predominantly Thracian populace based on epigraphic evidence, which shows prevailing Latino-Thracian given names, but thereafter the names were completely replaced by Christian ones.

The early Slavs emerged from their original homeland in the early 6th century, and spread to most of the eastern Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Balkans, thus forming three main branches: the West Slavs in eastern Central Europe, the East Slavs in Eastern Europe, and the South Slavs in Southeastern Europe (Balkans). The latter gradually inflicted total linguistic replacement of Thracian, if the Thracians had not already been Romanized or Hellenized. Most scholars accept that they began large-scale settling of the Balkans in the 580s based on the statement of the 6th century historian Menander speaking of 100,000 Slavs in Thrace and consecutive attacks of Greece in 582. They continued coming to the Balkans in many waves, but also leaving, most notably Justinian II (685–695) settled as many as 30,000 Slavs from Thrace in Asia Minor. The Byzantines grouped the numerous Slavic tribes into two groups: the Sclaveni and Antes. Some Bulgarian scholars suggest that the Antes became one of the ancestors of the modern Bulgarians.

The Bulgars are first mentioned in the 4th century in the vicinity of the North Caucasian steppe. Scholars often suggest that the ultimate origins of the Bulgar is Turkic and can be traced to the Central Asian nomadic confederations, specifically as part of loosely related Oghuric tribes which spanned from the Pontic steppe to central Asia. However, any direct connection between the Bulgars and postulated Asian counterparts rest on little more than speculative and &quot;contorted etymologies&quot;. Some Bulgarian historians question the identification of the Bulgars as a Turkic tribe and suggest an Iranian origin. Other Bulgarian scholars actively oppose the &quot;Iranian hypothesis&quot;. According to Raymond Detrez, the Iranian theory is rooted in the periods of anti-Turkish sentiment in Bulgaria and is ideologically motivated. Since 1989, anti-Turkish rhetoric is now reflected in the theories that challenge the thesis of the Bulgars&#x27; Turkic origin. Alongside the Iranian or Aryan theory, there appeared arguments favoring an autochthonous origin.

In the 670s, some Bulgar tribes, the Danube Bulgars led by Asparuh and the Bulgars, led by Kuber, crossed the Danube river and settled in the Balkans with a single migration wave, the former of which Michael the Syrian described as numbering 10,000. The Bulgars are often not thought to have been numerous, becoming a ruling elite in the areas they controlled. However, according to Steven Runciman a tribe that was able to defeat an Emperor-lead Byzantine army, must have been of considerable dimensions. Asparuh&#x27;s Bulgars made a tribal union with the Severians and the &quot;Seven clans&quot;, who were re-settled to protect the flanks of the Bulgar settlements in Scythia Minor, as the capital Pliska was built on the site of a former Slavic settlement.

During the Early Byzantine Era, the Roman provincials in Scythia Minor and Moesia Secunda were already engaged in economic and social exchange with the &#x27;barbarians&#x27; north of the Danube. This might have facilitated their eventual Slavonization, although the majority of the population appears to have been withdrawn to the hinterland of Constantinople or Asia Minor prior to any permanent Slavic and Bulgar settlement south of the Danube. The major port towns in Pontic Bulgaria remained Byzantine Greek in their outlook. The large scale population transfers and territorial expansions during the 8th and 9th century, additionally increased the number of the Slavs and Byzantine Christians within the state, making the Bulgars quite obviously a minority. The establishment of a new state molded the various Slav, Bulgar and earlier or later populations into the &quot;Bulgarian people&quot; of the First Bulgarian Empire speaking a South Slavic language. In different periods to the ethnogenesis of the local population contributed also different Indo-European and Turkic people, who settled or lived on the Balkans.

=== Bulgarian ethnogenetic conception ===
The Bulgarians are usually regarded as part of the Slavic ethnolinguistic group. However the controversial issue of their ethnogenesis is a popular subject in the works of the nationalist scientists. The fierce debates started in the 19th century and the questionable proportions of the presumed Thracian, Bulgar, and Slavic ancestry, have depended on the geopolitical situation of the country and on ideological and political predilections. These supposed proportions have been changed several times during the 20th century, emphasizing usually the Slavic part of Bulgarian ancestry, related to the traditionally strong Russophilia in the country. However, during the 1970s Thracology was especially supported by the communist authority, as an attempt to underline the indigenous influence into the Bulgarian ethnogenesis. After the fall of Communism, the spiritualized image of the Thracians began to fade. Following the cooling of relations with Russia and the country&#x27;s EU accession, the opinion on significant Bulgar genetic impact was launched among nationalist circles that lately have downplayed the country&#x27;s Slavic ancestry. From a limited group of Turkic equestrian nomads, the Danubian Bulgars were reinterpreted by them as a numerous Aryan people, with a unique culture.

==Genetic origins==
According to a triple analysis – autosomal, mitochondrial and paternal — of available data from large-scale studies on Balto-Slavs and their proximal populations, the whole genome SNP data situates Bulgarians in a cluster with Romanians, Macedonians and Gagauzes, and they are at similar proximity to Serbs and Montenegrins.

Bulgarians, like most Europeans, largely descend from three distinct lineages: Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, descended from populations associated with the Paleolithic Epigravettian culture; Neolithic Early European Farmers who migrated from Anatolia during the Neolithic Revolution 9,000 years ago; and Yamnaya Steppe herders who expanded into Europe from the Pontic steppe in the context of Indo-European migrations 5,000 years ago.

==History==

The First Bulgarian Empire was founded in 681. After the adoption of Orthodox Christianity in 864 it became one of the cultural centres of Slavic Europe. Its leading cultural position was consolidated with the invention of the Cyrillic script in its capital Preslav at the eve of the 10th century. The development of Old Church Slavonic literacy in the country had the effect of preventing the assimilation of the South Slavs into neighbouring cultures and it also stimulated the development of a distinct ethnic identity. A symbiosis was carried out between the numerically weak Bulgars and the numerous Slavic tribes in that broad area from the Danube to the north, to the Aegean Sea to the south, and from the Adriatic Sea to the west, to the Black Sea to the east, who accepted the common ethnonym &quot;Bulgarians&quot;. During the 10th century, the Bulgarians established a form of national identity that was far from modern nationalism but helped them to survive as a distinct entity through the centuries.

In 1018, Bulgaria lost its independence and remained a Byzantine subject until 1185, when the Second Bulgarian Empire was created. Nevertheless, at the end of the 14th century, the Ottomans conquered the whole of Bulgaria. Under the Ottoman system, Christians were considered an inferior class of people. Thus, Bulgarians, like other Christians, were subjected to heavy taxes and a small portion of the Bulgarian populace experienced partial or complete Islamisation. Orthodox Christians were included in a specific ethno-religious community called &quot;Rum Millet&quot;. To the common people, belonging to this Orthodox commonwealth became more important than their ethnic origins. This community became both, basic form of social organization and source of identity for all the ethnic groups inside it. In this way, ethnonyms were rarely used and between the 15th and 19th centuries, most of the local people gradually began to identify themselves simply as &quot;Christians&quot;. However, the public-spirited clergy in some isolated monasteries still kept the distinct Bulgarian identity alive, and this helped it to survive predominantly in rural, remote areas. Despite the process of ethno-religious fusion among the Orthodox Christians, strong nationalist sentiments persisted into the Catholic community in the northwestern part of the country. At that time, a process of partial Hellenization occurred among the intelligentsia and the urban population, as a result of the higher status of the Greek culture and the Greek Orthodox Church among the Balkan Christians. During the second half of the 18th century, the Enlightenment in Western Europe provided influence for the initiation of the National awakening of Bulgaria in 1762.

Some Bulgarians supported the Russian Army when they crossed the Danube in the middle of the 18th century. Russia worked to convince them to settle in areas recently conquered by it, especially in Bessarabia. As a consequence, many Bulgarian refugees settled there, and later they formed two military regiments, as part of the Russian military colonization of the area in 1759–1763.

===Bulgarian national movement===

During the Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806–1812 and 1828–1829 Bulgarian emigrants formed the Bulgarian Countrymen&#x27;s Army and joined the Russian Army, hoping Russia would bring Bulgarian liberation, but its imperial interests were focused then on Greece and Wallachia. The rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire led to a struggle for cultural and religious autonomy of the Bulgarian people. The Bulgarians wanted to have their own schools and liturgy in Bulgarian, and they needed an independent ecclesiastical organisation. Discontent with the supremacy of the Greek Orthodox clergy, the struggle started to flare up in several Bulgarian dioceses in the 1820s.

It was not until the 1850s when the Bulgarians initiated a purposeful struggle against the Patriarchate of Constantinople. The struggle between the Bulgarians and the Greek Phanariotes intensified throughout the 1860s. In 1861 the Vatican and the Ottoman government recognized a separate Bulgarian Uniat Church. As the Greek clerics were ousted from most Bulgarian bishoprics at the end of the decade, significant areas had been seceded from the Patriarchate&#x27;s control. This movement restored the distinct Bulgarian national consciousness among the common people and led to the recognition of the Bulgarian millet in 1870 by the Ottomans. As result, two armed struggle movements started to develop as late as the beginning of the 1870s: the Internal Revolutionary Organisation and the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee. Their armed struggle reached its peak with the April Uprising which broke out in 1876. It resulted in the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), and led to the foundation of the third Bulgarian state after the Treaty of San Stefano. The issue of Bulgarian nationalism gained greater significance, following the Congress of Berlin which took back the Macedonia and Adrianople regions, returning them under the control of the Ottoman Empire. Also an autonomous Ottoman province, called Eastern Rumelia was created in Northern Thrace. As a consequence, the Bulgarian national movement proclaimed as its aim the inclusion of most of Macedonia, Thrace and Moesia under Greater Bulgaria.

Eastern Rumelia was annexed to Bulgaria in 1885 through bloodless revolution. During the early 1890s, two pro-Bulgarian revolutionary organizations were founded: the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization and the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee. In 1903 they participated in the unsuccessful Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising against the Ottomans in Macedonia and the Adrianople Vilayet. Macedonian Slavs were identified then predominantly as Bulgarians, and significant Bulgarophile sentiments endured up among them until the end of the Second World War.

In the early 20th century the control over Macedonia became a key point of contention between Bulgaria, Greece, and Serbia, who fought the First Balkan War of (1912–1913) and the Second Balkan War of (1913). The area was further fought over during the World War I (1915–1918) and the World War II (1941–1944).

==Demographics==
Most Bulgarians live in Bulgaria, where they number around 6 million, constituting 85% of the population. Bulgarian minorities exist in Serbia, Romania (Banat Bulgarians), Hungary, Albania, as well as in Ukraine and Moldova (see Bessarabian Bulgarians). Many Bulgarians also live in the diaspora, which is formed by representatives and descendants of the old (before 1989) and new (after 1989) emigration. The old emigration was made up of some 2,470,000 economic and several tens of thousands of political emigrants, and was directed for the most part to the U.S., Canada, Argentina, Brazil and Germany. The new emigration is estimated at some 970,000 people and can be divided into two major subcategories: permanent emigration at the beginning of the 1990s, directed mostly to the U.S., Canada, Austria, and Germany and labour emigration at the end of the 1990s, directed for the most part to Greece, Italy, the UK and Spain. Migrations to the West have been quite steady even in the late 1990s and early 21st century, as people continue moving to countries like the US, Canada and Australia. Most Bulgarians living in Canada can be found in Toronto, Ontario, and the provinces with the most Bulgarians in Canada are Ontario and Quebec. According to the 2001 census there were 1,124,240 Bulgarian citizens in the city of Sofia, 302,858 in Plovdiv, 300,000 in Varna and about 200,000 in Burgas. The total number of Bulgarians stood at over 9 million.

==Associated ethnic groups==
Bulgarians are considered most closely related to the Macedonians. The Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia and the Torlak speakers in Serbia are also closely related to Bulgarians. 

==Culture==

===Language===

Bulgarians speak a South Slavic language which is mutually intelligible with Macedonian and to a lesser degree with Serbo-Croatian, especially the eastern dialects. The lexical similarities between Bulgarian and Macedonian are 86%, between Bulgarian and other Slavic languages between 71% and 80%, but with the Baltic languages they are 40–46%, while with English are about 20%. Less than a dozen Bulgarian words are derived from Turkic Bulgar.

Bulgarian demonstrates some linguistic developments that set it apart from other Slavic languages shared with Romanian, Albanian and Greek (see Balkan language area). Bulgarian was influenced lexically by medieval and modern Greek, and Turkish. Medieval Bulgarian influenced the other South Slavic languages and Romanian. With Bulgarian and Russian there was a mutual influence in both directions. Both languages were official or a lingua franca of each other during the Middle Ages and the Cold War. Recently, Bulgarian has borrowed many words from German, French and English.

The Bulgarian language is spoken by the majority of the Bulgarian diaspora, but less so by the descendants of earlier emigrants to the U.S., Canada, Argentina and Brazil.

Bulgarian linguists consider the officialized Macedonian language (since 1944) to be a local codified variation of Bulgarian, just as most ethnographers and linguists until the early 20th century considered the local Slavic speech in the Macedonian region as Bulgarian dialects. The president of Bulgaria, Zhelyu Zhelev, declined to recognize Macedonian as a separate language when North Macedonia became a new independent state. The Bulgarian language is written in the Cyrillic script.

====Cyrillic alphabet====

In the first half of the 10th century, the Cyrillic script was devised in the Preslav Literary School, Bulgaria, based on the Glagolitic, the Greek and Latin alphabets. Modern versions of the alphabet are now used to write five more Slavic languages such as Belarusian, Macedonian, Russian, Serbian and Ukrainian as well as Mongolian and some other 60 languages spoken in the former Soviet Union. Medieval Bulgaria was the most important cultural centre of the Slavic peoples at the end of the 9th and throughout the 10th century. The two literary schools of Preslav and Ohrid developed a rich literary and cultural activity with authors of the rank of Constantine of Preslav, John Exarch, Chernorizets Hrabar, Clement and Naum of Ohrid. Bulgaria exerted similar influence on its neighbouring countries in the mid- to late 14th century, at the time of the Tarnovo Literary School, with the work of Patriarch Evtimiy, Gregory Tsamblak, Constantine of Kostenets (Konstantin Kostenechki). Bulgarian cultural influence was especially strong in Wallachia and Moldova where the Cyrillic script was used until 1860, while Church Slavonic was the official language of the princely chancellery and of the church until the end of the 17th century.

====Name system====
There are several different layers of Bulgarian names. The vast majority of them have either Christian (names like Lazar, Ivan, Anna, Maria, Ekaterina) or Slavic origin (Vladimir, Svetoslav, Velislava). After the Liberation in 1878, the names of historical Bulgar rulers like Asparuh, Krum, Kubrat and Tervel were resurrected. The Bulgar name Boris has spread from Bulgaria to a number of countries in the world.

Most Bulgarian male surnames have an &quot;-ov&quot; surname suffix (Cyrillic: ), a tradition used mostly by Eastern Slavic nations such as Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. This is sometimes transcribed as &quot;-off&quot; or &quot;-of&quot; (John Atanasov—John Atanasoff), but more often as &quot;-ov&quot; (e.g. Boyko Borisov). The &quot;-ov&quot; suffix is the Slavic gender-agreeing suffix, thus &quot;Ivanov&quot; () literally means &quot;Ivan&#x27;s&quot;. Bulgarian middle names are patronymic and use the gender-agreeing suffix as well, thus the middle name of Nikola&#x27;s son becomes &quot;Nikolov&quot;, and the middle name of Ivan&#x27;s son becomes &quot;Ivanov&quot;. Since names in Bulgarian are gender-based, Bulgarian women have the &quot;-ova&quot; surname suffix (Cyrillic: ), for example, &quot;Maria Ivanova&quot;. The plural form of Bulgarian names ends in &quot;-ovi&quot; (Cyrillic: ), for example the &quot;Ivanovi&quot; family ().

Other common Bulgarian male surnames have the &quot;-ev&quot; surname suffix (Cyrillic: ), for example &quot;Stoev&quot;, &quot;Ganchev&quot;, &quot;Peev&quot;, and so on. The female surname in this case would have the &quot;-eva&quot; surname suffix (Cyrillic: ), for example: &quot;Galina Stoeva&quot;. The last name of the entire family then would have the plural form of &quot;-evi&quot; (Cyrillic: ), for example: the &quot;Stoevi&quot; family ().

Another typical Bulgarian surname suffix, though less common, is &quot;-ski&quot;. This surname ending also gets an &quot;–a&quot; when the bearer of the name is female (&quot;Smirnenski&quot; becomes &quot;Smirnenska&quot;). The plural form of the surname suffix &quot;-ski&quot; is still &quot;-ski&quot;, e.g. the &quot;Smirnenski&quot; family ().

The ending &quot;–in&quot; (female &quot;-ina&quot;) also appears rarely. It used to be given to the child of an unmarried woman (for example the son of &quot;Kuna&quot; will get the surname &quot;Kunin&quot; and the son of &quot;Gana&quot; – &quot;Ganin&quot;). The surname suffix &quot;-ich&quot; can be found only occasionally, primarily among the Roman Catholic Bulgarians. The surname ending &quot;–ich&quot; does not get an additional &quot;–a&quot; if the bearer of the name is female.

===Religion===

Most Bulgarians are at least nominally members of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church founded in 870 AD (autocephalous since 927 AD). The Bulgarian Orthodox Church is the independent national church of Bulgaria like the other national branches of the Eastern Orthodox communion and is considered a dominating element of Bulgarian national consciousness. The church was abolished once, during the period of Ottoman rule (1396—1878), in 1873 it was revived as Bulgarian Exarchate and soon after raised again to Bulgarian Patriarchate. In 2021, the Orthodox Church at least nominally had a total of 4,219,270 members in Bulgaria (71.5% of the population), down from 6,552,000 (83%) at the 2001 census. 3,980,131 of these pointed out the Bulgarian ethnic group (79% of the total Bulgarian ethnic group). The Orthodox Bulgarian minorities in Romania, Serbia, Greece, Albania, Ukraine and Moldova nowadays hold allegiance to the respective national Orthodox churches.

Despite the position of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church as a unifying symbol for all Bulgarians, small groups of Bulgarians have converted to other faiths through the course of time. During Ottoman rule, a substantial number of Bulgarians converted to Islam, forming the community of the Pomaks or Muslim Bulgarians. In the 16th and the 17th centuries Roman Catholic missionaries converted a small number of Bulgarian Paulicians in the districts of Plovdiv and Svishtov to Roman Catholicism. Nowadays there are some 40,000 Roman Catholic Bulgarians in Bulgaria, additional 10,000 in the Banat in Romania and up to 100,000 people of Bulgarian ancestry in South America. The Roman Catholic Bulgarians of the Banat are also descendants of Paulicians who fled there at the end of the 17th century after an unsuccessful uprising against the Ottomans. Protestantism was introduced in Bulgaria by missionaries from the United States in 1857. Missionary work continued throughout the second half of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. Nowadays there are some 25,000 Protestant Bulgarians in Bulgaria.

===Art and science===
Boris Christoff, Nicolai Ghiaurov, Raina Kabaivanska and Ghena Dimitrova made a precious contribution to opera singing with Ghiaurov and Christoff being two of the greatest bassos in the post-war period. Similarly, Anna-Maria Ravnopolska-Dean is one of the best-known harpists today.
Bulgarians have made valuable contributions to world culture in modern times as well. Julia Kristeva and Tzvetan Todorov were among the most influential European philosophers in the second half of the 20th century. The artist Christo is among the most famous representatives of environmental art, with projects such as the Wrapped Reichstag.

Bulgarians in the diaspora have also been active. American scientists and inventors of Bulgarian descent include John Atanasoff, Peter Petroff, and Assen Jordanoff. Bulgarian-American Stephane Groueff wrote the celebrated book &quot;Manhattan Project&quot;, about the making of the first atomic bomb and also penned &quot;Crown of Thorns&quot;, a biography of Tsar Boris III of Bulgaria.

===Cuisine===

Famous for its rich salads required at every meal, Bulgarian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of dairy products and the variety of local wines and alcoholic beverages such as rakia, mastika and menta. Bulgarian cuisine features also a variety of hot and cold soups, an example of a cold soup being tarator. There are many different Bulgarian pastries as well such as banitsa.

Most Bulgarian dishes are oven baked, steamed, or in the form of stew. Deep-frying is not very typical, but grilling—especially different kinds of meats—is very common. Pork meat is the most common meat in the Bulgarian cuisine. Oriental dishes do exist in Bulgarian cuisine with most common being moussaka, gyuvetch, and baklava. A very popular ingredient in Bulgarian cuisine is the Bulgarian white brine cheese called &quot;sirene&quot; (сирене). It is the main ingredient in many salads, as well as in a variety of pastries. Fish and chicken are widely eaten and while beef is less common as most cattle are bred for milk production rather than meat, veal is a natural byproduct of this process and it is found in many popular recipes. Bulgaria is a net exporter of lamb and its own consumption of the meat is prevalent during its production time in spring. The bread and salt tradition, which is widespread among Balto-Slavs, is the usual welcome given to strangers and politicians.

===Folk beliefs and customs===

Bulgarians may celebrate Saint Theodore&#x27;s Day with horse racings. At Christmas Eve a Pogača with fortunes is cooked, which are afterwards put under the pillow. At Easter the first egg is painted red and is kept for a whole year. On the Baptism of Jesus a competition to catch the cross in the river is held and is believed the sky is &quot;opened&quot; and any wish will be fulfilled.

Bulgarians as well as Albanians nod the head up and down to indicates &quot;no&quot; and shake to indicate &quot;yes&quot;. They may wear the martenitsa (мартеница)—an adornment made of white and red yarn and worn on the wrist or pinned on the clothes—from 1 March until the end of the month. Alternatively, one can take off the martenitsa earlier if one sees a stork (considered a harbinger of spring). One can then tie the martenitsa to the blossoming branch of a tree. Family-members and friends in Bulgaria customarily exchange martenitsas, which they regard as symbols of health and longevity. When a stork is seen, the martenitsa should be left on a tree. The white thread represents peace and tranquility, while the red one stands for the cycles of life. Bulgarians may also refer to the holiday of 1 March as Baba Marta (Баба Марта), meaning &quot;Grandmother March&quot;. It preserves an ancient pagan tradition, possibly celebrating the old Roman new Year, beginning on 1 March, identical with Romanian Mărțișor. Pagan customs found their way to the Christian holidays. The ancient ritual of kukeri (кукери), similar to Slovenian Kurentovanje, Busójárás and Halloween, is performed by costumed men in different times of the year and after Easter. This seeks to scare away evil spirits and bring good harvest and health to the community. Goat is symbolized, that was left from the Thracian cult of Dionysian Mysteries. The ritual consists of dancing, jumping, shouting and collect gifts from the houses in an attempt to banish all evil from the village. The adornments on the costumes vary from one region to another. The Thracian Heros remains in the image of Saint George, at whose feast the agriculture is celebrated, a lamb is traditionally eaten, accomplished with ritual bathing. Saint Tryphon&#x27;s fertility and wine is attributed a Thracian origin, considered to preserve the cult to Sabazius as the Kukeri. This is followed in February by Pokladi, a tradition of setting massively large fire and jump over as at the Kupala Night and a competition between couples to eat an egg on a thread is held. Another characteristic custom called nestinarstvo (нестинарство), or &quot;firedancing&quot;, distinguishes the Strandzha region, as well as Dog spinning. The authentic nestinarstvo with states of trance is only preserved in the village Balgari. This ancient custom involves dancing into fire or over live embers. Women dance into the fire with their bare feet without suffering any injury or pain.
Slavic pagan customs are preserved in Bulgarian Christian holidays. The Miladinov brothers and foreign authors noticed that even pagan prayers are preserved quoting plenty of Slavic pagan rite songs and tales remained in Bulgarians, including Macedonians and Pomaks, mainly dedicated to the divine nymphs samovili and peperuna for the feasts surva, Saint George&#x27;s Day, Koleda, etc. with evidence of toponymy throughout the regional groups linking directly to the deities Svarog, Perun, Hors and Veles, while the regional group Hartsoi derive their name from god Hors. Songs dedicated to the Thracian divinity Orpheus were found in Pomaks, who is said to marry the samovili. The old Bulgarian name of the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple was &quot;Gromnitsa&quot; and &quot;Perunov den&quot; dedicated to the supreme Slavic thunder god Perun. In the mix of Christian and pagan patrons of thunder, at Saint Elijah&#x27;s feast day Ognyena Maria is worshiped, the Slavic goddesses assisting Perun that took a substitutional dual position of the Christian Mother of God. The custom for rain begging Peperuna is derived from the wife of Perun and the god of the rain Dodola, this was described by a 1792 Bulgarian book as a continued worship of Perun at times of absence of rain with a ritual performed by a boy or a girl dressed like Perun. Similar rain begging is called German. In case of continuous lack of rain, a custom of driving out the zmey from the area is performed. In the dualistic Slavic belief the zmey may be both good tutelary spirit and evil, in which case is considered not local and good, but evil and trying to inflict harm and drought. Saint Jeremiah&#x27;s feast is of the snakes and the reptiles, there is a tradition of jumping over fire. At the Rusalka week the girls don&#x27;t go outside to prevent themselves from diseases and harm that the dead forces Rusalii can cause. This remained the holiday of the samovili. The men performing the custom are also called Rusalii, they don&#x27;t let anybody pass through between them, don&#x27;t talk with each other except for the evening, avoid water, if someone lacks behind a member swoops the sword over the lacker&#x27;s head to prevent him from evil spirits. If the group encounter on their way a well, dry tree, old cemeteries, crossroads, they go round them three times. Before leaving rusalii say goodbye to their relatives as if they went to war, which is not surprising because some of them are killed. When two rusalii groups met there was a fight to the death in which the dead were buried in special &quot;rusaliyski cemetery.&quot; Each year there are holidays in honour of wolves and mouses. A relief for the scared believers is celebrated at the Beheading of St. John the Baptist, when according to Bulgarian belief all the mythical figures go back to their caves in a mythical village in the middle of nowhere Zmeykovo of the zmey king, along with the rusalki, samodivi, and return at Annunciation. According to other beliefs the danger peaks at the so-called few days around the New Year Eve &quot;Dirty Days&quot;, this time starts at Koleda, which merged with Christmas, when groups of kids koledari visit houses, singing carols and receiving a gift at parting. It is believed that no man can go in Zmeyovo and only the magpie knows the location of this place. At many of the holidays a sexual taboo is said to be practiced to prevent conceiving a vampire or werewolf and not to work, not to go to Sedenki or go out. Live-fire is set in case of epidemics. Babinden for example is rooted in the mother-goddess. On the day of St. Vlas, the tradition of a &quot;wooly&quot; god Veles established itself, a god who is considered to be a protector of shepherds, and bread is given to the livestock on that day. The ancient Slavic custom to marry died people occurred in Bulgarian society. Survakane is performed each new year with a decorated stick by children, who hit adults on the back for health at the New Year Eve, usually in exchange of money. In the Chech region there is a custom forbidding &quot;touching the land&quot;, i.e. construction and agriculture, at the equinox on 25 March and the same custom is found in Belarusian Volhynia and Polesia.

Bulgarian mythology and fairy tales are mainly about forest figures, such as the dragon zmey, the nymphs samovili (samodivi), the witch veshtitsa. They are usually harmful and devastating, but can also help the people. The samovili are said to live in beeches and sycamores the, which are therefore considered holy and not permitted burning. Samovili, although believed to be masters of everything between the sky and the earth, &quot;run away&quot; from fraxinus, garlic, dew and walnut. Walnut remained in Christianity to be used in prayers to &quot;see&quot; the dead in Spirits Day. Dictamnus is believed to be their favourite herb, which is intoxicating. The samovili are spirits in Bulgarian beliefs are the diseases themselves and punish people, kidnap shepherds, make blind the people or drown them and are in white colored dress, they are in odd numbers, which suggest they are ones of the &quot;dead&quot;. Epic heroes as Prince Marko are believed to be descended from the samodivi. The elm is believed to scare the evil forces. Sacral trees in Bulgarian beliefs are beeches and oaks. Hawthorn is believed to expel all evil forces and is applied to cure suspected vampires. The tradition forbids killing of sacred animals – deer, while it is hold a belief the samodivi runaway from horse. The alleged as &quot;unclean&quot; animals resembling the devil such as the goat are, however, exempted from being eaten as the holy ones. The zmey is transhuman and can turn &quot;into&quot; animals, plants and items, he is also &quot;responsible&quot; for diseases, madness and missing women. The female version of the Slavic zmey is Lamia and Ala is another version. The girls who practiced Lazaruvane and other rituals &quot;could not&quot; be kidnapped by the zmey. The main enemy of the Sun is the zmey, which tries to eat the Sun, which scene is preserved in church art. The sun is painted one eyed as recorded by beliefs Perun stabbed one of the sun&#x27;s eyes to save the world from overheating. The born on Saturday are thought as having supernatural powers, those born at the wolves&#x27; holidays and a number of people are alleged as varkolaks and vampires. The most spread Bulgarian view of the vampire was that of a rolling bulbous balloon of blood derived from the Slavic term &quot;pir&quot; &quot;drink&quot;. Rusalka is believed to be a variety of the samodivi and Nav, but the latter are considered little fairies. The Thursdays remained feasts of Perun in Bulgarian beliefs. The wind and the hot steam of the bread is believed to be the souls of the dead. From Easter to Feast of the Ascension it is believed that the death are in the flowers and the animals. Mora in Bulgarian beliefs is a black hairy evil spirit with four firing eyes associated with nightmares when causing someone to scream, similarly to Kikimora. Polunoshtnitsa and Poludnica are believed to be evil spirits causing death, while to Lesnik, Domovnik and Vodnik a dualistic nature is attributed. Thanks to the Vlshebnik, a man of the community, a magician and a priest, communication with the &quot;other&quot; world was held. Torbalan is the Sack Man used to scare children, along with Baba Yaga, who is a witch in her Bulgarian version.

Kuma Lisa and Hitar Petar are the tricky fox and villager from the fairy tales, the tricked antagonist is often Nasreddin Hoca, whereas Bay Ganyo is a ridiculed Bulgarian villager. Ivancho and Mariika are the protagonists of the jokes.

Despite eastern Ottoman influence is obvious in areas such as cuisine and music, Bulgarian folk beliefs and mythology seem to lack analogies with Turkic mythology, paganism and any non-European folk beliefs, sо in pre-Christian times the ancient Bulgars were much inferior to the Slavs in the ethnogenesis and culture that resulted in modern Bulgarians. The Slavic language was officialized at the same time with Christianity, so Slavic paganism has never been a state religion of Bulgaria or more influential than Tengriism. Most of Bulgarian land lack any pagan archeology left from the Bulgars, despite early Christianization and that during most of the pagan period medieval Bulgarian borders spread significantly only in today&#x27;s northern Bulgaria. Although legacy indicating ancient Bulgar culture is at most virtually absent in modern Bulgarian culture, some authors claim there is a similarity between the dress and customs of the Chuvashes, who descend from the Volga Bulgars, and the Bulgarian ethnographic group &quot;Kapantsi&quot; from Targovishte Province and Razgrad Province, among whom the claim that they are direct descendants of Asparuh&#x27;s Bulgars is popular, but Slavic elements are found among them.

===Folk dress and music===

Bulgarian folk costumes feature long white robes, usually with red embrdoiery and ornaments derived from the Slavic Rachenik. 
The costume is considered to be mainly derived from the dress of the ancient Slavs, the female dress with the overgarments joined at the shoulders that evolved from Sarafan and all the types of sukman, saya and aprons fasten at the waist are said to be directly descended from the ancient Slavs only with negligible mutation. The women&#x27;s head-dress, which turned to be a must for the Bulgarian costume is a decoration with flowers optionally on a headband, that distinguishes all the Balto-Slavic peoples and is not found in western cultures. The male dress is of likewise origin, usually Riza &quot;robe&quot;, poyas &quot;belt&quot;, poturi &quot;full-bottomed breeches&quot; typical for the Slavs and often a tsarvul and kalpak for shoes and jacket. Among the most similar relatives of the latter for example is Ukrainian hutsul, but the kalpak is attributed to Ottoman influence. The male skirt fustanella appears on the dress only of the Macedonian Bulgarians and is of indigenous Balkan origin or influence. In some dress of Thrace the symbol of the snake as in medieval tombs is found and is considered a Thracian cultural legacy and belief.

Folk songs are most often about the nymphs from Bulgarian and West Slavic mythology (samovili) and the epic heroes (yunaks). Instruments Gadulka, Gusla, Duduk, gaida Dvoyanka are analogous to other Slavic gudok, dudka and Dvodentsivka. Kaval is common in the Balkans and Turkey and is akin to Arab Kawala, as well as Tapan, Goblet Drum, Zurna. The most spread dance is a circle dance called horo and khorovod. Songs are generally loud. Recent eastern influences from the genre music chalga and turbo-folk even brought a prestige for the masculine voices of females.

Valya Balkanska is a folk singer thanks to whom the Bulgarian speech in her song &quot;Izlel ye Delyo Haydutin&quot; will be played in the Outer space for at least 60,000 years more as part of the Voyager Golden Record selection of music included in the two Voyager spacecraft launched in 1977.

===Sport===

As for most European peoples, football became by far the most popular sport for the Bulgarians. Hristo Stoichkov was one of the best football (soccer) players in the second half of the 20th century, having played with the national team and FC Barcelona. He received a number of awards and was the joint top scorer at the 1994 World Cup. Dimitar Berbatov, formerly in Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Bayer Leverkusen and others, the national team and two domestic clubs, is still the most popular Bulgarian football player of the 21st century.

In the beginning of the 20th century Bulgaria was famous for two of the best wrestlers in the world – Dan Kolov and Nikola Petroff. Stefka Kostadinova is the best female high jumper, still holding the world record from 1987, one of the oldest unbroken world records for all kind of athletics. Ivet Lalova along with Irina Privalova is currently the fastest white woman at 100 metres. Kaloyan Mahlyanov has been the first European sumo wrestler to win the Emperor&#x27;s Cup in Japan. Veselin Topalov won the 2005 World Chess Championship. He was ranked No. 1 in the world from April 2006 to January 2007, and had the second highest Elo rating of all time (2813). He regained the world No. 1 ranking again in October 2008.

===Symbols===
The national symbols of the Bulgarians are the Flag, the Coat of Arms, the National anthem and the National Guard, as well other unofficial symbols such as the Samara flag.

The national flag of Bulgaria is a rectangle with three colours: white, green, and red, positioned horizontally top to bottom. The colour fields are of same form and equal size. It is generally known that the white represents – the purity, the green – the forest and nature and the red – the blood of the people, referencing the strong bond of the nation through all the wars and revolutions that have shaken the country in the past.
The Coat of arms of Bulgaria is a state symbol of the sovereignty and independence of the Bulgarian people and state. It represents a crowned rampant golden lion on a dark red background with the shape of a shield. Above the shield there is a crown modeled after the crowns of the emperors of the Second Bulgarian Empire, with five crosses and an additional cross on top. Two crowned rampant golden lions hold the shield from both sides, facing it. They stand upon two crossed oak branches with acorns, which symbolize the power and the longevity of the Bulgarian state. Under the shield, there is a white band lined with the three national colours. The band is placed across the ends of the branches and the phrase &quot;Unity Makes Strength&quot; is inscribed on it.

Both the Bulgarian flag and the Coat of Arms are also used as symbols of various Bulgarian organisations, political parties and institutions.

The horse of the Madara Rider is preserved on the back of the Bulgarian stotinka.

<doc id="151884" wikidata="Q7232508" url="?curid=151884" title="Portsmouth and Arundel Canal">
<text>The Portsmouth and Arundel Canal was a canal in the south of England that ran between Portsmouth and Ford in the Arundel district, it was built in 1823 but was never a financial success and was abandoned in 1855; the company was wound up in 1888. The canal was part of a larger scheme for the construction of a secure inland canal route from London to Portsmouth, which allowed craft to move between the two without having to venture into the English Channel and possibly encounter enemy ships or natural disaster. It was built by the Portsmouth &amp; Arundel Navigation company.
The canal was made up of three sections: a pair of ship canals, one on Portsea Island and one to Chichester, and a barge canal that ran from Ford on the River Arun to Hunston where it joined the Chichester section of the canal

==Ford to Hunston Section==

This section of the canal connected the river Arun at Ford to the junction with the Chichester arm of the canal. It had two locks at Ford to allow the canal to drop 12 feet down to the river.

==Hunston to Birdham Section==
This section (technically the Ship Canal) links Chichester Harbour at Birdham with the junction at Hunston. It contains two locks Casher&#x27;s or Manhood End Lock and Saltern&#x27;s sea lock. The canal was built to ship canal standards and was built 8 feet deep and 46 feet 8 inches wide.

==Chichester Ship Canal==

The Chichester ship (or Barge) canal ran from the sea lock at Birdham to the junction of the Portsmouth and Arundel Canal at Hunston and then North to a basin in the south of the city of Chichester.

==The Portsea Canal section==

This section of the canal ran from Langstone Harbour, across the east and central areas of Portsea Island through Milton, Fratton and Landport ending at a canal basin on what is now Arundel Street, which was named after the canal. This section of the canal was built to what were then small ship canal standards and could take ships of up to 150 tons. There were 2 locks at Milton (a sea lock and an upper lock)

==The tidal channels==
The Portsea section was connected to the rest via a 13-mile channel dredged through Chichester Harbour, past the southern side of Thorney Island (original plan was to go around the northern side) and to the north of Hayling Island, and finally across Langstone Harbour. To ease passage between the Chichester and the Portsea sections a steam vessel, &quot;the Egremont&quot;, was made to tow 40-ton barges in trains of six. For a while the company also made Portsbridge Creek navigable.

==History==

===Planning and construction===

The plan for the canal was completed in 1815 and the act of Parliament, the (57 Geo. 3. c. lxiii), passed in 1817. At this stage costs were estimated at £119,000 rising to £125,452 in 1818. Construction started in 1818 and the canal was finished in 1823, at a cost of £170,000. The resident engineer was James Hollinsworth who was paid £500 per annum.

To supply the canal with water a pumping engine was installed at Ford to pump water from the Arun. Since the Arun is tidal at Ford the act of Parliament only allowed water to be taken from the river between two hours after high water and one hour after low. This was to prevent salt water from entering the canal. In order to allow the passage of masted ships iron swing bridges were fitted to the Chichester and Portsea sections rather than the more typical hump back canal bridge.

===Operation===
From the beginning the canal was plagued with various problems, and in 1827 the Portsea section of the canal had to be drained due to complaints about salt water contamination in some of Portsmouth&#x27;s wells. In 1845 parts of this section were sold to the London and Brighton railway company with another section being sold to the company in 1851.

In 1830 tolls were reduced and for a while traffic picked up with cargoes including 20 tons of marble from the Mediterranean for the king. In the same year the company made Ports Creek navigable to allow the passage of barges around the north of Portsea Island to Portsmouth Harbour. The canal was also used to transport gold and silver for the Bank of England.
The canal was unable to compete with the sea routes and by 1832 the canal company was being forced to do the carrying itself. By 1847 the canal, with the exception of the Chichester arm, had ceased to be navigable.

===Later activities===
On the remaining Portsea Section the issue of maintaining the various bridges became an issue of concern until the company managed to buy itself out of the requirement to maintain them.

The Chichester arm was transferred to the Corporation of Chichester by Chichester Canal Transfer Act 1892 (55 &amp; 56 Vict. c. cxxxviii), the same year in which the canal company was wound up (the winding up order having been applied for in 1888).

===Post canal company===
Some visible remains of the Portsea Section still exist in 2011. A section of the Portsmouth-London mainline railway follows the course of the canal between Portsmouth &amp; Southsea and Fratton stations. Beyond them Goldsmith Avenue was constructed along the line of the canal. Off Goldsmith Avenue, the east-west route of the canal can still be traced by more recent residential development along Old Canal and Towpath Mead roads. The tow-path follows the course of the foot-path just north of the caravan site and allotments on the south side of Locksway Road at its easternmost end, with the canal to the north side of this. There is evidence that the canal was filled in here with coke from the local gas works. The remains of the lock into Langstone Harbour are also still in evidence. The lock has been a conservation area since 1977 and is a grade II listed structure. In 1979 Portsmouth City Council agreed to spend £35,000 over the next decade to refurbish the lock.

<text>The Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal (sometimes known as the Hereford and Gloucester Canal) is a canal in the west of England, which ran from Hereford to Gloucester, where it linked to the River Severn. It was opened in two phases in 1798 and 1845, and closed in 1881, when the southern section was used for the course of the Ledbury and Gloucester Railway. It is the subject of an active restoration scheme.

==History==
The first plans for a canal between Hereford and Gloucester were made by Robert Whitworth, one of James Brindley&#x27;s pupils, in 1777. The route was part of a grander plan to Stourport-on-Severn and Leominster as well. Twelve years later, Richard Hall submitted plans for a canal via Ledbury. 
In March 1790, the promoters decided to submit the plans to Parliament. Josiah Clowes, an engineer who had previous experience of working on the Chester Canal and who had worked with Whitworth on the Thames and Severn Canal, was to be the engineer. It appears that he re-surveyed the route, and recommended a change, so that it passed through Ledbury. A branch would be built to Newent where there were minor coalfields, and the canal would be suitable for boats , capable of carrying 35 tons. The estimated cost was £70,000, and it was expected to carry 33,203 tons per year, generating £9,582 in revenue. Some of the promoters began to think that improving the River Wye might be a better option, but the announcement of new seams of coal at Newent resulted in a decision to obtain an act of Parliament, the (31 Geo. 3. c. 89), which was granted in April 1791.
Hugh Henshall, who was the brother-in-law of James Brindley, was asked to re-survey the route in 1792, and recommended a diversion to Newent. This route required a tunnel at Oxenhall, and another act of Parliament was obtained, the (33 Geo. 3. c. 119), to sanction the new route. Josiah Clowes died in 1795, and was succeeded as engineer by Robert Whitworth. By late 1795, the initial section was open to Newent, but the tunnel was causing major problems.

In order to build the tunnel, twenty shafts were sunk along its route, so that there could be multiple working faces. However, there were considerable difficulties caused by the volume of water entering the shafts. Horse-powered pumps proved inadequate, and eventually steam-powered pumps were employed, but this added to the cost, and the tunnel was a large factor in the failure to complete the canal.

The canal was opened to within one mile of Ledbury in 1798, but stopped there as the cost had far exceeded the estimates. The Coal Branch to the mines at Newent was never a success, as the coal was of very poor quality, and the branch fell into disuse very quickly. The price of coal in the region dropped from 24 shillings (£1.20) per ton to 13/6 (68p) but the coal was a good quality product which travelled up the canal from the River Severn. Ledbury remained the terminus for another forty years, although a short extension to enable coal to be delivered to the Ledbury gas works was completed in 1832.

===Second phase===

In 1827, Stephen Ballard became the new clerk of the company, and produced a report on how to complete the canal in 1829. In 1838, he proposed a new route for the final section, but the engineer James Walker advised against it, and so in May 1839, a new act of Parliament, the (2 &amp; 3 Vict. c. xxvi), was obtained, allowing the company to raise the money to complete the canal. Work started on 17 November. A feeder from the River Frome to the summit level was completed in August 1842, and the canal opened in stages as it was completed, with extensions to Canon Frome wharf in January 1843, Whithington wharf in February 1844, and finally to Hereford basin on 22 May 1845.

As with the first phase, it was the tunnel construction which caused the most problems, and Ashperton tunnel, although only long, was affected by water flooding the work faces and by unstable rock, resulting in the need to construct a brick and stone lining. Again, costs escalated well beyond the original estimates.

===Operation===
The canal had cost far more to build than was originally planned. The whole canal had been estimated at £69,997 by Josiah Clowes in 1790, but the section to Ledbury had cost in excess of £104,000. Stephen Ballard had estimated the cost of the second phase at £53,000, but the final cost had been £141,436. With little increase in trade from the longer canal, the company tried to sell it to a railway company almost immediately, but were unsuccessful, and so tried to boost trade.

Traffic started to increase, to the extent that a timetable for the transit of the Oxenhall tunnel had to be introduced in 1849. This was not always successful, as the &quot;Hereford Times&quot; carried articles in May 1851 about an incident in which boats travelling in opposite directions had met in the middle, and neither would give way. There was deadlock for a period of 58 hours.

===Decline and closure===
In 1858, the canal carried 47,560 tons of goods, and generated an income of £7,061 in 1860, but some of this was derived from the carriage of materials to build railways in the area. On 17 January 1862, less than 17 years after the opening to Hereford, the canal was leased to the Great Western and West Midland Railway, with a view to converting it to a railway. This did not take place immediately, but on 30 June 1881, half of the canal was closed, and sections of it were used for the course of the Ledbury and Gloucester Railway. The Hereford to Ledbury section remained open, but gradually became disused. The canal company continued to receive rent from the Great Western Railway, which it distributed to its shareholders as dividends, and was not formally wound up until the railways were nationalised in 1948.

==Route==

The canal ran for from Hereford basin through Ledbury, Dymock and Newent to Over, on the West Channel of the River Severn west of Gloucester, with a short branch to the coal fields at Gorsley. The first from Hereford to Withington, which includes the Aylestone tunnel, was level, after which the canal rose by through three locks over the three miles to Monkhide. This section includes the skew bridge at Monkhide, built by Ballard at an angle of only 27° to the canal.
 The bridge was constructed of red brick with some stone dressing, and the parapets are capped with large black engineering bricks which indicate that they were made by B W Blades of West Bromwich. The bridge is a grade II listed structure. There is then another level section of more than twelve miles to the outskirts of Ledbury, which includes the Ashperton tunnel. Water is fed into this section from the River Frome. The final to Over falls by , and includes the Oxenhall tunnel, which was not destroyed by the construction of the railway, as the railway company took the sensible decision to avoid the likely problems of enlarging it, and built a diversion to the south-west. The coal branch left the canal below the tunnel. The canal had 22 locks, and three tunnels. Like many English canals it was built to carry valuable cargoes by narrowboats.

==Restoration==
A series of articles about the canal were published in the local press in early 1983, and this led to calls for a society to be formed which would raise public awareness of the canal. A meeting was held in Hereford to facilitate this on 13 April 1983, at which a canal society was formed, which soon became actively engaged in restoration. While the original goal was preservation of the remains, in 1992 the society became the Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal Trust (H&amp;G Canal Trust) and the aim became full restoration of the of canal and locks so that Hereford would once again be linked with Ledbury, Dymock, Newent and the rest of the inland waterway system at Gloucester.

Since 1991 the local council authorities in Herefordshire have set aside land for development as a canal route. The planning department has approved projects with the canal in mind, and has taken action against those trying to build on the proposed route of the canal. Protection of the route of the canal is mandated by the Herefordshire Local Plan, and core strategy E4 not only safeguards the route, but also requires that when adjoining developments are being planned, they must include restoration of the canal. Plans for Hereford city centre include a new basin near the site of the original basin, with the towpath forming an attractive green corridor between there and Aylestone Park. Similar support has been given by the local council authorities in Gloucestershire.

In 2000, the Over Canal Basin (adjacent to the River Severn at Over on the outskirts of Gloucester, where the Canal links with the inland waterways network) was reconstructed entirely by volunteers from the Canal Trust and the national volunteer body the Waterway Recovery Group. The estimated commercial cost of the work was some £500,000, but it was completed against a 10-month deadline, with a budget of just £60,000. The basin was originally filled in when the Over Isolation Hospital was built in 1903. The site was sold for housing development to Swan Homes, and agreement was reached to excavate the basin to enhance the project, under which Wharf House was rebuilt to provide a new canal centre. In late 2011, the Trust were able to buy a short section of the former canal route adjacent to the basin site (Vineyard Hill). This had been purchased by residents in 2004 to protect their communal interests, and was passed to the Trust for a nominal sum. Like the basin, there was a deadline on development, which had to be completed by September 2012, but a major effort by the Waterway Recovery Group and members of the Trust resulted in most of the work being completed in April 2012. It was re-watered by 18 April, four months before its scheduled completion date. It was formally re-opened by Timothy West and Prunella Scales at the 2012 Over Canal Festival.

Major re-development in Hereford city centre has resulted in the provision for a new canal bed which it is hoped will eventually link to a new terminal basin. Further development has also taken place on the Aylestone Park section, after the removal of silt containing heavy metals. Following partial restoration, which saw the Trust working on the park, and Herefordshire Council, owners of the park, working on the canal, a short section at Aylestone was used for a boat rally in May 2011. A slipway enabled the boats to be launched, and the canal will be made wider in due course.

The canal connects to an un-navigable part of the River Severn, separated from the main channel by weirs at Maisemore and Llanthony, both of which have derelict locks associated with them. Maisemore was sold by British Waterways some years ago, and they decided to dispose of Llanthony in 2007. The Canal Trust used a legacy to purchase the site, which includes two cottages, some land, and a small section of the River Severn as well as Llanthony lock. The lock is bigger than that at Maisemore, and access to the entrance lock at Over is easier because boats would be travelling against the flow of the river as they approach it. Over Lock is around deep, as it has to cope with the large tidal range of the River Severn, and so restoration would be difficult. In early 2022 the Trust asked a consulting engineer from the Inland Waterways Association&#x27;s Restoration Hub to assess how the canal could be connected to the river. Three options were suggested, two of which involved restoring Over Lock, but the third was to cross the west channel of the Severn on an aqueduct, and construct a new cut across Alney Island to join the non-tidal river above the entrance to Gloucester Docks and the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal.

At Newent, Bridge Street crossed over the canal on a bridge. When the railway replaced the canal, they constructed a high level bridge over the road, which was lowered to accommodate this solution. The Canal Trust envisaged that the canal could be rebuilt between the platforms of Newent railway station, but this would have involved the construction of large embankments, which were thought to be out of scale with the environment. In 2019, they therefore reconsidered what options were possible, and proposed the use of an inclined plane, using a cradle running on rails to raise boats from the canal level up to the station, with a level section between the platforms, followed by another incline to reach the height required to cross the road and another incline to return boats to the level of the canal on the other side.

In November 2021, planning permission was granted to allow the Trust to construct of new canal at Malswick, on the section that was converted into a railway. An embankment had been built over the original route of the canal, and its removal would have been extremely difficult. The new route therefore runs alongside the embankment, and major construction work took place in 2022. Because the channel cuts through natural clay, it is not expected to need lining when the work is completed. The project included the planting of around 1,000 hedge plants and trees near to the canal.

==Visitor Centre==
The Wharf House at Over Basin is a restored lock cottage that, until 2019, served as a visitor centre and restaurant. From its inception in 2005 until 2019, the Wharf House was operated by the Herefordshire &amp; Gloucestershire Canal Trust, with profits donated to the H&amp;G Canal Trust Charity. In 2019, management of the Wharf House was transferred to a private firm, and the restaurant was renamed The Lock Keepers.

<text>The Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation is the canalisation of the Rivers Chelmer and Blackwater in Essex, in the east of England. The navigation runs for from Springfield Basin in Chelmsford to the sea lock at Heybridge Basin near Maldon. Initial plans faced spirited opposition from Maldon, which were overcome by avoiding the town and terminating at Heybridge, and the navigation opened in 1797. There were some teething problems, and the engineer John Rennie was called back on two occasions to recommend improvements. The impact of the railways was less severe than on many canals, as there was never a direct line between Chelmsford and Maldon. The sea lock at Heybridge was enlarged after the Second World War, but trade gradually declined and ceased in 1972.

Unlike most canals, it was not nationalised in 1948, and remained under the control of the original company. The first leisure boats to use the navigation did so in 1973, when the Inland Waterways Association organised a rally at Chelmsford. Springfield Basin was restored in 1992, but the proprietors faced bankruptcy in 2003, and after two years of negotiation, Essex Waterways Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Inland Waterways Association, took over responsibility for management, although the proprietors retained ownership.

Because Essex and Suffolk Water abstract water from the navigation to supply Hanningfield Reservoir, they have a statutory obligation to maintain the outer gates at Heybridge sea lock, to prevent salt water entering the drinking water supply. They undertook major refurbishment work at the lock during the winters of 2016/17 and 2017/18, including replacement of the outer sea gate with a new design. A long-standing ambition, first proposed in 1985, has been to provide a better destination at Chelmsford, by providing access for boats to the town centre. A proposed link from Springfield Basin has been thwarted by road building in the area, but a plan to replace the automatic weir below Chelmsford Town Centre with a new structure incorporating a navigation lock was recommended in 2020.

==Route==
The navigation runs from Springfield Basin in Chelmsford to the sea lock at Heybridge Basin near Maldon. It has six bridges and drops through 12 locks from the basin to the sea. There is also a set of flood gates at Beeleigh, which prevents water from the River Blackwater flooding the cut to Heybridge Basin. The navigation meanders in a broadly west to east direction between Chelmsford and Maldon, through countryside which is largely arable, and although it passes near to a number of villages, all of them are set back some distance from the waterway.

Prior to the actual construction of the navigation, there had been almost 120 years of proposals for such a scheme, and opposition from the port of Maldon, which anticipated that its revenues would fall if vessels could travel to Chelmsford. The first such scheme was proposed in 1677 by Andrew Yarranton, who published his idea in a work entitled &quot;England&#x27;s Improvements by Sea and Land.&quot; Maldon objected and the scheme came to nothing. In July 1733, John Hore, who was involved in the Kennet, Stroudwater, and the Avon Navigation at Bristol, proposed two schemes, one to make the river navigable, and another to create a new cut between Chelmsford and Maldon. Despite the projected extra costs for a canal, Hore favoured the canal scheme, as he believed there would be less objection from the millers along the river route. Maldon again objected on commercial grounds, and the scheme was dropped.

The next schemes were proposed in 1762, when the canal engineers John Smeaton and Thomas Yeoman both carried out surveys for a possible route. Yeoman produced a second plan in 1765, and this was presented to Parliament. Yeoman had a high standing as a civil engineer, and the opponents to the scheme tried to engage a suitable engineer to counter the proposal, but many of the obvious choices, including James Brindley, declined because they were too busy. Eventually, Ferdinando and William Stratford took on the task, but both caught ague and fever, from which Ferdinando died, while William was ill for a year but then recovered. An act of Parliament to authorise the plan was passed on 6 June 1766, with the stipulation that the work must be completed within 12 years, and that no work could start until 25 per cent of the capital had been raised. The scheme foundered because the required capital had not been subscribed.
Peter Muilman, a Dutch merchant living in London (and the father of Richard) called a meeting in Chelmsford on 2 October 1772, to propose improvements to the river, but a subsequent meeting decided that a new cut would be a better solution. Muilman announced that this scheme would probably not require any locks, and advocated that he should build it once Robert Whitworth had surveyed it, but nothing came of this. Finally in 1792, with navigations in other parts of the country bringing increased prosperity to the towns they served, the people of Chelmsford decide to avoid the opposition of Maldon by bypassing it, and terminating the navigation at Heybridge, on the River Blackwater below Maldon. Under the direction of John Rennie Charles Wedge surveyed the route in 1792 and Matthew Hall surveyed it in 1793. The new route would increase the length of the navigation by about , but this plan formed the basis of a parliamentary bill. Despite spirited opposition by Maldon, the bill became an act of Parliament, the (33 Geo. 3. c. 93), on 17 June 1793, creating &quot;The Company of the Proprietors of the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation&quot;, with powers to raise £40,000 by the issuing of shares, and a further £20,000 if required. Work started soon afterwards, and although John Rennie was officially chief engineer, the project was managed by Richard Coates, who had also assisted Rennie on the Ipswich and Stowmarket Navigation. The grave of Richard Coates stands in Springfield churchyard, while Rennie&#x27;s original survey book for the canal has been preserved.

The port of Maldon now tried to mitigate their loss, and with advice from Benjamin Latrobe, produced a plan to improve the Blackwater through Maldon to its junction with the Chelmer at Beeleigh, which was submitted to Parliament in 1793. Realising that this would make the final cut to Heybridge redundant, the Navigation Company opposed the bill, and it was defeated. Latrobe submitted a revised scheme in April 1795, which was also defeated. This marked the end of his engineering career in Britain, as he emigrated to America shortly afterwards. Work continued on the navigation, with the first section from Heybridge Basin to Little Baddow opening in April 1796 and the navigation opening throughout on 3 June 1797. The final cost was around £50,000.

==Operation==
When completed, the length of the navigation was . 12 locks lowered the level of the navigation by from Springfield Basin in Chelmsford to the sea lock at Heybridge Basin. An additional stop lock protected the new cut from flooding at Beeleigh. Here, the navigation left the course of the River Chelmer, and joined that of the River Blackwater, before entering the final of cut to Heybridge Basin. The waters of the River Blackwater were diverted into the Chelmer, flowing over a weir between Beeleigh Lock and the stop gates. The navigation was constructed with only of water, which was the lowest statutory draught for any of the English commercial waterways. The maximum headroom is . The locks were constructed to take barges which were and each could carry around 25 tons. They were horse-drawn, and remained so until the 1960s, when diesel outboard motors were fitted. The only branch was a cut to Langford Mill, built privately by Mr Westcomb. It was well used until the 1870s, but was unused after 1881.

A community developed around Heybridge Basin, with Richard Tovee, a sawyer by trade, and Thomas Malden, a coal merchant, both buying plots of land to further their trade. The Navigation Company built a granary, which was used to store perishable goods, while rope-makers and boat builders also established themselves nearby. Soon a pub and a brewery appeared, and the settlement steadily grew in size.

The Navigation experienced some teething problems, with floods in 1797 creating shoals which prevented the passage of barges. These got steadily worse, until Rennie was called back in 1799 to address the problem. Rennie was again recalled in 1805, when the mill owners complained about leakage through the locks and requested damages. Further improvements were made, including the rebuilding of Heybridge sea lock by James Green, and trade developed steadily. The first inland gasworks in Britain was built in Chelmsford in 1819, using coal brought up the navigation. Besides coal, bricks, stone, timber and general cargo was carried from Heybridge to Chelmsford, and the major cargo in the reverse direction was grain and flour. Local wharfs served the communities of Little Baddow, Boreham, Ulting and Heybridge. At its peak in the mid 19th century, the canal was carrying over 60,000 tons of cargo per year.

=== Locks ===
The twelve locks on the navigation are:
==Decline==
The Eastern Counties Railway reached Chelmsford in 1843, and a branch line from Witham reached Maldon in 1848, but there was never a direct line between the two towns. Although trade declined, the impact of the railways was less significant than on many canals. Following the Second World War, the sea lock into Heybridge Basin was extended to , so that coasters carrying timber from the continent could enter the basin to transfer their cargo to barges. Traffic slowly declined until the last load of timber was delivered to Browns Yard (now Travis Perkins) on Springfield Basin in 1972. Although commercial traffic ceased, the navigation continued to derive income from water abstraction and from the sale of wood from the willows which grow along the banks. The willow is used for making cricket bats, and the trees were first planted in the 1880s when one of the directors saw the need for alternative sources of income.
The navigation is unusual in that it was not nationalised in 1948 when most of the other waterways in the UK were, and remained under the control of the original Company of Proprietors of the Chelmer &amp; Blackwater Navigation Ltd.

==Leisure era==
Prior to the cessation of commercial traffic in 1972, pleasure craft were prohibited from using the locks, and for a short period, the only boats to use the navigation were the company work boats and canoes. Leisure boats used the navigation for the first time in 1973, when the Inland Waterways Association (IWA) organised a rally at Kings Head Meadow, Chelmsford. Subsequently, leisure boats were moored at Paper Mill Lock and Hoe Mill Lock. Springfield Basin became unusable after the gates were damaged by vandals in the late 1970s, and gradually silted up. The basin was restored to use in 1992, when the IWA co-ordinated various bodies to undertake the work. The National Rivers Authority dredged the basin, Essex County Council repaired the lock bridge, riparian owners repaired wharves, and members of the IWA and the Waterway Recovery Group repaired the lock and the feeder system to the basin. A boat rally was held in 1993, and the project won the &quot;Shell Best of Britain Award.&quot;

The construction of housing and restaurants around the Springfield Basin site took place, including Coates Quay and Waterfront Place, which meant that the basin became accessible to the public for the first time, and Lockside Marina was built just above Springfield Lock. However, the navigation company was unable to pay its way, and went into administration in 2003. Although British Waterways were approached, they declined to take over the navigation. After negotiations with the administrator, the Inland Waterways Association (IWA) signed a maintenance and operating agreement in November 2005 to take over responsibility for the running of the navigation through a wholly owned subsidiary called Essex Waterways Ltd.

While Essex Waterways manage the navigation from day to day, it is still owned by the Company of Proprietors. The towpath from Maldon to Chelmsford has been designated as a public footpath, and is maintained in good order. Narrow boats can be hired from Paper Mill lock, and the infrastructure is being steadily upgraded. Access to the navigation from the River Blackwater is only possible at certain states of the tide, and advance booking to use the sea lock is required. Almost the entire canal is now a conservation area, after Chelmsford so designated the part within their jurisdiction in 1991, and Maldon and Braintree district councils took similar action subsequently.

On 18 February 2016, the Chelmsford Civic Society held a meeting at the Essex Record Office to consider the option of extending the canal from Springfield Basin to a new destination nearer to the town centre. Over 100 people attended the meeting, at which the idea of a new cut from the basin was aired. The cut would avoid a weir and low bridge to rejoin the river system where the River Can and Chelmer merge, and a new waterside area would be constructed in the town centre. Although the leader of the council actively opposed the concept, the idea of a better destination for the navigation had been a long-standing dream, having first been proposed in 1985 in a report by the IWA, and embraced by the council in 2002. The link was downgraded to an &quot;aspiration&quot; following a 2008 planning enquiry, although it remained on the town centre development plans, and the replacement Essex Record Office building was sited so that it would overlook the link. The link ceased to be a favoured option in 2020, after decisions to build a new link road between Parkway and the site of the old gas works, which was being redeveloped as housing.

An alternative would be to use the course of the Chelmer. Navigation is prevented by a large weir structure, which was installed in the 1960s as part of a flood defence scheme. Its principal function is to maintain water levels in the rivers within the city, which would otherwise become muddy ditches at some times of the year. Since 1995, it had been maintained by the Environment Agency, but they decided that they could no longer justify the costs of maintaining the structure, which consists of two radial gates at either side of a central tilting gate, with a control building on the north bank of the river. Chelmsford City Council commissioned a feasibility study, which proposed that the automatic gates could be replaced, and a navigation lock built alongside the new structure, on the north side of the river. It is estimated that the project would take two years to complete at a cost of around £6 million, much of which would be provided by Community Infrastructure Levy money, from the housing developments taking place in the vicinity. Some 970 new homes are expected to be provided in the Chelmsford Waterside neighbourhood, and the council has obtained a grant of £10.7 million from the government&#x27;s Housing Infrastructure Fund, enabling it to address issues of access, contamination of the land, and the presence of gas mains which currently hinder the development.

Much of the maintenance is carried out by local volunteers as well as volunteers from Waterway Recovery Group, which is also part of the IWA. Regular working parties help to keep the waterway, including the towpath, locks and other structures well maintained, and many of the recent improvements have been undertaken by the volunteers. In February 2016, the two groups worked together to upgrade of towpath near Papermill Lock, where a section of muddy towpath was given an all-weather surface by using 150 tons of road planings. The material was donated by Essex Highways, after it had been removed from roads during resurfacing work.

===Heybridge Sea Lock===
The navigation is connected to the tidal River Blackwater by Heybridge Sea Lock. Its maintenance is unusual, in that the Northumbrian Water Group has a statutory obligation to maintain the mitre gates and the sea gate at the eastern end of the lock. The construction of Hanningfield Reservoir was authorised in 1950 as a joint project between Southend Waterworks Company and the South Essex Waterworks Company, both of which are now part of Essex and Suffolk Water, which is itself part of the Northumbrian Water Group. When the Hanningfield Water Order 1950 was passed by Parliament, it included a clause that made the water companies responsible for the lock gates, because water from the navigation would be pumped to the reservoir, and they needed to ensure that it would not become contaminated with salt. This arrangement was modified by the Chelmer Navigation Agreement 1964, which moved the responsibility for carrying out repairs to the Chelmer and Blackwater Company, but required the water companies to fund the work once its extent was agreed.

The lock was originally constructed of masonry, but in the mid-1960s, it was extended at the seaward end, when a steel caisson gate was installed in a reinforced concrete structure. The gate was designed by Sir William Halcrow &amp; Partners, and weighed 58 tons. It was moved into place by electric motors driving chains, and had a hollow centre, making it partially buoyant, with the buoyancy being adjusted by the addition of ballast. Over time, the steelwork degraded, and the mechanism for controlling the flow of water into and out of the gate to alter its buoyancy ceased to operate, resulting in the rollers on which it moved seizing up. In 2014 Northumbrian Water agreed that the structure was beyond economic repair, and due to the complexity of the work, decided to manage the replacement project themselves. Options were somewhat constrained by the fact that the lock is a grade II listed structure, the site is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, a Special Protection Area, a Ramsar site and is next to a Marine Conservation Zone.

After carrying out a feasibility study in October 2014, the sea gate was dismantled and removed in November 2015. Having checked its dimensions, Northumberland Water commissioned MWH Global and Kenneth Grub to design a new gate which would fit into the existing pocket, so that no modification of the lock structure would be required. The new gate would incorporate a number of improvements over the old. The chain drive was replaced by hydraulic rams, and the gate was no longer a buoyant structure. This reduced its weight to 26 tons, while the seals were mounted in sub-frames, allowing them to be more easily replaced. The gate moved along a rail, rather than over rollers, and featured an infilled hand-rail, effectively increasing its height. This gives greater protection to the inner timber gates from wave action.

A re-usable stop-log dam was constructed, to enable the lock to be isolated while the installation of the new gate was carried out and for future maintenance. While the lock was isolated, it was decided that the upper timber gates would also be replaced, and new gates were manufactured from sustainably sourced oak and ekki. Each gate weighed 5.5 tonnes, and they were craned into position in February 2017. The rails and sills for the sea gate were fitted in March, and the lock was then re-opened on 31 March for the summer season, with the sea gate expected to be fitted in November. The lock was drained in October 2017 for the sea gate to be fitted, and the intermediate mitre gates were also replaced. The sea gate had been tested and commissioned sufficiently for the lock to be reopened at the end of March 2018, with final commissioning and reinstatement of the footpath taking place in April and May.

<doc id="151892" wikidata="Q5298877" url="?curid=151892" title="Dorset and Somerset Canal">
<text>The Dorset and Somerset Canal was a proposed canal in southwestern England. The main line was intended to link Poole, Dorset with the Kennet and Avon Canal near Bradford on Avon, Wiltshire. A branch was to go from the main line at Frome to the southern reaches of the Somerset coalfield at Nettlebridge. Construction of the branch started in 1786, using boat lifts rather than locks to cope with changes of level, but the company ran out of money and the canal was abandoned in 1803, never to be completed.

==Proposals==
Plans for a major canal to link Bristol and Poole, and therefore to make travel from the Bristol Channel to the English Channel easier and safer, were proposed in 1792. The suggested route passed through Wareham, Sturminster Newton, Wincanton and Frome, joining the River Avon at Bath. Collieries in the Mendips near Nettlebridge were to be served by a branch canal, while the main trade was seen as coal travelling southwards and clay travelling northwards. A public meeting was held in Wincanton in January 1793, at which a list of subscribers was started.

There were several proposals as to the precise route, and so the canal engineer Robert Whitworth was asked to survey a route. By the time he reported back in September 1793, the route started from the Kennet and Avon Canal at Freshford, Somerset, rather than Bath, and having passed through Stalbridge, headed for Blandford rather than Wareham. The new route reflected the availability of water to supply the canal. Whitworth was busy and recommended that the promoters of the scheme should employ William Bennet of Frome as engineer. Bennet completed a detailed survey in 1795, estimating that the cost of the canal would be about £200,000, and the promoters approved most of his plan at a meeting in July. Short branches to Hamworthy and Wareham were added to the scheme, and the proposed junction with the Kennet and Avon Canal was later moved to Widbrook.

By the time parliamentary approval was sought, the southern end had been cut back to Shillingstone, to reduce the cost, and an act of Parliament was obtained on 24 March 1796, giving the company powers to raise £150,000, with an additional £75,000 if required. However, with the social changes and inflation that was occurring at the time, less than £80,000 was raised. With this, the company decided to start with the branch to Frome, in order to capitalise on the lucrative markets in the coal fields and the clothing industry in Frome.

==Construction==

Construction began on the branch line, and about of canal was built, from Stratton Common towards Frome, passing through Coleford and Vobster. The works included the three-arched Murtry Aqueduct over the Mells River in Vallis Vale, near Hapsford, a larger aqueduct at Coleford, and a tunnel at Goodeaves Farm, which was not completed.

Both the main line and the branch involved significant changes in level, and the act of Parliament had specified that conventional locks would be used on the main line, but that &quot;caissons&quot; would be used on the branch, which rose by 264 ft (80.5m) over its length. The idea of using vertical boat lifts was proposed by James Fussell, owner of the nearby Mells ironworks, and his particular design, known as a balance lock, was patented in 1798. It consisted of two tanks, joined by chains which passed over large wheels. Boats entered one or both of the caissons, which each had an extra chamber below the main caisson, and the chamber of the top caisson was filled with water to provide the extra weight needed to cause the lift to operate. Although different in detail to those later used successfully on the Grand Western Canal, it was essentially very similar.

Fussell built the first boat lift at Barrow Hill. It was designed to take 10-ton boats, lifting them by , and was tested during September and October 1800. It was formally demonstrated on 13 October 1800, and the &quot;Bath Chronicle&quot; carried a glowing report 3 days later.
Five more lifts were to be built on the Barrow Hill section, and works started on the pits for four of them, but the company ran out of money in 1802, with of canal still to be excavated and the boat lifts unfinished. Having consulted an engineer called Underhill, the company obtained a second act of Parliament, the (43 Geo. 3. c. cviii), to allow them to raise more money and to build railways instead of the canal if this would reduce the cost, but they were unable to raise any more finance. Construction ceased in 1803, and the canal was never completed.

==Today==
Several features are still visible including a bridge that once carried the Edford to Stratton Common road over the canal and an aqueduct at Coleford, with two semi-circular arches nearly across and a similar height. The boat lift at Barrow Hill was the site of archaeological excavations in 2007. The three-arched aqueduct over the River Mells at Murtry Bottom still has some of retaining wall attached to it. A project to consider how best to conserve it has been aided by a grant from the Somerset Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund.

<text>The Gloucester and Sharpness Canal (also known as the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal) is a ship canal in the west of England, between Gloucester and Sharpness, completed in 1827. For much of its length the canal runs close to the tidal River Severn, but it cuts off a significant loop in the river, at a once-dangerous bend near Arlingham. It was once the broadest and deepest canal in the world. The canal is long.

==Canal planning and construction==

Conceived in the canal mania period of the late 18th century, the Gloucester and Berkeley Ship Canal scheme (as it was originally named) was started by architect and civil engineer Robert Mylne. In 1793 an act of Parliament, the (33 Geo. 3. c. 97) was obtained authorising the raising of a total of £200,000. The project rapidly encountered financial difficulties, to such an extent that Mylne left the project in 1798.

By mid-1799 costs had reached £112,000 but only of the canal had been completed. Mylne&#x27;s role was taken over by James Dadford, who had originally been engaged as resident engineer on the project in 1795. Lack of funds resulted in the company ceasing to employ Dadford in 1800.

===Decade of capital raising===
Between 1800 and 1810 various unfruitful attempts were made to raise money to allow further building. Money from tolls and rents allowed for some improvements to be made to the basin at Gloucester in 1813.

===Eventual completion===
Following the Public Works Loans Act 1817 (57 Geo. 3. c. 34), it was possible for the company to borrow money from the Exchequer Bill Loan Commission. This, along with further share issues, provided enough money to bring the scheme to completion. After these significant delays, the canal opened in April 1827. In the course of its construction the canal had cost £440,000 (). As opened, the canal was wide, deep and could take craft of up to . The longer of the two locks onto the canal proper was long.

===Eventual dividends===

By the middle of the 19th century it proved possible to pay a small dividend, the debt to the Exchequer Bill Loan Commission having been repaid with the help of a loan of £60,000 from the Pelican Life Assurance Company. In 1871 the last of the debts incurred in the course of funding the canal, including the Pelican loan, were paid off. 

=== Sharpness New Docks ===
A new, larger entrance and tidal basin at Sharpness was completed in 1874; during this year the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal Company acquired the Worcester and Birmingham Canal Company. At this point, the canal company was renamed the Sharpness New Docks and Gloucester and Birmingham Navigation Company.

Where the Severn Railway Bridge (completed in 1879) passed over the canal, a swing section was constructed to avoid restricting headroom.

===Purton hulks===

In 1909, following a collapse in the bank of the river, the canal company&#x27;s chief engineer A. J. Cullis called for old vessels to be run aground along the bank of the Severn, near Purton, to create a makeshift tidal erosion barrier to reinforce the narrow strip of land between the river and canal. Barges, trows and schooners were &quot;hulked&quot; at high tide, and have since filled with silt. More boats have been added, including the schooner &quot;Katherine Ellen&quot; which was impounded in 1921 for running guns to the IRA, the Kennet barge &quot;Harriett&quot;, and ferrocement barges built in World War II.

In 1999, Paul Barnett started a privately funded research project to record the 81 vessels at the site, recognised as the largest ships&#x27; graveyard in mainland Britain. In 2010 British Waterways took control of the site in an attempt to protect it.

===Bridge-houses===

Eight of the bridges have Neo-classical bridge-men&#x27;s houses in the near vicinity. These were built in the early 19th century when the volume of traffic on the canal made it important that all the bridges could open at night so that vessels could meet the tides at Sharpness. At that time, the other bridge-men lived in existing houses that were close enough to their bridges.

The classical-style bridge-men&#x27;s houses were originally symmetrical in plan with gables on each elevation. Each had a living room, one bedroom, a scullery at the back and a porch with Doric columns at the front. In later years, the houses have been extended to provide more accommodation and modern facilities. Today, the houses are in private ownership, and most of them are Grade II listed.

==Modern times==
In 1905 traffic exceeded one million tons for the first time. Oil was added to the list of cargoes carried by the canal, with bulk oil carriers taking fuel to storage tanks sited to the south of Gloucester. In 1937 the canal was navigated by the submarines and . The canal was nationalized in 1948. At the same time the Sharpness Dock Police which had policed the dock since 1874 were absorbed into the British Transport Police.

In 1955 the Board of Survey of Canals and Inland Waterways released a report that, among other things, described the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal as carrying substantial traffic and offering scope for commercial development.

The River Cam, which is subject to accretion due to industrial and agricultural runoff, is an important feeder for the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal. It was formerly navigable as the Cambridge Arm with one entrance lock leading to a basin and wharf at Cambridge, the limit of navigation due to mill weirs and low bridges on the Bristol to Gloucester road. The lock was missing and the basin abandoned by 1901. Most of the straightened channel has survived as flood defence improvements and is potentially still navigable, but the entrance is now blocked by a very low bridge at the site of the former lock.

By the mid-1980s commercial traffic had largely come to a halt, the canal being given over to pleasure cruisers with the exception of a few passages by grain barges. The oil trade ceased in 1985 with the closure of the petroleum depot at Quedgeley. In order to allow the A430 Gloucester southwestern bypass to be built the canal had to be diverted. This new cut eliminated a major problem which had plagued commercial traffic since opening: the sharp double bend in the canal. The new section of channel was opened on 6 May 2006. In January 2009 a project began to replace the Patch Bridge swing bridge with a motor-powered design instead of the former hand-cranked system.

Today, the canal can be used by boats up to in length, in beam and in height. The maximum draft is .

The canal links directly to the Stroudwater Navigation at Saul Junction, the only such flat crossing between two different canal companies anywhere in the world.

<text>The Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal is a disused canal in Greater Manchester, England, built to link Bolton and Bury with Manchester. The canal, when fully opened, was long. It was accessed via a junction with the River Irwell in Salford. Seventeen locks were required to climb to the summit as it passed through Pendleton, heading northwest to Prestolee before it split northwest to Bolton and northeast to Bury. Between Bolton and Bury the canal was level and required no locks. Six aqueducts were built to allow the canal to cross the rivers Irwell and Tonge and several minor roads.

The canal was commissioned in 1791 by local landowners and businessmen and built between 1791 and 1808, during the Golden Age of canal building, at a cost of £127,700 (£ today). Originally designed for narrow gauge boats, during its construction the canal was altered into a broad gauge canal to allow an ultimately unrealised connection with the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The canal company later converted into a railway company and built a railway line close to the canal&#x27;s path, which required modifications to the Salford arm of the canal.

Most of the freight carried was coal from local collieries but, as the mines reached the end of their working lives sections of the canal fell into disuse and disrepair and it was officially abandoned in 1961. In 1987 a society was formed with the aim of restoring the canal for leisure use and, in 2006, restoration began in the area around the junction with the River Irwell in Salford. The canal is currently navigable as far as Oldfield Road, Salford.


== History ==
=== Proposal ===
The local geology of the Irwell Valley, which included steep sided valleys with fast flowing rivers subject to rapid flooding and dry seasons, confined local river transport to the Mersey and Irwell Navigation, west of Manchester. Financial unrest and British involvement in the American Revolutionary War restricted local transport investment to road improvements.

With the arrival of more favourable conditions, including the end of the war, a proposal for a canal to link the towns of Manchester, Bolton and Bury was mooted. Matthew Fletcher had in 1789 been employed as a technical advisor and had surveyed the route of the proposed canal, but the first public notice came from Manchester on 4 September 1790. The initial proposal probably came from a group in Bolton, with the support of the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company. A meeting was &quot;intended to be holden at the House of Mr Shawe, the Bull&#x27;s Head in Manchester aforesaid, on Monday, the twentieth day of this instant, September, at eleven o&#x27;clock in the forenoon&quot;, where &quot;Surveys, Plans, Levels, Estimates and Proposals&quot; would be presented. A further meeting on 16 September, held in Bolton, appointed a committee of six Boltonians chaired by Lord Grey de Wilton to attend at Manchester. A series of resolutions at this meeting followed a discussion of the route, and authorised the necessary actions to bring the plan into fruition, which included the petitioning of Parliament for the required bill. Hugh Henshall was asked to survey the proposed route of the canal.

For local industries along the route of the proposed canal, whose operations relied on water from local rivers and brooks which the canal might also use, its construction was a controversial idea. At a meeting in Bolton on 4 October 1790, it was resolved that &quot;proper clauses be inserted in the bill to prevent injury to owners of mills&quot;. A meeting in Bury at the Eagle &amp; Child public house on 29 September 1790 secured an agreement that &quot;the utility of this scheme nevertheless cannot with propriety be ascertained until such time as it has been certified, from whence and in what proportion the proprietors of the intended navigation expect to draw their resources of water&quot;. At another meeting in Bury, on 13 October 1790, Hugh Henshall gave a written report on the canal, and stated that his plan would not require water from the river in times of drought, but that floods and rivulets would supply his reservoirs. He suggested that mill owners could be protected by a suitable clause in the bill, and such a clause was duly obtained by Robert Peel. Businesses in Bolton were concerned with the location of the canal terminus, and proposed the construction of a tunnel to allow the terminus to be built closer to the town centre. Ralph Fletcher, spokesman for those concerned, reported on this proposal to the committee, although no tunnel was built.

=== Subscribers and funding ===
A document entitled &quot;A list of subscribers to the intended Bolton Bury and Manchester Canal Navigation&quot;, now kept in the Greater Manchester County Record Office, lists notable subscribers including the Earl of Derby, Lord Grey de Wilton, Matthew Fletcher, and Robert Peel. The 95 investments ranged from £100 to £3,000, and many were made by proxy. The total sum of investments was £47,700; £5 per £100 share was initially paid, with an additional £10 call made by 10 August 1791. Similar share calls were made at regular intervals over the following years. The first dividend of 4% was paid in July 1812, with regular payments following thereafter.

=== Work begins ===
Following a parliamentary survey of the route by Charles McNiven, the bill received royal assent on 13 May 1791 and became an act of Parliament, the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Act 1791 (31 Geo. 3. c. 68), for the construction of the canal, by which &quot;the proprietors were empowered to purchase land for a breadth of 26 yards on level ground, and wider where required for cuttings or embankments.&quot; The act allowed the company to raise £47,000, with shares of £100. The intention was that at Prestolee the route would divide into two branches (arms), with one branch towards Bolton and the other to Bury, but it would not, however, join the River Irwell. The proprietors were entitled to take water from any brooks within of the canal, or within of the canal summits at Bolton and Bury.

At a meeting in Manchester on 30 June 1791, at the house of Alexander Patten, a committee was formed with the following members:

# Lord Grey de Wilton, Heaton House, Lancashire
# Sir John Edensor Heathcote, Longton, Newcastle, Staffordshire
# Thomas Butterworth Bayley esq. — Hope, Salford
# Robert Andrews esq — Rivington
# James Wareing, Gentleman, Knowsley
# Matthew Fletcher (Mine owner, Clifton)
# Peter Wright, Gentleman, Manchester
# William Marsden, Merchant, Manchester
# Charles McNiven, Gentleman, Manchester
# Hugh Henshall, Longpost, Staffordshire
# John Pilkington, Merchant, Manchester

The meeting secured a resolution that &quot;Matthew Fletcher and Mr McNiven shall dispatch or procure 100 wheelbarrows and as many planks as they shall think necessary for the use and accommodation of the canal navigation&quot;. Further meetings took place from 26 to 29 July. Matthew Fletcher was ordered to meet with land owners to discuss the purchase of any land along the route of the canal, and with this in mind, on 30 July 1791 John Seddon of Sandy Lane was ordered to survey the line of the canal beginning within the estate of John Edenson Heathcote, and ending at the southern extremity of the Reverend Dauntesey&#x27;s estate. Fletcher and Henshall were ordered to contact people and companies in the building trade to discuss construction.

At a meeting on 16 August 1791, &quot;several persons&quot; attended, and made offers for the contract to build the canal. A Mr John Seddon of Little Hulton, a labourer, agreed to a contract on Matthew Fletcher&#x27;s terms, for a &quot;certain part of the canal&quot;. Five other persons were rejected, their proposals not receiving the &quot;approbation&quot; of the committee.

With news of the planned Rochdale Canal link into Manchester, the company proposed to extend the canal from Bury through Littleborough, and to connect with the Rochdale Canal at Sladen. The new route, known as the Bury and Sladen Canal, was intended as a rival scheme to the proposed Rochdale link into Manchester. A survey was also carried out on a proposed extension from Sladen to Sowerby Bridge. The company also considered links to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the Mersey and Irwell Navigation. These plans would have substantially increased the trans-Pennine traffic using the company&#x27;s canal, and caused a potential loss of traffic and revenue on the nearby Bridgewater Canal. With this in mind, the owner of the Bridgewater Canal, the Duke of Bridgewater, agreed to allow the Rochdale Canal Company to connect to his canal at Manchester. Despite the persistence of the canal company, the Rochdale Canal plan won the day and in 1797 the company abandoned the Bury and Sladen Canal plan.

After several years of construction, on 9 January 1794 an agreement was reached with the Leeds and Liverpool Canal Company to create a link from the Bolton arm of the canal to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Red Moss, near Horwich. This agreement required significant design changes to allow the canal to carry the wider boats used on the broad gauge Leeds and Liverpool Canal, which included a change to broad locks. Benjamin Outram was employed to inspect the works, and reported on the cost of this conversion as being £26,924. Although the necessary changes were implemented, the route of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal was altered and the link was not built. In the same year the Haslingden Canal link to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal was proposed, from the Bury arm of the canal. Although authorised by an act of Parliament, it too was never built. The canal company remained hopeful of a link between the two canals, but all hope of this was lost when on 21 June 1819 an act of Parliament was enacted to create a link between the Leigh extension of the Bridgewater Canal, and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.

A report entitled &quot;A Statement of the Situation of the Works of the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal, on the Eighteenth of December, 1795.&quot; gives details of the progress of the works, including details of bridges, cuttings, raised bankings and aqueducts. Much of the document details the work required to convert the canal to broad gauge. A length between Oldfield Lane in Salford and Giants Seat Locks in Outwood was navigable with of water. The remaining work included strengthening work to the banks, an increase of water depth to , and the gravelling of half of the towpath. Between Giants Seat locks and Ringley Bridge two locks had been erected, with a small section of canal to be broadened before becoming navigable. From Ringley Bridge to Prestolee Aqueduct one lock had been erected. Nob End Locks were still under construction but mostly complete, although the basin at the bottom had not yet been dug. The stretch to Bolton had at this time been widened, with several bridges requiring further work, incomplete embankments, construction of a weir, and gravelling of the towpath. On the Bury arm, almost the entire length had been dug, and walls to support the canal along the bank of the Irwell had been built. Some widening of previously narrow sections had yet to be undertaken, none of the towpath had been gravelled, and no fences had been erected along the towpath.

Significant parts of the canal were completed by 1796, including the stretch up to Bury in October of that year. With the completion of the Bolton arm in the following year, much of the canal opened for business. The connection to Fletcher&#x27;s Canal was completed in 1800, but with the failure of the scheme to connect the Bolton arm of the canal to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, the canal remained isolated from any other navigable waterway. One proposed remedy involved the construction of an aqueduct over the River Irwell in Manchester, to connect directly to the Rochdale Canal between Castlefield and Piccadilly. A bill was proposed in 1799 but after strong objections from the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company they eventually gave up and subsequently, over the following seven years, the canal company purchased enough land to build a canal link directly to the Irwell.
During construction the company, having spent all of the money allowed in the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Act 1791, incurred a debt of £31,345. They therefore applied for a further act of Parliament to raise more money. This act, the (45 Geo. 3. c. iv), allowed them to raise an additional £80,000. This allowed them to repay the debt, and continue work to finish the canal. An inspection in June 1808 reported that by November 1808 the canal would be complete throughout.

A connection to the Rochdale Canal was eventually built in 1839 via the Manchester and Salford Junction Canal, which was funded in part by the proprietors of the MB&amp;B canal.

=== Traffic ===
Most of the traffic along the canal transported coal from the many collieries that existed along its length, such as Outwood Colliery and Ladyshore Colliery. Some of these pits were linked to the canal by road, and some by short tramlines. In the late 19th century as much as of coal and of other materials including night soil and fruit were transported annually. The canal also enabled the transport of salt from Cheshire to the many bleach and dye works in its area – hence the name of Salt Wharf on the Bolton arm of the canal. Tolls were easily calculated as milestones were placed along the towpath at intervals. This was important as journeys were often quite short, the collieries being so close to industry along the canal&#x27;s length.

The boats used to transport coal were short and narrow, and each contained a row of boxes used for carrying coal. Each box had a base of two halves, hinged and held closed with chains. These boxes would be lifted out of the boats, positioned by crane over a bunker or cart and emptied by releasing the chains on the base. This design helped keep the canal competitive, as it increased the speed with which loading and unloading of the boats could be performed.

The canal would often freeze in winter, so an icebreaker was used to ensure the canal remained navigable during the cold weather. Named &quot;Sarah Lansdale&quot; and owned by James Crompton Paperworks, it was towed by a team of horses while the crew stood astride the deck, secured to the handrails, rocking the boat from side to side and breaking the ice in the process. Often, ice would be encountered that was so thick the boat would rise up onto the surface of the ice. This boat did once reside at the boat museum in Ellesmere Port Dock but was later destroyed by fire.

Food and drink was made available to those using the canal in several places including Margaret Barlow&#x27;s Tea Gardens, Kilcoby Cottage and Rhodes Lock. A camping ground was also available at Kilcoby Cottage. The nearby Giant&#x27;s Seat House was for some time the home of the canal manager.

The canal also carried packet services, with passengers facing a three-hour journey between Bolton and Manchester. The first passenger boat to Bolton was launched in 1796 from the Windsor Castle public house, and in 1798 a new packet boat was built for the use of the company. Fares were initially fixed by the canal company (although from 1805 contracted-out) and based upon the service required; a passenger using the state cabin from Bolton to Manchester would be charged one shilling six pence, and a single shilling on the return journey. Passengers would change boats at Prestolee to avoid delays at the lock flight and also to save water, and a purpose-built covered walkway the length of the road was constructed for their benefit. Another passenger service ran along the two arms from Bolton to Bury, and over 60,000 passengers per year travelled on the canal; between July 1833 and June 1834, 21,060 made the journey from Bolton to Manchester, 21,212 people travelled from Manchester to Bolton, and 20,818 intermediary passengers hopped on and off the boats en route. In 1834 the Bolton to Manchester service earned £1,177 and the Bolton to Bury service earned £75. The service was quite luxurious compared to some packet boat services: central heating was provided in winter and drinks were served on board. This caused a tragedy in 1818, however, when a party of twenty drunken passengers managed to capsize the boat and a number of passengers, including two children, were drowned.

Several fatal incidents combined with general passenger concern caused the canal company to improve passenger safety; in 1802 a wall was built at the wharf at Oldfield Lane in Salford and in 1833 a gas lamp was installed at Ringley Wharf.

A parcel service was also offered, although this proved unpopular as it was unreliable.

=== Railway proposal ===
In March 1829 the idea of building a branch railway line from the Oldfield Road terminus in Salford to the new Liverpool and Manchester Railway was mooted, but nothing was built. In 1830 the canal company, led by chairman Sir John Tobin, began to promote a proposal to build a railway along the line of the canal, from Salford to Bolton. Alexander Nimmo was employed to report on the proposal and told that it was possible &quot;so far as he expressed himself capable of judging from his present cursory view of the canal&quot;. The shareholders then sought a bill for a railway from Bolton to Manchester and on 23 August 1831 obtained an act of Parliament, the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal and Railway Act 1831 (1 &amp; 2 Will. 4. c. lx), to become the &quot;Company of Proprietors of the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Navigation and Railway Company&quot;. They were empowered to build a line from Manchester to Bolton and Bury, &quot;upon or near the line of ... the Canal&quot;, and a branch from Clifton Aqueduct through to Great Lever. In 1832 this company obtained another act of Parliament, the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal and Railway Act 1832 (2 &amp; 3 Will. 4. c. lxix), that allowed it to build the railway. Due mainly to the objections of local mine owners who would have lost access to the canal and supplies, and would not have had branch railways built for them, the company agreed to an amending bill which would keep the canal and allow the new railway to be constructed alongside it. Due to technical and financial constraints the branch to Bury was never built. The canal therefore survived, although locks 4 and 5 in Salford were moved and combined into a two-rise staircase, with a second tunnel built underneath the line which became known as the Manchester and Bolton Railway.
The line opened on 28 May 1838, and the company had purchased four locomotives from Bury, Curtis, and Kennedy, two from George Forrester and Company, and two from William Fairbairn &amp; Sons. Between the opening date and 9 January 1839 the railway carried 228,799 passengers – far more than had been carried on the canal. Shortly thereafter passenger services on the canal ceased and the boats were sold off. In 1846 the company was taken over by the Manchester and Leeds Railway, which itself became the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;YR) the following year. In 1890 the L&amp;YR widened the line through Salford. Locks 4, 5 and 6 were moved slightly to the north and the tunnel under the railway was replaced by a bridge (although it is still referred to as a tunnel).

In 1922 the L&amp;YR amalgamated into the London and North Western Railway, and in 1923 this company amalgamated into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. This company was nationalised in 1948 under the Transport Act 1947 and became part of British Railways.

=== Decline ===
By 1924 the Bolton arm had experienced a significant fall in traffic, although until the 1930s, when colliery closures reduced traffic even further, coal trade remained brisk. By 1935 Fletcher&#x27;s Canal had fallen into disuse. Burst banks alongside the Irwell and Croal rivers (caused largely by subsidence from mining activities) were common. A major breach occurred in 1936 and was never repaired. of land around this breach was purchased from the British Transport Commission by Cream&#x27;s Paper Mill, who subsequently built over part of the canal.

On 2 March 1937 the London, Midland and Scottish Railway held a Special General Meeting during which they proposed to abandon the canal from Clifton Aqueduct to Bailey Bridge, from Bailey Bridge to Bury, and the entire Bolton arm from Nob End Locks to Bolton. The proposal was not carried but four years later, under the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Act of 1941, they abandoned of the canal, including a section from Prestolee to Clifton and the entire Bolton arm. In 1939, during the Second World War, the Ministry of Transport ordered a half-mile section in Agecroft piped, to reduce the risk of German bomb damage damaging the adjacent Magnesium Elektron Company&#x27;s site.

Although it continued to generate revenue from the sale of water, tolls produced only a small proportion of the canal&#x27;s income. In 1946, against expenses of £12,500, it earned a total of £7,296, of which only £471 was from tolls. In 1951 total income was £8,815 against a total expenditure of £9,574. In the same year, the canal carried of coal and no other materials.

A British Transport Commission report of 1955 included the canal in its list of &quot;Waterways having insufficient commercial prospects to justify their retention for navigation&quot;. Following an Act of Parliament, in 1961 the canal was abandoned. A single coal delivery service between Sion Street and Bury Moors continued until 1968, but this was the last commercial traffic to use the canal.

== Features ==

There are several notable features along the canal, including Prestolee Aqueduct and Clifton Aqueduct, both of which are Grade II listed structures. Nob End Locks (sometimes referred to as Prestolee Locks) sit at the junction of the three arms of the canal at Nob End. They comprise two sets of three staircase locks, separated by a passing basin. These locks served to lower the level of the canal by over a distance of . The upper staircase is still visible, but most of the lower staircase was filled in at some point in the 1950s, and much of the stonework was removed.

A major breach of the canal along the Bury arm revealed the scale of the engineering used in the construction of the retaining wall. Railway rails, which were used to increase the strength of the walls, are still clearly visible at the site of the breach.

The Mount Sion steam crane (a depiction of which is used as the logo of the Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal Society) sits rusting and unused at Mount Sion, on the Bury arm. One of the earliest surviving cranes in England, it was built some time about 1875–1884 for Mount Sion Bleach Works by Thomas Smith &amp; Sons of Rodley and was used to unload coal boxes from barges into the yard below the canal. It was granted Grade II listed status in 2011.

== Design and construction ==

The canal was originally supplied by the River Irwell in Bury, at the Weddell Brook tributary. This proved insufficient for local industry and in 1842 Elton Reservoir at Bury was built to become the canal&#x27;s principal supply. Although the Bury and Bolton arms are on one level, the Salford arm used seventeen broad locks, including some in staircases (Nob End, for example), to descend over from the summit level to the lowest point at Salford. Robert Fulton had proposed an inclined plane at Nob End, but this design was rejected. The connection with Fletcher&#x27;s Canal near Clifton Aqueduct was made by a single lock long by wide, with a drop of .

Although the canal was originally designed to be a narrow canal with narrow locks for boats wide, in 1794 an agreement was reached with the Leeds and Liverpool Canal company to create a link near Red Moss near Horwich, so broad locks were built to accommodate the wide boats using that canal. This meant removing some of the narrow locks that had already been built. An extension to the original canal feeder was built at Weddell Brook in Bury, alongside the River Irwell. The route of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal was changed, however, and the planned link never materialised. The design changes to the canal were not completely without merit, since they allowed two narrowboats to use each lock simultaneously, saving passage time and water.

Much of the Bury arm of the canal runs alongside the River Irwell through the Irwell Valley, and eventually required the construction of huge retaining walls to prevent the canal bank from sliding down the hill. Similar strengthening, although on a smaller scale, was required on the Bolton arm where it ran alongside the River Croal. Through these sections the towpath is normally on the side of the canal closest to the river.
Six aqueducts were required to allow the canal to cross the River Irwell, the River Tonge and four roads. On the Bolton arm these were Hall Lane Aqueduct, Fogg&#x27;s Aqueduct and the larger Damside Aqueduct, all of which have since been demolished. Hall Lane Aqueduct was damaged by mining subsidence and replaced in 1884–1885. It was demolished in 1950. The Salford arm flowed over Prestolee Aqueduct, then Clifton Aqueduct, and finally the smaller Lumn&#x27;s Lane Aqueduct (since demolished).

Many bridges were also constructed, along the length of the canal. Most were of small design allowing access to farmland, although many are wide enough for a horse and cart. In places where the canal crossed important thoroughfares, such as Water Street in Radcliffe, Radcliffe Road in Darcy Lever and Agecroft Road in Pendlebury, larger bridges were constructed.

Cranes were used along the many wharfs on the canal to offload cargo. One of these, a steam crane at Mount Sion, still exists (albeit in poor condition). At Bury Wharf a traversing steam crane positioned between the two arms of the terminus would offload cargo to be loaded into waiting lorries and a similar system was used at Radcliffe Wharf.

=== Costs ===
In 1795 costs of construction were detailed as follows:

The total cost of construction was £127,700.

== Breaches ==

The canal has suffered several major breaches throughout its history. As early as 1799 a flood carried away large sections of the lower banks, and on 15 October 1853 two boats were swept through a breach near the bottom of Nob End Locks (no injuries were reported). Three breaches were reported from 1878 to 1879, in Little Lever and Darcy Lever, the latter near Burnden Chemical Works. Subsidence, caused by mining activity, prompted a breach near Agecroft in 1881. As a result of such incidents, from 1881 to 1888 engineer Edwin Muir was employed to reduce the subsidence caused by mining activity. Similar work was undertaken throughout the 1920s. Maps from the 1880s show that by then, to safeguard against further subsidence, the canal company had purchased areas of coal beneath the canal. In 1884 the canal&#x27;s owners, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, successfully sued colliery owners Knowles &amp; Sons for losses incurred from damage caused by subsidence. Following this judgement, the railway company settled out of court with other colliery owners. Constant repairs were made, particularly through Pendleton, where the embankment was periodically raised. Some bridges were lifted far above their original supports, while others sank as low as above head height.

One of the most serious breaches occurred on 6 July 1936 near Nob End, close to the junction of the canal&#x27;s three arms, reported by the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; the following day. It was never repaired and although the canal saw continued use between Ladyshore Colliery and Bury, it eventually closed in 1961.

== Current status ==

Almost 60% of the canal&#x27;s original length is no longer in water. Bury Wharf is now covered by an industrial estate. A car park has been built on top of the canal, near Daisyfield Viaduct, but from there on the towpath remains accessible. The canal, in water but overgrown with weeds, is culverted under Water Street in Radcliffe. It continues in water up to a dam at Ladyshore, following which the foundations of a demolished paper mill, built in 1956, may be found.

The 1936 breach was never repaired and presents a significant gap in the canal&#x27;s route. On the Salford arm, although in good condition, the top three locks at Prestolee are derelict; the bottom three have been removed. The canal is in water from the bottom of the lock flight through to Ringley Locks. Ringley Bridge is infilled, as is the canal through Ringley Village and Giants Seat Locks. Kilcoby Bridge is missing and from there the canal is inaccessible until it reaches the M60 motorway. Overgrown, Rhodes Lock is still in reasonable condition. One or more electricity pylons straddle the infilled canal between Rhodes Lock and the motorway, which has been built over the line of the canal. A sludge lagoon built during the motorway&#x27;s construction blocks a short section toward Clifton Aqueduct. The canal does not take water again until beyond Clifton Aqueduct, where a short length exists between the former Pilkington factory and the Enersys factory. Lumn&#x27;s Lane Aqueduct is missing but the canal is in water between there and Holland Street. Beyond this point the canal is infilled and in parts built over, especially through Pendleton. Its junction with the River Irwell in Salford has recently been restored and made navigable.

The Bolton arm of the canal is interrupted by the absence of Hall Lane Aqueduct at Little Lever, which was demolished in 1950 to make way for the widening of Hall Lane. In Darcy Lever, Damside Aqueduct, which crossed Radcliffe Road and the Tonge River, is also missing, having been demolished in June 1965. The route of St Peter&#x27;s Way has almost entirely destroyed a significant section of the canal as it heads into the centre of Bolton and Church Wharf no longer exists. The last section of the Bolton arm of the canal still in water is currently used for fishing.

The entire route of the canal is protected from any adverse development that would prevent its restoration, having been included in the unitary development plans of Salford City Council, Bolton Council and Bury Council.

== Restoration ==

To help secure the canal&#x27;s future, in 1987 the Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal Society was formed to protect the canal and campaign for restoration. On 21 October 2005 British Waterways announced funding from European Objective Two Funding, the Northwest Regional Development Agency (NWDA) and Salford City Council for a restoration scheme at the newly named Middlewood Locks in Salford, which began in September 2006. Restoration was halted briefly by the discovery of what was initially thought to be a Second World War bomb but which proved to be a wartime American mortar with no explosive content. Pilings for the tunnel under the Manchester to Preston Line were completed in 2008. The missing Irwell towpath bridge, known as Bloody Bridge, which once crossed the canal&#x27;s entrance, was replaced with an arched timber structure incorporating elements of the old lock 1. Much of the canal&#x27;s existing masonry has been re-used and, where possible, the original washwalls were grouted and pointed. The original river locks 1 and 2 were replaced by a single deep lock.

Completion was scheduled for the end of July 2008 and marked with an opening ceremony on 19 September that year, during which the new Margaret Fletcher tunnel under the Manchester Inner Ring Road was formally named. Full restoration of the canal could create up to 6,000 jobs and add an annual £6 million to the local economy. The total cost is estimated at £60 million. The next planned major restoration may be along Salford Crescent.

Local volunteers under the guidance of the Manchester Bolton and Bury Canal Society have for years worked on sections of the canal, removing overgrowth and tidying up its general appearance. A new pedestrian footbridge, designed by artist Liam Curtin, was opened at Nob End Locks in April 2013. Made entirely out of scaled-up pieces of Meccano, it was built by society volunteers and other members of the public at a cost of about £90,000. Toward the end of 2015, work began to excavate the buried locks of the Nob End flight, exposing the six locks. Infill beneath the first bridge on the canal&#x27;s Bolton arm was also excavated, exposing the towpath for the first time in decades.

<text>The Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation (S&amp;SY) is a system of navigable inland waterways (canals and canalised rivers) in South Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, England.

Chiefly based on the River Don, it runs for a length of and has 27 locks. It connects Sheffield, Rotherham, and Doncaster with the River Trent at Keadby and (via the New Junction Canal) the Aire and Calder Navigation.

The system consisted of five parts, four of which are still open to navigation today:-
* The River Don Navigation
* The Sheffield Canal (effectively abandoned in the early 1970s but revitalised since the 1990s)
* The Stainforth and Keadby Canal
* The New Junction Canal
* The Dearne and Dove Canal (closed 1961)

==History==
The River Don is known to have been navigable up to Doncaster as early as 1343, when a commission looked at the problems caused by bridges and weirs. It underwent major changes in the 1620s, when Cornelius Vermuyden closed the channel which crossed Hatfield Chase to reach the River Trent at Adlingfleet, and diverted all of the water northwards to the River Aire. Following flooding and riots, a new outlet was cut from Newbridge to Goole, which was known as the Dutch River. Serious thought was given to improving the river from 1691, but disagreements between groups from Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield prevented progress. Finally, the Sheffield Cutlers obtained an act of Parliament, the River Dun Navigation Act 1725 (12 Geo. 1. c. 38) in 1726 to improve the river up to Tinsley. Doncaster Corporation then obtained an act in 1727, the River Dun Navigation Act 1726 (13 Geo. 1. c. 20) to authorise improvements below Doncaster.

The Dutch River was difficult to navigate, and in 1793, the Stainforth and Keadby Canal was authorised, to provide a link from the Don at Stainforth to the Trent at Keadby. Although notionally independent, it was effectively under the control of the Don Navigation when it opened, probably in 1802. The Dearne and Dove Canal was also authorised in 1793, from Swinton to Barnsley, and was again under Don Navigation control, since most of the shareholders were also shareholders in the Don. A canal from Tinsley into Sheffield was delayed for years by opposition from the Don Navigation, but was authorised in 1815 and opened in 1819.

By the 1840s, there were a number of proposals to build railways in the region, and the River Don Navigation Company acted to ensure they would remain in business. An attempted takeover of the Barnsley Canal in 1845 was not concluded, but gave them some bargaining power while it appeared likely. They bought out the Dearne and Dove Canal in 1846, and acquired the Sheffield Canal from the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway in 1848, which, as the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway, a predecessor and constituent company, had bought it in 1846. After protracted negotiations, they absorbed the Stainforth and Keadby Canal in 1849. They then amalgamated with the South Yorkshire, Doncaster and Goole Railway in 1850, to become the South Yorkshire Railway and River Dun Company. This in turn was leased to the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway for 999 years in 1864. By the 1880s, there was dissatisfaction among the users that the rates for traffic were higher than on the railways, and the canals were failing to modernise, as steam boats were banned, despite them having been in use for 50 years on the neighbouring Aire and Calder Navigation.

===Formation===
With the Manchester Ship Canal under construction, and other large canals being proposed, a committee was formed to investigate a new canal from Sheffield to the sea. T &amp; C Hawksley, assisted by James Abernethy, were asked to report on whether a canal from Sheffield suitable for medium-sized coasters could be built, to the Ouse, the Trent or the Humber. Their report, presented in October 1888, suggested that the existing locks on the route from Sheffield to Keadby were inadequate, but that the waterway could be upgraded to take 300- to 500-ton boats by building new locks alongside the old, without disrupting traffic. The estimated cost of this work, which included a new canal from Tinsley to Sheffield, but did not include buying the canals from the railway company, was put at £1 million. The Sheffield and South Yorkshire Canal Company Limited was formed in November 1888, with a capital of £30,000, to promote this new venture and obtain the necessary act of Parliament.
The new company obtained an act of Parliament, the (52 &amp; 53 Vict. c. cxc) on 26 August 1889, creating the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company, which was authorised to raise £1.5 million and to purchase the four canals either by negotiation, or by compulsory purchase if after nine months negotiations with the railway company had failed to reach an agreement. They could also improve the canals they bought, or build new ones, and could also act as inland carriers. The intent was to rebuild the Don and the Stainforth and Keadby routes to allow 300- or 400-ton barges to be used, and to develop coal-handling facilities at Keadby so that it would rival Goole on the Aire and Calder Navigation. In addition, the Dearne and Dove Canal would be dredged, so that compartment boats, like those on the Aire and Calder, could be used for the transport of coal.

The railway company was unwilling to sell, and did nothing until the initial nine-month period had passed. When a notice was served under the terms of the Act, which required them to sell the canals, they attempted to obstruct the new company by taking legal action against them. In 1891, the courts found in favour of the canal company, but negotiations dragged on. Meanwhile, negotiations had also taken place with the Aire and Calder, and an agreement had been reached to connect the two systems together by a canal, so that the improved Don could use Goole for the export of coal, rather than having to develop Keadby. By 1893, agreement had been reached as to what the railway company was selling, and a price of £1.14 million had been fixed, of which £600,000 was to be paid in cash. The rest could be paid in shares in the new company, which would give the railway places on the board unless the canal company bought all of the shares back. This was enshrined in a new act of Parliament obtained on 31 July 1893, but the clause about railway representation meant that the Aire and Calder declined to purchase any shares, and the company struggled to raise the capital.

The new company finally took over the four canals on 1 March 1895. It had only succeeded in raising £625,000, which was less than the purchase price of the canals. The railway company therefore nominated half of the ten directors, and there was no capital to fund the ambitious plans for the modernisation of the system, although some further developments took place.

===Development===
While the company had hoped to have £1 million to fund improvements, there was no working capital, and the enlargement of the locks to take 300- or 500-ton barges did not take place. The largest boats that could be accommodated were 110-ton vessels, although some of the locks were lengthened to take compartment boats. The Dearne and Dove Canal was regularly affected by subsidence, causing a drain on limited resources. In 1906, the Worsbrough branch ceased to be navigable, and became just a water feeder, and in 1909, the company effectively conceded defeat, by allowing coal to be mined under the canal. The Elsacar Branch closed in 1928, and most of the rest of the canal was closed in 1934, although formal closure did not take place until 1961.

Despite the lack of capital, the new company somehow managed to finance improvements to Sheffield Basin, including a four-storey warehouse which straddled part of the basin. Banks were raised and the canals were dredged, and for the first and only time, tonnage carried exceeded one million tons in 1896. They were also faced with the prospect of funding their half of the New Junction Canal, to provide the connection with the Aire and Calder Navigation. This was achieved by creating £150,000 of debenture stock and by mortgages. The final cost of the new canal when it was opened on 2 January 1905 had been £300,000 shared between the two companies. Some straightening of the navigation near Doncaster had been carried out, but they noted that more would be required at Sprotborough and Doncaster to make full use of compartment boats. Between 1905 and 1913, traffic rose from 835,982 tons to 961,774 tons, despite the fact that the system was antiquated and made little use of motor barges until after the First World War. West Riding County Council, who reported on its state in 1907 as part of the Royal Commission on Canals, blamed the inadequacies on the fact that the navigation was virtually controlled by the Great Central Railway. Doncaster lock was extended in 1909 and 1910, and improvements were made at Doncaster, Rotherham and Tinsley, but trade declined significantly with the onset of the First World War, as many of the steam trawlers which had previously used coal from the waterway were requisitioned by the Admiralty, and were fuelled elsewhere.

As the war drew towards its end, the Corporation of Sheffield pushed for major improvements to the system. While they thought that the waterway should be nationalised, they were in principle willing to part-fund improvements providing control by the railway company was ended. They commissioned Sir John Wolfe-Barry, Lyster and Partners to produce a report in 1919, and from the options suggested, chose to promote one of them. This involved increasing the depth of the waterway from Tinsley to Keadby to , making the channel wider and straighter, rebuilding the bridges to give more room through them, and replacing the locks with eighteen new ones, each . They were to be fitted with multiple gates, and be sized for 300-ton craft or four 110-ton barges. The estimated cost for these improvements was £1,483,426, but the economic circumstances of the time meant that the government was not prepared to support the scheme, and whereas the neighbouring Corporation of Nottingham funded improvements to the River Trent without government support, Sheffield were not prepared to do the same for the Don. There were also proposals for a ship canal from Doncaster to Trent Falls at the same time.

===Nationalisation===
In 1948 the company was nationalised and became a part of British Waterways. By the 1960s traffic was dwindling and the official head of the main line of the navigation became the new steelworks at Aldwarke, below Rotherham. Repeated proposals were made in the 1960s and 1970s to upgrade the system to allow larger vessels as far as Rotherham. Go-ahead was finally given in the early 1980s: the channel was deepened to 8 feet and the locks were rebuilt to take 700-ton vessels. A new wharf and freight terminal were built in Rotherham utilising the disused riverside bus depot as warehousing; various other facilities on the navigation below Rotherham were upgraded. The improvements were opened in 1983. Although these have received traffic sporadically since (and are still used in a limited fashion today), the upgrade was not the success that was hoped.

By the 1970s, boats rarely ventured above Rotherham. The effort made in the 1980s to attract traffic to the waterway below Rotherham did not extend to the stretch above the town: the locks remained suitable only for much smaller barges. Over time parts of the Sheffield Canal gradually slid towards dereliction through lack of use. In 1990 there was a concerted effort by Sheffield City Council and British Waterways to revitalise the waterway, which brought traffic back to a redeveloped Sheffield Basin (now focussed on leisure and commercial activities and renamed Victoria Quays).

Today the system is open to navigation throughout the main line, the Stainforth and Keadby and New Junction canals, and is mostly used for leisure boating. Some commercial carrying does take place from the quarry at Cadeby and the wharves at Rotherham and Doncaster; plus there is an active commercial barge-yard at Swinton and leisure boatyard and boatbuilder at Sheffield. In 2008–09 the system carried 290,000 tonnes of freight, of which 266,100 tonnes were limestone from Cadeby.

The Rother Link is a scheme that would see the River Rother upgraded to navigable status from Rotherham as far as Killamarsh, where a short canal would link to the Chesterfield Canal to complete a leisure cruising circuit. A canal restoration group is also seeking the re-opening of the Dearne and Dove Canal, has performed some restoration work at Elsecar and commissioned an engineer&#x27;s report into reopening.

<doc id="151903" wikidata="Q216140" url="?curid=151903" title="Stanley Matthews">
<text>Sir Stanley Matthews (1 February 1915 – 23 February 2000) was an English footballer who played as an outside right. Often regarded as one of the greatest players of the British game and one of the greatest players of all time, he is the only player to have been knighted while still playing football, as well as being the first winner of both the European Footballer of the Year and the Football Writers&#x27; Association Footballer of the Year awards. His nicknames included &quot;The Wizard of Dribble&quot; and &quot;The Magician&quot;.

Matthews kept fit enough to play at the top level until he was 50. He was also the oldest player to play in England&#x27;s top football division (50 years and 5 days) and the oldest to represent the country (42 years and 104 days). He was an inaugural inductee to the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002 to honour his contribution to the English game.

Matthews spent 19 years with Stoke City, playing for the Potters from 1932 to 1947 and again from 1961 to 1965. He helped Stoke to the Second Division title in 1932–33 and 1962–63. Between his two spells at Stoke, he spent 14 years with Blackpool, where, after being on the losing side in the 1948 and 1951 FA Cup finals, he helped Blackpool to win the cup with a formidable personal performance in the &quot;Matthews final&quot; of 1953. In 1956, he was named the winner of the inaugural Ballon d&#x27;Or, a prize given to the best European footballer each year. Between 1934 and 1957, he won 54 caps for England, playing in the FIFA World Cup in 1950 and 1954, and winning nine British Home Championship titles.

Following an unsuccessful stint as Port Vale&#x27;s general manager between 1965 and 1968, he travelled around the world, coaching enthusiastic amateurs. His experiences included coaching in South Africa, where despite the harsh apartheid laws of the time he established an all-black team in 1975 in Soweto known as &quot;Stan&#x27;s Men&quot;.

==Family and early life==

Stanley Matthews was born on 1 February 1915 in a terraced house in Seymour Street, Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. He was the third of four sons born to Jack Matthews, a local boxer known as the &quot;Fighting Barber of Hanley&quot;. In the summer of 1921, Jack Matthews took six-year-old Stanley to the Victoria Ground, home of the local club Stoke City, for an open race for boys under the age of 14, with a staggered start according to age. His father placed a bet on his son winning, and he did. Matthews attended Hanley&#x27;s Wellington Road School and later described himself as &quot;in many respects a model pupil&quot;. He also said the kickabout games the children played helped to improve his dribbling and prepared the children for future life by giving them &quot;a focus, a purpose, discipline, and in many respects an escape&quot;. At home he also spent &quot;countless hours&quot; practising dribbling around kitchen chairs he placed in his backyard.

Though he would later become indelibly associated with Stoke City, Matthews grew up supporting that club&#x27;s local rivals Port Vale. His father wanted him to follow in his footsteps and become a boxer, but Stanley decided at the age of 13 that he wanted to be a footballer. After a rigorous training session that made Matthews vomit, his mother, Elizabeth, stood firm and made Jack realise that his son, who had one more year at school, should follow his passion for football. His father conceded that should he be picked for England Schoolboys then he could continue his footballing career; around this time his school football master picked Matthews as an outside-right, rather than as his then-preferred position of centre-half. Matthews played for England Schoolboys against Wales in 1929, in front of around 20,000 spectators at Dean Court, Bournemouth.

==Playing career==

===Stoke City===
Wolverhampton Wanderers, Birmingham City, Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion were all rumoured to be interested in Matthews in the wake of his appearance for England Schoolboys. The Stoke City manager Tom Mather persuaded Matthews&#x27; father to allow Stanley to join his club&#x27;s staff as an office boy on his 15th birthday for pay of £1-a-week. Matthews played for Stoke&#x27;s reserve team during the 1930–31 season, coming up first against Burnley. After the game, his father gave his usual realist assessment: &quot;I&#x27;ve seen you play better and I&#x27;ve seen you play worse&quot;.

Matthews played 22 reserve games in 1931–32, shunning the social scene to focus on improving his game. In one of these games, against Manchester City, he attempted to run at the left-back and take him on with a deft swerve as the defender committed himself to a challenge, rather than follow the accepted wisdom of the day which was first to wait for the defender to run at the attacker – his new technique &quot;worked a treat&quot;. The national press were already predicting a bright future for the teenager, and though he could have then joined any club in the country, he signed as a professional with Stoke on his 17th birthday. Paid the maximum wage of £5-a-week (£3 in the summer break), he was on the same wage as seasoned professionals before he even kicked a ball. Despite this, his father insisted that Matthews save this money and only spend any winning bonus money he earned. He made his first-team debut against Bury at Gigg Lane on 19 March 1932; the &quot;Potters&quot; won the game 1–0 and Matthews learned how physical and dirty opponents could be – and get away with it.

After spending the 1932–33 pre-season training intensely by himself (as opposed to playing golf with his teammates), Mather selected Matthews in 15 games, enough to earn him in a winners medal after Stoke were crowned Second Division champions, one point ahead of Tottenham Hotspur. On 4 March 1933 he scored his first senior goal in a 3–1 win over local rivals Port Vale at The Old Recreation Ground.

He played 29 First Division games in 1933–34, as Stoke secured their top-flight status with a 12th-place finish. Matthews added a Staffordshire Senior Cup winners&#x27; medal in 1934. He continued to progress in the 1934–35 campaign and was selected by The Football League for an Inter-League game with the Irish League at The Oval, which finished 6–1 to the English. His England debut followed, and so did a further game for the Football League against the Scottish League. Stoke finished the season in 10th place.

In 1935–36 Matthews continued to improve, adding the double body swerve technique to his increasing arsenal of tricks. Largely out of the international picture, he put in 45 games for the &quot;Potters&quot; as Stoke finished fourth under Bob McGrory – the club&#x27;s best finish. He played 42 games in 1936–37, including the club&#x27;s record 10–3 win over West Brom at the Victoria Ground. At the end of the season, he was paid a loyalty bonus of £650, though the Stoke board initially insisted he was only due £500 as he had spent his first two years at the club as an amateur – this attitude left a sour taste in Matthews&#x27; mouth.

Stoke slipped down the league in an extremely tight 1937–38 season, and, annoyed by rumours circulating the city of resentment in the dressing room against him for his England success, Matthews requested a transfer in February; his request was denied. His request became public knowledge, and, disturbed by the attention and harassment he was receiving from Stoke supporters urging him to stay, Matthews decided to take a few days off from the club to relax in Blackpool. Finding no peace there either, Stoke chairman Albert Booth told Matthews he would not be allowed to leave the club, and 3,000 City supporters organised a meeting to make their feelings known – they too demanded that he stay. Touched by their strength of feeling and worn out by the attention he was receiving, Matthews agreed to stay. Despite playing regularly for the national side, Matthews put in 38 games for Stoke in 1938–39, helping them to a seventh-place finish – there would not be another full season of Football League action until 1946.

===Wartime career===
The war cost Matthews his professional career from the age of 24 to the age of 30. He instead joined the Royal Air Force and was based just outside Blackpool, with Ivor Powell his NCO. He rose to the rank of corporal, though he admitted to being one of the most lenient and easy-going NCOs in the forces. He played 69 Wartime League and Cup games for Stoke and also made 87 guest appearances for Blackpool. In addition to these, he also played a handful of games for Scottish sides Airdrieonians, Morton and Rangers, where he collected a Charity Cup winners&#x27; medal, and also played for an unofficial Scotland XI, Arsenal against Millwall on 13 January 1945 plus FC Dynamo Moscow on 21 November 1945 in extremely thick fog. He also played 29 times for England, though no caps were awarded as these were unofficial games.

One of the last games of the period was an FA Cup Sixth Round second-leg tie clash between Stoke and Bolton Wanderers; the match ended in tragedy in what would be known as the Burnden Park disaster – 33 people died and 500 were injured. Matthews sent £30 to the disaster fund and could not bring himself to train for several days afterwards. Matthews&#x27; father died in 1945. From his deathbed, he made his son promise him two things: to look after his mother and to win an FA Cup final.

===Post-war resumption with Stoke===
The regular Football League returned in time for the 1946–47 season, during which Matthews played 23 league games and contributed to 30 of the club&#x27;s 41 league goals. Stoke matched their record finish of fourth in the league, finishing just two points shy of champions Liverpool after losing to Sheffield United on the final day of the season. However, in February, Matthews was returning from a knee injury when manager McGrory told him he was not in the first XI for the game against Arsenal; the press reported this as a bust-up. Relations between McGrory, the Stoke City board, and Matthews had indeed always been sour – though once again a story that the players sided against Matthews were untrue. Recalled against Brentford, only after the game did he find out that this was only because he was a last-minute replacement for an injured Bert Mitchell. Matthews put in a second transfer request, which the Stoke board eventually accepted. He selected Blackpool as his next club as he still lived in the area following his service in the RAF; the Stoke board sanctioned the move on the condition that the deal was to remain a secret until the end of the season, not to disrupt the club&#x27;s title bid. The secret was revealed in a matter of hours, as an unknown person informed the press.

===Blackpool===

On 10 May 1947, immediately after a Great Britain versus Rest of Europe match in Glasgow (Britain won 6–1), he made the move for £11,500, at the age of 32. The match raised £30,000 for the four Home Nations Football Associations, and since the eleven British players received £14 each, Matthews questioned where exactly this money ended up – he doubted that much of it ended up as funding for grass-roots football.

:&quot;You&#x27;re 32, do you think you can make it for another couple of years?&quot; – Blackpool manager Joe Smith in 1947.

Smith told Matthews, &quot;There are no shackles here ... express yourself ... play your own game and whatever you do on the pitch, do it in the knowledge that you have my full support.&quot; He assembled a talented frontline in Matthews, Stan Mortensen, Jimmy McIntosh, and Alex Munro; with an emphasis on entertaining football. The Seasiders finished in ninth place and reached the 1948 FA Cup final. On 23 April 1948, the eve of the final, Matthews won the inaugural Football Writers&#x27; Association Footballer of the Year award. Despite taking the lead twice in the match, Blackpool lost out 4–2 to Matt Busby&#x27;s Manchester United in the final, with Matthews assisting Mortensen for Blackpool&#x27;s second.

Injury limited him to only 28 appearances in 1948–49, as Blackpool struggled to a 16th-place finish. He spent the summer touring theatres in a variety act with his brother Ronnie, though he was troubled by an ankle injury he picked up in a charity game. Blackpool finished seventh in 1949–50, and though they were never title contenders, vast crowds still turned out home and away to witness the entertaining football they displayed. At this time he received the maximum wage allowed for a professional player – £12 a week.

In 1950–51 Blackpool stormed to a third-place finish, and Matthews played 44 games in league and cup. He cited his highlights of the season as a 2–0 win at Sunderland, a 4–4 draw at Arsenal, and a 4–2 defeat at Newcastle United. They also reached the 1951 FA Cup final, where they were favourites to beat opponents Newcastle; However, Matthews ended up with a second runners-up medal thanks to a brace from Jackie Milburn.

After picking up an ankle injury in November, he missed most of the 1951–52 campaign and was forced to spend most of his time instead working at the hotel he and his wife ran. It was during this time that he cut red meat from his diet to begin his new near-vegetarian diet. At this point new Stoke manager Frank Taylor enquired as to whether he might bring Matthews back to the club; all parties agreed to the idea in principle until Joe Smith put his foot down to ensure he stayed, with an inspirational speech he promised Matthews that an FA Cup winners medal was still possible, telling him that &quot;a lot of people think I&#x27;m mad, but even though you&#x27;re 37, I believe your best football is still to come.&quot;

Despite spending some three months of the season out with a muscle injury, the 1952–53 campaign proved Smith&#x27;s words to be accurate, as a 38-year-old Matthews won an FA Cup winners medal in a match which was, despite Mortensen&#x27;s hat-trick, subsequently dubbed the &quot;Matthews final&quot;. Bolton were leading 3–1 with 35 minutes to go, but Matthews had &quot;the game of his life&quot; in &quot;the greatest ever FA Cup final&quot; and spurred his team on to a last gasp 4–3 victory. He always credited the team and especially Mortensen for the victory and never accepted the nickname of the &quot;Matthews final&quot;.

He helped the Tangerines to record a sixth-place finish in 1953–54, though hopes of retaining their FA Cup title were ended with a defeat to Port Vale at Vale Park in the Fifth Round. Matthews missed just eight league games in 1954–55, though journalists were keen to write him off with every occasional off-performance and missed game – &quot;it was all balderdash&quot;, he replied. Despite his age, and more pertinently the media&#x27;s constant references to his age, Arsenal manager Tom Whittaker tried, unsuccessfully, to lure Matthews to Highbury with a lucrative, if somewhat illegal approach.

As Smith began to establish a new side with talents such as Jackie Mudie and Jimmy Armfield, Blackpool posted a second-place finish in 1955–56. However, they ended up some 11 points behind champions Manchester United. Matthews believed that the performance he gave in a 3–1 win over Arsenal on the season&#x27;s opening day was the finest he ever gave. At the end of the campaign, Matthews was named the winner of the inaugural European Footballer of the Year award, having narrowly defeated Alfredo Di Stéfano 47 to 44 in the poll.

Remaining a key first-team member in 1956–57, injury restricted him to 25 league appearances, though Blackpool claimed a creditable fourth-place finish. Matthews scored his 18th and final goal for Blackpool in a 4–1 league victory over Tottenham Hotspur at Bloomfield Road on 3 September 1956. Blackpool finished seventh in 1957–58, after which Joe Smith left the club.

In 1957, at the age of 42, Matthews travelled to Ghana to play some exhibition games for Ghanaian club Hearts of Oak. On 26 May 1957, Matthews made his &#x27;debut&#x27; for Hearts of Oak at Accra Sports Stadium against Asante Kotoko in front of 20,000 spectators. Similar attendances were recorded for Matthews&#x27; next two games against Sekondi Hasaacas and Kumasi Cornerstone. As a result of Matthews&#x27; visit to the country, he was installed as a &quot;soccerhene&quot; (soccer chief). Matthews&#x27; visit to Ghana also convinced Ghana&#x27;s first prime minister Kwame Nkrumah that sport could help the development of Ghanaian football, as well as push the ideals of Pan-Africanism. Ghana won their first Africa Cup of Nations six years later in 1963 under the management of Charles Gyamfi.

Back in England, Smith&#x27;s replacement was Ron Suart, who wanted Matthews to stay out wide and did not value his contribution as Smith did. Suart limited Matthews to 19 league appearances in 1958–59. Matthews was then used just 15 times in 1959–60, as Suart signed Arthur Kaye to take his place. Local lad Steve Hill also vied for the outside-right position. He enjoyed more games in 1960–61, playing 27 league games as the club narrowly avoided relegation by the odd point.

In 1961, during the English off-season, he played abroad in the Eastern Canada Professional Soccer League with Toronto City, appearing in 14 matches. He returned for the 1965 season, playing in another five matches for Toronto City.

He started the 1961–62 season behind Hill in the pecking order, only getting his place back in time for a 4–0 win over Chelsea after Hill picked up an injury. He made his 440th and final appearance in a Blackpool shirt in a 3–0 defeat at Arsenal on 7 October 1961. It was a fitting final bow as he always enjoyed playing against Arsenal. He had &quot;so many wonderful memories&quot; at Highbury. With former teammate and close friend Jackie Mudie at Stoke City, and with Tony Waddington keen to welcome Matthews back to the Victoria Ground, his return to his home-town club was sealed. However, Matthews was not impressed when the Blackpool board demanded a £3,500 transfer fee, with one director being so bold as to tell him &quot;You forget. As a player, we made you.&quot; Having kept secret from Stoke a niggling knee injury Matthews had been carrying, Blackpool got their £3,500 for the player.

===Return to Stoke===

At Stoke, Matthews played Second Division football for the first time in 28 years. Despite Stoke being strapped for cash, Tony Waddington gave him a two-year contract at £50-a-week – this was double the wages he received at Blackpool. The signing was broadcast live on &quot;Sportsview&quot;, as Waddington whispered in his ear &quot;Welcome home, Stan. For years this club has been going nowhere. Now we&#x27;re on our way&quot;. Waddington delayed his return debut until 24 October 1961, when Stoke played Huddersfield Town at the Victoria Ground, the attendance was 35,974 – more than treble the previous home game – and Matthews set up one of City&#x27;s goals in a 3–0 win. He went on to score three goals in 21 games in the rest of the 1961–62 campaign.

Waddington signed hardman Eddie Clamp to protect Matthews in the 1962–63 season, and the two would also become close friends off the pitch. Along with veteran teammates Jackie Mudie, Jimmy O&#x27;Neill, Eddie Stuart, Don Ratcliffe, Dennis Viollet, and Jimmy McIlroy, Stoke had the oldest team in the Football League. Matthews scored his only goal of the season in the final home game of the campaign, as Luton Town were beaten 2–0, the result ensured Stoke gained promotion to the top flight. Stoke went up as Second Division champions. Matthews was voted FWA Footballer of the Year for the second time in his career, 15 years after he was made the award&#x27;s inaugural winner. When he was 48, he picked up this award, and he became the oldest award winner by a wide margin, which remains so more than half a century later.

After picking up an injury, he missed January onwards of the 1963–64 campaign and thereby missed the 1964 Football League Cup final defeat to Leicester City, playing in just nine of Stoke&#x27;s 42 First Division matches that season. Discovering that niggling injuries, which would have cost him one day out of action, now required more than two weeks&#x27; worth of rest to recover from, Matthews decided to retire after one more season, taking his playing career into his 50th year.

He spent the 1964–65 season playing for the reserve side. On 1 January 1965, he became the only footballer to ever be knighted (for services to football) whilst still an active professional player. However, he never thought himself worthy of such an honour. His only first-team appearance of the season was also the last Football League game of his career; it came on 6 February 1965, just after his 50th birthday, and was necessitated by injuries to both Peter Dobing and Gerry Bridgwood. The opponents that day were Fulham, and Stoke won the game 3–1. Though he felt he had retired too early and could have carried on playing for another two years, this brought an end to his 35-year professional career.

Stoke City arranged a testimonial match in honour of Matthews; it was much needed as he had spent most of his career constricted to the tight maximum wage that had been enforced upon the English game and only abolished a few years before his retirement. The game was played at the Victoria Ground on 28 April 1965. By that time, Matthews had decided to retire as a player, and the pre-match entertainment consisted of another match of two veteran teams featuring many legends of the game. Harry Johnston led out a team consisting of Bert Trautmann, Tim Ward, George Hardwick, Jimmy Hill, Neil Franklin, Don Revie, Stan Mortensen, Nat Lofthouse, Jimmy Hagan, Tom Finney and Frank Bowyer (reserve). Walley Barnes led out an opposing team consisting of Jimmy O&#x27;Neill, Jimmy Scoular, Danny Blanchflower, Jimmy Dickinson, Hughie Kelly, Bill McGarry, Jackie Mudie, Jackie Milburn, Jock Dodds, Ken Barnes, and Arthur Rowley (reserve).

In the main game itself, two teams of legends were formed, a Stan&#x27;s XI (consisting of Football League players) and an International XI (including Ferenc Puskás, Alfredo Di Stefano, Josef Masopust and Lev Yashin). The International side won 6–4, and Matthews was carried shoulder-high from the field at full time by Puskás and Yashin.

===England international career===
After playing for England Schoolboys, playing in a trial at Roker Park in front of the England selectors, and representing The Football League, Matthews was given his England debut at Ninian Park in 1934. Matthews scored the third goal as England beat the Welsh 4–0. His second game would be the infamous Battle of Highbury, where he set up Eric Brook for the first goal of a 3–2 win over world champions Italy. The Italians turned the match into a &quot;bloodbath&quot;, and it ended up as the most violent match that Matthews would ever be involved in.

His third cap came in a 3–0 over Germany at White Hart Lane on 4 December 1935, after Ralph Birkett was unable to play due to injury; Matthews was outplayed by his opposite number Reinhold Münzenberg in both attack and defence. Matthews was jeered by England supporters and condemned by the press.

He would have to wait until 17 April 1937 for another chance in an England shirt, when he was selected to play in front of 149,000 spectators against the auld enemy at Scotland&#x27;s Hampden Park. He was physically sick before the match, as he would be before any big game. The &quot;Hampden Roar&quot; a big factor; the Scots won 3–1 despite a good English performance. After another game against Wales, Matthews scored a hat-trick in a 5–4 win against Czechoslovakia.

In 1938 he played eight games for England, starting with defeat to a Scotland team containing a young Bill Shankly. He then travelled to Berlin for another encounter with Münzenberg, where pre-match he witnessed first hand the foreboding devotion the people showed the Führer when his motorcade drove past a café the England team were dining in. The game became infamous as The FA, themselves under instruction from the British government, informed the England team that they had to perform the Nazi salute as part of the strategy of appeasement. England won 6–3 with Matthews himself getting on the scoreboard having got the better of Münzenberg this time. The next game was a shock 2–1 defeat to Switzerland, which in turn was followed by a 4–2 win over France in Paris. Following the conclusion of this summer tour of the continent, Matthews scored in a 4–2 defeat to Wales in Cardiff, and then played in England&#x27;s 3–0 win over a Europe XI at Highbury, their 4–0 win over Norway in Newcastle, and their 7–0 win over Ireland at Old Trafford.

On 15 April 1939, he returned to a muddy Hampden Park with England to claim a 2–1 victory in front of 142,000 rain-soaked supporters; he set up Tommy Lawton for the winner with seconds to spare. That summer was the last time England would tour Europe before Hitler&#x27;s Nazis were defeated. The first game was against Italy, who gave the English a warm reception despite Benito Mussolini&#x27;s breast-beating and the bad blood of five years previous. Again the World Champions, the Italians managed to salvage a 2–2 draw at the San Siro after scoring with a clear handball; this time Matthews left the field with a chipped hip bone for his efforts. The next game was a 2–1 loss to Yugoslavia, with Matthews and captain Eddie Hapgood passengers in the game after picking up early injuries; this injury forced him to sit out the following encounter with Romania.

Following the war, his return for England came against Scotland on 12 April 1947 at Wembley, in a match which finished as a 1–1 draw. In the summer he took part in England&#x27;s tour of Switzerland and Portugal. Following a surprise defeat to the Swiss, England cantered to a 10–0 win over the Portuguese, with Matthews scoring the 10th. In September, he put in one of his finest performances in an England shirt as he set up all of England&#x27;s five goals in a 5–2 victory over Belgium.

In April 1948, he once again travelled with England to Hampden Park, helping his country to a 2–0 victory. However, after the match, he was the subject of an FA inquiry after he claimed tea and scones on his expenses (at the cost of sixpence). Regardless of this treatment by the FA, the next month he helped England record a 4–0 victory over Italy in Turin. Folklore said that he beat Alberto Eliani only to have the audacity to then pull a comb from his shorts pocket and comb his hair; the reality was that he used his hand to wipe his sweating brow in the beating Italian sun. However, the legend would follow him around the world in later life, and spectators in the crowd were convinced that they had witnessed it. Later in the year, he played in a goalless draw with Denmark, a 6–2 win over Northern Ireland, a 1–0 win over Wales, and a 6–0 triumph over Switzerland.

Manager Walter Winterbottom began to look for a more defensive winger, and so used Matthews just once in 1949 – a 3–1 defeat to Scotland in the British Home Championship. Only after impressing in an FA tour of Canada was he named as a last-minute inclusion in the England squad for the 1950 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. He did not play in the win over Chile or in the infamous defeat to the United States, but played just once, in the 1–0 defeat to Spain at the Maracanã Stadium. The preparation was not ideal as the FA did not take the competition seriously, and the hotel had &quot;unpalatable&quot; food and no training facilities.

After playing only in two further games, a 4–4 draw with a Europe XI and a 3–1 win over Northern Ireland, he found himself back on the international scene following his heroics in the 1953 FA Cup final. He was selected to play Hungary&#x27;s Golden Team on 25 November 1953, in a 6–3 defeat that became known as the &quot;Match of the Century&quot;. He blamed the FA and the selectors for the heavy loss, though he had great admiration for the Hungarians, particularly Ferenc Puskás.

He did not play in England&#x27;s 7–1 defeat to Hungary in Budapest in May 1954. However, he was in the squad for the 1954 FIFA World Cup in Switzerland. Matthews helped England to a 4–4 draw with Belgium, though was left out of a win over Switzerland before he returned to the first XI as England crashed out of the competition with a 4–2 defeat to Uruguay at the St. Jakob Stadium after mistakes from goalkeeper Gil Merrick. His third match of the year was a 2–0 win over Northern Ireland at Windsor Park in the 1954–55 British Home Championship, though on the pitch he did not gel well with Don Revie. Matthews then put in a superb performance in a 2–0 win over the Welsh before he helped England to record a 3–1 victory over World Champions West Germany, though only three of the Germans used at Wembley had been in the first XI in the World Cup final.

England beat Scotland 7–2 in April 1955, and this time, Matthews linked up much better with Revie and 40-year-old Matthews was largely credited for the outstanding margin of victory. In this game, Duncan Edwards was making his England debut; when Matthews made his, Edwards had not even been born. Matthews went on England&#x27;s unsuccessful tour of the continent in 1955, as the selectors erratic choices helped to ensure a 1–0 defeat to France, a 1–1 draw with Spain, and a 3–1 defeat to Portugal. Left out against Denmark, he was back in the team in October for a 1–1 draw with Wales.

Having been awarded the inaugural Ballon d&#x27;Or in 1956, that May he was recalled to the England front line for an encounter against Brazil in a crowded Wembley in what was the first friendly match played by both teams. England won the match 4–2, though the Brazilians would later become world champions in 1958. He then refused to take part in that summer&#x27;s European tour, having already committed himself to his second summer of coaching in South Africa. In his next international game, against Northern Ireland on 6 October 1956, aged 41 years and 248 days, he became the oldest England player ever to score an international goal.

He played three of England&#x27;s four qualification games for the 1958 FIFA World Cup: a 5–1 victory over the Republic of Ireland, and the 5–2 and 4–1 wins over Denmark. On 15 May 1957, Matthews became the oldest player ever to represent England, when at 42 years and 104 days old he turned out for the victory over the Danes in Copenhagen. Despite calls by the press for him to be included in the 1958 World Cup squad, this time the selectors did not bow to the pressure. Yet after 23 years, nobody would ever enjoy a longer career with the England team.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1956 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre.

He was one of many signatories in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; on 17 July 1958 opposing &quot;the policy of apartheid&quot; in international sport and defending &quot;the principle of racial equality which is embodied in the Declaration of the Olympic Games&quot;.

==Style of play==
Franz Beckenbauer said that the speed and skill Matthews possessed meant that &quot;almost no one in the game could stop him&quot;. John Charles noted that &quot;he was the best crosser I&#x27;ve ever seen – and he had to contend with the old heavy ball&quot;. Johnny Giles said that &quot;he had everything – good close control, great dribbling ability. He was lightning quick. He was also an intelligent player, who knew how to pass the ball&quot;. Despite his great talents, he rarely tackled opponents and was not adept at heading the ball or using his left foot.

An outside right, before 1937–38 he had scored 43 goals in four seasons, and full-backs began to mark him more tightly; because of this, he decided to drop deeper to collect the ball and aim to play pinpoint crosses as opposed to going for glory himself. Though he would never again score more than six goals in a season, this made him a more effective team player and a greater threat to the opposition.

His daughter Jean Gough told how Matthews would wear lead in his shoes walking to the ground so that &quot;when he put his football boots on, they felt like ballerina shoes.&quot; Having trained to a level of fitness few other players would reach, by the mid-1950s he was able to cut back on his intense training as his level of fitness was by then ingrained in his body. He never smoked; instead, he was very conscious of every item of food and drink he consumed, and he maintained a rigid daily training regime from childhood up until his old age. In an interview with the FA he said, &quot;I had some very good advice and started to eat more salads and fruit, and every Monday I had no food. Just one day, on a Monday, but I felt better.&quot; The only time he knowingly consumed alcohol was when drinking champagne out of the FA Cup in 1953.

In addition to his attention to detail in diet and fitness, he also afforded scrutiny to his kit. 1950–51 he struck a boot sponsorship deal with the Co-op, though he instead began wearing a more lightweight pair of boots he had discovered on show at the World Cup – at the time they were not available to buy in England. He would wear the customised boots until his retirement, though they were so delicate that he got through countless pairs every season.

An avid student of the game, in the 1950 FIFA World Cup Matthews stayed on to watch teams such as Brazil and Uruguay compete in the tournament after England&#x27;s elimination – the English FA, manager and media all returned home to, as Matthews said, &quot;bury their heads in the sand.&quot; Matthews regularly condemned the &quot;blazer brigade&quot; at the FA in his autobiography, slating them as &quot;conservative&quot; and stressing that many of them were Old Etonians; in his view they treated players and supporters poorly, demonstrated arrogance by ignoring competitions they did not control (the World Cup and European domestic competitions), and viewed innovations with excessive suspicion (for example the FA sanctioned only the use of floodlights in 1952 despite artificial lighting having been experimented with as far back as 1878, and for years insisted on using outdated kit such as heavy &quot;reinforced&quot; boots). Writing about the fact that the FA allocated only 12,000 of the 100,000 available tickets for the 1953 FA Cup final to Blackpool supporters, Matthews wrote: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t make my mind up whether they were dunderheads or simply didn&#x27;t care about the genuine supporters who were the lifeblood of the game&quot;.

He was never booked or sent off throughout his entire career, and teammate Jimmy Armfield noted that Matthews would never retaliate to the many extremely physical challenges opponents would often make to try and take him out of the game. Indeed, he ran the full gauntlet of emotions that all footballers run, but always retained a level head on the pitch, never losing his temper or allowing his emotions to affect his game.

==Coaching and management career==
Matthews was appointed general manager at Stoke&#x27;s rivals Port Vale in July 1965, alongside good friend Jackie Mudie; Matthews was unpaid, though was given expenses. The pair had a plan of bringing through talented schoolboys and selling one or two off every so often to improve the club&#x27;s bleak financial picture whilst at the same time advancing through the leagues; in his autobiography he said that what Dario Gradi later achieved at Crewe Alexandra is what he had in mind for the Vale. Matthews concentrated his search in North East England and Central Scotland, where he discovered talented striker Mick Cullerton, though overlooked a teenage Ray Kennedy.
Following Mudie&#x27;s resignation in May 1967, Handed complete managerial control, Matthews could not guide the club to success. Instead, Port Vale were fined £4,000 in February/March 1968 and expelled from the Football League for financial irregularities. He was forced to use his name to plead with the other Football League clubs to re-elect the Vale, which they duly did. He stood down as manager in May 1968 and, despite being owed £9,000 in salary and expenses, agreed to stay at Vale Park to continue his work with the youth team. A &quot;final settlement&quot; was reached in December 1970, and Matthews was given £3,300, with the other £7,000 he was owed to be written off. Player Roy Sproson later said that &quot;he [Matthews] trusted people who should never have been trusted and people took advantage of him. I am convinced a lot of people sponged off him and, all the while, the club were sliding.&quot; The experience &quot;left a sour taste&quot; in his mouth, and was enough to convince him never to try his hand as management in English football again.

Matthews gave up his summers every year between 1953 and 1978 to coach poor children in South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda and Tanzania. In South Africa in 1975, he ignored apartheid to form a team of black schoolboys in Soweto called &quot;Stan&#x27;s Men&quot;. The members of his team told him that it was their dream to play in Brazil, so Matthews organised a trip there; they were the first black team ever to tour outside of South Africa. He did not have the money to fund the trip himself, though used his connections (for the only time other than when he used them to save Port Vale in 1968) to arrange sponsorship from Coca-Cola and the &quot;Johannesburg Sunday Times&quot; newspaper. The South African authorities did not want to cause an international incident, so did not prevent Stan&#x27;s Men from getting on the plane to Rio de Janeiro, where they would meet legendary player Zico. On the way back from the trip, the Stan&#x27;s Men captain Gilbert Moiloa called Matthews &quot;black man with the white face&quot;. In a 2017 documentary film on his life, &quot;Matthews&quot;, the film crew traveled to Soweto to interview Stan&#x27;s Men about their memories with Matthews.

He played his final game of football for an England Veterans XI against a Brazil Veterans XI in Brazil in 1985 at the age of 70; the English lost 6–1 to the likes of Amarildo, Tostão, and Jairzinho. He damaged his cartilage during the match: &quot;a promising career cut tragically short&quot;, he wrote in his autobiography.

==Retirement and death==

Having toured the world coaching in Australia, the United States, Canada and especially in Africa, Matthews returned to Stoke-on-Trent with wife Mila in 1989. The couple moved to &quot;The Views&quot; in Penkhull, a listed building which was the birthplace of Sir Oliver Lodge. He later served as president of Stoke City and honorary vice-president of Blackpool

Matthews remained physically fit into his seventies and eighties. He undertook early-morning runs, had never smoked and was a vegetarian for years, fasting for one day a week. He suffered a heart attack in May 1997. He died in North Staffordshire Nuffield Hospital in Newcastle-under-Lyme on 23 February 2000, aged 85, after suffering a fall at his holiday home in Tenerife. Mila had died the previous year.

His death was announced on the radio just before starting an England v Argentina friendly match. He was cremated following a funeral service in Stoke on 3 March 2000. His funeral was attended by many of his fellow footballers, such as Bobby Charlton and Jack Charlton, Gordon Banks, Nat Lofthouse and Tom Finney. His ashes were buried beneath the centre circle of Stoke City&#x27;s Britannia Stadium, which he had officially opened in August 1997. After his death, more than 100,000 people lined the streets of Stoke-on-Trent to pay tribute.

After his death, dozens of footballing legends paid tribute to him, and his autobiography&#x27;s epilogue contains several quotations. Pelé said he was &quot;the man who taught us the way football should be played&quot;, and Brian Clough added that &quot;he was a true gentleman and we shall never see his like again&quot;. Former England goalkeeper Gordon Banks said: &quot;I don&#x27;t think anyone since had a name so synonymous with football in England&quot;, whilst World Cup winning German defender Berti Vogts commented that &quot;It is not just in England where his name is famous. All over the world he is regarded as a true football genius&quot;.

===Legacy===
Stanley Matthews was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1995. Matthews was made an inaugural inductee of the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002 in recognition of his talents. The International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics voted him the 11th greatest footballer of the 20th century. Matthews was placed 17th in &quot;World Soccer&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Players of the 20th Century&quot; list, published in 1999.

He was inducted into the Blackpool F.C. Hall of Fame at Bloomfield Road when it was officially opened by Jimmy Armfield in April 2006. Organised by the Blackpool Supporters Association, Blackpool fans around the world voted on their all-time heroes. Five players from each decade are inducted; Matthews is in the 1950s. The West Stand at Blackpool&#x27;s Bloomfield Road is named in his honour. He was also inducted into the Stoke-on-Trent Hall of Fame when it was opened in January 2011. There is a statue of Matthews outside Stoke City&#x27;s Britannia Stadium and another in the centre of Hanley. The dedication on the former reads: &quot;His name is symbolic of the beauty of the game, his fame timeless and international, his sportsmanship and modesty universally acclaimed. A magical player, of the people, for the people.&quot;

The Stanley Matthews Collection is held by the National Football Museum. In February 2010, the boots worn by Matthews in the 1953 FA Cup final were auctioned at Bonhams in Chester for £38,400 to an undisclosed buyer. Sierra Leonean football club Mighty Blackpool F.C., based in the capital city of Freetown, changed their name from Socro United in 1954 because of their admiration for Matthews. Ormiston Sir Stanley Matthews Academy is a secondary school in Blurton, Stoke-on-Trent, named after him.

In 2017 a documentary film was made about Matthews&#x27; life entitled &quot;Matthews&quot; with son Stanley Jr. as Executive Producer.

In November 1985 a British Rail Mark 3 carriage was named &quot;Sir Stanley Matthews&quot; by British Rail.

==Personal life==

On 19 August 1935 in Eaglesham, Scotland, Matthews married Betty Vallance, daughter of Stoke City trainer Jimmy, whom he first met on his 15th birthday in 1930 on his first day as office boy at the Victoria Ground. The couple had two children together: Jean (born 1 January 1939) and Stanley Jr (born 20 November 1945). Stanley Jr went on to become a tennis player under the tutelage of John Barrett. He became Wimbledon Boys&#x27; Champion in 1962 making him the last English player to do so until Henry Searle in 2023. He never translated his success into the senior game, though, and instead moved to the United States to run the Four Seasons Racquet Club in Wilton, Connecticut. Jean married Robert Gough, whom she had met at their tennis club. In 1965, Matthews became a grandfather after Jean gave birth to a son, Matthew Gough. She would have two other children — daughters Samantha and Amanda. Gough made Matthews a great-grandfather in 1999 when he and his wife had a son, Cameron. Matthews had six other great-grandchildren.

In 1967, while on a tour of Czechoslovakia with Port Vale, Matthews met 44-year-old Mila, the group&#x27;s interpreter. Matthews was still married to Betty, but as he was convinced he had found the true love of his life in Mila, he and Betty divorced. He and Mila spent the ensuing years living at various times in Malta (specifically Marsaxlokk), South Africa and Burlington, Ontario. They also travelled extensively as Matthews&#x27;s coaching jobs and guest appearances dictated. After Mila died on 5 May 1999 at the age of 76, according to Les Scott (who helped Matthews write his autobiography), Matthews &quot;was never the same person&quot;.

==Autobiography==
Matthews&#x27; autobiography, &quot;The Way It Was&quot;, was released by Headline in 2000. The book is dedicated to his wife Mila, who died the year before its publication. Matthews, then 84, collaborated with Les Scott, his friend of 10 years, in the writing of the book over an 18-month period on an almost daily basis. &quot;Stan, as he had been all his life, was an early riser&quot;, wrote Scott in the epilogue. &quot;Our collaborations were over by eleven in the morning and, without fail, took place in his den. He loved working on his book and, after I had left him, he would give the morning&#x27;s session more applied thought — more often than not ringing me at home to provide additional thoughts or anecdotes.&quot;

Matthews also wrote an earlier autobiography entitled &quot;Feet First&quot;. This was published by Ewen And Dale in 1948.

<doc id="151904" wikidata="Q769660" url="?curid=151904" title="Liskeard and Looe Union Canal">
<text>The Liskeard and Looe Union Canal was a broad canal between Liskeard and Looe in Cornwall, United Kingdom. It was almost long and had 24 locks, and it opened progressively from 1827. The engineer was Robert Coad.

Its primary purpose originally was the carriage of sea sand and lime to improve the acidic soil of agricultural lands, but when mineral deposits on Caradon Hill were exploited, it benefited considerably, carrying the mineral down to Looe Harbour. The trade increased so much that a railway—the Liskeard and Looe Railway—was built alongside its course by the Canal Company, and the canal itself gradually ceased to be navigable.

==General description==
The canal started from a point on the tidal East Looe River just below Terras Bridge, about a mile (about 1.5 km) above Looe bridge. When the railway branch line was built, a bridge over the canal was made, and this bridge can still be seen, showing the alignment of the canal at its lower termination.

The canal ran broadly north, following closely the course of the river itself, for a distance of , terminating at Moorswater, in the valley to the west of Liskeard. This involved a considerable climb, of over its length, and there were 24 locks. The canal ran on the east side of the River, except between a point below Plashford Bridge to near Landreast bridge, The present day railway branch line closely follows the route of the canal.

Moorswater was chosen as a feasible terminal because of its altitude—below Liskeard town—and proximity to the agricultural lands the canal was built to serve. Roads for onward transport were built, eastward to Liskeard itself and northward to Highwood.

There was a basin at Moorswater, located in the area near the present-day railway level crossing, close to the point where Old Road crosses under the A38 main road. A reservoir was built immediately north of the basin area.

It was designed for 20 tonne barges; water supply was from the upper reaches of the East Looe River and the Crylla.

When the railway line was built in 1860, the canal gradually fell into disrepair, and is shown as &quot;disused&quot; on 1882 Ordnance Survey maps, although the short southern section to Sandplace continued in use for several years

Priestley, published in 1831, described the canal:

The Liskeard and Looe Canal commences at Tarras Pill, and proceeds from thence in a northerly direction to the parish of Liskeard terminating at Moorswater, ] above the level of the sea. The distance which it passes over is five miles and seven furlongs, [9.5 km] and in its course there are twenty-five locks. ... There is a short branch of about a mile in length to Sand Place.

Priestley incorporates a number of inaccuracies into his description: he has taken the number of locks from the authorising act of Parliament; in fact there were twenty-four. There was a wharf at Sandplace (Sand Place) but it was immediately adjacent to the main line of the canal; Messenger points out that a quay was dug into the river bank at Sandplace to serve a kiln, and Priestley was misled into thinking that this was a branch of the canal; actually it was the main river. The vertical interval he quotes may be due to the definition of &quot;sea level&quot; at the time; in any case the lower end of the canal joined the river some distance above the sea.

==Origins==
Agricultural land around the Looe valleys was considered to be of high quality, but the acidic soil required annual improvement with lime. Traditionally the limestone to prepare this had come from the Plymouth area by coastal shipping to the East Looe Valley where it was burnt in kilns to make the lime. While the coastal shipping element of the journey was straightforward, even main roads were in a primitive condition; for example:

Despite its grand title, it would seem that the &#x27;Royal Cornish Way&#x27; (today&#x27;s A30) was little better than a muddy cart-track by the beginning of the 18th century. In places it may well have had no defined edge or surface at all, leaving travellers to struggle as best they could in mist or darkness.

To get to Liskeard above the navigable river, the means of transport was on the backs of horses: the first wheeled wagon was introduced into the Liskeard district in 1790. As late as the 1830s, pack horses and mules were the general means of transport for goods throughout the county, once off the turnpike roads. Approaching 10 tonnes (11 short tons) of limestone were required per acre annually (about 25 tonnes per hectare), so that its transport was a considerable undertaking.

The idea for a canal to Liskeard was first investigated in 1777 when Edmund Leach and &quot;a gentleman from Liskeard&quot; proposed a canal which would run between Banka Mill, west of Liskeard, and Sandplace, to the north of Looe on the East Looe River. It would have been a contour canal, with three reaches connected by &quot;machines&quot;—evidently inclined planes. At the time no canal inclined plane had been installed anywhere in the world: the first actually installed on a canal was on the Ketley Canal in 1788. The project was estimated to cost £17,495, which would be recouped in seven years, based on expected income, but the scheme was not progressed.

After at least one other abortive proposal, a local solicitor Peter Glubb convened a meeting on 2 August 1823 in Liskeard to agree the way forward. After a second meeting at East Looe on 9 August, the engineer James Green was asked to present proposals for a canal, a railway or a turnpike road to link Looe to Liskeard. He swiftly presented his views, on 30 August, recommending a tub-boat canal, suitable for four-ton boats in trains (i.e. connected groups). The rise of 180 feet in in 10 km) threatened water supply difficulties if negotiated by locks, so Green repeated the earlier proposal for two inclined planes.

A subscription list was quickly filled, but soon this proposal too stalled, due to strong opposition from interests in Lostwithiel and Fowey, and &quot;weakness of the proprietors in a pecuniary point of view and other insuperable obstacles&quot;. The following year the plan was revived, this time for a canal with locks. In order to appease John Buller, a substantial local landowner, the canal would have a &quot;Towing Path of sufficient width for Gentlemen&#x27;s Carriages&quot;. The committee needed Buller&#x27;s support to aid the passage of the bill through Parliament.
Green prepared plans for a bill, and the necessary act of Parliament, the (6 Geo. 4. c. clxiii), was obtained on 22 June 1825, but after Green&#x27;s departure, the proprietors asked Robert Coad to design the route in detail. The act created the Liskeard and Looe Union Canal Company, with an authorised capital of £13,000 in shares of £25, and authority to borrow a further £10,000 on mortgage if required. The act gave powers &quot;for making and maintaining a navigable canal from Tarras Pill, in the parish of Duloe ... to or near Moorswater, in the parish of Liskeard, and for making several Roads to communicate therewith&quot;. It also allowed feed water to be taken from the River Looe and the &quot;Crylla Rivulet&quot;; but there were restrictions on the latter, so &quot;that no injury may be done to the navigation of the Fowey, of which river the Crylla is a tributary stream&quot;. An engineer could be appointed by the Mayor of Lostwithiel to monitor compliance with this obligation.

Inclined planes may not have been ruled out, because Priestley says that &quot;The company are also empowered to make rollers and inclined planes.&quot; However Priestley does not offer this as a direct quotation from the act, and he may have heard this reported from an earlier, unsuccessful bill, and mistakenly understood the plan to be still current.

Work on building the canal began on 6 September 1825, with Robert Coad as the engineer and Robert Retallick as Superintendent of Works. There was some internal tension in the committee of management, for there was a motion at the general meeting in February 1826 that a properly qualified civil engineer should be asked to assess the work done so far, and whether the two men should be allowed to proceed without further assistance, but the motion was defeated by 49 votes to 10, and four of the nine Committee members changed at the subsequent election.

The canal had been planned to run on the west side of the river towards Looe, but a landowner, Mr Eliot, was holding out for excessive compensation for his land, and the construction was transferred to the east side over the affected length, in the lands of John Buller, to by-pass Eliot&#x27;s land. During the construction, the company operated a health insurance scheme for the labourers similar to that commonly in place in the Cornish mines, with each worker contributing 6 pence (2.5p) per month, which was used to pay Mr. Robert Rean, an apothecary and surgeon from East Looe, for his services.

==Opening==

Part of the canal opened for traffic on 27 August 1827, and in March 1828 the Royal Cornwall Gazette reported that it was complete. It rose through over its length of 

Although the canal was in full operation, there were numerous challenges facing the proprietors. The works were &quot;in a slovenly and unfinished state&quot;, and it took until 1830 for the reservoir at Moorswater and the feed from the Crylla to be completed. A road had to be made from Moorswater into Liskeard at Dean Well, at a cost of £1,200, completed in 1829. Dean Well was at the north-western extremity of Dean Street, so the road referred to would appear to be &quot;New Road&quot;. Traffic immediately transferred to this road from the steep and inconvenient turnpike road (&quot;Old Road&quot;) and the canal company demanded a subscription for maintenance from the Turnpike Trustees. Users of the Canal Company&#x27;s road were subject to tolls.

About 1835 a section of road from Looe Mills to Highwood was constructed by the canal company. Highwood is a little less than a mile (about 1 km) north of Looe Mills, on the Turnpike Road north-west of Moorswater. The new road gave access to Highwood from the canal, using the Turnpike Road from Moorswater to Looe Mills.

==Operation==
The canal vastly increased the facility of bringing lime and sea sand to the agricultural hinterland above Liskeard; in addition coal was brought for lime burning and for domestic use. Prices of these commodities fell considerably; however other traffics—particularly downstream traffic which would have generated return loads—were disappointing. Lime was burnt at Moorswater and elsewhere on the higher reaches of the canal, leading to the failure of kilns at Sandplace, which lost trade.

The company watched expenditure carefully, but managed to pay a dividend of 6 per cent in 1830 and 5 per cent thereafter for most of the canal&#x27;s life. Income was generally allocated to capital expenditure. Net annual profit seems to have been in the region of £300 to £400 during this period. Considerable attention was given to improving the terminal facilities at Moorswater, as the trade increased. In 1832 a quay was constructed, and a tramway (referred to as a &quot;railroad&quot;) was constructed alongside it. William Hodge and John Lyne had lime kilns on the west and east side of the canal head respectively, and they had simple plateways connecting the basin with the kilns by inclined planes powered by waterwheels. Hodge&#x27;s had a gauge of 2 ft 6 in gauge (760 mm), was supported by a series of pillars and used an undershot wheel. Lyne built five kilns in 1831, and water from a pond to the north of the works was channelled along a culvert to power an overshot wheel.

By 1835 the poor condition of the canal works was again giving cause for concern, and contract arrangements were put in place to rectify the situation. However, the unsatisfactory state of affairs was slow to be rectified, and complaints about the conditions and measures put in place by the directors continued to dominate the minute books until at least 1851. From 1842 the Company became concerned at the gradual decline in usage of the canal and of income. This was due to a general agricultural depression, and also competition from St Germans and Lerryn (on an arm of the River Fowey); the Company repeatedly reduced dues on the canal.

==Mineral extraction on Caradon==
Copper ore had been discovered on Caradon in 1836, and as the volume of extraction grew, it had been taken to St Germans and elsewhere for onward transport. From 1839 granite too began to be seriously quarried at the Cheesewring. Moving the minerals by pack horse was expensive and inconvenient, and the Liskeard and Caradon Railway was promoted to bring the ore to Moorswater; the Canal company made room at their terminal for the railway. The railway reached that place in 1846, on 8 March, from when the ore was taken to Looe on the Canal.

This transformed the economy of the Canal and of the area. Mineral ore could now be brought relatively conveniently to market: by railway to Moorswater; by canal boat to Looe; and onwards by coastal shipping. This not only brought about transfer of the transportation from other routes to the benefit of the canal, but it encouraged further exploration and mineral extraction, which then further augmented carrying on the canal. The new mines required coal for operation of their engines, and also iron products, and these traffics also used the canal.

This vastly increased volume of traffic caused the company to extend considerably the wharf facilities at Moorswater. There were also concerns about the adequacy of the water supply with the increased use of the locks, and there was considerable friction between the company and millers higher up the East Looe Valley over use of water.

Some limited statistics have survived: 
in 1849, 21,713 tons were carried, of which 7,546 tons were copper ore, and 6,175 tons were coal;
in 1859, 48,193 tons were carried, of which 17,361 tons were copper ore and 15,712 tons were coal, as well as 8,297 tons of granite. Messenger says that the profit each year was about £2,000.

==Proposals for a railway==
At the later date, the canal was working at capacity, and the transshipment at Moorswater from rail to canal was costing from 4d to 6d per ton; because of congestion on the canal, trade was being lost to competing routes via Calstock and St Germans; and the twenty-four locks caused the journey to be slow and cumbersome. Moreover, the Cornwall Railway was being constructed to run through Liskeard, with unknown implications for the competitiveness of the canal. Attention was given to constructing a railway from Moorswater to Looe.

A report was presented on 30 September 1857, which proposed a railway at a cost of £11,000, and this was quickly approved. Although there was some opposition from Buller&#x27;s son, also called John, and from the Admiralty, who were concerned about navigation on the river, the Duchy of Cornwall helped the company to obtain its authorising act of Parliament, the Liskeard and Looe Railway Act 1858 (21 &amp; 22 Vict. c. xi), which was granted on 11 May 1858. It authorised the canal company to raise additional capital of £13,000 in £25 shares, with authority to borrow £4,000. Two of the clauses in the 1825 act were repealed, relating to penalties for destroying the canal.

The railway opened on 27 December 1860 for goods traffic, passenger traffic following in 1879; it is more fully described in the article Liskeard and Looe Railway.

==The canal after the railway==
The railway did not take over the canal alignment: it crossed the canal by bridge in five places, three below Sandplace and two above, although the railway seems to have obliterated the canal in the northern extremity. Sandplace continued to be a significant wharf for the canal, due to the activities of John Buller, but it appears that the canal above that point, although not actually displaced by the railway construction, was positively allowed to decline. Although the canal was still officially open, the Liskeard Water Company negotiated the takeover of the Crylla Leat and its water supply from May 1861, subsequently agreeing to pay £5 per year for its perpetual use. With no water supply to the top of the canal, water was channeled through a culvert under the railway to keep the section below Sandplace navigable. The canal was still maintained, as £179 was spent on repairs between 1862 and 1867, but it is fairly certain that this only affected the lower section. The upper section may have been used by the tenants of the Morval Estate for the transport of agricultural produce, for which no tolls were chargeable, but residents at Duloe complained in 1867 that the canal could no longer be used since the railway had been built. A note in the accounts for 1862 states: &quot;1861: LLUC&#x27;s canal replaced by railway and steam introduced on the LCR.&quot;

Decline of navigability continued steadily, and only small boats could make any passage at all. Between 1901 and 1909, the annual gross dues averaged 35 shillings (£1.75), mainly derived from tolls of 3 pence (1.25p) for small boats of about 1.5 tons carrying sand and seaweed, which was used to improve the land. Two of the original 16-ton boats were still operational, and were charged 1s 9d (8.75p) for the journey to Sandplace.

The Great Western Railway purchased the Canal company in 1909, in order to acquire the railway line, passenger traffic, and especially tourism, having taken over as the dominant traffic. The Liskeard and Caradon Railway closed in 1917 but the Liskeard and Looe Railway still operates, with passenger trains on the line being marketed under the brand name &quot;The Looe Valley Line&quot;.

==Conservation==
Towards the end of the twentieth century, there was some interest in conserving what remains of the canal. In 1988 the West Country branch of the Inland Waterways Association produced a walking guide to the canal, and to several others in the West Country, hoping to stimulate interest in it. In 1997, Caradon District Council announced plans for a partial restoration of the remains, although not to a navigable standard. However, there is no publicity available at present (2012) to indicate whether this work was carried out.

==Points of interest==






This shows the locations of locks which were still identified as such on the 1882 Ordnance Survey map. 13 of the original 24 are shown. At Moorswater, the railway has obliterated the terminal basin by that date.

<text>The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal is a canal in the south-west of England between Bridgwater and Taunton, opened in 1827 and linking the River Tone to the River Parrett. There were a number of abortive schemes to link the Bristol Channel to the English Channel by waterway in the 18th and early 19th centuries. These schemes followed the approximate route eventually taken by the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, but the canal was instead built as part of a plan to link Bristol to Taunton by waterway.

The early years of operation were marred by a series of legal disputes, which were resolved when the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal Company and the Conservators, who managed the River Tone Navigation, agreed that the canal company should take over the Tone Navigation. The canal originally terminated at a basin at Huntworth, to the east of Bridgwater, but was later extended to a floating harbour at Bridgwater Docks on its western edge. Financially this was a disaster, as the extension was funded by a mortgage, and the arrival of the railways soon afterwards started the demise of the canal. The canal was rescued from bankruptcy by the Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1866.

Despite commercial traffic ceasing in 1907, the infrastructure was maintained in good order, and the canal was used for the transport of potable water from 1962. The Countryside Act 1968 provided a framework for Somerset County Council to start the restoration of the canal as a leisure facility, which was completed in 1994, when the canal was reopened throughout. Bridgwater Docks have been restored as a marina, but there is no navigable connection to the River Parrett, as the canal still transports drinking water for the people of Bridgwater.

==History==
Prior to the building of the canal, navigation between the towns of Bridgwater and Taunton was possible by using the River Parrett and the River Tone. The Tone had been improved by its conservators, who had obtained acts of Parliament; the River Tone Navigation Act 1698 (10 Will. 3. c. 8) in 1699 and the River Tone Improvement Act 1707 (6 Ann. c. 70) in 1707; which had allowed them to straighten and dredge the river and parts of the Parrett, and to build locks and half-locks to manage the water levels. The initial work was completed by 1717, although further improvements including more locks continued to be made until the early 19th century.

===Precursors===
From 1768 there were a number of grand schemes proposed, all with the aim of linking the Bristol Channel to the English Channel by a waterway, thereby avoiding the need to navigate by sea around Cornwall and Devon. James Brindley was the first to survey a route, which would have run from the Bristol Channel to Exeter, following the course of the River Tone for part of its route. In 1769, Robert Whitworth looked at a shorter route from Bridgwater Bay to Seaton, following the River Parrett and the River Axe. He was asked to reassess the route in the 1790s. William Jessop surveyed a route between Taunton and Exeter in 1794, while another group proposed a canal linking Bristol, Nailsea, Bridgwater and Taunton, which was surveyed by William White. Jessop&#x27;s assistant, Josiah Easton, suggested a route from Uphill (on the Bristol Channel) to Seaton, again in 1794, and the previous two schemes sought parliamentary approval as the Grand Western Canal and the Bristol and Western Canal, respectively. Only the first was authorised, as the Grand Western Canal Act 1796 (36 Geo. 3. c. 46), but the economic downturn caused by the Napoleonic Wars meant that construction did not begin immediately.

John Rennie surveyed the line for a ship canal from the mouth of the River Parrett to Seaton in 1810, which was designed for ships of , but it was felt that the economic situation would not support the projected expenditure of over £1 million. He then considered a more modest proposal, based on the original Bristol and Western plans, and the scheme, now renamed the Bristol and Taunton Canal, was authorised by an act of Parliament, the &#x27; (51 Geo. 3. c. lx) dated 14 May 1811. The company had powers to raise £420,000 in shares and an additional £150,000 if required, but economic concerns meant that the project did not start immediately. Powers for the Bristol to Bridgwater section lapsed in 1815, but work finally commenced in 1822, to be halted by an injunction because the authorised route was not being followed. A further act, the &#x27; (5 Geo. 4. c. cxx) of 17 June 1824, authorised the revised route, and changed the name of the project to the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal Company. The predicted costs for the construction of the shorter canal were £34,145, as opposed to £429,990 for the longer scheme.

Three further schemes were proposed before the idea of a Channel-to-Channel link was abandoned. James Green proposed a tub-boat canal in 1822, capable of handling boats, which would have used inclines instead of locks, and would have cost £120,000. Thomas Telford revived the idea of a ship canal in 1824, which would have taken over the line of the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal – enabling boats to reach the south coast – at a cost of £1.75 million. This was authorised in 1825, but no further action occurred. Finally, a barge canal between Bridgwater and Beer, costing £600,000, was proposed in 1828, but enthusiasm for large canal schemes was waning, and the advent of iron-hulled steamships meant that the risks of navigation around the south-west peninsula were reduced.

===Construction===
Construction of the canal began in 1822, with James Hollinsworth as the engineer and John Easton as the senior surveyor. The Bristol and Taunton scheme had incorporated a high-level crossing of the River Parrett, but the shortened canal would now join the Parrett at Huntworth, where a basin was to be constructed. This change of route resulted in the Reverend Robert Gray obtaining an injunction, and work on the lower half of the canal stopped until the new route could be properly authorised by the 1824 act of Parliament. By this time, the estimated cost had risen to £60,000. Below Durston, the canal was cut into the clay subsoil, the clay forming a naturally waterproof channel; but from Durston to Taunton the canal bed had to be puddled with clay to make it watertight, as the underlying ground was shale.
The canal was to be about long. It included a embankment at Lyng, which was high, two short cuttings, eleven brick-built bridges to carry roads over the canal, and more than twelve timber swing bridges, built to provide accommodation crossings for farms which had been divided by the line of the canal. The lock at Firepool (Taunton) had a set of reverse-facing gates, to prevent the canal draining if the level of the River Tone dropped. There were four more locks on the main line, and a lock at the entrance to Huntworth Basin. One final lock connected the basin to the river, and again it had a set of reverse-facing gates, so that the basin could be drained at low tide, and the low level retained for maintenance if required. A system of paddle gearing – using metal ball weights at the top and metal cylinder weights at the bottom – is unique to the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal. Over fifty culverts were built to carry streams and drainage ditches under the canal. The work was completed with no recorded incidents of serious injury or death among the workforce.

By mid-1826, the canal company had insufficient funds to complete the work, and a special meeting authorised the taking out of a mortgage to cover the £15,000 deficit. The canal was an obvious competitor to the River Tone Navigation, which was managed by the Conservators of the River Tone, a legal body created for that purpose by in 1699 by the River Tone Navigation Act 1698 (10 Will. 3. c. 8). There was animosity between the company and the conservators, with the company maintaining that they had a right to use the Tone to reach the centre of Taunton, and the conservators maintaining that they did not. The canal was scheduled to be opened on 1 January 1827, but the opening was delayed until 3 January, as the connection to the River Tone was not made until 2 January. The opening celebrations were hampered by snow and bitter cold weather.

===Operation===

The early years of the new canal were marred by legal disputes with the Conservators of the River Tone. The connection to the Tone at Taunton had been made forcibly, by the canal company breaching the bank of the river. In August 1827 they announced that they were taking over the Tone, and evicted William Goodland, the river superintendent, from his cottage. Despite a ruling by the Court of King&#x27;s Bench that their action was illegal, the canal company held on to the river until a High Court judgment in February 1830. The conservators promptly built a dam, to prevent boats reaching the river and water entering the canal, which they removed after further legal action and an order of the Chancery Court. Reconciliation finally came in late 1831, when the two parties proposed a new act of Parliament to authorise the sale of the Tone Navigation to the canal company. The (2 &amp; 3 Will. 4. c. xliii) was obtained in July 1832, and required the canal company to erect a new iron bridge to replace the existing North Town Bridge, which hampered access to the wharfs in Taunton. They also had powers to construct a lock and a short length of canal at French Weir, to connect with the Grand Western Canal, while the conservators were allowed to conduct an annual inspection of the canal, and to resume their ownership of the river if the canal was not maintained in good order.
At the Bridgwater end, navigation onto the River Parrett was not easy, and the Corporation of Bridgwater had commissioned a number of surveys to construct a floating harbour. All came to nothing, but in 1836 the Bristol and Exeter Railway Company obtained an act of Parliament, the Bristol and Exeter Railway Act 1836 (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4. c. xxxvi), to construct a railway which would pass through Bridgwater. Subsequently, the canal company, in order to protect their trade, sought their own act of Parliament to construct a floating harbour to the west of Bridgwater, and to extend the canal to join it. The (7 Will. 4 &amp; 1 Vict. c. xi) was obtained on 21 April 1837, and the works were started. The construction work involved a deep cutting from Albert Street to West Street, a short tunnel at West Street. There it entered Bridgwater Docks, which consisted of:
*Inner basin that covered 
*Outer basin covering 

The two basins were connected by a lock, whilst towards the river a ship lock consisting of a single gate, and a barge lock, consisting of a pair of gates. The whole outer basin could be used as a lock by larger ships up to 600 tons. The estimated cost of £25,000 for the scheme escalated to nearly £100,000, most of which was raised by mortgage.
The new facilities were opened on 25 March 1841, after which the basin and locks at Huntworth were filled in. Trade increased from in 1840, before the harbour opened, to shortly afterwards. Around 2,400 vessels per year were using the port by 1853. The canal company had hoped that the opening of the Grand Western Canal in 1838 and the Chard Canal in 1842 would increase traffic significantly, but their impact was marginal. Despite commercial success, the interest payments on the mortgage were crippling, and in 1846 the company obtained an act of Parliament, the (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. cxlv), to convert the canal into a railway, although its powers were never used. Trade halved as railway competition increased, and the company was in the hands of receivers by the early 1850s.

In 1866 the Bristol and Exeter Railway stepped in and bought the canal. The main attraction was the dock, with its large volume of coal traffic, but they purchased both the canal and the dock for £64,000, under the terms of an act of Parliament obtained that year, which included a requirement that there should always be &quot;a good and sufficient water communication between the towns of Taunton and Bridgwater&quot;. Unlike many such acquisitions, the canal was seen as a useful adjunct to the railway network, and was maintained in good order for several years, with the Conservators of the River Tone continuing their annual inspections, and reporting any defects to the railway company.

===Decline===

The canal was increasingly affected by water supply problems. The main source of water was the River Tone, although this was not fed into the canal at Firepool, in order to ensure that the mills on the upper section could function. Instead water was pumped out of the river at Creech, by the Charlton Pumping Station, where the river and canal were only apart. Large volumes of water were discharged from the canal every fortnight, when the Bridgwater Dock was scoured, in order to free it from silt, while the Railway Company was extracting water to supply the station and steam locomotive sheds at Taunton. During the summer months there was often not enough water to go round.

The canal gradually became clogged with weed, and the railway took much of the trade. Between 1870 and 1874, income dropped from £2,500 to £1,700. Three years later, the Bristol and Exeter Railway merged with the Great Western Railway. The new owners were remote, and were more interested in the water supply for Taunton station and for the Bridgwater Dock, than running the canal as a going concern, with the result that the canal deteriorated further. The Conservators continued their annual inspections, but had little hope of any improvements being made.

The opening by the Great Western Railway of the Severn Tunnel in 1886 brought further decline, for the imports of coal and slate from South Wales to Bridgwater Dock and the canal could now be moved more directly. The provision in 1902 of water troughs on the railway near Creech, to enable non-stop trains to pick up water, required another a day, which was extracted from the Tone. The remaining traffic moved to the railway, the last commercial boats used the canal, from Bridgwater dock to a wharf in North Town, Taunton, in 1907, and the canal was effectively closed.

===Closure===

After the First World War the canal remained in a state of limbo – with minimal maintenance by the railway company – and was the haunt of fishermen and walkers. The Conservators continued their annual inspections, and the infrastructure remained in remarkably good order, compared to many other closed canals. The section near Creech St Michael was even used for swimming lessons for the local school children in the 1930s.

During the Second World War the route of the canal was employed as part of the Taunton Stop Line, a defensive line which followed the course of canals and railway embankments from the mouth of the Parrett to Seaton on the south coast. All permanent bridges were mined with demolition chambers. Hamp Bridge was prepared for demolition with four small charge chambers under the east side of the arch containing a total of of the explosive, ammonal. Anti-tank obstacles were placed at bridge sites or locks to hinder bridging operations. All of the swing bridges were removed, but were then replaced with fixed timber bridges at towpath level. Only essential maintenance was carried out, to ensure a water supply for fire-fighting and to prevent flooding. Although the physical structure of the canal was not damaged by enemy action, all of the Company records and traffic receipts, together with those of the Bristol and Exeter Railway, were destroyed during a bombing raid.

Control of the canal passed into public ownership with the Transport Act 1947. Despite concerted efforts, the Conservators could not make any progress with the removal of the fixed low-level bridges, which prevented maintenance from being carried out. The Inland Waterways Association started to take an active interest in the restoration of the canal from 1952, but this was resisted by the British Transport Commission, who padlocked the lock gates to prevent them being used. Despite this, a team of seven men was employed to maintain the infrastructure through this period. The maintenance of the channel enabled the canal to become one of the first to be used for the commercial transport of water, which was pumped from the canal to Durleigh reservoir from 1962 onwards.

The canal was absorbed by the British Waterways Board in 1962. The Conservators carried out an annual inspection in 1965, the first since 1947, but had to use a motor coach for most of the journey, as the locks were unusable. With the passing of the Transport Act 1968, the canal was classified as a remainder waterway – little more than a drainage channel. Only essential maintenance to keep it safe was to be carried out. Soon afterwards, part of the cutting wall between West Street and Albert Street collapsed, and although the bed of the canal was cleared to ensure water could reach the dock, the towpath remained blocked for another nine years. Bridgwater Docks, which had been used by a small amount of coastal shipping, were finally closed in 1971: the connection at the docks was stopped up, and the British Waterways Board were granted permission to cease maintaining the canal for navigation.

==Restoration==
From the late 1960s, there was a growing awareness of the benefits of retaining the canal. The Inland Waterways Association produced a report, entitled &quot;The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal - Waterway with a Future&quot;, suggesting that the canal had the potential for development as a linear Country Park, and the County Planning Officer for Somerset County Council produced a second report, suggesting that funds should be made available for maintenance and restoration, which the County Council duly adopted. The Countryside Act 1968 provided a framework for such action, and a visit in 1971 to see the work being done on the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal as part of the creation of the Brecon Beacons National Park convinced the Council of the wisdom of such a course of action. By 1974, Higher and Lower Maunsel locks, which are listed buildings, had been refurbished by the British Waterways Board, with funding from the County Council. Funding for towpath maintenance and weed cutting was also provided.
In December 1974, the Council bought Bridgwater Dock from British Railways. The concrete wall across the barge lock was removed, but there was no intention to restore the ship lock. By 1980, the council had invested over £50,000 in the restoration, which included Kings and Standards locks, and the bottom gates of Newtown Lock. Some bridges had been raised, but only to , which allowed canoeing, but prevented bigger boats from using the waterway. Work on the deep cutting between West Street and Albert Street started in September 1978, jointly funded by the County Council and Sedgemoor District Council, using direct labour, while a Manpower Services Commission scheme to dredge the canal from the dock to the cutting and to widen the towpath was funded by the District Council in 1981.

The condition of the swing bridge at Bathpool caused a change in policy. There were objections to the plan to replace it with a fixed bridge with limited headroom, and the planning application was deferred. By 1983, a six-year plan to restore the canal was fully costed, and it was adopted by the British Waterways Board, the County Council, Sedgemoor District Council and Taunton Deane Borough Council in the following year. The scheme was supported by the West Country Branch of the Inland Waterways Association, who offered the services of the Waterway Recovery Group, to do some of the work. The swing bridges at Crossways, Boat and Anchor, and Fordgate were rebuilt, and by 1987, of canal were available for navigation. After some teething problems, it was decided that many of the rest of the accommodation bridges would be raised to give of headroom, rather than rebuilding them as swing bridges. Restoration of the bridges at the Taunton end continued during the early 1990s, and the canal was finally re-opened in 1994.

==Current use==

Boating on the canal is encouraged, although the lack of a link to the River Parrett at Bridgwater is restrictive. At this point, the Parrett is a salt water river, and is laden with silt, whereas the canal contains fresh water. Not only is there a risk of silt entering the canal, but the salt water cannot be allowed to contaminate the fresh, as the canal is still used for the transport of drinking water for the population of Bridgwater. The canal forms part of the local flood relief system, in winter taking water from the River Tone at Taunton and discharging it into the Parrett at a sluice in the western fringe of Bridgwater, near the Bridgwater Canalside Centre.

Bridgwater Docks, in which the tidal basin, locks, quaysides, bridges and fittings are listed buildings, is now a marina, emptied of boats in 2021, and the old warehouse, built in 1840–50 has been converted into apartments, with new apartment blocks built nearby. The only commercially active industry located at the docks was Bowering&#x27;s Animal Feed Mill, until its closure in 2020. The towpath forms part of Sustrans&#x27; National Cycle Network route NCR-3 connecting Bath and Cornwall, and attracts numerous travellers. Plans have been proposed for the upgrading of the towpath and development of a visitor centre at Maunsel.

During 2020, the boats were ordered to leave the docks at Bridgwater, however as of 2023, there has been a £5m grant to restore the docks and canal.

== The Somerset Space Walk ==
The Taunton-Bridgwater canal is also home to an installation termed the &#x27;Somerset Space Walk&#x27;, a scale model (530 million:1) of the Solar System centred around the &#x27;Sun&#x27; at Maunsel lock with the planets located along the towpath in both directions. The Space Walk was designed by local man, Pip Youngman, in order to demonstrate the scale of the Solar System in an interactive way. The trail can be walked either from Taunton&#x27;s Brewhouse Theatre to Maunsel Lock (Pluto to the Sun) or from Bridgwater&#x27;s Morrison&#x27;s Supermarket to Maunsel Lock (also Pluto to the Sun) or of course, vice versa. From Pluto to the Sun from either town is an walk.

<text>The Wyrley and Essington Canal, known locally as &quot;the Curly Wyrley&quot;, is a canal in the English Midlands. As built it ran from Wolverhampton to Huddlesford Junction near Lichfield, with a number of branches: some parts are currently derelict. Pending planned restoration to Huddlesford, the navigable mainline now terminates at Ogley Junction near Brownhills. In 2008 it was designated a Local Nature Reserve.

==Construction==

The canal was built to allow transport of coal from coal mines near Wyrley, Essington and New Invention to Wolverhampton and Walsall, but also carried limestone and other goods. An act of Parliament, the (32 Geo. 3. c. 81) received royal assent on 30 April 1792, entitled &quot;An Act for making and maintaining a navigable Canal from, or from near, Wyrley Bank, in the county of Stafford, to communicate with the Birmingham and Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, at or near the town of Wolverhampton, in the said county; and also certain collateral Cuts therein described from the said intended Canal&quot;. The act authorised the construction of a canal from the Birmingham Canal near Wolverhampton to Wyrley Bank, and the raising of up to £45,000 to pay for construction, £25,000 from the issuing of shares and another £20,000 in loans. The appointed engineer was William Pitt, who might have been the Staffordshire historian, but the minute books of the committee have not survived, so there are no details of how the work progressed, or of Mr Pitt. The Birmingham Canal Company was renamed the Birmingham Canal Navigations (BCN) in 1794.

The canal was level from the Birmingham Canal to Sneyd Junction, a distance of . The main line then ascended through five locks to reach the collieries at Wyrley Bank, with a further four locks to reach the Essington colliery. A second branch continued on the level from Sneyd Junction to Birchills, near Walsall. There was some animosity with the Birmingham Canal, since the committee passed a resolution to ensure that no person who was a committee member for that canal could become part of the committee. This was rescinded after six months, to reduce tensions. The level section to Sneyd Junction opened in November 1794, but there were issues with the connecting stop lock. The Birmingham Canal had managed to get a clause inserted into the enabling act allowing them to stop boats moving between the two canals if the water level in the Wyrley and Essington was less than above the level in the Birmingham Canal. Getting lock gates to seal with such a small drop in level proved difficult, and the gates were locked shut to prevent water passing into the Wyrley and Essington. 
A second act, the (34 Geo. 3. c. 25) received royal assent on 28 March 1794, entitled &quot;An Act for extending the Wyrley and Essington Canal&quot; – this authorised a long extension, from Sneyd (thus making the line from Sneyd to Wyrley Bank effectively a branch) past Lichfield to Huddlesford Junction on the Coventry Canal, together with the raising of up to £115,000 (equivalent to £ million in ), to complete construction. The 1794 act also authorised a branch to the Hay Head Limeworks, which became known as the Daw End branch, and a short branch to some coal pits, which is variously known as the Lords Hayes, Lord Hayes or Lord Hay&#x27;s branch. The Lichfield branch would create a new and shorter route for coal traffic from Tipton bound for the Trent and Mersey Canal, and because this would take traffic away from the Birmingham Canal, passage of the bill through Parliament was smoothed out by allowing them to charge a compensation toll of 3 pence (3/240 of a pound) per ton on coal passing through Wolverhampton which was bound for Fazeley via the new route. Water supply was carefully regulated, to protect the supplies used by millers and other canals, and there was a restriction on the amount that could be discharged into Whittington Brook, to protect the Marquess of Donegall&#x27;s pleasure gardens from damage.

The Lichfield route through to Huddlesford Junction was opened on 8 May 1797, but the company faced financial difficulties, partly caused by shareholders failing to honour the calls on their shares. In April 1798, the company announced that the Hay Head branch could not be finished, because of the lack of funds, but somehow they managed to fund the rest of the work, which was completed by April 1799. They borrowed £1,000 in May 1801, to enable work on the Hay Head branch to resume, but it was still not finished one year later. In July 1800, the accounts showed that there were £3,120 of arrears due to shareholders failing to pay calls. However, they issued their first dividend of £2 per share in November, which resulted in most of the arrears being paid up subsequently. There were also problems with water supply, in part caused by leakage into mines, which resulted in there being insufficient water in some of the pounds. Water was obtained by draining Norton Bog near Chase Water, but the company faced additional difficulties in 1799 when the dam of the Norton Pool Chasewater reservoir failed, causing considerable damage as the water surged through Shenstone, Hopwas and Drayton. Matters were finally resolved when the repairs to the reservoir at Cannock Chase was completed, around 1800.

===Operation===
In one sense, the Wyrley and Essington Canal was built ahead of its time, as it ran through rural countryside, and its full potential was only realised with the opening of the Cannock Chase coalfield, towards the end of the nineteenth century. However, it enabled people in Lichfield to obtain cheap coal, and there was a regular service from Lichfield to Derby and Burton upon Trent, while a service from Wolverhampton to London called at Lichfield three times each week. The canal fueled the development of collieries and limestone quarries near Bloxwich, and an ironworks at Goscote. The brick making industry flourished at Sneyd, using coal that arrived by canal, with the bricks being used for new housing development at Walsall. Other local industries that made use of the canal included bit-making, lock-smithing and tack-making.

The Daw End Branch ran from Catshill Junction to limestone quarries and limeworks at Hay Head. It was around long with no locks, and opened in 1800. Prior to its opening, the limestone quarries had been described as &quot;inexhaustible as quantity, and of a very superior quality&quot; in 1795. By 1809, they were disused, and the construction of a railway to serve them had been abandoned. Boats only travelled as far as Daw End wharf at that time, but by 1822 they had reopened, as they were advertised as supplying the ingredients for Brindley&#x27;s British Cement.

The canal to Essington also suffered from mixed fortunes. The water supply was never really adequate for the number of locks, and in 1798 Henry Vernon, who owned most of the collieries and who had for a time been chairman of the canal company, was paid to pump water from his mines into the canal. He then laid a bill before Parliament for a railway, to run from his collieries to the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal at Little Sandon, which would enable him to stop using the Essington Branch. The bill was opposed by both canals, with the Wyrley and Essington arguing that Vernon had become bankrupt in 1789, and that the management of his collieries had since been entrusted to Hordern, who was the canal company&#x27;s treasurer. The branch had only ben built on the promise of the coal traffic from Vernon&#x27;s mines. Disagreement carried on for years, and the canal company proposed to open proceedings against him in 1812 and 1813, to recover money that he still owed them. Attempts to resolve the issues included an agreement to extend the Wyrley branch for towards Wyrley Bank, and to construct a railway to his collieries. The new canal was closed by 1829, but was later reopened and extended. The Essington Branch, which was only long, rose to a height of above ordnance datum. It was the highest point on the Wyrley and Essington, but the branch was the first part of the canal to close, in the 1830s.
The idea of amalgamation was first raised by the Birmingham Canal Navigations in 1820, but the Wyrley and Essington had rejected the idea. In 1822 they considered whether trade could be improved by building links to neighbouring canals. A number of mine owners suggested a link between the two systems at Walsall in 1825, and surveys for links to the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal and to the Birmingham system were made in 1826 and 1827. There was more pressure for a link at Walsall from a group of industrialists in 1829, which resulted in the Wyrley and Essington proposing amalgamation. This time, the Birmingham company were not interested, and in 1835 they dismissed the idea of a junction at Walsall. In 1838, the Walsall contingent suggested the Birmingham company could build the link, and the Wyrley and Essington could supply the water. Still the Birmingham company were not interested, and so the Wyrley and Essington decided to submit a bill to Parliament to build the link themselves. Almost overnight, the Birmingham company&#x27;s attitude changed, and an agreement to amalgamate was signed on 9 February 1840, which was ratified by an act of Parliament, the (3 &amp; 4 Vict. c. xxiv) obtained in April.

===BCN era===
Once the Wyrley and Essington Canal became part of the Birmingham Canal Navigations, there was a rush of activity to connect the two systems together. The Walsall Junction Canal was the first to be built, consisting of a short section from Birchills Junction and a flight of eight locks descending to the Walsall Canal. It was long and opened in 1841. The Bentley Canal was long, and descended through ten locks from Wednesfield Junction on the Wyrley and Essington to the Anson Branch, just above its junction with the Walsall Canal. It opened in 1843. The third link was the Rushall Canal, which descended through nine locks from the end of the Daw End branch, to join the Tame Valley Canal at Rushall Junction. This canal had been opened in 1844, and the Rushall Canal, which was long, opened in 1847.
The extensions of the 1840s had proved to be a success, and in 1854 the BCN, now under the control of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), obtained an act of Parliament to authorise further works, three of which affected the Wyrley and Essington. The main project was for the construction of the Cannock Extension Canal, a branch between Pelsall and the coal mining area of Hednesford, near Cannock. This included two tramways, one from Norton Springs, and a second from Hednesford Basin to Littleworth. At the time the act was obtained, the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal agreed to build a connecting link from their Hatherton Branch to a junction with the proposed Cannock Extension Canal. Purchase of the land for the link was jointly funded by the two companies, but the construction of the flight of 13 locks was paid for by the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal. Although the work was completed by 1860, they were not used until the opening of the Cannock branch to Hednesford basin in 1863.

The 1854 act also authorised an extension of the Lord Hay&#x27;s branch towards Cannock Chase, and another extension of the line along Wyrley Bank, which was completed in 1857. Between them, the Cannock Extension Canal and the Wyrley Bank extension cost over £100,000. Water supply for the Wyrley and Essington came from the Cannock reservoir, and was fed into the canal by a feeder. In the early 1860s, the Marquess of Anglesey was opening new coal mines close to the reservoir, and the feeder was widened to make it navigable, to tap into this new market. It became known as the Anglesey Branch.

Heavy coal traffic used the Cannock Extension Canal for its entire life, although subsidence caused by the mining was a regular problem. In an effort to combat the effects of a section of canal sinking, the BCN erected a number of safety gates. Those at Northwood consisted of two sets of mitred gates beneath a bridge, one facing each way, so that if the canal breached, the movement of water would cause one set of gates to close, depending on which side of the bridge the breach occurred.

In common with other canals in the Midlands, it was built as a &quot;narrow&quot; canal, that is, able to take narrowboats approximately .

The canal was lock-free from the Birmingham Canal mainline at Horseley Fields Junction for , after which there were 30 locks descending to Huddlesford over a further .

===Branches===
A number of branches were constructed:

The section of the original mainline from Sneyd to Wyrley Bank, later considered a branch, was opened in 1798, some long with five locks; this was extended towards Great Wyrley in 1799, but the extension was disused by 1829. It was reopened and extended to reach Great Wyrley and serve the mines there in 1857. When completed it was long, with major wharfs at Broad Lane, Landywood and Wyrley. This branch was abandoned in 1955, under the powers of the act of abandonment.

The Birchills Branch was opened in 1798, long. In 1840 a link to the Walsall Canal was created by a flight of 8 locks at the southern end of the branch.

The Daw End Branch from Catshill Junction to limestone quarries and limeworks at Hay Head was also opened in 1800, some long with no locks. Over the years it has suffered from mining subsidence, with the result that many of the embankments are now much taller than when they were constructed. The British Transport Commission Act 1954 (2 &amp; 3 Eliz. 2. c. lv) allowed the final section to the limeworks to be abandoned. Surrounded now by Hay Head Woods, it is still partially watered, and the area has been declared a Site of Important Nature Conservation (SINC).

The Lord Hayes Branch was long with no locks; this branch was built under the 1794 act and abandoned under the British Transport Commission Act 1954.

There were three short branches at Gilpins, Slough and Sandhills, all of which are now abandoned.

===Public ownership===
In common with most British canals on which there was still reasonable amounts of traffic, the Birmingham Canal Navigations were nationalised on 1 January 1948, under the powers of the Transport Act 1947. All such waterways were initially managed by the Docks and Inland Waterways Executive, which was replaced by a board, answerable to the British Transport Commission in 1953. At that time, the only concern was commercial profitability, with no thought being given to leisure use of the canal network. An act of Parliament, the British Transport Commission Act 1954 (2 &amp; 3 Eliz. 2. c. lv) brought about the closure of the Ogley Locks section of the Wyrley and Essington from Ogley Junction to Huddleford Junction. Several of the branches were also closed at the same time. These were the Sneyd and Wyrley Bank branch, the Lord Hayes branch, and part of the Hay Head branch. The Bentley Canal closed in 1961, removing another link to the network.

The Cannock Extension Canal closed soon afterwards. In July 1960, mining subsidence resulted in the canal bed dropping by , and although the banks were rebuilt, commercial traffic stopped in 1961. The canal to the north of the A5 road was abandoned three years later. The Churchbridge connection had been abandoned in 1955, as traffic had ceased on the Hatherton Branch in 1949, again following subsidence. The Churchbridge flight of locks and most of the route north of the A5 have since been destroyed, as a result of opencast mining. Coal traffic on the branch from Anglesey Basin continued for a little longer, but finally ceased in 1967. Since the closure of the Ogley Locks section through Lichfield, the basin is the most northerly point on the Birmingham Canal Navigations to which it is possible to travel by boat.

After closure, much of the Ogley Locks Branch was sold off, and parts were built over, but many of the locks were simply filled in, with the basic structures still intact. Legislation passed in 1975 meant that area planning authorities had to prepare county structure plans. The Inland Waterways Association Midlands Branch and the BCN Society submitted plans to restore the Ogley Locks Branch to the West Midlands planning team, but the scheme was not deemed to be viable at the time. The Lichfield &amp; Hatherton Canals Restoration Trust was formed in 1989, and in 1993 published detailed proposals for the restoration of the branch, which they rebranded as the Lichfield Canal. In 2009 the engineering consultants W S Atkins produced a feasibility study for the restoration, and the Trust have made steady progress in restoring the canal.

Part of the Lord Hayes branch could be restored, as it has been identified as a suitable terminus for the reinstated Hatherton Canal in a feasibility study carried out by W S Atkins. Previously a route to reconnect the Hatherton Canal to Grove Basin on the Cannock Extension Canal had been favoured, but met with opposition from landowners and on environmental grounds, whereas the Lord Hayes route satisfies the environmental concerns, is preferable to landowners, and would reduce the number of new road bridges needed.

==Name==
The affectionate, rhyming, name &quot;Curly Wyrley&quot; is derived from the fact that the canal is a contour canal, and so it twists and turns in order to avoid any gradients, and thus the need for locks. Some of the bends have been straightened over the years, following mining subsidence.

<doc id="151912" wikidata="Q1091396" url="?curid=151912" title="All horses are the same color">
<text>All horses are the same color is a falsidical paradox that arises from a flawed use of mathematical induction to prove the statement &quot;All horses are the same color&quot;. There is no actual contradiction, as these arguments have a crucial flaw that makes them incorrect. This example was originally raised by George Pólya in a 1954 book in different terms: &quot;Are any numbers equal?&quot; or &quot;Any girls have eyes of the same color&quot;, as an exercise in mathematical induction. It has also been restated as &quot;All cows have the same color&quot;.

The &quot;horses&quot; version of the paradox was presented in 1961 in a satirical article by Joel E. Cohen. It was stated as a lemma, which in particular allowed the author to &quot;prove&quot; that Alexander the Great did not exist, and he had an infinite number of limbs.

== The argument ==

The argument is proof by induction. First, we establish a base case for one horse (formula_1). We then prove that if formula_2 horses have the same color, then formula_3 horses must also have the same color.

===Base case: One horse===
The case with just one horse is trivial. If there is only one horse in the &quot;group&quot;, then clearly all horses in that group have the same color.

===Inductive step===
Assume that formula_2 horses always are the same color. Consider a group consisting of formula_3 horses.

First, exclude one horse and look only at the other formula_2 horses; all these are the same color, since formula_2 horses always are the same color. Likewise, exclude some other horse (not identical to the one first removed) and look only at the other formula_2 horses. By the same reasoning, these, too, must also be of the same color. Therefore, the first horse that was excluded is of the same color as the non-excluded horses, who in turn are of the same color as the other excluded horse. Hence, the first horse excluded, the non-excluded horses, and the last horse excluded are all of the same color, and we have proven that:
*If formula_2 horses have the same color, then formula_3 horses will also have the same color.

We already saw in the base case that the rule (&quot;all horses have the same color&quot;) was valid for formula_1. The inductive step proved here implies that since the rule is valid for formula_1, it must also be valid for formula_13, which in turn implies that the rule is valid for formula_14 and so on.

Thus, in any group of horses, all horses must be the same color.

==Explanation==
The argument above makes the implicit assumption that the set of formula_3 horses has the size at least 3, so that the two proper subsets of horses to which the induction assumption is applied would necessarily share a common element. This is not true at the first step of induction, i.e., when .

Let the two horses be horse A and horse B. When horse A is removed, it is true that the remaining horses in the set are the same color (only horse B remains). The same is true when horse B is removed. However, the statement &quot;the first horse that was excluded is of the same color as the non-excluded horses, who in turn are of the same color as the other excluded horse&quot; is meaningless, because there are no &quot;non-excluded horses&quot; (common elements (horses) in the two sets, since each horse is excluded once). Therefore, the above proof has a logical link broken. The proof forms a falsidical paradox; it seems to show by valid reasoning something that is manifestly false, but in fact the reasoning is flawed.

<text>Many successful British television shows (particularly sitcoms and reality shows) have been remade for the American market. The amount of reworking varies, with some shows (such as &quot;All in the Family&quot;) keeping the basic situation and then adding many original features, while others have taken complete scripts verbatim (such as &quot;Amanda&#x27;s&quot;).

There are relatively few examples of American shows remade for the British market (the majority of these being game shows), and the British television audience are very accepting of the American originals while being much less accepting of British remakes (see, for instance, the failure of &quot;The Brighton Belles&quot;, the British remake of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;). The American remakes have sometimes been imported back into the United Kingdom. By contrast, original British programmes are rarely seen on the major American networks in modern times (in the 1960s the airing of British-produced programs such as &quot;The Avengers&quot; and &quot;Fireball XL5&quot; on American network TV occurred frequently) and are usually broadcast only on the Public Broadcasting Service and on cable television, especially BBC America, with only a few purely British shows having gained mainstream popularity in the United States. This list includes a number of pilots not subsequently made into series.

<text>Alia Martine Shawkat ( ; born April 18, 1989) is an American actress. She is known for her performances as Maeby Fünke in the Fox/Netflix television sitcom &quot;Arrested Development&quot; (2003–2006; 2013–2019), Dory Sief in the TBS and HBO Max dark comedy series &quot;Search Party&quot; (2016–2022), and Gertie Michaels in the 2015 horror-comedy film &quot;The Final Girls&quot;, as well as her roles in &quot;State of Grace&quot; and &quot;The Old Man&quot;. She has also guest starred as historical figures Frances Cleveland, Virginia Hall, and Alexander Hamilton on Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Drunk History&quot;.

==Early life==
Shawkat was born in Riverside, California, to Dina Shawkat (née Burke) and strip club owner Tony Shawkat. She grew up in Palm Springs. She has two brothers. Her father is from Baghdad, Iraq, and her mother is American. Her maternal grandfather was actor Paul Burke.

==Career==
From 2001 to 2002, Shawkat played Hannah in &quot;State of Grace&quot;. As Maeby Fünke, Shawkat was a regular cast member of &quot;Arrested Development&quot; for the entire run of the show from 2003 to 2019. The series received nearly universally positive reviews, with Shawkat&#x27;s performance occasionally singled out for praise. Pop-culture commentator Brian M. Palmer remarked that she was &quot;one of the brightest lights on a show populated solely by bright lights&quot;, and Scott Weinberg of eFilmCritic described her as &quot;one &quot;funny&quot; young lady.&quot; In an interview with &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; in 2010, Shawkat remarked that many of her &quot;formative moments&quot; as an actress took place on the &quot;Arrested Development&quot; set: &quot;[Show creator] Mitch Hurwitz was like a father figure to me. In a way, it was great to be around [the cast], because I feel that my understanding of comedy was able to grow really well during that time.&quot;

In 2009, Shawkat appeared in &quot;Whip It&quot; co-star Har Mar Superstar&#x27;s music video for &quot;Tall Boy&quot;, which also featured Eva Mendes and Eric Wareheim. In October 2009, it was announced that Shawkat, Har Mar, and &quot;Whip It&quot; co-star Elliot Page would produce and write a show for HBO called &quot;Stitch N&#x27; Bitch&quot;. According to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, the show &quot;follows two painfully cool hipsters as they relocate from Brooklyn&#x27;s Williamsburg neighborhood to Los Angeles&#x27; Silver Lake enclave in hopes of becoming artists—of any kind.&quot;

Shawkat, along with &quot;State of Grace&quot; and &quot;Arrested Development&quot; co-star and close friend Mae Whitman, sang guest vocals on several tracks from indie-punk band Fake Problems&#x27; 2010 album &quot;Real Ghosts Caught on Tape&quot;.
Six years after the series was canceled by Fox, filming for a revived fourth season of &quot;Arrested Development&quot; began on August 7, 2012, and Shawkat reprised her role as Maeby Fünke. The season consists of 15 new episodes, which debuted simultaneously on Netflix on May 26, 2013. Each episode focuses on one particular character, with Shawkat&#x27;s Maeby, now a high school senior, featured in episode 12, &quot;Señoritis,&quot; and appearing in several other episodes of the season.

Shawkat appears briefly in Ryan Trecartin&#x27;s 2013 art film, &quot;Center Jenny&quot;.

In 2015, Shawkat guest-starred on &quot;Broad City&quot;, portraying the romantic interest and look-alike of Ilana Glazer&#x27;s character for one episode; the two were attracted to one another due only to their similar appearances. Leading up to the episode, many had remarked on the physical similarities Shawkat and Glazer bear to one another.

Shawkat starred in the lead role of Dory Sief on the TBS comedy &quot;Search Party&quot;, which premiered on November 21, 2016 and moved to HBO Max in 2019 before concluding with its fifth and final season in January 2022. Alongside her acting role on this project, Shawkat produced 30 episodes and directed 1 from 2016 to 2021.

In 2019, Shawkat starred in the film &quot;Animals&quot; (directed by Australian director Sophie Hyde) as Tyler, a high-living American partier in Dublin. It is a film about a friendship that changes after Laura (played by Holliday Grainger) gets engaged to her teetotalling boyfriend. Shawkat said that she had never played a character like Tyler before, and comparatively found her previous characters more relatable. She was &quot;excited to play someone who was so fun, but so damaged&quot;.

==Personal life==
When not acting, Shawkat enjoys singing, drawing, and painting. She occasionally sings in jazz bars, though she only sings jazz standards; her grandfather taught her many of the songs she knows. At one point, Shawkat attempted to learn welding, hoping to make metal sculptures. She considers it essential for her to pursue different forms of art, stating, &quot;They feed each other. If I didn&#x27;t have the other ones, I don&#x27;t think I could just act.&quot; Shawkat is bisexual.

<text>A T-shirt (also spelled tee shirt, or tee for short) is a style of fabric shirt named after the T shape of its body and sleeves. Traditionally, it has short sleeves and a round neckline, known as a &quot;crew neck&quot;, which lacks a collar. T-shirts are generally made of stretchy, light, and inexpensive fabric and are easy to clean. The T-shirt evolved from undergarments used in the 19th century and, in the mid-20th century, transitioned from undergarments to general-use casual clothing. 

T-shirts are typically made of cotton textile in a stockinette or jersey knit, which has a distinctively pliable texture compared to shirts made of woven cloth. Some modern versions have a body made from a continuously knitted tube, produced on a circular knitting machine, such that the torso has no side seams. The manufacture of T-shirts has become highly automated and may include cutting fabric with a laser or a water jet.

T-shirts are inexpensive to produce and are often part of fast fashion, leading to outsized sales of T-shirts compared to other attire. For example, two billion T-shirts are sold worldwide each year, and the average person in Sweden buys nine T-shirts a year. Production processes vary but can be environmentally intensive and include the environmental impact caused by their materials, such as cotton, which uses large amounts of water and pesticides.

==History==
Simple, T-shaped top garments have been a part of human clothing since ancient times; garments similar to the T-shirt worn earlier in history are generally called tunics.

The modern T-shirt evolved from undergarments used in the 19th century. First, the one-piece &quot;union suit&quot; underwear was cut into separate top and bottom garments, with the top long enough to tuck under the waistband of the bottoms. With and without buttons, they were adopted by miners and stevedores during the late 19th century as a convenient covering for hot environments.

In 1913, the U.S. Navy first issued them as undergarments. These were a crew-necked, short-sleeved, white cotton undershirt to be worn under a uniform. It became common for sailors and Marines in work parties, the early submarines, and tropical climates to remove their uniform jacket, thus wearing (and soiling) only the undershirt. They soon became popular as a bottom layer of clothing for workers in various industries, including agriculture. The T-shirt was easily fitted, easily cleaned, and inexpensive; for these reasons, it became the shirt of choice for young boys. Boys&#x27; shirts were made in various colors and patterns. The word &quot;T-shirt&quot; became part of American English by the 1920s, and appeared in the &quot;Merriam-Webster Dictionary&quot;.

By the Great Depression, the T-shirt was often the default garment to be worn when doing farm or ranch chores, as well as other times when modesty called for a torso covering but conditions called for lightweight fabrics. Following World War II, it was worn by Navy men as undergarments; gradually, veterans could be seen wearing their uniform trousers with their T-shirts as casual clothing. The shirts became even more popular in the 1950s after Marlon Brando wore one in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, and they finally achieved status as fashionable, stand-alone, outerwear garments. Often boys wore them while doing chores and playing outside, eventually opening up the idea of wearing them as general-purpose casual clothing.

Printed T-shirts were in limited use by 1942 when an Air Corps Gunnery School T-shirt appeared on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine. In the 1960s, printed T-shirts gained popularity for self-expression as well as for advertisements, protests, and souvenirs.

Current versions are available in many different designs and fabrics, and styles include crew-neck and V-neck shirts. T-shirts are among the most worn garments of clothing used today. T-shirts are especially popular with branding for companies or merchandise, as they are inexpensive to make and purchase.

==Trends==
T-shirts were originally worn as undershirts, but are now worn frequently as the only piece of clothing on the top half of the body, other than possibly a brassiere or, rarely, a waistcoat (vest). T-shirts have also become a medium for self-expression and advertising, with any imaginable combination of words, art and photographs on display.

A T-shirt typically extends to the waist. Variants of the T-shirt, such as the V-neck, have been developed. Hip hop fashion calls for &quot;tall-T&quot; shirts which may extend down to the knees. A similar item is the T-shirt dress or T-dress, a dress-length T-shirt that can be worn without pants. Long T-shirts are also sometimes worn by women as nightgowns. A 1990s trend in women&#x27;s clothing involved tight-fitting cropped T-shirts, called crop tops, short enough to reveal the midriff. Another less popular trend is wearing a short-sleeved T-shirt of a contrasting color over a long-sleeved T-shirt, which is known as &quot;layering&quot;. Tight-fitting T-shirts are called &quot;fitted&quot;, &quot;tailored&quot; or &quot;baby doll&quot; T-shirts.

The rise of social media and video sharing sites led to the growth of tutorials on DIY T-shirt projects. These videos typically provide instructions on how to modify an old shirt into a new, more fashionable form.

===Expressive messages===
Since the 1960s, T-shirts have flourished as a form of personal expression. Screen printed T-shirts have been a standard form of marketing for major American consumer products, such as Coca-Cola and Mickey Mouse, since the 1970s. They have also been commonly used to commemorate an event or make a political or personal statement. Since the 1990s, it has become common practice for companies of all sizes to produce T-shirts with their corporate logos or messages as part of their overall advertising campaigns. Since the late 1980s and especially the 1990s, T-shirts with prominent designer-name logos have become popular, especially with teenagers and young adults. These garments allow consumers to flaunt their taste for designer brands in an inexpensive way, in addition to being decorative. Examples of designer T-shirt branding include Calvin Klein, FUBU, Ralph Lauren, American Apparel, and The Gap. These examples also include representations of rock bands, among other obscure pop-culture references. Licensed T-shirts are also extremely popular. Movie and TV T-shirts can have images of the actors, logos, and funny quotations from the movie or TV show. Often, the most popular T-shirts are those that characters wore in the film itself (e.g., Bubba Gump from &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; and Vote For Pedro from &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot;).

In the early 1980s, designer Katharine Hamnett pioneered outsize T-shirts with large-print slogans. The early first decade of the 21st century saw the renewed popularity of T-shirts with slogans and designs, with a strong inclination to humor and/or irony. The trend only increased later that decade, embraced by celebrities such as Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, and reflected back on them, too (&#x27;Team Aniston&#x27;). The political and social statements that T-shirts often display have become, since the first decade of the 21st century, one of the reasons that they have so deeply permeated different levels of culture and society. These statements range from completely harmless one to statements or quotes that may be found to be offensive, shocking, or pornographic to some. Despite this, or perhaps due to it, companies like T-Shirt Hell (a T-shirt store known for offensive and shocking messages) and various other organizations have caught on to the statement-making trend (whether offensive or otherwise), including chain and independent stores, websites, schools, clubs, and groups of all kinds, with some even incorporating said trends into their respective business models.

An early widespread T-shirt message that demonstrated their popularity among tourists was the humorous phrase &quot;I went to _____ and all I got was this lousy T-shirt.&quot; (Examples include &quot;My parents went to Las Vegas and all I got was this lousy T-shirt.&quot;)

T-shirt exchange is an activity where people trade the T-shirts that they are wearing.

Artists like Bill Beckley, Glen Baldridge and Peter Klashorst use T-shirts in their work. Models such as Victoria Beckham and Gisele Bündchen wore T-shirts through the 2000s. Paris Fashion Week 2014 featured a grunge style T-shirt.

==Decoration==

In the early 1950s, several companies based in Miami, Florida started decorating T-shirts with different resort names and various characters. The first to do so on an extensive scale was Tropix Togs, founded by Sam Kantor. After meeting Walt Disney in a Miami airport in 1976, Kantor&#x27;s company became the original licensee for Walt Disney characters including Mickey Mouse and Davy Crockett. The T-shirts were sold when Walt Disney World first opened.

Later, other companies expanded into the T-shirt printing business, including Sherry Manufacturing Company, also based in Miami. Founded in 1948 by owner Quentin H. Sandler, Sherry initially screen printed souvenir tourist scarves. It quickly evolved into one of the largest US screen printed resort and licensed apparel companies, and by 2018, was running automatic screen print presses and producing up to 20,000 T-shirts each day.

In the 1960s, the ringer T-shirt appeared and became a staple fashion for youth and rock-n-rollers. Ringer T-shirts are a solid-color shirt with bands of a second color around the collar and the lower edges of the sleeves, with or without an additional front decoration.

The 1960s also saw the emergence of tie-dyeing and screen printing on the basic T-shirt, which became a medium for wearable art, commercial advertising, souvenir messages, and protest art messages. Psychedelic art poster designer Warren Dayton pioneered several political, protest, and pop-culture art pieces, printed large and in color on T-shirts featuring images of Cesar Chavez, political cartoons, and other cultural icons in an article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; magazine in late 1969 (ironically, the printing clothing company quickly cancelled the experimental line, fearing there would not be a market).

In the late 1960s, Richard Ellman, Robert Tree, Bill Kelly, and Stanley Mouse set up the Monster Company in Mill Valley, California to produce fine art designs expressly for T-shirts. Their designs often featured emblems and motifs associated with the Grateful Dead and marijuana culture. Additionally, one of the most popular symbols to emerge from the political turmoil of the 1960s was the T-shirt bearing the face of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara.

Today, many notable and memorable T-shirts produced in the 1970s have become ensconced in pop culture. Examples include bright yellow happy face, Rolling Stones &quot;tongue and lips&quot; logo, and Milton Glaser&#x27;s iconic &quot;I ♥ N Y” designs. In the mid-1980s, the white T-shirt became fashionable after the actor Don Johnson wore it with an Armani suit in the &quot;Miami Vice&quot; series.

=== V-Neck ===
A V-neck T-shirt has a V-shaped neckline, as opposed to the round neckline of the more common crew neck shirt (also called a U-neck). V-necks were introduced so that the neckline of the shirt does not show when worn beneath an outer shirt.

===Screen printing===
The most common form of commercial T-shirt decoration is screen printing, in which a design is separated into individual colors. Plastisol or water-based inks are applied to the shirt through mesh screens partially coated with an emulsion, which limits the areas where ink is deposited. In most commercial T-shirt printing, a limited number of spot colors (typically one to four) are used to print the design. To achieve a wider color spectrum with a limited number of colors, process printing (using only cyan, magenta, yellow and black ink) or the simulated process (using only white, black, red, green, blue, and gold ink) is effective. Process printing is best suited for light-colored shirts while the simulated process is best suited for dark-colored shirts.

The invention of plastisol in 1959 provided a more durable and stretchable ink than water-based inks, allowing much greater variety in T-shirt designs. Very few companies continue to use water-based inks on their shirts; the majority prefer plastisol because it allows printing on varying colors without the need for color adjustment at the art level.

Specialty inks trend in and out of fashion and include shimmer, puff, discharge, and chino-based inks. A metallic foil can be heat pressed and stamped onto any plastisol ink. When combined with shimmer ink, metallics give a mirror-like effect wherever the previously screened plastisol ink was applied. Specialty inks are more expensive to purchase and screen, and tend to appear on boutique garments.

Other methods of T-shirt decoration airbrushing, appliqué, embroidery, impressing or embossing, and the ironing on of either flock lettering, heat transfers, or dye-sublimation transfers. Laser printers, using special toners containing sublimation dyes, can print designs on plain paper which can then be permanently heat-transferred to T-shirts.

In the 1980s, thermochromatic dyes were used to produce T-shirts that changed color when subjected to heat; Global Hypercolour was one of the most popular youth brands to do so in the US and UK. One downside of color-change garments is that the dyes are easily damaged by washing in warm water, and can also stain other clothes during washing.

===Tie-dye===
Tie-dye originated in India, Japan and Africa as early as the sixth century. Forms of tie-dye include Bandhani (the oldest known technique), used in Indian cultures, and Shibori, primarily used in Japanese cultures. It was not until the 1960s that tie-dye was introduced to America during the hippie movement.

===Heat transfer vinyl (HTV)===
Another form of T-shirt decoration is heat transfer vinyl, also called HTV. HTV is a polyurethane material that allows apparel designers to create unique layered designs using a specialized software program. Once the design is created, it is then cut through the material using a vinyl cutter (or Cut n Press) machine.

There are dozens of different colors available, as well as glitter, reflective, and now even unique patterns (such as mermaid skin) which come in rolls and sheets.

After the design is cut, there is a process called “weeding” whereby the areas that do not represent the design are picked away from the transfer sheet and removed so that the intended design remains. HTV is typically smooth to the touch and does not feel rubbery or stiff. The edges are typically clean-cut and produce high contrast.

Designers can also create multiple color designs, or multi-layered designs, using HTV. This process is done in the design software before the design is sent to the cutter for the different materials. A heat press is then used to apply pressure and heat to the vinyl so that the material permanently adheres to the garment. The temperature and pressure vary according to manufacturer specifications.

=== Dye-sublimation printing ===
Dye-sublimation printing is a widely used direct-to-garment digital printing technology using full-color artwork to transfer images to polyester and polymer-coated substrate based T-shirts. Dye sublimation (also commonly referred to as all-over printing) came into widespread use in the 21st century, enabling some previously impossible designs. The technology allows unlimited colors using large CMYK printers with special paper and ink, unlike screen printing which requires screens for each color of the design. All-over print T-shirts have solved the problem with color fading, and vibrancy is greater than most standard printing methods, but the process requires synthetic fabrics for the ink to take hold. The key feature of dye-sublimated clothing is that the design is not printed on top of the garment, but permanently dyed into the threads of the shirt, ensuring that it will never fade.

Dye sublimation is economically viable for small-quantity printing; the unit cost is similar for short or long production runs. Screen printing has higher setup costs, requiring large numbers to be produced to be cost-effective, and the unit cost is higher.

Sublimation uses heat and pressure to change solid ink into a gas without first passing through a liquid phase. The design is first produced in a computer image file format such as jpg, gif, png. It is then printed on a purpose-made computer printer (, most commonly Epson or Ricoh brands) using large heat presses to vaporize the ink directly into the fabric. By mid-2012, the method had become widely used for T-shirts.

=== Other methods ===
Other methods of decorating shirts include using paints, markers, fabric transfer crayons, dyes and spray paint. Some techniques that can be used include sponging, stenciling, , , screen printing, bleaching, and many more. Some new T-shirt creators have used designs with multiple advanced techniques, which includes using glow-in-the-dark inks, heat-sensitive fabrics, foil printing and all-over printing. Fashion designer Robert Geller created a T-shirt collection featuring oversized graphic T-shirts made from extremely soft jersey materials. Designer Alexander Wang released variations of T-shirts from oversized scoop necks, tanks to striped, slouchy rayon jerseys. Terence Koh T-shirts featured an upside down portrait with a real bullet hole in the head.

<text>The Emmy Awards, or Emmys, are an extensive range of awards for artistic and technical merit for the television industry. A number of annual Emmy Award ceremonies are held throughout the year, each with their own set of rules and award categories. The two events that receive the most media coverage are the Primetime Emmy Awards and the Daytime Emmy Awards, which recognize outstanding work in American primetime and daytime entertainment programming, respectively. Other notable U.S. national Emmy events include the Children&#x27;s &amp; Family Emmy Awards for children&#x27;s and family-oriented television programming, the Sports Emmy Awards for sports programming, News &amp; Documentary Emmy Awards for news and documentary shows, and the Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Awards and the Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards for technological and engineering achievements. Regional Emmy Awards are also presented throughout the country at various times through the year, recognizing excellence in local television. In addition, the International Emmy Awards honor excellence in TV programming produced and initially aired outside the United States.

The Emmy statuette, depicting a winged woman holding an atom, is named after &quot;immy&quot;, an informal term for the image orthicon tube that was common in early television cameras. It is considered one of the four major annual American entertainment awards, along with the Grammy for music, the Oscar (Academy Award) for film, and the Tony for Broadway theater.

The Emmys are presented by three related, but separate, organizations: the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences (ATAS), the National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences (NATAS), and the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (IATAS). Each of these three organizations is responsible for administering a particular set of Emmy Award ceremonies. The ATAS first awarded Emmys in 1949 to honor shows produced in the Los Angeles area before it became a national event in the 1950s to honor programs aired nationwide. Over the next two decades, the ATAS, the NATAS, and the IATAS expanded the award to honor other sectors of the TV industry.

==History==
The Los Angeles–based Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences (ATAS) established the Emmy Award as part of an image-building and public relations opportunity. The first Emmy ceremony took place on January 25, 1949, at the Hollywood Athletic Club, but solely to honor shows produced and aired locally in the Los Angeles area. Shirley Dinsdale has the distinction of receiving the first Emmy Award for Most Outstanding Television Personality, during that first awards ceremony. The term &quot;Emmy&quot; derives from &quot;Immy&quot;, the television industry slang for a TV camera image orthicon tube.

In the 1950s, the ATAS expanded the Emmys into a national event to honor shows aired nationwide on broadcast television. In 1955, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS) was formed in New York City as a sister organization to serve members on the East Coast. While the ATAS maintained a separate ceremony to honor shows aired locally in the Los Angeles area, the NATAS established regional chapters throughout the rest of the United States, with each one developing their own local Emmy ceremony for local programming.

Originally, there was only one Emmy event held per year to honor shows nationally broadcast in the United States. In 1974, the first Daytime Emmy ceremony was held to specifically honor achievement in national daytime programming. Other area-specific Emmy events soon followed. Also, the International Emmy Awards, honoring television programs produced and initially aired outside the U.S., was established in the early 1970s. Meanwhile, all Emmys awarded prior to the emergence of these separate, area-specific events are listed along with the Primetime Emmy Awards in the ATAS&#x27;s official records.

In 1977, due to various conflicts, the ATAS and the NATAS broke ties. They agreed to share ownership of the Emmy statue and trademark, with each responsible for administering a specific set of award events. There was an exception regarding the Engineering Awards (those honoring individuals, companies, or scientific or technical organizations in recognition of significant developments and contributions to the engineering and technological aspects of television): The NATAS continues to administer the Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Awards, while the ATAS holds the separate Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards.

With the rise of cable television in the 1980s, cable programs first became eligible for the Primetime Emmys in 1988, and the Daytime Emmys in 1989. In 2011 ABC cancelled the soap operas &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, and sold the two shows&#x27; licensing rights to the production company Prospect Park so they could be continued on streaming television; this prompted NATAS to create a new Daytime Emmys category for the 2013 ceremony to honor such web-only series. The ATAS also began accepting original online-only streaming television programs in 2013.

In December 2021, the ATAS and the NATAS announced a major realignment of the national Emmy Award ceremonies in response to the growth of streaming television programs, blurring the lines in determining which shows fall under Daytime or Primetime. Each of the ceremonies&#x27; scopes would now revolve around factors such as the themes and frequency of such programming, rather than dayparts. Among the major changes, daytime dramas would remain in the Daytime Emmys but most other scripted dramas and comedies would move to the Primetime Emmys, all children&#x27;s programming would move to the newly created Children&#x27;s &amp; Family Emmys that the NATAS previously announced in November 2021, morning shows would move from the Daytime Emmys to the News &amp; Documentary Emmys, and talk shows would now be divided between the Daytime and Primetime Emmys based on &quot;format and style characteristics reflective of current programming in the daytime or late night space&quot;. The realignment of game shows and instructional programming categories was determined later in 2023.

==Statuette==
The Emmy statuette, depicting a winged woman holding an atom, was designed by television engineer Louis McManus, who used his wife as the model. The ATAS rejected forty-seven proposals before settling on McManus&#x27;s design in 1948. The statuette &quot;has since become the symbol of the TV Academy&#x27;s goal of supporting and uplifting the art and science of television: The wings represent the muse of art; the atom the electron of science.&quot;

When deciding a name for the award, ATAS founder Syd Cassyd originally suggested &quot;Ike&quot;, the nickname for the television iconoscope tube. &quot;Ike&quot; was also the popular nickname of World War II hero and future U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and the ATAS members wanted something unique. Finally, television engineer and the third academy president Harry Lubcke suggested the name &quot;Immy&quot;, a term commonly used for the image orthicon tube used in the early cameras. After &quot;Immy&quot; was chosen, it was later feminized to Emmy to match their female statuette.

The weight and dimensions of the Emmy statuette vary among the events. Each Primetime Emmy statuette weighs , and is made of copper, nickel, silver, and gold. The statue stands tall with a base diameter of and weight of . The Regional Emmy Award statuette is tall with a base diameter of and weight of . Each takes five and a half hours to make and is handled with white gloves to prevent fingerprints. The Primetime Emmy statues are manufactured by R.S. Owens &amp; Company based in Chicago, Illinois, which was also charged with manufacturing the Academy Award statues until 2016, when AMPAS switched to Polich Tallix in Walden, New York. The Regional Emmy Awards are made by both R.S. Owens &amp; Company and Society Awards, a New York–based company that also makes the Golden Globe Awards.

As its trademark owners, the ATAS and the NATAS hold firm rules on the use of the &quot;Emmy&quot; image as well as its name. For example, the Emmy statuette must always appear facing left. Any copyright notice for the statue should read &quot;ATAS/NATAS&quot;, listing both academies. Academy members must also obtain permission to use the statue image or name for promotional uses even though they are winners of the award. Furthermore, DVDs of Emmy-winning shows may reference the fact that they received an Emmy, but cannot use the statue image unless it is capable of being removed from all copies one year after the award is presented.

== Types ==

Various Emmy events competitions are held annually throughout the calendar year, ranging from honoring nationally televised shows to regionally and locally produced programs. Each event has its own set of award categories, nominating and voting procedures, and rules regarding voting committees, among others. It is not uncommon for one event to have some of the same category names that another event uses. (e.g. &quot;Primetime&quot; Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series and &quot;Daytime&quot; Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series).

A show that enters one of the Emmy events generally cannot also be entered into any of the others. For example, syndicated shows whose air times vary between media markets may be eligible for both the Daytime and Primetime Emmys, but cannot enter in both. In general, a show is considered national if it reaches more than 50 percent of U.S. households; programs that do not reach at least 50 percent of the country may enter into the Regional Emmys instead. Streaming television shows are treated similarly to syndicated shows: they must be available for downloading or streaming by more than 50 percent of the US national market to be eligible in one of the national Emmy competitions, and they can only enter into one of those national Emmy ceremonies. And a primetime show that is a co-production between U.S. and overseas companies might be eligible for both the Primetime and International Emmys, but also cannot enter in both.

Regardless of which area-specific competitions in which one wins an Emmy, all winners are called an &quot;Emmy Winner&quot;.

===Primetime===


The Primetime Emmys are presented in recognition of excellence in American primetime television programming. Ceremonies generally are held in mid-September, on the Sunday before the official start of the fall television season, and are currently broadcast in rotation among the ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox networks, each network taking turns to air the ceremony every four years.

Some award categories presented to behind-the-scenes personnel such as art directors, costume designers, cinematographers, casting directors, and sound designers are awarded at a separate Creative Arts Emmys ceremony held a few days earlier.

The Primetime Emmys are run and voted on by members of the ATAS. For most categories, members from each of the ATAS&#x27;s branches vote around June to determine the nominees only in their respective categories. All members can vote for nominations in the best program categories. The final voting to determine the winners is held in August.

===Daytime===

The Daytime Emmy Awards, generally held in May or June, are presented in recognition of excellence in American daytime television programming. The first daytime-themed Emmy Awards were given out at the primetime ceremony in 1972, but the first separate awards show made just for daytime programming was not held until 1974.

Like the Primetime Emmys, a separate Creative Arts Emmy ceremony is also held a few days earlier to honor the behind-the-scenes personnel working in daytime television.

The Daytime Emmys are run and voted on by members of the NATAS. Voting is done by peer judging panels. Any active member of the NATAS who has national credits for at least two years and within the last five years is eligible to be a judge. Depending on the category, voting is done using either a ratings score criteria or a preferential scoring system. All the drama acting categories have an additional preliminary voting round called the pre-nominations, where one or two actors from each show is selected to then move on and be considered for the primary nominations for the awards.

===Sports===
The Sports Emmy Awards are presented by the NATAS for excellence in sports programming. The awards ceremony takes place every Spring, usually sometime in the last two weeks in April or the first week in May and is held on a Monday night in New York City.

Voting is done by peer judging panels. The NATAS solicits anybody with significant experience in national sports production to serve as judges. The panels are organized so that they only have one representative from each corporate entity (i.e. Paramount Global, Disney, NBCUniversal, Fox Corporation, Warner Bros. Discovery etc.) Most categories only have a single voting round using preferential scoring system. The top 5 entries in each category are announced as the nominations, and then the top entry is announced as the Emmy winner later at the awards ceremony.

===News and documentary===
The News &amp; Documentary Emmy Awards are presented by the NATAS for excellence in national news and documentary programming. The awards ceremony takes place every fall.

Voting is done by peer judging panels. The NATAS solicits anybody with significant experience in national news or documentary reporting or production to serve as judges. Most categories have two voting rounds, with separate judging panels in each round. The top entries in each category are announced as the nominations, and then the top entry is announced as the Emmy winner later at the awards ceremony.

=== Children&#x27;s and family ===

On November 17, 2021, the NATAS announced that it would begin to present the Children&#x27;s &amp; Family Emmys Awards beginning in 2022, for excellence in children&#x27;s and family television. Previously, most award categories for children&#x27;s and family television programs fell under the scope of the Daytime Emmys, while those programs that aired primarily in primetime fell under the Primetime Emmys. The NATAS stated that this new ceremony was needed due to an explosive growth of children&#x27;s and family programming within the past few years. Secondly, the ATAS retired its primetime children&#x27;s television categories in 2020, agreeing with the NATAS to move all such award categories to the Daytime Emmys, citing that the proliferation of streaming services had created confusion over whether children&#x27;s programs should fall under the Daytime or Primetime awards.

===Engineering===
The Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards presented by the ATAS and the Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Awards presented by the NATAS are two separate competitions that honor individuals, companies, or to scientific or technical organizations in recognition of significant developments and contributions to the engineering and technological aspects of television. Generally, the NATAS&#x27;s Technology &amp; Engineering Emmys ceremony is held in January, while the ATAS&#x27;s Primetime Engineering Emmys are presented in October.

Each academy has its own separate panel of highly qualified, experienced engineers in the television industry to determine their respective award recipients. Among the ATAS&#x27;s Engineering Emmy Award repertoire is the Philo T. Farnsworth Award, given to honor companies who have significantly affected the state of television and broadcast engineering over a long period of time.

===Regional===

There are 20 regional chapters located across the United States that each conduct regional awards to recognize excellence in all the regional television markets, including state to state programming as well as local news and locally produced shows. Nineteen of the regional chapters are affiliated with the NATAS, while the Los Angeles–based ATAS acts as the regional chapter serving the Los Angeles area.

In general, a show is considered regional if it does not reach more than 50 percent of U.S. households; programs that reach more than 50 percent of the country must enter into one of the national Emmy competitions instead.

The Regional Emmys are essential in helping NATAS and ATAS honor the works of deserving individuals in local TV through a regional outreach. Like the national awards, each region goes through their own rigorous nomination and voting procedures. Committees are formed to review entries for eligibility and high standards. Once accepted, each entry goes before different review committees, and their votes are cast to determine the final nominees. The final votes are then calculated by certified accounting firms within each region.

Regardless of winning on a national or regional level, all recipients are Emmy Award winners. Donn Johnson, president of the Pacific Southwest chapter said in 2018: &quot;The Emmy Award is considered the most prestigious award a television professional can receive&quot;.

Originally, each Regional Emmy Awards ceremony primarily focused on only honoring individuals in local news programming. The regionals have since been expanded to encompass all locally and state to state-produced shows that receive less than fifty percent of the country&#x27;s viewing audience.

===International===

The International Emmy Awards recognizes excellence in TV programming that is produced initially outside the United States. They have been presented annually by the IATAS since 1973. The award ceremony generally takes place in November in New York City.

In general, any non-U.S. organization or individual (such as a network, a local or regional television station, producer, director, or writer) may submit a program, regardless of whether they are a member of the IATAS. For shows that are co-produced between U.S. and foreign production companies, they may be eligible if they initially aired outside of the U.S., or if their broadcast dates were within a few days of each other. A program that enters into the international competition cannot also be entered into any of the domestic ones.

===Student===

The College Television Awards are presented by the ATAS in recognition of excellence in college student-produced works. College students nationwide can submit productions and receive recognition in such categories as Comedy, Documentary, Drama, Music, Newscasts, and Series. Entries are first judged by members of the ATAS specializing in each respective field. Winners are then selected by Blue Ribbon Panels. Any work submitted must include a form signed from a faculty advisor to verify that it was produced for a school related group, project, or class.

Similarly, the National Student Production Awards are presented by the NATAS in recognition of excellence in high school student-produced works. High school students nationwide can submit productions and receive recognition in news, craft and programming categories.

===Governors and trustees===
The Governors Award is the highest award presented by the ATAS, honoring the achievements of an individual, company or organization whose works stand out with the immediacy of current achievement.

The Trustees Award is the highest award presented by NATAS, honoring the unusual or enduring achievements of an individual.

===Humanitarian and public service===
The Bob Hope Humanitarian Award is awarded by the ATAS Board of Governors to an individual in the industry whose humanitarian work has a lasting impact on society.

The Public Service Award is for public service announcements and programming to &quot;advance the common good&quot;.

==Criticism==
Some advocates of gender equality and non-binary people have criticized the separation of male and female acting categories in the Emmys, Academy Awards, and Tony Awards. Though some commentators worry that gender discrimination would cause men to dominate unsegregated categories, other categories are unsegregated. The Grammy Awards went gender-neutral in 2012, while the Daytime Emmy Awards introduced a single Outstanding Younger Performer in a Drama Series category in 2019 to replace their two gender-specific younger actor and actress categories.

<text>Aquatic plants also referred to as hydrophytes are vascular plants and non-vascular plants that have adapted to live in aquatic environments (saltwater or freshwater). In lakes, rivers and wetlands, aquatic vegetations provide cover for aquatic animals such as fish, amphibians and aquatic insects, create substrate for benthic invertebrates, produce oxygen via photosynthesis, and serve as food for some herbivorous wildlife. Familiar examples of aquatic plants include waterlily, lotus, duckweeds, mosquito fern, floating heart, water milfoils, mare&#x27;s tail, water lettuce, water hyacinth, and algae.

Aquatic plants require special adaptations for prolonged inundation in water, and for floating at the water surface. The most common adaptation is the presence of lightweight internal packing cells, aerenchyma, but floating leaves and finely dissected leaves are also common. Aquatic plants only thrive in water or in soil that is frequently saturated, and are therefore a common component of swamps and marshlands.

== Evolution ==
Aquatic plants have adapted to live in either freshwater or saltwater. Aquatic vascular plants have originated on multiple occasions in different plant families; they can be ferns or angiosperms (including both monocots and dicots). The only angiosperms capable of growing completely submerged in seawater are the seagrasses. Examples are found in genera such as &quot;Thalassia&quot; and &quot;Zostera&quot;. An aquatic origin of angiosperms is supported by the evidence that several of the earliest known fossil angiosperms were aquatic. Aquatic plants are phylogenetically well dispersed across the angiosperms, with at least 50 independent origins, although they comprise less than 2% of the angiosperm species. Archaefructus represents one of the oldest, most complete angiosperm fossils which is around 125 million years old. These plants require special adaptations for living submerged in water or floating at the surface.

== Morphology ==
Fully submerged aquatic plants have little need for stiff or woody tissue as they are able to maintain their position in the water using buoyancy typically from gas filled lacunaa or turgid Aerenchyma cells. When removed from the water, such plants are typically limp and lose turgor rapidly.

Those living in rivers do, however, need sufficient structural xylem to avoid being damaged by fast flowing water and they also need strong mechanisms of attachment to avoid being uprooted by river flow.

Many fully submerged plants have finely dissected leaves, probably to reduce drag in rivers and to provide a much increased surface area for interchange of minerals and gasses.
Some species of plants such as &quot;Ranunculus aquatilis&quot; have two different leaf forms with finely dissected leaves that are fully submerged and entire leaves on the surface of the water.

Some still-water plants can alter their position in the water column at different seasons. One notable example is &quot;Water soldier&quot; which rests as a rootless rosette on the bottom of the water body but slowly floats to the surface in late Spring so that its inflorescence can emerge into the air. While it is ascending through the water column it produces roots and vegetative daughter plants by means of rhizomes. When flowering is complete, the plant descends through the water column and the roots atrophy.

In floating aquatic angiosperms, the leaves have evolved to only have stomata on the top surface to make use of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Gas exchange primarily occurs through the top surface of the leaf due to the position of the stomata, and the stomata are in a permanently open state. Due to their aquatic surroundings, the plants are not at risk of losing water through the stomata and therefore face no risk of dehydration. For carbon fixation, some aquatic angiosperms are able to uptake CO2 from bicarbonate in the water, a trait that does not exist in terrestrial plants. Angiosperms that use - can keep levels satisfactory, even in basic environments with low carbon levels. The many possible classifications of aquatic plants are based upon morphology.

== Classification ==
Aquatic plants are either aquatic macrophytes or aquatic microphytes. Aquatic macrophytes are hydrophytes that are large enough to be seen with the naked eye. Aquatic microphytes are hydrophytes that cannot be seen with the naked eye; they are microscopic.

=== Classification of Macrophytes ===
Based on growth form, macrophytes can be characterized as:

* Emergent
* Submerged
** Rooted: rooted to the substrate
** Unrooted: free-floating in the water column
* Floating-leaved
* Free-floating

==== Emergent ====

* An emergent plant is one which grows in water but pierces the surface so that it is partially exposed to air. Collectively, such plants are emergent vegetation.
** This habit may have developed because the leaves can photosynthesize more efficiently in air and competition from submerged plants but often, the main aerial feature is the flower and the related reproductive process. The emergent habit permits pollination by wind or by flying insects.
** There are many species of emergent plants, among them, the reed (&quot;Phragmites&quot;), &quot;Cyperus papyrus&quot;, &quot;Typha&quot; species, flowering rush and wild rice species. Some species, such as purple loosestrife, may grow in water as emergent plants but they are capable of flourishing in fens or simply in damp ground.

==== Submergent ====

* Submerged macrophytes completely grow under water with roots attached to the substrate (rooted submerged) (e.g. &quot;Myriophyllum spicatum&quot;) or without any root system (unrooted submerged) (e.g. &quot;Ceratophyllum demersum&quot;). They can also grow up to the water&#x27;s surface. Helophytes are plants that grow partly submerged in marshes and regrow from buds below the water surface. Fringing stands of tall vegetation by water basins and rivers may include helophytes. Examples include stands of &quot;Equisetum fluviatile&quot;, &quot;Glyceria maxima&quot;, &quot;Hippuris vulgaris&quot;, &quot;Sagittaria&quot;, &quot;Carex&quot;, &quot;Schoenoplectus&quot;, &quot;Sparganium&quot;, &quot;Acorus&quot;, yellow flag (&quot;Iris pseudacorus&quot;), &quot;Typha&quot; and &quot;Phragmites australis&quot;.
* Although seaweeds, which are large multicellular marine algae, have similar ecological functions to aquatic plants such as seagrass, they lack the specialized root/rhizoid system of plants. Instead, seaweeds have holdfasts that only serve as anchors and have no absorptive functions.

==== Floating-leaved ====

* Floating-leaved macrophytes have root systems attached to the substrate or bottom of the body of water and with leaves that float on the water surface. Common floating leaved macrophytes are water lilies (family Nymphaeaceae), pondweeds (family Potamogetonaceae).

==== Free-floating ====

* floating freely on the water&#x27;s surface.
* Free-floating macrophytes are found suspended on water surface with their root not attached to the substrate, sediment, or bottom of the water body. They are easily blown by air and provide breeding ground for mosquitoes. Examples include &quot;Pistia&quot; spp. commonly called water lettuce, water cabbage or Nile cabbage.

=== Classification of Microphytes ===
Microphytes can be characterized as:

* Phytoplankton
* Periphyton

==== Phytoplankton ====

* also known as microscopic algae. Free-floating; drifting with water currents.

==== Periphyton ====

* a microphyte that lives and grows on the surface of rooted aquatic plants.

=== Additional Morphological Classifications ===
The many possible classifications of aquatic plants are based upon morphology. One example has six groups as follows:
* Amphiphytes: plants that are adapted to live either submerged or on land
* Elodeids: stem plants that complete their entire lifecycle submerged, or with only their flowers above the waterline
* Isoetids: rosette plants that complete their entire lifecycle submerged
* Helophytes: plants rooted in the bottom, but with leaves above the waterline
* Nymphaeids: plants rooted in the bottom, but with leaves floating on the water surface
* Neuston: vascular plants that float freely in the water

== Aquatic Adaptations ==

=== Terrestrial plants in aquatic environments ===
Terrestrial plants may undergo physiological changes when submerged due to flooding. When submerged, new leaf growth has been found to have thinner leaves and thinner cell walls than the leaves on the plant that grew while above water, along with oxygen levels being higher in the portion of the plant grown underwater versus the sections that grew in their terrestrial environment. This is considered a form of phenotypic plasticity as the plant, once submerged, experiences changes in morphology better suited to their new aquatic environment. However, while some terrestrial plants may be able to adapt in the short-term to an aquatic habitat, it may not be possible to reproduce underwater, especially if the plant usually relies on terrestrial pollinators.

=== Buoyancy ===
Due to their environment, aquatic plants experience buoyancy which counteracts their weight. Because of this, their cell covering are far more flexible and soft, due to a lack of pressure that terrestrial plants experience. Green algae are also known to have extremely thin cell walls due to their aquatic surroundings, and research has shown that green algae is the closest ancestor to living terrestrial and aquatic plants. Terrestrial plants have rigid cell walls meant for withstanding harsh weather, as well as keeping the plant upright as the plant resists gravity. Gravitropism, along with phototropism and hydrotropism, are traits believed to have evolved during the transition from an aquatic to terrestrial habitat. Terrestrial plants no longer had unlimited access to water and had to evolve to search for nutrients in their new surroundings as well as develop cells with new sensory functions, such as statocytes.

=== Photosynthesis ===
Submerged aquatic plants have more restricted access to carbon as carbon dioxide compared to terrestrial plants. They may also experience reduced light levels. In aquatic plants diffuse boundary layers (DBLs) around submerged leaves and photosynthetic stems vary based on the leaves&#x27; thickness, shape and density and are the main factor responsible for the greatly reduced rate of gaseous transport across the leaf/water boundary and therefore greatly inhibit transport of carbon dioxide. To overcome this limitation, many aquatic plants have evolved to metabolise bicarbonate ions as a source of carbon.

Environmental variables affect the instantaneous photosynthetic rates of aquatic plants and the photosynthetic enzymes pigments. In water, light intensity rapidly decreases with depth. Respiration is also higher in the dark per the unit volume of the medium they live in.

=== Reproduction ===
Although most aquatic angiosperms can reproduce by flowering and setting seeds, many have also evolved to have extensive asexual reproduction by means of rhizomes, turions, and fragments in general.

== Functions of Aquatic Plants ==
One of the largest aquatic plants in the world is the Bolivian waterlily, which holds the Guinness World Record of having the largest undivided leaf at diameter; the smallest is the rootless duckweed, which is only across. Many small animals use aquatic plants such as duckweeds and lily pads for spawning or as protective shelters against predators both from above and below the water surface.

Aquatic plants are important primary producers and are the basis of food web for many aquatic fauna, especially wetland species. They compete with phytoplanktons for excess nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, thus reducing the prevalence of eutrophication and harmful algal blooms, and have a significant effect on riparian soil chemistry as their leaves, stems and roots slow down the water flow, capture sediments and trap pollutants. Excess sediment will settle into the stream bed due to the reduced flow rates, and some aquatic plants also have symbiotic microbes capable of nitrogen fixation and breaking down the pollutants trapped and/or absorbed by the roots. Historically, aquatic plants have been less studied than terrestrial plants, and management of aquatic vegetation has become an increasingly interested field as means to reduce agricultural pollution of water bodies.

=== Functions of macrophytes in aquatic systems ===
Macrophytes perform many ecosystem functions in aquatic ecosystems and provide services to human society. One of the important functions performed by macrophyte is uptake of dissolved nutrients including nitrogen and phosphorus. Macrophytes are widely used in constructed wetlands around the world to remove excess N and P from polluted water. Besides direct nutrient uptake, macrophytes indirectly influence nutrient cycling; especially N cycling through influencing the denitrifying bacterial functional groups that are inhabiting on roots and shoots of macrophytes. Macrophytes promote the sedimentation of suspended solids by reducing the current velocities, impede erosion by stabilising soil surfaces. Macrophytes also provide spatial heterogeneity in otherwise unstructured water column. Habitat complexity provided by macrophytes tends to increase diversity and density of both fish and invertebrates.

The additional site-specific macrophytes&#x27; value provides wildlife habitat and makes treatment systems of wastewater aesthetically satisfactory.

=== Uses and importance to humans ===

* Food crops

Some aquatic plants are used by humans as a food source. Examples include wild rice (&quot;Zizania&quot;), water caltrop (&quot;Trapa natans&quot;), Chinese water chestnut (&quot;Eleocharis dulcis&quot;), Indian lotus (&quot;Nelumbo nucifera&quot;), water spinach (&quot;Ipomoea aquatica&quot;), prickly waterlily (&quot;Euryale ferox&quot;), and watercress (&quot;Rorippa nasturtium-aquaticum&quot;).

* Bioassessment

A decline in a macrophyte community may indicate water quality problems and changes in the ecological status of the water body. Such problems may be the result of excessive turbidity, herbicides, or salination. Conversely, overly high nutrient levels may create an overabundance of macrophytes, which may in turn interfere with lake processing. Macrophyte levels are easy to sample, do not require laboratory analysis, and are easily used for calculating simple abundance metrics.

* Potential sources of therapeutic agents

Phytochemical and pharmacological researches suggest that freshwater macrophytes, such as &quot;Centella asiatica&quot;, &quot;Nelumbo nucifera&quot;, &quot;Nasturtium officinale&quot;, &quot;Ipomoea aquatica&quot; and &quot;Ludwigia adscendens&quot;, are promising sources of anticancer and antioxidative natural products.

Hot water extracts of the stem and root of &quot;Ludwigia adscendens&quot;, as well as those of the fruit, leaf and stem of &quot;Monochoria hastata&quot; were found to have lipoxygenase inhibitory activity. Hot water extract prepared from the leaf of &quot;Ludwigia adscendens&quot; exhibits alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity more potent than that of acarbose.

* Wastewater treatment

Macrophytes have an essential role in some forms of wastewater treatment, most commonly in small scale sewage treatment using constructed wetlands or in polishing lagoons for larger schemes.

==Distribution==
The principal factor controlling the distribution of aquatic plants is the availability of water. However, other abiotic factors may also control their distribution including nutrient availability, availability of carbon dioxide and oxygen, water temperature, characteristics of the substrate, water transparency, water movement, and salinity. Some aquatic plants are able to thrive in brackish, saline, and salt water. Also biotic factors like grazing, competition for light, colonization by fungi, and allelopathy are influencing the occurrence of macrophytes.

== Invasive aquatic plants ==
The introduction of non-native aquatic plants has resulted in numerous examples across the world of such plants becoming invasive and frequently dominating the environments into which they have been introduced. Such species include Water hyacinth which is invasive in many tropical and sub-tropical locations including much of the southern US, many Asian countries and Australia. New Zealand stonecrop is a highly invasive plant in temperate climates spreading from a marginal plant to encompassing the whole body of many ponds to the almost total exclusion of other plants and wildlife

Other notable invasive plant species include floating pennywort, Curly leaved pondweed, the fern ally Water fern and Parrot&#x27;s feather. Many of these invasive plants have been sold as oxygenating plants for aquaria or decorative plants for garden ponds and have then been disposed of into the environment.

In 2012, a comprehensive overview of alien aquatic plants in 46 European countries found 96 alien aquatic species. The aliens were primarily native to North America, Asia, and South America. The most spread alien plant in Europe was &quot;Elodea canadensis&quot; (Found in 41 European countries) followed by &quot;Azolla filiculoides&quot; in 25 countries and &quot;Vallisneria spiralis&quot; in 22 countries. The countries with the most recorded alien aquatic plant species were France and Italy with 30 species followed by Germany with 27 species, and Belgium and Hungary with 26 species.

The European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization has published recommendations to European nations advocating the restriction or banning of the trade in invasive alien plants.

<text>Del, or nabla, is an operator used in mathematics (particularly in vector calculus) as a vector differential operator, usually represented by the nabla symbol ∇. When applied to a function defined on a one-dimensional domain, it denotes the standard derivative of the function as defined in calculus. When applied to a &quot;field&quot; (a function defined on a multi-dimensional domain), it may denote any one of three operations depending on the way it is applied: the gradient or (locally) steepest slope of a scalar field (or sometimes of a vector field, as in the Navier–Stokes equations); the divergence of a vector field; or the curl (rotation) of a vector field.

Del is a very convenient mathematical notation for those three operations (gradient, divergence, and curl) that makes many equations easier to write and remember. The del symbol (or nabla) can be formally defined as a vector operator whose components are the corresponding partial derivative operators. As a vector operator, it can act on scalar and vector fields in three different ways, giving rise to three different differential operations: first, it can act on scalar fields by a formal scalar multiplication—to give a vector field called the gradient; second, it can act on vector fields by a formal dot product—to give a scalar field called the divergence; and lastly, it can act on vector fields by a formal cross product—to give a vector field called the curl. These formal products do not necessarily commute with other operators or products. These three uses, detailed below, are summarized as:
* Gradient: formula_1
* Divergence: formula_2
* Curl: formula_3

==Definition==
In the Cartesian coordinate system formula_4 with coordinates formula_5 and standard basis formula_6, del is a vector operator whose formula_7 components are the partial derivative operators formula_8; that is,
:formula_9

Where the expression in parentheses is a row vector. In three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system formula_10 with coordinates formula_11 and standard basis or unit vectors of axes formula_12, del is written as
:formula_13

As a vector operator, del naturally acts on scalar fields via scalar multiplication, and naturally acts on vector fields via dot products and cross products.

More specifically, for any scalar field formula_14 and any vector field formula_15, if one &quot;defines&quot;

:formula_16
:formula_17
:formula_18
:formula_19
:formula_20

then using the above definition of formula_21, one may write

:formula_22
and
:formula_23
and
:formula_24

:Example:
:formula_25
:formula_26

Del can also be expressed in other coordinate systems, see for example del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates.

==Notational uses==
Del is used as a shorthand form to simplify many long mathematical expressions. It is most commonly used to simplify expressions for the gradient, divergence, curl, directional derivative, and Laplacian.

===Gradient===
The vector derivative of a scalar field formula_14 is called the gradient, and it can be represented as:
: formula_28

It always points in the direction of greatest increase of formula_14, and it has a magnitude equal to the maximum rate of increase at the point—just like a standard derivative. In particular, if a hill is defined as a height function over a plane formula_30, the gradient at a given location will be a vector in the xy-plane (visualizable as an arrow on a map) pointing along the steepest direction. The magnitude of the gradient is the value of this steepest slope.

In particular, this notation is powerful because the gradient product rule looks very similar to the 1d-derivative case:
: formula_31

However, the rules for dot products do not turn out to be simple, as illustrated by:
: formula_32

===Divergence===
The divergence of a vector field
formula_33 is a scalar field that can be represented as:
:formula_34

The divergence is roughly a measure of a vector field&#x27;s increase in the direction it points; but more accurately, it is a measure of that field&#x27;s tendency to converge toward or diverge from a point.

The power of the del notation is shown by the following product rule:
:formula_35

The formula for the vector product is slightly less intuitive, because this product is not commutative:
:formula_36

===Curl===
The curl of a vector field formula_37 is a vector function that can be represented as:
:formula_38

The curl at a point is proportional to the on-axis torque that a tiny pinwheel would be subjected to if it were centered at that point.

The vector product operation can be visualized as a pseudo-determinant:
:formula_39

Again the power of the notation is shown by the product rule:
:formula_40

The rule for the vector product does not turn out to be simple:
:formula_41

===Directional derivative===
The directional derivative of a scalar field formula_42 in the direction
formula_43 is defined as:

:formula_44
Which is equal to the following when the gradient exists
:formula_45

This gives the rate of change of a field formula_14 in the direction of formula_47, scaled by the magnitude of formula_47. In operator notation, the element in parentheses can be considered a single coherent unit; fluid dynamics uses this convention extensively, terming it the convective derivative—the &quot;moving&quot; derivative of the fluid.

Note that formula_49 is an operator that takes scalar to a scalar. It can be extended to operate on a vector, by separately operating on each of its components.

===Laplacian===
The Laplace operator is a scalar operator that can be applied to either vector or scalar fields; for cartesian coordinate systems it is defined as:
: formula_50
and the definition for more general coordinate systems is given in vector Laplacian.

The Laplacian is ubiquitous throughout modern mathematical physics, appearing for example in Laplace&#x27;s equation, Poisson&#x27;s equation, the heat equation, the wave equation, and the Schrödinger equation.

===Hessian matrix===

While formula_51 usually represents the Laplacian, sometimes formula_51 also represents the Hessian matrix. The former refers to the inner product of formula_21, while the latter refers to the dyadic product of formula_21:

: formula_55.

So whether formula_51 refers to a Laplacian or a Hessian matrix depends on the context.

===Tensor derivative===
Del can also be applied to a vector field with the result being a tensor. The tensor derivative of a vector field formula_57 (in three dimensions) is a 9-term second-rank tensor – that is, a 3×3 matrix – but can be denoted simply as formula_58, where formula_59 represents the dyadic product. This quantity is equivalent to the transpose of the Jacobian matrix of the vector field with respect to space. The divergence of the vector field can then be expressed as the trace of this matrix.

For a small displacement formula_60, the change in the vector field is given by:
: formula_61

== Product rules ==

For vector calculus:

:formula_62

For matrix calculus (for which formula_63 can be written formula_64):

:formula_65

Another relation of interest (see e.g. &quot;Euler equations&quot;) is the following, where formula_66 is the outer product tensor:
:formula_67 

==Second derivatives==

When del operates on a scalar or vector, either a scalar or vector is returned. Because of the diversity of vector products (scalar, dot, cross) one application of del already gives rise to three major derivatives: the gradient (scalar product), divergence (dot product), and curl (cross product). Applying these three sorts of derivatives again to each other gives five possible second derivatives, for a scalar field &quot;f&quot; or a vector field v; the use of the scalar Laplacian and vector Laplacian gives two more:
: formula_68

These are of interest principally because they are not always unique or independent of each other. As long as the functions are well-behaved (formula_69 in most cases), two of them are always zero:
: formula_70

Two of them are always equal:
: formula_71

The 3 remaining vector derivatives are related by the equation:
:formula_72

And one of them can even be expressed with the tensor product, if the functions are well-behaved:
: formula_73

==Precautions==

Most of the above vector properties (except for those that rely explicitly on del&#x27;s differential properties—for example, the product rule) rely only on symbol rearrangement, and must necessarily hold if the del symbol is replaced by any other vector. This is part of the value to be gained in notationally representing this operator as a vector.

Though one can often replace del with a vector and obtain a vector identity, making those identities mnemonic, the reverse is &quot;not&quot; necessarily reliable, because del does not commute in general.

A counterexample that demonstrates the divergence (formula_74) and the advection operator (formula_75) are not commutative:
:formula_76

A counterexample that relies on del&#x27;s differential properties:
: formula_77

Central to these distinctions is the fact that del is not simply a vector; it is a vector operator. Whereas a vector is an object with both a magnitude and direction, del has neither a magnitude nor a direction until it operates on a function.

For that reason, identities involving del must be derived with care, using both vector identities and &quot;differentiation&quot; identities such as the product rule.
